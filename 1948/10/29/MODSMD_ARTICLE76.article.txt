# Card Tankers Kick and Splash To Overtime Win Over SJ State
## 
### 
A 25-foot shot by Guard Ken Fox in an overtime period won a
hard-fought contest for the Stanford water poloists, as the Cards
downed San Jose State, 6 to 5, yesterday in the Encina Pool.
Behind 5 to 3 with only two minutes remaining to play, the
Indians put on a spectacular rally. Forward Ed Major, who

started in place of the sidelined'
Fritz Maurer, began the fireworks
with a rifle-like shot from half court
that hit the corner of the cake.
Weeden Saves Game
With the score 5 to 4, and 45
seconds left in the game. Guard Don
Weeden sunk the all-important
equalizer, his second goal of the
afternoon. This set the stage for
Fox's overtime goal that clinched
the game.
The first half, however, was a
different story. Without the services
of both forwards, Harry Borchers
and Fritz Maurer, the Indian offense
was held to virtually a standstill.
The score at lialftime was 2-all,
but San Jose definitely looked like
the better team. Two excellent
shots by Hub Stokely and Don
Weeden were the only bright spots
of the first half for the Indians.
Sprint Bob Keeler of the Spartans
scored San Jose's two initial mark
ers.
Botchers Suits Up
With things looking bad for the
Card cause. Coach Tom Haynie sent
in Captain Harry Botchers for the
second half, even though the scoring
ace had been out for the past few
days with a cold. Borehers re
sponded by scoring the only Indian
goal in the the third quarter, but by
this time the Spartans had moved
ahead 4 to 3.
Another San Jose goal with only
three minutes to go almost cinched
the game for the Spartans. However,
the Cards took over from this point
and dramatically clinched the game.
This victory evens the Card-
Spartan series to one game apiece.
San Jose trounced the Indians 8
to 4 last week up at the Olympic
Club pool. Stanford is the first team
to stop the high-geared Staters. San
Jose holds victories this year over
both the Olympic Club and Cali
fornia.
Winged "O" Tomorrow
In a preliminary to the Stanford-
Washington gridiron game tomor
row, Coach Tom Haynie's men tackle
the powerful Olympic Club for the
second time. The Cards are out to
avenge the 19 to 9 loss inflicted on
them by the clubmen in the first
game of the '48 season. The starting
time for the contest is 11 a.m.
