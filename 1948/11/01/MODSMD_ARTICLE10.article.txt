# Redshirts Drub Huskies, 20 to 0

### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's spirited Redshiris could be very tough when they
meet undefeated Army in Yankee Stadium this weekend. Very
tough indeed!
The Indians drove home that point io the more than 25,000
partisan customers who watched them mistreat a strong but

sluggish Washington Husky, 20 to
0, in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
They saw a "new" Card varsity turn
in its third fine game in a row to
avenge the 25 to 0 loss suffered in
Seattle a year ago.
The man who tied most of the
firecrackers to the tail of the frus
trated Husky was Stanford's 191-
pound fullback, Emery Mitchell.
Mitchell passed, kicked, ran.
blocked, tackled, converted, and
kicked o(T. Emery did everything
Saturday. He did everything well.
"Mitch" was the spark that set the
Red Machine in motion.
A Team Victory
It was a team victory from start
to finish. The Card line was so
good that Marchy Schwartz couldn't
single out any stars. In the back
field there was Tommy Shaw who
turned in an outstanding game in
the absence of Aub Devine and Don
Campbell. And then there was Bob
White, and A 1 Turriziani, and Bil
De Young. They were all good.
But leaving the stands the crow<
was all talking about one man-
Emery Mitchell.
They were all talking about how.
with one minute left in the first
half, he took a screen pass fron:
Shaw and threaded his way down
the right sideline 34 yards for Stan
ford's first score.
They were talking about his per
fect fourth-quarter touchdown
strike to Rupe Andrews which iced
the game for Stanford.
Then son.eone would mention his
kicking—how he punted six times
for an average of 42 yards, and his
53-yard kickoff average. They still
didn't see how he took that high
pass from center and with a half
a step got off a punt that traveled
fil yards to the Washington one
yard line. And then how about that
first quarter, 54-yard quick kick that
put the Huskies in a hole from which
they never did recover.
Boom-Boom Mitchell
They laughed when they thought
about how he charged straight down
the center, bounced off one tackier,
shook free another, feinted off a
third, and just kept going until
three men came over to finally pull
him down.
And his crushing key blocks were
what made the Card end sweeps
click.
In short, the crowd agreed that
Mitchell was just about the best
thing to hit these parts since Repeal.
