# Redshirts Drub Huskies, 20 to 0

### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's spirited Redshiris could be very tough when they
meet undefeated Army in Yankee Stadium this weekend. Very
tough indeed!
The Indians drove home that point io the more than 25,000
partisan customers who watched them mistreat a strong but

sluggish Washington Husky, 20 to
0, in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
They saw a "new" Card varsity turn
in its third fine game in a row to
avenge the 25 to 0 loss suffered in
Seattle a year ago.
The man who tied most of the
firecrackers to the tail of the frus
trated Husky was Stanford's 191-
pound fullback, Emery Mitchell.
Mitchell passed, kicked, ran.
blocked, tackled, converted, and
kicked o(T. Emery did everything
Saturday. He did everything well.
"Mitch" was the spark that set the
Red Machine in motion.
A Team Victory
It was a team victory from start
to finish. The Card line was so
good that Marchy Schwartz couldn't
single out any stars. In the back
field there was Tommy Shaw who
turned in an outstanding game in
the absence of Aub Devine and Don
Campbell. And then there was Bob
White, and A 1 Turriziani, and Bil
De Young. They were all good.
But leaving the stands the crow<
was all talking about one man-
Emery Mitchell.
They were all talking about how.
with one minute left in the first
half, he took a screen pass fron:
Shaw and threaded his way down
the right sideline 34 yards for Stan
ford's first score.
They were talking about his per
fect fourth-quarter touchdown
strike to Rupe Andrews which iced
the game for Stanford.
Then son.eone would mention his
kicking—how he punted six times
for an average of 42 yards, and his
53-yard kickoff average. They still
didn't see how he took that high
pass from center and with a half
a step got off a punt that traveled
fil yards to the Washington one
yard line. And then how about that
first quarter, 54-yard quick kick that
put the Huskies in a hole from which
they never did recover.
Boom-Boom Mitchell
They laughed when they thought
about how he charged straight down
the center, bounced off one tackier,
shook free another, feinted off a
third, and just kept going until
three men came over to finally pull
him down.
And his crushing key blocks were
what made the Card end sweeps
click.
In short, the crowd agreed that
Mitchell was just about the best
thing to hit these parts since Repeal.
Washington was a team that al
ways looked as if it was getting
ready to go someplace, but never
quite seemed to get started. In the
first quarter shifty Brooks Biddle
took Ken Rose's kickofl' and raced
back 35 yards to the Stanford 49.
Then with Seth, Kirkby. and Biddle
cracking the guards, the Huskies
piled up three first downs down
to tlie Stanford five, where the In
dian defenders finally took over on
downs.
White Makes iG
On the second play Bob White
brought the ball out 15 yards to
the Stanford 24. The pressure was
off. and that was the last sustained
march that Washington was to
make until the closing minutes of
the game.
That first quarter was possibly the
dullest and fortunately probably the
quickest quarter ever played. Just
18 minutes from whistle to gun,
with only one timeout to interrupt
the clock. Washington completed
he only pass it tried, and the Cards
iidn't throw one until midway
hrough the second quarter.
But Mitchell gave the customers
something to holler about late in
he second quarter when, just as the
econd Card drive threatened to bog
lown, "Mitch" to the screen pass
rom Shaw and went all the way.
iis attempted conversion pass to
3ill De Young went awry, and the
Turds led, 6 to 0.
No Relief for Rooters
But the rotoers were still uneasy,
he Indians had been ahead before
nly to falter and lose in the second
lalf.
Thtv breathed still more uneasily
\ the thiid quarter when Anse
IcCullouyh's pitch to Brooks Bid
ie netted 54 yards down to the In
ain 28. But big Marshall Dallas
obbied, Gordy White recovered,
nt the Indians then proceeded to
,'w up the contest on Mitchell's
ass to Andrews.
The Cards' third touchdown came
-> an anti-climax when, in the
)Ui'th quarter, Bill De Young took
shovel pass from Shaw, sped
tound right end and raced two
usky safety men to the goal line,
'e Youne won, as the horsemen like

to say, going away.
The Huskies were obviously un
inspired. Credit the Cal game last
week for that. But we have rea
son to believe that the Indians
weren't particularly "high" either.
They just put together tiO minutes
of solid, heads-up football. In our
book, they were 20 points better
than Washington Saturday. And
with six injured regulars on the
bench at that.
Injuries were light. Halfback Dave
Field came out early in the going
with a slight hip pointer, and guard
Don Lucas suftered a strained leg
tendon.
Yes, the Indians could be very
tough next Saturday.

)Ui'th quarter, Bill De Young took
shovel pass from Shaw, sped
tound right end and raced two
usky safety men to the goal line,
'e Youne won, as the horsemen like

to say, going away.
The Huskies were obviously un
inspired. Credit the Cal game last
week for that. But we have rea
son to believe that the Indians
weren't particularly "high" either.
They just put together tiO minutes
of solid, heads-up football. In our
book, they were 20 points better
than Washington Saturday. And
with six injured regulars on the
bench at that.
Injuries were light. Halfback Dave
Field came out early in the going
with a slight hip pointer, and guard
Don Lucas suftered a strained leg
tendon.
Yes, the Indians could be very
tough next Saturday.
Stanford's spirited Redshiris could be very tough when they
meet undefeated Army in Yankee Stadium this weekend. Very
tough indeed!
The Indians drove home that point io the more than 25,000
partisan customers who watched them mistreat a strong but

sluggish Washington Husky, 20 to
0, in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
They saw a "new" Card varsity turn
in its third fine game in a row to
avenge the 25 to 0 loss suffered in
Seattle a year ago.
The man who tied most of the
firecrackers to the tail of the frus
trated Husky was Stanford's 191-
pound fullback, Emery Mitchell.
Mitchell passed, kicked, ran.
blocked, tackled, converted, and
kicked o(T. Emery did everything
Saturday. He did everything well.
"Mitch" was the spark that set the
Red Machine in motion.
A Team Victory
It was a team victory from start
to finish. The Card line was so
good that Marchy Schwartz couldn't
single out any stars. In the back
field there was Tommy Shaw who
turned in an outstanding game in
the absence of Aub Devine and Don
Campbell. And then there was Bob
White, and A 1 Turriziani, and Bil
De Young. They were all good.
But leaving the stands the crow<
was all talking about one man-
Emery Mitchell.
They were all talking about how.
with one minute left in the first
half, he took a screen pass fron:
Shaw and threaded his way down
the right sideline 34 yards for Stan
ford's first score.
They were talking about his per
fect fourth-quarter touchdown
strike to Rupe Andrews which iced
the game for Stanford.
Then son.eone would mention his
kicking—how he punted six times
for an average of 42 yards, and his
53-yard kickoff average. They still
didn't see how he took that high
pass from center and with a half
a step got off a punt that traveled
fil yards to the Washington one
yard line. And then how about that
first quarter, 54-yard quick kick that
put the Huskies in a hole from which
they never did recover.
Boom-Boom Mitchell
They laughed when they thought
about how he charged straight down
the center, bounced off one tackier,
shook free another, feinted off a
third, and just kept going until
three men came over to finally pull
him down.
And his crushing key blocks were
what made the Card end sweeps
click.
In short, the crowd agreed that
Mitchell was just about the best
thing to hit these parts since Repeal.
Washington was a team that al
ways looked as if it was getting
ready to go someplace, but never
quite seemed to get started. In the
first quarter shifty Brooks Biddle
took Ken Rose's kickofl' and raced
back 35 yards to the Stanford 49.
Then with Seth, Kirkby. and Biddle
cracking the guards, the Huskies
piled up three first downs down
to tlie Stanford five, where the In
dian defenders finally took over on
downs.
White Makes iG
On the second play Bob White
brought the ball out 15 yards to
the Stanford 24. The pressure was
off. and that was the last sustained
march that Washington was to
make until the closing minutes of
the game.
That first quarter was possibly the
dullest and fortunately probably the
quickest quarter ever played. Just
18 minutes from whistle to gun,
with only one timeout to interrupt
the clock. Washington completed
he only pass it tried, and the Cards
iidn't throw one until midway
hrough the second quarter.
But Mitchell gave the customers
something to holler about late in
he second quarter when, just as the
econd Card drive threatened to bog
lown, "Mitch" to the screen pass
rom Shaw and went all the way.

No Relief for Rooters
But the rotoers were still uneasy,
he Indians had been ahead before
nly to falter and lose in the second
lalf.
Thtv breathed still more uneasily
\ the thiid quarter when Anse
IcCullouyh's pitch to Brooks Bid
ie netted 54 yards down to the In
ain 28. But big Marshall Dallas
obbied, Gordy White recovered,
nt the Indians then proceeded to
,'w up the contest on Mitchell's
ass to Andrews.
The Cards' third touchdown came
-> an anti-climax when, in the
)Ui'th quarter, Bill De Young took
shovel pass from Shaw, sped
tound right end and raced two
usky safety men to the goal line,
'e Youne won, as the horsemen like

to say, going away.
The Huskies were obviously un
inspired. Credit the Cal game last
week for that. But we have rea
son to believe that the Indians
weren't particularly "high" either.
They just put together tiO minutes
of solid, heads-up football. In our
book, they were 20 points better
than Washington Saturday. And
with six injured regulars on the
bench at that.
Injuries were light. Halfback Dave
Field came out early in the going
with a slight hip pointer, and guard
Don Lucas suftered a strained leg
tendon.
Yes, the Indians could be very
tough next Saturday.
Stanford's spirited Redshiris could be very tough when they
meet undefeated Army in Yankee Stadium this weekend. Very
tough indeed!
The Indians drove home that point io the more than 25,000
partisan customers who watched them mistreat a strong but

sluggish Washington Husky, 20 to
0, in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
They saw a "new" Card varsity turn
in its third fine game in a row to
avenge the 25 to 0 loss suffered in
Seattle a year ago.
The man who tied most of the
firecrackers to the tail of the frus
trated Husky was Stanford's 191-
pound fullback, Emery Mitchell.
Mitchell passed, kicked, ran.
blocked, tackled, converted, and
kicked o(T. Emery did everything
Saturday. He did everything well.
"Mitch" was the spark that set the
Red Machine in motion.
A Team Victory
It was a team victory from start
to finish. The Card line was so
good that Marchy Schwartz couldn't
single out any stars. In the back
field there was Tommy Shaw who
turned in an outstanding game in
the absence of Aub Devine and Don
Campbell. And then there was Bob
White, and A 1 Turriziani, and Bil
De Young. They were all good.
But leaving the stands the crow<
was all talking about one man-
Emery Mitchell.
They were all talking about how.
with one minute left in the first
half, he took a screen pass fron:
Shaw and threaded his way down
the right sideline 34 yards for Stan
ford's first score.
They were talking about his per
fect fourth-quarter touchdown
strike to Rupe Andrews which iced
the game for Stanford.
Then son.eone would mention his
kicking—how he punted six times
for an average of 42 yards, and his
53-yard kickoff average. They still
didn't see how he took that high
pass from center and with a half
a step got off a punt that traveled
fil yards to the Washington one
yard line. And then how about that
first quarter, 54-yard quick kick that
put the Huskies in a hole from which
they never did recover.
Boom-Boom Mitchell
They laughed when they thought
about how he charged straight down
the center, bounced off one tackier,
shook free another, feinted off a
third, and just kept going until
three men came over to finally pull
him down.
And his crushing key blocks were
what made the Card end sweeps
click.
In short, the crowd agreed that
Mitchell was just about the best
thing to hit these parts since Repeal.
Washington was a team that al
ways looked as if it was getting
ready to go someplace, but never
quite seemed to get started. In the
first quarter shifty Brooks Biddle
took Ken Rose's kickofl' and raced
back 35 yards to the Stanford 49.
Then with Seth, Kirkby. and Biddle
cracking the guards, the Huskies
piled up three first downs down
to tlie Stanford five, where the In
dian defenders finally took over on
downs.
White Makes iG
On the second play Bob White
brought the ball out 15 yards to
the Stanford 24. The pressure was
off. and that was the last sustained
march that Washington was to
make until the closing minutes of
the game.
That first quarter was possibly the
dullest and fortunately probably the
quickest quarter ever played. Just
18 minutes from whistle to gun,
with only one timeout to interrupt
the clock. Washington completed
he only pass it tried, and the Cards
iidn't throw one until midway
hrough the second quarter.
But Mitchell gave the customers
something to holler about late in
he second quarter when, just as the
econd Card drive threatened to bog
lown, "Mitch" to the screen pass
