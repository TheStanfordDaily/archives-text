# 'All-German Government' Proposed by 'Red' Council
## 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 31 (AP) —The Russians began today a new pro
paganda drive aimed at forcing the Western Allies out of Ger
many.
The used the Communist German Peoples' Council here to
issue a declaration demanding a peace treaty with an "All-Ger-

man government" and withdrawal
of all occupation forces within i<
year after the treaty is signed.
This declaration said that if the
Western Powers "now hinder the
conclusion of an all-German peace
treaty, the continued presence of
their occupation troops and admin
istrative organs amounts to colonial
annexation of German territory and
colonial enslavement of the German
people."
Western authorities called this a
Soviet move to win over the Ger
man people and embarrass the West.
They considered it an attempt to
popularize the Russian proposal,
made several months ago at the
Warsaw conference of eastern for
eign ministers, for an early with
drawal of all occupying forces.
Two Major Developments
The new campaign followed tw.
major developments in recent weeks
which indicated the Russians may be
preparing to pull their troops out
of Eastern Germany:
1. Organization of the Armed
Peoples' Police Forces, now esti
mated by the Allies at about 300.0(10
men, in the Soviet zone.
2. A concerted program for tht
removal of industrial facilities from
Eastern Germany to Russia.
There is no doubt the German
would like to have their country
back for themselves. Many fear,
however, that if the Western Power
withdraw at an early date the Com
munists might take over the countrj
with the aid of the Peoples' Polio
Seek Withdrawal of Troops
The council's statement reiterated
the well-worn Communist claim th; •
the Western Allies had forfeited
their right to remain in Berlin b>
"breaking four-power agreements."
(In Moscow, the Communist news
paper. Pravda, published a Tass Ber
lin dispatch claiming "numerous vio
lations" of the rules of air safety
by British and American planes
Last week Soviet authorities in Ber
lin denied the existence of any rules
of air safety after the Western Pow
ers had charged Soviet violations.)
