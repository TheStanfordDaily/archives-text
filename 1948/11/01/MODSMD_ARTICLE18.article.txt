# Glen Taylor Speaks to 500 At IPP Rally at Village Gate
## 
### 
Glen Taylor, vice-presidential candidate of the Independent
Progressive Party, spoke to about 500 people at the Ravenswood
entrance to Stanford Village Friday afternoon.
Mr. Taylor minced no words as he explained the reasons be
hind his entry into the vice-presidential campaign on the Pro
gressive ticket. ♦

According to Taylor, our present
government is run by "the same
gang who financed Hitler" and is
"rapidly leading us into another war
to gain more profits for capitalists
in Wall Street."
Taylor explained his earlier color
ful campaigning as an effort to gain
public attention so that he might
expound his liberal ideas. "They
might ignore me, but they sure
•couldn't ignore the horse," said the
Idaho senator, as grammarians in
the predominantly student audience
winced.
The candidate made statement
after statement to show the dis
honesty of leaders like defense di
rector Forrestal, William Draper,
and John Foster Dulles. The latter
ho described as "the unofficial Sec
retary of State, who will become
official if and when Dewey is
elected."
A negative allusion to the great
ness of ex-President Hoover brought
mixed chuckles and remarks from
the crowd and Taylor quickly re
covered with: "I said that people
thought he was great, 1 didn't say
he wasn't great."
Later, when speaking of the in
competence of President Truman, he
said, "I saw Truman when he heard
he'd become President, and I'm tell
ing you, Truman was whiter in life
than Roosevelt was in death." Com
meeting on both his political rivals'
connections with Wall Street, Tay
lor said, "Truman is only a stooge
for them—Dewey would be a col
laborator."
