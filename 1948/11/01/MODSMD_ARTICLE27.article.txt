## Children at Play 
### 
The Cal "kids" are at play again.
Misbehavior in the Cal rooting section and poor sportsman
ship have been problems long facing university authorities.
Just last week, the Assistant to the President of University of
California suggested that the recurring football shenanigans be
cleared up by student control.
These "crackpot" rooters persist in childish and often obscene
antics which have given the northern university an ill-gotten
notoriety.
Like the child who has been pampered too long by an over
indulgent parent and is suddenly deprived of candy, the Cal
rooter has exhibited on the social level that his actions are not
mature enough for him to assume adult responsibility.
The obscene gestures, the tearing up of stadium seats, and
rolling of rivals not only makes the bumpkin Bears poor op
ponents in any athletic contest, but makes the the "laughing
stock" as far south as UCLA. The Bruins have already expressed
their shame for their shaggy brothers' game-time circus.
What psychology should be administered to the ailing Cal
rooter is another guestiork Certainly, the Cal rally committee
has no prescription, or the activities of their unco-operative card
sections would have been sguelched already.
We are in favor of giving the "kiddies" other toys to toss
around. If football enthusiasm is channeled in the right direc
tion, the ensuing rooter spirit will become a credit to its team.
Right now, the California football team might very well disown
its rowdy fans in favor of Berkeley High School.
Whatever the outcome, we are certain that the Cal rooting
section is one less thing of which to be proud.

rooting sections, see the Letters to the Editor below.)
