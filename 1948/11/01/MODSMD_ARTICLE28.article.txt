To the Editor:
According to last week's Daily, "Midget bookkeepers are the little
things that count." Here is something (hat really counts a clipping from
Braven Dyer's column in the Los Angeles Times. Read it and you'll see
that it's one of the little things that adds to our pride in Stanford.
"Speaking about crackpot students, California rooters have been
warned that disciplinary measures are likely if they don't behave better
.... The Bears could take lessons from Stanford, which seems to be
tops in school spirit this season . . . ."
MRS. WALTER PHELPS
To the Editor:
You might be interested in this reaction to the Stanford looting section
at the UCLA game last weekend from Frank Lowery's column in the
Inglewood Daily News. Not only was he enthusiastic about the rooting
section in general, but was totally mystified at Tom Elke's one-footed
performances.
"It has been a long time since I lived in Northern California and I'd
forgotten that the students there seem to display more pep and imagina
tion at football games than our local rooting sections.
"But it was brought home at the Coliseum when a small band of Stan
ford rooters, plus their band, even had the Bruin fans with them for
the efforts. Yell-leaders in hula skirts, Indians prancing around, pom
pons waving, card stunts, a band that was seldom quiet, and the most
enthusiastic bunch of gids you ever wanted to see . . .
