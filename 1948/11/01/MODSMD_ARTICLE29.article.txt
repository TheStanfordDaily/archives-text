Dear Editor:
I didn't mind when you threatened to stop publishing my column and
replace it with a daily message from Mary Margaret Mc√üride .... I
didn't mind when you started to referring to me as "Old B-S" . . . . 1
didn't mind when you told me I should drown myself by singing "Trees"
at the dog show .... I didn't mind when you said my teeth looked like
a sparkling soft drink (one down and Seven-up) .... and I didn't mind
when you told everyone that I should write for a Chinese paper because my
column was much funnier if one started at the end and read it backwards.
I wasn't hurt when you said my father should have been arrested for
peddling dope the day after I was born .... I wasn't hurt when you said
I should find a girl and get pinned because I have the head for it .... I
wasn t hurt when you told me I wrote like I was using the wrong end of
the pencil .... I wasn't hurt when you said I cheated on exams by
writing notes on my petticoat .... and I wasn't hurt when you claimed
that my girl looked as cold as a mother-in-law's kiss.
I didn't care when you called me "science's greatest argument for birth
control" .... I didn't care when you intimated that I was a dog because
I spend so much time going over the Saturday Evening "Post" . . . . 1
didn't care when you threatened to demote me and make me only a
full professor at the University of California .... I didn't care when
you suggested that I become one of the University of Oregon Ducks be
cause I have web feet .... and I didn't care when you suggested that
1 kill myself by writing.a column underwater with my ball-point pen.
I didn't mind all these things. But, at last, you cur, sir, like a fresh
man in the cactus gardens, you have gone too far! You have uttered
the insult which I cannot ignore.
At the end of my column for last Friday, you had the audacity to in
sinuate in print that I would pull such a low trick as to use this column
for advertising for a dance that is being given by my fratenrity. I low
could you say such a thing?
Under the circumstances, I feel the only honorable thing for me to
do is to resign this position. It is a step which I take with great regret.
But I feel that I must do it. Please consider this letter as the last piece
of copy you will ever receive from me.
Sincerely,
P. S. What time is tomorrow's deadline?
