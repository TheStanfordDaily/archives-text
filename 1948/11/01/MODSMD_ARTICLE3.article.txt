## Farm Students Favor Dewey in Daily Survey 
### LORRY LOKEY 
If Stanford students were to vote for a president today, the majority of
them would cast their ballots in favor of Thomas E. Dewey, a Daily survey
has revealed.
The stratified survey, based on the opinions of 4,500 Farm students living
on campus and in the Village, gave the New York governor 67.7 per cent
of the votes. Incumbent candidate Harry Truman placed a low second
with 9.6 per cent, Wallace was third with 8 per cent, and Socialist can
didate Norman Thomas last with 4 per cent.
A large number of students at this late date registered a "no opinion"
vote in The Daily survey.
Although the poll indicates a one-sided race for the country's top politi
cal office, the Stanford-Palo Alto area has consistently favored the Repub
lican Party presidential candidates in recent years.
An interesting result of the survey appeared in the answers to the
question, "Whom do you think will win the presidential election?"
OVer 95 per cent of men and women interviewed thought Dewey would
win the election. Only 1.6 per cent of the Truman supporters believed
that the President would win his first presidential campaign. Two and a
half per cent of the students gave "no opinion" guesses.

next President of the United States.
