### TOM WIEDER 
My vote for President Harry S.
Truman might properly be termed
a party vote. While I am firmly
convinced that Truman is not the
most personally capable of the po
tential candidates for the two major
parties, he represents to me the
type of government that will keep
the United States from a disastrous
swing to the Right.
Truman presented to the Eight
ieth Congress one of the fairest and
most progressive programs con
ceivable, many parts of it sanc
tioned by his Republican opponent.
Among these were: public housing,
civil rights, extension of social se
curity, more adequate minimum
wages, reciprocal trade agreements
to foster world prosperity, and a
firm but fair foreign policy. These
form only a fraction of Truman's
Democratic Pr.rty's farsighted plat
form. Past actions, both pre-war
and post-war. make it clear to me
that the Republicans have little
sympathy with these proposals.
Whatever chance the Republicans
had to gain my vote for their side
was lost in the farcical demonstra
tion they put on during the special
session called by President Truman
last July. A shrewd political ma
neuver, undoubtedly. They showed
the hollowness of their "liberalism"
at that session, and their cowardice
on the civil rights proposals was
sickening.
Mr. Truman has the party back
ground to drive his platform
through, but can accomplish this
only wilh a House of Representa
tives with less reactionary leanings.
I have lit lie criticism for the Sen
ate, and it appears that we may
have a Democratic majority in that
house after Tuesday's elections.
Whoever the winner in the White
House, he may expect the fullest
co-operation from that Senate,
Democratic or otherwise, except on
civil rights. The probable winner,
Mr. Dewey, 1 believe to have the

highest intentions, but his more lib
eral proposals will rcceive a cold
shoulder from any but a Demo
cratic majority, impossible in 1948.
