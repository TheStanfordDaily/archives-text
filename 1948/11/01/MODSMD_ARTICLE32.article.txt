I'm for Henry Wallace artd the
Progressive Party because I don't
want to be put in jail for writing
ihis article. Carry the Un- Ameri
can Activities Committee actions a
little further and anyone who sup
ports government aid or regulation
will be called a threat to the coun
try and jailed without a trial. Loy
alty boards and Congressional in
quisitions have made reading even
the New Republic a crime, punish
able by the loss of a job or a jail
sentence. One of the few Loyalty
Board transcripts to be made pub
lic concerns the case of a 61-year
old Navy Yard machinist who lost
his job because he went to a Soviet
movie, attended a meeting spon
sored by the American - Soviet
Friendship Society and preferred to
read Literary Guild book rather
than go to a ball game. Only the
Progressive Party is fighting for
political freedom by demanding an
end to the terror and intimidation
campaign in Congress and the ad
ministration. Only Henry Wallace
wants to give the people the right
to express themselves and learn
the facts.
I'm for Henry Wallace and the
Progressive Party because I want to
be able to earn a decent living, buy
lood and' clothes, and have a home.
Look at the facts about the OPA.
A combination of Republicans and
Democrats destroyed the OPA when
a Fortune poll—a Luce magazine,
by the way—revealed that 67 per
cent of the people supported it. And
what happened? Prices rose de
spite the NAM's assurance that
they would fall. The Progressive
Party is the only party which
stands for measures which will stop
inflation—restoration of price con
trol and rollback on prices. Henry
Wallace is the only candidate who
wants direct government responsi
bility for building eight million low
cost homes. And I can't wait until
the other parties compromise be
tween the need for adequate hous
ing and the bankers' and builders'
interest to have a roof over my
head.
I'm for Henry Wallace and the
Progressive Party because I want to
live, and not be destroyed in an
atomic war.The Progressive Party
is the only party which is trying to
build peace with TRUE AMERI
CAN IDEALS. I don't think you
build peace through destroying, but
through building. And what are
the Republicans doing? Stopping
Communism by the Marshall Plan,
but at the same time preventing the
recovery and reconstruction of Eu
rope by forcing goods on them that
they don't need, by dictating an
economic policy to European coun
tries which is not based on their
own individual conditions. Wallace
offers a constructive program of re
covery through the United Nations
with the emphasis on peace and
plenty, not on destruction and nar
row profit. I'm for Henry Wallace
and the Progressive Party because

I don't want to see my husbands
and sons, whoever they may be,
brought up in an armed camp dom
inated by a military philosophy. 1
don't want the United States to be
come a second Germany Hitler
said he was fighting Communism
100, or have we already forgotten
that we fell for the Nazi pro; aganda
of Germany as the last stand
against Bolshevism. Only Henry
Wallace and the Progressive Party
want to stop the draft and arma
ment race.
I'm for Henry Wallace and the
Progressive Party because they of
fer red MEAT instead of red her
ring. I'm for Henry Wallace and
the Progressive Party because only
they believe in a future of peace,
plenty, and abundance; and only
they are backing up this belief
with a constructive program fol
lowing the ideals of Jefferson, Lin
coln, and Franklin Roosevelt.
