# Thurmond
## 
### PRISCILLA CLAUDIUS 
The reader might well ask why
anyone in California would vote for
Thurmond and Wright, candidates
who have no chance of being elect
ed, who are not even on the ballot
in this state, and who have not even
solicited votes outside the Southern
states. One might also question
voting for a platform so objection
able to most non-Southerners.
In their cries of "reactionary and
race-baiting," few people seem to
understand the real purpose of the
Dixiecrat movement. It is obvious
ly a movement to recapture con
trol of the Democratic Party. If
Truman, without the support of the
South, is defeated, the Southern
Democrats have a good chance of
regaining leadership in the defeated
party.
Since Roosevelt engineered the
measure to determine party policy
by a simple majority in the con
ventions, the Southerners have lost
the power they held when the pol
icy had to be decided by a two
thirds majority. Since that time, the
Democratic leaders have consecu
tively ignored, opposed, and abused
the South, knowing that the South
erners would vote Democratic any
way. I hope that this revolt, led by
Thurmond and Wright, will teach
them that they cannot continue
such tactics.
Regardless of what misdirected
ideology the Southerners may rep
resent, the fact that their vote is es
sential to the election of a Demo
cratic President should entitle
them to some control in the party
I am by conviction a Democrat
but I cannot honestly support the
group of men who have literally
seized control of the party in tlu
last 15 years. These people shoulc
certainly be entitled to a politica
representation, but not at the ex
pense of corrupting and transform
ing a well-established party.
Because I wish to see the Demo
cratic Party rise from the disgrace
ful level to which it has desettfi' le
in the past several years, I am vot
ing for Thurmond nnel Wright,
feel that they are the representa
tives of the REAL Democratic
party.
