# Big Game Gaieties Will Open Three-Day Run November 17
## 
### 
Stanford-Cal rivalry will receive
added dramatic spark when the
1948 edition of the Ram's Head Big
Game Gaieties opens its three-day
run Nov. 17 in Memorial Audito
rium.
This fast-paced review will move
from satiric sketches of the Great
American Way to a musical ex
travaganza, the Gaieties Carnival.
Ten of Hollywood's darlings will
go through the mimes and panto
mimes of their routine, "We Ought
to Be in Pictures," while the Farm's
favorite actor, Ray Pond, will be

featured in a new adaptation of the
Broadway thriller, "Gaslight."
The current housing enigma will
be satirized by a song and dance
act entitled "Nu Vacancy."
Musical numbers, under the di
rection of Don ShefTey, will include
"Gaieties "48." "The Whole World
Is a Carnival," and "Big Game Fi
nale." ShefYcy will be remembered
for his musical arrangements for
last year's Spring Show and Big
Game Gaieties.
Song stylists Bobby Pettingill,
Nancy Toll, and Roger Starr will
croon especially written Gaieties
ballads.
Bud Irving, who directed "Of
Mice and Men" in the Little The
aicr this summer will direct the
Gaieties. Irving formerly appeared
in the Broadway productions of
"The American Way." "Brooklyn,
U.5.A.," and "Something for the
Boys."
Tickets will be priced at $1.50,
$1.20. and 90 cents. Curtain will
go up at 8:30 p.m. Nov. 17. and at
9:15 p.m. Nov. 18 and 19. so as not
to conflict with other Big Game ac
tivities on campus.


DIRECTOR RUD IRVING explains (he fine points <>t the script to c nor us
members Carle Forslew, Zelle Letts, Jane Allen, and Midge Price, as the
Big Game Gaieties goes into its second week of rehearsal.
