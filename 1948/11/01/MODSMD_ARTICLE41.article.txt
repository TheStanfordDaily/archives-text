The story of the Moor of Venice,
written at the turn of the sixteenth
century, is the summit of Shake
speare's works from a dramatic
point of view, according to Dr. A.
Nicholas Vardac, director.
"The pattern of the play follows
a direct line in which there is no
relaxation of tension till the climax
is reached," says Vardac.
The dynamic quality of the pro
duction is being displayed to the
fullest by the use of Elizabethan
staging and movie production tech
niques, which make possible con
tinuous action.
"The audience cannot help but
be swept along as the poisonous in
fluence of lago leads Othello to
avenge his wife's supposed infidel
ity by murder. With each staging
of the play, audiences are gripped
by the most painfully exciting and
most terrible extremes of pity and
fear," Vardac said of the classic
work.
