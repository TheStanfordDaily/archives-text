## Indians Hold CCSF To Tie 
### 
Stanford and City College of San
Francisco soccer teams played (o a
hard - iought 2 - all tie Saturday
morning on the local field. The
game was as even as they come,
and both teams were satisfied with
the final outcome.
The Indians scored first in the
second quarter when Tony Ortega
scored with the aid of some sharp
passing by Larry Peterson and
Amos Salvador. Both teams were
threatening throughout the first
half, but only the one goal was
scored.
The Bams managed to outmaneu
ver goalie Walt Dunbar to even the
score midway through the third
quarter. However, the Indians
came right back to take a 2-1 lead
on a break. After a corner kick by
Stanford there was a free ball in
front of the City College goal, and
one of the defenders knocked it into
his own goal with his head.
City College tied it up again with
eight minutes remaining in the
game on a long kick that seemed
to float over Dunbar's head. Both
lams had chances in those last
eight minutes, but the goalies were
just a little too lough.
Coach John Segal, who called on
many jayvees Saturday, made two
line-up changes which worked ex
ceedingly well. Larry Peterson was
switched from fullback to center
forward, and he played at his new
position like a veteran. Jimmy Sa
cerdote played an excellent game in
his new backfield position. Big John
Ah rens also was a bulwark of
strength on defense.
It was the third tie for City Col
lege, which has not lost a game
this year. The Stanford record now
shows two wins, two losses, and one
tie.
