# Frosh Gridders Blast Menlo; Run Unbeaten String; to 10
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Academy Award performances by a brace of ends and a half
back, plus some bad casting in the middle of the Menlo line,
1 made the first feature of Saturday's double bill at the Stadium a
satisfying production for Director Chuck Taylor, as his Stanfoid
Frosh chopped up the Menlo Junior College Oaks, 27 to 6.

* * - •> ■ ~
In trouncing Mcnlo, hitherto 1 re
garded as one of the strongest jun
ior college elevens in the West, the
unbeaten Cards extended their win
streak to 10 games extending over
two season, and effectively squelched
any hopes the Oaks might have en
tertained for a bid to the Little Rose
Bowl.
As it was, the unusual and inter
esting technique of Mcnlo pivotman
Dave Shallenberger in bouncing the
ball on punt formation was directly
accountable lor two Stanford scores.
However, a pair of Stanford guards,
Owen Powell and Captain Jess Cone,
who played opposite Shallenberger,
were just as accountable for his in
ability to concentrate on his job.
Score Could Have Been Ili^hcr
Again, while it was obvious that
Coach Ray Hughes' boys were a
better ball club than they looked
in losing their second game in three
years, it was more obvious that
Taylor, after the first quarter, could
have run the score as high as he
wanted. But, as has been the case
in every frosh game, the second
and third strings played more time
than the first.
Gaining possession of the ball on
the Mcnlo 28-yard line by virtue
of a bad pass from center some two
minutes after the opening kickoff,
the Cards lost no time in getting six
points. On their first play from
scrimmage, quarterback Gary Ker
korian passed to end Bill McColl in
the flat, and McColl in turn later
aled to halfback Harry Hugasian,
who was in the end zone before the
defenders could change direction.
Kerkorian passed to end Wilbur
Taylor for the extra point.
Hugasian Scores Again
Again, late in the sccond period

after center Doug Thamer hail
snagged a Menlo aerial on the 32,
"Hustlin'" Harry hipper-dippered
his way for a the score from the 12.
McColl's kick was good.
The locals had another six points
handed them in the third frame by
a miscued pass from center on fourth
down by Shallenberger, and reserve
half Dean Shepard went over on the
second try. McColl's boot made the
score 20 to 0.
Menlo's turn came finally in the
last stanza with quarterback Earl
Hassel passing to end Bill Walkin
shaw in the end zone. Bob Latham,
reserve Card tackle, broke through
to block the kick for point.
Lineman's Dream
Adding insult to injury, rotund
tackle Owen Rhul topped off the
day's scoring a few minutes before
the finish by intercepting Hassel's
pass and rambling 70 yards to pay
dirt. End Jack Rivenburg had de
flected the ball into the big tackle'.l
- arms on the Stanford 30
Picking up momentum with cvcr>
stride like a snowball on a hillside
Rhul roared into paydirt territory
to accomplish every lineman':
dream.
The defensive play of ends Jael
Rye and Wilbur, center Doug Tha
mer, and fullback Marv Mellawa;
was particularly outstanding anion;
the team's fine defensive work.
Offensively, it was Hugasinn wit)
his spectacular running, ends Mr
Coll and Bill Storum with their pas
snatching, Kerkorian's fine sign;
calling, and a line whose charg
simply could not be denied, thi
brought victory to the Redshirts.
Even though the first string ha
little chance to display its full tal
ents, the frosh .showed for the fir;
time a consistent run of the cla.<
they have flashed off and on all sen
son.
