# OC Reserves Beat '52 Water Poloists
## 
### 
I Despite the offensive ability of
j Tom Hill, the Stanford freshmen
] dropped a G to 4 water polo decision
| to the Olympic Club reserves. The
j game was played in the Encina pool
ias a pre'iminary to the varsity-
Olympic Club match.
Hill's scoring punch kept the
| freshmen in the game most of the
J way but the added experience of
j the Winged "O" team proved to be
j the decisive factor. The club led
j 3 to 2 at the half.
Today the freshmen face Sequoia
I High School in the Stanford pool.
