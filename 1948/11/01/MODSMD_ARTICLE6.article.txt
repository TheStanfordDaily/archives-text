# New Science Building Rises
## 
### 
That noise down Via Palou
means that work on Stanford's new
electron linear accelerator building
is progressing rapidly.
Located just south ot' Sequoia Hall,
the $170,294 building is being con
structed to house the atom-smasher
following its completion next win
ter. The accelerator, being built by
University physicists, will be capable
of producing 400 million electron
volts from its 160-foot, length.
The building, 300 feet long and 80
feet wide, is now in the hammer and
nail stage, with the major steel
framework complete after many
days of noisy riveting.
Extension of the University's new
electrical network is being made to
the building, and it is hoped that
from this the accelerator will some
day hurl a billion volts in its
bombardment process.
The accelerator will be shielded
by lead sheets and concrete blocks
several feet in thickness.
Workmen are now in the process
of building tho concrete end walls
and laying insulated brick along the
sides of the building.
