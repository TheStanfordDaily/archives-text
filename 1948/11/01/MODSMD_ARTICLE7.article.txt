# Hoover Libe Short Summons Firemen
## 
### 
A shorted wire In the Hoover
Tower caused an alarm to be sent
to the fire station yesterday after
noon.
Upon investigation by the fire
men, the short was discovered in
the upper floors of the building. It
was attributed to workmen having
cut into the wire when working
there.
