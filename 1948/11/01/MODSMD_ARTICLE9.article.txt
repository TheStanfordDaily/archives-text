# Presidential Debate Set for Tonight
## 
### 
Three two-man debate teams,
each representing a main can
didate in tomorrow's presiden
tial elections, will clash tonight
at 8 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Candidates from the Republican,
Democratic, and Progresive parties
will be represented respectively by
Jack Marcum and M. E. Harrison,
George Velliotes and John Hines,
and Ernie Schmidt and Tom Lupher.
Each debater will be given 10
minutes for his constructive speech
and five minutes for his rebuttal.
Following the debate, an audience
participation ballot will be taken to
determine the winners, and an open
discussion, all present participating,
will be held.
Tom Brand, Stanford debater, will
be chairman of the debate, the first
of its kind held here since the war.
Sponsoring the event is the Stanford
Debating Society, which has invited
everyone to attend.
New to the relatively old guard of
Farm debaters tonight will be M. E.
Judge Harrison, a former page
with the House of Representatives.
A freshman, "Judge" has had much
in the way of oratorical experience,
being both the founder and presi
dent of the Capitol Debating Club
in Washington. With Jack Marcum,
Debating Society captain, he will
represent the Dewey-Warren ticket.
John Hines and George Velliotes,
debate manager and member of the
society, respectively, will uphold the

Democrats, Truman and Barkley.
Both arc well known to followers
of debate activities here.
Of all the men debating tonight,
Tom Lupher, representing the Wal
lace-Taylor faction, has probably
been the most active in furthering
the cause of his party's rise to the
Presidency.
He is the organizer of the Young

Progressives of Southern California,
and the vice-chairman of the Cali
fornia Students for Wallace group.
He represented the latter organiza
tion at the Progressive Party con
vention earlier in the year.
His partner, Ernie Schmidt, is
somewhat of a newcomer, hailing
from Oregon State College where he
spent his first two university years.
