CHECK MARKS INDICATE 31 states where voting
today will determine makeup and party control of
Senate in Slst Congress. Thirty-two senators are to
be elected; Louisiana votes for two. Heavier check
marks denote states where political leaders expect
some close contests as Democrats, with 45 senators
now, seek to pick up four seats in eft'ort to gain a
majority. States partly shaded denote those now

with one Democratic, one Republican. Cheek marks
in such states indicate the seat involved in the elec
tion—whether Republican (white halt) or Demo
cratic (shaded half). No Senate seat is involved in
today's election in the other 17 states. Maine elected
a Republican senator in September.
