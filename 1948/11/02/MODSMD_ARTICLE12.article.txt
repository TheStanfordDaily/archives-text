# Dewey Tabbed Sure Winner In Presidential Race Today
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Governor Thomas E. Dewey
seems a sure winner in today's
Presidential election. Harry
Truman will carry some of the
southern states and a few of
those north of the Mason-Dixon
Line, but the pivotal states. New
York, California, Pennsylvania, Il
linois, and Ohio, seem to be safely
in the Dewey column.
Governor Thurmond claims some
100 electoral votes, but will be
lucky to pick up the 38 of South
Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and
Louisiana.
Wallace Following Small
Though it appears Henry Wallace
will not carry any states, major at
tention will be paid both here and
abroad to the size of his popular
vote. The Wallace voters will be
out in rain or shine to vote for
their candidate: so that, a small vote
may show a large portion of the
popular vote being cast for the third
party.
Major interest in the election will
be centered on the tight races for
the seats in the United States Sen
ate. The control of this body will
rest on close races in 11 states.
These states include West Virginia,
Kentucky, Illinois, Colorado, New
Mexico, Wyoming, Minnesota, Okla
homa, Tennessee, Montana, and
lowa.
Senate Race Close
Republican incumbents in seven
of these states are faced with strong

Democratic opposition. In New-
Mexico the Democrats have put up
their strongest candidate in former
Secretary ot Agriculture Clinton
Anderson to oppose Pat Hurley, the
Republican who missed the other
seat from New Mexico by a narrow
margin in 1946.
Popular ex-Senator Gillette of
lowa has been picked to unseat Re
publican incumbent George Wilson.
In Oklahoma, former Governor Ken
is a sure winner for the seat va
cated by Republican Senator Moore.
Mayor Hubert Humphrey has been
given the nod over Senator Joe Ball
for the Senate in a hard-fought race
in that state. In Wyoming Gov
ernor Lester Hunt has an excel
lent chance of unseating Republi
can Senator Edward Robertson.
Neely Over Revercomb
Former governor, senator, and
congressman Neely of West Virginia
appeals to be a sure winner over
incumbent Republican Chap ma n
Revercomb. Republican Senators
Brooks of Illinois and Cooper ot
Kentucky also face tough contests
for their seats.
Democratic seats in Colorado,
Tennessee, New Mexico, and Mon
tana are in danger of being cap
tured by the Republicans. Senator

Murray of Montana is having the
toughest fight for his seat. Senator
Johnson of Colorado, minority Leader
of the military affairs committee, is
waging a successful battle lor his
seat.
Anderson Faces Opposition
In California only 11 congres
sional seats are being strongly con
tested. Nine Republicans, including
the Eighth District's Jack Anderson
are faced with nominal opposition
from third party candidates.
The outcome of nearly all these
races depends upon the proportions
of the Dewey-Warren victory.
Should it be a landslide, the Repub
licans are almost assured of carrying
their candidates on to victory, for
both the House and the Senate. A
close race may give the Senate to
the Democrats.
A forecast of clear skies for most
of the nation for today should in
crease the number of voters; how
ever, the campaign has not excited
great interest in those states lacking
senatorial contests. A small vote
in proportion to the number eligible
to cast ballots appears likely in
California, since there are not state
wide contests and most of the local
ones were decided in the primarie

their candidate: so that, a small vote
may show a large portion of the
popular vote being cast for the third
party.
Major interest in the election will
be centered on the tight races for
the seats in the United States Sen
ate. The control of this body will
rest on close races in 11 states.
These states include West Virginia,
Kentucky, Illinois, Colorado, New
Mexico, Wyoming, Minnesota, Okla
homa, Tennessee, Montana, and
lowa.
Senate Race Close
Republican incumbents in seven
of these states are faced with strong

Democratic opposition. In New-
Mexico the Democrats have put up
their strongest candidate in former
Secretary ot Agriculture Clinton
Anderson to oppose Pat Hurley, the
Republican who missed the other
seat from New Mexico by a narrow
margin in 1946.
Popular ex-Senator Gillette of
lowa has been picked to unseat Re
publican incumbent George Wilson.
In Oklahoma, former Governor Ken
is a sure winner for the seat va
cated by Republican Senator Moore.
Mayor Hubert Humphrey has been
given the nod over Senator Joe Ball
for the Senate in a hard-fought race
in that state. In Wyoming Gov
ernor Lester Hunt has an excel
lent chance of unseating Republi
can Senator Edward Robertson.
Neely Over Revercomb
Former governor, senator, and
congressman Neely of West Virginia
appeals to be a sure winner over
incumbent Republican Chap ma n
Revercomb. Republican Senators
Brooks of Illinois and Cooper ot
Kentucky also face tough contests
for their seats.
Democratic seats in Colorado,
Tennessee, New Mexico, and Mon
tana are in danger of being cap
tured by the Republicans. Senator

Murray of Montana is having the
toughest fight for his seat. Senator
Johnson of Colorado, minority Leader
of the military affairs committee, is
waging a successful battle lor his
seat.
Anderson Faces Opposition
In California only 11 congres
sional seats are being strongly con
tested. Nine Republicans, including
the Eighth District's Jack Anderson
are faced with nominal opposition
from third party candidates.
The outcome of nearly all these
races depends upon the proportions
of the Dewey-Warren victory.
Should it be a landslide, the Repub
licans are almost assured of carrying
their candidates on to victory, for
both the House and the Senate. A
close race may give the Senate to
the Democrats.
A forecast of clear skies for most
of the nation for today should in
crease the number of voters; how
ever, the campaign has not excited
great interest in those states lacking
senatorial contests. A small vote
in proportion to the number eligible
to cast ballots appears likely in
California, since there are not state
wide contests and most of the local
ones were decided in the primarie
Governor Thomas E. Dewey
seems a sure winner in today's
Presidential election. Harry
Truman will carry some of the
southern states and a few of
those north of the Mason-Dixon
Line, but the pivotal states. New
York, California, Pennsylvania, Il
linois, and Ohio, seem to be safely
in the Dewey column.
Governor Thurmond claims some
100 electoral votes, but will be
lucky to pick up the 38 of South
Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and
Louisiana.
Wallace Following Small
Though it appears Henry Wallace
will not carry any states, major at
tention will be paid both here and
abroad to the size of his popular
vote. The Wallace voters will be
out in rain or shine to vote for
their candidate: so that, a small vote
may show a large portion of the
popular vote being cast for the third
party.
