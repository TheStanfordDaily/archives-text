PARIS, Nov. 1 t/P).â€”Massed po
lice and army forces were prepar
ing tonight to take over the last
strongholds of the Communist-led
coal strikers in northern France.
The government is counting on a
back-to-work movement gathering
strength tomorrow among the na
tion's 335.000 miners. It claimed 87
per cent of the miners in Lorraine
were back on their jobs Saturday.
Police seized the Lorraine mines
more than three weeks ago, how
ever.
An All Saints' Day truce, tacitly
observed today by both the govern
ment and the General Confedera
tion of Labor (CGT), was broken
at Cransac, 60 miles northeast of
Toulouse.
Strikers took the Banel shaft
from the police and were reported
to have beaten a number of miners
at work there. Troops later freed
both the police and the workers.
At Carmaux, near Cransac, po
lice were being reinforced to pro
tect miners who plan to go back
to the pits tomorrow morning.
The government has been sus
pending Communist union chiefs i
from posts on the boards directing
nationalized industries. Latest to
go is Victorin Duguet, general sec
retary of the CGT miners.
