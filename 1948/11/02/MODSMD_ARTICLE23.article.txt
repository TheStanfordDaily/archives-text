# DAILY EDITORIALS
## We're for Dewey 
### 
Four years ago The Daily editor favored the re-election of
President Roosevelt, while the rest of the staff backed Dewey.
This year, the editor, and the majority of the staff, are behind
Thomas E. Dewey—as is the majority of the student body and
the nation in general.
Dewey is so clearly far ahead of the other candidates that he
doesn't need another editorial in his behalf. But we won't get
another chance for four years, so here goes.
Probably the best way to measure a candidate for the presi
dency is to determine what the President should be or should
not be. For example, Dewey's adversaries say that he isn't fit
for the job because he's controlled by Wall Street, that his elec
tion will mean a setback for the "common man."
We would be seriously worried about the charges if a Presi
dent really had that much control over the destiny of his people.
Actually nothing can—or has—stopped the slow evolution of
progress in our country. It is the will of the people. So, what
then is the President's job if it is not that of godfather to all
citizens?
The President's job is two-fold—to conduct the international
affairs of the nation in a manner that will bring credit to the
United States, and to keep harmony in internal affairs.
Dewey is big enough for the job. He is a capable adminis
trator, and he'll have expert advisers to help him. His foreign
policy will be conducted on a higher level and will be free of
the Truman bungles that have endangered our position in world
affairs. We'll see the long-needed return to diplomacy in our
international conduct.
Nationally there are indications that Dewey will travel a little
to the left, a surprise to some hidebound conservatives. Dewey
already has done a great deal with housing in New York. His
running mate's health program is well known.
Dewey gets our vote because he represents proper conduct
of the high office of the presidency and dependable progress
for the entire nation.
Regardless of your choice, vote today if you are eligible. And
vote again tomorrow in the student body elections. Remember
that many of last year's ASSU elections were decided by as few
as two votes. Your vote is always important.

Thomas E. Dewey—as is the majority of the student body and
the nation in general.
Dewey is so clearly far ahead of the other candidates that he
doesn't need another editorial in his behalf. But we won't get
another chance for four years, so here goes.
Probably the best way to measure a candidate for the presi
dency is to determine what the President should be or should
not be. For example, Dewey's adversaries say that he isn't fit
for the job because he's controlled by Wall Street, that his elec
tion will mean a setback for the "common man."
We would be seriously worried about the charges if a Presi
dent really had that much control over the destiny of his people.
Actually nothing can—or has—stopped the slow evolution of
progress in our country. It is the will of the people. So, what
then is the President's job if it is not that of godfather to all
citizens?
The President's job is two-fold—to conduct the international
affairs of the nation in a manner that will bring credit to the
United States, and to keep harmony in internal affairs.
Dewey is big enough for the job. He is a capable adminis
trator, and he'll have expert advisers to help him. His foreign
policy will be conducted on a higher level and will be free of
the Truman bungles that have endangered our position in world
affairs. We'll see the long-needed return to diplomacy in our
international conduct.
Nationally there are indications that Dewey will travel a little
to the left, a surprise to some hidebound conservatives. Dewey
already has done a great deal with housing in New York. His
running mate's health program is well known.
Dewey gets our vote because he represents proper conduct
of the high office of the presidency and dependable progress
for the entire nation.
Regardless of your choice, vote today if you are eligible. And
vote again tomorrow in the student body elections. Remember
that many of last year's ASSU elections were decided by as few
as two votes. Your vote is always important.
