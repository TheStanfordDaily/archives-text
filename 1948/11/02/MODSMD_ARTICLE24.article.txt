## Proposition 14 
### 
To the Editor:
The innocent voters of California are menaced by a Communistic plot.
The radio and press, in advertisements prodigally paid for by the real
estate interests, are sounding the alarm against Proposition No. 14. Of
course, the chairman of the committee supporting Proposition No. 14 is
a Catholic priest, Monsignor O'Dwyer, but a bill that would facilitate the
building of low-rent homes for 100,000 self-supporting but wretchedly
housed California families must be Communistic, as any fool can plainly
see.
It is also said that the cost of this program will wreck the economy of
the state. Opponents of No. 14, by maximizing every possible cost factor
and counting the housing loan as an outright gift, estimate that the pro
gram will cost one and one-third billion dollars if the program is ex
tended for 50 years (which will not happen unless it is a success). But
this is less than $27,000,000 per year; is that too much to spend on housing
in a state as populous as California? Balance aganist this the gain to so
ciety resulting from reduction of slum areasâ€”each of which is an economic,
social and political ulcer on the community, generating disease, crime, and
sedition.
Doubtless, certain details of Proposition No. 14 are open to criticism;
some imperfections are found even in the laws enacted by our $100-a
-month legislature. Nevertheless, the choice is between this housing bill
and no housing bill; the opponents of No. 14 are offering no constructive
alternative, and can be relied on to attack any other housing measure with
equal savagery.
