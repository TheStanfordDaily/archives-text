BULL SESSION RECOMMENDS:
PROPOSITION I:3o—This meas
ure is designed to protect all Stan
ford girls from listening to any
propositions in the cactus gardens
after 1:30. Vote "No."
PROPOSITION 2 — "Stop that
feather-bedding." This is an effort
by the railroads to do away with
feather-beds in their trains. In the
future all trains will be equipped
with second-hand beds purchased
from Encina Hall. Vote "No."
PROPOSITION 3—Relief for the
aged and the blind. From now on,
the aged and the blind will be given
full-time jobs instead of relief pay
ments. They will be put to work

Coast Conference. The oldest per
son found will receive an orchid
from the radio program, "Breakfast
in Milpitas," and will also be head
referee at the Rose Bowl game.
Vote "Yes."
PROPOSITION 4—Residence re
quirement. If this issue is passed,
it will mean that no one will be
allowed to vote in California elec
tions unless he has lived in the
state of Oklahoma for at least five
years. Vote "Yes" on this here 'un.
PROPOSITION 5 —Senate reap
portionment. This one will revo-

lutionize the sys
tem for appor
tionment of state
senators. In the
future, the num
ber of senators
appointed for
each county will
depend on the
number of full
blooded Angora
kittens in the
county. This is

designed to keep the state from go
ing to the dogs. Vote "Yes."
PROPOSITION 6 — Veterans'
housing. Backers of this plan claim
that passage of the bill will mean
that, in no time at all, veterans will
still be living in auto camps. At
present, many veterans are without
houses. Under this measure veter
ans will be with outhouses. Vote
"No."
PROPOSITION 7 — Salary in
creases. This is a proposition to in
crease the salaries of the state gar
bage men. At present, they are paid
$250 a month. Under the new law,
garbage men will be paid $250 a
month and all they can eat. Vote
"Yes."
PROPOSITION 8 — New clothing
for the Board of Equalization men.
Under this proposition all "B. of E."
men will get out of those shoddy
overcoats and hats they have worn
in the past. From now on, they will
be clad in natty plaid suits, with
"Board of Equalization" woven into
the design. These suits are chemi
cally treated so they automatically
glow in the dark when any minor
in the vicinity lifts a drink to his
mouth. Vote "No."
PROPOSITION 9—State employ
ment. This bill is placed before the
voters to give them a chance to
keep state senators from hiring
their campaign promoters as secre
taries and assistants. Under its pro
visions, the solons may give em
ployment only to blood relatives
and fraternity brothers. Vote "No."
