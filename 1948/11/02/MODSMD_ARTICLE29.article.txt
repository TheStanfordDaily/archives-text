BRUNN

PROPOSITION No. I—VETERANS' TAX EXEMPTIONS
This is not intended to create any new exemptions, but to establish a
uniform state-wide rule for administering the present laws.

Vote YES

Vote YES

PROPOSITION No. 2—LOCAL CONTROL OF LIQUOR

This was put on the ballot to con
fuse the issue presented by Prop.
12. Prop. 2 has no good points, but
it might supersede Prop. 12 if both
pass.

Its provisions would forbid unes
corted women to sit at bars amJ
reduce the number of liquor li
censes. This is an example of Vic
torian thinking.

Vote YES

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. 3—RAILROAD BRAKEMEN

The number of brakemen required
on trains is at present fixed by law.
More must be carried and paid than
are nedeed. This measure author
izes the Public Utilities Commis
sion to fix the number required
for safe operation.

The Legislature twice rejected Sud
an amendment after full hearings
Arguments are in sharp conflict a;
to whether the existing law i
necessary for safety.

Vote YES

No recommendation

PROPOSITION No. 4—AGED AND BLIND All)
While the aged and blind might deserve more assistance, this propostioi
is another "Long Beach special," writing increased benefits into the Con
stitution, making the Director of Social Welfare an elective officer, ant
writing in the names of the measure's promoters for the director's jol
until election.

Vote NO

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. S—COMPENSATION OF LEGISLATORS

Present salary of the Legislature is
fixed in the Constitution at $100
per month. This authorizes them
to fix their own salaries. You can't
get good men if you don't pay
them.

No employee can dictate his owi
salary, so why should the solons'
While they may deserve mor>
money, the present figure cai
easily be raised.

Vote YES

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. 7—RESIDENCE OF VOTERS

Requires residence in the precinct
of 54 days instead of the present
40. The extension is for technical
reasons —to give election officials
more time to prepare voting lists,
etc.

Increases required number of da\
for voting eligibility. Undesirabl
as taking away 14 days of registra
tion time, thus making voting moi
difficult.

Vote YES

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. 10—INITIATIVE

Requires that initiatives relate to
but one subject. The initiative has
been so abused in California that
I frankly favor almost any restric
tions on it.

The initiative is valuable at- givin
the people a direct voice in th
government. This power shoul
not be reduced, even if we mus
put up with some confusioi
Furthermore, legal arguments a
to what is "one subject" woul
just add to the confusion.

Vote YES

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. 12—LOCAL CONTROL OF LIQUOR

Provides for control of licenses by
local authorities; specifically au
thorizes "local option," that is,
complete local prohibition. Even
if it only allowed local regulation,
I doubt that local governments
would show themselves any more
honest or efficient than the B. of E.
(which is bad enough). And all
prohibition gets you is worse
liquor at higher prices.

Gives each city and county powe
to forbid sale of liquor. A bare
faced attempt to sneak in prohibi
tion. Speakeasies have atmosphere
but bathtub gin is rough on th
stomach.

Vote NO

Vote NO

PROPOSITION No. 13—SENATE RE-APPORTIONMENT

Under this plan, California's metro
politan areas would control the
State Senate. Considering the
economic importance of the rural
counties, the conflicting interests
of the different parts of the state,
and the traditional theory of
"checks and balances," I think it
justifiable to give the "cow coun
ties" a measure of over-repre
sentation.

Provides that Senate represcntatioi
shall be in proportion to popula
tion, but no county shall ha\<
more than 10 senators. Uncle
present law, representation i
grossly unfair. 11,000 people ii
Inyo-Mono counties have om
senator; 3V'2 million people in Lo
Angeles also have one. This pro
posal, already followed by 3;
states, would give more adequati
representation without removinj
safeguards against over-control bi
the cities.

Vote NO

Vote YES

PROPOSITION No. 14—HOUSING

Provides for a 10-year, $350,000,000
program of subsidies for local pub
lic housing projects and loans to
non-profit housing associations.
The measure leaves a lot to the
discretion of the five-man agency;
however, we have a housing prob
lem and this looks like the only
immediate help available.

As Henry Morgan once said, "Tin
housing shortage is just a viciou.'
rumor spread by a few millior
homeless people." This would alle
viate it by building a hundrec
thousand low-cost homes. Hea
estate and building interests attach
this as radical, yet a number <•
states, including New York undci
Governor Dewey, have adoptee
similar measures.

Vote YES

Vote YES

PROPOSITION No. IB—CHIROPRACTORS
Increases educational requirements for chiropractors, and increa.-<
regulatory powers of State Board. If we must have chiropractors, it i:
ji'st as well that they have as much scientific training as possible.

Vote YES

Vote YES

PROPOSITION No. 18—STATE PAYMENT TAX
EXEMPTION LOSSES
Requires state to reimburse local governments for losses they sulT<
by reason of veterans' and other tax exemptions. The burden of th<
exemptions falls directly on local government, most of whose incomc
derived from property taxes (and most of which are hard-pressed 1
money right now). The state has greater tax resources, and the broad<
the tax base, the less painful the tax.
