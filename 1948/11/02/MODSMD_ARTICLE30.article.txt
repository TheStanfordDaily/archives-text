# Students' GOP Preference Is Consistent With Past Polls
## 
### MEL HOFFMAN 
Stanford students, favoring Thom
as E. Dewey by a 67.7 per cent vote
in a survey taken by The Daily,
followed a consistent pattern of Re
publican victories in Daily straw
balloting.
Only in 1912 did a Democrat win
a mock election here, when Wood
row Wilson received a plurality as
Taft and Theodore Roosevelt split
the Republican vote.
Not Unusual
The result is not surprising, since
the Republican party draws much
of its support from the upper in
come group, and big business, which
is well represented at Stanford.
The Stanford faculty, on the oth
er hand, has favored the Democratic
candidate fairly consistently since
1920, when they gave Cox a three
to one vote over Harding.
They turned Republican in 1928,
favoring Hoover by an 81 per cent
vote, and continued to sup;joi him
in 1932. In 1936 they voted Demo

i cratie, Roosevelt getting 47 per
( cent, Landon 39 per cent, and Nor
man Thomas 11 per cent.
1920 Vote
Since 1920 the student vote has
held strongly to the Republican
line. Fraternity and sorority opin
ion was almost unanimous for Cool
idge in 1924, Coolidge receiving all
but two votes from the sororities
and one from the fraternities.
In 1928 Hoover swept the cam
pus by a three to one lead over
Gov. Alfred E. Smith. In 1932 Stan
ford was still strong for Hoover, but
by the smaller margin of three to
two.
'32 Survey
A college survey in 1932 showed
that Hoover was satisfactory to a
plurality of American university
students. Straw votes taken at 34
representative colleges in the coun
try gave Hoover 49 per cent, Roo
sevelt 31 per cent, and Thomas 18
per cent.

Students gave Lanclon HI per cent
of their vote in 193G. Willkie polled
three votes to Roosevelt's one in
1940, and Dewey defeated Roose
velt by a two to one vote in a 1944
mock election.
Ballots Invalid
The election committee declared
200 Communist ballots invalid in
1936 after a checkup showed 200
more ballots cast than persons vot
ing, the discrepancy being discov
ered when the committee ran out of
ballots at noon. The Communist
ballots were "obviously" marked
with the same pen, the committee
determined.
A plan at the 1924 mock election
to have students sign their ballots
was changed at the last minute. In
stead the ballots read "Vote! Once!
This straw vote is being conducted
under the honor system due to a
late change in plans." In 1928. how
ever, the Bawlout was used to check
names to avoid duplicate voting.
