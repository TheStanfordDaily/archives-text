# Unbeaten Frosh Prep for Cal
## 
### 
With a steady drizzle dampening
their jerseys but not their spirits,
Chuck Taylor's frosh gridders xan
through the first afternoon of their
last week of practice drill yesterday
in preparation for next Saturday's
LiUle Big Game.
Last Saturday saw the undefeat
ed yearlings v/ax a vaunted Menlo
JC ballclub, 27-6, to take their
fourth straight of the season. The
lopsided score, however, was trace
able in part directly to the whims
of Lady Luck, and the Cards can't
expect to count on her help again
next week.
In the words of Taylor, "The team
will have to play a great deal belter
than they did against Menlo to win
from the Berkeley freshmen." The
wee bears have only a tie with St.
Mary's to mar their slate, having

scored victories over UCLA and SC
just as have the Indians.
It was halfback Harry Hugasian
who won the laurels Saturday with
his spectacular ballpacking. Huga
sian scored two touchdowns and
set up another Saturday in the
course of his activities, and played
well defensively to boot.
In Bill McColl, Bill Storum, Wil
bur Taylor, and Jack Rye, Taylor
has a brace of the finest frosh ends
on the coast. McColl should make
anybody's varsity next year; Sto
rum is a fine receiver; Taylor com
pletely discourages the opposition
from running his end; and Rye has
shown such improvement the past
few weeks that he now rivals the
others in all departments.
