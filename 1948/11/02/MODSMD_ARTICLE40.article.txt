# Mural Handbook Clears Up Rules
## 
### 
This year's intramural program
has been decidedly improved by the
publication of a clear set of rules
governing all intramural athletics.
The lack of such rules last year
resulted in argument and confusion
over the simplest of questions.
Intramural director Chuck Tay
lor remedied this bewildering situ
ation by drawing up an intramural
handbook. This handy little guide
covers every possible question that
might arise from eligibility to what
kind of shoes are allowed for touch
football games.
One major change is the barring
from intramurals of all varsity and
freshman squad members in any
major sport during the time they
ate squad members. This rule was
introduced because of some costly
injuries to last year's track squad
as a result of intramurals.
Another change, and one which is
hailed by freshmen, is the revision
of the various leagues. Under the
present set - up, the frosh teams
from Encina compete against each
other in a league of their own and
only meet teams from other leagues
in the playoffs for the campus
championship.
With the publication of these
rules Chuck Taylor hopes to restore
Stanford intramurals to their fa
mous pre-war status.
