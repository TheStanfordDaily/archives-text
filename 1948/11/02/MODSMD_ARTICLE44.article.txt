Dammit men, the California Bear can be had. It won't be an easy job.
ut it's certainly not impossible. Far from it. The Golden Bear became
ightly tarnished for the first time last Saturday, and come Nov. 20,
tanford's spirited Redshirts could stage a polishing party.
Heretofore, opposing forces and all concerned have considered Jensen
niversitj as being invincible. But as Troy proved in the Coliseum, just
sn't true. The Berkeley boys are human. And that puts 'em on a par
ith everyone else around these parts.
Overcome by an unexplainable compulsion to see this 1948 edition of
e Waldorf Salad before the Big Game, I disguised myself in Bear
othi ng over the weekend and sneaked into the L.A. Memorial Coliseum
see just what made the Golden Bear so good. I liked what I saw.
Mvslic Powers Go Blooey
Sure, Jackie Jensen is a football player. And the Bears have depth,
-it if it hadn't been for a lot of luck ar>d some helpful Mystic Powers,
SC would have bashed the Bear where it hurts.
As it was, the Trojans blew four chances inside the Cal 15. which
rned about would have produced a completely different story. Troy
is the first Cal opponent that wasn't scared to death by the Grizzly's
putation. Therein lies the story. To fear an enemy is disastrous.
Just before the first half ended in the Coliseum, SC's Art Battle almost
ve the Troys their tying touchdown. He took a reverse from Don Doll
d scampered 30 yards around his own left end to the Cal 1, but the
ay was called back because of offsides. That play alone could have put
•>C into a position where the Trojans could have gone on to win the game.
Nut to be denied, USC continued to threaten during the second half, but
erv time Troy would get dangerously close, Jim Powers would play
t potato with the football, and the Trojans would have to start all over
ain after Cal had kicked out,
Statistics Aren't Valuable
The statistics say that Cal had all its own way on the ground, but most
those figures were built up during the opening minutes of play. SC
•med to catch fire as the game progressed, and by the third quarter.
■ Figueroa backs were cutting even chunks out of the Cal line as they
ttinuously marched down the field.
3on Doll and Jack Kirby cut through the supposedly superb Bear line
• consistent yardage. And none of the other Trojan ball-carriers seemed
> much impressed with the Blue and Gold forward wall.
JSC had just as much trouble with Stanford's line. All of which goes
?k to the original idea. California can be beaten. And more to the
nt, Stanford can beat them.
Che Army Mule might take a little sting out of that idea, but no
tter what happens in Yankee Stadium next Saturday, by the time we
Ik into Strawberry Canyon on Nov. 20, Stanford will be ready, willing,
1 most important, ABLE, to blow the scent of roses right out of the
ir's nostrils.
The Big Fight
ust a word about the two promising heavyweights squaring off against
h other today. The defending uhamp. Handy Pijarry Truman, will
'bably go down in the fifth round from a barage of body and head blows
the able challenger, Dynamite Dewey, the popular favorite.
