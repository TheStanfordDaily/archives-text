# Bendix Washers, Dryers on Campus Mean Washday Blues on Way Out
## 
### 
Stanford's washday blues are on
their way out with the installation
of Bendix washers and dryers
throughout the campus. The wash
ing facilities are being installed in
University residences recommend
ed by a special student committee.
All such living groups on campus
may now have the same advantages
that Village residents have had for
some time. The washing and drying
process costs 10 cents, which is be
low current rates at other launder
ettes in the area.
The Bendixes are being installed
by the Pacific Telecoin Corporation
and the Montesalve Company. When
all are installed there will be four
washers in Encina, two each in
Toyon, Union residence, Madrono,
Manzanita, Lagunita, Roble, and
Branner, three located at strategic
positions on women's Row, and one
each at Crothers Hall and Casa
Ventura. Lagunita may get two
more washers.
Each washer features a dryer ex
cept at Lagunita, Roble, and Bran
ner, where drying facilities are al
ready present.
University officials have request
ed that students use the dryers in
stead of hanging their wash out of
windows and using makeshift lines.
The University is supplying the

wiring, heat, and water on a con
tract basis with the two companies,
according to Alf Brandin, business
manager. Mr. Brandin said that the
machines will be operated tor a
time on a trial basis to see if there
is enough demand for them.
The shortage of wiring equipment
ha»- held up the installations at
Toyon, Encina, and some of the
other halls.
