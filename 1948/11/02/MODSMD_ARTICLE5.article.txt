# Political Debate Shifts Opinions
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Campaign oratory reigned su
preme last night as three two-man
teams representing the Progressive,
Democratic, and Republican parties
debated in Cubberley Auditorium
before a sparse audience of 145.
An audience shift-of-opinion bal
lot was taken after the contest. Out
of 145 ballots counted, 17 persons
shifted in favor of the Wallaceites,
and seven to the Democrats. The
Republicans came out with one less
vote than they had received before
the debate.
This indicates that 120 persons
either did not change their opin
ions or were undecided after hear
ing the speakers.
Republican Team
Jack Marcum, debate captain of
the Stanford Debating Society,
opened for the Republicans with a
definition of what the American
President must be. He stressed
Dewey's progressive and efficient
record to support his arguments.
Both he and his teammate, M. E.
Harrison, former House of Repre
sentatives page, supported the rec
ord of the 80th Congress, and in
| sisted that teamwork between Con
j gress and Governor Dewey would
j highlight a Republican administra
i tion.
Democrats
John Hines, debate manager of
j the society, and George Veliiotes
' tok up the Democratic banner with
| statements that Truman gave the
I "do nothing" Congress plenty of

legislation. Hines singled out
Grundy of Pennsylvania as repre
sentative of the Republican polio
of high tariffs and low taxes for
the wealthy.
Progressives
Progressives Tom Lupher and
Ernie Schmidt set a more serious
note to the debate. The latter out
lined his reasons for abandoning
both the Democratic and Republi
can parties. He pointed out that
the Democrats, under Roosevelt a
closely knit alliance, had become
disunited under Truman.
Lupher ended both the construc
tive speeches and rebuttals, empha
sizing his party's unity and its plat
form of peace and prosperity.
