# Operations of Football Pools Revealed on Stanford Campus
## 
### 
Organized football betting
systems are flourishing on the
Stanford campus today, netting
hundreds of dollars each week
from students.
The football "pools" are
similar to those which have been
uncovered at Duke University and,
more recently, the University of
Michigan. The pools are connected
with national betting networks and
have outlets located on campus.
Middle Men
Two campus middle men operate
from the campus, while another
lives in the Village. The betting is
operated through agents located in
the various houses and dormitories.
Each week, the agents distribute
$1 tickets upon which the student
marks his bet. The tickets pay four
to one on three correct guesses, and
give various odds or points on a
scale up to 10 correct guesses. One
syndicate pays 101 "points" for 10
correct guesses. The other pays 125
to 1 odds. "Odds" and "points" are
translated into dollars at the payoff.
o"ne syndicate goes under the tag
of "Pacific Coast," while the other
is called "Big Nine Pigskin Parade."
Both bear the weak coverup that the

tickets are to be used as a source
of news information only.
Bettor Loses
The Pacific Coast ticket wins on
all ties, adding to an already well
filled purse. The other calls for all
ties to be scratched. In either case,
the bettor loses either part or all of
his wager. When Pacific Coast fa
vored Michigan over Minnesota by

Dean of Students Lawrence
Kimpton and Tom Diamond,
chairman of Men's Council, told
The Daily today that they have
been aware of the situation and
will take appropriate action where
necessary.

13 points, and Michigan won, 27 to
14, all students who bet on the game,
among several contests, lost their
whole ticket.
When the bets are in, the middle
man takes the wagers to the regional
office in San Francisco, where the
bets and the tickets are recorded to
prevent any double-dealing on the
part of the agent.
The only advantage the bettor has
is the fact that the odds may change
between the time the tickets arc
printed and the deadline for the
tickets to be in.

The middle man and his agents
are guaranteed a fixed cut, about 20
per cent in most syndicates. The
state outlet takes 40 per cent and
the balance, 40 per cent, goes to
the national office.
All payoffs are from the national
office, so that the cuts of the agents
are not affected.
Football pools are not new on
campus. Last year, a group of stu
dents formed their own network,
which was reported to have folded
after a disastrous Saturday near the
end of the season. This was the con
sequence of the lack of national
backing.
Try To Hold Monopoly
At present, the syndicate agents
are hoping to hold the monopoly.
Any more pools cutting in on the
racket would diminish the large
profits they fear.
Betting experts agree that the
chances of winning are pretty slim
because of upsets and the fact that
ties either take all or are scratched.
Nevertheless, the pools are popular
with the amateur student, who hones
up Friday morning on the sports
writers' predictions and then estab
lishes his own series of conclusions.
Because one mistake forfeits the
whole ticket, he usually loses.

The middle man and his agents
are guaranteed a fixed cut, about 20
per cent in most syndicates. The
state outlet takes 40 per cent and
the balance, 40 per cent, goes to

All payoffs are from the national

Football pools are not new on
campus. Last year, a group of stu
dents formed their own network,
which was reported to have folded
after a disastrous Saturday near the
end of the season. This was the con
sequence of the lack of national
backing.
Try To Hold Monopoly
At present, the syndicate agents
are hoping to hold the monopoly.
Any more pools cutting in on the
racket would diminish the large
profits they fear.
Betting experts agree that the
chances of winning are pretty slim
because of upsets and the fact that
ties either take all or are scratched.
Nevertheless, the pools are popular
with the amateur student, who hones
up Friday morning on the sports
writers' predictions and then estab

Because one mistake forfeits the
whole ticket, he usually loses.
Organized football betting
systems are flourishing on the
Stanford campus today, netting

from students.
The football "pools" are

Middle Men
Two campus middle men operate
from the campus, while another
lives in the Village. The betting is
operated through agents located in
the various houses and dormitories.
Each week, the agents distribute
$1 tickets upon which the student
marks his bet. The tickets pay four
to one on three correct guesses, and
give various odds or points on a
scale up to 10 correct guesses. One
syndicate pays 101 "points" for 10
correct guesses. The other pays 125
to 1 odds. "Odds" and "points" are
translated into dollars at the payoff.

of "Pacific Coast," while the other
is called "Big Nine Pigskin Parade."

tickets are to be used as a source

The Pacific Coast ticket wins on

filled purse. The other calls for all
