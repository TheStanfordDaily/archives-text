THE SPACE
Verses From a Literate Journalist's
Notebook
Iss gifting mit der hunger pangs
Is to my friends I'm trotting.
They're telling me that I should

They won't feed me for netting.
And so, alas, there's nothing leff
To the walls is being my back
I guess I'll have to bribe the chef
At LONGBARN or at Dinah's
Shack.
—-Bill Dailey
