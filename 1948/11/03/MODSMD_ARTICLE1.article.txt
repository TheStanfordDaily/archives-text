# TRUMAN LEADS
## Presidency, House Still Undecided 
### Associated Press 
President Harry S. Truman,
the man who wouldn't say die
led Governor Thomas E. Dewey
today in one of the most as
tounding Presidential elections
of U.S. history.
The contest was far from over,
but the man from Missouri whom
the pollsters marked off as licked
months ago, clung doggedly to a
majority of the electoral votes.
At 2 a.m. (PDT) Mr. Truman was
leading in states with 293 electoral
votes, whereas Dewey was ahead in
states with 201. Needed for elec
tion: 266.
And the President's margin over
Dewey in the popular tally was
1,131.000 with some 28,000,000 of ar.
expected 50,000.000 or more ballot
tabulated.

Presidential results at 3:15 a.m.
(PDT) gave President Truman a
popular vote lead of 769.000, and ar
electoral vote total of 282. Dewey's
electoral vote stood at 211.

Amazingly, the Democrats swept
into position to control both Sen
ate and House of the 81st Congress
—provided they suffer no upsets in
the tabulations yet to come. And
at this point, the trend was for, not
against, the Administration party.
Neither the Presidential struggle
nor the Congressional fight had
been finally decided, but the
mounting flod of the ballots had cast
up enough surprises to keep the
tongues of the experts wagging for
months, if not years.
As expected, Dewey captured the
massive electoral tallies of New
York and Pennsylvania, but as was
distinctly not expected, Truman
rolled into the lead in such states
as Ohio, Massachusetts, and Wis
consin.
Whereas Dewey's electoral total
was built, by and large, on the votes
of great, populous states. Truman
swept into his column, at least ten
tatively, a lot of little and medium
sized ones.
The Presidential race looked like
the closest since the 277 to 254 Wil
son-Hughes struggle of 1916 — and
the possibility even arose that no
one would get a majority of the
electoral tally.
In that case, the showdown would
come in the next House of Repre
sentatives, with each state casting
one vote to choose the President.
