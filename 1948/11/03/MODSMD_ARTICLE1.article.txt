# TRUMAN LEADS
## Presidency, House Still Undecided 
### Associated Press 
President Harry S. Truman,
the man who wouldn't say die
led Governor Thomas E. Dewey
today in one of the most as
tounding Presidential elections
of U.S. history.
The contest was far from over,
but the man from Missouri whom
the pollsters marked off as licked
months ago, clung doggedly to a
majority of the electoral votes.
At 2 a.m. (PDT) Mr. Truman was
leading in states with 293 electoral
votes, whereas Dewey was ahead in
states with 201. Needed for elec
tion: 266.
And the President's margin over
Dewey in the popular tally was
1,131.000 with some 28,000,000 of ar.
expected 50,000.000 or more ballot
tabulated.

Presidential results at 3:15 a.m.
(PDT) gave President Truman a
popular vote lead of 769.000, and ar
electoral vote total of 282. Dewey's
electoral vote stood at 211.

Amazingly, the Democrats swept
into position to control both Sen
ate and House of the 81st Congress
—provided they suffer no upsets in
the tabulations yet to come. And
at this point, the trend was for, not
against, the Administration party.
Neither the Presidential struggle
nor the Congressional fight had
been finally decided, but the
mounting flod of the ballots had cast
up enough surprises to keep the
tongues of the experts wagging for
months, if not years.
As expected, Dewey captured the
massive electoral tallies of New
York and Pennsylvania, but as was
distinctly not expected, Truman
rolled into the lead in such states
as Ohio, Massachusetts, and Wis
consin.
Whereas Dewey's electoral total
was built, by and large, on the votes
of great, populous states. Truman
swept into his column, at least ten
tatively, a lot of little and medium
sized ones.
The Presidential race looked like
the closest since the 277 to 254 Wil
son-Hughes struggle of 1916 — and
the possibility even arose that no
one would get a majority of the
electoral tally.
In that case, the showdown would
come in the next House of Repre
sentatives, with each state casting
one vote to choose the President.
The anti-Truman votes in four
normal!" states (Loui


s.iana, Mississippi. South Carolina,
and Alabama) might have historic
results. Should neither Truman
nor Dewey get a majority of elec
toral votes (266), the choice of the
President would be up to a vote of
the House of Representatives —
where each state would have one
vote.
In such an event, States' Rights
Candidate Thurmond hoped to hold
the balance of power. The States'
Rights movement was born of pro
test against Truman's civil rights
program.
Democrats e'ected three Sena
tors out of the 11 Senate races re
garded as critical in the battle to
control the Senate and its chair
manships. The Democrats were
eadipe, too. in the other eight.
In the races for Governor, Demo
crats elected nine and were leading
jn 12. Republicans had elected three
«nd were leading in two.
Headlines crediting the President
with unexpected strength gave a
measure of support to his own pre
dictions that the poll takers would
have red faces after the returns
were all in.
The Democratic and Republican
high commands traded claims of
capturing around 300 electoral

votes. Needed to win: 2G6.
By midnight, some returns were
Jn from all 48 states. A few were
conclusive. Most were not.
These were some of the signifi
cant developments that figured in
the counting:
Truman at midnight led in In
diana, lowa, and Wisconsin—states
that went to Dewey in 1944. He
wasn't far behind in Ohio, Wyo
ming, South Dakota, Kansas, and
Colorado — more of Dewey's 1944
collection.
Democrat Robert Kerr walked of!
with an Oklahoma Senate seat that
has been Republican.
Hubert Humphrey, Democratic
mayor of Minneapolis, ran up a two
to one edge over Joseph H. Ball,
the Republican Senator whose job
he was after.
The Dallas News, backing Dewey,
conceded that Truman had carried
Texas.
Virginia upset some advance pre
dictions by moving safely into the
Truman column.
Maine, to nobody's surprise, was
a Dewey prize. The Democratic
state chairman gave up there.
The key states of New Jersey,
California, and Pennsylvania were
close. The lead teetered back and
forth, but Dewey was out ahead
most of the time.
The Providence Journal said a
Democratic sweep of Rhode Island
was apparent in early returns.
The President picked up a com
fortable lead in his home state of
Missouri.
In gubernatorial races, the Dem
ocrats and Republicans elected two
men apiece without any upsets.
And in other contests the Demo
crats were ahead in 16 and the Re-

I publicans in 10, with 3 states unre
' ported.
In the House, the Democrats
hung up a net gain of 10 seats. They
picked up 10 Republican and one
American Laborite seats and lost
; one of their own.

The Providence Journal said a
Democratic sweep of Rhode Island
was apparent in early returns.
The President picked up a com
fortable lead in his home state of
Missouri.
In gubernatorial races, the Dem
ocrats and Republicans elected two
men apiece without any upsets.
And in other contests the Demo
crats were ahead in 16 and the Re-

I publicans in 10, with 3 states unre
' ported.
In the House, the Democrats
hung up a net gain of 10 seats. They
picked up 10 Republican and one

President Harry S. Truman,
the man who wouldn't say die
led Governor Thomas E. Dewey
today in one of the most as
tounding Presidential elections
of U.S. history.
The contest was far from over,
but the man from Missouri whom
the pollsters marked off as licked
months ago, clung doggedly to a
majority of the electoral votes.
At 2 a.m. (PDT) Mr. Truman was
leading in states with 293 electoral
votes, whereas Dewey was ahead in
states with 201. Needed for elec
tion: 266.
And the President's margin over
Dewey in the popular tally was
1,131.000 with some 28,000,000 of ar.
expected 50,000.000 or more ballot
tabulated.

Presidential results at 3:15 a.m.
(PDT) gave President Truman a
popular vote lead of 769.000, and ar
electoral vote total of 282. Dewey's
electoral vote stood at 211.

Amazingly, the Democrats swept
into position to control both Sen
ate and House of the 81st Congress
—provided they suffer no upsets in
the tabulations yet to come. And
at this point, the trend was for, not
against, the Administration party.
Neither the Presidential struggle
nor the Congressional fight had
been finally decided, but the
mounting flod of the ballots had cast
up enough surprises to keep the
tongues of the experts wagging for
months, if not years.
As expected, Dewey captured the
massive electoral tallies of New
York and Pennsylvania, but as was
distinctly not expected, Truman
rolled into the lead in such states
as Ohio, Massachusetts, and Wis
consin.
Whereas Dewey's electoral total
was built, by and large, on the votes
of great, populous states. Truman
swept into his column, at least ten
tatively, a lot of little and medium
sized ones.
The Presidential race looked like
the closest since the 277 to 254 Wil
son-Hughes struggle of 1916 — and
the possibility even arose that no
one would get a majority of the
electoral tally.
In that case, the showdown would
come in the next House of Repre
sentatives, with each state casting
one vote to choose the President.
The anti-Truman votes in four
normal!" states (Loui


s.iana, Mississippi. South Carolina,
and Alabama) might have historic
results. Should neither Truman
nor Dewey get a majority of elec
toral votes (266), the choice of the
President would be up to a vote of
the House of Representatives —
where each state would have one
vote.
In such an event, States' Rights
Candidate Thurmond hoped to hold
the balance of power. The States'
Rights movement was born of pro

program.
Democrats e'ected three Sena

In the races for Governor, Demo
crats elected nine and were leading
jn 12. Republicans had elected three
«nd were leading in two.
Headlines crediting the President
with unexpected strength gave a
measure of support to his own pre
dictions that the poll takers would
have red faces after the returns
were all in.
The Democratic and Republican
high commands traded claims of
capturing around 300 electoral

votes. Needed to win: 2G6.
By midnight, some returns were
Jn from all 48 states. A few were
conclusive. Most were not.
These were some of the signifi
cant developments that figured in
the counting:
Truman at midnight led in In
diana, lowa, and Wisconsin—states
that went to Dewey in 1944. He
wasn't far behind in Ohio, Wyo
ming, South Dakota, Kansas, and
Colorado — more of Dewey's 1944
collection.
Democrat Robert Kerr walked of!
with an Oklahoma Senate seat that

Hubert Humphrey, Democratic
mayor of Minneapolis, ran up a two

he was after.
The Dallas News, backing Dewey,
conceded that Truman had carried
Texas.
Virginia upset some advance pre
dictions by moving safely into the
Truman column.
Maine, to nobody's surprise, was
a Dewey prize. The Democratic
state chairman gave up there.
The key states of New Jersey,
California, and Pennsylvania were

President Harry S. Truman,
the man who wouldn't say die
led Governor Thomas E. Dewey
today in one of the most as

tabulated.

Presidential results at 3:15 a.m.
(PDT) gave President Truman a
popular vote lead of 769.000, and ar
electoral vote total of 282. Dewey's
electoral vote stood at 211.

Amazingly, the Democrats swept
into position to control both Sen
ate and House of the 81st Congress
—provided they suffer no upsets in
the tabulations yet to come. And
at this point, the trend was for, not
against, the Administration party.

The Presidential race looked like
the closest since the 277 to 254 Wil
son-Hughes struggle of 1916 — and
the possibility even arose that no
one would get a majority of the
electoral tally.
In that case, the showdown would
come in the next House of Repre

one vote to choose the President.

President would be up to a vote of
the House of Representatives —
where each state would have one
vote.

The Democratic and Republican
high commands traded claims of

votes. Needed to win: 2G6.

Truman at midnight led in In
