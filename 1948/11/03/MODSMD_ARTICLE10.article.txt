# Big Game Float Themes Must Be Signed Up Now
## 
### 
Deadline for sign-ups of Big
Game float ideas by the various liv
ing groups is next Wednesday, said
Mimi Dunlap, float co-chairman.
Sign-ups stalled yesterday in the
ASSU office.
'l'heme of the Float Parade, which
wil! be held Nov. 19, is "Stanford
in the Future."
Floats may show how the Farm
will have changed 3,000 years from
now, not only in appearance but
also in way of life, traditions, or at
mosphere.
No duplications will be allowed
in the floats. Ideas must be in by
Wednesday because the number of
floats participating in the parade
will determine the starting time
and the route, Miss Dunlap said.
A proposal for the parade to
march through Palo Alto was dis
cussed at the Cardinals meeting last
night. It will be definitely decided
next week. A 1 Vandervert, who has
been working as co-chairman of
the float committee, has taken a
leave of absence. Walt Moffart will
take his place.
Joe Zukin, Cardinals president,
urged committees to start working
on their floats now, so as to have a
bigger and better parade for the
march through Palo Alto.
