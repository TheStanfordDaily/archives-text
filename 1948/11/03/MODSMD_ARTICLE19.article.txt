# 'Othello's' Debut Tomorrow To Feature Unusual Setting
## 
### 
When the curtain comes up
on "Othello" tomorrow night,
the audience will find the stage
set designed in massive line,
Delford F. Brummer, technical
director, said yesterday.
This type of setting is used to ac
cent the diminutiveness of the indi
vidual in relation to the height of
his surroundings. Symbolically it
represents the individual and his
position in the universe.
Brummer is using the cyclorama, a
65-foot cloth screen against which
light is reflected to the stage, in un
usual illumination for the produc
tion.
The psychological factors of color
ing will be employed from time to
time in specific illumination of the
characters. Green, traditionally sug
gestive of evil, will be trained on
the traitor, while purple, the royal
hue, will be used with the appear
ance of the heroine.
This is Brummer's first production
at Stanford. Prior to joining the

University staff this fall, he worked
with the navy in an administrative
and lecturing capacity.
During the war he was with
theatrical staging divisions in the
Pacific, supplying equipment for lo
cal and USO shows.
He received the MA degree from
lowa, and has worked with the Uni
versity of Nebraska. He has done
some staging in television.
