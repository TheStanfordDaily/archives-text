SAN FERNANDO, Nov. 2 (/P> â€”A 62-year-old native of Syria voted
for the first time today and said, "It's the greatest day of my life."
He is Charles Aid. He told reporters he has been a U. S. resident
foi 35 years, but didn't become a citizen until last year because he
didn't speak English well and someone had told him it was a requisite
of citizenship.
