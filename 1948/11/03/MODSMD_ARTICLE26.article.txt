"Dear Friends:
"East March there arrived in
Italy the second shipment of
Heifers for Relief to this country.
Among these .'5OO heifers there
was one, according to our records,
which was contributed by your
group. The enclosed photo is of
your contributed cow and the
family with whom she now lives.
As yet the cow has never pro
duced but she is supposed to be
bred now. We believe that your
cow has been placed in the most
needy part of Italy where she can
help in the reconstruction of a
family and community.
"... I do not believe that you
can possibly understand how
precious this help is to us—and
when the help comes, and be

cause it is from the young to the
young, our happiness is great and
without shadow."

"Dear American Friends:
"Many, many thanks for the
surprising bundle of warm
clothes you were so kind as to
send to us. What would we do if
it were not for America?
. . We appreciate very much
your aid because we are aware
you sacrificed all this from the
means of your own to help us—
three fellow students—in the de
stroyed Europe, who have lost
everything for their democratic
convictions."

"Dear Friends:
. . My children especially
appreciate the good American
things which are still lacking here
in France. I can picture in my
mind the young girl at Stanford
who wore this checkered skill
and this warm sweater which she
so kindly sent to Monique.
"Students at Stanford, I love
you all and I thank you from the
bottom of my heart."
