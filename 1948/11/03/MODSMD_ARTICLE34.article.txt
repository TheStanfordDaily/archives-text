WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (.4 I )â€”The
Post Office Department today sus
pended all United States mail serv
ice to Manchuria.
The action was taken because of
unsettled conditions in the area
where Communist armies are on
the move. The depaitment said it
had been advised by authorities at
Shanghai that they are now unable
to clear mail from America into the
trouble zone.
Effective immediately, postmasters
throughout the country were in
structed not to accept either letter
mail or parcels for surface or air
delivery to Manchurian destinations.
The department said mail recently
accepted for such destinations but
not yet actually dispatched from the
ports will be returned to the senders.
