# Democrat Explains Truman's Large Popular Vote
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Some of you Republicans and
! Democrats are probably stunned
by the Democratic gubernatorial,
i House, and Senate sweeps or resur
j gences. So doubt you are shaken
; by President Truman's voting re
! turns ... be those shudders happy
or sad, there they are.
Why this Democratic comeback?
1. Republican overconfidence.
2. Some apathy on the part of
| voters regarding both candidates.
| (Still, there ARE more registered
Democrats in the U.S.) These vot
j ers, however, were not apathetic
I concerning local colorful candidates
; und issues. So, in record numbers
| (hey voted for both local issues and
; candidates and national candidates.
While at the polls, many vo(ed for
Truman â€” more than was thought
probable.
3. This is important. Local favor
ites nudged the national ticket.
That is, local Democratic Senato
rial, Representative, or gubernato-

rial candidates were liked by great
majorities in practically all the
states. Rather than the Presiden
tial candidate leading these office
seekers to the top (as did Roose
velt's popularity for less popular lo
cal candidates in strong New Deal
days), men like progressive Mayor
Hubert Humphrey Jr. of Minne
apolis, who won a Senate* seat last
night, and New Mexico's Clinton
Anderson and Illinois' Lt. Col. Paul
Douglas, both of whom did the
same, led Truman into the higher
vote brackets.
4. The chickens of the 80th Con
gress came back to roost.
As a Democrat, I gleefully
chuckle.
As an American, I sincerely hope,
as I'm sure most readers do, that
the next President realizes from
>he terrifically close returns that
there are two parties in this coun
try, that this is one country, arid tlu
two will have to work closer to
gether in a more honest spirit of
co-operation to keep the country
one.
