# â€˜Rope' Termed Unusual Flick
## 
### AL BERRY 
"The Rope," currently showing at
one of Paly's "smoke in the upper
balcony only" shops, is not a good
motion picture.
The story deals with a couple of
Harvard men who playfully stran
gle a classmate and stuff him into
a trunk in the living room. Dinner
is then served to the murdered
chap s lather buffet - style off the
trunk. The whole thing is very
charming. The plot is vaguely rem
iniscent of the Loeb-Leopold case,
but without Clarence Darrow .the
audience must be content to sit
quietly and wait for the newsreel.
Jimmy Stewart, of "Philadelphia
Story" and World War II fame, acts
as though he wished he were back
in Philadelphia or "the blood-rid
den skies of Europe." Stewart is
as usual in this flick, awkward,
g!upy, and somewhat ashamed of
the whole thing. Fortunately, Stew
art was well paid for his efforts.
Unfortunately, the audience was
not.
Believe it or not, "The Pope" does
have a saving grace. It comes in the
form of one John Dall, who is not
mis-cast. Dall is the suavest, most
interesting murderer since Clifton
Webb got the blood - lust in
"Laura." A group of co-eds at USC
voted Dall "the man we'd most like
to get murdered by"; the girls may
have peculiar tastes in how to spend
an evening, but their taste in actors
is excellent.
Alfred Hitchcock, who, unlike
Stewart and the Stanford Theater,
usually puts on a good show, does
his best on this one. The screen
is constantly filled with unusual
and sometimes remarkable camera
shots. While the audience is never
required to sit on the edge of their
seats, they are often required to
open both eyes and get a charge out
of Hitchcock's skillful web-wind
ing.
By all means go and see "The
Rope." It is unusual, if not good.
It is not a good excuse to keep from
studying, but it is sufficient, if one
rationalizes and has 80 cents to kiss
good-bye.

as usual in this flick, awkward,
g!upy, and somewhat ashamed of
the whole thing. Fortunately, Stew
art was well paid for his efforts.
Unfortunately, the audience was
not.
Believe it or not, "The Pope" does
have a saving grace. It comes in the
form of one John Dall, who is not
mis-cast. Dall is the suavest, most
interesting murderer since Clifton
Webb got the blood - lust in
"Laura." A group of co-eds at USC
voted Dall "the man we'd most like
to get murdered by"; the girls may
have peculiar tastes in how to spend
an evening, but their taste in actors
is excellent.
Alfred Hitchcock, who, unlike
Stewart and the Stanford Theater,
usually puts on a good show, does
his best on this one. The screen
is constantly filled with unusual
and sometimes remarkable camera
shots. While the audience is never
required to sit on the edge of their
seats, they are often required to
open both eyes and get a charge out
of Hitchcock's skillful web-wind
ing.
By all means go and see "The
Rope." It is unusual, if not good.
It is not a good excuse to keep from
studying, but it is sufficient, if one
rationalizes and has 80 cents to kiss
good-bye.
