# 'Southern Comet’ Stars for Army
## 
### 
WEST POINT. Nov. 2 (#). —
i There is a growing feeling around
! here that Gil Stephenson, a thin
i shanked fullback from Columbus,
Ga., is about to make the Cadets
forget Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis.
They are waiting only to see if he
continues his phenomenal ball-car
rying against Stanford at the Yan
kee Stadium this Saturday and
againt Penn the following week
before they go overboard on the
Southern Comet.
Stephenson, a yearling with only
six varsity games behind him, real
ly looks like something special. He
j pops through an opposing line like
a rabbit out of the underbrush, and
he is harder to get down than a
! greased shoat
He has carried 103 times—exclu-
I sively through the middle—for 662
! yards, or an average of 6.4 yards.
Against Virginia Tech last week he
averaged over eight yardsi though
I two fine runs of 23 and 13 yards
were called back,
Stanford will find it ; its; difficult
to understand vtfiere .Stephenson
gets his driving power as it 4 will to
flag him down. He stands an even
six feet and weighs only 181, yet
as he slants and wrenches his way
1 through the secondary he gives the
impression he is rocket propelled.
