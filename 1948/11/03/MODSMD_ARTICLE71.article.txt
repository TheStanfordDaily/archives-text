## Reds Drill For Army Kaydets 
### 
| With but one day of practice
| remaining before they board their
j TWA Constellation for New York
and the Army football team, the
i Stanford gridders ran through sig
nal drills and practiced against
Army plays and pass patterns.
Schwartz bemoaned the loss of a
| practice session while he used Mike
[ Jim Hayes, Bruce Van Al
j styne, and John Banks as the back-

| field of an "Army" team. This team
ran the West Pointers' plays against
J the varsity in a xlummy scrimmage.
The hopes of the Reds were
strengthened by the return of Aub
rey Devine to the roll of the ac
tive players. Emery Mitchell, who
missed Monday's practice because
of a cold, was out for practice in a
sweat suit.
Jim Nafziger is still taking it easy
as he continues to turn out in a
sweat suit. Dave Field is counted
out of game, as is Ather
ton Phleger. Phleger was released
I from the hospital yesterday but will
not make the trip to New York.
