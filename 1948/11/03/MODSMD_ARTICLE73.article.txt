Tomorrow morning our football team leaves for what well may tui
out to be the toughest game for the Cards since Stanford resumed foot
ball in 19-16.
Army. The name has hardly been mentioned during the past seve
weeks. When the game was signed last year, Army was continuing o
one of the greatest winning streaks in football history. The great, an
that team deserves the ultimate adjective "great," Army team of Blan
chard, Davis, and Tucker was partially disbanded, but some of the me
who made up the team that ran roughshod over the nation's best for tw
years were still playing.
This week a Stanford team that is trying desperately to regain th
glory of Stanford teams of years gone by will meet another Army tean
a team unbeaten and untied in six games this season. It is also a tean
tiiat is riding the crest of an eight-game winning streak dating fron
the 27 to 7 defeat at the hands of Notre Dame last year.
Black knights Better Than in "47
This West Point squad has not yet, and is not likely to, reach the fam
of the teams of '45 and '46. But on-the-spot observers have written t
Marchie Schwartz saying that this year's team is better than the '47 tear
at this date last year.
It is still coached by Red Blaik, one of the top men in the country
It is still made up of men from the Academy, men who have made th
name of Army synonymous with hard, rock 'n sock football.
But Army can be had. This is the week, the game, that Stanford ca
show the football world that the Farm can once again be counted in wit
the nation's gridiron best.
The odds will be almost prohibitive. Stanfox-d should be underdogs b
upwards of 18 points. But Stanford can win. It will be the upset of th
v/eek, indeed, the year, if the Red Machine rolls to a win over the Blac
Knights of the Hudson.
Linemen In For a I\ou<jh Afternoon
If Stanford is to win, or to keep the score close, it will have to con
about by the work of the linemen. Men the likes of Gordon White, ,
Rau, Bob Rohrer, Don Fix, A 1 Laakso, and Ken Rose, and their reserve
will have to play better than they have ever played before. The seer
to a win over Army rests with them.
They will face a forward wall of men steeped in the Army traditii
of playing 60 minutes of top brand tootball. Army uses the "platooi
system. Blaik has an offensive and defensive team. Stanford couldi
use this system if they wanted to. The material just isn't there. It is ev
dent that our boys will have to play over their heads to come out on to
They will be meeting a team rated fourth in the nation 3,000 mil
from home on the hard, unfamiliar turf of Yankee Stadium.
It is the line that will have to turn the trick because the backfield c;
do no better than their line allows. Army has three fourths of last yea
Lackfield playing this year. Men like Gil Stephenson, Bobby Jack Stua
Bill Gustafson, and Arnold Galifla could make any ball team in the cou
try. They have scored 204 points to their opponents' 48.
Stephenson Averages 6.4 Yards Per Try
This kid Stephenson has carried the ball 103 times or for 662 yar<
An average of 6.4 yards per crary. Add to this the fact that his can
are mostly through the center of the line, rarely does he skirt the ends.
Blaik himself admits that this year's team is much better than last yea
squad. He adds that it is even better than the '45 outfit of Blancha
and Davis. That is the team that Stanford meets Saturday.
1 hey have scored four touchdowns or more in every game this yt
but oneâ€”that with Illinois. Army won that one 26 to 21.
It has been pointed out that Army hasn t really played a team of s
nificance this year with the exception of Illinois and Cornell. But An
is rated fourth in the nation, and it would be a tremendous upset
Stanford to win. In my book, the Cards will cover themselves with gk
if they hold this team to but a six-point margin of victory.
Army Reserves Verv Strong
Army's reserves far outrank Stanford's. This will show up early
the game, find will be even more evident in the later stages. Army ir
be looking over Stanford to their match with a tough Penn team on
next weekend. But even if this were true, the Cards will find themseh
against a very tough team.
This year's Indian team has shown that they can come from behi
and win. They have shown that they can't be counted out even wl
there is a three-touchdown difference on the scoreboard. You can
sure that they will be trying right up to the final gun. Army doe:-
expect much from Stanford. This drive, Stanford spirit if you will, n
bo the difference between the two teams.
