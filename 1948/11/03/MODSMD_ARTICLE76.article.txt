# Bears Beware, Frosh Tough
## 
### 
1 Here must have been a breeze
irom Berkeley blowing over the
Irosh practice field yesterday. And
judging from the way Chuck Tay- i
lors yearlings squared oil against ;
each other in scrimmage, it was j
obvious they caught the drift of the
wind. With but lour days to go till
the Cal game and season's end, the 1
boys went at it so you could hear ;
the "crack" and "thud" clear down ;
to Carlun's.
The first string opened on of
fen.se with . Gary Kerkorian at
ciiuu'ter, Marv Mellaway at full, and
Harry Hugasian and Eric South
wood at the halves. On the first ,
three plays they sprang Hugasian
into the secondary and, needless to l
say, 'Hustlin'" Harry went all the j
way each time. As he proved at the
expense of Menlo JC Saturday,
once in the secondary the boy is |
money in the bank.

Dick Horn took over later at the
skipper spot and showed that he
now has his timing on the fast
breaking "T" plays down pat. Horn
sat out most of the earlier part of
the season with injuries and just
lately has recovered the form that
made him one of the Southland's
most highly rated preysters.
Guards Owen Powell and Jess
Cone were making tackles all over
the field when it came time for the
first string to take over the defense.
Both have shown a complete lack
of the freshman lineman's usual
weaknessâ€”trap plays. They hit to
kill, but they can't be suckered.
Tackles Lee Daley and Chuck
Hokanson looked better than they
have all season. Both have im
proved tremendously under the tu
telage of Messrs. Madigan and
Feldman, line coaches, leaving
Taylor's front wall with little in

j the way of a weakness.
Wingman Bill McColl stood at
I midfield and nonchalantly kicked
goal alter goal with Horn and Ker
koriun holding. McCo l's boot may
one day be a terrific offensive weap
one day be a terrific offensive
| weapon. As it is this season, the
frosh have had little need of field
goals in outscoring their opponents.
Only cripple at present is half
back Glen Crawford, who is suffer
ing with a pulled muscle. Crawford
was able to play only a few minutes
against Menlo, and it is unknown
j whether he will be in shape for the
ber cubs.
