What goes on in some of these classrooms? In the margin of a text
the other clay, former owner unknown, was found the fallowing notations:
"I'll write you when I decide to ever associate with anyone. Yes maybe.
Will you please go, I want to study." The answer is probably very simple
when known, much simpler than the one I have in mind, though mine
is no doubt more interesting. So, if you're through studying, honey, let's
get associated!
A frosh, a very green frosh girl in fact, was walking past Hoover
Memorial and saw a blue-lettered "Cal" on the side of the building.
"Fools' names, like fools' faces," she says."I wonder who this stupid
Cal person is who's leaving his name ail over." Proving that hammers
aren't the only simple tools.
Seems the two boys who put the nd in the Dippy asking Jim Joseph
to please pay the 91 cents due from a dollar ket of last quarter, have been
heunding him by telephone and making life miserable night and day for
his roomies who have to answer the teiephone. Now they have sworn
out a warrant for "making a public nuisance" and plan to slap it on the
culprits at the next outburst. Here's a chance for free room and board,
fellas, if you want to take advantage of it.
During \>ne of the crucial moments of the USC game here last week
one of the boys in the band was discovered diligently doing his math
assignment .... the same one who fell asleep during the chaotic devel
opments of Big Game last year. Stan —ford—man—rah!
And speaking of the game like we are. Mike Grandsen—better known as
Injun Joe—didn't even get the name and address of the squaw dancer
from the Southern Cal minions who displayed such .... ah .... er
.... dancing ability, shall we say, on our side of the field at halftime
.... while 4,000 fellas panted!
Since the frosh seem to have this Stanford pig situation penned, any
of you juniors and seniors want some dates over at Paly High? If so,
talk to Bert Tickes at the Village. He does a bit of bouncing (he calls
it chaperoning) at their big doings. He's a talent scout for some of the
Stanford women's dorms on the side, I hear.
The boys of dorm 312 in the Village have been complaining about the
scarcity of mail lately. After mail call recently there appeared over the
mail boxes the sign—"Keep Smiling." Reminds us of the old U.S. Ma
rines' hymn "I've got mine, buddy, how are you doing?"
It made me stop and rejoice that I am in America the other day when
I overheard several of the boys discussing quite freely the race problems
and name-calling that goes with the racial prejudices .... for in this
group discussion was a Negro and a Chinese student. For instance, few
of the boys knew that a Negro doesn't like to be called a "colored boy"
and that a Chinese dislikes being referred to as a "Chinaman." If the
national governments would sit down and talk things over iike this, per
haps there would be much less ill feeling in this old world today.
A gift of $2,177 isn't much in the life of a rich university like Stanford.
It wouldn't make it or break it. But just recently they went out of their
way to honor just such a gift .... for though that gift was small in size,
it was beyond proportions in feelings. The money represented the life
savings of 74-year-old Susan Kohl Nagengast, an Austrian immigrant
who died in 1944 after working 1(5 years as a baker in one of Stanford's
women's dorms. In her will she said she wanted to have a part in edu
cating the youth of her adopted country. Portrait of a real American!
