Speaking of fooiball, someone
down in the SAC Building had bet- '
ter bone up on his zoology. Wash
ington's Husky on last week's game
ducats looked more like a husky
Cougar to us.

And next year — the Harvard j
Crimson meets the Stanford Car- j
dinal. What a clash!

Tut-tut dept.: We hear from the
Administration that there are all
too few funds for repaying Stan- j
ford's roadways—and from outsio'e :
the Corporation Yard we hear the
sound of a bare - treaded tractor <
dragging a metal runner sled, leav- j
ing its mark on a none-too-good
ooking stretch of tar.

P.S. to reports on the "Cal spir
it (?)": The Bear rooters caused
the photography staff of Life mag
azine no end of trouble in prepar
ing a recent spread on the state
scnool so Uncle Sam's post offices
would let it through. Some people (
ought to have their hands slapped, j

You can probably top this dept.:
There's a fellow out at ths Village
who sends his clothes home to Ida
lio to be cleaned. There's nothing
like good old home-washed clothes.

Maybe you noticed Stanford's
banner whipping i:i the wind above
tho rooting section Saturday. The
ASSU passed the peace pipe down
to Joe Bruin and worked a trade.
The banner came back by mail last
week, plenty the worse for wear.

One night recently a stealthy- i
looking character was spotted i
sneaking un behind the Oaks in the
dead of night. With a violent heave. !
he cut off the house's electricity,
and made a dashing get - away—
right into the fishpond. They say
someone turned up at the firehouse j
the next morning with two teeth ;
missing. Any connection with the
goldfish swallowing?
