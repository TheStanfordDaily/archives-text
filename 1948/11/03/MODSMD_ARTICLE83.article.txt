CALIFORNIA LANDMARKS by
Jim McClure (Stanford University
Press).
This took is a collection of photo
graphs of many histroic landmarks
of the state. Compiled by Jim Mc-
Clure. director of photography at
Stanford, this collection is accom
panied by short explanatory pas
sages both for the general areas
covered, and certain pictures of par
ticular interest.
The compilation is divided into
four regional ai'eas: Southern Cali
fornia, San Francisco region. Mother
Lode country, and miscellaneous and
scattered landmarks. Included are
photographs of the Missions, the
cities, towns, and of the men who
made California history.
The most interesting section is the
study of the Mother Lode country,
the widely dispersed places where
the traveler is not likely to pass.
Many photos are of landmarks
from ghost towns.
The Southern California area na
turally yields the least variety of
historic or photographic material.
It is in this section that many of
the Mission pictures appear.
The San Francisco area, ranging
from Monterey to Sonoma, includes
pictures relating to some of the
famous men who have lived in Cali
fornia. There are the landmarks
known to John Muir, Mark Twain.
Jack London, and Robert Ix>uis
Stevenson. The homes of Bret
Harte and Lola Montez appear in
the Mother Lode chapter.
Tlie fourth section is loss unified.
It covers landmarks in the far
northern part of the state, besides
photographs of Sutter's Fort, the
buildings of which were headquar
ters for General Grant and Fremont.
Together, these sections cover a
wide area and a long span of years
in this state, making an interesting
nanorama of California. â€” Priscilla
