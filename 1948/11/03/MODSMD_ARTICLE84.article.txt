## Unkind Statements on France 
### 
To the Editor:
Jan van Gindertael makes some very interesting statements about post
war France in last Friday's Daily. The attitude he takes toward that
country strikes me as rather unkind, however, and that might have
induced him to say more than he can prove.
France has a very weak government, that is perfectly true; they havt
reached an old-grown stage, that also is true; but maybe something can
be done to help France and give it its old spirit back. Instead of trying
to say so many unkind things about France, most of them unfair 02
even untrue, we should try to find some means to bring France back
on its feet.
Is it fair, what van Gindertael says about French underground forces?
I have known them during the war and I have a great admiration foi
the way in which the French organzied their underground forces. It is,
in my opinion, definitely unfair and untrue to say that de Gaulle only
succeeded in grouping resistance forces after public had been changed
by forced labor in Germany.
Repulsed Collaboration
The French had formed an underground as early as any other country,
and the fact that the Germans found some politicians in Fiance to their
service does not change the fact that the French people as a whole refused
collaboration. Is it fair to speak about purification being transformed
into an endles wrangling game of reciprocal jealousies, as if other coun
tries were much better?
Coming from Belgium, v. G. should know how extremely difficult the
problems of purification are. Need I really remind him of the great un
solved purification problem in his own country?
Is it fair to state that only Britain's example led tlhe French to declart
war against Germany, and is it true France and Great Britain were Allies
and neither of them would or even could have gone to war without th.
other?
Let us not forget that one of the principal causes of the weakness o
France is its loss of 1.bU0.000 men. if van G.'s figure is correct, in a wa
where rrar.ee fought on the side which in our opinion protected freedon
and democracy. France lost that large percentage of its young men parti;
for our sake.
Leaders Needed
The French people need leaders. Help them find those leaders. Here i
something that you personally can do. Invite more young outstandin
I* renchmen to your colleges and universities, and show them how democ
racy works. In France democracy is destroying itself, and nobody ther
knows what to do about it. Your democracy here, although far from per
feet, is working much better than that in France, so bring them hen
Don't leave them alone.
trance, in my opinion, is not in a worse position than Germany is. W
try, and you try, to help Germany. Why don't we help France? Yesterda
I read that 28 Germans and Austrians are invited to spend a year i
Catholic colleges in the U. S. I know that Germany and Austria nee
democratic leaders very badly, but France does too, and France wi
an Ally.
For me, as a Dutchman, the future of France is a serious question, bv
it is serious for you, too. You may think you are far away and safe her
but you are not. You cannot afford a void or a communistic regime i
France any more than we can.
