The partition of the Emerald Isle should end immediately for a numb
of reasons. Primarily, it is not logical that a people with the same rach
cultural, ethnical, and fundamentally similar religious backgrouns shou
be living in such close proximity and still remain separated because
pressure applied by an external political force.
The entire island is, in toto, a natural economic unit, and should becon
such for the mutual benefit of both parties, eliminating the senseless irr.po
fees now burdening both sections. Northern Ireland would enjoy low
taxes, and her industry would prosper more if she excluded the tribu
now paid to the British Empire.

No Religious Intolerance
In spite of the unfavorable feeling generated by the 18th and 19th cei
tury English persecutions of the Irish-Catholics, the Ulster Protestan
need fear no religious intolerance from a nation and people whose fig
lor religious freedom has been notorious.
Another point worth viewing is the fact that the Catholics are tl
largest religious sect in Northern Ireland as well, numbering 35 per ce
ot the population. Because of our constitutional guarantee of separatii
of church and state we cannot unequivocally condemn every count
where clerics act also as political individuals. Our democratic neighbt
England, supports a state church. Tolerant people do not believe th
our way is necessarily the only way.
Irish Won't Fight
As far as the wartime neutrality of Eire is concerned. I would like
lemind Allen that Irish would declare war only when they intended
fight. When (hey do not intend to or cannot fight, they remain
which in Irish ethics means neutral to everyone. The Joint High commai
wanted Ireland to remain neutral, since, if she were not. she would
a vulnerable target for German attack, too costly to defend.
Tlie immediate future is a most necessary and opportune time to ei
this partition since the External Relations Act of 1936 is to be repeal
next month, thus freeing the last bonds of subservience and making Ei
economically free from the British Empire.
A critical discussion of some segment of the news is a commendal
