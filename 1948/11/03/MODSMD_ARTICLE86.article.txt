# Weather Affects the Vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 2 GP>. —
Tile weather had a hand in today's
heavy vote—mild and clear almost
everywhere in the country.
Muddy roads may have hogged
down some farm votes in eastern
and northern Missouri and in
southern Illinois. The heaviest rains
in the country were reported in
those areas.
Scattered rains—but not enough
to make dirt loads impassable—fell

in western Kentucky, eastern
j South Carolina and Georgia,
j Showers also fell in Mont.u
j northern California, and in the
Northwest. It was warm and dun
: in southern California.
Coolest spot was probably M.«
| with the mercury in the low 11
early in the morning. Later
warmed up and the weather n>
said he couldn't see how many b.
i lots could have been froren.
