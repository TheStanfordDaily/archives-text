# New Congress Must Decide Vital Issues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (.I').—Re
urn oi' firm Congressional control
o the Democratic party brought a
ush of questions today over the
egislative future.
These subjects popped out as re
urns from Tuesday's voting gave
he Democrats a wide working ma
ority of both the Senate and the
louse after two years of playing
econd fiddle to the Republicans:
1. What will happen to States'
? Democrats elected to Con
fess? '
2. Will the Taft-Hartley Law be
epealed?
3. What will become of President
Yuman's civil rights program
vhich split the Democratic party
vide open this election year?
4. How about taxes, inflation
urbs. and rent control on which
,Iv. Truman differed sharply with
he Republicans?
Committees Change
The 81st Congress takes over on
an. 3. At that time, control of all

Ie legislative machinery and the
hairmanships of all Senate and
louse committees will shift from
lepublican to Democratic hands.
The last vestige of doubt that the
democrats were back in the saddle
n Capitol Hill were removed by
ite returns.
They not only lodged the Demo
rats firmly in charge of the Senate
ut gave them bigger House major
ies than they had enjoyed in the
losing years of ranklin D. Roose
elt's administration.
Control Both Houses
With 218 needed for House con
•ol and 49 for Senate dominance,
le Democrats elected 21 Senators
-plus 30 holdovers—and 252 Rep
asentatives.
Toppled into the Democratic col
mn in the House were such big
;ates as Ohio, New York, and In
iana, with broad Democratic gains
balked up in Illinois and Pennsyl
ania.
Joseph Martin will step down as
louse Speaker in January and
>emocrat Sam Rayburn of Texas
•ill replace him. Halleck probably
nil give up the GOP floor leader
hip to make a place for Martin to
escend to. Vice - President - elect
ilben W. Barkley of Kentucky will
ike over the gavel in the Senate.
