# European Alliance Expected From New Democrat Regime
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (AP)
— President Truman's first ma
jor post-election move in foreign
policy very likely will be to or
der a State Department go-ahead
within a few days on negotiations
for a military alliance with Western
Europe.
If he acts on this Kne, as State
Department officials expect, his
new majorities in House and Senate
should greatly enlarge his chances
of winning congressional approval
both for the treaty and also for a
costly lend-lease arms program ex
pected to be proposed in connection.
Effective in January
The alliance proposition in some
fo i in may be ready for congressional
action early in January.
The President also may come to
grips soon with the new crisis
created in China by sweeping Com
munist victories and by the weak
ening of Chiang Kai-Shek's govern
ment. State Department people
have felt deeply concerned—but
pretty helpless—over the situation
there.
But while the future course of his
global strategy in the cold war
seems clear, the identity of the men
who will help Mr. Truman carry out
his mandate in foreign policy is un
certain.
State Department Changes
Secretary of State Marshall, Sec

retary of Defense Forrestal, and Un
dersecretary of State Lovett are ex
pected to resign by January 20, the
inauguration of Mr. Truman's second
term. All are key figures in the
global strategy worked out here over
the past two years to meet the Rus
sian problem.
Who will replace them is a mat
ter of almost complete guesswork in
the absence of any hints from Mr.
Truman himself. But one guess con
sidered good for Secretary of State
is Dean Acheson, who was under
secretary until 18 months ago and
is known as a friend of Mr. Tru
man.
The expectation here is that the
impending shifts in key men will
not materially alter the main line
of the American diplomatic strategy
of peace through power, in or out
of the United Nations.
