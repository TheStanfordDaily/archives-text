# 'Othello' Performance Opens Season for Stanford Players
## 
### 
The 1948-49 Stanford Players'
subscription series will open to
night with Shakespeare's "Othello,"
the tragedy of the Moor who loved
"not wisely, but too well."
The performance begins at 8:15
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Those
who do not already have tickets
may purchase them for 90 cents at
the box office.
The cast for the three-night run
will be topped by Richard Egan,
the lad who turned down imme
diate offers from Warner Brothers
and Columbia Pictures to return to
Stanford this quarter.
Jane Mac Arthur, appearing in
her first major role with the Play
ers, will co-star with Egan.
Strong supporting roles belong to
Morgan Stock, Colly Newman, and
Ruth Fisher.
Colorful and rich costumes de
signed in lavish Venetian Renais
sance style were made for the pro
duction by Selma Chapmond as her
Master's thesis. Costumes were
made by the costume classes.
Motion picture techniques of pro
duction will be used to make the
action smooth and continuous, ac
cording to Dr. A. Nicholas Vardac,
director.
Massive stage setting will pro
vide a semi - permanent back
ground, allowing unusual lighting
effects to frame the scene. Hues of
green, purple, and red reflected to
the stage will complement the bril
liant costumes of the actors.
Original Incidental music com
posed by Leonard Ratner, instruc
tor in music, will underscore dra
matic high points in the play and
provide transition. Three songs
were also written by Ratner for
principal characters of the drama.
The play is under the technical
direction of Detford F. Brummer,
assisted by student technical direc-

I tors Paul Hostetler and O. G.
Brocket t.
, Richard V. von Ezborf heads the
scene crew, while Robert Andreini
has charge of light crews. The con
trol board is operated by James
I Gildersleeve and Don Sheffey.
