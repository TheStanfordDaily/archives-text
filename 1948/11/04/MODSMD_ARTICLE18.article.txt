What will Stanford look like 3.000
years from now? Will ii be entirely
underground, as a defense from
the atomic bomb, or will buildings
be entirely of plastic? Will class
rooms be extinct, with students
getting their Poli Sci notes from a
television screen in their rooms'.'
Wiil helicopters be allowed on
Quad?
Answers to these questions will
be found in the Big Game Float
Parade Nov. 19, in which all living
groups will enter to compete for
prizes. "Groups should sign up theii
float themes now in the ASSU of
fice," said Mimi Dunlap, float co
chairman.
'No duplications in ideas are al
lowed. Deadline for signups hatf
been set for Wednesday." said Walt
Moflatt, co-chairman of the parade,
"so that the starting time and the
route can be decided upon."
"The parade may be taken into
Palo Alto this year, so living groups
are urged to construct as good floats
as possible, ' Miss Dunlap said.
"This year we want to have the
best Big Game Float Parade Stan
ford has ever had," Miss Dunlap
said, "particularly if it goes into
Palo Alto. So we are encouraging
the houses and dorms to combine
their energy and originality to
make their floats win."
