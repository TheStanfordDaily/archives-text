# Stanford Profs Analyze Upset Election
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Four Stanford professors—an
economist, a political scientist, a
historian, and a statistician, ex
pressed their reactions yester
day to the sweeping Democratic
victory last Tuesday.
In accounting for the errors made
by national pollists, who predicted
a Republican landslide, Professor
Edward Shaw of the economics de
partment and Edgar Robinson of
the history department, agreed on
a number of factors which they said
may well have had an effect on this
misleading forecast.
Both men said that there might
have been a last-minute shift among
the nation's large minority of un
decided voters. Dr. Robinson said
that there may have been a great
number who thought before-hand
I hey were going to vote for Dewey
and ended by favoring Truman.
Dr. Robinson stated that he be
lieved the last month of the Tru
man campaign a great factor in
such a shift of the independents.
He said the American people like
such a fighter as President Tru
man seemed to prove himself.
The two professors also brought
out the fact that a great many peo
ple recorded in the polls may never
have voted. Dr. Robinson said, how
ever, that this possibility could only
be verified upon reception of the fi
nal results.
Shaw, speaking from an eco
nomic viewpoint, said also that
there were a number of factors
which have built up during the
last two years which seem to have
turned the voting tide from Re
publican to Democratic.
In this round-up he included high
prices, a desire to repeal such labor

legislation as the Taft-Hartley Act,
and a general opinion that the
Democrats will bring in more gov
ernmental rules and regulations in
combating inflation than would the
Republicans, whose policy seems to
be one of leaving things alone.
In excerpts from a statement is
sued yesterday, Dr. Robinson said,
concerning the over-all picture:
'"The American people are still
voting for Franklin Roosevelt. The
machines which supported Roose
velt supported Truman. Unquestion
ably, except for the extremes of la
bor—radicals and conservatives in
that group—the great unorganized
labor of the country voted for Tru
man (Roosevelt).
Returns in Ohio seem to indicate
that the Negroes there, and in lowa,
Indiana, and Illinois, the farmers,
are still voting for Roosevelt (Tru
man). The liberals, that is, those
who have liberal ideas, some of
them nineteenth century liberal
ideas, are still voting for Roosevelt
via Truman."
Commenting on the mechanics of
the major national polls as possible
sources of error, Meyer Gershick,
professor of statistics, said that

faulty techniques were most prob
ably the causes of such errors. He
said that it is possible to get a
statistically accurate poll, with a
relatively small percentage of error,
but that such a poll is expensive,
time-taking, and dependent on the
capability of the poll-taker's assist
ants.
He said that in view of the land
slide Democratic victory, the polls
should have been more accurate.
He stressed a scientific procedure
and a well-defined and accurate
percentage of error as necessities
in a true poll.
Professor Thomas D. Barclay,
commenting on the results of the
election had this to say.
'"The control of the Presidency
and both Houses of the Congress
by the same political party makes
possible a responsibility and even a
unity of action which are essential
to successful and positive govern
ment.
"All Americans, regardless of
party, should be glad that the exist
ing divisions and antagonisms can
be abolished by the very unex
pected results of yesterday's elec
tions."
