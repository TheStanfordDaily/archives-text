## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 3 (JP).—Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey indicated today
his second defeat for the Presidency
may well be his swan song in poli
tics.
Less than two hours after he con
ceded he had lost to President Tru
man, he told a news conference
flatly he would not run for the
White House again.
He added that he had no plans to
seek a third term as New York's
Governo^.
But the 46-year-old Republican
Presidential nominee labeled as
"pure fiction" reports he would quit
as Governor before his term ends
Dec. 31, 1950.
Dewey signaled the end of one of
the nation's most amazing Presi
dential election scrambles when he
sent a telegram of congratulations
to Mr. Truman at 11:15 a.m. (EST).
The message offered "heartiest
congratulations" and "every good
wish for a successful administra
tion."
"I urge all Americans," Dewey
told the President, "to unite behind
you in support of every effort to
keep our nation strong and free and
establish peace in the world."
The Governor said at the news
conference that he realized he was
beaten after he awoke from a two
hour nap this morning. The Illinois
and Ohio returns convinced him, he
explained.
