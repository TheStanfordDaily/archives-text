## Election Hangover 
### 
While this Republican campus is stunned (with the exception
cf Tom Barclay, George Velliotes, Floyd Kilgore, and Fred Kane)
at the outcome of the national elections, there are some bright
signs in the air.
The vote showed unmistakably that we still have a healthy,
'wo party country and that there is no danger from the extreme
left.
Truman's strength in the small and middle states carried him
to victory, while Dewey's popularity in the large, populous
states and the traditionally Republican states was not enough
io win.
The Wallace movement is definitely not a national one. The
majority of his vote came from New York and Los Angeles, an
extremely spotty vote and a disappointment to the Wallace
followers. The upstart Thurmond did better with his 38 electoral
votes.
After the election, the United States looks more than ever
like one nation. There is added reason for everyone to work
together. Certainly the Republicans can no longer blame all
of their troubles on the Democrats; similarly, the Democrats
cannot place all of the responsibility for their troubles on a
recalcitrant Republican Congress.
One big danger remains, howeverâ€”the embarrassing Tru
man bungles. It can only be hoped that his most recent ones
can be attributed partially to the strain of campaigning. For the
security of the nation the President must get next to himself.
And if he isn't sure of what he's doing, he must trust his advisers.
