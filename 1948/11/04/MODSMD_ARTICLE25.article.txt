# GEORGE VELLIOTES
## Bull Session 
### 
Didn't have to take benzedrine to stay awake two nights ago. Listened
to the election returns for 12 hours. The PG&E sure made its loot off
of us owls.
* * *
Now Harry is planning to add another balcony to the front of the domi
cile. So what if it does take construction jobs 16 months to finish? He

has 48 more.
* * *
Harry's theme song to the Dixiecrats has probably
changed now from"I Told You I Loved You. Now
Get Out," to "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?"
♦ ♦ *
As the returns were lolling in two nights ago, Jim
Farley kept looking at them and saying, "Amazing,
amazing, amazing."
No kidding, no kidding, no kidding.
* * ♦
Well, there goes one adage out the window: "If at

first you don't succeed, try. try, and try again."
Says Thomas E. Dewey to this: "Nuts!"
* # #
You surprised ones, yeah, you beer guzzlers, should have been at the
political debate last Monday night instead. John Hines and G. V. would
have explained it all to you. All. Then we'd have explained it to
ourselves.
* * *
The rats who were deserting the ship are still trying lo explain it as
they crawl back up the cable chain.
+ + *
George Gallup, who hemmed and hawed over ABC election-returns
night sounded a little sorry that he'd put his hoof into his mouth. Literary
Digest .... now the Gallup Poll. Nothing's sacred.
* # *
Liberal Democratic Mennen Williams Jr. won the Michigan senator
ship. His folks are the ones who make baby powder. Williams won oil
the slogan, no doubt, "It's time for a change."
* * *
History will record two upsets for this week. Truman over Dewey.
Stanford over Army.
» * +
I don't like to tell The Daily headline writers their business. Really.
But I think they made a shabby mistake by disregarding the obvious.
Yesterday morning's headline should have been: "WHAT HAPPENED?"
# * *
And how did you like those sponsored election returns this year?
Now, the way I got it over the radio, Truman's airflow-styled forehead
induced all Nash owners to vote Democrat, whereas Dewey's airfoam
cushion mustache was used by all Chevrolet owners as a windshield
wiper in 1939.
♦ ♦ *
Somebody snafued something on the teletypes down at KNX, L. A. CBS
station the other night. A surprised announcer found himself reading
off thetfresh ream he was holding: "President Truman's showing is sur
prisingly strong, but Thomas E. Dewey came in first at Tanforan and
paid five-fifty on the nose."

I don't like to tell The Daily headline writers their business. Really.
But I think they made a shabby mistake by disregarding the obvious.
Yesterday morning's headline should have been: "WHAT HAPPENED?"
# * *
And how did you like those sponsored election returns this year?
Now, the way I got it over the radio, Truman's airflow-styled forehead
induced all Nash owners to vote Democrat, whereas Dewey's airfoam
cushion mustache was used by all Chevrolet owners as a windshield
wiper in 1939.

Somebody snafued something on the teletypes down at KNX, L. A. CBS
station the other night. A surprised announcer found himself reading
off thetfresh ream he was holding: "President Truman's showing is sur
prisingly strong, but Thomas E. Dewey came in first at Tanforan and
paid five-fifty on the nose."

Didn't have to take benzedrine to stay awake two nights ago. Listened
to the election returns for 12 hours. The PG&E sure made its loot off
of us owls.
* * *
Now Harry is planning to add another balcony to the front of the domi
cile. So what if it does take construction jobs 16 months to finish? He

has 48 more.
* * *
Harry's theme song to the Dixiecrats has probably
changed now from"I Told You I Loved You. Now
Get Out," to "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?"
♦ ♦ *
As the returns were lolling in two nights ago, Jim
Farley kept looking at them and saying, "Amazing,
amazing, amazing."
No kidding, no kidding, no kidding.

Well, there goes one adage out the window: "If at

first you don't succeed, try. try, and try again."
Says Thomas E. Dewey to this: "Nuts!"

You surprised ones, yeah, you beer guzzlers, should have been at the
political debate last Monday night instead. John Hines and G. V. would
have explained it all to you. All. Then we'd have explained it to
ourselves.

The rats who were deserting the ship are still trying lo explain it as
they crawl back up the cable chain.

George Gallup, who hemmed and hawed over ABC election-returns
night sounded a little sorry that he'd put his hoof into his mouth. Literary
Digest .... now the Gallup Poll. Nothing's sacred.

Liberal Democratic Mennen Williams Jr. won the Michigan senator
ship. His folks are the ones who make baby powder. Williams won oil
the slogan, no doubt, "It's time for a change."
* * *
History will record two upsets for this week. Truman over Dewey.
Stanford over Army.
