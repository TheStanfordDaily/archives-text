# Threat to The North
## 
### JAN M. VAN GINDERTAEL 
Three small countries are on the
strategical road which leads from
Greenland, the extreme outpost of
the American continent, to Lenin
grad and Moscow, the largest cities
of Russia. Since the beginning of
this year, those three nations—Swe
den, Norway, and Denmark—have
been wondering what would hap
pen to them if, tomorrow, the cold
war would become simply the war.
While attack - exposed Sweden
does not wish to make any commit
ment beyond Scandinavian co-oper-

ation and keeps
her faith in the
neutrality which
has preserved
her from war
for 130 years,
Denmark and

Norway res o -
lately look for
ward to outside
aid. Five
years of German
occupation have

Dcen a warning to them.
In those dramatic clays of April,
1940, Sweden was very near sharing
the same fate. But it was the time
of the Soviet-German friendship:
strangely enough, Molotov, through
his pressure on Ribbentrop, saved
Sweden from the hardships of war.
Later on, in 1941, Sweren had to
accept the price of this peace: Ger
man troops heading for northern
Norway were granted the privilege
of using the Swedish railroad. The
resentment this caused in Denmark,
and above all in Norway, has not
disappeared.
Partial to Allies
Yet, it would be unfair to omit
that.Sweden refused to renew the
transit agreement as soon as Ger
many's strength had weakened.
Eventually, Sweden even demon
strated partiality toward the Allies,
training and equipping an anti-Ger
man Danish Legion, breaking open
the German blockade in order to
supply Britain with Swedish-made
war material -even to the point of
rending an unexploded German
rocket, which in experimental flight
had strayed to Sweden, to be stud
ied by the British. And last but not
least, the Swedes secretly sent back
to Allied bases the invaluable air
men who were forced to land in
Sweden after a bomb run to Ger
many.
Since 1941, the Swedish army has
been developing and improving, so
as to dispose today of the most
modern material—for infante, each
conscripted recruit is provided with
an automatic rifle. For years, the
Bofors arms manufacturers have
been supplying an efficient anti
aircraft gun which, during World
War 11, was used on all European
and African battlefields, both by
the Axis and the Allies.
Navy Reorganized
Reorganized, the Swedish navy
now prides itself on its fast, ultra
modern small cruisers such as the
"Gdta Lejon' and the "Trc Kroner"
or on its two dozen pocket U-boats.
But nothing in Swedish military
power is more impressive than the
display of the new jet-propelled
planes, entirely made in the Lin
kiiping factories. Their speed ex
ceeds 800 miles per hour.
The excellent quality of their
forces has naturally fortified the
Swedes' opinion that they could
sustain the first onset launched on
(hem, in spite of their unfavorable
geographical position with the So
viets facing them on a line of more
than 1,200 miles. The loss of Fin
land, which used to be Sweden's
advanced bastion, has even in
creased the danger. Nevertheless,
the Swedes are not alarmed and, as
in the time of the German threat,
base their defense on the countless
lakes, islands, and forests of their
country.
Norway Better Strategically
Norway is in a better strategical
situation, with all her eastern bor
der covered by Sweden, and her
'ong-stretchod Western coast wide
open to the Allied world. This en
ables the Norwegians to take a
bolder stand than the Swedes in re
gard to the international crisis, to
such an extent that their govern
ment leaders have not feared to
make public their choice between
East and West.
