# Tarawa Big Mistake Says Marine General
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 3 (/P) —General
Holland M. ("Howlin" Mad") Smith
of the Marine Corps said today the
Tarawa campaign in the South Pa
cific in 1943 was a mistake and a
"terrible waste of life and effort."
General Smith, now retired, whose
memoirs are being published in the
Saturday Evening Post, commanded
the sth Amphibious Corps during
the fight for the Gilbert Islands atoll
in which 900 of his men were killed
and 2,311 wounded.
He said Tarawa had little stra
tegic value and should have been
by-passed to "wither on the vine"
as were Rabaul and Truk in the
Central Pacific.
"From the very beginning," he
added, "the decision of the joint
chiefs (of staff) to seize Tarawa was
a mistake, and from the initial mis
take grew the terrible drama of er
rors—errors of omission rather than
commission, resulting in these need
less casualties."
General Smith said the pre-inva
sion bombardment of Tarawa by the
navy was insufficient. He recalls in
specting enemy defenses after the
Marines had secured the atoll:
"I entered every pillbox and
blockhouse on the western end of
the island and found only one had
been hit by naval gunfire and not a
single one destroyed. All of them
had to be destroyed by the Marines
with explosive charges and hand
grenades. Dead Japanese lay every
where, but they were killed by Ma
rines, not by naval gunfire or aerial
bombs."

General Smith also commented or
Maj. Gen. Ralph Smith, no relation,
who led one regiment of the 27th
Army Division in the capture of
Makin, at the northern end of the
Gilberts, while Tarawa was being
assaulted.
"Makin should have been cleaned
up in one day,"the author writes,
"but fighting dragged out three days
and chained me to this insignificant
skirmish ....
"When I returned to Pearl Harbor,
I reported to Admiral Nimitz that
had Ralph Smith been a Marine 1
would have relieved him of com
mand on the spot. His conduct of
the operations did not measure up
to my expectations in the slightest
degree."
The author recalls earlier skir
mishes with the navy and army and
says that when he came to Pearl
Harbor he was at first billeted in
quarters reserved for junior lieu
tenants. This he calls the "habitual
disregard of the navy for the Ma
rines." He was finally moved after
protesting.
Speaking of Lt. Gen. Robert C.
Richardson Jr., commander at the
time of army troops in the Pacific,
the Marine general says:
"His nickname was 'Nellie.' Rich
ardson caused more than a lifting oi
eyebrows when he decoratcd mem
bers of his staff with the Legion oi
Merit for what he termed the 'mas
sive planning' of the Makin opera
tion. All the approved plan foi
Makin came out of my office."
