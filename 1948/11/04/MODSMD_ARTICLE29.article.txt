## Why Prohibit Political Speakers 
### 
To the Editor:
We have just had another example of the ridiculousness of the polio
that prohibits political speakers from appearing on campus. 1 refer, n
course, to the fact that Sen. Glen Taylor was refused permission to appc :n
on campus and so was forced to speak from the sidewalk at the Village
last Friday. His speech was heard by 500 students and apparently then
have been no dire results. (As of this writing, no one has attempted tc.
burn down Memorial Church).
It is my opinion that all political candidates should be allowed to express
their views on campus. This is of special importance today when our na
tion's press can hardly be considered a monument to objectivity. Our pres
ent policy of censorship is not only idiotic, it is also grossly unfair, unfair t<
the candidates as well as to the students. It is, of course, particularly
unfair to those candidates who must face an unfriendly press and arc
forced to rely to a large extent on personal appearance to present theii
views to the electorate.
Why in Heaven's name can't we hear polities discussed? We certainly
have the necessary intelligence and maturity to evaluate the argument
of all political parties and candidates. We certainly have the right to de
mand a presentation of all sides if we are to be expected to make ai
intelligent choice on election day.
Let's grow up, shall we? ED KERR
