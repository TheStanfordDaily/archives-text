# Farce of Present Electioneering
## 
### 
To the Editor:
How long is this farce, perpetuated by our present system of rum
paigning, to continue? How long are we going to persist in defacing tin
campus two or three times a year with utterly useless campaign posters'.'
Let's look at this whole question sensibly.
In the lirst place, one can hardly deny that 10 or 20 posters hanging
from the side of the Union, or a veritable forest of signs on Palm Drive
does very little to enhance the beauty of the campus. Although electior
committee has wisely attempted to restrict posters to bulletin boards, this
has, unfortunately, resulted in ridiculous confusion. He who gets his postei
up first now is almost sine to have it completely covered by those ol
his rivals. Let's get smart, and do away with the whole silly business.
After all, what does a poster saying "Vote For Joe Doaks" tell you
about Joe? Is it helping the voter to vote intelligently? Of course it isn't.
In fact, there is an increasing tendency to vote for the man who has
(he best publicity with utter disregard for his ability. This is not intelli
gent voting.
What is the remedy? Open The Daily for comments by (he candidates,
schedule more meetings where the candidates can speak; but let's do a\v,i\
with useless, uninformative, and expensive electioneering.
