# Sigma Chi Circus-time Means 'Come as You Are'
## 
### 
If you're having trouble disguis- 1
ing yourself to look like something
human, your troubles are over.
At least that's the word being
whispered around campus this j
week by the Sigma Chi's, who are
staging their big "come as you are" j
party tomorrow night at their j
house on the lower Row.
When asked for a statement !
about the dance, Sigma Chi social
chairman Ned Keller was quoted
as saying, "Ah . . ." (It is re
ported that Keller has been ren
dered speechless by the immensity
of the dance.)
Decorations for the festivities will
be in the circus theme, with the

dance scheduled to run from 9 to 1.
Music will feature Bob Brittan and
hi orchestra. Popcorn balls, pea
nuts, candied apples, hot dogs, and
other traditional circus food will be
served to the guests.
Intermission entertainment for
the dance will be provided by out
standing campus performers.
