# Frosh Stars Lead Farm Golf Tourney
## 
### 
First-round matches oi' the Stan
ford golf team's tournament have
been completed, and several new
faces appear among the list of lop
Farm linksmen.
Cully Ingram and Dick McElyea,
both of Palo Alto, won their first
round tests by convincing margins.
Both are freshmen, but despite this,
their past record indicates that they
would be able to step into varsity
roles if eligible.
Ei nie Kellbcrg and Bob Crozier
are two veterans who survived
first-round play. Bud Moe, another
letterman, was sidelined by illness.
According to Kellberg, chairman
of the tourney, it is too early to
make any definite predictions for
the coming season, but he is opti
mistic due to the large turnout for
the tournament.
