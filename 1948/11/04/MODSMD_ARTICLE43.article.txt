## Sports Scribes Howl For La Brucherie's Scalp 
### 
Add one more upset to the books.
The Southern California Football Writers have adopted a resolution
'expressing solid support and confidence in the coaches of the four major
teams in Los Angeles."
Two weeks ago the L.A. sports scribes wcie in a dither. The area had
four losing teams. The reporters concluded that poor coaching must be
the reason behind the poor showings.
Who To "Get?"
But the papers didn't know who to start in on first. Were they going
1 to "get'' Bert Laßrucherie, whose team had just lost 34 to 14 to Stanford?
Or was the fire to be built under Jeff Cravath, four-time Rose Bowl coach,
whose USC squad hadn't looked good against anybody this year. To add
to the confusion, the region's two major professional teams were having
poor seasons as well. Coach Jim Phelan of the Dons, and Clark Shaugh
nessy of the Hams must be included in any contemplated "purge" plans.
Now, three weeks later, the Southern California football writers aren't
I going to "ket" anybody. Or so they say.
Confusing?
We must admit this confuses us. How could all four gel off the hook
1 within the relatively short span of a fortnight?
It's eaty to see how Cravath did it. Good games against Stanford and
California saved his contract. It's doubtful if he would have lost it
anyway. Takes longer than one season to bounce out a coach with his
record.
Phelan and Shaugnessy? Well, the Rams (2-3-1) and the Dons (5-4-0)
haven't been doing too badly. Both are considerably below expectations,
but still not too bad.
But how about Bert?
Low Against Beavers
I His team hit the all-time Coliseum low water mark in losing 28 to 0
jto Oregon State—a team which Cal had clobbered by six touchdowns the
previous weekend. Bertram was obviously their man. The scribes started
to work. Some again wondered aloud why UCLA hadn't been able to
win more than five last year.
Laßrucherie blamed the line. He fired line coach Ray Richards at the
I end of last season—an unpopular move with both the players and the press.
Richards was a good coach.
The press blamed Laßrucherie—said he was making a scapegoat out
of Richards. ,
As 1948 losses began to mount, the "I-told-yo-so's" started to pour it on.
They dug up statistics showing that last year nine major opponents aver
aged less than two yards per carry against UCLA. This year, six oppo
j nents, including Idaho, have averaged nearly four yards rushing the
, Uclans.
There were rumors of resentment against Richards' successor, Shelby
I Calhoun. One scribe uncovered "testimony" from three or four UCLA
players, stating that Calhoun treated them like "slaves."
Laßrucherie was ripe. There could be no scapegoat this season. The
I sports columnists started drawing names like Crisler and Brown before
the eyes of their readers as possible successors.
Woh es Quiet Now
I But the wolves have apparently died down now. Maybe it was the win
. over Nebraska Saturday. It it was, the wolves were pretty easily satisfied.
UCLA was badly outgained by a team that has won only one game this
year. Maybe it was the rumors of a new "spirited" Bruin eleven re
sulting from a meeting at which Laßrucherie invited any dissatisfied
j player to turn in his suit. Whatever the reason, it now appears that there
j is a good chance that Laßrucherie will Awe his skin Tor another season.
