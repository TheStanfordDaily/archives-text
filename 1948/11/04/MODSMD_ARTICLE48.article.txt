# Indians Depart For West Point Game Today
## 
### JOHN HALL 
hirty-six of Stanford's up-and
ning varsity gridders planed out
Palo Alto early this morning,
tding for New York and a game
h the undefeated Army Mule.
■ plane ride takes only 12 hours,
the Indians will be in New York
iglit. They meet the West Point
there Saturday in Yankee Sta
in.
-nowing that they will face one
the nation's top football ma
es, Stanford went through a de
fined practice session last night,
rchie Schwartz didn't allow
ch rough stuff to take place, but
men worked long hours on both
ense and offense.
■.I Turriziani, bull-necked half
k, will captain the Cards when
y run onto the Yankee Stadium
S'ing field next Saturday. Al has
n drawing the starting assign
it at left half since the UCLA
le and has been playing a lead
part in Stanford's powerful
und attack.
Army Fourth in Nation
rmy will probably be the
?hest team the Indians will face
have faced all season. The sol
• boys are rated fourth best in
nation, and their own coach,
Blaik, has stated that this '48
ion of the Army Mule has as
h kick as the teams of the
lehard-Davis era.
.anford will not be at top
ngth for the contest, but the
id is mentally high for the
ic. They know that they will be
vy underdogs, and one of their
>rite tricks is upsetting the form
•t.
ave Field, a defensive stand
tor the entire season, will not
much if any action. Joining him
he doubtful list is guard Bobby
rer. Both are suffering from
ful hip pointers. End Gene
tin is being bothered by a
ilder malady.
therton Phleger, rugged tackle,
also miss the game, as will Don
us. All of which reduces the
reserve power to a bare mini
n.
Campbell to lie join Team
:>n Campbell, the rock-'em-and
- 'em defensive quarterback,
rejoin the team in New York,
has been in Los Angeles, at
ing the funeral of his mother
was killed in an automobile
jnt last Sunday. Campbell wil!

catch a plane in Los Angeles, and
will be back with the team in lime
to test the Yankee Stadium turf
sometime Friday afternoon.
Saturday's clash will be the most
important intersectional match for
Stanford since the Michigan game
in Ann Arbor last season. Feeling
is running high for the game, al
though Eastern dopesters aren't
giving the Indians the slightest
chance.
Upset Not Impossible
A large crowd is expected to be
on hand, and the Indians wil": have
a great chance to pull off the upset
of the year. Those close to the
team think that it can be done.
Army, led by the Georgia Peach,
Gil Stephenson, is rated anywhere
from a 13- to an 18-point favorite.
The good Deke Houlgate calls it a
13-point Army ease-in, but there
are those who don't agree.
Frank Albert, who saw Army
bounce Harvard last month, says
the Indians can take the West
Pointers.
At any rate, Emery Mitchell and
Bob White and the entire team are
ready to give it a try. The amaz
ing Mitchell has been slowed up
all week with a cold, but he will
be in good shape for the Cadets.
Bob White Ready to Go
Bob "Whizzer" White is also
ready to roll Saturday. If he gets
running like he did against UCLA,
those New Yorkers will be as
stunned as they were when Truman
took Dewey.
The starting team will probably
be A 1 Laakso and Ken Rose at
ends, AI Rau and Gordon White at
tackles, and Jack McKittrick and
Don Fix at he guards. Jim Casta
gnoli, Stanford's "lineman of the
week" against Washington, should
open at center.
Aubrey Devine at quarter, Bob
White and Al Turriziani at halves,
and Emery Mitchell at full will
form the backfield.
