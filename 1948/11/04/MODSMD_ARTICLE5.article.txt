# Excom Discusses Farm Standard
## 
### 
Excom last night discussed the
place of the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code in student life.
Several discussion meetings be
tween student leaders and Admin
istration officials have been held
during the past two weeks on the
topic.
Such discussions. ASSU Presi
dent Gus Chavalas said, have been
in the form of oral '"thinking," and
no solutions or recommendations
have been made. One idea discussed
at these meetings, he said, was the
separation of the Honor Code from
the Fundamental Standard and
making the two laws independent
codes.
Problems arising under the Fun
damental Standard could be han
dled by a Fundamental Standard
Committee. Tom Diamond objected
to the creation of such an inde
pendent committee, but Bill Rose
suggested that a subcommittee
composed of Excom members might
be created to handle preliminary
Fundamental Standard business be
fore Excom reviewed it. Much time
would be saved by such a plan.
Excom reviewed the Farm liquor
prohibition law as it applies to the
Fundamental Standard. University
lawyers are reviewing Farm liquor
regulations, but it is expected that
some time will pass before a com
plete opinion can be handed down.
Excom approved six students for
the Student Health Committee:
Dave Batv, Paul McCollister,
Mary Kilbourn, Bob Baer, Ken
Cundy, and Joan Pomeroy.
The New Union Fund contains
$135,000 in cash plus pledged dona
tions not yet tallied.
The Excom room will soon be
re-decorated. Excom appropriated
$1,000 from its Maintenance Fund
for a new rug.
An ASSU by-luWs revision was
approved at last night's meeting.
From now on, the names of dances
and their patrons and patronesses
must be submitted to the ASSU of
fice before dates for the affairs can
be granted by Excom. This revi
ion is designed to prevent organi
zations and living groups from be
ing caught at the last minute with
out patrons and patronesses.
Excom went on record to say that
social rules will be enforced this
year. Such enforcement applies to
date applications and conduct at
and of social events.

zations and living groups from be
ing caught at the last minute with
out patrons and patronesses.
Excom went on record to say that
social rules will be enforced this
year. Such enforcement applies to
date applications and conduct at
and of social events.
Excom last night discussed the
place of the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code in student life.
Several discussion meetings be
tween student leaders and Admin
istration officials have been held
during the past two weeks on the
topic.
Such discussions. ASSU Presi
dent Gus Chavalas said, have been
in the form of oral '"thinking," and
no solutions or recommendations
have been made. One idea discussed
at these meetings, he said, was the
separation of the Honor Code from
the Fundamental Standard and
making the two laws independent
codes.
Problems arising under the Fun
damental Standard could be han
dled by a Fundamental Standard
Committee. Tom Diamond objected
to the creation of such an inde
pendent committee, but Bill Rose
suggested that a subcommittee
composed of Excom members might
be created to handle preliminary
Fundamental Standard business be
fore Excom reviewed it. Much time
would be saved by such a plan.
Excom reviewed the Farm liquor
prohibition law as it applies to the
Fundamental Standard. University
lawyers are reviewing Farm liquor
regulations, but it is expected that
some time will pass before a com
plete opinion can be handed down.
Excom approved six students for
the Student Health Committee:
Dave Batv, Paul McCollister,
Mary Kilbourn, Bob Baer, Ken
Cundy, and Joan Pomeroy.
The New Union Fund contains
$135,000 in cash plus pledged dona
tions not yet tallied.
The Excom room will soon be
re-decorated. Excom appropriated
$1,000 from its Maintenance Fund
for a new rug.
An ASSU by-luWs revision was
approved at last night's meeting.
From now on, the names of dances
and their patrons and patronesses
must be submitted to the ASSU of
fice before dates for the affairs can
be granted by Excom. This revi
ion is designed to prevent organi
zations and living groups from be
ing caught at the last minute with
out patrons and patronesses.
