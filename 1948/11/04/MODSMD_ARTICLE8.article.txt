# Weather Fair and Warmer As Dewey Evening Over
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
Reactions ranging from sheer ju
bilation on the part of the Demo
cratic supporters to total dejection
among ardent Dewey boosters were
evident on the Farm as the reali
zation that President Truman had
executed one of the biggest upsets
in American political history hit
home yesterday.
It was apparent that the major
ity of Stanford students were dis
appointed with the outcome. Dewey
buttons pinned to somber black
armbands were evident on Quad as
Republican boosters mourned their
party's defeat.
Typical attitudes on campus were
"xnressed in such comments as
these:
Janie Sanson: '"It's awful! I do
not want to be quoted."
Townsend Brown: "Considering
the choice given the people, maybe
the vegetarian candidate would
have been the best."
Dave Tay!or: "I would like to
have gotten the Republicans in, but

as long as we have a Democratic
Congress, I think that it's just as
well we have a Democratic Presi
dent too."
Overheard: "Truman's sort of a
thickhead; it's too bad he had to
be the consequence of all this."
Bud Lake: "Considering every
thing that happens between now
and 1952 will be the Democrats'
fault, I don't see how the Republi
cans can help but win next time."
John Shaefer: "I think that ev
eryone's surprised, including my
self. The Republicans were too con
fident, and didn't get out the vote
they should have."
George Brunn: "Dewey's defeat
shows that a candidate for Presi
dent can no longer hope to win by
merely coming out strongly for
motherhood. I don't think that
there will be any change in the
country's foreign policy and I look
for the domestic policy to be only
slightly more liberal."
Overheard: "Four more years of
haberdashery."
