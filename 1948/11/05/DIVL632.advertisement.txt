There's nothing ■ like a home
cooked meal.
When your wife is home—that's
true;
But when she is gone and you're
the cook
The foot's in a different shoe.
You could go out and eat alone,
But it doesn't seem the same;
So you'll agree next time she says,
"It's LONGBARN after the game."
—ERIE BOORMAN
Where in heck did the game
come from
In any case, though, could any
more be said?
It's
LONCBARN
after the (ja.-ne and anytime. Don't
forgot those students discounts
eiiher.
