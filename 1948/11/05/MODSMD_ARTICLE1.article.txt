# Truman Returns With 'New Deal'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (AP) — Victorious Harry Truman
marches in triumph back to Washington tomorrow to toss a
1948 model New Deal program at the next Congress.
And returns still straggling in from Tuesday's amazing elec
tion made it clearer than ever that the National Legislature con-

veiling in January will have a new
Democratic look From that Con
gress he can expect more sympathy
and respect, for himself and his
proposals, than he ever got from
the 80th, Republican Congress he
pounded all over the country.
While the President traveled hack
from the campaign, the usually ho
hum national capital hung out the
flags and hoisted the welcome ban
ners for a new political champion.
Truman Thanks Helpers
After weeks of gruelling campaign,
hundreds of speeches and thousands
of miles of travel, the Chief Execu
tive still hadn't run down. His mo
mentum produced more talks to
crowds at railroad stations along his
route. He thanked the people who
helped elect him.
Battered Republicans are sure to
put up an almost solid front against
his domestic program. For the most
part, the same GOP leaders will be
in control of party forces, men like
Robert Taft of Ohio and Kenneth
Wherry of Nebraska in the Senate,
Joseph. W. Martin of Massachusetts,
and Charls A. Halleek of Indiana in
the House.
At his North Attleboro, Mass.,
home, Martin said he personally
would be "glad to co-operate" with
Mr. Truman "to solve our problems
and build a stronger and better
America."
Combination Breeds Trouble?
But there could be trouble for the
President from a congressional com
bination of Republicans and South
ern Democrats. An alliance of that
kind scuttled many a White House
proposal in both the Roosevelt and
Truman administrations.
But those were the issues that
brought on the hot civil rights issues
—those measures proposed to curb
racial segregation, lynching, and poll
taxes. Republicans generally have
been pretty much for them.
But those were the issues that
brought on a Southern rebellion,
split the Democratic Party, and
swung 38 electoral votes of South
Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Alabama to States' Rights Demo
cratic Candidate J. Strom Thur
mond.
But Mr. Truman is committed by
campaign promises and his party
platform to a civil rights program
and to economic and social measures
that go even beyond the New Deal
of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
