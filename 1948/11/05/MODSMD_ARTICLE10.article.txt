# Army Detour May Halt Red Machine Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's revived football machine, roaring back up the
road to recovery, might find itself slightly detoured tomorrow
afternoon when it runs up against the highly favored Army
Mule in New York's Yankee Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for
2 p.m. (EST).
A capacity crowd is expected to be on hand to watch the

Cadets go after their seventh vic
tory of the season against the Stan
ford invaders from the West Coast.
The game is being tabbed as one
of the top intcrsectional battles of
the 1948 season, and 60,000 New-
Yorkers have planned to turn out.
Stanford's 36-man squad arrived
in New York last night at 10 p.m..
and immediately headed for its In
dian headquarters at the Concourse
Plaza, three blocks away from
Yankee Stadium.

The Stanford-Army game will
be aired over the Mutual Net

at 11:45. It will be broadcast lo
cally over KFRC until 1:45 p.m.
when it will be switched to KYA.

eral regulars, but Marchie Schwartz
thinks that he has come up with
suitable replacements.
Dave Field, defensive left haxf,
and guard Bobby Rohrer are not
expected to see any action, although
they both made the trip. Lineman
Pinky Pheleger and Don Lucas are
definitely out. Gene Martin, pass
catching end, should be ready to go
tomorrow after shaking off a shoul
der injury.
Stanford faces a real problem in
the quarterback department. With
Aubrey Devine still hobbling on a
tendon-strained ankle and Don
Campbell still not back with the


squad, the entire load might end up
on sophomore Tom Shaw. Against
Army, that's not so good.
Speed and Deception
Schwartz plans to throw a lot of
speed and deception at the West
Pointers. He figures that will be the
only way Stanford can take the re
serve-deep Cadets.
Figuring to play leading roles in
the speed department are three
fleet-footed halfbacks, Bobby White,
A 1 Turriziani, and Bill DeYoung.
The White Flash is the leading
Stanford ground gainer and is fourth
best on the Pacific Coast, with 6.6
yards per carry. At his best, he
could give Army plenty of trouble.
A 1 Turriziani, captain for the
Army game, is a ram-iod type of
runner with potential breakaway
ability. Bill DeYoung is probably
the fastest scooter of the trio, and
he seems to be improving with everv
game. Together, these boys could
supply the punch to take Army. .
And on top of them, Stanford is
relying mainly on Emery Mitchell,
the most versatile back on the Coast.
Mitchell missed most of practice last
week with a bad cold, but he is
okay now

Tomorrow's clash will be the third
time that Army and Stanford have
met on the gridiron The first time
was back in 1928 when the
invaded New York to shin Army,
26 to U Stanlora nad oeen uebpiacU
underdog that day, too, but Pop
Warner used enough of his moxie to
keep the Cadets fooied all afternoon.
Army came out to California in
1929 in hopes of avenging that loss,

34 to 13.
So now with Army flaying in its
own back yard and classed as the
fourth-best team in the countrv, the
Cadets will be in a fine position to
avenge their two previous losses.
But the surprising " Schwartzmen
might rise to the occasion. They
have done so before, and a win
would be sweet music indeed for
the ears of the local fans.

Stanford's revived football machine, roaring back up the
road to recovery, might find itself slightly detoured tomorrow
afternoon when it runs up against the highly favored Army
Mule in New York's Yankee Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for
2 p.m. (EST).
A capacity crowd is expected to be on hand to watch the

Cadets go after their seventh vic
tory of the season against the Stan
ford invaders from the West Coast.
The game is being tabbed as one
of the top intcrsectional battles of
the 1948 season, and 60,000 New-
Yorkers have planned to turn out.
Stanford's 36-man squad arrived
in New York last night at 10 p.m..

tomorrow after shaking off a shoul

Stanford faces a real problem in
the quarterback department. With
Aubrey Devine still hobbling on a
tendon-strained ankle and Don
Campbell still not back with the


squad, the entire load might end up
on sophomore Tom Shaw. Against
Army, that's not so good.
Speed and Deception
Schwartz plans to throw a lot of
speed and deception at the West
Pointers. He figures that will be the
only way Stanford can take the re
serve-deep Cadets.
Figuring to play leading roles in
the speed department are three
fleet-footed halfbacks, Bobby White,
A 1 Turriziani, and Bill DeYoung.
The White Flash is the leading
Stanford ground gainer and is fourth
best on the Pacific Coast, with 6.6
yards per carry. At his best, he
could give Army plenty of trouble.
A 1 Turriziani, captain for the
Army game, is a ram-iod type of
runner with potential breakaway
ability. Bill DeYoung is probably
the fastest scooter of the trio, and
he seems to be improving with everv

supply the punch to take Army. .

relying mainly on Emery Mitchell,
the most versatile back on the Coast.

thinks that he has come up with
suitable replacements.
Dave Field, defensive left haxf,
and guard Bobby Rohrer are not
expected to see any action, although
they both made the trip. Lineman
Pinky Pheleger and Don Lucas are
definitely out. Gene Martin, pass
catching end, should be ready to go
tomorrow after shaking off a shoul
der injury.
Stanford faces a real problem in
the quarterback department. With
Aubrey Devine still hobbling on a
tendon-strained ankle and Don
Campbell still not back with the


squad, the entire load might end up
on sophomore Tom Shaw. Against
Army, that's not so good.
Speed and Deception
Schwartz plans to throw a lot of
speed and deception at the West
Pointers. He figures that will be the
only way Stanford can take the re
serve-deep Cadets.
Figuring to play leading roles in
the speed department are three
fleet-footed halfbacks, Bobby White,
A 1 Turriziani, and Bill DeYoung.
The White Flash is the leading
Stanford ground gainer and is fourth
best on the Pacific Coast, with 6.6
yards per carry. At his best, he
could give Army plenty of trouble.
A 1 Turriziani, captain for the
Army game, is a ram-iod type of
runner with potential breakaway
ability. Bill DeYoung is probably
the fastest scooter of the trio, and
he seems to be improving with everv
game. Together, these boys could
supply the punch to take Army. .
And on top of them, Stanford is
relying mainly on Emery Mitchell,
the most versatile back on the Coast.
Mitchell missed most of practice last
week with a bad cold, but he is
okay now

Stanford's revived football machine, roaring back up the
road to recovery, might find itself slightly detoured tomorrow
afternoon when it runs up against the highly favored Army
Mule in New York's Yankee Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for
2 p.m. (EST).
A capacity crowd is expected to be on hand to watch the

Cadets go after their seventh vic
tory of the season against the Stan
ford invaders from the West Coast.
The game is being tabbed as one
of the top intcrsectional battles of
the 1948 season, and 60,000 New-
Yorkers have planned to turn out.
Stanford's 36-man squad arrived
in New York last night at 10 p.m..
and immediately headed for its In
dian headquarters at the Concourse
Plaza, three blocks away from
Yankee Stadium.
