road to recovery, might find itself slightly detoured tomorrow
afternoon when it runs up against the highly favored Army
Mule in New York's Yankee Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for
2 p.m. (EST).
A capacity crowd is expected to be on hand to watch the

Cadets go after their seventh vic

The game is being tabbed as one
of the top intcrsectional battles of
the 1948 season, and 60,000 New-

Stanford's 36-man squad arrived

and immediately headed for its In
