Final preparations are being
made for the signing ol' the an
imal Big (lame contract, ASSIJ
President Gus Chavahts an
nounced yesterday.
The pact, first drawn up in
1936, was created to avoid any
occurrence that might endanger
the friendly relations between C'al
and Stanford.
The agreement provides, "There
shall he no 'invasions' of the other
campus . . . and the students
participating in such violations
will he suh'ect to severe disci
pline."
The interpretation of "severe
discipline" is left up to Men's
Council. The ASSU Constitution,
however, provides for penalties
up to expulsion for violation of
the contract.
