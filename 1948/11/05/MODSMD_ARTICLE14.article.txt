The Stanford Fire Department was
called at 10:13 yesterday morning to
a smoke investigation at the Hoover
Library. The department was called
when smoke began to fill the 10th,
11th and 12th floors of the build
ing.
Investigating firemen found that
sparks from a welder's torch on the
9th floor had filled some nearby
wrapping paper with smoke. The
smoke was being drawn through
the air ventilators to other parts
of the tower. No damage was re
ported.
