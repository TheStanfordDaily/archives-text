# Farm Researcher Develops New Oil Location Method

### JACK VARTY 
The issue of ' Life" magazine cur
rently hitting the newsstands is
carrying a story on the new method
of seismic oil location developed by
Dr. Thomas C. Poulter. associate di
rector of the Stanford Research In
stitute. This announcement came
yesterday from Dr. Harold Vagtborg,
president of the Institute of Inven
tive Research in San Antonio, Texas.
"Life" Story
The story on Dr. Poulter's new
method of oil exploration is only
part ol "Life's" main' story on the
Institute of Inventive Research. This
San Antonio establishment, endowed
by Tom Slick, Texas oil producer
and rancher, has sponsored Dr. Poul
ter's work.
Before his new method, seismic oil
location consisted of firing single,
large charges of explosive in a shot
hole at various depths beneath the
surface.
Energy Absorbed
Dr. Poulter says that a major por
tion of the energy was absorbed
within one or two feet of the ex
plosion, and that a surface wave
or "ground roll" was caused which
not only interfered with the seismic
recording instruments but also dam
aged nearby buildings.
Dr. Poulter's main change has
been to remove this explosive from
the shot hole and to place it, and
more like it, on stakes close to the
ground. The explosive charges are

smaller, specially shaped, and ar
ranged in a hexagutial design ot
seven, thirteen, or nineteen points,
with one charge in the center. The
comparatively light charges art
placed from five to 85 feet apart, de
pending on the type of seismic rec
ord sought. They are all detonated
simultaneously.
Eliminate Shot Hole
By eliminating the shot hole. Dr.
Poulter has made oil exploration
faster and more economical. Opera
tions can now be conducted over
water without great loss to marine
life. Oil may be found in terrain
where shot holes previously could
not be dug.
Wasted energy is greatly reduced
and concussion effect on nearby
buildings is almost negligible. Dr.
Poulter says. He adds. "The method
also includes the use of special
shapes and arrangements of charges
enabling clear reflections to be ob
tained even under conditions where
reflections are difficult or impos
sible to obtain using ordinary tech
niques."
