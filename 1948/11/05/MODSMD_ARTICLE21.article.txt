PARIS. Nov. 4 (A I ).—The West
ern powers won overwhelming ap
proval in the United Nations As
sembly today for their internation
al atomic control plan.
This first major decision in the
Assembly's 1948 session was taken
over bitter Russian protests. So
viet Deputy Foreign Minister An
drei Y. Vishinsky said there v/as no
point in new consultations on atom
ic control, since no basis for East-
West agreement exists.
The Russian proposal, which the
Assembly rejected today, called for
a treaty banning the atomic bomb
and a separate pact setting up con
trols. The treaties would become
effective at the same time.
Meanwhile, the United Nations
Security Council, in a resolution,
called on Israel to withdraw from
positions won in the recent offen
sive in southern Palestine. This ac
tion was taken after adoption of an
American amendment to a resolu
tion eliminating any threat of sanc
tions.
It was the first American move
in the Palestine case since Tues
day's election. An authoritative
source said Washington was noti
fied in advance, and "presumably"
the general principles embodied in
the U.S. amendments were shown
to President Truman.
