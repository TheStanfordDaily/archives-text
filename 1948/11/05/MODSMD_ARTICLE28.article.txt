# Bellboy Makes Error; Team Loses Uniforms
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4 (,Pi.â€”
The Fresno Falcons ice hockey team
may have to play their next game
in their underwear. Here's why:
As the team checked out of a
hotel here today to leave for Fresno,
Coach Bob Gracie told a bellhop to
load the uniforms and equipment
into the trunk of the team's Pack
ard car. The bellboy later reported
that he had.
When the group reached Fresno
and opened the trunk, it was emp
ty. Gracie believes that somewhere
in Southern California some unsus
pecting Packard owner has a trunk
full of the Falcons' gear.
