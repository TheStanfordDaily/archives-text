# Stanford Social Round-Up
## Devonshire Dance 
### 
Contrary to campus opinion, the
junior class clance is NOT:
1. Closed.
2. A folk dance. You can leave
your quadrille instructions at home.
3. A formal affair. This is strictly
date dress.
4. Way out in the boondocks. San
Carlos is not very far.
The Devonshire Daunce (or
"dance" for those not afflicted with
nasal stoppage) is TONIGHT from
9 to 1 at the Devonshire C'.ub in
San Carlos. The club is very plush,
according to Mort White, class
president. At either end of the main
room are two fireplaces, and big
windows afford a view of the whole
Peninsula — from San Francisco to
San Jose.
Bert Whiting's orchestra will
supply the music, and two famous
entertainers will regale the guests
at half-time intermission. Refresh
ments will be served all evening.
Tickets to the dance are $3, and
are being sold today in front of
the Cellar and at Engineering cor
ner. Don't miss out on "Ye Olde
Devonshire Daunce" (it's fine for
romaunce) —get your ticket now!
