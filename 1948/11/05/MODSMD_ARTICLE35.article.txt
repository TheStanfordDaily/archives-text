# Egan, With Strong Support, Wins Approval for 'Othello'
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The last and loudest curtain call
for a superb performance as Othel
lo appropriately came last night to
Richard Egan, who carried his au
dience with him through extremes
of sympathy and fear.
Showing excellence in every ges
ture, he held the peak of the au
dience's emotion, but he alone did
not carry the brunt of the play.
"Othello's" opening in Memorial
Auditorium brought forth as strong
a cast as has been seen on the
Stanford stage for some time.
Jane Mac Arthur. making her
debut on the Players' stage, is one
actress Stanford will see a lot of
in the next few years, judging by
her extremely convincing perform
ance last night.
Up to the time of Rodrigo's death,
Co'ey Newman as the perfect evil
doer was probably the most un
hated villain on record. But it was
the laugh in his voice, his com
plete assurance of his own devil
ishness. which made his part so en
tertaining. As the direction of his
revenge took its shape, he added
intensity to his part —and the sum
was a very difficult role very well
enacted.
Particular mention should go to
Douglas Russell as the frantic fa
ther and to Ruth Fisher, who gave
added punch to already spunky
lines.
Wil'ard Welsh as the sulky sim
pleton stole every scene he en
tered. while Morgan Stock as
Othello's first lieutenant showed up
best in the drinking scene.
Unlimited praise goes to Delford
F. Brummer, technical director, for
the effective and unusual lighting
and general stage composure. The
technical department scored a par
ticular triumph in the storm scene
at the Cyprus wharf, with floating
cloud wisps and sound effects, all
most convincing.
Costuming for the play proved a
renl pleasure for the theater-goers,
as brilliant and unusual color and
style combinations graced the staqc.
Music for the production was dis
tinctly background material this
time. It created the mood without
coming to the front.
With a combination of various
stage and movie techniques. Dr. A.
Nicholas Vardac was able to keep

the action moving and the suspen
sion mounting in one of Shake
speare's best dramatic works.
There were few flaws in the pro
duction, but the audience was aud
ibly amazed when Cassio. after be
ing stubbed in the leg and writhing
m pain, nimbly jumped to his feet
to fight again.
In starting out their subscription
season this year, the Players' in
deed did themselves proud.

Othello's first lieutenant showed up
best in the drinking scene.
Unlimited praise goes to Delford
F. Brummer, technical director, for
the effective and unusual lighting
and general stage composure. The
technical department scored a par
ticular triumph in the storm scene
at the Cyprus wharf, with floating
cloud wisps and sound effects, all
most convincing.
Costuming for the play proved a
renl pleasure for the theater-goers,
as brilliant and unusual color and
style combinations graced the staqc.
Music for the production was dis
tinctly background material this
time. It created the mood without
coming to the front.
With a combination of various
stage and movie techniques. Dr. A.
Nicholas Vardac was able to keep

the action moving and the suspen
sion mounting in one of Shake
speare's best dramatic works.
There were few flaws in the pro
duction, but the audience was aud
ibly amazed when Cassio. after be
ing stubbed in the leg and writhing
m pain, nimbly jumped to his feet
to fight again.
In starting out their subscription
season this year, the Players' in
deed did themselves proud.
The last and loudest curtain call
for a superb performance as Othel
lo appropriately came last night to
Richard Egan, who carried his au
dience with him through extremes
of sympathy and fear.
Showing excellence in every ges
ture, he held the peak of the au
dience's emotion, but he alone did
not carry the brunt of the play.
"Othello's" opening in Memorial
Auditorium brought forth as strong
a cast as has been seen on the
Stanford stage for some time.
Jane Mac Arthur. making her
debut on the Players' stage, is one
actress Stanford will see a lot of
in the next few years, judging by
her extremely convincing perform
ance last night.
Up to the time of Rodrigo's death,
Co'ey Newman as the perfect evil
doer was probably the most un
hated villain on record. But it was
the laugh in his voice, his com
plete assurance of his own devil
ishness. which made his part so en
tertaining. As the direction of his
revenge took its shape, he added
intensity to his part —and the sum
was a very difficult role very well
enacted.
Particular mention should go to
Douglas Russell as the frantic fa
ther and to Ruth Fisher, who gave
added punch to already spunky
lines.
Wil'ard Welsh as the sulky sim
pleton stole every scene he en
tered. while Morgan Stock as
Othello's first lieutenant showed up
best in the drinking scene.
