# SIRO's Person to Person Relief Program Will Ease International Student Hardships
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
Next week SIRO solicitors will
try to collect $12,000 to be used for
local, national, and international
relief. Over half the drive receipts
will be allocated to international
organizations. It is the purpose of
this article to explain where the
money goes, what it is used for, and
who handles the distribution.
World Student Service Fund
WSSF is the U.S. contribution to
the world-wide organization. World
Student Relief. The WSR has been
meeting the war-created needs of
students by pooling all resources
available.
For eight years projects have
been carried on across national
boundaries to case the pressure of
student need. In addition to emer
gency relief. WSR contributes funds
for student co-op hostels, stores,
and health services because the cost
of an education is ioo high for many
potential leaders, especially in India
and China.
Student relief centers have been
one of the most successful WSR
projects. At the centers physically
or psychologically unhealthy stu
dents can regain their strength and
hope. The first relief center was
established at Combloux, France.
Six more are now in operation in
Europe and Burma.
Care of the DP students has be
come a major problem. There are

over 5.000 of these refugee students
in Germany alone. WSR helps in a
small way by donating libraries to
DP centers, and by selecting stu
dents for sanitarium treatment.
WSR also chooses a few students
for foreign scholarships each year.
Twenty per cent of the SIRO
drive receipts will go to the World
Student Service Fund.
Education and Rehabilitation Fund
Universities and other institu
tions abroad will be able, through
the fund, to replace or procure
some vitally needed educational
material, to supply inadequate diet
rations, and to aid youth rehabili
tation centers.
Distribution is based on surveys
of individual needs. Surveys are
conducted by both national and in
ternational organizations — UNES
CO. the International Student Serv
ice, the World Student Service
Fund, the Committee for Interna
tiona! Educational Reconstruction,
the Brethren, and the Stanford Stu
dent Survey Mission.
The Stanford Fund is a non-gov
ernmental people -to - people pro
gram aimed to meet specific needs.
It will bring Stanford into associ
ation with many more universities
and individuals throughout the
world than would be possible
through any one project. Last
year's project, the University of

Naples, will st ill be earned on
through the fund, however.
Administration of the fund will
be in the hands of SIO and lIR.
The lIR will make the fund sub
ject to the supervision of the stu
dent manager and to the continuous
review of Excom.
One - fourth of the total SIRO
drive receipts will go toward the
Stanford Educational Rehabilitation
Fund.
UN Appeal for Children
Three major tasks were left to
the UN Appeal for Children—to es
tablish in the minds of the public
a non-governmental approach to
relief work, to solicit money and
supplies, and to establish distribut
ing machinery abroftd. Twenty per
cent of SIRO drive receipts will uo
to UN.
