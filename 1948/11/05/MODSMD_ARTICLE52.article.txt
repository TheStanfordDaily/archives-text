112 their monthly salary for each
par of service.
Employees of universities are not i
present covered by the federal j

ary $180 monthly, with 10 years of
service. Assuming no salary .change,
she would receive on retirement at
age 68:
Tor past service—
1.25'. of $180 =$2.25X8
years (10 less 2) $18.00
For future service—
1.40' i of $180 = $2.7$ X IS
years ' .$48.60
Total $66.60
Example 2
A male employee, age 55. salary
$240 monthly, with 10 years of
service. Assuming no salary change,
he would receive on retirement at
age of 70:
For past service—
1.25' 112 of $240 = $3.00X8
years (10 less 2) $21.00
For future service—
1.50' r of $240 = $3.60 X 15
years $54.00
Total $72.00
