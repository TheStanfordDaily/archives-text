## Freedom of the Press 
### 
One of the Wallace platform planks is that he and the Pro
gressives are the only ones standing up for freedom of the press.
The Wallace followers go to some ridiculous extremes to stress
:he point.
Two girls at Stanford are Wallace supporters. But their par
ents, who are radio writers, told them they must not go to Wal
lace meetings or write anything about Wallace—for fear of
costing their parents' jobs.
A Stanford woman writing the reasons for her choice of Wal
lace in the election round-ups said she was for Wallace "be
cause I don't want to be put in jail for writing this article."
A few examples will help to refute claims about a controlled
press, examples right here at Stanford.
Certainly if any press were to be controlled it would be the
Stanford Daily, as an organ of the Associated Students, and part
ot a private university—which is, and should be, run as a
private institution.
But there are no controls on The Daily whatsoever. A gradu
ate student in journalism researching for an eastern magazine
was astonished to find the paper and student government, so
completely unfettered.
As a matter of fact, it works the other way. Last week The
Daily "sat" on a story for a few days while checking up on de
tails. It was never intended to withhold the story. But in the two
days' time we held the story we received calls from the Dean's
office, the Director of Information, and students' organizations
involved—all saying to publish the story by all means.
Some of Wallace's working people who are supposed to be
concerned about freedom of the press have a good deal less
integrity in the matter than would be supposed. Last year
Sigma Delta Chi held a bull session with organizers fro-ii the
Newspaper Guild. In that bull session the organizers apologized
all over the place for their employers and for slanting their
stories. (They were roundly chastized by the journalists' or
ganization.) But the point is that the organizers were interested
more in the fat pay check and security offered by an associa
tion of writers than they were in promoting more honest re
porting.
The classic cry about the controlled press is that newspaper
publishers have the same interests as big business, hence the
same point of view. Granted, but no news can be withheld
for long. And American competition is responsible for that.
If one wire service prints bum dope, it is immediately called
:o accounts by another service.
But, why are we wasting v/ords? One has only to compare
:he American press with any abroad to see how remarkably free
our press really is.

cause I don't want to be put in jail for writing this article."
A few examples will help to refute claims about a controlled
press, examples right here at Stanford.
Certainly if any press were to be controlled it would be the
Stanford Daily, as an organ of the Associated Students, and part
ot a private university—which is, and should be, run as a
private institution.
But there are no controls on The Daily whatsoever. A gradu
ate student in journalism researching for an eastern magazine
was astonished to find the paper and student government, so
completely unfettered.
As a matter of fact, it works the other way. Last week The
Daily "sat" on a story for a few days while checking up on de
tails. It was never intended to withhold the story. But in the two
days' time we held the story we received calls from the Dean's
office, the Director of Information, and students' organizations
involved—all saying to publish the story by all means.
Some of Wallace's working people who are supposed to be
concerned about freedom of the press have a good deal less
integrity in the matter than would be supposed. Last year
Sigma Delta Chi held a bull session with organizers fro-ii the
Newspaper Guild. In that bull session the organizers apologized
all over the place for their employers and for slanting their
stories. (They were roundly chastized by the journalists' or
ganization.) But the point is that the organizers were interested
more in the fat pay check and security offered by an associa
tion of writers than they were in promoting more honest re
porting.
The classic cry about the controlled press is that newspaper
publishers have the same interests as big business, hence the
same point of view. Granted, but no news can be withheld
for long. And American competition is responsible for that.
If one wire service prints bum dope, it is immediately called
:o accounts by another service.
But, why are we wasting v/ords? One has only to compare
:he American press with any abroad to see how remarkably free
our press really is.
One of the Wallace platform planks is that he and the Pro
gressives are the only ones standing up for freedom of the press.
The Wallace followers go to some ridiculous extremes to stress
:he point.
Two girls at Stanford are Wallace supporters. But their par
ents, who are radio writers, told them they must not go to Wal
lace meetings or write anything about Wallace—for fear of
costing their parents' jobs.
