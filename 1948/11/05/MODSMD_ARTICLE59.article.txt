X>ear Mom:
I'm beginning to appreciate the
meaning of college midterms now.
After a week of three major exams,
I'm pretty much down in the
dumps.
It didn't help when I got my first
two English A papers back either.
I had filled the space between the
margins with many words —mostly
misspelled. My instructor filled the
margins with many words—all un
favorable. Everything was ambig.,
•generaliz., sp., diet., or It made
me feel better when I learned that
John Steinbeck flunked every
Stanford English course he took.
I've decided my forte is ROTC.
Last week we received our M-l
rifles. We spent the first half-hour
of class breaking them down. Then
when the final buzzer rang, I com
pleted the reassembling. I did bet
ter than most of the fellows; I had
only one piece left over.

The following day whs ROTC
drill. We were scheduled to pass in
cview before General Clark. Ev
eryone had new uniforms except
one fellow. He stood outside the
gate in levis and an ROTC coat and
waved at the general as he rode by
in his limousine.
I p'ayed the trumpet in the band.
Someone shouted, "Sound adju
tant's call!" Nothing happened. A
whistle sounded. We all looked at
the female spectators. Several
whistles sounded. We blew adju
tant's call.
The general marched forward to
inspect the ranks. The band played
its swing version of "Missouri
Waltz." We received a new ar
rangement of "Sidewalks of New
York" last Monday. On Wednesday
we sent it back.
My other classes have provided
nothing of interest except a very
attractive Biology lab partner.
