These modern Romeos are in a >
laster league all around. It seems ;
that, year by year, the American i
males are getting bolder and bold- 1
er. You can tell by the way they
write their love letters.
According to a Chicago librarian,
modern love letters are franker I
and more straightforward than j
ever before in history. "Men get j
right to the point now, and confi- |
dentially," she continues, "it's a lot j
more interesting."
They make some of the classic '
lit of yesteryear look about as ap
pealing as a seed catalog in the j
r ront row of a burleycue house. In !
the Victorian era suitors spent I
themselves in essays of pretty noth- <
ngs. They would take six or seven
letters in leading up to saying "I
'ove you." They started their love
: ettcrs w' h "My dearest friend"
ind ended up with "My fondest al
"ections."
Change of Pace
Wei', that's all changed. Com
pare this with the love note ex- J
change of a sailor and his girl dur- |
ng this last war. The swabbie in J
joint sent a torrid letter back home j
with the outside marked in big red (
letters reading "inflammable." In I
•lis next mail he gets a return from |
the little woman with just ashes in I
it. Checkmate!
Whereas the old style was to
?vade the matter for several hun
dred words, today the accent is on
brevity. The world is moving too i
fast for frivolous expression. For- 1
mer General Orde C. Wingate. the i
founder of "Wingate's Raiders," i
first saw his wife when she was 15 |
and he 30. He was standing at the
rail of a liner when a beautiful j
Scottish girl approached him and
aid, "Yo" are the man I am going |
to marry."
The soldier looked at her in
surprise. "Right," he answered. ,
"When?" |
Two years later he received a I
letter containing just one word, j
"Now." And so they were married. !
Short and Sweet
One of the most beautiful letters j
to be made public during the great '
strife was one from a young war j
wife to her flyer husband. She |
wrote, "When I hear a plane over- j
head, my heart runs to the win
dow."
Another famous one comes from
the history archives. It reads. "You I
have inspired me with a love which I
has taken away my reason. I can't ;
eat. I can't sleep. You have filled j
me with an intoxicating frenzy, j
Never an hour passes without my j
looking at your portrait and never j
an hour passes without my cover
ing it with kisses." Recognize it? I
That's an excerpt from one of the \
Napo'eon to Josephine epistles. I
guess he liked her.
This war the lovers have really j
cone all out. They pulled the stops.
One U.S. Marine sergeant is said to
have received 98f< letters from the
same girl . . . and each one had a
different salutation and ending. An i
example was, "My tall terrific tan
talizing handsome heart throb." j
And I guess SHE liked lIIM.
A columnist philosopher named 1
E. M. Durling says that anyone 100 '
per cent in love, both before and j
after marriage, should, when sepa- ;
rated, write at least three letters a j
day, send two telegrams, and make |
one long distance call.
Venezuela ought to be the place
to start that. That government han- j
dies love 'otters at half price. They j
are distinguished from just mail by I
being enclosed in red envelopes.
'Dear John'
And no discussion on love let
ters would be complete without
something being said about the j
"Dear John." A prime example and
a prime answer came out of the
New Guinea battlefiont.
A sad-eyed corporal sat. besi V !
his bunk holding the letter from his
pirl who had just given him the
brush and was demanding her pic
ture back. He had become tenta
tively enraged to her at Fort Bragg
at the end of a whirlwind courtship
of five weeks.
But his tentmatcs came up with

the perfect answer to save face. A
short time later the girl in qvtestion
received a package from him with
tin attached note reading, "Will you
please pick out your picture and
return the rest? I'm sorry but I
can't seem to recall which one is
you." The package included an as
sortment of clothed (and other
wise) uietures of girls collected
from the men about camp — and
nmonp them, buried deep, was hers.
A perfect ending.
