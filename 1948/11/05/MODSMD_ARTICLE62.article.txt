## Union Planning Committee 
### 
To the Editor:
This letter is intended to present again the suggestions of the U
Planning Committee for the new union, Tresidder Union. These
only suggestions, and any comment from students, faculty, or irk
will be welcome.
The Committee started with two propositions. One was that we wai
to have the new Union as soon as possible; the other was that we did
want to go in debt to build it. So it seemed reasonable to propose th
be built, not all at once, but in units, as fast as the money was availab
The next question, of course, was "What do we build first?" The c
mittec's opinion is that a ball-room, more public eating facilities, and
offices for the ASSU and affiliated organizations should have first prio
A couple of smaller items that might be included in the first unit,
would be a trophy room and a central sales office.
One unit of the new Union to be built later might include co-rec
tional area, with a swimming pool, bowling alleys, etc., and ano
might be a publications building, perhaps with its own printing plant. H
ever, these are not definite suggestions of the Committee at this time.
Future use of the space in the Old Union presently occupied by A
offices must Ve considered, and the committee's suggestion is th;
might be used for additional lounge and game room space.
The committee puts these proposals forward to attract your attei
and opinion. We can be reached through the ASSU office, and we
appreciate your comments.
