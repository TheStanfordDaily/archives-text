# Rebuttal on Irish Partition
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Please permit me to answer Mr. Joe Cusick's letter in The Dail
Nov. 3, concerning Irish partition.
Mr. Cusick's statement that the people of Ireland have the "same n
cultural, ethnical, and fundamentally similar religious background
inaccurate and misleading. Unlike the majority of southern Irish)
the people of the northern six counties trace their ancestry to the En>
and Scottish Protestant settlers of the "plantation" period. The cultur
Ulster is more Anglo-Irish than Gaelic in nature. As regards relig
intolerance, the parochialism of southern Catholics is equalled onlj
the bigotry of northern Protestants. Orange parades in the North c
"12th of July," are openly and aggressively anti-Catholic. As a stu
of Irish affairs, Mr. Cusick no doubt will recall the recent incider
which certain County Galways farmers, at the instigation of the
Catholic clergy, closed their fields to the Galwfey Blazers because
assistant master-of-hounds was a divorcee.
Union would probably benefit Ulster financially—in that I agree
Mr. Cusick. But the young industries of the 26 counties would b
grave danger ol suffocation by the heavily industrialized North—as E
businessmen know and fear.
Mr. Cusick says in his letter, "the Catholics are the largest relit
s( ct in Northern Ireland as well, numbering 35 per cent of the populat
'Ihis statement is misleading in that it accents denominational distinc
among the Protestants.
It is true that, the Joint High Command did wish Eire to remain nei
in 1941. By 1843 the strategic outlook had changed and bases in
were needed by the Allies preparatory to the liberation of Europe,
refused to abandon neutrality and join the United Nations.
It is strange that De Valera, Costello, and other advocates of union
engender little enthusiasm for their cause in either northern or sout
lieland. Yet a few inflammatory phrases in San Francisco, New \
or Boston whips Americans of Irish ancestry into a frenzy of outr
pride and patriotism for a land which the majority have never seen.
Finally, I thank Mr. Cusick for his definition of the phrase "li
American." Although born and reared in Ireland. I consider "Ameri
a proud title, sufficiently noble to stand by itself without a prefix, 1
"Irish" or anything else.
AL ALL!

To the Editor:
Please permit me to answer Mr. Joe Cusick's letter in The Dail
Nov. 3, concerning Irish partition.
Mr. Cusick's statement that the people of Ireland have the "same n
cultural, ethnical, and fundamentally similar religious background
inaccurate and misleading. Unlike the majority of southern Irish)
the people of the northern six counties trace their ancestry to the En>
and Scottish Protestant settlers of the "plantation" period. The cultur
Ulster is more Anglo-Irish than Gaelic in nature. As regards relig
intolerance, the parochialism of southern Catholics is equalled onlj
the bigotry of northern Protestants. Orange parades in the North c
"12th of July," are openly and aggressively anti-Catholic. As a stu
of Irish affairs, Mr. Cusick no doubt will recall the recent incider
which certain County Galways farmers, at the instigation of the
Catholic clergy, closed their fields to the Galwfey Blazers because
assistant master-of-hounds was a divorcee.
Union would probably benefit Ulster financially—in that I agree
Mr. Cusick. But the young industries of the 26 counties would b
grave danger ol suffocation by the heavily industrialized North—as E
businessmen know and fear.
