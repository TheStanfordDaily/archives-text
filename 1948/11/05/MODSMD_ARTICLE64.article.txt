Cartographers are color - blind. ,
They're still splotching away with j
a nationalistic paint-pot. forgetting |
that a new empire is shaping before j
our eyes.
Let's make a realistic map.
Pencil in red those countries con
trolled by the USSR. Fill in Bul
garia. Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Po
land, Yugoslavia, and Albania. Move
across Asia—to Korea about the 38th
parallel, and north China . . . and
down through the "potentials,"
Java, Indo-China, Indonesia, Bur
ma; down to the "ripe countries,"
through Central America—shade in
"probably wills" and the "perhaps
so."
You've drawn a new empire—a j
new imperialism that has banded ;
together the greatest staff of ideo
logical hucksters in world history. |
You've drawn an empire that Na- i
poleon dared for—that Britain spent I
100 years colonizing — that Rome |
would have approved.
Now 'et's date this empire—coun- i
try by country. Since 1917 A.C.,
"Advent of Communism," there has
grown up an empire colossus.
We are the witnesses to history, !

to the accelerating rise of a t
imperialism. It is not an en
measured in square miles or i
tier outposts. This is the 20th
tury model of imperialism:
places first emphasis on minds,
ter come land and resources.
This imperialism conquers
an idea. An idea which is a g
mis-shapen Jimmy Valentine,
its hands on the tumblers of
tional conscience. An idea w
has a habit of rifling even the
secure and most sacred safe:
their national security—and spi
their contents into heaps of
trinal confusion.
It is an imperialism that
snatched from democracy that
namic force which pushed
through a historical evolutior
past years.
.To all this wc bear witnes.'
an idea which has engenderec
empire far greater than the w
has known before.
this is what your map hi
Whether we like it or not. we 1
to admit the facts. That in :'>l y<
since 1917, an idea has crossed
lonial frontiers and national boi
aries—and has won an empire.
You've only to look at the ih
dling world markets still opei
that product we call "demoer
to see how effective this new
perialism is.
It is one thing to fight a tani
force; it is quite another to figh
idea. Ideas have a way of asi t
ing to martyrdom.
The map we have drawn ha
historical predecessors. But
speaks more 20th - century t
than most of us would like to
lieve.
