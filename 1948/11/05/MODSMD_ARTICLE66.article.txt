# Card Water Poloists Tangle with Bruins
## 
### 
Tied for the conference lead with
USC, the Stanford water poloists
will battle the inexperienced but
game UCLA Bruins in a Pacific
Coast Conference game today at
3:30 p.m. in Encina Pool.
The Indians and Bruins have
played one game this year, a 9 to
5 contest which the Cards won
down at Los Angeles. Coach Tom
Haynie's defending champions will
be at full strength for the UCLA
contest, and will be favored to win.
