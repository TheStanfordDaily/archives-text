# Daily Sportcasters Jibe, But Fail to Pick the Tribe
## 
### 
For once the prognosticators hope
-hey re wrong! They hope they're
wrong because they've picked
Army to beat Stanford in Yankee
Stadium tomorrow.
But the Black Knights look to
nave too much for Marchie's im
proving "kids'" to handle. Try as
:iard as they may, the scribes just
.an't see a Stanford upset although
hey did shave down the expected
lifferc-ntial from 20 to 8 points. So,
. eluctantly, it's Army by S points.
In the game over at Berkeley the
pickers figure to strengthen their
impressive .800 average by tabbing
Cal to run roughshod over the
Westwood Weaklings. Cal by 3!5
points.
Elsewhere it's:
USF over Loyola by 20 points. The
Lions are mighty weak.
