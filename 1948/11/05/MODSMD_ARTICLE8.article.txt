# SIRO Begins Relief Drive Monday
## 
### 
Shoes — old shoes, new shoes,
wooden shoes, leather shoes, sturdy
shoes, and just some old pieces of
leather and rags—will greet students
Monday morning beside cash regis
ters in the Cellar, tlie Bookstore, and
in the "holes" in the various living
groups.
SIRO is placing these several types
and conditions of shoes at such stra
tegic spots about campus in hopes
that concrete examples of what is
needed by people in the devastated
countries of the world will persuade
Farm students that the Stanford
Relief Drive has a better use for
their change than they do.
These shoes are one of the several
ways devised fcy SIRO to make giv
ing a dollar and a half or more to
the Stanford Relief as painless as
possible.
Last night at the Relief Drive's
Solicitors' Rally Gretchcn Blaesing
and Alf Heller, co-chairmen of the
drive explained what was to be done
with all the money collected in tlv
drive and gave instructions to the
solicitors.
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Union
Court Thursday the YWCA will sell
homemade fruit turnovers, made by

the advisory board of the YWCA,
which will sell for 10 cents apiece.
Thursday evening dime-dinners
will be on the agenda in all campus
living groups. The dimes thus col
lected will eventually help pay for
meals for some European student.
Friday afternoon, an auction will
be held on the steps of Cubberley
Auditorium. Chairman of the auc
tion, Nancy Doll, reports that such
items as a golf ball autographed by
Bing Crosby, pictures of shmoos,
autographed by A 1 Capp, and a loot
ball autographed by Frankie Albert
will be sold. A short preview rally
will be held beforehand.
Saturday evening the "Frontier
Fro'ic Dance" will be given in the
Women's Gym at 9. All proceeds will
go to the drive.
A short movie, "Passport to No
where." is to be shown every ami
noon in Cubberley Auditorium. The
movie is a "dramatic portrayal of
present needs abroad." Admission is
free.
