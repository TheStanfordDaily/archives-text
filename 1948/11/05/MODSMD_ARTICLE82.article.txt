## 
### 
HONOLULU. Nov. 3 <3>iâ€”Hawaii,
seeking to become the 49th state,
found today it had climbed onto the
wrong bandwagon.
It re-elected Republican Delegate
to Congress Joseph R. Farrington
by a 3 to 1 margin. Republicans
captured the Territorial House and
Senate.
Republicans campaign thus:
This is a Republican vear nation
ally.
Hawaii must have a Republican
delegate.
A Republican governor will be ap
pointed.
He will need a Republican Terri
torial Legislature.
The line went over big. With only
three of 168 precincts unreported,
Farrington won 73,544 votes to
Democrat Jack Burns' 24,136. Re
publicans won 9 of 15 senate seats,
20 of 30 house seats.
