THE SPACE
You Asked for It and Here
It Is Department
I saw her walking down the
street;
Her coat all shiny black.
I looked her over from the front;
She passed, and then looked back.
My heart leapt up when I beheld.
"That look" was in her eye,
And when I sidled up to her,
She gave a little sigh.
And still I've never held her hand
Or anything like that.
I'll bet you couldn't either, if—
Vou were a red tom-cat.
—BILL HUNT
Sort of a catty poem, don'cha
think?
But, if everything works out all
right, bring her down to
LONCBARN
for a pinch of catnip—'cause it's
got to be good.
