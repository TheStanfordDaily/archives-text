"Three-In-One" Drive
"Since this is the only 'all-in-one'
drive for foreign relief, $1.50 per
person isn't really too much," added
Heller. At least 65 per cent of the
total receipts will go directly to
foreign relief. The Palo Alto Com
munity Youth Fund will receive 30
per cent of the drive, and 5 per cent
will go to a floating fund.
The floating fund will be used for
the Cancer Drive, March of Dimes,
and TB campaigns. Distribution of
the Palo Alto Youth Fund will be

centered around the YWCA, YMCA,
and the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
Foreign relief will be mainly in the
form of school supplies, supplemen
tary food rations, and clothing. Allo
cations will be divided among the
World Student Service Fund, United
Nations Appeal for Children, and the
Stanford Education and Rehabilita
tion Fund.
Clocks in front of the Cellar will
record progress of the drive by liv
ing areas. First solicitors to report
100 per cent area contribution will
receive free tickets to the Varsity
Theater.
Special events include a Turnover
Sale sponsored by the YWCA Thurs
day and dime dinners in the living
groups that night. A rally at noon
and an auction at 4:15 p.m. Friday
