# DU PONT Digest For Students of Science and Engineering
## They said, "You can't do it!" 
### 
But Du Pout scientists
developed a synthetic rubber
with superior properties
"Synthetic rubber is an impossibility
at any price!" declared a noted Euro
pean scientist a number of years ago.
And most people were inclined to
agree because for more than a century
chemists had been unable to dupli
cate natural rubber.
Du Pont scientists knew that all
rubber had bad qualities as well as
good. "Why struggle to duplicate its
faults?" they asked. "Why not find
a new chemical compound with all
the good qualities of rubber, but
none of the bad?"
They took as their starting point
a discovery by Dr. J. A. Nieuwland
of Notre Dame in connection with
the polymerization of acetylene. By
modifying this process, they made
monovinyl acetylene. Adding hydro
gen chloride, they made a new chem
ical compound called chloroprene—
a thin, clear liquid at low tempera
tures. Like isoprene, it polymerized
to form a rubber-like substance. But
the new material, now known as neo
prene, required no sulfur for vulcani
zation and was superior to rubber
under many service conditions.
Today neoprene production is
measured in millions of pounds a

year, even though it is priced higher
than natural rubber. Hardly an in
dustry is not now using it, for such
good reasons as these: neoprene prod
ucts resist deterioration by oils and
greases. They stand up under expo
sure to direct sunlight. Their aging
and flame-retarding properties also
are superior to those of rubber.
Three types of Du Pont research
Modern research involves time,
money, manpower. To develop neo
prene. for example, took six years of
laboratory study, a research and de
velopment expenditure of millions of
dollars, plus the work of skilled re
search chemists, physicists, engineers,
and other scientists.
At D u Pont, research is con t i nuous.
Some of it is designed to develop new
products or processes; some to im
prove existing products or processes;
and the balance is fundamental re
search to uncover basic facts without
regard to immediate commercial use.
Each of ten manufacturing depart
ments has its own research staff and is
operated much like a separate com
pany. In addition, the Chemical and
Engineering Departments, which are
not engaged in manufacturing oper
ations, conduct research in the in
terests of the Company as a whole.
A typical Du Pont research team

may include physicists, chemists,
chemical and mechanical engineers,
each of whom brings specialized train
ing to bear on a specific phase of the
subject. The man who joins one of
these teams finds himself associated
with some of the ablest minds in the
profession and receives the oppor
tunity and friendly support needed
to make fullest use of his capabilities.

But Du Pout scientists
developed a synthetic rubber
with superior properties
"Synthetic rubber is an impossibility
at any price!" declared a noted Euro
pean scientist a number of years ago.
And most people were inclined to
agree because for more than a century
chemists had been unable to dupli
cate natural rubber.
Du Pont scientists knew that all
rubber had bad qualities as well as
good. "Why struggle to duplicate its
faults?" they asked. "Why not find
a new chemical compound with all
the good qualities of rubber, but
none of the bad?"
They took as their starting point
a discovery by Dr. J. A. Nieuwland
of Notre Dame in connection with
the polymerization of acetylene. By
modifying this process, they made
monovinyl acetylene. Adding hydro
gen chloride, they made a new chem
ical compound called chloroprene—
a thin, clear liquid at low tempera
tures. Like isoprene, it polymerized
to form a rubber-like substance. But
the new material, now known as neo
prene, required no sulfur for vulcani
zation and was superior to rubber
under many service conditions.
Today neoprene production is
measured in millions of pounds a

year, even though it is priced higher
than natural rubber. Hardly an in
dustry is not now using it, for such
good reasons as these: neoprene prod
ucts resist deterioration by oils and
greases. They stand up under expo
sure to direct sunlight. Their aging
and flame-retarding properties also
are superior to those of rubber.
Three types of Du Pont research
Modern research involves time,
money, manpower. To develop neo
prene. for example, took six years of
laboratory study, a research and de
velopment expenditure of millions of
dollars, plus the work of skilled re
search chemists, physicists, engineers,
and other scientists.
At D u Pont, research is con t i nuous.
Some of it is designed to develop new
products or processes; some to im
prove existing products or processes;
and the balance is fundamental re
search to uncover basic facts without
regard to immediate commercial use.
Each of ten manufacturing depart
ments has its own research staff and is
operated much like a separate com
pany. In addition, the Chemical and
Engineering Departments, which are
not engaged in manufacturing oper
ations, conduct research in the in
terests of the Company as a whole.
A typical Du Pont research team

may include physicists, chemists,
chemical and mechanical engineers,
each of whom brings specialized train
ing to bear on a specific phase of the
subject. The man who joins one of
these teams finds himself associated
with some of the ablest minds in the
profession and receives the oppor
tunity and friendly support needed
to make fullest use of his capabilities.
