### JOANN COHN 
When the new president of Stanford is selected, the news will

leading education journals in the country.

Outer Quad just off the Engineering corner. Director of the office
is Frederic O. Glover. Stanford '33. ♦

Immediately after the Board of
Trustees names the new president—
and there is no sign as yet that such
action is imminent —the story will
be prepared by Glover and his staff.
Hundreds of copies will be mailed
to newspapers, magazines, and radio
stations.
Results of the story, and of other
stories which are continually dis
tributed by the Director of Infor
mation's office, will pile up daily

erence.

ford news is distributed to both the
local and national press.

patrick's invention of an X-ray mi
croscope, construction of a new Mi
crowave Laboratory to house Dr.

ment of 43 new professors to the
faculty.
In addition to general University
news, the office also releases stories
of faculty honors and activities, and

the news.

newspaper man for 10 years follow
ing his graduation from Stanford.

vance before accepting the job of
