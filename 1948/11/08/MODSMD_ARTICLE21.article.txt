# Federalists' Aims Stated in Speech
## 
### DALE CHAMPION 
Harris Wofford Jr., first president
of Student Federalists, keynoted
[ the one-day Student Federalist In
j stitute held here yesterday under
| the auspices of the United World
Federalist Council of Northern Cal
j ifornia.
In his opening session talk. "Can
World Government Meet the Rus
| sian Challenge?" Mr. Wofford sug
! gested a course of action Federalists
{ might take in achieving world gov
! ernment without alienating or ex
! eluding the Russians from a federal
j world republic.
Oppose Present Program
"The present American bi-parti
; san program of peace "through
! bribery and military superiority
1 cither leads to defeat in war or to
1 American world domination," said
Mr. Wofford. He cautioned Feder
| alists to oppose this American tend
! ency just as they oppose the more
I ruthless kind of Soviet expansion.
Neither a Russian nor an American
world empire can be sanctioned, he
warned.
â€¢Middle World'
Four-fifths of the world, cited
Mr. Wofford, is neither American
I nor Russian. This major portion of
j the world, which he termed the
I "middle world," is an area of cyni
| cal and disillusioned peoples within
which the spark of world federal
ism could generate an awakening to
world union by "peaceful persua
; sion as the one objective worth
' working for."
The argument that the World
I Federalist elements of the "middle
world" joined with those of Amer
ica could offer more progressive
i ideals than the Soviet Union's goal

of world revolution and consequent
dictatorship of the proletariat, said
Mr. Wofford.
Winning the "middle world'' to
federalism dictates the general
strategy of the United World Fed
eralists. "World government must
come as a people's idea, not as a
program of the State Department,"
warned Mr. Wofford. To accomplish
this end. 100 members of the Brit
ish Parliament have proposed and
are working toward a world con
stituent assembly to be held in 1950.
Proposed World Assembly
The election of a government
that has as its major platform a
commitment to world government
must become the prime political is
sue for Americans, said Mr. Wof
ford. This is to be done in prepara
tion for the time when the proposed
world constituent assembly calls
for ratification by nations.
Mr. Wofford set the tone for the
institute's ensuing roundtable dis
cussions by saying, "Our goal is a
Federal World Republic to protect
and promote the development of a
free and just community; a union
of the world's people strong and
democratic enough to contain all
ideologies and forces in peaceful
competition under world law."
