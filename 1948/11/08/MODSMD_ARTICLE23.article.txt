## Give Til It Hurts 
### 
When you finish school and spend more of your time in the
big cities you'll be plagued for contributions for all manner of
charities, worthy and otherwise. Then you'll have to give some
thought to where your charity money goes. Here at Stanford,
however, relief drives are limited to one a quarter, and you
can be sure that each one is for a genuinely worthwhile cause.
First to come along—and important because it is Stanford's
personal responsibility—is the relief drive this week by the
Stanford International Relief Organization.
The SIRO drive is described as a person-to-person relief pro
gram. Funds will go to aid students abroad through the World
Student Service Fund and the Stanford Educational Rehabilita
tion Fund.
The hard-working SIRO solicitors have set an ambitious goal
of $12,000. They should be able to reach it. Surely, we who
have so much can find that amount to ease hardships abroad.
