# Big Game Dutch
## 
### 
One of Stanford's rustiest traditions is that of "Big Game
Dutch." Somewhere this really grand tradition has fallen into
almost complete disuse. Ask a girl if she believes in it and
she'll reply, "Nuts. Furthermore, if my date doesn't promise
a really hot time, I'll go with someone else."
Still the tradition lives on in the handbooks, Quads, histories,
and in the memories of oldtimers—and we'd like to see it re
vived. It's a friendly way for the girls to help the suffering
male and his aching wallet. The Rough stands treat most of the
year. And so it's no wonder the economists argue that women
control 70 per cent of the wealth—if.they never spend any of it.
Of course the tradition had its inception when Big Game
included a weekend at Rio del Mar as standard operating pro
cedure. Nevertheless, it's not too much to ask the gals to share
the bill one time a year, whether the fare be S5 or $100.
A word of caution to the man, however—be sure you don't
do business on a cash and carry basis. Couple of fellows tried
it last year, and here's what happened:
Their girls insisted on keeping with the Big Game Dutch
tradition—but they were broke. So they promised to pay back
the party drink for drink and dinner for dinner soon after the
first of the year when their bank accounts were fat with Christ
mas money.
Fate intervened. One of the girls became engaged during
Christmas vacation—to another fellow. The other girl became
engaged five days later—again to another fellow.
As Loeffelbein says, "Ya' can't win."
