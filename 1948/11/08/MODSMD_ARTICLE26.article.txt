To the Editor:
Today the ASSU starts its Relief Fund Drive lasting through Nov. 13.
What you give has been seen, as if by magic, to multiply many times
over: it fills human needs, but even more, it captures man's ideas. The
psychological effect of your efforts both here and abroad may well be
the most important contribution. Our support of Naples University has
encouraged many other schools to undertake similar projects; its concrete
example has been disseminated through speeches and publications of
our Department of State and the United Nations, as well as scores of
private organizations. The effect in Europe is just being told. This is
not a government plan; this is an expression of friendship from one
people to another, from one student community to another. To reach our
goals we need an average of $1.50 from each student, but remember,
this must last all yearâ€”less than half a cent a day.
There has been some question regarding why 30 per cent of the fund
is to be assigned to the Community Chest. The Executive Council of
the lIR feels strongly that if we are to conduct a sound international stu
dent program abroad we must secure our own institutions at home. Al
though we recommend slightly less a proportion for the Chest, we are
deeply concerned that such facilities as the "Y," the Community Center,
and health service be supported. However, if any student wishes to dis
tribute his contribution differently from that recommended, he may assign
any breakdown he chooses on the back of the pledge :'ard.
