# Poor German Government Aids Soviets
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
Unless the West acts quickly to
bring the German problem to an
end, it is highly probable that the
existing confusion will be the best
Russian trump in the event of a
new World War.
The Berlin crisis is by no means
a success for Uie Western powers.

Improving a n
old Hitler trick,
the Soviets have
efficiently black
mailed their for
mer allies, com
pelling them to
postpone all
plans in regard to
Germany's fu
ture while ne
gotiations are
proceeding — and

they have been proceeding since
July, whether in Moscow or in
Paris. How long will the bounce
continue? How long will the West
keep rejoicing complacently every
time Moscow proposes a new con
ference?
Our Western civilization is threat
ened by the most formidable dan
ger since Hitler's attempt upon it.
Yet, very few are those who, with
Winston Churchill, realize where
we stand.
Germany is the sore spot. Since
the bad faith of the Soviets has
made the quadripartite govern
ment unworkable, some regular,
permanent authority must take its
place. What is needed is a German
government.
Still a Foreign Rule
The American - British military
government has done its best in
spite of little means, taking its re
sponsibility to heart. But for the
Germans it is still a foreign rule to
which they can too easily pass the
buck when something, such as the
food situation, goes wrong. If to
morrow the Russians invade Bizo
nia, they will certainly take along
with them an all - ready German
Communist government which will
unavoidably attract and lure a good
number of Germans; whereas the
Allied governments' appeals to the
population will only meet indiffer
ence, if not hostility.
In the present situation of West
ern Germany, there are as many
occupation policies carried out as
there are occupying powers. Those
policies were established immedi
ately after the German surrender
at a time when the Soviet threat
was not apparent. By now, more
than three years after, they are as
inconsistent as they are foolish.
Army Best Teacher?
The United States put Germany's
denazification and democratic re
ducation in the hands of an organi
zation as undemocratic as an army,
even the pseudo - democratic U.S.
Army. To people who, for 200
years, had known nothing but the
pan-Germanist philosophy of Fred
crick the Great, Bismarck, Wilhelm
11, and Hitler, a quick, toilless
three - year course on democracy
was offered. To homeless, starving,
unemployed people, the bright pic
ture of a capitalist, free-enterpris
ing paradise was brought out.
Hampered by her own financial
troubles, Britain, on the contrary,
could propose nothing but social
ization— an austere policy which
was badly received by the German
factories war - smashed or closed
through lack of raw material (Ed.
note: or carried off to Russia).
Trance, hypnotized by the five
German invasions she had known
in the past 160 years, saw in the
occupation the long - awaited re
venge. The French experienced no
rest until they were able to gain
possession of the Saar, and then
they stubbornly blocked all British
and American attempts to raise the
industrial level of the Ruhr, West
Germany's only economic asset.
Small Nations No Hotter
I he policies of the small nations
were in no way better. While Hol
land and Belgium are now rightly
claiming that the inactivity of the
Ruhr means a considerable loss to
the warehouse trade of their na
tional ports. Rotterdam and Ant
werp, they had previously suggest
ed opposite measures, such as ter

ritorial claims (Holland) and heavy
reparation deliveries (Belgium).
Even Denmark did not give up her
claims on tho German South Schles
wig until recently.
Although in regard to economic
co - operation, Bizonia finally has
been included in the ERP program,
in the political field nothing has
been done. Since the Germans
themselves want the Allied troops
to remain among them in order to
protect their country—and at the
same time Western Europe— from
Soviet aggression, there should be
no fear in giving the Germans a
free hand in their own affairs.
