## Bull Session 
### 
ANNOUNCER: And now it's time for your Monday morning episode
of "One Mail's Family," the story of Mother and Father Barber and then
eight little shavers.
As you remember, Father Barber, a San Francisco capitalist has

been in trouble with the government recently over some
shady dealings on his rubber plantation. In fact, he
has just returned from doing a stretch.
As today's scene opens, Mother Fannie Barber has
just finished breaking daughter Hazelnut's left arm
in three places. Hazlenut has committed an unpar
donable sin.
FANNIE: Stop that arm from bleeding on the rug
and answer me, Hazlenut! Why did you do it'' Whv"'
Why? Why?
HAZLENUT: I don't know, mother. He just seemed
so nice.

FATHER: Nice, schmice! That's no reason for doing this to your mother
and me. And just how do you think this is going to look in a few months?
HAZLENUT: But, lather, he said he approved of labor!
FATHER: So he approves of labor. Who is going to pay all the bills?
HAZLENUT: You arc, father. But don't worry. You're going to have
a lot more customers in the next four years.
FATHER: More customers?
HAZLENUT: That s right, father. He told me he was going to give
all you capitalists the business! (Father kicks viciously at the nearest
object. Said object happens to be Hazlenut's right leg. This limb is now
bioken also, and Hazlenut begins to bleed on the rug again. Fannie
speaks.)
FANNIE: Now listen, daughter, I've warned you. Either you stop
bleeding on the rug, or your father an I are- going to blow your head ofT!
HAZLENUT: No, mother, please don't blow my head off. And besides
you'll get foam all over the rug.
FATHER: We don't mean that head, daughter, wc mean the one on
your shoulders. Get off your fanny, Fannie, and bring me that pistol
you've been hiding in the drawer with your Serutan. (Author's note:
This radio play was also produced on Broadway under the title of
"Fannie Get Your Gun.")
All right, Hazlenut, before we shoot you, I want to ask you one thing.
Are you still glad you have committed this sin? You're not sorry that
you've done this?
HAZLENUT: No, I am not! I'm glad I voted for Truman'
SOUND EFFECT: (Bang!)

HAZLENUT: No, I am not! I'm glad I voted for Truman'
SOUND EFFECT: (Bang!)

ANNOUNCER: And now it's time for your Monday morning episode
of "One Mail's Family," the story of Mother and Father Barber and then
eight little shavers.
As you remember, Father Barber, a San Francisco capitalist has

been in trouble with the government recently over some
shady dealings on his rubber plantation. In fact, he
has just returned from doing a stretch.
As today's scene opens, Mother Fannie Barber has
just finished breaking daughter Hazelnut's left arm
in three places. Hazlenut has committed an unpar
donable sin.
FANNIE: Stop that arm from bleeding on the rug
and answer me, Hazlenut! Why did you do it'' Whv"'
Why? Why?
HAZLENUT: I don't know, mother. He just seemed
so nice.

FATHER: Nice, schmice! That's no reason for doing this to your mother
and me. And just how do you think this is going to look in a few months?
HAZLENUT: But, lather, he said he approved of labor!
FATHER: So he approves of labor. Who is going to pay all the bills?
HAZLENUT: You arc, father. But don't worry. You're going to have
a lot more customers in the next four years.
FATHER: More customers?
HAZLENUT: That s right, father. He told me he was going to give
all you capitalists the business! (Father kicks viciously at the nearest
object. Said object happens to be Hazlenut's right leg. This limb is now
bioken also, and Hazlenut begins to bleed on the rug again. Fannie
speaks.)
FANNIE: Now listen, daughter, I've warned you. Either you stop
bleeding on the rug, or your father an I are- going to blow your head ofT!
HAZLENUT: No, mother, please don't blow my head off. And besides
you'll get foam all over the rug.
FATHER: We don't mean that head, daughter, wc mean the one on
your shoulders. Get off your fanny, Fannie, and bring me that pistol
you've been hiding in the drawer with your Serutan. (Author's note:
This radio play was also produced on Broadway under the title of
"Fannie Get Your Gun.")
All right, Hazlenut, before we shoot you, I want to ask you one thing.
Are you still glad you have committed this sin? You're not sorry that
you've done this?
HAZLENUT: No, I am not! I'm glad I voted for Truman'
