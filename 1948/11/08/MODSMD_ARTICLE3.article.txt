# Council Gives Pool Verdict
## 
### 
Men's Council has sentenced
eight stucient football pool opera
tors to 20 hours of work at the
Stanford Convalescent Home. The
verdict, delivered at Council meet
ing last Friday, climaxed Council's
crackdown on national syndicated
football pools operating on campus.
The students were prosecuted on
grounds of violating the Funda
mental Standard and participating
in gambling, which is forbidden in
University residences.
"It would appear that the sen
tences are light in view of the ser
iousness of the charges," said Tom
Diamond, Council chairman.
"However, the present pool oper
ators, he said, "are not responsible
for the appearance and growth of
the pools on campus. The presence
of the pools has been generally
known for three years, although
not publicized.
"The pool operators appeared be
fore Council voluntarily," said Dia
mond, "and gave full details of then
operations. Through their co-op
eration with Council, the activities
of all pools on campus have been
stopped."
Diamond stated that any further
operation of national syndicated
football pools on campus will be
considered as an extremely serious
violation of administration and stu
dent body regulations and will be
dealt with accordingly.
First public report of the pools
appeared in Tuesday's Daily.
Present at Friday's Council meet
ing were Tom Diamond, chairman;
A 1 Munk, secretary; Bill Richard
son, Fred Loomis, and Hawley
Smith, Honor Code Standing Com
mittee chairman.
