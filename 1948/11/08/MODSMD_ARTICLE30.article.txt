# The 						History of a Kiss
## 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
You would think that such a
pleasant pastime as kissing would
be universal and eternal. Not so!
No animals kiss. Monkeys make
a stab at it, but it's difficult to de
termine whether they are Irying to
neck or trying to chew each other's
ears off. Doves try a bit of billing
and cooing . . . cows lick each other
once in a while . . . and fish have
been known to pucker up. How
ever, not being on conversant terms
with any of the aforementioned, I
cannot say if these are forms of
true love expression or merely an
other unknown factor of which we
humans are just ignorant. But, on
the whole, the animal kingdom can
take it or leave it alone.
Primitive peoples weren't having
any, either. The original Tahitians,
the aborigines of Australia, Eski
mos, and Fijians knew not its
charms. They rubbed noses and
banged their heads on each other's
feet, but they didn't kiss.
In the Bible there are many ref
erences to kissing, though among
the ancient Hebrews kissing be
tween the sexes was unknown. Men
kissed men and women kissed
women. That, of course, didn't last
long. The ancient Romans and
Greeks modernized the assault. In
fact, the Greeks went so far as to
force their wives to eat onions
whenever they left home. Just in
case the iceman got too friendly, I
suppose.
Romans Receive Credit
The main theory on the start of
it all, though, is attributed to the
Romans. It seems husbands wanted
some check on whether their bet
ter halves had been tippling the
cooking wine while they were at
the office checking war club sales.
So kissing was evolved. To make a
long story short, the idea caught on
and became so popular that now
everyone is testing everyone's
breath.
When an old-school Roman kissed

his lady love, though, it really
meant something besides 'Hello,
kid, how are ya?" It meant that
she got half his worldly goods in
case he kicked the bucket before
they had a chance to wed. The
Navy men of this era, with their
gal-in-every-port tradition to up
hold, would have their remains cut
up into more slices than a pic in a
delicatessen.
Somewhere, after the decline of
the Roman empire, kissing seems
to have been lost. It's hard to be
lieve, I know. But even today
mothers of Indo-China frighten the
pants off their naughty kids by
threatening them with a kiss. Kit
ing there is considered a horrible
act. Well, with some of the dates
I've had, I know just how they feel.
Along about the middle ages, the
English got hep and sponsored a re
awakening of the lost art. In fact, it
was popularized to such an extent
that soon everyone was kissing ev
eryone on the slightest pretext.
Right up to the Victorian era it was
as widespread and as prevalent as
handshaking . . . and wiuch more
interesting.
Class Kissing Distinction
France in the 17th century laid
down a few restrictions. They had
class distinctions. Any man with
three servants was entitled to kiss
any woman he chose. Which re
minds me of a man who didn't kiss
his wife for five years, but shot an
other guy who did.
Russia had a kissing epidemic,
too. In the 18th century it became
a mania, with everyone chewing
tongues with everyone else at the
bat of an eyelash. A kiss from the
czar was considered the highest of
honors, naturally.
Swedes Imported Instructors
Following the lead of the Eng
lish. the Swedes took over whole
heartedly the new custom, even
going so far as to import instruc
tors to teach the people how . . .
(and again I am born 150 years
too late). The French, once edu
cated to the idea, also adopted it
post - haste and spread the gospel
over the whole of Europe.
Now some doctors come up with
proof that many people have died
from being kissed. It spreads germs.
I suppose that's true. Kissing has
out an end to a lot of bachelors I
know.
