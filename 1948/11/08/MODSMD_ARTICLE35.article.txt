## 
### 
World Federalist delegates from |
Northern California will urge call- |
ing of a peoples' world convention ,
to the UWF general assembly which I
meets next weekend in Minneapo
lis. More than 100 Federalists from
Northern California who attended
the UWF institute meeting at Stan
ford yesterday voted that the dele
gates recommend the world con
vention plan for establishing world I
governments. | 1
Fritjof Thygeson, Stanford's del
egate to the general assembly, said
the plan is urged as the most hope- '
ful means to obtain popular sup- k
port for world government. Feder
alists of Northern California hope
the first steps toward eletcing dele
gates to the peoples' convention will 1
be taken immediately. ,
Northern California's representa
tives will also urge that the stu
dent chapters of the World Feder- j
alists support a peoples' convention |
even of the peoples' assembly does
not adopt this program to attain a
world government.
Mrs. Claire Lindgren Wolffor, one
of the founders of the World Fed
eralists, explained that delegates to
the proposed peoples' convention
would be sent from each nation,
and would be elccted in non-parti- j
san elections. The delegate® would !
then bring the constitution drawn
j up by the convention back to their
individual countries for ratification.
Gordon White, a World Federal
i ist from the University of Califor- I
| nia, opposed the peoples' conven
-1 tion and declared that the world !
j government could best be - set up j
I by amending the United Nations
! charter to create a new world fed
j eral government.
The United Nations would then
; have the authority to enact, inter
| prct, and enforce wor'.d law and |
maintain world peace. White said |
i that the United Nations charter I
I could best be amended by putting
pressure on Congress which would !
: cause the President to call a revi
! sional conference of the United Na- 1
iions.
