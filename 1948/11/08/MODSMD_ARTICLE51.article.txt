# Indian Soccermen Beat Gators, 3-1
## 
### 
Stanford's ved-shirtecl soccer team
came from behind Saturday morn
ing to subdue a surprisingly tough ]
San Francisco Stale eleven 3-1.
Earlier in the season Stanford de- j
feated the Gators 5-1.
The Indians were forced to play !
Saturday's game without the serv
ices of Coach John Segal. The skip
per was hit by a ball in practice '
Thursday, and was sent to ihe hos
pital for a check-up. During his (
absence Ara Galstaun took over as j
coach. '
The Gators took a 1-0 half-time â€¢
'ead when their left outride broke \
through the Stanford defense, and
drilled one through goalie Walt :
Dunbar. The Indians seemed rather ,
listless during the first two quar
ters. and only got two good shots |
at the State goalie.
Jerry Taylor tied the game at 1-1
after 15 minutes of play in the ;
third quarter. He took a long pass J
from Jimmy Sacerdote and had an
easy shot. Stanford kept the pres- j
sure cn and finally made it 2-1 with
five minutes remaining when Larry
Peterson scored. Tony Ortega com
pleted the day's scoring three min
utes later.
In the preliminary contest Satur- j
day morning Santa Clara edged the
Stanford jayvees, 4-2. in a tightly
played game.
