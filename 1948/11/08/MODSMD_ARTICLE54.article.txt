SACRAMENTO, Nov. 7 (/P).â€”
Nevada's dream of a football em
: pile and likely bid to a post-season
bowl game crumbled today before
a charging Santa Clara eleven that
racked up one of the prime upsets
of the year, 14-0.
The Broncos, blocking and run
ning in inspired fashion, smashed
over a first-period touchdown to
climax a 77-yard ground i".'ive and
; turned a recovered fumble into an
| other score in tlie second quarter.
Ihey place - kicked both extra
j points, then met every Nevada
; challenge in the second half to pro
-1 tect the lead.
Stan Heath, Nevada quarterback
who set the national collegiate rec
ord for yardage from completed

passes, found himself bottled up,
his tosses deflected or blocked. He
' was rushed so hard he had to get
throws off hurriedly much of the
I time. He connected with some, es
puecially in a desperate second-half
1 try, but the Broncos bobbed up to
j halt the threats in the nick of time.
An overflow crowd of 25,000. the
; largest to see a football contest in
this city, cheered the p'.ay. Among
! the enthusiastic rooters were Gov
ernor and Mrs. Earl Warren of Cal-
I ifornia.
