YANKEE STADIUM, N. Y., Nov. 6—Stanford was beaten today by an Army team that must be
rated equal to the great Army teams of 1945 and '46.
Deprived of the services of its top back, Stanford lost 43 to 0 to an Army team of great depth,
speed, and ability—one of the best teams in the nation.
In the end it proved to be this tremendous spe ed and depth that spelled the defeat of Stanford.

♦■Army scored six touchdowns by
i runs of 52, 41, 66, 13, 48, and 77
yards—an average of 49 yards per
touchdown.
Tive times Army sprung its fast,
hard - running backs through the
Stanford line for runs of more than
i 40 yards to pay dirt.
| Stanford really met two teams
I today, and offensive and a defen
sive outfit, and the Cards just did
| not have the depth or endurance to
i last out the attacks of these teams.
Mitchell's lujury a Blow
It was nine minutes into the
game, after the first Cadet score,
that Stanford fans knew the game
was lost. At this point fullback
Emery Mitchell was sent to the
sidelines with a wrenched knee, not
to play again in the game.
The sportswriters and the small
group of students and alumni knew
that, without the passes and run
ning. not to mention the cohesive
influence, of Mitchell, the Stanford
cause was a lost one.
But this Stanford football team
j did not know this. They fought for
three quarters to win the game, and
the last period to score on
this great Army team.
But the Army strength was just
too much. Every time Army lost
the ball the Indians would meet a
fresh team of men whose job it was
to stop the Card attack and then go
back to the bench to rest a while.
Then the offensive team would
come into the game to spring backs
''ke Gil Stephenson, Bobby Jack
Stuart, and Rudy Cosentino
through the Card line with explo
sive bursts.
Terrific Blocking
With great downfield blocking,
these backs would outrun a game

but spent Stanford back for a large
gain or touchdown.
Again it must be said that, in the
face of tremendous odds, our Stan
ford boys did not give up. Gone
was the threat of a working pass
ing attack when Mitchell left the
game. Gone was the blocking abil
ity of the solid fullback, but the
Cards threw everything they had
at the Black Knights.
A look at the statistics shows Hiat
Army gained 465 to 57 yards by
rushing. But this does not tell the
whole story, for the cards lost many
yards in. the closing minutes of the
game when their passers were
dropped for big losses by fresh
Army linemen.
Coach Marehie Schwartz used
every man on the squad in an at
tempt to keep up with the fresh
mslaught of the Cadets. Ilis regu
lars were worn and tired and the
reserves were not up to the level of
ball played by Army.
The "platoon" system of substitu
tion is kilMng when backed by
depth of players such as Army has
fo offer. The system was not liked
by the fans, or the corps of Cadets
that paraded so well here today.
A great chorus of boos greeted
each unit as it advanced on the field
to relieve the unit then playing.
But we of Stanford can be proud
fo our boys. They met a team that
was out of their class but they
would not quit playing. Time after
time they bounded back from a
long Army run that would have
broken the morale of a lesser group.

speed, and ability—one of the best teams in the nation.
In the end it proved to be this tremendous spe ed and depth that spelled the defeat of Stanford.

♦■Army scored six touchdowns by
i runs of 52, 41, 66, 13, 48, and 77
yards—an average of 49 yards per
touchdown.
Tive times Army sprung its fast,
hard - running backs through the
Stanford line for runs of more than
i 40 yards to pay dirt.
| Stanford really met two teams
I today, and offensive and a defen
sive outfit, and the Cards just did
| not have the depth or endurance to
i last out the attacks of these teams.
Mitchell's lujury a Blow
It was nine minutes into the
game, after the first Cadet score,
that Stanford fans knew the game
was lost. At this point fullback
Emery Mitchell was sent to the
sidelines with a wrenched knee, not
to play again in the game.
The sportswriters and the small
group of students and alumni knew
that, without the passes and run
ning. not to mention the cohesive
influence, of Mitchell, the Stanford
cause was a lost one.
But this Stanford football team
j did not know this. They fought for
three quarters to win the game, and
the last period to score on
this great Army team.
But the Army strength was just
too much. Every time Army lost
the ball the Indians would meet a
fresh team of men whose job it was
to stop the Card attack and then go
back to the bench to rest a while.
Then the offensive team would
come into the game to spring backs
''ke Gil Stephenson, Bobby Jack
Stuart, and Rudy Cosentino
through the Card line with explo
sive bursts.
Terrific Blocking
With great downfield blocking,
these backs would outrun a game

but spent Stanford back for a large
gain or touchdown.
Again it must be said that, in the
face of tremendous odds, our Stan
ford boys did not give up. Gone
was the threat of a working pass
ing attack when Mitchell left the
game. Gone was the blocking abil
ity of the solid fullback, but the
Cards threw everything they had
at the Black Knights.
A look at the statistics shows Hiat
Army gained 465 to 57 yards by
rushing. But this does not tell the
whole story, for the cards lost many
yards in. the closing minutes of the
game when their passers were
dropped for big losses by fresh
Army linemen.
Coach Marehie Schwartz used
every man on the squad in an at
tempt to keep up with the fresh
mslaught of the Cadets. Ilis regu
lars were worn and tired and the
reserves were not up to the level of
ball played by Army.
The "platoon" system of substitu
tion is kilMng when backed by
depth of players such as Army has
fo offer. The system was not liked
by the fans, or the corps of Cadets
that paraded so well here today.
A great chorus of boos greeted
each unit as it advanced on the field
to relieve the unit then playing.
But we of Stanford can be proud
fo our boys. They met a team that
was out of their class but they
would not quit playing. Time after
time they bounded back from a
long Army run that would have
broken the morale of a lesser group.

gain or touchdown.
Again it must be said that, in the
face of tremendous odds, our Stan
ford boys did not give up. Gone
was the threat of a working pass
ing attack when Mitchell left the
game. Gone was the blocking abil
ity of the solid fullback, but the
Cards threw everything they had
at the Black Knights.
A look at the statistics shows Hiat
Army gained 465 to 57 yards by
rushing. But this does not tell the
whole story, for the cards lost many
yards in. the closing minutes of the
game when their passers were
dropped for big losses by fresh
Army linemen.
Coach Marehie Schwartz used
every man on the squad in an at
tempt to keep up with the fresh
mslaught of the Cadets. Ilis regu
lars were worn and tired and the
reserves were not up to the level of
ball played by Army.
The "platoon" system of substitu
tion is kilMng when backed by
depth of players such as Army has
fo offer. The system was not liked
by the fans, or the corps of Cadets
that paraded so well here today.
A great chorus of boos greeted
each unit as it advanced on the field
to relieve the unit then playing.
But we of Stanford can be proud
fo our boys. They met a team that
was out of their class but they
would not quit playing. Time after
time they bounded back from a
long Army run that would have
broken the morale of a lesser group.

dium Saturday—Bob Bullock. Staff Editor, and John B reier. Sports Desk Editor. Read Bullock's impressions
of the game on page (i.)

YANKEE STADIUM, N. Y., Nov. 6—Stanford was beaten today by an Army team that must be
rated equal to the great Army teams of 1945 and '46.
Deprived of the services of its top back, Stanford lost 43 to 0 to an Army team of great depth,
speed, and ability—one of the best teams in the nation.
In the end it proved to be this tremendous spe ed and depth that spelled the defeat of Stanford.

♦■Army scored six touchdowns by
i runs of 52, 41, 66, 13, 48, and 77
yards—an average of 49 yards per
touchdown.
Tive times Army sprung its fast,
hard - running backs through the
Stanford line for runs of more than
i 40 yards to pay dirt.
| Stanford really met two teams
I today, and offensive and a defen
sive outfit, and the Cards just did
| not have the depth or endurance to
i last out the attacks of these teams.
Mitchell's lujury a Blow
It was nine minutes into the
game, after the first Cadet score,
that Stanford fans knew the game
was lost. At this point fullback
Emery Mitchell was sent to the
sidelines with a wrenched knee, not
to play again in the game.
The sportswriters and the small
group of students and alumni knew
that, without the passes and run
ning. not to mention the cohesive
influence, of Mitchell, the Stanford
cause was a lost one.
But this Stanford football team
j did not know this. They fought for
three quarters to win the game, and
the last period to score on
this great Army team.
But the Army strength was just
too much. Every time Army lost
the ball the Indians would meet a
fresh team of men whose job it was
to stop the Card attack and then go
back to the bench to rest a while.
Then the offensive team would
come into the game to spring backs
''ke Gil Stephenson, Bobby Jack
Stuart, and Rudy Cosentino
through the Card line with explo
sive bursts.
Terrific Blocking
With great downfield blocking,
these backs would outrun a game
