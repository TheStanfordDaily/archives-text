(Editor's Note: Two Daily reporters witnessed the Stanford-Army game from the pressbox in Yankee Sta
dium Saturday—Bob Bullock. Staff Editor, and John B reier. Sports Desk Editor. Read Bullock's impressions
of the game on page (i.)

YANKEE STADIUM, N. Y., Nov. 6—Stanford was beaten today by an Army team that must be
rated equal to the great Army teams of 1945 and '46.
Deprived of the services of its top back, Stanford lost 43 to 0 to an Army team of great depth,
speed, and ability—one of the best teams in the nation.
In the end it proved to be this tremendous spe ed and depth that spelled the defeat of Stanford.

♦■Army scored six touchdowns by
i runs of 52, 41, 66, 13, 48, and 77
yards—an average of 49 yards per
touchdown.
Tive times Army sprung its fast,
hard - running backs through the
Stanford line for runs of more than
i 40 yards to pay dirt.
| Stanford really met two teams
I today, and offensive and a defen
sive outfit, and the Cards just did
| not have the depth or endurance to
i last out the attacks of these teams.
Mitchell's lujury a Blow
It was nine minutes into the
game, after the first Cadet score,
that Stanford fans knew the game
was lost. At this point fullback
Emery Mitchell was sent to the
sidelines with a wrenched knee, not
to play again in the game.
The sportswriters and the small
group of students and alumni knew
that, without the passes and run
ning. not to mention the cohesive
influence, of Mitchell, the Stanford
cause was a lost one.
But this Stanford football team
j did not know this. They fought for
three quarters to win the game, and
the last period to score on
this great Army team.
But the Army strength was just
too much. Every time Army lost
the ball the Indians would meet a
fresh team of men whose job it was
to stop the Card attack and then go
back to the bench to rest a while.
Then the offensive team would
come into the game to spring backs
''ke Gil Stephenson, Bobby Jack
Stuart, and Rudy Cosentino
through the Card line with explo
sive bursts.
Terrific Blocking
With great downfield blocking,
these backs would outrun a game
