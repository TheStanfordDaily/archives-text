EXCOM 2 (WOMEN'S ROW)

Mary Ellen Alabaster — The job
of Women's Row Excom member is
to bring her experience and insight
as a member of a small living group

to the problems which arise for the
campus as a whole. Thus she keeps
the Women's Row from the inher
ent danger of being self-sufficient
and isolated.
I'd like the job.
EXCOM !> (ROBLE)
Sally Kinney—"Excom" is an ab
stract term to Roble freshmen. To
give Roble the realization that this
is a concrete organization which re
spects tlie frosh views and opinions
is my primary plan. Beneficial
knowledge of campus activities as
a whole will be brought closer to
Roble residents.
Maryanne TelTt—lt is my aim to
represent not only my own ideas
or those of a few chosen friends,
but to represent the majority of
opinion at Roble. It will be a fur
ther aim of mine to help make
Roble Hall one of the most active
women's living groups in student
government on campus.

The following are the campaign i
statements of the candidates for
Olf-Campus Excom and Graduate
Excom:
EXCOM 1 (OFF-CAMPUS)
Art Ilerzog—l am in favor of the j
appointment of a chairman who j
would provide activities for inter
ested off-campus students, and co
ordinate these activities with col- j
lege life; of better representation
for off-campus students in ASSU, 1
proportional to their numbers. I
pledge energetic representation.
Frank 11. 11. King — I support
lower Cellar prices. I shall con
sider all ASSU policies with spe-

I cial reference to their convenience
lor and interest to off-campus stu
j dents. I will do al! that is possible
to secure off-campus participation
i in student activities but will first
j find out exactly what off-campus
j students want.
Jean Shipkey — The off-campus
i students don't have much chance
j at organizing, as they live in such
a widespread vicinity. I would like
to try to give off-campus students a
chance to participate in more cam
i pus activities and co-ordinate their
ideas and interests toward a more
active program.
Leon Sloss—My campaign is based
I on the premise that the voters want
j to know something about the can
| didates for whom they vote. Fifty,
; words in The Daily are hardly suf
ficient. Leaflets will be distributed
ion campus today explaining my
aime in detail. Watch for them!
EXCOM S (ENCINA)
Stu Handmaker —To be a true
representative of you and to serve
I you and your interests capably are
i the only campaign promises I can
make at this time. A weekly gripe
! "get-together" for you to air your
j views on the management of Stan
ford will be the guiding factor in
my conduct as a member of Excom.
Bill Quimby — The improvement
of Stanford University, OUR Uni
-1 versity. and the minimization of in
dividual expenses are the two main
i p'anks of my platform. If elected,
both of these objectives plus all of
YOUR worthwhile ideas will be
presented to Excom. Why? Be
cause I feel that that is what tin
job of Excom representative is.
