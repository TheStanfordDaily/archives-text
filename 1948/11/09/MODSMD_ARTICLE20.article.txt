WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 (AP) —A Federal Grand Jury today
indicted Rep. J. Parnell Thomas (R.-N.J.) for alleged conspiracy
to pad his congressional office payrolls by setting up a list of
"fictitious" employees.
The 53-year-old New Jersey legislator, who was re-elected in

last Tuesday's election, is the retiring
chairman of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities which
probed alleged Communist spy plots
iind espionage in government circles.
Court officials said that if con
victed on all charges, Thomas would
face a possible maximum sentence
of 32 years in prison, $40,000 in fines,
or both. Congressional authorities
agreed, however, that his status as
a member of the House would be
left entirely to the decision of that
body. The House is the judge of the
qualifications of its own members.
The jury also indicted Thomas'
former secretary, Miss Helen Camp
bell, on charges that she joined with
the lawmaker in the alleged con
spiracy, involving accusations of sal
ary "kickbacks." The plot, the jury
said, was "to defraud the United
States of its money and property"
over a five-year period from Jan. 1,
1940 to Jan. 30, 1945.
The indictment cited 34 "Overt
Acts" in the point conspiracy com
plaint against Thomas and Miss
Campbell. In addition, Thomas alone
was accused on three other counts
•of filing alleged false claims against
the government.
