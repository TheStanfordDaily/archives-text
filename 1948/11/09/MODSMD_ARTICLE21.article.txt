WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. (/P).â€”
Democratic Chairman J. Howard
McGrath said tonight the choice of
Congressional committee heads will
be left entirely up to the Demo
cratic members of the new Senate
and House.
McGrath's comment was made to
a reporter who asked nbout a pro
posal by Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
that Southern States' Rights party
members who campaigned against
President Truman be read out of
the Democratic party.
Without commenting directly on
Mrs. Roosevelt's suggestion, the na
tional chairman indicated that so
far as he is concerned the national
committee will not attempt to in
terfere in the choice of committee
leaders in the 81st Congress.
