# Santa Ana Fire Blown to Canyons
## 
### 
SANTA ANA, > Nov. 8 (/l I ).—Some
600 residents of two Santa Ana
mountain canyons fled their homes
today as a gale whipped tongues of
flame in another outbreak of brush
fire in Southern California.
Leaping out of control as gusts
rose to 55 miles an hour, the fire
burned to the mouths of Silverado
and Modjeska Canyons.
About 200 homes in Silverado
and more than 75 in Modjeska
Canyon were threatened. Many are
large estates of wealthy Santa Ana
businessmen.
Busses and trucks from nearby
El Toro Marine Base were remov
ing evacuees, but many left in their
own cars, pulling trailers loaded
with valuables. Some 700 fire
fighters — 300 of them Marines —
were on the widening front.
