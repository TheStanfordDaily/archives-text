### 
PARIS, Nov. 8 (TP).â€”The Politi- |
cal Committee of the United Na
tions Assembly formally con
demned Albania, Bulgaria, and Yu
goslavia tonight for aiding Greek
guerrillas and violating the UN
charter.
The condemnation was backed by
47 of the 58 committee members. It.
was the strongest action taken so
far by any U.N. body against the
three Soviet satellites. Russia and
other members of the Soviet bloc
refused to vote.
The committee's action was on !
one crucial paragraph of a resolu

tion put up by the United States,
j France, Britain, and China.
Bitter words flew in the noisy
committee meeting where the
chairman, Premier Paul Henri
Spaak of Belgium, angrily accused
the Soviet bloc of "systematically
sabotaging" the Balkans debate.
