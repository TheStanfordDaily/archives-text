## A
						Reasonable Man 
### 
An editorial in yesterday's Chronicle proposes that the United
States embark upon a project to find "a rational, reasonable man."
The editorial points out that this problem must be solved it civili
zation is to survive.
The argument that such a project is impossible is refuted in
the editorial by the example of the atomic bomb. There, the "im
possible" has been achieved, as it has in science throughout
the ages. Science has always progressed working with the
theory that nothing is impossible until it has been tried.
The idea of engaging in exhaustive research to lind the "rea
sonable man" has merit. But, what possible good could it do for
mankind, even if the research did uncover a "rational, reasonable
man?" Would all the peoples of the world so change themselves
as to conform to the logical reactions of such a man? Obviously
not.
As the Chronicle points out, this problem must be solved if
civilization is to survive; however, the editorial proposes no
means of applying the discoveries made by such an experiment.
No doubt such a project will not be undertaken in the near
future. Neither Congress nor the majority of the taxpayers would
be willing to expend such a sum to solve the problems of human
nature. Unless, there appears to be a possibility of the solution
of the problems and a practical method of applying the findings
to better the world, this plan will never amount to more than,
a mere idea.
For a country faced with the imminent possibility of a new
war, it would not be sensible to begin an expensive program
that might net absolutely no results. The "conquest of man by
man" is a problem that must be solved, but until more thinking
is done along practical lines, it seems useless to even consider
expending two billion dollars on such a project.
Along practical lines, we suggest that there are already enough
universities and "thinking men." More attention and money
should be directed to utilizing what knowledge is already at
hand concerning man and his reactions to his environment.
Moreover, we suggest that the immediate problem is to make
sure that man gets along (politically at least) whether he is a
"rational, reasonable" individual or not. To that end we recom
mend more labor towards: (1) building a better international or
ganization, one which will at least codify laws and treaties; (2)
forming an international police force to keep order; and (3) devel
oping an educational campaign which will promote understand
ing between peoples, rather than attempt "discovery" of the
ideal man.
