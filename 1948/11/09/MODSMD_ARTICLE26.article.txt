## Cusick Maintains Irish Are One Nation 
### 
To the Editor:
Although I don't wish to make the"Letters to the Editor" column a
field for personal debate, I would appreciate an opportvfriity to present my
rebuttal to Mr. Allen's case.
Of the remaining points still mutually contested, the most important one
seems to be the disagreement over the statement that the people of Ireland
have the "same racial, cultural, ethnical, and fundamentally similar religious
background." This I still strongly maintain.
Both Ireland and England trace their racial heritage from the native
Gaels and Britons, and the inroads of the Scandinavians, Gauls, and Span
iards. The "Plantation Period" did not cause any radical change in the
similar racial and cultural bases of the people of Ireland. Closely linked
to these factors is the ethnical background, very similar because all the
groups in the British Isles received the language background and many
of their customs from the Romans, the Angles and Saxons, and of course,
the native Britons and Gaels.
Being previously aware ol Mr. Allen's birthplace, I request him to set
aside his nek American Hag for a moment, while I try again to explain
that the phrase "Irish-American" does not denote citizenship, but na
tionality. The answer "American" to the question of one's nationality still
brings some furtive glances seeking feathers, moccasins, and tomahawks.
