# More on Irish Partition
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I should like to compliment Joe Cusick on his able and accurate refuta- ;
tion of AI Alien's article which dealt with the efforts being made to end
the partition of Irelandâ€”and which was written from a markedly biased
point of view.
Throughout all the years of recorded history, Ireland has been one na
tion, with clearly defined boundaries set in the sea. Even prior to the
Christian era, when there were chieftains or lesser kings who ruled over
the various sections of the island, there existed a high king to whom these
lesser rulers paid homage, and who was the symbol of Irish unity.
AI Allen's statement regarding the political influence of the Catholic
hierarchy in Eire is questionable, I doubt seriously that he could sustain i
his assertion, but let us for the moment assume it to be correct. If it be !
true we should congratulate the Catholic bishops of free Ireland for dis- !
playing a broad spirit of toleration, and of deep understanding, which !
will be fully appreciated when we remember that upon the establishment |
of a sovereign government in Dublin, in 1922, the Irish government ap- '
poi tioned 30, or half of the seats in the Senate to Protestants, reserved
many executive and judicial offices for them, and guaranteed their right of
the franchise, and this in a country which is more than 93 per cent Catholic. |
In all justice, then, England should allow the question of partition to
be dccided by the Irish, hy means of the ballot. If this were done, parti
tion would end tomorrow.
