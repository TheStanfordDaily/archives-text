# South African Whites Okay Segregation

### AL ALLEN 
South Alrican soldiers who saw
i the bullet-riddled bodies of Musso
! lixii and his beautiful mistress,
, Clara Petacci, strung up outside a
gas station in Milan in May, 1945,
possibly thought they were wit
nessing the end of Fascism in Eu
rope. In May, 1948, the number of
i veterans who voted with the bark
veld Nationalists in the South Afri
can elections was large enough to
oust from office the war-time lead
er. Field Marshal Smuts. To the
j Union Buildings in Pretoria came
I Dr. Daniel Frangois Malan, ex-
Dutch Reformed Church predikant,
Anglophobc, professed admirer of
| Nazi Germany.
In much the same manner as
President Truman's stand on the
States' Rights issue precipitated a
I break in the Democratic party, so
i did Smuts' United Party suffer
j when the Field Marshal permitted
his liberal lieutenant, Jan Hofmeyr,
to voice his opinion on the eve of
the elections that the time was over
ripe for a new and better deal for
the country's seven and one-quar
ter million underprivileged Afri
cans.
Dr. Malan's answer to the race
problem was accepted at the voting
booths by South Africa's two mil
lion white, all - powerful minority.
Malan calls his policy "apartheid"
(segregation) and ranks it high
among his schemes for encouraging
Nordic immigration, harassing the
Jews, and severing South Africa's
1 ties with the British Empire.
Apartheid Explained
Briefly, the policy of apartheid
; would confine South Africa's native
: population to reservations. From
! these reservations the Africans
| could emerge only to work for the
; whites as migrant laborers when
ever they were needed. In theory
the development of the African
I provinces would be aided by the
i government — but this angle has
! been glossed over by the National
( ists in their haste to usher in the
new era of all-white farms, towns,
; and cities.
Dr. Malan currently holds power
by virtue of a slim majority wrested
from Smuts in last May's elections.
The recently announced budget of
Minister of Finance Havenga was a
masterpiece of strategy in that a
reduction of income tax placated
the white-collar workers, the in
| dustrialists were encouraged, and
1 the mighty Transvaal Chamber of
Mines was not antagonized. Thus
; the Nationalists weathered the storm
I which at one time threatened to
1 sweep them from office.
Pravda Concerned
To Americans, South African pol
itics may seem far. far away and
unimportant. Pravda, however, con
fesses grave concern. Churchill's
admonishments to Moscow to cease
| tormenting and oppressing the peo
j pies of Soviet - dominated Europe
i were countered by Pravda's aceus
| ing finger pointed at South Africa.
The present set-up in South Af
i rica in which a black majority is
| represented by two whites in an
all-white parliament can hardly be
; described as democratic. Dr. Ma
i lan's self-dubbed "Christian" pol
! icy of apartheid may make a bad
; condition chronic, for the ex
preacher shows no evidence of
abandoning any of the radical and
explosive pledges of his election
campaign.
As a member of Ihe British Com
i monwealth of Nations, South Af
: rica must be included among the
| allies of democracy. Before the
I war apartheid, anti-Semitism, and
| "kultur" were retailed under a dif
j ferent trademark —- Fascism. Dr.
j Malan embarrasses the Western de
i mocracies, but he doesn't seem to
care.

Pravda Concerned
To Americans, South African pol
itics may seem far. far away and
unimportant. Pravda, however, con
fesses grave concern. Churchill's
admonishments to Moscow to cease

i were countered by Pravda's aceus
| ing finger pointed at South Africa.
The present set-up in South Af
i rica in which a black majority is
| represented by two whites in an
all-white parliament can hardly be
; described as democratic. Dr. Ma
i lan's self-dubbed "Christian" pol
! icy of apartheid may make a bad
; condition chronic, for the ex
preacher shows no evidence of
abandoning any of the radical and
explosive pledges of his election
campaign.
As a member of Ihe British Com
i monwealth of Nations, South Af

South Alrican soldiers who saw

I Dr. Daniel Frangois Malan, ex-
Dutch Reformed Church predikant,
Anglophobc, professed admirer of

In much the same manner as

his liberal lieutenant, Jan Hofmeyr,
to voice his opinion on the eve of
the elections that the time was over
ripe for a new and better deal for
the country's seven and one-quar
ter million underprivileged Afri
cans.
Dr. Malan's answer to the race
problem was accepted at the voting
booths by South Africa's two mil
lion white, all - powerful minority.
Malan calls his policy "apartheid"
(segregation) and ranks it high
among his schemes for encouraging
Nordic immigration, harassing the
Jews, and severing South Africa's
1 ties with the British Empire.
Apartheid Explained
Briefly, the policy of apartheid

the development of the African
