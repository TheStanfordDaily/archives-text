# CAT, BRAGS AGAIN
## 
### 
Cal students' boast to the Cal
Daily yesterday afternoon that they
had branded the Stanford campus
with al4 x 20â€”ft "C." burned in Ihe
grass in front of the Inner Quad,
that they had marked another bin
"C" on the front pate, and that they
had left their mark on every street,
was in reality a dash of rod paint
on the sidewalk near the Art Mu
seum.
