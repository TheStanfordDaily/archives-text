TUESDAY MORNING SHORT STORY (NOT) FOR THE KIDDIES:
Once upon a time, there were Three Bears; a Father Bear, a Mother
Bear, and a Baby Bear.
One day while they were out walking, Father Bear spied a B'ar. He
.â€¢-aid to Mother Bear, "Why don't we go inside this B'ar and have a few
drinks?"

As they scaled themselves at the Bar, Mother Bear
found herself sitting next to a Skunk. Pointing to
the striped animal, she asked Father Bear, "What
do you suppose he is doing in here, trying to get
drunk as a skunk?"
"I imagine so," answered Father, "but I don't think
he'll be able to pay for all those drinks. 1 don't
think he has a scent!"
At this moment, the beartender asked the Three
Bears what they were going to drink. Father Bear
told him to dose up three animal drinks, and the
Beartender went off to prepare a Moscow Mule a

Horse's Neck, and a Bearbon and soda.
Just as the beartender came back with their drinks, the Three Bears
were approached by a large bear who was wearing plaid fur and smoking
a cheap cigar. He sauntered up to the Three Bears and spoke to Father
Bear.
All right, Buddy, I think you'd better come along with me!"
"There must be some mistake," cried Father Bear. "My name is not
Buddy. You must be thinking of Buddy Baer. He's a prizefighter."
"I in not thinking of Buddy Baer, buddy, I'm thinking of you. You're
the father of this young bear sitting here at the B'ar, aren't you?"
"Yes," answered Father Bear, cleverly.
"Well, listen, buddy. I work for the State Bear'd of Equalization, and
any bear, even a California Bear, is smart enough to see that this young
bear is not old enough to be in a B'ar."
"All right," confessed Father Bear. "I admit it. He's not old enough
to be in a Bar. But before you take us down to the station, why don't
you answer the telephone?"
"What are you talking about?" asked the B. of E. Bear. "The telephone
isn t even ringing!"
"Well, why wait until the last minute?" retorted Father Bear.
And. sure enough, just then the telephone started to ring.
As the bear from the Bear'd of Equalization turned his back to answer
the telephone, Father Bear grabbed Mother Bear by the paw and shouted-
Quick, Mama, out the door!"
And so the Three Bears got away from the B. of E. bear They ran
out the front door of the B'ar with Father Bear in front, followed by
Mother Bear, with the little bare behind. The end.
(There's no getting away Jrom it, Dailey; you've got to quit smoking
those cheap cigars!) 5
