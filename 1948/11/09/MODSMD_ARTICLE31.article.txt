## Stylists Sell Men Short 
### 
So now the men are getting the
clothes horse laugh. Last August
the men's clothes designers said
there would be nothing new for
this year ... no bell-bottom pants,
no bustle efiects, no pleats encir
cling the waistline.
By September they weren't so
sure but that there would be a
very few minor changes — like
shortening the pants legs two inch
es. What are they talking about?
The way women's styles are going
through men's pocketbooks the men
will be lucky to have any pants left
at all.
Then in October these same de
signers came out. with . . . pocket
books for males, so help me. And
don't jeer, men. Before World War
I the wrist watch was considered
quite lah-de-dah for he-men. And
after-shaving lotion even had its
session as "pany - league" fare.
Now latest statistics show that
enough of these male perfumeries
are sold yearly to float the whole
United States fleet.
After all, toting a purse would
be no worse than the doctor carry
ing the tools of his trade with him
in his little black bag. A journalist
could carry his own portable tripe
writer. Carry along extra shorts
and socks on dates. Oh, the ideas
are endless.
And some of the rest of this stuff
they have cooked up to liven up
the male plumage! Have you ever
seen a rainbow walking? They have
tuxedos with Eisenhower jackets
in midnight blue, suede topcoats
in bright maroon, and even plaid

rompers for sport time, believe it
or not.
It all this takes hold it looks like
the women will be losing their grip
on the sex-appeal monopoly. Ralph
Carver, prexy of the Merchant-Tai
lor Designers' Association of Amer
ica, goes so far as to predict that
within ten years business shorts
and sleeveless shirt ensembles will
be the "new look" for the brawny
sex. Personally I'm glad I have a
short life line.
He thinks they already have a
start on the trend with shorts being
featured on the beaches and golf
courses. They will be next in the
home and then in the offices. Well,
just imagine fur-lined G-strings in
the dead of a Washington winter.
At least you wouldn't have to wor
ry about getting snow down your
neck.
And feature, if you can, your
very staid history prof strutting
into class in his newest form-fitting
plaid shorts with matching homberg
hat. You feature it. I've got a weak
heart.
All in all, though, it isn't so far
fetched. The men of today actually
wear divided skirts. All men wore
skirts until 900 B.C. when Assyrian
cavalrymen developed divided skirts
as an aid to their horsemanship.
From these the trousers of today
have evolved. So next time v>u
see a horse, men, bow low in
thanks! The moral is—don't scoff
at the proposed styles of today . . .
pray!
But whatever happens, pie. e
God, don't let them take our shoul
der pads.
