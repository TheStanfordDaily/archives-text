# Typed Formula, Smooth Techniques Are Contrasted in 'Paradine Case'

You can only dilute good whis
key so much!
You can only make a certain
number of pictures in the same way
with the same technique before di
luting your formula beyond saving.
Time was when one couldn't see
a Hitchcock picture without grip
ping the edge of the seat in sur
prise and suspense. The mood of
(he picture was sinister and ten
sion-filled; the plot was original,
the technique was masterful.
"The Paradine Case," like diluted
whiskey, still retains a tiny amount
of the original taste. The plot may
have come from a mimeographing
machine and the characters may
have been applied with a rubber
stamp, but the "Hitchcock touch"
still remains and even makes the
picture worth seeing. But the tech
nique, superb in itself, is eo smooth
that it makes the picture seem like
a nearly perfect imitation of some
thing real. With a little less tech
nique and a little more originality
"The Paradine Case" could have
been exciting entertainment.
The story centers around an Eng
lish trial and Hitchcock experi
ments with the technique he later
perfected in "Rope" — limiting the
camera to a certain range, in this
case mainly to a courtroom. A bril
liant young barrister, played by
Gregory Peck, defends the beauti
ful Mrs. Paradine, played by Valli,
who is charged with murder. Louis
Jourdan, as the late Mr. Para.line's
valet, is easily the best thing in

j the picture. A sexier, younger edi
tion of Charles Boyer, he has both
! talent and looks. Ann Todd, as
| Peck's faithful wife, aliso gives a
, non-stereotyped performance. The
, all-star cast includes two neurotic
types — the judge who wants to
hang everybody, played malevo
lently by Charles Laughton, and his
frightened, repressed wife, excel
lently acted by Ethel Banymore.
"The Paradine Case" has its ex
citing moments, but it makes one
long for the days when Mr. Hitch
cock didn't use the oil of technique
so profusely.
The picture is now playing at the
Stanford Theater.—A. Levin
