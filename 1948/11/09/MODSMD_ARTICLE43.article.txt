# Stanford and California Face Tough Weekends at Home
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 8 (/P).—
Undefeated University of Califor
nia is due for a rough afternoon
with Washington State next Sat
urday unless vast improvement is
noted in blocking and pass throw
ing. Coach Lynn Waldorf made the
statement today at the football
writers' meeting.
"Our all-around showing against
UCLA last week was very poor,"
he said. The Bears beat the Bruins
28-13 but their performances dis
appointed Waldorf greatly.
"We didn't have anybody who
could carry a tunc, let alone a foot
ball," he remarked. "Our blocking
was bad. We completed two out
of 12 passes.
Jensen Stopped
"Jackie Jensen's rushing average
of 2.1 yards was very low and he
A'as thrown for losses several times.
Phis can be traced to the weak
blocking accorded him. UCLA mis
lakes rather than California's play
were a determining factor in our
win."
Santa Clara's Coach Len Casa
nova, acknowledging congratula
tions from all sides on the 14-0 win
over Nevada, said his boys picked
up confidence when they discov
ered they could outcharge the Ne
vadans early in the game.
The advance strategy, he de-

I clared, was to put pressure on Ne
' vada's passer, Stan Heath, con-
I stantly.
Army and Michigan
Stanford's Coach Marchmont
Schwartz, back from the 43-0 wal
loping by Army, said the Cadets
put on the finest display of 60-min
j ute football he had seen in a long
time.
''Army can be compared evenly
with Michigan and Notre Dame, in
my opinion," he said! "Our play
ers fro faced the great 1947 Michi
gan team said this Army club has
more team speed than last year's
Wolverines. The first-period loss of
our fullback, Emery Mitchell, hurt
us immeasurably. We wouldn't have
defeated Army, regardless, but with
I the benefit ot Mitchell's passing,
; kicking, and running we might have
j held the score down and might
I have scored once. I'll put this Army
! team up against any in the eoun-
I try."
Ross Miller of the University of
' Montana predicted his team would
tfive Stanford a battle this Satur
l day, in spite of a poor record of
j six defeats in eight games this sea
j son.
; He said Montana had been han
dicapped by having key men un
available in every contest, and
I pointed out that notwithstanding
! the losing record, halfback Roy
j Malcom had an average gain of five
i yards for the season.

SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 8 (/P).—
Undefeated University of Califor
nia is due for a rough afternoon
with Washington State next Sat
urday unless vast improvement is
noted in blocking and pass throw
ing. Coach Lynn Waldorf made the
statement today at the football
writers' meeting.
"Our all-around showing against
UCLA last week was very poor,"
he said. The Bears beat the Bruins
28-13 but their performances dis
appointed Waldorf greatly.
"We didn't have anybody who
could carry a tunc, let alone a foot
ball," he remarked. "Our blocking
was bad. We completed two out
of 12 passes.
Jensen Stopped
"Jackie Jensen's rushing average
of 2.1 yards was very low and he
A'as thrown for losses several times.
Phis can be traced to the weak
blocking accorded him. UCLA mis
lakes rather than California's play
were a determining factor in our
win."
Santa Clara's Coach Len Casa
nova, acknowledging congratula
tions from all sides on the 14-0 win
over Nevada, said his boys picked
up confidence when they discov
ered they could outcharge the Ne
vadans early in the game.
The advance strategy, he de-

I clared, was to put pressure on Ne
' vada's passer, Stan Heath, con-
I stantly.
Army and Michigan
Stanford's Coach Marchmont
Schwartz, back from the 43-0 wal
loping by Army, said the Cadets
put on the finest display of 60-min
j ute football he had seen in a long
time.
''Army can be compared evenly
with Michigan and Notre Dame, in
my opinion," he said! "Our play
ers fro faced the great 1947 Michi
gan team said this Army club has
more team speed than last year's
Wolverines. The first-period loss of
our fullback, Emery Mitchell, hurt
us immeasurably. We wouldn't have
defeated Army, regardless, but with
I the benefit ot Mitchell's passing,
; kicking, and running we might have
j held the score down and might
I have scored once. I'll put this Army
! team up against any in the eoun-
I try."
