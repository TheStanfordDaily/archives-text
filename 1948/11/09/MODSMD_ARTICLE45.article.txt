## THE 						FRONT ROW 
### 
Stanford was a badly battered, bruised, and thoroughly beaten football
team when it returned to the Farm late Sunday night. The new machine
had not only been dctoured, it had been junked.
The Redshirts had simply not been mentally or physically ready to
meet Army, a team that plays real football. The Cadets don't mess around.
They play mean, vicious, and hungry football, and they play, strictly-to win.
They say every person sitting in Yankee Stadium last Saturday would
groan in sympathy when an Army man hit a Stanford ballcarrier. It hurt,
and it hurt bad. The string of Indian injuries was pi oof- enough of Army's
brutal and crushing attack.
Mitchell Out lor Season
Emery Mitchell, Stanford's one-man offense, had to be helped from
the field after having his knee torn to shreds. Mitchell had never been
hurt before, but this injury will keep him out of the Big Game and possi
| bly out of football for good.
A 1 Laakso, a fast-improving end, was actually ground into the dirt dur
! ing the first few minutes of play. On one particular pileup, half of Laakso's
I lace was left on the Yankee Stadium turf, and what was left looked more
like raw hamburger.
A! Rau. mainstay ol the tackle corps, was wiped out with an elbow
injury that will probably keep him out of the Big Game, too. At best,
Glubglub Rau won't be using his elbow any more this season.
Halfback Bob White, dependent on his speed for picking up yardage,
limped off the field Saturday after his ankle had been blasted out from
under him. White will favor his ankle for the rest of the season.
Mickey Titus was added to the disabled list when he bumped head-on
into a couple of Army boys who left him woozy with a slight head con
j cussion. Fullback Bud Klein will be out for the season with a bad leg.
j and when you add End Ken Rose, Tackle Gordon White, and Quarter
back Aubrey Devine to the badly-shaken list, you get a complete picture
of the Army tragedy. The shock troops were at their devastating best.
The list of injuries suffererd in the Army game was almost unbelievable.
Any chances for victory in the Big Game were blown sky-high, and even
the contest against the poor Montana team is going to be tough.
Army Is True Machine
Army's Coach Red Blaik has developed a true, cold, and calculating
gridiron machine. But you can have it. His payoff platoon system might
win games, but it destroys the color of collegiate competition.
When you see a defensive team that doesn't know one offensive play, and
and offensive team that thinks defense is another game entirely, you
know that football is changing from a spirited, glamorous sport into a
commercial enterprise which breeds nothing but injury and bitterness
for those concerned.
A quote from Bill Leiser's column yesterday describes the situation per
fectly. When an Army end missed and allowed Bob White to get four
yards, Captain Bill Yeoman barked to the Cadet player, "Let that happen
again, and you're through."
No Alibis
But don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to set up lame alibis by which
Stanford can get off the hook for its el foldo against the West Point
meanies.
Stanford played jxior, uninspired football. There is no other way to
put it. The Card offense was a joke. The defense was worse. And the
team lost by 43 points, the most humiliating defeat since the Michigan
game last year. And you have to go back to 1901 before that.
Stanford set West Coast football back at least five years, and whether
t could be helped or not, it was a
>low to the Pacific Coast Conference.
And who knows the answer to die
robiem? Our boys are just as big,
hey eat the same foods, and they
et as much sleep at night. So why
m't they block, tackle, run, pass,
atch, and just WANT to play foot
all as they do in the West Point,
outh Bend, and Big Nine football
amps?
Somewhere along the line, there
: a definite answer. But it's going
j take a good detective to discover

j take a good detective to discover
Stanford was a badly battered, bruised, and thoroughly beaten football
team when it returned to the Farm late Sunday night. The new machine
had not only been dctoured, it had been junked.
The Redshirts had simply not been mentally or physically ready to
meet Army, a team that plays real football. The Cadets don't mess around.
They play mean, vicious, and hungry football, and they play, strictly-to win.
They say every person sitting in Yankee Stadium last Saturday would
groan in sympathy when an Army man hit a Stanford ballcarrier. It hurt,
and it hurt bad. The string of Indian injuries was pi oof- enough of Army's
brutal and crushing attack.
Mitchell Out lor Season
Emery Mitchell, Stanford's one-man offense, had to be helped from
the field after having his knee torn to shreds. Mitchell had never been
hurt before, but this injury will keep him out of the Big Game and possi
| bly out of football for good.
A 1 Laakso, a fast-improving end, was actually ground into the dirt dur
! ing the first few minutes of play. On one particular pileup, half of Laakso's
I lace was left on the Yankee Stadium turf, and what was left looked more
like raw hamburger.
A! Rau. mainstay ol the tackle corps, was wiped out with an elbow
injury that will probably keep him out of the Big Game, too. At best,
Glubglub Rau won't be using his elbow any more this season.
Halfback Bob White, dependent on his speed for picking up yardage,
limped off the field Saturday after his ankle had been blasted out from
under him. White will favor his ankle for the rest of the season.
Mickey Titus was added to the disabled list when he bumped head-on
into a couple of Army boys who left him woozy with a slight head con
j cussion. Fullback Bud Klein will be out for the season with a bad leg.
j and when you add End Ken Rose, Tackle Gordon White, and Quarter
back Aubrey Devine to the badly-shaken list, you get a complete picture
of the Army tragedy. The shock troops were at their devastating best.
The list of injuries suffererd in the Army game was almost unbelievable.
Any chances for victory in the Big Game were blown sky-high, and even
the contest against the poor Montana team is going to be tough.
Army Is True Machine
Army's Coach Red Blaik has developed a true, cold, and calculating
gridiron machine. But you can have it. His payoff platoon system might
win games, but it destroys the color of collegiate competition.
When you see a defensive team that doesn't know one offensive play, and
and offensive team that thinks defense is another game entirely, you
know that football is changing from a spirited, glamorous sport into a
commercial enterprise which breeds nothing but injury and bitterness
for those concerned.
A quote from Bill Leiser's column yesterday describes the situation per
fectly. When an Army end missed and allowed Bob White to get four
yards, Captain Bill Yeoman barked to the Cadet player, "Let that happen
again, and you're through."
No Alibis
But don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to set up lame alibis by which
Stanford can get off the hook for its el foldo against the West Point
meanies.
Stanford played jxior, uninspired football. There is no other way to
put it. The Card offense was a joke. The defense was worse. And the
team lost by 43 points, the most humiliating defeat since the Michigan
game last year. And you have to go back to 1901 before that.
Stanford set West Coast football back at least five years, and whether
t could be helped or not, it was a
>low to the Pacific Coast Conference.
And who knows the answer to die
