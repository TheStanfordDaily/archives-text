Marchie Schwartz gave his badly
mattered charges a complete rest
esterday, as the varsity gridders
minted their broken bones and
>ainiul bruises which were picked
ip in the Army game last Saturday.
Trainer Connie Jarvis went to
vork in a hurry to patch up and
ape together the riddled football
nen so that they would be able to
ace Montana next weekend.
Faced with the aspect of losing
Lmory Mitchell for the entire sea
-011. Coach Schwartz will have to
ome up with another offense to
epluce that which he had formed
iround the energetic Emery.
Almost every regular on the
quad is either hobbling around or
as his arm in a sling this week,
'onsqeuently, hopes for the Big
)ame are shattered, although the
quad should be able to get by
â€¢lontana without too much strain.
The footballers will resume prac
ice today, but heavy workouts will
>e an impossibility.
