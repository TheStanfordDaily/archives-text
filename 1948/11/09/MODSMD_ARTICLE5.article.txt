# SIRO Receives Abundant Thanks
## 
### 
To the Students:
The annual Relief Fund Drive is
going on this week—but it's not
just another relief drive. This one
is different; this one is ours, be
; cause it's for students, from stu
, dents.
I was reading some of the let
ters written to SIRO to thank the
unknown friends at Stanford who
■ had sent packages abroad. There
were letters written in fine script
: on fine paper, and letters scrawled
I in pencil on scratch or graph paper.
I Some were written in eloquent Eng
lish. and some were the result of
scraping together words found in
an English dictionary. But they all
express the same surprise, grati
tude, and spirit of friendliness.
They all express the same hope
that they can rebuild a new life
from war's rubble, and the same
discovery that there are good peo
ple in the world who remember.
That's the important thing— to be
remembered! To know that some
one far away cares. That's why our
relief drive is vital. It's Stanford's
way of saying to students abroad,
"Yes, we remember."
