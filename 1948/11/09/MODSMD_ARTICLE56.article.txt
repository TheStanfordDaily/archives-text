# Chappie Coming Out; Grab a Copy Early
## 
### 
(Ed. note: Jerry Fruett. circu
lation manager of a campus pub
lication, humbly submits the fol
lowing blurb:)
Get up early tomorrow, kiddies!
Scamper down to the school -
house and get in the lines which
will form at the four corners of
the Quad, the Post Oilice. and the
Union. The Chappie's coming out
tomorrow, and you'll have to
light like mad to get a copy. The
Chaparral's business manager, a
cash-crazed capitalist, has decid
ed to print only 25 copies and
auction them oft' to the highest
bidders. So hock your Cad. cash
in your war bonds, and sell your
girl friend's body to the Med
School: you may have a tough
light to get a Chappie, but it's
worth it.
