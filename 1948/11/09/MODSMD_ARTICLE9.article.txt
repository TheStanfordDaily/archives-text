# Fraternities Will Publish Rushing Code
## 
### 
Interfraternity Council dissolved
the pledge of an illegally-rushed sec
ond-quarter freshman at its regular
meeting last week, Ted LeVino, IFC
president, disclosed today,
The pledge was dissolved by the
! majority vote of the fraternity house
presidents when it was learned that
other houses had refrained from
rushing the freshman because they
interpreted the rushing rules differ
ently than the house which pledged
him.
"This ambiguity was the natural
outgrowth of the IFC's necessity for
speed in writing the original draft of
the rules," LeVino explained. "When
we came back to school this fall we
had to act hastily to stop the wide
spread, yet erroneous feeling of fra
ternity men that last year's rushing
rules had died with the last day of
spring quarter.
"We Immediately drew up a set
of rules, incorporating some new
ideas along with last year's set. IFC
went over these rules last week, and,
after a few minor points had been
clarified, approved them. We hope

there will be no chance for misin
terpretation in the future."
Copies of these simplified rushing
and initiation rules will be mimeo
graphed in large numbers and dis
tributed in Encina, the Village, and
the fraternities. Additional copies
may be obtained at the IFC office in
the Student Union.
' All 24 fraternities have signed a
pledge to uphold the new rules," Le-
Vino added, "and to date, at least,
flagrant violations seem to be non
existent."
