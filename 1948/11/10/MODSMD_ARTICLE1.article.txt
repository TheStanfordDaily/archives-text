# Contributions to SIRO Far Behind Set Quota
## 
### 
Far behind the expected total
for the first two days of their
Stanford Relief Drive, solicitors
yesterday had turned in only
5369. "It is hoped," said Ward
Wengert, treasurer of lIR, "that this
low total is due to the fact that only
a few of the solicitors' report envel
opes have been turned in, and not
because students are not giving as
generously as they might." Last
year's total on the same day of the
drive, considered low at that time,
was $983.
Members of the Theta Xi house
have gone 100 per cent in their con
tributions. That is, they achieved the
quota set at $1.50 per member. The
only other living group reported by
last night as having gone 100 per
cent was Roble corridor 2-A.
In addition to their individual con
tributions to the drive, residents of
Village 208 voted to donate $50 of
their house money, earmarked for
foreign students.
Ward Wengert urged that all so
licitors turn in their report en
velopes daily as they are filled in
order to facilitate totaling the re
turns.
Proceeds of the Stanford Relief
Drive are to be divided between four
different organizations with 20 per
cent going to W.S.S.F., 30 per cent
to the Palo Alto Youth Fund, 20 per
cent to the UN Appeal for Children,
25 per cent to :he Stanford Educa
tion and Rehabilitation Fund, and
the 5 pr cent remaining will go
into a SIRO floating fund to be used
for such drives as the March of
Dimes, tuberculosis fund, and cancer
fund.
Archie Marshall, owner of Belt's
Oasis on El Camino, to help out the
drive, has offered a free beer to
every member of all men's resi
dences, except Encina, which reach
their quotas.
