(Editor's Note: The Daily con
tinues its coverage of ASSU can
didates' campaign platforms.)
SENIOR CLASS PRESIDENT
Sam J. Brenner—As seniors, our
most important task will be to in
crease our inadequate class treas
ury. Through a series of well
planned social events, we can
achieve both better unity and a
larger treasury. We 'Forty-niners
have the opportunity to make our
graduating year one of happy mem
ories and activities well performed.
Raymond R. "Ray" Haley — In
short, our class will be integrated
for activity if I am elected presi
dent. 'Forty-niners will enjoy a
Senior Prom of pre-war quality,
complete with a good name band,
a senior class day to top all func
tions. and an Excom that will really
represent all members.
Mill Iverson—This year, our last
one at Stanford, should be the best
one ol our four years spent here. I
would like to do my part in making
it just that by bringing the class
closer together through the social
lunctions and the class activities.
John R. "Jack" White—My plat
fonn is to loster a closely knit
Ires'.iman class organiztaion that
will work diligently on all fresh
man projects and activities and with

perseverance wil! carry these vari
ous aims to their successful com
pletion.
FRESHMAN CLASS PRESIDENT
tied Krcsscr — To maintain the
high standards the class of '52 has
a 1 ready set, we must first concen
trate on two essentials. We must

compile a large enough treasury
now to carry us through four years
at Stanford, and we must organize
an outstanding class Excom able to
develop our present ideas.
Way ne Alley—A class with such
tremendous potentialities as '52
needs only a leader who can de
velop these potentialities. If elect
ed president, I promise to bring to
the fore our great talent.
GRADUATE EXCOM
Marl; Hatfield—lt is my desire to
represent the interests of the grad
uate students of our campus on
Excom and to correlate those inter
ests with the programs and projects
of the entire student body.
Robert "Bob'' von Pagenhardt—l
support student government's pri
mary function—responsible investi
gation into student problems: Cellar
prices, University meals, rooters'
tickets for wives. I pledge support
for a Student Union with eating fa
cilities for off-campus students, stu
dent organization, minor sports, a
contributive student world policy,
and a responsible tnd liberal atti
tude toward future problems.

Ted Norton—The ASSU is always
confronted with special - interest
pressure groups and with would-be
leaders who talk well but do not
perform. Its perennial problem is to
do its work efficiently and impar
tially under such conditions. I have
no campaign promises, but such ex
perience as I have had in ASSU af
fairs is at the service of the stu
dent body for efficiency and im
partiality.
EXCOM S (ENCINA)
"Judge" Harris 011 — Elimination of 1
"lock-outs," no attendance roll calls.
Fncina laundry facilities, cheaper so
cial activities, and the fulfillment of
your requests are the foundation
upon which I solicit your vote.
FRESHMAN SECRETARV -
TREASURER
Marion L. Brummcll—(l) To set
a certain date for collection of dues.
(2) To collect all dues possible in
order to have better social functions 1
and a reserve fund. (3) To publi
cise the actions of Frosh Excom. I
(4) To have as many frosh as pos
sible active in class functions. (5) j
To have more publicity about the
Class of '52 and its actions.
Carol Caillett — My platform for j
secretary of the frosh class is 100
per cent organization. We want the
best class in Stanford's history, and
in order to have that, we have to j

have EVERY single person behind
EVERY single activity. We want l<;
set a standard, a high standard, that
next year's class will have to
up to.

MEN'S COUNCIL

Dale 11. Champion—This position
is one of service. It calls lor in
tegrity and willingness to assume
responsibility lor upholding the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code. My viewpoint is ob
jective and unbiased. Judgments
will be made upon the basis of fact
alone. I ask lor your vote to be one
of confidence and trust, and 1
pledge my best.
Everett L. Clark—ln my opinion,
although Men's Council is a judi
ciary body, it should also serve to
enlighten the students; to preveir
as well as to try offenses; to inter
pret and clarify rules in order to
avoid further misunderstandings
In short. Men's Council should be
both a punitive and educative body
SAC
Patrick DeTtoung — Platform: to
secure a larger athletic budget that
will provide proper equipment and
coaching for all sports, and to pro
vide for student-faculty-alumni di
rection of Stanford athletics. I will
work to re-establish the Board ot
Athletic Control. I will do my best
to represent faithfully your feelings
and opinions concerning Stanford's
athletic policy.
. .Allen Hoi ti bar—After the war. the
Board ol Athletic Control was re
olaced by the Stanford -Athletie
Council. With this change went the
word "control." "Control" of eth
nics is no longer under the direc
tion ol an athletic board but i>
con trolled by the Administration.
I'm fighting for a change to the old
3AC system.
