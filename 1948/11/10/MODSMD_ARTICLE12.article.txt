# Fire Fighters Halt Silverado Canyon Blaze

### 
SANTA ANA, Nov. 9 (/P) —A fire
fighting army today beat back flames
that had swept through the brush
almost to within scorching distance
of approximately 350 homes in Sil
verado Canyon.
Temporarily successful and aided
by decreasing winds, the weary
forces ledoubled their efforts to con
tain the fire in unpopulated side
canyons of the Santa Ana Moun
tains.
Three hundred men had formed a
solid line atop a ridge between Ladd
and Silverado canyons. The fire
was burning fiercely in Ladd and a
couple of its tongues lapped over
into Silverado. Flames crept down
the side of Silverado toward the
houses, many of them fine estates.
At one point the fire was within
100 yards of Silverado Community
Church.
The men dug furiously to create
firebreaks, using bulldozers and
hand tools. They had 38 pumper
trucks available and finally they
succeeded in running hose lines up
the slope. They drenched the fiames,
beat them back up to the ridgetop.
Then Joseph Sherman, state for
ester for Orange County, sighed in
relief and said: "Conditions are much
more favorable—with good luck in
the next day or so we migh< be able
to call Silverado Village safe."
Supervisor Hamilton Pyles of
Cleveland National Forest added
that the active fire front had been
reduced to five miles. It was not
yet controlled, but yesterday the
fire line was 18 miles long.
