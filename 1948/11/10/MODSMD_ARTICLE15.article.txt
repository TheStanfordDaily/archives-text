# Dulles Accuses Soviets of Blocking Action on Greece
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 9 (/P) â€” American
Delegate John Foster Dulles accused
the Soviet bloc tonight of trying to
frustrate the United Nations Assem
bly with a filibuster in the Greek
case.
The Soviet bloc heatedly denied
the charge, but members of the as
sembly's 58-nation political commit
tee showed their impatience by
clamping a 10-minutc limit on all
future speeches in the debate.
The vote to restric the discussions
was 42 to 1. Ales Bebler, Yugoslav
delegate, cast the lone vote against

the limit. He has spoken longer than
any other delegate on the question.
Dulles spoke up after Bebler had
demanded repeated roll call votes on
almost every decision the committee
made. For the past two days the
committee has been moving slowly
through a paragraph-by-paragraph
vote on a resolution sponsored by the
United States, Britain, France, and
China.
When the committee finally ad
journed tonight it had approved all
major provisions of the four-power

resolution.
The committee yesterday approved
paragraphs condemning Albania,
Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for aiding
Greek guerrillas and calling on them
to "cease forthwith."
