## Examination Files 
### 
The Honor Code Committee has released bound files of many
of last year's examination questions. The files, available for two
hour intervals, may be borrowed from the Reserve Bookroom in
the main Library by any student.
The central test files in the Library will eliminate one of the
basic inequalities in the academic gradinq system—the main
tenance of examination files, formerly restricted to students in
small men's and women's living qroups. Such exam records
have qiven a small percentage of men and women an advantage
over other students in their preparation for future exams.
Future success of the library test files will be dependent upon
the continued co-operation of the University's academic depart
ments with the Honor Code Committee. One social science de
partment vetoed the test files project. However, another large
social sciences department, which in the past has retained all
copies of its tests, was very co-operative in turning over copies
of last year's examinations to the Committee.
Since no University department is required to submit copies
of the tests for filing, a small percentage of students will continue
to benefit from the use of their living group files as long as
library records are incomplete. Regardless of what method a de
partment employs to recover all copies of a test after it is given,
some students invariably will take extra copies or will pencil
notes on examination questions.
The existence of exam libraries may be considered as nega
tive educational value because they will cut down required
study hours. Perhaps this is true, but the files also will provide
men and women with a clearer survey outline of a particular
course's most important aspects.
