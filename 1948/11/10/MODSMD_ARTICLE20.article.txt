To the Editor:
As transferring juniors, we feel that we must protest affairs like last
weekend's Ye Olde Devonshire Daunce. There is no reason, we believe,
why a dance of this type shouldn't take place right here on campus instead
ot somewhere in the woods. It is supposed to be a class function to be
enjoyed by the entire student body. Surely our campus is the more
logical place for it.
Oh. we know the witty, glowing answers the Junior Class Executive
Committee will probably give to this letter as to why the dance is being
held where it is. "A magnificent view from San Francisco to San Jose
under a blanket of stars is only one of the features of the Devonshire
Ciub! There, one can have huge fireplaces crackling with good cheer to
warm the hearts of everyone! There, one can find refreshments that can
never be served at a campus dance!" How disgusting can you get?
As far as scenery is concerned, is this going to be a dance or a sight
seeing tour? Who needs fireplaces at dances? If the Pavilion was good
enough for Cugat and the Homecoming Dance, it's good enough for any
dance. And, as for those refreshments that "can never be served at any
campus dance," what kind of person needs refreshments of that type to
enjoy himself? Our fathers and mothers got along without them. So
can we.
We, as clean-living students, who can enjoy ourselves with less pre
tentious surroundings and "cokes" are not going to Ye Olde Devonshire
Daunce. How about you?
