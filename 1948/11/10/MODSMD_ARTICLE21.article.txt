# Alumnus Homesick for Stanford
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I think you will be interested in the following quotation from a letter
just received from Jim Welch, now at the Harvard Graduate School of
Business Administration:
"Needless to say there is no comparison that can be made between
Harvard and Stanford that would not be in the latter's favor. Although
1 do like it here at the Business School, it never fails to amaze me at what
it costs in addition to the tuition. The tuition fee is for tuition only. In
addition, there is a $15 charge for medical facilities, $4 to join the Student
Association, and $1 to become a member of the Co-op in order to share
in the rebates, $15 for the use of the athletic facilities, $15 to park a car
in the B.S. lot, if you should own a car, and to see a football game we
have to pay spectator rates to sit between the goal and 15-yard lines.
1 never realized how fortunate I was at Stanford, and there's no doubt
in my mind as to which school I should pay my homage.
"I became pathetically homesick for Stanford whenever I have occasion
to write a letter to someone residing in the vicinity of Palo Alto. Through
the courtesy of several friends, I have contrived to follow Stanford's grid
it on wars through the San Francisco Chronicle's green-sheet. I was over
joyed to hear about the victory over UCLA last Saturday, and even
went so f; ( r as to send a congratulatory telegram to Marchie Schwartz.
I now feci justified in having joined the Buck-of-the-Month."
