PHOTOC i EMC ST A NFORD:
Sunny Sunday is camera day on
the Farm, which means that ama
teur and professional camera fiends
invade the campus and shoot up the
place with everything from palm
sized Brownies to ce'.luloid-fed IG
millimeters.

World-renowned architect Frank
Lloyd Wright once pointed to Hoo
ver lower and said. "An architec
tural misfit." Yet the home of the
documents on War, Revolution, and
Peace is one of the most photo
graphed objects on the campus.

Wright said of the rest of the
campus: "The most beautiful in the
country." Let the shutter-snappers
be the judge.

Impressive for the knowledge it
holds is the Library, Stanford's
fourth. Behind its uppermost por
tals are the confines of the Albert
Bender Room, a room of rare books
and rare visitations, where one
must leave pens and briefcases out
side while they examine the prizes
of the literary world. Below and to
the outside is the favorite meeting
place of book-weary students.

Perhaps the most photographed
object on campus, if not Hoover
Tower, is the Memorial Church,
with its 47 figures on a mosaic fa
cade, portraying the Sermon on the
Mount. The present mosaic is an
exact but clearer duplicate of the
original scene, which was destroyed
in the 1906 earthquake. The stone
design came to Stanford from the
studios of Antonio Salviali and Co.
in Venice.

The Inner Quad, nearly three
acres in size, has left its lasting im
age on the film of many visitors.
Yet not one out of 20 students could
pick out from the hundreds of
sandstone blocks the one that was
laid first by Senator Stanford on
May 14, 1887. The block, quarried
from the nearby foothills, is marked
by a metal plaque and rests at the
northeast corner of the Mathemat
ics Building, the cornerstone of an
education which has sent many
thousands of students into the world
the better fit to occupy it.

And off campus, but part of the
tradition of "The Farm," is the
scrawny Palo Alto Redwood, the
symbol of Stanford in letter and
spirit. Here, on the banks of San
Francisquito Creek, the weather
beaten timber guards the gateway
to Palo Alto, so named by Don Gas
par de Portola, who camped be
neath the tree for three days in
17G9 before continuing on his trek
that led to the discovery of San
Francisco Bay.
Palo Alto, or Tall Tree, owes its
name to this 950-year-old redwood
and its twin, which has since fallen.

POCKET FULL OF NOTES:
If you didn't go to the Army
game (and we didn't) you probably
are the richer for it. But the poor
civilian spectator paid plenty. Re
served seats were $7 and 84.80, the
latter classification located in the
corners of the field. To top it off.
the usher shows the patron his seat,
kindly brushes it off — and then
places palm up for a tip. There
were no half-time stunts, and at the
end of the game no gun sounded.
The referee just picked up the ball
and said—"That's all, boys."

Suggestion of the week: That
Stanford give Woodpecker Lodge to
the Audubon Society. The place
supports more red caps than Grand
Central Station.
