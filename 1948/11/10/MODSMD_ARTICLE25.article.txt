JOE COLLEGE DEPARTMENT
Don't sec much of the good old-fashioned collegiate horseplay any more.
In bygone days Joe College came through with some clever pranks, but
the practice seems to have degenerated into nothing more than property
damage. Now, at last, we're beginning to see a trend toward those
good old days.

Friday night three hapless Sig Chi actives fell prey
to their pledges. Found themselves in front of the
Varsity Theater in Paly .... in a cage, yet. And
tacked to their cage was a neat, if uncomplimentary,
sign:
"These gorillas escaped from the Sigma Chi Circus
Dance and were found swinging from trees near the
Stanford Stadium."
Not to be outdone, the Alpha Sig pledges provided

a bit of discomfort for their brothers. While the actives slept, various
items were removed from the house .... silverware, a bunch of wooden
horseshoesâ€”large, economy size (toilet seats to you), and the stairway
to the sleeping porch. The loss was discovered when a half-awake active
left the sleeping porch via the stairless stairway.
Then there was last week's Phi Dolt saga. Seems the Cal Phi Delt
chapter sent some midnight visitors down to abscond with their brothers'
dinner bell, a converted locomotive bell.
Well, several quick-witted members of another Farm fraternity got
wind of the plot and decided it'd be real funny if they let the Cal boys
make ofT with (he bell and then took it away from them.
Parked in the driveway of Storey House, our boys saw the Cal plotters
drive off in a hurry and gave chase. They lost the Cal car in Palo Alto,
figured they'd head for Bayshore, and decided to drive up Bayshore and
wait for them.
Near Redwood City, they found the Cal car, a shiny '49 Ford, parked
along the highway. Stopping in front of the Ford they nearly got control
of the situation, but the visiting Phi Delts locked their car doors and
drove away.
After a short chase up the highway, our boys started thinking again and
figured the visitors would go across the San Mateo Bridge. So they called
the bridge and explained that a car carrying stolen property would be
there in a few minutes. They described the car and the bridge attendant
agreed to notify the Highway Patrol.
Unfortunately, our boys figured wrong. Cal picked another bridge.
It could have been a good story but for one detail. On the way home,
our boys stopped at the Phi Delt house and found that the bell was
still there. Red faces?

LAUGH-FOR-THAT-GRADE DEPARTMENT
And then we're reminded, of the remark a professor recently made about
a g'irl whose low-cut dresses distracted him:
"If her dress gets any lower, I'll have to look into it."

WHY PROFS GET GRAY DEPARTMENT
One of the Law School classes discussed a touchy legal situation at
great length the other day, and the prof finally closed the discussion and
asked one of his would-be lawyers what he would do about the problem.
"Get a lawyer," sez the legal-eagle.
