# War? Don't Ask the Experts
## 
### HAL BOYLE 
NEW YORK. Nov. 9 </P).—lt is
unlikely the next war —if there is
one —will be fought as experts pre
dict today.
Wars have as many surprises as
j women.
Top-ranking veterans of one war
i are often the poorest guessers on
how the following war will be
waged. They tend to overrate one
new weapon too much, or they rely
too heavily on methods that won
them victories in the past.
The other day I picked up for
five cents at a second-hand book
stall a battered copy of "The Riddle
of the Rhine," by Major Victor Le
febure. He was a British chemical
"'nrfare specialist in the first World
, War.
His book was published in 1923.
| It illustrates why seasoned military
j leaders should be chary of putting
into print any predictions about the
| future of their own profession.
The book contained part of an
j article by Maj. Gen. Amos Alfred
I Fries, then chief of the U.S. Chem
ical Warfare Service, pointing out
that poison gas caused 75.000 of
! the 275.000 American first World
! War casualties. Gen. Fries prophe
| sied flatly:
"No other invention since that of
| gunpowder has made so profound
a change in warfare as gas is mak
! ing. or will make, in Ihe future."
But did it? Gas didn't play as
i profound a role in the second World
War as Garand rifles, powdered
! eggs, or the Red Cross doughnut
I girls.
The same book quotes an even
more interesting statement by Gen
eral Debeney, director of the
French College of Warfare. This
I distinguished Gallic warrior had a
I theory that attacking aircraft could
j be brought down better by poison
I gas missiles than by conventional
j anti-aircraft shells.
Said he:
"It would be much more effective
to create, for example, a sphere of
poisoned air a mile round the air
! plane, instead of trying to hit the
' machine directly with bits of the
shell."
i I wonder how General Debeney

would feel if he re-read that today?
He apparently didn't foresee bomb
j ers with enclosed cockpits.
The high commanders of all Al
lied armies after 1918 appear to
have predicted future battles too
| much in terms of static trench war
fare.
A young upstart French captain.
1 Charles de Gaulle, found promotion
slow after 1928. when he dared
prophesy the doom of France unless
it built longer-range and more mo
bile tanks. Billy Mitchell met an
even rougher fate in the American
| army for championing airpower too
J robustly.
j But Germany proved that De
Gaulle and Mitchell wore light. She
almost won the second World War
I because of her early lead in tank
and plane strength.
Today the atom bomb dominates
much military thinking even more
than poison gas did after the first
World War, because there is no
! known defense against it.
But as to predictions that it will
I certainly be the major weapon of
, any war to come, or that it will in
itself save the land—well, don't for
get the Maginot Line was once
more promising than Santa Claus.
The trouble lies always in the
; enemy. You never can be sure
; what the scoundrel is going to come
'at you with.
