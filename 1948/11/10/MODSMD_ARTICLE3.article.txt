# Movie Portrays Post-war Scenes
## 
### 
"Suffer Little Children" is being
shown in connection with the Stan
ford Relief Drive this afternoon and
Friday afternoon at 4:15 in Cub
berley Auditorium. It shows the
condition of children all over the
world as a result of the war, and
some of the temporary measures
set up by relief organizations to al
leviate them.
Relief measures shown in this film
are similar to those enacted by the
UN Appeal for Children to which a
large part of the funds collected
through the Stanford Relief Drive
will be allocated.
Bob von Pagenhardt, president of
the lIR. urged that all students see
both this film and "Passport to No
where," another important docu
mentary film on the same theme, in
order to acquaint themselves with
the terrible conditions prvealent
throughout the world.
