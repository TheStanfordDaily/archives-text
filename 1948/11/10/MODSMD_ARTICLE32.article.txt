### 
A group of California students, in
direct violation of the agreement
between California and Stanford
University, raided the Farm last
weekend leaving painted "C's" on
buildings and walks.
The recent agreement between
the two universities provides pen
| alties as severe as expulsion from
school for students defacing the
' others' campus.
Damage includes four blue "C's"
j painted on the wall to the left of
the front door of the Hoover Li
: brary, signs of an attempt to burn
a "C" on the oval lawn in the Quad,
and a number of cream - colored
| "C's" painted on the Hoover Li
j brary's sidewalks and Santa Teresa
I Street near Lagunita. A blue "C"
also was painted on the sidewalk
in front of Engineering corner.
Paint was also smeared over the
door and adjoining windows of the
; Hoover Library. So far only the
| paint smeared on the doors and
j windows of the Library has been
removed.
