Leapin' Lizards, kids—it's Chap
pie Day!
And to the first. 50 of you little
monsters who buy a Chappie, the
Old Boy is giving away absolutely
free a genuine plastic, full-scale,
life-size, so-realistic-you-expect-it
to-breather, Sexy. •
What fun you can have pulling
your sexy on your buddies! Be the
first kiddie to your psych section to
have one. If your teacher complains,
quote him the immoral words of G.
Paranoid Schmeckenklipp: "A sexy
in the hand is worth two."
So boom down to Quad and get
your Chappie. You, too, may be a
lucky winner.
