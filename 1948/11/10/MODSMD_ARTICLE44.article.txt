RAY NAGEL, UCLA's versatile quarterback, now
loads the Pacific Coast Conference in total offense.
Nagel's specialty is flipping the ball, although he is
pictured here in a different tense. He is the only
competition Oregon's Van Brocklin has for All-Con
ference billing at quarterback. Nagel played only 31
minutes last year but has been the Bruin's main of
fensive threat this season.
