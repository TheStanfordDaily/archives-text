## 
### 
The Sigma Chi Fizzers let off
i quite a bit of that extra steam yes
| terday afternoon as their offense
clicked smoothly for a 20 to (5 vic-
J tory over the Alpha Delt I squad.
Vic Palmieri broke the scoring
ice midway in the first half when
j he snagged a touchdown pass from
Bob Mann. The accurate pitching
of Marin also led to the second
Fizzer tally in the third quarter,
with Denny Tuffanelli on the re
j ceiving end of this one.
Early in the final period Fizzer
Bud Richter broke loose for a 50-
\ yard romp to pay dirt on what was

easily the outstanding run of the
contest.
DU I also found an easy mark
yesterday as they rolled to an easy
21 to 0 victory over the Zetes. Cald
well picked up a blocked kick and
packed it into the end zone in the
first half, while the passing of Pres
ton accounted for two second-half
tallies for the DU's.
In other mural contests played
yesterday, Phi Psi took a 7 to 0 de
cision over Kappa Sig I; Kappa Sig
II whipped DU II "2. to 0; and the
Mangling Medics battled the boys
from Crothers to a scoreless tie.
