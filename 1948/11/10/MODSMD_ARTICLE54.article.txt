## Army Backs Roll Up Yards 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 9 UP).â€”With
two games to go, Gil Stephenson
and Bobby Stuart of Army are a
cinch to shatter the best ball-carry
ing record set by their illustrious
predecessors at West Point. Felix
(Doc) Blanchard and Glenn Davis.
Figures given out today by the
National Collegiate Athletic Bureau
show that Stuart is the nation's No.
2 rushing star, with 772 yards, and
that Stephenson is No. 4 with 761,
the result of brilliant performances
in last week's rout of Stanford
here.
Stan Heath of Nevada remained
the nation's top passer and over
all offensive star despite his team's
one-sided loss to Santa Clara last
week. He picked up 114 more yards
to place his total at 1.75'.
Heath already has connected with
113 throws for a total gain of 1,758
yards. Jim Finks ot Tulsa, the
runner-up. has hit his receivers
with 89 and should be good for
another 11 before he calls it a sea
son.
