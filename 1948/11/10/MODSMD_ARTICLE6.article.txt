### 
"Only the Nationalists can bring
[ order out of the chaos in China," as
! serted Dr. Shau Wing Chan of
| Stanford lust night in a Tuesday
J Evening Series lecture in Memorial
! Auditorium.
, Dr. Chan, associate professor of
Chinese and humanities, commented
on the political and economic up
heaval in China from which he has
| recently returned after a six-month
j tour.
"By gaining the support and confi
dence of the 'Chinese people by
| agrarian and social reforms, and
modernizing industry," said Dr.
Chan, "the Nationalist government
; can save the country from the hands
| of the Communists."
Communists Threaten
"During the past decade the Na
i tionalist government has ignored the
. Chinese people," he continued. "The
j Communists have swept in, and to
day the Communists threaten to cap
i ture the whole of Central China.
| The war is a struggle by Chinese
against Chinese, played upon by
forces from the outside."
'"The spiraling inflation of Nation
j alist currency," the piofessor said, "is
] a reflection of the strain of two
' decades of war between the Na
j tionalists and Communists; govern
ment inefficiency in solving the
problem, and general distrust of the
government by the Chinese people."
Smuggling
Smuggling and black market op
| erations have become nation-wide,
even after the attempted stabiliza
tion of Chinese currency last August.
"The economic situation is so out
of hand," observed Dr. Chan, "that
the premier and his advisor have
tendered their resignations."
Possible solutions toward eco
nomic stabilization suggested by Dr.
Chan were: increased production,
national control and confidence in
the "gold dollar" currency, price
fixing, and suppression of the black
i market.
