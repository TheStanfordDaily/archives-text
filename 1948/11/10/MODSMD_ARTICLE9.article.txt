Students will go to the polls today to choose freshman and
senior class presidents, five Excom representatives, an SAC
member, a men's council member, and a freshman class secre
tary-treasurer. Voting booths will open at 8:30 a.m.
Coming one week after a national election and an enthusiastic

primary which drew 104 candidates,
today's ASSU final election has hit
the Farm in the wake of a wave o
election enthusiasm. Except for 17
eager Frosh office seekers, most o
the 41 candidates, lacking funds ar.ci
spirit, have let their campaigns siidt
since the record primaries of a week
ago. Neverthless, a good turnout of
voters is expected, and none of the
primary winners is considered a sure
winner in the finals.

preferential system, each voter
checking the three candidates in his
order of preference.

to handle the balloting. Booths i
