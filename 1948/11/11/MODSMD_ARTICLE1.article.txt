## 
### 
The mercury has crept one
eighth of the way up the tube.
Of the $12,000 goal. $1,564 has
been turned in by Stanford Re
lief Fund solicitors. Only two
more days remain before the drive
ends, remind Gretchen Blaesing
and Alf Heller, co-chairmen of the
drive.
"Scattered returns may account
for the low relief drive returns,"
.stated Ward Wengert, drive treas
urer. All solicitors are urged to turn
in their envelopes as soon as they
are filled.
Free beer has been promised to
every member of each men's living
group, except Encina, that goes over
the $1.50 per man quota. Archie
Marshall of Belt's Oasis is setting
up the drinks. A ticket to the Stan
ford Theater will also be awarded
to the first 12 solicitors fulfilling
their quota.
Deadline for returns is set for
tomorrow and Saturday. All.campus
solicitors must turn in their en
velopes by 10:30 Saturday morning
to Ward Wengert in the basement
of the Women's Clubhouse. Village
contributions should be turned over
to Mrs. G. V. Martin in the Village
director's office no later than 5 p.m.
tomorrow.
