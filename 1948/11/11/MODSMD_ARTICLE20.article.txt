# Frosh Guard Goes to Work
## 
### 
Tomorrow night opens a week of
ceaseless vigilance by the freshman
class men to protect the Stanford
campus from the Cal painters' union.
The responsibility of keeping the
Farm clean from ''C's" and other
Cal publicity rests solely with the
men of '52.
Special haircuts are planned for
the Cal men caught in defacing jobs.
Cattle shears and other utensils wijl
be used for haircuts featuring a
shave with a large "S" on the top of
each trespasser's head.
Claude Rosenberg i.s in charge of
campus defense.
Watches start this Friday night
and last through next Thursday from
7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Each wing will take
a six-hour shift on one night. This
shift will be divided so that half the
wing protects the campus for three
hours and the other half for the re
maining hours.
On Saturday night, because of so
cial distractions, there will be no spe
cial wing assigned to the watch. A
sign-up list will be posted for the
100 men needed, 25 being required
for each three-hour shift.
Twenty-five Cal men were caught
two years ago, and '52 is out to beat
that record, according to Rosenberg.
Watches for this Stanford tradition
are compulsory, and no exceptions
will be made.
