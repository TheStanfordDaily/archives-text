# DAILY EDITORIALS
## The 						Dishonorable Bear

Once again oiir campus has been painted and burned. And
once again the Daily Californian has eulogized the raiders in a
Jront-page article with phrases like these: "Even the hallowed
traditions on the Farm weren't missed. The tall, slim, silo-like
building (known to the public as the Hoover Tower), is drenched
with blue and gold paint."
. The raiders were proud of the fact that they did no
property damage .... they went home, tired but jubilant."
The San Francisco Examiner, described Stanford reaction as
follows:
"Before the day was gone. Stanford students were indig
nantly demanding, "What do you mean, no damage?" and edi
tors of the Stanford Daily were perspiring over some reportedly
ied hot editorials."
The Examiner was premature about the editorial. We didn't
start work on a red hot editorial until today—when we read the
account in the Cal daily. That the Californian editor would give
f.acit approval to such vandalism by glorifying destructive work
of Cal raiders is hard to believe, especially since raids are in
direct violation of the pact signed between California and
Stanford.
That the California raiders and the Daily Californian can
claim that lawns and the Hoover Tower are "legitimate" targets
is even more unthinkable. And if defacing of the tower is not
property damage, we wonder just what will satisfy the Cal
people, perhaps dynamiting of the structure. After several days'
work, the men from the Corporation Yard still have not been
able to remove the paint on and around the tower.
Cal's raiding tactics are hardly in the spirit of honorable con
cuct between the two campuses as evidenced in the signing of
ihe no-damage pact. Painting the Hoover Tower, furthermore,
harms them in the public eye as well—as would any similar
Stanford venture at Cal.
Moreover, the raids are a little premature to be considered as
part of "Big Game fever," especially since the painting has been
going on since the beginning of fall quarter. We venture to say
that the Cal raiders will not show up after the freshmen establish
iheir protective patrols this weekend.
