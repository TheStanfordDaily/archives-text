## Bull Session 
### 
Dear Dad
In response to the demands oi absolutely no one, this morning's Bull
Session will not be titled "Bull Session." It will, instead, be called "Dear
Dfd. This title will undoubtedly strike you as bearing a distinct simi-
J.'-rity to another column found on this page senii-regularly. Let me
;ay here and now that any connection between "Dear Dad" and "Dear
Mom" is probably by marriage.

On the face of this thing, I can see only two rea
sons for calling this morning's column "Dear Dad."
The first one is to prove that it's a wise man who
knows his own father. The second is that I'm too
lazy to write letters home. I'll just clip this piece
out of the paper and send it along to the old boy.
I guess I really should make an effort to write
home more than I do. After all, friends will come
and friends will go, but there's none quite like your
own "Mom and Dad." (From the motion picture of
the same name.) But somehow, I just can't seem to

find the time for writing letters. By the time I study for my classes (both
if them), write this column, and deliver my paper route for the Palo
Alto Times, the day is just about shot to hell.
But I love the newspaper business. I wouldn't do any other kind of
â€¢work, even if I could. Sometimes I get very discouraged trying to
Write good copy, but there are other times when I feel sure that I'm
making great progress. Just the other day in the Stadium press box,
Bill Leiser of the San Francisco Chronicle said to me, ". . . . move over,
will ya, kid, you're sitting on my lunch!" Just think of the connotations
behind that sentence!
Let's see. Where was I? Oh yes .... "Dear Dad." What'll I tell him?
How ahout that girl I was parked with the other night in the cactus
garden? She was quite a girl. I said "So help me, I'll kiss you." She
said "So kiss me, I'll help you!"
How about telling him about my roommate? I'm beginning to wonder
-bout that fellow. I asked him the other night if he liked girls, and he
said, "Nah, I like my vice versa." Well, say!
I guess that's about enough introductory remarks. Now let's get down
to the heart of this essay. H6rc it is ... . "Dear Dad."
Dear Dad:
No news.
BILL.
