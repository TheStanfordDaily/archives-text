Dear Mom:
The past few days have been the
sccnc of a large-scale feud between
the boys of 377 and our neighbors
directly below us. It all started with
a misplaced waste-basket of water.
Now it will take several barrels of
water to put out the fire. All hell
broke out last night when I re
turned to my peaceful Encina room
from a midnight stag party.
I opened the door and it fell off.
I staggered across the room, tripped
over a rope, and fell in a tub of
water. After removing my drip
ping clothes, I stepped into my
knotted pajamas. None the worse
for wear, I headed for the wash
basin. I splashed in the icy water
and washed away the lipstick
marks. When I pulled the plug, I
felt a cold sensation on my bare
toes as the water ran out of the
missing drain pipes.
Things were in bad shape. Mildly
disgusted, I turned on the light
switch but the globes were gone.
Worn out. I strode to my bed,
pulled back the covers, and woke
up a neatly coiled water snake. I
gave him a flick into the overturned
waste basket and took over the bed
myself. I was lulled to sleep by
jingling coke bottles breaking on
the cement three stories below me.
* This moning every seat in our
wing was gone. Those on the floor
below were occupied. I had to read
the morning Dippy elsewhere.
It's lucky Pete Brown will live in
Encinasylum only one year.
