# Experts Say No Truman Third Term
## 
### Associated Press 
Chances are President Truman
won't seek a "third term" in 1952.
He's far more likely to use his
newly won vote of confidence to
help pick another Democratic can
didate.
Long before last Tuesday's voting
one of Mr. Truman's close associ
ates said it was a "million-to-one
bet" he wouldn't run again if elected
in. his own right. The President will
be G8 in 1952.
The Truman victory may prove to
have a far deeper effect on the in
ternal affairs of both big labor feder l
ations than meets the eye.
AFL President William Green was
decidedly pro-Truman. Some of his
colleagues were partial to Dewey.
Had the Republican won. 75-year
old Green's retirement might have
been hastened. He may still wish to
step out at the AFL's national con
vention this month after 24 years in
the job.
If he does, his successor doubtless
will he a pro-Truman man. Out
standing among these is George M.
Harrison, head of the Brotherhood of
Railway and Steamship Clerks.
The fact that the Wallace Progres
sives failed to knock Mr. Truman out
of victory may be a factor in keeping
left-wing unions in the CIO.
Left-wing leaders supported Wal
lace despite official Truman endorse
ment by the CIO. If Wallace's cam
paign had aided tiie Republicans
materially, right - wing CIO leaders
would have demanded a showdown.
They still may, but the size of the
Truman victory has softened anti-
Wallace feeling among more conser
vative CIO elements, who are in the
majority.
T he labor organizations already are
busy pepping up their members 1o
"vote right" (Democratic, they mean)
in the off-year Congressional elec
tions of 1950.
It's a good bet, too, they will even
co-operate a great deal moreâ€”pos
sibly amalgamating into a single po
litical action group.
Labor often has split its vote. This
year it lined up against Taft-Hartley
Act advocates and now is quite im
pressed with what it can do working
together.
