## Those Off-Campus Dances 
### 
To the Editor:
The letter in Wednesday's Daily of Messrs. Sheen, Cook. Kluga, and
Becker fills me with compassion. These "clean living" (sic) junior transfers
have passed up a good thing. I went to the dance and have only con
gratulations for the Class of 1950.
The affair was as good as promised. Consumption of alcohol was
moderate and in good taste, even though the bartenders stopped using
shot glasses. These juniors should take a drink sometime, just a small
one. They might like it. In fact, if they look me up, I'll stand one round.
Campus dances are very nice, but those in the Pavilion and Women's
Gym have tended to follow the same monotonous pattern and can be
very dull. The Pavliion was not good enough for Cugat or anyone else.
It has poor acoustics, is difficult to decorate, has awkward seating for a
dc.nce, and smells of good, honest sweat.
To go somewhere else once in a while is a welcome relief. This isn't
Podunk JC.
