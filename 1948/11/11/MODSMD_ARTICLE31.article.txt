# Internationality Must Supersede
## 
### 
To the Editor:
â€¢ What Messrs. Allen, Cusick, et a!., seem to be overlooking in their recent
assignations of nationality, e.g., Irish. American, or Irish-American, is that
today of far greater importance is the fact that the status of internationality
must supersede all others if there are to be tomorrows for anyone.
