## Costly Binges Painful 
### 
Prophet by experience: Drink, I
drank, drunk the night before . . . !
A hangover. You know what that
is—a hcadache built for a hippo- '
potamus.
Hangovers,_it is estimated, cost
our nation $1,000,000,000 annually. |
A habitual alcoholic costs his em
ployer each year in absenteeism
just $550. Divide those figures and
we find roughly that there should
be some 1,818,181.8 alcoholics in
our nation. At least that will take i
care of the working alcoholics.
Saw a couple of business men in i
a Frisco bar and grill the other
day during the dinner hour who I
'ooked like they were trying to i
drown each other, but then you !
know this bar whiskey. The flesh
was willing but the spirits were |
weak,
Pretty soon they prepared to
leave, and one wavered over to the !
other one and said, "Sho long, Ja
mie boy, gotta get back to work. !
Ihanksh for the lunch." But they
probably had plush offices to sleep
it off in. That's what a college ed
ucation will do for you . . . the of
fice, I mean.
Talking of absenteeism, though. I
had a friend who loved his nightly
snifters, but it got so his snifters
turned into draughts. He was try
ing to rid himself of the habit. His
main mental block was the tavern
he had to pass on his way home in j
the evening. One evening he finally 1
made it past, non - stop. Several ;
blocks farther on, still under severe
self-control, his face lit up with a j
smile. "Well done, Joe, me boy,"
he said to himself. "Come back and
I'll treat you."
And speaking of snifters in turn
here, the ancient islanders of the
Danube, Ernest Hix says, made a ;
strong alcoholic drink, then inhaled
it until they became intoxicated . . .
a very nice out for those who don't

'ike the taste of the stuff. Maybe
Mitchum is overlooking a market
here.
An old story that periodically
goes the round of each generation
is that if you soak cigarettes in cof
fee, dry them out and smoke them
you can get looped. I suppose you
actually could do it, though, with
this sea-island snifter potion. At
least something ought to happen.
Chances are that you would
merely come up with a case of
chromatopsia — caused by overin
dulgence in coffee and tobacco,
nervous exhaustion, hysteria, or
eye ailments. The Better Vision In
stitute says people in this classifi
cation don't have to go on a binge
to see pink elephants.
\ou don't have to go on a binge
in the Pa.ouse Hills of Washington
to see things, either. Have you ever
seen a purple pheasant? People in
that area who see purple, red.
.Green, or yellow pheasants are be
ing asked to report them, but not
for the reason you think. The col
ored fowl are real. They are a part
of some research being carried on
by four seniors in wildlife manage
ment at the Washington State Col
lege. But stop and think what you
would do if you came suddenly
across one without foreknowledge.
Which reminds me of the story
my favorite bartender told me not
long ago—the night after my last
mid-term, to be exact. "A pink
elephant, a green rat, and a polka
dotted snake walked into the cock
tail bar one afternoon. The bar
tender (you know what a bartender
is—one of those people who bring
you into contact with the spirit
world), the bartender looked up,
i»lanc»'d at his watch, and said.
'You're a little early, boys. He
hasn't come in yet.'"
Reminds me of the time I got my
buddy so drunk it took two hotel
porters .to put me to bed.

A hangover. You know what that
is—a hcadache built for a hippo- '
potamus.
Hangovers,_it is estimated, cost
our nation $1,000,000,000 annually. |
A habitual alcoholic costs his em
ployer each year in absenteeism
just $550. Divide those figures and
we find roughly that there should
be some 1,818,181.8 alcoholics in
our nation. At least that will take i
care of the working alcoholics.
Saw a couple of business men in i
a Frisco bar and grill the other
day during the dinner hour who I
'ooked like they were trying to i
drown each other, but then you !
know this bar whiskey. The flesh
was willing but the spirits were |
weak,
Pretty soon they prepared to
leave, and one wavered over to the !
other one and said, "Sho long, Ja
mie boy, gotta get back to work. !
Ihanksh for the lunch." But they
probably had plush offices to sleep
it off in. That's what a college ed
ucation will do for you . . . the of

Talking of absenteeism, though. I
had a friend who loved his nightly
snifters, but it got so his snifters
turned into draughts. He was try
ing to rid himself of the habit. His
main mental block was the tavern
he had to pass on his way home in j
the evening. One evening he finally 1
made it past, non - stop. Several ;
blocks farther on, still under severe
self-control, his face lit up with a j
smile. "Well done, Joe, me boy,"
he said to himself. "Come back and
I'll treat you."
And speaking of snifters in turn
here, the ancient islanders of the

An old story that periodically
goes the round of each generation
is that if you soak cigarettes in cof
fee, dry them out and smoke them
you can get looped. I suppose you
actually could do it, though, with
this sea-island snifter potion. At
least something ought to happen.
Chances are that you would
merely come up with a case of
chromatopsia — caused by overin
dulgence in coffee and tobacco,
nervous exhaustion, hysteria, or
eye ailments. The Better Vision In
stitute says people in this classifi
cation don't have to go on a binge
to see pink elephants.
\ou don't have to go on a binge

seen a purple pheasant? People in
that area who see purple, red.

would do if you came suddenly

across one without foreknowledge.
Which reminds me of the story
my favorite bartender told me not
long ago—the night after my last
mid-term, to be exact. "A pink
elephant, a green rat, and a polka
dotted snake walked into the cock
tail bar one afternoon. The bar
tender (you know what a bartender
is—one of those people who bring
you into contact with the spirit
world), the bartender looked up,
i»lanc»'d at his watch, and said.
'You're a little early, boys. He
hasn't come in yet.'"
Reminds me of the time I got my
buddy so drunk it took two hotel
porters .to put me to bed.
