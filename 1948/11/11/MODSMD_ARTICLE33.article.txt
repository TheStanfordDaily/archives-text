### The Associated Press 
The House Un-American Activi- !
ties Committee probably will lose its |
role as "Page-one committee" of'
Congress as a result of Tuesday's
balloting.
Rep. Wood, (D-Ga.) is in line to
resume his old post as chairman,
replacing Rep. Thomas (R-N.J.).j
Wood is nothing like the showman ;
♦ hat Thomas is. The committee was
comparatively quiet under his direc
tion in the last Democratic Con- |
gress.
Farmers can expect Mr. Truman
and the new Congress to strengthen
farm commodity price supports.
It apparently was weakness in the
present program, enacted by the Re
publican Congress, that put many
normally Republican farm belt
states in the Truman column.
The Truman victory does not
mean higher farm prices. It prob
ably means greater effort to pre
farm price collapse than could have 1
been made under present laws and
conditions.
Insiders expect a house-cleaning j
in the State Department which will i
go far beyond the resignations of

Secretary of State Marshall and Un
dersecretary Lovett.
Already prepared is a plan to line
up political, economic and intelli
gence operations according to majot
world regions and put each division
under an assistant secretary ol
state.
Mr. Truman may also consic'ei
some changes in diplomatic person
nel abroad. One replacement whicl"
seems certain will be for Ambassa
dor Walter Bedell Smith at Moscow
Smith originally planned to come
home months ago, now is undcrstoor
to be determined to turn the ardu
ous Soviet assignment over to i
new man.
Outlook in other fields:
Reclamation—Restrictions inipo ec
on construction and personnel bj
80th Congress likely to be modii d
but no new major projects stnri d
Federal power plants and transiv •
sion lines probably will be pnsh 1
especially in Northwest. Comir
sioner Michael Straus likely to st
Alaska—Development pr o g r a ;
likely to get a shot in the arm. F

resume his old post as chairman,
replacing Rep. Thomas (R-N.J.).j
Wood is nothing like the showman ;
♦ hat Thomas is. The committee was
comparatively quiet under his direc
tion in the last Democratic Con- |
gress.
Farmers can expect Mr. Truman
and the new Congress to strengthen
farm commodity price supports.
It apparently was weakness in the
present program, enacted by the Re
publican Congress, that put many
normally Republican farm belt
states in the Truman column.
The Truman victory does not
mean higher farm prices. It prob
ably means greater effort to pre
farm price collapse than could have 1
been made under present laws and
conditions.
Insiders expect a house-cleaning j
in the State Department which will i
go far beyond the resignations of

Secretary of State Marshall and Un
dersecretary Lovett.
Already prepared is a plan to line
up political, economic and intelli
gence operations according to majot
world regions and put each division
under an assistant secretary ol
state.
Mr. Truman may also consic'ei
some changes in diplomatic person
nel abroad. One replacement whicl"
seems certain will be for Ambassa
dor Walter Bedell Smith at Moscow
Smith originally planned to come
home months ago, now is undcrstoor
to be determined to turn the ardu
ous Soviet assignment over to i
new man.
Outlook in other fields:
Reclamation—Restrictions inipo ec
on construction and personnel bj
80th Congress likely to be modii d
but no new major projects stnri d
Federal power plants and transiv •
sion lines probably will be pnsh 1
especially in Northwest. Comir
sioner Michael Straus likely to st
Alaska—Development pr o g r a ;
likely to get a shot in the arm. F
