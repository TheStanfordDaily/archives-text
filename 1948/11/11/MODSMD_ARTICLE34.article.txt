departmental mail since 193], died
n his sleep Tuesday night at his
home at Interdale, on Portola Road, j

people saw sorting mail in his cagc i
under the clock in the Administra

daily rounds by Lilly, the bulldog
with the shoulders of a fullback and
disposition of a saint.

"Ross is everybody's friend, and
'.t seems to work both ways," said
an article in the '46 Alumni Review.
"He is a confidant and friend of
Univeisity officialdom and prole

17 years ago.
On campus he was known as the
"secretary's friend" for his kindness |
in doing errands and circulating the j
inter-departmental news.
