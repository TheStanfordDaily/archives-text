# Volunteers Work At Farm Museum
## 
### 
After being closed the past three
1 years, the Stanford Museum is still
undergoing an extensive inventory,
| reorganization, and recataloging of
i its 30,000 objects. Delay of work on
this project was due to complete lack
of funds, and consequently the need
for volunteer workers. Students,
i working under instructors and expc
| rienced men, have undertaken this
project.
1 iie Egyptian and Oriental collec
j tions are now finished, and work on
j the anthropology department is well
under way.
Until recently, the museum was a
i complicated jumble of materia! and
j exhibits with no particular system of
organization. The new system will
parallel the organization of the
j Smithsonian Institute.
Although the museum is not open
; to the public, classes may see those
j exhibits which are finished if staff
permission is granted.
