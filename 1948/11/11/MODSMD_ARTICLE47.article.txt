# Gridders Drill on Offense
## 
### 
With Emery Mitchell definitely
out for the season, Marchie
Schwartz has been searching des
perately this week tor a new man
>o build his attack around in time
tor the Montana game Saturday.
Schwartz juggled his remaining
backfieid manpower two nights ago
to add Don Campbell and Bill Dc
i'oung to the weakened fullback
ranks. They will divide time with
'Marty Anderson.
Don Campbell, a made - over
quarterback, again shouldered most
of the responsibility in last night's
Practice session. Campbell will
Jeam up with Aubrey Devine, Bob
White, and A 1 Turriziani to form

the starting backfield to be used
against the invading Montana
Grizzlies.
Rock Campbell could prove to be
; the shot in the arm that the Red
j shirts lacked against Army after
I Mitchell had left the game. Rock
can pass the ball deep, and although
he has never run before, he has the
power that it takes to move through
; the line.
Bill De Young has also been
looking right at home in Mitchell's
spot. De Young, a fancy stepping
speedster, has uncovered a good
pitching arm, and might work into
1 the new system with little trouble.
Encouraging word from trainer
J Connie Jarvis was that several of
; the doubtfuls for Saturday have
| snapped back into shape and will
be able to go.
Atherton Phleger, out of action
; since the USC game, will be ready
for Montana. A! Rau, not as seri
ously injured as at first supposed,
will also be ready.
Others returning to action this
week are defensive halfback Dave
Field and guard Bobby Rohrer.
Both have been bothered by hip
! pointers.
; Only Stanford men definitely out
of the contest are Mitchell, an
other fullback, Bud Klein, and
euard Don Lucas.
