# Weiershauser Greets Host of Talent; Stanford Cinder Outlook Promising
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Though the roars from nearby
Stanford Stadium signify it is still
football season, over 30 varsity as
pirants are already pounding the
track at Stanford's Angeil Field.
Fourteen varsity lettermen in ad
dition to several stars up from last
year's Frosh squad greeted Coach
Jack Weiershauser on the opening
day of the all-important fall track.
The Cards are fortunate to have a
letterman returning in every event,
and the Indian squad promises to
be much stronger this year. Many
of the marks already recorded this
year far surpass last year's fall
track efforts.
Otis Chandler, ace Card shot put
ter, has fhown promises of equal r
ing or ev n betting his 53 ft. 7V:j
inches best of last year. He has al
ready thrown 52 ft. G in. in prac
tice this fall, and seems to be im
proving every day.
Held Paces Spear Tosscrs
Back pacing the javelin crew is
veteran Bud Held, national cham
pion last year, with a heave of 210
feet. Held won the 1947 J. Rice
Award for his efforts, and is ex
pected to lead the field again this
year. He is credited with several
tosses over 210 feet already this fall.
Held will also pole vault.
In the opinion of Coach Weiers

hauser, two other men, Larry Hoff
and Gay Bryan will place high in
national cinder standings. Hoff, who
is credited with a 47.8 quarter mile,
is probably the best 440 man on the
Coast. He won all of his confer

ence races last year, and is expected
to repeat.
Bryan Returns
Bryan, who is national hop, step,
and jump champion, is counted on
lor heavy duties this year. He per
sonally scored 14 points against the
powerful USC Trojans last year. His
best records include a 6 foot 4 inch
high jump, a 24 foot 5 inch broad
jump, and a 23.3-second low hur
dles.
The hurdles will again be Stan
ford's strongest event. With Down
ing McKee, Darrell Kreitz, Dell
Russell, and Skip Kent back, the
Indians could easily sweep the highs.
The same holds true for the Bryan
brothers in the low hurdles.
Coach Weiershauser expects a
great improvement in the middle
and long distances this year. Back
ing up Hoff in the quarter mile are
Pitch Johnson, Cass Bly, and Larry
Mclnery. In the 880 veteran A 1
Holubar will receive stiff competi
tion from speedy sophs Drew Terra
morse and Lorry Gordon, both of
whom were under two minutes last
year. A 1 Lyons, Jose Rael, and John
Figg-Hoblyn, last year's long dis
tance men, are joined by stalwart
George Mooers, captain of the '48
frosh team.
Sprints Weak
The sprints still appear to be the-
Indians' weakest events, with Bud
Richter the only returning letter
man. However, Bob Wood and Ron
nie Buck both hope to break 10 sec
onds this year.
Soph Merritt Van Sant. who has a
jump of 23 feet 3 inches to his
credit, will back up Bryan in the
broad jump. Dave Dunlap, a trans
fer from Menlo JC, will high jump
this year for the Indians. His for
mer teammate, George Van Heusen.
also from Menlo, will strengthen
the pole vault corps.
As for the weights, veteran Steve
MeKee will again combine with
Chandler to make the Cards strong
in the department. Norm Nourse
and Dick Scott complete a well
rounded roster.
