# In the Court of the Beloved Oak
## 
### 
I was silting under the oak
in the Clothes Closet patio yes
terday with my SIRO pledge in
hand — there go my conceit
tickets —just contemplating. I
remembered the plight of the
students I saw last year in Eu
rope, and, believe me, aiding
them is the most worthwhile
cause I can think of, so let's
give.
In usual Stanford style, the
serious business will be
touched off with a gay affair—
the "Frontier Frolic" dance.
Knowing that you couldn't
have put your $1.80 to more
noble work, how can you help
but have fun? Bob Emerson's
band will give out with slow,
dreamy dance music sprinkled
with those novelty numbers he
does so well. Don't miss this
dance.
Remember to come and visit
me at the Clothes Closet, 520
Ratnona just off University. I'll
show you the latest fashions in
the finest quality at the best
price you can find.
