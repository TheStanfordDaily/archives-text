# Law Students to Debate Provision of T-H Law
## 
### 
Four Stanford Law School final
' ist contestants will debate the eon
! stitutionality of the anti-Commu
nist provision of the Taft-Hartley
' Labor Law before a moot court
' next Wednesday evening. The four
I finalists will argue the question at
the same time the United States
Supreme Court has agreed to rule
. on the constitutionality of the act.
This provision provides in sub
stance that unless the officers of a
; union take an oath tljat they are
not Communists, the union will be
l denied the benefit of the act. This
! is of particular interest to Bay Area
! residents because Harry Bridges and
! oflicers of the San Francisco Mari
time Workers' Union refused to sign
I the oath prescribed by the act.
The moot court will sit at Cub-
I berley Auditorium at 8:15 p.m. The
; winning student will be awarded
i $100; second prize is $50; and the
; third and fourth prizes are $25
I apiece.
The public is invited to attend
| the meeting.
