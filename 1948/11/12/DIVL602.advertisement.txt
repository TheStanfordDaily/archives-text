DIG THIS DEPARTMENT
A cat who was Hep to the jive
Took his gal to dinner at five.
To LCMCBARN, of course;
She was no horse,
And she had to eat to survive.
"Solid," she said, meaning the
place,
"Reet," he said, meaning her face.
So, 'tis solid and reet,
Impossible to beat.
Where? LONCBARN —to be sure.
—H. F. BARRY
Consider it dug.

Patio Dancing to live music
Friday and Saturday nights—
even it it rains. If you're from
Missouri, come and see how.
