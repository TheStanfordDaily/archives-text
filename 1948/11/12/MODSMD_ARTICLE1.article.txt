### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's battle-worn gridders go back to the shelter of the
Pacific Coast Conference tomorrow when the varsity squares off
against the hapless Montana Grizzlies at 2 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
Rated 36-point favorites over the Silvertipped invaders, Stan

ford's unpi-edictable football men
will be out to pick up their third
confernece win. Montana will be
trying for its first conference touch
down.
About 15,000 fans are expected to
turn out to watch the Grizzlies at
tempt the impossible. Unable to
show any consistent attack this sea
son, the Montana men will use
both a single-wing and T-forma
tion tomorrow, but Stanford figures
to stop them cold.
Marchie Schwartz will start his
best team available which means
that tomorow's starters will prob
ably be the same team that will
tackle California in the Big Game.

Other changes in the starting line

center, and Martin Anderson at full
back.

at the beginning of the week, is ex

Field Stili Out
Dave Field, slow to recover from
a painful hip-pointer, will be held
out of the Montana game in hopes
thai the rest will enable him to
regain top form by Big Game time.
Field's alert defensive play has been
sorely missed for the last two weeks
On the whole, the squad has
bounded back into pretty good shape
this week. A 1 Laakso and Ken Rose
will be ready to go again at the
ends. Gordon White will team up
with Captain Phleger at the tackles.
Bob Rohrer and Don Fix will han

Aubrey Devine will continue to
open at quarter, although sopho
more Tom Shaw will get in there
quite a bit tomorrow. Bob White
and Boyd Benson will start at the
halfback slots, and Martin Ander
son starts at full.
Durket Runs Well
Last night's practice session was
featured around setting up a de
fense for the Montana boys. Spark
ing the drills were Athcrton Phle
ger and Don Campbell on defense,
while Mike Durket and Bob Ander
son looked pretty fancy in running
the Montana formations.
Tomorrow's meeting between
Stanford and Montana will be the
fourth in the history of the two
schools. Stanford has trampled the
Grizzlies in their three previous
meetings, the most recent effort be
ing a 32 to 0 job, turned in during
the 1935 campaign.
Montana Lacks Stuff
From all viewpoints, the Montana
men are just not up to par. But
they do have a good time throwing
the ball around. Last season, this
same team managed to upset a bet
ter Washington State club, and also
came through to take Idaho.
But all their luck has been bad
so far this year. They figure that if
it is going to change, Stanford is
the likely choice. Ross Miller, Griz
ly press-agent, says that his men
will be in better shape tomorrow
than at any time this season.

Dave Field, slow to recover from
a painful hip-pointer, will be held
out of the Montana game in hopes

Field's alert defensive play has been
sorely missed for the last two weeks
On the whole, the squad has
bounded back into pretty good shape
this week. A 1 Laakso and Ken Rose

with Captain Phleger at the tackles.
Bob Rohrer and Don Fix will han

Aubrey Devine will continue to
open at quarter, although sopho
more Tom Shaw will get in there

halfback slots, and Martin Ander

Durket Runs Well
Last night's practice session was
featured around setting up a de
fense for the Montana boys. Spark
ing the drills were Athcrton Phle
ger and Don Campbell on defense,
while Mike Durket and Bob Ander
son looked pretty fancy in running
the Montana formations.
Tomorrow's meeting between
Stanford and Montana will be the
fourth in the history of the two
schools. Stanford has trampled the
Grizzlies in their three previous
meetings, the most recent effort be
ing a 32 to 0 job, turned in during
the 1935 campaign.
Montana Lacks Stuff
From all viewpoints, the Montana
men are just not up to par. But
they do have a good time throwing
the ball around. Last season, this
same team managed to upset a bet
ter Washington State club, and also
came through to take Idaho.
But all their luck has been bad
so far this year. They figure that if
it is going to change, Stanford is
the likely choice. Ross Miller, Griz
ly press-agent, says that his men
will be in better shape tomorrow
than at any time this season.

than at any time this season.

Stanford's battle-worn gridders go back to the shelter of the
Pacific Coast Conference tomorrow when the varsity squares off
against the hapless Montana Grizzlies at 2 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
Rated 36-point favorites over the Silvertipped invaders, Stan

ford's unpi-edictable football men
will be out to pick up their third
confernece win. Montana will be
trying for its first conference touch
down.
About 15,000 fans are expected to
turn out to watch the Grizzlies at
tempt the impossible. Unable to
show any consistent attack this sea
son, the Montana men will use
both a single-wing and T-forma
tion tomorrow, but Stanford figures
to stop them cold.
Marchie Schwartz will start his

that tomorow's starters will prob

Other changes in the starting line

Field Stili Out
Dave Field, slow to recover from
a painful hip-pointer, will be held
out of the Montana game in hopes

regain top form by Big Game time.
Field's alert defensive play has been
sorely missed for the last two weeks
On the whole, the squad has
bounded back into pretty good shape
this week. A 1 Laakso and Ken Rose
will be ready to go again at the
ends. Gordon White will team up
with Captain Phleger at the tackles.
Bob Rohrer and Don Fix will han

Aubrey Devine will continue to
open at quarter, although sopho
more Tom Shaw will get in there
quite a bit tomorrow. Bob White
and Boyd Benson will start at the
halfback slots, and Martin Ander
son starts at full.
Durket Runs Well
Last night's practice session was
featured around setting up a de
fense for the Montana boys. Spark
ing the drills were Athcrton Phle
ger and Don Campbell on defense,
while Mike Durket and Bob Ander
son looked pretty fancy in running
the Montana formations.
Tomorrow's meeting between
Stanford and Montana will be the
fourth in the history of the two
schools. Stanford has trampled the
Grizzlies in their three previous
meetings, the most recent effort be
ing a 32 to 0 job, turned in during
the 1935 campaign.
Montana Lacks Stuff
From all viewpoints, the Montana
men are just not up to par. But
they do have a good time throwing
the ball around. Last season, this
same team managed to upset a bet
ter Washington State club, and also
came through to take Idaho.
But all their luck has been bad
so far this year. They figure that if
it is going to change, Stanford is
the likely choice. Ross Miller, Griz
ly press-agent, says that his men
will be in better shape tomorrow
than at any time this season.
