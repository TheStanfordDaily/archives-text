# UN May Shift Berlin Problem To Vetoless General Assembly
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 11 (/P)â€”United Na
tions officials were reported work
ing urgently tonight on a new effort
to break the Berlin deadlock. The
plan may involve shifting the case
from the Security Council to the
58-nation General Assembly.
Any decision by the assembly
would be tree from a Big Power
veto. The assembly, however, has
no power other than aroused world
opinion to back up its decisions.
UN officials moved for a new try
on the Berlin case before Russia's
announcement yesterday that
American and British lift planes
would be forced down if thev

strayed outside their assigned cor
ridors or were found without na
tion identifications.
The Russian announcement was
said, however, to have speeded ef
forts here to get a settlement.
Russia once again charged the
United States and Britain had
wrecked attempts here to end the
Berlin deadlock. Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishin
sky also blamed the United States
and Britain for what he called the
"fiasco" of the UN Atomic Energy
Commission.
