# Reds May Force Chiang to Resign

PEIPING, • Nov. 11 (/P) —The vic
torious Chinese Communist armies
o! Manchuria are preparing for
fresh offensive operations even as
their comrades far to the south
lunge toward Nanking.
In the ordinary course of events,
it should lake at least several weeks
for the Manchurian Reds to mount
a new offensive.
But it is possible the Communists
will strike sooner to take advan
tage of such favorable factors as
low morale and shortage of weap
ons among government forces in
North China.
Recurrent reports say the Com
munists already have massed about
40.000 troops in an area north of
Tangshan.
Though Chiang Kai-Shek has
vowed a fight to the death with the
Communists, even if it takes eight
years, there still is a strong impres
sion in North China that events may
force a political settlement.
The idea is that Chiang's generals
might not have the same determina
tion to keep on fighting as he.and
if their position becomes much more
critical he will have no other re
course but to resign.
