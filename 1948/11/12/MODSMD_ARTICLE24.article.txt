# Construction Lagging On Big Game Bonfire
## 
### 
This year's Big Game bonfire
construction is lagging far behind
schedule, according to Mick Hefter,
chairman of the Frosh Bonfire
Committee.
"The freshmen, as a class, tradi
tionally play the biggest part in the

Big Game festivities, and two of tlu
most important phases of the activ
ities — building the bonfire and
guarding the campus — are carrier
out by the frosh alone," Hefter said
'"We still lack enough wood ft
a good bonfire, and time is runrir
short. Unless more men turn out
to collect the wood, this year's fii
will not compare with the one built
by the Class of '51."

Trucks leave Encina daily t<
gather wood from Peninsula lum
ber yards, packing houses, and dai
ries, Hefter said. Thus far there
have not been enough frosh men
to secure the maximum benefit
from the trucks.
The wood is being stacked in twc
places, part of it in Lake Lagunita.
and part of it at an undisclosed
storage point. Actual construction
of the fire has not yet begun, but
plans have been laid out for the
digging of the draft trenches.
Ground has been broken around
the site of the fire to provide a fire
break. The freshmen have secured
several telephone poles about 40
feet long to be used as braces for
the bonfire.
Construction of the fire will bo
gin at dawn Wednesday and wili
continue through the day and night
until the job is completed Thurs
day. Coffee will be served by
freshman women.
Guarding Begins Tonight
Guarding of the campus has not
yet begun, according to Claude Ro
senberg, who is in charge of the
project. Tonight the first group of
frosh will be stationed at strategic
points on campus to thwart any
further attempts at property dam
age on the part of Cal students. The
guard will be on duty every night
between now and the Big Game.
Jack White, newly elected presi
dent of the Class of '52, urges the
frosh to do their part in the Big
Game activities. "Our duties dur
ing Big Game Week are important
to all of us," he said. "Let s not
forget them in any way. Every
freshman is expected to do his part
Let's move the Class of '52 to the
front with a bonfire and a campus
defense that will never be sur
passed."

places, part of it in Lake Lagunita.
and part of it at an undisclosed
storage point. Actual construction
of the fire has not yet begun, but
plans have been laid out for the
digging of the draft trenches.
Ground has been broken around
the site of the fire to provide a fire
break. The freshmen have secured
several telephone poles about 40
feet long to be used as braces for
the bonfire.
Construction of the fire will bo
gin at dawn Wednesday and wili
continue through the day and night
until the job is completed Thurs
day. Coffee will be served by
freshman women.
Guarding Begins Tonight
Guarding of the campus has not
yet begun, according to Claude Ro
senberg, who is in charge of the
project. Tonight the first group of
frosh will be stationed at strategic
points on campus to thwart any
further attempts at property dam
age on the part of Cal students. The
guard will be on duty every night
between now and the Big Game.
Jack White, newly elected presi
dent of the Class of '52, urges the
frosh to do their part in the Big
Game activities. "Our duties dur
ing Big Game Week are important
to all of us," he said. "Let s not
forget them in any way. Every
freshman is expected to do his part
Let's move the Class of '52 to the
front with a bonfire and a campus
defense that will never be sur
passed."
This year's Big Game bonfire
construction is lagging far behind
schedule, according to Mick Hefter,
chairman of the Frosh Bonfire
Committee.
"The freshmen, as a class, tradi
tionally play the biggest part in the

Big Game festivities, and two of tlu
most important phases of the activ
ities — building the bonfire and
guarding the campus — are carrier
out by the frosh alone," Hefter said
'"We still lack enough wood ft
a good bonfire, and time is runrir
short. Unless more men turn out
to collect the wood, this year's fii
will not compare with the one built
by the Class of '51."
Daily Wood Collections
Trucks leave Encina daily t<
gather wood from Peninsula lum
ber yards, packing houses, and dai

have not been enough frosh men
to secure the maximum benefit
from the trucks.
