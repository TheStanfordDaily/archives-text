# Encina Weather Forecast: Heavy Rain Today, Tomorrow
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
Encina's famous formula for wa
terbagging passing cars has finally
been pressed into service. The first
few weeks of the present quarter
found passers-by amazed by the
quietness of the old building with
students hitting the books behind
closed windows instead of bombing
from above at open windows.
It was rumored that '52 didn't
have it when it came to spirit. Up
per classmen, remembering their
rirst years, shook their heads. Where
was the Class of 52's spirit? They
were amazed at the dry streets, un
cluttered with paper.
Santa Clara Aftermath
This serenity broke, however, after
the Santa Clara football game. A
few progressives blasted a long line
of cars which were parading home
from the game. The whole hall and
some bystanders broke into loud
cheers. Convertibles proved espe
cially delectable targets and were
washed down the street in a never
ending stream of water and paper.
Dripping hair and soggy coats were
the order of the day.
The climax came after the Wash
ington game. On this occasion one
freshman rented a car, tied a bulls
eye target to the top, and drove up
and down the east side of Encina.
Meanwhile, a loudspeaker on the
fifth floor blared encouragement and
excitedly announced the approach
of the "targetmobile" each time it
came into range. The driver had
even supplied every room with
waterbags in order to increase the
volume of water splashing from the
Frosh fortress. The next day the
poor Pontiac almost floated away
from the Encina Courtyard.
Nothing But Water
Now, no one dares to walk in the
shadow of Encina's walls or he will
soon be swimming away, peeling wet
paper off his head and swearing
dreadful revenge against the chor
tling figures above.
The sponsors arc gaunt specta
tors who seem to lack an aquatic
sense of humor. They spend their
time questioning apple-cheeked boys
who swear that the water on their
window-sills was from last week's
rain 01 that they were just washing
out the wastebaskets.
The Con Home, however, is re
ported to be secretly condoning the
situation, as it receives help from
all freshmen caught wetting down
the Encina byways.

It was rumored that '52 didn't
have it when it came to spirit. Up
per classmen, remembering their
rirst years, shook their heads. Where
was the Class of 52's spirit? They
were amazed at the dry streets, un
cluttered with paper.
Santa Clara Aftermath
This serenity broke, however, after
the Santa Clara football game. A
few progressives blasted a long line
of cars which were parading home
from the game. The whole hall and
some bystanders broke into loud
cheers. Convertibles proved espe
cially delectable targets and were
washed down the street in a never
ending stream of water and paper.
Dripping hair and soggy coats were
the order of the day.
The climax came after the Wash
ington game. On this occasion one
freshman rented a car, tied a bulls
eye target to the top, and drove up
and down the east side of Encina.
Meanwhile, a loudspeaker on the
fifth floor blared encouragement and
excitedly announced the approach
of the "targetmobile" each time it
came into range. The driver had
even supplied every room with
waterbags in order to increase the
volume of water splashing from the
Frosh fortress. The next day the
poor Pontiac almost floated away
from the Encina Courtyard.
Nothing But Water
Now, no one dares to walk in the
shadow of Encina's walls or he will
soon be swimming away, peeling wet
paper off his head and swearing
dreadful revenge against the chor
tling figures above.
The sponsors arc gaunt specta
tors who seem to lack an aquatic
sense of humor. They spend their
time questioning apple-cheeked boys
who swear that the water on their
window-sills was from last week's
rain 01 that they were just washing
out the wastebaskets.
The Con Home, however, is re
ported to be secretly condoning the
situation, as it receives help from
all freshmen caught wetting down
the Encina byways.
Encina's famous formula for wa
terbagging passing cars has finally
been pressed into service. The first
few weeks of the present quarter
found passers-by amazed by the
quietness of the old building with
students hitting the books behind
closed windows instead of bombing
from above at open windows.
