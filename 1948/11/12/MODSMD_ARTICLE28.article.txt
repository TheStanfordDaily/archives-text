## 
### 
A diamond necklace is the glit
tering pendant that everyone (in
cluding a Scotland Yard detective)
is trying to steal in '"Raffles," the
feature at the Sunday Evening
Movies this week.
David Niven takes the part of the
daring Raff.es, a robinhoodish am
ateur thief, while Olivia de Havil
land supplies the feminine charm
as a lovely society girl. Dudley
Diggs provides the humor as a le
tective who tracks Raffles over
England.
The next exciting chapter of the
dynamic Western serial, ''Riders of
Death Valley," will keep Farm stu
dents tense with excitement.
