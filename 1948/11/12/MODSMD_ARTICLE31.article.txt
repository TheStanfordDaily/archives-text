3. White shirts and sweaters for

"In addition, feathers will be dis

j megaphones to the men," said I lap
Black and Lynn Cox, co-chairmen
of the Rally Committee.
This year, as always, "'we want
to have a perfect rooting section,"
they said.
(Rooters' caps may be purchased

"The keynote to the Big Game,"

! and perfection. Some of the stunts
j will be co-ordinated with the Stan
i ford Band's half-time activities."
