### BARBARA METZGER 
This is the story of the people in
a poverty-stricken little village in
I Austria and of the Stanford women
: who brought them happiness and
! comfort.
A gir! in Lagunita heard, through
1 a letter from her parents in Eng
j land, of a bishop who had made his
; way to England to plead for aid for
I his people.
The matter was laken up before
Lagunita Excom where the girls,
decided to send CARE boxes and
1 clothing to the village of St. Jo
hann-im-Pongau. In the village
was a nun. Sister Lore Dutz. who
supervised the distribution of the
j boxes. Last summer she heard,
through one of the Lagunita cor
respondents. of the International
A-Fair planned for the first of this
| quarter.
Immediately Sister Lore Dutz be
! gan to prepare a box filled with
| articles contributed by the villa-
I gers. Unfortunately the box didn't
I arrive in time for the A-Fair auc
i tion. the proceeds of which were
! turned over to foreign relief. Many
j of the villagers' articles were ob
| jects of great sentimental value,
parted with only because the con-
I tributors felt that in some way their
I prized possessions might help peo
j pie who were suffering as they had
| been suffering.
The willingness of these people
| to give as well as receive demon
! strated to Ihe girls at Stanford how
, real friendships can be built be
j tween peoples of different nations.

When the Stanford Relief Fund
Drive began this week, the gifts
were put on display in the Book
store in the hope that all Stanford
could see what it means to give till
it hurts.
