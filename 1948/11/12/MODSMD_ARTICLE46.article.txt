# UNESCO Supplies Student Planes
## 
### 
Student planes, not ships, have
become a reality for students who
want to go to Europe next summer.
Stanford's Council for UNESCO has
been invited to participate in a
project being sponsored by Ameri
can Youth Hostels.
This means that Stanford students
may fly from New York to Europe
(London, Paris, Rotterdam) for
$170. only $12 more than the stu
dent ships last summer.
The planes, chartered through
Transocean Airlines, fly daily from
June 15 to July 15 eastbound and
from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 for the
return trip.
To secure Stanford's quota of 70
passenger places, the lIR must
make an immediate down payment
of $10 per passage. These deposits
will be taken at the ASSU office
until noon next Wednesday, Nov.
17. The door is open to all Stanford
students and junior members of
the faculty and administration on a
priority basis of first come, first
served.
As no other student travel possi
bilities can be guaranteed for next
summer, lIR urges all interested
students to take advantage of this
bargain immediately. If the quota
is not fully subscribed on campus,
wives and friends from other West
Coast schools will be accepted.
