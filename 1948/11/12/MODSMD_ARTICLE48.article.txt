## Pollsters Have Problem 
### 
National elections are over, but the reconstruction task that
lies ahead for the nat : on's public opinion pollsters as a result
of the election is just beginning. Not since 1936 has any major
survey been so rudely upset by the voters.
Although the prestige of American polling methods tumbled
from its height of prestige Nov. 2, we believe that the survey
mistakes will be a healthy lesson for the entire polling system.
Look back at the pre-election poll reports, and you will observe
several basic polling technigue mistakes.
The first of these basic mistakes in polling methods was made
by Mr. Roper in early September when he announced that the
election was in the bag for Mr. Dewey, and that his polling
agency would no longer observe public opinion on the election
issue. Here was a case where an individual mixed scientific
sampling with personal opinions.
An additional survey error—in the sampling method itself—
was made by Mr. Gallup and Company. Gallup's stratified
sampling methods are "stuffed" with too many interviews among
the better educated, higher income classes—and these classes
are predominantly Republican. Such an error is an involuntary
one on Gallup's part, and, as such, he had no insight to the
problem. Therefore, his reports have usually erred two or three
per cent more than the optimum.
Several other factors were not taken into consideration by
public opinion experts as pre-election polls were compiled. The
Republican over-confidence in party victory may have left the
field open for a majority of Democratic votes when too few Re
publicans took the time to vote. Mr. Truman's solitary effort to
win the campaign seemed like a futile effort when compared with
Thomas E. Dewey's overwhelming party, press, and supposed
public support.
Early observations on voting distribution indicate that much
of the rural vote went Democratic because farmers believed a
Democratic Congress and administration would uphold high farm
prices. Some pollsters surveyed suburban areas and labeled
such districts as representative of the rural vote.
Since early survey results pointed to a Republican victory on
both the local and national battlefronts, pollsters spent little
money to take adeguate samplings (a mere 2,500 instead of a
more reliable 30,000 interviews) of public opinion. Such action
can be just as disastrous as making a sampling too large.
Only several of the President's cabinet members took to the
field to campaign for Mr. Truman. One of these men was the
Secretary of Agriculture. His barnstorming speeches through
out the Midwestern farm belt hit the election jackpot after he
promised support of high farm prices.
Even the President, in his cross-country electioneering, helped
his own cause. Americans respect an underdog, and Mr. Tru
man filled the part. His arguments that he was handicapped
by the second-worst Congress in American history had noticeable
effect. Evidently the voters decided to do something about the
claims of a bad Congress, and Mr. Truman was handed Demo
cratic majorities in the Senate and House.
The 1948 pre-election poll results, then, were faulty in their
sampling, in their interpretation, and in their correction of human
error. Final survey results of nationwide polls were based on
small samplings taken before the voters had definitely made up
their minds.
The holiday is over, and the big-name pollsters' bubble has
burst. Opinion surveys are not dependable unless conducted
on a scientific basis right down to the last report. Pollsters, on
the other hand, must realize more than ever that people will not
join the bandwagon for the "winning team" just because every
one else seems to be doing the same.
We are relieved that the polls were upset in this election. Pub
lic opinion survey methods are still young in age and potential
accuracy; the great mistakes of 1948 will be corrected and the
organizations will be healthier and the wiser for it. Opinion
surveys have become too important an influence in politics and
business to wither away after one major miscalculation. It is
important to the public that the survey business extend its re
search in order to provide the nation with more reliable coverage
on American opinion.
