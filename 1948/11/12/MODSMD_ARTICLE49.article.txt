Long Lines to Buy Tickets
To the Editor:
My first acquaintance with Stanford lines came on registration day.
Subsequently, 1 became accustomed to seemingly interminable waits while
petting rooters' tickets, Big Game tickets, and Gaieties tickets.
Long registration lines are excusable perhaps; however, lines for
tickets seem needlessly lonq and slow-moving. A few more people selling
tickets would greatly facilitate the movement of those lines and would
therefore prevent the formation of ill will among those people who wish
to buy tickets and who have to attend a class. It seems to me that it
would be comparatively easy to make ticket sales more speedy for the
c« nvenience of all pcisons concerned.
