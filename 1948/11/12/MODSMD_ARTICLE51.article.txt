### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
I'm easy to get along with.
I love to watch: Two gigolos try
ing to outfumble each other . . .
A smooth operator at work . . .
Well-tanned legs . . . The gyrations
of good jitterbugs . . . The self
satisfied look of a girl who is sure
the men are watching her take off
her coat . . . Anything. (I'm easy
to get along with.)
But I hate to see: Morning . . .
First-of-the-month bills . . . Big
red "F's" on exams . . . Exams . . .
The bottom of the bottle . . . Wom
en driving convertibles (gives me
an inferiority complex) . . . Leap
year leaving . . . Dear John letters.
I take off my hat to: Any blonde
in a Cadillac convertiWe . . . Any
blonde . . . Any Cadillac conver
tible . . . Hang it on the rack by the
bar stool.
I can sympathize with: A guy
with an expensive taste in women
. . . Dewey . . . Gallup ... A guy
with too many brews ... A pho
tographer working for a portrait
smile ... A classmate's struggle
between sleep and politeness . . .
Everyone (I'm easy to get along
with).
I get a kick out of: My girl when
I have gone far enough . . . The
quick blush as a girl is told of the
peeking petticoat . . . Turning off
the alarm and going back to sleep
. . . A guy on the phone making
excuses 'ike mad for his buddy who
is out with another girl on the sly
. . . Anything (I'm easy to get along
with).
Three cheers for: Parents who
send checks in letters . . . Profs
who don't believe in tests . . . The
girl who wipes her lipstick off first
. . . The date mart of the Village
coeducational chow lines . . . Any
thing (I'm easy to get along with).
I'd like to forget: A real buddy
introducing me to his girl friend's
definitely desirable girl friend —
only to find she is married with an
eight-month-old baby . . . Trying
to impress a girl on a brew date—
with four fraternity brothers sitting
in the next booth kibitzing . . .
These 8 a.m. classes where you get
up looking just like your service
ID card picture ... A monotoned
sports announcer I know . . . My
first pipe . . .
But what the hell. Bring us all
some juice, bartender. I'd just like
to forget.

with too many brews ... A pho
tographer working for a portrait
smile ... A classmate's struggle
between sleep and politeness . . .
Everyone (I'm easy to get along
with).
I get a kick out of: My girl when
I have gone far enough . . . The
quick blush as a girl is told of the
peeking petticoat . . . Turning off
the alarm and going back to sleep
. . . A guy on the phone making
excuses 'ike mad for his buddy who
is out with another girl on the sly
. . . Anything (I'm easy to get along
with).
Three cheers for: Parents who
send checks in letters . . . Profs
who don't believe in tests . . . The
girl who wipes her lipstick off first
. . . The date mart of the Village
coeducational chow lines . . . Any
thing (I'm easy to get along with).
I'd like to forget: A real buddy
introducing me to his girl friend's
definitely desirable girl friend —
only to find she is married with an
eight-month-old baby . . . Trying
to impress a girl on a brew date—
with four fraternity brothers sitting
in the next booth kibitzing . . .
These 8 a.m. classes where you get
up looking just like your service
ID card picture ... A monotoned
sports announcer I know . . . My
first pipe . . .
But what the hell. Bring us all
some juice, bartender. I'd just like
to forget.
I'm easy to get along with.
I love to watch: Two gigolos try
ing to outfumble each other . . .
A smooth operator at work . . .
Well-tanned legs . . . The gyrations
of good jitterbugs . . . The self
satisfied look of a girl who is sure
the men are watching her take off
her coat . . . Anything. (I'm easy
to get along with.)
But I hate to see: Morning . . .
First-of-the-month bills . . . Big
red "F's" on exams . . . Exams . . .
The bottom of the bottle . . . Wom
en driving convertibles (gives me
an inferiority complex) . . . Leap
year leaving . . . Dear John letters.
I take off my hat to: Any blonde
in a Cadillac convertiWe . . . Any
blonde . . . Any Cadillac conver
tible . . . Hang it on the rack by the
bar stool.
I can sympathize with: A guy
with an expensive taste in women
. . . Dewey . . . Gallup ... A guy
with too many brews ... A pho
tographer working for a portrait
smile ... A classmate's struggle
between sleep and politeness . . .
