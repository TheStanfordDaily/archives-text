## How "Chicken" Is Cal? 
### 
Just how "chicken" can Cal get-
Last time we read their paper they were yammering that the
big "C" was a legitimate target and that no one would be turned
in for going after it.
Today it is announced in the Call-Bulletin that four Stanford
raiders were caught on the route to the "C." They were picked
up by policemenâ€”and the Berkeley campus was swarming with
cops (there were eight in the stadium).
Protecting the "C" is the students' job, juft as the patrol at
Stanford is in charge of the freshmen. To egg on attacks with
the cry that the "C" is a legitimate target and then to call the
police is the height of double-dealing.
And at the police station the four roughs were chided and
reminded of the agreement between the two schools' student
bodies not to stage any pranks involving damage to property.
Well, look who's talking. (Do we need mention the constant
painting of public structures on the Stanford campus the past
month, notably the Hoover Tower?)
Men's Council won't act on the case until next week. When
they do, we strongly recommend clemency in view of the at
tending circumstances.
