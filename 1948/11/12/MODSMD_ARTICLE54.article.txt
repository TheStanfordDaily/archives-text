YOUR STANFORD AND MINE ....
The Big Game rally with dramatic appeal to rival a Hitchcock movie
. . . . The girls bless 'em, that we call pigs in print and then stare at on
the Quad .... The monstrous appetites at Encina where even the hot
cakes go like hotcakes .... The eager rush to the post office, and the

light or heavy returning step, all decided by the pres
ence or absence of "(hat'' letter .... The promises
to parents that "this quarter I'm going to live within
my allowance," and Phen the urgent letter to goocl
old Dad to "send five" for the Big Game date . . . .
The Roble lobby, with its quiet, yet friendly, sur
roundings .... Or the Encina lobby with a water
bag plummeting at you with bombsight* precision
.... the skimping on oil for your car or new heels
for your "shoes so you can afford to tip the waiter
at that hotel in the City like a true "Stanford Man'
.... The initials carved in the walls at Dinah's and

Belt's but no room for you to put yours .... the Cactus Gardens that
you joke about but have probably never been near .... that book you
should read in the Reserve Book Room but never do until the night
before the test.
The fabulous stories about Doodles Weaver, most of which you'd like
to believe, but just can't .... the great football teams of yesterday, the
Vow Boys and Wow Boys, and the hope you carry that perhaps this year's
freshman team will next year prove to be the "Now Boys" .... The
chilly autumn mornings that are as cold as a professor's stare .... the
jokes in the Chappie that you insist are completely revolting as you
hurry to turn the pace so you can read the next ones .... The way
many of us poke fun at Rally Com and then marvel at all the work they
do .... The lab experiments you perform so carefully but which never
come out with a result near the correct one .... the amazing traffic
puzzle that the City of Palo Alto has made out of what should have been
a simple underpass at the El Camino Real crossing
Add to this list every other little thing good or tad. that distinguishes
this school from the category of "just another college.'' and you'll have
the net result. It's Stanford. Your Stanford and mine.
