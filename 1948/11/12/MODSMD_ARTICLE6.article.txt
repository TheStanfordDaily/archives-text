## 
### 
The Interfraternity Board of
Control spent Tuesday and Wed
nesday evenings investigating the
presence of freshmen at parties
~iven on the Row by two frater
nities last weekend, according to
Ted LeVino, president. One was an
all - campus open house and the
other a closed dance.
The investigation came about be
cause freshman men are prohibited
from entering fraternities houses
~rior to the formal rushing season
for any reason.
Freshmen attended the a!I-cam
pus party, the Board learned, be
cause posters advertising the dance
were placed on Encina bulletin
1 oards.
Not Intentional
The Interfraternity Board is con
vinced that there was no intention
in the part of the fraternity con
cerned to break the rules,
hut calls the attention of all houses
'o the fact that soliciting freshman
"■ttendince in this manner prior to
t u e formal rushing season is a

breach of the rules. So few fresh
men attended this party that they
were not recognized by fraternity
members in the crowd of some 400.
Approximately 15 members of the
frosh football team attended a
:losed Row party last weekend. The
"roup entered the house, staying
about 15 minutes following a vic
tory celebration of the Cal fresh
man football game, and were evict
ed by the fraternity members. The
frosh were not invited to attend
the party, nor were the rules vio
lated by anyone except the fresh
men who enteied the house.

Interfraternity Board requc
that all freshmen re-read the rush
ing rules to become acquainted
with their contents. Freshmen can
et themselves and a fraternity into
c erious troub'o by entering a Row
house before the winter quarter
rushing season, the Board says.
The new set of rushino rules dis
tributed today is very clear and ex
plicit in every regard. The rules

are a definite improvement on those
published earlier this quarter, al
though they are basically the same.
One change, of interest to fresh
men, is that no man with fewer
than 45 units is eligible for rushing
until the rushing season in winter
quarter.
Row Dances Oft' Limits
Fraternities are advised that all
campus dances given on the How
before the rushing season are still
' off limits" to the frosh, and that
soliciting of attendance by poster
be confined to non-freshman dorms
and bulletin boards.
The IBC warned that fraternity
parties after the Big Game were not
to be attended by lreshmen, nor
were parties thrown by anyone at
which fraternity men are to be
present.
Of course, the spirit of the rule
Prohibiting "social contact" between
fraternity men and freshmen is ex
pected to be lived up to by Row
members and frosh alike under all
circumstances, the Board con
cluded .
