# Kappa Sigs Down Zetes in Murals
## 
### 
A pass from Gordy Grout to Dick
Blair gave the Kappa Sigs a G to 0
victory over the Zetes in an intra
mural football game yesterday. The j
Kappa Sigs scored in the first half
and then spiked all Zete drives in
the second half to earn the win.
Frank Lodato was outstanding j
for the losers. Several times Lo- j
dato outran the secondary, and only i
the inability of the passer to hit
him kept the Zetes from scoring.
Wes Fry and Harry Borchers played
good defensive ball for the Kappa i
Sigs.
In another intramural football !
game yesterday, the Phi Psi II
team took the DU II squad by the
baseball score of 2 to 0. Neither I
team was able to put together a j
consistent drive for a score, and i
the break in the game was a DU |
lateral that went astray for a safety |
and the game-winning two points. !
