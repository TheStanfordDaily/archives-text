# Grizzlies At Full Strength
## 
### 
Montana's Grizzlies invade Stan
ford Stadium tomorrow for % their
third conference game of the sea
son. Thus far the Montanans have
n't fared too well; they lost to the
Washington State Cougars 43 to 0
and little Idaho routed them 39 to
0. So the Grizzlies will be gunning
for their first touchdown in con
ference play tomorrow.
It should be noted however that
Montana has suffered injuries to
key men ever since the first few
weeks of the season, but they will
be almost at full strength for the
game tomorrow.
Montana's big offensive threat is
Captain Jack O'Loughlin, who leads
the team in yards gained. Two
weeks ago he was shifted to full
back from the halfback post where
he had played all season.
Johnny Holding is holding down
the quarterback slot for the third
consecutive year. His passing has
not been as effective as it was last
year, when he had 14 completions
in 16 attempts in one game.
Ray Malcolm at left half ranks
among the first ten in the nation
as far as runbacks on punts, kick
offs, and pass interceptions are con
cerned.
The big force in the line is Hank
Ford who was named the outstand
ing lineman in the Cal - Montana
game last year.
The main problem seems to be
lack of depth and lack of weight in
the line. As of now the only man
who is definitely out of tomorrow's
game is 0!e Hammerness. fullback
who is out for the season.
It could be that the Grizzlies are
ready to come through with a su
perior performance.
