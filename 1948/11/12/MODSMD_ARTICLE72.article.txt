Three thousand miles is a long way to hitch-hike (even if a person
itch-hikes by air) to see a football game. When your team lose.) by a
■'< to 0 score there are those who are quick to ask, "Was it worth it?"
In the case of the Stanford-Army game the answer is, "Yes, yes indeed."
-ven when one adds up the consequences of such a trip—lost schoolwork,
ost, etc.—it was worth the effort.
It was worth the trip to see Army in action. It is my belief that the
v .imy team that played last week can beat any team on the West Coast
'y at least three touchdowns .... that includes California.
Army Described as "Deadly"
One word can describe this Army team—"Deadly." Never before has
his writer seen a team block and tackle with such efficiency. It seemed
hat every time an Army back swept end he would have 10 blockers out
i front of him. plus the two Army mules. Every time a Stanford back
.ould shake himself through the line he would be met by a vicious
Lickle that stopped him, but quick.
We just don't play that brand of football on the Pacific Coast. Yet.
ith all things considered, I believe the Cards put on one of their best
hows of the year in Yankee Stadium.
1 hiit is hard to believe when you consider-the score, 43 to 0. But there
nt 43 points difference in the two teams. There isn't seven points dif—
i ence between the two first teams.
MitclielTs Loss Hurl
After Stanford lost Emery Mitchell they did not belong on the same
Id with this Army squad. We couldn't make yardage through the line
id our quarterbacks were rushed off their feet. This lack of protec
on for the passer is the reason that the Cards gained but 57 yards by
tshing. Too many times did the quarterbacks get dropped for big losses
t the closing moments of the game.
It Mitchell had remained in the game to toss passes four yards back
om his fullback spot, the score would have been very different. We
ight have scored and would certainly have controlled the ball more.
You who listened to the game over the radio must have wondered at
e ease with which the Army backs broke loose for long gainers. The
lswer was speed, downfield blocking, fresh reserves, and more speed.
Ymy used a quick count and this gave the appearance of even more speed.
Not a Clean Game
The game was not a clean game. Scout Ray Hammett had warned the
un that the officials used a slow whistle and called few penalties. This
.irked to the disadvantage of the outmanned Cards. That the game was
ugh is evident by the injury list.
But back to the statement that the game was one of the better per
rmances turned in this year by the Indians. The Cadets scored often
d from far out. but the Cards stopped them dead in their tracks more
an once. They did this in the face of a fresh offensive squad. Until Stan
rd can field a team with some depth after the first team, they should not
iet such teams as Army.
Many words have been written about the "platoon system" that Army
es. Hie crowd hated it, and booed every time Blaik sent in a new
im. It didn't make for a fair game against the Indians and the fans
night that this was using an unfair advantage.
Gene Martin Tops as Receiver
Dne player who has received very little mention this year is Gene
irtin. I consider Martin the best pass-catching end I have seen in col
late play. He has come up with spectacular catches in seven of the eight
lies thus far this season. I don't see how he does it. He should be
;d al la Alan Beals—keep nine men in to block and send Gene out
catch the pass.
Job White is regarded as a fine running back but he deserves mention
his defensive abilities. He made tackle after tackle last week. He
i a poor first quarter but came back to amaze all by his tackling finesse,
hits low and hard and doesn't hesitate. Few of the touchdowns were
red over White. The loss of Dave Field hurt not a little. He. too, is
ine defensive back.
'erhaps the best man on the field for the Cards was Don Campbell. He
ved little offensive ball but was a stalwart on defense.

Dne player who has received very little mention this year is Gene
irtin. I consider Martin the best pass-catching end I have seen in col
late play. He has come up with spectacular catches in seven of the eight
lies thus far this season. I don't see how he does it. He should be
;d al la Alan Beals—keep nine men in to block and send Gene out
catch the pass.
Job White is regarded as a fine running back but he deserves mention
his defensive abilities. He made tackle after tackle last week. He
i a poor first quarter but came back to amaze all by his tackling finesse,
hits low and hard and doesn't hesitate. Few of the touchdowns were
red over White. The loss of Dave Field hurt not a little. He. too, is
ine defensive back.
'erhaps the best man on the field for the Cards was Don Campbell. He
ved little offensive ball but was a stalwart on defense.
Three thousand miles is a long way to hitch-hike (even if a person
itch-hikes by air) to see a football game. When your team lose.) by a
■'< to 0 score there are those who are quick to ask, "Was it worth it?"
In the case of the Stanford-Army game the answer is, "Yes, yes indeed."
-ven when one adds up the consequences of such a trip—lost schoolwork,
ost, etc.—it was worth the effort.
It was worth the trip to see Army in action. It is my belief that the
v .imy team that played last week can beat any team on the West Coast
'y at least three touchdowns .... that includes California.
Army Described as "Deadly"
One word can describe this Army team—"Deadly." Never before has
his writer seen a team block and tackle with such efficiency. It seemed
hat every time an Army back swept end he would have 10 blockers out
i front of him. plus the two Army mules. Every time a Stanford back
.ould shake himself through the line he would be met by a vicious
Lickle that stopped him, but quick.
We just don't play that brand of football on the Pacific Coast. Yet.
ith all things considered, I believe the Cards put on one of their best
hows of the year in Yankee Stadium.
1 hiit is hard to believe when you consider-the score, 43 to 0. But there
nt 43 points difference in the two teams. There isn't seven points dif—
i ence between the two first teams.
MitclielTs Loss Hurl
After Stanford lost Emery Mitchell they did not belong on the same
Id with this Army squad. We couldn't make yardage through the line
id our quarterbacks were rushed off their feet. This lack of protec
on for the passer is the reason that the Cards gained but 57 yards by
tshing. Too many times did the quarterbacks get dropped for big losses
t the closing moments of the game.
It Mitchell had remained in the game to toss passes four yards back
om his fullback spot, the score would have been very different. We
ight have scored and would certainly have controlled the ball more.
You who listened to the game over the radio must have wondered at
e ease with which the Army backs broke loose for long gainers. The
lswer was speed, downfield blocking, fresh reserves, and more speed.
Ymy used a quick count and this gave the appearance of even more speed.
Not a Clean Game
The game was not a clean game. Scout Ray Hammett had warned the
un that the officials used a slow whistle and called few penalties. This
.irked to the disadvantage of the outmanned Cards. That the game was
ugh is evident by the injury list.
But back to the statement that the game was one of the better per
rmances turned in this year by the Indians. The Cadets scored often
d from far out. but the Cards stopped them dead in their tracks more
an once. They did this in the face of a fresh offensive squad. Until Stan
rd can field a team with some depth after the first team, they should not
iet such teams as Army.
Many words have been written about the "platoon system" that Army
es. Hie crowd hated it, and booed every time Blaik sent in a new
im. It didn't make for a fair game against the Indians and the fans
night that this was using an unfair advantage.

un that the officials used a slow whistle and called few penalties. This
.irked to the disadvantage of the outmanned Cards. That the game was
ugh is evident by the injury list.
But back to the statement that the game was one of the better per
rmances turned in this year by the Indians. The Cadets scored often
d from far out. but the Cards stopped them dead in their tracks more
an once. They did this in the face of a fresh offensive squad. Until Stan
rd can field a team with some depth after the first team, they should not
iet such teams as Army.
Many words have been written about the "platoon system" that Army
es. Hie crowd hated it, and booed every time Blaik sent in a new
im. It didn't make for a fair game against the Indians and the fans
night that this was using an unfair advantage.
Gene Martin Tops as Receiver
Dne player who has received very little mention this year is Gene
irtin. I consider Martin the best pass-catching end I have seen in col
late play. He has come up with spectacular catches in seven of the eight
lies thus far this season. I don't see how he does it. He should be
;d al la Alan Beals—keep nine men in to block and send Gene out
catch the pass.
Job White is regarded as a fine running back but he deserves mention
his defensive abilities. He made tackle after tackle last week. He
i a poor first quarter but came back to amaze all by his tackling finesse,
hits low and hard and doesn't hesitate. Few of the touchdowns were
red over White. The loss of Dave Field hurt not a little. He. too, is
ine defensive back.
'erhaps the best man on the field for the Cards was Don Campbell. He
ved little offensive ball but was a stalwart on defense.
