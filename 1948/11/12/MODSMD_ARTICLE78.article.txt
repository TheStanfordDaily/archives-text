# Pickers Choose Indians To Trounce Grizzlies
## 
### 
Three tied games and five upsets threw a monkey wrench into the
machinery last weekend, allowing the peerless pickers only 12 wins in
20 starts. The old season's average took a 15-point nosedive, and now
stands at .791.
This week's selections:
Stanford over Montana by IS. Even Deke Houlgate picks us this wvek.
California over Washington State by 20. The Bears have to look good
in this one.
L'SC over Washington by 12. The Huskies are always easy in the Coli
