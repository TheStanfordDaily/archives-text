# Card Dunkers Tangle With Bears Tomorrow Morning
## 
### 
Stanford water polo enthusiasts
j will get their last look of the sea
! son tomorrow morning when the
| Indians challenge the California
! Bears at Encina Pool at 11 o'clock,
i The Stanford frosh and the Gal
frosh will battle at 10 in a prelim
i inary to the varsity tilt.
The Cards under the direction of
i Coach lom Haynie are presently in
| a tie for first place along with
Southern Cal. and will be natu
rally favored to win tomorrow. The
j Bears have hit the victory column
! in PCC play only one time this year,
| that a 4 to 3 win over the inexpe
rienced UCLA Bruins.
I However, anything can happen in

a Big Game. Last year's game here
at Stanford was a special thriller,
the Cards coming out on top 3 to 2
with a last-second goal. The Bears
1 lost a number of their players by
graduation, but have been steadily
improving throughout the season.
The Indians will open the game
with the same starting lineup that i
they have had all season. Forwards I
— Hairy Borchers, Fritz Maurer. j
| and Hub Stokely: guards — Ralph
Saia, Don Weeden, and Ken Fox;
goalie — Kim Fletcher. Ed Major
and Don Patch will probably see
plenty of action.
Stanford will meet the Bears
i again next Saturday at Berkeley.
