# Indians Coast To Easy Victory
## 
### DAN WINSTON 
Under wraps all the way, Stanford Indians rapped
out a 39 to 7 decision over the Montana Grizzlies in
Stanford Stadium Saturday to win their third con
ference game of the season.
The Indians were never pressed and even resorted
to kicking on second downs in the last half in an at
tempt to hold down the score. Staford scored with
nine minutes left to play in the first quarter on a pass
from Aubrey Devine to Bob White after the Indians
had driven from the Montana 41 to the 9-yard line.
Marty Anderson reeled off 17 yards for the longest
run of the drive and Campbell converted to put the
Indians ahead, 7 to 0.
Then the Montana Grizzlies showed their teeth for
the first and last time in the entire game. The Grizzlies
drove to the Stanford 34 on the fine passing of John
Helding, only to lose the ball on downs. Stanford

lost the ball on dov/ns on the Stanford 43 when A 1
Turriziani failed to make the inches needed for a
first down.
Grizzlies Tie It Up n
From the Stanford 43, the Grizzlies' passing attack
went to work and riddled a weak Stanford pass de
fense. Jack O'Loughlin, a good back despite his
lack of support from the Montana line, pitched to
Reynolds for 17 yards and a first down on the Stan
ford 26-yard line. After two running plays and a
penalty for encroaching on the neutral zone, Helding
passed from the 15 and hit Bauer in the end zone
for six points. Preuninger converted and the score
was knotted at 7 to 7 at the end of the first quarter.
Stanford took 10 plays to put Montana's Grizzlies
back with the cubs. Marty Anderson scored on a
plunge from the one to cap a drive from the Montana
47 with two 12-yard jaunts by Bob White setting up

the score. Campbell's conversion attempt was no
good and the score was 13 to 7.
Seconds later the Indians had scored again. Whit
Budge pounced on O'Loughlin's fumble on the Mon
tana 11 and on the third play Bill DeYoung smashed
over left tackle for two yards. Don Campbell's con
version attempt failed and Stanford led 19 to 7.
DeYoung Around End for a TD
DeYoung got the next Touchdown for Stanford on
a 38-yard sweep around left end to end an 81-yard
march that took only six plays. DeYoung got all 81
yards on jaunts of 19, 22, and 38 yards, and one smash
of two yards through the middle. Devine converted
to send the count to 26 to 7.
Turriziani started Stanford's next drive by inter
cepting Helding's pass on the Stanford 47. Nafziger
got three yards at right tackle, then Benson slashed
