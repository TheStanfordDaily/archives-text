# Big Game Parade Follows Old Stanford Tradition
## 
### 
When the 50 Big Game floats parade around Quad Friday
night to celebrate the annual Bear-Indian Big Game Saturday,
old timers can compare it to the first Big Game parade in 1931.
A torchlight procession was the order of the day that time, and
students followed the band on foot or in automobiles down to

the Pavilion for a rally followed by
the Big Game bonfire.
In the parade five years later the
students serpentined to the rally
carrying a coffin, supposedly con
taining the Cal Bear. After the rally
the coffin was placed atop the bon
fire and spectators took the success
ful burning of the bear's funeral
pyre as a sign that the Indian?
would win the Big Game that yea:
Floats Added
It was not until 1937 that float;
were added to the parade; to re he.-
were no longer used. The floats fol
lowed the band just down the Row
and then the rest of the parade wen:
on to- the rally and bonfire. No car -
were allowed on the Row, and the
light was provided by having as
many cars as possible park l'acin.,
the street in the driveways along tin
way with their headlights turned or.
Various floats in this first float
parade were the Roble baby buggy
two sieam rollers as "Big Red Ma
chine" and "Little Red Kiddie Kar".
and a take-off on a "Daily" cartoon
The ROTC unit rode as Indians or.
horseback and the fire engine n!s
joined in the parade.
1938 Parade
Fifty numbered floats were en
tered in the parade of 1938. ThL
time Rally Com members carried
torches. Winners in a large variety
of divisions were awarded prizes u r .
the rally. Roble's "Kid Party'
snatched the women's hall, bes:
women's, and the sweepstakes prize
that year. Another winning entry
was a hot dog stand with girl
shouting "Bear With Bun."
The parades were discontinued i:
1940 because of the war. They we: â– _
begun again two years ago. This
time, however, the parade was held
the night after the rally and bon
fire. With the theme the Big Game
per usual, many interesting floats
were entered.
Last Year
Last year Stanford celebrated
Homecoming at Big Game time: ac
cordingly the floats were built r
the theme "History of Stanford.'
This was the first year floats de
picted other than just Big Game. A
life-sized cable car entered by SAE
carried off the highest honors.
"Stanford of the Future" is th
theme of the float parade this yea
and from the variety of float
listed, promises to be a good parade
