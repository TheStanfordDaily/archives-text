Tickets for Big Game Gaieties, opening Wednesday night in

Friday, however, are for the upper
balcony or for single seats down
stairs. Students may obtain tickets
in the ASSU office.
Gaieties' musical revue, while it
has no one special theme, will offer
a variety of dance routines, skits,
and many new, original songs.
Typical of the skits to be pre
sented are "Television â€” Take It
Away," letting one in on the troub
les to be faced by Mr, Average Man
in the Television Age.
The finale will depict Stanford
students leaving on the rooters'
train for Cal and the Card victory.
Curtain time will be delayed
until 9:15 p.m. on Thursday and
Friday so as not to interfere with
other scheduled Big Game activi
ties, stated Bud Irving, director of
this year's production.
Eight different sets in addition to
various set pieces for soloists will
be featured in the production. Har
old Niven is in charge of the sets,
Doug Russell, of costumes, and Don
ShefFey, of music.
This year will bo the eleventh
since the Gaieties show became a
part of traditional Big Game ac
tivities back in 1938.
