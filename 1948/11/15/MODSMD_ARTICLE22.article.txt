## Council Goes Too Far 
### 
One of the dangers to self-government—whether it be the
]argest state or the smallest example of student government —is
the usurping of powers by one branch of government from an
other. Last week Stanford's Women's Council ordered into ef
iect the new demerit plan, a penalty system for Women's social
regulations. We consider Council's action an overuse of its
judicial authority for this reason:
The demerit plan IS a legislative measure and comes under
the direct jurisdiction of Associated Women Students and indirect
jurisdiction of the ASSU Executive Committee.
Yet, Women's Council put this plan into effect last Friday
without securing AWS approval.
One of the Council members argued that the plan was merely
a punitive measure, not subject to AWS approval. However,
The Daily emphasizes that a legislative body, such as AWS or
Excom, must decide not only rules and regulations but also
penalties for those rules and regulations. A court or judicial
body, such as the Council, on the other hand, tries the persons
disobeying the law. Then, the judgment is passed.
Women's Council is an established judicial body, but in the
absence of legislation, it has its legal right to set up such a
penalty system. However, Women's Council took far too much
liberty in initiating a major system that should have been chan
neled through the ASSU legislative branch—AWS and Excom.
On the basis that it also demolished an existing system (lock
ins), the Council acted without authority.
This judicial body worked smoothly and thus "hoodwinked"
both AWS and Excom into verbal approval of their plan when it
was first introduced.
The Council's position in this case has been unreasonable.
Women's Concil has assumed that all its penalty system de
cisions were justified because it is an elective body chosen to
represent Stanford women.
If any women's group is representative of Stanford women
and can provide legislation on social regulations, it is AWS.
Council's only authority is to judge disputes involving violations
of ASSU and University regulations.
There should be a sharp line of demarcation between the func
tions and duties of legislative and judicial bodies when 2,000
women are affected. Women's Council was not elected to "hand
down the law," for the final legislative authority belongs to AWS
and to Excom.
An example of the independent manner Council assumed in
'he action is the speed the judicial organization rushed the de
merit plan through AWS and through Excom without any formal
vote of approval.
Last Wednesday afternoon Council declared that the demerit
system would go into effect Friday night. At Thursday's AWS
meetin, a member of Women's Council made a similar informal
announcement to that body, with no previous consultation with
the AV/S Advisory Board.
Excom heard of Council's decision last Wednesday night. Still,
the powers of Council were not questin. Excom, we believe,
was unaware of its own rights and duties in preventing such
procedure, and it took the Council member's word that the meas
ure was punitive and came solely under Council's jurisdiction.
There are two results of Council's procedural "hoodwinking":
(1) The demerit plan will be permanent Wednesday night
unless petitions now being circulated among men and women
students are submitted to the ASSU office or Excom by Wednes
day night. Excom must then interpret the plan to decide whether
changes in social regulations should be by-law changes.
v2) If the demerit plan stays on the basis of this procedure
:ollowed by Women's Council, then the Council in the future
might "pass" any sort of extreme legislation because of this
precedent. This is a dangerous weapon for five women to
wield.
The demerit plan is an example of good legislation,' however,
we object to Women's Council taking extreme liberty with its
delegated authority by "railroading" the plan past AWS and
Excom.

announcement to that body, with no previous consultation with
the AV/S Advisory Board.
Excom heard of Council's decision last Wednesday night. Still,
the powers of Council were not questin. Excom, we believe,
was unaware of its own rights and duties in preventing such
procedure, and it took the Council member's word that the meas
ure was punitive and came solely under Council's jurisdiction.
There are two results of Council's procedural "hoodwinking":
(1) The demerit plan will be permanent Wednesday night
unless petitions now being circulated among men and women
students are submitted to the ASSU office or Excom by Wednes
day night. Excom must then interpret the plan to decide whether
changes in social regulations should be by-law changes.
v2) If the demerit plan stays on the basis of this procedure
:ollowed by Women's Council, then the Council in the future
might "pass" any sort of extreme legislation because of this
precedent. This is a dangerous weapon for five women to
wield.
The demerit plan is an example of good legislation,' however,
we object to Women's Council taking extreme liberty with its
delegated authority by "railroading" the plan past AWS and
Excom.
One of the dangers to self-government—whether it be the
]argest state or the smallest example of student government —is
the usurping of powers by one branch of government from an
other. Last week Stanford's Women's Council ordered into ef
iect the new demerit plan, a penalty system for Women's social
regulations. We consider Council's action an overuse of its
judicial authority for this reason:
The demerit plan IS a legislative measure and comes under
the direct jurisdiction of Associated Women Students and indirect
jurisdiction of the ASSU Executive Committee.
Yet, Women's Council put this plan into effect last Friday
without securing AWS approval.
One of the Council members argued that the plan was merely
a punitive measure, not subject to AWS approval. However,
The Daily emphasizes that a legislative body, such as AWS or
Excom, must decide not only rules and regulations but also
penalties for those rules and regulations. A court or judicial
body, such as the Council, on the other hand, tries the persons
disobeying the law. Then, the judgment is passed.
Women's Council is an established judicial body, but in the
absence of legislation, it has its legal right to set up such a
penalty system. However, Women's Council took far too much
liberty in initiating a major system that should have been chan
neled through the ASSU legislative branch—AWS and Excom.
On the basis that it also demolished an existing system (lock
ins), the Council acted without authority.
This judicial body worked smoothly and thus "hoodwinked"
both AWS and Excom into verbal approval of their plan when it
was first introduced.
The Council's position in this case has been unreasonable.
Women's Concil has assumed that all its penalty system de
cisions were justified because it is an elective body chosen to
represent Stanford women.
If any women's group is representative of Stanford women
and can provide legislation on social regulations, it is AWS.
Council's only authority is to judge disputes involving violations
of ASSU and University regulations.
There should be a sharp line of demarcation between the func
tions and duties of legislative and judicial bodies when 2,000
women are affected. Women's Council was not elected to "hand
down the law," for the final legislative authority belongs to AWS
and to Excom.
An example of the independent manner Council assumed in
'he action is the speed the judicial organization rushed the de
merit plan through AWS and through Excom without any formal
vote of approval.

system would go into effect Friday night. At Thursday's AWS
