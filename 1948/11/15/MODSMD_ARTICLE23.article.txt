To the Editor:
Tickets for the Big Games Gaieties are sold on a "first come, first served"
basis. Why then, permit individuals to buy as many as 50 tickets apiece
for one performance?
Since the cast gets first choice of the tickets (which is as it should be),
enough good seats are already gone by the time the general ticket sale
starts. Its quite a low blow to be among the first in line and then find
that almost all the tickets which are at all desirable are gone due to the
mass buying of a few.
{ Each individual should be limited to preferably six (which is enough
for a triple-date), and certainly not more than 10, tickets for any one
performance.
