Stanford roughs aren't the only
ones who are bothered by the ra
tio. Nearby San Jose Staters are
complaining about the lack of
women. Latest figures show that
there are 2,621 girls to 4,420 men
at SJC.
Although that ratio is not as lop
sided as the Farm's, the Spartans
have additional disadvantages in
the fact that less than one-half of
the coeds live near the campus.

Speaking of women, the Sigma
Chi's at lowa State College had a
new switch on "We Hate Women
Week" recently.
They held a "witch hunt" party.
Each member of the fraternity had
to roam the streets and campus and
come back to his house within an
hour with the ugliest woman he
could find. She was his date for
the evening, and a queen of the
witches was crowned.

Although President Truman's re
election was a bitter blow to some
Stanfordites, the students at UCLA
used his victory as an inspiration
for their football team. Signs were
plastered on the southern campus
last week before the Cal - UCLA
game. They read:
"If Harry can do it, so can we."

It was a super-deluxe lock-in for
one University of Michigan student
arrested last week for drunken
driving.
After sentencing him to five days
in jail, the judge arranged for him
to spend one day each weekend for
five weeks in the county jail, "in
order not to interfere with his
studies."

Butch, the pet cougar of the
Washington State College football
team, was recently stolen by prank
sters from the University of Idaho.
Legally, the pranksters could be
in for a rough time, since Butch is
under 21. and was carried across
the state line. Butch is a girl, too,
according to recent tests.

Radio giveaways were given the
gate at the University of Akron in
Ohio last week.
When 250 students were asked
"Do you believe the big radio give
away shows are good entertain
ment?" 190 of those polled answered
an emphatic no. Fifty-one gave
yes to the programs, and nine said
they had no opinion on the sub
ject.
Comments on the "giveaways"
ranged from "horrible" to "putrid."

Pacific Lutheran College was the
scene of a near riot at the girls'
dorm last week.
Coeds, stripped of every vestige
of glamour, and with flannel night
gowns. shortie pajamas, pin curls,
and cold-cream-smeared faces, ran
screeching from the dorm when
the fire alarm Sounded about mid
night.
It was only a false alarm, but
the show stopped all male activity
in the neighborhood lor nearly an
hour.

Radio giveaways were given the
gate at the University of Akron in
Ohio last week.
When 250 students were asked
"Do you believe the big radio give
away shows are good entertain
ment?" 190 of those polled answered
an emphatic no. Fifty-one gave
yes to the programs, and nine said
they had no opinion on the sub
ject.
Comments on the "giveaways"
ranged from "horrible" to "putrid."

Pacific Lutheran College was the
scene of a near riot at the girls'
dorm last week.
Coeds, stripped of every vestige
of glamour, and with flannel night
gowns. shortie pajamas, pin curls,
and cold-cream-smeared faces, ran
screeching from the dorm when
the fire alarm Sounded about mid
night.
It was only a false alarm, but
the show stopped all male activity
in the neighborhood lor nearly an
hour.
Stanford roughs aren't the only
ones who are bothered by the ra
tio. Nearby San Jose Staters are
complaining about the lack of
women. Latest figures show that
there are 2,621 girls to 4,420 men
at SJC.
Although that ratio is not as lop
sided as the Farm's, the Spartans
have additional disadvantages in
the fact that less than one-half of
the coeds live near the campus.

Speaking of women, the Sigma
Chi's at lowa State College had a
new switch on "We Hate Women
Week" recently.
They held a "witch hunt" party.
Each member of the fraternity had
to roam the streets and campus and
come back to his house within an
hour with the ugliest woman he
could find. She was his date for
the evening, and a queen of the
witches was crowned.

There must have been a Republi

Although President Truman's re
election was a bitter blow to some
Stanfordites, the students at UCLA
used his victory as an inspiration
for their football team. Signs were
plastered on the southern campus
last week before the Cal - UCLA
game. They read:
"If Harry can do it, so can we."

It was a super-deluxe lock-in for
one University of Michigan student
arrested last week for drunken
driving.
After sentencing him to five days
in jail, the judge arranged for him
to spend one day each weekend for
five weeks in the county jail, "in
order not to interfere with his
studies."

Shades of the Mann Act!
Butch, the pet cougar of the
Washington State College football
team, was recently stolen by prank
sters from the University of Idaho.
Legally, the pranksters could be
in for a rough time, since Butch is
under 21. and was carried across
the state line. Butch is a girl, too,
according to recent tests.
