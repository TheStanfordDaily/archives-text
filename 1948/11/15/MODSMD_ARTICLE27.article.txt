# BILL DAILEY
## Bull Session 
### 
Again this ayem my schizophrenic mind has conjured up another little
scene for all those lovers of the drama. "Lights . . . music . . . ah, music;
shall we dance? ... all right, just once around to the adrenalin
The scene is the chapter room of that prominent University of Cali
fornia fraternity, Smelta Nu Fish. (Its members join just for the halibut.
All right, so ycu don't understand that gag. Repeat aloud. It still isn't

funny.)
To continue, as our scene opens, the house presi
dent, Sonny Wisecarver, picks up his gavel and raps
vigorously for order. Vigorously, who is the vice
president, immediately floors President Wisecarver
with a short left jab. "Watch where you're rapping
that gavel, will ya!" he complains.
"Sorry, old man," apologizes Sonny, "but I have
some important business to bring before the house.
It's about our annual trip to the Peninsula to paint
the buildings at Paly High. This matter has got to
come to a head!"

"Why don't we take it down to the men's room at. Stephens Union?''
Ignoring this suggestion, Sonny continues. "Men, this is serious. We've
got to uphold the honor of dear old Smelta Nu Fish. This year we've got
to do something drastic to those upstarts at Paly High. After all, we
must remember that we are Cal men."
Five minutes of silence, followed by a unison burp.
Vigorously has another suggestion. "Two years ago, a midget friend of
mine threw a bomb in the third floor at Paly High."
"Wait a minute. How could a midget get up to the third floor window?"
"A couple of his friends put him up to it!"
At this point, Vigorously is stoned to death by the rest of the chapter.
A hand is timidly raised in the back of the room. "A . . . a . . . fellows,
I hesitate to suggest this, but I've been thinking about it for a long time!
Now I've got to get it oft my chest. This year, instead of painting Paly
High, why don't we paint . . . you know, that other school?"
But Wisecarver is quick to silence this suggestion. "How could you
even think of such a thing, brother.' After all, we have nothing against
those girls at Mills! No, men, our plan of action is set. Now, let's carry
it out. Synchronize your de-coder rings. Viva la Smelta Nu Fish, E
Pluribus Unum, and look out. Paly High!"

From the Mailbag:
A note that reached me too late for Friday's deadline, asked me to plug
thf SIRO auction which was held last Friday. The communique (from a
coed, yet), suggested a slogan which even I don't have the gall to print,
but I'll still be very happy to pitch the SIRO drive. If you are one of
the ones who haven't contributed to the campaign yet. get oft your
wallet and do it. Yes, you.

I hesitate to suggest this, but I've been thinking about it for a long time!
Now I've got to get it oft my chest. This year, instead of painting Paly
High, why don't we paint . . . you know, that other school?"
But Wisecarver is quick to silence this suggestion. "How could you
even think of such a thing, brother.' After all, we have nothing against
those girls at Mills! No, men, our plan of action is set. Now, let's carry
it out. Synchronize your de-coder rings. Viva la Smelta Nu Fish, E
Pluribus Unum, and look out. Paly High!"

From the Mailbag:
A note that reached me too late for Friday's deadline, asked me to plug
thf SIRO auction which was held last Friday. The communique (from a
coed, yet), suggested a slogan which even I don't have the gall to print,
but I'll still be very happy to pitch the SIRO drive. If you are one of
the ones who haven't contributed to the campaign yet. get oft your
wallet and do it. Yes, you.

Again this ayem my schizophrenic mind has conjured up another little
scene for all those lovers of the drama. "Lights . . . music . . . ah, music;
shall we dance? ... all right, just once around to the adrenalin
The scene is the chapter room of that prominent University of Cali
fornia fraternity, Smelta Nu Fish. (Its members join just for the halibut.
All right, so ycu don't understand that gag. Repeat aloud. It still isn't

funny.)
To continue, as our scene opens, the house presi
dent, Sonny Wisecarver, picks up his gavel and raps
vigorously for order. Vigorously, who is the vice
president, immediately floors President Wisecarver
with a short left jab. "Watch where you're rapping
that gavel, will ya!" he complains.
"Sorry, old man," apologizes Sonny, "but I have
some important business to bring before the house.
It's about our annual trip to the Peninsula to paint
the buildings at Paly High. This matter has got to
come to a head!"

"Why don't we take it down to the men's room at. Stephens Union?''
Ignoring this suggestion, Sonny continues. "Men, this is serious. We've
got to uphold the honor of dear old Smelta Nu Fish. This year we've got
to do something drastic to those upstarts at Paly High. After all, we
must remember that we are Cal men."
Five minutes of silence, followed by a unison burp.
Vigorously has another suggestion. "Two years ago, a midget friend of
mine threw a bomb in the third floor at Paly High."
"Wait a minute. How could a midget get up to the third floor window?"
"A couple of his friends put him up to it!"
At this point, Vigorously is stoned to death by the rest of the chapter.
A hand is timidly raised in the back of the room. "A . . . a . . . fellows,
I hesitate to suggest this, but I've been thinking about it for a long time!
Now I've got to get it oft my chest. This year, instead of painting Paly
