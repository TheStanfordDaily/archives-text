# Central Valley Water Troubles Explained
## 
### 
THE THIRSTY LAND, by Robert
Dc Roos (Stanford University
Press)
A Stanford alumnus has written
one of the few really impartial re
ports on the Central Valley Project.
Newspaperman De Roos is merely
attempting to present the facts and
the arguments presented by both
sides of the three separate contro
versies that have arisen. Actually,
no one disagrees with the initial
aim of the project, that of bringing
water to the San Joaquin Valley.
It is here, however, that any agree
ment ends.
There is, first, the fight over the
actual construction between the
Army and the U.S. Bureau of Rec
lamation. Then the distribution and
control of the power produced at
Shasta Dam and at other planned
dams between the P.G. & E. and the
government. Finally, by far the
most serious conflict is the dis
agreement over the 160-acre limi
tation proposal, which eventually
becomes a matter of States' Rights.
What De Roos shows is that there
is an obvious compromise for all
three of the disputes. Still, al
though the fight has been going on
for years, no single faction has yet
been willing to compromise. That,
of course, is one of the main reasons
why the Central Valley Project is
still so far from completion.
De Roos also points out the ef
fect upon the San Joaquin Valley.
It is the unfortunate paradox in
this state that the Sacramento Val
ley, having one-third of the land of
the great valley, has two-thirds of
the water; whereas the San Joaquin

Valley, having two-thirds of the
land, has only one-third of the wa
ter. Thus, until the project is com
pleted, this waste of land and natu
ral resources will continue. De Roos
also has shown the terrible losses
which occur when the state, as it
often does, has a particularly dry
cycle.
The tragedy of the delay lies in
the fact that California is a great
agricultural state, yet much poten
tially arable land must lie idle while
the various factions carry their dif
ferences through the State Legisla
ture, the U.S. Congress, and count
less governmental bureaus. It is the
question of how many more dry
seasons and the subsequent damage
to California's agricultural economy
are going to come before some defi
nite decision is finally made. The
one significant fact is that the city
people at last are becoming aware
of the situation which has harried
the farmers tor a needlessly pro
tracted period.
The whole vital issue has been
very ably expressed in the closing
passages of the book. De Roos
writes, "In the past it was gold that
came from the fabulous Sierra
streams to bring men wealth. Now
from those same hills, from those
same streams, comes the one inex
haustible resource, the one sure
wealth of the state. The rancher
knows, and the city-dweller is com
ing to realize, that the snow on the
Sierra and the rain of California's
gray winters are the future.
How the water is to bo used will
determine what California is to be."
