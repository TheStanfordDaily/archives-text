# Prospective Cal Marauders Caught And Shaved Before Damage Done
## 
### 
Six California students, four men
.-.nd two women, traversed the long
road from Berkeley Thursday night
only to be caught before they had
used any of their large stock of
pai' 3n the Farm.
( three of the men actually
ot to Stanford with their artistic
'.nt tions. The other men and the
■v'tnien remained in Palo Alto.
As Encina was not organized for
guard duty on this night, 10 fresh
volunteers from Village Dormi
tory 206 watched the campus.
About 2:30 a.m. a road block which
the Villagers had set up at Embar
cadero spotted a '40 Ford converti
ble. Later the Ford was spotted near
the Union and after a chase the car
was stopped by the night policemen

near the campus fire station about
4 a.m.
The three occupants of the car
were taken to Encina room 223
where their heads were shaved.
From there, the prisoners were shut
tled to the Village and their heads
were painted.
The rest of the party was subse
quently picked up in Palo Alto and
sent back to Berkeley unshaven.
The three intruders. Jay Gluck.
William Catell, and Robert Nelson,
all of Berkeley, were introduced
Friday at the SIRO rally in front of
the Cubberley Auditorium.
The unfortunate invaders also
bragged of previous exploits. About
a week ago, they said, they painted
the SAE lion and a large heart in
front of one of the women's living

groups. They reported that the ,
Stanford woman for which it was |
intended was angry, and that their
second trip was made principally
for the purpose of obliterating the
heart.
* The campus was reported all quiet |
and no damage was found either |
on Friday or Saturday nights.
However, Encina guards reported j
some difficulty in obtaining identi- ;
fication from passing cars and pedes- :
trians. They ask that Stanfordites 1
carry their student body cards at \
night and be co-operative with 1
guards at road blocks and other in
spections.
During Big Game week the guard j
wiU be composed of Encina wings |
working on assigned shifts.


CALIFORNIA STUDENTS Jay Gluck. William Ca
tell. and Robert Nelson were caught last Thursday
night in an attempt to paint the Stanford campus.
Eucina was not yet organized, so it was a 10-man
volunteer guard of frosh from Village 20(» that caught

the Cal students with the aid of the campus night
police. The raiders were immediately shaved in En
cina and then transported to the Village, where their
heads were painted.
