Well out in front all the way,
Stanford's frosh water polo team
shared an easy 6 to 1 win over
California's yearlings Saturday
morning in the Encina Pool.
Coach Ed Rudloff sent in the re
serves in the second half after, Stan
:ord had piled up a 4 to 0 lead in
ihe first two periods. California's {
ione score came on a free throw !
ejected for fouling.
Stanford's scoring was split six j
after the Stanford guard had been j
vays, with Bob Wycoff, Dick Hill. '
Lloyd Dinkelspiel, Ray Secoy, Bill :
x lack, and John Hollenbeck cred- !
ted for one apiece. Teamwork on |
ffense and an air-tight defense re- \
-ulted in a smooth Stanford unit !
vhich was never threatened and |
vhich took a lopsided game.
The victory continued the team's j
vinning habits. Defeat at the hands ;
