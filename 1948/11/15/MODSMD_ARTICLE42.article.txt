# Water Poloists Shut Out Cal, 5 to 0; Borchers Stars
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Despite a Cal flagman who
//as "asleep at the switch," the
Stanford waterpoloists moved !
one step closer toward their bid
for the PCC championship by
shutting out the California Bears, 5
to 0. last Saturday morning in En
cina Pool.
With the score standing at 1 to 0 in
a first half, Captain Harry Bor
chers poured in what everyone i
thought was his second goal. How- !
ever, the flag signifying the score
did not wave. When the referee j
asked the Cal flagman if a goal had j
been scored, he replied that he !
didn't see it.
The half-time whistle soon i
sounded, and the Cards had to be I
content with a slim one-point mar- ,
cin. over their inspired rivals.
Borchers Scores Again
It was Borchers who tallied the
the Indians' second "oflieial" point
midway in the third quarter. The j
Cal defenders were beginning to tire
low, as the Cards controlled the j
ball a majority of the time.
With the Bear offense going no j
.place fast the Indians' final three J
points in the last quarter were just
.iravy. With three Cal men on top |
jf the high-scoring Borchers, Harry !
leverly tossed the ball over his j
lead to teammate Fritz Maurer, who
,vas in the clear. Maurer easily fired
he ball into the corner of the cake
0 make the score 3 to 0.
Midway in the final quarter Bor- !
.•hers tallied again. After one Card j
hot had failed, he dove for the Cal '
goalie, juggled the ball momen- j
arily, and then pushed it past the
urprised Bear defender.
For the final score. Forward Fritz j
.laurer threw the ball from close in. :
t was partially deflected by the busy I
3al goalkeeper, but the ball had just
nough power to hit the end of the
age.
Substitutes Galore
With the battle already won, j
'oach Tom Haynie substituted j
reely in the final period. The first i
tringers received well-deserved ap- j
Jause for their splendid perform
nee as each player left the pool.
Although the Card offense really !
of rolling in the second half, it was !
he stalwart defense that won the '
Big Game" for Stanford. Guards
!alph Sala, Don Weeder and Ken
ox had the Cal forwards bottled!
p throughout the all-important
ontest. Several tremendous saves !
1 the first half must be credited to J
Joalie Kim Fletcher, who played
awlesly in his position.
Coach Tom Haynie's defending
hampions will move to Berkeley j
ext weekend to play their final j
ame of the season. The Indians j
r ill again tackle the Bears on the |
loining of the Big Game, to close a
ighly successful season.

With the score standing at 1 to 0 in
a first half, Captain Harry Bor
chers poured in what everyone i
thought was his second goal. How- !
ever, the flag signifying the score
did not wave. When the referee j
asked the Cal flagman if a goal had j
been scored, he replied that he !
didn't see it.
The half-time whistle soon i
sounded, and the Cards had to be I
content with a slim one-point mar- ,
cin. over their inspired rivals.
Borchers Scores Again
It was Borchers who tallied the
the Indians' second "oflieial" point
midway in the third quarter. The j
Cal defenders were beginning to tire
low, as the Cards controlled the j
ball a majority of the time.
With the Bear offense going no j
.place fast the Indians' final three J
points in the last quarter were just
.iravy. With three Cal men on top |
jf the high-scoring Borchers, Harry !
leverly tossed the ball over his j
lead to teammate Fritz Maurer, who
,vas in the clear. Maurer easily fired
he ball into the corner of the cake
0 make the score 3 to 0.
Midway in the final quarter Bor- !
.•hers tallied again. After one Card j
hot had failed, he dove for the Cal '
goalie, juggled the ball momen- j
arily, and then pushed it past the
urprised Bear defender.
For the final score. Forward Fritz j
.laurer threw the ball from close in. :
t was partially deflected by the busy I
3al goalkeeper, but the ball had just
nough power to hit the end of the
age.
Substitutes Galore
With the battle already won, j
'oach Tom Haynie substituted j
reely in the final period. The first i
tringers received well-deserved ap- j
Jause for their splendid perform
nee as each player left the pool.
Although the Card offense really !
of rolling in the second half, it was !
he stalwart defense that won the '
Big Game" for Stanford. Guards
!alph Sala, Don Weeder and Ken
ox had the Cal forwards bottled!
p throughout the all-important
ontest. Several tremendous saves !
1 the first half must be credited to J
Joalie Kim Fletcher, who played
awlesly in his position.
