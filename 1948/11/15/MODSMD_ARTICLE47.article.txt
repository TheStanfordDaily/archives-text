# Soccer Team Bows To USF
## 
### 
The University of San Francisco
Dons came from behind to score
two goals in the third quarter to
defeat Stanford 3 to 2 at St. Igna
tius field Saturday morning. The
win enabled the Dons to remain in
a tie with California for the league
title.
The stubborn Indians scored first
in the first quarter, but USF came
back to tie the score at 1 to 1 at
half-time. The Dons then scored
twice in the third period, and the
best Stanford could do was a fourth
quarter goal by Larry Peterson.
The Indians continued to show
improvement, but the hefty Dons
just had too much for the "little
men" from the Farm. Coach Dona
hue's men have lost only to the
Cal Aggies this year, and that was
a 1 to 2 loss a week ago Saturday.
