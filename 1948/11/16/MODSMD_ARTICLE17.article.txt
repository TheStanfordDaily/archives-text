A new electron microscope which
■ enables scientists to probe fields
! which the ordinary microscope can't
I reach has been installed in the
' Stanford Research Institute. This
| has been provided to SRI by the
| Radio Corporation of America.
Ordinary microscopes using a
I beam of light cannot magnify more
j than 2,000 times because light wave
1 lengths are too long. Above the
power of 2,000 the image is merely
made larger; no new detail is re
vealed.
When, ten years ago, scientists
developed a microscope using a
j beam of electrons instead of light,
i it became practical to magnify ob
jects 100,000 times. A photograph of
a cigarette so magnified would be
lour and one-third miles long.
This new addition to Stanford
eßsearch Institute equipment will
; be useful in any field where ordi
j nary light - beam microscopes are
i used. The electron microscope will
Ibe particularly useful in bacteri
ology, chemistry, and metallurgy.
