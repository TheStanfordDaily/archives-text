A distinguished professorship in
law will be set up at the Stanford
Law School as the result of a large
bequest from the estate of William
Nelson Cromwell, it was announced
yesterday by Dean Carl D. Spaeth.
To be known as the William N.
Cromwell Professorship, the new
chair will be officially established
as soon as the funds are received
from the Cromwell estate which is
now in probate.
Creation of the new chair was
approved by the University's Board
of Trustees upon recommendation
of Acting President Alvin C. En
rich and the faculty of the Law
School.
While the exact arnount of the
bequest to Stanford will not be de
termined until the estate is settled,
it is probable that it will be con
siderably in excess of $200,000. Dean
Spaeth said.
