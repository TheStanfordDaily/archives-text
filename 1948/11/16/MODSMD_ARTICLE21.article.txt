Five-star Admiral Chester A. Nim

Tarawa as a "very necessary oper
ation" to protect nearby U.S. ai:
bases.
He told a special news confer

the Japanese after the latter's east
ward expansion had been halted.
Marine General H. M. (Howlin"
Mad) Smith wrote in a Saturday
Evening Post article that Tarawa,
in the Gilbert chain of islands,
should have been bypassed.
Although not mentioning anyone
by name, Nimitz said he wished to
refute such statements.
"I felt sure that the parents of
those who lost their lives in the
action would suffer awakened grief
and anguish if they felt the action
was unnecessary. Tarawa was a
very necessary operation."
To get control of the strategic
Marshall. Caroline, and Mariana in
lands, the admiral said, the U.S.
