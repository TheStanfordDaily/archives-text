# Seven Foreign Students Here on ASSU Fund
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
Last year ASSU voted $9,050 to
cive loreign students a chance to
>tudy in the United States.
This year seven European stu
dents, each with a year's all-ex
pense-paid scholarship, are living
and learning at Stanford.
Through the co-operation of the
living groups on campus and the
supervision of the ASSU Foreign
Scholarships Committee, this plan
has become a successful and prac
tical program.
Plan Divided Three Ways
Financially the plan is divided
among three groups. ASSU provides
transportation, books, one-half tui
tion, and some money for incidental
expenses from the original $9,050.
The other half of the tuition is paid
by the Administration. Room and
board and a major portion of spend
ing money is paid by the fraterni
ties and residences where the for
eign students live.
Originally the program was to
have included more students, but
increased expenses limited the
number to seven. They are Marga
rita Goldstein and Claude Gizard
of France; Pcntti Lehti and Tero
Vaisanen, Finland; Naboth van Dijl,
Holland; Josef Weisinger, Austria;
and Sigrid Leube, Germany.
All Meet Requirements
These students were selected
from applicants who applied to a
student and faculty committee. All
passed University standards of eli
gibility and desirability, and final
selection was then left to the living
groups concerned.
Few problems have arisen with
integration. Without exception, the
seven students have been accepted
into the society of both the student
body and their living groups.
Arrangements have been made so
that the five men will stay at a dif
ferent residence each quarter. This
fall Alpha Sigma Phi. Sigma Nu,
Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta,
and Toyon are hosts. In winter
quarter the men will move to Theta
Delta Chi, Kappa Sigma, Theta Xi,
Alpha Kappa Lambda, and Beta
Theta Pi fraternities. Next spring
they will live at Toyon, Delta Chi,
Theta Chi, Chi Psi, and Sigma Al
pha Epsilon houses. The two wom
en remain in the same residences

throughout the year â€” Miss Gold
stein at Lagunita and Miss Leube
at Union.
Appointment Bureau
Other services are being main
tained in conjunction with the pro
gram. The Foreign Scholarship
Committee, headed by Chairman
Frank Wolff, operates an appoint
ment bureau through which living
groups and organizations may con
tact students for invntations to din
ners, meetings, and various social
aftairs.
Already the students have ap
peared in newsreels, television,
newspaper interviews, and over
KSU.
Under the direction of Corre
spondence Secretary Lewis Scott,
the committee communicates with
aOO other American colleges to sup
ply information on the mechanics
and progress of this program.
Plan Is Successful
The plan has more than fulfilled
its original objectives. First, it has
given foreign students an opportu
nity to study in the United States
and to participate in university life
here. Secondly, it has provided
Stanford students with a direct line
on what has occurred and what is
occurring now in Europe. Finally,
it has provided a working example
for other schools and colleges.
It is the hope of the committee
that this program will be carried on
by many other American colleges,
so that the understanding it fosters
may be a real contribution'to world
peace.
