## Politics in Practice 
### 
Once again The Daily has received letters (all from the same
group) suggesting or demanding that partisan political speakers
$e permitted on campus. In the letter printed below the Young
Progressives try to make the point that students should get
practice" in politics, as well as theory—meaning that the stu
dent body should hear political speakers on campus.
What the Young Progressives really have up their sleeves is:
(1) Appearance on campus of a member of their party would
enhance their standing, since the average newspaper reader
would interpret the appearance as approval by Stanford of the
group;
(2) A speaker from their ilk would add prestige, maybe even
followers, to their group, something the Young Progressives
have failed to do by themselves.
Their real motives are purely selfish. They have no real in
terest in whether or not students in the political science depart
ment are getting the proper training.
That is why the University must continue to refuse such re
quests. Rightly or wrongly, appearance of partisan speakers on
campus is interpreted outside the University as approval by the
Jriiversity of the partisan group. It causes the University a great
deal of embarrassment and harm.
But let s dismiss the actual motives of the Young Progressives
:or the moment. Let's consider their avowed motives. Is there
really a need for "politics in practice" as evidenced by the ap
pearance of partisan speakers on campus?
We think not. Students can get all the practical politics they
3ieed or want from the newspapers, magazines, radios, or by
attending political rallies or speeches near the University.
There would be no added benefit to the students by havina
political speakers on campus. In addition, the attendance would
De poor. There would be advantages to certain minority organ
.zations, as indicated above. But the majority of the students
•vould prefer not to have the added disturbance on campus.
