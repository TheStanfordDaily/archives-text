## How to Write Bull 
### 
Psychologists tell us that insanity
takes many forms. My particular |
type, a mild form of paranoia called '
Bull Session, appears in this paper '
every weekday except Wednesday. |
In recent weeks, there has been j
a growing fear at the offices of The !
Stanford Daily that my keeper will
soon discover my present where
abouts and take me back to the '
home. Because of this fear that I
will soon be gone, the editors have I
asked me to divulge the secrets of i
writing a Bull Session. And so I 1
shall.
Qualifications:
(1) You must be a complete idiot.
(2) You must have a cynical out
look on life. This is a must! How
else can you sound like an author
ity on anything if you don't criti
cize everything that falls under
your gaze? Who ever heard of a
columnist who has actually com-

mended anyone or anything? It's ridiculous!
(3) You must not have any friends. On second thought, I won't make |
-.his qualification a pre-requisite. After you have written no more than
three columns, you won't have any friends left anyway.
(4) You must not be startled by other students who stare at you as
jf you were crazy. Just stare back at them as if you are not.
(5) You must be willing to work for coolie wages. (This reminds me j
of the Chinese woman who gave birth to a white child. Said she in
answer to her husband's demands for an explanation: "Well Occidents
will happen!") But that's another story.
Now that we have decided you have the necessary qualifications for
".he .lob, you must pick out a subject on which to write. Let us say '
you decide to write about last Saturday's football game with the Mon
ti.na Drizzlies. Now some ol you might think that it would be necessary
:or you to go to the game in order to write about it. This is a dirty lie!
After all, why should you sacrifice yourself by sitting in that nasty old j
sun when you can read about the game in the Sunday morning paper, j
I his is assuming, of course, that you can read.) I repeat, don't expose
yourself to the sun. There is no sense in writing a half-baked story.
Now that you have the necessary facts for your Bull Session, put them
all in a cocktail shaker. Fill the container with cracked ice, shake well,
<nd serve garnished with periods and commas. And there it is: The I
elixir of journalistic success.
In closing, students, I would advise you to study the above instruc- '
-ions carefully. You never can tell, we may have a 10-minute quiz on,
this tomorrow.

will soon be gone, the editors have I
asked me to divulge the secrets of i
writing a Bull Session. And so I 1
shall.
Qualifications:
(1) You must be a complete idiot.
(2) You must have a cynical out
look on life. This is a must! How
else can you sound like an author
ity on anything if you don't criti
cize everything that falls under
your gaze? Who ever heard of a
columnist who has actually com-

mended anyone or anything? It's ridiculous!
(3) You must not have any friends. On second thought, I won't make |
-.his qualification a pre-requisite. After you have written no more than
three columns, you won't have any friends left anyway.
(4) You must not be startled by other students who stare at you as
jf you were crazy. Just stare back at them as if you are not.
(5) You must be willing to work for coolie wages. (This reminds me j
of the Chinese woman who gave birth to a white child. Said she in
answer to her husband's demands for an explanation: "Well Occidents
will happen!") But that's another story.
Now that we have decided you have the necessary qualifications for
".he .lob, you must pick out a subject on which to write. Let us say '
you decide to write about last Saturday's football game with the Mon
ti.na Drizzlies. Now some ol you might think that it would be necessary
:or you to go to the game in order to write about it. This is a dirty lie!
After all, why should you sacrifice yourself by sitting in that nasty old j
sun when you can read about the game in the Sunday morning paper, j
I his is assuming, of course, that you can read.) I repeat, don't expose
yourself to the sun. There is no sense in writing a half-baked story.
Now that you have the necessary facts for your Bull Session, put them
all in a cocktail shaker. Fill the container with cracked ice, shake well,
<nd serve garnished with periods and commas. And there it is: The I
elixir of journalistic success.
In closing, students, I would advise you to study the above instruc- '
-ions carefully. You never can tell, we may have a 10-minute quiz on,
this tomorrow.

Psychologists tell us that insanity
takes many forms. My particular |
type, a mild form of paranoia called '
Bull Session, appears in this paper '
every weekday except Wednesday. |
In recent weeks, there has been j
a growing fear at the offices of The !
Stanford Daily that my keeper will
soon discover my present where
abouts and take me back to the '
home. Because of this fear that I
will soon be gone, the editors have I
asked me to divulge the secrets of i
