# Do You Need Office Space?

### 
Student organizations feeling the j
pinch of cramped quarters now
have the chance to attempt to se- j
cure additional office space.
The ASSU. if enough requests
are made, will seek additional space
for student organizations through a
plan being initiated by Village Ex
com member Marianna Olmstead.
Miss Olmstead said yesterday
that organizations needing more j
room should sign up at the ASSU
office. A request to the Adminis
tration will then be made. There is
no promise that the University will
comply with the request, however,
Miss Olmstead said.
The Excom member's interest in
the issue arose from her service
with the Stanford branch of the
National Student Association, which
is now in search of more office
space. The NSA has been located
in the offices of the lIR, but since j
the programs of both organizations j
have expanded, they have been ;
seeking more room.
Although no official action has '
been taken on the part of any of
the organizations, complaints about
lack of office space have been heard
frequently. Miss Olmstead urged j
that the groups make their wishes {
known as soon as possible. The
request will probably be made i
through the office of the student
manager, and will not need the.
sanction of Excom.
