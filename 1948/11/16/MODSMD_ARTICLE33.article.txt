CALIFORNIA STEPPING-STONES
by Robert Buell (Stanford Uni
versity Press)
This book is an interesting and
simplified history of the state of
California. The author has divided
the history into seven divisions.
Surprisingly enough, California's
diverse history divides and classi
fies itself nicely into Mr. Buell's
plan. Naturally, these sections rep
resent the seven most colorful eras
in California. The first, Indian land,
an interesting anthropological study
of the original Californians. The
second, Mission land, needs little
description. The third, Monterey,
covers the post-mission era, includ
ing, of course, the arrival of the
Americans in the heretofore Span
ish domain. There follow the chap
ters "Sutter's Fort" and "Days of
"49." Then "The Golden State"
which shows the emergence of Cal
ifornia into its full status as a state
of the Union. The last section, new
stepping-stones, covers the possi
bilities of the state.

All in all, the book is a good, easy
reference for California history. Al
though not a comprehensive study,
it better represents a facile outline
of the history of the state.â€”Pris
