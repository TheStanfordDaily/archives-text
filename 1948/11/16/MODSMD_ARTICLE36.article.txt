## Finland Fights Defeat 
### 
Courage and work through nine
years of hardships have kept Fin
land a free country. And soon, her
pre-war standard of living will be
regained.
In 1939, Finland was one of the
most prosperous countries in Eu-

rope. The high
level of culture
of her inhabi
tants and their
stubbornness and
national pride
had led to this
enviable result
within the space
of a few years,
since Finland
was not inde
pendent before

1917. Vast forests gave the Finns
wood and pulp - paper, invaluable
export articles. Copper minesâ€”the
largest in Europe, sea trading, and
stock grazing were not neglected
either, and they contributed to put
the export trade 30 per cent over
the import figure in the average
year.

This bright pictui"e came (o an
end on Nov. 30, 1939, when the Red
Army invaded Finland, alleging
that the little republic of 4,000,000
was a threat to Soviet security. In
deed, the Russians had carefully
timed their attack: Britain and
France had just declared war
against Germany, and all they could
do for Finland was to promise
troops which never arrived. Ger
many, tied by the Molotov-Ribben
trop pact, did not move either,
though the Soviet action directly
affected her interests in the Baltic.
As to Sweden and Norway, Fin
land's immediate neighbors, they
had based their whole foreign pol
icy on peace and disarmament and
now trembled lest they should get
involved in these unexpected inter
national complications.
Will of Resistance
The masters of the Kremlin had
foreseen all that. The only thing
they had disregarded was the Fin
nish will of resistance. It proved to
be stubborn. Under the command
of Field Marshal Mannerheim, their
World War I hero, the Finns beat
back all Soviet assaults on the for
tifications across the Karelian isth
mus.
In the north, at Suomussalmi, ski
ing detachments of the Finnish army
came upon suddenly, cutting to
pieces, two Soviet divisions abso
lutely unprepared for winter war.
The number of Soviet PW's was

growing day after day.
In the long run, the small-sized
Finnish Army was unable to with
hold the Russians any longer. Peace
was signed in Moscow in March,
1940, after a gallant fight of nearly
four months. Finland had to give up
a large strip of territory on which
an all-Finnish population was liv
ing.
German Alliance
It was no surprise after that to
see Finland allied with Germany
against Russia in June. 1941, in
order to reconquer the lost Kare
lian province. However, Finnish
democratic institutions were care
fully safeguarded.
The aim was just attained, when
Finland found herself entangled in
a world-wide war. The tide turned.
With the American material landed
at Murmansk, the Red Army drove
back the Finns and invaded Fin
land once again in the summer of
1944.
A new treaty of peace was signed.
It included extremely hard clauses
for the Finns, such as the obligation
of attacking the German troops left
in Finland. The Germans consid
ered that as treachery from former
allies and retaliated by burning
frame-house villages in northern
Finland.
Territories Lost
The eastern territories are lost
again. Of the 420.000 who were liv
ing there, only 1.000 chose to stay
under Soviet rule. Finland had to
take care of all the others, pro
viding them with homes and jobs.
Moreover, Soviet troops have taken
over the naval station of Porkkala,
at the entrance of the Gulf of Fin
land, for 50 years.
The reparations to Russia were
put at the fantastic figure of $300.-
000.000, according to the value of
the dollar in 1938. to be paid in
goods, machinery, and shipping. As
much as 80 per cent of this amount
has now been settled.
Although Finland is scrupulously
enforcing the peace terms, recent
developments of her political life
should be noted.
The overthrow of the Communist
Interior Minister Leino by Presi
dent Paasikivi a few days before
the spring elections, the result of
those same elections which utterly
defeated the Communists, and the
reluctance of the Finns to enter an
alliance treaty with Russia, all
prove the vigilance shown by the
little but valiant Finland to pre
serve her independence.
