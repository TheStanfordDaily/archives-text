To the Editor:
That politics is the business of the many, and not the few, is the as
sumption upon which the American way of life is based. What can the
many do, now that quadrennial elections are over? They can work
toward making that assumption the truth.
The key task before us at Stanford is to overcome the notion that
politics lies outside the domain of the University. As the future intel
lectual leaders in our democracy, students have an especial right to political
training. This mean practice as well as theory; modern science and philoso
phy have exposed the sterility of a split between the two.
Practice means the right of political groups to exist legally on campus;
il means the right of the student body to hear political candidates on
the campus. In the next four years there will be many issues and elec
tions on which the public—including Stanford—will need to be informed
and to express sentiment.
It is no answer to say that Stanford is unique and those who don't
like il should go elsewhere. If there is something uniquely wrong which
enough people do not like, it should be changed. This is the belief in
democracy. Young Progressives invites evejyone who shares that belief
to join them in their coming fight for recognition.
