# New Proposal in Berlin Stew
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 15 (/P). — The six
"neutral" nations of the United Na
tions Security Council completed
tonight a new compromise proposal
on the Berlin crisis calling for con
cessions from both sides.
A reliable informant who dis
closed this said the six nations were
prepared to present the proposal if
current mediation efforts by top UN
officials fail.
Direct Negotiations
These efforts came last week in
the form of an appeal for direct ne
gotiations on the Berlin question by
Trygve Lie, UN Secretary General,
and Dr. Herbert V. Evatt of Aus
tralia. president of the General As
sembly.
The foreign ministers of the three
big Western powers — the United
States, Britain, and France — were
scheduled to meet tomorrow to
draft answers to the appeal. Their
reply was expected to amount to a
rejection of the plea, which called
for negotiations between Russia and
the Western powers to end the So
viet blockade of Berlin.
The new compromise proposed by
Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China,
Colombia, and Syria would call on
Russia to modify its demand for a
simultaneous lifting of the Soviet
blockade and a settlement of the
currency question.
Special Committee
An entirely new factor would be
a proposal to have the Security
Council name a special committee
to supervise lifting the blockade.
This new approach to the prob
lem reportedly was drafted late to
day:
1. Lifting of blockades on roads
to Berlin—but not on the railways
or canals—within 48 hours after re
ceipt of the communications to the
governments involved.
2. Lifting of the railway and
canal restrictions by stages along
with negotiations on the currency
issue which are to begin as soon as
the highway blockade is lifted.
3. Travel restrictions are to be
lifted entirely and the currency
problem is to be settled simulta
neously on Dec. 20.
