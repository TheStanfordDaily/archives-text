# Gaieties Has Long, Honorable Ancestry; Tradition Since 1911
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
In the early days of the century
when vaudeville was still in its
prime, several of the local players
formed an off-the-gridiron team
which for ."7 years has provided
Stanford with dozens of musical
"scores."
Autumn 1911 was the date that a
small group of Farm students and
professors established a new dra
matic organization, later to become
"Ram's Head." A week before the
Big Game that same year, the play
ers produced their first light dia
matic work with an all-student cast.
Happily, the play was a success, and
so it was that "The Gaieties" was
born.
No women appeared in the early
productions ol Gaieties. However,
"Wooing Wohlma" of 1913, pre
sented some of the Farm's best fe
male impersonators, all well-sup
plied with the necessary padding.
Nearly everyone in the cast wooed
the beauteous Wohlma, until she was
sacrificed to the God Peli.
"Let's Get Married" was the theme
of the 1914 Ram's Head show, just
as most of its cast were preparing
to enlist in the army. During World
War I. Chappie clowns took over
the Gaieties with their famous runs
of Campus Queens.
When the Stanford Stadium was
erected in 1922, the show became
the "Football Frothies" extrava
ganza, a gay burlesque of every
local character from the campus cop
to the University registrar.
Frankie Masters, playing at the St.
Francis Hotel, turned his orches
tra over to cast members of the '35
Big Game Gaieties. That night, top
songs from the show were previewed
before a San Francisco audience.
The same audience saw the boys
from the Farm scalp Cal, 13 to 0.
a few days later.
When Norm Standlee was holding
down tlie fullback position on the
team of 38, Ram's Head called pre
game signals with the first Gaieties

that boasted a Big Game theme.
Rudy Vallee heard the production's
hit song, "Tune in Gn Love," and
later sang it on his radio program.
Although Stanford lost a heart
breaker to Cal, 6 to 0, that year, they
came back a few weeks later with
a 13 to 0 victory over Dartmouth,
which was then rated the number
three Eastern team.
In 1945, the first post-war Gaieties
was produced with a Navy theme
called "A Girl in Every Port," but
without a Big Game to accompany
the show. Stanford sailors from the
local NROTC unit provided the nau
tical cast which sailed though one of
the best Gaieties performances in
recent years.
'"Gaieties '48'' has returned the
football prerogative with numerous
variety take-offs and a carnival
theme which has provided a straight,
fast-moving musical review.
