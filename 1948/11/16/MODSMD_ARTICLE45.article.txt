# Marchie: 'We'll Be Ready'

### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 15 </P>.—
California's Coach Lynn (Pappy)
Waldorf and Stanford's Coach Mar
chie Schwartz were fully in agree
ment on one thing today—past foot
ball records mean very ltitle when
"Big Game" time rolls around.
Speaking at the weekly football
writers' meeting, Pappy said:
"You don't have to look very far

back to toss out past records—just
last year. We were very fortunate
to win that one by a 21-18 score.
"I have a great deal of respect
for Stanford and we're under no il
lusions about next Saturday. We'll
have to be at our very best." Pappy
added the Bears' squad would be in
sound shape physically for the first
time this season. The only question
marks are tackle Jim Turner and
half Bob Dal Porto, out with in
juries.
Schwartz said the Indians, too.
would be "mentally ready and at
full physical strength," barring, of
course, fullback Emery Mitchell,
injured in the Army game and out
of the Bear encounter.
The Indian coach said Stanford
has "done fairly well against the
same teams Cal has played but we
haven't run up the same scores. He
picked out the Washington, USC,
and UCLA encounters as samples
of good Stanford ball.
