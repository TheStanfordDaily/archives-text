After spending 60 minutes patiently waltzing around with Montana
feeble football team last Saturday, the Indian footballers finally walki
walked oft the field without having had a chance to prove a goldurnc
thing, except that the tattle-tale-grey-shirted invaders were the poon
group of gridders to enter the Stadium this season.
For those few patrons who were requested to pay cash to view th
proceedings, it was the greatest waste of time and money since th
Howard Hughes investigations.
And although Montana's fullback Jack O'Loughlin and its clever q
Johnny Helding demonstrated that the Card pass defense actually wasn
and that Stanford is obviously weak in protecting itself against kicko
runbacks, the game was strictly a dud as for being a good prep for tl
last-approaching California battle.
Montana picked up 212 yards and scored its first conference touchdow
through the air, and John O'Loughlin came dangerously close to goii
all the way at least three different times on kickoff returns.
Grind Ahead
The way things panned out, the varsity now has to rely on this la
week of practice to set itself for the all-important Big Game. Consi
quently, several rugged scrimmage sessions have been scheduled f<
this week.
Whether the benefit gained from said practice will be sufficient to co]
with Cal remains to be seen. The Golden Bear has been ready for Stai
ford since that night last year when he went home in a miserable moo
having lost his pride after a 21 to 18 mistake that almost became tl
upset of the year. That game has been bothering him all year, and bett
than anything else, he wants to crush the Indian.
Stanford is the last step for Caliiornia which is on the way to an und
feated, untied, and glorious Rose Bowl season. So, don't fool yourse
the Bears are not going to take this Big Game lightly. The odds probab
won't be as high as the now-famous 10 to 1, but there is no doubt
to the public favorite.
But please, please, don't count Stanford out. It's the old Big Gar
act, and in such ivy-clad atmosphere, anything could happen—even
Strawberry Canyon, the protected lair of brother Bear.
Cheers for Rally Committee
Rally Committee, that organization of wit, women, and song, will t<
in the works Thursday night when the entire student body is expect
to turn out to honor the football team and its coaches at the traditior
Big Game Bonfire and Rally.
Making it their farewell performance of the football season, the smili
rally designers will go all out to put on an impressive show. They wc
hard, these back-stage spirit raisers, and any praise they might recei
is well-deserved to say the least.
With gals such as Annie Hutchison, etc., etc., supplying the cereb
inspirations, the men and women of Rally Committee have accomplish
a colorful, well-organized season of activity. It wouldn't hurt to give th<
a vote of approval and maybe a nod of thanks at the Big Game.
Touchy Subject
Stanford's nomination for football team of the year, the Army Mu
to turn out to honor he football team and its coaches at the traditioi
The Cadets had to fall back on a 103-yard run by Bobby Stewart, .
a last-second touchcjpwn pass to overcome a 20-19 Pennsylvania lead.
Illinois, a team that had looked just as good as Army in their rec»
meeting, was crushed by mediocre Ohio State, 34 to 7. All of which mal
Ai my considerably less than unbeatable, an adjective which several pi
sons were quick to dig up when Stanford tumbled two weeks ago.
Army may still rank as third-best team in the nation, but there ;
teams that would like to dispute the fact. Take Northwestern on a No
Dame*afternoon, and the Wildcats would make mincemeat out of the Mi
Other teams coukl be added to the list.
Oregon or California
An interesting situation will develop if California defeats Stanford ;
Oregon does the same to Oregon State next Saturday. Both will be urn
feated in PCC competition, and both will be eligible for the Rose B<
call. Which school will get the nod is up to the PCC Board, a group m;
up of one representative from each University in the conference.
If northern schools decide to get chummy, Oregon could get the
on a 6 to 4 vote. Use your fingers and figure it out. But all eyes
being foscused on California.
Oregon's loss to Michigan (although a respectable 14 to 0 affair)
the face of California's 40 to 14 romp over Wisconsin, greatly hinc
Webfoot chances.
Stanford could supply the easy answer to the problem. Ah. Ore
and Roses, a gift from a Big Game miscarriage.
