# Farm Professors Describe Use Of Radio Waves in Measuring
## 
### 
The use of radio waves to develop new and more accurate
methods of scientific measurement was described by two Stan
ford professors yesterday at the fall meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences on the University of California campus.
Professor Felix Bloch spoke about the work he and his col-

leagues, Professor Hans Staub and
David Nicodemus, have been doing
with the neutron, one of the basic
atomic particles.
Report on Work
Professors Laurence A. Manning
and Oswald G. Villard Jr. reported
on their measurements of the speed,
height, and path of meteors, as well
as on the pressures and tempera
tures through which they pass.
From a small laboratory on an iso
lated hill back of campus, Profes
sors Manning and Villard direct
continuous high-frequency radio
waves at the sky. These are re
corded on sensitive instruments
when they bounce back from the
electrical disturbances created by
meteors passing through the iono
sphere, the earth's rarefied upper
strata of air.
This is a simpler way of tracking
meteors, and just as accurate or
more so than the other two meth
odsâ€”radar or astronomical cameras.
Night or day, the professors are able
to "spot" several meteors a minute,
compared to the average visual rate
of detection of ten an hour.
Method Explained
Concerning the work on neutrons,
Profesor Bloch said the method used
has been a combination of the polar-
ization of neutrons and the nuclear
induction method. The neutron's re-
action to a magnetic field has been
measured very, very accurately, as
well as the reaction of the deutron.
Dr. Bloch said that Harvard and
Stanford simultaneously began to
study atomic nuclei by measuring
the effect on them of high-fre
quency radio waves when the nu
clei were placed in an electro
magnetic field.
