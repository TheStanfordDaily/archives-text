### MARGIE BOTTS 
"The abdication of Queen Wil
helmina was not due to her dis
approval of the Dutch progres
sive policy in regard to Indo
nesia," stated Dr. E. van Raalte
of The Netherlands in a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture in Memorial
Auditorium last night.
Dr. van Raalte, specialist in con
stitutional and international law,
and well known journalist, lecturer,
and legal historian, gave a first-hand
report of the reign and personality
of Queen Wilhelmina.
"The rumor that disunity existed
between Wilhelmina and her minis
ters over the Indonesian question it
a political lie," Dr. van Raalte said.
The last official act of the queen be
fore abdication was lo sign the con
stitutional revision which provided
for the Indonesian Federation.
The queen abdicated Sept. 4. 19-1-8.
because she believed that she did
not have sufficient strength to carry
on her duties at the previous level
of efficiency. Thus, she preferred to
hand over the reins of government
to her daughter, Juliana.
"Juliana promises to be an exeel

lent head of state, thanks to the
marvelous example given her by her
illustrious mother," Dr. van Raalte
added.
Dr. van Raalte, who holds the
degree of Doctor of Law from the
University of Leyden, and is also a
member of the ?>taft' of the University
of Amsterdam, reviewed the event>
in the Dutch public life for the past
50 years in wheih Wilhelmina has
reigned.
"The period from 11)40 was the
most difficult that Wilhelmina ever
faced," Dr. van Raalte said. From
1940 to 1945 the Dutch government
was in exile in England, and after
the war, the country was faced with
the gigantic job of repairing the
damage done by the Nazi occupation.
Dr. van Raalte noted that the
growing sympathy among the peo
ple for the Socialist and Communist
parties has in no way endangered
the position of the throne.
"The Communists now compose
seven per cent of the electors, but
their leaders do not even dare call
the country a republic, because of
the great popularity of the queen."
Dr. van Raalte described Wilhel
mina as a real mother to the Dutch

nation. He cited examples of her
interest in the people, her dignity,
strong will, stubbornness, and her
ability to admit mistakes.

because she believed that she did
not have sufficient strength to carry
on her duties at the previous level
of efficiency. Thus, she preferred to
hand over the reins of government
to her daughter, Juliana.
"Juliana promises to be an exeel

lent head of state, thanks to the
marvelous example given her by her
illustrious mother," Dr. van Raalte
added.

degree of Doctor of Law from the
University of Leyden, and is also a
member of the ?>taft' of the University
of Amsterdam, reviewed the event>
in the Dutch public life for the past
50 years in wheih Wilhelmina has
reigned.
"The period from 11)40 was the
most difficult that Wilhelmina ever
faced," Dr. van Raalte said. From
1940 to 1945 the Dutch government
was in exile in England, and after
the war, the country was faced with
the gigantic job of repairing the
damage done by the Nazi occupation.
Dr. van Raalte noted that the
growing sympathy among the peo
ple for the Socialist and Communist
parties has in no way endangered
the position of the throne.
"The Communists now compose
seven per cent of the electors, but
their leaders do not even dare call
the country a republic, because of
the great popularity of the queen."
Dr. van Raalte described Wilhel
mina as a real mother to the Dutch

nation. He cited examples of her
interest in the people, her dignity,
strong will, stubbornness, and her
ability to admit mistakes.

helmina was not due to her dis
approval of the Dutch progres
sive policy in regard to Indo
nesia," stated Dr. E. van Raalte
