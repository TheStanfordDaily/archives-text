Dr. van Raalte was here to give
the Tuesday Evening lecture.
Foreign news was given top em
phasis as soon as the papers began
publishing alter the liberation, and
that policy has continued, although
newsprint is so scarce that the pa
pers are limited to four pages.
Dr. van Raa'te was not optimis
tic about the chances of success of
the United Nations. The big power
veto is a basic weakness, he said,
but if the West and East can reach
agreement on fundamental issues,
there is still hope.
Circulation of Dutch papers does
not compare with ours, even in the
large cities. Dr. van Raalte ex
plained this by saying that the
newspaper is a family institution in
the Netherlands. Each family buys
one paper and everyone reads it.
Morning papers are not profitable
because Holland does not have a
large race of strap - hangers who

added.
