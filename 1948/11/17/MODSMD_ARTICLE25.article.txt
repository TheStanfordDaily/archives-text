# DU's Beat V206 in Overtime; Phi Delts Down V314,13 to 0
## 
### 
They say there has to be a first
time for everything; so here is the
story of a football game decided in
an overtime period.
The DU's mural grid squad was
the victor in a storybook contest
yesterday afternoon as they downed
the Fightin' Frosh from Village 206
in four quarters and ten minutes of
play.
The teams were battling in a
first-round overtime playoff game;
and it was decided to play a sur
den - death overtime period when
the regulation playing time ran out
with the score knotted at 6 to 6.
Defensive play had key ho ted the
fracas the first four quarters, and
the i;eferees were preparing to
break out the flashlights and pup
tents to see the contest through.
But the DU's finally won their race
against the setting sun when Nor
man Lattin unleashed a fourth
down aerial complete to Ben Car
dinelli for the winning touchdown.
This made the final score 12-6, as
DU forgot even to attempt the extra
point in their excitement. Cardi
nelli, incidentally, ended the bi
zarre contest in truly fitting style
with a leaping, twisting circus catch
on the goal line.
DU's Lead fi to 0
The Row boys drew first blood
early in the game when Lattin
broke loose for a 65-yard run that
carried him all the way. They
failed to convert, however, and the
score remained 6 to 0 for DU going
into the second quarter.
Midway through the period, DU
Jake Preston passed from the Men
loites' 20-yard line, Villager Harry

j King intercepted on his own 10,
; Chuck Pelton threw the traditional
: key block, King sizzled the sod for
I 70 yards, and the score was tied at
) (j to 6.
And that's just where it remained
j until Lattin's twilight toss put a
[ sudden stop to the proceedings.
Lattin, Preston, and Jerry Stan
| ley all looked good for the victors;
while King and Chuck Stark were
the standouts for 206.
Phi Delts Win
The Phi Delt Rams moved into
i the second round of the playoffs
with a clear-cut 13 to 0 win over
the second Village representative,
' 314. Gordy Rice claimed a mo
j nopoly of the scoring in this one
i by placing himself on the receiving
; end of both touchdown tosses. The
j first one was thrown by George
Little in the opening period, Dave
, Dahle heaving the other one with
three minuta* of the contest re-
I maining.
The Village gridders missed a
I scoring opportunity in the second
quarter when Dick David blocked
; an attempted punt by Little and
George Ellingson recovered on the
Ram five. They were further aided
■ by an unnecessary roughness pen
! alty which carried them half of the
i remaining distance to the goal line,
but four attempted running plays
were halted there by the Phi De'ts.

j scoreless tie with their dorm mates

story of a football game decided in
an overtime period.
The DU's mural grid squad was
the victor in a storybook contest
yesterday afternoon as they downed
the Fightin' Frosh from Village 206
in four quarters and ten minutes of
play.
The teams were battling in a
first-round overtime playoff game;
and it was decided to play a sur
den - death overtime period when
the regulation playing time ran out
with the score knotted at 6 to 6.
Defensive play had key ho ted the
fracas the first four quarters, and
the i;eferees were preparing to
break out the flashlights and pup
tents to see the contest through.
But the DU's finally won their race
against the setting sun when Nor
man Lattin unleashed a fourth
down aerial complete to Ben Car
dinelli for the winning touchdown.
This made the final score 12-6, as
DU forgot even to attempt the extra
point in their excitement. Cardi
nelli, incidentally, ended the bi
zarre contest in truly fitting style
with a leaping, twisting circus catch
on the goal line.
DU's Lead fi to 0
The Row boys drew first blood
early in the game when Lattin
broke loose for a 65-yard run that
carried him all the way. They
failed to convert, however, and the
score remained 6 to 0 for DU going
into the second quarter.
Midway through the period, DU
Jake Preston passed from the Men
loites' 20-yard line, Villager Harry

j King intercepted on his own 10,
; Chuck Pelton threw the traditional
: key block, King sizzled the sod for
I 70 yards, and the score was tied at
) (j to 6.
And that's just where it remained
j until Lattin's twilight toss put a
[ sudden stop to the proceedings.
Lattin, Preston, and Jerry Stan
| ley all looked good for the victors;
while King and Chuck Stark were
the standouts for 206.
Phi Delts Win
The Phi Delt Rams moved into
i the second round of the playoffs
with a clear-cut 13 to 0 win over
the second Village representative,
' 314. Gordy Rice claimed a mo
j nopoly of the scoring in this one
i by placing himself on the receiving
; end of both touchdown tosses. The
j first one was thrown by George
Little in the opening period, Dave
, Dahle heaving the other one with
three minuta* of the contest re-
I maining.
The Village gridders missed a
I scoring opportunity in the second
quarter when Dick David blocked
; an attempted punt by Little and
George Ellingson recovered on the
Ram five. They were further aided
■ by an unnecessary roughness pen
! alty which carried them half of the
i remaining distance to the goal line,
but four attempted running plays
were halted there by the Phi De'ts.
