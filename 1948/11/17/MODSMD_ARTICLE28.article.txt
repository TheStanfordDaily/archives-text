# Hoover Library Is Traditional Objective for Upstate Raiders
## 
### AL BERRY 
One night early this week, a carload of "wild, irresponsible
youths," presumably from an up-state educational institution,
sped onto the Stanford campus. Under cover of the darkness just
before dawn, the boys fearlessly painted the snake-like mono
gram of their school on the walls and steps of the campus's
msxel tmnMuniua Nuilrtincr Thou !

with a wild chortle of triumph they (
sped recklessly away into the night.
For nearly a decade now the
Hoovei War Memorial Library has j
stood as the number one target for j
the illiterate invaders from the !
north. The reason for this is easy to
ascertain. The tower's 285 feet of
steel and concrete is something no
other schools can match; something
of which the students of Leland
Stanford Junior University should
be very proud; and something of
which the invaders have always been
jealous.
From the Gl-square-foot concrete
base to the 300-watt, white painted
reflector light on the top, the
building is fireproof and earthquake
proof. It has a brilliantly concealed J
fire escape that stretches like • a
great backbone from the 14th floor '
observation platform to the ground.
Language is no barrier on the li
brary's shelves. These shelves, i
which take up a great deal of the '
building's 1.131,000 cubic feet of
space, contain over 100,000 books in
2G languages, 50.000 volumes of of
ficial publications of some 60 na- ■
tinns, and over 18.000 newspapers
and periodicals in 35 languages. At
present one of the outstanding col
lections in the library is on Germany
—Imperial, Republican, and Nazi;
another is tl*e Russian revolution
and Communism.
Contrary to the beliefs of the aver
age undergraduate, the library is in j
constant use. Many frustrated
freshmen have given up in disgust
after leceiving a cordial but not too i
successful welcome under the ro
tunda. Too few students fully real
ize that the library is not designed !
to care for the needs of under- !
graduates. The Hoover Library
serves the needs of graduate stu
dents of Stanford. University of
California and other nearby univer
sities. The Hoover Institute also has
carried on special research and in

struction programs financed by the
Army and Navy, the Rockefeller
Foundation and other such institu
tions. It is little wonder that the
undergrad gets little attention.
As a landmark alone, the Tower
is unsurpassed; it is taller than a
similar building, known distantly as
the Campo-nil. No other university
can claim the likes of it. But more
important than this, more important
than thg building's well-stocked ar
chives, is the purpose for which the
Hoover Library was dedicated.
On June 20. 194 L, Herbert Hoover
dedicated the library to a world
that was hungry for peace, but was
not destined to get it. He said:
"The purpose oi this institution is
to promote peace. Its records stand
as a challenge to those who pro
mote war. They should attract those
who search for peace. I therefore
dedicate this building to these pur
-1 oses."
