# Doodles Tops Card Raiders in Historic Big Game Pranks
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Of all the Big Game pranks
ever pulled, probably Ihe most
ingenious, fact or fiction, is the
one credited to Stanford's im
mortal Doodles Weaver.
It seems that the Cal boys
were doing an exceptionally good |
iob of guarding their campus one j
year, repulsing all the clever at- !
tacks of the Stanfordites.
Then Doodles entered the picture, j
Somehow he got hold of a lire i
engine, manned it with helmeted |
stooges, and set off for the Big "C" j
with sirens blaring and bells clang- !
ing. '
The Farm "firemen" flew into the i
Berkeley stronghold at 5 a.m. and
Cal blockades were thrown open to
let them pass. Doodles' red hair
fairly streamed as he tore for the
Big "C."
As they approached, Chief Weaver |
stopped the truck, gave his riders a :
signal, and in a matter of minutes,!
the Big "C" was a Big RED "C." |
Jumping back onto their "big red I
machine," the firemen were off for i
their Peninsula refuge.
The Red Sea
The explanation? Fabulous
Doodles had filled the truck's water
pumps with red paint instead of
water. His firemen merely manned
their pumps. Before the Cals were
wiser, the golden "C" was sprayed a
brilliant Stanford red.
There are more [actual accounts
of pre-Big Game antics during the
1820's which rivaled any of those
of Doodles and Company.
In those days the bonfires of both
schools were the chief targets of
ambitious raiders.
In '25, shortly after 6:30 on the
morning of Nov. 17, flames were seen
licking at the sides of the Stanford
bonfire. Abandoning any hope of
extinguishing the Cal-planned blaze,
students filed out to (he fire and held
j an impromptu rally, followed by the
building of another structure, not
20 feet away from the fiirst. which
was used at the regular rally.
In '22, airplanes manned by Cal
; pilots swooped low over the neatly
stacked wood pile and dropped
phosphorus bombs which luckily
failed to find their target, hitting
anywhere from 20 to 50 feet away
from the pyre.
Shifting to present-day connivery,
I the year 1946 is a milestone in the

minds of all true Stanford raiders.
In this year, with the inauguration
of the first post-war Big Game, ac
tivity during "Big" week soared to
new heights.
Anxious to blow off some four
years of pent-up steam (the Big
Game had not been played since
'42), both schools sent waves of com
batants across the Bay, armed with
paint brushes and gasoline.
Notable among the many Farm
frosh escapades that year was the
capture of some 18 Cal raiders.
Three, found carrying loaded guns,
were handed over to the police,
while the rest were confined in En
cina for 10 days. There, their heads
were shaved and painted with large
red "S" 's, and scotch-taped over the
♦op so the art work would not smear
Chain Gang
Capping off the incident, the un
lucky ones were chained together
and forced to parade around Quad,
singing Stanford songs and bowing
before Stanford women. Some of
these enemy raiders were unfor
tunate enough to have left wives
and midterms back in the hills of
Berkeley.
Last, year was a comparatively
quiet one on both campuses. The
Stanford,s painted the doors of a few
fraternities, and reddened the sta
dium ticket booths, while an un
known gang (thought to be Palo
Alto highschoolers) burned a big
"C" on Encina's front lawn.
In short, the colorful history of
Big Game pranks seems to have
proven one thing. Regardless of all
the agreements made by presidents
of the two schools involved, the
antics seem to survive and grow
even more original as the years pass.

known gang (thought to be Palo
Alto highschoolers) burned a big
"C" on Encina's front lawn.
In short, the colorful history of
Big Game pranks seems to have
proven one thing. Regardless of all
the agreements made by presidents
of the two schools involved, the
antics seem to survive and grow
even more original as the years pass.
Of all the Big Game pranks
ever pulled, probably Ihe most
ingenious, fact or fiction, is the
one credited to Stanford's im
mortal Doodles Weaver.
It seems that the Cal boys
were doing an exceptionally good |
iob of guarding their campus one j
year, repulsing all the clever at- !
tacks of the Stanfordites.
Then Doodles entered the picture, j
Somehow he got hold of a lire i
engine, manned it with helmeted |
stooges, and set off for the Big "C" j
with sirens blaring and bells clang- !
ing. '
The Farm "firemen" flew into the i
Berkeley stronghold at 5 a.m. and
Cal blockades were thrown open to
let them pass. Doodles' red hair
fairly streamed as he tore for the
Big "C."
As they approached, Chief Weaver |
stopped the truck, gave his riders a :
signal, and in a matter of minutes,!
the Big "C" was a Big RED "C." |
Jumping back onto their "big red I
machine," the firemen were off for i
their Peninsula refuge.
The Red Sea
The explanation? Fabulous
Doodles had filled the truck's water
pumps with red paint instead of
water. His firemen merely manned
their pumps. Before the Cals were
wiser, the golden "C" was sprayed a
brilliant Stanford red.
There are more [actual accounts
of pre-Big Game antics during the
1820's which rivaled any of those
of Doodles and Company.
In those days the bonfires of both
schools were the chief targets of
ambitious raiders.
In '25, shortly after 6:30 on the
morning of Nov. 17, flames were seen
licking at the sides of the Stanford
bonfire. Abandoning any hope of
extinguishing the Cal-planned blaze,
students filed out to (he fire and held
j an impromptu rally, followed by the
building of another structure, not
20 feet away from the fiirst. which
was used at the regular rally.
In '22, airplanes manned by Cal
; pilots swooped low over the neatly
stacked wood pile and dropped
phosphorus bombs which luckily
failed to find their target, hitting
anywhere from 20 to 50 feet away
from the pyre.
Shifting to present-day connivery,
I the year 1946 is a milestone in the

minds of all true Stanford raiders.
In this year, with the inauguration
of the first post-war Big Game, ac
tivity during "Big" week soared to
new heights.
Anxious to blow off some four
years of pent-up steam (the Big
Game had not been played since
'42), both schools sent waves of com
batants across the Bay, armed with
paint brushes and gasoline.
Notable among the many Farm
frosh escapades that year was the
capture of some 18 Cal raiders.
Three, found carrying loaded guns,
were handed over to the police,
while the rest were confined in En
cina for 10 days. There, their heads
were shaved and painted with large
red "S" 's, and scotch-taped over the
♦op so the art work would not smear
Chain Gang
Capping off the incident, the un
lucky ones were chained together
and forced to parade around Quad,
singing Stanford songs and bowing
before Stanford women. Some of
these enemy raiders were unfor
tunate enough to have left wives
and midterms back in the hills of
Berkeley.
Last, year was a comparatively
quiet one on both campuses. The
Stanford,s painted the doors of a few
fraternities, and reddened the sta
dium ticket booths, while an un
known gang (thought to be Palo
Alto highschoolers) burned a big
"C" on Encina's front lawn.

these enemy raiders were unfor
tunate enough to have left wives
and midterms back in the hills of
Berkeley.
Last, year was a comparatively
quiet one on both campuses. The
Stanford,s painted the doors of a few
fraternities, and reddened the sta
dium ticket booths, while an un
known gang (thought to be Palo
Alto highschoolers) burned a big
"C" on Encina's front lawn.
In short, the colorful history of
Big Game pranks seems to have
proven one thing. Regardless of all
the agreements made by presidents
of the two schools involved, the
antics seem to survive and grow
even more original as the years pass.
