# Viviane Romance Scores Again in Italian Film
## 
### AL BERRY 
Well, it's Romance time again
on the old Leland Stanford Jun
ior Farm.
Vicious, vivacious Viviane
Romance jiggles handsomely
across the great white screen once
more in a quaint tome somewhat
mysteriously called '"ihe Blood Red
Rose.'' Miss Romance is wonderful;
the cast is fair; the plot is daring;
and the Guild Theater will un
doubtedly make money.
Compared with "Carmen," "Blood
Red" falls short, if not on its face.
Compared with most of the other
masterpieces currently showing to
Bay Area patrons, "Blood Red" is
"The Birth of a Nation" all over
again.
Confusing But Roaring
The plot, while somewhat con
fusing to the average non-Italian
speaking American student, is roar
ing enough to keep the patron won
dering what the devil is going on.
Miss Romance first meets the audi
ence's greedy eye as a sweet, inno
cent country gal. Then very sud
denly things happen. Miss Ro
mance's sister, also a sweet, innoccnt

country j»al, is forced to entertain
an exceedingly playful group of sol
diers. (The folks are having a revo
lution—a la South America.) The
sister, for reasons not known to the
men, loses her mind, and Miss Ro

house for the amusement of the sol
diers.
In her homey, womanly way, she
goes out to destroy the leader of
tne revolution, whom she thinks has
been disrespectful with sis.
A Case of Seduction
By the time she discovers that she
is madly in love with "El Salvador."
the hero, he is forcibly seducing her
—much to the audience's delight.
With the exception of Miss Ro
mance's bouncing, pleasant blouses,
the flick's principal saving grace is
its ending. Most of the minor char
acters die, horribly crushed in spirit,
while Miss Romance and her un
satisfied boy friend live unhappily
ever after. The finale is well done
so the first-nighter will leave the
theater in a mood to tell his mother
to "Drop Dead."

while Miss Romance and her un
satisfied boy friend live unhappily
ever after. The finale is well done
so the first-nighter will leave the
theater in a mood to tell his mother
to "Drop Dead."
Well, it's Romance time again
on the old Leland Stanford Jun
ior Farm.
Vicious, vivacious Viviane
Romance jiggles handsomely
across the great white screen once
more in a quaint tome somewhat
mysteriously called '"ihe Blood Red
Rose.'' Miss Romance is wonderful;
the cast is fair; the plot is daring;
and the Guild Theater will un
doubtedly make money.
Compared with "Carmen," "Blood
Red" falls short, if not on its face.
Compared with most of the other
masterpieces currently showing to
Bay Area patrons, "Blood Red" is
"The Birth of a Nation" all over
again.
Confusing But Roaring
The plot, while somewhat con
fusing to the average non-Italian
speaking American student, is roar
ing enough to keep the patron won
dering what the devil is going on.
Miss Romance first meets the audi
ence's greedy eye as a sweet, inno
cent country gal. Then very sud
denly things happen. Miss Ro
mance's sister, also a sweet, innoccnt

country j»al, is forced to entertain
an exceedingly playful group of sol
diers. (The folks are having a revo
lution—a la South America.) The
sister, for reasons not known to the
men, loses her mind, and Miss Ro
iiiuitoe &ceivs> revenue uy opening a
house for the amusement of the sol
diers.
In her homey, womanly way, she
goes out to destroy the leader of
tne revolution, whom she thinks has
been disrespectful with sis.
A Case of Seduction
By the time she discovers that she
is madly in love with "El Salvador."
the hero, he is forcibly seducing her
—much to the audience's delight.
With the exception of Miss Ro
mance's bouncing, pleasant blouses,
the flick's principal saving grace is
its ending. Most of the minor char
acters die, horribly crushed in spirit,
while Miss Romance and her un
satisfied boy friend live unhappily
ever after. The finale is well done
so the first-nighter will leave the
theater in a mood to tell his mother
to "Drop Dead."
