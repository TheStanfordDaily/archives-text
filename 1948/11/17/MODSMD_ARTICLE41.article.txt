# American Gals Are Problem For Austrian
## 
### PAT FOSTER 
Joseph Weisinger, Austrian
scholarship student, finds him
self afraid of the American fe
male. He lists them as his major
problem of adjustment in this
now country.
"Austrian women are so much
more submissive. They have not the
independence of the American wom
en." he says. "Here the women do
everything the men do ... . they
go places alone, they smoke, they
swear, they drive cars .... they
even get caught for speeding! In
Europe the woman is considered in
ferior to the man. The man is sup
posed to protect her. Here the man
needs protection from her!"
It is understandable that Wei
singer might need a little protec
tion: his tall, broad-shouldered
frame, his keen gray eyes, his
firm masculine chin are all good
reasons. And this foreign scholar
ship student speaks better English
than most American students.
There is no obstacle to discover
ing his sense of humor and capac
ity for easy, agreeable conversa
tion. It iua> be that it takes an
Austrian to beat the Stanford ra
tio.
But while he feels the American
has a great deal more freedom so
cially than the European, Weisinger
thinks the European has greater
freedom academically.
"He is more on his own. It doesn't
matter so much what sources he
uses to get his information, just so
he gets it. He works and thinks
more independently. And I think he
works harder to get his BA degree,
not just to accumulate units."
Weisinger thinks that the Euro
pean students comes to college with
a better secondary preparation than
the American, and that this might
account for the fact that he can be
given more liberty in his college
studies.
This foreign student bad ex
pected a low morality level of so
rich a country as America. De
spite the fact that American wom
en get caught for speeding, he finds
our morality rate "exceptionally
high." and far above the level in
Europe, which is unspoiled by
luxury.
But there has been a moment
when Weisinger was sure he had
come to a decadent civilization. The
bewilderment, fear, and shock of
that moment he says he will never
quite forget.
"I had come with my Toyon room
mates to my first football game." he
relates. "All of a sudden the whole
side of the Stadium started yelling
at me to take off my clothes! I was
embarrassed and frightened to death
and sure that I was among a sav
age. barbarian people. How was I
to know you are expected to wear
white sweaters in the rooting sec
tion?"
