Several solicitors' report enve

are turned in it will be impossible
to give a final report on the re

Some off-campus donations have
been received this week, and those
persons who still intend to contrib
ute are to send their contributions
to Box 2488 or take them to the lIR
office between 4 and 5 p.m. A booth
will be at the Cellar from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. today to take donations.
