## Demerit Plan Issue 
### 
Several new developments have occurred this week on the
demerit plan legislation. The Daily editorial in Monday's issue
criticized the method of legislating the demerit plan by Women's
Council on the basis that the plan was a legislative measure that
should have been channeled through the Associated Women
Students organization, a legislative body.
Although the demerit plan is essentially a good plan, The Daily
maintains that the women's judicial body of student government
should have presented the plan to AWS for final vote on the
issue.
A special meeting of AWS was called yesterday to consider
The Daily's criticism. The organization approved the Women's
Council action because the "demerit plan is mere procedure, not
-policy." When any Women's Council measure is defined as
'procedural" under the ASSU Constitution, AWS has no jurisdic
tion in the matter. This definition was applied to the demerit
plan by the Council; therefore, AWS felt obliged to accept it
without question.
Today Samuel D. Thurman Jr., associate dean of the Law
School, will submit to Excom officers an interpretation of the
ASSU by-law concerning the powers of Women's Council. If the
demerit plan is defined as legislation by his interpretation, Ex
com and AWS have the power to set up penalties for social
.egulations.
Legally, Council is within its rights in formulating and in
setting up such social penalties in the absence of such action by
Fxcom or AWS. But Women's Council should have chosen the
easier way through AWS legislation, rather than through ex
treme use of its own delegated powers.
Would it be possible for Excom to refer the demerit plan to
AWS for that group's approval? Then, Council would not be
charged with the responsibility of a dangerous procedural prece
dent, which might very well be the basis for more extreme action
in the future.
