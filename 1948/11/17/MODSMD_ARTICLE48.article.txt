To the Editor:
The Associated Women Students Cabinet of Stanford University, con
sisting of the presidents of every separate women's living group, feel
that we have been misrepresented by an ill-informed Daily Editorial
Board.
We have been, and still are, in complete accord with the actions taken by
Women's Council on the Demerit System.
We are in agreement with Council's interpretation of the Constitution
that the demerit system is a system of penalties, and as such, is a rule of
procedure necessary for Council's orderly operation. This is consistent
with Council's interpretation of the ASSU Constitution since 1930.
The following is the method used by Council, with the assistance of
the Associated Women Students Cabinet, to inform the women students
oi the proposed demerit system:
1. Council met with individual area executive committees to discuss the
pioposed demerit system plan. —-
2. The plan was presented to AWS Cabinet on Oct. 7 and thence to
each individual women's residence.
3. AWS Cabinet made suggestions and corrections which were incor
porated by Council into a revised Demerit System.
4. Each house was informed that it was considered undesirable to insti
tute the demerit system until such time as the late bonus social regula
tion was abolished.
5. Each student was aware that in casting a vote to abolish the late
bonus scoial regulation, she was at the same time registering approval of
the proposed demerit system.
<». A written statement was presented to each house president, stating
that if the late bonus social regulation was voted out, it would not be
abolished until the demerit system went into effect.
7. AWS Cabinet, representing the individual members of their living
groups, voted 20-3 in favor of abolishing the late bonus social regulation
at a regular meeting on Thursday, Oct. 21.
8. On Wednesday, Nov. 3, Excom approved the minutes of the AWS
Cabinet, which recommended that they amend the by laws of the ASSU
Constitution by striking out the late bonus social regulation under Article
11-A, Women's Social Regulations, and ASSU Excom moved, seconded,
and carried out the following: "MSC (Pool) that Women's Council budget
be augmented by $200 to purchase the forms required for the new demerit
system." <
I). On Thursday, Nov. 11, Council informed AWS Cabinet that the neces
sary forms and equipment for operation of the demerit system were ready.
Council consulted with the chairmen of the judicial committees of the
residences at a meeting at which all were present to approve of a date
when the system should go into effect, and it was decided that the de
merit system would go into effect on the following Friday, Nov. 12.
lft. AWS Cabinet was prepared to co-operate with Council in relaying
this demreit system information to each women's residence at once.

To the Editor:
The Associated Women Students Cabinet of Stanford University, con
sisting of the presidents of every separate women's living group, feel
that we have been misrepresented by an ill-informed Daily Editorial
Board.
We have been, and still are, in complete accord with the actions taken by
Women's Council on the Demerit System.
We are in agreement with Council's interpretation of the Constitution
that the demerit system is a system of penalties, and as such, is a rule of
procedure necessary for Council's orderly operation. This is consistent
with Council's interpretation of the ASSU Constitution since 1930.
The following is the method used by Council, with the assistance of
the Associated Women Students Cabinet, to inform the women students
oi the proposed demerit system:
1. Council met with individual area executive committees to discuss the
pioposed demerit system plan. —-
