This year's traditional effort to
make the Blue C Jed is kid stuff
compared to a plan hatched by a
character from the Southland who
resided at Encina last year. In (his
lad's third-floor room were cached
some 20-odd sticks of dynamite, with

which he planned to make the Big '

Stanford relations, and the young j
chap afterward found reason to leave
the Farm.

mil tee ought to mark the doors bet
ter.
