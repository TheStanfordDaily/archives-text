Long may the teachers live. Al
most as long as the assignments
they give.
It has been proved that a stand
ard number two lead pencil will
make a single line over 33 miles
long before wearing out. The teach
ers just want us to get our money's
worth, that's all.
My teachers criticize me
And say I loaf and shirk.
I d do great things and show 'em,
Except it's too much work.
I seem to be having the same
trouble with my teachers this year
as I had last year. They just won't
teach me anything I want to learn.
But there is still hope for me.
Look at Cecil Rhodes. He was
forced to leave Oxford and go to
Africa for his health. He didn't get
to return and finish his studies till
years later — but in the meantime
he had become the multimillionaire
diamond king of the world. He did
all right.
Don't seo*n to be many who qual
ity for Rhodes scholars, however,
these day. . Or so thinks Professor
John Bei dan of Yale. He read a
particularly bad composition to his
English class and, as usual, called
for class comment. They tore it
apart.
"You are quite right. That theme
is incredibly bad." he said. "I spent
two hours of painstaking effort
making sure I hadn't left out one
feature of poor writing, and I think
I succeeded rather well. What as
tounds me is how you people can
dash these off day after day in 15
minutes." Well, genius is where
you find it, I always say. It just
comes natural to me.
But then some profs don't realize
how incredibly dull their lectures
are. It's been proven that only six
hours of continuous reading can be
done without evoking eye strain.
Ear strain would follow the same
ratio.
The Chicago Daily News has done
-omething constructive about the
whole problem. They have found
the causes that are tops among the
fiunkees:
(1) Students don't have the book
'earning ability essential in college
work; they can't learn from reading
their texts.
(2) Once they are free of super
vised high school study they are
'ost. They get behind and cr.n't
atch up again.
(3) Low ability students are ;d
-mitted to colleges because of de
ceptively hir»h senior high grades,
or easy courses, or parental or other
help.
(4) Their inability to concentrate
and read rapidly or well stops them.
(5) Emotional and family prob
'ems, ill health, and financial per
plexities all enter the picture, too.
But what's my excuse?
