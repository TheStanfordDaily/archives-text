# Tribute to the Czechs
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
In observing Students' Day this
year, along with students nil over
the world, it is well to remember
the reason for the celebration.
On the night of Nov. IG-17, 1939.
German occupation troops raided
Czech student homes in Prague, by
way of reprisals against *stuclent pa
triotic demonstrations on the Czech
national holiday, Oct. 28.
The Germans forced their way
into the various campuses, firing at
the students with submachine guns.
Then, they arrested, tortured, and
deported 2,000 students to concen
tration camps. Two hundred and
forty students, together with sev
eral University professors, were
summari'y executed. All Czech
universities and colleges were
closed "for three years." In fact,
they were not to reopen until the
liberation, in May, 1945.
Those Czech students of 1939 were
the first to protest against the Ger-

mans, .just a few
mont h s after
Hitler's legions
h a d scratched
their country
off the map of
Europe. Their
indomitable spir
it is still alive
among the i r
juniors, the
Prague students
of Febr u;»r v.

1948, who were the first in Czecho
slovakia to demonstrate against the
Moscow-sponsored Communist coup
the very week it occurred. Here
again, the challenge was met: Com
munist-controlled policemen fired at
them, killing one student, wounding
two, rounding up many others and
beating them with rifle butts and
clubs, in the streets or in police sta
tions.
As in the old days of the Austro-
Hungarian empire, as in the dark
•six years of Nazi conquest, the 600-
year - old Charles University in
Prague is paying heavily for its un
yielding resistance to foreign totali
tarian ideas. Half of its professors
have been dismissed since the
bloody days of February. All kinds
of pressure have been exerted to
compel the Czech students to join
the Communist party: bribes and
threats, reprisals on their parents,
expulsion from the University, de
portation and forced labor.
The foreigner- touring Prague in
1!)48 will not notice anything un
usua', though he may sense the
•) r e v a 1 en t uneasiness. Leaning
against the parapet of statue-dcco
ratcd Karlova bridge, he will stare

I at the Hradcany castle where (
: lived Roman emperors and BoU
j mian kings —and perhaps hew
think there is nothing more beauti
ful in all Europe. There, he v
dream of the glorious past of t
Czech nation, from Jan Hus
Anton Zizka who, in the 15th ci
| tury, fought and died for natioi
i independence, social equality, an
I religious freedom, to the gre;
I modern leaders and emancipator:
| Thomas Masaryk and Eduard B t
nes. And then, he will feel certai
j that Czechoslovakia, someti in e
| slow to rise against the oppressoi
I will find, sooner or later, new mil
| itant leaders. Bondage, rebellioi
! liberty, and bondage again—it is th
J eternal story of this small nation <
11.000.000.

Bohus Bones, nephew of the
former president of Czechoslo
vakia, will speak this afternoon
at 4:15 in Cubberley Auditorium
His talk, which is open to the
public, will he on educational
conditions in his homeland.

Walking down Vaclavske Na
mesti, Prague's leading and broad
est avenue, our tourist tries to foi
gel history and politics. Bypassin
once-famous restaurants where foe
is now strictly raitoned, meat an
fats very scarce, disregarding tl"
bare shop-windows, he will stop i
one of those crowded cafes whei
the Czechs enjoy a glass of "s'ivr
vice," their national drink, whi
the band plays Dvorak's "Hume
rcsque" or "Beer Barrel Polk;
which is the work of a humb
Czech composer, Jaromir Vejvod
Who would then doubt that this
Prague, the heart of Europe, wi
all its graceful, music-loving Sk
soul?
But Prague—or Praha, as the fo
eigner soon learns to say—does n
offer so many escapes. Back in tl
streets, he again becomes aware
a tragic past and present: here ai
there, at a doorway, in a street co
ner, or inside a multi - window*
arcade, nestles a little shrine
commemoration of someone who f<
in the anti-German uprising of Mi
5, 1945.
The inquietude of our time ai
pears even more clearly when fa
ing the repeated question: "Do y»
think there will be war?" And wi
the natural awe with which the
words are uttered, one can also pe
ceive "the Czechs' subconscious ho
that some decisive help from t
outside will come some day to li
crate them from the firmly e
trenched Communist regime whi
has enslaved their country.

The Germans forced their way

the students with submachine guns.
Then, they arrested, tortured, and
deported 2,000 students to concen

closed "for three years." In fact,

Walking down Vaclavske Na

est avenue, our tourist tries to foi
gel history and politics. Bypassin
once-famous restaurants where foe
is now strictly raitoned, meat an

bare shop-windows, he will stop i
one of those crowded cafes whei
the Czechs enjoy a glass of "s'ivr
vice," their national drink, whi
the band plays Dvorak's "Hume

which is the work of a humb
Czech composer, Jaromir Vejvod
Who would then doubt that this
Prague, the heart of Europe, wi
all its graceful, music-loving Sk
soul?
But Prague—or Praha, as the fo
eigner soon learns to say—does n
offer so many escapes. Back in tl
streets, he again becomes aware
a tragic past and present: here ai
there, at a doorway, in a street co
ner, or inside a multi - window*
arcade, nestles a little shrine
commemoration of someone who f<
in the anti-German uprising of Mi
5, 1945.
The inquietude of our time ai
pears even more clearly when fa
ing the repeated question: "Do y»
think there will be war?" And wi
the natural awe with which the
words are uttered, one can also pe
ceive "the Czechs' subconscious ho
that some decisive help from t
outside will come some day to li
crate them from the firmly e
trenched Communist regime whi
has enslaved their country.

In observing Students' Day this
year, along with students nil over
the world, it is well to remember
the reason for the celebration.
On the night of Nov. IG-17, 1939.
German occupation troops raided
Czech student homes in Prague, by
way of reprisals against *stuclent pa
triotic demonstrations on the Czech
national holiday, Oct. 28.
The Germans forced their way
into the various campuses, firing at
the students with submachine guns.
Then, they arrested, tortured, and
deported 2,000 students to concen
tration camps. Two hundred and
forty students, together with sev
eral University professors, were
summari'y executed. All Czech
universities and colleges were
closed "for three years." In fact,
they were not to reopen until the
liberation, in May, 1945.
Those Czech students of 1939 were
the first to protest against the Ger-

mans, .just a few
mont h s after
Hitler's legions
h a d scratched
their country
off the map of
Europe. Their
indomitable spir
it is still alive
among the i r
juniors, the
Prague students
of Febr u;»r v.

1948, who were the first in Czecho
slovakia to demonstrate against the
Moscow-sponsored Communist coup
the very week it occurred. Here
again, the challenge was met: Com
munist-controlled policemen fired at
them, killing one student, wounding
two, rounding up many others and
beating them with rifle butts and
clubs, in the streets or in police sta
tions.
As in the old days of the Austro-
Hungarian empire, as in the dark
•six years of Nazi conquest, the 600-
year - old Charles University in
Prague is paying heavily for its un
yielding resistance to foreign totali
tarian ideas. Half of its professors
have been dismissed since the
bloody days of February. All kinds
of pressure have been exerted to
compel the Czech students to join
the Communist party: bribes and
threats, reprisals on their parents,
expulsion from the University, de
portation and forced labor.
The foreigner- touring Prague in
1!)48 will not notice anything un
