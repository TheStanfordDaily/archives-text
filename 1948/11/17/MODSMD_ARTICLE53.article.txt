Honor Code, Fundamental Standard
To the Editor:
The Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard have been discuss
in recent meetings, and I feel there is a need for clarification betwt
the two systems.
1. Stanford has a Fundamental Standard which covers all phases
Stanford's life demanding a basic decency and high type of citizens!
on the part of all members of the student body.
2. In lfJ2l a strong movement with a majority of the students submitti
individual petitions requested the right to hfcve and to take the respon
bility for an Honor Code. This Honor Code was to eliminate procti
from examinations, and to put students on their honor in all matte
which might contribute to grades.
3. The Honor Code is now much more complete, with its commith
on exam files, faculty contact, orientation, and speakers bureau: but s
covers only academic work. Current social regulations, changes in soc
problems, third person responsibility under the Fundamental Standa
etc., etc., are very real and interesting problems and vital parts of 1
student life, but at the same time do not concern the smooth running
tiie Honor Code.
Any questions along this line should be addressed to me at the AS:
Office. Our Honor Code works well and is one of the most cherish
Stanford traditionsâ€”we do not think it right to use the Honor C<
as a club in non-academic affairs simply because of its apparent succ
within its field. Stanford people do have responsibilities for their cond -
Lut wherever violations do not pertain directly to the academic wo
they do not fall under the Honor Code.
