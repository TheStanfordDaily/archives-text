# Frosh Begin Work On Big Game Fire
## 
### 
The Class of '52 will begin construction of the Big
Game bonfire near the Boathouse this morning at 9,
according to Mick Hefter, chairman of the project.
"Every Frosh man is expected to work on the fire
except at the hours when he has classes. Without
perfect co-operation we will be unable to take ad
vantage of the large stockpile which we have built
up in past weeks," Hefter said.
The first trucks will leave Encina this morning at
9, and transportation to and from the fire will be avail
able throughout the day.
Some of the men will work in an all-day shuttle
of truckloads of wood from the storage point on
Jordan Field to Lake Lagunita. The rest will stack
wood on the bonfire.
The construction will continue through the night
and until it is completed tomorrow afternoon. Just
before the bonfire is lighted, it will be doused with
oil and kerosene.
'"We hope to have a large model of the Cal Cam
panile atop the fire," Hefter said. (It is rumored that
the model will resemble edifices found on farms and
near other residences not blessed with running water.)
