perating from behind an impressive desk in a quiet office

y Director, is not the figure many people picture a man in

of its kind in the country, but
that time it has become an im

old being the fust," he coin
ed. "is very hard to verify by
but in all these years no one

Greatest Thrill?
liking back over the years,
ndorfer finds it difficult to sin
ut one event as his greatest
as advance man for Stanford
ics. The 1940 football season
very high. The 1939 record
;d seven losses, one tie.and an
14 to 3 victory over Dart

remembers how one of his
s put it:"From the Mud Bowl
Dartmouth game was played
?p mire) to the Rose Bowl in
aar." Close behind in the thrill
tment was the stunning 26 to 0
of Army in 1928. It was
iid's first trip to the East, and
.vere '"complete underdogs."
Notes Athlete Shortage
eerning the topic of the pres
hletic scene, Liebendorfer ad
hat there is currently a defin
uipower shortage. This he at
primarily to the "three year
nforced holiday." He says that
hletic department, without by
l\ any conference regulation, is
ng up as rapidly as possible,
will take three to five years to
a real comeback. Football
iles which include seven coil-

i'erence games, Santa Clara, and
usually two tough intersectional op
ponents are not easy. For example,
in the near future, Michigan, Army,
and Harvard will reappear."
As lor a Big Game prediction, Lie
bendorfer warns, "Don't expect
lightning to strike twice. Cal is an
overwhelming favorite, and should
win by a decided margin, but in a
Big Game things can and do happen.
There is no reason why Stanford
couldn't score another upset, and
this time hold the victory. Never
discount that Stanford spirit—it's a
real factor."
