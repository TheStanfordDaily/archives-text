## RAIN FOR B.G? Rain Slows Grid Drills; Shaw OK 
### 
Stanford's varsity gridders drilled
under a light drizzle last night in
preparation for their Big Game
with the University of California
Saturday. The weather and the
workout may be described by one
word â€”sloppy.

Head Coach Marchie Schwartz
devoted pint of the session to
scrim maging against a blue-shii ted,
numberclad "California varsity."

On r>n adjoining field the first two
strings alternated in polishing up
some of the trickery that Schwartz
is expected to throw against the
Bears Saturday.

Missing from the session were
Tom Shaw and Rupe Andrews.
Shaw was admitted to the Palo Alto
Hospital Monday with an infected
heel, and Andrews was sidelined
with a pulled muscle. Both are ex
pected back today.

Schwartz named Saturday's start
ers as being Laakso and Rose at the
ends, White and Rau tackles, Roh
rer and Fix guards, and Castagnoli
center. In the backfield it will be
Devine at quarter. White and Tur
riziani at the halves, and Marty An
derson at full.
