### 
Big Game time is drawing nigh, the first set of odds have been posted,
and the gridders have but three more practices before they don their
suits for the last game of the 1948 season.
Over in the Berkeley camp the Waldorf followers seemingly ooze con
fidence as they debate whether they should agree to meet Oregon in a
play-off game to decide which team should go to the Rose Bowl. At first
glance it appears that the stage is set for another upset a la 1947.
But quite the reverse is true. Those Cal footballers, most of whom
were the object of the ridicule heaped upon the Cal team after it barely
won over a "weak" Stanford squad, are back and ready to atone for that
poor showing.
Cal Has St nil' to Win Big
Cal needs this win by a large score in the worst way. First, they must
win the game to rate the vote to the Rose Bowl. They seem to be assured
they can get the vote over Oregon even if both teams win Saturday.
Secondly, Cal is a "hungry" team. They are hungry for a win over
Stanford, a big one. They want to roll up a score so great that there
will be no doubt that Cal belongs in the Rose Bowl.
Cal has the material to roll up a big score this week. We of the Farm
might as well face it. But Cal had that power last year and was thwarted
by a scrappy Card team. The question, then, seems to be, "Can they do
it again?"
Marchie Schwartz is an honest man. Newspaper men like him because
he says what he thinks about games that are coming up. He generally
says that he thinks Stanford will win.
I do not know what Marchie will say at the rally tomorrow night. He
may come out and predict a win as he has done in the past weeks, but
I doubt it. Fie has said that Cal is too strong to meet head on, you have
to "gamble" to beat them. And that, in short, is just what the Indians will
huve to do—gamble.
Stanford has little to lose in this game and a lot to gain. You may see
the Stanford team do something that Stanford teams haven't done in years.
It they work, all will be fine: if they fail, there will be those who will say
that we might have won if we hadn't done such and such, etc,
Bears Not Overcoiili<lent This Time
In my book it will be a time for desperate measures. It isn't a cocky,
overconfident Cal team that is preparing for this game. It is a big, tough,
well-geared machine that tends to leave no doubt as to its efficiency.
Even The Daily's Peerless Pickers won't choose Stanford to win this game.
So, you who have watched Stanford's football fortunes rise arid fall
throughout the last three years, bear with the team this week. In the
light of cold, hard fact, they don't belong on the same field with Cal. They
don't believe that, 'and will be out there doing' their best for 60 minutes.
Let the rooters do the same.

Each week we receive a letter from the Pacific Coast Conference com
missioner's office. A Stanford alumnus. H. D. Thoreau. has been hard at
work preparing the statistics that say so much and yet so little.
I have been awaiting these letters with great anticipation for the past
seven weeks. Two Stanford men. Emery Mitchell and Bob White, have
been battling it out for top marks with about 20 other top backs in the
Conference.
Mitchell is still tenth in total offense, although he hasn't seen action ,
for two weeks. (He was in the Army game for but eight minutes.) White
is tied with Oregon's John McKay for fourth spot in the race for rushing
honors. Both have 447 yards, as compared with Jack Jenson who is in
first place with 840 yards. White could have gained in the race last week ;
but the quarterback insisted upon sending him through the middle when I
all the yardage was being made around the ends.
Now this race for statistic honors is strictly a sidelight to the overall
good of the team, but it is a shame that White couldn't have been al- I
lowed to pack the ball where everyone else was picking up yardage. Of j
course White still averaged 5.7 yards per carry. It has been a long time j
since Stanford could boast of a man in the top five runners of the Cor.- ;
ference.
Come On, Cal, Plav Ball

This writer would like to go on record right now as favoring a play-off
between California and Oregon, in the event both teams win their games |
this week. Of course, all this ialk of a play-off may be needless. Stan
ford or Oregon State could decide the whole thing. The man who scores !
the winning touchdown against Cal will be able to write his own ticket j
the next time he is in Oregon.
But the play-off is the only fair thing. We are wondering just how Al
Masters will vote if called upon to do so. Let's hope that the good faculty 1
representatives will keep politics out of it.
The talk about Cal footballers needing "more time to study" is a laugh. If |
the Bears get the vote they will be turning out in preparation for the
Bowl game anyway.

I doubt it. Fie has said that Cal is too strong to meet head on, you have
to "gamble" to beat them. And that, in short, is just what the Indians will
huve to do—gamble.
Stanford has little to lose in this game and a lot to gain. You may see
the Stanford team do something that Stanford teams haven't done in years.
It they work, all will be fine: if they fail, there will be those who will say
that we might have won if we hadn't done such and such, etc,
Bears Not Overcoiili<lent This Time
In my book it will be a time for desperate measures. It isn't a cocky,
overconfident Cal team that is preparing for this game. It is a big, tough,
well-geared machine that tends to leave no doubt as to its efficiency.
Even The Daily's Peerless Pickers won't choose Stanford to win this game.
So, you who have watched Stanford's football fortunes rise arid fall
throughout the last three years, bear with the team this week. In the
light of cold, hard fact, they don't belong on the same field with Cal. They
don't believe that, 'and will be out there doing' their best for 60 minutes.
Let the rooters do the same.

Each week we receive a letter from the Pacific Coast Conference com
missioner's office. A Stanford alumnus. H. D. Thoreau. has been hard at
work preparing the statistics that say so much and yet so little.
I have been awaiting these letters with great anticipation for the past
seven weeks. Two Stanford men. Emery Mitchell and Bob White, have
been battling it out for top marks with about 20 other top backs in the
Conference.
Mitchell is still tenth in total offense, although he hasn't seen action ,
for two weeks. (He was in the Army game for but eight minutes.) White
is tied with Oregon's John McKay for fourth spot in the race for rushing
honors. Both have 447 yards, as compared with Jack Jenson who is in
first place with 840 yards. White could have gained in the race last week ;
but the quarterback insisted upon sending him through the middle when I
all the yardage was being made around the ends.
Now this race for statistic honors is strictly a sidelight to the overall
good of the team, but it is a shame that White couldn't have been al- I
lowed to pack the ball where everyone else was picking up yardage. Of j
course White still averaged 5.7 yards per carry. It has been a long time j
since Stanford could boast of a man in the top five runners of the Cor.- ;
ference.
Come On, Cal, Plav Ball
rrrt •
This writer would like to go on record right now as favoring a play-off
between California and Oregon, in the event both teams win their games |
this week. Of course, all this ialk of a play-off may be needless. Stan
ford or Oregon State could decide the whole thing. The man who scores !
the winning touchdown against Cal will be able to write his own ticket j
the next time he is in Oregon.
But the play-off is the only fair thing. We are wondering just how Al
Masters will vote if called upon to do so. Let's hope that the good faculty 1
representatives will keep politics out of it.
The talk about Cal footballers needing "more time to study" is a laugh. If |
the Bears get the vote they will be turning out in preparation for the
Bowl game anyway.
Big Game time is drawing nigh, the first set of odds have been posted,
and the gridders have but three more practices before they don their
suits for the last game of the 1948 season.
Over in the Berkeley camp the Waldorf followers seemingly ooze con
fidence as they debate whether they should agree to meet Oregon in a
play-off game to decide which team should go to the Rose Bowl. At first
glance it appears that the stage is set for another upset a la 1947.
But quite the reverse is true. Those Cal footballers, most of whom
were the object of the ridicule heaped upon the Cal team after it barely
won over a "weak" Stanford squad, are back and ready to atone for that
poor showing.
Cal Has St nil' to Win Big
Cal needs this win by a large score in the worst way. First, they must
win the game to rate the vote to the Rose Bowl. They seem to be assured
they can get the vote over Oregon even if both teams win Saturday.
Secondly, Cal is a "hungry" team. They are hungry for a win over
Stanford, a big one. They want to roll up a score so great that there
will be no doubt that Cal belongs in the Rose Bowl.
Cal has the material to roll up a big score this week. We of the Farm
might as well face it. But Cal had that power last year and was thwarted
by a scrappy Card team. The question, then, seems to be, "Can they do
it again?"
Marchie Schwartz is an honest man. Newspaper men like him because
he says what he thinks about games that are coming up. He generally
says that he thinks Stanford will win.
I do not know what Marchie will say at the rally tomorrow night. He

Conference.
Mitchell is still tenth in total offense, although he hasn't seen action ,
for two weeks. (He was in the Army game for but eight minutes.) White
is tied with Oregon's John McKay for fourth spot in the race for rushing
honors. Both have 447 yards, as compared with Jack Jenson who is in
first place with 840 yards. White could have gained in the race last week ;
but the quarterback insisted upon sending him through the middle when I
all the yardage was being made around the ends.
Now this race for statistic honors is strictly a sidelight to the overall
good of the team, but it is a shame that White couldn't have been al- I
lowed to pack the ball where everyone else was picking up yardage. Of j
course White still averaged 5.7 yards per carry. It has been a long time j
since Stanford could boast of a man in the top five runners of the Cor.- ;
ference.
Come On, Cal, Plav Ball
rrrt •
This writer would like to go on record right now as favoring a play-off
between California and Oregon, in the event both teams win their games |
this week. Of course, all this ialk of a play-off may be needless. Stan
ford or Oregon State could decide the whole thing. The man who scores !
the winning touchdown against Cal will be able to write his own ticket j
the next time he is in Oregon.
But the play-off is the only fair thing. We are wondering just how Al
Masters will vote if called upon to do so. Let's hope that the good faculty 1
representatives will keep politics out of it.
The talk about Cal footballers needing "more time to study" is a laugh. If |
the Bears get the vote they will be turning out in preparation for the
Bowl game anyway.
Big Game time is drawing nigh, the first set of odds have been posted,
and the gridders have but three more practices before they don their
suits for the last game of the 1948 season.
Over in the Berkeley camp the Waldorf followers seemingly ooze con
fidence as they debate whether they should agree to meet Oregon in a
play-off game to decide which team should go to the Rose Bowl. At first
glance it appears that the stage is set for another upset a la 1947.
But quite the reverse is true. Those Cal footballers, most of whom
were the object of the ridicule heaped upon the Cal team after it barely
won over a "weak" Stanford squad, are back and ready to atone for that
poor showing.
Cal Has St nil' to Win Big
Cal needs this win by a large score in the worst way. First, they must
win the game to rate the vote to the Rose Bowl. They seem to be assured
they can get the vote over Oregon even if both teams win Saturday.
Secondly, Cal is a "hungry" team. They are hungry for a win over
Stanford, a big one. They want to roll up a score so great that there
will be no doubt that Cal belongs in the Rose Bowl.
Cal has the material to roll up a big score this week. We of the Farm
might as well face it. But Cal had that power last year and was thwarted
by a scrappy Card team. The question, then, seems to be, "Can they do
it again?"
Marchie Schwartz is an honest man. Newspaper men like him because
he says what he thinks about games that are coming up. He generally
says that he thinks Stanford will win.
I do not know what Marchie will say at the rally tomorrow night. He
may come out and predict a win as he has done in the past weeks, but
I doubt it. Fie has said that Cal is too strong to meet head on, you have
to "gamble" to beat them. And that, in short, is just what the Indians will
huve to do—gamble.
Stanford has little to lose in this game and a lot to gain. You may see
the Stanford team do something that Stanford teams haven't done in years.
It they work, all will be fine: if they fail, there will be those who will say
that we might have won if we hadn't done such and such, etc,
Bears Not Overcoiili<lent This Time
In my book it will be a time for desperate measures. It isn't a cocky,
overconfident Cal team that is preparing for this game. It is a big, tough,
well-geared machine that tends to leave no doubt as to its efficiency.
Even The Daily's Peerless Pickers won't choose Stanford to win this game.
So, you who have watched Stanford's football fortunes rise arid fall
throughout the last three years, bear with the team this week. In the
light of cold, hard fact, they don't belong on the same field with Cal. They
don't believe that, 'and will be out there doing' their best for 60 minutes.
Let the rooters do the same.

Each week we receive a letter from the Pacific Coast Conference com
missioner's office. A Stanford alumnus. H. D. Thoreau. has been hard at
work preparing the statistics that say so much and yet so little.
I have been awaiting these letters with great anticipation for the past
seven weeks. Two Stanford men. Emery Mitchell and Bob White, have
been battling it out for top marks with about 20 other top backs in the
Conference.
