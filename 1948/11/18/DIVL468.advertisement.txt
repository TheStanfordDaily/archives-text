THE SPACE
LOCK-UP
So you kept her out past lock-up?
And it's happened twice before?
And they gave her three demerits!
Will it happen any more?
Three demerits—tisk—tisk—tisk.
—Her college life is blighted.
And you can never sleep at night,
Until this wrong is righted.
Moral
If you get caught in heavy traffic
And your fenders fill of dents;
If your lassie misses lock-up, i
Take her to LCNGBARN to re
compents.
—Sue Stanbery
Need we say more!
