Two important ASSU by-laws were passed by Excom last
night. The first by-law concerns Men's and or Women's Coun
cils' power to create a system of penalties.
The new by-law states that except in cases where there is
provision for the establishment of penalties by the University,

Excom, or an ASSU
board, Council for Student Control,
or its divisions, may establish ap
propriate penalties, based on prece
dent, for student violations of Uni- j
versity or ASSU rules, regulations, !
and by-laws.
Excom passed the by-law after it j
had been notified of the legal in
terpretation of the ASSU Constitu- i
tion that said:
"AWS has the power to make
rules to assure the effective admin- j
istration and enforcement" of the '

by-laws of the Associated Students
as specifically affecting women stu
dents.
Both Men's and Women's Coun
cils have been setting up both pen
alties and judgments for many
years. The legal interpretation,
however, pointed out the need for
making provision for the establish
ment of penalty systems. The by
law, then, will fill the penalty sys
tem gap created by yesterday's in
terpretation, and the two Councils
will continue to act as they have
in past years.
Excom approved the conduct of
Women's Council and AWS be
cause the two groups have been
fulfilling their functions in good
faith in the absence of a clear defi
nition of their constitutional pow
ers.
Excom's second important by-law
will enforce the social procedures
for on- or off-campus social func
tions. A maximum penalty system
was set up for violation of he by
law, which follows:
' 'Failure to comply with any of
the social regulations may be pe
nalized by the cancellation of the
date in question, or of any future
dates, by action of Executive Com
mittee and/or by social probation

for the organization as such, a fine
on the organization totaling not
more than $5 per member, or (if
a men's organization) by not more
than 10 hours of labor on each ac
tive member of the organization by
action of the Council for Student
Control or the appropriate division
thereof.''
By-law infractions will be judged
by the Council for Student Control
or the appropriate divisions. The
by-law will take effect next Wed
nesday. Most flagrant violations in
social procedures in past quarters
have occurred when organizations
failed to get Excom approval of
dates for their social program.

Women's Council and AWS be
cause the two groups have been
fulfilling their functions in good
faith in the absence of a clear defi
nition of their constitutional pow
ers.
Excom's second important by-law
will enforce the social procedures
for on- or off-campus social func
tions. A maximum penalty system
was set up for violation of he by
law, which follows:
' 'Failure to comply with any of
the social regulations may be pe
nalized by the cancellation of the
date in question, or of any future
dates, by action of Executive Com
mittee and/or by social probation

for the organization as such, a fine
on the organization totaling not
more than $5 per member, or (if
a men's organization) by not more
than 10 hours of labor on each ac
tive member of the organization by
action of the Council for Student
Control or the appropriate division
thereof.''
By-law infractions will be judged
by the Council for Student Control
or the appropriate divisions. The
by-law will take effect next Wed
nesday. Most flagrant violations in
social procedures in past quarters
have occurred when organizations
failed to get Excom approval of
dates for their social program.
Two important ASSU by-laws were passed by Excom last
night. The first by-law concerns Men's and or Women's Coun
cils' power to create a system of penalties.
The new by-law states that except in cases where there is
provision for the establishment of penalties by the University,

Excom, or an ASSU
board, Council for Student Control,
or its divisions, may establish ap
propriate penalties, based on prece
dent, for student violations of Uni- j
versity or ASSU rules, regulations, !
and by-laws.
Excom passed the by-law after it j
had been notified of the legal in
terpretation of the ASSU Constitu- i
tion that said:
"AWS has the power to make
rules to assure the effective admin- j
istration and enforcement" of the '

by-laws of the Associated Students
as specifically affecting women stu
dents.
Both Men's and Women's Coun
cils have been setting up both pen
alties and judgments for many
years. The legal interpretation,
however, pointed out the need for
making provision for the establish
ment of penalty systems. The by
law, then, will fill the penalty sys
tem gap created by yesterday's in
terpretation, and the two Councils
will continue to act as they have
in past years.
