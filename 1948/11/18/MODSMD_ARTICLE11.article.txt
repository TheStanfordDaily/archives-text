### 
Bohus Benes, former Czechoslo
vak ian consul in San Francisco,
yesterday affirmed the loyalty of
the Czech students to the principles
of freedom and democracy in an
address in observance of Interna
tional Students' Day at Stanford.
Dr. Benes, nephew of the late
president of Czechoslovakia, Eduard
Benes, is presently teaching con
temporary European history at San
Francisco State College. He re
signed as consul on the death of his
uncle, in protest against the Com
munist regime in his country.
"The Czechoslovakian students
will never give up," he said. ''They
always will be optimistic that free
dom will return."
In spite of persecution and re
straints, 75 per cent of the students
are against Communism. On'.y one

professor at Charles University is
an avowed Bolshevik.
"Czechoslovakia prides itself in
electing its leaders from the intelli
gentsia of Charles University. Dic
tators attack the university first to
eliminate the source ot potential
leaders," he said.
"The Russians have sent students
to work in the coal mines. In 1939
the Nazis killed over 200 students,
and sent thousands of others to
work camps." It was in memory of
this massacre that International
Students' Day was founded in 1940,
Benes stated.
