# Debaters Contest Taft-Hartley Act
## 
### 
In their first intercollegiate
home-rand-home debate this quar
ter, the Stanford Debating Society
met the University of San Francisco
yesterday.
Debating the question, ''Resolved,
that the Taft-Hartley Law is prov
ing beneficial for labor and man
agement relations," the society's af
firmative squad, made up of Forden
Athearn and Byron Leydeckcr, met
William Duffy and Eugene Gart
land of USF here, while the nega
tive team of Peter Slusser and
Robert Mclnerny traveled to San
Francisco to meet affirmative
speakers Joseph Ginsfre and Frank
Donahue.
Speaking for the affirmative, Ley
decker and Athearn presented re
spectively the main points of the
law itself, and the effects it has
produced since passed. Athearn
said the act has reduced strikes and
that, since its enactment, the work
ers of the country have reached
their highest standard of living and
employment level.
On the negative side, Duffy said
that the act gave more power to
management than labor. He said
that, in many cases, the govern
ment stepped in where local ac
tion could have and was doing the
job.
His partner, Gartland, brought
out the opinion that the law's (30-
day cooling-off period served only
to further the cause of management,
ruling out the possibility of a union
strike during a strategic produc
tion period.
