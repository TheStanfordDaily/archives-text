# Poll Favors UMT Plan
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Do you like or dislike the proposed Universal Military Training
Plan as has been proposed by some government and military
leaders? Nearly 49 per cent of Stanford students asked this ques
tion in a recent Daily poll said they liked the plan. While 36.3
per cent of students interviewed disliked the plan, a large block

'of '"don't know" responses (15 per
cent were tallied).
The UMT question has been dis
cussed in political and military cir
cles for nearly a year as a possible
method of military training that
could replace the current draft
legislation.
UMT would provide training for
the country's 19-year-olds as they
graduated from high school.
Student opinion in the Stanford
survey on UMT varied from "UMT
will break up the educational train
ing of too many men," to "Why con
tinue the draft and endanger the
chances of many young men from
settling down in permanent jobs?"
According to the survey, more
Farm women favor UMT than do
Roughs. Percentage breakdowns for
the two sexes follow:
Per cent Per cent
Men Women
Like 47.1 51.3
Dislike 38.8 30.U
Don't know ... 14.1 17.8
Since the "don't know" figure is
so large, if it were possible to put
the question up to a popular vote,
and if most of the undecided element
voted against the plan, UMT would
' be defeated.
