# BONUS SYSTEM IN EFFECT
## 
### 
The demerit system is not in
effect now, nor lias it ever been
in effect, because it was not
passed through AWS, according
to Dean Samuel D. Thurman's
interpretation of the ASSU by
law concerning powers of AWS
and Women's Council.
All women's social violations
will continue to be considered
under the present bonus system.
The bonus system was reinstated
last night, and it will continue to
be in effect until the demerit sys
tem is passed by vole of the AWS
Cabinet and AWS minutes are
approved by Excom.
