# Fresh Nationalist Fighters Reported in Suchow Battle
## 
### 
NANKING, Nov. 17 (AP) —China's high command, asserting
the Communists already have lost 90,000 men, sent fresh armies
into the battle of Suchow today.
The nightly communigue of the defense ministry claimed
more than half the Communist veterans who mounted the major

assault east of Suchow had been
killed or wounded.
(On the other hand, the Commu
nist radio said nine government di
visions were "wiped out," including
the 63rd and 107 th armies. That
could be 90,000 men. Both sides are
inclined to exaggerate casualties.)
Most Chinese sources doubted
that the Suchow "victory" was all
the newspapers said it was.
But it appeared Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-Shek's forces in the
opening phase of the fateful battle
at least held their own with some
of the best troops in the Communist
armies.
They did it with the surprise use
of a tank column and all-out sup
port from the air force. War planes
flew shuttle from Nanking, 200
miles to the south, bombing and
strafing.
Both sides are gathering strength
for the second phase.
Afternoon newspapers said troops
under Gen. Liu Ju-Ming, moving
north from the Nanking area, had
joined ""units attacking the Commu
nists who have encircled Suhsien,
50 miles south of Suchow.
This is a sensitive point. Suhsien
lies on the railway connecting Su
chow with Nanking. The Commu
nists are supposed to hold 30 miles
of the line. The loss of Suhsien
(which the Communists say they
have taken) would be a serious blow
to government hopes of recovering
the railway.
