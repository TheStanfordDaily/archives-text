# Gaieties Gay As Ram's Head Scores, Bores
## 
### 
The curtain went up three times,
there was a blast of bugles, a sigh
from the orchestra pit, and the Big
Game Gaieties started kicking its
merry way around the Mem Aud's
acoustics.
The Gaieties zipped to its highest
peaks when it was being gay; it
was only when the Ram's Head
producers strove for nostalgia or
sentimental settings that the audi
ence looked collectively at their
watches.
Far and away the best tunc in the
was a bouncing number called
"'The Whole World Is a Carnival."
It was sung by the entire cast, and
although a bit disorganized, it could
well have been a pretty good theme
for the show. The audience was
elated, and the cast seemed to have
a terrific time delivering it.
Hal Todd bounced through the
revue in a series of characteriza
tions that left no doubt as to the
star performer in the show. Allen
Fletcher's dead pan rates a close
second.
High comic—or musical or dra
matic—spot in the second act and
the show was the Hollywood take
off "We Oughta Be in Pictures."
The boys really knocked themselves
out for a few minutes to score the
'oudest laughs in the evening.
Things the Gaieties could do
without: the makeup man, "I'll
Never Say," "He's Not My Kind,"
and so much "Angel Gas." —A 1
