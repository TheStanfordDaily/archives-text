# SAE's Guilty Of Breaking Rushing Rules
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Board of
Control Tuesday evening found the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
guilty of illegal rushing on Nov. 13.
A party, held off campus and ar
ranged by the SAE's, was attended
by members of the fraternity and
by certain invited freshman men.
This constitutes a direct violation
of the rushing rule prohibiting "so
cial contact"' between Row men
and freshmen prior to the formal
rushing season.
Both the fraternity and the fresh
men were held accountable for
their actions. The penalty imposed
on the SAE fraternity is as follows:
SAE rushing and formal pledg
ing privileges have been canceled
until autumn quarter, 1949. No
man who is not now living or
boarding at the SAE house will
be allowed to live or board there
until autumn quarter, 1950.
Appropriate penalties for the
freshmen who attended the party
are still under consideration.
In an interview yesterday, Ted
Le Vino, president of the Interfra
ternity Council and Board of Con
trol, told The Daily, "This year we
have set out from the start of the
quarter to make everyone thor
oughly acquainted with the rules.
The IFC has worked hard to im
prove, clarify, and publicize the
rules. The IFB is working equally
hard to investigate and consider
any and all reported violations.*'
