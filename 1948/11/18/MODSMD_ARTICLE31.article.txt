Perhaps we didn't make our point clear in regard to partisan
political speakers on campus—if the two letters printed below
are any indication.
On the face of it. having partisan political speakers on campus
seems reasonable enough. And we'd be glad to consider it if
Ihe matter were put forth sincerely. But the only group which has
consistently plugged for it is the Wallace group, the Young Pro
gressives. (And one of their leaders admitted there were never
more than 30 people in attendance at their meetings, even the
one where they served free beer).
The embarrassment that would accrue to the University as a
result of having partisan political speakers on campus is not
imagined. Since Stanford is a private institution, such appear
ance would seem to be an endorsement by the University.
And suppose a rally were held for Wallace or some other
partisan speaker. If a crowd of 100 gathered, by present stand
ards of inaccurate reporting by big city papers, the affair would
be reported something like this: "1,000 Stanford students roared
approval today as Henry Wallace attacked . . . ." (And you can
be sure that Henry would be attacking something or someone).
The Young Progressives argue for "politics in practice," or
'practical politics." After evidencing "practical" politics in the
recent presidential campaign, we can't see any reason for appear
ance of partisan speakers on campus. It would just be an un
necessary disturbance.
In Detroit the President of the United States told laborers they'd
be starving and out of jobs if they didn't vote Democratic. In
the San loaquin Valley, Truman told his audience, "You have a
uerrible congressman." Wallace made only one point in his cam
paign: everything Russia does is wonderful; everything the
United States does is wrong.
And that's "practical" politics.
