To the Editor:
Several years at Stanford have taught me that it is useless to expect
anything of merit from The Daily, but it is a profound shock to me to
see the editors resort to personal abuse as an ally to their own incompe
tence.
Your "Politics in Practice" is a new low in editorial responsibility. By
what right do you stoop to name-calling? By what right do you assume
to know what the Young Progressives "really have up their sleeves?"
IVhat evidence justifies your remark that their "real motives are purely
selfish?" Are you God? The letter of the Young Progressives . . . etc., etc.
