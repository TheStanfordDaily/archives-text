# Politics Is Business of Many
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I am certain that the editors of The Daily and the students at Stanford
will grant that the Stanford Young Progressives had a good point in their
.letter, when they maintained that "politics is the business of the many and
not the few" and that "students have a right to political training"—which
mean "pracice as well as theory." If the argument is sound, some method
must be found for satisfying the need.
A solution to the problem need not involve the appearance of Stanford
endorsement for any political group nor the addition of undue prestige
:o any such partisan group—two things of which The Daily seemed much
afraid. A possible alternative would be to organize a non-partisan political
group on campus whose job would be the arrangement of on-campus
multi-party programs—discussions and the like—through a co-ordination
of off-campus political organizations representing the major parties.
