# AWS Is Hardly Representative
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The AWS letter to the editor stated, "AWS Cabinet, representing the
individual members of their living groups, voted in favor of abolishing
the late bonus social regulations." How can AWS accurately reflect the
women's opinions when:
1. AWS is far from being a representative body, having only one repre
sentative per house. Little Casa Espariola with 14 women is as decisive
in AWS as Branner (183) or Roble (245).
2. It was announced at first that there was to be a poll of the girls,
and now that poll has conveniently been construed to be a valid vote.
How many girls were afraid to "vote," when they had to defend their
negative stand, as happened over at Roble.
When the girls can vote independently and freely, the results will be
reliable.
