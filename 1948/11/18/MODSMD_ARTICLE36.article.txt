A baby sitter might be defined as
one who accepts hush money. You
know — silence without violence,
sort of. Personally, my dad always
claimed there was nothing better for
some boys than a pat on the back—
if it's delivered often enough, hard
enough, and low enough.
Nowadays a sitter has to be a
nurse, doctor, teacher, cook, psy
chologist, laundress, and playmate.
Time marches on ... . and time,
it seems, changes everything—except
diapers. Even the fairy tale era for
the children has hit the skids. These
kids don't believe in the three bears
any more. They know what's going
on in the world. It's like one child
of my acquaintance says, "What
have the bees and flowers got to do
with it? 1 was born in the winter."
Ohi. they still like to hear about
Jack and the Beanstalk, but they
know it is strictly ofT the cob. The
Wild West, travel, and sea stories
are the going thing now. The cause
might be all these sea stories daddy
tells them to get them into bed. And
guess who is usually the hero!
Snow Job
But did you ever sit in on a day
described as "cloudy with continued
rain'' and answer the little . . . .
dar'ings questions? .... like: "Why
is water wet? What color is a
pound? Why does everybody have
bones in theirselves? Why are bub
bles round? Would the sun be so
bright if it had to shine in the night
time?"
Now I'll ask one. Just what makes
you think you're so smart, daddy,
because you're in college? No man
realizes how little he knows until
his children get old enough to start
answering questions.
School Cop
That is the way they learn. A cop
on school patrol asked a young five
year-old how he liked school. "Don't
like it," was the answer. "Well,
why?" persisted the surprised Irish
mick. "Aw, all they do is play in
a sandpile. I can do that at home."
And 18-month-old Lawrence Phil
lips Jr. of Springfield, Mass., put
aside such childhood things and
switched to smoking cigars. He has
one in the morning and one before
his afternoon nap, and his mother
swears they have no ill effect upon
him. Yep, they're learning. Next
it'll be women.
A Time On My Hands
Some kids don't need a sitter, they
need a referee. It's like one mother
told her new housekeeper, as she
took off for the hairdressers, "And
about every 10 minutes put your
head out the door and yell, 'No, no.
Junior, don't do that'."
A University of Minnesota profes
sor believes that too much baby sit
ting is a social evil and a cause of
child neglect. Dr. James Bender,
head of the National Institute of Hu
man Relations, backs him up by say
ing that there are 10 per cent more
nervous babies than before the war
and more are getting that way aft
the time. A large part of the blame
is laid to the teen-age jitter-sitters
who let the radio blare le jazz hot
and call in the gang for a session.
Drive-in Movies
Drive-in movies have been one
boon to parents to combat this. They
have hit pay dirt in their appealing
to the families with children. And
they are going all out to get the
families in. One Ohio chain pro
vides milk warmers, has nurses, and
a children's playground sunken be
low the level of the screen.
Another boon is the radio-con
trolled baby-sitter that has been in
vented by Major F. L. Wood of Seat
tle, which enables one sitter to
tend several children at the same
time. His procedure is to place a
microphone near the crib of each
baby to be watched and" to con
nect it with an amplifier in his own
home. Each amplifier is labeled
with the name of the baby being
watched.
In each home he also places an
alarm clock near the amplifier. If
the ticking stops, he knows there
is simething wrong with that am
plifier. If a baby whimpers, the
sL.er dashes over and provides the
necessary first aid. He's sitting
pretty!
