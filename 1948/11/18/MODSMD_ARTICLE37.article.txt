# Britain Leaves It to George
## 
### AL ALLEN 
It is a matter of personal opinion
whether the solution to Britain's
post-war economic plight lay along
Churchillian lines or the socialistic
policies of the Labor party. Wheth
er the Conservatives could have
progressed farther along the road
to recovery had they been re-elect
ed in 1945 is a question no one can
answer.
The situation in Britain has
changed radically in the past three
years, and even the staunchest To
ries have come to accept, if not ap
prove, the nationalization of essen
tial industries and other Labor pol
icies. For good or bad, the die has
been cast.
An outcome which to date has
been largely overlooked is the
change in attitude of the English
people since 1939. The peculiar
frame of mind of the majority of
Britishers today appears to be best
described in the phrase "Let George
do it." It is a feeling in which res
ignation, lethargy, disillusionment,
and -cynicism are present in inde
terminable amounts.
Carry-over from War
It is, perhaps, a carry-over from
the wartime attitude of the private
soldier—lost in the cold, immense
bureaucracy of the Army he grudg
ingly performs his alloted task
while being only too willing to pass
the responsibility and the blame to
higher levels of administration.
Realizing that action is called for,
a shrug of the shoulders passes the
buck along to the dimly defined
George—the other guy, whoever he
may be.
The sluggishness of British in

dustry since 1945. the low output
per man hour, may be partly ex
plained by the British worker's
tendency to "let George do it." The
British people responded nobly to
Churchill's promise of "blood, sweat
and tears" when the Luftwaffe
hammered at the stubborn island
but it was a burden to be borne
only to the war s end. Too many
Englishmen expected the Britain of
1039 to rise, phoenix-like, from the
rubble of bombed cities and tours
when the last shot of the war was
fired. Since August, 1945, blood
has been spilled ignobly by the
British in Palestine, sweat has been
conspicuously absent, and the tears
have been those of self-pity.
Resent U.S. Position
That Englishmen should resent
the United States taking over the
position of a great power recently
vacated by Britain is but human
and understandable. That this re
sentment should take the form of
efforts to rig the sterling system in
the hope of obtaining something for
nothing from the United States is
shortsighted and reprehensible. As
a lesser power Britain must cut her
cloth to suit her pocket—and her
price. The United States has proved
itself willing to advise and hc!p. but
it is straining the bonds of friend
ship beyond endurance to expcct
the American taxpayer to pick up
the check for British recovery.
There is little doubt that Britain's
economic condition can be im
proved during the next few years—
but only if the responsibility of na
tional welfare is shouldered by in
dividual British subjects rather
than the mythical "George."

years, and even the staunchest To
ries have come to accept, if not ap
prove, the nationalization of essen
tial industries and other Labor pol
icies. For good or bad, the die has
been cast.
An outcome which to date has
been largely overlooked is the
change in attitude of the English
people since 1939. The peculiar
frame of mind of the majority of
Britishers today appears to be best
described in the phrase "Let George
do it." It is a feeling in which res
ignation, lethargy, disillusionment,
and -cynicism are present in inde
terminable amounts.
Carry-over from War
It is, perhaps, a carry-over from
the wartime attitude of the private
soldier—lost in the cold, immense
bureaucracy of the Army he grudg
ingly performs his alloted task
while being only too willing to pass
the responsibility and the blame to
higher levels of administration.
Realizing that action is called for,
a shrug of the shoulders passes the
buck along to the dimly defined
George—the other guy, whoever he
may be.
The sluggishness of British in

dustry since 1945. the low output
per man hour, may be partly ex
plained by the British worker's
tendency to "let George do it." The
British people responded nobly to
Churchill's promise of "blood, sweat
and tears" when the Luftwaffe
hammered at the stubborn island
but it was a burden to be borne
only to the war s end. Too many
Englishmen expected the Britain of
1039 to rise, phoenix-like, from the
rubble of bombed cities and tours
when the last shot of the war was
fired. Since August, 1945, blood
has been spilled ignobly by the
British in Palestine, sweat has been
conspicuously absent, and the tears
have been those of self-pity.
Resent U.S. Position
That Englishmen should resent
the United States taking over the
position of a great power recently
vacated by Britain is but human
and understandable. That this re
sentment should take the form of
efforts to rig the sterling system in
the hope of obtaining something for
nothing from the United States is
shortsighted and reprehensible. As
a lesser power Britain must cut her
cloth to suit her pocket—and her
price. The United States has proved
itself willing to advise and hc!p. but
it is straining the bonds of friend
ship beyond endurance to expcct
the American taxpayer to pick up
the check for British recovery.
There is little doubt that Britain's
economic condition can be im
proved during the next few years—
but only if the responsibility of na
tional welfare is shouldered by in
dividual British subjects rather
than the mythical "George."
It is a matter of personal opinion
whether the solution to Britain's
post-war economic plight lay along
Churchillian lines or the socialistic
policies of the Labor party. Wheth
er the Conservatives could have
progressed farther along the road
to recovery had they been re-elect
ed in 1945 is a question no one can
answer.
