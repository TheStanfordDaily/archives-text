If my calendar with the dancing girls on it is correct, we are rapidly
apioaching that time of the year when the department stores' begin to
warn us that there are only about 30 shoplifting days left until Christmas.
And il my time schedule (with the dancing girls on it) is correct, Stan-

lord students do not finish fall quarter until the 18th
of December. Since Christmas is still December 25—it
was the last time I was thrown out of the Orphans'
Christmas Party—this leaves roughly sevqn days for
us to do our shopping.
The dubious point of this rather wordy foolishness
is that I am about to solve for you that old problem
of what to buy your family for Christmas. Hearken
to these pearls of wisdom.
Father: The main thought in old pater's mind about
this time of the year is "Howinthehell am I going to
pay all the bills that mother has run up?" It is your

duty to ease his mind of this subject. Buy him a copy of that new book
of poems on how to pay your Christmas bills, entitled: "Ode to Various
Department Stores." I'm not quite sure of the publisher. It's either Ran
dom House or Poor House.
Mother: Mother is probably reaching that time of life when she wants to
become a little bit more cultured. If she still thinks "Henry the Fifth"
is a bottle of bourbon, now is the time for you to surprise her with some
literature that will give her a feeling of confidence when she travels in
cultured circles. I'd suggest something like "The Bobsey Twins at Re
form School."
Sister: Ah. good old sis. We all know there's no use buying her any
thing but clothes, so here are a few suggestions along those lines. Why
not buy her a pair of slacks, and then watch her beam! Or perhaps a
swimming suit. And don't tell me it's the wrong time of year for a
swimming suit. 1 know a guy who just bought his wife a two-piece bathing
suit so he could sing "I'll Be Seeing You, in All the Old Familiar Places."
Junior: Now this is a real problem. What can we get for little fester
head? How about an illustrated book of birds? He has undoubtedly
got the brain for it. On second thought, let's make it a package of gun
powder disguised as toothpaste. As long as he's going to shoot his mouth
of! all the time, he might as well do it with your powder.

Sister: Ah. good old sis. We all know there's no use buying her any
thing but clothes, so here are a few suggestions along those lines. Why
not buy her a pair of slacks, and then watch her beam! Or perhaps a
swimming suit. And don't tell me it's the wrong time of year for a
swimming suit. 1 know a guy who just bought his wife a two-piece bathing
suit so he could sing "I'll Be Seeing You, in All the Old Familiar Places."
Junior: Now this is a real problem. What can we get for little fester
head? How about an illustrated book of birds? He has undoubtedly
got the brain for it. On second thought, let's make it a package of gun
powder disguised as toothpaste. As long as he's going to shoot his mouth
of! all the time, he might as well do it with your powder.

If my calendar with the dancing girls on it is correct, we are rapidly
apioaching that time of the year when the department stores' begin to
warn us that there are only about 30 shoplifting days left until Christmas.
And il my time schedule (with the dancing girls on it) is correct, Stan-

lord students do not finish fall quarter until the 18th
of December. Since Christmas is still December 25—it
was the last time I was thrown out of the Orphans'
Christmas Party—this leaves roughly sevqn days for
us to do our shopping.
The dubious point of this rather wordy foolishness
is that I am about to solve for you that old problem
of what to buy your family for Christmas. Hearken
to these pearls of wisdom.
Father: The main thought in old pater's mind about
this time of the year is "Howinthehell am I going to
pay all the bills that mother has run up?" It is your

duty to ease his mind of this subject. Buy him a copy of that new book
of poems on how to pay your Christmas bills, entitled: "Ode to Various
Department Stores." I'm not quite sure of the publisher. It's either Ran
dom House or Poor House.
Mother: Mother is probably reaching that time of life when she wants to
become a little bit more cultured. If she still thinks "Henry the Fifth"
is a bottle of bourbon, now is the time for you to surprise her with some
literature that will give her a feeling of confidence when she travels in
cultured circles. I'd suggest something like "The Bobsey Twins at Re
form School."
