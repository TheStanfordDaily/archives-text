WINE, WOMEN ANI) WORDS, by
Billy Rose (Simon and Schuster).
Illustrated by Salvador Dali.
This is just about the kind of a
book that anyone might expect a
j master showman to write. And |
i Kose, like all good impresarios, is
, making certain that the reader gets
a good show. He includes a little
I biography, a few character sketches
i (and he really writes about "char
> acters"). and various amusing sto- 1
i l ies and meditations. To make sure !
that the book has entertainment
i value for the whole family he has
| added the final touch of the ec
centric Dali.
The humor ranges from Joe Mil
| ler stories to realistic comedy; how
' ever, the humor is never very
subtle. The character sketches are
I perfect. There are sidelights on
1 many prominent men, all extroverts,
such as Jimmy Durante and others. 1
There are also stories of the small, ;
! unknown eccentrics such as the
man who had two close compan- i
ions, a pigmy with a pointed head
, and an ape, whom he always de

scribes us "muh pal."
His work ranges from the Bath
tub soliloquy which is a collection
of Rose's random thoughts to the
chapter entitled "Move Over, de
Maupassant," which represents his
attempt at creative writing. Taken
as a whole, the book is about as
brash and garish as a Billy Rose
stage production. Rose seems to
want to invade every field of "cul
ture in his career. Only the field
ot art has he left to someone else.
He has turned the job of illustrating
over to the Billy Rose of the art
world. For once, the drawings of
Dali seem to have found an appro
priate use.
As a literary contribution to pos
terity, this book is most certainly
doomed to a very ephemeral popu
larity. Still, as light, clever writing
it can certainly be enjoyable. It is
the work of a man who is a com
plete and unabashed extrovert, and.
if accepted as such, makes pretty
good, light reading. It is interesting
by the mere fact that it is a literary
curiosity.â€” Priscilla Claudius
