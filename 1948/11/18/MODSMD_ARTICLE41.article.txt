# Farm Discovery Explains Sterility
## 
### 
A Stanford professor and his re
search assistant presented a theory
yesterday that may someday ex
plain a wide variety of human ills
ranging from sterility to rheuma
tism.
Dr. Jay Percy Baumberger of the
physiology department and Naomi
Fried, a research assistant, discov
ered the new hypothesis. They em
phasized that their explanation is
still strictly in the theory stage, but
that many bodily ailments may be
due to a never-ending battle in the
body between two simple but in
compatible chemicals, magnesium
and citrate.
Because most of the necessary
chemicals and structures are pres
ent in the area of fertilization, the
greater part of the work has been
concerned with the fertilization
process.
