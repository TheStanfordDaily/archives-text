# In the Court of the Beloved Oak

### 
For months I've been think
ing. planning, dreaming about
Big Game, and now here it
is! Like all women, I've been
spending my spare time . . ,
and class time too . . . think
ing about what to wear on
this all-important day.
Moseying about the Clothes
Closet yesterday, I found a
beautiful answer to my prob
lem: a softly tailored Hart,
Schaffner & Marx suit in
brown gabardine! Tall as I
am and short as you may be,
this is still the suit to have
for it comes in a three size
range . . . petite, regular, and
tall.
Parading through the arch
way, admiring myself in the
mirrors, I came to a table of
I use ions 100'< cashmere short
sleeved sweaters. My budget
said "that's for me" at the
S9.!)5 price tag! My II. S & M
suit said "that's for me" at a
flamingo-colored beauty.
Then Mebs called "this is
for you" from the hat bal
cony above ... a flamingo
felt cloche with brown silk
jersey trim and feather bird.
And like that little bird. I'd
better fly!
