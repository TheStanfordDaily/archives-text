# Farm Trophy Room Houses Debate Cup, Sport Pennants
## 
### 
Stanford's trophy room in the
Men's Gym probably houses
more interesting souvenirs of
Stanford's former greatness
than any other spot on campus.
The estimated 130 trophies in the
room range in value from the $500
W. R. Hearst Debating Cup won
from the University of California in
1903, 1904, and 1905, to a number
of small pennants and ribbons prob
ably of sentimental value.
The value of the trophies is esti
mated at $6,500. according to Miss
Eunice Du Prau, secretary to Di
rector of Athletics A 1 Masters.
Of some interest these days is the
$500 trophy awarded to Stanford by
the City of San Francisco for their
26 to 0 victory over Army in 1928.
All-Americans
Sports trophies seem to predomi
nate and the names run like an ath
letic hall of fame. An Ail-American
plaque attests to the fact that four
Stanford footballers had achieved
Ail-American fame by 1928. and lists
them as J. W. Lawson, '24; Ernest
Novers, '25; C. E. Shipkey, '26; and
Seraphim Post, '28.
Nevers also is represented by
photos, newspaper clippings, and by
two autographed baseballs, each of
which is inscribed, "Ernie Nevers,
Home-run ball—Stanford-California
series, 1925."
Old Photos
Some of the mementos go back to
1892 and include fencing, swimming,
handball, soccer, tennis, track, and

even free-goal shooting. Sepia pic
tures of early teams show athletes
sitting stiffly erect, their hair parted
in the center, looking for all the
world like sports men of distinction.
A large, faded Stanford pennant
is draped near the ceiling, and across
the room between the heavily barred
windows hangs a large, red banner
inscribed, "Presented by Mrs. Le
land Stanford, 1892."
Admission to the room is gained
by use of a special key obtainable
at the gym store in the Men's Gym.

letic hall of fame. An Ail-American
plaque attests to the fact that four
Stanford footballers had achieved
Ail-American fame by 1928. and lists
them as J. W. Lawson, '24; Ernest
Novers, '25; C. E. Shipkey, '26; and
Seraphim Post, '28.
Nevers also is represented by
photos, newspaper clippings, and by
two autographed baseballs, each of
which is inscribed, "Ernie Nevers,
Home-run ball—Stanford-California
series, 1925."
Old Photos
Some of the mementos go back to
1892 and include fencing, swimming,
handball, soccer, tennis, track, and

even free-goal shooting. Sepia pic
tures of early teams show athletes
sitting stiffly erect, their hair parted
in the center, looking for all the
world like sports men of distinction.
A large, faded Stanford pennant
is draped near the ceiling, and across
the room between the heavily barred
windows hangs a large, red banner
inscribed, "Presented by Mrs. Le
land Stanford, 1892."
Admission to the room is gained
by use of a special key obtainable
at the gym store in the Men's Gym.

Stanford's trophy room in the
Men's Gym probably houses
more interesting souvenirs of
Stanford's former greatness
than any other spot on campus.
The estimated 130 trophies in the
room range in value from the $500
W. R. Hearst Debating Cup won
from the University of California in
1903, 1904, and 1905, to a number
of small pennants and ribbons prob
ably of sentimental value.
The value of the trophies is esti
mated at $6,500. according to Miss
Eunice Du Prau, secretary to Di
rector of Athletics A 1 Masters.
Of some interest these days is the
$500 trophy awarded to Stanford by
the City of San Francisco for their
26 to 0 victory over Army in 1928.
