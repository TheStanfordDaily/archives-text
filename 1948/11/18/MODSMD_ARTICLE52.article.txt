Just how much longer is Montana State University going to masquerade
under the disguise of Pacific Coast Conference competition? That's ;
question that's been asked before. It'll be asked again. But, to date
no one who could ha.s. attempted to answer it.
To hear tell, Stanford's "battle" with Montana in the Stadium wa
to have been a critical game for the Indians. Not that there was mucl
danger that Stanford would lose to the oft-beaten Grizzlies. The Card
were favored by a wide margin. But the contest was to have been ;
progress report on Stanford's new offense. It was to have been an indi
cation of whether or not the Indians had the goods to beat Californi;
without Emery Mitchell.
As it was, the game produced only bitterness on the part of the K.00<
spectators who were unlucky enough to see it.
The Grizzlies were so generally inept at blocking and tackling tha
the score could have gone to three figures if the two teams hadn't gon.
into their you-take it-I-don't-want-it kicking act in the second half.
The Cards.couldn't learn anything on offense, and they were denied the
opportunity for a defensive workout. A good scrimmage with the JV;
would have been more valuable.
Grizzlies a Sorry Lot
The Montanans were in such poor shape that the clock had to be stopper
after every other play to allow one of them to be carried off the field. Si
plays later the injured man would be back in the lineup. Some of th
players were helped off two or three times. It was sickening.
Granted, this is a lean year up at the Missoula campus. But the fa'
ones haven't been much better.
In 24 years the Silvershirts have won only 13 Conference games while
losing 96. Ten of these 13 wins have been over Idaho. In short, Mon
tana ha.s had 24 years to build itself up to PCC caliber. It hasn't buil
up anything but the win columns of its opponents. A league can be jut
strong as its component parts. If one of the members is perpetually weak
the whole conference suffers.
The strength of the Big Nine, the Ivy League, the Southwest Conference
and half a dozen others, lies in the fact that any team is apt to list
up and knock e>ff any other tejam on any Saturday. There are no tradi
tional conference doormats. Not so in the PCC.
And looking at the other side of it, we fail to see how the PCC is doinf
Montana any good. The Grizzlies can't get more than one game a yea
with a California school. Even the northern schools, with the exceptioi
oi Idaho, won t se'hedule Montana oftener than once every other yeai
The long traveling distances and November snowstorms keep every lean
but Washington State and Idaho out of Missoula's undersized Dornblase
Stadium.
Saturday s Game a Financial linst
Financially, sending an undermanned traveling squad to Palo Alto ;
play before 82,000 empty seats can t do them much good either. And th
Montanans admit that their share of Rose Bowl and radio contract pro
ceeds are negligible when it comes to paying the bills.
According to Doug Fessenden, Montana's Athletic Director and Hea
Football Coach, "The PCC relationship is at the present time extremel
valuable because it provides scheduling possibilities that we could n<

otherwise substitute."
How so? Montana plays no con
ferenee basketball or baseball. Par
l ticipation in spring sports is re
| strictcd to sending token teams t
Northern Division track and go
i meets.
There are other leagues that th
Grizzlies e-ould hook up with th;
! would allow Montana to participat
I on an equal basis in all spen t
Either the Skyline Conference e
the Rocky Mountain Conferent
j should be right up the Grizzlie
1 alleyâ€”competitively and geograph
! ically.
