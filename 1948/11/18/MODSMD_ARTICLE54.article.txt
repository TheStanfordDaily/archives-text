# Shaw, Andrews Fit for Bears
## 
### 
The lights of the enclosed prac
tice Held were turned on for the
second night in a row yesterday as
the Stanford gridders continued
their all-out effort to brew up some
surprises to spring on the Cal Bear
when the two teams meet Saturday.
The Schwartzmen got in a good
two-and-a-half-hour practice. The
coach alternated teams of men
against the dummy offense of the
California pretenders — the blue
clad jayvees. While one team was
getting a view of the Bear plays,
two other outfits ran through Card
plays.
Two men who had missed the
practices so far this week were out
for work yesterday. Quarterback
Tom Shaw, who had been sent to
the hospital because of an infected
foot, seemed to be ready to go as
did Rupe Andrews. Andrews had
been sidelined with a pulled mus
cle. He ran without pads.
With these two men back on the
ready-for-action list, the Cards will
be near top strength. Emery Mitch
ell, of course, is in the hospital after
having an operation on his knee.
It is doubtful if the ace fullback
will even be able to watch the
•»ame from the sidelines.
Though he is listed as a starter,
tackle A 1 Rau is far from being in
top shape. He saw no action last
week because of an elbow injury
received in the Army game. He
will be handicapped with the same
injury this week.
Another tackle, Atherton Phleger,
is also troubled with an injury.
Phleger broke his thumb in a scrim
mage last week and, though he
played in the Montana game, he
will be in far from top form Sat
urday.
