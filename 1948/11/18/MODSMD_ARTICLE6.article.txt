# Frosh Men Urged to Do Part In Building Big Game Bonfire
## 
### 
A last-minute plea was made last
night urging complete eo-operation
of the freshman men in building
the Big Game Bonfire today by
Miek Hefter, chairman of the proj
ect.
"Today is the last chance we have
to make this year's bonfire a credit
to the Class of '52, and every fresh
man man is needed to finish the
job properly," Hefter said.
Last night about one-tenth of the
wood had been stacked on the bon
fire. At that time approximately 20
men were working.
Trucks will leave Encina early
this morning, and about 1 this af
ternoon. If it is not possible for
freshmen to secure transportation
to the site of the fire, Hefter asks
that they walk.
Coffee and doughnuts will be
served to the workers by Roble
women.
