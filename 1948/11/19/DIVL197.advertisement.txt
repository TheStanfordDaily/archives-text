I just can't study any more
'cause I'm so excited about
tomorrow, about Biff Game—
you know, that game where
the Stanford Indians an? go
ing to BEAT Cal! But the
excitement won't stop there
because the eveuing promises
to be a gay one.
When you dress for that
very special San Francisco
date (late leaves extended to
3:30 for this occasion) youll
want to be the very piate of
fashion, and that means you
won't feel complete without |
an oh -so - dressy sparkling
black hat that fairly shouts of
the greatness of this occasion.
Jet and fine net, sparkles of
all kinds, veils, ostrich feath
ers, open crowns — yes, the
Clothes Closet lias the hat for
mi. the cocktail hat for this
and all those other "out of
the ordinary" dates that
Thanksgivin' and Christmas
will offer. Come see the hat
nixA in t*«e ha'-nny. We'll be
looking fcv you!

P.S. The Clothes Closet is
at 520 Ramon a near liwm
sity—just look for the big oak
tree.
