## 
### 
Two Aeronca Chief airplanes, pi
loted and manned by four Stanford
pilots flew over Berkeley and the
University of California at noon to
day and dropped 50,000 Big Game
leaflets on the Campus.
Th». raid was the second major
leaflet bombardment in two years
Indians have made on the Cal cam
pus. Thousands of the University's
students poured out of their class
rooms to watch Pilots Allen Bletz
and Lorry Lokey with their bom
bardiers Irving Deal and Jim Thur
ber, circle over the campus for 15
minutes at an altitude of 1.000 to
1,300 feet.
While two of the flyers—Bletz and
Lokey—piloted the two light planes,
Deal and Thurber dropped hand
fulls of 1,500 leaflets over the Berke
ley-Cal area. By the time the raid
had ended, the clouds of leaflets
had pockmarked nearly every block
in the area with Indian propaganda.
Leaflets taunted the Cal Bears
with:
California Bear
Had um lucky stroke.
Fortunate for him
Injun arrow broke.
This moon it shall never break
Mangy Bear will burn at stake.
Financial support for the raid
came from nearly all of the Farm's
fraternities. Last year's raid aLso
received heavy support from the
Row houses. The 1947 leaflets
threatened:
California Bear thought um had
career
Until got Injun arrow
In um royal rear.
DROP DEAD CAL!!
Both the 1947 and 1948 leaflets
were printed in large red letters.
