### JIM HAGGART 
The Stanford Indians will sweep
■ Cal's Golden Bear off his feet to
morrow in the Big Game with an
inspired will to win if last night's
rally is indicative.
A crowd of more than 5,000 people
gathered before the Boathouse to
; participate in the thundering rally,
led by Head Cheer Leader Tom Elke
and the Band.
The Big Red Machine was greeted
with a tremendous ovation when
it appeared on the stage. Marty An
derson promised the crowd on his
i own part and in behalf of co-captain
I Emery Mitchell that the team will
carry the fight to Cal all the way.
Marty Anderson
"We aren't looking for more first
| downs—We aren't interested in a
moral victory—We're going into the
game to get a scoreboard victory."
Following a brief entertainment by
Dean Borba, Big Jim Reynolds
warned the rooters that neither
team will go into the contest an
1 underdog or a favorite, and that ''the
! Stanford spirit will go far in de
termining the outcome."
Coach Marchie Schwartz said that
1 the team was not afraid of Cal—
"They've played bovs over 21 before
this season .... We'll be out for a

win."
As the rally came to a close with
the Axe Yell and the hymn, the
first aerial bombs o! the fireworks
j demonstration lit the sky.
The crowd encircling the bonfire
was driven back by the intense heat
as fiames enveloped "the Campanile"
atop the pyre and licked skyward
to a distance of more than 200 feet.
So bright was the fire that the sil
very wings of planes flying thou
sands of feet above the inferno
could be seen.
As the flames died away, the
crowd trudged toward home. Each
of them must have been convinced
j that Stanford's invincible spirit
j would carry the team far at Berke
| ley tomorrow.
