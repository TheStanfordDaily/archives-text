# PAPPY TESTIFIES
## Bears Respect Indian Team 
### JOHN BREIER 
"We respect Stanford's football j
team and the tradition behind the j
Big Game. Last year's 21 to 18 j
score did little to minimize that re- j
spect." So spoke Lynn (Pappy) j
Waldorf, coach of the University of
California football team.
The statement came in answer to
a question concerning the attitude
of the Cal football players to the I
coming Big Game with Stanford,
with a possible Rose Bowl bid as
a reward for winning the contest.
Stanford Respected
"We're thinking only of the Stan
ford game. It would be an insult
to Stanford and a mistake on our
part to look over this game in favor
of any post-season contests. Maybe

Oregon can overlook their opponent
this week, but we certainly cannot,"
the big man added.
"Pappy" said that his scouts have
told him that Stanford has a host
of fast, able halfbacks. "Actually,"
he said, "you folks have more able
bail carriers than do we."
Card Line Improvement
"Stanford's line has improved im
mensely—and we had trouble with
that line last year," Waldorf
warned. He said that he had been
afraid of the 1947 game before it
ever came around. "We had a lot
more cripples then—John Graves,
Jon Baker, Russ Boh'.ke. Jack Swa
ner, and Ted Kenfield were all hurt;
we are a lot better off this year.
Waldorf said that it was hard to
compare his present Cal team with
other squads of his coaching career.
"Time and distance." he said, "make
it difficult to compare the teams,
but I will say that this team is a
good" team. If they get over Stan
ford this week, after being under
pressure of a winning streak for
nine games, I'll move that 'good' up
a couple of notches."
