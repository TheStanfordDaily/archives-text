## 
### 
DETROIT, Nov. 18 (/P).â€”Heavy
weight champion Joe Louis came
home today with a little patch ovei
his left eye but his handlers wen
quick to say it's nothing bad enough
to keep him from filling a six-round
exhibition here Friday against Vein
Mitchell at Olympia.
An old cut over Louis' eye was
reopened lasl night by Jimmy Biv
irs in a Cleveland exhibition, but
the champ said it would not keep
him from the rest of his tour, which
takes him to St. Louis for the next
stop Nov. 23.
