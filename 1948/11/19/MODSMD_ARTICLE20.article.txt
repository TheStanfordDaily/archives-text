# PCC Could End In Two-Way Tie
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 18 (/P).â€”
Pacific Coast Conference football
winds up its league schedule this
Saturday. And it may toss one of
the most controversial subjects in
the 33-year history of the circuit
into the laps of the ten faculty ah
letic representatives who must se
lect the Rose Bowl team.
California and Oregon must con
quer their final opponents to fan
this controversy into fullest flame.
The blazes already have been set,
such as Oregon's challenge to Cali
fornia for a post-season play-off in
case of a two-way conference tie,
and California's rejection of the
idea.
At Berkeley, the California Bears
I will be charging against Stanford
J in the hopes of tacking up an un
j blemished record, six league wins
| and four outside. The Oregon
Ducks, beaten only by the nation's
| top team, Michigan, will be wing
ing for their seventh conference
victory in a finale against Oregon
State.
The two conference leaders rate
j pre-game favoritism over their re
j spective rivals. Oregon's job looks
the tougher. The Ducks will be
playing on Oregon State's home lot
at Corvallis, a psychological ad
j vantage.
j California takes on a Stanford
I squad which hardly appears equip
| ped to rise to the inspirational
j heights necessary to beat such a
formidable opponent. The Bears
j have the depth in material by great
odds; possess a harder - hitting
ground attack and a big bulge in
punting. Stanford, which lost its
fullback mainstay and backfield
punch in Emery Mitchell two weeks
ago, may still come up with a pass
ing game superior to the Bears.
In other conference finishers,
Southern California figures to out
score the University of California
at Los Angeles, and Idaho rates
even with Washington.
Luckless Montana hopes to close
out the season with a win over vis
iting North Dakota. Washington
State, back at East Lansing, prob
ably will take a thumping from
Michigan State.
