# Pickers Take Cal by 12
## 
### 
The peerless pickers are all out
this Week. They've got to hit all
twenty to get over that prized .800
mark, and that's exactly what they
plan to do. As a starter, the Scribes
are tabbing Cal over Stanford by
12 points. We hope we're wrong.
If we are, we'll tear up the picks
and start building for next year.
Our other prognostications in
clude:
Washington over Idaho by 12. The
Spuds may surprise.
SMU over Baylor by 13. Doak
Walker rides again.
Boston College over St. Mary's
by 7. The Gaels are in tough
company.
Princeton over Dartmouth by 1.
Could go either way.
Harvard over Yale by 7. Another
traditional.
Northwestern over Illinois by 13.
The Wildcats move west.
Purdue over Indiana by 7.
Oklahoma over Kansas by 3.
Tennessee over Kentucky by 14.
