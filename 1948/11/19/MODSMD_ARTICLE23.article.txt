# Cal Raider Nabbed at Bonfire, Shaved While World Listens
## 
### 
KSU became a bonafide barber
shop last night, much to the dismay
of a captured Cal student who had
plans to set oft the Big Game bon
iire prematurely yesterday after
noon. Over a special campus-wide
hook-up last night, Frosh President
Jack White and Station Manager
Steve Phillips gave the Cal man a
free shaveâ€”all over.
"Buz," the Berkcleyite, was ap
prehended when he and three other
Cal men were noticed traipsing
oiiscpiciously near the bonfire struc
ture in the Lake.
When asked for their student body
cards, the students tried to pose for
Menlo J.C. graduates. Claude Rosen
berg, captain of the Frosh Guard,
demanded identification from "Buz,"
the spokesman for the group. A
bulge in his hip pocket proved to be
a phosphorus bomb intended for the
fire. He was surrounded by frosh
guardsmen and the other three Cal

men made a get-away in a waiting
ear.
Before the KSU-sponsored bar
bering, "Buz" was treated to dinner,
the Stanford rally, and bonfire activ
ities. He wanted to sing "The Golden
Bear" at the rally kut found Stan
ford words different from his version.
Later he said he was very impressed
with the Indian spirit.
The well-timed shearing replaced
KSU's scheduled program at 10:45
p.m., "Strange Music," with White
and Phillips officiating with sheep
shears. Rosenberg gave Stanford au
diences a clip-by-clip description as
"Buz" was asked whether or not he
wanted sideburns. After exactly fif
teen minutesof cutting-time, Buz was
still better off than most of his fel
low captives. The barbers left a
"little hair" because the Cal man had
a Big Game date pending.
"We would have had a pretty good
chance 01 burning the fire if the other

guys hadn't escaped," said Buz dur
ing the program. He had traveled
Southward to Stanford with the
others in retaliation of a rumored
Indian raid upon the Campanile.
After spending the short night in
Encina, the Bear, minus his shaggy
mane, was sent home to enjoy his
own Big Game activities.
