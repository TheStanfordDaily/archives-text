### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16 (A*).—
Santa Claus probably won't find
any snow in downtown Los Angeles
but he will find what is claimed to
be the largest Christmas tree ever
cut in the United States.
The tree —more than 80 feet high
--was selected by the National For
est Service for the Los Angeles
Downtown Business Men's Associ
ation.
The white fir was felled today in
Angeles National Forest, 7,200 feet
above the Mojave Desert. The same
trucking company which moved the
giant 200-inch telescope lens up to
Mt. Palomar started this afternoon
to move the tree to downtown Per
shing Square 50 miles away.
