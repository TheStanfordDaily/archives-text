Three recommendations from So
j cial Regulations Committee were
1 presented to the AWS Cabinet yes-

' chairman of the Social Regulations
' Committee.
The regulations, which will be
i voted on at house meetings Mon
, day night, are as follows:
I 1. Al! late leave flpaters other
j than automatic weekend floaters
I may be taken any time during the
I quarter. (This applies especially to
; freshman women who at present
j may take only one floater in a
: single week.)
2. Late leaves will no longer be
affected by academic standing; thus
j women who go minus will still re
i ceive the same number of late
leaves as their total number of units
! entitles them to.
3. Floaters may be taken as over
nights during the week without
Council's permission.
AWS also passed two by-laws
which were proposed by the Vot
ing Procedures Committee at last
week's meeting. They are:
By-law 1. AWS Cabinet shall
take a numerical vote on major
issues concerning the women stu
dents of Stanford University. The
AWS Advisory Board shall desig
nate such a vote and submit ballots
and tally sheets to each living
group. The issue in order to pass
must receive a two-thirds majority
vote of those voting.
By-law two recommends that
house presidents report completely
to AWS Cabinet the majority and
minority opinions of their houses.
