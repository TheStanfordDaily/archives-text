# Cal Wins Another Close Game
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
California 7, Stanford 6. Who'da thought it?
Who would have thought that the big toe of "auto
matic" Jim Cullom would, for the second year in a
row, cheat Stanford out of a ball game that it had
been favored to lose by more than 20 points?
And after Stanford's touchdown early in the third
quarter it was this same Mr. Cullom who deflected
Aubrey Devine's attempted conversion. Although
low, the kick was straight, and it might have been
good if the big tackle hadn't touched it.
You could say Cal won by a hand and foot Sat
urday.
The contest was amazingly similar to last year's
Big Game which the Bears won by the margin of
Jim Cullom's three points after touchdown.
The Cards were never ahead Saturday and Cali
fornia didn't have to pull it put with a desperation pass
in the closing minutes, but that was the only major
deviation from the script.
The Bears took the ball on Stanford's opening

kickoff, and didn't relinquish it until they had scored
a touchdown. With fullback Jack Jensen, a great play
er Saturday, doing most of the heavy work, the
Golden Bears reeled off three successive first downs
to the Card 7. Two plays later Jack Swaner piled
over right tackle for his eleventh touchdown of the
year. Cullom converted, and Cal led 7 to 0.
It took the Bears just 11 plays and 5 minutes to ac
complish their score. Like last year when the Bears
tallied in three minutes on 7 plays, the Berkeley Ex
press acted just exactly the irresistible force that
everyone said it was.
Poor Stanford. Those G to 1 odds looked just about
right.
But the Indians doggedly stuck to the script. The
rest of the game belonged to Stanford. The enormous
California rooting section didn't have another good
chance to yell all afternoon.
The last 55 minutes were played in Cal's back
yard. Many of California's impressive 312 yards
gained were made driving toward the 50-yard line.

The Bears got down as far as Stanford's 25 a couple
times in the last quarter, but the attacks bogged down
when Erickson and Celeri started throwing passes
when they should have called runs.
In the second quarter halfback Billy Main scored
from 35 yards out, but his run was called back be
cause of an illegal use of hands penalty. Main started
to his right, saw he was going to be hemmed in, cut
back over center and went all the way to the goal
line behind some good blocking. The whole thing
went for naught as Jensen was detected holding an
Indian defender.
That was all for California. Now let's take a look
at what the Indians did.
The heads-up Stanford team got a break in the
first quarter when Cal's defensive center Stormy
Hileman accidentally touched Ken Roses rolling punt.
Guard Bob Rohrer pounced on the elusive oval and
it was Staniord first and ten on the Cal 37.
A 1 Turxiziani swept around left end for five
yards. Bob White cut over right tackle for four more, and Marty An
derson made a first down with two yards at right end.
White got seven on a quick opener through left guard, Turriziani made
two, and Marty Anderson added two more for what looked like another
:irst down. But Jim Castagnoli was caught holding, and the Indians were
■penalized back to the 30. Devine then pitched a beauty down the center to
Turriziani who ran to a first down on the California 8 yard line.
The Stanford's got clear down to the two yard line, but couldn't move
any further. Aubrey Devine's fourth down pass went wild, and Cal took
over.
With two minutes left in the second quarter defensive left half Dave
Field made a one-handed pickoff of one of Celeri's passes and behind some
fine blocking from Ken Rose and Whit Budge ran up the sidelines 51 yards
to the Cal 29. A fumble stopped that drive as the half ended,
In the third quarter the Indians again punted and took the ball away
•Vom the safety man as Paul Keckley, a hero hist year but a goat Saturday,
nimbled. Gordy White recovered lor Stanford on the 50. The drive went
only to the 25 as the Bears took over by intercepting a pass on their own 7.
But the pigskin got too hot lor the Cal backs to handle, and two fumbles
at that point set up Stanford's touchdown. On the first play Billy Main
was hit hard at the line of scrimmage, and the ball squirted into the
utstretched arms of defender Dave P'ield who ran seven yards into the end
zt.ne, unmolested. However a good last whistle saved Cal on that occasion,
and little Davey's gallop was ruled no go.
The teams lined up again, Jensen blasted through the line for 15 yards,
and then fumbled when hit on the 22. Jack McKittriek recovered for Stan
ford.
The Indians were through fooling around and it took them only four plays
le cross the Cal line. The payoff was Tom Shaw's jump pass to Ken Rose,
for eleven yards and the touchdown,
Devine's kick was deflected and that was the day's scoring.

tallied in three minutes on 7 plays, the Berkeley Ex
press acted just exactly the irresistible force that
everyone said it was.
Poor Stanford. Those G to 1 odds looked just about
right.
But the Indians doggedly stuck to the script. The
rest of the game belonged to Stanford. The enormous
California rooting section didn't have another good
chance to yell all afternoon.
The last 55 minutes were played in Cal's back
yard. Many of California's impressive 312 yards
gained were made driving toward the 50-yard line.

The Bears got down as far as Stanford's 25 a couple
times in the last quarter, but the attacks bogged down
when Erickson and Celeri started throwing passes
when they should have called runs.
In the second quarter halfback Billy Main scored
from 35 yards out, but his run was called back be
cause of an illegal use of hands penalty. Main started
to his right, saw he was going to be hemmed in, cut
back over center and went all the way to the goal
line behind some good blocking. The whole thing
went for naught as Jensen was detected holding an
Indian defender.
That was all for California. Now let's take a look
at what the Indians did.
The heads-up Stanford team got a break in the
first quarter when Cal's defensive center Stormy
Hileman accidentally touched Ken Roses rolling punt.
Guard Bob Rohrer pounced on the elusive oval and
it was Staniord first and ten on the Cal 37.
A 1 Turxiziani swept around left end for five
yards. Bob White cut over right tackle for four more, and Marty An
derson made a first down with two yards at right end.
White got seven on a quick opener through left guard, Turriziani made
two, and Marty Anderson added two more for what looked like another
:irst down. But Jim Castagnoli was caught holding, and the Indians were
■penalized back to the 30. Devine then pitched a beauty down the center to
Turriziani who ran to a first down on the California 8 yard line.
The Stanford's got clear down to the two yard line, but couldn't move
any further. Aubrey Devine's fourth down pass went wild, and Cal took
over.
With two minutes left in the second quarter defensive left half Dave
Field made a one-handed pickoff of one of Celeri's passes and behind some
fine blocking from Ken Rose and Whit Budge ran up the sidelines 51 yards
to the Cal 29. A fumble stopped that drive as the half ended,
In the third quarter the Indians again punted and took the ball away
•Vom the safety man as Paul Keckley, a hero hist year but a goat Saturday,
nimbled. Gordy White recovered lor Stanford on the 50. The drive went
only to the 25 as the Bears took over by intercepting a pass on their own 7.
But the pigskin got too hot lor the Cal backs to handle, and two fumbles
at that point set up Stanford's touchdown. On the first play Billy Main
was hit hard at the line of scrimmage, and the ball squirted into the
utstretched arms of defender Dave P'ield who ran seven yards into the end
zt.ne, unmolested. However a good last whistle saved Cal on that occasion,
and little Davey's gallop was ruled no go.
The teams lined up again, Jensen blasted through the line for 15 yards,
and then fumbled when hit on the 22. Jack McKittriek recovered for Stan
ford.
The Indians were through fooling around and it took them only four plays
le cross the Cal line. The payoff was Tom Shaw's jump pass to Ken Rose,
for eleven yards and the touchdown,
Devine's kick was deflected and that was the day's scoring.
California 7, Stanford 6. Who'da thought it?
Who would have thought that the big toe of "auto
matic" Jim Cullom would, for the second year in a
row, cheat Stanford out of a ball game that it had
been favored to lose by more than 20 points?
And after Stanford's touchdown early in the third
quarter it was this same Mr. Cullom who deflected
Aubrey Devine's attempted conversion. Although
low, the kick was straight, and it might have been
good if the big tackle hadn't touched it.
You could say Cal won by a hand and foot Sat
urday.
The contest was amazingly similar to last year's
Big Game which the Bears won by the margin of
Jim Cullom's three points after touchdown.
The Cards were never ahead Saturday and Cali
fornia didn't have to pull it put with a desperation pass
in the closing minutes, but that was the only major
deviation from the script.
The Bears took the ball on Stanford's opening

kickoff, and didn't relinquish it until they had scored
a touchdown. With fullback Jack Jensen, a great play
er Saturday, doing most of the heavy work, the
Golden Bears reeled off three successive first downs
to the Card 7. Two plays later Jack Swaner piled
over right tackle for his eleventh touchdown of the
year. Cullom converted, and Cal led 7 to 0.

fine blocking from Ken Rose and Whit Budge ran up the sidelines 51 yards

California 7, Stanford 6. Who'da thought it?
Who would have thought that the big toe of "auto
matic" Jim Cullom would, for the second year in a
row, cheat Stanford out of a ball game that it had
been favored to lose by more than 20 points?
And after Stanford's touchdown early in the third
quarter it was this same Mr. Cullom who deflected
Aubrey Devine's attempted conversion. Although
low, the kick was straight, and it might have been
good if the big tackle hadn't touched it.
You could say Cal won by a hand and foot Sat
urday.
The contest was amazingly similar to last year's
Big Game which the Bears won by the margin of
Jim Cullom's three points after touchdown.
The Cards were never ahead Saturday and Cali
fornia didn't have to pull it put with a desperation pass
in the closing minutes, but that was the only major
deviation from the script.
The Bears took the ball on Stanford's opening

kickoff, and didn't relinquish it until they had scored
a touchdown. With fullback Jack Jensen, a great play
er Saturday, doing most of the heavy work, the
Golden Bears reeled off three successive first downs
to the Card 7. Two plays later Jack Swaner piled
over right tackle for his eleventh touchdown of the
year. Cullom converted, and Cal led 7 to 0.
It took the Bears just 11 plays and 5 minutes to ac
complish their score. Like last year when the Bears
tallied in three minutes on 7 plays, the Berkeley Ex
press acted just exactly the irresistible force that
everyone said it was.
Poor Stanford. Those G to 1 odds looked just about
right.
But the Indians doggedly stuck to the script. The
rest of the game belonged to Stanford. The enormous
California rooting section didn't have another good
chance to yell all afternoon.
The last 55 minutes were played in Cal's back
yard. Many of California's impressive 312 yards
gained were made driving toward the 50-yard line.

The Bears got down as far as Stanford's 25 a couple
times in the last quarter, but the attacks bogged down
when Erickson and Celeri started throwing passes
when they should have called runs.
In the second quarter halfback Billy Main scored
from 35 yards out, but his run was called back be
cause of an illegal use of hands penalty. Main started
to his right, saw he was going to be hemmed in, cut
back over center and went all the way to the goal
line behind some good blocking. The whole thing
went for naught as Jensen was detected holding an
Indian defender.
That was all for California. Now let's take a look
at what the Indians did.
The heads-up Stanford team got a break in the
first quarter when Cal's defensive center Stormy
Hileman accidentally touched Ken Roses rolling punt.
