# Cal Wins Another Close Game
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
California 7, Stanford 6. Who'da thought it?
Who would have thought that the big toe of "auto
matic" Jim Cullom would, for the second year in a
row, cheat Stanford out of a ball game that it had
been favored to lose by more than 20 points?
And after Stanford's touchdown early in the third
quarter it was this same Mr. Cullom who deflected
Aubrey Devine's attempted conversion. Although
low, the kick was straight, and it might have been
good if the big tackle hadn't touched it.
You could say Cal won by a hand and foot Sat
urday.
The contest was amazingly similar to last year's
Big Game which the Bears won by the margin of
Jim Cullom's three points after touchdown.
The Cards were never ahead Saturday and Cali
fornia didn't have to pull it put with a desperation pass
in the closing minutes, but that was the only major
deviation from the script.
The Bears took the ball on Stanford's opening

kickoff, and didn't relinquish it until they had scored
a touchdown. With fullback Jack Jensen, a great play
er Saturday, doing most of the heavy work, the
Golden Bears reeled off three successive first downs
to the Card 7. Two plays later Jack Swaner piled
over right tackle for his eleventh touchdown of the
year. Cullom converted, and Cal led 7 to 0.
It took the Bears just 11 plays and 5 minutes to ac
complish their score. Like last year when the Bears
tallied in three minutes on 7 plays, the Berkeley Ex
press acted just exactly the irresistible force that
everyone said it was.
Poor Stanford. Those G to 1 odds looked just about
right.
But the Indians doggedly stuck to the script. The
rest of the game belonged to Stanford. The enormous
California rooting section didn't have another good
chance to yell all afternoon.
The last 55 minutes were played in Cal's back
yard. Many of California's impressive 312 yards
gained were made driving toward the 50-yard line.

The Bears got down as far as Stanford's 25 a couple
times in the last quarter, but the attacks bogged down
when Erickson and Celeri started throwing passes
when they should have called runs.
In the second quarter halfback Billy Main scored
from 35 yards out, but his run was called back be
cause of an illegal use of hands penalty. Main started
to his right, saw he was going to be hemmed in, cut
back over center and went all the way to the goal
line behind some good blocking. The whole thing
went for naught as Jensen was detected holding an
Indian defender.
That was all for California. Now let's take a look
at what the Indians did.
The heads-up Stanford team got a break in the
first quarter when Cal's defensive center Stormy
Hileman accidentally touched Ken Roses rolling punt.
Guard Bob Rohrer pounced on the elusive oval and
it was Staniord first and ten on the Cal 37.
