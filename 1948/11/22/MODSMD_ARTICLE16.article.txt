# International House at Cal Rates High with Students
## 
### JIM TIIURBER 
Cal's International House has
long been the envy of other colleges
all over the country. A magnifi
cent. modern building, it houses
both American and foreign stu

dents who live together in a spirit
of democracy.
Unlike Stanford's foreign schol
arship plan, the students at the"I"
House do not live on a rent-free
basis; residents must pay the saive
toll as those in any other university
residence. But the ''I" House doe.s
provide a convenient focal point for
Cal's international program.
The International House owes its
origin to a friendly "hello'' spoken
in New York nearly 50 years ago.
The greeting was dii-ected to a
visiting Chinese student by a YM
CA secretary, Harry Edmonds.
When the student replied, "Thank
you," Edmonds stopped him to find
out why he had given such an an
swer.
"In the two weeks I have been in
New York, no one has spoken a
word to me," answered the young
man from Shanghai.
Edmonds decided then and there
to try and remedy the situation. He
started a series of Sunday suppers
at his home, to which numerous
students were invited.
These suppers eventually became
so popular that they were moved
to a larger hall. In 1923, John D.
Rockefeller Jr. became interested
in the group and donated some real
estate and three million dollars for
its continuance. In 1927. he donated
nearly two million dollars toward
the organization of a similar group
at Cal.
