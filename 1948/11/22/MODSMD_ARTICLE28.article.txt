## Best Gaieties in Four Years 
### 
To the Editor:
After reading the "rousing" write-up that The Daily gave to the '48
Gaieties. I was very much prepared to sell my tickets rather than see
another bad show. However, if The Daily would select some competent
critics, visions like I had of "another bad Gaieties would not occur. I saw
Ihe show Thursday night and I thought it was the best I'd seen in four t
years.
Too many people at Stanford tab the Gaieties no good even before they
see it. I grant some have been bad. but this one was good, humorous, and
snappy.

(Big Game Gaieties of 1948 has received an avalanche of letters of
praise for their splendid show this year. Similarly, The Daily has re
ceived a great deal of justifiable criticism for its review.)
