# "Abominable Chaparral Jokes"
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I want to draw the attention of the staff of the Chaparral to a "joke"
about Mahatma Gandi that appeared on page 44 in the October issue of
the magazine.
As is obvious, the author of that abominable "joke" took malicious
pleasure in seeing it in print and, unfortunately, the Chaparral had the
ignominy of granting that pleasure to the person in question.
I am taking the occasion to point out that after thumbing through the
magazine once or twice, I had gotten the impression that, for the Chaparral,
the world of hilarious experiences was confined to the narrow circle of
human weaknesses and shortcomings which this "humor" magazine brought
,n limelight. It has never sought to smother them and substitute them
by the desire for commendable dispositions in the forms of satires which
have humor in the real sense of the word.
When I raise the above objection, I do not demand too much from the
magazine of an institution of higher learning where the younger genera
tions expect instruction not only in the scientific facts, but in the art of
jiving truthfully and honestly also.
The above-mentioned "joke' further disclosed the unpleasant fact that
the Chaparral found even the afore-mentioned circle of bunkum too en-
Jirhtening for itself, and resolved to malign even the personalities like
Gandhi to mark the progress in its field.
i think that noble humor has no room for distorting and debasing per
sonal pictures, let alone those wherein human dignity seems to be realized
almost to the highest degree.
Sir, I wish to convey through you to the management of the Chaparral
'.hat justice to the student body as a whole demands something different
'rom what they have practiced: that if they have to criticize the mirrors
-ike Gandhi wherein the world has to learn to dress itself, then the world
of journalism should prefer to mention even the most disagreeable cer
i.iinties to hints and innuendoes.
I hope that our magazine will co-operate with us in making our stay at
Stanford a pleasant memory for us to muse over in our later years.
