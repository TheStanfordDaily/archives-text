# Raider Clipped
## 
### 
A California raider was minus his
shaggy mane for Big Game celebra
tions this weekend after he was
captured Thursday afternoon loiter
ing near the Frosh bonfire with a

large phosphorus bomb in his hip
pocket.
Three of his Berkeley cohorts
escaped in a car and left "Buz" to be
barbered over a campus-wide hook
up of KSU Thursday night. Frosh
President Jack White and Station
Manager Steve Phillips officiated
with sheep shears by trimming
Stanfordized sideburns, while Claude
Rosenberg, captain of the Frosh
guard, gave a clip-by-clip descrip
tion of the special event program.
The bomb had been intended for
setting the bonfire aflame ahead of
schedule, and "would have succeed
ed if the other guys hadn't escaped,"
Buz said. He had traveled south
ward to Stanford with the others in
retaliation of a rumored Indian raid
upon the Campanile.
