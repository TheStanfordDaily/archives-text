# Why Don't You Both Shut Up?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We are getting pretty sick of the constant adolescent bickering that goes
on in the"Letters to the Editor" column. We refer particularly to the
current feud between The Daily and the Young Progressives. We think
that both The Daily and the YOUNG Progressives are IN: IN-ept, IN-ane,
3N-coherent, and IN-sane. Why don't you both shut up?
Very truly yours,
