# Heavy Xmas Buying Seen
## 
### Associated Press 
Storekeepers expect this Christ
mas season to be the biggest ever—
but for the first time since the war
they'll be making a real bid for your
business.
Last December retail sales reached
a staggering total of 5i2.641.000.000
—the highest for any month on rec
ord.
This year merchants are confi
dent December sales will be even
better. Some forecasters set the
gain at 10 to 15 per cent over a year
ago. saying they expect sales to
reach about S14.000,0()0.000.
Besides the high level of national
income, retailers give these reasons
for their optimism: supplies of
goods are better and more varied
than they have been in years, there
are more eye-catching special gift
items, prices are higher but values
arc better, and there is a greater
range of moderate-priced gifts.
Merchants are stressing the mod
erate price levels—for months con
sumers have been turning aside
fi;om high-priced luxury goods.
Competition is back in full force.
Merchants have recognized that in
their selection of goods. They also
plan bigger Christmas promotions
than in many years—and plan to
start them earlier than usual this
year.
Manufacturers, too, have been
giving more thought to the con
sumer. They have set out to de
velop new, fresh ideas.
Toilet goods makers have come
out with a wide variety of moder
ate-priced cosmetic kits, toilet sets,
and novelties.
With lingerie a favorite gift item
for women, one corset company is
introducing in time for Christmas
selling a new washable nylon vel
vet blouse-brassiere. A first-of-its
kind article, the company said, the
Garment can be worn as a blouse
lor daytime or evening.
"Practical gifts will dominate
sales increases," said the Interna
tional Statistical Bureau, private
lesearch firm, in a summary of the
Christmas outlook.
That idea is borne out in a survey
of consumers in 31 cities by sales
management trade magazines.
The poll showed that women are
asking for household goods and
clothing as Christmas gifts, while
men list wearing apparel as their
first choice. Beyond that, women
list jewelry as their third choice,
and automobiles are second in line
with men. After that men will take
radio-television-phonograph sets.

management trade magazines.
