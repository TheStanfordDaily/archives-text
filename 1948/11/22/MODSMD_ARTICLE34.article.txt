## You Can't Win 
### 
You can't win.
If a man turns after money, he's
I money-mad. If he keeps it, he's a
capitalist; if he spends it, he's a
playboy. If he doesn't get it, he's a
, ne'er-do-well; if he doesn't try to
; get it, he lacks ambition. If he gets
it without working for it, he's a
■ parasite; if he accumulates it after
a lifetime of hard work, people call
him a fool who never got anything
■ out of life.
Ar.d pity the poor girls.
If she has 100 many dates, she's
frivolous; if she goes steady, she has
no stag line. If she obeys all the
; rules, she's a drip; if she doesn't,
; she's wild. If she doesn't study, she
gets kicked out; if she does, she's a
grind. If she talks a lot, she's got
| a line; if she doesn't, she's a social
Hop. If she dresses up to go to class,
she's clothes conscious; if she does
nt, she's sloppy. If she comes on
time to dances, she hasn't been
around; if she comes late, she has
been around. If she yells at games,
i she makes a fool of herself; if she
doesn't, she has no school spirit.
You can't win!
And parents get it in the neck.
j too:
i How strange it seems to bring a son
Through life's great problems, one
by one,
! To keep a vigil at his crib,
} To change his rompers and his bib.
To rout the measles and the mumps,
iTo cry a bit as he grows tall—

Yet certain he is worth it al!.
And then when you are feeling
smug,
You find you've raised a jitterbug!
To the student:
The more we study, the more we
know. The more we know, the
more wc forget. The more we for
get, the less we know. The less we
know, the less we forget. The less
we forget, the more we know. So
why study?
Even at a brew date the irony
creeps out. Overheard was a lad
quizzing the girl of his immediate
choice:
"Do you smoke?"
"No."
"Drink?""
"No."
"Neck?"
"No."
"Well, do you eat hay?"
"Of course not."'
"Gad, you re not lit company for
man or beast."
Yes, the college man is a funny
guy. He like to drink. He tell
much lie. From dawn till dusk he
always smoke; his laugh is loud, he
like good joke. His pants are short,
his hair is, too. Him bad at books,
but good at woo. He chase around
in battered car: know where all the
hotspots are. He never worry, sel
dom study. His slang is good, but
French is muddy. If these be all a
student do, I think me go to college,
too.

■ out of life.
Ar.d pity the poor girls.
If she has 100 many dates, she's
frivolous; if she goes steady, she has
no stag line. If she obeys all the
; rules, she's a drip; if she doesn't,
; she's wild. If she doesn't study, she
gets kicked out; if she does, she's a
grind. If she talks a lot, she's got
| a line; if she doesn't, she's a social
Hop. If she dresses up to go to class,
she's clothes conscious; if she does
nt, she's sloppy. If she comes on
time to dances, she hasn't been
around; if she comes late, she has
been around. If she yells at games,
i she makes a fool of herself; if she
doesn't, she has no school spirit.
You can't win!
And parents get it in the neck.
j too:
i How strange it seems to bring a son
Through life's great problems, one
by one,
! To keep a vigil at his crib,
} To change his rompers and his bib.
To rout the measles and the mumps,
iTo cry a bit as he grows tall—

Yet certain he is worth it al!.
And then when you are feeling
smug,
You find you've raised a jitterbug!
To the student:
The more we study, the more we
know. The more we know, the
more wc forget. The more we for
get, the less we know. The less we
know, the less we forget. The less
we forget, the more we know. So
why study?
Even at a brew date the irony
creeps out. Overheard was a lad
quizzing the girl of his immediate
choice:
"Do you smoke?"
"No."
"Drink?""
"No."
"Neck?"
"No."
"Well, do you eat hay?"
"Of course not."'
"Gad, you re not lit company for
man or beast."
Yes, the college man is a funny
guy. He like to drink. He tell
much lie. From dawn till dusk he
always smoke; his laugh is loud, he
like good joke. His pants are short,
his hair is, too. Him bad at books,
but good at woo. He chase around
in battered car: know where all the
hotspots are. He never worry, sel
dom study. His slang is good, but
French is muddy. If these be all a
student do, I think me go to college,
too.
You can't win.
If a man turns after money, he's
I money-mad. If he keeps it, he's a
capitalist; if he spends it, he's a
playboy. If he doesn't get it, he's a
, ne'er-do-well; if he doesn't try to
; get it, he lacks ambition. If he gets
it without working for it, he's a
■ parasite; if he accumulates it after
a lifetime of hard work, people call
him a fool who never got anything
■ out of life.
