# Ike Vetoed Berlin Push
## 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Anglo-American armies did not I
drive to take Berlin in the last I
stages of the war because Gen. j
Dwight D. Eisenhower believed it
strategically unwise and stupid to i
do SO.
In his decision Eisenhower over- j
ruled- Winston Churchill and was ■
supported in doing so by the com
bined chiefs of staff.
This is revealed for the first time |
in Eisenhower's own book of the !
war, "Crusade in Europe," to be \
published today by Doubleday:
The decision, which has become j
such a publicized post-war ques
tion, was the climax of many war- 1
time arguments between the Amer- j
ican commander and the British I
Prime Minister on how the battles !
in Europe should be fought.
On the contrary, from the day
combined headquarters was set up j
until the day it disbanded. Eisen
hower, strongly supported by Gen.

George Marshall, fought a constant
battle against British attempts to
sway strategy away from what they
considered the main objective —
smashing Germany militarily as
quickly as possible.
Much of Churchill's constant dab
bling in Allied strategy undoubted
ly was motivated by the war-time
Prime Minister's tremendous inter
est and drive to take part in every
thing.
Fundamentally, however, the
book reveals the basic differences
grew out of two viewpoints. One,
that of the military represented by
Eisenhower and Marshall, who
viewed the war as strictly a mili
tary problem to be ended as quick
ly and expeditiously as possible by
any means at hand. Two, that of
Churchill, who viewed the war not
only as a military problem, but also
a means of obtaining political ad
vantage.
