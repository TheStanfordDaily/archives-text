# WATCH THE SCHOLASTIC CURVE CLIMB
## New Look Bawlouts Hit Campus; Grade Secrets No Longer Hidden 
### Tom Shawver 
Out of the blue comes the Bawlout
with the New Look. But like wo
men's fashions, it is only a revival
of an earlier style whose reappear
ance is at first the victim of vigor
ous protest.
We are referring, of course, to the
earlier announcement this year that
printing costs no longer prohibit the
publication of students' grade points.
Henceforth, an individual's ability or
non-ability to muster high scores on
examination papers will be display
ed in brightly colored booklets (at
50 cents per volume) for God and
everybody to study and discuss —not
only once, but four times a year.
The plan, though, must have merits
Otherwise it would never have been
conceived.
To begin with, the publication of
a student's grades will undoubtedly
promote scholastic improvement. No
one particularly enjoys having his
ignorance advertised, and those with
brains will immediately enter into
competition with the other brains
in a contest to determine the biggest
brain of all. Phi Betes will become
Rhodes Scholars, "B" students will
become "A" students, and borderline
cases will become average, normal
people. The curve system will na
turally have to be eliminated as
evi ryone will be absolutely too bril
liant to ever sink to the depths of
a "D" or an "F".
The argument is also advanced

that people with high mentalities
should have their achievements pub-
I licized just as are the achievements
J of those who excel in athletics or
j dramatics. An excellent point, es
pecially considering the existence of
an honorary society named Phi Beta
i Kappj;. The apparent lack of corre
| lation between high grades and stu
dents with high college aptitude
scores and IQ ratings is unimportant,
! too.
Another valuable service to be
j rendered by the new Bawlout is its
I function as a date bureau. Stanford
, men will merely refer to their Bawl
outs to decide whether a girl is a
studymonger and a bookworm or
a beautiful, brainless type of girl
who goes out every night and only
j knows her roommates as speaking
acquaintances.
Women will receive equal benefits,
i Those men who are far, far plus will
call tor a certain type of evening and
those hovering around minus terri
try should be first string football
players, party boys, or just plain
j dumb.
Professors' salaries can be cut and
j the tuition reduced since faculty
members will have much more time
for relaxation and part-time jobs,
i Instead of spending long hours in
deciphering term papers, a professor
1 need only refer to the Bawlout to
discover the intellectual caliber of
j any student.
Parents will be noticeably pleased.

What better method is there of
broadcasting a son's or daughter s
scholastic achievements than to have
gaudy red and yellow booklets cas
ually strewn about the living room at
home for friends and relations to
read in moments of liesure. Children
at the other extreme will have print
ed testimony of their stupidity held
over their 'heads for years to come.
Arguments against the plan are
hopelessly meager. The fact that
only grade points are published and
not whether they were acquired in
mental hygiene or advanced physics
is of no importance at all. An d
whether the student has a family
to support or has to work to meet ex
penses, has been ill. or has boisterous
roommates or noisy living quarters
should never be taken into account.
In the "outside world" it is usually
job performance and not an accumu
lated hoard of "AV and "B's" that
count for a person s success in life.
Therefore, the man with the highest
Bawlout average is the one to be
most likely to succeed.
It can be readily seen, then, that
the scheme to revive the old Baw l
out is a vise and intelligent one that
will doubtlesly draw the unanimous
applause of students, parents, facul
ty members, and friends of the Uni
versity. Only magazine publishers
should seriously contest the move.
Bawlouts have positively no peers in
bathroom reading material.

most likely to succeed.
It can be readily seen, then, that
the scheme to revive the old Baw l
out is a vise and intelligent one that
will doubtlesly draw the unanimous
applause of students, parents, facul
ty members, and friends of the Uni
versity. Only magazine publishers
should seriously contest the move.
Bawlouts have positively no peers in
bathroom reading material.
Out of the blue comes the Bawlout
with the New Look. But like wo
men's fashions, it is only a revival
of an earlier style whose reappear
ance is at first the victim of vigor
ous protest.
We are referring, of course, to the
earlier announcement this year that
printing costs no longer prohibit the
publication of students' grade points.
Henceforth, an individual's ability or
non-ability to muster high scores on
examination papers will be display
ed in brightly colored booklets (at
50 cents per volume) for God and
everybody to study and discuss —not
only once, but four times a year.
The plan, though, must have merits
Otherwise it would never have been
conceived.
To begin with, the publication of
a student's grades will undoubtedly
promote scholastic improvement. No
one particularly enjoys having his
ignorance advertised, and those with
brains will immediately enter into
competition with the other brains
in a contest to determine the biggest
brain of all. Phi Betes will become
Rhodes Scholars, "B" students will
become "A" students, and borderline
cases will become average, normal
people. The curve system will na
turally have to be eliminated as
evi ryone will be absolutely too bril
liant to ever sink to the depths of
a "D" or an "F".
The argument is also advanced

that people with high mentalities
should have their achievements pub-
I licized just as are the achievements
J of those who excel in athletics or
j dramatics. An excellent point, es
pecially considering the existence of
an honorary society named Phi Beta
i Kappj;. The apparent lack of corre
| lation between high grades and stu
dents with high college aptitude
scores and IQ ratings is unimportant,
! too.
Another valuable service to be
j rendered by the new Bawlout is its
I function as a date bureau. Stanford
, men will merely refer to their Bawl
outs to decide whether a girl is a
studymonger and a bookworm or
a beautiful, brainless type of girl
who goes out every night and only
j knows her roommates as speaking
acquaintances.
Women will receive equal benefits,
i Those men who are far, far plus will
call tor a certain type of evening and

players, party boys, or just plain
j dumb.
Professors' salaries can be cut and
j the tuition reduced since faculty
members will have much more time
for relaxation and part-time jobs,
i Instead of spending long hours in

What better method is there of

scholastic achievements than to have
gaudy red and yellow booklets cas
ually strewn about the living room at

at the other extreme will have print
ed testimony of their stupidity held
over their 'heads for years to come.
Arguments against the plan are
hopelessly meager. The fact that
only grade points are published and
not whether they were acquired in
mental hygiene or advanced physics
is of no importance at all. An d
whether the student has a family
to support or has to work to meet ex
penses, has been ill. or has boisterous
roommates or noisy living quarters
should never be taken into account.
In the "outside world" it is usually
job performance and not an accumu
lated hoard of "AV and "B's" that
count for a person s success in life.
Therefore, the man with the highest
Bawlout average is the one to be
most likely to succeed.
It can be readily seen, then, that
the scheme to revive the old Baw l
out is a vise and intelligent one that
will doubtlesly draw the unanimous
applause of students, parents, facul
ty members, and friends of the Uni
versity. Only magazine publishers
should seriously contest the move.
Bawlouts have positively no peers in
bathroom reading material.
