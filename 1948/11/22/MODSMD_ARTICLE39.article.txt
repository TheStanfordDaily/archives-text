gave a icport on Don Campbell.

back" had been struck on the head
and had suffered a concussion.
However, he had regained con

passes from the fullback spot.
Marchie Praises Line
Marchie seemed pleased as punch
with his line, end to end. He sin
gled out tackles Rau and White,
guards Fix, Rohrer, McKittriek. and
Liljenwall, and center Jim Casta
gnoli, who played GO minutes, as
being worthy of special praise.
In the backfield he liked the de
fensive work of Dave Field.
He couldn't get too high on his
co - captain Marty Anderon, who
played a great game at fullback.
Marty isn t built like a ballplayer,"
Schwartz said. "He plays strictly
on his nerve. He's a great inspi
ration to the team."
Schwartz had a few kind words
left over for Jack Jensen, whom he
described as a great back. Marchie
said that some of the Army backs
looked better against Stanford be
cause of the long runs they made,
but that "Jensen is the best all
around ballplayer Stanford has
laced this year. He does eveiything
well."

In the dressing joom after the
Came, Coach Marchie Schwartz
would not say that his Indians had
played their best game of the sea
son auainst the Bears.
"We were up for the game,"
Schwartz said, "but wc also played
well against Oregon and USC. This
was ONE of our best games."
When asked which he thoup.ht
would be the better Rose Bowl
team—Oregon or California, Mar
chie said he did not care to -com
ment.
Report on Campbell
Dr. Frit". Roth, team physician,
gave a icport on Don Campbell.
He said fiat the hard-tackling full
back" had been struck on the head
and had suffered a concussion.
However, he had regained con
sciousness and it was not expected
that he would suffer any ill effects.
Schwartz stated that losing Camp
bell definitely hurt the Indians.
And while making it clear that he
did not want to take anything away
from California, the Stanford coach
said he ielt the Cards' attack might
have gone better if Campbell had
been in there to throw the long
passes from the fullback spot.
Marchie Praises Line
Marchie seemed pleased as punch
with his line, end to end. He sin
gled out tackles Rau and White,
guards Fix, Rohrer, McKittriek. and
Liljenwall, and center Jim Casta
gnoli, who played GO minutes, as
being worthy of special praise.
In the backfield he liked the de
fensive work of Dave Field.
He couldn't get too high on his
co - captain Marty Anderon, who
played a great game at fullback.
Marty isn t built like a ballplayer,"
Schwartz said. "He plays strictly
on his nerve. He's a great inspi
ration to the team."
Schwartz had a few kind words
left over for Jack Jensen, whom he
described as a great back. Marchie
said that some of the Army backs
looked better against Stanford be
cause of the long runs they made,
but that "Jensen is the best all
around ballplayer Stanford has
laced this year. He does eveiything
well."
