# Banner Lowered
## 
### 
University of California football
raiders staged a daring raid Saturday
â€”at the Memorial Stadium.
Several men scaled the stadium
wall on the Stanford side of the oval,
reached the press box, and lowered
the Stanford banner flying over the
box.
Before the Cal rooters could escape
with their prize, several Stanford
looters caught the raiders, relieved
them of the banner, and returned it
to its place over the press box.
