# Tankmen Win Championship

### 
By beating the California Bees
5 to 4 in their final game of the
season, Coach Tom Havnie's Stan
ford water polo team clinched its
second consecutive PCC title be
fore a highly partisan crowd at
Berkeley last Satuday morning.
The score of the hard - fought
game does not clearly indicate the
Indians' superiority. Coach Hay
nie cleared the bench in order to
keep the score down, and the Bears
staged a final rally by scoring two
points in the last minute of play.
r lhe Cards took an immediate 2
to 1 lead in the first quarter and
added another point to make the
| score 3 to 1 at the half. Forward
Fritz Maurer tallied two of the In
dian markers, while Ralph Sala, an
All-Coast guard, scored the other.
It was Sala's first point of the
season.
Captain Harry Borchers then
took command in the second half
by scoring two goals, one being a
beautiful shot from half court.
These two scores virtually clinched
the game for the champs.
Particular praise goes to the en
tire first team, for their splendid
play throughout the quarter: for
wards — Captain Harry Borchers,
Fritz Maurer, and Hub Stokely;
guards—Ralph Sala, Ken Fox, and
Don Weeden; goalie- Kim Fletcher.
