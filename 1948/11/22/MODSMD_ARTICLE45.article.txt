t the game Saturday we sat
t to Bob Clifford, Northwestern
versity scout.
[r. Clifford, who also coaches the
hinan team at Evanston, was a
/ busy man. Fioin the moment
California team entered the
lium until the final gun, Clifford
lOin look his eyes off the field,
front of him was the usual
it's equipment—field glasses, the
rts with the circles and the X's,
a dozen pencils, a program, a
.era, and a portable radio,
or a while we weren't sure of
identity, except that he was a
it — probably from Northwest-
Minnesota, or Oregon. But
■n the score Illinois 7, North
tern 20 was announced, there
id no longer be any doubt.
Scout Has Anxious Moment
Whew," said the man with no
reciation of the dramatic, "when
' said Illinois 7 first, my heart
stuck in my throat."
.Veil, that's it."he said, and
t back to work with more de
lination than before, if such a
g was possible.
>fore the game Clifford made
ous notes on California's kick
nnd passing practice. He took
n the numbers of the players
did the punting, and who did
passing, and made little notes
;aeh. He also noted the receiv
and their comparative speeds,
ice the contest got under way,
> escaped his attention.
Diagrams Every Play
hen the Bears were on offense
ord diagrammed every play
: his circles and X's. He also
'd down the number of every
er who handled the ball, and
numbers ot the key blockers,
any peculiarities of each,
hen Stanford had the ball, he
a running tally on the num
of times the Bears used each
nsive formation (6-2-2-1, etc.)
made notes on how the Cal
ers reacted to different plays.
half - time Clifford showed a
I deal of interest in the band
lations and in the card stunts,
took pictures of each with his
sra.
Fouled-up Press Box
; couldn't get over how poorly
nged the crowded Cal press box
and the fact that our seats had
i "sold" twice didn't brighten
opinion of California public re
ns a bit. "Most fouled-up press
I've ever been in" were his
.is.
; said that he had been watch -
Cal for two weeks. He had
"impressed" by the Bears'
zing against Washington State,
lie didn't seem too worried Sat
y. The possibility that Cal
Idn't go to the Rose Bowl prob
worried him more.
' the third quarter Clifford
letl to know the Cal plays as
as Pappy Waldorf himself. To
amusement, he would "call" the
plays before they broke with
t 90 per cent accuracy.
wasn't overly impressed with
platoons, and he noticed how
the Cal players were when
ran on and off the field in the
h quarter. "Stanford looks
i <he fresher team," he added,
nnesota's man, George Nash,
been there the week before, but
vas up at Corvallis watching
on Saturday. Clifford believed
would exchange notes during
jlane ride home.
