# BEAR LOCKER ROOM
## Pappy: 'We Were Lucky to Win' 
### 
Dai y Editor Tom Self made his
way to the California dressing room
after Saturday's unforgettable Big
Game to get "the other side's" re
action and comment.
The first person Tom approached
was Jackie Jensen. Bear fullback
and All-American candidate. When
asked whether he thought that this
year's game was tougher than last
year's, Jensen said:
"No, I don't think so. We van
against them, that's for sure. But
both teams play over their heads in
the Big Game."
Pappy Calls the Score
Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf
seemed to think that Cal had a
tougher time handling the Indians
this season than last. A number of
newsmen crowded around the port
ly Pappy, saying, "Well, you called
it. There's your one point." At the
Big Game rally in Berkeley, Wal
dorf had remarked that he would
be satisfied with a one-point win
over Stanford.
About the "platoon system" of
substitution the California coach
had this to say:
"I don't think it would have made
any difference whether we substi-

tuted by squads, platoons, individ
ually, or not at all. We were lucky
to win."
Sprcul: Great Game for Stanford
Bear end John Cunningham sim
ply said, "We sure sneaked by one
today." Dr. Gordon Sproul, presi
dent of the University of California,
commented, 'That was certainly a
great game you Stanfords played
today."
Captain Gene Frassetto would
not comment on the game but ex
pressed concern for Don Campbell.
Indian quarterback, who was se
riously injured on the first play.
Other Bears chimed in and re
marked on Campbell's continuing
bad luck. One of the Cal managers
added that the plucky Redshirt
fought all the way to the hospital.
A San Francisco columnist, Art
Rosenbaum, rather cyinically ob
served that "it was fine for a high
school game."


JOHN CUNNINGHAM. Bear end,
was one of the persons inter
viewed by Daily Editor Tom Self
when he invaded the Cal locker
room after Saturday's Big Game.
Cunningham sagely commented,
'We sure sneaked one over to
day."
