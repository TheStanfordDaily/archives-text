# Cal Bonfire Molts Street; Big Game Boast Falls Flat
## 
### 
Most of Cal's Big Game house de
corations depicted an angry bear
thrashing a helpless Indian. One
house pictured a strongman bear
hammering a plate with a sledge
hammer. The force of the blow
forced a weight (a Stanford Indian in
ibis case) to rise to the top of a
"strength thermometer" to ring the
bell.
Before the game Saturday, the top
of the thermometer gave no predict
ed score of the Big Game, but a sign
did read, "'We don't care how high
the score goes."
After the game house members
replaced the boast with a newly
painted sign giving the game's score
â€”7 to 6.
The California Bears added a little
something extra to their Big Game

1 Bonfire Thursday night. Although
the Cal fire was a small one com
pared to the Stanford blaze, the
Berkeley conflagration generated
enough heat to melt the macadam (
: street.
As the street melted, the surface
began to sink. By the tune the fire j
burned itself out, the street had fal
len a few feet.
Because fire regulations in the {
campus area restrict the size of
Big Game bonfires, Cal rooters built
] a number of blazes in addition to
their main one. Other rooters car- \
ried on the bonfire spirit to include j
Big Game house decorations. The
Chi Omega sorority decorations were
torn down and burned by jealous
I neighbors.
