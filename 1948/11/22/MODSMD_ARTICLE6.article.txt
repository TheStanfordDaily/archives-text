# STUDENT CONCERTS
## Ballet Troupe Opens Series 
### 
Mia Slavenska and her ''Ballet
Variante" will open the ASSU Stu
dent Concert Series tonight at 8:15
in the Memorial Auditorium.
The program presents a variation
on the usual ballet repertoire. The
troupe of 12 members will present
ballets based on modern, folk, and
classical music.
Two ballets will be based on a
study of American rural life, ''Set
tlers' Sunday" and "Spirituals."
Two ballets to classical settings will
be "Ballet Divertissements," based
on Tschaikovsky's music; and "Por
traits in Porcelain," based on music
by Debussy.

Students who have not already
done so should pick up their
t'.ckets at the Concert Scries of
fice, Manager Sharon Nuss said
yesterday. Student body cards
are needed because special rates
are given students. Individual
tickets are available for tonight's
performance.

Slavenska and the entire cast
take part in ''Settlers' Sunday." The
ballet, a glimpse of Americana from
the old West, is described as fol
lows:
The Sunday church services are
over; the people meet outdoors to
chat, flirt, gossip, and dance. The
lovers, naturally, are the first to
arrive, but their tender duet is in
terrupted by the arrival of the cow
boy, a show-off and life-of-the
narty type. The sheriff follows with
two gossiping maiden ladies.
A ranch couple and their spoiled
chi'd join the party. A square dance
unites the group and all take turns
in solos showing their personalities
and soecial skills. The bored child
breaks into the dance in fits of bad
temper, to the embarrassment of
her helpless parents. The shadows
begin to fall and the happily tired
dancers take leave.
