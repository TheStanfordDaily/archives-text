# Slavenska Lame, Other Performers Save Show
## 
### 
Were it not for Joey Harris and
Eileen Locklin, the audience at last
night's Concert Series might well
have gone home disappointed at the
curtailed appearances of Mia Sla
venska.
The featured performer, who
dances in most of the numbers as
well as designing the costumes and
creating most of the choreography
in her "Ballet Variante," favored a
severe muscle strain. Nana Gollner
as guest artist danced in her place
in most of the numbers. Miss Goll
ner has seen better days, but was
very good in "Settlers' Sunday."
Slavenska danced only "Salome"
and "Cake Walk," two numbers in
which she could keep off her toes.
"Salome," if performed in bur
lesque, would have been closed by
the police, but in ballet it is con
sidered art.
Pert Miss Locklin was best in a
solo, Variation," part of "Ballet
Divertissements." The saucy ballet
is more suited to her personable
stage presence than the formal bal
let.
The entire propram was staged
without, scenerv. However, the light
ing effects and the lavish and col

orful costumes made any back
ground unnecessary. Musical ac
companiment was provided by duo
pianos, played by Henrietta Pelta
and Joseph Barish.
utLome a habit at Memo
rial Theater lately, the curtain was
20 minutes late. There were some
uncomfortably long pauses between
parts.
The discrepancy between the
talents of Slavenska and Gollner
and Joey Harris and the rest of
the cast was marked.â€”Tom Self and
