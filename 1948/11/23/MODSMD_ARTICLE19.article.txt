# Fire Department's New Big Red Machine Will Combat Weed Fires
## 
### JIM THURBER 
The Big Red Machine has arrived, at least as far as Fire Chief
Marston is concerned.
A brand new fire engine was delivered to the Fire Department
this week. One of the four largest engines in California, the
tiuck will replace the department's well-worn Ford pumper.

The fire engine, mounted on an
Army 6x6, was ordered last year
when the Fire Department found
that they did not have suitable
equipment to handle the many grass
fires occurring on campus.
With six-wheel drive, the truck
should be able to take care of any
terrain around the Farm. A two
way radio will enable the driver to
keep in close contact with the sta
tion, and will greatly facilitate the
fighting of forest fires.
The unique feature of this fire
engine, besides its tremendous size,
is a double pumping unit. Two
separate pumps are concealed in
the body of the truck and each
pump has two sets of controlsâ€”one
at the driver's seat, and one at the
pump itself.
The pumps are supplied by a 1.000-
gallon storage tank. The truck is
fully equipped with ladders and
over 3,000 feet of hose.
Two delivery nozzles, a 500-gallon
per minute, low-pressure unit and a
fog system have been installed on
the engine. This will adapt the c>n
gine for any type of fire, although
the truck will primarily be used
for grass and field fires.


'IHIS CKi RED MACHINE will replace the Stanford Fire Department's
old Ford pumper. The truck, of the four largest in the state, has
a 1,000-gallon storage taidv. and will he used to combat brush lires.
