## The 						Right Man 
### 
When Dwight D. Eisenhower was named president of Colum
bia, there was some talk that the General was taking on an easy
30b, sort of a rest cure after the war. And there were those who
said that Ike was given the job as a reward for his services.
Anyone with experience in running a university will tell you
how wrong both ideas are. Eisenhower was selected to head
ihe university because his demonstrated qualities of leadership
and administration were vitally needed by Columbia.
Running a university is a difficult task. Keeping harmony
among the faculty, students, and alumni, and keeping the uni- j
versity solvent and attractive to the public requires the greatest
tact, judgment, and ability. Wasn't it Woodrow Wilson who
said that running the nation was a cinch compared to running
a university?
Because the job of being president of a university is such a
big one, the selection of a president must be made carefully.
And that is why it has taken nine months to select a new presi
dent for Stanford. No doubt it would have taken many months
more if the committees and the board had not discovered the
right man in Dr. John Ewart Wallace Sterling.
Dr. Sterling has all the qualities requisite for the tremendous
job that faces him. He is a scholarly man, and so will appreciate
the faculty viewpoint.
He is a capable administrator and so will be able to run the
vast and complex machinery of the University.
He is a friendly man, easy to get along with. He'll be popular
with faculty and students alike; and being not too far removed
from his own school days, he'll be able to approach student
problems with a broader understanding. His background as an
athlete and coach gives him first-hand knowledge of the proper
place of athletics in the University system.
He has spent several years at Stanford, so he does not come
as a stranger to the Stanford way of life and Stanford problems.
Since his appointment, we have had the pleasure of a personal
interview with him. Additionally, we've talked with those who
studied under him at Cal Tech, and faculty members who know
him intimately. All of us are agreed that Dr. Sterling is a real
gentleman, and the right man foi Stanford.
