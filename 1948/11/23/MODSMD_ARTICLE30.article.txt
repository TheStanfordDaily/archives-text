## Bull Session 
### 
Note to No One in Particular:
First and most important on this morning's Bull Session agenda is a
large and sincere congratulatory note from this coulmn to Bud Irving
arid his entire Gaieties crew for one of the most professional and polished
Big Game Gaieties seen at Stanford in the last five

years.
Last Thursday's Daily review to the contrary, the
Gaieties did not "bore" while they "scored." Granted
there were one or two acts which didn't match the
over all excellence of the production as a whole. But
at no time was I bored. Like most of the Friday
night audience, I left the Mem Aud with a feeling
that I had just seen a fine college show, one that was
a credit to Ram's Head and a credit to the University.
I repeat: Bud Irving, Don ShefTey, Harold Niven,
George Eckstein, and all the rest—Congratulations.

Eig Game Chaser:'
I have had neither the time nor the inclination to find out who wrote
that story in the Daily last Thursday saying that many Stanford girls
were without Big Game dates because the fellows had been "scared off - ' by
h column I wrote on the scarcity of Big Game dates. Needless to say, if
that little essay actually influenced some fellows not to ask Stanford girls
tor Big Game dates, I'm very sorry. I don't actually believe that any
follow who had a great desire to take out a certain girl was talked out if it
by what I wrote. If he was, he should have his head examined.
On sccond thought, any of you fellows who fall into this category,
drop around and see me. We'll all go down to the psychiatrist together.

One of my friends was very worried about getting his Big Game date
back to Stanford by 12 o'clock Saturday night. The demerit system didn't
worry him; he was airaid she would turn into a pumpkin if he kept her
out after the stroke of midnight. However, he made it back to school
in time. She had a jet-piopelled broomstick.
* * «
As far as I'm concerned, there's one advantage to having these king
si?ed bags under my eyes after last weekend. Most people can't tell
whether these drooping sacks are from a hangover, or whether I've just
rinished packing my clothes into them to go home for Thanksgiving.

Caught in the Draft?
Freshman: How do you stand with your draft board?
Soph: Well, it's going to be "touch and go."
Freshman: What do you mean "touch and go?"
Soph: They're gonna touch, and I'm gonna go!

back to Stanford by 12 o'clock Saturday night. The demerit system didn't
worry him; he was airaid she would turn into a pumpkin if he kept her
out after the stroke of midnight. However, he made it back to school
in time. She had a jet-piopelled broomstick.

As far as I'm concerned, there's one advantage to having these king
si?ed bags under my eyes after last weekend. Most people can't tell
whether these drooping sacks are from a hangover, or whether I've just
rinished packing my clothes into them to go home for Thanksgiving.

Caught in the Draft?
Freshman: How do you stand with your draft board?
Soph: Well, it's going to be "touch and go."
Freshman: What do you mean "touch and go?"
Soph: They're gonna touch, and I'm gonna go!

Note to No One in Particular:
First and most important on this morning's Bull Session agenda is a
large and sincere congratulatory note from this coulmn to Bud Irving
arid his entire Gaieties crew for one of the most professional and polished
Big Game Gaieties seen at Stanford in the last five

years.
Last Thursday's Daily review to the contrary, the
Gaieties did not "bore" while they "scored." Granted
there were one or two acts which didn't match the
over all excellence of the production as a whole. But
at no time was I bored. Like most of the Friday
night audience, I left the Mem Aud with a feeling
that I had just seen a fine college show, one that was
a credit to Ram's Head and a credit to the University.
I repeat: Bud Irving, Don ShefTey, Harold Niven,
George Eckstein, and all the rest—Congratulations.

Eig Game Chaser:'
I have had neither the time nor the inclination to find out who wrote
that story in the Daily last Thursday saying that many Stanford girls
were without Big Game dates because the fellows had been "scared off - ' by
h column I wrote on the scarcity of Big Game dates. Needless to say, if
that little essay actually influenced some fellows not to ask Stanford girls
tor Big Game dates, I'm very sorry. I don't actually believe that any
follow who had a great desire to take out a certain girl was talked out if it
by what I wrote. If he was, he should have his head examined.
On sccond thought, any of you fellows who fall into this category,
drop around and see me. We'll all go down to the psychiatrist together.
