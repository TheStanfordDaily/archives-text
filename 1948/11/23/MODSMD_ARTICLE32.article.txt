# U.S. Reds Attack ERP

While the Communists are, once
more, attempting to wreck the Mar
shall Pian by waging wild strikes
in France, they are making" consid
erable efforts to destroy its very
foundation right here in America.
To be sure, the Communist party
is practically non - existent in the
United States. Yet, nothing can
please Moscow so much as the re
actionary, anti-Marshall-aid stand
taken by some irreductible isola
tionist elements, or, closer to us, by
the consciously fact-distorting Wal
lace propaganda, trying, by means
of repeated statements such as "Our
hands are not clean in European
affairs," to t convince the American
people of its presumed guilt.
To understand what the Marshall
Plan is, let us come back to the
Harvard speech of June 5, 1947, in
which Marshall himself brought out

the purpose of
aid to Europe:
"It is logical
that the United
States should do
whatever it is
able to do to as
sist in the re
turn of normal
economic health
in the world,
without which
there can be no

political stability and no assured
peace. Our policy is not directed
against any country or doctrine, but
against hunger, poverty, despera
tion. and chaos. Its purpose should
be the revival of a working econ
omy in the world, so as to permit
the emergence of political and so
cial conditions in which free insti
tutions can exist."
To Marshall's surprise, the Euro
pean statesmen understood this
speech as a promise of American
financial help. They immediately
began consulting each other in
order to shape a sound recovery
program for Europe, on the assump
tion that dollars would be advanced
by the United States for the start
ing push. Marshall found himself
in an embarrassing position. It is
entirely to his honor that he suc
ceeded in order not to deceive the
liope of millions of Europeans. In
this respect, the hard opposition he
met in the last Congress would have
daunted almost any man.
Imperialism?
How can one speak of American
imperialism after that? Should we
recall that Russia and all the other
nations behind the "iron curtain"
were, and still are, invited to join
the European - shaped recovery
plan? Should we recall that the
Czechoslovakian government, in
cluding its Communist members,
had accepted the invitation to come
to the Paris preliminary meeting—
but that they were strongly rebuked
by Moscow the next day and com
peted, unwillingly, to cancel their
plans? Should we recall that neu
trality - abiding countries such as
Sweden and Switzerland never
would have joined any internation
al organization showing the slight
est hint of political conditions?
In short, the Marshall Plan was
sought by Europe, and in no way
imposed upon it by the United
States. There was no other alterna
tive to it but more starvation and
more misery, since the Soviets, who
claim to be deeply concerned about
Europe's welfare, never extended
their generosity so far as to pro
pose a Molotov Plan, which dis
tressed Europe would have accept
ed with great alactrity.
As a matter of fact, the Marshall
Plan—or, as it is called now, the
ERP (European Recovery Plan) —
is the work of free nations upon
which the State Department did
not exert any pressure, in spite of
the innumerable tricky suggestions
put in the reactionary or isolation
ist press of Hearst and McCormick.
The 1G nations participating in the
ERP have been able to remain
faithful to the economic principles
they were abiding by before enter
ing the agreement, however far
were those principles from the ideas
of capitalistic free enterprise, tradi
tionally dear to this country.
Socialism Required
Socialism in Europe is not a
fancy; it is a necessity which will

have to last as long as deemed nec
essary. While the United States can
always afford to produce more
when she needs more, impover
ished Europe must share, organize,
and distribute the meager quanti
ties available. Socialism can be run
by the old sticklers of the Second
International; it can be shaped by
the Christian Democrats of the new
type, or by both. Socialism can
come to a serious plight as in Swe
den; it may bring fair results as in
Britain; it can have highly success
ful results as in Poland—or in Bel
gium. where Socialist Paul-Henri
Spaak uses smoother, more liberal
methods than in many all-capitalist
countries. But in all cases, for the
pesent time. Europe's economy has
to be socialistic.
The last proof of the non-impe
rialism of the Marshall Plan lies in
the fact that it does not exclude,
but rather looks forward to an in
creasing trade between Eastern and
Western Europe. It is self-evident
that the more the Western nations
will be able to profit by Polish coal
and Hungarian wheat, the less they
will have to depend on the dollars
of the American taxpayer.

nations behind the "iron curtain"
were, and still are, invited to join
the European - shaped recovery
plan? Should we recall that the
Czechoslovakian government, in
cluding its Communist members,
had accepted the invitation to come
to the Paris preliminary meeting—
but that they were strongly rebuked
by Moscow the next day and com
peted, unwillingly, to cancel their
plans? Should we recall that neu
trality - abiding countries such as
Sweden and Switzerland never
would have joined any internation
al organization showing the slight
est hint of political conditions?
In short, the Marshall Plan was
sought by Europe, and in no way
imposed upon it by the United
States. There was no other alterna
tive to it but more starvation and
more misery, since the Soviets, who
claim to be deeply concerned about
Europe's welfare, never extended
their generosity so far as to pro
pose a Molotov Plan, which dis
tressed Europe would have accept
ed with great alactrity.
As a matter of fact, the Marshall
Plan—or, as it is called now, the
ERP (European Recovery Plan) —
is the work of free nations upon
which the State Department did
not exert any pressure, in spite of
the innumerable tricky suggestions
put in the reactionary or isolation
ist press of Hearst and McCormick.
The 1G nations participating in the
ERP have been able to remain
faithful to the economic principles
they were abiding by before enter
ing the agreement, however far
were those principles from the ideas
of capitalistic free enterprise, tradi
tionally dear to this country.
Socialism Required
Socialism in Europe is not a
fancy; it is a necessity which will

have to last as long as deemed nec
essary. While the United States can
always afford to produce more
when she needs more, impover
ished Europe must share, organize,
and distribute the meager quanti
ties available. Socialism can be run
by the old sticklers of the Second
International; it can be shaped by
the Christian Democrats of the new
type, or by both. Socialism can
come to a serious plight as in Swe
den; it may bring fair results as in
Britain; it can have highly success
ful results as in Poland—or in Bel
gium. where Socialist Paul-Henri
Spaak uses smoother, more liberal
methods than in many all-capitalist
countries. But in all cases, for the
pesent time. Europe's economy has
to be socialistic.
The last proof of the non-impe
rialism of the Marshall Plan lies in
the fact that it does not exclude,
but rather looks forward to an in
creasing trade between Eastern and
Western Europe. It is self-evident
that the more the Western nations
will be able to profit by Polish coal
and Hungarian wheat, the less they
will have to depend on the dollars
of the American taxpayer.

While the Communists are, once
more, attempting to wreck the Mar
shall Pian by waging wild strikes
in France, they are making" consid
erable efforts to destroy its very
foundation right here in America.
To be sure, the Communist party
is practically non - existent in the
United States. Yet, nothing can
please Moscow so much as the re
actionary, anti-Marshall-aid stand
taken by some irreductible isola
tionist elements, or, closer to us, by
the consciously fact-distorting Wal
lace propaganda, trying, by means
of repeated statements such as "Our
hands are not clean in European
affairs," to t convince the American
people of its presumed guilt.
To understand what the Marshall
Plan is, let us come back to the
Harvard speech of June 5, 1947, in
which Marshall himself brought out

the purpose of
aid to Europe:
"It is logical
that the United
States should do
whatever it is
able to do to as
sist in the re
turn of normal
economic health
in the world,
without which
there can be no

political stability and no assured
peace. Our policy is not directed
against any country or doctrine, but
against hunger, poverty, despera
tion. and chaos. Its purpose should
be the revival of a working econ
omy in the world, so as to permit
the emergence of political and so
cial conditions in which free insti
tutions can exist."
To Marshall's surprise, the Euro
pean statesmen understood this
speech as a promise of American
financial help. They immediately
began consulting each other in
order to shape a sound recovery
program for Europe, on the assump
tion that dollars would be advanced
by the United States for the start
ing push. Marshall found himself
in an embarrassing position. It is
entirely to his honor that he suc
ceeded in order not to deceive the
liope of millions of Europeans. In
this respect, the hard opposition he
met in the last Congress would have
daunted almost any man.

ful results as in Poland—or in Bel
gium. where Socialist Paul-Henri
Spaak uses smoother, more liberal
methods than in many all-capitalist
countries. But in all cases, for the
pesent time. Europe's economy has
to be socialistic.
The last proof of the non-impe
rialism of the Marshall Plan lies in
the fact that it does not exclude,
but rather looks forward to an in
creasing trade between Eastern and
Western Europe. It is self-evident
that the more the Western nations
will be able to profit by Polish coal
and Hungarian wheat, the less they
will have to depend on the dollars
of the American taxpayer.

While the Communists are, once
more, attempting to wreck the Mar
shall Pian by waging wild strikes
in France, they are making" consid
erable efforts to destroy its very
foundation right here in America.
To be sure, the Communist party
is practically non - existent in the
United States. Yet, nothing can
please Moscow so much as the re
actionary, anti-Marshall-aid stand
taken by some irreductible isola
tionist elements, or, closer to us, by
the consciously fact-distorting Wal
lace propaganda, trying, by means
of repeated statements such as "Our
hands are not clean in European
affairs," to t convince the American
people of its presumed guilt.
To understand what the Marshall
Plan is, let us come back to the
Harvard speech of June 5, 1947, in
which Marshall himself brought out

the purpose of
aid to Europe:
"It is logical
that the United
States should do
whatever it is
able to do to as
sist in the re
turn of normal
economic health
in the world,
without which
there can be no

political stability and no assured
peace. Our policy is not directed
against any country or doctrine, but
against hunger, poverty, despera
tion. and chaos. Its purpose should
be the revival of a working econ
omy in the world, so as to permit
the emergence of political and so
cial conditions in which free insti
tutions can exist."
To Marshall's surprise, the Euro
pean statesmen understood this
speech as a promise of American
financial help. They immediately
began consulting each other in
order to shape a sound recovery
program for Europe, on the assump
tion that dollars would be advanced
by the United States for the start
ing push. Marshall found himself
in an embarrassing position. It is
entirely to his honor that he suc
ceeded in order not to deceive the
liope of millions of Europeans. In
this respect, the hard opposition he
met in the last Congress would have
daunted almost any man.
Imperialism?
How can one speak of American
imperialism after that? Should we
recall that Russia and all the other
nations behind the "iron curtain"
were, and still are, invited to join
the European - shaped recovery
plan? Should we recall that the
Czechoslovakian government, in
cluding its Communist members,
had accepted the invitation to come
to the Paris preliminary meeting—
but that they were strongly rebuked
by Moscow the next day and com
peted, unwillingly, to cancel their
plans? Should we recall that neu
trality - abiding countries such as
Sweden and Switzerland never
would have joined any internation
al organization showing the slight
est hint of political conditions?
In short, the Marshall Plan was
sought by Europe, and in no way
imposed upon it by the United
States. There was no other alterna
tive to it but more starvation and
more misery, since the Soviets, who
claim to be deeply concerned about
Europe's welfare, never extended
their generosity so far as to pro
pose a Molotov Plan, which dis
tressed Europe would have accept
ed with great alactrity.
As a matter of fact, the Marshall
Plan—or, as it is called now, the
ERP (European Recovery Plan) —
is the work of free nations upon
which the State Department did
not exert any pressure, in spite of
the innumerable tricky suggestions
put in the reactionary or isolation
ist press of Hearst and McCormick.
The 1G nations participating in the
ERP have been able to remain
faithful to the economic principles
they were abiding by before enter
ing the agreement, however far
were those principles from the ideas
of capitalistic free enterprise, tradi
tionally dear to this country.
Socialism Required
Socialism in Europe is not a
fancy; it is a necessity which will

have to last as long as deemed nec
essary. While the United States can
always afford to produce more
when she needs more, impover
ished Europe must share, organize,
and distribute the meager quanti
ties available. Socialism can be run
by the old sticklers of the Second
International; it can be shaped by
the Christian Democrats of the new
type, or by both. Socialism can
come to a serious plight as in Swe
den; it may bring fair results as in
Britain; it can have highly success
ful results as in Poland—or in Bel
gium. where Socialist Paul-Henri
Spaak uses smoother, more liberal
methods than in many all-capitalist
