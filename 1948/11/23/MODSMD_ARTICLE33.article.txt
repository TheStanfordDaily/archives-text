WASHINGTONâ€”UnIess automo
bile manufacturers and dealers
take steps to eliminate some of the
trade practices to which the public
is objecting, look for some sort of
control legislation aimed at unscru
pulous elements in the automobile
business to be introduced in the
next Congress.
."John T. M. Reddan, chief counsel
for the House subcommittee to in
vestigate questionable trade prac
tices, says the manufacturers and
dealers could eliminate the prac
tices "overnight if they wanted to."
He says that would be the quick
est way to get action, but that if
conditions are not corrected some j
sort of legislation seems to be the |
answer.
Principal objections made by car |
buyers at a committee hearing were i
aimed at low trade-in allowances !
offered new car buyers, and the :
loading of new cars with accesso- ;
ries.
