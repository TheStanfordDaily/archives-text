WASHINGTO Nâ€”Many wage
earners will find it to their advan
tage to take care of a little tax
matter by Dec. 1.
That is to notify their employers
of any changes in the number of
their income tax exemptions.
The amount of tax withheld from
wages depends upon the number of
exemptions you can claim as well
as the wages you earn. You get a
$500 exemption for yourself, your
wife, and each dependent.
