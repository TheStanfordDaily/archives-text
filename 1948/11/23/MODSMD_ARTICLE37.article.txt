# OKLAHOMA NEXT?

WASHINGTON â€” Wets are pre
dicting Oklahoma will be the next
state to vote repeal of statewide
prohibition.
They claim that the action of
Kansas in voting to repeal its con
stitutional ban on liquor has
strengthened the wet movement in
Oklahoma and that the State Legis-

lature probably will take action
this winter to submit a repeal ref
erendum to the voters.
For several years Oklahoma.
Kansas, and Mississippi have been
the only so-called 100 per cent dry
states, with statewide bans on sales
of distilled spirits.
Before Kansas actually becomcs
wet, the Legislature has to repeal a
dry statute which makes a person
possessing ?my amount of intoxi
cating liquor a law violator.
