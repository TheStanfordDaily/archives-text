# Men's Rest Home Gives Aid, Comfort to Ailing Students
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
"Oh, my achin' back!
"This cold is miserable. If I were only home, I could shake
:his confounded sick-bug off in no time."
These complaints are voiced by scores of afflicted students
:hese cold mornings. It was just this type of complaint that

prompted members of the Stanford
Mothers' Club to begin working for
•he establishment of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes.
The idea was conceived 25 years
igo by Mrs. Edwin Thomas of Palo
Alto, who believed that there
should be some residence to which
-tudents could go when tliey were
mildly ill, but not sick enough for
the hospital.
Mothers' C!ub members asked
various people to care for their boys
in a manner similar to what they
tcould expect at home. For a while
some women did this job at a small
-•ost to the patients.
Health Service Backing
But it was not until the Health
Service started backing this project
about four years ago that perrna
icnt rest homes, fully supplied.
,vere put into operation.
Mrs. E. M. Hoaglund, director of
the Men's Rest Home for the last
our years, tells of the care of an
average patient. First, the student
repoits to the Health Service and
the doctor sends him to the rest
Tome if he has some minor ailment
such as influenza or poison oak.
Basic home nursing is practiced by
Mrs. Hoaglund and her chief aide,
Vlrs. Ethel Butler. A doctor makes
laily calls and dismisses the pa
ients himself.
According to Director Hoaglund.
he boys spend most of their time
studying and sleeping, "the medi
cine which cures everyone."
She recalls how one fellow re
narked that the home would be a
.'rand place to study for finals, with
10 typewriters clicking or radios
blaring.
"That person." Mrs. Hoaglund
stated, "actually got sick during
lead week. When he recovered and
eft the rest home, he said he was
jetter prepared for exams than
•vet* before.
Home-Cooked Meals
"Fellows who stay here are al
vavs impressed with the three
ionic-cooked meals per day, seven
lays a week, schedule which we
oliow. They always joke about
neakfast in bed. and often wonder
vhen there will be an exchange
linnet* with the Women's Rest
lome. It's never been done."
Special favors such as furnishing

reading materials, decks of cards,
and special foods for patients on a
diet always are appreciated by the
students.
"We have many friends who re
turn to thank us for the things
we've done for them," says Mrs.
Hoaglund. "The Rest Home alumni
often send flowers, cards, and candy
as tokens of their appreciation."
Apparently of a strong constitu
tion. Mother Hoaglund, as she is
sometimes called, has never con
flicted her "adopted sons'" ill
nesses. Care is taken in the use oi
antiseptics in dishwashing and san
itation throughout the three-story
house.
Epidemic of Measles
One summer an epidemic of
measles forced the whole rest home
into a ten-day quarantine. The di
rector will never forget the long,
tedious afternoons spent playing
bridge with her boys in the living
room.
Neither the men's nor the wom
en's rest home allows visitors out
side of the immediate family. But
the story is told of a secret entrance !
into the Women's Rest Home via I
some rose bushes which rise to the j
second - floor windows. It was a
happy invalid who saw the heads of
several of her girl friends peeking
over the windowsill of her bed- j
room window.
Patients in the Women's Rest ;
Home who normally live in Hurl- I
burt House can count on some sere- |
nading by their "sisters," one of the I
old traditions of that house.
Mrs. Hoaglund says that she has
always been impressed most by the I
order and consideration which her
boys have shown when they were i
house guests at her home on Sal
vatierra Street. The combination of
sickness and good home training |
seems to put a temporary stop to I
destructive tendencies sometimes |
shown in other University resi
dences.

"Oh, my achin' back!
"This cold is miserable. If I were only home, I could shake
:his confounded sick-bug off in no time."
These complaints are voiced by scores of afflicted students
:hese cold mornings. It was just this type of complaint that

prompted members of the Stanford
Mothers' Club to begin working for
•he establishment of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes.
The idea was conceived 25 years
igo by Mrs. Edwin Thomas of Palo
Alto, who believed that there
should be some residence to which
-tudents could go when tliey were
mildly ill, but not sick enough for
the hospital.
Mothers' C!ub members asked
various people to care for their boys
in a manner similar to what they
tcould expect at home. For a while
some women did this job at a small
-•ost to the patients.
Health Service Backing
But it was not until the Health
Service started backing this project
about four years ago that perrna
icnt rest homes, fully supplied.
,vere put into operation.
Mrs. E. M. Hoaglund, director of
the Men's Rest Home for the last
our years, tells of the care of an
average patient. First, the student
repoits to the Health Service and
the doctor sends him to the rest
Tome if he has some minor ailment
such as influenza or poison oak.
Basic home nursing is practiced by
Mrs. Hoaglund and her chief aide,
Vlrs. Ethel Butler. A doctor makes
laily calls and dismisses the pa
ients himself.
According to Director Hoaglund.
he boys spend most of their time
studying and sleeping, "the medi
cine which cures everyone."
She recalls how one fellow re
narked that the home would be a
.'rand place to study for finals, with
10 typewriters clicking or radios
blaring.
"That person." Mrs. Hoaglund
stated, "actually got sick during
lead week. When he recovered and
eft the rest home, he said he was
jetter prepared for exams than
•vet* before.
Home-Cooked Meals
"Fellows who stay here are al
vavs impressed with the three
ionic-cooked meals per day, seven
lays a week, schedule which we
oliow. They always joke about
neakfast in bed. and often wonder
vhen there will be an exchange
linnet* with the Women's Rest
lome. It's never been done."
Special favors such as furnishing

reading materials, decks of cards,
and special foods for patients on a
diet always are appreciated by the
students.
"We have many friends who re
turn to thank us for the things
we've done for them," says Mrs.
Hoaglund. "The Rest Home alumni
often send flowers, cards, and candy
as tokens of their appreciation."
Apparently of a strong constitu
tion. Mother Hoaglund, as she is
sometimes called, has never con
flicted her "adopted sons'" ill
nesses. Care is taken in the use oi
antiseptics in dishwashing and san
itation throughout the three-story
house.
Epidemic of Measles
One summer an epidemic of
measles forced the whole rest home
into a ten-day quarantine. The di
rector will never forget the long,
tedious afternoons spent playing
bridge with her boys in the living
room.
Neither the men's nor the wom
en's rest home allows visitors out
side of the immediate family. But
the story is told of a secret entrance !
into the Women's Rest Home via I
some rose bushes which rise to the j
second - floor windows. It was a
happy invalid who saw the heads of
several of her girl friends peeking
over the windowsill of her bed- j
room window.
Patients in the Women's Rest ;
Home who normally live in Hurl- I
burt House can count on some sere- |
nading by their "sisters," one of the I
old traditions of that house.
Mrs. Hoaglund says that she has
always been impressed most by the I
order and consideration which her
boys have shown when they were i
house guests at her home on Sal
vatierra Street. The combination of
sickness and good home training |
seems to put a temporary stop to I
destructive tendencies sometimes |
shown in other University resi
dences.

Rest Home.
"Oh, my achin' back!
"This cold is miserable. If I were only home, I could shake
:his confounded sick-bug off in no time."
These complaints are voiced by scores of afflicted students
:hese cold mornings. It was just this type of complaint that

prompted members of the Stanford
Mothers' Club to begin working for
•he establishment of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes.
The idea was conceived 25 years
igo by Mrs. Edwin Thomas of Palo
Alto, who believed that there
should be some residence to which
-tudents could go when tliey were
mildly ill, but not sick enough for
the hospital.
Mothers' C!ub members asked
various people to care for their boys
in a manner similar to what they
tcould expect at home. For a while
some women did this job at a small
-•ost to the patients.
Health Service Backing
But it was not until the Health
Service started backing this project
about four years ago that perrna
icnt rest homes, fully supplied.
,vere put into operation.
Mrs. E. M. Hoaglund, director of
the Men's Rest Home for the last
our years, tells of the care of an
average patient. First, the student
repoits to the Health Service and
the doctor sends him to the rest
Tome if he has some minor ailment
such as influenza or poison oak.
Basic home nursing is practiced by
Mrs. Hoaglund and her chief aide,
Vlrs. Ethel Butler. A doctor makes
laily calls and dismisses the pa
ients himself.
According to Director Hoaglund.
he boys spend most of their time
studying and sleeping, "the medi
cine which cures everyone."
She recalls how one fellow re
narked that the home would be a
.'rand place to study for finals, with
10 typewriters clicking or radios
blaring.
"That person." Mrs. Hoaglund
stated, "actually got sick during
lead week. When he recovered and
eft the rest home, he said he was
jetter prepared for exams than
•vet* before.
Home-Cooked Meals
"Fellows who stay here are al
vavs impressed with the three
ionic-cooked meals per day, seven
lays a week, schedule which we
oliow. They always joke about
neakfast in bed. and often wonder
vhen there will be an exchange
linnet* with the Women's Rest
lome. It's never been done."
Special favors such as furnishing

reading materials, decks of cards,
and special foods for patients on a
diet always are appreciated by the
students.
"We have many friends who re
turn to thank us for the things
we've done for them," says Mrs.
Hoaglund. "The Rest Home alumni
often send flowers, cards, and candy
as tokens of their appreciation."
Apparently of a strong constitu
tion. Mother Hoaglund, as she is
sometimes called, has never con
flicted her "adopted sons'" ill
nesses. Care is taken in the use oi
antiseptics in dishwashing and san
itation throughout the three-story
house.
Epidemic of Measles
One summer an epidemic of
measles forced the whole rest home
into a ten-day quarantine. The di
rector will never forget the long,
tedious afternoons spent playing
bridge with her boys in the living
room.
Neither the men's nor the wom
en's rest home allows visitors out
side of the immediate family. But
the story is told of a secret entrance !
into the Women's Rest Home via I
some rose bushes which rise to the j
second - floor windows. It was a
happy invalid who saw the heads of
several of her girl friends peeking
over the windowsill of her bed- j
room window.
Patients in the Women's Rest ;
Home who normally live in Hurl- I
burt House can count on some sere- |
nading by their "sisters," one of the I
old traditions of that house.
Mrs. Hoaglund says that she has
always been impressed most by the I
order and consideration which her
boys have shown when they were i
house guests at her home on Sal
vatierra Street. The combination of
sickness and good home training |
seems to put a temporary stop to I
destructive tendencies sometimes |
shown in other University resi
dences.
