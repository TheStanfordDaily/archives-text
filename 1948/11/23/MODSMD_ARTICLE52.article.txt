As the boys and girls trudged out of Strawberry Canyon last Saturday
eve. one thought was on their minds. California had not beaten Stanford.
The Bears had scored more points, to be sure, but the Cards proved them
selves to be every bit as good. However, Cal won its 10th and Stanford
dropped its sixth.
One Big Game performance in particular was typical of the rise-to
the-hcights playing of the Redshirts.
Julian David Field, a slight 150-pound English major from Pauls Valley,
Oklahoma, plpyed the finest game of his career last Saturday. There were
times when he looked as good as any man on the field, including the Ail-
American Jackie Jensen.
Dave Field Sparkles
Having been out of action since the first moments of the Washington
game, Field had to come into the Big Game cold. His hip was still bother
ing him, and he wasn't in the best of shape. But his inspired playing
left nothing to be desired.
His one-handed interception of a Cal pass and the 40-yard runback was
one of the most sparkling plays of the afternoon. Noted most for his
defensive tackling, little Davey demonstrated on that run that he can
also pack the mail.
He was robbed out of a touchdown when the officials used a quick
whistle to discount the Bear fumble which Davey plucked out of the air
to hustle over the goal. Had the play counted, the entire Big Game pic
ture would have been changed.
Field Blasts Jensen
Field was absolutely great on defense. The time he came up fast to
knock Jensen on his golden rumble-seat for a two-yard loss when the
Bears needed three for a first was amazing.
The time he came clear across the field to bowl Jensen out of bounds
to end a run that was dangerously close to going all the way, was a
thing of beauty. How be uses his 150 pounds to do so much damage is a
mystery.
Field is a junior. He will he back for another season of ball, and if
he gets his wish, he'll be playing next year on the days that Stanford
meets California and USC. Those are two teams he wants to beat. More
than any others, that is.
And I sort of hope he'll be playing on those days. His spirit and come
through ability will always be a joy to behold.
Oregon Crying Out Lond
When the university representatives of the 10 PCC Coast schools voted
California into the Rose Bowl, poor Oregon got the go-by. Although
the Webfeet had won more conference games than California, and had
looked just as good against common foes, they didn't get a second thought.
It is said that the 14 to 0 loss to Michigan was held against them. If so,
I wonder just how well California would have handled the Wolverines.
The PCC board missed the bet of the year when they didn't plan to
have a playoff game. To say that it hurts study is silly, because either
team would have had to keep having extensive practice sessions until
New Year's. That is, if they wanted to have a slight chance against
Northwestern.
But the vote was obvious. California had piled up better write-ups
during the season, and so California will go to the Bowl.
