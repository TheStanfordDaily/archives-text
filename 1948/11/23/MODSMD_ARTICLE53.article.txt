| faculty representatives, was an- j

ing was secret and he could not j

Cal and a perfect conference rec- ■
ord, was also in the running.

j ern, whicli was also selected yes-
I terday to appear in Pasadena's j
I Rose Bowl. Northwestern, finishing |
second t"hind unbeaten Michigan
in the Eig Nine, received unani
| mous backing to represent the Mid
i west come New Year's Day.
i Michigan's Wolverines were in- i
; eligible for a return trip to Pasa
i dena because of a conference re- !
j striction that bans anj team from

| appearance in three years.

| ered from the Stanford scare, said:

and our squad that we were se
\ lected. It is a great responsibility
j and we accept it as such. We shail
! do our best win."

j pearance in the Rose Bowl. The
