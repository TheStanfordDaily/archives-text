Dear Mr. Connolly,
In your column of yesterday morning, you criticize Stanford rootc
for bringing in the Oregon issue—a matter totally foreign to them—at t
Big Game. You say you cannot understand the seemingly "morbid deli.nh
that the Stanfords took in embarrassing the Californians in (he light

leaders and were not representative of Stanford's "more discerning el

fans. The Pacific Coast representative, not Stanford, will be our "Ali
Mater" when we huddle over our radios New Year's Day. As PCC par
sans, I think we have as much right as the next fellow to express o
opinions on just who that representative should be.

we believe Oregon would make a better Rose Bowl representative th
the University of California will.

Stanford was beaten by Oregon, 20 to 12, in early October. We we

Dear Mr. Connolly,
