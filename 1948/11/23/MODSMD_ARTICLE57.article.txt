Stanford Braves and Stanford
Frosh will get together for the pre
liminary clash at t>: 15.
Coach Everett Dean, almost having
to revert to a flip of the coin for
his starting lineup, named the first
five men last night. George Yard-
I ley and Bill Hose, both 6 feet 4 inch
j returning lettermen. will handle the
! forward spots.
Steve Starts Third Year
Captain Bill Stephenson, a 6 foot
3 inch hardworking and oft-times
brilliant center, will lead the team
' from his familiar pivot spot.
Dave Davidson, G foot 3 inch
rough-and-tumble guard, and Gus
; Chavalas. 5 foot 10 inches, will draw
i the starting guard assignments.
Pushing the first five for a start
; ing position and expected to see
j plenty of action are Milt Iverson, a
! two-year letterman at forward. Bob
Lewis, two-year letterman at guard,
| and Marv G-elber, a sophomore as
pirant for the guard job.
Alumni Strong This Time
, Stanford Alumni, eager to make
; amends for its 38 to 29 loss of last
! year, has come up with a ball club
j jampacked with talent and expe
! rience.
Led by big Ed Voss at center, the
oldtimers will have a pair of nifty
guards in Don Burness and Babe
Higgins. The forward jobs go to
Donny Williams and Leon LaFaitle.
Hank Luisetti will be on hand for
; the contest, but probably will not
I Play-
Alumni reserves will consist .of
! Bob Penn. Fred Oliver, John Al
tueker, Bones Halstead, John Leddy,
Bob Wensel. Ted Lyon, and Bob
; Burnett, present coach of the Frosh
! cage l-s.
Tonight Stanford will rely on re
serve strength to get past the vet
eran Alumni men. The new accent
i on speed will be obvious, as the

eagers plan to move the ball just as
last as they have been doing in
practice. And that is fast.
As Everett Dean stated. "This is
one night Stanford can't lose. It's
all in the family."
So if you don't mind a crowd,
c'mon out to watch the eagers ring
up the curtain on a the new bas
ket ball season. You will see plenty
ol past, present, and future Stan
ford basketball.
