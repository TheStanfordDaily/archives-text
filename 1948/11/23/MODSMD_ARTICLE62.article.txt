# Card Polo Team Grows To Orange Bowl Stature
## 
### DIXIE ANNE BOOTH 
It was just two years ago that four Stanford who liked
polo got together and decided they were going tot bring the
sport back to the University.
Today, the Association they started without any help from
school officials has some 40 members, including two women's

teams, and has received an invita
tion from the University of Miami
to play a match in the Florida Or
ange Bowl this winter.
The only member of the original
four still active in the Association
is Bill Decker, a junior, who is the
current president. Decker is also
captain of the men's team, playing a
vigorous number three. His bold
drives and hardy strokes are very
effective in aggressive action.
The number one position, which
requires an exceptionally sure,
powerful shot, is being handled this
season bv Tom Shartle, Rufus Hay
den, and Mickey Seeley. The num
ber two players, in what is usually
the most active post on the field,
are Phil Roos and Lynn Madlyner.
Highly vulnerable goal defense is
the job of number fours John
Crown and Bill Roos.
Central Valley Match
The team, whose ponies have
been provided by Mr. Allen Ross of
the Stanford Riding School for the
last two years, will ride against
Central Valley on the home field
Sunday. The '49 schedule also in
cludes a match with San Mateo on
Dec. 5, and a game with the New
Mexico Military Institute March 26,
in addition to the University of
Miami clash on Jan. 16. The play
ers will fly to the Florida game, all
expenses paid, with mounts being
supplied by their hosts.
Decker met the coach of the
Miami team this summer and con
vinced him that his boys would
have to beat a Pacific Coast team
before claiming the intercollegiate
championship. Miami is currently
rated one of the top college teams
in the country.
Bay Area and Northern Califor
nia to-mc Stanford club
last year in its first season of out
sue ihe veteran Palo
Alto Ranchers, especially, gained a
hearty respect for the student play
ers after losing several games to the
new team.
ROTC Polo
Prior to the war, polo at Stanford
was conducted by the ROTC and
limited strictly to men. Now. be
ginning and advanced classes are
sponsored by the University physi
cal education departments, and As
sociation sessions are held every
Saturday morning. Bill Decker
coaches all the courses, which are
given at,the Riding School for both
men and women.
