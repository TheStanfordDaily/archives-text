# Excom Reviews New Toyon Proportional Housing Plan
## 
### 
Excom approved the Men's* Housing Committee report at a
special meeting yesterday afternoon. Spirited discussion of a
special priority in Toyon Hall for foreign students preceded the
final vote, and the final vote was made on the provision
Excom appoint a special committee to examine the justice o!

granting a special ratio of rooms ir
Toyon to foreign students.
The controversy developed ovei
the allocation of vacancies at Toyor
for winter quarter. Rajenda Vikram
singh, student from India, said tha>
inasmuch as the ASSU was doing ah
it could for foreign students as evi
denced in the Foreign Scholarship
Program, a special priority should,
be given to foreign students so that
they could move on campus.
"Not Out of lane"'
Vikramsingh said the request did
not seem out of line since the eating
clubs were given a 20 per cent pri
ority.
Frank King, off-campus member o
the Housing Committee, replied th; .
a special priority would seem to di>-
criminate in favor of the foreign stu
dents. He said there was no segrt
gation at present and the foreigi
students as part of the student bod.
should be treated as anyone else.
Ted Norton explained that th
eating clubs' slight priority in Toyoi
is misunderstood. He pointed ou
that before the war the clubs wert
on an equal tooting with the fra
ternities—with the exception that
the University owned the place the>
lived in. Before the postwar expan
sion of the University, eating clubs
were given preference to rooms in
Toyon.
Postwar Situation
After the war, Norton pointed out.
the eating clubs were all but oblit
erated from campus life. Their sep
arate dining halls had been con
demned by the University and carted
away. With the postwar influx ot
students, the University could no
longer give the preference to eating
clubs that formerly was the case
But the very least they could do wac
to give the eatig clubs a 20 per cent
preference in vacancies in Toyon—
as against 80 per cent for the Vil
lage and off-campus students. Nor
ton said.
Similar Case
Daily Editor Tom Self pointed out
that the University made similar
concessions to sororities when they
were suspended from campus.
Excom Member Tom Armstrong
said that the position of foreign stu
dents at Stanford is in a period of
flux; i.e. the pre-reg and orienta
tion programs, etc., are not definitely
set as a standard. He said that Ex
com did not have the facts to settle
the question right away, and moved
for passage of the Housing Commit
tee report with the provision that a
committee be appointed to investi
gate the justice of a special priority
