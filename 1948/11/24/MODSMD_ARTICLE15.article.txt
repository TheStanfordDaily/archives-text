# Wheels for the Average Rough Seen in the Davis
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
(Editor's Note: After hearing; that the new three-wheel Davis car will
be on display this weekend in Palo Alto, we asked George Velliotcs to
write about bis experience with the little bug. George drives a big
Packard himself, so bis appraisal of the Davis car is iUiuitiuatin?.)

Many college students have the feeling that to be without
"wheels" is to make college life relatively empty. That's not

true. The only thing not having a
car will do to you is to make your
life at college empty of relatively
poor grades.
But if you insist that you have a
car at college, the new, intriguing
Davis may prove the answer.
With its metallic, unscrewable, re
movable, convertible, leave-it-in
the-garage top, the car still measures
less than five feet in height. It is
14 feet long.
The Davis is the first successful
three-wheeled auto; one in front
and two in back. It's as safe as a
tegular four-wheel car. Everyone
should approve of the idea of cutting
lire upkeep by 25 per cent. Women
Uiink it's "cute."
A 60-horsepower engine gives 35
to 50 miles per gallon, extra oil con
sumption, and power to climb steep
est hills.
This little trq/fic terrier is the most
completely streamlined car this
writer has seen. Push button doors
aren't even the beginning. Inside
and out, the Davis seems years ahead

in Junctional design. The design
embodies aircraft engineering prin
ciples: the aluminum body blends
with the air flow's motion to decrease
resistance to a minimum. There's
true beauty of contour to the car.
Aluminum Panels
The body is composed of inter
locking aluminum panels; thus, i!
one part of the car is dented, there
will be no necessity for overhauling
the whole chassis. There is more
leg room than the average car af
fords.
This writer drove' in the Davis at
the factory in Southern California
before school began. It was an en
joyable experience. The "test driver"
nonchalantly revved the car up to
50 m.p.h. (maximum is 100) down
a narrow paved road with a dirt
embankment rising steeply to the
right. At a high speed the car wib
driven up the embankment, and
there it traveled at a 45-degree angle
on its three wheels.
A lull-sized car, the Davis turns
a complete circle in a 13-loot radnu
and can practically make a double -
circle turn within the space required
for a one-circle turn of the conven
tional car.
Aircraft production techniques of
panelization, assembly line, and
aluminum materials (the car weighs
about 1.450 pounds) are supposed U
cut expenses so low that the dream
car is purehaseable lor $995 f.o.b.
Van Nuys.
Extras
All extras will run the price to a
maximum of about $1,200 — radio,
automatic jacks and installation,
special seat covers, and taxes.
Even so, this car promises to
answer the problems of thousands
of American college students who
cannot afford the exorbitant prices
charged for other new cars.
If things go according to schedule,
dealers' show models will be on gen
eral display about January through
out California. However, there will
be a Palo Alto showing next Satur
day, Sunday, and Monday.

But if you insist that you have a
car at college, the new, intriguing
Davis may prove the answer.
With its metallic, unscrewable, re
movable, convertible, leave-it-in
the-garage top, the car still measures
less than five feet in height. It is
14 feet long.
The Davis is the first successful
three-wheeled auto; one in front
and two in back. It's as safe as a
tegular four-wheel car. Everyone
should approve of the idea of cutting
lire upkeep by 25 per cent. Women
Uiink it's "cute."
A 60-horsepower engine gives 35
to 50 miles per gallon, extra oil con
sumption, and power to climb steep
est hills.
This little trq/fic terrier is the most
completely streamlined car this
writer has seen. Push button doors
aren't even the beginning. Inside
and out, the Davis seems years ahead

in Junctional design. The design
embodies aircraft engineering prin
ciples: the aluminum body blends
with the air flow's motion to decrease
resistance to a minimum. There's
true beauty of contour to the car.
Aluminum Panels
The body is composed of inter
locking aluminum panels; thus, i!
one part of the car is dented, there
will be no necessity for overhauling
the whole chassis. There is more
leg room than the average car af
fords.
This writer drove' in the Davis at
the factory in Southern California
before school began. It was an en
joyable experience. The "test driver"
nonchalantly revved the car up to
50 m.p.h. (maximum is 100) down
a narrow paved road with a dirt
embankment rising steeply to the
right. At a high speed the car wib
driven up the embankment, and
there it traveled at a 45-degree angle
on its three wheels.
A lull-sized car, the Davis turns
a complete circle in a 13-loot radnu
and can practically make a double -
circle turn within the space required
for a one-circle turn of the conven
tional car.
Aircraft production techniques of
panelization, assembly line, and
aluminum materials (the car weighs
about 1.450 pounds) are supposed U
cut expenses so low that the dream
car is purehaseable lor $995 f.o.b.
Van Nuys.
Extras
All extras will run the price to a
maximum of about $1,200 — radio,
automatic jacks and installation,
special seat covers, and taxes.
Even so, this car promises to
answer the problems of thousands
of American college students who
cannot afford the exorbitant prices
charged for other new cars.
If things go according to schedule,
dealers' show models will be on gen
eral display about January through
out California. However, there will
be a Palo Alto showing next Satur
day, Sunday, and Monday.
(Editor's Note: After hearing; that the new three-wheel Davis car will
be on display this weekend in Palo Alto, we asked George Velliotcs to
write about bis experience with the little bug. George drives a big
Packard himself, so bis appraisal of the Davis car is iUiuitiuatin?.)

"wheels" is to make college life relatively empty. That's not

true. The only thing not having a
