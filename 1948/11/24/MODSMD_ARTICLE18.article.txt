## The 						Eating Clubs 
### 
The most misunderstood, most maligned, and shabbily treated
organizations at Stanford are the eating clubs.
Even their slight preference for rooms at Toyon is misunder
stood. Rajendra Vikramsingh called the 20 per cent priority to
eating clubs undemocratic at Excom yesterday. He, of course,
did not understand the position of the eating clubs.
The eating clubs have suffered badly as the result of the Uni
versity's expansion with the postwar boom in education.
Before the war, the clubs held equal footing with the fra
ternities—with the exception that the University owned the
'iiving spaces of the eating clubs. The clubs owned their own
dining halls adjacent to Encina Commons.
After the war, eating club members returned to Stanford to
iind their dining halls condemned and hauled away to decay
behind the ROTC stables. With the great influx of students, the
University could no longer grant the clubs preference to rooms
in Toyon and Branner. As a matter of fact, the eating clubs were
all but erased from the campus scene as the then dean of men
was not in favor of their revival. Only alumni pressure saved
their existence at all.
To partly make up for a great wrong, the University granted
the eating clubs a 20 per cent priority to room vacancies in
Toyon. The clubs were given private tables in Toyon, wholly
inadequate, by the way.
The rivalry between the Row and Clubs was once a healthy
situation on the Farm. The clubs offered a less formal organ
ization for the Roughs who didn't care to join fraternities. The
friendship ties made were, however, no less valuable than
those formed at fraternities.
Now that fraternities are crowded and no longer able to take
in as many new men, there are more men desiring to join eating
clubs. They and the eating clubs be encouraged by
the University.
One eating club has plans almost set for building their own
dining hall again. They have received no encouragement from
the University. Another club has a building fund.
We suggest that the long-term plans of the University should
make provision for housing mbre men on campus if the present
high enrollment continues.
But in the meantime, the eating clubs, organizations that are
trying to promote a better manner of living on the Farm, should
be encouraged in every way possible, whether it be extra tables
in Encina Commons, loans for building their dining halls again,
or the possible extension of priorities in Toyon Hall—or Bran
ner, if the girls ever leave.

those formed at fraternities.
Now that fraternities are crowded and no longer able to take
in as many new men, there are more men desiring to join eating
clubs. They and the eating clubs be encouraged by
the University.
One eating club has plans almost set for building their own
dining hall again. They have received no encouragement from
the University. Another club has a building fund.
We suggest that the long-term plans of the University should
make provision for housing mbre men on campus if the present
high enrollment continues.
But in the meantime, the eating clubs, organizations that are
trying to promote a better manner of living on the Farm, should
be encouraged in every way possible, whether it be extra tables
in Encina Commons, loans for building their dining halls again,
or the possible extension of priorities in Toyon Hall—or Bran
ner, if the girls ever leave.
The most misunderstood, most maligned, and shabbily treated
organizations at Stanford are the eating clubs.
Even their slight preference for rooms at Toyon is misunder
stood. Rajendra Vikramsingh called the 20 per cent priority to
eating clubs undemocratic at Excom yesterday. He, of course,
did not understand the position of the eating clubs.
The eating clubs have suffered badly as the result of the Uni
versity's expansion with the postwar boom in education.
Before the war, the clubs held equal footing with the fra
ternities—with the exception that the University owned the
'iiving spaces of the eating clubs. The clubs owned their own
dining halls adjacent to Encina Commons.
After the war, eating club members returned to Stanford to
iind their dining halls condemned and hauled away to decay
behind the ROTC stables. With the great influx of students, the
University could no longer grant the clubs preference to rooms
in Toyon and Branner. As a matter of fact, the eating clubs were
all but erased from the campus scene as the then dean of men
was not in favor of their revival. Only alumni pressure saved
their existence at all.
To partly make up for a great wrong, the University granted
the eating clubs a 20 per cent priority to room vacancies in
Toyon. The clubs were given private tables in Toyon, wholly
inadequate, by the way.
The rivalry between the Row and Clubs was once a healthy
situation on the Farm. The clubs offered a less formal organ
ization for the Roughs who didn't care to join fraternities. The
friendship ties made were, however, no less valuable than
those formed at fraternities.
