# Review Says West Fails To Get Industrial Freedom
## 
### 
The West failed to declare its in
dustrial independence, the Stanford
Law Review says, when it let the
Geneva (Utah) steel plant slip from !
jts grasp.
The Stanford University publica
tion drew this conclusion in a j
lengthy review of the pui'chase of I
the Utah steel mill by the U.S. Steel
Corporation.
It says that wartime construction
of the plant gave the West the op
portunity to develop a mature steel
industry of its own, "and with it a
mature industrial economy."
"Westerners hoped," the article
continued, "that the Geneva plant
would be acquired by an independ- '
ent Western company after the war. I
Such an acquisition would be a long ;
f-tcp toward freeing the West from j
the industrial dominance of Eastern !
firms.
"This expectation was frustrated
by the United States Steel Corpo
ration's purchase of Geneva and the !
more recent acquisition of the con- i
solidated Steel Corporation by U.S. '
Steel's Western subsidiary, Colum- !
bia Steel."
"The article is titled "United j
States Steel's Westward March: A '
Chain Reaction of Concentration." j
jt points out that tremendous capi
tal would be necessary to develop ■
a Western steel industry.
Such financial resources, it con
tinues. "if not assembled by a group I

iof enterprising Western business
i men, could be found only in the
U.S. government, one of the large
j steel companies, or in the Bank of
America." It added:
"Western businessmen were un
willing to assemble and risk the
necessary capital."
Discussing the Supreme Court
decision approving purchase of
Consolidated by Columbia, the U.S.
Steel subsidiary, the article con
! eluded:
"The Corporation (U.S. Steel)
risked over $100 million to bring to
the West a much-needed steel in
dustry—a risk Westerners were un
willing to take. U.S. Steel sought
j Consolidated in order to acquire an
] assured outlet for its Western steel
i production.
"On the one hand, if strict anti
trust policy forbade the acquisition,
the venture might fail.
"On the other hand, to permit the
acquisition would thrust the West
: ern steel industry into its maturity
| dominated by a single company.
'"Choosing the latter alternative
; was a recognition of the fact that
I economic realities may sometimes
I outbalance strict anti-trust policy.
! As Western industrial growth con
tinues, the problem will recur in a
multitude of settings.
"If that growth is to be healthy,
j the West must face and resolve
| dangers and advantages of further
I concentration."
