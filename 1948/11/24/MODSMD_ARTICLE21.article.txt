# Viva La Kiss

### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
A kiss is a noun, both proper and
! common. It only when it gets too j
j common that it is improper.
It is a noun, but is usually used
i as a conjunction, and though sin- j
| gular, it is always used in the '
plural. It is rather more common I
than proper, never declined, and i
agrees with all genders . . . and that
is your English lesson for today,
children.
Probably the most romantic dc- !
scription of a kiss was offered by
H. H. Boyeson: "When my lips
meet thine your very soul is wed
ded into mine." On the other hand
we have Mark Twain's cyincal ob
servation, "Kissing sounds like a
cow dragging its hind feet out of
| a swamp. How romantic! Dr. |
I Henry Gibbons has still another !
j definition. He says it is the ana- j
i tomical juxtaposition of two orbic- '
j ular muscles in a state of contrac- I
J tion.
I guess the definitions of a kiss
I run the gamut. Robert Herrick says
| it is "the sure sweet cement, glue,
and lime of love"; Edmond Rostand
says. " 'Tis a secret told to the
mouth instead of to the ear."
It seems to be a thing of no use |
to one. yet prized by two. It is an i
exchange of microbes. It is the j
baby's right, the lover's privilege, I
| the parent's benison, the hypocrite's I
\ mask. It is the flag of truce in the !
| petty wars of courtship and mar- ;
I riage. It is nothing divided between
j two. It is the only agreeable two- I
laced action. It is a woman's most '
| effective argument. It is what a !
; child receives free, what a young
! man steals, and what an old man j
I buys.
Odds Quoted
Leo Guild, who has figured the j
| odds on practically everything, says j
! the odds you will kiss a girl on the |
| first date are three to one against !
| you. He cxcepts LA girls. There '
jit is an even money bet that if you J
don't kiss them the first date they !
j will kiss you. Well, after all it is
I a smart girl who knows how to '
refuse a kiss without being de- |
prived of it.
The approach of the LA male
might go like this:
"Do you neck?"
"Well, not usually but you've |
| talked me into it."
"Skip it. Took you too long to I
j make up your mind."
The impatient type, you know.
But being that this is leap year j
the gal might be doing the i
prowling:
•'What do you think I'd do if you
j tried to kiss me?"
"I haven't the slightest idea," he
; returns sleepily.
"Aren't you even curious?" she j
i says. That's women, always asking
I questions.
Pause That Refreshes
I guess it has been proven that >
you can't kiss a girl unexpectedly, j
About the closest you can come is j
to kiss her sooner than she thought '
J you would. But you can never tell j
I about women. And even if you '
j can, you shouldn't. Chivalry must
i be kept a'ive. Chivalry, you know
j what it is—a man's inclination to
] defend a woman against every man j
| but himself.
Your kiss is fresh upon my lips. '
I pause—a thought profound! Arc
all men's kisses just the same? Or
should I shop around? E. V. Dur
ling says in his column that a small j
mouth indicates that the possessor, i
if female, is economical and a clever j
handler of household funds, but is j
a little on the chilly side in dem- j
onstrating affection. The large
mouthed female with full lips is j
more extravagant, but also has a ;
capacity for intense affection. The
moral is that if you have a lot of
money your love life will be serene,
S I guess.
A 'Real' Kiss
Some people hold forth that
kissing spreads germs. One prof of ■
my acquaintance, however, claims
that a "real"' kiss should generate
'■ enough heat to exterminate any •
bacteria. Just what he means by a
"real ' kiss he didn't say, but I have
my own ideas, Beituj no authority
| on the matter, though. I will just go |
;on the assumption that professors
i are always right.
A news photo of Gypsy Rose Lee

; kissing tlie man in her life reveals
; that she does it with closed eyelids.
Experts on the subject say this is
| a very pood indication of great af-
I fection. I second Ihe emotion.
It might be depicted a little more
[ clearly thus:
"Why, honey, the boys run after
| my kisses."
"Listen, dearie, after mine they
I.limp."
And that might define a "real"

kiss.
Hie reason kissing is pleasant is
a relatively simple one. I quot<
from a text on the subject: "hen
(the lips) the layer on which nerves
■md blood vessels are contained is
not covered by a thick leathery
; epidermis, but only thinly veiled In
a transparent epithelium."
Well, press your thinly veiled
j epithelium to mine, babe, and we'll
I go on from there.
