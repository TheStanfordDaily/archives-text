## The 						Village Feels Slighted 
### 
To the Editor:
This year a float from Village House 210 won an award in the Bk
Game float parade. This specific cup was the Alumni Perpetual Award,
j Last year this cup was awarded as the major prize and only Sweepstakes
; trophy. There was a second cup this year, however, the Roos Brothers
' perpetual trophy, and the Stanford Daily has given the impression that
; this cup is the award of first importance this year.
i Actually, according to Mimi Dunlap and Walt Moffatt, the float parade
| co-chairmen, the awards are of equal importance, the Alumni cup beinp
! presented with the added provision that the float winning it best typify
the continuing spirit of Stanford.
Inasmuch as the Alumni cup is one of the two top awards, the Village
| Council feels that the publicity for this award ("The perpetual Alumni cup.
jor the second Sweepstakes prize,")—no headline recognition and no men
tion of the Village winner until the middle of the third paragraph of the
story—is misleading and is typical of the continual, though perhaps unin
tentional, slighting of the Village by The Daily.
This is not an isolated incident. Last year a Village team won the Uni
versity basketball championship and received for its triumph bare men
tion on the back page. This is typical of all coverage of Village intra
mural competitions. In addition, election of Village candidates, both for
j house and campus offices, are, if mentioned at all, cursorily dismissed
J despite the eagerness of campus candidates to speak before Village groups
; and to promise their support to the Village for its vote.
The Daily has gone on record as favoring closer relations between the
( campus and the Village, the largest living unit in the University. These
| relations will not be strengthened as long as The Daily continues its
practice of relegating Village activities to an unwarranted secondary
and sometimes bothersome adjunct to Stanford University
WE DON'T ASK FOR TOP BILLING, BUT LET US OCCASIONALLY
CO-STAR.

The Daily is slightly taken aback by the Village Council's letter. The
picture of the Village float published in The Daily cost twice as much as
; the picture of the other sweepstakes winner. The reason the Village

lage 210" would not fit in 30-point italic type, the headline called for
by the night editor.

cup has not been established as long as the perpetual sweepstakes cup.
It was a case of age before beauty.

To the Editor:
This year a float from Village House 210 won an award in the Bk
Game float parade. This specific cup was the Alumni Perpetual Award,
j Last year this cup was awarded as the major prize and only Sweepstakes
; trophy. There was a second cup this year, however, the Roos Brothers
' perpetual trophy, and the Stanford Daily has given the impression that
; this cup is the award of first importance this year.
i Actually, according to Mimi Dunlap and Walt Moffatt, the float parade
| co-chairmen, the awards are of equal importance, the Alumni cup beinp
! presented with the added provision that the float winning it best typify
the continuing spirit of Stanford.
Inasmuch as the Alumni cup is one of the two top awards, the Village
| Council feels that the publicity for this award ("The perpetual Alumni cup.
jor the second Sweepstakes prize,")—no headline recognition and no men
tion of the Village winner until the middle of the third paragraph of the
story—is misleading and is typical of the continual, though perhaps unin
tentional, slighting of the Village by The Daily.
This is not an isolated incident. Last year a Village team won the Uni
versity basketball championship and received for its triumph bare men
tion on the back page. This is typical of all coverage of Village intra
mural competitions. In addition, election of Village candidates, both for
j house and campus offices, are, if mentioned at all, cursorily dismissed
J despite the eagerness of campus candidates to speak before Village groups
; and to promise their support to the Village for its vote.
The Daily has gone on record as favoring closer relations between the
( campus and the Village, the largest living unit in the University. These
| relations will not be strengthened as long as The Daily continues its
practice of relegating Village activities to an unwarranted secondary
and sometimes bothersome adjunct to Stanford University
WE DON'T ASK FOR TOP BILLING, BUT LET US OCCASIONALLY
