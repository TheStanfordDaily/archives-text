# The
						Old Boy Answers Mr. Nath

To the Editor:
We noticed a letter written by Mr. Shaim S. Nath in Monday's Daily
in which the Chaparral was criticized for lack of good taste; especially in
reference to a joke concerning the late Mahatma Gandhi.
We wish to answer Mr. Nath's letter, not in a spirit of objection but
rather in a spirit of clarification.
The joke in question was the following:
"It is reliably reported that Mahatma Gandhi left college because all
the girls were after his pin."
Nath made the statement that the Chaparral . resolved to malign
even the personalities like Gandhi.'
Obviously we had no intention of maligning such a personage as
! and we a fsume a joke as nonsensical and harmless as this
would be received in an open-minded fashion:
Nath went on to say:
As is obvious, the author of that abominable joke took malicious
pleasure in seeing it in print, and, unfortunately.' the Chaparral had
the ignominy of granting that pleasure to the person in question."
As a matter of fact, the author of that particular joke is unknown
to us since we borrowed it from an Eastern humor magazine, but we
\ei\ much doubt that the author "took malicious pleasure" in writing it.
Agreed, that at times we will undoubtedly offend some, but our ohiec
™fr T VCr 10 Create a malici °us type of humor.
Mr. Nath states:
"I had gotten the impression that, for the Chaparral, the world of
experiences was confined to the narrow circle of human weak
limeHght" sh ° rtCOmmgs which this ' humor ' magazine brought into the
We have no reason to censure Mr. Nath for holding such a belief but
denen°l Pe i majority of our readers realize that our humor
fhatwe faZZI r eXP, ° ltlng human weaknesses and shortcomings, and
we filmly believe in tr ying to be funny without hurting anybody.
