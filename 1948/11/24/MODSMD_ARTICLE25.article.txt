Sh»»es in the Cellar?
Sincc IDI2 the Campus Shoe Shop
has been catering to the sole needs
of Stanford students.
Established originally in the Cel
lar, the shop later moved to "near j
the post office," and finally to its ;
present location in 1930.
A 1 Delyon, Maurice's uncle, I
owned and operated the shop for ;
33 years until 1945. Since then j
Maurice Delyon has owned and op- :
orated the establishment.
Saddles Out
"Saddle shoes are dying out," j
said Delyon. "The loafer and 'flats' j
are replacing them." He observed j
:hat the most popular men's shoe is
the winged - tipped, Scotch grain ;
type. Loafers and ballet slippers ;
share honors for the first choice •
among co-eds.
Recalling the days when the shop !
employed a bootblack, the cobbler ,
observed, "It is a novelty to have j
someone ask for a shoe shine now- j
adays. Before the war, everyone j
nad their shoes shined." However, j
the sale of shoe polish has increased :
.-ince then. Brown is the most pop
ular color.
Eighty per cent of the repairs are j
for half-soles and heels. After in- j
stalling a new spray, Delyon said i
that he will be able to dye and tint
women's suede and leather shoes.
Fix Anything;
Aside from shoe repair, the shop
also fixes leather binders, purses.

belts, suspenders, and "cuts down
I boots."
'"Most people must be right-foot
| ed," said Del yon. '"The right shoe
|is usually the most worn and
scuffed."
The shoe shop is open daily from
8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and till noon on
