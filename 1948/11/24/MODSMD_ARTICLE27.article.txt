# (REFUSED PUBLICATION AS "LETTER TO EDITOR")
## Due to Lack of Space DAILY'S ETHICS QUESTIONED 
### 
November 17 x 1948.
To the Editor:
If enough indignation is stirred up by Tuesday's editorial, it may
result in a salutary change in the offensive and undemocratic atti
tude which is too often expressed in The Daily. We hope that
Stanford students and faculty are alive to the issue of the principles
involved, entirely apart from the question of political sympathies.
There are several points on which we feel The Daily errs. First,
there is the intemperate and discourteous editorial in reply to the
civil letter of the Stanford Young Progressives. Whether or not
one has the slightest interest in this organization, one cannot help
but ask some disturbing questions. May only "approved" student
groups have the use ol space in The Daily without being subject
U) defamatory attack? Is The Daily the organization that does
the approving? Is The Daily the personal vehicle of a handful of
students who are at liberty to gratuitously stigmatize the other
students?
The editor's attempt to assay the motives of the student group in
question is unworthy of Stanford and, as gutter journalism, should
not be tolerated. A student should automatically be judged EN
TIRELY on the merits of his proposal and not on fictitious motives
attributed to him by the editor.
We feel that The Daily belongs to the whole student body ;ind
that its columns should be open to ALL points of view, whether
majority or minority. WITHOUT improper editorial comment. The
rest of us can draw our own conclusions when we're presented with
the facts. We don't need to look at issues through the personal
prejudices of the few Daily editors. In the present instance, we feel
that the editors of The Dnily, itself, would be delinquent if this
evidence of bad taste were not expunged by an honest public
apology.
Secondly, we are griped almost beyond words at the colossal
gall ol the editor who, as in previous instances, undertakes to speak
for ALL students. The Daily may be his (or her) private means
of expression and entirely outside of student control, but let him
(or her) have the plain decency to speak only for the handful of
Daily editors unless some honest, objective means has been used
to discover student opinion.
The undersigned are all graduate students, of various political
affiliations.

groups have the use ol space in The Daily without being subject
U) defamatory attack? Is The Daily the organization that does
the approving? Is The Daily the personal vehicle of a handful of
students who are at liberty to gratuitously stigmatize the other
students?
The editor's attempt to assay the motives of the student group in
question is unworthy of Stanford and, as gutter journalism, should
not be tolerated. A student should automatically be judged EN
TIRELY on the merits of his proposal and not on fictitious motives
attributed to him by the editor.
We feel that The Daily belongs to the whole student body ;ind
that its columns should be open to ALL points of view, whether
majority or minority. WITHOUT improper editorial comment. The
rest of us can draw our own conclusions when we're presented with
the facts. We don't need to look at issues through the personal
prejudices of the few Daily editors. In the present instance, we feel
that the editors of The Dnily, itself, would be delinquent if this
evidence of bad taste were not expunged by an honest public
apology.
Secondly, we are griped almost beyond words at the colossal
gall ol the editor who, as in previous instances, undertakes to speak
for ALL students. The Daily may be his (or her) private means
of expression and entirely outside of student control, but let him
(or her) have the plain decency to speak only for the handful of
Daily editors unless some honest, objective means has been used
to discover student opinion.
The undersigned are all graduate students, of various political
affiliations.

To the Editor:
If enough indignation is stirred up by Tuesday's editorial, it may
result in a salutary change in the offensive and undemocratic atti
tude which is too often expressed in The Daily. We hope that
Stanford students and faculty are alive to the issue of the principles
involved, entirely apart from the question of political sympathies.
There are several points on which we feel The Daily errs. First,
there is the intemperate and discourteous editorial in reply to the
civil letter of the Stanford Young Progressives. Whether or not
one has the slightest interest in this organization, one cannot help
but ask some disturbing questions. May only "approved" student
groups have the use ol space in The Daily without being subject
U) defamatory attack? Is The Daily the organization that does
the approving? Is The Daily the personal vehicle of a handful of
students who are at liberty to gratuitously stigmatize the other
students?
