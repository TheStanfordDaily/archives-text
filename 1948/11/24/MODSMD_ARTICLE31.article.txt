# Melchior, Brent, Powell Fail to Save Weak Plot as 'Luxury Liner' Flops
## 
### 
Any passengers on MGM's "Lux
viry Liner" are likely to pet awfully
seasick. Sailing on a sticky pep
permint sea. "Luxury Liner" is
about os exciting as an "eight o'-
clock."
Producer Pasternak seems to be
getting into a rut. Jane Powell,
Lauritz Melchior. and Xavier Cugat
(all of whom have been in Mr. Pas
ternak s last three or four pictures)
are joined by George Brent and
Francis Gifford in this musical
comedy which is neither very mu
sical nor very funny.
Beer. Beer, Beer
Melchior drinks so many beers
lie might have been posing for a
Sehlitz advertisement. Perhaps in
fluenced by the beers, he breaks
from classical music into a horrible
rendition of "modern music." How
ever. the high spot (and possibly
only spot) of the picture is his an
tagonistic duet with Maria Koshetz.
One gets a sneaking suspicion
that perhaps the technicolor isn't
technicolor at all—just the screen
blushing because of the picture's
plot.
It concerns a ship captain
(George Brent) who wears white
uniforms with thick gold braid and
has a stern, resolute jaw, his sweet
teen-age daughter (Jane Powell)
who stows away without Daddy's
permission, ond their many ship
board acquaintances.
I\lelchior Makes Appearance
These include opera singer Mel
chior, lonely passenger GifTord,
and orchestra leader Cugat with
his übiquitous Chihuahua.
After 90 minutes of predictable
complications everyone miraculous

ly discovers lie's in love with the
| right person at last, and with the
whole cast breaking into song the
i audience can sneak out of the the-
I ater. ;
"Luxury Liner" is one of those
frothy pieces of entertainment des
j ignated as "light summer fare." But
t after all, it's still November.— Al
