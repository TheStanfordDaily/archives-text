# Braves Stage Late Spurt To Overcome Frosh Lead
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Pulling away in the final quarter, j
the experienced Stanford Braves |
toppled the frosh, 45 to 29, last night j
in the Pavilion. Gay Bryan, jayvee |
:lash, was high point man with 14
digits.
Superior Brave height and speed
gave them continued ball control
throughout the game. These two i
factors were the te'ling elements in ,
he victory over the "greenies."
The game started slow with both
teams failing to hit easy shots. The ;
score switched back and forth with
-.very point. Half-time readings
showed the frosh behind 17 to 18. j
Tom Glikbarg, frosh game captain
and guard, played tight defensive
ball; while Dave Atcheson, sky
scraper center, worked well in the

key for the upperclassmen.
Continuing their ball control off
the backboard and on the floor, the
Braves fought off an early yearling
second - half spurt. It was Bruce
Iverson with a free throw and a
pretty one-hander, followed by Jim
Walsh's perfect set-up execution
and another gift shot, that put the
freshmen ahead 26 to 24. From then
on the Braves started connecting
with accuracy. They were particu
larly effective from the corners and
with fast dribble-in shots under the
basket.
Totals showed the Braves with
18 goals, nine free throws, and 13
fouls. The frosh quintet ended up
with 11 goals, seven free ones, and
10 miscues. Scoring on the jayvees
was distributed among Bryan, 14;
Bob Mattson, six; Jack Scharfen,
five; Dave Atcheson and Fran Wat
son, four; Clay Janssen, Bill Her
ron, Bob Anderson, Dick Clegg, and
Pete Layman, two; and Bob Swing
ley and Dushan Angius, one apiece.
For the '52ers, Jim Walsh led the
point parade with 10 markers, fol
lowed by Bruce Iverson, seven;
Gary Andrews, three; Karl Davis,
Ralph Dixon, Tom Glikbarg, and
Don Stewart, all two; and Ronnie
Garver, one.
