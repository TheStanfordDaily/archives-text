# Varsity, Braves Open Stanford Cage Season with Double Victory
## Varsity Wallops Alumni In Basket Season Prevue 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity cagers, breezing through their season debut
with ridiculous ease last night, buried the Alumni, 68 to 31.
Everett Dean's fast-moving Redshirts had an easy time of it,
as a full house at the Pavilion watched the disorganized Alumni
try to stay in the contest.
For the first few minutes, the Alumni did make it a contest,

but after that, it was all varsity, j
Big Ed Voss opened the night's
scoring with a free throw and then
added a bucket on a nice fake. That
gave the Alumni a brief 3 to 0 lead.
The varsity came right back, as Bill
Stephenson whipped in a one
handed push shot from the foul I
line, and Rose lied it up with a
free throw.
Babe Higgins put the AlumT\i back
in the lead, 5 to 3, but a Rose <
follow-sbot knotted the count. Rose
added another on a free-throw, and
then Yardley dropped in a follow- j
shot after making a nice body twist, j
That made it 9 to 5, and curtains ;
for the Alumni. From there on it ;
got too easy.
Dean Cleans Bench
Everett Dean benched his regu
lars at the 10-minute mark in the
first half, and then kept them out
of the second half until the last ;
seven minutes. Every man on the
squad got a chance to play last
night, and almost every man scored.
Ed Voss, the alumni pivot, man, i
was high-point man with 11 points,
followed closely by George Yardley j
with nine.
No Test
But the game wasn't a good test j
for the Stanford men. The play was
too loose. Yardley caused a few I
"ahs" with his fancy tip-in work,
and Stephenson looked good while I
he was in. But that wasn't very j
long.
Tonight, Stanford will get a real
test when Hank Luisetti brings his â– 
high-powered Stewart Chevrolet !
quintet into the Pavilion to do bat
tle with the Redshirts.
The Chevrolets have a well
rounded outfit, will be captained
by Babe Higgins, and feature the

great Andy Wolfe. Jack Nichols,
center on Washington's PCC cham
pionship team of last season, will
handle the pivot chores for Stewart.
Luisetti Tutors Chevvics
The Chevrolets will definitely be
out to win this game, as they are
a new team, and are eager to gain
a place in the local basketball pic
ture. Luisetti has been working his
men out three times a week for over
a month, and promises that his squad
will be ready.
The game will get underway at 8
p.m. The preliminary will be the
same as last night, Stanford Frosh
against the Stanford Braves, begin
ning at 6:15. The Braves took an
easy 45 to 29 victory over the
Frosh last night.
Tonight's varsity lineup:
Stanford Pos. Chevrolet
Yardley F G. Walkei
Rose F Cuneo
Stephenson C Nichol?
