YtUntion Daily Sports Writers of future years:
Every year about Big Game time, the sports editor assigns some writer io
he job of looking up the write-ups of past Big Games and writing a
lory about the more exciting and unusual games.
Whatever the year you write, please, please don't overlook the Big
• nines of 19*17 and 1948. You will find the scores recorded as 21 to 18
lul 7 to fi in Cal's favor for these years, but scores seldom tell the
whole truth.
I hope in your search through the dusty files of the Dailys ol years
past, you will by chance run across this column and pass on to your
readers the story of a Stanford team that would never quit trying.
You will, no doubt, have the story of the great 1947 game when Stanford,
i team which had not won a game in eight outings, pushed a 28-point
favorite all over the field only to lose out in the closing minutes. That
game, I'm suie will be passed on through the years to rank with the
1924 20 to 20 tie in Big Game history.
But I want you to tell your readers the story of the team that Stanford
iekled tha next year, a team that came, oh, so close, to registering the
jiggetit upset of the 1948 football season.
Our Mitchell Hetter Than Jensen
Cal has a fellow by the name of Jackie Jensen. He will probably be
named to several All-American teams this year and he deserves the honor,
but if I had my choice between Jensen and our fullback, Emery Mitchell.
1 would take Mitchell. You can draw your own conclusions as to my
opinion about Mitchell's merit for All-American honors.
Mitchell had gained 532 yards in 111 plays up to the time ol his injury
n the Army game. He had a 4.4-yard rushing average. So you can
oe that Mitch was a very valuable man to have around. But he missed
be Cal game and we lost 7 to (j. Wc also lost Don Campbell on the
ipening play. He is a fine defensive man. His passes might have been
he difference in the game.
But back to the Big Game. The Cards were 22-point underdogs for
.his one. Cal was undefeated and untied and a sure thing for a Hose
Bowl bid. I had been with the team from the fust day of practice, had
raveled some 10,000 miles to see them play during the season, and had
teen every game.
I was probably the team's number one fan and follower, yet I choso
rjll by two touchdowns. But this Stanford team wouldn't give up. They
ivent out and met this "great" Bear team and played it oil its feet,
rhey played football the way it should be played. Three or four men
nade each tackle and they hit those Cal men so hard that they caused
.hem to fumble five times.
Worst Officiating of Season
We missed tying the game by one point. One little point. The officiating
vas as bad as I have seen this year. The movies show that Cal's left end
.va.s a yard offside on the play that Jensen ran 17 yards to sot up Cal's
>n!y touchdown. It was fourth and 10 before that play. If the penalty
lad been called it would have been fourth and 15. What a difference
hat would have made.
Wc were robbed again when Dave Field grabbed a Cal fumble in midair
md ran for a TD. The play was called back when the referee, Joe Fleming,
•laimed that he had blown the whistle before the fumble. It was the
quickest whistle that I had ever seen. One of the other officials even
isked Fleming, "Do you mean to say that the whistle had already blown?"
That's the truth, so help me. One of the other officials even called the
tferee wrong on the play; but you don't overrule the ref. Movies show
hat a Cal man intercepted a pass, ran back into the end zone, and stum
bled. His knee hit the one-inch line, if not on the goal line. But the run
ler got up and ran to the seven-yard line from where Jensen made a
ine kick. The question: even if the officials hadn't ruled a safety on the
)lay, would Jensen have been able to get the kick off? He would have
:een backed up against the end of the end zone, 10 yards at the most,
or the ball should have been placed on the one-inch line. I doubt it.
hat would have cut the room to kick from 17 yards to 10.
But the game is over now and Cal has won the Rose Bowl bid via votes.
History will record the game as just another loss. But I want you, you
Daily writer in search for material for a Big Game story, to tell your
.eaders of these two years. Two years in which we lost two games by a
total of four points. Whether you write your story in three, five, or 20
years, bring to mind the story of a bunch of football players who just
would not give up. Thank you.

But back to the Big Game. The Cards were 22-point underdogs for
.his one. Cal was undefeated and untied and a sure thing for a Hose
Bowl bid. I had been with the team from the fust day of practice, had
raveled some 10,000 miles to see them play during the season, and had
teen every game.
I was probably the team's number one fan and follower, yet I choso
rjll by two touchdowns. But this Stanford team wouldn't give up. They
ivent out and met this "great" Bear team and played it oil its feet,
rhey played football the way it should be played. Three or four men
nade each tackle and they hit those Cal men so hard that they caused
.hem to fumble five times.
Worst Officiating of Season
We missed tying the game by one point. One little point. The officiating
vas as bad as I have seen this year. The movies show that Cal's left end
.va.s a yard offside on the play that Jensen ran 17 yards to sot up Cal's
>n!y touchdown. It was fourth and 10 before that play. If the penalty
lad been called it would have been fourth and 15. What a difference
hat would have made.
Wc were robbed again when Dave Field grabbed a Cal fumble in midair
md ran for a TD. The play was called back when the referee, Joe Fleming,
•laimed that he had blown the whistle before the fumble. It was the
quickest whistle that I had ever seen. One of the other officials even
isked Fleming, "Do you mean to say that the whistle had already blown?"
That's the truth, so help me. One of the other officials even called the
tferee wrong on the play; but you don't overrule the ref. Movies show
hat a Cal man intercepted a pass, ran back into the end zone, and stum
bled. His knee hit the one-inch line, if not on the goal line. But the run
ler got up and ran to the seven-yard line from where Jensen made a
ine kick. The question: even if the officials hadn't ruled a safety on the
)lay, would Jensen have been able to get the kick off? He would have
:een backed up against the end of the end zone, 10 yards at the most,
or the ball should have been placed on the one-inch line. I doubt it.
hat would have cut the room to kick from 17 yards to 10.
But the game is over now and Cal has won the Rose Bowl bid via votes.
History will record the game as just another loss. But I want you, you
Daily writer in search for material for a Big Game story, to tell your
.eaders of these two years. Two years in which we lost two games by a
total of four points. Whether you write your story in three, five, or 20
years, bring to mind the story of a bunch of football players who just
would not give up. Thank you.

Whatever the year you write, please, please don't overlook the Big
• nines of 19*17 and 1948. You will find the scores recorded as 21 to 18
lul 7 to fi in Cal's favor for these years, but scores seldom tell the
whole truth.
I hope in your search through the dusty files of the Dailys ol years
past, you will by chance run across this column and pass on to your
readers the story of a Stanford team that would never quit trying.
You will, no doubt, have the story of the great 1947 game when Stanford,
i team which had not won a game in eight outings, pushed a 28-point
favorite all over the field only to lose out in the closing minutes. That
game, I'm suie will be passed on through the years to rank with the
1924 20 to 20 tie in Big Game history.
But I want you to tell your readers the story of the team that Stanford
iekled tha next year, a team that came, oh, so close, to registering the
jiggetit upset of the 1948 football season.
Our Mitchell Hetter Than Jensen
Cal has a fellow by the name of Jackie Jensen. He will probably be
named to several All-American teams this year and he deserves the honor,
but if I had my choice between Jensen and our fullback, Emery Mitchell.

opinion about Mitchell's merit for All-American honors.
Mitchell had gained 532 yards in 111 plays up to the time ol his injury
n the Army game. He had a 4.4-yard rushing average. So you can
oe that Mitch was a very valuable man to have around. But he missed

hat would have cut the room to kick from 17 yards to 10.
But the game is over now and Cal has won the Rose Bowl bid via votes.
History will record the game as just another loss. But I want you, you
Daily writer in search for material for a Big Game story, to tell your
.eaders of these two years. Two years in which we lost two games by a
total of four points. Whether you write your story in three, five, or 20
years, bring to mind the story of a bunch of football players who just
would not give up. Thank you.

YtUntion Daily Sports Writers of future years:
Every year about Big Game time, the sports editor assigns some writer io
he job of looking up the write-ups of past Big Games and writing a
lory about the more exciting and unusual games.
Whatever the year you write, please, please don't overlook the Big
• nines of 19*17 and 1948. You will find the scores recorded as 21 to 18
lul 7 to fi in Cal's favor for these years, but scores seldom tell the
whole truth.
I hope in your search through the dusty files of the Dailys ol years
past, you will by chance run across this column and pass on to your
readers the story of a Stanford team that would never quit trying.
You will, no doubt, have the story of the great 1947 game when Stanford,
i team which had not won a game in eight outings, pushed a 28-point
favorite all over the field only to lose out in the closing minutes. That
game, I'm suie will be passed on through the years to rank with the
1924 20 to 20 tie in Big Game history.
But I want you to tell your readers the story of the team that Stanford
iekled tha next year, a team that came, oh, so close, to registering the
jiggetit upset of the 1948 football season.
Our Mitchell Hetter Than Jensen
Cal has a fellow by the name of Jackie Jensen. He will probably be
named to several All-American teams this year and he deserves the honor,
but if I had my choice between Jensen and our fullback, Emery Mitchell.
1 would take Mitchell. You can draw your own conclusions as to my
opinion about Mitchell's merit for All-American honors.
Mitchell had gained 532 yards in 111 plays up to the time ol his injury
n the Army game. He had a 4.4-yard rushing average. So you can
oe that Mitch was a very valuable man to have around. But he missed
be Cal game and we lost 7 to (j. Wc also lost Don Campbell on the
ipening play. He is a fine defensive man. His passes might have been
he difference in the game.
But back to the Big Game. The Cards were 22-point underdogs for
.his one. Cal was undefeated and untied and a sure thing for a Hose
Bowl bid. I had been with the team from the fust day of practice, had
raveled some 10,000 miles to see them play during the season, and had
teen every game.
I was probably the team's number one fan and follower, yet I choso
rjll by two touchdowns. But this Stanford team wouldn't give up. They
ivent out and met this "great" Bear team and played it oil its feet,
rhey played football the way it should be played. Three or four men
nade each tackle and they hit those Cal men so hard that they caused
.hem to fumble five times.
Worst Officiating of Season
We missed tying the game by one point. One little point. The officiating
vas as bad as I have seen this year. The movies show that Cal's left end
.va.s a yard offside on the play that Jensen ran 17 yards to sot up Cal's
>n!y touchdown. It was fourth and 10 before that play. If the penalty
lad been called it would have been fourth and 15. What a difference
hat would have made.
Wc were robbed again when Dave Field grabbed a Cal fumble in midair
md ran for a TD. The play was called back when the referee, Joe Fleming,
•laimed that he had blown the whistle before the fumble. It was the
quickest whistle that I had ever seen. One of the other officials even
isked Fleming, "Do you mean to say that the whistle had already blown?"
That's the truth, so help me. One of the other officials even called the
tferee wrong on the play; but you don't overrule the ref. Movies show
hat a Cal man intercepted a pass, ran back into the end zone, and stum
bled. His knee hit the one-inch line, if not on the goal line. But the run
ler got up and ran to the seven-yard line from where Jensen made a
ine kick. The question: even if the officials hadn't ruled a safety on the
)lay, would Jensen have been able to get the kick off? He would have
:een backed up against the end of the end zone, 10 yards at the most,
or the ball should have been placed on the one-inch line. I doubt it.
