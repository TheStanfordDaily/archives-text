## 
### 
Michigan's all - conquering Wol
verines maintained their wide lead
in the Associated Press's weekly
football poll. The Big Nine cham
pions received 105 of the 190 first
place ballots and polled 1,726 points
to lead Notre Dame by 103 points.
Army held on to third place,
while North Carolina replaced Cal
ifornia in the fourth spot. Stan
ford's surprisingly strong game
against the Bears accounted a great
deal for the Bears' slip to fifth
place.
Ok'ahoma, Missouri Valley cham
pion, moved into sixth place — a
jump from their eighth-place spot
last week—because of its 60 to 7
massacre of a good Kansas eleven.
Northwestern, the Big Nine's Rose
Bowl representative, was ranked
seventh.
Southern Methodist, the South
west title - holder, also suffered a
slight dip—to eighth—after its close
13 to 6 victory over Baylor. Un
beaten Cletnson clung to its ninth
place rating while unlucky Oregon
moved into the first ten for the first
time this season.
