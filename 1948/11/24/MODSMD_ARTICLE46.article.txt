# Farm, COP Argue Federal Education Subsidy Proposal
## 
### 
Two Stanford debaters, Shepard
Insel and Burt Henson. took an af
firmative view on the question of
federal aid to schools in a debate
with the College of Pacific here
last night, arguing that such aid
was the only way the states could
equalize their educational systems.
Rex Mull and Sheldon Nieolason
of COP supported the negative
view. The debate, one of a series
of home-and-home meetings being
held this year, was staged in Cub
berley Auditorium.
The question was. "Resolved, that
the federal government should
adopt a policy of equalizing educa
tion opportunities in tax-supported
schools by annual grants." Debate
chairman was Jack Mareum.
The Stanford team pointed out
that the states cannot solve their
problems without direct federal
support.
The negative stressed the belief
that additional funds from the fed
eral government will not automati
cally lead to a solution for educa
tional inequality. They argued that
the states are doing much to alle
viate the problem by themselves at
the present time and that federal
interference would be unwise and
wasteful.
Questions from the audience
were discussed by both teams fol
lowing the formal debate.
