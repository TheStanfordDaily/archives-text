A federation of states or war are
the two choices facing Europe to
day. said Dr. Henri Barzun. noted
author and authority on world gov
ernment. in the Tuesday Evening
lecture last night at Memorial Au
ditorium.
''There is no substitution for war
if it is not federation," Dr. Barzun
said. "We must have faith in other
peoples, races, and countries."
to European federation move
ment has been encouraged by the
Marshall Plan, and the fear of Rus
sia.
"In Europe," the speaker said, "it
is either a battle between America
and Russia, or European recovery."
Over - population, unemployment,
an j self-destruction in the last two
wars are the major problems which
have brought the present crisis to
Europe, according to Dr. Barzun.
"Since 1848 the problem of unem

, ployment and population in Europe
has grown," he said. "We need not
fear state socialism in Europe, for
: it began at this time as a remedy
i to thest issues."
In 1930 France offered a plan of
j European federation which was ap
proved by 60 nations. The plan
failed in practice because each na
tion wanted federation for its own
benefit.
"Unfortunately every country ap
plied federation to its own glory.
Germany did it in 1940 and failed;
Russia is attempting it today."
The federation must recognize
; the rights of man and the social
contract, he said.
"It was out of the industrial rev
olution that socialism, liberalism,
j and communism sprang. Today
state socialism prevails throughout
! Central and Western Europe," said
l Dr. Barzun.
