three major West Coast ports have approved a proposed new
contract following its endorsement yesterday by the Waterfront
Employers' Association.

the lengthy Pacific Coast maritime 4
strike. Similar action was taken
yesterday by 6.000 Bay Area long
shoremen and more than 1,200 Se
attle dock workers.

ion spokesman as overwhelming, i

leader, pointed out. however. That
an actual vote on the final contract
will be taken after the men return
to work.

three months—today was the 88th
day—three unions remained with
out contracts. They were the CIO
Marine Cooks, the unaffiliated Ma
rine Firemen, and the CIO Radio !
Operators. Until they reach con- ;
tracts with the employers, the CIO
longshoremen will remain on strike, i
The marine cooks' representatives
met today with the Pacific Ameri
can Steamshio Association. Meet
ings of the firemen and the radio
operators with the employers have
been set tentatively for tomorrow.

said "considerable progress" already
hc>d been made in negotiations with |
the firemen.

reached wtih the three unions.
