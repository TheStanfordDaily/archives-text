# Climbers Scale New Heights
## 
### DAVID CURRY 
Members of the Stanford Alpine
Club bagged three first ascents at
Castle Crags in a frenzy of moun
tain climbing activity over Thanks
giving vacation. The Castle Crags
area, near Mt. Shasta, contains
many unclimbed and unnamed pin
nacles, for the terrain is extremely
rugged and impossible or unsafe for
hikers.
On Friday the party of seven ;
, climbers split into two groups. A !
pinnacle in the southern part of the
crag-massif was climbed by Dave
Harrah (leader), Chuck Crush,
Sherman Lehman, and Bob Trefz
ger. *
Slow Climbing
The 12 - hour ascent included
much high-angle slab and knife
ridge climbing and presented great
route-finding problems. In roping
down, the team had to make one
rapelle of 210 feet. The peak was S
named "Hubris Pinnacle," for the 1
i Greek word meaning "insolence." |
Meanwhile the team of Larry
Taylor, David Curry, and John Lo- !
ean had entered the west side of
the region after tedious hours of '
bushwhacking. They climbed a '
sheer 300-foot pinnacle with direct
aid from the ropes, only to find a
cairn on top indicating a previous ;
ascent.
Triple Climb
The next day, while the Hubris
Pinnacle group rested from their
labors, the team of Taylor, Curry, 1
and Logan made a successful at- i
tempt of a triple summit which they
named "Clock Tower," "French
man's Tower," and"The Chapel."
Descending rapidly, they climbed
up the chimney of a nearby crag,
where their path was impeded by !
snow and ice. By the time they at
tained the summit, the sun was I
sinking behind a distant ridge and ;
the snows of Mt. Shasta glistened
with the Alpeneilow.
Late that night, the seven weary [
climbers, reunited, chanted together J
over their beers their newly adopt- i
ed slogan: "We'll have fun if it I
kills us."

Pinnacle group rested from their
labors, the team of Taylor, Curry, 1
and Logan made a successful at- i
tempt of a triple summit which they
named "Clock Tower," "French
man's Tower," and"The Chapel."
Descending rapidly, they climbed
up the chimney of a nearby crag,
where their path was impeded by !
snow and ice. By the time they at
tained the summit, the sun was I
sinking behind a distant ridge and ;
the snows of Mt. Shasta glistened
with the Alpeneilow.
Late that night, the seven weary [
climbers, reunited, chanted together J
over their beers their newly adopt- i
ed slogan: "We'll have fun if it I
kills us."
