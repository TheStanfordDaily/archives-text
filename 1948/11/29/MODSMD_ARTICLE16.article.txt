# Guns Roar, Rockets Flash; It's the Sunday Night Movies

"Hi-ho, Silver, away!" Cap pistols crack loudly, rooters'
caps fill the air, and the Lone Ranger rides again as mobs oi
Stanford's serious, industrious students cheer wildly. The Sun
day Evening Movies are on again.
In Winter Quarter, 1941, the University tentatively scheduled

silent movies lor four Sunday nights
in Cubberley Auditorium, and since
then the Sunday Movies have be
come a regular feature of Stanford
life. Students'have been educated
by such serials as "Tarzan," "Flash
Gordon 011 Mars," "The Lone
Ranger." "Kit Carson," and"The
Phantom Empire."
Inspired by the serials, many of
the more ingenious theatergoers
have created their own diversions.
Last year Stanford roughs sat in
the balcony blowing giant-size plas
tic bubbles in brilliant colors. When
the Thunder Riders serial was play

ing, several fans came to the movies
in Thunder Riders hats made out
of everything from pie tins to lamp
shades. One freshman girl, who had
been an active Thunder Riders club
member years ago, set the style with
a genuine Thunder Riders cap im
ported from her home town.
Ingenious Roughs
Other balcony roughs dangled
lifelike spider to the main floor as
the girls walked in. Cheering sec
tions have been composed of election
campaigners, Roble hashers, and En
cina freshmen. So common has this
feature become, in fact, that one
frosh, who entered after the feature
had started, stared in amazement at
the quiet auditorium. "My God.
where's the cheering section?" he
demanded.
Silent. 16-millimeter films were
shown until 1943. when talkies were
leatured and the movies were
switched to Mem Aud.
Added Attraction
Friendly picture dealers would
graciously add extra shorts when the
movie manager rented a feature and
serial. Limited time made it impos
sible for the manager to see the bill
before the actual showing, and as a
result, managers and students nearly
acquired ulcers when such pictures
as the sticky-sweet child's story.
"Fluffy-Fluff, a Little Dog." were
among those extra shorts.
In the war years, students slipped
into the Mem Aud between heavy
blackout curtains. Members of the
Army Specialized Training Program
got priority on the seats. Girls rarely
went without dates, and the cheer
ing wasn't as loud. However, when a
particularly horrifying monster ap
peared in a picture, the roughs
would send up a loud cry of "Stan
ford women, rah!'" Women waited
until an even more revolting face
appeared on the screen before reply
ing with "Stanford men, ugh!"
Probably the reason that these
renditions of ancient movies and
third-rate serials have caught the
favor at Stanford is that they give
students the chance to relax com
pletely and raise all kinds of cain.
But perhaps one Stanford pro
fessor offered the most satisfactor\
explanation of their behavior at the
series when he said that "most
Stanford students are sliuhtlv neu
rotic. anvway."
