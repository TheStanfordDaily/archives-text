(In which the editor thinks and speaks for himseU)
Minor annoyances: Why does the post office keep general
delivery mail divided half to the A-M window and half to the
N-Z window? There is always a line at the A-M window, sel
dom one at the N-Z window—the reason being perfectly ob
vious: there are twice as many people whose names begin with
A-M as there are people whose names begin N-Z. If you aren't
convinced, check the Bawlout. Law students are divided A-J
f.nd K-Z, which is about fifty-fifty.
Meanest Persons on Campus: People who "borrow" some
one's bicycle and abandon it after use, sometimes half a mile
from the "borrowing" point.
if you've ever visited a TB sanatorium, if you've ever known
n person who has returned recovered and healthy, from treat
ment for tuberculosis, if you've read anything at all about TB,

its prevention and cure — you know, that
Christmas Seals yet, do so today. A letter
mas Seal program has cut TB deaths 80 per
cent in 44 years. It is a mighty force. If
you haven't mailed in your dollars for
Christmas Seals you, do so today. A letter
addressed to the Santa Clara County Tuber
culosis Association will do if you haven't

-eceived the seals.

We've been asked to say something about illegal' rushing.
We've even received a 7-page letter from a reader who said
he was a non-fraternity man. The gist of his complaint was that
punishment for infractions which prohibits the house from rush
.ng does a great harm to the freshman class as well as to the
fraternity in guestion. Perhaps. But the fraternities were fore
varned of punishments. And they signed an agreement to abide
by the rules this year for sure, definitely, absolutely. And we
hink at least 19 of the 24 fraternities are going to insist that those
lules be backed by action.
