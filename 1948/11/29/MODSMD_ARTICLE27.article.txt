## Notes to You 
### 
Experience is what you have left
iter you've completely forgotten
the girl's name. That's the experi
ence of some of the roughs after
3ig Game.
One of the boys out at the Vil
age was groping for words to ex
plain his date . . . but he didn't
Jind the words he was groping for
where he was looking. Seems his
girl had on one of these new dresses
with the net top with a real de
plete . . . and he had to keep fight
ing of! the flies. One of the swarm
used the old gag, '"My, what a beau
tiful broach that is." Another pipes
ip with, "What a beautiful breach
that is, you mean."
I'll admit it was a flimsy dress she
was wearing, but still, that was sort
of a flimsy excuse for staring too.
She looked like the cover painting
for a story by Hemingway entitled
' Barefoot up to Her Chin." She
was only a fireman's daughter, but
she was no false alarm! It just
goes to show that if all the Big
Game dates were laid end to end
. . . I wouldn't be surprised at all.
(No. no, Dorothy Parker, you stole
it from me.)
In such case my date must havt
been a barber's daughter—she was
always cutting up. Her one intelli
gent remark all evening was, "I'm
tired of dancing . . . let's sip this
one out."
From life's book of tears and
laughter
She'd gained a bit of lore:
'Tis better to have a morning
after,
Than never had a night before.
We really got along fine, though.

Her left eye crosses just like my
right one, so when we looked at
each other we were right in focus.
It was a little hard on the others
who had to jump around to catch
her eye, though, when they wanted
to talk to her.
Another of the boys at the Vil
lage took out one of the Oakland
nurses. Now she has retroacted
and invited him to their monthly
dance over there, which they can
didly call "The Monthly" . . . or
. . . she was only a comedian's
daughter, but she wouldn't stand
for any funny business.
We overheard some of the Cal
students talking to some Redskins
on that campus. Says this spokes
man, "Our team used to be about
the most conceited bunch on the
coast till they got it knocked out
of them. Now they are the best
team on the coast."
In Fort Collins, Colorado, experi
menters at the Colorado State Col
lege slowly killed a pack of white
rats by feeding them a coed's diet.
I read that somewhere. It hasn't
convinced a certain Stanfordite.
During Big Game celebrations, he
took his girl out to dinner ($8.50
steaks) at midnight. Then he picked
her up for breakfast at 5 and she
said she wasn't hungry. This is
what she ate . . . hash browns, two
sunnyside eggs, four strips bacon,
tomato juice, two cups java. and
three hotcakes. What is all this rot
about the weaker sex?
And now we are all back and
blue . . . and we are all broke . . .
and now we remember father . . .
father, a kin you love to touch!

She'd gained a bit of lore:
'Tis better to have a morning
after,
Than never had a night before.
We really got along fine, though.

Her left eye crosses just like my
right one, so when we looked at
each other we were right in focus.
It was a little hard on the others
who had to jump around to catch
her eye, though, when they wanted
to talk to her.
Another of the boys at the Vil
lage took out one of the Oakland
nurses. Now she has retroacted
and invited him to their monthly
dance over there, which they can
didly call "The Monthly" . . . or
. . . she was only a comedian's
daughter, but she wouldn't stand
for any funny business.
We overheard some of the Cal
students talking to some Redskins
on that campus. Says this spokes
man, "Our team used to be about
the most conceited bunch on the
coast till they got it knocked out
of them. Now they are the best
team on the coast."
In Fort Collins, Colorado, experi
menters at the Colorado State Col
lege slowly killed a pack of white
rats by feeding them a coed's diet.
I read that somewhere. It hasn't
convinced a certain Stanfordite.
During Big Game celebrations, he
took his girl out to dinner ($8.50
steaks) at midnight. Then he picked
her up for breakfast at 5 and she
said she wasn't hungry. This is
what she ate . . . hash browns, two
sunnyside eggs, four strips bacon,
tomato juice, two cups java. and
three hotcakes. What is all this rot
about the weaker sex?
And now we are all back and
blue . . . and we are all broke . . .
and now we remember father . . .
father, a kin you love to touch!
Experience is what you have left
iter you've completely forgotten
the girl's name. That's the experi
ence of some of the roughs after
3ig Game.
One of the boys out at the Vil
age was groping for words to ex
plain his date . . . but he didn't
Jind the words he was groping for
where he was looking. Seems his
girl had on one of these new dresses
with the net top with a real de
plete . . . and he had to keep fight
ing of! the flies. One of the swarm
used the old gag, '"My, what a beau
tiful broach that is." Another pipes
ip with, "What a beautiful breach
that is, you mean."
I'll admit it was a flimsy dress she
was wearing, but still, that was sort
of a flimsy excuse for staring too.
She looked like the cover painting
for a story by Hemingway entitled
' Barefoot up to Her Chin." She
was only a fireman's daughter, but
she was no false alarm! It just
goes to show that if all the Big
Game dates were laid end to end
. . . I wouldn't be surprised at all.
(No. no, Dorothy Parker, you stole
it from me.)
In such case my date must havt
been a barber's daughter—she was
always cutting up. Her one intelli
gent remark all evening was, "I'm
tired of dancing . . . let's sip this
one out."
From life's book of tears and
laughter
