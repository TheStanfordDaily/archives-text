28 t/P). — They call it ''fensterln" j
(through the window) in their col
loquial Bavarian dialect and it is
Dan Cupid's Bavarianized way of
courting the lady of your heart.
Bavarians describe it as a night- !
time "sneak-in" visit of the lover,
who frequently uses a ladder to
climb through the window into his I
maiden's chamber.
There are people' in Bavaria who
bitterly oppose "fensterln." They
say the custom is "rude and im
moral," but the younger folk pay
little attention to such talk and
young Toni and his Zenzi still stick
to it.
Recently, three Bavarian maid
ens caused quite a commotion by
reversing their traditional part.
They assumed the role of the
"sneakers-in" in an attempt to visit
the man of their choice.
It happened at Michels-dorf, deep
in the Bavarian forest, according
to newspaper reports. Three per
sons dressed in men's clothing were
caught "fensterln" at the window
of a farmer's son's bedroom and
were mistaken for burglars.
Their noisy escape aroused some
villagers at the local inn who
spread the alarm and joined in pur
suit. Run to earth and captured,
the suspected burglars turned out
to be the daughters of two village
farmers and of the innkeeper.
They explained that all of them
were in love with the farmer's son
and thought they would not be
bothered calling on him in the tra
ditional fashion. In planning the
escapade, however, they did not
considered that fact that male visi
tors at a dauchterless farm house
at night would arouse immediate
suspicion.
The newspapers in reporting the
story speculated that the reversal of
the old custom was a result of the
postwar shortage of men in Ger
many.
