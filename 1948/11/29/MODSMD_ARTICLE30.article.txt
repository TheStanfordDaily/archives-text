NEW YORK, Nov. 28 (/P).—Fifty
eight college , fraternities were
urged yesterday to consider the
"character and personality" of any
prospective member "rather than
his race, color, religion, or nation
ality."
This plea was made by the Na
tional Interfraternity Conference in
a statement to its 58 affiliates, but
at the same time it affirmed the
right of fraternities to determine
qualifications of their members.
Declared the NIA:
"The wisdom or desirability of
social considerations affecting mem
bership, including religious, racial,
or national qualifications, is thus
the concern of the fraternity it
self . . .
"The conference, however, be
lieves that the fraternity system
will flourish better if the character
and personality of the individual
are regarded as paramount, rather
than his race, color, religion, or na
tionality."
At their 40th annual meeting, NIA
delegates voted unofficially in favor
of the ban on Negroes maintained
by most fraternities.
Interest in discrimination was
heightened at the meeting by the
recent suspension by Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity of its Amherst College
chapter because the latter asked a
Negro to join.
Phi Kappa Psi's national execu
tive council will meet here to con
sider that matter.
The NIA statement said it was
recognized "a chapter member may
cast his vote upon discriminatory
considerations" when considering a
candidate for membership.
"He may concede or refuse to
concede to the opinions, or even the
prejudices of his fraternity broth
ers," the statement said. '
