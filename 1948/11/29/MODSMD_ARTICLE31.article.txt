# West European Union To Propose U.S. Pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (/P).—
Creation of a military alliance be
tween the United States and Can
ada and the key nations of Western
Europe is expected to be proposed
to the State Department late this
week by the Western European
Union countries.
This step is about a month behind
the schedule originally projected
by American and European diplo
mats. The delay, officials srid to
day, makes it very unlikely that a
treaty can be completed in time for
formal submission to the Senate in
January.
Authorities speculated that the
proposed pact probably cannot be
made ready for ratification now
until late February or early March
—depending on possible further de
lays as disputed points arise in ne
gotiations.
The aim of the defense arrange
ment is to establish a North Atlan
tic Regional Security System, un
der the United Nations charter. It
would bind together the United
States, Canada, Britain, France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxem
bourg, and several other strategi
cally located countries such as Ice
land, Denmark, and Portugal.
Under Secretary of State Lovett
and diplomats of Canada and the
Western European countries held a
series of "exploratory talks" here
last summer. The broad outlines of
the system were laid down then.
In the fall the five European na
tions comprising the Western Eu
ropean Union formally decided that
they would propose such a pact to
the American government.
There is some belief that the Eu

ropeans may come up with treaty
clauses which will require modi
fication before tliey can be accepted
by the United States. Three chief
points of possible dispute are lore
seen here:
1. Duiaiion of the pact—London
reports say that the proposed pact
drafted by the five European coun
tries is believed to provide for a
50-year alliance. American foreign
policy makers have been thinking
in terms of a more limited time,
possibly 10 or 15 years with the
right of renewal.
2. Scope of the alliance — ?he
United States is prepared to argue
that the treaty will be most useful
if it includes not only the seven
countries primarily involved in ne
gotiating it but also those other na
tions which hold strategic positions
on North Atlantic sea and air lanes.
Some Europeans are understood to
favor a small tight group in the al
liance.
3. Commitment to go to war—the
French are understood to have
taken the lead in urging the West
ern powers to seek the strongest
possible commitment from the
United States to go to war if any
member of the alliance is attacked
by an outside power. The Euro
peans and Americans alike are con
cerned in this connection about
Russia's ultimate aims. The State
Department, however, feels that a
commitment to consult with the
other countries in event of an at
tack is about as far as this country
can go constitutionally in promis
ing action; it may agree to a clause
stating that an attack on one mem
ber shall be considered an attack
on all.
