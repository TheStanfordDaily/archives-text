## Bull Session 
### 
Hang onto your turkey, kiddies, we're off again on the results of another
lost weekend. It's your Monday morning Bull Session Soap Opera. (Au
thor's note: Any resemblance between the following story and the day
time serial "Our Gal Sunday" is probably the result of mixing bourdon

and gin.
But, now to our story. (As they say on the radio.)
ANNOUNCER: It's time for another episode in the
life of "Argyle Sunday, the soxicst girl in town."
Once again we ask you the question: "Can a soxy
young girl find happiness in the big city after spending
her childhood days playing 'footsie'?"
MUSIC: (In romantic mood) "When It's Apple Blos
som Time in Orange, New Jersey."
ANNOUNCER: As the scene opens. Argyle Sunday
and her in-stepfather. Bobby Sox, are discussing Ar
gyle Sunday's marital prospects. First father dis-

cusses them. Then Sunday discusses them. (This is a very discussting
program.) Father speaks.
FATHER: But, Sunday, why don't you settle down with your child
hood sweetheart, Gym Sox?"
SUNDAY: I have thought about it many times, father. But I'm afraid
Gym will never amount to anything.
FATHER: Why, how can you say that, child? Gym Gym Sox is one of the
n cest lellows around here. He's all wool and a yard wide! And he comes
from a fine family. His mother and father are a lovely pair.
SUNDAY: They are not! Everyone in town says they are part of an
odd lot.
FATHER: Be that as it may. I still say that Gym will be a*success. After
all, he has a fine new job with the Boston Red Sox. They say he is being
worn by Ted Williams himself.
SUNDAY: Yes, but think how I will feel after Gym and I are mar
ried. All the rest of the soxy girls will be wedded to fine, home-loving
socks, but my Gym will be traveling around the country on Ted Wil
liams. The other girls will have their husbands, but what will I have?
.... Athlete's foot!
FATHER: Well, child, I've got to marry you oft to somebody. I can't
fifTord to support you any longer. Not while I have to provide for your
poor brother, Archie.
SNDAY: Father, I've got to find out once and for all. What is the
matter with Archie? -
FATHER: I hate to tell you this, daughter, but your brother Archie
is a complete knit-wit.
SUNDAY: A knit-wit! Oh. father. I didn't know. And all these years
I thought he acted that way because he was a heel.
FATHER: No. Sunday, poor Archie has been that way ever since he
c cime out of the mill. He s always been a very sick boy. Several times
we thought he was going to dye. But he always seemed to pull out of it.
And now I have to support him for the rest of his life.
SUNDAY. What a terrible future for you, father. From now on. you'll
be nolhing but an Arch Supporter.
FATHEb: I wont mind that, Sunday, it I can only get you married off.
II you don t marry Gym Sox. who else do you think you can snag?
SUNDAY: How about this smooth gambler who just arrived in town?
He's a pretty slick article.
FATHER: Do you mean Nylon?
SUNDAY: Yes, that's him. Nylon.
FATHER: Catching him may be difficult. After all. nylons are snag
proof!
SUNDAY: Don't worry about me, father. I'll have him on the run in
no time at all. . . .
ANNOUNCER: Don't miss tomorrow's thrilling episode of "Argyle Sun
day, the soxiest girl in town." Will Argyle snag Nylon? Will father still
be an Arch Supporter.' Will Dailey get out of the asylum in time for
Tuesday's deadline?
That last one is a very good question.

gyle Sunday's marital prospects. First father dis-

cusses them. Then Sunday discusses them. (This is a very discussting
program.) Father speaks.
FATHER: But, Sunday, why don't you settle down with your child
hood sweetheart, Gym Sox?"
SUNDAY: I have thought about it many times, father. But I'm afraid
Gym will never amount to anything.
FATHER: Why, how can you say that, child? Gym Gym Sox is one of the
n cest lellows around here. He's all wool and a yard wide! And he comes
from a fine family. His mother and father are a lovely pair.
SUNDAY: They are not! Everyone in town says they are part of an
odd lot.
FATHER: Be that as it may. I still say that Gym will be a*success. After
all, he has a fine new job with the Boston Red Sox. They say he is being
worn by Ted Williams himself.
SUNDAY: Yes, but think how I will feel after Gym and I are mar
ried. All the rest of the soxy girls will be wedded to fine, home-loving
socks, but my Gym will be traveling around the country on Ted Wil
liams. The other girls will have their husbands, but what will I have?
.... Athlete's foot!
FATHER: Well, child, I've got to marry you oft to somebody. I can't
fifTord to support you any longer. Not while I have to provide for your
poor brother, Archie.
SNDAY: Father, I've got to find out once and for all. What is the
matter with Archie? -
FATHER: I hate to tell you this, daughter, but your brother Archie
is a complete knit-wit.
SUNDAY: A knit-wit! Oh. father. I didn't know. And all these years
I thought he acted that way because he was a heel.
FATHER: No. Sunday, poor Archie has been that way ever since he
c cime out of the mill. He s always been a very sick boy. Several times
we thought he was going to dye. But he always seemed to pull out of it.
And now I have to support him for the rest of his life.
SUNDAY. What a terrible future for you, father. From now on. you'll
be nolhing but an Arch Supporter.
FATHEb: I wont mind that, Sunday, it I can only get you married off.
II you don t marry Gym Sox. who else do you think you can snag?
SUNDAY: How about this smooth gambler who just arrived in town?
He's a pretty slick article.
FATHER: Do you mean Nylon?
SUNDAY: Yes, that's him. Nylon.
FATHER: Catching him may be difficult. After all. nylons are snag
proof!
SUNDAY: Don't worry about me, father. I'll have him on the run in
no time at all. . . .
