# Clouds Make Legal Problem
## 
### 
Rainmaking, long the exclusive
domain of medicine men and movie
comedians, is tho subject of a 20-
page student - written article en
tilled "Who Owns the Clouds?" in
Stanford Law School's new publi
cation, the Stanford Law Review.
This is the first of two articles
which were suggested by the par
tial success of the U.S. Weather
Bureau's recent experiments with
rainmaking.
Lawsuit Possible
After squinting at the weather
man, the heavens, and the court
house, the Review says that the
rainmaker who tampers with the
clouds may be in for a lawsuit.
For nobody in particular owns
the clouds, the article asserts. Some
people, however, have rights to the
rainfall that comes from clouds. If
a rainmaker seeds a cloud and
makes it rain elsewhere, a land
owner may sue him for damages
caused by the lack of rain.
The Review admits that the land
owner may have a hard time win
ning a lawsuit because knowledge
of clouds is limited. But as man
gets better control over the weath
er, it may become easier to show
that a rainmaker has stolen some
one else's thunder.
Congratulatory Message
In addition to other technical le
gal articles, the initial issue of the
Review contains congratulatory
messages from Governor Earl War
ren and Chief Justice Phil S. Gib
son of the State Supreme Court;
and a message from the Law Re
view president, Warren Christopher
of Burbank, Calif.
