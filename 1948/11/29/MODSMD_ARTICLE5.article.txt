### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 28 (AP)—
Longshoremen lifted their block
ade of East Coast shipping lanes
! today.
The East Coast AFL Long
shoremen's leader, Joseph P. Ryan,
predicted the new pact would insure
peace along the waterfront "for a
long time to come."
The 65.000 members of Ryan's
union, the International Longshore
: men's Association, voted overwhelm
ingly yesterday to accept the terms
|of the new peace formula. Their
action ended an 18-day-old walkout.
Ports from Maine to Virginia were
j affected.
Dock workers will be back on the
job "all over the Atlantic Coast'' by
| tomorow. Ryan said. Those who re
turned to work today—a holiday—
responded to appeals that only such
I action could save perishables or ex
pedite vital cargoes to their destina
! tions.
The costly East Coast strike piled
up Marshall Plan goods valued at
an estimated $36,000,000.
