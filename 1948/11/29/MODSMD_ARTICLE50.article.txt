Whatever the Stanford frosh
lacked in height and experience
was almost equalized by hustle and
speed as the Cardinal Braves edged
them, 36-31. in a tif4ht contest Wed
nesday night at the Pavilion. The
big difference between the two ag
gregations was the victors' over-all
height, especially that of 6-ft. 5-in.
center Dave Atcheson.
Although Jim Walsh of the Curd
babes and Bob Swingley of the
Braves were the game high-scorers
with nine tallies apiece, diminutive
Ron Garver and Bruce Iverson,
aide.i by Tom Glikbarg. amazed the
spectators with their consistent
diive and court savvy. It was only
when their stamina gave out that
the Braves. deep in reserve
strength, pulled decisively into the
lead.
