# Beware the X-Ray! Warns Nobel Winner
## 
### 
The 15)46 Nobel prize-winner in
physiology warned a Stanford au
dience last night that X-ray treat
ments may cause permanent hered
itary differences in our future gen
erations.
Dr. H. J. Muller, professor of
zoology at Indiana University, said
even brief X-ray exposures used in
abdominal examinations will pro
duce the same kind of damage as
radiation from an exploded atom
bomb, though not to the same de
gree.
Radiation, according to Dr. Mul
ler, is the only known external
agent affecting mutation. The mu
tation frequency is directly in pro
portion to the total dose received,
whether the X-ray treatment is
concentrated or prolonged. No dose
is too small to Jiave some effective
ness.
Dr. Muller stated there is no re
covery from the mutational effect,
even though the reproductive or
gans may retain or apparently re
gain normal function.
Each dose received in a single
fluoroscopic examination of the ab
domen probably carries a 10 per
cent chance of handicapping or kill
ing a descendant, Dr. Muller said.
However, the mutant gene will
probably carry over for several
thousand years before it is fertil
ized.
Dr. Muller said recent findings
indicate that commonly accepted
guides for keeping within "safe" X
ray dosage limits are not reliable.
Important damage, he stressed, can
result to the individual from a rep
etition of doses far too small to give
obvious effects.
The Nobel winner appeared under
sponsorship of the Stanford chapter
jf Sigma Xi, national honorary sci
entific research society.
