Are you as bored as we are with
early South Sea Island brass carv
ings? If so, you'll be delighted with
the December Chaparral which
comes out tomorrow—for no men- j
tion is made of this subject.
However, there is a fascinating ;
article on left - handed Florentine
sculptors, all with their names mis- j
spelled in alphabetical order. We
are running the first six install- j
ments of a discussion of the num- |
ber of cubic feet of vinegar that j
would cover one square inch of a
city the size of Yonkers, New York, j
This singularly interesting issue ,
will be sold on the comers of the j
Quad and in front of the Union and ,
Post Office for the exorbitant sum j
of 25 cents. Forged IDs will be re- j
quired.
