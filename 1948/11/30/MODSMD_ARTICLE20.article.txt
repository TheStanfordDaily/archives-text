BERLIN, Nov. 29 (/P)â€”Russian
backed German Communists began
massing their strength tonight for an
apparent attempt to seize political
control of all Berlin before the elec
tions Sunday in the city's western
sectors.
They announced a rally for to
morrow in the Soviet sector to "take
decisive measures for the protection
of a United Berlin" and called on
all the city's elected bodies and
party leaders to attend.
Anti-Communist leaders promptly
rejected the invitation, denouncing
the meeting as a "scheme to estab
lish a Red dictatorship."
Meanwhile, Col. Frank L. Howley,
U.S. commandant in Berlin, warned
the Communists that "there is not
going to be any violence or revolu
tion." He conceded there may be
some minor trouble during the
voting Sunday.
Marshal Vassily D. Soko!ovsky,
Soviet military governor, accused
the Western Allies of allowing the
elections in the western sectors
solely for the purpose of "splitting"
the city.
Although Berlin's constitution pro
vides for regular municipal elec
tions Dec. 5, Soviet authorities have
forbidden voting in their sector.
Western sources said the Commu
nists fear a sharp drop in their
voting strength.
In letters to the three western
military governors, Sokolovsky said
that Germans who wanted the voting
were engaging in "dangerous activ
ities." He declared:
"The separate elections in the
western sectors aim to enable the
western military authorities to act
uncontrolled and to promote the ac
tivities of anti-democratic and re
actionary elements."
