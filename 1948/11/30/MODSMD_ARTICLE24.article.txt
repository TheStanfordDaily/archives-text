NANKING, Nov. 29 (/Pk — The
Chinese government's Suchow gar
rison was under orders tonight to
sally south to save Nanking and
rescue an entire army group trap
ped by the rampaging Communists,
but gave no indication of heeding
the call.
The fate of this frightened capi
tal may depend on the ability—or
willingness—of the 250.000-man Su
chow force to quit its fortress 211
miles northwest of Nanking.
Latest battlefront dispatches said
the government's 12th army group,
totalling about 140.000 men, was en
circled by Communists 67 miles
south of Suchow and 145 miles
northwest of Nanking. Little de
fense remained on the route to Nan
king.
This group, inferior to the well
equipped Suchow garrison, had
marched from Hankow on the
southwest to help defend Suchow,
onlv to fall into a Red net.
The only details given were that
the group, under Gen. Huang Wei.
was south of the Kwei River, 12
miles south of Communist-held Su
hsien. Communist Gen. Liu Po
cheng was the foe.
(The Communist radio confirmed
identification of the trapped group
and said it comprised 11 divisions
which had already been partly de
stroyed.
(The Communist broadcast, heard
in San Francisco by the Associated
Press, said Huang's group had been
given a "final warning" to surren
der or die. It said several attempts
to break out had failed and the
hungry troops were quarreling over
air-dropped food.)
