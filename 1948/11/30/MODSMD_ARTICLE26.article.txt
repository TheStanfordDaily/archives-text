Everyone who knows Dean Kimpton will tell you that he's
a swell guy. And he is, definitely. He's one of the most ap
proachable. friendly, candid, and understanding deans of men
in the business. And he frankly likes to work with student
problems.
But as always happens when a man of authority is a rational
gent, there are those who take advantage of the fact. And taking
advantage of Dean Kimpton are several fraternities. Their pre
vailing and expressed attitude is that the Dean is such a good
guy they can get away with anything, and the Dean will con
tinue to stand between them and trouble.
They misunderstand the Dean's position. The Dean is sort
of a buffer between students and the administration and all the
outside pressure from alumni groups, reformers, and so on.
But, remember, he's right in the middle. He can't continue to
withstand pressure from the other side unless people are on the
squa*e with him.
When Dean Kimpton came to Stanford, the only attitude to
wards fraternities was a negative one. He promoted the point
of view that the administration should help the fraternities to
become the best system of fraternities in the country. Although
President Tresidder endorsed Dean Kimpton's policy, Shelton
3eatty, Counsellor for Men, went on record that the fraternities
should prove themselves. It is not an unreasonable attitude.
Current criticism of the fraternities at Stanford develops along
ihese lines:
1. iFraternities are not as interested in maintaining a good fra
ternity system as they are in going all out for their individual
house. For example, every fraternity president signed the pledge
stating that he would uphold rushing rules this year. And im
mediately a number of houses violated the rules. Only one
was saddled with a penalty, but it is no secret others were
equally guilty.
2. The University grade averages were released recently, and
again the fraternities were much too low.
3. Some parties are just a little too rugged. To say the least,
more discretion and control is in order.
The present Dean is one of the best friends the fraternities
have. His article below is one of the fairest statements we've
seen on the subject. And it seems to us the fraternities should
begin right now to make the fraternity system at Stanford unques
tionably one of the finest in the country. That means high stand
ards—not only of activities and athletes—but reasonably high
academic standards, and certainly high standards of honor and
conduct.

But, remember, he's right in the middle. He can't continue to
withstand pressure from the other side unless people are on the
squa*e with him.
When Dean Kimpton came to Stanford, the only attitude to
wards fraternities was a negative one. He promoted the point
of view that the administration should help the fraternities to
become the best system of fraternities in the country. Although
President Tresidder endorsed Dean Kimpton's policy, Shelton
3eatty, Counsellor for Men, went on record that the fraternities
should prove themselves. It is not an unreasonable attitude.
Current criticism of the fraternities at Stanford develops along
ihese lines:
1. iFraternities are not as interested in maintaining a good fra
ternity system as they are in going all out for their individual
house. For example, every fraternity president signed the pledge
stating that he would uphold rushing rules this year. And im
mediately a number of houses violated the rules. Only one
was saddled with a penalty, but it is no secret others were
equally guilty.
2. The University grade averages were released recently, and
again the fraternities were much too low.
3. Some parties are just a little too rugged. To say the least,
more discretion and control is in order.
The present Dean is one of the best friends the fraternities
have. His article below is one of the fairest statements we've
seen on the subject. And it seems to us the fraternities should
begin right now to make the fraternity system at Stanford unques
tionably one of the finest in the country. That means high stand
ards—not only of activities and athletes—but reasonably high
academic standards, and certainly high standards of honor and
conduct.
Everyone who knows Dean Kimpton will tell you that he's
a swell guy. And he is, definitely. He's one of the most ap
proachable. friendly, candid, and understanding deans of men
in the business. And he frankly likes to work with student
problems.
But as always happens when a man of authority is a rational
gent, there are those who take advantage of the fact. And taking
advantage of Dean Kimpton are several fraternities. Their pre
vailing and expressed attitude is that the Dean is such a good
guy they can get away with anything, and the Dean will con
tinue to stand between them and trouble.
They misunderstand the Dean's position. The Dean is sort
of a buffer between students and the administration and all the
outside pressure from alumni groups, reformers, and so on.
