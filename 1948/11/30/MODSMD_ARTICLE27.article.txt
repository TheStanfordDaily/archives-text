# Fraternities and Eating Clubs

With I)ean Kimpton")
When I was a student at Stanford, I didn't belong to anything. I was a
fraternity legacy, and during rushing, after I had picked up my room
and told the hoys precisely how I liked my eggs at breakfast, two schools
of thought formed on my becoming a member of the lodge. My school
.'ost. But I never felt during my entire period at Stanford ostracism of
any kind. I knew and liked fraternity and eating club men, and some
of them liked me. I went to house parties and dined often as a guest
at the eating clubs.
This, it seems to me, is the spirit of Stanford and should always be
preserved. The small house living unit provides something needed for
a certain type of boy. He enjoys the close ties, the house activities, and
the social prestige of belonging to a Greek letter society. There are
others who do not want such a close association but do want to be
affiliated with something. The eating clubs, and the unit organization of
our residences, provide this. And then there is the lone wolf who feels
that belonging to anything somehow limits his friendships. Stanford must
keep ali of these possibilities open, it seems to me, and they must be
without prejudice on anybody's part. As it now stands, anybody can
make a iraternity who really wants to, and about 1,125 men on the campus
out of (3,000 have joined. Similarly, the eating clubs are not difficult to
approach, and many of the men who live in the Village eat with their
club at Encina Commons. And there are still lots of men on the campus
who belong to nothing, but have friends everywhere.
The fraternity system at Stanford seems to be going along well. There
arc 24 houses on the campus, and they are all packed. I am critical of
only two things in the system as it now exists. It's still smart to violate
the rushing rules if you can get by with it, and too many fraternity men
stem to think that going plus is a crime against nature. The fraternities
need more pride in their own rules and more solidarity in the enforce
ment of them. \\e have just finished a study on 11 years of fraternity
gradepoint averages, and the boys are way below the all-University, and
even the all-men averages. They are just a trifle above the Encina aver
age, which is the year of adjustment and selection. I don't want to seem
stuffy about this. I would be just as alarmed if no fraternity house
average were less than B. I have seen too many tragic cases recently
ol failure to qualify for the Law School, the Mcdical School, and the
Business School, and I have talked with too many heart-broken parents
ot suspended youngsters to take the matter lightly. This is a University
of high degree, and it is not the smart thing to go minus; the fraternities
are going to have to solve this one.
The eating clubs are badly crowded. All seven of them are pushed
together in one large dining hoom at Encina Commons so that you can
hardly tell where one club ends and another begins. The problem per
haps has no solution in these days of swollen enrollment and high con-
uction costs, but someday a solution will come. In the meantime, the
clubs are doggedly sticking it out.
The independent is having a particularly hard time. Rooms arc hard
to find, and food at restaurants ifc out of this world. But he can always
to an open house at one of the Row houses, or have dinner with a
friend at his eating club.
The winds of freedom have a lot of tough corners to blow around these
days, but they still blow on the Stanford campus.
