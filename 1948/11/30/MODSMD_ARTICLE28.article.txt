The At
Kind Look
Of a You
Girl
You know that to change our
nature is quite beyond our reach.
If we are born a lemon, we cannot
be a peach.
Is there anything anywhere that
hasn t been chosen a pin-up for
something? If there is I haven't
heard of it. There is an Iris Queen
for the 48 Hollywood Iris Show, a
Queen of Love and Beauty at the
St. Louis annual Veiled Prophet
Ball, a queen of the New York
Press Photographers' Ball, a Miss
Secretary for the National Secre
taries' Association, and a "typical"
American girl.
New York artist Paul Meltsner
chose Pat Withington, 25, as the
"typical" American girl. She is
vaguely blonde, a willowy 5 ft. 9 in.
tall, 135 pounds, with classic fea
tures and blue-gray eyes and an
admittedly lazy nature. Stan-ford
woman, rah!
Little Miss America
There is a Little Miss America
now, too, whom the Screen Chil
dren's Guild of Hollywood chooses.
And in Australia there is the
"Loveliest Mother and Child" con
test. Practically every fraternity
has its queen—like the Phi Kap
Dream Girl or Sigma Chi
Sweetheart — and there is even a
smile queen for the Kennewiek
Grape Festival.
Contests have been run to find
Miss Stardust, the Magnificent Doll
(most beautiful working woman re
porter in the U.S.(, Miss Occupa
tion (Tokyo), Valentine Dreams,
Bond Queens, class sweethearts,
Homecoming queens, a Fort Lewis
Canteen Dream Girl, Miss Cheese
cake, a Kiss the Boys Goodbye
Qvieen.
'Zoom Girl'
And there are even imaginations
that run to such lengths as the Ca
nadian soldiers choosing Ann Sher
idan as "the girl from whom we
would most like to have a blood
transfusion" . . . the "Zoom Girl"
as chosen by sailors in the torpedo
shop in San Diego (Lynn Merrick)
. . . the "Queen of Lipstick and
Slipstick" to rule over an engineers'
ball . . . Pamela Blake, pint-sized
starlet, chosen as "the girl we would
most like to share a ration book
with" by air cadets at the Birming
ham South College of Alabama . . .
and Georgia Carroll, now Mrs. Kay
Kyser, got the nod by the Army
Air Corps as their "stop, look at,
and listen to" girl.
America's Wlicatheart
Why, there was even a letter
written to one of the more well
known columnists asking him to do
an interview with a gal known as
"America's Wheatheart." The let
ter was from the Bakery News Bu
reau. But as Mr. Dixon, the col
umnist. says, "Can you imagine a
dame calling herself America's
Wheatheart? Still, you could write
her a love sonnet entitled "The Face
on the Threshing Room Floor" or
serenade her by singing:
"If you aren't true at threshing
time,
I'll knock your chaff off. Wheat
heart mine."
Shorter, Rounder
And things aren't bad enough, but
that no less an authority than Har
ry Conover tells us that the maga
zine cover cuties are getting short
er and rounder.
"When I came into this business
ten years ago," he says,"the ideal
cover girl was five feet eight, and
weighed 115 to 118 pounds. She
had a 22-inch waist, 33-inch bosom,
and 33-inch hips.
"Today she is an inch shorter,
weighs up to 120 pounds, and has a
24 waist, 34 bosom, and 34hips."
My pin-up girl is beautiful
Upon my locker wall,
But the satisfaction that she gives
Is really none at all.
She can't dine or dance with me,
Or pass the time of day;
All she does is hang around.
And help me save my pay.
This!

Shorter, Rounder
And things aren't bad enough, but
that no less an authority than Har
ry Conover tells us that the maga
zine cover cuties are getting short
er and rounder.
"When I came into this business
ten years ago," he says,"the ideal
cover girl was five feet eight, and
weighed 115 to 118 pounds. She
had a 22-inch waist, 33-inch bosom,
and 33-inch hips.
"Today she is an inch shorter,
weighs up to 120 pounds, and has a
24 waist, 34 bosom, and 34hips."
My pin-up girl is beautiful
Upon my locker wall,
But the satisfaction that she gives
Is really none at all.
She can't dine or dance with me,
Or pass the time of day;
All she does is hang around.
And help me save my pay.
This!

America's Wlicatheart
Why, there was even a letter
written to one of the more well
known columnists asking him to do
an interview with a gal known as
"America's Wheatheart." The let
ter was from the Bakery News Bu
reau. But as Mr. Dixon, the col
umnist. says, "Can you imagine a
dame calling herself America's
Wheatheart? Still, you could write
her a love sonnet entitled "The Face
on the Threshing Room Floor" or
serenade her by singing:
"If you aren't true at threshing
time,
I'll knock your chaff off. Wheat
heart mine."
Shorter, Rounder
And things aren't bad enough, but
that no less an authority than Har
ry Conover tells us that the maga
zine cover cuties are getting short
er and rounder.
"When I came into this business
ten years ago," he says,"the ideal
cover girl was five feet eight, and
weighed 115 to 118 pounds. She
had a 22-inch waist, 33-inch bosom,
and 33-inch hips.
"Today she is an inch shorter,
weighs up to 120 pounds, and has a
24 waist, 34 bosom, and 34hips."
My pin-up girl is beautiful
Upon my locker wall,
But the satisfaction that she gives
Is really none at all.
She can't dine or dance with me,
Or pass the time of day;
All she does is hang around.
And help me save my pay.
