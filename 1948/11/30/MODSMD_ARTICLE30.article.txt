# Italians Progress Greatly On Long Road to Recovery
## 
### 
Italy is on her way to recovery—
a long way indeed. From July 25,
1943. when II Duce was overthrown,
to April 18, 1948, the day of the last
national elections, Italy has been
more shaken than any other Euro
pean country: two long, bloody :
years of war foUght on her terri- |
tory from Salerno to Bologna, as I
well as in the mountains of the
north; the close election between

the Royalists
and the Repub
-1 i c a n s which
ended in the ex
ile of Umber to
II; the tension
over Trieste; and
finally, the con
stant threat
cau s g d by a
powerful Com
munist party.
Yet, living con-

ditions in Italy are gradually im
proving: Italy works.
Two years ago, it took a train 18
hours to make a trip between Milan |
and Rome. Today, that time has j
been cut to 10 hours. Italy does not '
need Fascism to have her railroads
run with exactness.
Everywhere, the foreigner is
amazed: if in Britain the recon
struction is slow, not very appar
ent, almost entirely invested in the
export drive, in Italy the endeavors
are more spectacular. Not only are
houses, roads, and bridges repaired,
but new housing for workers as
well as new factories using cheap
hydro power have risen from the
Italian soil.
When Rome was liberated in j
June, 1944. the misery caused by
the war was such that the streets .
were jammed with beggars, people j
in rags, girls in their teens who
were selling themselves for the sake j
of getting food. Today, in the Italy j
of 1948, there are still poor "Scius
cias, but that wretchedness in mass
is no longer to be witnessed. And
the change was brought about with
out the government's hiding any- !
thing from foreigners, as the Fas
cists used to do. At present, Ital- ;
ians are among the best - dressed

people in Europe and can eat again
las in pie - war days: little, but
enough.
The fate of the African colonies—
places for settlement of the surplus
j population—is still undecided, and
' one of the most vital issues in a
i country of nearly 50 millions, in
j creasing by 600.000 every year. But
Italy, as a pay-off. is relieved from
the shortage of manpower which af
flicts the other European countries.
In fact, Italy can even afford to
"export" some of her worke*~~
abroad —to Swedish factories a
Belgian coal mines. In the lattc.
case, the work of the Italian miners
is rewarded by coal deliveries to
; their country.
In the meantime, the well-known
j Fiat cars, the famous Chianti wines,
the rayon scarves and the silk
I stockings of Northern Italy are sold
I in ever-increasing quantities to dol
lar-poor Europe.
Communism is still very strong,
but a hard blow was inflicted upon
!it on April 18. Its ill-inspired at
■ tacks on religion have largely con
| tributed to thcv success of Dc Gas
; peri s Christian Democrats—a pvo
| gressive party which does not ap
peal to the high bourgeoisie, tradi-
I tionallv anti - clerical, but to the
' mass of low-class people, deeply at
tached to their faith. As to the
I rich farmers of Lombardy who, in
j 1946. had voted Communist through
fatalistic idealism, the Pope's con
; demnation of Moscow's doctrines
1 makes them heed again to him, not
j so much as the head of the Roman
Church but as the spiritual leader
! of Italy.
I In many other deluded Italian
j families the truth about deceptive
! Communism is propagated throueh
: the mouths of their soldier sons re-
I turning from captivity in Russia.
Should a new war break out. all
these encouraging results would be
called in question overnight. With
j the 200.000 soldiers allowed by the
j peace treaty and the few outmoded
i naval units generously left by
Great Britain and the United States.
; Italy could do very little to face the
powerful Soviet armies.
