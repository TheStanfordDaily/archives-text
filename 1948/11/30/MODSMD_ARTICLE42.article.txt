## 
### 
Under the direction of Coach
Jack Weiershauser, the Stanford
varsity and frosh track squads will
wind up their fall training program
with a two - day intrasquad meet
starting today at 4 p.m. at the In
dians:' Angell Field.
Although the varsity spikesters
have many stars back from last
year's team, the up - and - coming
frosh are expected to put up quite
a battle. Coach Ray Dean has
assembled a number of excellent
yearling prospects but as yet is

. short of manpower in certain field
| events. However, help is expected

next quarter from some members
of the frosh football squad.
On the varsity side of the ledger,

things are already beginning to
shape up. Bud Held's 215 feet in
the javelin, Otis Chandler's 52 feet
in the shot, and Drew Terramorse's
1:58.9 in the half-mile are typical
of the good marks already recorded
this fall.
After the two - day intrasquad
meet today and tomorrow, both the
varsity and frosh trackmen will
hang up their spikes until winter
quarter, when they will resume
practicing until the regular season
in the spring.
