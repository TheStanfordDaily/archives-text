## Thru Breier's Pipe

There has been a lot of talk about the football team that Stanford will
field next year. Most of the-writers report that the future is "roseate"
and that the Cards will be all-conquering come the 1949 season.
This talk is wholly unfounded in this writer's opinion. Stanford lost
games this year through lack of reserve strength among other things. In
this day of platoons and mass substitution, any winning team with any
schedule at all needs a strong reserve force to back up its first string.
As things stand now, the 1949 Indians will have neither the all-around
strong first team nor adequate reserves. There is a distinct possibility
that we shall lose three of the top four guards, two of four tackles and a
lot of helpful backs.
Any conjecture as to the men returning to play football nine months
hence is, for the most part, guesswork. A lot of the boys are "undecided,"
and a few of them are still entangled with wartime eligbility rules. But
as it stands as of this moment, this is the picture:
Three men —Bob Ghilotti, Bob Rohrer, and Atherton Phleger—have
used up their eligibility and must be counted out. In addition to Rohrer,
Jack McKittrick and Ted Liljenwall may be missing, thus leaving only
Don Fix of the top four guards. Hardly a pleasing situation.
has another year of play remaining, but wants to enter graduate school
and must do so in autumn quarter or wait an entire year. Liljenwall
will have to have his eligibility, cleared up.
A1 Rau may join Pheleger in the missing ranks, thus leaving Gordon
White and Whit Budge of the present team. Rau has one more year of
eligibility but can graduate this year. He, wisely enough, is postponing
his decision as to whether he will or not return until the pressure
of the football season is passed. Reserve tackle Ted Burke has also
run through his eligibility. !
The center position looks to be secure with the return of all three of
the top men. Gene Martin may decide to graduate and thus weaken the
end spots by one more man. My guess is that he will return.
Loss of Backs Not So Serious
Backs to be lost are Bob Anderson, Wayne Erickson, and Mike Durket.
Marty Anderson and A1 Turriziani can return for one more year but it
is likely that neither man will do so. In addition to these backs, Emery
Mitchell and Don Campbell may have* ended their football careers this
year. Those injuries may not allow them to play again.
So it is evident that the Stanford football team is going to need a lot
of help to go any place next year. Where is that aid to come from? Well,
the frosh should supply several boys, but for the most part, those players
will come to the varsity with experience in positions that are already
well stocked.
. I don't think there is a guard or tackle that 'can step into the spots
being vacated and perform as well as the men who played there this
year. That is to say, none of the frosh can be expected to be first-class
varsity material in these positions at the start of the year. Maybe they
can do so after a year on the varsity; but by that time we will have
played some pretty tough opponents.
If JC's Come Through, Watch Out
Another source of material is in the men who have been at schpol,
some even turning out with the team, but who were, either ineligible
to play this season or did not play because it was felt that they shoul*
not use up a year of eligibility playing only a few minutes each game,
Those boys have improved a lot and may go next year. Bruce Van Al
styne and Ted Taylor are two of the men of whom I speak.
And that brings us down to the richest field of new material open to
any college—the junior college transfers. Much of Stanford's success of
this year can be traced to men who came to the Farm after playing JC ball
Ken Rose, Bob White, Don Enberg, Jim Castagnoli, and Rupe Andrews, to
mention a few.
These jaycee transfers are an unknown quantity (and quality) until
they show what they can do on a college team. We had luck in getting
three first-stringers this year. All too often do the boys come to college
with big write-ups and fanfares, only to fail to live up to expectations.
Most coaches have adopted a wait and see policy in regard to transfers.
A strange thing is that this year Stanford did not get a single transfer
in the tackle and guard positions who made the first two or three teams.
Other positions, namely backfield spots, became four or five deep with
fairly good players—but no tackles or guards.
With these facts in mind, it seems as if the future of Stanford football
depends largely on getting three of four top-flight men who can fill the
tackle and guard spots that are going to be hit so hard by graduation. We
will not know the answer to that problem until spring practice or even
until the football season actually begins.
Speaking of the 1949 football season brings to mind the schedule for

next year. It is a beautiful thing
from the standpoint of conference
games and arrangement. Nine games
are scheduled now, and it is prob
able that a tenth contest will be
added—probably with cffie of the
Bay Area teams. This game would
fit into the Sept. 17 open date. •
As it now stands, the Cards will
meet Harvard, Michigan, UCLA,
Washington, Oregon State, Santa
Clara, Southern California, Idaho,
and California, in that order,
games will be played at Stanford
with the exception of the Washington
and USC contests.
