SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 29 (£>).—
California's Rose Bowl team placed
four players on the Associated
Press's 24th annual all-Pacific Coast
football team.
The selections represent the con
sensus of writers, coaches, and oth
er experts from all parts of the Far
West. University of Oregon, which
tied California for the Coast Con
ference championship, undefeated in
league competition, claimed three
positions on the all - star eleven.
Both conference and nonconference
players are eligible.
Three players made the big
mythical team for the second year
in a row. They are Rod Franz, Cal
ifornia guard; Norman Van Brock
iin, Oregon's great pass - throwing
quarterback; and Don Doll, Uni
versity of Southern California half
back. .Franc was a third - team
;

choice in 1946.
Jackie Jensen. California's swift,
hard-hitting fullback, was practi
cally a unanimous selection. Brad
Ecklund, Oregon's fine center, was
a fop-heavy favorite, as was Franz
of California.
