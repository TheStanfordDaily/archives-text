# Varsity Cagers Battle Tough Fresno State Squad Tonight
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Fresno State, boasting its best |
basketball team in history, invades '
the Pavilion tonight to meet Stan
ford's undefeated varsity. Tip-ofi' is
set for 8.
Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam of
pole vault fame, now serving his
second semester as head cage men
tor at Fresno, will bring a veteran
Bulldog quintet onto the local
scene.
Warmerdam favors the zone de
fense, so the Cards will get their
first taste of that type of play to
night. The Bulldogs, making their
first appearance of the season
against Stanford, will be all out to
make up for their 40 to 45 loss of
last season.
Led by a point - making guard,
George Becknell, Fresno State is
said to be much improved over last
season. All of which could make
things difficult for the homebreds.
Bckncll and Cava Score
Becknell has been high point man
at Fresno for the past two years,
and figures to accomplish more of
the same during the coming cam
paign. Fresno's other scoring threat
is A 1 Cava, a fast-moving forward.
Cava busted the CCAA scoring rec
ord last year when he dumped in
30 points against San Diego.
Stanford will be gunning for its
third straight win. Last week, the
Cards ruined the Alumni 68 to 31.
and edged the Stewart Chevrolets
in a 49-48 thriller.
Mid-season Form Already?
Flashing mid-season form, Ever
ett Dean's men have started their
new season with *a bang. The win
aver Stewart Chevrolet was a big
boom to the morale of both the
team and the fans. The Chevies
have one of the finest teams in local
cage circles, but Stanford beat them
in all departments.
The backboard play of the In

dians was particularly outstanding
against Stewart. Bill Stephenson,
George Yardley, Bill Hose, and
Dave Davidson looked impressive
in taking the board play away from
Jack Nichols and Frank Laney, two
characters who usually have all
their own way in that department.
So far, the Stanfords have worked
only against the man-to-man, but
against Fresno State they'll have to
switch their oflense. Everett Dean
will probably start the same combo
that has been on the floor first for
the two previous games. He might
juggle the guards at the last min
ute. but if not, the starting lineups
are:

the Pavilion tonight to meet Stan
ford's undefeated varsity. Tip-ofi' is
set for 8.
Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam of
pole vault fame, now serving his
second semester as head cage men
tor at Fresno, will bring a veteran
Bulldog quintet onto the local
scene.
Warmerdam favors the zone de
fense, so the Cards will get their
first taste of that type of play to
night. The Bulldogs, making their
first appearance of the season
against Stanford, will be all out to
make up for their 40 to 45 loss of
last season.
Led by a point - making guard,
George Becknell, Fresno State is
said to be much improved over last
season. All of which could make
things difficult for the homebreds.
Bckncll and Cava Score
Becknell has been high point man
at Fresno for the past two years,
and figures to accomplish more of
the same during the coming cam
paign. Fresno's other scoring threat
is A 1 Cava, a fast-moving forward.
Cava busted the CCAA scoring rec
ord last year when he dumped in
30 points against San Diego.
Stanford will be gunning for its
third straight win. Last week, the
Cards ruined the Alumni 68 to 31.
and edged the Stewart Chevrolets
in a 49-48 thriller.
Mid-season Form Already?
Flashing mid-season form, Ever
ett Dean's men have started their
new season with *a bang. The win
aver Stewart Chevrolet was a big
boom to the morale of both the
team and the fans. The Chevies
have one of the finest teams in local
cage circles, but Stanford beat them
in all departments.
The backboard play of the In

dians was particularly outstanding
against Stewart. Bill Stephenson,
George Yardley, Bill Hose, and
Dave Davidson looked impressive
in taking the board play away from
Jack Nichols and Frank Laney, two
characters who usually have all
their own way in that department.
So far, the Stanfords have worked
only against the man-to-man, but
against Fresno State they'll have to
switch their oflense. Everett Dean
will probably start the same combo
that has been on the floor first for
the two previous games. He might
juggle the guards at the last min
ute. but if not, the starting lineups
are:
FRESNO STANFORD
Bordet 112 Yardley
Cavo 1' Rose
Sandevgai'd c Stephenson
Becknell g Davidson
Garcia g Chavalas
