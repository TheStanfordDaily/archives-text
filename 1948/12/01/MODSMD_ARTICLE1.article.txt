# Hoover-- 'Truman Plans To Regroup Agencies'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 (.P) —
President Truman's approval of a
plan to regroup approximately 60
federal agencies which now report
directly to the Chief Executive was
announced today by Herbert Hoover.
The former President, head of a
bi-partisan commission which has
been studying the executive branch
of the government, said each of these
agencies would be put under a Cab
inet-rank deparment or another
agency called an "administration."
Hoover talked with reporters at

the While House after he had con
ferred for approximately 45 minutes
with Mr. Truman.
They first understood him to say
the commission will recommend
that the 60 agencies be blanketed
into one for more efficient house
keeping.
A spokesman said later, however,
that the former President meant
each agency would be placed either
into (a) one of the nine existing
Cabinet-rank departments or a pro
posed tenth, or one of six admin
istrations, each with a single head,
which would handle matters in re
lated fields.
Hoover said that under the best
circumstances the changes to be
recommended by the commission
could save the government about
$3,000,000,000 a year. Fie added that
that could result from increased effi
ciency alone and not from any radi
cal change in policy.


HERBERT I'OOVER reported that President Truman today approved
his plan to reshuffle 60 government agencies.. This might save three
ij 11 lion dollars the first year, said the ex-President.
