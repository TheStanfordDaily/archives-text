## Shopping for Peace 
### 
Around this time of year the newspapers generally print daily
s small cartoon indicating the number of shopping days until
Christmas. That is as it should be, perhaps, since Christmas is
a time of great activity for the merchants who advertise in the
paper.
But, since December 25 is also observed as the birthday of
the Prince of Peace, perhaps it would also be well to reflect on
the number of shopping days we have for peace.
There are many wise men who say the time is short. Some
authorities say if we can keep peace for a year and one-half,
;we'll have peace for a very long time. The time does seem short,
though, when we consider man's painfully slow progress in
human relations, the science of getting along with his fellow
man as well as his environment.
After World War I there probably was a great weariness of
war and a universal desire for peace. And probably a few sin
cere statesmen tried to make the League of Nations a working
:orce for peace. But when the chips were down, petty jealousies
and individual interests scuttled the League.
Another 20 years and another world war. This war came
close to total war, involving civilian populations as well as uni
formed troops.
Even before the war was over, groundwork was laid for a
world organization to take united action against war and to
promote understanding and co-operation the world over. There
is yet no guarantee that the same forces won't prevent its
working.
Today, three years after the war's end (the signing of sur
render terms), political scientists, historians, militarists, and
statesmen are all pretty much agreed that the next war will
most certainly be a total one. They are agreed, too, that there
will be no time to prepare. We must prepare now.
But can we also prepare for peace? It sounds easy enough,
doesn't it? You might argue that if the people want peace, they'll
have it. But it has been demonstrated that peace cannot be
wrought about by a few statesmen and a few peace organiza
tions. Peace can be brought about only by the united action
of peoples in forming a going organization that will keep order,
first of all, and secondly, work for peace. And such an organiza
tion is only the beginning. It will have to be supplemented by a
great number of people giving some time and thought to the
problem of peace. Instead of going on from day to day, hoping
:or peace, we'll have to work for it, all of us.
The philosophy of Jesus Christ was simply to love thy neigh
bor. While that is probably too idealistic at this stage in man's
development, it is nevertheless certain that everyone will have
to get along with his neighbors. And there aren't many shop
ping days left.

and individual interests scuttled the League.
Another 20 years and another world war. This war came
close to total war, involving civilian populations as well as uni
formed troops.
Even before the war was over, groundwork was laid for a
world organization to take united action against war and to
promote understanding and co-operation the world over. There
is yet no guarantee that the same forces won't prevent its
working.
Today, three years after the war's end (the signing of sur
render terms), political scientists, historians, militarists, and
statesmen are all pretty much agreed that the next war will
most certainly be a total one. They are agreed, too, that there
will be no time to prepare. We must prepare now.
But can we also prepare for peace? It sounds easy enough,
doesn't it? You might argue that if the people want peace, they'll
have it. But it has been demonstrated that peace cannot be
wrought about by a few statesmen and a few peace organiza
tions. Peace can be brought about only by the united action
of peoples in forming a going organization that will keep order,
first of all, and secondly, work for peace. And such an organiza
tion is only the beginning. It will have to be supplemented by a
great number of people giving some time and thought to the
problem of peace. Instead of going on from day to day, hoping
:or peace, we'll have to work for it, all of us.
The philosophy of Jesus Christ was simply to love thy neigh
bor. While that is probably too idealistic at this stage in man's
development, it is nevertheless certain that everyone will have
to get along with his neighbors. And there aren't many shop
ping days left.
Around this time of year the newspapers generally print daily
s small cartoon indicating the number of shopping days until
Christmas. That is as it should be, perhaps, since Christmas is
a time of great activity for the merchants who advertise in the
paper.
But, since December 25 is also observed as the birthday of
the Prince of Peace, perhaps it would also be well to reflect on
the number of shopping days we have for peace.
There are many wise men who say the time is short. Some
authorities say if we can keep peace for a year and one-half,
;we'll have peace for a very long time. The time does seem short,
though, when we consider man's painfully slow progress in
human relations, the science of getting along with his fellow
man as well as his environment.
After World War I there probably was a great weariness of
war and a universal desire for peace. And probably a few sin
