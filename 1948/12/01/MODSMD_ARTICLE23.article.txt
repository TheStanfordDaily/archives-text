## Ladies-In-Waiting 
### 
The average man's arm is 28
.nchcs long. The average woman's
".vaist is 28 inches around. It just
joes to show that nature thinks of
everything.
It is pretty universally known j
that the two be.st subjects for con
versation are talking shop and
making !ove . . . and since being
alone in the moonlight is more fun !
:1 you aren't, we deduce that the
course of true love never runs up |
a big light bill.
Its like the lad in the parlor said. ,
"Darling, I could sit here and do !
nothing but look at you forever." i
Says she. "That's what I'm begin- j
ning to think. Do you mind if Ii
snap off the light? I freckle easily." i
Though college days have their de- j
lights â€” they can't compare with!
college nights.
01 course you know what a deb
is. That's a young lady with bride
ideas. This is usually the type of
gal who knows all the answers, but
whom the men never ask any ques
tions. All I know about women
myself is just what I've picked up.
U & I. Sugar
Love is a feeling that you feel
when you feel like you've never
felt before, I hear. Also love is
silly, love is sad; love is futile, love I

is mad. Love's a sorrow, love's a
curse . . . But not to be in love
is worse! It's like the gal said,
100 bad he's not my type because
I love him madly." Never try to
understand women.
Personally I think that I shall never
see
A girl that's good enough for me.
But that s all right, I've no com
plaint,
I much prefer the ones who ain't.
On the other hand is thg girl
who thinks no man is good enough
for her. Ol course, she may be right
. . . and then again she may be left.
Recipe for Reaction
My boss told me that I was a
young man who would go far. I
tried to tell my girl that the other
night, but she said that no matter
what the lx>ss said I was only going
so far. A lady is a woman who
makes it easy for a man to be a
gentleman.
On the other hand, show a co-ed
a diamond and immediately she be
comes a coo-ed. Officially they may
be here in school for an MA, but
off the record they are here for an
MRS.
And perhaps that's the reason
surveys show that four out of five
women-haters are women!
