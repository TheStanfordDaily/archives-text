# Scientific Marriage- It Works!!
## 
### 
LONDON (/P). — The scientists
| who run the Marriage Society of
j Great Britain have just gone over
| a waiting list of almost fi.OOO per-
I sons.
With a red pencil they crossed
j out the names of all women more
| than 30 years old. They won't get
j a husband through the society and
j the overwhelming probabilities are
j they will become old maids.
"It may seem a brutal thing to
i have done," said Mayo Wingate,
j the psychologist of the team of spe
| eialists that manages the Marriage
j Society.
"But these women have no
! chance, so what's the use? This is
I a scientific business."
For a time at least, the organiza
tion which mates human beings
! scientifically has closed the door to
t the woman over 30. There are ex
ceptions of course, and the over-30
1 girl may find a husband. But the
mathematical chances in Britain are
I so small that the busy society has
j ceased trying.
An Appalling Thought
| "It is an appalling thought," said
, Wingate. "But there is the situa
tion—and we are here to look the
| facts in the face."
The society, a non-profit organi
zation with the highest professional
backing, has just finished a survey
which indicates that the proportion
| of persons in the United Kingdom
! seriously wishing to get married is
| 100 men to 114 women.
I "Those 14 extra women are hard
I to handle, and they present a so
[ cial problem which is simply be
| yond us," said Wingate.
The society is only indirectly
concerned with the problem of ex
i cess women. Its principal function
is to make a success of the mar
| riages it arranges on a scientific
basis.
To the calculating specialists of
i the society, love and romance are
charming incidental music which,
: however, have little to do with in
fluencing the success or failure of
a marriage.
Love in Bloom
The specialists like to see love
blooming, but only after a psychol
ogist, an anthropologist, a surgeon,
and a hard-headed man of affairs
who knows about economics and
the housing shortage have decided
I that basic factors which make a
couple congenial all point to prob
j able success.
The society, which maintains of
i fices in May fair that look like a
smart surgery, says to a man, in
| cllect:
"This is Margaret. As far as wc
can determine scientifically she
ought to be a good wife for you.
She's tho right age, she likes golf
ps much as you, she can make
j Yorkshire pudding to your liking,
' and you won't quarrel over reli
gion. But you'll have to decide for
yourself."
Two years of experimental oper
ation would indicate that the sys
■ tem works. The society has had
| many marriages—no divorces.
Wingate himself was married last
! June, in the old - fashioned way.
No charts or tests. He met Beryl
j Robinson, an actress, and fell in
| love with her.

j the overwhelming probabilities are

"It may seem a brutal thing to
i have done," said Mayo Wingate,
j the psychologist of the team of spe
| eialists that manages the Marriage
j Society.
"But these women have no
! chance, so what's the use? This is
I a scientific business."
For a time at least, the organiza
tion which mates human beings
! scientifically has closed the door to
t the woman over 30. There are ex
ceptions of course, and the over-30
1 girl may find a husband. But the
mathematical chances in Britain are
I so small that the busy society has
j ceased trying.
An Appalling Thought
| "It is an appalling thought," said
, Wingate. "But there is the situa
tion—and we are here to look the
| facts in the face."
The society, a non-profit organi
zation with the highest professional
backing, has just finished a survey
which indicates that the proportion
| of persons in the United Kingdom
! seriously wishing to get married is
| 100 men to 114 women.
I "Those 14 extra women are hard
I to handle, and they present a so
[ cial problem which is simply be
| yond us," said Wingate.
The society is only indirectly
concerned with the problem of ex
i cess women. Its principal function
is to make a success of the mar
| riages it arranges on a scientific
basis.
To the calculating specialists of
i the society, love and romance are
charming incidental music which,
: however, have little to do with in
fluencing the success or failure of
a marriage.
Love in Bloom
The specialists like to see love
blooming, but only after a psychol
ogist, an anthropologist, a surgeon,
and a hard-headed man of affairs
who knows about economics and
the housing shortage have decided
I that basic factors which make a
couple congenial all point to prob
j able success.
The society, which maintains of
i fices in May fair that look like a
smart surgery, says to a man, in
| cllect:
"This is Margaret. As far as wc
can determine scientifically she
ought to be a good wife for you.
She's tho right age, she likes golf
ps much as you, she can make
j Yorkshire pudding to your liking,
' and you won't quarrel over reli
gion. But you'll have to decide for
yourself."
Two years of experimental oper
ation would indicate that the sys
■ tem works. The society has had
| many marriages—no divorces.
Wingate himself was married last
! June, in the old - fashioned way.
No charts or tests. He met Beryl
j Robinson, an actress, and fell in
| love with her.
LONDON (/P). — The scientists
