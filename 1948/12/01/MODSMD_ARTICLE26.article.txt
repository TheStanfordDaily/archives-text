# Parables Are Used To Finance Church
## 
### 
STOCKTON, Nov. 30 (/P) â€” Ten
weeks ago the Rev. Curtis Nims of
the First Baptist Church decided to
put the "Parable of the Talents" to
work.
He distributed $4,000 in new $10
bills to members of his congregation.
Each person agreed to put the
money to work and return the
profits.
Today Mr. Nims has his $4,000
back, and an additional $5,200 for a
total of $9,200. And he said he felt
certain another $3,000 still would
come in from uncompleted projects.
The money will go into a building
fund lor a $300,000 church.
