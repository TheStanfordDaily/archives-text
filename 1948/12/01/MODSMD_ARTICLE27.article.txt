Dear Harry:
Frankly. I've sort of been expecting to hear fiom you. And, Harry,
I'm not one to forget a friend.
Of late my business has been booming in the hat department; lots of
112( Iks around here have been coming in here and buying certificates to pay
oft potential election bet losses—lot of Democrats around here. Since I
owe all this business to you, I think it only fitting that you should share
the profits arising from this situation. Therefore, Harry, if—l say if; you
can nevei quite tell, hah, hah—but if you do find Yourself footloose,
shall we say, I do believe I can make an opening for you in the hat
I department as stock boy.
j Of course, this doesn't pay as much as you're making now, but, Harry,
| I've known you for a long time, and I know that a false sense of pride
| is not one of your weaknesses.
I m looking forwaid to resuming our business relationship come January
j 20, or thereabouts.
Your affectionate friend,
, . CARL
| P. S. It you can pick up a whisk broom and tape measure on the way
here, it will help the situation in your department quite a bit.

| Dear Carl:
I was moved by your offer. However, now it seems I am not moving
I for a while.
Yes, Carl, I'm sorry in a way, but something's come up. It wasn't en
tirely unexpected, but I wasn't putting all my eggs into one basket when
I I wrote you. You know the old adage, "Insurance is man's best friend."
Well, Carl, as I knew all along, I really won't have to pick up the premium.
, After all, the sunshine along the Potomac isn't hard to take. It's nice
, and warm. Comfortable, sort of, don't you know. And it's good for Mar
| },diets tonsils. Further, with the housing shortage being what it is,
the place I'm living in now isn't too bad—though it does need some
: additions such as a few more balconies around the place for balance, a
swimming pool, a sea-canal and a harbor leading into the back yard
for the yacht, and a few other odds and ends like that.
Carl, don't think for one moment that I don't appreciate your offer
If there's one thing in life that should be lasting, it should be the friend
ship of two friends. Don't you think? And, believe me, Carl, you've
• pi oven what friendship means to you. Don't think I don't appreciate it.
Yours truly,
d c , HARRY
P. b. You may be getting a letter from me about 1952. You know, by
j then I'll have more all around experience.

Dear Harry:
Frankly. I've sort of been expecting to hear fiom you. And, Harry,
I'm not one to forget a friend.
Of late my business has been booming in the hat department; lots of
112( Iks around here have been coming in here and buying certificates to pay
oft potential election bet losses—lot of Democrats around here. Since I
owe all this business to you, I think it only fitting that you should share
the profits arising from this situation. Therefore, Harry, if—l say if; you
can nevei quite tell, hah, hah—but if you do find Yourself footloose,
shall we say, I do believe I can make an opening for you in the hat
I department as stock boy.
j Of course, this doesn't pay as much as you're making now, but, Harry,
| I've known you for a long time, and I know that a false sense of pride
| is not one of your weaknesses.
I m looking forwaid to resuming our business relationship come January
j 20, or thereabouts.
Your affectionate friend,
, . CARL
| P. S. It you can pick up a whisk broom and tape measure on the way
here, it will help the situation in your department quite a bit.

Yes, Carl, I'm sorry in a way, but something's come up. It wasn't en
