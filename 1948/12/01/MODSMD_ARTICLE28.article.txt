The New Liberal Women's Regulations
To the Editor: -- -■>» -
We have been examining the new proposed system of penalization of
women for infraction of Social Standards. Having heard that the new
new system was a more liberal one, indeed, a "sweeping away" of all
petty and bothersome problems, and one that catered to the more mature
intelligence of every woman student, we became immediately suspicious
and decided to investigate. This is what we have found: under the new
system a woman is allowed 25 unexcused lockouts, under the bonus .sys
tem she has 3 a quarter, or a total of 3G; under the new system she is
al'owed 2'l> hours of unexcused absence, under the bonus system, 3
hours all told. But. in the bonus system, it is after this initial allowance
that a woman begins to be penalized; in the new system, she is expelled
—kicked out—kaput! This, then, is the liberation of Stanford women!
bne gets liberated right out of the University.
Furthermore, we would like to see Women's Council bound in some
/ay to uphold a standard of their own. If all power of interpretation of
(be words "excused" and "unexcused" is to rest in their hands, we would
e (o have it clearly stated for just what reasons they may expel a
woman student. We have no guarantee that (ho intelligence of the mem
bers of Women's Council is any greater than that of the women students
as a whole, and we may presume to think that they are as susceptible
to attacks of narrow-mindedness, personal prejudice, and over-estimation
or their own power.
The most liberal of laws can become an implement of narrowness and
prejudice, mockery of its original motivation. If (he rules are bothci -
some now, how much more will they be when a women has to- 1 si <n
out, 2. check that her date has an extra tire with him, 3. overhaul the
automobile, 4. check two watches against the clock and every hour on
the hour, 5. make sure she allows 15 minutes for car trouble 10 minutes
foi getting to a phone, every time she leaves to return to the dormitory.
Consider the last point; what further temptations to evil one would
have in the event of having allowed the time for car trouble and not
needing it! One would have half an hour more in which to sin.
In view of the above-mentioned considerations and others which will
occur to anyone who investigates the new plan, we believe that 'if it is
passed m present form by the women students of Stanford that they are
calmly accepting their own slaughter. So, we leave them to their fate
