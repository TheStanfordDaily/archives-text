students will continue today from
8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. at the
Nitery and temporary building "A."
All study lists and seat cards should
be turned in by 4:30 this afternoon.
Pre-registration for Lower Di
vision students will start Friday and
continue through Tuesday. They
should make appointments with
their advisors for either Thursday
or Friday for approval of their
study list cards.
Lower Division students have
been divided into alphabetical
groupings and must be present at
the Nitery at the time designated on
their appointment slips in order to
obtain their seat cards. Registrar H.
Donald Winbigler announced that
50 to 75 students will pre-register
every half-hour, so that most stu
dents can get the seat cards they
want, regardless of the time of their
appointment.
In order to speed up this year's
registration, enrollment in physcal
education classes will also take
place in the Nitery instead of on
registration da y. Pre-registration
procedure for both Upper and Lower
Division students may le found in
the Winter Quarter Time Schedule.
