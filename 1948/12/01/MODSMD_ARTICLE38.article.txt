Football talk is on its last leg, but there are a few facts still fiyii
aiound concerning the Oregon Episode. The official voting of the PC
seems to have gone 6 to 4 in favor of the Jensen men.
The final count, always kept a deep, dark secret by the Pacific Coi
moguls, was disclosed last week when the Los Angeles Herald got wo
from reliable sources at USC just what was cooking on the addii
machines.
For those of you still fighting it out between the Bears and the Duel
here's the story.
Idaho, Montana, Oregon State, and Oregon tossed in their points 112
the VVebfeet.
Washington State, Washington, Stanford, California, UCLA, and final
USC, strung along with Pappy. USC was the last school to vote, and h
the Trojans picked Oregon as their football coach, Jeff Cravath, h

Under the ruling, the Ducks would then have been Rose Bowl automati
Si ill Like a Playoff
Those who have maintained that a playoff would have been too dif
cult to arrange are still all wet. Even if the rules did oppose, what t
heck, change the rules.
Sports Editor Bill Swigart has been drenched with the mail act tl
week just because he cast his vote for old Oregon. One gentleman <
at the Village hinted briefly—on 20 pages of notebook paper—that Ca
fornia really was the better team. He was polite, but he thought if
we both were naughty to think that Oregon got a rotten deal.
As it turned out, Jim Aitken's northerners are going to make mc
money on New Year's Day. Playing Southern Methodist in the Cott
Bowl. Oregon will get a percentage of the gate that won't have to
shared with the nine other conference teams.
California, although making more cash in the Rose Bowl, will ha
to share its golden egg with everyone else, even Oregon.
Leahy to Replace Oavatli

Flaherty, who has called the shot more than once on these coachi
shifts, says that Notre Dame's Frank Leahy will come to USC in 1949.
As yet, Jeff Cravath has heard nothing of the deal. That's what m;
Flaherty, as nice a guy as could work for Hearst, mad. Lefihy admits be
approached with an offer. Other parties deny it. It's a nice little men
go-round, but a little embarrassing for Cravath.
I >;»ily Folds Friday
Since the paper is scheduled to fold in two more days, this will
my last trip to the Front Row for the fast-sinking Autumn Quarter,
such a time it is altogether fitting and proper to clean up all the lo
odds and ends. To-wit:
First of all, poison arrows to A 1 Capone's henchmen who sold hotda\
in Stanford Stadium during football season. Those crooks wrapped u]
c< Id dawg in a stale bun, touched 'em with a lid off an empty must
jar, and sold 'em for two-bits. That's larceny.
More poison arrows to the hoodlums around Berkeley's Memorial S
dium who opened their hearts at Big Game time to let strangers p
in their driveways. For five bucks a clip, that is.
Stanford's football schedule is going to see its best season in hist
next year. The Indians will open with San Jose State on Sept. 17. ent
tain Harvard the following week, and will also have fun with Michk
as well as the regular PCC teams, during the later weeks Califoi
will give Northwestern all they ask for on New Year's Day. but d<
bet on it basketball is going to be just what the doctor orde
this season. Watch George Yardley and Bill Stephenson make an ;

southern division Okay, n
so I can't con you any loiv
That's all for today, and all
the year.
