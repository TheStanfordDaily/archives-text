the Pavilion to wafk off with
ir third straight basketball vic

Stanford jumped into an early

parade with a free throw. Some
e work in the first few minutes
>ught Stanford's total to 10 be
e Fresno State had a chance to
on the scoreboard. The invad
were outclassed right from the
rt.
Vt the ten-minute mark, the In
ns had pulled away to lead 18 to
and Fresno State looked like
.'thing but a good team. The
l'dogs used a man-to-man de
se, but it didn't jell. Neither did
ir offense.
leorge Yardley, Bill Stephenson,
I Bill Rose were too tough nn
boards for the smaller invaders,
•uley was high scorer with 10.
Seconds Square Off
tf'er the ten-minute mark, Dean
i in his second unit, as did Coach
itch" Warmerdam of the Bull
is. Fresno State's number two
ii fared a little better. They
led the score up to 25 to 15 at
fume, but that was as close as
igs got.
• ill Rose and George Yardley
it back to work at the begin
; of the second halt, and in five
uites piled on enough coal to
1 33 to 18.
ack into the fray went the sec
s. and back together went the
e, as Fresno scored seven quick
its to make it 35 to 25. Gus
ivalas and Milt Iverson then
ued up to make it an Indian
lp, Chavalas first passing to
son for a score, and then Iver
returned the favor, as Stanford
tched the score to 39 to 25.
Crowd Heads for Home
t that point, the crowd started
home. The ball game wasn't too
d. Stanford looked good right
he start, but for a fast-breaking
n the Cards worked too slow,
ir first pass was not coming out
enough, and the men weren't
iking.
esides that, Fresno State defi
lv did not floor its best team
history. Their point - making
cl. George Becknell, didn't net
ngle digit, and the entire club
Idn't get any form of an offense
•ther.
heir best offense was a long shot
le, and for a while it looked like
•ontest to see which Bulldog

opened the second-half scoring with
a lay-up shot. The jaysee men were
able to penetrate Stanford's defense
better in the second half. However,
