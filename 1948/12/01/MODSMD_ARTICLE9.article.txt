### 
NANKING, Nov. 30 (/Py—Suchows
250,000-man garrison was reported
swinging south today for a battle to
save Nanking, but signs multiplied
in the capital that the government
is prepared to flee.
Well-based reports said govern
ment offices might scatter—to the
old wartime capital of Chungking
in the west, Canton in the south,
and to Formosa.
Usually reliable sources said the
Suchow garrison — strongest force
left in the area—sallied from the
fortress in an attempt to save 14,000
comrades trapped by the Reds 65
miles to the south.
These sources spoke of the move

They said all communications—in
cluding air transport — between
Nanking and the bastion 211 miles
northwest would be cut off tomor
row.

MOFFETT FIELD, Nov. 30 (fP)—A
fight-lipped Madame Chiang Kai-
Shek arrived in the United States
today to essay what may be the
most important diplomatic role of
a glamorous career—that of obtain
ing American aid for her husband's
hard-pressed government.
The petite wife of China's Gener
alissimo landed at this naval air sta
tion a few minutes before noon for
an 8-hour stopover on her hurried
aerial flight from Nanking to Wash
ington.
She refused to entertain any ques
tions from the large corps of re
porters, but posed graciously for
newsreel and still camera photogra
phers.
Then, without further ado, she
stepped into a car belonging to her
brother, T. A. Soong, San Francisco
banker, and drove off to the Soong
home in Berkeley
In Washington, her brother-in
law, Dr. H. H. Kung, told news
men he had visited with President.
Truman but denied arrangements
had been made at the White House
for Madame Chiann's visit.
