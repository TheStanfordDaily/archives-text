# Law Building, Stern Hall, Lab Now Underway
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
Stanford's fourth major build
ing boom is well into the half-!
way point as the new year ap
proaches, with Stern Hall, the
new Law Building, and the new
Microwave Laboratory receiving the 1
main attention.
Down in the old Administration j
Building, the staccato of riveting i
threatens to make life miserable for j
business grad students faced with
final exams. Heimeted construction j
crews have hoisted into place giant j
steel girders which will support two j
additional stories above the main I
iloor.
Funds From Alunuii
Money for the reconstruction of
the 46-year-old structure was do- !
nated by Stanford aluVnni and i
friends under the Law School plan.
When finished, the building will
show little resemblance to the old
Ad Building. Full use will be made
of the basement door, which will
include a student locker room and
lounge.
Stem Hull
Clear weather has meant consid
erable progress on Stern Hall, which
is slated to be completed by next
Summer. The concrete groundwork
for the building is almost completed,
and workmen are constructing forms ;
for the walls of the west section.
A dining hall, kitchen, and lounge
will be included in the dormitory,
provided for by an additional gift !
from the estate of Lucie Stern of
Falo Alto. The hall will house 240
undergraduate men,
Microwave Laboratory
Most of the bulk work on the j
$170,000 Microwave Laboratory lo- ;
cated behind Sequoia Hall has been '
completed, and the building is ex- i
$ected to be finished by ihe end of
January.
Down the complete length of the
building will lie a billion-volt elec- j
tron linear accelerator, commonly
known as an atom smasher. The ac- '
celerator will be 160 feet in length. I
At the Wiring Stage
Work on the laboratory at pres- j
ent includes tarring the roof, the !
installation of window frames. !
plumbing and electrical systems and
the smoothing over of the outside
face of the building.
On the Inner Quad, students are j
now using the new facilities of the !
reconverted Mineral Sciences Build- i
ings. The reconstruction is for the |
most part complete with a few ad
justment yet to be made. The addi- |
lion of a second story and the mod- |
ernization of the buildings is the |
first step to expand the facilities of
ihe Inner Quad buildings.

ihe Inner Quad buildings.
Stanford's fourth major build
ing boom is well into the half-!
way point as the new year ap
proaches, with Stern Hall, the
new Law Building, and the new
Microwave Laboratory receiving the 1
main attention.
Down in the old Administration j
Building, the staccato of riveting i
threatens to make life miserable for j
business grad students faced with
final exams. Heimeted construction j
crews have hoisted into place giant j
steel girders which will support two j
additional stories above the main I
iloor.
Funds From Alunuii
Money for the reconstruction of
the 46-year-old structure was do- !
nated by Stanford aluVnni and i
friends under the Law School plan.
When finished, the building will
show little resemblance to the old
Ad Building. Full use will be made
of the basement door, which will
include a student locker room and
lounge.

Clear weather has meant consid
erable progress on Stern Hall, which
is slated to be completed by next
Summer. The concrete groundwork
for the building is almost completed,
and workmen are constructing forms ;
for the walls of the west section.
A dining hall, kitchen, and lounge
will be included in the dormitory,
provided for by an additional gift !
from the estate of Lucie Stern of
Falo Alto. The hall will house 240
undergraduate men,
Microwave Laboratory
Most of the bulk work on the j
$170,000 Microwave Laboratory lo- ;
cated behind Sequoia Hall has been '
completed, and the building is ex- i
$ected to be finished by ihe end of
January.
Down the complete length of the
building will lie a billion-volt elec- j
tron linear accelerator, commonly
known as an atom smasher. The ac- '
celerator will be 160 feet in length. I
At the Wiring Stage
Work on the laboratory at pres- j
ent includes tarring the roof, the !
installation of window frames. !
plumbing and electrical systems and
the smoothing over of the outside
face of the building.
On the Inner Quad, students are j
now using the new facilities of the !
reconverted Mineral Sciences Build- i
ings. The reconstruction is for the |
most part complete with a few ad
justment yet to be made. The addi- |
lion of a second story and the mod- |
ernization of the buildings is the |
first step to expand the facilities of
ihe Inner Quad buildings.
