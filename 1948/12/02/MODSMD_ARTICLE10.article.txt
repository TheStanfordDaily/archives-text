### DIANE JESSEN 
The fall quarter One-Acts swung
into a promising four - night run
last night, hitting their peak with
Allen Fletcher's warm portrayal of
a frustrated Marine officer in "The
Souvenirs."
Fletcher's part, penned by Mc-
Patterson and r irected bv
Paul Hostet'er, was closely matched
; n high performance by Ruth Fish
er, graduating drama student, who
supported Priscilla Pointer in "The
Trophy," the second of the three
dramas.
"The Souvenirs," the play that
it all — laughter, smiles, and
tears — came forth with a timelv
"x'-losion of human emotions with
•i cast that knew how to carry them
out.

taking top credit for his part, was
Stuart Campbeli as the inevitable
sergeant.
"T'he Trophy" was by far the
most unique and striking of the
olays because of its unusual and
intense plot.
This drama, directed by Nancy
MacNauf*ht, was "made"' by the
very believable scene of the friend
and the wife. In her last role as a
Stanford undergraduate, Ruth Fish
er oroduced excellent lines.
Priscilla Pointer as the estranged
wife did very well, certain'y
