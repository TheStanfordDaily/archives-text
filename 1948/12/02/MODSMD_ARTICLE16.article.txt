### 
BERLIN, Dec. 1 â€” Commu
nist hecklers precipitated a violent
fist fight in Western Berlin -tonight
when they tried to break up a po
litical rally.
It was the first outbreak since a
Communist-called meeting in the
Soviet sector yesterday declared
the regular city government out of
office and elected a new Red re
gime by a show oi' hands.
An audience of several hundred
in Neukolln was being urged to
night by Social Democrat speakers
to turn out a big vote against Com
munism in next Sunday's elections
when Communist hecklers inter
rupted.
A dozen men' began throwing
punches. German police, with the
enthusiastic aid o* Social Demo
crats. threw the rowdies out of the
.hall. Outside, the hecklers sang the
"Internationale.' There were no
.arrests.
Scores of similar rallies are
scheduled for the remainder of this
week in all parts of Western Berlin,
and West German police have been
alerted to keep order.
