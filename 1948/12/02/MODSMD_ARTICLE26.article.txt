## Library Lights 
### 
After several years of student pressure, lights by which one
can read without suffering eye strain were installed in the Re
serve Book Room. However, this was not the case in the Ref
erence Room. The lights there remain woefully inadequate for
studying.
The lights are too weak, too high, and not directed at the tables.
In the past the excuse has been that to put in new lights would
not be possible as the existing wires would not be able to carry
the load. With the installation of the long-needed lights in the
Reserve Book Room and additional wires to carry the load, this
should no longer be the case. The cost may be great in rem
edying the situation, but the eyes of students are far more valu
able than the necessary monetary outlay.
Lighting is also very poor in the two rooms in the Romanic
languages Building that are provided for studying at night.
- bis is not the case in all the classrooms, especially those in
the History Corner. Leaving these rooms open for studying
would not only solve the question of adequate lighting, but also
provide more space for studying. This space is especially
needed during finals time for students preferring not to study
ir the crowded library.
