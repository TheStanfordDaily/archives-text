## Demerit Plan Defended 
### 
To the Editor:
Tlie letter to the editor published in Tuesday's Daily in regard to
the demerit system revealed an attitude held by many on campus which
i think distorts the facts. Its authors seek to prove, in essence, that
the demerit system is not more liberal than the bonus system, showing
that under the bonus system a girl is allowed 30 lock-outs as compared
with the 25 under the demerit system.
Having presented these statistics, they draw the conclusion that the
present bonus system is more liberal than the demerit penalty plan.
The demerit plan s claim to "liberation of Stanford women'' lies in
•he fact that under it women would not be called up before council or
(orm committees, lock-in penalties would not be issued, and each woman
would assume individual responsibility in regard to social regulations,
instead of being judged and penalized by Women's Council.
It would seem to me that any system which allows the individual to
ssume her own responsibility in contrast-to being called before a judicial
body for every minute infraction of the social regulations is a much
more liberal one.
The letter also criticizes the demerit system on the ground that it gives
Council the light to decide if a lock-out is to be excused. However, under
the present bonus system this arbitrary distribution of penalties applies
to every violation, whereas all violations under the demerit system are
defined and their relative seriousness tiuwn." MftreoVel', under
tlie demerit system Council's power to evaluate a case would arise only
when a case was appealed by the violator.
The authors state after comparing the number of unexcused lock-outs
under each system, that under the bonus system it is after the initial
r llowanee that a woman is penalized.
The are apparently overlooking the fact that for each of these 3(>
J jck-outs, the violator would be called before her dorm committee, ques
tioned as to the reasons lor her late return, and penalized by being locked
into her dormitory anywhere from one to three nights.
When the authors criticize the demerit system on the ground that
having accumulated 25 unexcused lock-outs, the violator could be ex
pelled by Women's Council, they reveal that they have not checked their
lads. Council may only recommend that a student be suspended. Each
ease would be decided upon individually. The total record which the
-indent, has made would be considered and suspension rests with the
administration.
A fact which most critics of the demerit system have failed to realize,
i.- that Council under the present system can, and has, recommended the
suspension of flagrant violators of the Social Regulations.
In comparing the two systems I think that it is obvious that the demerit
-ystem is more liberal, not because it offers Stanford women more oppor
tunities to violate the social regulations, but because it leaves the respon
sibility of observing social regulations in her hands. The question, there
lore. which arises when the demerit plan is voted upon next week, is
•hether or not Stanford women choose to assume this responsibility.

the demerit system is not more liberal than the bonus system, showing
that under the bonus system a girl is allowed 30 lock-outs as compared
with the 25 under the demerit system.
Having presented these statistics, they draw the conclusion that the
present bonus system is more liberal than the demerit penalty plan.
The demerit plan s claim to "liberation of Stanford women'' lies in
•he fact that under it women would not be called up before council or
(orm committees, lock-in penalties would not be issued, and each woman
would assume individual responsibility in regard to social regulations,
instead of being judged and penalized by Women's Council.
It would seem to me that any system which allows the individual to
ssume her own responsibility in contrast-to being called before a judicial
body for every minute infraction of the social regulations is a much
more liberal one.
The letter also criticizes the demerit system on the ground that it gives
Council the light to decide if a lock-out is to be excused. However, under
the present bonus system this arbitrary distribution of penalties applies
to every violation, whereas all violations under the demerit system are
defined and their relative seriousness tiuwn." MftreoVel', under
tlie demerit system Council's power to evaluate a case would arise only
when a case was appealed by the violator.
The authors state after comparing the number of unexcused lock-outs
under each system, that under the bonus system it is after the initial
r llowanee that a woman is penalized.
The are apparently overlooking the fact that for each of these 3(>
J jck-outs, the violator would be called before her dorm committee, ques
tioned as to the reasons lor her late return, and penalized by being locked
into her dormitory anywhere from one to three nights.
When the authors criticize the demerit system on the ground that
having accumulated 25 unexcused lock-outs, the violator could be ex
pelled by Women's Council, they reveal that they have not checked their
lads. Council may only recommend that a student be suspended. Each
ease would be decided upon individually. The total record which the
-indent, has made would be considered and suspension rests with the
administration.
A fact which most critics of the demerit system have failed to realize,
i.- that Council under the present system can, and has, recommended the
suspension of flagrant violators of the Social Regulations.
In comparing the two systems I think that it is obvious that the demerit
-ystem is more liberal, not because it offers Stanford women more oppor
tunities to violate the social regulations, but because it leaves the respon
sibility of observing social regulations in her hands. The question, there
lore. which arises when the demerit plan is voted upon next week, is
•hether or not Stanford women choose to assume this responsibility.
