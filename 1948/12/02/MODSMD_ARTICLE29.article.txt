# Skip Classes? Writer Gives Reasons Why
## 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
Instructors spend nine-tenths of
j their time lecturing. Have you ever
tried observing your lecturer to see
what makes his little speeches so
: unutterably boring so consistently?
That's what I am here for. I have
set about listing the various types
' ot lecturers and typical reactions to
them.
1. The sleep walker:
This somnambulist talks as if he
| were in the power of a hypnotist.
He has about as much vitality to his
i speech as a Christian Temperance
Leaguer in the Cactus Garden. His
monotonous tones and glassy-eyed
look bring about the same doped
j expression in those he is trying to
[ convert.
Reaction . . .
A. Where does he buy his bar
biturates?
B. What a wonderful bedtime
| story-teller this guy would make.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time.
2. The athlete:
He strides around the room.
: throws his body into contortions,
j waves his arms, and pounds the
; desk to drive home his points,
I which no one gets because they're
I all so engrossed in watching his
' calisthenics.
Reaction . . .
A. Gad, I thought this was Biz
Law 110!
B. Light somewhere so I can get
| a bead on you, bub.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time.
3. The comedian:
This type stops momentarily,
! looks ahead at his notes, snickers
; slyly to himself, and continues. This
I leaves the student on the edge of
1 his seat. I i-epeat, this leaves the
student on the edge of his seat. The
: funny part never seems to come.
Reaction . . .
1 A. I don't get it. but if it's worth
a grade I'll snicker back.
B. OK. you laid it. now cackle.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time.
■4. The s(al* gazei'!
He looks out the window, down
1 at the toes of his shoes, speculates
j on the ceiling, examines his nails.
He does everything but look his
I class in tfte eye.
Reaction . . .
J A. Well, you're not so easy on the
eyes yourself, old man.
B. Try turns, chum.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time.
5. The town crier:
This type makes himself heard
even above the classroom din. But
! his bark is worse than his bite.
Reaction . . .
A. Tie up, Jack; this headache is
killing me.
B. That's all right, we don't ex
{ pect you to know everything.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time,
(i. Delirium tremens:
This lad just can't keep his hands
still. He winds his watch twice,
j twills his Fi-bate key, looks at his
watch, straightens the papers on his
I desk, holds the watch up to his ear,
! etc., etc.
Reaction . . .
A. I agree, pal, it's one helluva
| long lecture.
B. Wonder who he's got the
heavy date with. She sure must
i have trouble with those hands.
C. Guess I'll skip this next time.
