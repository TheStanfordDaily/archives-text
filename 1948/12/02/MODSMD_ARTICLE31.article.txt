## Bull Session LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
### 
To the Editor:
One of your stafT members who masquerades under the guise of a
humor columnist has recently made a practice oi saying that Stanloro
girls are pigs. This is not true. They may look like pigs, but they art
r.ot the real McCoy unless they can show a membership card in out
union. Under the circumstances, I feel we must ask the girls either to
affiliate with our group or abandon their beloved nickname.
Let's go whole-hog on this thing or not at all.

To the Editor:
During the past month. I, like you, have suffered a considerable loss

of pride and reputation because of "that incident."
I am writing you today to let you know that I now
have a prediction for next year that can't miss. I
l'eel that it is my duty to let you in on this knowledge.
Together we shall re-establish our reputations as
reliable prognosticators of future events.
Here's the scoop! Next year will be 1949!

This is to inform you that we think you should continue to print polls
ol future events in your paper. We know you have been the butt of many
jokes because of your polls, but we are still on your side.
We think polls are the greatest invention of man.

To the Editor:
Three months ago I am happy man. I have good job as grape-stomper
in Fresno winery. Then one day a man from Stanford University come
up to me and he say: "How would you like a job in the Cellar, Buddy?"
After working out in hot sun for so long, I figure maybe it would be
a good idea to work in nice cool cellar. I tell him yes.
"There's only one catch," he say. "We don't want you to wash your feet
before you come to work for us."
I thought this was rather strange, but I do as he tell me. Now I am
soriy i did. I should have stayed in Fresno.
Am I working in nice cool cellar? No! This place, it is hotter than a
plate of enchiladas. And what a lousy job they are giving me.
How would you like if your boss made you stir the Cellar coffee with
your wine-soaked feet? There must an easier way for them to make
"coffee royal," no?

humor columnist has recently made a practice oi saying that Stanloro
girls are pigs. This is not true. They may look like pigs, but they art
r.ot the real McCoy unless they can show a membership card in out
union. Under the circumstances, I feel we must ask the girls either to
affiliate with our group or abandon their beloved nickname.
Let's go whole-hog on this thing or not at all.

During the past month. I, like you, have suffered a considerable loss

of pride and reputation because of "that incident."
I am writing you today to let you know that I now
have a prediction for next year that can't miss. I
l'eel that it is my duty to let you in on this knowledge.
Together we shall re-establish our reputations as
reliable prognosticators of future events.
Here's the scoop! Next year will be 1949!

This is to inform you that we think you should continue to print polls

jokes because of your polls, but we are still on your side.
We think polls are the greatest invention of man.

To the Editor:
Three months ago I am happy man. I have good job as grape-stomper
in Fresno winery. Then one day a man from Stanford University come
up to me and he say: "How would you like a job in the Cellar, Buddy?"
After working out in hot sun for so long, I figure maybe it would be
a good idea to work in nice cool cellar. I tell him yes.
"There's only one catch," he say. "We don't want you to wash your feet
before you come to work for us."
I thought this was rather strange, but I do as he tell me. Now I am
soriy i did. I should have stayed in Fresno.
Am I working in nice cool cellar? No! This place, it is hotter than a
plate of enchiladas. And what a lousy job they are giving me.
How would you like if your boss made you stir the Cellar coffee with
your wine-soaked feet? There must an easier way for them to make
"coffee royal," no?
