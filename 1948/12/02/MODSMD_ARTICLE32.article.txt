## IFB Clarifies Rushing Issue 
### 
To the Editor:
The Interfraternity Board of Control has asked me to write you con
cerning two recent editorials in The Standford Daily. One editorial inti
mates, the other flatly states that more than one house is guilty of illegal
rushing.
The members of the Board are rather interested in your source of
information. You see, we have investigated 15 or 20 reported violations of
the rushing rules, and in only one case was the evidence so clearcut
from all sides that we felt justified to penalize the house and freshmen
involved. Admittedly, we are the last ones to hear of any illegal rushing,
but we have done our best to track down everything we do hear about.
So, maybe you know more than we do.
As a matter of fact, you are not the only one who has been free to
admit that a number of houses have done some illegal rushing. Many,
many fraternity and non-fraternity men have told me—and other mem
bers of the Board—the same thing. But no one seems willing or able
to offer proof or ideas of how to get it. Perhaps you do have the goods,
in which case we'll be more than happy to listen to and act on what
ever you have.
Our idea is not just to "saddle" one house with a penalty and let the
others who arc "equally guilty" go unpenalized. The Board is trying
very hard to act in a fair manner. We have spent hour upon hour this
quarter just making certain we were acting in all fairness.
Most of the criticism so far has been that the Board has not penalized
all the houses guilty of infraction. The same people who have offered
this criticism seem quite convinced that rushing has been going on. but
they also seem quite loath to give the board any information. Certainly
nothing we have discovered has been conclusive enough to warrant the
application of a penalty, except in one case.
So, if you—or anyone else—can suggest methods to improve the effi
ciency of the Board, it would be happy to hear from you. Insisting that
the rushing "rules be backed by action" is commendable. You may be
able to help us do so.
If only 19 of the 24 fraternities—as you intimated—are obeying the
rules, some houses are getting a big jump on the others. This is grossly
unfair to the fraternities which are lawful and decent, which are trying
to obey the rules. Every fraternity man who belongs to one of the 19
houses playing the game squarely should be interested in seeing penalties
to those houses guilty of infractions.
However, the Board can't just apply penalties every time it hears a
rumor. The Board must have definite proof of infractions. So far we
hi ven't seen the proof, nor have we been able to dig it up. If you—or
ethers can supply the necessary information, we will appreciate your
assistance.
With what you have to say about Dean Kimpton, I am in most hearty
accord. As a member of the Inter'fraternity Board he has worked hard
and long for fraternity interests. In many cases. Dean Kimpton has
worked harder in a fraternity's behalf than it has itself. Yes, we are
definitely taking advantage of a man who wants to help us help ourselves.
You certainly hit the nail there.
So. this letter is certainly not a gripe about your editorial. The Board
sincerely wants whatever help you or others can give it, but co-operation
is at least a two-sided affair.
