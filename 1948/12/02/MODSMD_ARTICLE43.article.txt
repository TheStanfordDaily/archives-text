# Students Get Job Assistance

The Student - Faculty Employ- I
ment Committee by fill odds is |
probably the least publicized or- !
ganization on the campus, but to
many a student it has proven one
of the most helpful.
From students with complaints
about working conditions to .stu- |
dents on part - time jobs in town !
who may have wage disagreements
with their employers, the Student-
Faculty Employment Committee
has assumed the task of fact-finding

and arbitration. And the outcome
of the organization's mediation,
since its establishment in January,
1947, has usually worked to the ad
vantage of the student.
The committee consists of four
students (two of whom must have
experience working part-time), one
faculty representative, one repre
sentative from the business office,
and Mrs. Clotildc Edwards, director
of student employment and chair
man of the committee, representing
the Dean of Students' office.
Another important function of
the committee is to act upon re
quests for soliciting on campus. As
all solicitors must obtain permits
both from the Stanford police de
partment and from Mrs. Edwards,
the committee judges the merit of
all requests. This is not only to bar
those agents who wowld be an un
wanted nuisance, but also to in
sure due consideration to needy
students desiring soliciting conces
sions as a means of supplementing
income.
Present committee membership
includes June Harrell, Gordon
Yates. Thomas Carey, and Donald
Fix. representing the Associated
Students; Dwight Adams, business
office representative; Rixford Sny
der. faculty representative; and
Mrs. Edwards.
