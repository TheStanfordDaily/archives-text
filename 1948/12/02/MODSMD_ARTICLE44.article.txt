Let Christmas shopping time
he Clothes Closet tunc with
you. If you're like me.
you've been racking your
brains for ideas for mother,
sister, cousin, and auntie—
ideas of something pretty,
something useful, and yet
something you can afford.
Why don't you try lingerie
(his year?
Here are my suggestions:
hose are always appreciated
and Belle Sharmeer hose will
make a special hit because you
can get just the right length
(they come in three leg sizes)
and for only $1.65. For sister
or cousin how about nylon
panties by Vanity Fair, $3.95,
or a Radelle slip, $7.95? And
for mother this year — why
don't you surprise and please
her with a beautiful quilted
rayon satin robe at only $25?
All these items are exclu
sive with Clothes Closet.
Come in and see them, won't
you?

P.S. The Clothes Closet is
at 520 Ramona—just look for
the big oak tree.
