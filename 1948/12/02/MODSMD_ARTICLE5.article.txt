## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1 (>Pi.—
Madame Chiang Kai-shek reached
the capital today to set oIT an ur
gent new campaign by the Chinese
Nationalists for firmer American
backing against their Communist
foes.
China's first lady was tight-lipped
on her own immediate plans. But
Ambassador Wellington Koo, short
ly after a hurried conference with
her, voiced a plea for help before
it is "too late."'
With the Communists sweeping
almost to Nanking, Koo declared in
a speech in New York that all Asia
as well as China was in peril of
falling behind the Iron Curtain. He
said this might increase a "hun
dredfold" the burden of the United
States "as the leader of freedom's
crusade."
Without spelling out what help
the Nationalists require, he said
they were ready to accept "corrup
tion proof American control of
any new aid spending. Koo flew to
New York for the address before
the China Institute and arranged to
return to the capital tonight.
Madame Chiang, smiling but si
lent, stepped from her plane and
went immediately to the nearby
Lees burg, Va., home of the Secre
tary of State and Mrs. Marshall,
