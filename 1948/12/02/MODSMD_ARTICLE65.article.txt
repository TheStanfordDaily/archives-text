# Ex-Stanfordite Writes About French Soccer
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
The soccer team received an in
teresting letter the other day from
Randy Hudson, last year's soccer
goalie, who is now at the Sorbonne
University in France. Randy has
been in France for nearly three
months, and he points out in hi*
letter some very interesting facts
about European soccer.
"These fellows play a 5-2-0-1."
says Randy. "I didn't believe Skip
per when he said'this was so. They
play a man-for-man, which
means that often both fullbacks are
in enemy territory. The goalie must
play well up to catch long passes
by the opponents over the defend
ing fullbacks.
Also, the fullbacks must be as
fast as the forward they guard or
else the opponents can drop the

ball behind them and the forward,
once he beats his fullback, has a
clean shot at the net.
"The passing really is quite benu
tiful here. The defense is so tight
that the pass must lead the receiver
by quite a bit; if the pass were cii
rectly to him he'd have to wait for
it and it would be intercepted. With
this leading it is not uncommon to
see a pass into seemingly empty
giound suddenly speared by a
player who seems to have popped
out of nowhere."
Hudson also pointed out that a
good soccer player is not in a class
by himself, but just an average
player who tries harder. A player
who has the ability to do what he
wants to do has a great advantage
over other players.
Incidentally. Randy says that the
$75 a month he receives from the
government puts him in the upper
income bracket in France. He re
ceives 23,475 francs a month, while
the coal miners recently went on
strike for 14,500 a month.
