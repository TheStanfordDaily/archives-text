## 
### 
Under the watchful eye of many
Card cinder enthusiasts, the Stan
ford varsity and frosh tracksters
round'd out their fall training pro
gram yesterday with the second
half of their two-day meet.
Ace distance man A! Lyons, who
ran a 4:30 mile in the first day ol
the meet, turned in the outstanding
performance ol the afternoon by
running the grueling two-mile in
9:49.9. Sturdy Jose Fael. the other
veteran distance man, came in close
behind Lyons in 9:51 minutes. Both
of these times are excellent for fall
track.
Soph Wins Lou Hurdles
Sophomore Eob Bryan ripped
through the 220-yard low hurdles
in 24.6 seconds, followed closely by
veterans Downing McKee and Dell
Russell. It looks like another strong
year for the Indians in the hurdles,
if this trio can keep up the good
work in the spring.
With frosh sprinter Howard Bug
bee out of the race, teammate Pete
Sanford romped through a fast 220-
yard dash and won it in 22.5 sec
onds. Pete placed third in the 100-
yard dash in the first day of the
meet, so the yearlings look excep
tionally strong in the sprint events.
Pitch Johnson, varsity quarter-mile
victor, placed second in the 220-
yard dash.
Last year's frosh captain, George
Mooers, won the half-mile run in
2:01.2 minutes. With teammates
Drew Terramorse and A 1 Holubar
on the sidelines, Mooers won the
race handily. Bud Cohen, former
prep star from San Jose, led the
frosh half-milers, and placed sec
ond only to Mooers.
End of Autumn Season
With the two - day intrasquad
meet finished, the trackmen will
hang up their spikes until winter
quarter, when they will resume
their training until the regular sea
son in the spring. Over a hundred
aspirants for the varsity and frosh
teams are expected to report next
quarter.
Varsity Coach Jack Weiershauser
and Frosh Coach Ray Dean have
been pleased with most of the per
formances, but several spots on
both teams have yet to be filled.
