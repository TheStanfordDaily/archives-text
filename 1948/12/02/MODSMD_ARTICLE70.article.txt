## 
### BOD BERNSTEIN 
Clayton Neill to Don Glas?
that's the ATO scoring punch t:
spelled death to the Phi Delt R,>-
in yesterday's mural
battle.
ATO took the title with a 13
win over the Rams, due mainly
a sterling passing and running pe
formance turned in by Neil!,
was hardly a one-man show. 1;
Neill's outstanding work ea.-
spelled the difference between tv
otherwise closely matched squat
The ATO's drew first blood ea;
in the contest and were never set
ously pressed thereafter. Lou 3
Groza started the fireworks by i
tereepting a pass by Phi Delt Da
Dahle on the Ram 37-yard line.
Neill packed the ball to the
on first down, then shot a forwa
to Glass on second down whi
carried all the way. Glass
the toss on the 22 just a few inch
inside the west sideline, tight-rop
the chalk-mark for five yards, th
cut loose with a burst of speed tl
left the Ram secondary far behit
The Phi back roari
for revenge, and almost got it. W
George Little passing to Gor
Rice, the Rams moved to the A"
30 following the kickoff; but anotl
Little to Rice effort at this po
fell harmlessly to the ground in t
end zone when Rice slipped just
he was crossing the goal line.
That was the last threat of t
first half, and it ended G-0 for t
ATO's.
Ranis Almost Score
Once again, following the secor
half kickoff. the Rams came to 1
to throw a scare into their opi
nents. This time they drove all t
way from their own 21 to the A f
8 with Little pitching to D;
Dahle. Buzz Hege, and Ed Fil
in rotation. But they were stooj.
at this point by the defensive fu
of Dave Bradshaw. who tw
caught Little behind the line
five ATO possession on their o
16.
Neill and Company promptly i
taliated with the lonsest drive
the ball game to settle the iss
once and for all. Neill ran for n
yards and a first down, passed
Glass for seven, fired one to J
Trabucco for e'even, connected w
Dave Elliott for nine, then capj
the drive with another pitch
Glass which covered the remain
30 yards. Neill (where have
heard that name before?) passed
Bob Masters for the extra p<>
and that was the ball game. 13-C
Little. Dahle, Rice, and big Vt
Percell ol! looked good for
Rams; but they weren't quite e<
enough to beat the Neill -G1
combo.
