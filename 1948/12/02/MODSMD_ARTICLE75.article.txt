# Wrestlers Schedule Ten Dual Meets for 1949 Winter Season
## 
### 
With 10 dual meets scheduled for winter quarter, an improved
Stanford wrestling team faces the 1949 season with a chance
of developing into one of the top squads in the Coast.
The Indians will open the season January 13 when they meet
California at Berkeley. Later on they will meet San Jose State,

San Francisco State, California Poly,
and Santa Clara.
Leading the Indian grapplers again
this year will be student coach Vein
Jones. Vern won the Far Western
title last year, and also won the
West Coast Olympic Trials in the
145-pound class. Vern plans to scale
down to 136 this year and in that
weight no one on the Coast should
give him trouble.
In the 155-pound class, Jim Kur
fess, a three-letter man, has won
the nod and will be a consistent
winner. Backing up Jim is Ray
Harris who wrestled well last year
until sidelined with a shoulder in-

jury.
Dick Cruce, an able performer last
year, is the top man in the 128-pound
class at present, but Jay Hughs is
pushing him for a varsity berth.
Dick showed promise in his first
year and will be tough to beat now
that he has gained experience.
Winston Tops at 145
In the 145 division Dan Winston
has the inside track with Al Ander
son scheduled to give him plenty of
competition. Dan won the 1946 Far
Western in the 155, and returns to
eligibility this year after transfer
ing from Kansas University.
Dick Esbenshade has eveiy thing
his own way in the 121, and with
two years' experience Dick is set
to give his opponents a bad time.
Roy Gaskin has recovered from a
bad ankle sprain which marred his
.1948 season and seems to have the
165-pound class sewed up, Larry
Kain has improved and promises to
give Roy some trouble, but Gaskin's
three years of experience should be
too much for Kain to overcome.
The 175 is a question mark this
year, as no experienced man has ap
peared to strengthen the Indian team

in this weigh t. Dick DeWitt is pow
erful and apt but lacks experience,
while Bill Sharp and Bob Stanley |
are more experienced but are not
definitely committed to the sport for
this year. .
Garst Doubtful
The heavyweight class this year
will be immensely strengthened if
Dave Garst is declared eligible.
Dave won the Far Western in 1947
but his eligibility is questionable
because he spent a semester at lowa
State and trasnferred back to Stan- J
ford spring quarter.
In case Dave is ineligible, his
brother, Steve Garst. or Jack White ;
will take over the heavyweight
class. Both men are experienced '
and will be much improved this ,
year.
Although the team seeing to be
well supplied with experienced men
Jones emphasized that there are j
still openings for men who are in- j
interested, and said that junior var- [
sity and freshman meets will be 1
scheduled. He also said that an ele- j
mentary class will be taught next j
quarter for freshmen.

two years' experience Dick is set
to give his opponents a bad time.
Roy Gaskin has recovered from a
bad ankle sprain which marred his
.1948 season and seems to have the
165-pound class sewed up, Larry
Kain has improved and promises to
give Roy some trouble, but Gaskin's
three years of experience should be
too much for Kain to overcome.
The 175 is a question mark this
year, as no experienced man has ap
peared to strengthen the Indian team

in this weigh t. Dick DeWitt is pow
erful and apt but lacks experience,
while Bill Sharp and Bob Stanley |
are more experienced but are not
definitely committed to the sport for
this year. .
Garst Doubtful
The heavyweight class this year
will be immensely strengthened if
Dave Garst is declared eligible.
Dave won the Far Western in 1947
but his eligibility is questionable
because he spent a semester at lowa
State and trasnferred back to Stan- J
ford spring quarter.
In case Dave is ineligible, his
brother, Steve Garst. or Jack White ;
will take over the heavyweight
class. Both men are experienced '
and will be much improved this ,
year.
Although the team seeing to be
well supplied with experienced men
Jones emphasized that there are j
still openings for men who are in- j
interested, and said that junior var- [
sity and freshman meets will be 1
scheduled. He also said that an ele- j
mentary class will be taught next j
quarter for freshmen.
With 10 dual meets scheduled for winter quarter, an improved
Stanford wrestling team faces the 1949 season with a chance
of developing into one of the top squads in the Coast.
The Indians will open the season January 13 when they meet
California at Berkeley. Later on they will meet San Jose State,

San Francisco State, California Poly,
and Santa Clara.
Leading the Indian grapplers again
this year will be student coach Vein
Jones. Vern won the Far Western
title last year, and also won the
West Coast Olympic Trials in the
145-pound class. Vern plans to scale
down to 136 this year and in that
weight no one on the Coast should
give him trouble.
In the 155-pound class, Jim Kur
fess, a three-letter man, has won
the nod and will be a consistent
winner. Backing up Jim is Ray
Harris who wrestled well last year
until sidelined with a shoulder in-

Dick Cruce, an able performer last
year, is the top man in the 128-pound
class at present, but Jay Hughs is
pushing him for a varsity berth.
Dick showed promise in his first
year and will be tough to beat now
that he has gained experience.
Winston Tops at 145
In the 145 division Dan Winston
has the inside track with Al Ander
son scheduled to give him plenty of
competition. Dan won the 1946 Far
Western in the 155, and returns to
eligibility this year after transfer
ing from Kansas University.
