Stanford s potent scjuatl,
looking like money in the bank in
its first three contests, invades
Frank Walsh's Cow Palace this
weekend to battle St. Mary's and
Santa Clara.
The Indians square oil against St.
Mary's tomorrow night at 7:45 p.m.
in the first part of a double-header
"special" that also features Califor

St. Mary's should offer plenty of
opposition for the Cards when the
two teams set together to help in
itiate the opening of the 19-18-49

Frank Walsh, the man who runs
the place, says that the Cow Pal
ace will offer as good a cage menu
as any other casaba barn in the
country this season.

Both basketball games will be
broadcast over KYA, beginning
at 7:45 each night. Stanford plays
1 the first game Friday and the
second Saturday.

In ringing up the curtain on this
big show, Stanford and St. Mary's
figure to stage a four-star perform
ance. The homebreds, hot on the
trail of their fourth straight win,
will run into Frank "Apples" Ku
delka, the St. Mary's cutie who has
been running wild with the point
totals for the past two years.
Kudelka will be backed up by
some good boys as the Gaels try
to get back at Stanford for their
47-45 loss of last season. Gus Cha
valas dropped in a last-minute push
shot to win that one, as 12,]36 fans,
the largest crowd ever to watch a
coast game, got their money's worth.
Santa Clara, always a rough cus
tomer for the Cards, will furnish the
trouble for Saturday night. Stan
ford polished off the B rones to the
tune of 53 to 41 in '47.

will run into Frank "Apples" Ku
delka, the St. Mary's cutie who has
been running wild with the point
totals for the past two years.
Kudelka will be backed up by
some good boys as the Gaels try
to get back at Stanford for their
47-45 loss of last season. Gus Cha
valas dropped in a last-minute push
shot to win that one, as 12,]36 fans,
the largest crowd ever to watch a
coast game, got their money's worth.
Santa Clara, always a rough cus
tomer for the Cards, will furnish the
trouble for Saturday night. Stan
ford polished off the B rones to the
tune of 53 to 41 in '47.
