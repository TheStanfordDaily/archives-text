# Two-Thirds Is Vital--AWS
## 
### 
AWS Cabinet yesterday afternoon
passed the following motion con
cerning the by-law to the AWS
Charter in answer to Excom's ac
tion on the by - law Wednesday
night:
"AWS Cabinet continues to feel
that a two-thirds vote is necessary
for major issues concerning the
women students of Stanford Uni
versity."
Excom at its Wednesday night
meeting changed the original text
of the by-law which read "The is
sue, in order to pass, must receive
a two-thirds majority of votes cast"
to "a simple majority of votes cast."
AWS Cabinet feels that a two
thirds majority vote would be wiser
because such a vote on a major
issue, such as'the Demerit Plan,
would indicate a greater area of
approval than a simple majority
vote. A defeat by one-third of the
women would then indicate that
the issue should be reconsidered,
whereas a simple majority vote
would not be a true test of any pro
posal concerning all women stu
dents.
Excom, it was pointed out, felt
that a two-thirds vote would result
in a small group blocking the de
sires of the majority.
Because of this motion passed by
AWS Cabinet, the Demerit Plan
will not be voted on until new vot
ing procedure by - laws are ap
proved by Excom.
It was announced that social
