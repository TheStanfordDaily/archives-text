## That Bookstore Rush 
### 
Early this quarter a Daily columnist offered a solution to the
registration week Bookstore rush. In brief, this proposed plan
would transform textbook counter mobs into a single, orderly
line. As each student was waited upon, he would hand order
slips for textbooks to a salesgirl. The order slip would list the
title of the book, the author, the name of the course, and the
instructor's name. One order slip would be used for each text
book purchased.
Such a sales method offers several advantages. First, students
would not crowd around the textbook counter. Secondly, each
student in the proposed line would hand the salesgirl his order
slips bearing the exact information of the texts desired. Then
salesgirls would not have to interpret half-correct titles to book
requests. A third benefit to hurried students would be an in
direct one. Hard-working salesgirls would find their jobs better
organized and the service would improve accordingly.
One main disadvantage might nullify this revised textbook
buying plan. The Bookstore was originally constructed to dis
tribute texts and supplies to 3,500 students. Therefore, it can
not maintain orderly lines if most of the 8,350 of the present
student body continue to crowd the supply, jewelry, and gen
eral book counters during busy registration days. If an orderly
line forms at one counter, organized lines should also form at
all counters. However, the small size of the Bookstore prohibits
formation of student lines at every counter.
The Daily suggests, then, that Bookstore management and
academic department staffs provide students with mimeographed
order slips for their required textbooks during registration week.
After that, each student would present all his slips to purchase
his books. Small counter jams might still persist, but they would
not congest the store's main aisle because students would move
in and out of the store more rapidly.
An alternate suggestion, if the academic department staffs
cannot mimeograph.order slips in time for winter quarter regis
tration, is that the Bookstore might place several tables outside
the store. Blank order slips and mimeographed book lists would
be provided there. Students would refer to the book lists, and
fill out one for each text before entering the Bookstore. This
system is the one currently used by veterans buying texts with
veterans' credit cards.
Now is the time for academic department staffs-and the Book
store management to organize a new text distribution system
for next quarter. Students would co-operate to eliminate all
congestion during registration and substitute a much smoother
procedure.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore authorities would like to hear sug
gestions from students or faculty members. Letters addressed to
the store or to The Daily editor will be turned over to the Book
store management.
