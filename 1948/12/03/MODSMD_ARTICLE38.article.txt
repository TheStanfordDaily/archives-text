Senior Officers Outline Plan
To the Editor:
There is no question about itâ€”the senior class is in an uncomfortable
position from a financial standpoint. As pointed out yesterday in The
Daily, at the present time we have $375.33 in the treasury, and we
already have actual fixed obligations that must be met amounting to
at least $715.
It is necessary to give $400 to the Alumni Association in order to plan
fcr future class reunions; the Mechanical Engineering Society will have
to be paid approximately $250 for the class plate that will be placed in
front of the Church; $(>5 must be paid to the Quad for the senior section;
and finally, we must remember that it is customary for each graduating
class to leave a gift to the University.
The present plan, whereby we will sell magazine subscriptions and
renewals, is the best possible "get rich fast" program that we could
possibly undertake. However, the success of this drive will not depend
upon the efforts of a few, but upon the co-operative actions of the entire
class, with each person doing his share. This is the time when the one
or two or even three subscriptions that you can sell will be an important
contribution to the class, and in the long run will be of benefit to you
as an individual.
The advantages of a large treasury to the members of the class are
obvious. The larger the treasury, the smaller will be the cost to anyone
who attends any of our future social events. Ultimately, we will strive
t.) ieduce the cost of the Senior Ball bids to the lowest possible price.
We sincerely hope that each member of the class will do all that
he can to make this drive a success. All of the necessary subscription
blanks and information concerning the various magazines can be obtained
Irom the senior in charge of subscription sales in your living group. We
have a definite challenge before us, and it can be met if we all work
together for the benefit of the class and ouiselves.
