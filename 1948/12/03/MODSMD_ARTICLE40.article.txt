This isn't a suggestion for a pre
j Big Game raid, but eight students
i from the Massachusetts Institute of
| Technology had a powerful idea
j when they planted explosives in
j Soldiers Field before the Harvard
j Yale game.
The blast was intended to initial
| the 50-yard line with the letters
! "MIT directly after the opening
j kick-off. The pranksters placed ex
; plosive wiring beneath the midfield
] turf and stationed the detonating
! point under the stands behind the
; 30-yard line.
The stunt, which was discovered
j long before game time, was con
! ceived by the students as an "ini
; tiative toward a good, clean Har
| vard-MIT rivalry." However, the
I police and college authorities didn't
j think the idea was good, clean, or
funny. When last heard of, the
eight students weren't laughing ei
ther.

MIT may blast, but the students
I at Victoria College in Vancouver,

I field.
Over 350 coeds and men hacked
| their muddy way through 2,000 feet
I of drainage ditches and laid drains
during a voluntary work day last
month. The school board admitted
that the work bee had saved much
I time and a "considerable amount"
I of money.

Care to try a Truman cocktail?
The Spartan Daily recently told
ot' a '"Harry Truman cocktail" fea
j tured by a Chinese restaurant in
! New York City. The concoction is
! a mixture of sloe gin, Scotch, creme
! de menthe, and mui kwai lu whisky.
A sign promises customers: "One
; drink and you take on the whole

MIT has announced that their fe

No limits on women in Williams

i en at fraternity houses were sus-

council's new code of conduct and

An "Ugliest Man on Campus"
contest was run recently by Cen
tenary College in Shreveport, La.
j The winner was picked by student
| vote. Prizes included a date with a
; campus - beauty, two free dinners,
' free dancing and refreshments, and
various gifts for the couple.
But the most novel prize of all
! was ofiered by the establishment
which gave the UMOC a gold knife
"with the promise that if he mar

i for a wedding ring, and if he didn't
he could cut his throat."

This isn't a suggestion for a pre
j Big Game raid, but eight students
i from the Massachusetts Institute of

j when they planted explosives in
j Soldiers Field before the Harvard
j Yale game.
The blast was intended to initial
| the 50-yard line with the letters
! "MIT directly after the opening
j kick-off. The pranksters placed ex
; plosive wiring beneath the midfield
] turf and stationed the detonating
! point under the stands behind the
; 30-yard line.
The stunt, which was discovered
j long before game time, was con
! ceived by the students as an "ini
; tiative toward a good, clean Har
| vard-MIT rivalry." However, the
I police and college authorities didn't
j think the idea was good, clean, or
funny. When last heard of, the
eight students weren't laughing ei
