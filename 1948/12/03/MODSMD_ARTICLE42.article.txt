To the Editor:
There is, I believe, some response required by Miss Oldham's provo<
tive letter. My first injunction to anyone observing the conflict t
concerned in it would be, "Review the two systems of penalization
your .soli. Take into consideration all related issues: the legal power
Women s Council and the moral sensibility of its members; the area
contradiction between a woman's 'individual responsibility' and 1
imposition of any penalization whatsoever; the number of women w
have not that high sense of 'social responsibilty' regarding five minu
difference in arriving home at night; and, the actual relation betwe
social regulations and a gill's moral behavior and grade average.''
My personal conclusions are numerous. The bonus system is the o:
adequate one under consideration. There is hardly a woman at Stanfi
who has not, at one time or another, benefited by a bonus system. Fr<
its coverage of small, occasional tardiness to its attenuation of sev<
penalties in the case of understandable but foolish reasons for late i
turns. That the system of penalization superimposed upon the bonus
cumbersome and infantile is not denied by those who object to the m
system—l heartily concur with Miss Oldham. However, Miss Oldh;
would have a new system in which none of the faults of the old i
removed, and all of its ameliorative provisions are swept away. 1 ;
of those who would rather suffer the consequences of infractions a
remain in the University, than be left on my "own responsibility" un
such a time as five girls decide that my "social attitude" is undesiral
and send me packing without the education I am paving for.
The constant recourse to "interpretation" of the new system indicai
a danger inherent in it. This business of "relative merits" is entirt
too flexible and ambiguous for my tastes. When her case becon
"serious" the woman will go before Council. She may or m
not feel it serious enough to lie about in order to remain in the Universi
The Council is to decide whether she is lying (will they demand w
nesses?), and whether or not her excuse is adequate. I leave you
infer the rest.
Since I am graduating shortly, I feel that my attitude is reasonably u
uetei mined. II Miss Oldham wishes to consult me as to a more adecjUi
means of social regulations, I would be willing to consider them wi
liei. In the meantime, I am obsessed with the desire to throw stones
glass constructions.
I hope all other women on campus are cognizant of the fact tl
they will not be called before any committee until the bonus is exceedt

A Few More Words on the Bonus
To the Editor:
There is, I believe, some response required by Miss Oldham's provo<
tive letter. My first injunction to anyone observing the conflict t
concerned in it would be, "Review the two systems of penalization
your .soli. Take into consideration all related issues: the legal power
Women s Council and the moral sensibility of its members; the area
contradiction between a woman's 'individual responsibility' and 1
imposition of any penalization whatsoever; the number of women w
have not that high sense of 'social responsibilty' regarding five minu
difference in arriving home at night; and, the actual relation betwe
social regulations and a gill's moral behavior and grade average.''
My personal conclusions are numerous. The bonus system is the o:
adequate one under consideration. There is hardly a woman at Stanfi
who has not, at one time or another, benefited by a bonus system. Fr<
its coverage of small, occasional tardiness to its attenuation of sev<
penalties in the case of understandable but foolish reasons for late i
turns. That the system of penalization superimposed upon the bonus
cumbersome and infantile is not denied by those who object to the m
system—l heartily concur with Miss Oldham. However, Miss Oldh;
would have a new system in which none of the faults of the old i
removed, and all of its ameliorative provisions are swept away. 1 ;
of those who would rather suffer the consequences of infractions a
remain in the University, than be left on my "own responsibility" un
such a time as five girls decide that my "social attitude" is undesiral
and send me packing without the education I am paving for.
The constant recourse to "interpretation" of the new system indicai
a danger inherent in it. This business of "relative merits" is entirt
too flexible and ambiguous for my tastes. When her case becon
"serious" the woman will go before Council. She may or m
not feel it serious enough to lie about in order to remain in the Universi
The Council is to decide whether she is lying (will they demand w
nesses?), and whether or not her excuse is adequate. I leave you
infer the rest.
Since I am graduating shortly, I feel that my attitude is reasonably u
uetei mined. II Miss Oldham wishes to consult me as to a more adecjUi
means of social regulations, I would be willing to consider them wi
liei. In the meantime, I am obsessed with the desire to throw stones
glass constructions.
I hope all other women on campus are cognizant of the fact tl
they will not be called before any committee until the bonus is exceedt
