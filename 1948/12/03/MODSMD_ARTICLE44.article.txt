>cause Dick Alberton, grad Law School student, and lour hun

I of getting up at five a.m. to make eight o'clock classes,
Ihern Pacific train schedules may be changed.
mong the students who commute, there are four hundred
ity-seven who travel from i —

Francisco furnishes 121 com

miters have to catch earlier

berton, fed up with the loss of
) and time, decided early this
ter that something could be

? compiled a list of all students
were commuting from cities
h of Redwood CUy. This took
ral hours of thumbing through
stration files in the ASSU office.
1 almost five hundred names on
list, plus the addresses of those
ents living in San Francisco,
;rton went to the Southern Pa-
Company, requesting a change
rain schedules so that the stu
s would arrive in Palo Alto a
minutes before, rather than
after classes begin.

ises started at ten minutes after
hour then, but had been
iged to allow Village residents
minutes longer for lunch. There
little transportation between
Village and the campus at that
?, so the need for extra lunch
2 was apparent.
t the request of Village Director
ight Adams, the Village Council
ducted a poll of students there,
ascertain their feelings about re
ting to the old schedule. The
ncil reported that those students
ed felt that such a change would
/e them too little time for lunch,
ot completely satisfied with the
t results. Alberton said that with
high ratio of cars at the Vil
?, the students there should not
so pressed for time as they were
i years ago.
.1 berton next approached Dean
vrence Kimpton and asked that

he look into the matter. Dean
Kimpton 'Said yesterday that in view
of the report by the Village Council,
he does not believe that reverting
to the old class schedule would be
wise at this time.
He added, "Now that the problem
of the commuting students has
been brought to our attention, we
shall consider the various methods
suggested for solving it, and utilize
tne one which seems to us the best
solution for all concerned."
Official Request
Dean Kimpton has already sent a
letter to J. J. McDonough of the
Southern Pacific Company making
an official request for a change in
train schedules.
In addition, Dean Kimpton will re
quest some department of the Uni
versity to compile and maintain a
file of commuters' names and ad
dresses so that interested students
may arrange car pools or share-the
ride groups.
A staff member of the San Jose
State College newspaper is aiding
Alberton by enlisting the support
of the commuting students there
who are also adversely affected by
present train schedules.
An official of Southern Pacific has
promised Alberton that the sched
ules will be changed if at least two
hundred students agree to use the
trains in the future.
Alberton has asked that interested
students write to him at 16 Laguna
Street, San Francisco, so that he
can convince Southern Pacific of the
need for a change.
