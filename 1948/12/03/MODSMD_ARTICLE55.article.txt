the students living on campus and in
the Village. Nearly 63 per cent of
the men and women did not believe
that another major war would break
out within two years. Seventeen per
cent of the students had no opinion
to offer.
Twice the percentage of women as
men believed another major war was
imminent. In the same opinion sur
vey. more women than men favored
j (he proposed Universal Military
i Training Plan.

lieved that Russia and the United
States would oppose each other if
