# Council Convicts Student for Code Violation in Exam
## 
### 
Men's Council announced yester
day that a student has been found
guilty of violating the Honor Code
and suspended from the University
for two quarters. The student also
received an F in the course.
The offender hau copied another
student's Economics 1 mid-quarter
examination this quarter. The two
students' papers were almost iden
tical, even to grammatical errors.
However, the student whose paper
was copied left the examination
room before the copier, and the lat
ter was forced to finish the exam on
his own.

The answers written by the guilty
student showed that "he didn't
know what he was talking about,"
said the professor in the course.
This showed which of the two stu
dents had violated the Honor Code.
The guilty stucient later admitted
his guilt and exonerated the other
student, who would also have been
guilty of violating the Code if he
had been aware that his paper was
being copied.
Present at Council meeting were
Tom Diamond, chairman; A 1 Munk
secretary; Bill Richardson. Fred
Loomis, Bob Anderson. Rod White,
and Hawley Smith, Honor Code
committee chairman.
