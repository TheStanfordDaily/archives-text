# Bookstore Rebates Wanted by SIRO
## 
### 
Gretchen Blaesing, co-chairman
of SIKO, announces that a rebate
slip box will lie placed in the
Bookstore today. SIKO would
appreciate it if everyone would
drop at least some of their re
bate slips in this box. The slips
received will be turned in next
spring, and the money will be
used for European relief.
