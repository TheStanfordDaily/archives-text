# DU PONT Digest For Students of Science and Engineering
## Science paints the future 
### 
41 of every 1,000 U. S. chemists are
engaged in production of paints,
lacquers, varnishes and colors
Modern paint making is an outstand
ing example of chemistry at work—
of the way the scientific approach
has replaced rule-of-thumb methods.
Today, paints are formulated by
chemists to meet specific needs. In
their search for better finishes, these
highly trained technicalmen are aided
by the electron microscope and infra
rod spectroscope. A variety of gonio-

photometric and spectrophotometry
devices are used by the physicist and
physical chemist in the study of gloss
and color.
Du Pont men have produced many
superior finishes. One of thorn,
"Dulux" nitrocellulose; lacquer, made
mass production of automobiles pos
sible by shortening paint drying time
112 rom weeks to hours.
Finish failures — chipping and
scratching—were costing manufac
turers of home refrigerators a million
dollars a year before Du Pont chem
ists developed "Dulux" synthetic
resin enamels, based on alkyd resins.
A "Dulux" coating on metal or wood
dries into a film that even a hammer

blow won't break. Tests with me
chanical scrubbers prove it outwears
old-style enamels by more than five
times. "Dulux" enamels now guard
boats, large and small, as well as
petroleum tank farms, machinery and
other industrial installations.
At Du Font's paint laboratories, a
wide range of materials is understudy.
Where tlie colloid chemist, the phys
ical and organic chemist, the analyst,
physicist and other technically
trained men leave off', the chemical
engineer, mechanical engineer and
metallurgist stand ready to design
equipment to make better commer
cial production possible.
Modern equipment speeds research
Many of today's research tools are
complex and expensive. The modern
research worker may use a $30,000

mass spectrometer installat ion which
can make an analysis in three hours
that formerly took three months.
High pressure equipment, ultra cen
trifuges, molecular stills, and com
plete reference libraries are other
tools which speed research and en
large its scope.
Young scientists joining the Da
Pont organization have at their dis
posal the finest equipment available.
Moreover they enjoy the stimulation
of working with some of the most
able scientists in their fields, in groups

small enough to bring about quick
recognition of individual talent and
capabilities. They find here the op
portunity, cooperation and friendly
encouragement they need. Thus dun
can do their best work, both for the
organization and themselves.
