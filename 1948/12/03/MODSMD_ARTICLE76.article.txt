# Guild Shows Rank Movie
## 
### 
"The Brothers," as originally
produced, was probably a whale of
a motion picture. The natural
northern England sets are great; (he
plot is lousy, but interesting; the
characters are well cast. But the
abortion now showing at the Guild
is not the original "Brothers"; it is
not interesting; and it is not worth
the price of admission. Don't go to
see it.
The reason for this inglorious de
bacle is, of all things, the little
green man with the bright shiny
shears—the censor. Any time the
heroine, the bundlesome Patricia
Roc. shows skin above her elbow,
clip! The audience not only loses
what it came for, it loses track of
what is happening.
Tlie plot of this piece of J. Arthur
Rank confetti is—at best—unusual.

A lovely, sensuous (so they say—
you don t see it) young gal, fresh
from a convent, goes to live with
an old man and his two wolf-like
sons. The action takes place on tha
Isle of Skye. She (Miss Roc) irj
going to make like a housekeeper.
(As far as the censor is concerned,
that's all she does do.) Both broth
ers fall madly in love with her. She
likes the one who isn't an idiot. It
goes on from there — somewhere.
The ending is somehow loused up.
Nobody lives happily ever after.
The audience is likely to leave
the theater wishing they had seen
the parts the censor kept.— Al
Berry
