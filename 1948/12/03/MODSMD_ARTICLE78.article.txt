# Card Cagers Open Cow Palace Season
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's fast-moving Indian cagers will run into Frank "Ap
ples" Kudelka and his St. Mary's Gaels tonight at 7:45 p.m.
when the Gaels and the Cards get together to mix it up in the
curtain raiser of the Cow Palace basketball season.
California's Golden Bears will meet Santa Clara in the second

half of tonight's double header, and
Stanford will get the finale assign
ment tomorrow night against Santa
Clara. Second games start at 9:15
p.m. It's all part of the fan-pleasing
■ Cow Palace program of two games
I for the price of one.
Ten thousand students of the game
| of bounce are expected to turn out
to see the Bay Area's fcest swing
| into action. Feature clash of the
, weekend will be tonight's opener, as
| Kudelka goes after the so far suc
| cessful Redshirts. Twelve thousand
i spectators were on hand last season
i when these two teams met.
Cards Gun for Fourth Win
Stanford will be gunning for its
I fourth consecutive win, but the
j Deanmen will have to go all out to
beat a veteran St. Mary's quintet.
Gael Coach Bennie Neff has
formed his entire offense around
Frank Kudelka, the fabulous Moraga
j flash who is one of the most out-
I standing individual performers to
hit the Coast since Hank Luisetti
| was going through his paces.
Last season, the saying went that
[ if you stopped Kudelka you stopped
St. Mary's. But that just isn't true
i this season. Guards Jack Rial and
Fred Bullkinkle add power to a
| well-balanced outfit.
St. Mary's First Test
It will be St. Mary's first contest
J of the year, so Stanford gains a
slight advantage there. The Cards
i have three games under ther belts.
To combat the Kudelka menace.
| Everett Dean will dust off his de-
I fensive ace, Bob Lewis. Tall "Whip"'
j Lewis, noted for his feats of holding
| men such as Don Barksdale and
! Chuck Hanger to a minimum of
| points, will follow "Apples" wher
| ever he goes.
Other Stanford starters include
Bill Rose and George Yardley at
forwards, Bill Stephenson at center,
and Gus Chavalas at guard.
Dave Davidson and Marv Gelber
will be seeing early guard duty, and
Milt Iverson is set to go at the for
ward spot. Rugged Ralph Carver
will spell Stephenson at center.
Stantord will have to crack St.
I Mary's one-three-one zone defense
| if the Cards expect to get by the
; Gaels. Sharpshooter Bill Rose, a
j handy man to have around in such
situations, should go well against
j that type of defense.
Bill Stephenson, who scored 13
\ points against St. Mary's in last sea

son's close, 48 to 47, Stanford win.
will also be ready to operate at full
efficiency. Steve hasn't been taking
his shots lately, but when the going
is tough, he'll be right in there.
Santa Clara Easier
i Tomorrow night Stanford figure?
! to have an easier time with the gieer.
Santa Clara Broncos. Having lost
Frank Laney. the Broncos have
i nothing but a bunch of boys with the
i old college try.

Stanford's fast-moving Indian cagers will run into Frank "Ap
ples" Kudelka and his St. Mary's Gaels tonight at 7:45 p.m.
when the Gaels and the Cards get together to mix it up in the
curtain raiser of the Cow Palace basketball season.
California's Golden Bears will meet Santa Clara in the second

half of tonight's double header, and
Stanford will get the finale assign
ment tomorrow night against Santa
Clara. Second games start at 9:15
p.m. It's all part of the fan-pleasing
■ Cow Palace program of two games
I for the price of one.
Ten thousand students of the game

to see the Bay Area's fcest swing
| into action. Feature clash of the
, weekend will be tonight's opener, as
| Kudelka goes after the so far suc
| cessful Redshirts. Twelve thousand
i spectators were on hand last season
i when these two teams met.
Cards Gun for Fourth Win
Stanford will be gunning for its
I fourth consecutive win, but the
j Deanmen will have to go all out to
beat a veteran St. Mary's quintet.
Gael Coach Bennie Neff has
formed his entire offense around
Frank Kudelka, the fabulous Moraga
j flash who is one of the most out-
I standing individual performers to
hit the Coast since Hank Luisetti
| was going through his paces.
Last season, the saying went that
[ if you stopped Kudelka you stopped
St. Mary's. But that just isn't true
i this season. Guards Jack Rial and
Fred Bullkinkle add power to a
| well-balanced outfit.
St. Mary's First Test
It will be St. Mary's first contest
J of the year, so Stanford gains a
slight advantage there. The Cards
i have three games under ther belts.
To combat the Kudelka menace.

I fensive ace, Bob Lewis. Tall "Whip"'
j Lewis, noted for his feats of holding

Other Stanford starters include
Bill Rose and George Yardley at
forwards, Bill Stephenson at center,
and Gus Chavalas at guard.
Dave Davidson and Marv Gelber
will be seeing early guard duty, and
Milt Iverson is set to go at the for
ward spot. Rugged Ralph Carver
