promised the Irish a battle but said
j he thinks his team this year is not
i as strong as the 1947 edition, which

i Leahy's men.
Leahy and squad are due tomor
row morning and plan a workout
during the afternoon in Memorial
1 Coliseum, scene of the coming con

USC named a starting backfield
: today of Jim Powers at quarter

I halfback, and Bill Martin at full -
' back.
