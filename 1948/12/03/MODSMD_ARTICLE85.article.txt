## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Few Stanford basketball players will have much time at home
during Christmas vacation this year as the Farm cagers lace a
schedule that calls for basketball games three days before and
two days after the holiday.
After the Tuesday meeting with the College of the Pacific at
Stanford, the team will play Michi-4-

gan and Yale at the Cow Palace on
Dec. 20 and 21.
In Michigan the Cards will meet
the defending champion of the Big
Nine Conference, a team that com
piled a record of 16 wins and six
losses last year.
Veteran Wolverine Squad
The Wolverines will enter their
fifth game of the year with a vet
eran team consisting of six of the
squad's seven top scorers of last
season.
Yale will come to the West Coast
for a two-game set with 10 of its
11 top scorers of the 1948 season.
Topping the Eli roster is Ail-Ameri
can Tony Lavelli who scored 554
points in 27 games for an average
of 20.5 points per contest.
After these two games the Stan
ford squad will disband, only to re
assemble again the day after Christ
mas to prepare for the Pacific Coast
Conference Tournament that begins
on Dec. 27 and lasts through Dec. 30.
Stanford vs. Oregon
The Cards are slated to open the
tourney against the University of
Oregon on the first day of the
double-elemination play. UCLA is
pitted against Washington State, and
California will meet Washington.
Two teams favored to win their Con
ference Division titles. Oregon State
and Southern California, will also
play on that date.
Each team will have played three
games by the end of the tournament
and the champion will have been
decided.
