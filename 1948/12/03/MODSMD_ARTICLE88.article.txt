# Card Soccer Team Ends Season Against SFC
## 
### 
Coach John Segal's soccer team
plays its last game of the season
Saturday morning when the Indians
travel to San Francisco to play San
Francisco City College. A victory
for the Indians will insure them
third place in the six-team confer
ence.
Stanford should be in its best
physical shape since early season
for Saturday's tussle. It will be the
Indians' first game since the Cali
fornia game, and should find all of
Stanford's regulars ready for the

contest except Pat McDonald. In
the first game between the two
squads the Rams scored in the last
rive minutes of play to gain a 2-2
tie with the local eleven.
The Indians' record this year
shows losses only to California and
USF. the conference's co-leaders.
On the credit side of the ledger they

have beaten San Francisco S
twice, the Cal Aggies, and the aft
mentioned tie with CCSF.
