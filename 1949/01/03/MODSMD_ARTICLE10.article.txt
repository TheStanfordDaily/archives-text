# Monteux to Lead Symphony Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
A varied program, ranging in
mood from the brilliant orchestra
tion of Berlioz to a contemporary
work by Morton Gould, will be pre
sented tomorrow night by the IUO
- San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra in the first of two concerts
this season.
The concert will begin at 8:30 p.m.
in Memorial Hall. Tickets, priced
at $3 for a single performance or
$4.80 for both concerts, are avail
able at the Peninsula Box Office,
Palo Alto and San Mateo, or by
writing, phoning, or calling in per
son at the Public Exercises office
(DAvenport 3-9411, local 208), room
55, Temporary Building B.
Pierre Monteux will conduct the
program opening with Berlioz'
"Overture to Ben veil uto Cellini,"
followed by the Brahms Symphony
No. 2 in D Major, Opus 73, "Min
strel Show" by Morton Gould, and
Huvel's "Spanish Rhapsody."
Berlioz' opera about Cellini,
swashbuckling figure of the Renais
sance, has failed to keep the stage
except for sporadic revivals, and is

: known in this country almost solely
I through the overture, composed of
! melodies from the opera proper,
' and the prelude to the second act.

Brahms' Second Symphony, per
haps the best introduction to his or
chestral music, is generally lyric
and sunny, though not without mo
ments of somberness. The sym
phony was performed for the first
time by the Vienna Philharmonic
Dec. 30. 1877, under the direction
oi Hans Richter.
"Minstrel Show," written in 1946.
embodies the flavor of the old-time
minstrel tunes and style, alternat
ing between gay and nostalgic pas
sages. There are characteristic slid
ing trombone and banjo etTects, and
in tfye middle of the piece, sand
paper, blocks, and other percussion
convey the sounds and tempo of a
soft-shoe dance.
Ravel, born and raised in the
Basque country of southern France,
was of all French composers the
one most completely devoted to
the Spanish idiom. His "Spanish
Rhapsody," a study in musical ma-
I terials of Spanish character com
: posed in 1907, is one of his most
: persuasive tributes to the land be
low the Pyrenees.

Auditorium.
