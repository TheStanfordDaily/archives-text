SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2. — With
| California's 1949 Legislature ready i
j to convene at noon tomorrow, Gov
ernor Warren has prepared an ex- !
! tensive program to submit to this
j body for approval.
The plan includes many matters j
I presented by him to previous ses
i sions during the six years of;
his state administration. Governor j
Warren faces the prospect of a
wordy session of the new Legisla
ture.
There will be seven new mem
bers of the State Senate and 19
new Assemblymen in their seats i
when the session convenes tumor- I
I row. -

Republicans Control
Although the Republicans will !
I control both houses of the Legis- 1
| lature, the numerical situation
means little because of the division
j among the major party members. J
I With one vacancy in the Assembly,
there are 45 Republican to :!4 Dem-
I ocratic Assemblymen, and 26 Re
; publicans to 14 Democrats in the
I Senate.
Governor Warren believes that
1 the No. 1 problem will be the task
of preventing a raid by the Treas
ury on the surplus set aside during
the past lush years for the long
; overdue building and expansion
program at state mental hospitals,
prisons, universities, and other in
stitutions.
Warren's Message
It is'a pretty safe guess that a !
, good part of the Governor's tries- j
sage to the opening session will be
devoted to the necessity of preserv- \
ing the surplus for the purposes for.
which most' of it has been ear
marked in the past several sessions.
