# Dr. Spiegelberg Sails for Orient
## 
### 
Remote Tibetan lamaseries high
in the Himalayas will be visited by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg during a
six-month trip to India, Siam, and
Ceylon.
The University expert on the
philosophies and religions of the
Orient sailed for China on Dec. 22
from San Francisco aboard the S.S.
President Wilson.
He is traveling under a Rocke
feller grant and will study in ma
jor Indian universities and libraries
and visit leading representatives of
Indian political and philosophical
life.
One of the most colorful features
of his itinerary will be trips in May
to some of the least explored of the
lamaseries of the unreformed Bud
dhist Red Cap sect.
These isolated monasteries and
hermit caves are perched high on
the slopes of 28,000-foot Kanchen
junga and can be reached only by
mule with the aid of hardy Tibetan
guides. Few foreigners have vis
ited them.
One of the most important of the
lamaseries is Pemiongchi, which
will be Dr. Spiegelberg's headquar
ters for a month. From there he
will make side trips to other units
of the sect, including Tassiding, one
of the oldest lamaseries in the
world.
