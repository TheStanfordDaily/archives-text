# New Mechanics Division Opened
## 
### 
Establishment of a Division of
Engineering Mechanics in the
School of Engineering "was an
nounced last week.
Tfie division will administer a
graduate program and grant Mas
ters' and Doctoral degrees in engi
neering mechanics, and will also co
ordinate sponsored research in this
field.
Previously at Stanford students
have studied engineering mechanics
in the departments of mechanical
and civil engineering.
The division will be administered
by an executive committee of fac
ulty members appointed by Dean
