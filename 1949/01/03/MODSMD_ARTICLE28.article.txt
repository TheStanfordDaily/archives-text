## Rent Gouging 
### 
With the lack of campus dormitories many students must live
in rooms in Palo Alto or on campus, for which they are forced
to pay exorbitant prices. Any appeal to the residents of Palo
Alto or those with homes on campus to lower their rents would
undoubtedly be fruitless.
One would think that at least the faculty members would
understand the plight of the students and not take advantage of
them. Most of the campus residents have kept their rents within
.reasonable bounds; however, there are a number who have
Â£>een charging all the traffic will bear.
Examples of the latter type include rooms in one home that
rent for 545 per month with only one sheet a week and sharing
the bath. Another rents for SlO5 per quarter with garage priv
ileges, but no linen, no cleaning, and no private bath.
These are only two examples of rent-gouging by landlords on
campus. Many of those in Palo Alto are even worse.
The University cannot touch the residents of Palo Alto, but
it could exert pressure in the form of a rent ceiling on campus
rooms. The land is leased to the faculty members and other
-esidents so the University can enforce any regulations it insti
tutes.
Regulations should riot be necessary on the campus; however,
ii the consciences of the rent-gouging landlords do not bother
them, then action must be taken.
