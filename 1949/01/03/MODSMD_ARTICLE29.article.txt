It is the belief of the members of the Student-Faculty Employment
Committee that knowledge and use of its functions will be of inestimable
value to you and others and campus. It is therefore our purpose to
bring to your attention the various ways in which we might be of service
to you.
The committee is composed of your students, one a member of Excom,
two at least with experience working part-time. These members are
ppointed by the ASSU president with the approval of the executive
committee. Three other members are chosen by the Dean of Students
to represent the faculty, the business office, and the employmnt office.
One of the principal functions of the committee is to act upon all
requests for solicitation on campus, and to clear such solicitors. It is
the wish of the commitlee to prevent the nuisance of unwanted solici
tation in the halls, and all solicitors should therefore be asked to show
to represent the faculty, the business 'office, and the employment office.
A second duty of this committee is to enforce a flexible code of regu
lations governing all forms of student employment, and, in particular, to
act as an impartial fact-finding and mediating body in disputes and
( isagreements between students and their employers arising over hours,
wages, and conditions of work to the end that equitable work conditions
be established and opportunities opened up for all students needing or
desiring to earn expenses.
If the official decisions of the committee are considered inadequate or
unsatisfactory, appeal may be made to the President of the University.
Naturally, it is hoped that cases of this type will be few, since it is the
purpose of the committee to consider careftilly each case on its own
merits, bearing especially in mind financial need, beneficial aspects,
ruisance considerations, and enterprise soundness.
If. therefore, we may be of help to you, please call us.
