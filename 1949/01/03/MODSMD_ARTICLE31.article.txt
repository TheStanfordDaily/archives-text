# Bemmelman's Europeans
## 
### 
THE BEST OF TIMES by Ludwig
Benit'lmans (Simon and Schuster)
For anyone who was in Europe
this summer, this book will be a
very interesting picture of the post
war Europe which they have just
seen. For anyone who intends to
go abroad the coming summer, it is
an absolute MUSI. For the arm
chair traveler, it is a wonderful ex
perience. For the prosaic biblio
phile, it is a beautiful addition to
anyone's library.
It is beautifully illustrated by the
author. There are 50 full - page
color illustrations, besides scores of
b'ack and white sketches. All of
these are Bemelmans' impressions.
He pictures a post-war Europe that
only he sees. The story is a series
of incidents, character sketches,
nostalgia, humor, and individuality.
The experiences which he recounts
are adventures which only a man
like Bemelmans might encounter.
The tone of the book is unusual.
His description of the tragedy of
Europe is told with frivolous, al
most light-hearted touch. Behind
the optimism is one sound idea
which, actually, might be termed
the main thesis of the book. It is
this: that despite the irrevocable
changes which the war brought on
Europe, a new Europe is being
formed. As he implies, Europeans
will always be the colorful, whim
sical people that they were in the
good old days. Only the background
has been changed. The point
that the Europe that the tourist
went to see, the palaces and
churches, the statues and the gal
leries, the sidewalk cafes and the
parks, will never be the same. But
the Europe of Bemelmans, the
earthy, fascinating, unpredictable
people, will never change. For this
reason, his book is mostly the sto
ries of little people that he met in
different countries.
It is the kind of a book that
everyone likes. The unfortunate
thing about reviewing it is that it
is actually difficult to describe well.
