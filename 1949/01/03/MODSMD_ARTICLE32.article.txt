Stanford Law School practicing
alumni are lending a helping hand
to the young lawyers now gradu
ating from their Alma Mater.
Inaugurated by the Stanford Law
Society, a comprehensive place
ment program has been set up to
find suitable positions for graduates
of the Law School and those taking
the? State Bar Examinations.
Law School Dean Carl B. Spaeth
praised the plan as a necessary one
in these days when large numbers
of young lawyers, most of them war
veterans and many of them with
families, are entering professional
or business life from law schools all
over the country.
The field work is being directed
by two units of the Stanford Law
Society.
Frederick H. Hawkins, 225 Bush
Street, San Francisco, has been ap
pointed chairman of the placement
committee of the Stanford Law So
ciety of Northern California and
Nevada. J. E. Simpson, 842 Hitle
Insurance Bldg., Los Angeles 13. is
chairman of the Stanford Law So
ciety of Southern California's place
ment committee.
The placement office, now estab
lished at Stanford Law School un
der the direction of Professor James
E. Brenner, has already compiled
comprehensive information on all
candidates available for positions in
private practice, legal departments
of corporations, and state and fed
eral or district attorneys' offices.
Employers seeking personnel with
legal training can now address their
immediate and future requests to
these three offices, or to any mem
ber of the committee where quali
fied and experienced applicants are
registered and have filed their com
plete dossiers.
