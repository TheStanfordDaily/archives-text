# Unions Build Machines To Increase Political Power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2,-Organ
ized labor is building the national
Tammany Hall of the near future.
Such a statement probably over
simplifies what the AFL, the CIO.
and major independent unions are
doing, and plan, to make labor un
ionism the greatest political force in
the country. Also, it does an in
justice to the unions, if you are one
of those who think first of Tam
many's graft and corruption, and
forget the streamlined vote-getting
machinery that gave Tammany the
power, in its heyday, to graft and
corrupt.
What the unions are doing is cre
ating, on a nationwide scale, a ma
chine that will go after votes by the
same methods that Tammany's Boss
Murphy, Chicago's Kelly-Nash, Jer
sey City's Hague, Pennsylvania's
Penrose, used to elect whomever
they favored, crush whomever they
disliked or feared.
Technically those methods are
reactionary. They go back to the
old - fashioned ward - heeling me
chanics. They require activity 365
days of every year, instead of a long
sleep followed by a few weeks of
noisy pamphleteering and speech
making and star - studded radio
shows. They involve helping the
unemployed get jobs, putting food
on the tables of the impoverished,
providing advice for the bewildered
and a lawyer for the chap who runs
afoul of the law.
Day after day, week after week,
month after month, the old - time
machine taught voters to consider
the Boss as their friend, their ad
viser, their free agent,
their hard-time banker. Then, when
election time came, the Boss's heel
ers reminded the voter to get reg
istered, shepherded him to the polls,
and happily waited for the returns.
This is exactly what, on a nation
al scale, the CIO. the AFL, and at
least some of the big independents
are planning now to do, in order
lo beat thoseho vote in the Hist
Congress lor keeping the Taft-

Hartley Law, to re-elect those who
go along with labor's program, to
j force the major parties to choose
: candidates acceptable to the unions.
All three groups now are en
gaged in polishing up the machin
. ery they used so successfully last
i fall, strengthening weak spots, put
i ting the whole business on a per
| manent basis.
"The emphasis," says an AFL po
; litico, "is on precinct organizations
1 manned by flesh and blood trades
; unionists. We want a political stew
; ard in every precinct, whose job il
will be to get our members, their
families and friends to the polls.
"We have a big job coming up in
1950 because there is no Presiden
j t.ial election to dramatize the situa
-1 tion. It is in these 'off years' that
we have taken our beatings in the
past—as in 1946. But by 1950 we
I expect to have an organization that
will make labor a major force in
| politics."
Agreeing with this, a CIO spokes
! man goes on: "We start with a big
| advantage over the o'd-line politi
j cal machines. They had to keep go
l ing, between elections, on patron
age. But we already have a nation
j wide going concern, tied together
| with economic self - interest, in
I which the unions maintain daily
[ contact with every member, who in
j turn has daily contact with his fam-
I ily and friends.
"We (the CIO Political Action
Committee) took a bad beating in
j 1946 because we were disorganized
and had been largely asleep since
j 1944, and we never had tried to
: campaign without Franklin Roose
velt as a symbol. We learned a lot
j from that beating.
j "So we worked up the precinct
ward organization we used in 1948.
! We had discovered that we couldn't
' win with reprints, speeches, bally
hoo— that we had to ring doorbells,
J make sure our members were
j ready, get them to the polls. We
j did that. We're so pleased with the
j results that from now on wf'll build
j along those lines lor the future."
