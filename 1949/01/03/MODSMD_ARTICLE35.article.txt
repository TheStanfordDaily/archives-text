## Lover's Last Leap 
### 
It wouldn't surprise me if we should read about a proclamation setting
up a couple more weeks in every year. The way things stand there just
aren't enough to go around.
There have been proclaimed Soil Conservation week. Restaurant week,
White Can week, Sourdough week, State Pioneer week, and National
Cat week. There have been proclaimed all the usual days and weeks
like Army and Navy days, Marine Corps day, Be Kind to Animals week.
Mother's and Father's days, I Am an American day.and Newspaper week.
And there have been proclaimed, in addition, Share Your Clothes with
Russians week (before the present crisis), Fight Inflation week. Magical
week, Christmas Ship week, and Iloney for Breakfast week.
In fact, there are so many "'weeks" scheduled that many of them are
having to double up.
Finally, the Cedar Chest Manufacturers of America, who make hope
chests, declared a "National Fall in Love" week .... which is more
like it.
In case you are one of those people who can't keep track of leap year,
here's a handy rule to remember it by:
Every year is a leap year which is divisible by four without a re
mainder, except the concluding years of centuries, every fourth one of
which is a leap year, or those exactly divisible by 400. Is that all clear
now?
But where did Leap Year originate? Legend has it that it was a
brainchild of old Saint Patrick himself. One day as he was wandering
aiong the shores of Lough Neagh, he was stopped by St. Bridget, who
with many tears informed him that the ladies in "her nunnery were
lamenting over the fact that they were denied the, privilege of pro
posing marriage.
Now St. Pat was a sternly single man himself, but he was so moved
by her tears that he offered to give the ladies the privilege of popping
said question one year of each seven. But at this St. Bridget, womanlike
in argument, threw her arms around the neck of St. Patrick and exclaimed,
1 dare not go back to the girls with such a proposalâ€”make it one
year out of four."
To this St. Patrick replied, 'Sirrah, squeeze me a squoze like that
again and I'll Rive you leap year, the longest of the lot."
So Bridget, thus encouraged, popped the fatal question to Patrick
himself. But I repeat that Patrick was a sternly single man himself.
So he had to patch up the difficulty with a silk gown and a kiss. And
cvei since then, goes the legend, il a man refuses a leap year proposal
he must pay the penalty of a silk gown and a kiss.
Therein lies a fine idea for some smart business man to make hi
pile and retire . . . selling perfume for intelligent men- like "Shoo."
"Aloof." or maybe "Scat!" Though perhaps they won't need it. The v.. '
boom seems definitely to be over. Marriage records of 14 major cili<
oi the U.S. showed that the number of licenses issued in January \\
much as 20 per cent under last year.
Perhaps it is because most girls are completely ignorant of how h
propose properly. They are generally too bold or carefree about the
whole matter, consensus says. Personally' I think it would be a nice
old fashioned touch if the gal would kneel as she pours out her lie. rl.
But if any come after me I'm going to tell them to get my father's ) i
niission first. He's not so shy about finding out if she can support i
in thi. manner to which 1 would like to become accustomed.
