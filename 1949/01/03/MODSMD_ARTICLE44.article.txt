# Bear Cagers Edge Indians To Cop Tournament Crowr
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's high-scoring cagers stretched their winning strea
to 10 in a row during vacation before losing to an inspired an
underrated California team, 56 to 54, in the finals of the Pacif
Coast Conference Tournament at the Cow Palace. The Indiai
had reached the finals by disposing of Oregon (70-G2) and UCL
(55-47) while the Bears had routed

Washington (73-iD) and squeezed
by USC (43-42).
The championship game was a
"natural," and 8.000 fans turned out
last Thursday to see the two
ancient rivals fight it out. The game
was close all the way. the Indians
holding a slim 29 to 28 lad at half
time. The Bears, led by their aee
forward, Mike O'Neil, were con
necting on their long shots while
the Cards were missing a lot of
lay-ins.
Yardley faces Tribe
It was big George Yardley who
kept the Indians in the game with
his tip-in shots and backboard con
trol. With the score tied at 53 all
and 50 seconds remaining to play,
O'Neil sank a free throw to put the
Bears ahead. The Indians rushed
down the court, but a hook shot by
Stephenson barely missed. Cal
cleared the ball out and sent Reu
bel in for a set-up which iced the
game.

victory over Michigan climaxed a
determined second-half rally by
the Cards. The hard-driving Wol
verines jumped into on early lead
which they maintained until Ihc
final minutes of the contest. Dave
Davidson kept the Indians within
striking distance as he potted the
ball from all angles. Before the
game had ended he had tallied 23
points.
With two minutes remaining Ste

on it was a- wild scramble with the
Indians holding the lead on shots
by Iversen and Stephenson.
Scoring Record Broken
The Cards had an easier time ol
it with Yale thanks to the expert
guarding of Bob Lewis, who held
the great Tony Lavelli to a paltry
eight points. The previous night
Lavelli had scored 28 points against
St. Mary's to break a Cow Palacc
record. The Indians ran wild
against Yale in the second half and
Coach Everett Dean gave every man
on the bench a chance to play.

Stanford's 78 points broke 1
Cow Palace team scoring record
74 which was set by Arkansas 1
year.

Scoring Record Broken
The Cards had an easier time ol
it with Yale thanks to the expert
guarding of Bob Lewis, who held
the great Tony Lavelli to a paltry
eight points. The previous night
Lavelli had scored 28 points against
St. Mary's to break a Cow Palacc
record. The Indians ran wild

Stanford's high-scoring cagers stretched their winning strea
to 10 in a row during vacation before losing to an inspired an
underrated California team, 56 to 54, in the finals of the Pacif
Coast Conference Tournament at the Cow Palace. The Indiai
had reached the finals by disposing of Oregon (70-G2) and UCL
(55-47) while the Bears had routed

Washington (73-iD) and squeezed
by USC (43-42).
The championship game was a
"natural," and 8.000 fans turned out
last Thursday to see the two
ancient rivals fight it out. The game
was close all the way. the Indians
holding a slim 29 to 28 lad at half
time. The Bears, led by their aee
forward, Mike O'Neil, were con
necting on their long shots while
the Cards were missing a lot of
lay-ins.
Yardley faces Tribe
It was big George Yardley who
kept the Indians in the game with
his tip-in shots and backboard con

and 50 seconds remaining to play,
O'Neil sank a free throw to put the
Bears ahead. The Indians rushed
down the court, but a hook shot by
