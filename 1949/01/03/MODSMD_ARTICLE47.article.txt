## Thru Breier's Pipe

nee upon a time there was a reporter who wrote
Stanford would go to the Rose Bowl in 1949.
t repoiter has just returned from watching North
tern take a 20 to 14 thriller from California. It
e us wish that, for the sake of the PCC, Stanford
been the Pacific Coast champion.
e are sure that March ie Schwartz would have
;d for a short pass or two when the Wildcats
w an eight-man line at the Cards. Mr. Waldorf
't. His chuckers continued to throw them long
i though the Northwestern linebackers were play
the gaps between their own linemen.
lis guy Saikision is pretty all right as a linebacker,
plugged the holes well but we will bet a penny
he got radio credit for a lot of tackles made by
nen. He piled on every tackle.
can be noted in the picture above that Mura
ski did fumble the ball before he crossed the
line, not afterwards as the officials ruled. In all
'sty we must say that we did not know what hap
•d on the play. The officials had a short confab
re the referee raised his arms to indicate a touch
n had been scored. The Bears argued long and
but that didn't change the decision. It seems
that they were right.
; a Stanford man we took a less bitter view of
officials' error. It was not so long ago that an offi
made a somewhat similar ruling that the movies
• showed to be wrong. But that didn't change
score—California 7, Stanford 6.
irthwestern played Cal ior a first down end run,
id down line buck, third down pass (long, very
), and fourth down kick. And California stuck
y close to that schedule; or so it seemed to us.

The Wildcats respected the running of Jensen and
Swaner and played a tight line with the linebackers
as added guards and the halfbacks up close. A couple
of short passes would have caused the men from
the Midwest to change that defense but the Bears
ignored the quick pass play as they would a poor
relative and didn't even use it once.
The game opened our eyes an one count, though.
That is, that there is a lot more talent on the Bear
roster than we had known about. A fellow by the
name of Frank Brunk went a long way toward filling 1
the shoes of Jack Jensen. Brunk didn't even rate a
picture in the deluxe 100-page (one dollar) program, j
But when the Golden Boy was injured it was this
Brunk who saved the day, for a while anyway. He !
carried the ball on what had become known as "Jen
sen plays" and made yardage when it was most
needed.
Brunk wasn't the only star substitute. A couole
of ends, Pressley and Souza, went over big as did
some lesser lights.

Tine start of the new year is a time for review of
the old year and predictions for t.he new. Expect no ;
predictions from this department but let us beg to
suggest that Stanford could well win the PCC bas
ketball title (something we predicted last May).
While in the suggesting mood, let us go on record
as expecting a very close run for the Southern Divi- 1
sion crown. The winner may not be decided until the :
last Stanford-California game. One of these teams
should cop the crown, but don't overlook USC. That :
leaves only UCLA. It behooves us to put in a good '
word for the Bruins and thus be on the safe side
should they win.
