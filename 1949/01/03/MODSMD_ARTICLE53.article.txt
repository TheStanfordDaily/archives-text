# Veterans to Notify VA About New Dependents
## 
### 
Veteran students who acquire
dependents or additional depend
ents while in training under the GI
Bill should notify the Veterans Ad
ministration as soon as possible, so
that VA can determine whether
they are eligible for increased sub
sistence payments.
Notice of change in dependency
status should be sent to the VA
regional office in which the veter
an's records are kept.
