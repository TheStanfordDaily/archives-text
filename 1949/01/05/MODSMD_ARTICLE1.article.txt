# Open Houses Herald '49 Rushing Season
## 
### 
Twenty-three fraternities will officially welcome the class of
'52 with open houses scheduled for tonight and tomorrow night
from 7 to 10. Legal rushing will begin Friday at 6 p.m.
These open houses are for the convenience of both fraternity
men and freshmen, said Interfaternity President Ted Levino. Fra-

ternities may see the freshmen as"
a group and freshmen will have a
chance to become acquainted with
any and all of the fraternities in j
which there will be approximately I
300 openings.
Tonight's "uniform of the day" I
ior both Rowmen and visiting
lreshmen will be sport-coats, j
slacks, and ties.
"Fraternities are still bound to j
the existing rushing restrictions
and penalties until open rushing
begins Friday night." Levino added.
''For the two-week rushing period,
ending on Jan. 21, freshmen may
visit Row houses upon invitation
and fraternity men may legally
scout Encina."
Qualifications for potential
rushees are one quarter's residence |
at the University and an academic
average of more than minus ten.
An interi'raternity rule adopted
last year, however, states that no
pledge who is minus may move into i
a house unless that house has a j
scholastic average better than the
all-University average.
"Stanford has always had a de- ]
fcrred rushing systemâ€”setting an i
organized rushing schedule in win- i
ter quarter," Levino said. This sys
tem is followed by about 50 per i
cent of the universities. We \ise the <

non-deferred system so that fresh
men will have a chance to become
academically acclimatized to college
work and at the same time know
their own class members."
Comparing living expenses on the
Row with University dormitories, it
was found that fraternities cost
members about $35 more per quar
ter. Average expenses for frater
nities are $77, which includes room,
board, house improvement, and
parties. Initial fraternity fees aver
age $72 for pin, local and national
dues.

the location of all fraternity
houses.
