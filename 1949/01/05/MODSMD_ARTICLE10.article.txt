# Monteux Concert Brings Praise
## 
### 
Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra re
turned to a capacity audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
The program, the first in the winter
quarter concert series, featured the
Second Symphony of Brahms, Mor
ton Gould's "Minstrel Show," and
Ravel's "Spanish Rhapsody."
Opening with a brilliant perform
ance of the Overture to "Benvenuto
Cellini" by Berlioz, Monteux then
proceeded to give a virtual disser
tation on the Brahmsian style. The
Second Symphony is perhaps
Brahms' most lyrical orchestral
work. It is full of gracious melo
dies which, under the hands of a
less exacting musician than Mon
teux, can often get out of hand.
Last night's performance was
carefully controlled and the dynam
ics painstakingly balanced, yet the
free flow of the melodies was un
impaired. Particularly outstanding

was the velvet texture of the strings, j
which were never allowed to fall
into the lush quality which seems to
rage about many of our American
orchestras today.
Unfortunately the wind playing,
especially the solo oboe in the third
movement, left much to be-desired.
The oboeist had great difficulty in
controlling the tone and many times
the pitch of his instrument.
The last half of the concert was
devoted to the works of Ravel and
his orchestral disciple Morton
Gould. Gould's "Minstrel Show"
brought forth nothing particularly
new or interesting from the com
poser's pen. He used once again
the many orchestral '"tricks'" that
have appeared in his other compo
sitions. The orchestration was sim
ilar to the style developed by Ravel
but there the resemblance ended.
Gould cannot realize that, without !

j anything to say. all the orchestral
cliches ever invented cannot make
a good composition.
Monteux evidently realized it,
though, and pointed it out with a
very idiomatic performance of Pa
vel's "Spanish Rhapsody." There,
the composer had something to say;
he used many orchestral devices
with success where Gould, using
the same devices, had failed to pro
duce a convincing effect. Monteux's
reading of Ravel's work preserved
the air of mystery which is easily
destroyed by too literal an inter
pretation.
Pierre Monteux is not a "wow"
conductor. He is a thorough mu
sician and is occupied solely in pro
ducing beautiful music. The con
cert last night was amrle proof that
he deserves well the hi«h position
he holds in the musical world.—

though, and pointed it out with a
very idiomatic performance of Pa
vel's "Spanish Rhapsody." There,
the composer had something to say;
he used many orchestral devices
with success where Gould, using
the same devices, had failed to pro
duce a convincing effect. Monteux's
reading of Ravel's work preserved
the air of mystery which is easily
destroyed by too literal an inter
pretation.
Pierre Monteux is not a "wow"
conductor. He is a thorough mu
sician and is occupied solely in pro
ducing beautiful music. The con
cert last night was amrle proof that
he deserves well the hi«h position
he holds in the musical world.—

Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra re
turned to a capacity audience in
Memorial Auditorium last night.
The program, the first in the winter
quarter concert series, featured the
Second Symphony of Brahms, Mor
ton Gould's "Minstrel Show," and
Ravel's "Spanish Rhapsody."
Opening with a brilliant perform
ance of the Overture to "Benvenuto
Cellini" by Berlioz, Monteux then
proceeded to give a virtual disser
tation on the Brahmsian style. The
Second Symphony is perhaps
Brahms' most lyrical orchestral
work. It is full of gracious melo
dies which, under the hands of a
less exacting musician than Mon
teux, can often get out of hand.
Last night's performance was
carefully controlled and the dynam
ics painstakingly balanced, yet the
free flow of the melodies was un
impaired. Particularly outstanding

was the velvet texture of the strings, j
which were never allowed to fall
into the lush quality which seems to
rage about many of our American
orchestras today.
Unfortunately the wind playing,
especially the solo oboe in the third
movement, left much to be-desired.
The oboeist had great difficulty in
controlling the tone and many times
the pitch of his instrument.
The last half of the concert was
devoted to the works of Ravel and
his orchestral disciple Morton
Gould. Gould's "Minstrel Show"
brought forth nothing particularly
new or interesting from the com
poser's pen. He used once again
the many orchestral '"tricks'" that
have appeared in his other compo
sitions. The orchestration was sim
ilar to the style developed by Ravel
but there the resemblance ended.
Gould cannot realize that, without !

j anything to say. all the orchestral
cliches ever invented cannot make
a good composition.
Monteux evidently realized it,
though, and pointed it out with a
very idiomatic performance of Pa
vel's "Spanish Rhapsody." There,

with success where Gould, using
the same devices, had failed to pro
