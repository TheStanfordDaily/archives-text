# Weather Delays Return to Farm
## Bitter Cold Snap Threatens Autos 
### 
For the second year in a row
adverse weather conditions hin
dered students returning tc
Stanford from all parts of the
state and the country. Many
students, snowbound in the Mid
west, will not reach the Bay Are?
until Friday or Saturday.
Students traveling from the
Northwest this week fought, icy
highways from Seattle through
Portland to Redding, Calif. South
land students were re-routed over
the Coast Highway because a bliz
zard had closed the Ridge Routt
Sunday and Monday.
On campus, meanwhile, car
ownei-s were draining their radia-.
tors or putting in anti-freeze last
night in preparation for 16- to 25-
degree weather this morning in the
Stanford area.
A 12-inch depth of water cover
ing half of the lakebed of Lakt
Lagunita had three-quarters of ar
inch oi ice yesterday morning. A
Boathouse resident leported thai
birds were crashing into the ice
during the early morning hours in
stead of landing on the softer water,.
Elsewhere in Californis sta*>
residents faced one of the
winter periods in Weather
History. In Los Angeles, tii
ciated Press said, the ofrlciE
ing was 27.9 degrees, lowes' ne
72 years Weather Bureau >rcLs
.. e been kept. One
had 400 calls asking what to dc
about frozen pipes.
Cities with familiar names had
temperatures with a completely un
familiar ring: 22 in North Holly
wood, 20 in Santa Barbara, 22 in
Palm Springs, 23 in Pasadena. But
at Big Bear Valley, 6.500-foot-high
winter resort, it was 11 below zero.
No accurate estimates on citrus
losses can be expected for 10 days
to two weeks, packing houses said.
It takes that long for the fruit to>
show permanent damage. Heavy
loss is expected, however, especially
where no orchard heaters are being
used.
Last night the Weather Bureau
said there was no relief in sight
from the biting cold.
The national weather scene was
no better. Thousands of train pas
sengers were marooned by a raging
mid-continent blizzard j'esterday
after rampaging winter raked the
South with tornadoes that killed 59
and injured more than 300.
