## Bookstore Rush 
### 
Registration day procedure has been so simplified at Stanford
in the last year that students now criticize another phase of regis
tration week activityâ€”the Bookstore rush.
Ever since Stanford's population doubled after the war, the
small size of the Bookstore has hindered smooth sales of texts
and supplies. Of the several improvement alternatives sug
gested, few are possible. More salesclerks cannot be em
ployed without congesting the area behind the counters. Build
ing a larger store is not practical as long as more essential con
struction is needed elsewhere on campus. The store manager
said interior construction of the building is not advantageous to
the formation of books and supplies lines.
A few student suggestions have been made concerning the
Bookstore rush. If students entered the store in alphabetical
order, one man said, the crowd could be kept under control.
Another suggestion would have students majoring in the
iiumanities and sciences division buying their books during one
period of time. All the rest of the students would purchase their
books at another hour the same day.
As the Bookstore situation now exists, nearly any system
would be an improvement. But one plan must be developed
that can be adjusted to the undersized store and that will be
iair to all students.
