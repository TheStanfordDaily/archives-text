# GEORGE VELLIOTES
## Bull Session 
### 
Coming back to school this time was like driving off of a 300-mile-long j
Eose Bowl parking lot. Bumper to bumper was the theme for thousands
of happy Cal rooters returning to classes and for thousands of Stanford 1
students. Highway 101 was a glorified University Avenue .... without j
the palm trees.
One student from the Farm, with a long memory of "almosts" against
Berkeley, a lad with a revengeful attitude, after listening to the Rose
Bewl game, covered his car with red and white streamers of crepe paper j
and jauntily honked his horn as he passed hundreds of blue- and gold- '
covered cars returning north.
There was so much traffic on that 101 Coast Route that it often was ;
.sheer madness to attempt to But one returning Stanford student
picked up a hitchhiking sailor outside of Paso Robles. Our fellow student i
body card holder found that his passenger used to be a midget race car I
driver in civilian life. Later, becoming sleepy, the Stanfordite gave up
the wheel to the sailor. When he opened his eyes, the sailor was zooming
and caroming at the sedate pace of 90 miles an hourâ€”around hills, over
dale, through traffic.
Having read Mr. Ernest Poletti's new book on debate procedures, ;
Streamlined Speech, City Multigraphing Company, 690 Market Street, j
San Francisco 4, California ($2.57), our hero finally was able to persuade
the sailor to stop and return the wheel. That is why, maybe, there are I
8.200 students here today instead of 8.199.
To the Editor:
Out of G.OOO letters containing Christmas Seals mailed to Stanford stu
dents by the Santa Clara County Tuberculosis Association, 1,928 were
heard from with a return of $1,376.35 by Dec. 3. This represents 15
selling days.
Hooray and congratulations.
