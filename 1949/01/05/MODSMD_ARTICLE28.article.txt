# Warren Asks For Health Insurance
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3 (/P).—The
"Forty-Niner Session" of Califor
nia's Legislature met today—a hun
dred years after the world-wide
gold rush to the nearby Sierra.
Before adjournment — maybe not
for six months—the 40 Senators and
79 Assemblymen will have proc
essed thousands of bills to prepare
the Golden State for what Governor
Warren called "a second century of
progress."
The executive addressed a joint
sitting of the houses after they re
elected their presiding officers and
organized for the long, difficult job
lying ahead.
Senator Harold J. (Butch) Pow
ers, Eagleville, was voted another
term as upper house president pro
tern, and Assemblyman Sam L. Col
lins, Fullerton, a former U.S. Con
gressman, succeeded himself as
lower house speaker. Both are Re
publicans.
California must continue the
work of its Commission on Organ
ized Crime, recommended Warren,
to avoid "a complete surrender to
the underworld."
He also hinted of the necessity for
higher taxes, asked for adequate
financing for the increased old age
and blind pensions voted in Propo
sition No. 4, and for the third time
urged a health program to aid all
families with expenses of serious
illnesses.
Time after time, too. Warren
spoke against going into the state's
money reserves to meet the in
creased costs of government and
services.
Of crime he said:
"The developments to date in
dicate clearly the necessity for a
continued study of underworld
conditions. The fact that there is
in our state an underworld which
is reaching out and seeking to or
ganize crime on a commercial
basis must be apparent to all who
read the news of the day."
In speaking of Proposition 4 he
asked:
"Take into consideration not only
all of the revenue resources of the
state, but also all of its needs and
obligations, and take such steps as
may be necessary to raise additional
funds as may be required."
Warren insisted, in speaking of
health insurance:
"It can he done without social
ization of either our physicians or
our hospitals—a system to which
I have always been opposed."
He also said:
'This should be and can be done
without interfering with the tradi
tional freedom of choice between
patient, hospital, and doctor —a
freedom which I have always
wanted to see preserved."
Of past tries the Governor re
called:
"In 1945 and 1947 I recommended
such a system, but the bills were
never permitted to reach the floor
for debate—this in face of the fact
that it was recommended by a spe
cial interim committee of the Sen
ate."
Of his program's need he said:
"We have not yet come to grips
with the fundamental problem of
bringing good medical care within
the financial means of the average
family. We have developed high
standards of medical service and
facilities in our state, but they have
become so costly as to be beyond
the means of a large percentage of
our people."
Warren asked for other social
'egislation to provide liberalization
of the disability insurance program
to give greater benefits to work
men during illnesses, more financial
security for widows left with small
children, and reactivation of the
Redevelopment Agency to gener
ally advance better housing condi
tions.

continued study of underworld
conditions. The fact that there is
in our state an underworld which
is reaching out and seeking to or
ganize crime on a commercial
basis must be apparent to all who
read the news of the day."
In speaking of Proposition 4 he
asked:
"Take into consideration not only
all of the revenue resources of the
state, but also all of its needs and
obligations, and take such steps as
may be necessary to raise additional
funds as may be required."
Warren insisted, in speaking of
health insurance:
"It can he done without social
ization of either our physicians or
our hospitals—a system to which
I have always been opposed."
He also said:
'This should be and can be done
without interfering with the tradi
tional freedom of choice between
patient, hospital, and doctor —a
freedom which I have always
wanted to see preserved."
Of past tries the Governor re
called:
"In 1945 and 1947 I recommended
such a system, but the bills were
never permitted to reach the floor
for debate—this in face of the fact
that it was recommended by a spe
cial interim committee of the Sen
ate."
Of his program's need he said:
"We have not yet come to grips
with the fundamental problem of
bringing good medical care within
the financial means of the average
family. We have developed high
standards of medical service and
facilities in our state, but they have
become so costly as to be beyond
the means of a large percentage of
our people."
Warren asked for other social
'egislation to provide liberalization
of the disability insurance program
to give greater benefits to work
men during illnesses, more financial
security for widows left with small
children, and reactivation of the
Redevelopment Agency to gener
ally advance better housing condi
tions.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3 (/P).—The
"Forty-Niner Session" of Califor
nia's Legislature met today—a hun
dred years after the world-wide
gold rush to the nearby Sierra.
Before adjournment — maybe not
for six months—the 40 Senators and
79 Assemblymen will have proc
essed thousands of bills to prepare
the Golden State for what Governor
Warren called "a second century of
progress."
The executive addressed a joint
sitting of the houses after they re
elected their presiding officers and
organized for the long, difficult job
lying ahead.
Senator Harold J. (Butch) Pow
ers, Eagleville, was voted another
term as upper house president pro
tern, and Assemblyman Sam L. Col
lins, Fullerton, a former U.S. Con
gressman, succeeded himself as
lower house speaker. Both are Re
publicans.
California must continue the
work of its Commission on Organ
ized Crime, recommended Warren,
to avoid "a complete surrender to
the underworld."
He also hinted of the necessity for
higher taxes, asked for adequate
financing for the increased old age
and blind pensions voted in Propo
sition No. 4, and for the third time
urged a health program to aid all
families with expenses of serious
illnesses.
Time after time, too. Warren
spoke against going into the state's
money reserves to meet the in
creased costs of government and
services.
Of crime he said:
"The developments to date in
dicate clearly the necessity for a
continued study of underworld
conditions. The fact that there is
in our state an underworld which
is reaching out and seeking to or
ganize crime on a commercial
