## The 						Foot Bowl Picture 
### 
Everyone wants into the act. Last
year thexe were only 45 active foot
bowl games in the US and foreign
picture.
This year add the Asparagus, Ice,
Potato, Apple, Reprieve, Salt, Ca
mellia Western Santa Claus, Egg,
Gold Dust, Evergreen, and an Or
ange Blossom and we now have a
directory of 57 annual bowl games.
Not content with that, the Orange
Bowl played five or six bowl games
itself. (I've lost count.) For a while
there was talk of its throwing the
first double - header New Year's
bowl game even. Most of the other
games are contests involving vari
ous junior colleges and high school
elevens.
Still the granddaddy of them all
is the Rose Bowl, though, in both
attendance and gate receipts. In
1948 nine of the 11 first - choice
Associated Press All - Americans
played in the Rose Bowl. This year
there was only one first-stringer,
with two others from the second
and third teams. These three still
•amounted up to the most All-Amer
ican talent in a single bowl game
for this year, however. The Rose
a'so was the first televised bowl—
last year.
"Big 14' Bowls
Among the - Big 14" bowls—Rose,
Cotton, Sugar, Orange, Gator, Har
bor, Shrine (East-West), Delta,
Dixie, Sun, Raisin, Salad, Prairie,
and Vulcan) this year there were
only 11 All-Americans playing.
There have been so many bowl
games being played that the dates
lor many of the lesser ones have
had to be set ahead of the tradi
tional January 1 dateline. About
the first one this year was the new
Gold Dust Bow! December 11, star
ring City College of San Francisco
versus ChafTey JC.
Last year (he Raspberry Bowl in
Puyallup, Washington, became the
first to conduct a bowl game AF
TER the traditional date. They fea
tured a game between Army and
Navy vets.
California Leads
The state of California sponsors
the most bowl games of the season,
for the second year of her reign. In
'48 she conducted nine. Texas fol
lowed with six and Florida with
five. Now Cal has 12, Texas eight,
and Florida still five.
The most popular name seems to
be the Silver Bow!, for there are
two of these, situated at both Mex
ico City ad Las Vegas.
The craze has even spread over
seas. In Manila there is the Bamboo
Bowl and elsewhere in the Philip
pie Islands there is the Lily Bowl,
in both of which service personnel
and native teams compete. Japan
has its Rice Bowl at Yokohama, and
Hawaii adds two more bowls.
Who Wants to Play?
The University of Hawaii had the
toughest luck of all trying to find a
1948 opponent At last count they
had contacted 16 schools for their
Pineapple Bowl. They ended up
with Redlands. In their second bow!
appearance last year they played
Fresno in their Aloha Bowl.
Fresno was another of the teams
that played two bowls in the same
season. Their second appearance
was in the Olive Bowl in Lidsey.
But they don't hold the record for
most bowls played in a single sea
son. That honor - belongs to Hardin-
Simmons, which this year appeared
in three bowls—over the University
oT Wichita 49-12 in the first Camel
lia Bowl at Lafayette, La.; tying
College of the Pacific 35-a!l i Lodi's
Grape Bowl; over Ouachita College
40-12 in the Shrine Bowl at Little
Rock, Ark.
This Shrine makes a doublet of
that name to compete with the Sil
ver Bowls, but the technicality of
the other Shrine bowl not in actu
ality being a bowl game but instead
the East-West game, gives the legal

title still to the Silver Bowls afore
mentioned.
One of the oddest stories to come
out of the'year's bowl cluster comes
from the University of Utah. It
seems that 13 married members of
the team voted against the New
Year's game and the school officials
refused to send a divided team.
They were to play William and
Mary in the Delta Bowl. It seems
that school officials had accepted
the bid before asking the players.
It reminds us of another pre-elec
tion polling which recently forgot
to poll the voters.
A lot of the bowls are presented
by host schools with the host play
ing in t+ie bowl each year Such a
one is Toledo (Glass Bowl) which
has won all of its four games in the
four years of its existence.
Prison All-Stars
There are a lot of firsts being
posted this year, to add to an al
ready impressive list of ingenuity
of last year. In '48 the Stone Bowl
was originated at Walla Walla Penn
(this Penn is usually spelled with
one "n") between the intramural
champs and the prison all-stars.
On Dec. 14 of the same year the
first and only all-Negro bowl game
was held between Wilberforce unci
Prairie View Colleges in the Frisco
Fruit Bowl. These two colleges
played each other again this year as
well. . . . The only all-pro game
was held in the Youth Bowl at
Albuquerque.
Now this year a Reprieve Bowl
has Been inaugurated. Its main
drawing point is that it is for los
ing teams. The teams with the most
impressive list of losses get the
bids. It is located in Alice, Texas,
and sponsored by that city's Amer
ican Legion
Little Kose Bowl
The junior colleges have had the
Little Rose Bowl to look forward
to for some time. Now the high
schools are starting to cash in on
the idea. In Wenatchee, Washing
ton (apple capital of the world),
their Panthers sport now annually
in the Apple Bowl. But this has
even been carried a step farther to
where Antioch. California, this year
sponsored in its first Asparagus
Bowl the only free bowl game of
the year, between Pitt and Antioch.
No player was allowed to be over I.']
years of age.
Then, the climax to end all bowl
games, the Ice Bowl in Fairbanks,
Alaska, played between the Uni
versity of Alaska and Ladd Field.
Players wore long-Johns and spe
cial masks to protect their lungs
from frostbite. Subs on the side
lines were wrapped in electric
blankets. Spectators sat in a spe
cial warming house and looked out
through the windows at the snow
covered field marked with coal dust.
Strange Ground Rules
There are a couple of rules for
this game that will not be found in
any of the other rule books: (1) No
player is allowed to play more than
five minutes at a time. The medics
fear the effects of overexertion in
the frieid air. (2) No official time
out will be charged against either
side if play is interrupted bv a bear,
moose, or caribou wandering onto
the field.
