# Car Pool Signups Open to Students
## 
### 
Students commuting from Bay
Area points are being signed up by
Alpha Phi Omega, the National
Service fraternity, in hopes that car
pools can be formed for the con
venience of the commuters.
Over 100 names were received at
the fraternity's booth in the pa
vilion registration day. Students
signing up live as far away as San
Jose to the south and Berkeley,
Oakland and San Francisco to the
north.
From these names, lists will be
compiled and made available so that
car pools may be formed if desired,
according to Jack Robinson, presi
dent of the organization.
Alpha Phi Omega began the v/ork
of organizing the commuting stu
dents at the request of Dean Law
rence Kimpton, following notice
brought to attention by Dick Albei -
ton, grad Law student, that Southern
Pacific commuter train schedules
did not correspond with class times.
Robinson said that he heard un
officially that the Southern Pacific
plans to revise their schedule later
this month to comply with the re
quests of the many Stanford stu
dents who use the train to get to
school.
Robinson added that those stu
dents who filed information with
Alberton should nevertheless fill
out an Alpha Phi Omega informa
tion card if they wished to partici
pate in a car pool.
Information cards may be ob
tained at the Information desk,
Temporary Building A-GO. Stu
dents filing the cards are under no
obligation for signing.
