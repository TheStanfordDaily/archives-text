last week may keep Cal's All-
American fullback out of football
action next fall, according to W. H.
Jensen, father of the Cal star. Jen
sen Sr., who is a policeman em
ployed by Stanford University, ex
plained that Jack did not want to
risk aggravating the injury and thus
hamper his plans for playing pro
baseball after graduation.
"Jack will definitely finish his
schooling at Cal, but his football fu
ture all cleoends on the extent of
the injury." he emphasized. "He has
already bad several good major
league offers, and we don't want
any injur es getting in the way of
his baseball career."
Jenen Sr.. who is night police
man on the Encina-Toyon-Crothers
district of the campus, has been
working for Stanford for the past
two years while his son made head
lines at Cal. but if it hadn't been for
a combination, of six missing cred
its and World War II, Jack would
also be here at Stanford, his father
disclosed.
Right after Jack came out of the
Navy in 1945 we came to Stanford
to see about enrolling here," he
said, but Jack lacked six credits
and was not able to enter. Even so,
he would have made up his credits
at a junior college and then en
tered Stanford if it hadn't been for
war - time eligibility rules. Since
freshmen could play varsity ball
that year, Jack decided to go to Cal
where he could break in immedi
ately.
About the Rose Bowl game,
Jack's father was naturally disap
pointed. "He would have made the
difference between winning and
losing if he hadn't been forced out
with that pulled tendon," he stated.
"It was a tough break for both
Jack and his team."
