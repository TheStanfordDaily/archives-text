# Rose Bowl Pact May Be Changed

PALM SPRINGS, Jan. 4 ■ (/P). —
Spokesmen for the Pasadena Tour
nament of Roses were reported to
dgy to have repeated a plea that the
Big Nine-Pacific Coast Conference
Rose Bowl pact be changed to per
mit the Midwestern champions to
appear in the bowl regardless of
previous engagements there.
The tournament's football com
mittee, headed by Lathrop Leish
man, huddled with the conference's
Rose Bowl committee at the annual
winter meeting of the coast direc
tors.
Under the present setup, no Big
Nine team can pay a return visit to
Pasadena within a span of three
years. Michigan played at Pasa
dena, for instance, in the 1948 game
but could not return this year, even
though it was again the Big Nine
champion.
The Coast Conference also was
reported ready to prohibit its teams
from appearing in any .bowl game
except the .Rose Bowl. Oregon,
which tied California for the 1948
title, was granted special permis
sion to appear in the Cotton Bowl
at Dallas. The Webfoots lost to
Southern Methodist, 21-13.
Action was also expected by
which Oregon may split up some
of the $108,912 received for its Cot
ton Bowl engagement Oregon vol
unteered to remit to the confer
ence some of the revenue down to
a figure that will match the sum
California will get for its Rose Bowl
engagement.
Estimates of the amount Califor
nia will wind up with ranged from
$75,000 to $95,000. The exact amount
will not be known until an audit is
completed.
Discussion over the Northwestern
20-14 win over California began to
fade out. But Tommy Fitzpatrick,
supervisor of football officials in
the Coast Conference, fired back at
comments made yesterday in Chi
cago by the Big Nine supervisor,
Jim Masker.
