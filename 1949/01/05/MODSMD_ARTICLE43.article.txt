The Conference Invitational Cage Tournament held last week decided
absolutely nothing except that the Cow Palace management is going to
have to make a few quick improvements if the monstrous pavilion is ever
to play host to ,the PCC fives again. Disappointing crowds and the ex
treme cold threw the ky.bosh on any hopes that the tournament would
become an annual Cow Palace affair. The tourney is gone for next season
for sure, and perhaps forever.
The coldest San-Francisco December in years transformed the heatless
Cow Palace into a huge ice box which nearly froze ball players and spec
tators alike. The' near-freezing temperatures combined with the resulting
sparse attendance to throw a chill into the hearts as well as the bodies of
the rival school athletic managers present.
Never again, several of them were quoted as saying, would they bring
their teams to freeze on the Cow Palace floor. The visiting press helped
things along by devoting more copy to how cold it was than they ditH*
to the ball games themselves. One Oakland sportwriter is even reported
to have quit his job in preference to sitting out a tournament quadruple
bill in the frigid Palace.
Low Attendance Figures All Year
Cow Palace impresario Frank Walsh and his staff have come in for a
lot of criticism because of the box office failure of the PCC Tournament,
and because of the generally low attendance figures all year. Some of
this criticism is justly put, much is not.
The Cow Palace situation is still in the experimental stage, and the
directory are doing the best job they can with what they have to work
with. The fact that ,the building has no heating plant isn't their fault.
However, it is clear that some improvements are in order if the Palace
is to survive another long cold winter.
First of all, a heating plant must be installed. People will sit through
a blizzai d to watch a football game, but basketball, it seems, is something
else again. The Cow Palace got by last season because of a relatively
mild winter. However, such cooperation from the elements cannot always
be expected. The cost of installing a blower-type furnace adequate for
warming up the huge barn will be highâ€”probably upwards of $100,000.
But if heat isn't brought into the Palace by the beginning of next season,
then Bay Area teams might just as well prepare to give the place back
to the cows and pigs.
Prices Must Go Down
Secondly, a downward revision of prices is in order. There was a
general feeling that the local promoters lost sight of their original aim
of basketball at popular prices when they set up this year's tariff schedule.
The showing at the box office proves it. Current ticket prices practically
prohibit a man from taking his wife and family to the ball games.
A new policy of all tickets unreserved except for the box seats might
prove more lucrative, and would certainly cut down on a lot of unneces
sary ushering and ticket handling expense.
With heat and lower prices there is no reason why the Cow Palacejl
shouldn't become the country's leading cage center. From the
point of the view, the Palace is almost a perfect place to watch a bas
ketball game. The seats are good, visibility excellent, and parking fam
ilies adequate.
From the players' standpoint the Palace is a bit of OK, too. The floor
is the best in these parts, and the lighting provided by General Electric
is t eputedly the best in the country. The primitive dressing room condi
tions leave much to be desired but they, too, along with the heat and
ticket conditions may improve with time.
But what is most important, Cow Palace basketball is managed by the
Bay Area schools for the benefit of the Bay Area schools. The college
advisory board, which holds an important advisory status, is made up
of one representative from each of the Bay Area schools.
Not so in Madison Square .Garden and some of the other major cgnters
where college cage squads play. Professional managers handle every t
thing in leturn tor their cut of the gate. The teams have nothing to say.
Many of the major teams will have nothing to do with the Garden for
this reason.

Through the Keyhole
Several of Chuck Taylor's freshman football players were thrown for
a loss by the professors last quarter. One flunked out altogether, while
another was transferred to the University of Washington. . . . The Ath
letic Department is organizing an intramural basketball team that
may prove tough to beat in league play. The team is coached by re
bound artist Phil Bengtson who will also man the pivot position.
Coaches Ray Hammett, Everett Dean, Bob Burnett, and Chuck Taylor
will round out the starting five. "We'll clean up the league," says
Taj loi. . . . Bob Setrakian is organizing an off-campus cage quintet
to enter in the campus intramurals. Anj r off-campus man interested
in .playing fs urged to contact Setrakian at DA 2-6583. . . . Rumors have
it that California halfback Jack Swaner, said to be definitely through
with college football after this season, will be back wearing iiis num
ber 13 jersey again next year. ,Cal's number two Jack is supposed to
have been all fixed up with a position in the business world after his
planned graduation in June, so it must have .taken quite some bit of
persuasion to get him to return.
