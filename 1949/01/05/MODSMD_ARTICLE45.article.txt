# Card Cagers to Play UCLA, USC; Team Favored to Defeat Bruins
## 
### JOHN HALL 
The Southern Division basketball
race, predicted to be a wide open
free-for-all', will get under way
Friday night as Stanford plays host
to UCLA in the Pavilion, and Cali
i'ornia meets USC at Berkeley.
Stanford's red-hot quintet, con
querors of 'Michigan and Yale, will
be slight favorites to repeat their
earlier effort to polish off UCLA, and
California's battling Bears rate an
edfee to also repeat an earlier win
over Sam Barry's Trojans. Satur
day night the men exchange part
nets.
Stanford will be gunning for its
11th win of the season, as the Cards
go' after the Bruins hoping to malfe
their first conference game a suc-
Last year, UCLA and Stan
ford split a four-game series, bring
ing the total games to 49 victories
for the Indians and 27 wins for the
Bruins.
Except for the ailing guard T. S.
Ary, who suffered a broken leg in
an accident, the squad is in good
shape. George Yardley, Card high
scorer with 138 points in 11 games,
and flashy Milt Iverson are ready
to go at the forward spots.
Captain Bill Stephenson, the
PCC's.best pivot man, will be ready
at center. Steve has scored 117

points in 11 games to rate the second
spot in team scoring. He will be
backed up by Ralph Carver.
Dave Davidson, Gus Chavalas,
Marv Gelber, and Bob Lewis are
all-aet to see plenty of guard duty
fcpver the weekend. Davidson leads
guards in point-making with 71
points.
• UCLA, coached by John Wooden
in his first year at Westwood, has
come up with a better ballelub than
pre - season dope charts figured
upon. Leading the Bruins is their
rugged forward, blond Chuck
Clustka. He is aided by six-foot
five-inch Alan Sawyer at the other
forward.
Carl Kraushaar, a six-foot five
inch transfer from Compton, has
filled in perfectly at center. Krau

shaar is not a high scorer, but is
dangerous on both backboards.
George Stanich, the high-jump
ing baseball pitcher, has been
switched from center to guard, and
he teams up with the sawed - off
Ronny Pearson to round out the
Bruin starting five.
UCLA likes to go fast. But that's
all the Bruins can do, they just run
and run. Sometimes it pays off, as
witnessed by their wins over USB,
Northwestern. St. Mary's, and
Washington State
Stanford must ston the Bruin fast
break. Then the Cards can worry
about USC on Saturday night. The
Trojans from Southern Cal employ
an entirely different type of offense.

The Southern Division basketball
race, predicted to be a wide open
free-for-all', will get under way
Friday night as Stanford plays host
to UCLA in the Pavilion, and Cali
i'ornia meets USC at Berkeley.
Stanford's red-hot quintet, con
querors of 'Michigan and Yale, will
be slight favorites to repeat their
earlier effort to polish off UCLA, and
California's battling Bears rate an
edfee to also repeat an earlier win
over Sam Barry's Trojans. Satur
day night the men exchange part
nets.
Stanford will be gunning for its
11th win of the season, as the Cards
go' after the Bruins hoping to malfe
their first conference game a suc-
Last year, UCLA and Stan
ford split a four-game series, bring
ing the total games to 49 victories
for the Indians and 27 wins for the
Bruins.
Except for the ailing guard T. S.
Ary, who suffered a broken leg in
an accident, the squad is in good
shape. George Yardley, Card high
scorer with 138 points in 11 games,
and flashy Milt Iverson are ready
to go at the forward spots.
Captain Bill Stephenson, the
PCC's.best pivot man, will be ready
at center. Steve has scored 117

points in 11 games to rate the second
spot in team scoring. He will be
backed up by Ralph Carver.
Dave Davidson, Gus Chavalas,
Marv Gelber, and Bob Lewis are
all-aet to see plenty of guard duty
fcpver the weekend. Davidson leads
guards in point-making with 71
points.
• UCLA, coached by John Wooden
in his first year at Westwood, has
come up with a better ballelub than
pre - season dope charts figured
upon. Leading the Bruins is their
rugged forward, blond Chuck
Clustka. He is aided by six-foot
five-inch Alan Sawyer at the other
forward.
Carl Kraushaar, a six-foot five
inch transfer from Compton, has
filled in perfectly at center. Krau

shaar is not a high scorer, but is
dangerous on both backboards.
George Stanich, the high-jump
ing baseball pitcher, has been
switched from center to guard, and
he teams up with the sawed - off
Ronny Pearson to round out the
Bruin starting five.
UCLA likes to go fast. But that's
all the Bruins can do, they just run
and run. Sometimes it pays off, as
witnessed by their wins over USB,
Northwestern. St. Mary's, and
Washington State
Stanford must ston the Bruin fast
break. Then the Cards can worry
about USC on Saturday night. The
Trojans from Southern Cal employ
an entirely different type of offense.
