! President Truman will tell the na
j tion about the '"state of the union"
this morning in a 30-minute address
before the new 81st Congress—and
even some Republicans seem in
clined to go along with his program,
j The President's speech, starting
! at 10 a.m. PST. will be carried over
I the four major radio networks.
Buoyed by a smashing victory in
their first test of strength on Capi
tol Hill Monday, administration of
ficials looked for no such obstacles
as blocked Mr. Truman's legisla
tive proposals in the Republican
controlled 80th Congress during the
past two years.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn
(D.-Tex.) expressed this view with
dry humor to newsmen yesterday.
The Texan, who relishes under
statement, said he thinks Mr. Tru-
J man's recommendations "will be
received by Congress with consid
erable favor."
Rayburn declined to predict what
President Truman wiil ask in his
annual message to the lawmakers.
He did indicate, however, some of
his own views on the controversial
topic of the Taft-Hartley Law.
In his election speeches last fall,
j Mr. Truman committed himself to
, repeal of the Taft-Hartley measure
! which has been so bitterly attacked
by labor leaders.
