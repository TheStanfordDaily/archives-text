YOUR TELEPHONE must take hard knocks as they
come—and go on working.
To make sure it can, we test samples of each day's pro
duction and put telephones through the equivalent of years
of service in a few hours or days. For example: we drop
handsets into their cradles 22,000 times —equal to 4 years'
normal use. And not just once, but from 16 different posi
tions, we drop sample telephones from desk-top height
onto a hardwood surface. We even check their feet to be
certain they won't scratch your table.
Here at Western Electric, we've been making Bell tele
phones since 1882, But telephones themselves are only
about 6% of the equipment used in your service. The other
94% includes-wire, cable, switchboards, trucks, poles, tools,
office equipment. With the exception of buildings, we
make or supply almost everything Bell telephone people
use—and test it with utmost care.
Guarding the quality of things used in your Bell tele
phone service is one way that Western Electric helps to
make it the world's best.
