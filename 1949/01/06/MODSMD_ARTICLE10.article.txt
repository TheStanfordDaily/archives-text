# No Rain, No Drain, No Fun For Lagunita Swim Fans
## 
### 
With a half-inch of ice around
; his legs, Little Injun remembers
j those wonderful spring afternoons
; spent loafing, canoeing, and swim
ming at Lake Lagunita, and starts
, his annual prayer for rain.
The half-million gallons of water
! in the lake at the moment is only
run-off from the local area, and
will probably evaporate very quick
ly, the Corporation Yard told Little
Iniun yesterday.
Lake Lag will not really begin to
fill up until Scarsville Reservoir
overflows. Run-off from Searsville
I enters the lake by way of Sears
j ville Creek.
j If the lake is not full by the end
I of February, there is very litt'e
: chance of its being full for spring
1 quarter, the Corporation Yard re

port stated. Rainfall is behind the
season norm, and the weather con
ditions are not too promising.
For the past two seasons, Lake
Lagunita has been closed to boating
and swimming due to insufficient
or no water. Previous to 1946, the
lake was crowded every weekend
with Farm students soaking un the
sunshine and practicing the latest
swimming strokes.
A water carnival was held every
vear, with campus groups partici
pating in swimming races, boat
races, tilting contests, and the like.
Many of the livinu groups and
organizations maintain canoes in
the boathouse behind Foble. Rnfts
nnd lifeguards, supolied by the
University, make the lake an ideal
spot for hot spring afternoons.
