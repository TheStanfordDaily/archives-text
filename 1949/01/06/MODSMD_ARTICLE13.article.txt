# New Buildings Progressing
## 
### 
Good building conditions during
(he past few months have meant
steady progress on Stern Hall, the
new rrton's dormitory south of En
cina, and work on the building is
slightly ahead of schedule as a re
sult.
Building officials said the con
crete floor slabs of three of the
five units have been laid, and the
floors of the other two units, in
cluding the kitchen section, will be
poured soon.
Aside from the pouring of con
crete, the building of forms for the
cement walls is the principal con
struction taking place. This work
is expected to continue lor some
time.
Slern Hall is scheduled to be
ready for occupation by men stu
dents next autumn.
Under the roof of the old Admin
istration Building, both destruction
and construction arc taking place.
While workmen hammer with two
air compressors to tear out walls,
others are pouring thousands of
buckets of concrete around the
steel girders that fill up the once
spacious lobby.
Three floors with mezzanines will
grace the building when completed.
The wings, which once housed the
administrative staffs of the Uni
versity, will be turned into mod
ern classrooms, lecture halls, and
offices. Completion is expected
early next year.
