# Weatherman Foresees Little Relief from Cold
## 
### JIM THURBER 
All those complaints to the weather bureau yesterday were a
waste of time—it's still getting colder and there's appaientlv no
relief in sight.
Farm students took the cold weather in their stride, but they
didn't have to like it. Frozen car radiators, frozen pipes, and cold

►classrooms were just a few of the
inconveniences that went with the
near-record, 23-degree reading yes
terday.
Near-Record Cold Snap
A graduate student, finding the
pipes in his room frozen, was
forced to go down to the Cellar to
brush his teeth.
Twenty-three isn't a record, but
it is close to it. The lowest mercury
reading ever taken on the official
i thermometer in Palo Alto here was
20. This has been reached more
than once, the last time in 1937.
But compared to the rest of the
country, Stanford had a very easy
time of it in the recent cold-spell.
A killing frost descended on South
ern California and brought losses
of over S2O million.
Smudge Pots Lit
Almost all of the 10 million
smudge pots in Southern California
have been going full blast for the
past couple of days, at an estimated
fuel oil cost of $6 million to the
growers.
At Glendora, sheriff's officers re
ported Oliver S. Powell, 53, despon
dent over the loss of his entire crop
from his 20-acre orange grove, in
haled cyanide and killed himself.
Officials disclosed yesterday that
365 students in Pomonp were ab
sent; all were engaged in smudging
for their parents or neighbors.
Blizzard Maroons Students
Elsewhere across the country, the
middle-west was hardest hit by the
weather. Thousands were ma
rooned in the wake of a three-day
snow storm. At least 10 Stanford
students wired the University that
their return was delayed due to
stalled trains, busses, and cars.
Jf you went high enough and far
enough, it was a nice time to travel.
Airlines reported coast-to-coast fly
ing had been "swell." Tuesday was
the busiest day on record at the
Los Angeles airport.
The death toll from Monday's
l-fouisiana-south Arkansas torna
does climbed back up to 56 with
another death late yesterday.
The Red Cross declared North
Platte, Neb., a disaster area as a j
devastating three-day blizzard blew I
itself out. Local dealers said food |
and fuel would be dropped by air- j
plane to towns where supplies were
dwindling.
