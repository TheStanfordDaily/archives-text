## The 						Rush Begins 
### 
Tonight freshmen will scatter over the Row for the second of
Ihe fraternity open houses. After tonight's open houses, legal
lushing will begin. The initial rush and confusion at the open
houses will probably make it difficult for the freshmen to decide
absolutely whether to join a house and which house to join. But !
when the individual bids start Friday, it will behoove him to |
think about the decision he'll have to make.
Whether to join a house or not depends on the individual. In j
support of fraternities, some of the nation's leading administrators j
and educators have stated that the fraternity is the ideal living !
unit, not only for the small living groups, but for the friendships
made and the lessons learned. In a house a man will lose some
of the rough edges. In several years of fraternity life a man will
have an opportunity to hold important offices.
Contacts made in fraternities are certainly valuable. And it is !
no secret that some people join for that reasonâ€”shallow though
it may be.
And, of course, there are people who look on a fraternity mem- j
bership as a mark of the elite, as an exclusive "society" organ
ization. It isn't so. If it ever were, the democratizing influence
of the veterans has changed it. The same percentage of frater
nity men hash and otherwise earn part of their support as in '
other living groups.
Financially, the fraternities at Stanford are no more expensive j
than dormitory living, generally, and in some cases are less ;
expensive. And the fraternity man will point out that he is getting |
a lot more leg room, better food, and more "extras" for his money, j
In choosing the particular fraternity house to live in, the prob- j
lem'is indeed a pesonal one and should not be undertaken lightly. ,
Once again, remember it's for several years, so try to get to know ;
Ihe fellows of the houses rushing you. The problem will be I
made simpler, of course, by the fact that the houses will be
selecting, too.
Don't be swayed by pre-Stanford ideas on what house to join.
That is, don't have your heart set on joining a particular house
just because your Uncle Jim or a friend of your Dad's was a
member. Likewise, don't be unduly prejudiced by famous names.
Above all, if possible, join a house mainly because you like
ihe people in it. Try to balance the rest of the factors according
io their true worth; that is, food, probable expenses, or the phys- j
:cal plant of the house.
