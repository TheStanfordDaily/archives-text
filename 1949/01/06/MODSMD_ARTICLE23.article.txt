## Bull Session 
### 
With Jack Benny and Phil Harris now regularly going through their
routine about "hunting bear" on Benny's Sunday radio show, I'm reminded
of a duck hunting trip I took over Christmas vacation.
I enjoyed myself very much, even though one of the other hunters per
sisted in giving me a "hard time." Every time the ducks would fly over.

he'd ask me if I'd like to take a "straight shot." By
the time I figured out what he really meant. I was
too drunk to aim the gun.
But we did have a lot of fun sitting out there in
the duck blind. I wanted to make a good impression
on the rich hunters in our party, so I started smoking
a quarter cigar. It was a good cigar, all right, but
I would have felt much safer if I had known who
smoked the other three-quarters.
But 1 really don't get much kick out of hunting
since Inst month when I saw the police shoot down
my poor brother. They shot him because of his riditig

habit. He had a habit of riding off in strange automobiles.
It all happened because he had joined a mob run by a dark-eyed
gi ngster named "Harry with the light brown genes." "Harry" shared
the leadership of the mob with a very skinny fellow whom the other mob
sters affectionately called "Death Warmed-over." Before he became a
gangster, "Death Warmed-over" worked in a green olive plant, crawling
through the hole in each olive with a pimiento between his teeth.
"Harry" and "Death Warmed-over" decided that with composer Frank
Loesser making so much money with "A Slow Boat to China," they would
see how they could do with a "fast boat from China." So they decided
to start smuggling human beings into the United States.
Alter spending two weeks in the Orient, getting oriented, they began
operation. They had a very clever plan for sneaking their human cargo
pust the near-sighted U.S. Customs Officers. There was absolutely no
limit to their ingenuity.
Once they took 12 persons and put a raisin in each of their ears. The
myopic customs men took one look at the raisins and decided the freight
was a dozen cookies. Another time they sprayed yellow paint on a fat
man and got him in the country as a round-shouldered pear.
But finally last week they met their downfall when a grandiose scheme
112; i!ed. After stripping three men to the waist and sneaking them in as a
>'de of bacon, the mobsters were caught as they attempted -to bring in
six fat fellows as pigs. Someone had squealed.
