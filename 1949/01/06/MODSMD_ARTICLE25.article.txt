## The 						U.S. As Seen from Europe 
### 
There is a wide difference between the unknown
i United States as seen by the European student before
| sailing, and the country that lie discovers at the
I end of his trip.
| Usually the European student leaves the old conti-

nent with a full load of apprehen
sions as to life in America. To be
sure, he does not fail in lack of
reactions for since his childhood
he has been genuinely anxious to
know more and to enlarge his
background about it. But his
ideas have been so shaped by
years of distorted information that
he is ill-prepared to meet the new
land.
The movies bear the main re-

j sponsibility. For the European children, who always
; think of the United States in terms of cowboys and
i Indians, the movies are as true as the Gospel. More
often they only influence judgment but are no less
j dangerous therefore: if few Europeans believe that
I Chicago is an all-gangster city, yet after having seen
dozens of Scarfaees, many are inclined to think that
there is some truth in the background and that Chi
cago is not too safe a place.
Cultured, intellectual people may of course ovcr-
I come such childish, primary reactions, but they are
j not immune from being trapped into other pitfalls; for
i instance, American literature. Reading Sinclair Lewis,
I Steinbeck, Dos Passos, and Hemingway, the European
j intellectual soon arrives to the conclusion that the
i United States has carried mechanization to the point
i of standardizing the minds of millions of people. Un
! fortunately the European reader is unable to check
| to what extent the author's standpoint is justified,
j therefore he has to accept those ideas as a whole, true
i picture of America, whereas at best they only repre
j sent one aspect of life in this country.
j By sending millions of Gls overseas, World War II
! also has shaped a questionable picture of the Ameri-
I cans. The Europeans have seen all these men in uni
form, apparently interchangeable, eating the same
i food and performing similar duties. Thence it has
i given root to the concept of "the average American."
j Jumping to the conclusions, the "elite" of Europe
1 complaisantly compare themselves to these "average

Americans" and naturally have no trouble to rate
the culture of the.United States »"ns definitely inferioi
to their own.
Besides, post-war years which bring so many
movie-stars and millionaires to the deluxe hotels of
Switzerland and the Riviera add fresh fuel to the
European feeling that the United States is essentially
a materialistic, money-making country with little
culture in balance.
Finally, Nazi and now Communist propaganda have
systematically ingrafted the idea of the decrepit, per
nicious American civilization. Even upon those who
believe to be impermeable to totalitarian ideologies,
often-repeated and consciously truth-distorting slo
gans leave their marks in the long run.
And now that the European student's apprehensions
have been explained, let us watch his reactions when
he lands in the United States.
He is amazed, baffled. He meets an America very
different from what he had been, expecting—and fear
ing.
New York is the first surprise. Its skyscrapers may
look disappointing to anyone used to seeing them
from bottom to top through the classical pictures of
th camera. In return, Fifth Avenue seems as wel
coming and familiar as London's Regent Street, or
Paris Rur de Rivoli. And as soon as he has lett the
city, the European can stare at the wild, bright flow
ers of the Hudson Valley, exactly at the spot where
he held expected to row of factory chimneys.
Then come the Middle-West and the West. lowa,
Nebraska, Wyoming, each state shows a different
look, hi ings out another appeal. To the diversity-used
European it is the relieving sign that the United
States is not the dull, all-alike country imagined.
The first weeks in an American university are an
other warning to him. P.ook reports, home work, term
papers, end-quarter exams—this avalanche of work
scales him; first, because in Europe he was used to
concentrate all his energy for the year's final exams
in June-July; second, because in his mind, American
universities wetv closely associated with daily foot
ball games and country-club life.
The finishing stroke to all disquieting anticipations
is given by the Americans themselves. Where rush
and selfishness had been feared, help, kindness, and
hospitality wer6 found, thus showing the United
States' true face.
