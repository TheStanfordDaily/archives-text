# Why Do Reg Dances Fail?
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
What's wrong with Stanford Reg
Dances? There's no life, no zip, and
not much fun. Yes. we know that
everyone has come back to college
to sleep off vacation and no one is
in a very festive mood. However,
the dances themselves might be im
proved so that every quarter would
begin with an evening full of fun
and entertainment instead of How
ard Fredericks and bis tepid trom
bone.
You've invited your best girl to
this Reg Dance. You haven't seen
her for a whole vacation, and both
of you are anticipating a very
pleasant evening.
You walk into the Women's Gym
and check your coat. You find
shortly that this was a shivering
mistake as you must go outside
again to get to the dance. You walk
by the fountain and find yourself
wondering why all dance commit
tees must be awed by the effect of
colored lights on flowing water.
You agree that it is pretty, but
there must be some way to vary it.
The red spotlight is still in the
northeast corner.
You're almost at the door now.
You imagine the dance floor beau
tifully decorated with crepe paper
and dim, colored lights. Across one
wall is written in huge tinsel letters
"Happy New Year Indians." You
reach the door and enter. You turn
to your date and say, "We must
have come to the wrong place. This
is a basketball court, not a dance
floor." It's a beauty of a court,
though. You can count at least four
baskets.
You suddenly feel you've forgot
ten something. But just as you turn
to go after your tennis shoes and
sweat clothes, a friend bails you
from the midst of the swirling mob
of dancers. He asks you if the or
chestra sounds familiar. You think
back over autumn quarter. Three
times in all you can remember
having heard Howard Fredericks.
Stanford's musical habit played at
the Toyon Formal, the Branncr
Formal, and the Encina Halloween
Dance. By now, all the Farm must
know and love the Wabash Blues.
You wonder why something
couldn't have been done to make a
more auspicious start of 194!) at
Stanford.

The red spotlight is still in the
northeast corner.
You're almost at the door now.
You imagine the dance floor beau
tifully decorated with crepe paper
and dim, colored lights. Across one
wall is written in huge tinsel letters
"Happy New Year Indians." You
reach the door and enter. You turn
to your date and say, "We must
have come to the wrong place. This
is a basketball court, not a dance
floor." It's a beauty of a court,
though. You can count at least four
baskets.
You suddenly feel you've forgot
ten something. But just as you turn
to go after your tennis shoes and
sweat clothes, a friend bails you
from the midst of the swirling mob
of dancers. He asks you if the or
chestra sounds familiar. You think
back over autumn quarter. Three
times in all you can remember
having heard Howard Fredericks.
Stanford's musical habit played at
the Toyon Formal, the Branncr
Formal, and the Encina Halloween
Dance. By now, all the Farm must
know and love the Wabash Blues.
You wonder why something
couldn't have been done to make a
more auspicious start of 194!) at
Stanford.
