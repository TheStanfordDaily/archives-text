## Names Make News 
### 
Shakespeare was wrong when lie
\ said. "A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet." The fact is
j that any human being wants to get
| the "real lowdown" on his fellow
j man. And how is that fellow man
| to be singled out? By name, of
course.
That is why one of the cub re
porter's first learned rules is: Names
Make News! So let's take a look at
some of the names that make the
news.

Mary and Mohammed, contrary
j to the popular belief, are the most
| widely used feminine and mascu
| line names in this wide world of
today. Perhaps therein lies the an
swer lor the oft-asked question of
i "Who is the common man?" After
i all, who is commoner than they?

Smith is the most common last
; name, at least in the United States.
Following that in order are John
-1 son. Brown, Miller, and Jones.

Ever heard of E. V. Durling's
J "triple - threat - repeating - names
club"? President - elect for my
1 money should be ex-Sgt. Joseph
Joseph Joseph (originally a guy
i called Joe) of the Big Strife Two
Army Air Forces.

Another easy name to remember
would be Louis Harris. Or so you
J would think. But Chicago butcher
I Louis Harris found his Greek cus
i tomers couldn't remember it. So he
I had it changed back to Elias Ha
i ralampopoulos (that's pronounced
I Haralampopoulos) . . . and now he

lias 110 troubles at all.

Hail the U.S. long-name champ
oi all time—Anastasios Honchopa
patheodorkoumounttourogetopolous
(it's Irish, I'm telling you). He
fought with the AEF in the first
world war and was then decorated
as well. You can look it up in the
annals. Just think of a typical ser
geant coming to that name in the
morning roll call. It would be
enough to give him an inferiority
complex.

With the back to legibility move
ment now we discover that the ten
most common names of the Army,
as polled in 1945, were, in order:
Smith, Johnson, Brown. Miller.
Jones, Davis, Wilson, Anderson.
Martin, and Taylor.
Now compare those with the ten
top - ranking names in the Navy
forces at the same time: Smith,
Johnson, Brown. Miller. Jones.
Davis, Wilson. Anderson, Martin,
and Taylor.
Look almost alike, don't they?

So you think you have a common
first name? I thought Boh was
about as common as they come.
Just for kicks one day I took a roll
of ship's company on the ship I was
currently serving on and found to
my amazement that John was first
with a 28 count. William came sec
ond with 27. and Bob turned up
only third with 22. There were also
21 Charlies. 15 Joes, 14 Jameses, and
13 Eds. All of which seems to show
a great lack of originality on the
part of our American forebears.
