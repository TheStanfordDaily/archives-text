## Some Things Never Change

To the Editor:
rime has wrought changes in Stanford. Old students observe wistfully
that it just isn t like it was in the good old days. Traditions have di. -
appeared. No smoking on the Quad 'is no longer the rule. The old.
familiar reg lines in the Ad building have been done away with.
the Arl building itself has been changed. Speed, efficiency and convenience
h? v.- become the watchwords of the modern Stanford. What can the
alum cling to for the comfort of familiarity when lie returns for a
visit? Organization and progress have destroyed almost all the vestiges
of the Stanford of old.
But there is one grand old institution that has stood the test of time
and progress. There is still something on our campus we can count on al
ways to remain the same, and it is a comfort to behold it— firm, unaltered
and unmoved by the demands for speed, efficiency, and convenience. God
bless the Stanford Bookston—it will never change! R. WHITHAM
