# Finnish Student Adjusts Easily to American Ways
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Among ,the four dozen persons
' who assemble twice a day in the
Theta Xi dining room is Pentti .
Lehti, 23-year-old Finnish student
I studying at Stanford"under the For
j eign Scholarship Plan.
At first glance, however, the fair
haired Scandinavian is not easily
distinguished from the brothers
who are eating there, for like ev
eryone e'se he is likely to be busy
cramming a Dagwood hamburger
into his mouth, wondering if he will
' be able to finish it before the bell
rings for seconds. Temporarily, at
j least, he has abandoned the Euro- !
I pean custom of eating a slow and
leisurely meal.
Pentti Adjusts Itapidly
This characteristic habit of Amer
| ican college men is typical of the
j manner in which Pentti has adapt -
ed himself to life at Stanford and
in the United States.
j He likes hamburgers with plenty
! of catsup, American slang, and
Chaparral jokes. And on Sunday i
! mornings he is often one of the last
I men to leave the sleeping porch,
usually with a murmured comment
on the night before.
Pentti moved into the Theta Xi
house only a few days ago after
having received three months' in
troduction to Stanford through the
courtesy of Phi Delta Theta. After
j spring vacation, he will be a guest
- .it the Chi Psi lodge.
Einds Work Hard
College life for Pentti, as inter
esting as it is to him, is not all
: beer and skittles. A graduate stu
: dent in economics, he is finding his
! studies fairly difficult. Lessons for
j him are doubly hard since they
! must first be translated before lie j
! can absorb their meaning. This i
procedure necessarily calls for in- (
tense concentration and long hours

of study. Noisy fraternity men do 1
not lessen his difficulties.
Follows Movies, Music
Long before he came to this |
country, Pentti had a fair idea of
what to expect by virtue of his
knowledge of American movies and \
swing bands. Boris Karloff and
Shirley Temple are both familiar
names to him and he admits that
the music of Benny Goodman is 1
much preferred to the works of
classical composers (with the ex- !
ception of Finland's Jean Sibelius).
Already he has made several
visits to San Francisco night clubs
where he has proved himself a se
vere critic of American jazz.
"I like that bebop music very i
much," he says enthusiastically, !
"and Dizzy Gillespie is really 0.K..
but some of the stuff you hear in
San Francisco is awful."
Beer Popular in Finland
In his Helsinki University Union,
counterpart of the American fra- j
ternity, beer is the accepted bever
age and is used as liberally as it is
in American universities. There was
no transition problem for Pentti in
that respect. He is also learning j
the drinking songs of the Farm so '
that he may introduce them at Hel- â– 
sinki social gatherings next year.
"Here," he decided alter consid
erable thought, "I believe that I
like to drink beer at Dinah's best,
largely because they always seem
to ring the bell while I am there. I
It is a very nice custom, I think."
When he returns to his home in j
Finland next summer after having
lived at Stanford for a nine-month
period, Pentti will doubtlessly have
become one of this country's fore- !
most goodwill ambassadors. It would
be a hard thing for him to avoid, for
regardless of how chagrined his
family may be. he is practically
one of us already.
