### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Boxing Coach Ray Lunny an
nounced yesterday that his varsity
punchers will enter the ring for
their first interscholastic match of
the year Jan. 14, the leather-sling
ing Broncos from Santa Clara pro
viding the opposition.
Lunny was reluctant to make any
definite predictions regarding the
coming boxing season except for
the statement that "we should do
at least as well as last year." Ray's
1948 gladiators finished their sea
son with an even .500 average.
The loss of Emery Mitchell, who
had been heavily counted on to fill
the number one heavyweight spot,
provided Lunny with his largest
single problem of the young sea
son.
Three Vie for Top Spot
Mike Pelsinger, Jim Vatcher, and
Charles Brown are all gunning for
the top spot vacated by the injured
Mitchell. Pelsinger is a junior col
lege transfer from Long Beach; and
although he is relatively inexperi
enced, Lunny expects Big Mike to
make a good showing.
Winner of the all-University nov
ice championship last year, Vatcher
will also be battling for the num
ber one position this season along
with Brown, a veteran of the 1948
varsity squad.
Another mainstay on Lunny's

battling crew is Jim Hammond, a
175 - pounder with a murderous
punch. According to Ray, '"When
Jim hits 'em, they stay hit.'" Bill
Sharpe will also be a contender
for Stanford in the light - heavy
weight division.
Rockin' and sockin' 'em from the
165-pound slot will be Fred Ten
Eyck, a fancy boxer who went un
defeated last year. Fred scored a
major upset in 1948 by decisioning
Jack Lamke of Cal, one of the
coast's top men in the division.
Two Lightweights
Wooly Altus, 155-pound slugger,
is the old-timer of the team as he
begins his third year of skull-bash
ing for Stanford. Wooly has a fine
interscholastic record to his credit
and should be impressive this year.
Lunny has two top-notch light
weights in Jay Savage and Jose
Rael. Savage lived up to his name
by winning three and losing one as
a sophomore and will alternate with
Rael this season.
Battling at 165 pounds, in addi
tion to Ten Eyck, will be Dick
Hoffman, Oren Rush, and John
Franklin; Altus will have Alan
Anderson and Pete Slusser as his
running mates in the 155-pound di
vision; Bob Hudson carries the In
dians' hopes at 145 pounds; and
Max Money and Bob Baker are
pushing Savage and Rael for light
weight honors.
