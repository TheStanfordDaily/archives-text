NEW YORK, Jan. 5 (/P).—Bob
Mathias, the 17 - year - old marvel
from Tulare who won the Olympic
decathlon championship at London,
has been voted the James E. Sulli
van Memorial Trophy as the out
standing U.S. amateur athlete for 1
1948.
The award, most coveted in the
world of amateur sport, has been
given annually since 1930 to the
amateur "who, by performance, ex
ample, and good influence, did most
to advance the cause of good
sportsmanship during the year."

Preparatory School at Saltsburg,
Pa., was given 201 first-place votes
out of 525 ballots cast by sports
leaders throughout the country.
The trophy will be presented to
Mathias at a luncheon here on Feb.
20, the day after the National AAU
indoor championships at Madison
Square Garden, in which the Cali
fornia phenomenon may be "a com
petitor.
In citing Mathias for the award,
the AAU said:
"His extreme modesty, his excel
lent sportsmanship, and his terrific
competitive spirit have endeared
him to all followers of sport.
'"He is strictly a team player.
When urged by the coach of the
U."S. Olympic track and field team
to refrain from basketball and high
school track competition to concen
trate on the decathlon, he refused,
since he feT that he could not let
his teammates down."
Highest Since '4l

10 - event decathlon for the first

Three weeks later he won the Na
tional AAU title with 7,224 points.
The victory of the 6-2, 193-pound
youth over the world's greatest all
round athletes at London was per
haps the most dramatic single in
cident of the '4B Olympics. The sta
dium in which the games were held
had no lighting equipment, and the
final events were run off shortly
before midnight in the feeble glow
cast by bulbs in the grandstand.
