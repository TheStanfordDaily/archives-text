# Excom Holds First Meeting
## 
### 
Last night's first Excom meeting
j of winter quarter ranged from the
| serious side to the humorous angle.
On the serious note, Student
| Manager John Pool read a letter to
' Excom from the Bookstore's board
jof directors. The board requested
i that Excom appoint a student com
; mittee to investigate suggestions
i with Bookstore employees to iron
| out first-week crowded conditions
: within the store. The management
1 wants to consider proposals to re
l lieve congestion that will provide
the best service to student and fac
! ulty customers.
Several students and a faculty
I members, meanwhile, will begin a
cost study of books and supplies at
; the Bookstore in order to determine
whether the campus prices are
i more than, equal to, or less than
Palo Alto prices in its book and
; supply stores.
Gigi Marion re
quested Excom to amend its Dec. 1
oe».ii>»on on women's voting on im-
I tant issues. Excom had ruled
; that a simple majority vote would
! be necessary to pass such legisla
! tion. AWS wants a two-third ap
| proval by women voters on impor
| tant issues because such a response
1 would signify that the women bet
ter understand and approve the leg
islation. Excom approved the mo
tion to read "The issue, in order to
j pass, must receive a two-thirds ma
j jority."
Humorous Note
A humorous note entered Excom
business when Tom *Me-
I sented the constitution of the Stan
ford Grotto of National Speliological
Society, or the Stanlord cave ciuo.
