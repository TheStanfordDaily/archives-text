Stanford makes its first bid for Southern Division basketball
supremacy tomorrow and Saturday nights, when the Indians
take on UCLA and USC in the Pavilion. Tipoffs are set for 8 p.m.
both nights, with preliminaries scheduled for 6:45.
All tickets for the weekend have been sold out, and a capacity

crowd is expected-to be on hand to
watch the favored Cards attempt
their first hurdle in a 12-game
steeplechase.
Boasting a 55 to 47 win over the
Bruins in the recent PCC Invita
tional Tournament, Stanford should
have an easier time with the West
wooders than it will have with USC.
Trojans Money Players
The Trojans, always good in the
clutch, have* not shown their true
abilities' so - .far this season. Sam
Barry's charges have been too in
consistent to be rated as a top-notch
team. Yet, on certain nights, such
as when Troy pummeled Oregon
State, 60 to 40, USC is hard to beat.
The Trojans have also beaten
Loyola, Utah, and Wisconsin. But
they have dropped three games to
Utah, and one each to Northwestern, I
California, and Washington State, j
Troy's season record stands at 4 j
wins and 6 losses.

That record does not quite com
pare with Stanford's powerful look
ing 10 wins in 11 tries. But USC is
riding the crest of a 4-game win
streak over the Cards, and will not
be willing to give up the game with
out a last ditch fight.
Stanford Leads in Rivalry
In the total games played between
the two schools, Stanford has a nar
row edge in victories, 45 to 44. The
Stanford-Southern California bas
ketball series has always been one
of the most spirited rivalries on the
Coast.

Led by tricky Bill Sharman, a
high-scoring forward, USC will be
out to even up the ledger. Shar
man is one of the smoothest bas
ketball men to be seen in the Pa
vilion this season. He combines a
driving floor game with a deadly
one-handed jump shot that has
given him 140 points in 10 games,
and makes him a tough customer to
stop. Sharman's running mate, Abe
Androff (Troy's captai/i), can get
red hot at times with a long dis
tance push shot. If feeling right,
Androff can be dangerously consis
tent in adding up points.
Hannum Greatly Missed
At center, USC has greatly missed
tall Alex Hannum, whose work
against Stanford was probably the
main reason why the Trojans took
the Cards four-straight last sea
son. Six-foot four-inch and 204-
pound Stan Christie has taken over
the pivot spot, and although not too
agile around the key, he has
dumped in 92 points in 10 games,
and has been Troy's best man on
the boards.
Whistling Fred Bertram, playing
with a brace on his bad leg, and
Marty Pelka from Indiana, round
out the first string. Bertram has
been hindered all this season with a
trick knee, but is expected to be in
good shape for this weekend.
Stanford worked last night on
brushing up the fast break, and also
in perfecting two sets of defense for
the Bruins and Trojans. The de
fensive preparation for these two

clubs is made doubly difficult be
cause each employs such a different
type of offense.
UCLA moves at top speed, rely
ing on a scatter-ball type of play
with lots of follow-up. USC is de
liberate, slower in setting up varia
tions, and uses blocks and screens
to great advantage.

tional Tournament, Stanford should
have an easier time with the West
wooders than it will have with USC.
Trojans Money Players
The Trojans, always good in the
clutch, have* not shown their true
abilities' so - .far this season. Sam
Barry's charges have been too in
consistent to be rated as a top-notch
team. Yet, on certain nights, such
as when Troy pummeled Oregon
State, 60 to 40, USC is hard to beat.
The Trojans have also beaten
Loyola, Utah, and Wisconsin. But
they have dropped three games to
Utah, and one each to Northwestern, I
California, and Washington State, j
Troy's season record stands at 4 j
wins and 6 losses.

That record does not quite com
pare with Stanford's powerful look
ing 10 wins in 11 tries. But USC is
riding the crest of a 4-game win
streak over the Cards, and will not
be willing to give up the game with
out a last ditch fight.
Stanford Leads in Rivalry
In the total games played between
the two schools, Stanford has a nar
row edge in victories, 45 to 44. The
Stanford-Southern California bas
ketball series has always been one
of the most spirited rivalries on the
Coast.

Led by tricky Bill Sharman, a
high-scoring forward, USC will be
out to even up the ledger. Shar
man is one of the smoothest bas
ketball men to be seen in the Pa
vilion this season. He combines a
driving floor game with a deadly
one-handed jump shot that has
given him 140 points in 10 games,
and makes him a tough customer to
stop. Sharman's running mate, Abe
Androff (Troy's captai/i), can get
red hot at times with a long dis
tance push shot. If feeling right,
Androff can be dangerously consis
tent in adding up points.
Hannum Greatly Missed
At center, USC has greatly missed
tall Alex Hannum, whose work
against Stanford was probably the
main reason why the Trojans took
the Cards four-straight last sea
son. Six-foot four-inch and 204-
pound Stan Christie has taken over
the pivot spot, and although not too
agile around the key, he has
dumped in 92 points in 10 games,
and has been Troy's best man on
the boards.
Whistling Fred Bertram, playing
with a brace on his bad leg, and
Marty Pelka from Indiana, round
out the first string. Bertram has
been hindered all this season with a
trick knee, but is expected to be in
good shape for this weekend.
Stanford worked last night on
brushing up the fast break, and also
in perfecting two sets of defense for
the Bruins and Trojans. The de
fensive preparation for these two

clubs is made doubly difficult be
cause each employs such a different
type of offense.
UCLA moves at top speed, rely
ing on a scatter-ball type of play
with lots of follow-up. USC is de
liberate, slower in setting up varia
tions, and uses blocks and screens
to great advantage.


COACH EVERETT DEAN sends
his cagers into action tomorrow
night against the UCLA Bruins in
the opening game of the Southern
Division basketball season. Dean's
men have won 10 out of 11 games

Stanford makes its first bid for Southern Division basketball
supremacy tomorrow and Saturday nights, when the Indians
take on UCLA and USC in the Pavilion. Tipoffs are set for 8 p.m.
both nights, with preliminaries scheduled for 6:45.
