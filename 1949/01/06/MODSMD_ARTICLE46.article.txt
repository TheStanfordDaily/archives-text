# Varsity baseballers Loosen Up Today
## 
### 
If the weatherman doesn't freeze
them out of it, Harry Wolter's
hojrsehide specialists will get to
gether this afternoon for their first
oflcial baseball workout of the
year.
Looking forward to a great sea
soil, the baseball men are wasting
no. time in getting started, and al
though it's really too cold for base
ball, they'll be out on the Sunken
Diamond taking their swings as of
this afternoon.
Led by Captain Bill Arce who is
back for his third campaign at the
hot corner, Stanford will boast a
veteran infield that on paper looks
as good as any in the CIBA.
First Base Taken
Consistent Charlie Cole, out
standing first sacker on the Coast
last season, will be back at the in
itial sack. Cole's bat is expected to
C'play part in the coming sea-
Son.
At second base, which was a
problem last season, Jim "Doc"
]Vj|spn looks as if he may fill the
bit. Jim is a good fielder, and could
develop into a powerful stick-man.
Buck Brownson won't be back at
short, but hard-hitting Dave Mel
ton will make any Brownson fans
foiget that anyone else ever held
fojt in the short patch. Melton was
a minor sensation with his hitting
at the end of last season, and now
with a year of fielding practice be
hind him, he is ready for a banner
season.
i Nava May Shift to Right
The outfield positions appear to
be'wide open, except for right field
where Blasting Bob Nava will make
his home. A long ball hitter, Nava
took his swings from the cleanup
spot in the lineup last spring, and
figures to be right back there when
this next season opens up.
Clyde Dingfelder, back for his
third year, will be another familiar
face in the outer garden.
Laßruni Throwing Well
Leading the hurling candidates at
this time is Frank Laßrum, who
combines a variety of pitches to
command any batter's respect. Also
A Leftv. Dayc. Pahje,, one of
SPTHE TJIBA'S top hurlers last season.
* . Pave Stott and Ed Shive will also
be around to form what should pan
out to be an effective mound corps.


BILL ARCE,
captain - elect of
Stanford's baseball
team, will
be among those
present this afternoon,
as the
horsehiders get
together for the
first practice of
the year. Arce
wall be playing
his third year as
starting third
sacker.
