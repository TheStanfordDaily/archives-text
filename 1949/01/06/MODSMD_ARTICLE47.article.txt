# In the Count of the Beloved Oak

When I came back Monday.
I had two checks burning
holes in my pockets. Regis
tration fixed up one. I knew
where I was going with the
other.
I caught the first bus down
town to the Clothes Closet,
back to those tweed skirts
that came in just as I was
Reaving for vacation. Nothing'
could be newer, smarter, pret
tier than those fine tweeds. I
had a hard time choosing
among the browns, blues,
griffs; and greens.
I settled on a blue and had
only to turn around to face
the most complete selection
of sweaters in Palo Alto
every color, every style, ev
ery size was there. I selected
a soft royal blue rabbit's hair.
Because it was only $4.95 I
knew I was going' to be able
to stretch my Christmas mon
ey a long way. You'd better
follow in my footsteps and
start the new year with a
beautiful new sweater and
skirt from the Clothes Closet,
520 Ramona off University.
