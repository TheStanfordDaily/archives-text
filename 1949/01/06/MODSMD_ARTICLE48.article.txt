It's time to talk a little basket
ball and make some of those stupid
predictions. Predictions really are
n't a necessary item in writing
about a sport, but everybody does
it, although it doesn't make a bit
of difference whether the picks
come true or not.
Out of one million and one such
predictions, perhaps one will be
tabbed correctly, and when that
happens, pal, you hear nothing but
that Phil Miser, or such, called the
shot. Oh well, here goes nothing.
When USC's Trojans hook up
with our talented hand in their
scheduled engagement in the Pa
vilion on Saturday night, local fans
will be able to see four All-South
ern Division goodies on the floor at
the same time.
That is giving Stanford all the
benefit of any doubt, but the entire
team includes George Yardley and
Bill Sharman at forwards, Bill Ste
phenson at center, and Dave David
son and Bob Walker at guards. It
was a tossup between George Stan
ich and Walker for the last guard
spot, but I think that George's little
brother, Bob, will keep improving
all season.
Stanford on Top
To top off the Southern Division
picks, there should be a rating of
how the teams will finish in the
race itself. After a quick peek in
the crystal globe, the shadow shows

Stanford coming up with its first
cage crown since 1942, with 9 wins
and Â£ losses. Sam Barry's USC
Trojans will wind up second, tab
California for third, and throw open
the cellar for UCLA.
The Southern Division race
should be plenty tight this season,
but I think that Stanford has the
ability to break fast with a double
win this weekend, and then grab
that rail and stick it out.
Sharman vs. Yartiley
Highlighting Saturday night's
meeting between Troy and Stanford
will be the individual free-throw
ing' duel between Bill Sharman and
George Yardley.
Sharman, a slick performer in all
departments, has pumped in 15
straight Salvation Army tosses..
Yardley isn't far behind, as he has
missed only three in the last five
games, and ranks 16th in the na
tion in free-throwing percentages.
Walt Gamage, who whips out the
Sport Shots for the Palo Alto
Times, points out that George
Yardley is good on tip-ins because
he plays volleyball all summer. He
also says he wouldn't be surprised
to see Coach Everett Dean rush out
to buy a flock of volleyballs for his
other boys to get the gift. But the
fact is. Coach Dean is way ahead
of him, and has already sent his
boys through their volleyball paces..
