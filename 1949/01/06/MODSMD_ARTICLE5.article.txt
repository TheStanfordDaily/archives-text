WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (AP)—President Truman called on the
Democratic 81st Congress today for a "fair deal" program—a
vast extension of social and economic legislation in the direction
pointed by the Roosevelt New Deal.
To help finance it, he urged a $4,000,000,000 increase in taxes,

K aimed chiefly at corporations. Fur
j ther big boosts in taxes would re
| suit if the whole Truman program
! were enacted.
Social Legislation
It provides, among other things,
for bigger social security benefit.*:
pre-paid medical and health insur
ance; 1,000,000 new public housing
I units in seven years, and aid to edu
| cation.
I Among other recommendations
I that stood out in the 3,500-word
| "State of the Unjon" message the
I President delivered in person were:
| The power to impose sweeping
, economic controls, including curb*
| on some wages and prices; authority
, to build steel plants and other fac
j tories if deemed necessary in view
|of shortages; repeal of the Taft-
Hartley Labor Law; universal mili
; tary training; aid to farmers ana
! civil rights laws.
Called a Liberal
Thirty-seven different salvoes of
applause rang out in the packed
House chamber where representa
tives and senators heard ihe speech.
But all was not unanimity, by any
means.
Southerners sat on their hands as
he called for the civil rights pro»
gram which tore the party last year.
And the whole message brought a
mixed reaction in statements issued
I later.
Some legislators hailed it as a
"liberal" document with a splendid
appeal to the American people."
| Some denounced it as "Socialistic"
; and a blow against individual lib
erties.
Emphasizes Cooperation l
Mr. Truman, who saw his pro
gram riddled by the last, Republican
Congress, laid special emphasis oar
"cooperation" in promoting what he
called a "dynamic economy."
"I hope for cooperation from
fanners, from labor and from busi
ness," he said. "Every segment of
our population and every individual
have a right to expect from our
government a fair deal."

And the whole message brought a
mixed reaction in statements issued

"liberal" document with a splendid
appeal to the American people."
| Some denounced it as "Socialistic"
; and a blow against individual lib
erties.
