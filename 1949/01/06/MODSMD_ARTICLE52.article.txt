### 
''We've never had it so clean!"
So say (he residents of the eight
living gx-oups on campus that boast
newly installed washing machines.
Encina men seem to be having a
bit of trouble with leaky doors and
sloppy floors, but they mop up, fig
uring the machines actually save
time, money, and effort.
Toyon and Crothers men are still
waiting for the dryers that have
been promised them, and though
they all have to spend a dime to
run the washers, they claim that in
the case of the Bendix, a dime spent
is a dollar saved.
Women at Ventura may grimace
a bit at the Big Ben crouched right
next to the phone. They say it's
hard to carry on an intelligent con
versation with a girl's dress burn
ing on the ironing board, the Ben
dix goine, and two other phones
ringing at the same time. Yet all
agree that Big Ben is there to stay
vmd they're more than glad to have
him.
Machines at Lagunita, Roble,
Manzanita, and Madrono have also
been put in operation. The auto
matic washers were installed in the
early part of December afe' a result
of negotiations between Alf Bran
don. business manager, and several
machine venders and operators. An
ASSU committee headed by Bob
Brown and Ken Croft first started
the movement to chase away wash
day blues.
