## Poulter Describes Oil-Finding Method 
### 
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 5 (£»).—A :
Stanford University professor today j
demonstrated his new method to
determine the presence of oil deep '
in the earth to 200 West Coast geol
ogists and geophysicists meeting I
| here in annual session.
Dr. Thomas C. Poulter described
| his method of exploring for oil, then i
| accompanied delegates to a field 32 |
! miles south of here, where practi- |
cal demonstrations were given.
A specially shaped charger is
employed and dynamite is exploded
above the surface, producing a
man-made earthquake that is re
j corded on a machine. From this,
: experts can determine the likeli
! hood of oil at any given depth.
| Dr. Poulter said Ihe method is
j faster, less expensive, and saves
the average drilling crew from '
! $5,000 to $15,000 on each explora-
I tion. !
