Wooden Is Coach
Tutored by Jack Wooden, for
merly of Indiana State, the Bruin
have come up with a new team anc
a new spirit this season. Winninc
eight and losing thi-ee in pre-con
ference games, the Westwood cag
ers surprised everyone with their
alert, hard-to-beat floor game.
High-scoring Chuck Clustka at
forward and big George Stanich at
guard are the mainstays of the
Uclan attack. Clustka has scored
140 points in 10 games for a 14-point
average. Six - foot five - inch Carl
Kraushaar handles the pivot chores,
and tall Alan Sawyer at forward
and stubby Ron Pearson at guard
round out the team.
Coach Everett Dean named his
starting team for Stanford last night
with George Yardley and Bill Rose
or Milt Iverson at the forwards.
Captain Bill Stephenson will pla\
center, and Dave Davidson and Bob
Lewis will start at guards.
Yardley Top Scorer
Gus Chavalas and Marv Gelber
should see early guard duty, as
both have looked sharp in practice
all this week. Ralph Carver will
back up Stephenson at center.
Also figuring to see action to
night are reserve forwards Bill
Lewis and Paul Watson. Both have
progressed rapidly since the begin
ning of the season.
George Yardley. Stanford's high
est scorer with 138 points, should
go great guns against UCLA. Two
weeks ago, he pushed through 13
points against Westwood. Bill Ste
phenson also found the range


CHUCK CLUSTKA. UCLA's top
scorer, will lead the Bruins to
night as they invade the Pavilion
to battle Stanford in the opening
game of the Southern Division
basketball season. Clustka was
