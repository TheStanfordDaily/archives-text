# Dr. Johnston Outlines 4-Point Plan For Expansion of Religious Activity
## 
### DEBBY WELLES 
A broad program for religious
activities for Farm students was
outlined yesterday by Dr. Paul
Covey Johnston, nationally
known religious figure who has ar
rived on campus to assume his duties
as University Chaplain.
Dr. Johnston described a lour
point plan for continuance and ex
pansion of activities centering
around the Memorial Church.
Primary in his aims is an exten
sive program of student counciling
closely coordinated with the coun
ciling service offered by Dean of
Students Laurence Kimpton. Work
ing with Johnston in the field will
be Associate Chaplain Robert M.
Minto.
Johnston also advocated the re
vitalization and extension of the
general campus program of student
religious activities, to be led, he sug
gested. by a group of democratically
elected members of the student
body. His plans include a possible
student council on general religious
activity, to work closely with the
present Memorial Church board.
Such a council would form a basis
for his" program of "more compre
hensive religious activity, involving
more than just the Chapel itself."
A third and major point in the
new chaplain's program involves the
inauguration of "adequate teaching
of religion on an academic level.'
Dr. Johnston hopes in the future to

obtain three or four endowed chairs
and to bring some of the most im
portant religious figures in the
country to the Stanford campus as
professors.
His program also involves the res
surection on campus of the YMCA
group and the extension and inte
gration into general religious activ
ity of the present YWCA center.
Johnston will assume with his po

sition the responsibility for three
fourths of the sermons delivered in
the Memorial Church.
His 35 years' experience in reli
gious work and preaching has
brought him into contact with many
j.-roups of University students, al
though he has never actually
worked under a university appoint
ment. Before he bccame minister
of the First Presbyterian Church in
Los Angeles, he worked with stu
dents in parishes in Lincoln, Neb.,
and Rochester, N.Y. He has spoken
as a guest at many other universi
ties. including Stanford, where he
preached a year ago this week.
Dr. Johnston will preach Sunday
in the regular Memorial Church
services at 11 a.m. and will conduct
the special memorial service for the
late Dr. D. Charles Gardner, first
Stanford chaplain, Sunday at 4.
"I have always enjoyed university
life and university students," Dr.
Johnston said. "1 have certainly
been looking forward to this time
with anticipation and eagerness, and
I look forward now to the times
ahead."
Dr. and Mrs. Johnston are staying
temporarily in the President Hotel
until they are able to find satisfac
tory living quarters.

A third and major point in the
new chaplain's program involves the
inauguration of "adequate teaching
of religion on an academic level.'
Dr. Johnston hopes in the future to

obtain three or four endowed chairs
and to bring some of the most im
portant religious figures in the
country to the Stanford campus as
professors.
His program also involves the res
surection on campus of the YMCA
group and the extension and inte
gration into general religious activ
ity of the present YWCA center.
Johnston will assume with his po

sition the responsibility for three
fourths of the sermons delivered in
the Memorial Church.
His 35 years' experience in reli
gious work and preaching has
brought him into contact with many
j.-roups of University students, al
though he has never actually
worked under a university appoint
ment. Before he bccame minister
of the First Presbyterian Church in
Los Angeles, he worked with stu
dents in parishes in Lincoln, Neb.,
and Rochester, N.Y. He has spoken
as a guest at many other universi
ties. including Stanford, where he
preached a year ago this week.
Dr. Johnston will preach Sunday
in the regular Memorial Church
services at 11 a.m. and will conduct
the special memorial service for the
late Dr. D. Charles Gardner, first
Stanford chaplain, Sunday at 4.
"I have always enjoyed university
life and university students," Dr.
Johnston said. "1 have certainly
been looking forward to this time
with anticipation and eagerness, and
I look forward now to the times
ahead."
Dr. and Mrs. Johnston are staying
temporarily in the President Hotel
until they are able to find satisfac
tory living quarters.


DR. PAUL COVLY JOHNSTON
yesterday assumed his duties as
new University chaplain.
A broad program for religious
activities for Farm students was
outlined yesterday by Dr. Paul
Covey Johnston, nationally
known religious figure who has ar
rived on campus to assume his duties
as University Chaplain.
Dr. Johnston described a lour
point plan for continuance and ex
pansion of activities centering
around the Memorial Church.
Primary in his aims is an exten
sive program of student counciling
closely coordinated with the coun
ciling service offered by Dean of
Students Laurence Kimpton. Work
ing with Johnston in the field will
be Associate Chaplain Robert M.
Minto.
Johnston also advocated the re
vitalization and extension of the
general campus program of student
religious activities, to be led, he sug
gested. by a group of democratically
elected members of the student
body. His plans include a possible
student council on general religious
activity, to work closely with the
present Memorial Church board.
Such a council would form a basis
for his" program of "more compre
hensive religious activity, involving
more than just the Chapel itself."
A third and major point in the
new chaplain's program involves the
inauguration of "adequate teaching
of religion on an academic level.'

obtain three or four endowed chairs
