To the Editor:
Twentieth Century-Fox is looking for the country's most beautiful
atid talented college freshman woman. We do not propose to steal her
away from her books or to feature her in a forthcoming picture, although
her reward for her natural endowments will be an all-expense trip to
Hollywood as our guest.
Reason for all of this is our new technicolor comedy-drama "Mother
Is A Freshman," co-starring Loretta Young and Van Johnson. We plan
to world premiere "Mother Is A Freshman" simultaneously in 12 college
towns early in March.
We now turn to you. as an expert of the college scene and ask you
to wire us collect, 20th Century-Fox, 444 West sGth Street, New York,
r>o later than Jan. 15 a list of the 12 colleges, either co-ed or girls'
schools in order of your choice, which in your opinion contain the most
beautiful and talented freshman women. For your information it is not,
and we repeat not, necessary that they be mothers in order to compete
this "Mother Is A Freshman" contest. We will then conduct individual
selection contests in each of the 12 colleges which are named by a majority
of college editors.
One winner will be picked from each college on the basis of her beauty,
student body activities, scholastic average, and talent in any of the lively
arts. These contests will be conducted during our world premiere festivi
ties in the college towns selected. The 12 winning freshmen will all
receive prizes with the all-expense trip to Hollywood going to the national
all-American freshman girl. On which campuses do we find our girls?
