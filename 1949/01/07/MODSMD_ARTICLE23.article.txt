To the Editor:
(Bookstore suggestion written while waiting in line.) The very least
that could be done would be to mark the text counter—white adhesive
would do—so definite, short lines could be formed, and the clerks should
wait on the first person in each line in rotation. As it is. some areas are
favored while others wait, and wait, and wait.
This would at least be more fair to those students who don't like to
shove, elbow, and crowd their fallow sufferers to get a place by the
counter.
You can take it from here; I think I am going to be served. Glory be!
