HONG KONG, Jan. ('. (/I'). Fori
fugitive Chinese this British crown [
colony has become an invaluable |
refuge.
Less than 15 years ago this was a |
quiet colonial port. The population
wavered around ihe three - quarter |
million mark.
Then in 1937, with the Japanese !
invasion of China, the people of
South China began flocking for
safety to Hong Kong. There were
then, and are now, no regulations
on Chinese entry.
By 1941 the colony had assumed
boom town aspects. More than 2,-
000,000 person were crowded onto
the small island of Victoria, which
is entirely occupied by the city of
Hong Kong, and spread out over to
Kowloon on the adjacent mainland
territories of the colony.
When the Japanese overran and
conquered Hong Kong on Christ
mas 1941, they set about cutting the
copulation by a relentless repatria
tion of Chinese to China. In addi
tion, many left voluntarily. to es
cape starvation.
By the time of the Japanese sur
render in 1945, Hong Kong's popu
lation was down to about a million.
With British reoccupation, it soon
began to rise again. Many Chinese
employed here before the war re
turned.
As the military and economic sit
uations in China worsened, the in
flux swelled.
"Every time the currency drop
ped or the Communists advanced in
China, the Hong Kong population
jumped," one oldtimer relates.
New hordes arrived after the
drastic Chinese government eco
nomic program of last August. Many
of the newcomers were rich busi
ness men from Shanghai.
Hong Kong also is a haven for
political refugees, not only from
China, but Chinese Communists
from Indonesia, from the Philip
pines, from Burma and Siam.
In short. Chinese fleeing anything
from anywhere seem to come to
this port. They are required only
to behave themselves.
The latest developments in Chi
na's war indicate that the flood may
well continue during 1949.
