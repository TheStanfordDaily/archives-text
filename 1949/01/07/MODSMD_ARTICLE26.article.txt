# 1948 Was Important Year on Farm
## 
### 
Before 1949 is any older, let's look backward for
a few moments at 1948. It was an important year
for Stanford.
Sharing the news spotlight as the most significant
events were the Foreign Scholarship Plan and the
election of a new president.
Students voted two to one at a spring quarter elec
tion to spend $9,050 from the ASSU surplus fund to
provide scholarships for European students. The for
eign scholars, five men and two women, arrived fall
quarter. They lived at Toyon, Union, Lagunita, and
the fraternities. Almost everyone agreed that the
arrangement worked to perfection. The newcomers
were quickly integrated into the pattern of Stanford
life. Both the old Stanfords and the new Stanfords
gained by an exchange of ideas and friendship.
Appointment Nov. 19 of Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling
as Stanford's fifth president climaxed a nine months'
search. The Daily publicized the appointment in an .
extra edition issued a few minutes after the Board
of Trustees announced the appointment of the 42-
year-old historian and director of the Huntington
Library. Students and faculty who were acquainted
with the new president were unanimous in their
praise.
National election fever was reflected on the Stan
ford campus. The Daily, editorially supporting the
Republican candidate, held back the presses long
enough to announce Truman's impending victory.
The traditionally Republican campus took it hard,
dozens of students wearing black arm bands. One
faculty member greeted his 9 o'clock class with, "The
American people have made a mistake." Democrat
supporters rejoiced in an appropriate manner.
ASSU election primaries the following day drew
an average of 10 candidates for each office.
Earlier, in spring quarter, the campus witnessed
the closest, hardest fought campaign for ASSU prc.si
dent in history. Gus Chavalas edged Frank Wolff by
a mere five votes, three ballots and a double count
being taken. Before the election, The Daily Editor
was sharply criticized for his objection to "the flam
boyant campaigning" of one candidate.
Tuition was increased $100 a year to catch up with

rising expenses. Stanford, once the poor man's pri
vate university, caught up with other leading United
States universities in cost. The University announced
it would raise grants in aid and scholarships so that
no one would have to discontinue his education be
cause of the rising costs.
New construction was completed and planned.
Dr. Eurich announced that a New Union Memorial
to Dr. Tresidder was assured as over $100,000 had
been pledged.
Administration offices were moved into the tempo
rary buildings and the main floor of Encina. The
old Administration building was being rapidly con
verted into the new law school as the year faded.
Concrete groundwork for Stern Hall was nearly
completed. Bulk work on the $170,000 microwave
laboratory behind Sequoia Hall was completed.
In research several developments were newsworthy.
Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick, Stanford physicist, per
fected his X-ray mierscope. Dr. Thomas C. Poulter's
new method of seismic oil location was announced.
Women's Council and The Daily gave women some
thing to discuss besides men and dates when they
clashed over the new demerit plan. The Daily's stand
was that the demerit plan was essentially good legis
lation, but that sufficient time was not permitted for
understanding the plan. Also the plan was of suffi
cient importance that it should have been submitted
to a numerical vote of the women students. At the
year's end the plan still was not in effect because of
a difference of opinion between Excom and the AWS
cabinet over a proposed by-law. AWS passed a reso
lution against Excom's action and as a result the
vote on the demerit plan was still in abeyance as
the year closed.
Barbara Jean Denning was chosen to represent the
Western College Congress at Washington, D.C., and
before the United Nations at Lake Success. Paul
Edwards was elected president of the Board of Trus
tees. Trackman Jose Rael nabbed a long-sought pro
fessional locker thief in Encina Gym.
Orderly, swift-moving registration lines appeared
spring quarter.
Brit-fly, those were highlights of 1948 at Stanford.

new method of seismic oil location was announced.
Women's Council and The Daily gave women some
thing to discuss besides men and dates when they
clashed over the new demerit plan. The Daily's stand
was that the demerit plan was essentially good legis
lation, but that sufficient time was not permitted for
understanding the plan. Also the plan was of suffi
cient importance that it should have been submitted
to a numerical vote of the women students. At the
year's end the plan still was not in effect because of
a difference of opinion between Excom and the AWS
cabinet over a proposed by-law. AWS passed a reso
lution against Excom's action and as a result the
vote on the demerit plan was still in abeyance as
the year closed.
Barbara Jean Denning was chosen to represent the
Western College Congress at Washington, D.C., and
before the United Nations at Lake Success. Paul
Edwards was elected president of the Board of Trus

Orderly, swift-moving registration lines appeared
spring quarter.
Brit-fly, those were highlights of 1948 at Stanford.
Before 1949 is any older, let's look backward for
a few moments at 1948. It was an important year
for Stanford.
Sharing the news spotlight as the most significant
events were the Foreign Scholarship Plan and the
election of a new president.
Students voted two to one at a spring quarter elec
tion to spend $9,050 from the ASSU surplus fund to
provide scholarships for European students. The for
eign scholars, five men and two women, arrived fall
quarter. They lived at Toyon, Union, Lagunita, and
the fraternities. Almost everyone agreed that the
arrangement worked to perfection. The newcomers
were quickly integrated into the pattern of Stanford
life. Both the old Stanfords and the new Stanfords
gained by an exchange of ideas and friendship.
Appointment Nov. 19 of Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling
as Stanford's fifth president climaxed a nine months'
search. The Daily publicized the appointment in an .
extra edition issued a few minutes after the Board
of Trustees announced the appointment of the 42-
year-old historian and director of the Huntington
Library. Students and faculty who were acquainted
with the new president were unanimous in their
praise.
National election fever was reflected on the Stan
ford campus. The Daily, editorially supporting the
Republican candidate, held back the presses long
enough to announce Truman's impending victory.
The traditionally Republican campus took it hard,
dozens of students wearing black arm bands. One
faculty member greeted his 9 o'clock class with, "The
American people have made a mistake." Democrat
supporters rejoiced in an appropriate manner.
ASSU election primaries the following day drew
an average of 10 candidates for each office.
Earlier, in spring quarter, the campus witnessed
the closest, hardest fought campaign for ASSU prc.si
dent in history. Gus Chavalas edged Frank Wolff by
a mere five votes, three ballots and a double count
being taken. Before the election, The Daily Editor
was sharply criticized for his objection to "the flam
boyant campaigning" of one candidate.
Tuition was increased $100 a year to catch up with

rising expenses. Stanford, once the poor man's pri
vate university, caught up with other leading United
States universities in cost. The University announced
it would raise grants in aid and scholarships so that
no one would have to discontinue his education be
cause of the rising costs.
New construction was completed and planned.
Dr. Eurich announced that a New Union Memorial
to Dr. Tresidder was assured as over $100,000 had
been pledged.
Administration offices were moved into the tempo
rary buildings and the main floor of Encina. The
old Administration building was being rapidly con
verted into the new law school as the year faded.
Concrete groundwork for Stern Hall was nearly
completed. Bulk work on the $170,000 microwave
laboratory behind Sequoia Hall was completed.
In research several developments were newsworthy.
Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick, Stanford physicist, per
fected his X-ray mierscope. Dr. Thomas C. Poulter's
new method of seismic oil location was announced.
