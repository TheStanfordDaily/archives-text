# Sinatra Labels New Songs A Lousy Pile of Trash
## 
### BOB THOMAS 
HOLLYWOOD. Jan. G (/I 1).-Per
haps you are one of those peo
ple who think today's songs aren't
what they used to be. Then Frank
Sinatra agrees with you.
"Nearly all of the songs I hear
these days are the lousiest pile of
trash I have ever listened to." says
Frankie.
He should know. He has to sing
four or five of them every week on
the Hit Parade. But he hints that
it's not easy work.
"The songs we get are terrible.
They're written by a bunch of hill
billies who know nothing about mu
sic. They put in bars of music
where there shouldn't be any—like
Red Ingle's version of 'Temptation.'
Then they expect a singer to sing
it!"
The .record ban has something to
do with the poor quality of the na
tion's tunes, Frank added.
"The good song writers just aren't
releasing their tunes, because they
can't make money from songs with
out the aid of records. You can't
blame them, because that is their
livelihood.
"But that leaves the song-writing
business to .the amateurs. And the
chances of finding a good song from
an amateur are one in a million."
The lack of melodies goes deeper
than the record ban, asserted
Frank.
"In the last two or three years,
there haven't been the songs that
we heard during the war — songs
like 'So Nice to Come Home To,'
'Old Black Magic,' 'As Time Goes
By.' Don't ask me why."
Maybe it's hard to find some
thing to sing about in these times of
dollar hamburger, housing short
ages, and world crises. How would
this sound—"My Little Gray Home
in the West—Where Are You?" or
"I Found a Million Dollar Baby in
a 25-50 Cent Store"?
The lack of pood sentimental
songs has caused a change in
Frankie's singing style. Seldom
does he indulge in the musical slurs
—sliding from one note to another
— that used to evoke deafening
shrieks from his bobby-socked list
eners. "The new songs aren't suited
to that kind of treatment." he ex
plained.
Frank just about has his work
cut out for him for the next year.
He's now doing "It's Only Money."
his last for RKO. Next year he re
turns to MGM for "On the Town."
which his pal. Gene Kelly, will di
rect as well as co-star in.
On July 1, Frankie will open
an engagement at London's Pal la

dium. He'll return for a remake of
"Roberta" at MGM.
"It's Only Money" also features
Groucho Marx and on opening day
Frank received this wire:
"Be nice to my brother Groucho
or I'll tell Zeppo; signed Harpo.
Best regards from Chico who is liv
ing with Gumma. Susan." The hit
ter is the Marx sister.

'Old Black Magic,' 'As Time Goes

Maybe it's hard to find some
thing to sing about in these times of
dollar hamburger, housing short
ages, and world crises. How would
this sound—"My Little Gray Home

The lack of pood sentimental
songs has caused a change in
Frankie's singing style. Seldom
does he indulge in the musical slurs
—sliding from one note to another
— that used to evoke deafening
shrieks from his bobby-socked list
eners. "The new songs aren't suited
to that kind of treatment." he ex
plained.
Frank just about has his work
cut out for him for the next year.
He's now doing "It's Only Money."
his last for RKO. Next year he re
turns to MGM for "On the Town."

On July 1, Frankie will open
an engagement at London's Pal la

Frank received this wire:
"Be nice to my brother Groucho

Best regards from Chico who is liv

HOLLYWOOD. Jan. G (/I 1).-Per
haps you are one of those peo
ple who think today's songs aren't
what they used to be. Then Frank
Sinatra agrees with you.
"Nearly all of the songs I hear
these days are the lousiest pile of
trash I have ever listened to." says
Frankie.
He should know. He has to sing
four or five of them every week on
the Hit Parade. But he hints that
it's not easy work.
"The songs we get are terrible.
They're written by a bunch of hill
billies who know nothing about mu
sic. They put in bars of music
where there shouldn't be any—like
Red Ingle's version of 'Temptation.'
Then they expect a singer to sing
it!"
The .record ban has something to
do with the poor quality of the na
tion's tunes, Frank added.
"The good song writers just aren't
releasing their tunes, because they
can't make money from songs with
out the aid of records. You can't
blame them, because that is their
livelihood.
"But that leaves the song-writing
business to .the amateurs. And the
chances of finding a good song from
an amateur are one in a million."
The lack of melodies goes deeper
than the record ban, asserted
Frank.
"In the last two or three years,
there haven't been the songs that
we heard during the war — songs
like 'So Nice to Come Home To,'
'Old Black Magic,' 'As Time Goes
By.' Don't ask me why."
