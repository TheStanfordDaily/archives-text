tional Baby Week and National

keeps track of such things, along
with running the Weather Bureau,
taking the census, and issuing pat
ents.
Today it got out a "calendar of
specially designated days, weeks,
and months to be observed during
1949."
Don't blame the department:
somebody else thought .them up.
The only place the government
comes in is trying to help business
men make their advertisements jibe

been wondering, runs from July 23
