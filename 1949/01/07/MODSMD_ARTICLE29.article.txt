LONA HANSON, by Thomas Sav- !
age (Simon and Schuster)
The author of this book is a pro
fessor of English at Suffolk Uni- i
versity. One would, therefore, ex
pect an intelligent, well - written
piece of work. Rather than pass
any direct judgment on the book, |
it is easier to describe the plot and
let the reader judge for himself, j
The plot is, roughly, this:
Lona Hanson inherits ihe fabulous [
20,000-acre Barl Ranch in Montana. I
However, she finds that her grand
father has left it with a large mort- !
gage on it. Lona. although she is
in love with one of the cowboys on
the ranch, decides to marry a rich
man in order to pay off the debt. }
She marries him. but then finds out |
that he doesn't have any money, j
About this time she hires a gang- j
ster to run the ranch. Although a J
criminal by profession, he is a very
good ranch foreman. Things con
tinue to get worse. Lona is still 1
longing for her cowboy (who left
when she married someone else), j
Then Lona's husband runs off with j
her mother. Next the gangster be- |
comes "interested" in Lona and al!
sorts of lurid complications follow.
Then the cowboy-lover returns, but
the gangster shoots him. Here the !
book ends with Lona wondering if j
the 20.000 acres were worth all the
trouble.
Incidentally, this story has been
purchased by the movies, with the |

purchased by the movies to star
Rita Hayworth as Lona.
tiie life and times of the
SIIMOO, by A 1 Capp (Simon and
Schuster)
The saga of the shmoo has been
recorded for posterity in this book.
It is, actually, the collection of the
entire series of comic strips, with
added sections and comments by
the versatile Capp. Here are all of
the intimate details concerning tin'
lives and loves of those lovable.
Utopian little characters. Because
the publication date of the book
was set before the historic 10th of
November, when the fate of the
shmoos was actually to be deter
mined in the Sadie Hawkins Pay
race, Capp has created a new end
ing, which sets forth the moral of
the story. Capp's basic idea is this:
The shmoo satirizes the search for
a panacea for all social injustices
and inconsistencies. The fact is that
the earth is everybody's shmoo.
and there is enough for everybody
on it, it they will find it. There is
no need for Utopias or shmoos. nor
is there any overnight miracle that
would bring butter, eggs, milk,
cheesecakes, several varieties o!
meat, and even suspender buttons
to everybody's doorstep. Nor is the
shmoo an ideal. He is only a lov
able, amiable instrument of satire.
Thus the whole book is as amusing
and engaging as the shmoos them
selves.

tiie life and times of the
SIIMOO, by A 1 Capp (Simon and
Schuster)
The saga of the shmoo has been
recorded for posterity in this book.
It is, actually, the collection of the
entire series of comic strips, with
added sections and comments by
the versatile Capp. Here are all of
the intimate details concerning tin'
lives and loves of those lovable.
Utopian little characters. Because
the publication date of the book
was set before the historic 10th of
November, when the fate of the
shmoos was actually to be deter
mined in the Sadie Hawkins Pay
race, Capp has created a new end
ing, which sets forth the moral of
the story. Capp's basic idea is this:
The shmoo satirizes the search for
a panacea for all social injustices
and inconsistencies. The fact is that
the earth is everybody's shmoo.
and there is enough for everybody
on it, it they will find it. There is
no need for Utopias or shmoos. nor
is there any overnight miracle that
would bring butter, eggs, milk,
cheesecakes, several varieties o!
meat, and even suspender buttons
to everybody's doorstep. Nor is the
shmoo an ideal. He is only a lov
able, amiable instrument of satire.
Thus the whole book is as amusing
and engaging as the shmoos them
selves.
LONA HANSON, by Thomas Sav- !
age (Simon and Schuster)
The author of this book is a pro
fessor of English at Suffolk Uni- i
versity. One would, therefore, ex
pect an intelligent, well - written
piece of work. Rather than pass
any direct judgment on the book, |
it is easier to describe the plot and
let the reader judge for himself, j
The plot is, roughly, this:
Lona Hanson inherits ihe fabulous [
20,000-acre Barl Ranch in Montana. I
However, she finds that her grand
father has left it with a large mort- !
gage on it. Lona. although she is
in love with one of the cowboys on
the ranch, decides to marry a rich
man in order to pay off the debt. }
She marries him. but then finds out |
that he doesn't have any money, j
About this time she hires a gang- j
ster to run the ranch. Although a J
criminal by profession, he is a very
good ranch foreman. Things con
tinue to get worse. Lona is still 1
longing for her cowboy (who left
when she married someone else), j
Then Lona's husband runs off with j
her mother. Next the gangster be- |
comes "interested" in Lona and al!
sorts of lurid complications follow.
Then the cowboy-lover returns, but
the gangster shoots him. Here the !
book ends with Lona wondering if j
the 20.000 acres were worth all the
trouble.
