## 
### 
Winter quarter plans for the
Stanford Debating Society were
disclosed yesterday by John Hines,
debate manager.
Informal seminars are to be held
on French and other European
problems in preparation for the
Joffre debate later this year. Pikj
fessors James Emerson, leader of
the seminars, plans to invite other
faculty members to help the debat
ers prepare for the Joffre debate.
The society is working on three
other questions, Hines said. These
include the questions "How can
civil liberties be guaranteed to all
those living in the United States?"
"Resolved, that the federal govern
ment should adopt a policy of
equalizing educational opportunities
in tax-supported schools by means
of annual grants"; and "Resolved,
that a belief in a deity is necessary
lor morality."
These questions will be argued in

the first home and home debate be
tween the University of Southern
California and Stanford next month.
Stanford will also engage Califor
nia, College of the Pacific, Univer
sity of San Francisco, and San Jose
State College in debate.
The Debate Society is also spon
soring an intramural forensic con
test, according to Jack Marcum, de
bate captain. It will be an extem
poraneous contest on problems of
world peace. Preliminary rounds
will be devoted to the Western
Hemisphere, Asia and the Near
East, and Europe. Al! interested
are asked to up with Professor
Emerson.
Hines emphasized the need for
more freshmen and other new
members in the society, and urged
all men interested in forensics to
attend meetings this quarter. Those
interested should contact Professor
Emerson in room 2013 C or Hines in
room 1 of the Union.
