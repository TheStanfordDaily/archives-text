# Troy Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Southern California's Trojans,
.meeting California in their season
opener tonight, will invade Stan
ford tomorrow night for the second
game of the season.
Boasting a strong pair of forwards
in Bill Sharman and Abe Androff,
the Troys were once co-favorites
with Stanford to win the Southern
Division crown. But due to a me
diocre pre - conference record in
which they dropped six out of 10
games, Troy has been overlooked
lately.
However, Sam Barry will be cer
tain to have a hust'ing club ready
to face Stanford. In Bill Sharman,
USC has a constant scoring threat.
Sharman whipped in 28 points one
night to beat Utah almost single
handedly.
Abe Androff is also a dangerous
nan around the basket. He can be
deadly on a hot night.
Veteran guard Fred Bertram will
also be around to get in Stanford's
hair. He will be aided by 200-
pound Stan Christie at center, and
Bud Pelka at the other guard spot.
Missing from last year's club are
Alex Hannum, center, and guard
Earl Wallis.
