11 ROSE <i-4 1 - forward K-5 SAWYER 22
Rose has rolled in 71 points in 11 games, is hot and cold, but on a good
night will take a back seat to nobody. Iverson will divide time. Ag
gressive and alert, he is a good passer and shooter. Bruin Sawyer is tall,
gcod on the boards and tipins, and works well with Clutska. He is one
of the three centers converted to another job by mentor Wooden. EDGE:
ROSE.
5 YAKDLEY (5-4' a forward (J-2 CLUTSKA 33
Jumping George is the outstanding man in the PCC according to the
recent all-star selections. He leads Stanford scoring with 138 points, con
t'ols all backboards, and should garner some ail-American rates before
the season is over. Chuck Clutska, pronounced Sa-loos-ka, is a Bruin
three-year letterman, earned all-conference guard spot in '45, but didn't
play first team last season. Coming back into his own this year, he has
led Bruin scoring and has been the main offesnive spark. EDGE: YARD
LEY.
<» STEPLNSON 0-3 center «-4» - KRAUSHAAR 44
Old reliable himself, Steve captains and leads the team from his center
spot. Dangerous at all times, he uses a hook shot and a driving lay-in
that spells nothing but trouble for his opponents. Kraushaar, a transfer
from Compton, is playing his first year with the Bruins. He has worked
well at center and is good on the boards. EDGE: STEPHENSON.
DAVIDSON (J-3 guard 5-11 PEARSON 11
Dave bounced back into the scoring columns with his brilliant 23-point
spree against Michigan recently, and is capable of doing the same to the
Bruins. He is powerful and best in the tough going. He drives and has
plenty of fight. Rates as good as any guaid in the Southern Division.
Pearson, the only man under (5 l'eet among the starting fives, is a clever
p^y-maker, and has a deadly push shot. He is a hustler. EDGE: DAVID
