This year's registration trend
shows more men and fewer women
are attending classes at the Univer
sity than at a comparative time last
year.
Stanford roughs are now on the
heavy end of a 3.2 to 1 ratio as
compared to last year's ratio of 3.1
to 1. An analysis ot these figures
indicates that each man had one
tenth of a woman more at his dis
posal a year ago.
The statistics department predicts
that if the trend continues at the
present rate, one million years from
now there will he 100 003.2 men to
every woman at Stanford.
The margin between total figures
this year and last year, as of yes
terday, is now narrowed to 28; that
is. 7,928 last year to 7,900 this year.
The Registrar reports that, broken
down, the figures are 6,044 men and
1,856 women this year as compared
to 6,002 men and 1,929 women last
year.
