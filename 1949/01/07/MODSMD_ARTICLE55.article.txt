# WRONG OVERCOAT
## 
### 
Someone picked up the wrong tan
overcoat by mistake at Alpha Sig
ma Phi Wednesday. The coat is
identical with his own except that
it is smaller. Identifying marks are
the Desmond label and a Rose Bowl
ticket in the light pocket. The coat
may be exchanged with Bob Olsen
at room 209. Encina.
