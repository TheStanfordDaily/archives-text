# Open Rushing Starts Today For Freshmen
## 
### 
Open legal rushing in Stanford's
fraternities will begin at 5 p.m. to
day, continuing for a two-week pe
riod of informal dinners and meet
ings between fraternity men and
prospective pledges.
Rushing period will end with a
preference dinner on Jan. 21 and
Formal Pledge Day on Jan. 22.
During the rushing period, fra
ternity men and freshmen may
meet anywhere at any time. The
only restriction upon fraternity
men is that they stay out of Encina
after 11 on week nights.
'The administration was doubt
ful about fraternity men entering
the freshman dormitory," said In
terfraternity President Ted LeVino.
"Whether we continue this practice
next year depends upon the beha
vior of Row men scouting."
During this rushing period, men
are invited to join a house and
accept a p'.edge pin. However,
pledges are not binding until for
mal pledge cards are signed with a
fraternity on Jan. 22.
LeVino warned that if a rushee
breaks a pledge after Formal Pledge
Day he loses eligibility for pledg
ing for six months. If a fraternity
breaks the pledge, the rushee may
then join another fraternity the
next day.
