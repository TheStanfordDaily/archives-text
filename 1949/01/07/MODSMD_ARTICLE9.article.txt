moment, company officials ex
pected progress to be made by

All Stanford students living east
of the Sacramento River have been
seeing real weather during the
past two weeks. Some of them

cisco as it beat its way westward
through the 60-miles-per-hour wind

and 40 inches of snow that blan
keted Nebraska Tuesday.
At Grand Island, Neb., the train
gave up the unequal struggle and
stopped. It's still there. Hiries
quoted the company as saying that
it will be broken down and re
turned to Chicago for another try.
Hines and Johnson sat on the
train for 26 hours waiting for some
thing to happen. Also on the train
were several Eastern coaches on
their way to the San Francisco NC
-2A conference.
Wednesday Hines, Johnson, and
other passengers took a bus out of
Grand Island for Omaha, where
they chartered a plane for the coast.
The bus trip was marred by only
one incident. Johnson remembered
his suitcase two miles out of town
•md had to walk b»ck for it and
take a later bus. The hike, he said,
was a mighty chilly one.

nainless one, and the >:tu''enls ar
