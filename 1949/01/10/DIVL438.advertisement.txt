Products of the laboratory
are saving time, toil, money
for the American farmer
Through chemistry, farmers are gain
ing control over many of nature's un
certainties. Costly losses of crops and
livestock are being curtailed or pre
vented. "Efficiency is increasing. New
applications of chemistry to agricul
ture are becoming more important
than ever as demands for more pro
duction increase.
Today, new organic insecticides
and fungicides help control insects,
plant diseases and blights that threat
en crops. Seed disinfectants and pro
tectants help guarantee bountiful
harvests by protecting crops in the
critical period after planting. Plant
hormones hold fruit on trees until
fully ready for picking.
Days of labor saved
Du Pont weed killers and explosives
accomplish in minutes tasks that
used to take hours or days of back
breaking labor. With 2,4-D farmers
can kill weeds without harming cer
tain crops. Dynamite removes
stumps, digs ditches for draining and
irrigation, and loosens the soil to
forestall erosion.
New fertilizer formulations meet
the changing nutritional require
ments of plants during the growing
season. Thus the farmer has better
control over crop development, and
he can utilize his materials, labor and

Feed compounds, developed by

Turning ideas into products
Achievements such as these are the
result of Du Pout's team research.
An idea may start with one or two
individuals. But many specialists
chemists, physicists, biologists, plant
pathologists, and entomologists
must contribute their skills before a
new product is ready for market.
Normally, engineers—chemical, me
chanical, civil, and electrical de
velop the commercial processes and
plants for making the finished prod
ucts.
The new Du Pont employee,
whether he holds a bachelor's, mas

this cooperative effort. Yet the im
mediate group with which he is asso
ciated is small and congenial, offering
him every opportunity to display
individual talent and capabilities.
