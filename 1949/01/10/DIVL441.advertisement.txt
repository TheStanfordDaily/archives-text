J. Paul Slieedv* Svilelied to Wildroot (.ream-Oil
Because He Flunked The Fiiijjer-.Nail Tesl
TH £ hair that bothered this tortoise didn't run him a race, as
they "tort-us" back in school. His hair just kept getting in
his eyes! Bring naturally slow, it took some time for him to
try the Finger-Nail Test. But. when he did, brother, did lie
move fast for a bottle of Wildroot Cream-Oil and look at him
now! No more dryness and loose, ugly dandruff! Wildroot
Cream-Oil keeps his hair well groomed all day long. — >.
What non-alcoholic Wildroot Cn.un-Oil containing Lanolin mmm** !
did for Shecdy, it can do for you. So a bottle or tube today BfiSJgS ,
at the nearest drug or toilet goods counter. And have your !
barber give you professional applications. You'll like what ■ ,1
Wildroot Cream Oil does for your hair .so mock this turtle ,! "il,"',,
and start using it today. _ m.. I
