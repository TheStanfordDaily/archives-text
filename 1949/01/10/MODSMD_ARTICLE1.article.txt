# L.A. Gets Snow; Midwest Shivers; City of S.F.' Limps In—5 Days Late
## 
### SANDY MEITUS 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9 (AP)—lt snowed today
in Los Angeles. Want- to-hear it again, Florida?
It snowed today in Los Angeles.
In most places it melted as it fell, but never
theless, it was snow. The seashore got it, too.

At Palos Verdes, the fall lasted for
20 minutes. Redondo Beach got
some, too.
In the Windsor Hills section of
Los Angeles, a resident said he
packed a "real snowball."
Meanwhile, a new cold wave
struck the blizzard-wracked Rocky
Mountain area while an intense
storm in the Midwest continued un
abated.
Northern and Central California
suffered under freezing tempera
tures, and northern Illinois and In
diana were alerted for sleet and
freezing rain.
The new cold wave plunged tem
peratures as low as 42 below zero
at West Yellowstone, Mont., already
crippled by 37 inches of snow.
Strong winds piled huge snowdrifts
in eastern Montana, and blizzard
conditions were reported at Laramie,
Wyo.

Approximately 28 Stanford students plus two
faculty members arrived on the City of San
Francisco yesterday afternoon at 5:20 p.m., ex
actly one week after they left Chicago. Five
Staniordites and Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, a mem-

ber of the Board of Trustees, flew
out of Denver on Friday night and
arrived in San Francisco Saturday
morning.
The first irregular stop on the long
journey was Kimball, Neb., where
the train was stranded for four days
because of the blizzard which not
only put the crack streamliner, City
of San Francisco, completely out of
commission, but also prevented
clearance of tracks from Kimball to
Cheyenne.
Most of the Stanford students
spent their four days at the Wheat
Growers' Hotel in Kimball where
some were able to obtain hotel
rooms at night. However, most slept
on the floor, on tables, chairs, or
merely sat up all night. During the
time they spent there, the Stanford
ites, along with the rest of the 271
passengers on the train, amused
themselves by playing cards, danc
ing, knitting, word games, movies,
etc.
Leaves Kimball
Thursday night the City of San
Francisco pulled out of Kimball and
headed East to avoid the snow-piled
track between Kimball. Cheyenne,
and Laramie. The train took 24
hours to get from Kimball to Denver.
When the passengers boarded the
train Thursday night they discov
ered a lack of water, plumbing fa
cilities, plus a shortage of food, Fri
day morning the diner ran out of
coffee, milk, and resorted to serving
eggs. In fact, an enterprising citi
zen of Harden, Colo., was selling pop,
potato chips, cookies, and tomato
juice to the passengers on the train.
Passengers Depart
In La Salle, Colo., some passen
gers headed for conventions in San
Francisco, hired cars to take them to
Denver about 5 Friday afternoon.
The 271 passengers of the City of
San Francisco were forced to spen
about seven hours, from 5 p.m. to 1
I a.m., in or about the Union Station
in Denver.

Field at Denver, Colo., took this aerial view of a
snowbound Union Pacific train at Hillsdale, Wyo., as
needed supplies were dropped from an air force
C-47 plane. The two locomotives and snowplow in

the upper part of the view reached Hillsdale, 20
miles East of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital, after
bucking through 20-foot snowdrifts on the railroad's
mainline to reach the stranded passenger train.

bucking through 20-foot snowdrifts on the railroad's
mainline to reach the stranded passenger train.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9 (AP)—lt snowed today
in Los Angeles. Want- to-hear it again, Florida?
It snowed today in Los Angeles.
In most places it melted as it fell, but never
theless, it was snow. The seashore got it, too.

At Palos Verdes, the fall lasted for
20 minutes. Redondo Beach got
some, too.
In the Windsor Hills section of
Los Angeles, a resident said he
packed a "real snowball."
Meanwhile, a new cold wave
struck the blizzard-wracked Rocky
Mountain area while an intense
storm in the Midwest continued un
abated.
Northern and Central California
suffered under freezing tempera
tures, and northern Illinois and In
diana were alerted for sleet and
freezing rain.
The new cold wave plunged tem
peratures as low as 42 below zero
at West Yellowstone, Mont., already
crippled by 37 inches of snow.
Strong winds piled huge snowdrifts
in eastern Montana, and blizzard
conditions were reported at Laramie,
Wyo.

Approximately 28 Stanford students plus two
faculty members arrived on the City of San
Francisco yesterday afternoon at 5:20 p.m., ex
actly one week after they left Chicago. Five
Staniordites and Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, a mem-

ber of the Board of Trustees, flew
out of Denver on Friday night and
arrived in San Francisco Saturday
morning.
The first irregular stop on the long
journey was Kimball, Neb., where
the train was stranded for four days
because of the blizzard which not
only put the crack streamliner, City
of San Francisco, completely out of
commission, but also prevented
clearance of tracks from Kimball to
Cheyenne.
Most of the Stanford students
spent their four days at the Wheat
Growers' Hotel in Kimball where
some were able to obtain hotel
rooms at night. However, most slept
on the floor, on tables, chairs, or
merely sat up all night. During the
time they spent there, the Stanford
ites, along with the rest of the 271
passengers on the train, amused
themselves by playing cards, danc
ing, knitting, word games, movies,
etc.
