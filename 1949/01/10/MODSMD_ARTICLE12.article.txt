# Honor Code System Now Traditional Since Early Students Won Privilege
## Code Initiated By Law School 
### JACK LITTLE 
(Ed. Note: This is the first of
a series of three articles on the
Honor Code.)
"No unpermitted aid given or re
ceived."
Sound familiar? It's printed on
the cover of every examination book
you've used, with a space for your
signature. Signing your name there
gets to be a habit .... you may
forget that it's a privilege.
Your signature after that state
ment is the basis of the Honor Code
â€”a privilege you can enjoy because
a lot of students believed an honor
system would work at Stanford and
fought for their belief. It was a 30-
year fight.
No Student Government
For many years after the founding
of the University in 1891, student
government was non-existent. Stu
dent affairs were administered by
committees appointed from the fac
ulty.
In 1904 students and faculty mem
bers, feeling the University's prac
tice of procotring examinations was
an affront to student integrity, pro
posed an honor system. It was re
jected for one reason .... there
was honor, but no system. Both
factions agreed that an honor code
would be workable only under stu
dent government, and the adminis
tration still opposed student govern
ment.
Limited By Faculty
Then, in 1912, the faculty cau
tiously offered a limited form of stu
dent government. The student body
was far from satisfied with the plan,
but fearing a withdrawal of the offer,
accepted it on the grounds that a
little gain is better than none.
The new student government re
mained under the watchful scrutiny
of faculty committees, and in 1915
University President Branner ap
pointed certain professors to act as
special watchdogs on the student
committees. ,

In the same year Chancellor David
Starr Jordan declared:
"So far as I have teen able to
watch the working of student con
trol it has been reasonably satis
factory. The chief weakness arises
from lack of interest."
Law School Code
Dr. Jordan's statement stimulated
an increase in the demands for an
honor system. Such a system had
been adopted by the Law School and
had proven successful. Following
this lead, other departments bor
rowed, in various guises, the Law
School's code.


IN SIGNING HIS NAME to the Honor Code, a Stanford student upholds
one of the school's longest and most respected traditions. Thirty years of
revamping the system has produced the code which is in effect today.
