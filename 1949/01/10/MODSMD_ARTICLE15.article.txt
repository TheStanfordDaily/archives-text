# Houses Pull New Faux Pas in '49 Frosh-Rowmen Clash
## 
### AL BERRY 
Boots, boots, boots were marching up and down again last
veek as the Row open houses gave vent to the greatest Frosh
lowmen clash since the '47 Pdjamarino.
As usual the performance was good, but not always according
o the script. It was during these "ad-libbed" parts that the "Saga

>t the Open Houses" reached its H
:enith.
Confused Frosh (jets Wrong House
First there was the pink
;erubbcd freshman who stepped
mto the Alpha Delts* living room
ind politely inquired of one of the
rougher brothers, "Is this the Kap
pa Sig house?"
At the Sigma Chi house, one of
the brothers was conducting a pair
)f awe-struck frosh on the 90-cent
tour of the house. He took them
into a room on the third deck,
walked over to one of the room's
double windows, lilted the shade,
and with his back to the window
announced, "And here we have an
excellent view of Russell House
next door."
Note the Lusty View
The frosh froze and stared out
the window. The brother turned,
and sure enough — much to his
amazement — there was a sweet
young Russellite .just pulling her
whatehamaeallit on.
The brother — with remarkable
presence of mind—pulled down the
shade and in a bored voice re
marked to a brother who had just
entered, "Quick, Pee - Wee, the
pledge pin!"
Multicolored John
At one palatial mansion on the
Lower Row —the Phi Delt house to
be exact —the focal point of interest
was a "head" on the second floor.
This room—once a plain everyday
lavatory —is now a monument to
Phi Delta Thota. It was redecorated
in five delicious shades of green
dui ing Christmas vacation by one
of the boys who had just finished
senior seminar at Belt's.
The Sigma Nu's claim that one
i ushee — y professor's son — walked
into one room, looked around,
whipped out his check book, and
offered to have it redecorated as
soon as he was pledged. The Sigma
Nu's are currently reported to be
holding out for a now wing.
The Alpha Sigs. finally deciding
to make a big impression on the
riishees. spent nearly a week con
structing a dark-room in the base
mi nt. The rushees got there about
the same time that the plumbing in
Ihe faulty University lines backed
up and flooded the place—rushees
and all —under a foot of water.
Big Wheels Memorized
Then there is the frosh who wan
dered around from house to house,
counting on his fingers and mur
muring over and over again. '"Em
ery Mitchell is a Fiii, Marty An
derson is a Beta, Mickey Titus is a
Phi Psi, Tom Self is an Alpha Sig."
About this time he stopped, looked
a hospitable Delt in the eye, and
asked, "Who the devil is Tom
Self?"
Dispatches fai'ed to state how anil
if the rushin« at
the house with the white lion in
front.
