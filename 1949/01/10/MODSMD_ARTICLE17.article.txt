# Climax Weakens Robinson Movie
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
The supernatural is hard to cap
lure on celluloid. Predictions of the
future seem contrived and affected
on film; "everyone knows it couldn't
possibly happen."
That "Night Has a Thousand
Eyes." now playing at the Varsity
seems perfectly plausible for all but
15 minutes of its running time, is a
credit to its editing, direction, and
shooting script.
The tense story of a man who can
foretell the future and the ruinous
effects of this gift on his life is ab
sorbing until a Hollywood touch
turns the ending into a neat, un
convincing puzzle solution, replete
with odious, unbelievable villains
and threatening, gloved hands.
Edward G. Robinson as the fake
mind-reader, who discovers his
powers are real, proves himself a
competent actor; John Lund anil
Gail Russell, as young lovers, drift
aimlessly through the film. Miss
Russell looks too neurotic, even
when she is not threatened by
death, to be believable. Bill Dema
rest, who rarely turns in a bad per
formance, provides expert comedy
relief.
A crushed flower—a broken vase
—a sudden wind—a lion's paw—the
events which circle closer and closer
to a taut climax. But the spell is
dissolved in a morass of Hollywood
cliches—the gloved hand, the omi
nous clock, the "most innocent
character" villian for whom the
audience is not prepared.
Despite the disappointment of its
ending "Night Has a Thousand Eyes"
is an entertaining evening. After all
it's a comfort to know .something's
more frightening than finals.
