# Frosh May Ask IFC's Rush Help
## 
### 
Any freshman who is interested in
a fraternity to which he has not
been invited may give his name to
Interfraternity Council, Ted LeVino,
IFC president, announced yesterday.
The council will transfer the infor
mation to the house mentioned.
To facilitate this operation LeVino
asked freshmen to turn in such in
formation to their Encina sponsors
who will relay it to the council.
The plan, which was also enacted
last year, helps both fraternities and
the rushees, LeVino said. Fraterni
ties are given an idea of some men
interested in them, and rushees are
aided in so far as they will know
definitely, after submitting their
preferences, whether or not the fra
ternity is interested in them,
LeVino emphasized the point that
such a program does not guarantee
the rushee an invitation to the fra
ternity. It merely serves to clarify
the relationship between the two, he
said.
The interfraternity president
urged all freshmen to turn in their
preference information as early as
possible. Fraternity rushing ends
