## Monday Musings 
### 
This Monday starts the second week of school for most of us,
hut the first for the three dozen or so students who were stranded
by snow storms. Welcome back! Your stories should provide
hot bull sessions for a month.

Monday six weeks from now should be a holiday. But it isn't.
For some unexplained reason it is planned to have classes on
-Monday, Feb. 21. Since the date comes between two holidays,
Sunday and Washington's birthday, there seems little point in
Eiot making the holiday a four-day one. Little will be accom
plished in the academic line since few people will attend classes.
On the other hand, an uninterrupted four-day vacation (coming
three weeks before finals) would be a boon to students needing
the rest or time to catch up.

NSA has an interesting new subcommission on academic free
dom. The project is a worthy one and will be worthwhile if it
is handled properly without bias or unnecessary passion. One
University of California girl did a survey last year on the subject,
but her report was so prejudiced and full of inaccuracies that
her valid work—and that of others —was largely negated.

It hurts but it's true: there are a number of lady purse lifters at
Stanford. There was a rash of complaints last year at various
girls' houses. The resulting unpleasantness at a woman's resi
dence cannot be imagined. But the newest wrinkle, which oc
curred Friday night, is hardly less pleasant. Someone stole
money from several girls' purses in the lady's room at a fra
ternity party.

Monday Morning Gripes: People who hold nine seats at the
"basketball games. People who engage in unnecessary booing at
basketball games. Still no change in the post office lines. There
are still twice as many people in the N-Z line as the A-M line
lor the simple reason that there are twice as many people with
names starting N-Z. Dinah's didn't ring the bell Saturday night.
