Don't forget, gal, it's now '49—the year of the gold rush! We should,
have learned by now that the best things in life are free only to those
who can afford them.
Change is the spice of life. But it's like a waiter told me New Year's
Eve, "There's going to be a lot of changes. And it's all going to be short."
Speaking of changes, my girl says she's going to start the New Year out
with a new personality. She's going to change her makeup and use a
darker nailpolish and a new hairdo and try a new perfume. It sure is
degenerating. All a man can do when he gets tired of looking at himself
is get his shoes shined.
And New Year's resolutions do little if any good in making changes.
So this year I steadfastly resolved not to make any resolutions. I have a
terrible conscience anyhow. It doesn't keep me from doing things—just
from enjoying them.
Auld Lang Syne has become America's anthem of the New Year. The
title is a Scottish phrase literally meaning "old long since," or times long
past.
Sometimes it seems that that same "old long since" was better than
the present or prospects for the future. For example, New Year's calling
is a thing of the past. I mean the old procedure where a group of young
men could ring the bell of any house in any neighborhood in any city and
be royally welcomed. Included in the receiving line was usually a bevy
of friendly beauties and no introductions were necessary.
Even the mistletoe has almost lost its significance. A modern gal could
wear a mistletoe hat in downtown traffic nowadays and be safe. Men
might think thoughts, but that is about as far as progi'ess would progress.
It reminds me of a joke. The maid was asked if . she had hung up any
-mistletoe this Christmas. "Not me," she replied, "I got too much pride
to advertise for the ordinary courtesies a lady has a right to expect." Is
that a joke? Not any more it isn't.
Sorta glad this following custom has been lost, though. When pins were
introduced at the beginning of the 16th century they were made of silver
and were quite a luxury. A wealthy husband pleased his wife by giving
her the money to buy her own pins. And therein evolved the title "pin
money." Man hasn't been free since.
I think New Year's Eve will outlast me. Each year I toot myself into a
pop-eyed stupor and go- home and sleep until the first headache after
the third Monday in January. But I suppose you can get used to the
stuff. James C. Turner, whoever he is, (he works for the Atlanta Water
Department) hasn't had a drink of water in 27 years. Says he gave it
up for his health.
Yet there is one drink that I'd like to try. It's called a Harry Truman
ccctail is composed of a mixture of sloe gin, Scotch, creme de menthe,
and mui kwai lu whiskey (Chinese). The sign on the Chinese cafe in New
York where it is featured promises "One drink and you take on the
whole country."
But all I have to say is that I'm glad I'm not in Lhasa, Tibet. New
Year's Day there lasts six days. I'm afraid I couldn't stand the strain.
