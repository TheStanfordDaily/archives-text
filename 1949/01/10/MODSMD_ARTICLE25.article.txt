# Fraternities Discuss Race Discrimination
## 
### 
Consideration of the question of
what to do in regard to racial dis
crimination among college fraterni
ties was postponed for one year by
the National Interfraternity Con
ference at its 40th annual session
held at the Hotel Commodore, New
York City, Nov. 26-27.
The National Undergraduate In
terfraternity Council, meeting at
the same time, recommended that
a committee be appointed to study
"the changing conditions concern
ing fraternity membership." These
resolutions followed spirited dis
cussion in regard to the right of
fraternities to restrict membership
on the basis of race, creed, or color.
Fraternity Rights
The resolution referred to the 58
member fraternities for study pre
liminary to decision next year as
serts the right of a fraternity to se
lect its own members free from any
domination or pressure on the part
of an educational institution, mak
ing whatever restrictions it sees fit,
including religious, racial, or na
tionality qualifications. In cases not
governed by national restrictions or
by custom or tradition binding upon
the chapter, the conference, accord
ing to the resolution, would recog
nize the right of the chapter mem
ber to vote upon prospective mem
bers as he sees fit.
The resolution continues, "The
conference, however, believes that
the fraternity system will flourish
better if the character and person
ality of the individual are regarded
as paramount, rather than his race,
color, religion, or nationality."
Discussion of membership restric
tions was livliest in the undergrad
uate session, attended by 188 dele
gates and alternates from more than
60 councils from every section of
the country. A number of votes
were taken to show the attitude of
the various councils in regard to
membership restrictions. Nineteen
councils were recorded as favoring
complete autonomy; 36 felt that na
tional fraternity regulations should
be followed; 6 did not vote.
Discrimination
On the question, "Should frater
nities that have discriminatory
clauses in their constitution in
regard to color eliminate such
clauses?" 12 voted yes, 25 no, 18
abstained. Only four felt that fra
ternities which limit their member
ship to a certain religious faith
should be eliminated.
Other resolutions adopted by the
undergraduates called for the - se
lection of representatives to their
councils with power to act; a sur
vey of interfraternity councils and
college administrators as to the
needs for more fraternity chapters
on their respective campuses; the
location of the annual National In
terfraternity Conference sessions in
a city nearer the geographical cen
ter of the United States; the organi
zation of panel discussions to con
sider the needs of interfraternity
councils; the continuance of the
National Undergraduate Award
with citations to local councils mer
iting recognition; the investigation
by each local interfraternity coun
cil as to the feasibility of establish
ing Greek Week on its campus; the
organization of regional groups to
meet two weeks before the annual
session of the NIC for the discus
sion of problems peculiar to the re
gion and the selection of a repre
sentative who Avould meet with
other representatives the night be
fore the annual meeting to elect
from their group the chairman of
the undergraduate conference.
Council Award
The impressive Undergraduate
Council Award was presented to
the Interfraternity Council of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy as the undergraduate unit
which developed the most construc
tive program in interfraternity ac
tivities the past year. This was the
first award made since the start of
World War 11.
The winning program included
such projects as the awarding of
scholarship plaques to chapters with
high scholastic records; the estab
lishment of a central office, the
publication of a monthly newspa

per, a song contest, the planning of
a building project to provide houses
for chapters, and the reorganization
of programs dealing with social pol
icies, expansion, and rushing.
Other subjects discussed by the
undergraduates included the im
provement of scholarship, the men
ace of Hell Week and the substitu
tion of a constructive Greek Week
program for it, the necessity of
controlling drinking among college
students and the enforcement of
rules against having liquor on fra
ternity premises, the establishment
of better public relations, and the
necessity of reducing the size of
chapters to a normal membership,
not exceeding sixty.

Council Award
The impressive Undergraduate
Council Award was presented to
the Interfraternity Council of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy as the undergraduate unit
which developed the most construc
tive program in interfraternity ac
tivities the past year. This was the
first award made since the start of
World War 11.
The winning program included
such projects as the awarding of
scholarship plaques to chapters with
high scholastic records; the estab
lishment of a central office, the
publication of a monthly newspa

per, a song contest, the planning of
a building project to provide houses
for chapters, and the reorganization
of programs dealing with social pol
icies, expansion, and rushing.
Other subjects discussed by the
undergraduates included the im
provement of scholarship, the men
ace of Hell Week and the substitu
tion of a constructive Greek Week
program for it, the necessity of
controlling drinking among college
students and the enforcement of
rules against having liquor on fra
ternity premises, the establishment
of better public relations, and the
necessity of reducing the size of
chapters to a normal membership,
not exceeding sixty.
Consideration of the question of
what to do in regard to racial dis
crimination among college fraterni
ties was postponed for one year by
the National Interfraternity Con
ference at its 40th annual session
held at the Hotel Commodore, New
York City, Nov. 26-27.
The National Undergraduate In
terfraternity Council, meeting at
the same time, recommended that
a committee be appointed to study
"the changing conditions concern
ing fraternity membership." These
resolutions followed spirited dis
cussion in regard to the right of
fraternities to restrict membership
on the basis of race, creed, or color.
Fraternity Rights
The resolution referred to the 58
member fraternities for study pre
liminary to decision next year as
serts the right of a fraternity to se
lect its own members free from any
domination or pressure on the part
of an educational institution, mak
ing whatever restrictions it sees fit,
including religious, racial, or na
tionality qualifications. In cases not
governed by national restrictions or
by custom or tradition binding upon
the chapter, the conference, accord
ing to the resolution, would recog
nize the right of the chapter mem
ber to vote upon prospective mem
bers as he sees fit.
The resolution continues, "The
conference, however, believes that
the fraternity system will flourish
better if the character and person
ality of the individual are regarded
as paramount, rather than his race,
color, religion, or nationality."
Discussion of membership restric
tions was livliest in the undergrad
uate session, attended by 188 dele
gates and alternates from more than
60 councils from every section of
the country. A number of votes
were taken to show the attitude of
the various councils in regard to
membership restrictions. Nineteen
councils were recorded as favoring
complete autonomy; 36 felt that na

tive program in interfraternity ac
tivities the past year. This was the
first award made since the start of
World War 11.
The winning program included
such projects as the awarding of
scholarship plaques to chapters with
high scholastic records; the estab
lishment of a central office, the

necessity of reducing the size of
chapters to a normal membership,
not exceeding sixty.
Consideration of the question of
what to do in regard to racial dis
crimination among college fraterni
ties was postponed for one year by
the National Interfraternity Con
ference at its 40th annual session
held at the Hotel Commodore, New
York City, Nov. 26-27.
The National Undergraduate In
terfraternity Council, meeting at
the same time, recommended that
a committee be appointed to study
"the changing conditions concern
ing fraternity membership." These
resolutions followed spirited dis
cussion in regard to the right of
fraternities to restrict membership
on the basis of race, creed, or color.
Fraternity Rights
The resolution referred to the 58
member fraternities for study pre
liminary to decision next year as
serts the right of a fraternity to se
lect its own members free from any
domination or pressure on the part
of an educational institution, mak
ing whatever restrictions it sees fit,
including religious, racial, or na
tionality qualifications. In cases not
governed by national restrictions or
by custom or tradition binding upon
the chapter, the conference, accord
ing to the resolution, would recog
nize the right of the chapter mem
ber to vote upon prospective mem
bers as he sees fit.
The resolution continues, "The
conference, however, believes that
the fraternity system will flourish
better if the character and person
ality of the individual are regarded
as paramount, rather than his race,
color, religion, or nationality."
Discussion of membership restric
tions was livliest in the undergrad
uate session, attended by 188 dele
gates and alternates from more than
60 councils from every section of
the country. A number of votes
were taken to show the attitude of
the various councils in regard to
membership restrictions. Nineteen
councils were recorded as favoring
complete autonomy; 36 felt that na
tional fraternity regulations should
be followed; 6 did not vote.
Discrimination
On the question, "Should frater
nities that have discriminatory
clauses in their constitution in
regard to color eliminate such
clauses?" 12 voted yes, 25 no, 18
abstained. Only four felt that fra
ternities which limit their member
ship to a certain religious faith
should be eliminated.
Other resolutions adopted by the
undergraduates called for the - se
lection of representatives to their
councils with power to act; a sur
vey of interfraternity councils and
college administrators as to the
needs for more fraternity chapters
on their respective campuses; the
location of the annual National In
terfraternity Conference sessions in
a city nearer the geographical cen
ter of the United States; the organi
zation of panel discussions to con
sider the needs of interfraternity
councils; the continuance of the
National Undergraduate Award
with citations to local councils mer
iting recognition; the investigation
by each local interfraternity coun
cil as to the feasibility of establish
ing Greek Week on its campus; the
organization of regional groups to
meet two weeks before the annual
session of the NIC for the discus
sion of problems peculiar to the re
gion and the selection of a repre
sentative who Avould meet with
other representatives the night be
fore the annual meeting to elect
from their group the chairman of
the undergraduate conference.
