Feudin'
WASHINGTON Arrangements
for President Truman's inaugura
tion and the festivities connected
with it are touching off a series of
feuds among prominent persons, es
pecially those in the entertainment
world.
Backstage pushing and shoving
for invitations to the inaugural ball
and for prominent places on the
gala program of entertainment the
night before is terrific. (Both these
functions are unofficial.)
A member of the inaugural com
mittee says one orchestra leader
enlisted the backing of a dozen Sen
ators and Representatives "and
practically every member of the
cabinet except Marshall" but still
couldn't wangle a spot for himself
on the program.
The Hollywood invitation list,
largely in the hands of actor Mel
vyn Douglas, husband of Rep. Helen
Gahagan Douglas (D., Calif.), is
fairly broad, this committeeman
said, "and even includes some Re
publicans."
But the shrieks of those left off
can be heard all the way from Sun
set Boulevard to Pennsylvania
Avenue.

Building Outlook

NEW YORK—Signs of a slower
year in real estate and building are
accumulating.
The Prudential Insurance Co. has
announced it will build no more
low - rental housing because of
building costs.
Projects planned by some other
insurance companies and savings
banks have been postponed for the
same reason.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics
and the Department of Commerce
predict a general drop of four to
five per cent in volume.
A reduction in residential values
to about 40 per cent above pre-war
is predicted in the current issue of
the '"Review" of the Society of
Residential Appraisers.

Recession

WASHINGTON—Are we entering
a recession? That depends on what
you meap by recession.
The word may mean:
1. A mere receding of business
activity from a higher level.
2. A bad slump, somewhat less
than a depression but nevertheless
bringing mass unemployment and
so forth.
Under the first meaning, yes, the
U.S. is experiencing a recession.
Prices and fobs have apparently
turned slightly downward although
they are still sky-high compared to
levels for years past.
But in the sinister meaning of a
half-grown depression, the country
is not entering a recession in the
opinion of government officials and
most economists. They say business
activity is likely to stay at very
high levels throughout 1949.

Reciprocal Trade

WASHINGTON—It looks like one
of the first major acts of the new
Congress will be to erase the law,
passed by* the Republican-controlled
80th Congress, that the Administra
tion contends has "hamstrung" the
Reciprocal Trade Law.
Under the Reciprocal Trade Act
adopted in 1935 the Secretary of

Slate, under the President's super
vision, could reduce tariffs against
other nations that lowered their
own trade barriers.
The 80th Congress continued the
act to July 1, 1949, but required
that if the Federal Tariff Commis
sion advised against a certain re
duction, and the President decided
to put it into effect anyway, he
would have to inform Congress
why.

Fraternizing

BERLIN Col. Frank Howley,
American sector commandant, is
sued his ban on fraternizing with
Russians after one of his subordi
nates took a Soviet officer home for
Christmas dinner.
Generally speaking, the order has
no practical effect because the Rus
sians almost never fratexnize any
way.

Tammany HaJ

NEW YORK—In an attempt to
regain power, Tammany Hall is
modernizing what it acknowledges
is fundamentally the -old Thanks
giving party and Christmas basket.
It is hiring a paid social worker
to take charge of the "helping hand"
activity that always made voter
friends for the Manhattan Demo
cratic organization.

Income Taxes

WASHINGTON—There's no point
in delaying your 1948 income tax
rgjturn with the idea that tax rates
may be changed—in fact, most in
come taxpayers will be better off
if they make their returns right
away. (They're not actually due
until March 15.)
Four out of five income taxpayers
will get refunds on 1948 overpay
ments. The government operates on
a "'first come, first served" basis in
making refunds.
Even if rates are changed, taxes
on 1948 income won't be affected.

Palestine

LONDON Some diplomats here
see a possible change in Britain's
Palestine policy in the transfer of
Palestine expert Harold Beeley from,
a Foreign Office desk to the post
of counselor to the British embassy
at Copenhagen, Denmark.
Beeley has been accused by some
newspapers of being strongly pro-
Arab.

Wise Cracks

WASHlNGTON—Commanders of
the Berlin airlift figue a little joke
now and then will help pilots
through the frequent pea-soup fog,
so they have relaxed customary
military radio discipline.
Here's a story just brought back
from Berlin:
The control tower operator noted
that one plane was a minute ahead
of the tight three-minute schedule.
He told the pilot to "do a three
sixty and lose a minute." (He
meant to make a full circle of 360
degrees.)
"I can't do a three-sixty in less
than two minutes," the pilot re
plied. At which another pilot cut in:
"Do a one-eighty (half - circle)
and back in!"

Nazi Secrets

LONDON—The first two volumes
of German Foreign Office docu
ments captured by the Allies are to
be published in the spring. The
documents relate to the Third
Reich's international dealings up
to 1939.

Draft Halt

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (/P). —The
National Council Against Conscrip
tion saicl today a two-month sus
pension of draft calls is "final proof"
that selective service and universal
military training are not necessary.
Council Chairman Alonzo Myers
said in a statement that since the
Navy and Air Force have not used
the draft, '"The Army alone is re
sponsible for wasting this year $27,
476,700 for selective service ma
chinery."
