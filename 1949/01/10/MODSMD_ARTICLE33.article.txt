The Village is coming of age.
With Stern Hall the only dormi
tory on campus in an actual con
struction stage, it looks as if the
Village is no longer interim hous
ing.
Eugene Dils. resident counselor at
the Village, explains that the for
mer hospital was once a frantic ef
fort to find beds and study room
for returning GI students, but now
that these men are being graduated
their places are being taken by
more and more non-veterans.
"'We may as well get over the
idea that the Village is temporary
housing," Dils said. "It may even
he permanent, if you want to call
five to ten years permanent.
"The problem now is to provide a
richer living environment for the
men living there, as it appears that
there is no chance for the campus
to absorb more than a fraction of
Village residents."
"We can do this partly by pro
viding more opportunities for par
ticipation in campus activities," Dils
said. "Doug Noteware and his Stu
dent Activities Center Committee
will serve to promote the social,
recreational, cultural, and religious
programs in the Village."
The committee is also sponsoring
a booster group, under Bill Davis,
president of the Village Council.
One function of the committee wil!
be an effort to extend the social
program there so that Village men
will have more opportunity to be
come acquainted with Stanford co
eds.
Dils contends that the Village
must develop some sort of esprit
de corps, instead of the current
feeling that they are putting up
with "emergency" housing.
"We must take the offensive and
make the most of the Village, now
that we are here." Dils added.
