# Bernie Mastersonâ€”'Albert Is World's Smartest Quarterback'
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
"Frankie Albert isn't the best
passer in the world, and he isn't the
best runner; but he's definitely the
best quarterback in organized foot
ball today."
So says Bernie Masterson, former
Nebraska and Chicago Bear great,
BOW in the city to attend the con
vention of coaches there.
Masterson master - minded the
Cornhuskers from 1931 to 1933, then
took over the T-formation quar
terback lot for the Chicago Bears
from 1934 to 1940.
At that time, the Bears were the
only team in the country that used
the so-called "Model T"; and when
Clark Shaughnessy decided to in
stall the T at Stanford in 1940, he
called Masterson out to Palo Alto
to whisper a few words of advice
into the ears of his prospective
quarterbacks.
Albert was just coming into his
own at the Farm at that time, and
Masterson claims the credit for
leaching Frankie the fundamentals
of T - formation quarterbacking.
"Frankie was always just a little
bit smarter than the next guy," Ber
nie recalls. "He's at least two plays
ahead of of anyone else."
A roommate of Marchie Schwartz

during his short stay at Stanford,
Mastex-son has high hopes for Mar
chie's success at the Farm. "Mar
chie's team this year was poten
tially a great one, and with a little
luck he should go places next sea
son," Beimie commented.
