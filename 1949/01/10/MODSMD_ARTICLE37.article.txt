# JV Cage Squad Blasts Sailors; Edges By Frosh
## 
### 
In what was generously adver
tised as a basketball contest, the
Stanford Braves scalped the Moffett
Field Sailors, 89-49, Saturday af
ternoon at the Pavilion. In remark
able contrast to the sound trounc
ing inflicted on the gobs was the
exciting 53-48 decision the Braves
eked out over an inspired frosh five
Friday night.
The Braves capitalized on a fast
break that completely disorganized
the naval ranks. Dick Shutte and
Pete Layman garnered 14 points
apiece as Braves high men, al
though neither played more than
half a game.
Braves, Frosh Stage Thriller
The Brave-frosh tilt, already be
coming one of those Farm classics,
was a far different story. Despite
the fact that this was their third
staight defeat from the older, taller,
and more experienced Braves, the
Burnettitten look better with each
outing.
The score was knotted five tirries
throughout the contest and there
were never more than seven points
separating the teams. The frosh had
a 24-22 lead at half time, mainly
due to the dead-eye efforts of little
Ronnie Garver and some- fine woidc
from the frosh subs in the last four
minutes of the opening half. It was
the first time Coach Bob Burnett
showed a little faith in his reserves
and they justified his hunch by en
tering, platoon style, one basket be
hind and closing the half with a
two-point margin in their favor.
Final Half Play Rough
The final half marked some
rough - and - ready pile - ups, a so
prano whistle by the lone referee
who was sadly overworked and
often incapable of getting into the
correct position to make down
court calls, and a grim determina
tion by Jim Walsh and Jim Pollock
to out-bully the grid tactics of the
Braves. However, the Braves broke
the deadlock with two fouls shots
and Atcheson's brace of bucket
shots with seven and a half minutes
remaining, and never relinquished
the lead again. Gay Bryan led the
victors with 10 points while Walsh
notched 13 and Garver 11 for the
vanquished.
