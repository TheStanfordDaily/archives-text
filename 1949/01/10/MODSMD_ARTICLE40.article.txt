# Indians Split PCC Basketball Openers
## Rose Ineligible; Yardley Hurt; Trojan Basketball Jinx Holds Card Surge Buries Westwood Bruins 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's basketball team
won its Southern Division
opener and eleventh victory in
twelve starts Friday night by
downing UCLA's ice-cold
Bruins, 61 to 52, in the Pavilion.
overflow home crowd watched
tlfe Indians take the floor minus the
services of Bill Rose, starting left
forward, who was declared ineli
gible at the last minute due to an
"academic condition."
Rose, who was the team's third
highest scorer, will remain until the
condition is removed by passing a
test. It is hoped that he will be
ready to play against California next
weekend.
Stanford's other forward, high
scoring George Yardley, aggravated
an old knee injury in the final
minutes of the UCLA game, and al
though he saw considerable action
in the USC game on the following
night, it is not known when he will
return to top efficiency.
Stanford Starts Slowly
Looking like a bunch of limp dish
rags in the first 13 minutes, Stan
ford finally came to life in the wan
ing moments of the first half to lead
the Bruins, 37 to 28, at intermission.
The grame progressed with both
teams having trouble finding the
scoring range, and after 10 minutes,
the score was tied at 11 apiece. For
awhile it appeared as if the crowd
was going to get out of hand, as
Referee Lloyd Leith callecftwo tech
nical fouls, one on Bruin Carl Krau
shaar and one on Stanford's audi
eiick, trying to keep the game under
control.
After that, things settled- down a
I bit. Dave Davidson, undoubtedly
the outstanding player on the floor,
kept Stanford's attack alive with his
rugged backboard work. He finally
put the Cards ahead at the five
i minute mark with his fourth straight
field goal, score reading 16 to 14.
Subs Go Best
With five minutes remaining in
the first half, Coach Everett Dean
inserted Marv Gelber, Gus Chavalas,
and Ralph Carver into the lineup,
and for the first time Stanford
looked like a five-man ballclub .
Going into a fast-breaking offense,
the Cards scored 17 rapid points to
grab off a 9-point half-time lead.
The second 20-minute session was
merely a playing out of the time, as
lithe Bruins couldn't get going.
UCLA's Carl Kraushaar, using his
•six feet, five inches to great advan
! ,'tage, dumped in 22 points for high
point honors of the evening. But
. the heralded Chuck Clutska was 1 a
- big disappointment.
Lewis Checks Clutska
Bob Lewis, assigned to cover the
high-scoring Clutska, didn't have to
j work very hard. Chuck didn't come
1 close in anything, and he sat out
I most of the second half, while subs
Seidel and Joeckel tried to handle
his job. Clutska finally ended the
evoking with one point, result of a
i free throw.
As a team, the Bruins put to
gether a miserable shooting per
centage. Missing 19 free throws, the
Westwoodei-s also had trouble hit
ting from the floor, but they did con
trol the boards mainly because of
George Stanich and Kraushaar.
Stanford, too, was not up to par.
But there was never any strain, as
the Deanmen kept well out of dan
ger all the way.

minutes of the UCLA game, and al
though he saw considerable action
in the USC game on the following
night, it is not known when he will
return to top efficiency.
Stanford Starts Slowly
Looking like a bunch of limp dish
rags in the first 13 minutes, Stan
ford finally came to life in the wan
ing moments of the first half to lead
the Bruins, 37 to 28, at intermission.
The grame progressed with both
teams having trouble finding the
scoring range, and after 10 minutes,
the score was tied at 11 apiece. For
awhile it appeared as if the crowd
was going to get out of hand, as
Referee Lloyd Leith callecftwo tech
nical fouls, one on Bruin Carl Krau
shaar and one on Stanford's audi
eiick, trying to keep the game under
control.
After that, things settled- down a
I bit. Dave Davidson, undoubtedly
the outstanding player on the floor,
kept Stanford's attack alive with his
rugged backboard work. He finally
put the Cards ahead at the five
i minute mark with his fourth straight
field goal, score reading 16 to 14.
Subs Go Best
With five minutes remaining in
the first half, Coach Everett Dean
inserted Marv Gelber, Gus Chavalas,
and Ralph Carver into the lineup,
and for the first time Stanford
looked like a five-man ballclub .
Going into a fast-breaking offense,
the Cards scored 17 rapid points to
grab off a 9-point half-time lead.
The second 20-minute session was
merely a playing out of the time, as
lithe Bruins couldn't get going.
UCLA's Carl Kraushaar, using his
•six feet, five inches to great advan
! ,'tage, dumped in 22 points for high
point honors of the evening. But
. the heralded Chuck Clutska was 1 a
- big disappointment.
Lewis Checks Clutska
Bob Lewis, assigned to cover the
high-scoring Clutska, didn't have to
j work very hard. Chuck didn't come
1 close in anything, and he sat out
I most of the second half, while subs
Seidel and Joeckel tried to handle
his job. Clutska finally ended the
evoking with one point, result of a
i free throw.
As a team, the Bruins put to
gether a miserable shooting per
centage. Missing 19 free throws, the
Westwoodei-s also had trouble hit
ting from the floor, but they did con
trol the boards mainly because of
George Stanich and Kraushaar.
Stanford, too, was not up to par.
But there was never any strain, as
the Deanmen kept well out of dan
ger all the way.

opener and eleventh victory in

Rose, who was the team's third

test. It is hoped that he will be

Stanford's other forward, high
