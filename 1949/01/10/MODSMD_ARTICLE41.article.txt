# USC Hands Indians First PCC Defeat
## 
### 
Stanford's cooled-off Cardi
nals, muffing their chances to
jump into league leadership,
bowed to USC's rugged Tro
jans last Saturday night in the
Pavilion, 56 to 46.
Playing without temporarily in
eligible Bill Rose, and with George
Yardley operating at only half
efficiency because of his injured
knee, Stanford trailed the Trojans
the entire game, and at one time
only, with seven minutes remaining,
did the Indians seem to click.
Troy's rough-and-tumble defense,
coupled with their ability to hit
from anywhere on the floor, was too
much for Stanford. They led from
the opening tipoff, as Abe Androfl
whipped in a long corner shot in
the first minute.
Milt Iverson countered for Stan
ford with a free throw, but Androfl
immediately poured through another
long one, and soon USC had jumped
into a 14 to 7 lead.
Trail By 7 at Half
At halftime, it was 27 to 20, and
Stanford was struggling to keep in
the game. Passes were going astray,
and the basket was iced over, as the
Indian attack hit is lowest ebb of
the season.
Everett Dean inserted his speed
team at the beginning of the second
half in an effort to outrun the Tro
jans, but sub forward Tom Riach
ruined it all by driving in for three
straight lay-ins and Stanford was
farther away than ever.
Bill Sharman also went to work
with two long shots from the floor,
and Troy led, 40 to 26. Stanford,
started a short rally when Dave
Davidson scored the first Indian
field goal of the half. The sub Bill
Lewis dumped in two quick ones,
topped off by a Stephenson lay-in
off a nice Yardley pass. Score read
48 to 42 at that point, but hot Tom
Riach put out the fire with another
driving lay-in.
The last few minutes were used
up with Stanford desperately trying
to score, as USC would foul, and
Stanford would take the ball out of
bounds. It was a wild scramble with
nobody getting anywhere.
Sharman Fouls Out
The Trojans fouled 34 times in the
wild and wooly contest, and Bill
Sharman and Stan Christie both
went out on five personals, but it
didn't seem to bother Troy.
Sub forwards Joe White and Tom
Riach appeared to be just as strong
as Sharman and Androff, and USC
was blessed with a host of tall, tough
guards that knew the backboard
business inside and out.
USC's second victory of the week
end gave the Trojans leadership in
the Southern Division race, with
Stanford and UCLA tied for second
(one win and one loss), and Califor
nia bringing up the rear with two
defeats.
Definitely hindered by his twisted
knee and two miles of tape, George
Yardley managed to dump in 11
joints to take high honors for Stan
ford, Dave Davidson, playing out
standing ball for the second straight
nmht, hit nine. ,
Stanford's main difficulty came
out of not being able to control the
ball. For the second time, thr
Cards could not get up on the
boards.

Cards could not get up on the
boards.
Stanford's cooled-off Cardi
nals, muffing their chances to
jump into league leadership,
bowed to USC's rugged Tro
jans last Saturday night in the
Pavilion, 56 to 46.
Playing without temporarily in
eligible Bill Rose, and with George
Yardley operating at only half
efficiency because of his injured
knee, Stanford trailed the Trojans
the entire game, and at one time
only, with seven minutes remaining,
did the Indians seem to click.
Troy's rough-and-tumble defense,
coupled with their ability to hit
from anywhere on the floor, was too
much for Stanford. They led from
the opening tipoff, as Abe Androfl
whipped in a long corner shot in
the first minute.
Milt Iverson countered for Stan
ford with a free throw, but Androfl
immediately poured through another
long one, and soon USC had jumped
into a 14 to 7 lead.
Trail By 7 at Half
At halftime, it was 27 to 20, and
Stanford was struggling to keep in
the game. Passes were going astray,
and the basket was iced over, as the
Indian attack hit is lowest ebb of
the season.
Everett Dean inserted his speed
team at the beginning of the second
half in an effort to outrun the Tro
jans, but sub forward Tom Riach
ruined it all by driving in for three
straight lay-ins and Stanford was
farther away than ever.
Bill Sharman also went to work
with two long shots from the floor,
and Troy led, 40 to 26. Stanford,
started a short rally when Dave
Davidson scored the first Indian
field goal of the half. The sub Bill
Lewis dumped in two quick ones,
topped off by a Stephenson lay-in
off a nice Yardley pass. Score read
48 to 42 at that point, but hot Tom
Riach put out the fire with another
driving lay-in.
The last few minutes were used
up with Stanford desperately trying
to score, as USC would foul, and
Stanford would take the ball out of
bounds. It was a wild scramble with
nobody getting anywhere.
Sharman Fouls Out
The Trojans fouled 34 times in the
wild and wooly contest, and Bill
Sharman and Stan Christie both
went out on five personals, but it
didn't seem to bother Troy.
Sub forwards Joe White and Tom
Riach appeared to be just as strong
as Sharman and Androff, and USC
was blessed with a host of tall, tough
guards that knew the backboard
business inside and out.
USC's second victory of the week
end gave the Trojans leadership in
the Southern Division race, with
Stanford and UCLA tied for second
(one win and one loss), and Califor
nia bringing up the rear with two
defeats.
Definitely hindered by his twisted
knee and two miles of tape, George
Yardley managed to dump in 11
joints to take high honors for Stan
ford, Dave Davidson, playing out
standing ball for the second straight
nmht, hit nine. ,
Stanford's main difficulty came
out of not being able to control the
ball. For the second time, thr
Cards could not get up on the
boards.
