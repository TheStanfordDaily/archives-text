# Varsity Matmen Open Season Friday
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling squad for
1949 opens the season at Berkeley at
7:30 Thursday when they meet the
California Bears on their home
grounds.
The Indians this year will be an
experienced team with an excellent
chance to improve their last year's
record of three victories and five
defeats.
Leading the Indians for the
fourth year will be Vern Jones,
student coach in 1947 and 1948 and
assisting Winston Mumbv this year
in the 136-pound class. Vern swept
nearly every tournament on the
Pacific Coast last year and should
be a consistent winner this year.
Dick Esbenshade will take over
the 121 division. A letterman Dick
should be in for a better time now

that Christianson. Cal's champion
121-pounder, is gone.
Jim Kurfess will handle the 155-
pound division this year, and prom
ises to become one of the toughest
performers ion the coast in his class.
Jim has earned three varsity letters.
Dick Cruce will start his second
year on the team at the 128-pound
post. Dick is a fast - improving
wrestler who should do well this
year.
In the 145 Dan Winston will start
his second year of competition for
the Indians. Dan lettered in 1946 in
the 155 and returns to the team this
year in a lower weight division.
Roy Gaskin returns for his fourth
year as an Indian grappler in the
165-pound class. Roy has lettered
three years at the Farm and should
wind up his career as one of the

better wrestlers on the coast in the
165.
In the 175 no one has definitely
nailed down the varsity position but
Dick DeWitt has the inside track at
present. In the heavyweight divi
sion Jack Wliite seems to be in, but
Steve Garst is giving him plenty of
competition.
