# GOP May Oppose Acheson Nomination

WASHINGTON, JJan. 9 (AP)—The Senate Republican Policy
Committee may be called upon to decide whether to make an
organized—if futile—attack on President Truman's choice of
Dean Acheson as Secretary of State.
There was some sentiment —notably from GOP Floor Leader

Wherry of Nebraska—to thrash out
the matter at a conference of Repub
lican senators tomorrow. Wherry
said it "undoubtedly will come up"
there.
But Senator Taft of Ohio, who is
policy chairman, later told a reporter
he thinks the matter should be dis
cussed first by the policy committee
at a later meeting. Wherry is on
that committee which is the party's
signal-calling group on important is
sues.
Taft said-he agrees with Senator
Vandenberg of Michigan, ranking
Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, that there should be a
full examination of Acheson's quali
fications for the post to be vacated
by the retirement of Secretary Mar
shall.

WASHINGTON, Jan. S
spite the political uproar over the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, two of . the most vital foreign
issues expected to confront the new
Congress appeared certain today of
bipartisan support.
Senator Capehart (R-Ind.) said
yesterday that bipartisan foreign
policy has broken down as a result
of the Republican-Democratic row
over membership of the key Senate
committee. The controlling Demo
crats grabbed eight seats, leaving
five to the GOP. In the Republican
bossed 80th Congress, the GOP took
seven, giving the Democrats six.
Both administration and many
congressional leaders, however, fore
cast strong bipartisan backing for
two proposals which President Tru
man is due to urge upon Congress—
probably beginning with his budget
message tomorrow. These are:
1. A military alliance between
Western Europe and North America
(the United States and Canada) to
take the form ot a"i Norm ii uu nuc
Regional Security System."
2. A new peacetime "lend-lease"
program through which the admin
istration proposes to help rearm
Western Europe and possibly other •
countries whose military strength
will contribute to U.S. security.
