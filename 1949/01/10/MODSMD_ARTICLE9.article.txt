# Four Farm Grads Hold Art Display
## 
### 
Four Stanford graduates are
showing some of their best works
in the Art Gallery this week. All
are women, three of whom are mar
ried to faculty members.
Mrs. Mabel Farmer, wife of Dr.
Edward Farmer, art professor, has
a group of wood engravings hang
ing in the gallery foyer. The detail
work is minutely planned and pin
point exact. Her life-size cricket
and bumblebee engravings strik
ingly resemble costume jewelry
pins.
"Exposed—One Yellow House" is
one of the best paintings in the
main lobby collection of Miss Janet
Turner. However, all but two of
her pieces have a magazine-cover
realism which lacks real individu
ality or depth.
Miss Turner's color prints in the
foyer have less detail, and, relying
more on color, transmit a stronger
over-all effect.
Russian-born Marina Timoshen
ko - Goodier has concentrated her
exhibit on still life. Her "Old Pew
ter" and "Autumn Still Life" do not
have the weak pastels seen in some
of the others. "Easter Eggs," with
its more intense pinks and blues,
has something of the distinct style
of a perfume ad.
Mary Crosten has included sev
eral thoughtful nature studies in
her small exhibit.
