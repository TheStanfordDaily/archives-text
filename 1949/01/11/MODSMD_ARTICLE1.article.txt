# Cold Weather Continues With No Relief in Sight
## Mercury Heads For Record Low 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 10 (/Pi—
Below freezing weather hit all of
Northern California this morning,
and the Weather Bureau tonight
predicted an even colder wave to
come—with no break in sight before
Thursday. One death was reported
due to the cold.
Today's official low here, 32.2 de
grees at the Civic Center, was the
coldest for Jan. 10 in 78 years of
Weather Bureau records. It was the
lowest reading here for any date in
the last 15 years. And at Golden
Gate Park, a ground-level ther
mometer read 22 degrees.
Donner Icebox
Donner Summit was the state's
icebox, with a reading of five below
zero. Lowest in the Bay Area was
14 degrees, reported from Searsville
Lake, near the Stanford University
campus. In interior valleys. Sacra
mento reported a low of 21; Fresno
20; Merced 10; Salinas 21; and San
Jose 29.
The body of a men of about 25
was found in a gully on the Oakland
road 10 miles from San Jose. Offi
cers said he evidently had tried to
sleep in a culvert, then died from
exposure and cold while trying to
reach a warmer spot. A paper in
his pocket bore the name: "Jose
Leon, San Joaquin County Jail."
Icicles on Bridge
Five-foot icicles festooned the
highway tunnel on the north ap
proach to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company
reported its customers burned a
record billion cubic feet of gas today,
trying to keep warm. It was half
again as much as the average for
a January day.
The forecast for tomorrow morn
ing: 30 degrees in San Francisco's
Civic Center; 20 elsewhere in the
Bay Area; and comparable colder
marks in other Northern California
cities.
Snow was falling in Los Angeles
and vicinity this afternoon.
Snow in San Bernardino
At dusk, San Bernardino reported
it had the heaviest snowfall in 67
years, with big flakes being whipped
down in a swirling wind over three
inches that had fallen during the
day.
Southern California was locked to
night in the grip of its second freeze
within a week, this time with snow
on the ground.
