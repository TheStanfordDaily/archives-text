# Truman Budget Stirs Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (AP) —President Truman told Congress
today it will take at least $41,858,000,000 to run the government
right next year—half of it to hold back the Communist tide.
Republicans immediately demanded deep slashes and party
lines quickly formed for the big tests ahead.
Mr. Truman's budget covering the 1950 fiscal year beginning

next July 1 is peacetime's biggest—
$1,678,000,000 larger than this year.
For the cold war with Russia he
asked the most powerful military
forces the country has ever had out
side a war—and funds to bolster Al
lied nations against the Red surge.
Moreover, Mr. Truman served not
ice he will ask more funds later to
supply arms to non-Communist na
tions, a step which will push the
budget even higher.
All told Mr. Truman asked for
a tax increase of nearly $6,000,-
000,000. First he reiterated his re
cent request for a $4,000,000,000 in
crease, mostly on corporations. Then
he asked nearly $2,000,000,000 in so
cial security taxes, to finance new
and old programs.
Stands Pat
He did not give an inch in his de
mands for the vast social and eco
nomic program he demanded in hi>
State of the Union message; such as
housing, better schools, more social
security benefits.
On the defense front, Mr. Truman
stressed the importance of air power,
but frowned on the idea of a 70-
group air force, which has been
heavily backed in Congress and by
the air generals. Mr. Truman said
number and size of planes, rather
than number of groups is a better
gauge of air force strength.
Mr. Truman said the prospects for
the 1951 fiscal year are for even
greater governmental costs. He
mentioned national defense and
world responsibilities.
Reckless Figures
Republicans called the Truman
figures dangerous, reckless and over
estimated. But administration forces
showed no signs of discontent.
Rep. Cannon (D-Mo.) called the
budget"the most practical that could
be presented at this time." Cannon
will head the House Appropriations
Committee where spending bills
originate.
Cannon called it "part of a Jong
time program in which you will have
benefits for years to come."
The committee's ranking Republi
can, Rep. Taber of New York, ob
served "they've evidently given
everybody everything they asked
for." He said it would be cut down.
In the Senate, GOP Floor Leader
Wherry of Nebraska, called the
budget "reckless." He said it pro
posed "new spending
which will grow even greater in
future years."
