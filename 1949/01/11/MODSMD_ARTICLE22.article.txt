## Bawlout Addresses 
### 
Bawlout grades are back in the Student Directory this year, and
their reference value lor faculty members and administration of
ficials insures their continued publication. But just as this country
needs a good five-cent cigar, so do students need a good direc
tory that lists hometown addresses of Farm students.
Such an improvement to the Bawlout would make the publi
cation more valuable for students in their private correspondence
during vacations or after graduation. Hometown addresses would
be particularly useful, for instance, to students mailing greeting
cards to their friends during the Christmas season.
If next autumn's Bawlout were revised to include hometown
addresses, production and newsprint costs would be increased
one-third. In addition, each student entry would take three lines
of type one column in width. The present Bawlout, on the other
hand, sells for 50 cents, and each student classification takes one
line of type two columns wide.
The Bawlout address question has been considered in the
past by the Registrar's Office, but two questions have clouded
the issue. Or should the Bawlout be published once a year as it
is now but contain more information?
Whether next year's Bawlout appears once or three times, it
will not be a satisfactory reference book unless hometown ad
dresses are included in the student information section.
