How would you like it if thousands of people wrote you each Christmas j
asking for things and then not a one of them wrote back after Christmas :
to thank you? That's why I thought I'd write one and cheer the old boy up I
. . . . Santa, I mean.
Of course I realize that there are a lot of people who don't believe in I
Santa. Gl's of the 15th Air Force had to cancel their Christmas party for '
orphans. The reason—the kids just didn't believe in Santa Claus. The I
superintendent of the home says they have been taught the truly religious I
form of Christmas.
Progress
But there are still plenty who do believe. Seems the report has gotten
around that Fairbanks, Alaska, is the last outpost before you get to Santa's •
home, so, being a smart younger generation, they have been filling that
post office with mail.
Others are getting even more modern—they're using the telephone. The j
Southern New England Telephone Co. hired 10 deep-voiced men to answer i
phone calls from children. But when 500 calls swamped the switchboards j
women operators were forced to tell callers that Santa was too busy to
come to the phone.
But to get back to my post-season letter to Santa. The house is quiet j
now so I can concentrate. My sister has gone down to exchange her
negligee he gave her. She wants to know does he think she's a tent pole,
because that's how the negligee fits her, like a tent. "If a negligee is
going to show a girl to best advantage, it has to fit right here and there,"
she says.
Dad already has offered me a varied selection of his new ties. It's not j
that he doesn't like them. It's just that he might scare the baby. They |
look like they were cut right out of the rainbow. I told him that he could j
put them away in a dark closet somewhere and tell the donees that he '
thinks they're so nice he's saving them for a special occasion. You don't j
have to tetll them that the special occasion is the burning of your home, i
A lie is a lie, I know, but sometimes it's kinder that way.
Come to think of it, I don't really know what to puf into a post-season
letter to Santa Claus. I can't thank him, because he didn't come through
with that new car. I know he means well, though, and I sure wouldn't want
to hurt his feelings. There's always another year .... another Christ
mas! Maybe I just better forget it.
I'll go try on that new plaid sweater I got for Dad. Got my size; hope
it fits him, too.

Santa. Gl's of the 15th Air Force had to cancel their Christmas party for '
orphans. The reason—the kids just didn't believe in Santa Claus. The I
superintendent of the home says they have been taught the truly religious I
form of Christmas.
Progress
But there are still plenty who do believe. Seems the report has gotten
around that Fairbanks, Alaska, is the last outpost before you get to Santa's •
home, so, being a smart younger generation, they have been filling that
post office with mail.
Others are getting even more modern—they're using the telephone. The j
Southern New England Telephone Co. hired 10 deep-voiced men to answer i
phone calls from children. But when 500 calls swamped the switchboards j
women operators were forced to tell callers that Santa was too busy to
come to the phone.
But to get back to my post-season letter to Santa. The house is quiet j
now so I can concentrate. My sister has gone down to exchange her
negligee he gave her. She wants to know does he think she's a tent pole,
because that's how the negligee fits her, like a tent. "If a negligee is
going to show a girl to best advantage, it has to fit right here and there,"
she says.
Dad already has offered me a varied selection of his new ties. It's not j
that he doesn't like them. It's just that he might scare the baby. They |
look like they were cut right out of the rainbow. I told him that he could j
put them away in a dark closet somewhere and tell the donees that he '
thinks they're so nice he's saving them for a special occasion. You don't j
have to tetll them that the special occasion is the burning of your home, i
A lie is a lie, I know, but sometimes it's kinder that way.
Come to think of it, I don't really know what to puf into a post-season
letter to Santa Claus. I can't thank him, because he didn't come through
with that new car. I know he means well, though, and I sure wouldn't want
to hurt his feelings. There's always another year .... another Christ
mas! Maybe I just better forget it.
I'll go try on that new plaid sweater I got for Dad. Got my size; hope
it fits him, too.
How would you like it if thousands of people wrote you each Christmas j
asking for things and then not a one of them wrote back after Christmas :
to thank you? That's why I thought I'd write one and cheer the old boy up I
. . . . Santa, I mean.
Of course I realize that there are a lot of people who don't believe in I
Santa. Gl's of the 15th Air Force had to cancel their Christmas party for '
orphans. The reason—the kids just didn't believe in Santa Claus. The I
superintendent of the home says they have been taught the truly religious I
