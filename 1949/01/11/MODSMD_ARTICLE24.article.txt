## Cheers for Stanford Trustee 
### 
To the Editor:
As spokesman for a group of students who were stranded on the City
of San Francisco, I want to express our pride in the actions of Mr. Dinkel
spiel (Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, member of the Board of Trustees). We were
very impressed and proud that he was a Stanford trustee because he
helped a number of us out. He was nice to everyone on the train. People
were impressed by such a friendly attitude on the part of a higher official.
