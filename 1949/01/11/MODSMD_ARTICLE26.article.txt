There seems to be one difficulty
in importing actresses for leading
roles in college plays. They won't
act their age. According to the
Daily Californian, 12-year-old Nina
Sicular, who is playing the lead
in the university production, "The
Glass Dream," is having trouble act
ing like a 12-year-old on stage.
Wonder if Jane Darwell will have
difficulty with the 75-year-old part

"My old man's a college man—"
That's the theme song of Donald
Mussachio Jr., a student at the Vet

his father, Donald Mussachio Sr., is

The younger Mussachio is com

There's a new definition for L. S.
M. F. T.
It's the slogan of Nicotine Un

holics Anonymous. The club's slo

Means Finer Things."
The group, recently publicized in
the Washington State Evergreen,
was organized two years ago in
Pullman, and includes a number of
WSC faculty members on its ros

who have quit smoking to keep their

Upperclassmen at the College of

amazing tenderness in hazing prac

Criticism north of the border—
The University of Toronto var
sity was busy recently trying to
disprove statements about Canadian
men by two Costa Rican women
students. According to the girls,
.Canadian men (1) weren't aggressive
enough; (2) go in for high romance
or nothing; (3) don't know the
meaning of group fun. Their idea
is to get a girl off by herself. The
South American visitors even had a
few remarks to make about women.
They said —"Coeds don't know how
to use a 'come hither' look."
A personal poll conducted by the
varsity partly agreed with the state
ments. Toronto coeds said men are
not aggressive enough. For the oth
er remarks, there was no comment.

King for a day—
The law students of the Univer

by the shortage of women. Each
year the law students traditionally
choose one of their number as queen
of the annual lawyers' banquet.
Last year there were no coeds tak

risters. They chose a man student,
Wesley Sando of Grand Forks, as
"queen."

The law students of the Univer

by the shortage of women. Each
year the law students traditionally
choose one of their number as queen
of the annual lawyers' banquet.
Last year there were no coeds tak

risters. They chose a man student,
Wesley Sando of Grand Forks, as
"queen."

There seems to be one difficulty
in importing actresses for leading
roles in college plays. They won't
act their age. According to the

in the university production, "The
Glass Dream," is having trouble act

men by two Costa Rican women
