## Open Rushing Season 
### 
You're lucky that you're going to 1
Stanford. Realize this and remem
ber it as rushing season progresses, i
Here, on the Farm, becoming a
Greek docs not assume the propor- |
tions of reaching that indispensable ;
heaven that it does on other cam- ;
puses. This is a better thing, I be
lieve, for both the fellow who final
ly joins and the fellow who does J
not join.
This is not a rationalization for i
those who want to but will not j
make it, nor is it an assurance for 1
those who will make it. It's a few i
horse-sense remarks, I believe, by
a person who at one time went I
through the rigamarole of rushing !
seasons at various houses—often to J
the mutual amusement and or cha
grin of both parties. This writer j
lives off campus, eats at Encina, and
has acquaintances and friends both ;
on the Row and in the dorms. There
are many more like him at Stan
ford. So. I can be objective.
During this rushing, you freshmen, ;
don't play "the fawning publicail" !
when you go to the houses. Don't j
sell your personality short by try- j
ing to be too much of what you're ;
not. though sometimes the houses
are guilty of this—but most of you
have enough sense to realize that
you and the houses realize that
you're aware of this. It's the one
time of the school year when the i
houses sometimes put on a cloak of '
similitude. But, as for you, be po
lite, attentive, and don't be hesitant !
to ask questions, any questions. Re- !
member this is a two-way propo- i
sition —both the house and you have !
to be careful. It's not the question
that you ask, but the manner in i

which you ask it. Be natural about
it. not demanding or critical; then
the house men will take your que
ries in the right spirit ot educating
you.
Remember as you go through that
every house complement is quite
proud of its membership, and it's
understandable and commendable.
They all have camaraderie of spirit
to some extent or other. Altogether
the houses contribute an important
stream of school spirit to Stanford.
This idea of making lasting
friends is not necessarily more
valid in a frat house than any place
else on campus. It can be true
there and probably often is.
In a dorm like Encina, Toyon, die
Village, or Stern Hall, you have the
opportunity to pick your friends, or
they to pick you. You have a wider
field of selection and rejection. But.
remember, whether you live in a
house or a tent, man is a social ani
mal; lasting friendships are avail
able to you wherever you live.
Houses usually have a better or
ganized social program than the
larger, relatively socially unwieldy
dorms.
Dorms on the average .have high
er grade averages than the houses.
Some fraternity men move out of
the houses at times and take to liv
ing in Palo Alto for a quarter to
bring up their averages. Just some,
though, not all.
So, you see, there are two sides.
Above all, as you go around, look
ing them over and they looking you
over, remember that joining a fra
ternity house at Stanford is only
ONE of the things out of many that
you might do: not THE thing that
you have to do.
