# Indians Shiver, Adjust to Siege

"It leaves me cold."
This quip by a number of roughs
seems to summarize the reaction of
Stanford students to the below
freezing weather which has been
plaguing them for the past week.
With little relief from the cold
snap in sight, most of the Farm in
mates seemed to have resigned
themselves to a siege similar to that
experienced by the Army flyers
marooned in Greenland, and have
adjusted themselves accordingly.

Most student motorists have dis
covered that the advice of the State
Highway Department to drain car
radiators during the night is well
taken. A number of them have also
found that an alternative to this
procedure, filling their radiators
with permanent anti-freeze, is an
expensive one. The cheaper but
less durable alcohol is becoming in
creasingly scarce in the Bay Area.
Attendants at the campus service
station said that cars awaiting a
wash job there yesterday did not
thaw out until about 11 a.m.
The traditional grimness of 8
o'clock classes was accentuated
yesterday by a frigid temperature
reading of 23 degrees. Seldom a
scintillating group, the sunrise stu
dents were dulled even further as
they shuffled to class with turned
up collars and hunched shoulders.
Others looked on the brighter
sir'e. Sunday's snowfall in Los An
geles was one of the leading topics
for chiding discussion yesterday—
and a source of chagrin to boosters
of balmy. Southern California.
Two Latrunita residents capital
ized on the chill to have their pic
tures taken at high noon while
standing on the ice in the pond in
La<? court.
One sednte law student was seen
strol'in« thoughtfully across Inner
Quad, brief case in hand. Spotting
a patch ol' ice, he came to a halt,
breaking into a dead run,
he slid gleefully across the frozen
spot. On reaching the other side, he
aeain assumed his meditative air
•md moved on.

The unprecedented cold here,
and throughout California, con
tinued to cause local thermome
ters to reach new lows each day.
Other results of the frigid weath
er in the area were varied and
numerous.
Shallow pools of water froze
over during the night, the ice
often remaining through the day.
Some pipes and radiators were
temporarily frozen, and one
plumber at Los Altos received 30
pleas for aid in thawing frozen
pipes.
A chillv wind keot most people
indoors, and caused a greatly in
creased demand for gas. As a re
sult, a Palo Alto official asked the
citizens to help conserve gas.

With little relief from the cold
snap in sight, most of the Farm in

Most student motorists have dis
covered that the advice of the State
Highway Department to drain car
radiators during the night is well

expensive one. The cheaper but
less durable alcohol is becoming in
creasingly scarce in the Bay Area.
