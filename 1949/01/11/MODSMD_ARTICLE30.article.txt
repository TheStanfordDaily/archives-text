# Sec. Dean Acheson

### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
What is our new Secretary of j
State Dean Acheson like?
Says Professor Graham Stuart of j
the political science department and j
author of a book on the State De- j
partment: "Mr. Acheson is a man
who has worked himself through j
the ranks. He is, I believe, the only
man ever to have been appointed |
to the Secretaryship of the State
Department who has previously held \
the position of Under Secretary and j
Assistant Secretary.
"Mr. Acheson is of striking phys
ical stature and a hard worker. The
man has a wonderful faculty of j
handling conferences efficiently. He's
very good at this as well as pos- J
sessing all of his other abilities."
Professor Stuart knows Mr. Ache- j
son and is a handy authority from ,
whom information can sometimes ;
be elicited. "The only criticism of i
which I know," said Professor Stu
art. "that has been directed at Mr.
Acheson is that he is too far left of j
center. Once he showed signs of
being overly friendly to Russia."
Continuing, Mr. Stuart says. ;
"Though by now I'm fairly sure ,
that Mr. Acheson, as have many
other liberals, has undergone a
forced change of opinion."
In his book Professor Stuart
wrote about Ncbraskan Senator
Wherry's former opposition to Mr.
Acheson in lesser assignments. "I

j don't think that the Senator's new
| est attack on Acheson's new con
j firmation will get anywhere," Stu
art added.
The professor believes that, since
> Acheson is a Truman appointee, the
j President may not be as awestruck
J and deferent toward his new Seere
! tary as he was toward former Chief
j of Staff and then Secretary George
; Marshall, and that since Truman
; won the national helm mostly
| through his own efforts, there will
i be more of Truman in America's
i foreign diplomacy from now on. "I
i believe there will probably be a
| return to a joint management of our
S foreign relations as before in our
history," Stuart said.
Perhaps deplorable in today's
I events might be the fact that Ache
j son is no authority on China.
, "However. Acheson will make good
i use of Far Eastern experts who are
! at his command."
'"All in all." Professor Stuart said
; smilingly, "I was slightly surprised
| at his appointment, though all along
; I've predicted that he was the lead
j ing contender for the position il
Marshall vacated. The reason.
: though, that I was slightly sur
prised is the fact that Mr. Acheson
' has so many of the eminent attri
butes and qualifications to recom
: mend himself to the job, that 1 was
fearful he might not get itâ€”you
! know how those things turn out
! sometime^.''
