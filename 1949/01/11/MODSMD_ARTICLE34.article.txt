### SANDY MEITUS 
"Why, Oh Why, Don't We
Ever Reach Wyoming?" or
"Why, Oh Why, Did We Ever
Leave Chicago?" was the gen
eral opinion and theme song of
the 270 passengers who were aboard
the City of San Francisco Sunday
night after being eight days en
route from Chicago.
Aboard the train were 34 Stanford
students. Dr. William C. Bark, asso
ciate professor of history at Stan
ford. and Dr. A. F. Meisen, instruc
tor of history at Stanford and wife,
Gloria, secretary of Food Institute
it Stanford, and Mr. Lloyd W.
Dinkeyspiel, a member of the Board
if Trustees and his wife.
The trip seemed quite simple when
the passengers boarded the crack
streamliner "City" Jan. 2 in Chicago.
Awoke To Blizzard
When the City's passengers awoke
Monday morning in Sydney, Neb.,
the world was a different place. Out
ride a blizzard was raging. After
the City finally arrived and slopped
in Kimball, the passengers aboard
the train began to realize that they
weren't going to see San Francisco
or even Wyoming, for a long time.
Although some were "cold-blooded
enough to spend the night on a
frigid City of San Francisco, most
passengers braved the 14 below zero
weather and a 70-mile-an-hour bliz
zard to tight their way to the train
station, a nearby cafe, or the Wheat
Growers' Hotel.
Th ere were about 300 people, in
jluding the crew, and only 85 rooms

I available in the hotel. Some were
fortunate enough to obtain hotel
rooms, while others spent Monday
night on the floor, in Ihe lobby, or
optimistically playing bridge and
j poker since they expected to be out
1 of Kimball Tuesday. Three Stanford
girls spent the later part of the night
j in the vacated bed of a kind-hearted
, hotel clerk.
Eight-llour Shifts
Monday morning the eight-hour
shifts began. Those who had hotel
rooms during the night gave up their
! rooms and amused themselves with
card games, listening to radio news
: reports, and speculating on when
| the train woidd pull out.
The dining room crew from the
City did yeoman service throughout
the entire trip by serving meals in
the basement of the Wheat Growers'
| Hotel. That functional basement
' served as a bedroom, card room,
dance hall, dining room, and meeting
place for 200 snowbound travelers
during those weary four days.
Tuesday night, for those sleeping

on the basement floor, would have
been uneventful if uncomfortable
| except for an epileptic fit and a
nightmare stricken youngster crying
| "mother, grandmother."
Kimball Explored
Wednesday citizens of the erst
j while "City" were able to leave the
; Wheat Growers' Hotel and discover
I that Kimball was more than a
1 hotel, a cafe, and a railroad station,
i A few students found their way to
j a local pool hall. They were accom
panied by Stanford women who
j made their first and probably last
j trip to such an exclusively male do-
I main.
Wednesday night 50 passengers
were housed through the help of
i the Red Cross.
