# Varsity Mittmen Square Off Against Cal Poly Friday Night
## 
### 
Haymakers and uppercuts will
replace set-shots and lay-ins at the
Pavilion Friday night when Coach
Ray Lunny's varsity mittmen
.square off against the ringsters from
Cal Polytechnic at 8:15.
It will be the first appearance of
the young season for the Indian
leather-throwers, and Lunny prom
ises plenty of action and thrills for
Friday's ringsiders. Pairings should
be announced within the next few
days.
Farm fight fans will be particu
larly interested in the performances
of two heavy weight hopefuls, Mike
Pelsinger and Jim Vatcher, who
will be out to make the Stanfordites
forget all about the loss of the in

jured Emery Mitchell.
Also attracting more than a little
attention from the fish' faithfuls
will be Jim Hammond, hard-punch
ing light-heavyweight. Hammond's
explosive right is a cinch to provide
lots of fireworks Friday night.
Next Wednesday, Jan. 19, Lunny's
liii√ü crew will travel to Santa Clara
to clash with the beak - busting
Broncos. The match was originally
announced for this Friday night,
but has been moved up to the mid
dle of the week to make room for
the Poly fray.
Following the Santa Clara tilt, the
Indian ringsters will have four
matches remaining on the season's
docket.
