## The 						Front Row 
### 
Basketball is a fine game. You
take a round ball, bounce it up and
down, sometimes throw it to a
teammate, and most important, you
put the ball in your opponent's bas
ket " more often than he puts it in
yours.
Up until the conference season
started, Stanford was having great
success in doing just that. But let
the real race get under way, and
wham, blob, flooey, the once well
oiled cage machine looks like a beat
jalopy.
At least that's what happened last
year when Stanford started the
Southern Division season with a
sparkling record of seven wins in
eight tries, only to di-op its first four
conference games and never get rid
of the Southern Loop heebie-jee
bi%s.
It Started All Over Again
And when it started all over
again last Saturday night, I wanted
to crawl off in the corner and try to
figure it out. The main reason for
the 10-point loss to the Tro 4 ans was
obvious. Playing without the serv
ices of Bill Rose, and with George
Yardley limping around with a stiff
knee, the Cards couldn't be ex
pected to put out a top effort. But
it was more than lacking a scoring
punch.
The Trojans out-scrapped Stan
ford all the way down the line.
They controlled the ball, and fol
lowed their shots, while Stanford
looked futile in its efforts to keep
pace.
Even UCLA outfought the Cards,
but Stanford happened to be hitting
a better percentage of its shots Fri
day night, and therefore got past the
Bruins. But the Indians did not
look like championship material in
doing so. There was a certain some
thing—an indefinable spark—miss
ing, and the continued loss of that
spark will destroy any good team.
Anybody Has a Bad Night
Of course, it must be figured that
all basketball teams, good and fair,
are going to have a few bad nights.
Xpßsk Luisetti's team of 1938 drop
ped its first three conference games,

bt made a great comeback to win
the Southern Division title.
Stanford has by no means hurt its
chances to win the league crown,
because USC will lose games to
both UCLA and California. How
ever, any more weekends like the
last, and it will be time to kiss an
other year goodbye.
Next weekend the Indians must
play the game that they are capable
of playing. In facing California in
a two-game series, they have a per
fect subject upon which to take out
their abused feelings.
Bears 40 Games Ahead
The record book says tb't the
Berkeley Golden Bear has piled up
a 73 to 33 bulge in games won
against Stanford cage squads. Those
73 wins, outrageous in number,
have been tough to take.
One in particlar stands out. It
was the last game of the 1947 sea
son. Dave Davidson, Bill Stephen
son, Babe Hiegins, Morley Thomp
son, aftcl Dick Berlin, all playing
their first year of ball, were given
the worst troncing a Stanford team
ever received.
Gentleman Nibs Price wouldn't
let go that night, and his boys were
still pouring it on, using a press
ing defense and ripping the hoop
wide open, as the final gun popped,
score reading 88 to 48.
Please, Please Smash California
I can also remember California
winning 11 out of 12 in the last
three years, and then too, there was
this season's PCC Tournament hu
miliation which saw the straggly
Bears of 1949 edge out Stanford's
unbeaten golden boys in the finale,
with all voices asking for an
swer to the mysterious Berkeley
jinx.
And if I were George Yardley, or
Dave Davidson, or Bill Stephenson,
or Milt Iverson, I would like to give
those voices a good answer next
weekend. I'd want to crush Cali
fornia by as many points as I could
throw through the hoop, and I
wouldn't stop to say sorry. I'd just
knock 'em down, get that ball, and
keep scoring. And in so doing, I'd
look like a basketball player.

ever, any more weekends like the

Bears 40 Games Ahead
The record book says tb't the
Berkeley Golden Bear has piled up
a 73 to 33 bulge in games won
against Stanford cage squads. Those
73 wins, outrageous in number,
have been tough to take.
One in particlar stands out. It
was the last game of the 1947 sea
son. Dave Davidson, Bill Stephen
son, Babe Hiegins, Morley Thomp
son, aftcl Dick Berlin, all playing
their first year of ball, were given
the worst troncing a Stanford team
ever received.
Gentleman Nibs Price wouldn't
let go that night, and his boys were
still pouring it on, using a press
ing defense and ripping the hoop
wide open, as the final gun popped,
score reading 88 to 48.
Please, Please Smash California
I can also remember California
winning 11 out of 12 in the last
three years, and then too, there was
this season's PCC Tournament hu
miliation which saw the straggly
Bears of 1949 edge out Stanford's
unbeaten golden boys in the finale,
with all voices asking for an
swer to the mysterious Berkeley
jinx.
And if I were George Yardley, or
Dave Davidson, or Bill Stephenson,
or Milt Iverson, I would like to give
those voices a good answer next
weekend. I'd want to crush Cali
fornia by as many points as I could
throw through the hoop, and I
wouldn't stop to say sorry. I'd just
knock 'em down, get that ball, and
keep scoring. And in so doing, I'd
look like a basketball player.
Basketball is a fine game. You
take a round ball, bounce it up and
down, sometimes throw it to a
teammate, and most important, you
put the ball in your opponent's bas
ket " more often than he puts it in
yours.
Up until the conference season
started, Stanford was having great
success in doing just that. But let
the real race get under way, and
wham, blob, flooey, the once well
oiled cage machine looks like a beat
jalopy.
At least that's what happened last
year when Stanford started the
Southern Division season with a
sparkling record of seven wins in
eight tries, only to di-op its first four
conference games and never get rid
of the Southern Loop heebie-jee
bi%s.
It Started All Over Again
And when it started all over
again last Saturday night, I wanted
to crawl off in the corner and try to
figure it out. The main reason for
the 10-point loss to the Tro 4 ans was
obvious. Playing without the serv
ices of Bill Rose, and with George
Yardley limping around with a stiff
knee, the Cards couldn't be ex
pected to put out a top effort. But
it was more than lacking a scoring
punch.
The Trojans out-scrapped Stan
ford all the way down the line.
They controlled the ball, and fol
lowed their shots, while Stanford
looked futile in its efforts to keep
pace.
Even UCLA outfought the Cards,
but Stanford happened to be hitting
a better percentage of its shots Fri
day night, and therefore got past the
Bruins. But the Indians did not
look like championship material in
doing so. There was a certain some
thing—an indefinable spark—miss
ing, and the continued loss of that
spark will destroy any good team.

Of course, it must be figured that

ket " more often than he puts it in
yours.
Up until the conference season
started, Stanford was having great
success in doing just that. But let
the real race get under way, and
wham, blob, flooey, the once well
oiled cage machine looks like a beat
jalopy.
At least that's what happened last
year when Stanford started the
Southern Division season with a
sparkling record of seven wins in
eight tries, only to di-op its first four
conference games and never get rid
of the Southern Loop heebie-jee
bi%s.
It Started All Over Again
And when it started all over
again last Saturday night, I wanted
to crawl off in the corner and try to
figure it out. The main reason for
the 10-point loss to the Tro 4 ans was
obvious. Playing without the serv
ices of Bill Rose, and with George
Yardley limping around with a stiff
knee, the Cards couldn't be ex
pected to put out a top effort. But
it was more than lacking a scoring
punch.
The Trojans out-scrapped Stan
ford all the way down the line.
They controlled the ball, and fol
lowed their shots, while Stanford
looked futile in its efforts to keep
pace.
Even UCLA outfought the Cards,
but Stanford happened to be hitting
a better percentage of its shots Fri
day night, and therefore got past the
Bruins. But the Indians did not
look like championship material in
doing so. There was a certain some
thing—an indefinable spark—miss
ing, and the continued loss of that
spark will destroy any good team.
Anybody Has a Bad Night
Of course, it must be figured that
all basketball teams, good and fair,
are going to have a few bad nights.
Xpßsk Luisetti's team of 1938 drop
ped its first three conference games,

bt made a great comeback to win
the Southern Division title.
Stanford has by no means hurt its
chances to win the league crown,
because USC will lose games to
both UCLA and California. How
ever, any more weekends like the
last, and it will be time to kiss an
other year goodbye.
Next weekend the Indians must
play the game that they are capable
of playing. In facing California in
a two-game series, they have a per
fect subject upon which to take out
their abused feelings.
Bears 40 Games Ahead
The record book says tb't the
Berkeley Golden Bear has piled up
a 73 to 33 bulge in games won
against Stanford cage squads. Those
73 wins, outrageous in number,
have been tough to take.
One in particlar stands out. It
was the last game of the 1947 sea
son. Dave Davidson, Bill Stephen
son, Babe Hiegins, Morley Thomp
son, aftcl Dick Berlin, all playing
their first year of ball, were given
the worst troncing a Stanford team
ever received.
Gentleman Nibs Price wouldn't
let go that night, and his boys were
still pouring it on, using a press
ing defense and ripping the hoop
wide open, as the final gun popped,
score reading 88 to 48.
Please, Please Smash California
I can also remember California
winning 11 out of 12 in the last
three years, and then too, there was
this season's PCC Tournament hu
miliation which saw the straggly
Bears of 1949 edge out Stanford's
unbeaten golden boys in the finale,
with all voices asking for an
swer to the mysterious Berkeley
jinx.
And if I were George Yardley, or
Dave Davidson, or Bill Stephenson,
or Milt Iverson, I would like to give
those voices a good answer next
weekend. I'd want to crush Cali
fornia by as many points as I could
throw through the hoop, and I
wouldn't stop to say sorry. I'd just
knock 'em down, get that ball, and
keep scoring. And in so doing, I'd
look like a basketball player.
