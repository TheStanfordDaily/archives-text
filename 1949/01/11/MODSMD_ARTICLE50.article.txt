# The 						Second Row
## 
### 
It's hard to see what's going on
most of the time because of those
big heads sticking out in the front
row, but I want to tell you that the
second row is really the best place
to view a ballgame.
Aside from what has been heard
since the USC tragedy of Saturday
night, basketball is a popular game
at Stanford. Stout-hearted Indians
like to see their team play, and
therefore it is time to offer a long,
loud, and sincere moan about Stan
ford's ridiculous playing platform, a
small, undernourished barn which
loyal fans are forced to refer to
fondly as the Pavilion.
This Pavilion, seating a puny
2,800, is as sorry a place to put on
a cage eager as ever existed. If
you sit in the corner, you can't see
the -other corner. If you sit in the
grandstand, you play peek-a-boo
with the poles all night. And if
you linger over a last bite of din
ner, you don't even get into -the
place.

And as for the playing floor, it's
downright dangerous. If an eager
Steward drives hard on a fast break.

he has about a 50-50 chance of com
ing out alive. The distance between
the back-line and the first seats of
the gallery is far too short. Jack
O'Sullivan, Brave forward, became
the first casualty of this sort when
he tangled with a corner seat.
Needless to say, the corner seat
came out first best, and, Sully had
to use some catgut to sew the
nieces. It would be much nicer if
there were some adequate padding
to save the knees and ankles.
