## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 (£>).—
Steel-nerved Lloyd Mangrum, re
fusing to crack where others did,
launched golf's golden winter tour
today with a victory in the $15,000
Los Angeles Open.
The 34-year-old former United
States Open champion laced out a
steady one-under-par for a 72-hole
score of 284 to capture this 23rd
edition of the Los Angeles picture
by three strokes It was worth
$2,600 cash to him.
The win by Mangrum, a twice
decorated infantryman in the war,
ended a two-year domination of the
tournament by little Ben Hogan,
who wound up withe 292—a very
un-Hoganlike tally.

Low amateur honors went to
Frank Stranahan, the gifted muscle

boy from Toledo, Ohio, and Bruce
McCormick of Hollywood. They
were tied with 295.
E. J. (Dutch) Harrison of Little
Rock, whose handsome 69 set the
pace in the first round four days
ago, closed with a 71 for 287 and
second-place money of $1,900.
Tied one stroke behind Harrison
were Jimmy Demaret of Ojai, Calif.,
Eric Monti of Santa Monica, Calif.,
Billy Nary of Albuquerque, N.M.,
whose 67 was low score today, and
Lelancl Gibson of Kansas City,
whose 67 under extremely bad
weather conditions was perhaps the
finest round of the tournament.
Sam Snead made a bid but grew
as cold as the air around the Ri
viera Country Club and finished
with a 73 for 289.
