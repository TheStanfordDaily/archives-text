# Asiatic Student Views Stanford College Life

"Of course I like it," laughed Nasio Ahmed Farooki, when
asked if the United States and Stanford agreed with him. "I
wouldn't be here if i didn't."
Farooki, newly registered at the Farm this quarter, is a graduate
student in journalism. Before coming to Stanford he worked

several months for the New York
Herald-Tribune and for a while in
Connecticut. A correspondent for
the Pakistan Times, Farooki has
covered the national elections and
other current Western news lor his
'home town" paper.
He feels that New York is an ex
cellent spot from which to cover
rhe leading news events, and during
his stay there he sent back a quan
tity of information. He says he has
sent no news to Pakistan during the
last two weeks since he has been on
the West Coast, but may resume
correspondence during the next
week.
As do many other European and
Asiatic students, Farookn feels that
rhe attitude of American students
toward studying is very different
from that seen in universities
abroad. ''There." he says, ''a stu
dent would not just go on to col
lege because he was a good student
as you do here. Everybody has a
definite purpose in mind when he
goes to the university."
He commented also that many of
his friends from India here would
study much more conscientiously at
home, but at Stanford "are having
a good time like I am."
Farooki's preference for Stanford
over Columbia and other nationally
known universities came partly bo
cause of the fine journalism depart
ment here, but mainly because of
the many friends he has here. He
resides in the Village.
Previously Farooki studied at an
American university in Pakistan
which, he stated, is one of the finest
in all Asia. He mentioned many
outstanding American professors
who teach there.
Arriving in the United States only
last July, he was in India during the
recent trouble and unrest caused by
Great Britain's leaving and the en
suing political cleavage which led
to the establishment of Pakistan.
Farooki feels that the partition is
a definite step forward in Pakistan's
slow but sure progress. "Give them
another 15 years." he said, "and
they should emerge as a good so
cialistic state."
Returning to the problems of the
moment, Farooki commented as he
left the Journalism Building, "I
have to go take my physical exami
nation now."' Such is the life of a
new student at Stanford.
