# Dr. Simpson to Give Talk on Animal Fossils and Earth Changes Friday
## 
### 
A 'ecture on fossil remains of
prehistoric animals as clues to
physical changes in the earth will
be given by Dr. George Gaylord
Simpson at 8 p.m. Friday in Memo
rial hall.
Dr. Simpson is a professor of

mals in remote geological time, as
revealed by fossil lemains, has
added important evidence of physi
-1 cal change in the earth.
He will show how changes in
j basic conditions of the earth are
| reflected by evolution and dispersal
| of land animals. He will touch also
