# Robins Swim in Open Spot On Flimsy Lagunita Ice Coat
## 
### DALE CHAMPION 
Skating is poor and the ice is thin, but Lake
| Lagunita is almost completely covered with a
flimsy hall-inch-thick coating of ice.
No longer dry since recent storms ended the
drought and left a small pool of water on the

► Boathouse side of the lake bed, the
j surface of the lake has remained
: frozen over since the second phase
j of the "deep freeze" settled over all
I of California.
In one spot of water, free of ice,
; several hundred robins watered
| down, while four mallard ducks.
| safe from local hunters, gaily held
an aquatic workout.
Sliding on the iced-up surface of
the fountain in front of the dining
hall at Lagunita Court is a pleasant
after-lunch diversion for the girls
of Lagunita and Ventura. Two man
sized holes in the three-inch ice have
, aroused much speculation among the
i girls, but no one has as yet admitted
falling through the ice.
A boy at Toyon, holding to the
! Monday custom, did his washing
| early Monday morning. He was a
! little amazed, however, when he
found his handkerchiefs stiffening
almost as quickly as he hung them
on the clothes line.
A group of regularly spaced rusty
i pools of ice in the Toyon parking lot
| stand as evidence that many students
1 are draining their car radiators each
i of these cold nights.
Yesterday afternoon five members
I of The Daily staff made an expedi
| tion to Searsville Lake, where the
lowest temperature of the Bay Area
cold spell, 12 degrees, was recorded
Sunday night. The shallower end of
the lake is frozen over. A flock of
bewildered ducks scurried across the
surface of the ice in search of ice
free water.
Most Farm students have become
i adjusted to the abnormal weather
and have assumed the habit of dress
ing warmly in coats or pea-jackets
before leaving for Quad. Anti-freeze
and cracked blocks are standard ta
ble talk at meal-time. Stanford is
acclimatized.
