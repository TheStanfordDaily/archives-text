### JEAN MALTSELFF 
The Stanford Hoedowners are a
yroup of students who find that
folk-dancing is wonderful recrea
tion after a weary day of study.
The history of the folk dance
movement in California extends
hack only ten years and is now
centered in the Bay Area. The first
s«roup was formed in San Francisco.
By 1942 there were 10 groups pat
terned after the first. From these
10-groups, representing 200 people,
the Federation came into existence.
By July of last year the Federation
had grown to over 1-15 groups rep
resenting 20.000 folk dancers in
California.
The Stanford Hoedowners are
members of this Federation. The
Hoedowners learn dances stressed
by the Federation, which are a col
lection of some of the best dances
from almost every country in the
world.
The heart of the folk dance move
ment lies in the festivals held regu
larly during the year throughout
California, as well as in many other
stales which have joined the folk
dance movement. These festivals
usually have an attendance of from
500 to 3.000 Federation members

I who come in costumes, usually
home-made.
Last year, in July alone, nine fes
tivals were held in California. The
Stanford Hoedowners, who hold a
i festival on campus every spring,
have had as many as 2.000 partici
pants.
