# 'The Hairy Ape' Opens Jan. 26
## 
### 
The popular, versatile "The Hairy
Ape by Eugene O'Neill moved into
iis third week of production today,
with the opening of a four-night run
.set for Jan. 2G in the Little Theater.
Tickets for the play, which are ex
pected to sel! out early today, are
on sale for GO cents in room 202,
Memorial Hall.
Student director E. R. Brown an
nounced a last-minute change in
cast. Allen Fletcher, director of
"Antigone" this year, will take a
minor role. Morgan Stock will ap
pear as a German stoker.
The expressionistic drama is based
on a stoker worker in the hold of a
ship who identifies himelf with the
stee! in the ship as a symbol of
the power which he creates. How
ever, he comes to realize that the
steel is really made by the rich
owner of the steel plant, and the
steel becomes symbolic to him of
a cage from which he cannot es
cape.
His struggle is to belong, but his
mental capacity is such that he
cannot rise above manual labor.
The story moves very rapidly
through the eight scenes, no scene
lasting over 15 minutes. The mo
mentum of the story has been com
pared to a train at the top of an
incline which, when let loose, tears
to the finish.
The scenes move from the dark
stoker pit, to the luxury of an
ocean-going liner, to the artificial
ity of Fifth Avenue. Through each
scene the leading character is shad
owed by the problem of stoker.
In expressionistic tragedies the
audience does not worry about the
fate of the leading role, but O'Neill,
by virtue of his own style, creates
sympathy in the story.
Since its birth in 1922. "The
Hairy Ape" has been widely pro
duced both in Europe, in the East,
and on the American continent.
