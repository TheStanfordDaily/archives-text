# KSU Celebrates Second Birthday; Efficiency Replaces Early Blunders

"I wouldn't say the transmitters wouldn't work. It just sounded
like hell," remarked one of KSU's charter members, referring to
Stanford's first radio program.
With only five minutes to spare between getting these trans
mitters haphazardly installed and the first scheduled radio pro-

gram on the air, KSU. 880 on Your
Dial, was born.
This quarter marks KSU's second
anniversary. In just two years it has
developed into the largest commer
cial college station in the Southwest,
sporting a newly remodeled studio
and offices, their own equipment,
and a remote unit capable of broad
casting from almost any place on
campus. KSU has recently become
the Southwest regional office for the
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System.
Studio in Army Booth
These up-to-date facilities are in
contrast to the borrowed control
panel and two rickety second hand
turntables which supplied KSU's
first studio at the Village. The stu
dio was an old army booth, located
uncomfortably near the frequently
noisy assembly hall.
Er—Ah—Uh
Many of the early programs were
transcribed and it was one of these
transcribed records which didn't
turn up on time —a fact discovered
just before program time—that
caused confusion for the inexpe
rienced announcer. An engineer
burst in with the record just as the
befuddled announcer was saying,
"Due to circumstances beyond our
control, the program originally
scheduled for this time —er —ah—uh
—will now be heard."
A religious transcription was used
a'su and it was the habit of the an
nouncers to go out for coffee during
this program. Much to their sur
prise and embarrassment, they re
turned one night to find the needle
stuck at "Jesu-- Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ—."
Crossed Wires
"Strictly From Hunger," "Path
way to Passion," the controversial

, "Some Like it Hot," the "Your
Clothes Closet" fiasco, and "Stanford
: Sadie" were among the first out
standing KSU programs. Poetry
used to be read over KSU. too. That
is. until a (iustered participant
turned '"Keats and Shelley" into
"Sheets and Kelly."
A milestone in KSU history was
a certain broadcast of the Tuesday
Evening Series. It seems the wires
got crossed and the piercing notes
j of "Elks Parade" drowned out the
perturbed speaker in Mem Aud.
Remote Programs
Then there was the first dance re
mote program. The dance was spon-
I sored by the fire department which
disappeared just before broadcast
time to fight a smoke bomb in En
cina. This fact, together with equip
ment difficulties, postponed the orig-
I inal 9 to 10 p.m. show to 10:23.
The opening theme, part of a num
ber by the dance band, and the clos
ing theme constituted the live
minute program.
The "Tail of the Golden Bear,"
better known to the KSU staff as
"Operation Toadstool." was one of
the outstanding KSU stunts. Sev
eral staff members crashed the Cal
campus in order to g«?t this show
which consisted of interviews oi Cal
students. Posing as the new Cal
station, previously announced in the
Cal Dailv, KSU broadcast as KSU -C.

Stanford's first radio program.
With only five minutes to spare between getting these trans
mitters haphazardly installed and the first scheduled radio pro-

gram on the air, KSU. 880 on Your
Dial, was born.
This quarter marks KSU's second
anniversary. In just two years it has
developed into the largest commer
cial college station in the Southwest,
sporting a newly remodeled studio
and offices, their own equipment,
and a remote unit capable of broad
casting from almost any place on
campus. KSU has recently become
the Southwest regional office for the
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System.
Studio in Army Booth
These up-to-date facilities are in
contrast to the borrowed control
panel and two rickety second hand
turntables which supplied KSU's
first studio at the Village. The stu
dio was an old army booth, located
uncomfortably near the frequently
noisy assembly hall.
Er—Ah—Uh
Many of the early programs were
transcribed and it was one of these
transcribed records which didn't
turn up on time —a fact discovered
just before program time—that
caused confusion for the inexpe
rienced announcer. An engineer
burst in with the record just as the
befuddled announcer was saying,
"Due to circumstances beyond our
control, the program originally
scheduled for this time —er —ah—uh
—will now be heard."
A religious transcription was used
a'su and it was the habit of the an
nouncers to go out for coffee during
this program. Much to their sur
prise and embarrassment, they re
turned one night to find the needle
stuck at "Jesu-- Christ, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ—."
Crossed Wires
"Strictly From Hunger," "Path
way to Passion," the controversial

, "Some Like it Hot," the "Your
Clothes Closet" fiasco, and "Stanford
: Sadie" were among the first out
standing KSU programs. Poetry
used to be read over KSU. too. That
is. until a (iustered participant
turned '"Keats and Shelley" into
"Sheets and Kelly."
A milestone in KSU history was
a certain broadcast of the Tuesday
Evening Series. It seems the wires
got crossed and the piercing notes
j of "Elks Parade" drowned out the
perturbed speaker in Mem Aud.
Remote Programs
Then there was the first dance re
mote program. The dance was spon-
I sored by the fire department which
disappeared just before broadcast
time to fight a smoke bomb in En
cina. This fact, together with equip
ment difficulties, postponed the orig-
I inal 9 to 10 p.m. show to 10:23.
The opening theme, part of a num
ber by the dance band, and the clos
ing theme constituted the live
minute program.
The "Tail of the Golden Bear,"
better known to the KSU staff as
"Operation Toadstool." was one of
the outstanding KSU stunts. Sev
eral staff members crashed the Cal
campus in order to g«?t this show
which consisted of interviews oi Cal
students. Posing as the new Cal
station, previously announced in the
Cal Dailv, KSU broadcast as KSU -C.
