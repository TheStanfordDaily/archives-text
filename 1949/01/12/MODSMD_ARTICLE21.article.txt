## Appeasementâ€”1949 
### 
In a recent article in Life magazine, Jay Franklin, one of the
authors of Harry Truman's recent campaign speeches, discussed
the new foreign policy of the administration.
His statement indicated that the reverse would be in the
form of a get-soft-with-Russia policy. He attacked the interests
of big business which, through Secretary Forrestal, were re- j
sponsible for the present foreign policy of the United States.
Despite the denial by the President, the predictions of Mr. j
Franklin seem to be correct. The recent resignations of both
Secretary of State Marshall and Undersecretary Lovett and the
appointment of Dean Acheson to the top cabinet post indicate
the State Department will not continue its present policy in regard
to the Soviet Union.
As Mr. Franklin pointed out, it was Secretary Marshall and
the State Department who so vigorously opposed the sending
of Chief Justice Vinson to Moscow to meet with the Russian
leaders in an attempt to end the Cold War.
Also substantiating this position are the expected resigna
tions of Secretaries Forrestal of Defense and Krug of the Interior.
Secretary Forrestal has long been a champion of the get-tough
with Russia policy. Mr. Franklin stated that the recent upset
election had shown that the American people wanted to end the
monopoly by big business of American foreign policy repre
sented by the Secretary of Defense.
Should this foreign policy of appeasement be put into effect,
it would actually be an acceptance of the program formulated
by Henry Wallace and his so-called Progressive Party.
If there was any mandate of the people against big business,
the low vote that was received by Henry Wallace and his var
ious candidates for local offices should indicate that the Ameri
can people want none of the type of foreign policy that left
them so hopelessly unprepared for World War 11.
Most historians agree that a little get-tough policy with Japan,
Germany, and Italy in the early days of their imperialist-minded
regimes might have averted the last war.
Such a new policy would not only cost the Western powers
all they had gained in keeping Russia from further expansion,
but would be selling out the democratic elements in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and the Balkan countries now under Soviet
domination.
The administration should recognize that the bipartisan for
eign policy was not an issue in the campaign between the Re
publicans and Democrats. The Wallace group received surpris
ingly few votes with its appeal for peace through appeasement.
