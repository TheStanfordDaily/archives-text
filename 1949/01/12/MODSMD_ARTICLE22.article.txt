Send Magazines Abroad
To the Editor:
A radio commentator, Mr. Elmer Peterson, is advocating as a method of
better acquainting others with America, the sending of old magazines j
abroad. He has pointed out that American reading matter is received
eagerly by the Europeans. That foreigners are apt to accept as true ma
terial intended to be read by Americans, while they are distrustful of |
American prepared material specifically designed for them. That illus- j
trated magazines would serve the purpose best, but all magazines, particu
larly those with colorful advertisements, are worth sending.
Could not one of the lIR committees put this idea into operation? An i
lIR committee undoubtedly has the means of accomplishing the details, ,
such as the collecting of magazines from the various living groups, the
establishing of a collection point for the old magazines of the off campus j
students, the selection of a foreign university to which to send the maga- |
zines, and so on.
If this worthwhile project has been adopted already and I but have
failed to hear of it, this should indicate that there has been a deficiency
of publicity.
