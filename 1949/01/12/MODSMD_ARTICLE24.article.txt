# Variety — The Spice Of Life

Are you with us or agin us? Per- I
taining to free love, that is.
An alleged expert on feminine j
psychology swears that women are |
more inclined to polygamy than |
men are. I demand equal rights for '
men. I don't think we men are so j
blase as all that.
Uphold Polygamy
There is a point in their favor, j
though. The women of Arabia are
battling savagely for their rights.
These formerly downtrodden crea
tures are now taking up the cry for :
female suffrage, the right to run for ,
office, and so on. That's OK. But
in that country polygamy flour- !
ishes . . . and they DON'T want it
taken away. I suppose that they are
going on the assumption that half
or even a third of a husband is
better than none.
Some woman wrote a hot letter |
to one columnist on the subject.
She doesn't believe that any women I
like polygamy, though she does ad
mit that "way down in their hearts I
many WIVES crave additional |
MASCULINE company."
'"Few if any men are sufficiently ;
versatile to be the absorbing inter- I
est at all times," she says. "But
the very thought of having a house j
all cluttered up with three hus
bands demanding attention and
services at the same time is enough
to make any married woman shud
der."
300 Sinning Wives
Of course, I think a good thing
can be carried too far. The Em
pero Morho-Naba of Ouagadougou
in French West Africa is obliged—
OBLIGED, mind your —to marry
every woman of his kingdom who
has committed sin. He has married
300 sinners, and the harem grows
larger every year. They say vari
ety is the spice of life.
A lesser light, but still a man to
be reckoned with, is the Fon, chief
of the Bikom tribe of the British
Cameroons. A complaint reached
the U.S. that he had 600 wives.
Britain says it isn't so. He only has
110. The British condone this bit
of lawlessness because "these prac-
I tices are based on the strongest su
t perstitious belief."
Recently (192(5, thai is) Turkey
abolished polygamy. This made it
I the lone country of some 15 com
i posed almost wholly of Mohamme
i dans where the menfolk aren't al
! lowed four legal wives and an un
limited number of concubines. By
their Bible, the Koran, this has been
law for 1.300 years. Why change
now?
Escape
Here's satire for you. Modesto
| Virgin, a Mexican rancher, lived in
j the same house with 11 wives and
I 44 children. The poor lad has been
j luckier, however, since then (1907).
j He's dead.
j Naturally polygamy isn't un
i known in the U.S. Only over in
■ Fresno a 24-year-old named Fran
cis J. Bressi told the DA that he
j "appealed to the motherly instinct
Jin women." That's why he hnd
I married ten women in the last five
j years.
But that isn't as bad as a boy in
I Vienna who pleaded for clemency
} in the court on the grounds that he
! just had a poor memory.
After all is said and done per
haps it's true that a person can't be
; happy with multiple wives . . . but
| I'd sure die trying. And what a
I glorious way to die!
