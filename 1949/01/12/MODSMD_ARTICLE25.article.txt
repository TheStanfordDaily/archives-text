## Bull Session

I have been asked by my commanding officer of the Stanford Battery
oi the 40th Division of the California National Guard to get some publicity
for the Guard in an appropriate page in The Daily.
NG, which does not only sometimes stand lor No Good, but sometimes

for National Guard—especially when there's an inspec
tion—is a good deal for all you draft-dod— for all you
intelligent students who can see the advantages of
uninterruptedly finishing your education free yf the
possibility of being dra— of having a man-made Act
of God interfere.
Please do not let any typographical errors make
felt the imputation to you that the 40 Farm Roughs- -
including one-sixth of the football team—who are
NG members, are callow, unprincipled evaders of tht.ii
national duty. Exactly the reverse. For, as our beer
drinking son goes (sung to the. tunc of Tschaikowsky's

Fifth):
We are the boys of the National Guard,
In case of invasion we arc mean and>hard.
In case of quick landings on that Bay Shore
Our quick repulsiveness will go down in folk lore.
If the Reds land on the West Coast
With our GI cigarette lighters them we'll make toast
Yessiree, you said it! That's our boast—
The California National Guard will never give up the ghost!
(Why fight it? I've got so much more than Shelley ever had.)
Advantage of joining the NG: free beer every Monday night for two
hours; see movies such as "How to Camouflage San Francisco to Look
Like Los Angeles" .... "Every citizen from two on up will smoke an
El Ropo Cigar for three hours."
Via theoretical conversations we learn how to fire 40 mm. anti-aircraft
guns. The request of the Stanford Flying Club to have us roll our 40 mms.
down to the Santa Clara Valley Airport before the next. Cal-Stanford
flying contest and to use great specificity and discrimination in our target
practice intrigues us all. A requisition sent to Sacramento for ammuni
tion may not be signed inasmuch as Governor Warren is a Cal graduate.
If your independent answers to the questions of entrance below are
identical with the expected answers also below, you. are typical cannon
fod — uh, ather typically fine recruit material.
Q. Which way do you point an anti-aircraft gun to fire it up?
A. Depends on whether the gun crew uses airwick in the gun pits or
under the arm pits.
Q. What's the difference between the NG and the Girl Scouts?
A. You can have more fun in the Girl Scouts.
Q. If you were called in as a strikebreaker, what would be your duty?
A. Join the C.1.0.
Q. What would you do if an enemy invaded the West Coast?
A. Move to the East Coast.
Now, seriously, you Stanford stalwarts, if you want a really good deal,
and have got nothing to do Monday nights, do it in the National Guard!
