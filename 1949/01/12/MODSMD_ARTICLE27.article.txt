BERKELEY, Jan. 11 (TP).-Want
to take a 2,200-mile hike?
Joseph C. Wampler of Berkeley is
making plans for an expedition that
will walk along the Sierra Nevada
and Cascade mountain ranges from
Mexico to Canada.
No one has ever made the trip
before, Wampler says.
He wants to take along 10 or 15
city folk who are tired of smog and
traffic. It'll cost $1,000 a person for
the six-month walk and climb.
That's figuring it close, he says,
but Wampler thinks the $1,000 will
just about cover the cost of the
food and other necessities that will
have to be carried to the party by
truck and pack train.
Wampler plans to leave Campo,
Calif., a small community on the
Mexican border, about April 1. He
says the group will travel 15 or 1G
miles a day and arrive at Blaine.
Wash., in early October.
There's one thing Wampler does
n't understand.
"More than half the people who
want to go arc women," he said. *'I
guess women are just more inter
ested in the rugged life than men."
