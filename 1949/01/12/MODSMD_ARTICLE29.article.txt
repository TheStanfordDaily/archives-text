"Humans just ain't human."
That must be the thought in the
mind of Black Bart, a frisky little
bear cub who begins a long trek
from here to Chicago tomorrow.
Bart, who probably never bet on
anything in his life, is being sent,
to Mayor Martin Kennealy of Chi
cago by Hizzoner Elmer Robinston
of San Francisco as the payoff on
a Rose Bowl bet between the two.
Robinson wagered a bear. And
the Windy City mayor staked a pig
on the game. The University of Cal
ifornia—Robinson's team—lost.
Robinson agreed to trade some
animal in his city's zoo for a bear
cub out of the Sacramento me
nagerie.
Since Northwestern beat Cal two
weeks ano. Chicago newspapers and
citizenry have been accusing Robin
son of reneging on the bet. But
Robinson had his own troubles get
ting a bear--or at least that was his
defense. His own zoo could not
spare one. So he finally made the
swap deal with City Manager Bait
ley Cavanaugh of this city.
