# UNESCO to Describe Tomorrow Program for International Living
## 
### 
What has proved to be one of the
most unique and worthwhile stu
dent contributions to international
peace will be explained to inter
ested Stanford students tomorrow
afternoon on the third floor of the
Women's Clubhouse. The meeting
begin at 4:15 and is jointly
sponsored by Council for UNESCO
and the YWCA.
Since its beginning in 1932, hun
dreds of American college students
have traveled abroad to participate
in what they call an '"Experiment
in International Living."
But instead of squeezing all of
Europe or South America into a
few weeks of hasty sightseeing, as
most Americans insist on doing,
few of those "experimenters" vis
ited more than one country. Their
theory is that only by actually liv
ing in a country and learning the
customs and language of its people
can that country be really under
stood.
Students who have taken part in
the program have each spent sev
eral weeks in bicycling and hiking
through the particula country of
their choice.' More important, they
have all been guests for a number
of weeks in the home of an aver
age middle-class family, speaking
their language, eating at their table,
and following their customs. Par
ticipants in the experiment hope to
thus lessen the misunderstandings
that exist between Americans and
the people of other countries.
"And it really works," says Lynn
Sherwood, transfer student from
Vassar, who took part in the po
g,am last summer. "From what I've
seen, the experiment has done a
deal to counteract the preju
dices that many foreigners feel to
ward Americans."
"It's gotten to the point that I
even hate to use the word 'foreign
er' any more," added Bob Land
wehr, formerly of the University
of Chicago. Bob spent ten weeks
in Denmark last summer living with
a Copenhagen harbor engineer and
his family.
"Instead of passing critical judg
ment on another culture," he ex
plained, "we tried to foster a kin
ship between us and the people
with whom we associated."
Only recently has the idea spread
to the West Coast area, and direc
tors of the plan are anxious to have
participants from all parts of the
country. Expenses have been re
duced to a minimum, eight- to ten
week stays in Europe costing from
S6OO to $7OO. The Mexican visit will
cost approximately $450.
Only a portion of the persons
apply to take part in the "ex
periment" are accepted, however.

Two years of language study are
required in order to be selected for
travel in most of the countries, and
students must first prove their in
terest and ability before they are
accepted into the program.
Further details of the "experi
ment" and a movie, "Where Peace
Begins," will be provided at the
meeting tomorrow. In addition,
students who have already taken
part in the program will offer fur
ther information.
Part of the meeting will be de
moted to an explanation of Inter
national Service Seminars.

Service Seminars will be pub

ing in a country and learning the
customs and language of its people
can that country be really under
stood.
Students who have taken part in
the program have each spent sev
eral weeks in bicycling and hiking
through the particula country of
their choice.' More important, they
have all been guests for a number
of weeks in the home of an aver
age middle-class family, speaking
their language, eating at their table,
and following their customs. Par
ticipants in the experiment hope to
thus lessen the misunderstandings
that exist between Americans and
the people of other countries.
"And it really works," says Lynn
Sherwood, transfer student from
Vassar, who took part in the po
g,am last summer. "From what I've
seen, the experiment has done a
deal to counteract the preju
dices that many foreigners feel to
ward Americans."
"It's gotten to the point that I
even hate to use the word 'foreign
er' any more," added Bob Land
wehr, formerly of the University
of Chicago. Bob spent ten weeks
in Denmark last summer living with
a Copenhagen harbor engineer and
his family.
"Instead of passing critical judg
ment on another culture," he ex
plained, "we tried to foster a kin
ship between us and the people
with whom we associated."
Only recently has the idea spread
to the West Coast area, and direc
tors of the plan are anxious to have
participants from all parts of the
country. Expenses have been re
duced to a minimum, eight- to ten
week stays in Europe costing from
S6OO to $7OO. The Mexican visit will
cost approximately $450.
Only a portion of the persons
apply to take part in the "ex
periment" are accepted, however.

Two years of language study are
required in order to be selected for
travel in most of the countries, and
students must first prove their in
terest and ability before they are
accepted into the program.
Further details of the "experi
ment" and a movie, "Where Peace
Begins," will be provided at the
meeting tomorrow. In addition,
students who have already taken
part in the program will offer fur
ther information.
Part of the meeting will be de
moted to an explanation of Inter
national Service Seminars.
(An article on the International
Service Seminars will be pub
lished in tomorrow's Daily.) ,
What has proved to be one of the
most unique and worthwhile stu
dent contributions to international
peace will be explained to inter
ested Stanford students tomorrow
afternoon on the third floor of the
Women's Clubhouse. The meeting
begin at 4:15 and is jointly
sponsored by Council for UNESCO
and the YWCA.
Since its beginning in 1932, hun
dreds of American college students
have traveled abroad to participate
in what they call an '"Experiment
in International Living."
But instead of squeezing all of
Europe or South America into a
few weeks of hasty sightseeing, as
most Americans insist on doing,
few of those "experimenters" vis
ited more than one country. Their
theory is that only by actually liv
ing in a country and learning the
customs and language of its people
can that country be really under
stood.
