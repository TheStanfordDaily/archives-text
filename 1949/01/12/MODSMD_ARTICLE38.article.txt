# Nine Bouts To Be Featured On Friday Night Fight Card
## 
### 
Nine bouts will be featured on
Friday night's sterling fistic festival
when Stanford Coach Ray Lunny's
ring-wise troops slug it out with
the invading ringsters of Cal Poly
technic.
Square-off time has been set
8:15 at the Pavilion.
The Poly's will have only one
heavyweight ready for competition;
and either Mike Pelsinger or
Charles Brown will represent the
Indians in the battle of the big boys.
Jim Vatcher, another lad previously
counted on by Lunny as a heavy
weight prospect, has trained clown
below the 175-pound limit and will
be doing his scrapping this season
from the light-heavyweight slot.
Top man for the Cards in the
light-heavy division is Jarring Jim
Hammond; and since Cal Pojy is
expected to enter only one 175-
pounder in Friday night's slugfesf,
Vatcfcer will probably not see any
action this week.

Another possible disappointment
for Farm fight fans was disclosed
by the announcement that the lads
from San Luis Obispo might not
include any 165-pounders in their
invading contingent. This would
mean that speedy Fred Ten Eyck,
a clever boxer who was undefeated
all of last season, would also be
watching the proceedings from a
ringside perch.
Veteran Wooly Altus, a three
year varsity veteran, will definitely
do duty at the Pavilion at 155
pounds; Jay Savage and Jose Rael
will carry the Indian lightweight
banner; and Bob Hudson will do
the swinging and swaying in the
145-pound division.
