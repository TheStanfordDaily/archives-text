# Yardley Back in Form; Rose Still Out As Cards Concentrate on Making Points
## 
### JOHN HALL 
George Yardley, the battling
blond from Balboa, was back
in top form yesterday after
noon, as he and his varsity
mates began preparation for the
coming series with California's
cellar-dwelling Golden Bears.
Stanford, whipped down a peg by
SC's Trojans, will take on Califor
nia next* weekend in the first Big
Basketball Series of the year. Fri
day night it's at Berkeley and Sat
urday night the clubs will take over
the Pavilion.
Things began to pop yesterday in
the Pavil on as the Indian hoop spe
cialists went to work, hoping to rid
themselves of the miseries which
overcame them last weekend.
Elastic Band for George
Best news of all was that Big
George Yardley would return to
action. Yardley, who was injured
during the UCLA game last Friday
night, has completely shaken off the
soreness in his knee. He will be
wearing an elastic band around his
bad knee for the next few weeks,
but only for added protection.
Bad news to subtract from the
good word on Yardley was brought
out when it was learned that Bill
Rose will not be eligible for at
least three more weeks.
Rose, who was reported to be "in
eligible due to an academic condi
tion," must wait three weeks until
he can take a test to remove the
condition. In that time, Stanford
will meet California twice, USF,
, Santa Clara, San Jose State, Pitts
burgh, and CCNY.
Iverson Takes Over
Filling in for Rose is the able Milt
Iverson, who started the weekend
games against USC and UCLA.
Iverson, 6-1, is fast and aggressive,
but with Rose gone the position
lacks depth.
Other injuries suffered over the
first weekend of conference ball
have shaped up pretty well. Re

serve guard Jack Scharfen, who
was on crutches Saturday night,
suited up yesterday afternoon to
run through defensive plays.
Jack O'Sullivan, also put out of
action with *a leg injury, was back
on the floor, adding a little luster to
Everett Dean's fast break.
Put-the-Ball-in-Bueket Week
It was put-the-ball-in-the-buck
et week over at the -Pavilion" yester
day afternoon, as Coaches Everett
Dean and Bobby Burnett started
sending their charges through ex
tensive drills.
Last night's workout was devoted
mainly to offense, with both the fast
break and the slow break being on
the bill of fare.
George Yard'ey and Milt Iverson
worked the forwards. Bill Stephen
son was at center, and Bob Lewis
and Marv Gelber handled the guard
spots.
Dave Davidson, held up at an
afternoon lab session, and Ralph
Carver, second center, were not

able to make the pi'actice. Carver
is looking better right now than
ever before. Against UCLA he
demonstrated that he has scoring
potentialities by dropping in a flashy
hook-shot and a back-door, under
the-basket lay-up.
Bill Lewis Working Well
Bill Lewis, who will be backing
up Iverson at the forward spot, is
looking to be in top form. Lewis
dumped in a couple of long shots
against the Trojans, and expects-to
see more action against California.
He has always been a smooth
ball-handler and sharpshooter, and
with a little more seasoning
add a needed lift to the forward"*
corps.
Reports from Berkeley have it
that all the tickets have already
been sold for Friday night's clash
in the Berkeley gym. It looks as if
the spirit will be running high next
weekend when the Indians go out
to avenge themselves for a certain
matter that occurred during the
PCC Tounament.


RALPH CARVER, fast-improving
Stanford reserve center, is expected
to give a good account of
himself against the California
Bears this weekend. Ralph, who
found the scoring range against
UCLA Friday night, will ably
back up Captain Bill Stephenson
at the pivot position.
