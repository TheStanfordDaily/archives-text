NCAA Rules Committee Hears Arguments;
Trend Is Toward Mass Grid Substitutions
The nation's football coaches and NGAA representatives have given
over the winter meeting spotlight to the latters' rules committee which
is meeting in Palm Springs to pass upon the rule changes suggested by
the coaches.
Many words have been written, pro and con, about the need for chang
ing the "free substitution" rule. The upshot of the whole thing is that
the fans are probably going to see a different kind of specialization, but
specialization anyway.
Ode of the changes under scrutiny by the rules corhmittee will allow
a team to substitute up to a full team every time the ball changes hands
but eliminates substitution of single players while the clock is running.
This rule, in effect, will do away with the boy kept on the team only
for his punting ability. The coach will not be able to send in his kicker
for a fourth-down effort unless the clock is stopped or there has been
an injury.
Coaches can, and many probably will, train a "platoon" in just one
phase of the game. We will see more teams run along the line of Earl
Blaik's Army squad. Army had a team for defense and one for offense;
the Cadets could only put in the other team when the clock was not
running. This necessitated taking a time out or waiting until the clock
was stopped by an incompleted pass or the like.
'Platoon' System Will Become More Evident
Some coaches may go whole hog and train the two teams separately
with coaches for each group. Group A will be the offensive squad and
will practice only on that part of the game. Group B, knowing that they
will not have to learn offensive plays, will practice defensive formations
exclusively. It may reach the stage where a player from Group A will have
but a nodding acquaintance with a member of Group B; for, although
they are nrembers of the same team, they meet only on Saturdays as one
replaces the other on the field.
That's carrying the story a little too far, but that is the trend. Even
Cal tried to substitute by "squads" and they were. But
schools bich in material can actually hold practices as I have described
above.
It has been argued that this rule change will do away with the "one
play player"—the boy who can catch a certain pass or run a certain play
better than others, or kick farther and better than the other men on his
squad. This player, it is thought, will have to develop himself into a
better all-around performer so as to merit a place on the "platoon" that
is sent into tire game when his team goes on offense or defense.
It is assumed that point-after-touchdown specialists will not be affected
for time is out after the touchdown anyway.
Proponents for the new rule, Lou Little of Columbia being the chief
one, further argue that it will put the game into the hands of the players
and take it away from the coaches. The coach will not longer be able to
send in a man between downs to call a certain play.
New Rule Will Be Easier 011 Fans Anyway
Then, too, the rule will eliminate the confusion of men running off .and
on the field between plays. Joe Fan is supposed to be able to look at his
urogram when the ball changes hands, note the new men, and settle back
for at least four downs of unsubstituted play—unless, of course, the coach
substitutes when the clock is stopped.
That, in sum and substance, is one of the rules that will probably be
passed. It has met with the satisfaction of most of the coaches. Certainly
something had to be done to curb the practice of too many substitutions
too often.
I feel that the rule is probably the best that could have been expected;
but it leaves a lot to be desired. The trend is toward more substituting—
"Let more boys play the game"—but there is another side to the question.
The 60-minute man is about to become obsolete—if. indeed, he has not
already become so. Regardless what coaches do and say, most players
will feel that there is need for conditioning themselves for a full 60
minutes of football. Unless a man is very good, or unless the squad just
doesn't have the players, the coach will have to change his personnel
around during the game to keep up with the onslaught of fresh men that
his opponent may throw at him.
There has not been, and certainly will not be, any true All-American
teams after this year. Pickers will have to choose, as one did this year,
an offensive and a defensive team. And that certainly is a far cry from
the All-American teams of years past.
Marchie Vetoes the Reverse Center Rule
Marchie Schwartz echoes the thought expressed by a San Francisco
sports writer on the "reversed center" rule. The Marchmont thinks the
rule has little chance of passing the rules committee because of the con
fusion it would cause. The center is part of a seven-man line. By turning
hint around so that he would face his own backfield he would, in effect
become another backfield man and the problems arising therefrom would
be many and varied.
The officials are having a hard time keeping up with the game as it is
(the writer's opinion, not Mr. Schwartz's), and it would place quite an
added burden on the head linesman to determine if the center stepped
out of the line before, as, or after he centered the ball.
But, Oh! the possibilities of offensive action that would come abou'
with the reversed center. He could pass to the man in motion or to the
f'tf back and then receive the ball back again and throw a pass—there
*be so many uses to which he could be put But then, offense is
three or four touchdowns ahead of defense as it is.
