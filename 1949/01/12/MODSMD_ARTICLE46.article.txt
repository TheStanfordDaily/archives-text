PALM SPRINGS, Jan, 11 (£>).—
The National Collegiate Football
Rules Committee today got down
to a belated start in its annual pow
wow over grid regulations for 1949.
Chairman William J. Bingham of
Harvard counted cold noses today,
however, and found the group as
sembled and ready for business.
Sessions are held behind closed
doors, and little official word was
forthcoming at the initial discus
ions.
Recodification of the rules, which
hasn't been done since 1928, was
one of the opening topics.
But more lively debate, according
to Chairman Bingham, was in store

on th'e controversial '"free substi
tution'' rule.
Players and coaches, in particu
lar, favor the rule which permit
almost unlimited substitutions aur
: ng a pame. But opponents, inelvr 3
ing a heavy segment of fans, de
plore this as <: push button" tactics
by the coaches from the bench and
argue that it reduces football to a
game of specialists.
With such noted exponents of the
two-platoon system as Athletic Di
rector Fritz Crisler of Michigan and
Wallace Wade of Duke on the com
mittee, some observers see scant
chance for much modification —if
any—in the present role.
