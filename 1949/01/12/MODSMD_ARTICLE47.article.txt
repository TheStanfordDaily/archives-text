# Grapplers Open Against California Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
Stanford's grapplers will open the
1949 season when they meet the
California mat squad at Berkeley
tomorrow night at 7:30.
The Indians will have an expe
rience edge on their foes, but the
greater training period of the Bears
plus their unbounded manpower
available for the mat wars makes
the match a toss-up.
The Card team will have letter
men in seven of the eight weight
divisions, with Dick Esbenshade,
Dick Cruce, Vern Jones, Dan Win
ston, Jim Kurfess, Roy Gaskin, and
Jack White scheduled to try for
varsity berths again.
On the other hand the Bears have
lost a good share of their 1848 Pa
cific Coast champion squad. The
California team will undoubtedly
miss such star performers as Hugh
Mumby and Harold Christiansen,
Far Western and Pacific Coast Col
legiate champions in their respec
tive weights last year, but is re
building with lettermen Carter,
Bunge, and Hanson as the basis of
the present team.
What happens on the mat Thurs
day night will be largely deter
mined by the extent to which the
Indian matmen h&ve been able to
whip themselves in shape in the
short practice period since Christ
mas vacation.
