(Ed. note: This is the second in
a series of three articles on the :
Honor Code. The series will he j
concluded on Friday.)
After the Honor Code adopted by
the Law School proved successful,
other departments began to intro
duce honor systems. However, a
-etback came in 1915 when students j
in the history department failed to i
support the movement.
Many students and faculty mem- ,
bers continued to push the plan, j
•ind in 1921 the returning war vet- J
-vans began to show resentment to- j
ward the apparent "lack of faith" !
by proctors in examinations,
veterans condemned the
amount of cheating poing on at that
''me, end agreed that an Honor
Co J e was the only answer to the
problem.
In A"ril of 1921 the Stanford ll
histrated p eview printe J a comnar-
; 'on of Harvard's proctoring system
■ nd Honor Co''c in use at
Princeton, declaring that "the rroc
oring system keeps the students |

; hottest, while the Honor Code I
I makes them honest."
The Review, stressing the sue- i
| cess which various Stanford de
i partments had with the Code, is- :
sued a vigorous call for the adop- j
t'on of the system throughout the [
University.
Finally, on May 24, 192J, the
| Daily Palo Alto, forerunner of the
| Stanford Daily, announced:
"The Stanford faculty, acting
j upon a petition from the students,
has approved the plan for an honor j
j system in examinations throughout
| the University. The honor system ;
| will be nut into effect in the final j
examinations of the present quar- i
ter in July."
In essence, this act meant that the ;
instructors would leave examina- I
tion rooms after issuing the exam j
paners, and that cheating would be ;
reoorted by the students them- i
selves. Thus, the responsibility for
honorable conduct rested wholly
upon the students.
Charges of violations would he
I heard and tried by student commit

tees elected by the student body.
Judgments could be appealed to
the president of the University, who
would automatically review any
sentence calling for expulsion of the
violator from the school.
In 1924 the Honor Code came
under fire when the Daily Palo Alto
reported that instructors were
turning in more violations than
were the students, going on to tell
how the system had been abandoned
at the University of Illinois. Fortu
nate'y, however, the spirit of the
Honor Co-'e began to pervade the
campus and the storm was weath
ered.
On the success of the Honor Code
at Stan r ord, Dr. Pay Lymrn Wil
bur, present chancellor of the Uni
versity, stated:
"The Honor System worked be
cause it was a system with a sys
tem. The Code would hpvc failed if
the initiative hpd not been placed
on the student. With'n the resulting
-Welooment of mental character
lies the system's strength."
