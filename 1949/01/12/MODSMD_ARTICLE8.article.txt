# Record-Breaking Snowfall Blankets Sunshine State
## West Continues Shivering As Heat Wave Hits South 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Winter draped a 1,000-mile long blanket of
ice across the nation's midriff Tuesday and bur
ied Southern California under probably the
worst snow cover in its history.
And to round out its antics, it kept much of

the Southeast sizzling in a "heat
wave."
The ice sheath extended from
Western Oklahoma to Eastern Illi
nois. In some areas it blacked out
towns, snapped communications lines
and forced school closings. High
way travel was hazardous through
out the entire section.
As a winter playground, the Los
Angeles area looked more like St.
Moritz. Snow up to six inches deep
covered several suburban communi
ties. More than two inches carpeted
Pasadena's Colorado Boulevard,
where the Tournament of Roses was
staged less than two weeks ago.
It snowed long, and plenty in
Southern California yesterday. And
there's moi'e of the unfamiliar stuff
in store, the weather man says.
Up to a foot blanketed foothill
communities ringing Los Angeles at
dawn. Wide-eyed youngsters, fa
miliar with what it looks like only
from Christmas cards or glimpses of
distant mountains, soon learned to
make snow men.
