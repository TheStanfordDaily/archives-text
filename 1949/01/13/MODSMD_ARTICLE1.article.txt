# Request For Open Houses Turned Down
## 
### 
In response to the cries of Encina
ites for another all-fraternity open
house before the end of formal rush
ing Jan. 22, Ted LeVino, Interlra-
Urnity Council president, brought
forth an answer yesterday.
"In effect," LeVino said, "it is im
possible for the fraternities to sched
ule another open house. We have
set a tight schedule for rushing this
year and there is little chance of
changing it."
In a later interview, Dean Law
rence Kimpton corroborated Le-
Vino's statement. "Last year the
fraternities were snowed under with
the large number of open houses
held autumn quarter," he said. "'lt
was definitely decided that this year
would be one of fewer such dates."
The Dean said he regretted the
fact that some of the men had
missed the regular open houses, but
expressed the conviction that "if
these men are fraternity men they
will be pledged eventually,"
LeVino reiterated the fact that
rushing doesn't end with the close of
the formal rushing season. "Men
will be picked up by the houses
the rest of the year, and some houses
will fill out their frosh class with
men pledged as late as spring."
Hank Resin, head sponsor of En
ema, said that math placement tests,
Admiral Nimitz' speech, and snow
conditions kept many men from ade
quately visiting the fraternities. •
