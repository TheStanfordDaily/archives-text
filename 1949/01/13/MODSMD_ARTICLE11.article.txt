# HR Excom Discusses Plans for Expansion
## 
### 
lops on the lIR Excom agenda
Tuesday afternoon was discussion of
the necessary expansion of their
present activities under the U.S.
National Students Association to in
clude the position of central office
for the Inter-American and the Far
Eastern and Asiatic divisions of the
N.S.A. These activities will come
under the direction of the National
Survey Committee.
First responsibility of the commit
tee under the Inter-American affairs
division will be the orientation of
the American delegates to the first
Inter-American student conference
to be held at Montevideo this com
ing summer.
For the present, the Far Eastern
and Asiatic committee will concen
trate on material and technical as
sistance. They will encourage teach
er.'. and graduate students to go to
the nations of the Far East as teach
ers. Erskine Childers, regional
chairman of N.S.A., is already in
vestigating the possibilities of bring
ing groups of Asiatic students to Pa
cific Coast colleges for technical ses
sions this summer.
The Far Eastern division will also
attempt to analyze the student polit
ical movements in that area similar
to the analysis being undertaken by
the Inter-American division.
The Inter-American affairs di
vision of the N.S.A. came into ex
istence only last summer. Upon re
turning from a South American con
ference last summer Erskine Chil
ders reported to the National Stu
dent Congress in Madison, Wis., on
the posibilities of extending N.S.A.
international activities to include all
the Americas.
Acting upon Childers' report the
congress asked him to set up the
Inter-American affairs division. The
Stanford Institute of International
Relations, because of its already out
standing national reputation for

work under the U.S.N.S.A. and its
independent international work, was
invited to become the central office
in the United States for the Inter-
American Affairs division.
The Far Eastern and Asiatic di
vision has come into being only in
the past month following action by
the National N.S.A. executive coun
cil and the California-Nevada-Ha
waii regional assembly of which
Childers is chairman.. At the recent
regional assembly the International
Sub-committee voted a recommen
dation that schools in this area sub
stantially redirect their international
work toward the Far East, where
little is being done at the present
time.
Stanford's lIR was again chosen
to be the central oflice for admin
istration of the international affairs.
