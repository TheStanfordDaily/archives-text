# Summer Seminar Experiences Related by Foreign Students
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
David Chan is a 21-year-old political science major from Ran
goon, Burma. Last summer he and 27 other students from all
parts of the world lived for seven weeks in a former Navy bar
racks at Farragut, Ida., while they participated in one of the
American Friends International Service Seminars.
David looks upon those seven weeks as being one of the

most rewarding experiences of his I
life.
"Through the seminars." he says, i
"I was able to completely adapt my- !
self to the American way of life.
By living with people from various
other countries, all with radically
different political and social back- ;
grounds, it was easier for me to un- j
derstand the people of this country.
Last summer 330 students, includ
ing many Americans, lived together
and compared ideas and beliefs with
each other in the seminar's several
camps which were scattered
throughout the country. Fifty coun
tries were represented.
Information on the seminars will i
be given this afternoon at 4:15 on
the third floor of the Women's Club
house. Present at the meeting will
be Mrs. Charles Schweizo who has
been a director at the Lake Tahoe
Seminar for the past two summers.
Part of the meeting will be taken

up by a discussion of the "Experi
ment in International Living," de
scribed in an article published in
yesterday's Daily.
Only a limited number of Ameri
can students are admitted to the
seminar camps, as the main purpose
of the program is to bring together
the youth of all nations. Most of
the participants are student leaders
in their native countries.
During each of the seminars' sev
en weeks, a well known person, each
an authority in his field, visits the
camps and sits in on the daily dis
cussions. Subjects discussed range
from the psychological bases of
peace to the study of various re
gional problems.
Among those men who have par
ticipated in the seminars are Nevitt
Sanford of the University of Cali
fornia and Milton Mayer of the
3reat Books Foundation.
Students taking part in the semi
nars live together on a co-operative
basis. They have found that the
group performance of such menial
chores as dishwashing and meal
preparation have invariably led to
lasting friendships and a shortcut to
the understanding of the differences
between their behavior and their
convictions.
Other Stanford students who par
ticipated in the program will be on
hand tomorrow to answer all queries
on the seminars.
