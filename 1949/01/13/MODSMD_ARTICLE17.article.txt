Sacony must have been lis
tening to my prayers because
when I went into the Clothes
Closet yesterday there they
were — beautiful new woolen
dresses in Sacony's own knit
ted fabrics.
These dresses are the per
fect thing for the basketball
games, here or in the Cow
Palace. They don't wrinkle,
and they're so figure flatter
ing. Choose between the
many styles ... a one-piece
dress tailored like a shirt
maker or with Sacony's spe
cial elastic knitted waist band,
or perhaps a two-piece clas
sic. Will you have muted or
vibrant colors?
Here's your chance to buy
your first advanced Spring
fashion . . . and yet a fashion
you can and will want to
wear now. $22.95 to $25.
