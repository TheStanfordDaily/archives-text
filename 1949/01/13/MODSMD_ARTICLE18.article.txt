# Europe Expects U.S. Aid To Terminate by Mid-'52

WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (AP) — Europe definitely expecis
American aid to halt in mid-1952 although Europe's troubles then
will be far from over, Robert Marjolin, secretary general of the
Council of Marshall Plan Countries, said today.
A trade deficit of 53,000,000,000 is in prospect for the year

following, Marjolin told a news con
ference. But only redoubled recov
ery efforts by the 19 countries them
selves can he'p, he said.
"It doesn't mean that Europe ex
pects the United States to provide
another $3,000,000,000." he said.
It is the "basic assumption" of
the council that the four-year re
tovery program will end on sched
ule in mid-1952.
But the council's report issued in
Palis last: week, which analyzes the
recovery programs of the 19 partici
pating countries, indicates thai Eu
ropean exports will fall $3.000.000.000
short of imports in the first twelve
months after America steps out.
This means that unless prompt
corrective steps are taken, "the Eu
ropean countries will be obliged to
forego $3,000,000,000 in imports—or
about 25 per cent of the imports
they were counting on."
Imports from the North American
nations would be even harder hit:
they might drop 40 per cent, Mar

jolin said. But he pointed to a
graver result:
"It would mean a complete dis
ruption ol the economic systems of
Europe—a political and economic
crisis."
Ihe "great effort already made
therefore is "far from sufficient',"
said Marjolin, a Frenchman. These
steps must be taken promptly by
tlie countries, he said:
1. Stabilize their currencies — a
"must."
2. Lower prices by increasing pro
ductivity, improving world sales
techniques, developing an advertis
ing system.
3. Create new sources of supply
in the colonies, so they will ship
more goods to countries selling to
Europe.
4. Develop greater trade within
Europe.
5. Cut imports more than they
have so far been reduced.

tlie countries, he said:
1. Stabilize their currencies — a
"must."
2. Lower prices by increasing pro
ductivity, improving world sales
techniques, developing an advertis
ing system.
3. Create new sources of supply
in the colonies, so they will ship
more goods to countries selling to
Europe.
4. Develop greater trade within
Europe.
5. Cut imports more than they
have so far been reduced.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (AP) — Europe definitely expecis
American aid to halt in mid-1952 although Europe's troubles then
will be far from over, Robert Marjolin, secretary general of the
Council of Marshall Plan Countries, said today.
A trade deficit of 53,000,000,000 is in prospect for the year

following, Marjolin told a news con
ference. But only redoubled recov
ery efforts by the 19 countries them
selves can he'p, he said.
"It doesn't mean that Europe ex
pects the United States to provide
another $3,000,000,000." he said.
It is the "basic assumption" of
the council that the four-year re
tovery program will end on sched
ule in mid-1952.
But the council's report issued in
Palis last: week, which analyzes the
recovery programs of the 19 partici
pating countries, indicates thai Eu
ropean exports will fall $3.000.000.000
short of imports in the first twelve
months after America steps out.
This means that unless prompt
corrective steps are taken, "the Eu
ropean countries will be obliged to
forego $3,000,000,000 in imports—or
about 25 per cent of the imports
they were counting on."
Imports from the North American
nations would be even harder hit:
they might drop 40 per cent, Mar

jolin said. But he pointed to a
graver result:
"It would mean a complete dis
ruption ol the economic systems of
Europe—a political and economic
crisis."
Ihe "great effort already made
therefore is "far from sufficient',"
said Marjolin, a Frenchman. These
steps must be taken promptly by
tlie countries, he said:
1. Stabilize their currencies — a
"must."
2. Lower prices by increasing pro
ductivity, improving world sales
techniques, developing an advertis
ing system.
3. Create new sources of supply
in the colonies, so they will ship
more goods to countries selling to
Europe.
4. Develop greater trade within
Europe.
5. Cut imports more than they
have so far been reduced.
