Someone has asked us why we think President Truman will
nbandon a "get tough with Russia" policy for a policy of appease
ment when he has recommended a large arms budget to Con
gress as well as Universal Military Training. The point is well
taken, but the indications are that President Truman has the
same idea as the late President Roosevelt—that he personally
can woo and win over Stalin. Anyone who has studied Stalin's
mthless rise to power knows that no one ever won over Stalin.
Even his closest comrades who dared to differ with»him or make
suggestions were purged.
This is an old problem, but one worth hitting again. Stanford's
:rich Health Service could well afford to add a psychiatrist or two
ro the staff. The reason is apparent—competition being what it
js today at Stanford, there are more«chances for nervous and
mental crackups. Every quarter there are a number of persons
whom advisers, sponsors, and counsellors would like to refer
for psychiatric treatment. A consulting psychiatrist on Campus
would have the added advantage of being close to the problems
>vhich cause mental and nervous breakdowns here. He could
call in faculty, sponsors, even friends of the person involved
and obtain off the record information that would help. All Stan
ford has now is a mental hygienist. Two weeks ago an appoint
ment with him was sought for Gary Ender. An appointment was
finally squeezed in—for today!
Early in the scrap over the Bonus Plan, the Women's Council
head said that the bonus plan could not be in effect if the demerit
plan were passed, that is, the bonus plan must necessarily be
dropped if the demerit plan were adopted. When called to ac
count, she admitted the two could be combined but that Women's
Council didn't want to be bothered. Tuesday morning AWS
members incorporated the present bonus system with the pro
posed demerit plan. The plan will be placed before a vote of
all women. At long last a piece of good legislation has been
made compatible with students' desires and placed before them
.n an honorable fashion. The tragedy of all the trouble is that
vVomen's Council for the most part has been more concerned
with conducting star chamber tactics than with dispensing justice.
