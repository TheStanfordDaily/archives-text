Eating Club But'dings
To the Editor:
Inc Daily makes lots of mistakes. Sometimes they are the fault of the
Peninsula's only morning daily and its fearless, etc., staff. Yesterday's
Iront-page information that robins were swimming in Lake Lagunita was
.pparently one of those. But sometimes The Daily's mistakes are not its
fault, and I write to correct one of those.
A "caption" on page eight reported that the old eating-club buildings
had been demolished because "they were condemned as unsafe," "by
engineers," no less. Obviously the Daily's reporter was handed this in
formation by some University agent, and it is the same canard the Uni
ersity put out to Breakers, Toro, and Campo (whose clubrooms they
were) light after the war, when trie clubs were getting organized again.
At that time club members called in a city building inspector to make
n independent check of the "Little Quad" buildings. He reported that the
clubrooms and kitchens were in no way unsafe, and that he thought t'ney
••ere in better shape, in fact, than most of the University buildings of that
age still in use. Of our-e, by this time, the University had already dragged
•he buildings off their foundations, but one of the original plans of
'he independent !H:s was to put them back again. The University has
'icver given any 'quale explanation either why the buildings were
moved of! in the P.; : pi e, or why they could not be used again elsewhere.
It is not because they were unsafe.

To the Editor:
Congratulations to the author of the editorial of Jan. 11. calling for the
inclusion of hometown addresses in the Bawlout. I venture the suggestion
that the vast majority of students would not object to paying $1 for the
Bawlout if it contained more pertinent information. Space conservation
could be attained by wider and more liberal use of stars, asterisks, crosses,
doublecrosses, daggers, etc.
As an example, the following information:

Inc Daily makes lots of mistakes. Sometimes they are the fault of the
Peninsula's only morning daily and its fearless, etc., staff. Yesterday's
Iront-page information that robins were swimming in Lake Lagunita was
.pparently one of those. But sometimes The Daily's mistakes are not its
fault, and I write to correct one of those.
A "caption" on page eight reported that the old eating-club buildings
had been demolished because "they were condemned as unsafe," "by
engineers," no less. Obviously the Daily's reporter was handed this in
formation by some University agent, and it is the same canard the Uni
ersity put out to Breakers, Toro, and Campo (whose clubrooms they
were) light after the war, when trie clubs were getting organized again.
At that time club members called in a city building inspector to make
n independent check of the "Little Quad" buildings. He reported that the
clubrooms and kitchens were in no way unsafe, and that he thought t'ney
••ere in better shape, in fact, than most of the University buildings of that
age still in use. Of our-e, by this time, the University had already dragged
•he buildings off their foundations, but one of the original plans of
'he independent !H:s was to put them back again. The University has
'icver given any 'quale explanation either why the buildings were
moved of! in the P.; : pi e, or why they could not be used again elsewhere.
It is not because they were unsafe.

Congratulations to the author of the editorial of Jan. 11. calling for the
inclusion of hometown addresses in the Bawlout. I venture the suggestion
that the vast majority of students would not object to paying $1 for the
Bawlout if it contained more pertinent information. Space conservation
could be attained by wider and more liberal use of stars, asterisks, crosses,
doublecrosses, daggers, etc.
As an example, the following information:
