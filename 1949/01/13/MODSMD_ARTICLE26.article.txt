### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Jo Ann Diamos, charming and
pretty junior, has just returned ,
from one of Uncle Sam's deepest
sink holes, a place called Greece
where our millions are going down
the drain.
Miss Diamos accompanied her
mother and sister to Greece lor a !
two-and-a-half-month visit during
autumn. They traveled to Greece 1
to visit her mother's sister and !
friends. The Diamos spent most of '
their time in Athens and in Tri- |
polis, a town of about 10.000 in i
Thessaly in northwestern Greece. !
Tripo'is is only a lew miles from j
famed and historic Mount Olym- '
pus.
Communist Control
"We had to fly from Athens to
Ti ipolis, because the Communists '
had control of most of the territory !
around the town," the young Stan
ford student said.
Miss Diamos frankly has a feel
ing of exasperation and boneless- J
ness concerning the ridding of !
Communists from Greece. This i
feeling she has pained from talking j
to -many Greeks in their country j
and to some American officials and
soldiers over there. The Spanish j
spirit of "mamma" flourishes quite |
strongly in its Hellenic version. The i
Lagunita resident says she esti- !
mates roughly that about one- !
eighth of the people over there are J
Communists or sympathizers. "Per- j
haps more. They wouldn't all make I
themselves known."
llclp from U.S.
A popular question from the |
Greeks was the bland inquiry,
"Why doesn't America send us more I
help?" Miss Diamos unhappily feels j
from what she has observed that
thev aren't worth the help they're
getting inasmuch as thev are i"it
actively enough aware about self
help as they might be.
"Why don't you send us some of
your unused bombers from your
mothball air force?" was one ques
tion encountered. The Stanford i
girl learned why we're not sending
the bombers from an American
so'dier. "The answer's simple. The
Commies are so dispersed that to
try bombing them with heavy stuff
would be almost useless."
In Athens, world-famed art ob
iects are wrapped un and not ex
hibited in fear of Communist up
risings.
In the overcrowded capital of un
happy Greece there are contrasts:
poverty and "good meals" favorable
by American standards.
And Wine. Too
"We exchanged our dollars for
drachmas. I understand that on the
black market people could obtain
about 1?,000 drachmas to the dol
lar. For an equivalent of six Amer
ican dollars a good meal could be
obtained—with wine, too—for four
peop'e. You can't do this in Amer
ica, even." It can't be "done in
Grecce either—for the vast major
ity of the people.
Students seem to work harder in
Greek hk'h schools, Miss Diamos
believes. "Some of them go to two
schools a day, one for another lan
guage study. French is still THE
foreign language to learn in high
school; however. English is getting
more popular.
"No, I didn't nqtice any excep
tional political precocity in the
students other than that they had
the general feeling, mos't of them,
that the Communists are bad."
Handling Communists
An American official toVl Miss
Diamos his answer for the Commu
nist trouble which is perhaps the
biggest deterrent to rehabilitation
of the country. "I'm supposed to
build roads here. I know bow to
handle those Communists that have
been giving me trouble. If my su
periors would let me, I'd go up
into those mountains and hire the
Communists to build my roads for
me."
The intimation here is that if
they are well fed and can get a
better living standard, the "Com
munists" will once again re-enter
the bourgeois ranks. If this is so,
the trouble in Greece would evi
dently concern means, not ends.
But whethei il is means or ends,
the blood still flows in Greece.

Handling Communists
An American official toVl Miss

nist trouble which is perhaps the
biggest deterrent to rehabilitation
of the country. "I'm supposed to

periors would let me, I'd go up
into those mountains and hire the
Communists to build my roads for
me."

Miss Diamos frankly has a feel
ing of exasperation and boneless- J
ness concerning the ridding of !
Communists from Greece. This i
feeling she has pained from talking j
to -many Greeks in their country j
and to some American officials and
soldiers over there. The Spanish j
spirit of "mamma" flourishes quite |
strongly in its Hellenic version. The i

actively enough aware about self

"Why don't you send us some of
