## Bull Session 
### 
My girl has small knees. Small knees are wee knees. A weenie is a
! hot dog. You ought to see my girl.
She's got everything. Wish I could get some of it back. I know that
j only the brave deserve the fair, but it 'ooks to me like only the rich can
support them. I still can't remember where I met my girl. I was down
'town one day and I opened up my wallet and there she was.
There always seems to be someone around that has to be a kill-joy.
There has been a claim made that a person can only f;.ll in love once,
i But no less an authority than Sarah Bernhardt scoffs at the idea. She
says she has fallen in love a hundred and twenty-two times —so far.
.lust remember that a good woman inspires a man, a bril iant woman
interests him, a beautiful woman fascinates him—but the sympathetic
woman gets him.
Here's a hint, gals, if you want to nail your man to the marital cross.
The color red reacts most quickly on the optic nerve of a man as well
as a bull. Therefore wear red clothes and you catch the eyes of the men
: more quickly than the gals wearing blue do.
And in marriage one is only as old as he or she feels. Chances of
; marriage for spinsters of 65 or more are less than one in 100. and for bache
; 'ors of the same age group are less than two in 100. That's according to
! census tables. Nevertheless there are many examples on record where
| this table has proved all wet.
For instance, there was a romance that started with a lonely hearts
I advertisement that was recently climaxed in Los Angeles with 91-year-old
j George W. Sears marrying 72-year-old Martha Williams. And some 150
i ot Mr. Sears' descendants attended the ceremony.
On the other hand, do many children get married in America? Well,
j in an average year there are somewhere between 400 and 500 marriages
I in which the persons involved are between the ages of 10 and 15.
One student of life among the married claims that child brides who
marry at the age of 13 or so are almost never happy in their first marriage.
I disclaim this. Look at a British beauty of some years ago who married
| at the age of 12 to the Earl of Litchfield. She bore him 18 children. I
: don't know it that is happiness or not, but no one can say he didn't have
j n happy home life.
And up in Maine there is a girl of 1 I called Glenna Rawding who
| followed her mother's and her grandmother's footsteps by marrying at
j that tender age. And in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, there is a file of a 16-year
old groom and a 13-year-old bride, the youngest couple ever married
I there.
| And then there is the vivid story of "Sonny" Wisecarver. who splashed
j headlines not long ago by eloping at 14 with an older woman, :md then
pulling the same trick the next year. Now he is sedate ;'t 18 with his
j plump young high school wife. Guess there is a moral there somewhere,
i but I don t want to find it. I in in favor of older women! They're harder
! to surprise.
Now if you want to keep your wife happy, son. just fill your domicile
; with mirrors. Why? Well, if she is beautiful she will look at herself and
think how lucky you are to have such a beautiful wife. If she is ugly she
will look at herself and think how lucky you are to have such a beautiful
! wife.
Of course, if you don't want to keep your wife—happy or any other
way—take off like a stilted mongoose for Panama and join a San Bias
| Indian colony. There the bridegroom is permitted to escape the maw <>l
! matrimony if he runs away more than three times during -eremonies.
Of course, it's a woman's own fault if her man doesn't love her. II
; she didn't remind him of it every day he wouldn't even know he had quit
loving her.
And every married woman knows the less he says the loss he is going
to have to take back later. I think man must have been made before
! woman to give him time to think of an answer to her first que - lon
for in spite of what you've heard, a wife almost never has the las word.
[ The husband always, day or night, ends up. ''All right, a!l rii'ht . . . v'
| RIGHT!"
