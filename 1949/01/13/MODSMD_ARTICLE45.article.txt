# Three Stanford Poloists Leave For Miami Tilt
## 
### 
Three members of Stanford's un
defeated polo team arc Miami
bound this morning, headed for the
Orange Bowl and a polo match with
the University of Miami. The game,
to be played tomorrow afternoon on
the floor of the famed Orange Bowl
Stadium in Miami, will be the first
intersectional contest in the history
of the Stanford Polo Association.
The trio will fly to Miami today,
and return on Sunday. The play
ers are Bill Decker, Lynn Madlener,
and Rul'us Hayden. They wil! be
accompanied by Allen Ross, polo
joach and head of the Stanford
Riding School.
Indoor Kulcs
The contest will be conducted un
der indoor polo rules, as the Orange
Bowl field is not spacious enough to
permit the playing of a regulation
game. This means that three play
ers will make up a side instead of
the usual four, and that an indoor
bal! will be employed.
The trip is being sponsored bv the
University of Miami Hurricanes,
national intercollegiate polo cham
pions last year. The Hurricane rid
3rs also plan games with Yale,
Princeton, Cornell, Harvard, and
New Mexico Military Institute this
season.
Four lettermen return from last
year's Miami squad, and with a
promising group of newcomers
backing them up the Floi ic'ans !ook
like a good bet to retain their inter
collegiate title. The Hurricanes take
their polo seriously, and several of
the team members compete all the
year around in amateur "mudlot"
loops.

The Miami invitation comes as the
climax of three years of hard work
by the Stanford Polo Association.

fall of by four Stanford stu
dents who had played some polo
before the war. Bill Decker, who is
currently team captain and presi
dent of the Association, is the only
one of the original founders still in

Last year's squad compiled a good
record against some of the best
clubs in Northern California. The
group is expanding its plans for the
current season and is arranging for
