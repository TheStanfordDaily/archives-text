### BILL SWIGART. Daily Sports Editor 
The officiating of the Stanford-UCLA basketball game played in tb
Pavilion last Friday night gets our nomination for the poorest job o
arbitrating of the current local hardwood season.
That was the game, need we remind our readers, in which two technica
fouls were handed out for showing too much ardor in protesting refere
decisions. Bruin center Carl Kraushaar was given a technical for openin
his mouth practically every time ihe whistle blew. And a lot of his team
mates weren t far behind. Kraushaar just happened to be the &oat.
The other technical was meted out-to the Indians because the spec
tators had been a little too loud and too long in griping about a chargin
foul. Stanford, as the home team, was penalized.
Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden was up and down off the bench like
jumping jack all night long. He got a personal explanation on one of ih
calls, could get no satisfaction, and went back to the bench shaking hi
head and muttering to himself.
The game was without a doubt poorly called. But like spilt milk an
Truman s election, there's no use talking about it now.
Why lake it Out on Players?
However, what we on the sidelines can't understand is why basketha
fans insist on taking out their wrath on the poor guy who's trying t
shoot his free throw. It isn't his fault that the referee is related to th
Thiee Blind Mice. The man on the free-throw line is a third party t
the argument—just an innocent bystander.
The decision has been made—chances are less than one in a millio
that it will be changed. The player who has been "fouled" nets a fre
throw. Article 8. Section 2 of the rules says so. So why not let hit
take it.' Booing, jeering, and hissing in hopes of distracting him isn
the sportsman's way of trying to win a ball game.
Besides it's not courteous and shows extremely poor taste. Bill Steph
enson, and Dave Davidson and the rest of the Stanford players woul
like fair treatment on visiting courts, but have no right to expect an
more courtesy than that which is accorded visiting players at home.

The officiating of the Stanford-UCLA basketball game played in tb
Pavilion last Friday night gets our nomination for the poorest job o
arbitrating of the current local hardwood season.
That was the game, need we remind our readers, in which two technica
fouls were handed out for showing too much ardor in protesting refere
decisions. Bruin center Carl Kraushaar was given a technical for openin
his mouth practically every time ihe whistle blew. And a lot of his team
mates weren t far behind. Kraushaar just happened to be the &oat.
The other technical was meted out-to the Indians because the spec
tators had been a little too loud and too long in griping about a chargin
foul. Stanford, as the home team, was penalized.
Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden was up and down off the bench like
jumping jack all night long. He got a personal explanation on one of ih
calls, could get no satisfaction, and went back to the bench shaking hi
head and muttering to himself.
The game was without a doubt poorly called. But like spilt milk an

The officiating of the Stanford-UCLA basketball game played in tb
Pavilion last Friday night gets our nomination for the poorest job o
arbitrating of the current local hardwood season.
That was the game, need we remind our readers, in which two technica
fouls were handed out for showing too much ardor in protesting refere
decisions. Bruin center Carl Kraushaar was given a technical for openin
his mouth practically every time ihe whistle blew. And a lot of his team
mates weren t far behind. Kraushaar just happened to be the &oat.
The other technical was meted out-to the Indians because the spec
tators had been a little too loud and too long in griping about a chargin
foul. Stanford, as the home team, was penalized.
Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden was up and down off the bench like
jumping jack all night long. He got a personal explanation on one of ih
calls, could get no satisfaction, and went back to the bench shaking hi
head and muttering to himself.
The game was without a doubt poorly called. But like spilt milk an
Truman s election, there's no use talking about it now.
Why lake it Out on Players?
However, what we on the sidelines can't understand is why basketha
fans insist on taking out their wrath on the poor guy who's trying t
shoot his free throw. It isn't his fault that the referee is related to th
Thiee Blind Mice. The man on the free-throw line is a third party t
the argument—just an innocent bystander.
The decision has been made—chances are less than one in a millio
that it will be changed. The player who has been "fouled" nets a fre
throw. Article 8. Section 2 of the rules says so. So why not let hit
take it.' Booing, jeering, and hissing in hopes of distracting him isn
the sportsman's way of trying to win a ball game.
Besides it's not courteous and shows extremely poor taste. Bill Steph
enson, and Dave Davidson and the rest of the Stanford players woul
like fair treatment on visiting courts, but have no right to expect an
more courtesy than that which is accorded visiting players at home.
Let the ref know where he stands, sure. Like grandstand umpirin
