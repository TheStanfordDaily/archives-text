### 
With one weekend of play behind
it.the Southern Division basketball
race, tightened up like a champagne
cork, still looks like a wide open
aftait.
USC's Trojans, led by their clev
er forward Bill Sharman and come
•hrough artist Joe White, grabbed
ofT the first week lead as they
-quee/.ed by California, and then
turned in their best performance of
'he season to trip Stanford by 10
points.
Sam Barry's boys will put their
record on the firing line this week
end when they meet their cross
town rivals, UCLA, in a two-game
series. If the Trojans can keep their
winning ways against the Bruins,
•hey'll catch a firm hold on the
Conference race.
Stanford and UCLA, each with
one win apiece, will both lie out to
pass the Trojans. UCLA, having
♦he direct route to contend with,
doesn't figure as well as Stanford
which will be facing twice-beaten
California.

conference games after winning t
Pacific Coast Tournament .just o
week previous. In losing to US

like pro-season dope charts said
would act.

All eyes will be focused on Sta
ford this weekend, as the on
heavily favored Cardinals atteni

With George Yardley back in t
lineup, the Indians should top t
Bears both times out. but as in
Stanford - California contests, v
never can toll.
