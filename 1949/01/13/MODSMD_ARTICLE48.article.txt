### JOHN HALL 
Stanford will travel to Berkeley tomorrow night to do battle
ith the California Bears in the first Big Basketball Game of the
Division season. Tipoff time is set for 8:30 p.m. in the
srkeley Gym.
Nibs Price's Golden Bears, although sitting at the extreme bot-

m of the Conference heap, are ex
ited to be just as tough against
anford as they were two weeks
o when they nosed out the. Cards,
to 54, in the finals of the PCC
mrnament.
His Nibs Is Clever
Saturday night Stanford and Cali
rnia enter the Pavilion to meet in
e second game of the series. Tip
time in the Pavilion is moved
p one-half hour to 8 p.m.
His Nifcs, now in his 25th year as
-ad basketball coach at California,
<s worked wonders with this year's
op of Berkeley cage material,
iving lost his entire first and sec
id teams from last year, he wasn't
pected to floor much of anything.
But California fooled the experts
id came up with a club that rates
a par with any other quintet in
e Southern Division.
Cal Dangerous To Anyone
Boasting a total season record of
ne wins and eight losses, the Bears
ve made it known that they will
a dangerous threat to anyone they
ighl meet.
Carrying most of the offensive
id is big Mike O'Neil, 6 feet, 2Va
L'hes, who has scored 24 points in
5 first two games for a 12-point
erage. He is cool under fire, and
es his 192 pounds to advantage in
iking rebounds. He teams up at
3 forward spots with Dave Nichols,
e feet, 11 inches.
Nichols, a continual driver, was
;ond highest scorer on the Blues
it season, and when Andy Wolfe,
tuck Hanger, and the rest of the
amps pulled out, there was no
dy but Nichols to fill the job. He
ibbles too much, but is trouble
me at times. He has an 8-point
erage for Southern Division play.
Ilagler Stars in Tournament
Bill Hagler. 0 feet. 3 inches, who
is selected as a forward on the
1-Tournament team at the Cow j
lace, has worked in pretty well
the pivot spot, but has seen very
tie actual varsity experience. He
is center for Cal's Frosh last sea- j
n, averaging 10 points per game, j
far, in Conference play, he has !
jred 17 points.
California's guard spots are han- ;
;d by Bob Walker, G feet. 3 inches,
ly returning letterman on the
jm, and usually Bill Thompson,
feet, 1 inch, a transfer from Sac- i
mento Junior College.
All Edges Go To Stanford
As a team, California averages
feet, 1 inch in height, and has a i
oring record of 53 points per game. |

Stanford will travel to Berkeley tomorrow night to do battle
ith the California Bears in the first Big Basketball Game of the
Division season. Tipoff time is set for 8:30 p.m. in the
srkeley Gym.
Nibs Price's Golden Bears, although sitting at the extreme bot-

m of the Conference heap, are ex
ited to be just as tough against
anford as they were two weeks
o when they nosed out the. Cards,
to 54, in the finals of the PCC
mrnament.
His Nibs Is Clever
Saturday night Stanford and Cali
rnia enter the Pavilion to meet in
e second game of the series. Tip
time in the Pavilion is moved
p one-half hour to 8 p.m.
His Nifcs, now in his 25th year as
-ad basketball coach at California,
<s worked wonders with this year's
op of Berkeley cage material,
iving lost his entire first and sec
id teams from last year, he wasn't
pected to floor much of anything.
But California fooled the experts
id came up with a club that rates
a par with any other quintet in
e Southern Division.
Cal Dangerous To Anyone
Boasting a total season record of
ne wins and eight losses, the Bears
ve made it known that they will
a dangerous threat to anyone they
ighl meet.
Carrying most of the offensive
id is big Mike O'Neil, 6 feet, 2Va
L'hes, who has scored 24 points in
5 first two games for a 12-point
erage. He is cool under fire, and
es his 192 pounds to advantage in
iking rebounds. He teams up at
3 forward spots with Dave Nichols,
e feet, 11 inches.
Nichols, a continual driver, was
;ond highest scorer on the Blues
it season, and when Andy Wolfe,
tuck Hanger, and the rest of the
amps pulled out, there was no
dy but Nichols to fill the job. He
ibbles too much, but is trouble
me at times. He has an 8-point
erage for Southern Division play.
Ilagler Stars in Tournament
Bill Hagler. 0 feet. 3 inches, who
is selected as a forward on the
1-Tournament team at the Cow j
lace, has worked in pretty well
the pivot spot, but has seen very
tie actual varsity experience. He
is center for Cal's Frosh last sea- j
n, averaging 10 points per game, j
far, in Conference play, he has !
jred 17 points.
