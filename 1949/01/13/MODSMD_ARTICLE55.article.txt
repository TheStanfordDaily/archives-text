# Odom Trying to Top Record

HONOLULU. Jan. 12 (JP).—Lanky
Bill Oclom took off over the darken
ing Pacific late today on a projected
nonstop flight to New York in an
effort to set a new distance record
for small planes.
Scrunched into the tiny compart
ment of his single-engined "Wai
kiki Beech," Odom lifted the heav
ily loaded Beechcraft off the run
way at G:32 p.m. (8:32 p.m., PST)
on the 5.010-mile hop.
Odom had flown around the world
twice. He had waited since Dec. 31
for a favorable break in the weather

— across the Pacific and on the
mainland. He estimated the flight
would require about 34 hours.
The small-plane distance record
is 2,0P>1 miles, established Sept. 23,
1937, by two Russians cn a hop
from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk.
Odom hoped for help from tail
winds.
