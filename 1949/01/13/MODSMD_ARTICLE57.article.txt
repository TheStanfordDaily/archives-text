# 'Salaried' Photogs Sought for Quad
## 
### 
Photographers, shutter clickers,
and snapshot artists, the Quad needs
you. The hours are bad and the
pay is worse, SO per year, but the
parties are terrific and think of the
experience you get.
Any and all of you that want to
take pictures like mad come over
to the Quad office any afternoon
and ask for Ted Off or Brad Brey
man and they'll fix it so thai you can
do just that.
