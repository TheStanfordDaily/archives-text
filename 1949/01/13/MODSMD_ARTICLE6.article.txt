## 
### 
Excom discussed the possibility of
having Benny Goodman for an all
campus dance on Feb. 26 at its
! meeting last night.
i Tile proposal called for a low
; priced dance with the ASSU absorb
j ing the net loss that would be in
| curred due to the limited capacity of
j the pavilion.
A 1 Bletz outlined the plan to have
NSA purchase cards at Stanford.
' The cards, costing one dollar, would
j enable students to obtain a 20 per
i cent discount at the shops of local
merchants who joined in the plan.
Of the dollar. 75 cents would go to
the national NSA and 25 cents to
I the local unit for printing costs.
John Pool stated that such a plan
; might injure the other campus pro
i grams supported by the local mer
-1 chants. Among there were the ad
vertisements for campus publica
; tions and the donation of awards
1 such as those for the Big Game pa
rade. Also the local stores would
I not gain such a great volume of busi
! ness as would those in large cities
| who would profit from the publicity.
