Dr. Leonard I. SchifT, Stanford
! physics professor, has written a
new book, "Quantum Mechanics,"
just published by the 'McGraw-Hill
Book Company. The book is a vol
ume of the company's International
Series in Pure Applied Physics,
'"Quantum Mechanics" is designed
' as a college text and reference book
for advanced and graduate students
in physics and mathematics. The
book deals comprehensively with
quantum mechanics, which is the
basic theory of the submicroscopic
atoms m-iking up matter.
