# Cabinet Upholds Bevin's Israel Policy
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 12 (AP)—The
full British Cabinet apparently
gave its complete support to
day to Foreign Secretary Bev
in's Palestine policy.
(In Washington, the U.S. State
Department expressed "concern" and
"apprehension.")
A high government source here
said there would be no change in
Britain's Middle East course. This
was after the cabinet met for four
hours. It heard Bevin report on why
Britain has sent troops to Aqaba in
Trans-Jordan, in tituted armed air
patrols along Palestine's Trans-
Jordan and Egyptian frontiers, and
warned that Middle Eastern peace
is threatened unless the UN Security
Council's authority is re - estab
lished.
Bevin and his policy came in for
questioning and criticism in some
British newspapers when five RAF
planes were shot down last Friday
while engaged in an armed recon
naissance over t'le Israeli-Egyptian
battle area.
Anthony Ede** * T o. 2 man in the
Conservative Party, tonight de
nounced RAF T its over the area

as "entirely purposeless and deplor
able."
In a political talk at Warwick,
Eden called the Friday attack by Is
raelis "an unwarranted and aggres
sive act." Then he "Whv
were our aircraft sent to carry out
a reconnaissance over a battle area
in such conditions? What useful
British purpose could be served?"
Tel Aviv dispatches today quoted

one of the RAF fliers as saying in
an interview his Spitfire had ciossed
into Palestine territory before it
was shot down Friday by Jewish ri
flemen.
The flier, Pilot Frank Harvey
Close, was quoted as saying he was
familiar with road landmarks in the
area and knew his flight leader led
the formation over the frontier. He
could not say whether the flight
leader knew it, however.
This story sent authorities "at a
very high level" in London into a
huddle. Eventually the Air Ministry
stuck by its story. It said tonight
the "true facts" were as given by it
previously, that the pilots had strict
orders to stay on the Egyptian side,
and were in fact victims of an un
provoked attack while over Egyptian
territory.
At L;ike Success, UN Secretary
General Trygve Lie told a news con
ference he hopes "all parties will be
helpful" so that the acting UN me
diator, Dr. Ralph Bunche, may have
a success in the Rhodes negotiations.
Lie was understood to have urged
the Israelis not to press for a coun
cil meeting now to air their com
plaint of yesterday that the British
are menacing Israel by military
movements.

hours. It heard Bevin report on why
Britain has sent troops to Aqaba in
Trans-Jordan, in tituted armed air
patrols along Palestine's Trans-
Jordan and Egyptian frontiers, and
warned that Middle Eastern peace
is threatened unless the UN Security
Council's authority is re - estab
lished.
Bevin and his policy came in for
questioning and criticism in some
British newspapers when five RAF
planes were shot down last Friday
while engaged in an armed recon
naissance over t'le Israeli-Egyptian
battle area.
Anthony Ede** * T o. 2 man in the
Conservative Party, tonight de
nounced RAF T its over the area

as "entirely purposeless and deplor
able."
In a political talk at Warwick,
Eden called the Friday attack by Is
raelis "an unwarranted and aggres
sive act." Then he "Whv
were our aircraft sent to carry out
a reconnaissance over a battle area
in such conditions? What useful
British purpose could be served?"
Tel Aviv dispatches today quoted

one of the RAF fliers as saying in
an interview his Spitfire had ciossed
into Palestine territory before it
was shot down Friday by Jewish ri
flemen.
The flier, Pilot Frank Harvey
Close, was quoted as saying he was
familiar with road landmarks in the
area and knew his flight leader led
the formation over the frontier. He
could not say whether the flight
leader knew it, however.
This story sent authorities "at a
very high level" in London into a
huddle. Eventually the Air Ministry
stuck by its story. It said tonight
the "true facts" were as given by it
previously, that the pilots had strict
orders to stay on the Egyptian side,
and were in fact victims of an un
provoked attack while over Egyptian
territory.
At L;ike Success, UN Secretary
General Trygve Lie told a news con
ference he hopes "all parties will be
helpful" so that the acting UN me
diator, Dr. Ralph Bunche, may have
a success in the Rhodes negotiations.
Lie was understood to have urged
the Israelis not to press for a coun
cil meeting now to air their com
plaint of yesterday that the British
are menacing Israel by military
movements.

LONDON, Jan. 12 (AP)—The
full British Cabinet apparently
gave its complete support to

Department expressed "concern" and
"apprehension.")

said there would be no change in
