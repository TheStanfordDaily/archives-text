RHODES, Jan. 13 (AP)—Rep
resentatives of the Jewish and
an Arab government sat down
together for the first time in
open conference today to nego
tiate an armistice in Southern Pal
estine.
The Israelis and Egyptians opened
the crucial negotiations for peace
after Dr. Ralph Bunche, acting UN
mediator urged "all governments"
not directly involved to keep hands
off in order not to jeopardize the
conference.
Although Bunche named no gov
ernment his statement was accepted
as a reference "to Britain and the
RAF patrol along the Egyptian bor
der from which five planes were
shot down last Friday.
Crucial Time Element
"I have in mind not only the gov
ernments directly involved but those
as well whose interests impel them
to keep close surveillance on devel
opments in the area," he said.
Bunche appealed to the negotiators
to hurry.
"1 trust," he said in a statement
issued shortly before the conference
began, "you will not lose sight c f
the urgency of time in your delib
erations. When war and lives are
at stake time becomes a factor of
tremendous magnitude.
"The peace of the Near East hangs
in balance while you meet. You can
not afford to fail. You must suc
ceed."
Initial Meeting Short
The first meeting was short, last
ing only 30 minutes, and the Jews
said it was inteifded to be that way.
Before the formal opening. Bunche
conferred separately with Walter
Eytan, head of the Israeli delega
tion. and Col. Mohamed Ibrahim Seif
Eddine, head of the Egyptian dele
gation.
Discussing the inequality of the
levels of the two delegations—ls
rael is represented by her No. 2
man in the foreign ministry while
Egypt is represented by three colo
nels—one of the Israelis said "the
Egyptians can increase the stature
of their delegation or we can reduce
ours."
In his preliminary statement
Bunche declared the negotiations,
subject to the wishes of the dele
gates, would be confined to "means
of implementing the Security Coun
cil resolution of Nov. 16."
