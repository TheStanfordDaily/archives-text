Twelve Stanford girls are desper

maintains full-time employees, there
is still a need for volunteer help in
the afternoons and on Saturday.
There are 13 little children, all
totally blind, who are in the school.
Anyone who can play the piano, or
anyone who can read to the chil

care, will be of great service to the
school.
The Stanford YWCA is organiz
ing a group of girls to do this work.
Hours are being scheduled for 3:30
to 5 Monday through Friday, and
for all day on Saturday. Only an
hour and a half of time each week
would be required of any volun
teer.
Anyone interested may receive
further information by calling the
Stanford "Y" or by calling Miss
