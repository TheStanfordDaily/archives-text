known stylist in short-story writ
ing, is adding another chapter to
her versatile book of experiences.
Starting this quarter, she is con
ducting a course in the problems

A vivacious little woman wiih
sparkling blue eyes and almost
snow-white hair, Miss Porter has
made her debut in the teaching
world with a new type of writing
course. She brings to her students
the problems of fiction writing as
seen by the "artist at work."
Among the earlier chapters in her
book of experiences, Miss Porter
can count a six-year stay in Europe.
She received the Guggenheim fel
lowship for writing abroad in 1901.
T'Lis started her on a one-year tour
of the Continent which stretched
into six. She developed a special
love for Paris. Reminiscing about
her five years there, she said, ' I
look back to it now as a kind ol
lost paradise."
In 1921, Miss Porter became in
terested in a group of painters in
Mexico City who were just then
dtiyeloping a new surrealistic school.
She traveled south of the border to
get a closer view of "these artist ?
at work," and stayed on for several
years in that colorful country.
"The year 1948's a total loss."
she said, recalling that she had not
completed any stories last year. In
talking further, she brought out the
fact that seven months of that year
were spent in an extensive coast
to-coast lecture tour. She began ai
Stanford last April and wound up
the tour in Chicago. Regarding her
trip she said, "I defy anyone to call
traveling in Europe tougher than
here."

ter plans to return to Europe to
bring to a close her 12-year absence
from the continent. In the mean
time she hopes to finish the book
which she now has under way, so
that this year will not be a loss 112
