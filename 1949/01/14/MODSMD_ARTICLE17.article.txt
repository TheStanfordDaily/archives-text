(irants-in-Aid
Last spring the Board of Trustees
provided $100 grants-in-aid to al
leviate the tuition increase. The
scholastic requirement for these was
a C average. Students who re
ceived this help usually worked and
aided their finances as best they
could, but still found they did not
have adequate resources to meet
the increased tuition cost.
University money for -grants-in
;'-id h; s been used up for 1048-49.
hi addition, the ASSU gave $5,000
tor grants-in-aid to last until the
1950-51 academic year. Already
$2,900 has been distributed in $100

Scholarships
Some scholarships are also avail
able. There were 23." applicants for
11 scholarships from students de

Those who could not finance their
Stanford education without a
scholarship went to other schools;
Mrs. Byler believes Stanford lost a
number of excellent students be
cause of the lack of scholarship
funds.

ready enrolled, the situation is not
so bad. There are only two or three
applicants for every scholarship.
Qualifications

arship are: (1) a "first-class" rec
ord—this means that a B average
(3.0) is a minimum; and (2) defi
nite financial need.
Scholarship funds come from en
dowment.';, gifts, and appropriations
by the Board of Trustees. An an
nual scholarship is made up from
these sources. When it is spent,
that's all.
Sometimes funds with restrictions
are not usable because there are no
eligible applicants. For example,
the student may have to be from a
certain city or be a major in a cer
tain department.
Special Donors
Other scholarships are given by
special donors or committees, and
the basis may be residence, club
work, or some other achievement.
These include those given by Pepsi-
Cola and alumni clubs in certain

do part-time work, hash, take jobs
over vacation, or take an extra load
of units —graduating perhaps in 10
quarters instead of 12.

uate work in autumn quarter, 1949-
50. must make their application for
scholarships by Feb. 15. Under
graduates have until April 15.
