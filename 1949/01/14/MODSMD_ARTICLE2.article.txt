# Yardley Injured Again; Odds Drop As Cards Invade Berkeley Tonight
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's ill-fated basketball
| team, crippled by a new Yard
ley knee injury and dogged by
the Southern Division cage jinx,
will invade a sold-out Berkeley
Gym tonight to face California's
| troublesome Golden Bears in the
I i)9th renewal of the Big Game series.
Adding to the already mounting

woes of Everett Dean. George Yard
; ley who is Stanford's leading scorer, reinjured his
bad knee during practice Wednesday and is a
doubtful starter in tonight's game.
It is most likely that Stanford will be Licking
both starting forwards when the Redshirts take
the floor. Bill Rose is definitely out. due to an
i academic condition, and with jumping-jack Yard
' ley on the sidelines, Dean's machine will not be
hitting on all cylinders.
Three Games Scheduled
TipofY for the varsity game is set for 8:30 p.m.
with preliminaries between the Cal Blues and Stan
ford Braves at 7 p.m. and between the Cal and
! Stanford Frosh at 5:45.
| Tomorrow night all six teams will be over on
| this side of the Bay, giving with the dribble in the
t Pavilion. Varsity starting time at the Pavilion is
: 8 p.m.
Stanford's chances for' double-victory over the
I Bears took a quick drop when Yardley twLsted his
j knee again. George was just returning to top form
' when he hurt himself on a simple lay-in shot. He
merely came down on his knee the wrong way, but
J that was all it needed.
iVfilt Iverson Carries Load
| With Rose and Yardley out, most of the offensive
; load will l:e carried by forward Milt Iverson and
center Bill Stephenson. Iverson. who has been
sparkling in practice this week, might be up to
the task. He turned in a good game against UCLA

lust week, scoring 10 points and looking very effective
in his floor work.
Bill Lewis, called out of the shadows to help out again.- 1 :
USC, may get his first starting assignment tonight. H
will till in for the ailing Yardley.
Other starters for Stanford include Stephenson at cen
ter, and "Defense" Lewis and Dave Davidson at guards
Heading the list of reserves are Gus Chavalas and Man.
Gelber. two fast-moving boys who go best under pres
sure.
(ins and Gelber Move Fast
When Chavalas and Gelber get into the ballgame, the
u..< .:~i, d„iv v.

pace steps up but quick. Both have
*ood shooting eyes, and Chavalas is
one of the neatest dribblers on the
Coast.
Bill Stephenson, who always plays
his best basketball against Califor
nia, will be starting his ninth con
secutive Southern Division 0r»m«

against the boys from Berkeley. At the end of last sea
son. Bill pumped 20 points through the net to lead Stan
lord to its first win over Cal in five years.
The bad-bad Bears, holding a series edge of 7G to £
over their arch-rival Indians, will Ire working hard to
night to prove that their Tournament win over the Card
two weeks ago was no fluke.
Cal in Cellar
Nibs Price's men, resting neatly in the cellar as a
result of their losses to USC and UCLA, will be fighting
desperately to get back into the loop race as well as t<.
maintain their long-standing jinx over Stanford.
Led by Mike O'Neil and Dave Nichols, the Bears boas"
a hard-scrapping, never-say-quits quintet, that has pro
gressed rapidly since the beginning of the year.
Stanford will be looking for its second win and iu<
rightful place atop the SD pack. Against the Bears ir
their home trenches, and without the services of Rost
and Yardley, the Indian hoopsters will need all the luck
they can muster.
For starting lineups, see the Cage Gage on the sport
page.


MILT "SQUINTY" IVERSON
will carry the offensive load
tonight as Stanford faces Cali
fornia minus the services of
Bill Rose and George Yardley.
Tipoff is scheduled for 8:30
p.m. in the Berkeley Gym.
