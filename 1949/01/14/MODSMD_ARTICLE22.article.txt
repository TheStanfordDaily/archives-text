# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Up to the Voters

Stanford's Honor Code is a cherished tradition—but only if it
is properly administered. And from the general point of view
each student is responsible for its care and maintenance. But
the handling of violations is the crux of the Code—and if vio
lations are badly handled, the Honor Code can become a major
bugaboo as well as a source of misery to individual students.
Honor Code violations are tried by Men's and Women's Coun
cils. With Men's Council we take no issue. They've done an hon
est, fair-minded job—and we've had a reporter at their meetings
jto observe as much.
But Women's Council!! Never before has a Daily editor re
ceived so many complaints concerning the injustice of Women's
Council.
The present Women's Council, we are told, has even gone out
of its way to try cases where professors had previously handed
down an opinion that there was no violation. They have dragged
down innocent third parties by stretching the third person pro
vision of the Code to impossible, fanatical lengths, complaints
indicate.
Early in the fall we learned that one of the off-the-record
activities was to further stretch the third-person provision to
cover social activities in such a manner that every girl would
be an informer on her fellow school mates' social activities. The
absurd lengths to which such a policy could lead can scarcely
be imagined.
Council is no better than its members. And it is our measured
opinion that the unhealthy situation with Women's Council can
be remedied in the next elections—if the women will be careful
:o select members of Council carefully. They should elect only
ihe women they would want to appear before for justice.
The present Council, we are told, was elected pretty much on
a name basis. Girls had little idea whom they were voting for,
except in the case of one member who campaigned. We sug
gest that the women must be careful whom they select, for
•he simple reason that a certain type of woman goes berserk
when given judicial power over other women.
The present Council, we have been informed, is not even a
cohesive unit. They do not agree with one another. One mem
ber, it is said, has engaged in considerable chit chat about the
more "notorious" of the secret trials'. And we know from our
own experience that the head of the Council told four members
of our staff four different stories some time back.
But once again we say that we believe the situation can be
cleared up by proper attention of women voters to the candi
dates for Women's Council.
If cautious voting in the future does not alleviate the problem,
we will have to go along with a suggestion now being mulled
over by student leaders—that an appellate court be established
:or appeal of Women's Council actions which seem to be a fla
grant miscarriage of justice.
It has been brought to our attention also that there has been
.indue interference in the affairs of Women's Council and in
other women s student groups by the director of one of the large
dormitories for women. Need we mention that such interference
ls uncalled for and should be stopped?
