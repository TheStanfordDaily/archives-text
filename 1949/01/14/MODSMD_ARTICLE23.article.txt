## Editorial Not Sufficiently Clear 
### 
To the Editor:
We find ourselves at a loss—we wish to discuss the editorial ' Ap
peasement—l 949," however, we find it extremely difficult to deal objec
tively with the editorial inasmuch as its logical development is implied
rather than stated.
We do not find the editorial sufficiently explicit in its analysis of the
causes of the Marshall resignation. The resignation, as stated by Marshall
and his physicians, was presented because of ill health. As such, it con
tains no implications of impending foreign policy change. Under these
circumstances conjecture as to other reasons is completely speculative and
does not warrant far-reaching conclusions regarding future policy shifts.
We do not understand the editorial's stand on efforts to end the cold
war. Such efforts, by inference, seem to be lumped with "appeasement"
and being "soft." We fail to see the editorial definitions of these terms.
We do not believe the attempt to seek a basis of agreement with Russia
indicates appeasement. Nor do we believe the only alternative to being
"tough" is being "soft." We do believe that such a limited position is
dangerous in its blocking any possible negotiations with Russia.
We read Jay Franklin's article in Life magazine. While neither de
fending nor attacking this article per se, we were unable to find the words
"soft policy" in the text of the article. The words appeared only in the
editorialized subheading by one of the Time, Inc., employees.
We would like clarifications on these points. We might find it possible
to reach an agreement with the editor in some of his conclusions if we
clearly understood those conclusions and the basis upon which they were
promulgated.
