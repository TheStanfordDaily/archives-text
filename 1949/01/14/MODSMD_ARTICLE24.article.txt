# Winter Recalls
## 
### 
To the Editor:
This cool weather recalls last winter and the curvaceous beauty who
swam in the men's pool at 8 a.m. in order to prepare for the Olympic
Games.
If others, especially of the so-called stronger sex. took their training
as seriously, perhaps Stanford's recent record in athletics would have
been better. #
