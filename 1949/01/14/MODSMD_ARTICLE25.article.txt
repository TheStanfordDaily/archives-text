Webster describes a tradition as
"a custom which has prevailed, as
from generation to generation," but
the Farm customs of the pioneer
days seem to have passed into de
generation at the hands of liberal
minded Stanfordites.
The 15)15 edition of the Quad
gives a colorful account of two dec
ades of Farm tradition, most of
which has been outlived by those
who encountered it.
The separation of the sexes found
the Stanford women maintaining a
high position at assemblies over the
common rough, who sat on the main
floor of the old assembly hall while
the gallery was reserved for the
coeds. In those days, the Stanford
women remained hat less by tradi
tion (as today), whether at classes
or athletic games. According to the
experts, this was allowed "due to
the climatological result of Stan
ford's mild and clear air." Evident
ly the Winds of Freedom weren't
kicking up too much of a fuss.
The President of the University
was also expected to take off his
hatâ€”when passing students on the
Quad. The courtesy was required
in return. Recent presidents just
gave up the idea of wearing a hat
as the enrollment increased.
Each class had a traditional hat
for the males to wear, but the frosh
were required to keep their top
notches covered by a .urey peanut
cap with a little red button on top.
The soph hat was red with a grey
band around it. At special events,
the juniors wore plug hats and the
seniors donned sombreros. Rooters'
caps appeared at the intercollegiate
contests around 1900, and accord
ing to Farm historians Cal was
quick to copy the idea.
Senior Cords
In the line of dress, there was
plenty of it for the women. Rough
neck attire was in order for the men
with flannel shirts achieving a high
degree of popularity. The wearing
of cords was restricted to seniors.
On dates, flowers and carriages,
or "taxis," were taboo. The latter
ruling was based on the objections
in the early days to the "highbrows"
who imported hacks from San Jose
to convey the women from Roble
to social events at Encina.
During this time, no autos were
allowed on Palm Drive; the horse
less carriages were required to
enter by a special road and trucks
had to use the Embarcadero.
Lights Out at 10:30
In the good old days, Encina held
open house every Sunday, and the
old hall was thrown into darkness
at 10:30 every night. The lights
were turned on again at 5:30 a.m.
Now it's the steam!
Waterbagging from the Bastille
was initiated by the Pioneer class
before the school was a week old.
Encina (live oak) was almost
called Madrono. This name actu
ally appeared on the first circulars
put out by the University. Roble
(white oak) was first letter Robles
on the front of the hall, but the "s"
was later cemented out.
Farm Barbershop
The old Farm barbershop was an
institution in itself. No rough con
sidered entering it by any other
way but the window. Only a few
of the conservative faculty ever
used the door.
The process of announcing an en
gagement might also be labeled an
institution. The sorority girls were
required to throw a pin under the
table and crawl after it when
breaking the news at mealtime.
Mosquito Lake
Lake Lagunita was once the sub
ject of a violent name controversy.
The pond used to be adequately
tabbed Mosquito Lake by the pub
lication Sequoia, but the Daily Palo
Alto (The Daily of yesteryear) cru
saded for the name Lagunita, which
stuck.
Other now defunct traditions:
No dating by frosh women after
10:30 p.m. or on week nights . . .
no billiard or pool playing on Sun
day, at Mrs. Stanford's request . . .
no shaving during exam week it
was considered bad luck . . . no
student attends classes when the
student attends classes when the
fire whistle blows.
