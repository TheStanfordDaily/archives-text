# Television Threatens to Lure And Chain Us to Our Homes
##

WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (7P>. _
'I Wis may be the beginning of the
end of the American Way of Life
as wc know it. Tuesday night East
and Midwest were hooked together
by television.
You doubt that this is an event of
tremendous import?
Well, no one paid much attention
when Henry cranked his first Ford,
either.
But the automobile yanked us out
of our homes. It made the city more
accessible to the farmer than the
geenral store had been. It turned
the country into a potential play
ground for hemmed-in city dwell
ers. It drove us to faraway places
we scarcely had dared to dream of
seeing.
Now television threatens to lure
us back into our homes, and chain
us there.
You doubt it?
I, too, once looked upon televi
sion as something one could take
or leave alone. Like ball-bearing
fountain pens, or fiction stories in
women's magazines, or neckties
with horses painted on them.
But. then, my friends began (hop
ping off, one by one, two by two.
Take that couple that used to at
tend our badminton club regularly.
He was a nice guy with a tricky
overhead smash. She was a nice
blonde with a tricky pair of shorts.
We liked having them around.
Then they- disappeared. Investi
gation started. No, there was no
foul play. They were discovered
bivouacked in front of a television
set. Hadn't been out for weeks.
Another friend of mine used 1o
take in the sports events. He
bought a television set, to use on
evenings when his wife had the ear.
Now neither of them uses the car,
and he is reported to have disinte
grated completely. He even watches
wrestling.
The small fry have been cap
tured. too.
We used to have a squadron of
kids in our yard every afternoon.
They engaged in the usual child
ish pursuits, such as tearing down
the fence, breaking Ihe windows,
and scalping the shrubbery.
Many of them are no longer with
us. They've been lassoed by Howdy
Dowdy.
But if television, in its infancy,
has such a hold, whet can we look
forward to when it can fetch in the
best from coast to coast?
Fellow preservers of the Ameri
can Way, the danger is plain. Let's
put the axe to the coaxial cable.
There's no time to lose.
