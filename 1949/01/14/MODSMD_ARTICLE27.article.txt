# Puzzling Cross Words

### BILL MORLEY 
Have you ever attempted to solve
any of the crossword puzzles th.it
appear so faithfully in our daily
newspapers. I came across one the
other day while trying to. find Herb
Caen in the Chronicle.
I got kind of involved in the thing
and found some questions completely
beyond my comprehension. For ex
ample, what do they mean by a
"white vestment?" The only tiling I
could think of was a French bath
ing suit. The trouble is the word
vestment suggests something to do
with church or religion or some
thing. Admitting that French bath
ing suits are divine, you could
hardly say that they had as much
to them as religion.
One of the horizontal blanks said
"East Indian boiled butter." It's
probably something elementary like
a' "hot toddy." But that doesn't fit
in the space, and 112 suspect some
foreign company of trying to crack
the American butter market. (Nine
out of ten Enst Indian cannibals
use boiled butter on fingers and
double chins.) Can't you see Ameri
cans paying $2 a pound for East
Indian butter ($2.50 a pound boiled).
Why we may be forced to ban cross
word puzzles in order to save our
American economy.
And how about "malt liquor?"
Obviously it's a chocolate malted
milk shake. Doesn't fit though, and
they want a three-letter word.
Somebody suggested "ale," but who
ever heard of calling "ale" a "malt
liquor?" Why you'd almost think
there was alcohol in it.
Number 4.1 across asks you about
"sunken fences." What possible use
is there in asking a question like
that? The fences, having sunk, are
no longer fences since they have
lost their utility of fencing, and
therefore are not worth considering
as fences.
Crossword puzzle makers assume
you know about a "Roman date."
Now just how old do they expect a
guy to be anyway? Do you know
any Roman girls? History tells us
that most Romans had to go to
Egypt for their women so how do
they expect us to make any time?
The only one you could be sure
of was "speed contests." Yes, that
was a double date at Mills whether
it fitted in four spaces or not.
