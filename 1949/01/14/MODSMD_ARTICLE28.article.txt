So you think I photograph beautifully, hah?? Thanks. Some of you
have been boorish enough to ask questions about mine bee-yutiful pik -
shure. Don't you know it's impolite to point?
Some of you maintain that this is the picture taken by a Quad pho-

tographer last year at Mangini's during the '50-'5l
beard-growing contest judging, and that it's not the
hack of my head at all. Hmm. (Ed. Note: George won.)
Others maintain that this photo is the most diplo
matic thing I've ever done .... That's a shabby
attitude to take.
\\ hat are the reasons for the pic? No, I'm not an
embarrassed Republican turning my back to the cam
era. If that were the case—and it were a catching
malady—7o per cent of you might be walking back
wards down the Quad.

As it is, now I have to walk backward down the Quad before people
will recognize me. When they do, then they turn their backs. I can t
understand it; I use Air Wick under the armpit like they say on the radio.
Personally I think I'm doing you a favor; this way you can read this
page and still keep down your breakfast. *
One of the real reasons for this pose though is that some people read
this paper near the Cellar juke box and I don't like to face the music.
Another theory about why the pic is as is: it «oes to the effect that
I'm a member of the Stanford Students for Wallace (not true) and that
I've turned my back on the unpleasant realities of life.
