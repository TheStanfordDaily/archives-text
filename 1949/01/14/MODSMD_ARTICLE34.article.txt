### 
All women who are members of a
riding class and interested in being
riding manager should sign up for
the job at the Red Barn or at the
Women's Gym within the next two
weeks, Nancy Beardley, WAA board
member, said yesterday.
The riding manager would be a
member of WAA Board, and would
arrange riding meets at Play Days.
She should have above average skill
in riding, Miss Beardsley said.
