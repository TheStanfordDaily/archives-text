# New Equipment, Minerals Added to Mineralogy Plant
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
The School of Mineral Sciences
has a new $102,000 plant, an in
vestment which will soon repay the
University many times in prestige,-
workmanship, and absence M eye

strain on students and faculty.
During the recent months, two
department buildings of the school,
mineralogy and petrography, were
reconverted to modern functional
units in the first of a series of
renovations to take place eventu
ally in University buildings.
Reconstruction
The reconstruction has doubled
the working space of both buildings
and made possible the addition of
equipment unknown to the students
of the old school.
In the mineralogy building on
the Outer Quad, complete reorgan
ization of materials and develop
ment of new courses is taking place
under the direction of Professor
Colin Hutton.
A 20-foot air space with hanging,
old-fashioned lights has been re
placed with two stories and inod
rn lighting. Downstairs are a
-podem lecture room and a chemi
cal analysis room. The department
is working on an improved museum,
'ocated in the new study room to
the rear.
Vast Improvement
It is the upstairs development,
l hou"h, that has meant a vast im-
to the c epartment. Here
ire rooms for optical mineralogy,
'r nio»"ctry, a mineral library,
n- 1 «tvdv. H' t'on's office, and
his private laboratory.
