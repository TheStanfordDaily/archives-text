# Lunnymen Trade Blows with Cal Poly Tonight
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's first pugilistic pano
rama of the year will be unfolded
before the Farm fight faithful to
night when Ray Lunny's varsity
punchers match their jabs and
counters against those of the leath
er-slingers of California Polytech
nic.
The first two gladiators will
square off at the Pavilion at 8:15.
Mike Pelsinger will be the center
of attraction tonight in the eyes of
the fans who like to watch the big
boys slug it out. A junior college
transfer from Long Beach, Mike
will shoulder the Indian hopes in
the only heavyweight bout of the
eveniug.
The invaders from San Luis

Obispo are also bringing only one |
light-heavyweight to the Farm me- |
lee, and Jarrin' Jim Hammond will
be out to convince the Poly 175- ,
pounder that he, too, should have '
stood at home. Jim is a rough
and-tumble slugger with little cx
perience but with a brgiht future j
in the squared circle.
What could easi'y turn out to be j
the main event of the evening, the
l()5-pound bout, has been sched
uled only tentatively. Lunny was
not certain at last notice whether j
the Pollies would enter a contender
in this division and probably will
not know until shortly before the
first bell. In the event this bout
is run off, the Cards will be rep- j
resented by Fred Ten Eyck, a cagey i
and experienced lad upon whom
Lunny is counting heavily this sea
son.
Willie (not Wooly) Altus will also
do a solo at the 155-pound slot, only
one bout being scheduled in this j
division. Willie has been busting
beaks and mauling midriffs for •
Stanford for three years now and ;
the odds are good for an impressive
performance in this battle.
Ailing Bob Hudson may or may
not see action tonight, depending
upon his condition. In case Hudson
does not crawl between the ropes,
he will be replaced by Max Money

in one of the two scheduled 145-
pound bouts. Alan Anderson will
do the rockin' and sockin' for the
Indians in the other battle in this
division.
Jay Savage, who slugged his way
to an impressive record as a sopho
more on Lunny's crew last year, is
a sure contender at 135 pounds; but
the Card battler in the second light
weight fray is still uncertain. Jose
Rael will handle the assignment if
a last-moment decision determines
his eligibi'ity; otherwise Bob Baker
will get the nod.
The mighty mite of Stanford's
slugging aggregation, Perry Ah~
Tye, will be Lunny's only entry in
the 130-pound division.
Lunny has high hopes that this
year's squad will improve on the
record of his 1948 varsity; and to
night's results will be closely
watched by local fistic fanatics. In
any event, a lively evening is a
certainty•
