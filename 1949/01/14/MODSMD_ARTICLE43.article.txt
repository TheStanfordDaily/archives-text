contest will be played on the Rugby Field and is scheduled to
start at 2 p.m.
With two weeks of practice under their belts, the Indian rug-

gers are in good shape and ready
to start what promises to be a very
successful season. There will be no
preliminary game involving the
Junior Varsity tomorrow, but Coach
Chuck Taylor plans to substitute
freely and every man on the squad
will probably see action.
Eight Games
A schedule of eight games has
been drawn up which includes two
inter-collegiate contests—one with
Cal and one with UCLA. The other
games are with the Olympic Club,
University Club, Menlo Ramblers,
and Petaluma.

Boyd Benson who has looked good
in practice and will probably start
at one of the wing positions. Notice

Sloss. Sloss injured his leg in the
middle of last season and is still

favoring it. However, he is now:
serving as a coach and may be able
