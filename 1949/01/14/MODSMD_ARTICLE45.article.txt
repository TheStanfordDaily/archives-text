Battling Bob Fitzgerald, the St.
Mary's sports editor who slings
nasty nothings into the ears of Gael
athletes, is on the rampage again.
Fitzgerald, the typewriter-tyrant
who first put the skids under loot
ball coach Jimmy Phelan, is getting
much publicity again over his re
cent attack on Benny Neff, the wild
and woo'y Gael cage mentor.
As Fitz sees it, Benny is just too
boisterous and tough on the gallop
ers. But maybe if Fitz would take
a good look at St. Mary's record, he
would forgive Benny for his bad
taste.
It all started when Filzgeralch let
his typewriter explode with the fol
lowing dirt: "Benny Neff s boister
ousness is getting under the spec
tators' skins. His constant yelling
at his players makes them more
nervous. The students wince at
Benny's poor choice of adjectives."
Fitzgerald went on to say that
coaching high school, which Neff
does at the same time, is much dif
ferent than coaching college ball.
Bui so what? Why all the clamor
over a mere observation. What's
really funny is when fanatic Fitz
starts whipping down his beloved
players.
He thinks that "Apples" Kudelka
does not conduct himself as an All-
American should. He says that
Frank, that's "Apples'" name, needs
more poise and should v:et over his
nervousness.
