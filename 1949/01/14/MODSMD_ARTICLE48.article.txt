# 'Free Substitution' Rule Is Revised
## 
### 
PALM SPRINGS, Jan. 13 i,Pi,-
The National Intercollegiate Foot
ball Rules Committee, rewriting the
rule book, today revised the highly
controversial "free substitution" reg
ulation.
Winding up their annual session,
members decided:
To eliminate the rule that per
mitted one substitute to enter the
game while the clock was running.
When the bail changes hands from
one team to another and the clock
is running, there will be no restric
tion on the number of substitutes
sent in by either or I oth teams, but
all of this must be accomplished
and the players ready to go within
the regulation 25 seconds after the
referee has placed the ball down.
Unchanged is the rule that both
teams can substitute all the players
desired when the clock is stopped.
Also unchanged is the rule that
an injured player may be replaced
without loss of a time-out, and the
opposing team on such an occasion
can substitute as many men as is
desired.
Chairman William J. Bingham of
Harvard said the committee felt
that the chances neither liberalized
nor modified the unlimited substi
tution rule.
There were other changes in the
rule book, designed to encourage
offensive tactics.
