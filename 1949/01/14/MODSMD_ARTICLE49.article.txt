# Braves Clash with Blues; Card Freshmen Face Cubs
## 
### 
Coach Phil Bengtson's Braves,
loaded with talent and ready to go,
will invade Berkeley Gym tonight
to battle the Cal Blues in their
third meeting of the yeai.
Having .split in their first two
name series with the Blues, Bengt
son s boys will be gunning for a win
to go out in front in- their five
game schedule with Cal.
Both the previous contests have
been one-point affairs, as the Blues
drew first blood, only to lose their
advantage the next time out.
Leading the Braves will be
speedy Gay Bryan and Jack O'Sul
livan at the forwards. Bryan, al
most as fast on the hardwood as he
is on the cinderpath, gets down
court quick on the last break and
[licks up easy points.
O Sullivan, although injured in
the MofYett Field onslaught last
week, is ready to l;o : t the other
forward spot. He is a clever ball
handler.
Handling the center chores will
be hook - shot specialist Dick
Schutie and giant Dave Atchison.
Schutte will get the opening nod.
Also expecting to see action here is
Bob Mattson. who has been doub
ling for Cal's Bill Hagler during the
varsity scrimmage sessions this
week.
Jack Scharfen, who held Chuck
Hanger pjetty wel last season, and
former frosh captain Dick Clegg
wiil handle the guard jobs. Schar
fen is a smooth performer, and
teamed up with the hardworking
Clesg, the two make a top defen
sive combination.
Pistol Pete Layman, an experi
enced utility man. can Jill in at
either forward or guard, and should
see extensive action.

Ah. yes. there's good news for'
the Farm frosh tonight.
Jim Ramstead, last year's prep {
sensation ot' the hardwood, has suf- |
| ficiently recovered from an early
season back injury to return to the j
; court wars, and will see action in j
tonight's battle against the Cal
i Cubs.
I The erstwhile Lincoln High flash j
will be forced to perform his court
antics while encased in a special ;
corset designed to protect his ach
ing back: but Frosh Coach Bobby ;
Burnett stated that the strapping
shouldn't hinder Jim to any great |
extent.
However. Ramstead has been
side'ined since the tint few days of j
basketball practice, and has not had j
ample opportunity as yet to attain j
top form. He will not start in this
i evening's contest, but will be held ;
for reserve duty.
The freshman squac's are sched
uled to commence hostilities in j
their Little Big Game at 5:45 at the
i Berkeley gym. It will He the first
: meeting of the season for the two
arch-enemies, the second round to
be held tomorrow night at 7 at the
Stanford Pavilion.
The Cardbabes have thus far en
joyed a highly successful season,
with the exception of three defeats
â€¢ pinned on them by their colleagues,
the Stanford Braves. They have im
proved consistently all season; and,
with the addition of Ramstead to
bolster their forces, the Encina
men have every intention of giving
the Cubs a very tough evening in
deed.
Ron Carver and Jim Walsh will
' handle the starting forward posi- j
tions at Berkeley: long Gary An
j drews will be at the center slot; and
Bruce Iversoti and Tom Glickbarg
i will open in the back court.
