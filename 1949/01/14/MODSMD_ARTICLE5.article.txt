WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (rP).—
Herbert Hoover asked Congress to
day to give President Truman broad
power to overhaul the government,
declaring that present disorder is
costing the nation "heavily."'
The former Republican chief ex
ecutive. chairman of a commis
sion on government reorganization,
urged that Mr. Truman be granted
even greater reshuffling authority
than that which Congress reluc
tantly gave President Roosevelt in
1939.
Congress Keeps Veto
Under the old Reorganization
Act, which expired March 31, Con
gress kept the right to veto changes
proposed by the President and al
most a score of agencies were la
beled ' Do Not Touch." '
But Hoover asserted, "The power
of the President to prepare and
transmit plans of reorganization to
the Congress should not be restrict
ed by limitations or exemptions."
"Once the limiting or exempting
process is begun," he said, "it. will
end the possibility of achieving
really substantial results.''
The former President made hi?
recommendations in identical let
ters to the Senate and House.
The Commission, he said, did no f
"ive "sweeping endorsement to any
and all reorganization plans.''
Reorganization Ba''ly Needed
He said Congress could keep it*~
"ower to disaoovove, whi'e a "soutk
exercise of the President's discre
tion" would offer an addition? 1
"safeguard against unwise reorgan
ization."
But he stressed that a gener? l
reshuffling of "the most gi«anti r
business on earth" is badly needed
