Rose ran into Economic troubles. Milt is fast, has a pood variety of fakes,
and makes the team move fast. Has plenty of pepper. O'Neil, the goat of
the USC game, is California's top scoring threat. He is rugged, plays
hard, and has a good eye from the corners. EDGE: EVEN.
:t2 YARDLEY K-5 forward 5-11 NICHOLS 4
Blond George, the high-jumping birdman. will be outstanding man on.
the floor if his knee holds out. Hurt against UCLA, he has been bothered

scored Steve last time they met. EDGE: STEPHENSON.
4 DAVIDSON guard WALKER 9
Dave was the mainstay of the Card attack against UCLA, and also
turned in a top effort against USC. He is always dependable, conies

Division. Spidery Bob Walker started out as a forward, was switched tc
this spot, and has gone well ever since. He has a two-handed long shot
that connects on a devastating percentage of tries. Also good on the
boards, Bob is the only returning letierman. EDGE: DAVIDSON.
5 LEWIS (S-4 guard 6-1 THOMPSON 11
Bob has been superb on building up a defensive record against the top
scoring artists in the business. Dan Endsley tabs him as the best defensive
guard on the Coast. He has had trouble finding the scoring column, but
last week outscored Clutska, 2 to 1. Cal's second guard spot is switched

this spot, and has gone well ever since. He has a two-handed long shot
that connects on a devastating percentage of tries. Also good on the
boards, Bob is the only returning letierman. EDGE: DAVIDSON.
