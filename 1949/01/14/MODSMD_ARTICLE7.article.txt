## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (/P).—
Dean Acheson scornfully rejected
descriptions of himself as an "ap
peaser"' toward Russia today and
promised to root any Reds out of
the State Department.
Acheson is President Truman's
choice as the next Secretary of
State.
Testifying before the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, Acheson
volunteered the comment that he is
still "friends" with Alger Hiss, in
dicted former State Department of
ficial and key figure in the 1948 spy
investigations.
He suggested, by implication, that
; udgment on Hiss's guilt or inno
cence should await the outcome of
his perjury trial.
Opposition Silent
As the jam-packed hearing went
on, a heralded possible source of
opposition to Acheson's confirma
tion failed to develop. Former As
sistant Secretary of State Adolf A.
Berle Jr. telegraphed the Senate
committee. "I do not oppose his
(Acheson's) confirmation and no
implications to that effect are war
ranted "
Berle said it was true that in the
f all of 1944 he and Acheson differed
on Russian policy. He said he lu>d
-•o confidence that Russian expan
sionism could be halted by a pol
icy of wide concessions, while "Mr.
\cheson like other men in the gov
°rnment at that time felt other
wise."
Berle's Telegrem
Berle's teleeram continued:
"As I have repeatedly stated, the
•natter was one on which honest
could differ, and I never
"elt that divergence on this oues
i;on reflected on the competence or
'ovaltv of men who went along with
the Policy then adopted."
Berle did not sav precisely tln't
he supports Acheson's nomination,
hut he fee's
Secretary of State should tfVe ofPce
j un.er conditions giving him the

best possible chance of complete
success ''for which ho has my best
wishes.''
Acheson told the Senate group
that accusations labeling him an
"appeaser" are "so incredible it is
difficult for me to believe that even
disinterested malevolence could
think them up."
And he said 'of course'" he is
interested in rooting out any dis
loyal employees in the State De
partment.
Rallying to Acfceson's support,
former Secretary of State Edward
R. Stettinius Jr. told the Senate
group that the late President Roo
sevelt had "very great confidence'
in Acheson and had made up his
mind to appoint him to "one of the
highest posts of this government."

mind to appoint him to "one of the
highest posts of this government."
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (/P).—
Dean Acheson scornfully rejected
descriptions of himself as an "ap
peaser"' toward Russia today and
promised to root any Reds out of
the State Department.
Acheson is President Truman's
choice as the next Secretary of
State.
Testifying before the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, Acheson
volunteered the comment that he is
still "friends" with Alger Hiss, in
dicted former State Department of
ficial and key figure in the 1948 spy
investigations.
He suggested, by implication, that
; udgment on Hiss's guilt or inno
cence should await the outcome of
his perjury trial.
Opposition Silent
As the jam-packed hearing went
on, a heralded possible source of
opposition to Acheson's confirma
tion failed to develop. Former As
sistant Secretary of State Adolf A.
Berle Jr. telegraphed the Senate
committee. "I do not oppose his
(Acheson's) confirmation and no
implications to that effect are war
ranted "
Berle said it was true that in the
f all of 1944 he and Acheson differed
on Russian policy. He said he lu>d
-•o confidence that Russian expan
sionism could be halted by a pol
icy of wide concessions, while "Mr.
\cheson like other men in the gov
°rnment at that time felt other
wise."
Berle's Telegrem
Berle's teleeram continued:
"As I have repeatedly stated, the
•natter was one on which honest
could differ, and I never
"elt that divergence on this oues
i;on reflected on the competence or
'ovaltv of men who went along with
the Policy then adopted."
Berle did not sav precisely tln't
he supports Acheson's nomination,
hut he fee's
Secretary of State should tfVe ofPce
j un.er conditions giving him the

best possible chance of complete
success ''for which ho has my best
wishes.''
Acheson told the Senate group
that accusations labeling him an
"appeaser" are "so incredible it is
difficult for me to believe that even
disinterested malevolence could
think them up."
And he said 'of course'" he is
interested in rooting out any dis
loyal employees in the State De
partment.
Rallying to Acfceson's support,
former Secretary of State Edward
R. Stettinius Jr. told the Senate
group that the late President Roo
sevelt had "very great confidence'
in Acheson and had made up his
mind to appoint him to "one of the
highest posts of this government."
