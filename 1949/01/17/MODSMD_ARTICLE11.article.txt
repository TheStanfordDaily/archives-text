## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
Lively, blue-eyed Jane Dar
well is looking forward to her
forthcoming role in the Stanford
Players' production, "Build No
Fence Around Me."
I enjoy doing comedy or some
one mean. They're always better
acting parts. I m so sick of playing
sweet mothers!"
Miss Darwell, plump, middle-aged,
and gracious, knows whereof she
speaks in the theater world. A vet
eran ot 33 years on the stage and
screen, she walked off with an Os
car in '40 for her portrayal of Ma
Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath."
As Maw Bevin, she will play the
part ot a lusty, gay old gal of about
<3. who creates hilarious havoc on

a Texas ranch.
She has long played character
parts in preference to leads. Her
roles.have ranged all the way from
a nun in "Three Wise Fools," star
ring Margaret O'Brien, to a woman
of the West who was (well, anything
but holy) in "My Darling Clem
entine."
Miss Darwell arrived here lost
week from Hollywood, where she
has just completed "Three God
lathers" for John Ford and the Uni
versal picture "Red Canyon."
She brought with her "Coquette."
her chocolate brown French poodle.
"Coco" is the only animal speci
men in her charge now, but back
in '41 she was foster mother to 14
uops and 17 cats. "I just had the
haHt of picking up stray dogs," she
explains.

Iler main hobby, she laughs, is
earning a living. But next to that
she 11 settle lor a nice, long, car ride.
She loves traveling, and was on the
the road "3 weeks with an all-star
cast ot "The Doll's House."
Miss Darwell. whose real name is
Patti Woodarcl, wai born in Mis
souri and received her education in
exclusive Eastern girls' schools. In
school plays she always took the part
of men "because the clothes fit."
She also headed a glee club. "Oh. I
j used to singâ€”beautifully, I thought,"
she says with a twinkle in her eyes
and a jaunty flounce of her head.
She studied voice and piano in
Boston and voice ami drama in Eu
j rope before beginning her screen
'career.
Up to 1941? Miss Darwell had
J played in more than 80 pictures, in
-1 eluding "Gone With the Wind."
I But she almost missed getting the
role which was to bring her reeog-
I nition as a supporting actress.
Studio executives, in looking for
a person to play the part of Ma
Joad, were very impressed with a
, screen test which was shown just
prior to Jane Darwell's, and wanted
to assign the actress to the part.
Someone asked them if they weren't
j even going to look at the last few
remaining tests, and they reluctantly
returned to their seats.
When they saw Miss Darwell's
performance they agreed that she
was Ma Joad. Those who saw the
! movie will long remember the iook
011 her face as she said. "Rich fellas
come up and they die. And their
kids ain't no good an' they die out.
But we keep a-comin'. We're the
people that live. Can't nobody evei
wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us
We'll go on forever. We're the peo
ple." _
Miss Darwell is staying with
: friends until Friday, when she and
"Coco" will move to a motel in
Sunnyvale foi' the remainder of re
hearsal and production time.
Asked if she thought "Build No
Fence Around Me" had possibilities
for Broadway production, Miss Dar
well replied. "I think it has a great
deal of merit. It's very well written,
and certainly h?is a chance."
