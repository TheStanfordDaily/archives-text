(L *. note: This is the last in a
serifs ui three ai lilies on Ilie
Honor Code.)
Is it fair to grade undergraduates
on a curve based 011 the grades of
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents alike? The Honor Code
Standing Committee thinks not.
We believe that the professors in
undergraduate courses should, base
their grading curves on the work
of undergraduates alone, then put
the graduate students into the
curve,* said Hawley Smith, Honor
Code Committee chairman, explain
ing the committee's stand.
Smith teels that graduate stu
dent. while not necessarily having
a better background in any partic
ular course, have the advantage in
being more mature, having perhaps
a l etter sense of values, knowing
how to study more efficiently, and
having developed a greater reser
voir of general knowledge that may
be helpful in the course. But cam
paigning' for this improvement in the
grading system is only one of the
tasks confronting the Honor Code
Committee.
The committee must acquaint in
coming freshmen and transfer stu
dents, as well as new faculty mem
bers. with the ideals and practical
workings of the Honor Code. Often
the committee is called upon to help
other universities set up honor sys
tems along the lines of the Stanford
Honor Code.
The Honor Code Committee has
been divided into sub-committees
to facilitate more efficient handling
of these responsibilities.
Headed by debater Dow Carpen
ter, the Speakers' Bureau provides
competent speakers, authorities on
the history and workings of the
Honor Code, to address groups of
new students and faculty and to
"spread the gospel" at other schools.
In the near future. Carpenter him
self will discuss the Honor Code
with resident advisers on the Row.
The Examination Files Commit
tee. headed by Edwinna Bedell,
maintains a file of mid-quarter and
final examinations in the reserve
book room of the main library. This

Lie was stalled to provide all stu
lents with a reference source th it
! had previously been available only
to those students living in resi
dences that maintained their own
examination files.
Under Don Wells, the Student-
Faculty Relations Committee is
charged chiefly with instructing
new faculty members in their re
sponsibilities in the honor system.
Wells emphasizes the fact that pro
fessors should outline the Honor
Code responsibility in their courses,
with respect to quizzes, exams,
homework, papers, and so on.
The Orientation Committee, un
der Eloise Beil, acquaints new stu
dents with the Honor Code . . . .
how it was introduced at Stanford
and how it works. The individual's
responsibilities are stressed. *A four
page pamphlet prepared by this
committee is available to interested
persons and is distributed to new
students and faculty members.
Ihe keynote of the Honor
Code." Smith maintains, "is the
third - person responsibility. Stu
dents must not only observe the
Honor Code themselves, but must
support the Code by reporting vio
lations.
"Too olten. there can be a con
tusion ol loyalties between the
Code an 1 a close friend. The re
sponsibility for making the system
work lies directly upon the stu
dent.*'
The question of the Code's rela
tion to the Fundamental Standard
has been asked many times. Smith
emphasizes that the Honor Code is
distinctly apart from the Standard
and governs conduct in academic
alone.
The Honor Code at Stanford has
three basic phases, and the respon
sibility for each lies in a different
direction. The Honor Code Stand
ing Committee educates students
and faculty to the tradition of the
C.ode. and Men's and Women's
Councils treat violations.
But in practice the responsibility
lies directly upon the students. The
Honor Code is one of Stanford's
most revered traditions ... a tra
dition that works lor every student
and instructor to insure fairness and
equality in the business oi learning.
Its success rests upon our ability to
recognize its true value and to sup
port the Honor Code wholeheart
edly.
