# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Editor's Cuff Notes 
### 
Controversy over The Daily's Friday editorial ranged from
praise to "Do the editors know what they're talking about?"
Without recourse to our large dossier of case history com
plaints on women's regulations and Women's Council opera
lions, let us say that generally, our stand is this:
For just about three years now we've been conscious that
the theory of women's regulations seems to be that the women
are helpless. Regulations and interpretations—both social and
and academic—have been amended constantly. "Orientation"
reached a new height autumn quarter when it covered a full
week.
It seems to us that rather than developing a spirit of obeying
the necessary regulations, the persons and organizations in
charge have somehow given birth to a policy of lying-in-wait,
pouncing on technicalities, and unnecessarily upsetting the
women. Women's Council's "third-degree" methods and oft
times star-chamber tactics seem to serve no useful purpose.
At the same time, there is helpful service that could be given
women—in addition to regulations, technicalities, etc. We're
thinking particularly of the Lagunita RA who explained some of
the girls' problems. "They ask us question we should be able to
answer, but don't. All we do is tell them about this regulation
or that rule," she said.
Over at Encina, freshmen aren't fettered by too many regu
lations or too much "orientation." Neither do they worry about
spy systems or a vindictive council. But they lean heavily on
their sponsors for advice. And if you ask them, they'll tell you
unashamedly that their sponsors are "great guys."
When a student-faculty committee meets in the near future
to talk over women's social regulations and problems concerning
punishments of infractions, the foregoing paragraphs will gen
erally reflect The Daily's stand.

An example of how a student council can do constructive
work is the Honor Code Standing Committee. In addition to
promoting honorable conduct in academic work, the committee
is working for fair play by the faculty. Some professors with
mixed classes of graduates and undergraduates are still grading
on one curve, the Committee says, and the Committee is trying
?o have the practice eliminated completely. Undergraduates
should be graded on a separate curve.

A new Pavilion is still many years away. In the meantime, 1
many students—too many students—are disappointed at not
getting tickets to the game. To make the best situation for all, j
some arrangement should be made so that everyone could see
SOME of the games. Perhaps an "A" and "B" ticket schedule,
that is in effect elsewhere, would do the trick. They way it
works is that a student is issued either an "A" or "B" ticket. The
"A" ticket will permit the student to obtain tickets for half the
games, and the "B" ticket the other half.
