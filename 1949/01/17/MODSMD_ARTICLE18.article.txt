On the Verge of a Dinge

If the dean doesn't take back what he said to me this morning, I'm
going to leave school.
He told me to leave school.
He thought I was cheating in an astronomy exam the other day just

because he l'ound me banging my head against the
wall.
But I'm really pursuing my studies quite faith
fully. At least. I'm always behind. Put some liniment
on my arm the other night, and it made it smart.
Tonight I'm putting some on my head. Hope it works.
I ically am getting better marks lately, though.
Dad's away and I'm doing my own home work now.
Besides, I can do one thing better than anyone else
in the whole world. I can read my own handwriting

Of course, in that capacity me and my brother are quite a bit alike.
Had my English composition teacher tell me the other morning that our
-ast essays entitled '"My Mother" were exactly alike. I don't know what
he was so sore about. After all, ain't we not the same mother?
We had to write another composition on "What I Would Do if I Had
$50,000." I turned in a blank sheet of paper .... because that 's exactly
A-hat I'd do if I had $50,000.
The teacher asked me if I'd ever taken chloroform. I told her I didn't
even know who taught it.
Everything is just tno speeded up nowadays. Why, a Stanford student
.eft class to go to the washroom the other day and missed his entire
junior year.
I get so tired that sometimes I just have to go to sleep in class. The
prof bawled me out the other day. lie told me 1 couldn't sleep in his
class. T could if he didn't talk so loud, though. Really, though, I'm glad
school has started again. I need the rest.
I overslept a little this morning. The teacher asked me why I was
late, so 1 told her "Class started before I got there," T said. I didn't think
she'd believe me if I told her the truth. Actually, there are eight of us
in the dorm wing and the alarm was set for seven. That's why I over
slept.
I did call up first to t< 11 them I wouldn't be there. Some nice-sounding,
gullible woman answered (he phone. "LoefTelbein won't be able to attend
cl-'ss (his morning. He's k " I (old her. "Who is this," she comes
vuk with. "This is my roommate," I answered. Never underestimate
the power of a woman!
