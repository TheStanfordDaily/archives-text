# "Thou Shalt Not Commit Stupidity"

"Hey, Moses, thought up any new
amendments to your command
ments?" asked St. Vitus as the two
met on Golden Avenue.
"No," mourned Moses, "they can't
even keep the ones I've given them,
yet."
"I know," replied St. Vitus toler
antly. "But they might like the op
portunity of having new sins every
now and then."
"I've been thinking about some,"
confessed Moses. "I thought about
forbidding intelligence. That way,
when they break the commandment,
they may create a Heaven on earth
though they may roast in Hell for
ever afterward."
Paved Road
"And they will, too!" confirmed
St. Augustine as he joined the small
group. "Ho 1 ! is paved with the
skulls of scholars," he continued,
quoting from the Heavenly Hand
book of Orientation given to all new
angels.
"Then why are there so many
Stanford professors up here?" ques
tioned St. Vitus. "They wear the
brightest crowns of all."
"Simple deduction," retorted Au
gustine. "They don't fall under that
classification. See that history prof
down there vaccinating all the stu
dents against curiosity? He tells the
class where the world has been and
where it is going. There is no room
for doubtâ€”for he is an authority.
Such authorities always spend the
minimum time in Hell before com
ing up here. He is a natural for our
Predestination Council.
Loyalty Check
"Now observe that poor education
prof in the next room. He has just
told the class how to judge the com
petence of teachers. Obviously he
has no class loyalty, a traitor to his
species, no moral integrity. He'll be
just another paving stone on the
alleys of He!l."
"You're right as usual," said
Moses. "In my next commandment
I'll insert a clause forbidding stu
pidity. When that commandment is
broken (as usual) we'll get more
people up here, relieve the housing
shortage in Hell, make our land
'ords happy, and I'll get a new
chrome-plated halo."
"Splendid idea!" cried St. Vitus,
dancing up and down. "I say, fel
lows. let's give Moses six big rahs!
"Tut." said Moses bashfully,
"make it six hallelujahs, please."
