Half-Truths
To the Editor:
"Appeasementâ€” 1949" is a mas
terpiece of half-truths. The author
states that Dean Acheson's appoint
ment as Secretary of State indicates
appeasement toward Russia and in
timates that Marshall was forced to
resign. He neglects to mention that
Dean Acheson was one of the for
mulators of the Marshall Plan and a
former member of that very State
Department he applauds for its
stand against Russia.
Secretary Marshad has asked
President Truman to accept his res
ignation three times in the past
year, but Truman prevailed upon
him to remain until Jan. 20. Mar
shall is not a well man. A few
weeks ago he had a kidney re
moved. Even anti - Truman com
mentators will admit his resignation
was voluntary.
