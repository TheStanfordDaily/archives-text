# Air Force Money
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - A key Senate
Democrat may upset President Tru
man's budget plans for the Air
Force. He is Senator Elmer Thomas
(D., Okla.), who expects to be
chairman of the appropriations com
mittee's military subcommittee
which will have a big say in how
much money the Air Force, Army,
and Navy are going to get.
The President wants about $14,-
000.000.000 split almost evenly be
tween the three forces. But Thomas
leans to the view that the service
that will do most of the fighting in
any future war should have the
most money. He puts it this way:
"I am convinced that in the future
a war will be conducted very large
ly in the air. The Air Force is com
ing to be very rapid'y—if it is not
already—the backbone of our mili
tary establishment.'"
