# Hoover-NACA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Hoo v e r
commission will recommend that
i the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics (NACA) be put
I under the Commerce Department.
Now an independent agency with
direct access to the White House,
| NACA docr-n't like the idea a little
bit.
The Hoover commission will give
as its reason thnt it would be more
; satisfactory for budgetary reasons
for NACA to operate through a
cabinet agency.
