### AL McCOMBS 
Modern science has brought the beginnings of a new social
i reform to Stanford—in the form of television.
TV made its official Farm debut this month at the Chi Psi
lodge, home of the University's most practiced football prognos
ticators.
Located in the fraternity's Bull Room, among the rest of its

trophies, is one of the latest models
in the line of television receivers.
! Here members of the house while
away the hours while books lie un
j read and the Palo Alto theaters are
unpatronized.
The latest Chi Psi trophy was the
first place prize in a fall-quarter
, football score guessing contest spon
sored by a cigarette company.

Envious of the Chi Psi's video set,
| other fraternities on the Row are
reported to fce raising cash to bring
i television to their houses.
The Frosh at Encina have been
selling magazine subscriptions dur
ing the past quarter to raise money
, for a set to install in their lobby.
' University sociologists predict that
the ever-increasing stay-at-home
trend in American families through
out the nation—the result of TV —
may soon rcfiect a change on campus

1 life, once television becomes firmly
I entrenched.

El Camino's dimly-lighted "res
taurants," realizing the effect of this
social change, have installed tele
j vision sets to ensure continued pa
tronage from the Farm. Under
handicap are the Portola Road beer
gardens, where the presence of the
rolling foothills blocks reception
from San Francisco.
1 While television receiving is new
to Stanford, students and athletes
j here have been the subject of at
least two sendings. The first
event took place at Ann Arbor,
Mich., in the fall of 1947, where
Stanford and Michigan gridders per
j formed before the cameras.
Stanford's seven foreign scholar
' ship students were also the subject
!of a television feature, shot last
spring.
