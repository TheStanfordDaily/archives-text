# Rouault, Orozco Exhibition Displays Unorthodox Art
## 
### DIXIE ANN BOOTH 
It would seem that Georges Rou
ult and Jose Clemente Orozco,
vhose prints are now on exhibition
.t the Art Gallery, each worked as
ar as possible away from most ac
epted patterns of interpretation.
The extraordinary lithographs of
louault achieve force through
ruminative contrast of harsh whites
ind sketchy blacks. This is espe
cially noticeable in his "Heads of
Two Clowns and a Woman" and
Parade."
Rouault's wood engravings are
nore highly detailed but the figures
lave the same exceptional facial
xpressions and body movement
ound in the lithographs.
Vivid veds, blues, and simple,
hick lines characterize the Rouault
â€¢olor etchings, all of which are book
>lates from '"La Passion." '
Orozco has a particular talent for
lealing with agony and suffering,
mpres.sively contorted bodies and

faces are portrayed in the semi
abstraet "Miseria" and "Reclining
Figure.'' However, his "Tourists" is
genuinely satirical and cartoon-like.
A strong contrast in style and
feeling is provided by Orozco's vi
tal, laughing '"Mexican Woman"
and the quiet, meditative portrait
detail taken from his fresco in the
National Palace of Fine Arts, Mex
ico City.
"Head" by David A. Siqueiros,
"Maya Profiles" by Roberto Monte
negro, and "La Danza de la
Muerte" by Chavez Morado are
single exhibits included in the
snowing.
The display of prints will con
tinue in the Art Gallery to Jan. 30.
