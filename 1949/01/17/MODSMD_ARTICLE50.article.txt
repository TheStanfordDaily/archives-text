## 
### 
The varsity mittmen of Stanford
.nd Cal Poly slugged their way to
i 5-5 draw Friday night at the Pa
ilion in an eight-bout card lea
rned by one knockout and two
TKO's. One bout wns forfeited by
•ach quad.
In the feature battle of the eve
ling, heavyweight Ralph Harider
»112 Cal Poly decisioned Indian Mik.-
3 elsinger in a well-fought, closely
•ontested fray. The referee's nod
n this event went to Pelsinger, but
)oth judges favored Harider in the
plit-decision voting. Despite th£
idverse decision, Mike looked very
;ood in losing, and coach Ray
Ainny expressed himself ns highly
>leased with the big boy's per
ormance.
Jarrin' Jim Hammond pounded
lis way to a clear-cut victory in
he light-heavy class as he floored
)airel Kister early in the bout and
ed the Polv pounder all the way.
Veteran Willie Altus of Stanford
howed too much experience for
erry Curtis in the battle of the 155-
lounders and was accorded the
inanimous decision of the judges
nd referee. Curtis was a willing
ierformed, but never pressed the
ing-wise Altus.
Alan Anderso.. claimed the third
-ard win by outpointing Paul Fish
•ack in one of the two 145-pound
lelees; and Jose Rael made his de
ut into intercollegiate competition
successful one by decisioning
.ambert Teledier in a lightweight
ussle. Rael looked especially good
t winning his match, according to
•unny.
The three battles which ended
rematurely saw a Stanford slug
er as the victim in each case. Max
Toney was flattened by Shunro
lomoura in the first round of their
145-pound three-round
r; light - weight Jay Savage was
jrcod to retire from competition in
ic third round of his tiff against
Lggie Les Risling; and little Perry
di-'fve was prevented by the ref
ree from answering the bell for the
,'cond round "of his slugfest with
,0-poundcr Art Eugliemelli.
I.unnv had no entry in the 125-
ound class, and the lads from San
;uis Obispo were minus a 165-
>under for Friday night's fistic
•stival: fo the two squads also drew
i the forfeit department.
Although Lunny considered the
ollies "a little too rough and
>ugh," he was very much satisfied
ith the team's performance in
eneral. "It will put them on edge
>r Santa Clara next Wednesday;
nd and I expect the boys to look a
>t better against the Broncos,"
unny said.
But the evening's work was not
'ithout casualty. Lunny disclosed
lat Pelsinger will not see action
gainst the Broncos, due to a bad
it over his eye received in the
ff with Harider. Except for big
like, the squad should be in top
mdilion for Wedneday's competi
-011.
