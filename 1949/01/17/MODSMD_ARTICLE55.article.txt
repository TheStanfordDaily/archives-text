## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 10 </P)._Only
six major college teams remained in
I basketball's unbeaten circle today
| after Cincinnati was pushed out by
I a hot Butler quintet.
| Bailer's Bulldogs have been mak-
I ing it their business to knock off
undefeated fives. They lost their
I first two games but since then have
| racked up nine wins in a row.
Cincinnati was whacked good.
I The Bearcats went down, 74-52, last
| night, to make their record 8-1.
The half-dozen all-conquering
lives are Western Kenutcky (12),
| St. Louis, Minnesota, Villanova, and
Hamline, 11 each, and Akron, 10.
J Akron and Western Kenutcky
didn't play yesterday but Minne
sota, Hamline, Villanova, and St.
Louis chalked up victories, the lat
, ter two squads barely squeezing by.
Drake's Bulldogs pressed mighty
St. Louis all the way and the Billi
kens just survived, 52-51. Easy Ed
MacAuley was held to 10 points.
: Villanova blew a big lead and was
almost caught by Manhattan. The
final score was 40-39, but a Man
hattan sub, Fred Schwartz, missed
the tying free throw with three sec
onds to go. Schwartz was put on
| the spot when John Byrnes, who
was fouled, hurt himself on the play
I and was forced to the sidelines.
Minnesota, paced by Big Jim Mc-
Intyre and Whitey Skoog, demon
strated it is one of the country's
best by polishing off Purdue at La
fayette, 07-52.
Hamline, having established it
self early as a major power with
two tournament triumphs, moved
back into its own league and
drubbed Gustavus Adolphus, 51-32.
St. Louis has the toughest task
of the unbeatens next week and
Villanova the easiest. Villanova
isn't scheduled to play again until
Jan. 29. St. Louis invades Okla
