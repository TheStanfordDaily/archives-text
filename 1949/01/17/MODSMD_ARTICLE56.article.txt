# How'er We Gonna Keep Him Down on the Farm?
## 
### SUE TOLNAY 
Stanford is a little bit of
heaven—but Paris! Maybe one
reason Claude Gizard likes the
Farm is because the sunny fall
mornings in Union Court re
mind him of the Place de la Con
corde back home.
Claude is one of Stanford's seven
foreign scholarship holders. He
Said, "I couldn't spend all my life
without going back to Paris some
time, though it's heaven here."
The ratio hasn't bothered Claude
in the least. The evening before
our interview he was a dinner guest
;it Durand with about 30 girls all
to himself. Although ho claims the
reason for this hospitality is only
.hi effort to improve international
relations, his ready grin and fas
cinating French accent may have

something to do with it.
One of the differences that Claude
not'ccd between French girls and
American girls is the number of
American women who wear trousers
and the difficulty he lias in judging
an American girl's age.
Claude is a student of economics
at Stanford, while in Paris he was
studying fur his doctorate in law.
He leels that his Stanford scholar
ship was a great piece of luck and
strongly approves the merits of the
foreign scholarship plan. His first
quarter here was spent living at the
Sigma Nu house. He enjoys frater
nity life very much.
"One of the main differences be- j
tween the French and the Ameri
cans, Claude says, "is that there '
are more common denominators in
the States." To explain he sAid that
in the United States, "everybody

likes football, cokes, comics, and
beer. -Personally, Claude believes
football is more cruel than bull
fights, but the American game, he
i admits, is exciting.
According to Claude, parties are
more fun in France, because there
is more mixing of couples. Also,
Frenchmen never drink beer, only
: alcohol. He believes that liquor on
campus would be a good idea. He
thinks it would cause less intoxi
cation than occurs at present.
"In France students don't stand
i out as such; they are just normal
i people," Claude said, as he men
i tioned that the informal dress and
I informal habits of Stanfordites were
'►sometimes carried too far.
Another American habit that puz
zled Claude was that Americans
: don t use forks as frequently as Eu

ropeans do and that their cooking
consists of astonishing mixtures—
1 salty and sweet sandwiches, for in
stance. The first time Claude or
dered a hamburger he started eating
it with tork and knife, and immed
iately had all eyes in the restaurant
: fastened on him in astonishment.
University education in France
differs considerably from this "holi
| day campus," Claude continued.
"We have finals only once a year
but have more concentrated study
throughout the term. It is harder to
; get a degree in France than it is in
1 America, and we have less time for
dating than you do."
He believes also that the French
people have yet a great deal to learn
about the United States, and he is
determined to make "gay Paree"
, Stanford-conscious upon his return.
