# Indians Win Two Over Bears
## Davidson Brilliant As Reds Take Lead 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with


EVERETT DEAN
; a couple of long shots by Payne to
j make it 65 to 63. At this point Dave
Davidson was awarded a tree throw,
and calmly dunked in the all-im
portant 63th point.
Tom Ruebel brought the Cal
| rooters to their feet with another
: two-pointer from way out to make
, it 66 to 65. but Gus Chavalas and
| Marv Gelter put on a superb dis
play of fancy dribbling and ball con
trol to save the lead and the ball
game, the first that Stanford has
] won in California's gymnasium in
: six years.
.'!() Points From Foul Line
Stanford scored a total of 30 points
lrom the tree throw line, and com
ment was made that the foreign of
ficials irom Los Angeles were too
quick with the toot, but that wasn't
the case. The Indians would get
men in pood position for a shot, and
the Bears would fcul.
Consequently the Cards were
kept bu>y scoring the singles in
stead of the doubles. li the Bi'ars
hadn't been fouling, Stanford
would have scurcd more from the
floor.
Saturday night's game was Stan
: ford s all the way. Showing a
marked improvement in board con
trol. and driving full speed, the In
dians looked like money in the bank
from the opening tip.
Cal Stubborn
California was stubborn, however,
! and kept closing up the gaps, but
i Dave Davidson's final burst of four
1 field goals coupled with a Bob Lewis
J felt-handed push from the key, was
too much for the Golden Bear.
The game started with Yardley
dropping in a set-up off an alert pass
by Davidson, and soon Stanford had
jumped into a 17 to 8 lead.
i Cal s O Neill and Payne pushed in
points in a row, but a variety of
Stephenson talent, namely a hook
from the key. a 35-foot push shot,
and a tip. coming in that order.
*ave Stanford a 24 to 22 half-time
lead.
After the rest period, with David
son and Stephenson in the driver's
seat, Stanford started to build again.
Three different times Dean's men
stretched out their lead, only to have
the pesky Bears rally to close the
gap.
Da\id.HOu. Davidson, Davidson
Finally, after Cal had tied it. 39
to 39, with 9 minutes left, Gus Cha
valas tanked in a charity toss to
touch oft the last bombardment.
Davidson again came through with
clutch buckets, and George Yardley
iced it with an over-the-head-back
wards !ay-in. Davidson added the
final touches to his sensational per
formance by scoring 4 more points,
as Stanford retired with a 55 to 48
I win in its hip-pocket.
The Cards climbed back into the
Southern Division co-leadership
with USC when the Trojans dropped
a 74 to G8 overtime to UCLA on
I Friday night, only to out-scrap the
i Bruins, 59 to 52. Saturday night.
Stanford's next crack at Sam Bar
ry s Trojans will not come up until

Fob. 12, at which time USC will play
host at the Olympic Auditorium in
Los Angeles.
Carver Comes Through
Stanford's return to form, although
largely sparked by Davidson and
Stephenson, was also due to come
through playing by the reserves.
Ralph Carver, backing up Steve at
center, looked absolutely great in
his brief appearances. Carver never
loses a pass, and is one of the best
feeders in the business.
Bill Lewis also was a valuable
man to have around. Playing behind i
Yardley, he dropped in -some nice |
long shots to inject timely energy I
in the Stanford attack.
Milt Iverson, working efficiently,
did not have a good weekend at the
. scoreboard, but that happens to the
best of them. George Yardley, still
favoring his knee a lot, also was ,
slowed up in the adding machine de
partment, but George's work on
Friday night was indispensable.
He should be really ready to go
by the time Stanford invades Los j
| Angeles in two weeks.
On the whole, the weekend was j
the most successful that Stanford '
cagers have seen since the hallowed '
days of Dallmar, Pollard, and the :
boom boys of 1943.

ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with


EVERETT DEAN
; a couple of long shots by Payne to
j make it 65 to 63. At this point Dave
Davidson was awarded a tree throw,
and calmly dunked in the all-im
portant 63th point.
Tom Ruebel brought the Cal
| rooters to their feet with another
: two-pointer from way out to make
, it 66 to 65. but Gus Chavalas and
| Marv Gelter put on a superb dis
play of fancy dribbling and ball con
trol to save the lead and the ball
game, the first that Stanford has
] won in California's gymnasium in
: six years.
.'!() Points From Foul Line
Stanford scored a total of 30 points
lrom the tree throw line, and com
ment was made that the foreign of
ficials irom Los Angeles were too
quick with the toot, but that wasn't
the case. The Indians would get
men in pood position for a shot, and
the Bears would fcul.
Consequently the Cards were
kept bu>y scoring the singles in
stead of the doubles. li the Bi'ars
hadn't been fouling, Stanford
would have scurcd more from the
floor.
Saturday night's game was Stan
: ford s all the way. Showing a
marked improvement in board con
trol. and driving full speed, the In
dians looked like money in the bank
from the opening tip.
Cal Stubborn
California was stubborn, however,
! and kept closing up the gaps, but
i Dave Davidson's final burst of four
1 field goals coupled with a Bob Lewis
J felt-handed push from the key, was
too much for the Golden Bear.
The game started with Yardley
dropping in a set-up off an alert pass
by Davidson, and soon Stanford had
jumped into a 17 to 8 lead.
i Cal s O Neill and Payne pushed in
points in a row, but a variety of
Stephenson talent, namely a hook
from the key. a 35-foot push shot,
and a tip. coming in that order.
*ave Stanford a 24 to 22 half-time
lead.
After the rest period, with David
son and Stephenson in the driver's
seat, Stanford started to build again.
Three different times Dean's men
stretched out their lead, only to have
the pesky Bears rally to close the
gap.

Finally, after Cal had tied it. 39

iced it with an over-the-head-back

final touches to his sensational per

The Cards climbed back into the

Stanford's next crack at Sam Bar
ry s Trojans will not come up until

Fob. 12, at which time USC will play
host at the Olympic Auditorium in
Los Angeles.
Carver Comes Through
Stanford's return to form, although
largely sparked by Davidson and
Stephenson, was also due to come
through playing by the reserves.
Ralph Carver, backing up Steve at
center, looked absolutely great in
his brief appearances. Carver never
loses a pass, and is one of the best
feeders in the business.
Bill Lewis also was a valuable
man to have around. Playing behind i
Yardley, he dropped in -some nice |
long shots to inject timely energy I
in the Stanford attack.
Milt Iverson, working efficiently,
did not have a good weekend at the
. scoreboard, but that happens to the
best of them. George Yardley, still
favoring his knee a lot, also was ,
slowed up in the adding machine de
partment, but George's work on
Friday night was indispensable.
He should be really ready to go
by the time Stanford invades Los j
| Angeles in two weeks.
On the whole, the weekend was j
the most successful that Stanford '
cagers have seen since the hallowed '
days of Dallmar, Pollard, and the :
boom boys of 1943.

Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with


EVERETT DEAN
; a couple of long shots by Payne to
j make it 65 to 63. At this point Dave
Davidson was awarded a tree throw,
and calmly dunked in the all-im
portant 63th point.
Tom Ruebel brought the Cal
| rooters to their feet with another
: two-pointer from way out to make
, it 66 to 65. but Gus Chavalas and
| Marv Gelter put on a superb dis
play of fancy dribbling and ball con
trol to save the lead and the ball
game, the first that Stanford has
] won in California's gymnasium in
: six years.
.'!() Points From Foul Line
Stanford scored a total of 30 points
lrom the tree throw line, and com
ment was made that the foreign of
ficials irom Los Angeles were too
quick with the toot, but that wasn't
the case. The Indians would get
men in pood position for a shot, and
the Bears would fcul.
Consequently the Cards were
kept bu>y scoring the singles in
stead of the doubles. li the Bi'ars
hadn't been fouling, Stanford
would have scurcd more from the
floor.
Saturday night's game was Stan
: ford s all the way. Showing a
marked improvement in board con
trol. and driving full speed, the In
dians looked like money in the bank
from the opening tip.
Cal Stubborn
California was stubborn, however,
! and kept closing up the gaps, but
i Dave Davidson's final burst of four
1 field goals coupled with a Bob Lewis
J felt-handed push from the key, was
too much for the Golden Bear.
The game started with Yardley
dropping in a set-up off an alert pass
by Davidson, and soon Stanford had
jumped into a 17 to 8 lead.
i Cal s O Neill and Payne pushed in
points in a row, but a variety of
Stephenson talent, namely a hook
from the key. a 35-foot push shot,
and a tip. coming in that order.
*ave Stanford a 24 to 22 half-time
lead.

Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with


EVERETT DEAN
; a couple of long shots by Payne to
j make it 65 to 63. At this point Dave
Davidson was awarded a tree throw,
and calmly dunked in the all-im
portant 63th point.
Tom Ruebel brought the Cal
| rooters to their feet with another
: two-pointer from way out to make
, it 66 to 65. but Gus Chavalas and
| Marv Gelter put on a superb dis
play of fancy dribbling and ball con
trol to save the lead and the ball
game, the first that Stanford has
] won in California's gymnasium in
: six years.
.'!() Points From Foul Line
Stanford scored a total of 30 points
lrom the tree throw line, and com
ment was made that the foreign of
ficials irom Los Angeles were too
quick with the toot, but that wasn't
the case. The Indians would get
men in pood position for a shot, and
the Bears would fcul.
Consequently the Cards were
kept bu>y scoring the singles in
stead of the doubles. li the Bi'ars
hadn't been fouling, Stanford
would have scurcd more from the
floor.
Saturday night's game was Stan
: ford s all the way. Showing a
marked improvement in board con
trol. and driving full speed, the In
dians looked like money in the bank
from the opening tip.
Cal Stubborn
California was stubborn, however,
! and kept closing up the gaps, but
i Dave Davidson's final burst of four
1 field goals coupled with a Bob Lewis
J felt-handed push from the key, was
too much for the Golden Bear.
The game started with Yardley
dropping in a set-up off an alert pass
by Davidson, and soon Stanford had
jumped into a 17 to 8 lead.
i Cal s O Neill and Payne pushed in
points in a row, but a variety of
Stephenson talent, namely a hook
from the key. a 35-foot push shot,
and a tip. coming in that order.
*ave Stanford a 24 to 22 half-time
lead.
After the rest period, with David
son and Stephenson in the driver's
seat, Stanford started to build again.
Three different times Dean's men
stretched out their lead, only to have
the pesky Bears rally to close the
gap.

Finally, after Cal had tied it. 39

iced it with an over-the-head-back
wards !ay-in. Davidson added the
final touches to his sensational per

as Stanford retired with a 55 to 48

.'!() Points From Foul Line
Stanford scored a total of 30 points
lrom the tree throw line, and com
ment was made that the foreign of
ficials irom Los Angeles were too
quick with the toot, but that wasn't
the case. The Indians would get
men in pood position for a shot, and
the Bears would fcul.
Consequently the Cards were
kept bu>y scoring the singles in
stead of the doubles. li the Bi'ars
hadn't been fouling, Stanford
would have scurcd more from the
floor.
Saturday night's game was Stan
: ford s all the way. Showing a
marked improvement in board con
trol. and driving full speed, the In
dians looked like money in the bank
from the opening tip.
Cal Stubborn
California was stubborn, however,
! and kept closing up the gaps, but
i Dave Davidson's final burst of four
1 field goals coupled with a Bob Lewis
J felt-handed push from the key, was
too much for the Golden Bear.
The game started with Yardley
dropping in a set-up off an alert pass
by Davidson, and soon Stanford had
jumped into a 17 to 8 lead.
i Cal s O Neill and Payne pushed in
points in a row, but a variety of
Stephenson talent, namely a hook
from the key. a 35-foot push shot,
and a tip. coming in that order.
*ave Stanford a 24 to 22 half-time
lead.
After the rest period, with David
son and Stephenson in the driver's
seat, Stanford started to build again.
Three different times Dean's men
stretched out their lead, only to have
the pesky Bears rally to close the
gap.

Finally, after Cal had tied it. 39
to 39, with 9 minutes left, Gus Cha
valas tanked in a charity toss to
touch oft the last bombardment.
Davidson again came through with
clutch buckets, and George Yardley
iced it with an over-the-head-back
wards !ay-in. Davidson added the
final touches to his sensational per
formance by scoring 4 more points,
as Stanford retired with a 55 to 48
I win in its hip-pocket.
The Cards climbed back into the
Southern Division co-leadership
with USC when the Trojans dropped
a 74 to G8 overtime to UCLA on
I Friday night, only to out-scrap the
i Bruins, 59 to 52. Saturday night.
Stanford's next crack at Sam Bar
ry s Trojans will not come up until

Fob. 12, at which time USC will play
host at the Olympic Auditorium in
Los Angeles.
Carver Comes Through
Stanford's return to form, although
largely sparked by Davidson and
Stephenson, was also due to come
through playing by the reserves.
Ralph Carver, backing up Steve at
center, looked absolutely great in
his brief appearances. Carver never
loses a pass, and is one of the best
feeders in the business.
Bill Lewis also was a valuable
man to have around. Playing behind i
Yardley, he dropped in -some nice |
long shots to inject timely energy I
in the Stanford attack.
Milt Iverson, working efficiently,
did not have a good weekend at the
. scoreboard, but that happens to the
best of them. George Yardley, still
favoring his knee a lot, also was ,
slowed up in the adding machine de
partment, but George's work on
Friday night was indispensable.
He should be really ready to go
by the time Stanford invades Los j
| Angeles in two weeks.
On the whole, the weekend was j
the most successful that Stanford '

days of Dallmar, Pollard, and the :
boom boys of 1943.

Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with

; a couple of long shots by Payne to
j make it 65 to 63. At this point Dave
Davidson was awarded a tree throw,
