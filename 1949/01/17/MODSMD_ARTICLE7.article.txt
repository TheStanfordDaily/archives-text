# Indians Win Two Over Bears
## Davidson Brilliant As Reds Take Lead 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's Redshirted Indians, playing their most aggressive
and determined basketball of the season, rolled up two impres
sive wins against California over the weekend to bounce back
into a first-place tie with USC for the Southern Division leadership.
It was the first time since 1943 that Stanford has managed to
dump the Bears twice in succession, and the hard-fighting Cards
could not be denied as they squeezed out a 6B to 65 thriller at
Berkeley Friday night, and then turned in a smashing 55 to 48
verdict in the Pavilion on Friday night.
By two-timing Nibs Price's Bears, Everett Dean's golden boys
scored their third conference win in four starts, and stretched
their total record to 14 victories in 16 tries.

Stanford's two old married
men, Dave Davidson and Bill
Stephenson, were the twin pack
ages of Farm dynamite that
paved the way to victory. Both
played inspired basketball, mas
tering the backboards, and scor
ing points from all angles.
But it was guard Dave David
son alone who actually stole
the show. Time and again he
pulled the Redchirts out of hot
spots with his daring and ag
gressive style of play.
Dave blocked shots, inter
cepted passes, was a demon on
both backboards, and oiled up
his shooting eye to near per
fection as he turned in the best
all-around game seen in a Big
Game series in many years.
Bill Stephenson, showing
flashes of brilliance, went right

along with Davidson in the point scoring, and each churned in
38 digits for the series. Steve was high-point man on Friday
night with 21, and Dave took over the top spot on Saturday with
| 20.
Both are also tied in conference scoring, adding up 59 for four
conference games, and ranking just behind Troy's Bill Sharman
with 68, in the Southern Division point-pushing race,
Friday night's contest, which Stanford pulled out of the fire
by going into a fast-moving stall for the last two minutes, was
d close contest all the way.
Stanford jumped into a quick 7 to 4 lead on Davidson and
Yardley buckets, but had lost it by half-time to trail 31 to 26.
The Golden Bears had pulled out in front mainly because of the
long-distance scoring by Bob Walker and the last second trio
of field goals by O'Neill, Ruebel, and Payne.
Coming out for the second half, Stanford slowly whittled away
at the Berkeley advantage, and after 7 minutes had tied up the
ballgame at 41-all. Two Davidson field goals, one from the left

* corner and one from 40 feet out,
sparked (he rally.
Stanford went un from there to
build up a 65 to 59 advantage with
only three minutes showing on the
clock, but the Bears came back with
