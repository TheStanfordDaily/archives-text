NANKING, Jan. 17 (.4 J ) â€” The
Chinese Nationalists lied by sea
irom the Northern port of Tangku
today amid indications that Peiping
was destined quickly to surrender
or fall to the encircling Commu
nists.
In Central China, the government
deployed troops estimated at 150.000
along a 300-mile Yangtze River
front for the defense of Nanking
and Shanghai.
Foreign military observers said
the effort looked hopeless and that
60.000 of the troops were in what
looked like suicidal positions some
30 miles north of Nanking.
It was learned authoritatively
that Tngku, port for Communist -
conquered Tientsin 27 miles to the
west, was abandoned during the
night.
The Chinese navy used small craft
of all sorts to move the 35,000-man
garrison across Taku Bar and out
to sea where they awaited arrival
of larger transports for the ilight
south.
(The Communists shortly after
ward broadcast that they had taken
Tangku after the Nationalists fled.
(The broadcast concluded: "The
liberation of Peiping and all North
China is at hand.")
Spencer Moosa, AP correspondent
in Peiping, reported that a commit
tee of prominent citizens was going,
out Monday to meet the Communists
and seek peace. He said an escort
and transportation across the narrow
no-man's-land outside the walls
were provided by the government's
commander, Gen. Fu Tso-Yi.
Moosa reported later, however,
that the delegation failed to leave
.Monday as scheduled because of the
bombing of the home of Ho Sze-
Yuan, former Peiping mayor and a
leader of the delegation. Ho and two
other members of his family were in
jured and one of his daughters, Lu
Mei (Shantung Flower) was killed.
Ho expressed belief a time bomb
on the roof of his home exploded,
rather than the house being hit by
Communist artillery fire as at first
reported.
