Response was so great for vol
unteers to work at the Morning
glory Nursery for blind children in
Palo Alto that sign-ups are now
closed, announced Priscilla Clau
dius. chairman of the YWCA proj

Today the first women needed
will be notified. These will read to
the blind children, accompany them
on walks, direct games, and play
the piano for group singing. The
children range in age from two to
five years.
Requests from the Morning-glory
Nursery, under the auspices of the
National Transcribers for the Blind,
were directed to the Stanford YW
CA. Within two days over 30 per
sons were interviewed. Many of
the women have had similar exce
llence, and one student has worked
with spastic children.
