In one respect Tuesday and
Thursdays on the Farm are
reminiscent of the war years,
when the majority of men stu
dents appeared on Quad in
their military and naval uniforms,
for it is on these days that nearly
(iUO members of Stanford's ROTC
and NROTC units don their uniforms
to attend weekly drill periods.
During the war Stanford had a
Navy V-12 units as well as an ASTP
group, and from these two organiza
tions have grown the present NROTC
and ROTC battalions.
Organized in 1919, the ROTC
steadily grew until World War 11,
when it was displaced by the ASTP
(Army Specialized Training Pro- j
gram). But in September 1946 the
ROTC returned to the Farm and
has since then developed to its pres
ent size of more than 400 cadet of
ficers and men.
Looking back on "the good old i
days" when the unit was still in its
infancy. Col. Basil H. Perry, Pro
lessor of Military Science and Tac
tic.-, recalled that the ROTC had
one of the top polo teams on the
West Coast. "That was in the days
when we had horses which were
used by our artillery units," the j
Colonel says. "Then one had to be
a member of the ROTC to play polo."
The present-day artillerymen on the
Farm are forced to get along without
the services of horses, although most
ROTC activity still centers around
the converted .stables.
Basic and Advanced
The ROTC at Stanford is divided
into two groups—basic and advanced. :
For the first two years cadets re
ceive training in such elementary i
subjects as infantry drill regulations,
military sanitation and first aid.
aerial photography and mapreading.
Upon completion of the basic courses,
students become a part of the ad
vanced program. They select one of
three branches for specialization— ;
the Quartermaster Corps, Field Ar- !
tillery, or Air Force. During the
last two years of their training they
receive about 30 dollars per month.
Upon completion of the advanced
course, the cadets are commissioned ;
second lieutenants in the army or
air force reserve.
The present battalion is headed
by a group of 32 officers who are
appointed at the beginning of each
quarter on the basis of excellence in
practical and theoretical work. They
supervise the instruction of basic
cedets on the drill field.
The battalion is composed of five
infantry companies, each com
manded by a cadet captain. The top
ranking cadet non-commissioned of
ficer in each company is the first
sergeant.
Summer Camp
One of the outstanding phases of
the course is the summer camp, at
tended by all cadets the summer be
fore their final year of advanced
work. Air Force cadets are sent to
March Field, California, and the
Ground Forces cadets to Fort Lewis,
Washington. There the prospective
officers receive six weeks' training
in the use of the latest military |
equipment. During this period the
cadets receive $75 per month. Last
summer the Scabbard and Blade
Societies ol 17 universities combined
to throw what was described as a \
"gigantic and successful party."
Scabbard and Blade at Stanford is
an honorary society composed of ad
vanced ROTC and NROTC cadets.
'1 he objectives of the society are to i
organize social activities and to raise
the professional training level of the j
units.
Rille Team
'I he ROTC rille team fires in com
petition with colleges throughout the
country. This year's team, whose
membership is expeetcd'to reach 30. i
has "postal" matches scheduled with
ROTC units at Princeton, Penn State,
and other schools. It will also com- j
pete in the Hearst Trophy match.
Stanford's rifle range, supervised by j
the ROTC, has recently been ex
panded to 10 targets.
Now in the process of organization
is a crack drill team, the Indian Ri
fles. The group will be patterned
after the Pershing Rifles, organized
by the late Gen. John J. Pershing
while he was PMS&T at Nebraska |

University. Uncjer the command of
cadet officers, the Indian Rifles will
perform intricate drill maneuvers
and complex manuals of arms.
The ROTC hand, organized this
year for the first time since 1919, is
composed of 42 musicians. It pro
vides the music at all ROTC parades
and reviews.
Training Staff
The course is under the direction
of three Army, officers, three air
corps officers, and nine enlisted men.
Some of the most modern equipment,
including a P-51. a 105-mm. howit
zer, a 90-mm. anti-aircraft gun. and
a new field artillery terrain board.

is used for training purposes.
The NROTC might be called Stan
ford's largest scholarship program.
One hundred sixteen of the 162
members of the unit are receiving
four years' education, the greater
part of the expense of which is cov
ered by Uncle Sam. Tuition, books,
lees, and uniforms—all are paid for
by the navy for the "regular" mem
bers of the unit. In addition, each
cadet receives a "ration" of $50 per
month. In return for these advan
tages he is obliged to maintain a
satisfactory standing and to take
Naval Science. After he is commis
sioned ensign in the Naval Reserve

he must serve two years on active
duty and four years in the reserve.
"Contract" Students
The "contract" students pay their
own way through college, and do
not receive a ration from the navy
until their last two years, when they
are paid about $30 per month. They
are required to take about the same
Naval Science courses as the regu
lars, but do not go on active duty
after they are commissioned, instead
being placed immediately in the
Naval Reserve.
The summer cruise is an event
long remembered by NROTC stu
dents. The regulars go to sea for
eight weeks during every summer
for their training course, while the
j contract students take to the bound
ing main for a shorter voyage be
tween their third and fourth years.
Last summer the Stanford unit
' visited Pearl Harbor, Victoria, and
West Coast ports aboard the battle
ship lowa. At Pearl Harbor they
I were welcomed into port by hula
giils clad in grass skirts.
NROTC Commander
The NROTC battalion is com
manded by a cadet lieutenant com
mander, and each of its five com
panies by a cadet lieutenant. Al
though the future officers receive
some training in close order drill,
more emphasis is placed on the theo
retical subjects such as communica
tion,. navigation, tactics, naval his
tory, and customs of the service.
Captain Ransom K. Davis. Proles

sor of Naval Science, emphasizes the
importance of reserve units such as
the NROTC in the rational pre
paredness program. "Our country
can be only as prepared as its peo
ple are willing to make it," lie said.
"One of the most important pi. Os
of preparedness is the maintenance
of a strong reserve corps, and tin
training which these men receive
should make our future naval re
serve the strongest in history."

The present battalion is headed
by a group of 32 officers who are
appointed at the beginning of each
quarter on the basis of excellence in
practical and theoretical work. They
supervise the instruction of basic
cedets on the drill field.
The battalion is composed of five
infantry companies, each com
manded by a cadet captain. The top
ranking cadet non-commissioned of
ficer in each company is the first
sergeant.
Summer Camp
One of the outstanding phases of
the course is the summer camp, at
tended by all cadets the summer be
fore their final year of advanced
work. Air Force cadets are sent to
March Field, California, and the
Ground Forces cadets to Fort Lewis,
Washington. There the prospective
officers receive six weeks' training
in the use of the latest military |
equipment. During this period the
cadets receive $75 per month. Last
summer the Scabbard and Blade
Societies ol 17 universities combined
to throw what was described as a \
"gigantic and successful party."
Scabbard and Blade at Stanford is
an honorary society composed of ad
vanced ROTC and NROTC cadets.
'1 he objectives of the society are to i
organize social activities and to raise
the professional training level of the j
units.
Rille Team
'I he ROTC rille team fires in com
petition with colleges throughout the
country. This year's team, whose
membership is expeetcd'to reach 30. i
has "postal" matches scheduled with
ROTC units at Princeton, Penn State,
and other schools. It will also com- j
pete in the Hearst Trophy match.
Stanford's rifle range, supervised by j
the ROTC, has recently been ex
panded to 10 targets.
Now in the process of organization
is a crack drill team, the Indian Ri
fles. The group will be patterned
after the Pershing Rifles, organized
by the late Gen. John J. Pershing
while he was PMS&T at Nebraska |

University. Uncjer the command of
cadet officers, the Indian Rifles will
perform intricate drill maneuvers
and complex manuals of arms.
The ROTC hand, organized this
year for the first time since 1919, is
composed of 42 musicians. It pro
vides the music at all ROTC parades
and reviews.
Training Staff
The course is under the direction
of three Army, officers, three air
corps officers, and nine enlisted men.
Some of the most modern equipment,
including a P-51. a 105-mm. howit
zer, a 90-mm. anti-aircraft gun. and
a new field artillery terrain board.

is used for training purposes.
The NROTC might be called Stan
ford's largest scholarship program.
One hundred sixteen of the 162
members of the unit are receiving
four years' education, the greater
part of the expense of which is cov
ered by Uncle Sam. Tuition, books,
lees, and uniforms—all are paid for
by the navy for the "regular" mem
bers of the unit. In addition, each
cadet receives a "ration" of $50 per
month. In return for these advan
tages he is obliged to maintain a
satisfactory standing and to take
Naval Science. After he is commis
sioned ensign in the Naval Reserve

he must serve two years on active
duty and four years in the reserve.
"Contract" Students
The "contract" students pay their
own way through college, and do
not receive a ration from the navy
until their last two years, when they
are paid about $30 per month. They
are required to take about the same
Naval Science courses as the regu
lars, but do not go on active duty
after they are commissioned, instead
being placed immediately in the
Naval Reserve.
The summer cruise is an event
long remembered by NROTC stu
dents. The regulars go to sea for
eight weeks during every summer
for their training course, while the
j contract students take to the bound
ing main for a shorter voyage be
tween their third and fourth years.
Last summer the Stanford unit
' visited Pearl Harbor, Victoria, and
West Coast ports aboard the battle
ship lowa. At Pearl Harbor they
I were welcomed into port by hula
giils clad in grass skirts.
NROTC Commander
The NROTC battalion is com
manded by a cadet lieutenant com
mander, and each of its five com
panies by a cadet lieutenant. Al
though the future officers receive
some training in close order drill,
more emphasis is placed on the theo
retical subjects such as communica
tion,. navigation, tactics, naval his
tory, and customs of the service.
Captain Ransom K. Davis. Proles

sor of Naval Science, emphasizes the
importance of reserve units such as
the NROTC in the rational pre
paredness program. "Our country
can be only as prepared as its peo
ple are willing to make it," lie said.
"One of the most important pi. Os
of preparedness is the maintenance
of a strong reserve corps, and tin
training which these men receive
should make our future naval re
serve the strongest in history."


MEMBERS OF THE STANFORD NROTC unit arc pictured at a recent
Thursday morning drill. The unit has Hi 2 men enrolled in regular and
"contract" programs.
In one respect Tuesday and
Thursdays on the Farm are
reminiscent of the war years,
when the majority of men stu
dents appeared on Quad in
their military and naval uniforms,
for it is on these days that nearly
(iUO members of Stanford's ROTC
and NROTC units don their uniforms
to attend weekly drill periods.
During the war Stanford had a
Navy V-12 units as well as an ASTP
group, and from these two organiza
tions have grown the present NROTC
and ROTC battalions.
Organized in 1919, the ROTC
steadily grew until World War 11,
when it was displaced by the ASTP
(Army Specialized Training Pro- j
gram). But in September 1946 the
ROTC returned to the Farm and
has since then developed to its pres
ent size of more than 400 cadet of
ficers and men.
Looking back on "the good old i
days" when the unit was still in its
infancy. Col. Basil H. Perry, Pro
lessor of Military Science and Tac
tic.-, recalled that the ROTC had
one of the top polo teams on the
West Coast. "That was in the days
when we had horses which were
used by our artillery units," the j
Colonel says. "Then one had to be
a member of the ROTC to play polo."
The present-day artillerymen on the
Farm are forced to get along without
the services of horses, although most
ROTC activity still centers around
the converted .stables.

The ROTC at Stanford is divided
into two groups—basic and advanced. :

ceive training in such elementary i
subjects as infantry drill regulations,

Upon completion of the basic courses,
students become a part of the ad
vanced program. They select one of
three branches for specialization— ;
the Quartermaster Corps, Field Ar- !
tillery, or Air Force. During the
last two years of their training they
receive about 30 dollars per month.
Upon completion of the advanced
course, the cadets are commissioned ;

The course is under the direction
of three Army, officers, three air

is used for training purposes.
The NROTC might be called Stan
ford's largest scholarship program.
One hundred sixteen of the 162
members of the unit are receiving
four years' education, the greater
part of the expense of which is cov
ered by Uncle Sam. Tuition, books,
lees, and uniforms—all are paid for
by the navy for the "regular" mem
bers of the unit. In addition, each
cadet receives a "ration" of $50 per
month. In return for these advan
tages he is obliged to maintain a
satisfactory standing and to take
Naval Science. After he is commis
sioned ensign in the Naval Reserve

he must serve two years on active
duty and four years in the reserve.
"Contract" Students
The "contract" students pay their
own way through college, and do
not receive a ration from the navy
until their last two years, when they
are paid about $30 per month. They
are required to take about the same
Naval Science courses as the regu
lars, but do not go on active duty
after they are commissioned, instead
being placed immediately in the
Naval Reserve.
The summer cruise is an event
long remembered by NROTC stu
dents. The regulars go to sea for
eight weeks during every summer
for their training course, while the
j contract students take to the bound
ing main for a shorter voyage be
tween their third and fourth years.
Last summer the Stanford unit
' visited Pearl Harbor, Victoria, and
West Coast ports aboard the battle
ship lowa. At Pearl Harbor they
I were welcomed into port by hula
giils clad in grass skirts.
NROTC Commander
The NROTC battalion is com
manded by a cadet lieutenant com
mander, and each of its five com
panies by a cadet lieutenant. Al
though the future officers receive
some training in close order drill,
more emphasis is placed on the theo
retical subjects such as communica
tion,. navigation, tactics, naval his
tory, and customs of the service.
Captain Ransom K. Davis. Proles

sor of Naval Science, emphasizes the
importance of reserve units such as
the NROTC in the rational pre
paredness program. "Our country
can be only as prepared as its peo
ple are willing to make it," lie said.
"One of the most important pi. Os
of preparedness is the maintenance
of a strong reserve corps, and tin
training which these men receive
should make our future naval re
serve the strongest in history."


MEMBERS OF THE STANFORD NROTC unit arc pictured at a recent
Thursday morning drill. The unit has Hi 2 men enrolled in regular and
"contract" programs.
In one respect Tuesday and
Thursdays on the Farm are
reminiscent of the war years,
when the majority of men stu
dents appeared on Quad in
their military and naval uniforms,
for it is on these days that nearly
(iUO members of Stanford's ROTC
and NROTC units don their uniforms
to attend weekly drill periods.
During the war Stanford had a
Navy V-12 units as well as an ASTP
group, and from these two organiza
tions have grown the present NROTC
and ROTC battalions.
Organized in 1919, the ROTC
steadily grew until World War 11,
when it was displaced by the ASTP
(Army Specialized Training Pro- j
gram). But in September 1946 the
ROTC returned to the Farm and
has since then developed to its pres
ent size of more than 400 cadet of
ficers and men.
Looking back on "the good old i
days" when the unit was still in its
infancy. Col. Basil H. Perry, Pro
lessor of Military Science and Tac
tic.-, recalled that the ROTC had
one of the top polo teams on the
West Coast. "That was in the days
when we had horses which were
used by our artillery units," the j
Colonel says. "Then one had to be
a member of the ROTC to play polo."
The present-day artillerymen on the
Farm are forced to get along without
the services of horses, although most
ROTC activity still centers around
the converted .stables.
Basic and Advanced
The ROTC at Stanford is divided
into two groups—basic and advanced. :
For the first two years cadets re
ceive training in such elementary i
subjects as infantry drill regulations,
military sanitation and first aid.
aerial photography and mapreading.
Upon completion of the basic courses,
students become a part of the ad
vanced program. They select one of
three branches for specialization— ;
the Quartermaster Corps, Field Ar- !
tillery, or Air Force. During the
last two years of their training they
receive about 30 dollars per month.
Upon completion of the advanced
course, the cadets are commissioned ;
second lieutenants in the army or
air force reserve.
The present battalion is headed
by a group of 32 officers who are
appointed at the beginning of each
quarter on the basis of excellence in
practical and theoretical work. They
supervise the instruction of basic
cedets on the drill field.
The battalion is composed of five
infantry companies, each com
manded by a cadet captain. The top
ranking cadet non-commissioned of
ficer in each company is the first
sergeant.
Summer Camp
One of the outstanding phases of
the course is the summer camp, at
tended by all cadets the summer be
fore their final year of advanced
work. Air Force cadets are sent to
March Field, California, and the
Ground Forces cadets to Fort Lewis,
Washington. There the prospective
officers receive six weeks' training
in the use of the latest military |
equipment. During this period the
cadets receive $75 per month. Last
summer the Scabbard and Blade
Societies ol 17 universities combined
to throw what was described as a \
"gigantic and successful party."
Scabbard and Blade at Stanford is
an honorary society composed of ad
vanced ROTC and NROTC cadets.
'1 he objectives of the society are to i
organize social activities and to raise
the professional training level of the j
units.

Stanford's rifle range, supervised by j
the ROTC, has recently been ex

is a crack drill team, the Indian Ri

importance of reserve units such as
the NROTC in the rational pre

MEMBERS OF THE STANFORD NROTC unit arc pictured at a recent
Thursday morning drill. The unit has Hi 2 men enrolled in regular and
"contract" programs.
In one respect Tuesday and
Thursdays on the Farm are
reminiscent of the war years,
when the majority of men stu
dents appeared on Quad in
their military and naval uniforms,
for it is on these days that nearly
(iUO members of Stanford's ROTC
and NROTC units don their uniforms
to attend weekly drill periods.
During the war Stanford had a
Navy V-12 units as well as an ASTP
group, and from these two organiza
tions have grown the present NROTC
and ROTC battalions.
Organized in 1919, the ROTC
steadily grew until World War 11,
when it was displaced by the ASTP
(Army Specialized Training Pro- j
gram). But in September 1946 the
ROTC returned to the Farm and
has since then developed to its pres
ent size of more than 400 cadet of
ficers and men.
Looking back on "the good old i
days" when the unit was still in its
infancy. Col. Basil H. Perry, Pro
lessor of Military Science and Tac
tic.-, recalled that the ROTC had
one of the top polo teams on the
West Coast. "That was in the days
when we had horses which were
used by our artillery units," the j
Colonel says. "Then one had to be
a member of the ROTC to play polo."
The present-day artillerymen on the
Farm are forced to get along without
the services of horses, although most
ROTC activity still centers around
the converted .stables.
Basic and Advanced
The ROTC at Stanford is divided
into two groups—basic and advanced. :
For the first two years cadets re
ceive training in such elementary i
subjects as infantry drill regulations,
military sanitation and first aid.
aerial photography and mapreading.
Upon completion of the basic courses,
students become a part of the ad
vanced program. They select one of
three branches for specialization— ;
the Quartermaster Corps, Field Ar- !
tillery, or Air Force. During the
last two years of their training they
receive about 30 dollars per month.
Upon completion of the advanced
course, the cadets are commissioned ;
second lieutenants in the army or
air force reserve.
The present battalion is headed
by a group of 32 officers who are
appointed at the beginning of each
quarter on the basis of excellence in
practical and theoretical work. They
supervise the instruction of basic
cedets on the drill field.
The battalion is composed of five
infantry companies, each com
manded by a cadet captain. The top
ranking cadet non-commissioned of
ficer in each company is the first
sergeant.
Summer Camp
One of the outstanding phases of
the course is the summer camp, at
tended by all cadets the summer be
fore their final year of advanced
work. Air Force cadets are sent to
March Field, California, and the
Ground Forces cadets to Fort Lewis,
Washington. There the prospective
officers receive six weeks' training
in the use of the latest military |
equipment. During this period the
cadets receive $75 per month. Last
summer the Scabbard and Blade
Societies ol 17 universities combined
to throw what was described as a \
"gigantic and successful party."
Scabbard and Blade at Stanford is
an honorary society composed of ad
vanced ROTC and NROTC cadets.
'1 he objectives of the society are to i
organize social activities and to raise
the professional training level of the j
units.
Rille Team
'I he ROTC rille team fires in com
petition with colleges throughout the
country. This year's team, whose
membership is expeetcd'to reach 30. i
has "postal" matches scheduled with
ROTC units at Princeton, Penn State,
and other schools. It will also com- j
pete in the Hearst Trophy match.
Stanford's rifle range, supervised by j
the ROTC, has recently been ex
panded to 10 targets.
Now in the process of organization
is a crack drill team, the Indian Ri
fles. The group will be patterned
after the Pershing Rifles, organized
by the late Gen. John J. Pershing
while he was PMS&T at Nebraska |

University. Uncjer the command of
cadet officers, the Indian Rifles will
perform intricate drill maneuvers
and complex manuals of arms.
The ROTC hand, organized this
year for the first time since 1919, is
composed of 42 musicians. It pro
vides the music at all ROTC parades
and reviews.
Training Staff
The course is under the direction
of three Army, officers, three air
corps officers, and nine enlisted men.
Some of the most modern equipment,
including a P-51. a 105-mm. howit
zer, a 90-mm. anti-aircraft gun. and
a new field artillery terrain board.

is used for training purposes.
The NROTC might be called Stan
ford's largest scholarship program.
One hundred sixteen of the 162
members of the unit are receiving
four years' education, the greater
part of the expense of which is cov
ered by Uncle Sam. Tuition, books,
lees, and uniforms—all are paid for
by the navy for the "regular" mem
bers of the unit. In addition, each
cadet receives a "ration" of $50 per
month. In return for these advan
tages he is obliged to maintain a
satisfactory standing and to take
Naval Science. After he is commis
sioned ensign in the Naval Reserve

he must serve two years on active
duty and four years in the reserve.
"Contract" Students
The "contract" students pay their
own way through college, and do
not receive a ration from the navy
until their last two years, when they
are paid about $30 per month. They
are required to take about the same
Naval Science courses as the regu
lars, but do not go on active duty
after they are commissioned, instead
being placed immediately in the
Naval Reserve.
The summer cruise is an event
long remembered by NROTC stu
dents. The regulars go to sea for
eight weeks during every summer
for their training course, while the
j contract students take to the bound
ing main for a shorter voyage be
tween their third and fourth years.
Last summer the Stanford unit
' visited Pearl Harbor, Victoria, and
West Coast ports aboard the battle
ship lowa. At Pearl Harbor they
I were welcomed into port by hula
giils clad in grass skirts.
NROTC Commander
The NROTC battalion is com
manded by a cadet lieutenant com
mander, and each of its five com
panies by a cadet lieutenant. Al
though the future officers receive
some training in close order drill,
more emphasis is placed on the theo
