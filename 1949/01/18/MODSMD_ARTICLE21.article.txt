## Committee Plans Hearings On Student Constitution 
### 
A complete face-lifting of student government has been out
lined within the tentative framework of a new Associated Stu
dents Contitution. Through the efforts of four students, Mark
Hatfield, Marianna Olmstead, Jack Burdick, and Jiggs McCaulley,
the Stanford student body may be able to operate as an efficient
organization.
Open hearings have been scheduled for the near future con
cerning many controversial problems in the constitution affect
ing all student organizations, Hatfield said. He urges each stu
dent to engage in these discussions and to contribute written
suggestions to any one of the committee members.
"In the past." explained Hatfield, "the constitution has been
involved and verbose. It has become a perennial headache be
cause very few individuals are able to understand it without
study."
The committee has been carefully reviewing, considering,
and investigating the present constitution since the middle of
autumn quarter. They soon realized that the inconsistent parts
of the present document could only be remedied by drawing up
an entirely new constitution in which the basic parts were com
pletely reviewed.
"We hope that this constitution is one that will last. It will
be short, concise, and to-the-point. It will be a statement of policy,
not a detailed, binding body of rulings," Hatfield said.
The committee now needs concrete suggestions to aid in solv
ing the problems created by the present constitution. "We want
to know what factors the students dislike in the present system
so that we may eliminate them."
Excom representation has been considered as a vital problem.
The committee has found that one possible solution might be a
combination of area and class representation on the Executive
Committee. Areas similar to those in existence would be desig
nated, each having one representative. Other Excom members
would be elected upon a numerical ratio basis from each class.
Suggestions have reached the committee concerning the ques
tion of the procedure in appealing cases appearing before the
student judicial councils. Whether or not the present system is
adequate will be reviewed by the committee. At the present time,
the Dean of Students has the power to review cases appealed.
"The committee was charged by Excom with the responsibility
of drawing an ASSU constitution. It is our desire to produce a
document which will be approved by the majority of students,
both in organizations and as individuals," Hatfield said.
