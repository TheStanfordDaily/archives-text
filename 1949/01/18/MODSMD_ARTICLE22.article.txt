To the Editor:
To write, or not to write: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in
the mind to read and criticize for every passing friend the latest editorial,
or to grab a typewriter and put down just what you'd like to question?
The Monday editorial introduced itself by summarizing campus opinion
as ranging from "praise to 'Do the editors know what they're talking
about?'," and we're afraid we find ourselves in the latter group.
A few statements we'd like to challenge:
1. . women are helpless." What body on campus makes the regula
tions? What body enforces them? Who has the right to appeal?
2. '"Regulations and interpretations . . . have been amended constantly."
To some, amendments indicate progress, indicate a body of regulations
which are elastic and capable of change within itself. Recent amendments
or suggested ones to illustrate our point would be the more liberal late
leaves of last year, the elimination of nuisance factors passed last week,
and the proposed Demerit plan.
3. ". . . rather than developing a spirit of obeying the necessary regu
lations, the persons ... in charge have somehow given birth to a policy
of. . . .unnecessarily upsetting the women." By explaining, interpreting,
testing new women on social regulations in order to be sure that they
understand the regulations they arc asked to abide by as Stanford women,
perhaps? Or by giving them the power to vote on regulations, to select the
women on campus who will issue penalties, and rendering them the power
to appeal? . ,
4. "Orientation reached a new height when it covered a full week." This
year the freshmen came to Stanford on the Thursday before Registration
Monday JPor their pre-reg program, a traditional orientation plan on the
Farm. A look at what this program included might be even more illumi
nating . . . tour of the campus, jolly-up, introduction to the president
and Freshman Barbecue.
5. "Women's Council's 'third-degree' methods . . . seem to serve no
useful purpose." The conception of such seems to be giving some wild
imagination no end of satisfaction.
6. "Over at Encina, freshmen aren't fettered by too many regulations or
too much 'orientation' (we gather that the quotations around this self
explanatory word give it all sorts of significant implications.)" A look at
the mores of our society might answer for the editorial board the question
of why Encina men are "unfettered."
7. "Neither do they (the men at Encina) worry about spy systems or a
vindictive council " Spy systems and vindictive councils made up of indi
viduals falling under the same code of regulations as the victims of such
alleged groups is an interesting conception.
We can't help but think that The Daily editorial was a sincere effort to
arouse interest among the Stanford women over their social regulations
and governing bodies. Unfortunately, Daily editors would find that there
are far too many women on campus who fail to take interest in such sub
jects, even in the pernicious situation described by Monday's Daily. Those
who are interested, to be sure, disagree, but at least their discussions are
free of misconceptions, seven of which, the Daily's Monday editorial has
brought forth in all their glory.

To the Editor:
To write, or not to write: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in
the mind to read and criticize for every passing friend the latest editorial,
or to grab a typewriter and put down just what you'd like to question?
The Monday editorial introduced itself by summarizing campus opinion
as ranging from "praise to 'Do the editors know what they're talking
about?'," and we're afraid we find ourselves in the latter group.
A few statements we'd like to challenge:
1. . women are helpless." What body on campus makes the regula
tions? What body enforces them? Who has the right to appeal?
2. '"Regulations and interpretations . . . have been amended constantly."
To some, amendments indicate progress, indicate a body of regulations
which are elastic and capable of change within itself. Recent amendments
or suggested ones to illustrate our point would be the more liberal late
leaves of last year, the elimination of nuisance factors passed last week,
and the proposed Demerit plan.
3. ". . . rather than developing a spirit of obeying the necessary regu
lations, the persons ... in charge have somehow given birth to a policy
of. . . .unnecessarily upsetting the women." By explaining, interpreting,
testing new women on social regulations in order to be sure that they
understand the regulations they arc asked to abide by as Stanford women,
perhaps? Or by giving them the power to vote on regulations, to select the
women on campus who will issue penalties, and rendering them the power
to appeal? . ,
4. "Orientation reached a new height when it covered a full week." This
year the freshmen came to Stanford on the Thursday before Registration
Monday JPor their pre-reg program, a traditional orientation plan on the
Farm. A look at what this program included might be even more illumi
nating . . . tour of the campus, jolly-up, introduction to the president
and Freshman Barbecue.
5. "Women's Council's 'third-degree' methods . . . seem to serve no
useful purpose." The conception of such seems to be giving some wild
imagination no end of satisfaction.
6. "Over at Encina, freshmen aren't fettered by too many regulations or
too much 'orientation' (we gather that the quotations around this self
explanatory word give it all sorts of significant implications.)" A look at
the mores of our society might answer for the editorial board the question
of why Encina men are "unfettered."
7. "Neither do they (the men at Encina) worry about spy systems or a
vindictive council " Spy systems and vindictive councils made up of indi
viduals falling under the same code of regulations as the victims of such
alleged groups is an interesting conception.
We can't help but think that The Daily editorial was a sincere effort to
arouse interest among the Stanford women over their social regulations
and governing bodies. Unfortunately, Daily editors would find that there
are far too many women on campus who fail to take interest in such sub
jects, even in the pernicious situation described by Monday's Daily. Those
who are interested, to be sure, disagree, but at least their discussions are
free of misconceptions, seven of which, the Daily's Monday editorial has
brought forth in all their glory.
