# Writer Doffs Specs for Gal; Beauty Lost

### BOB RIGNEY 
Quickly I whipped off my glasses
as the pretty blonde in the third
row turned around and looked at
me. At least I hope she was look
ing at me, for I can't tel! for sure
without my glasses. As she turned,
I quickly put them back on again
in order to feast my eyes on her
lovely golden tresses. It's a hard
job for a goggled guy to look at
beauty and look beautiful at the
same time.
As I was worshiping her from the
back of the room and mentally
throwing myself prostrate at her
feet, I suddenly saw her make a
few surreptitious movements and
suddenly she was sporting some
spectacles of her own. Wonder why
she doesn't wear them all the time,
I thought. I bet she looks cute in
them. I wonder why women are
all so vain. Then a melancholy
thought struck me. When she
turned around before without her
glasses she probably couldn't see
me anyway and I missed my op
portunity of seeing her face.
Suddenly she snatched off her
glasses and I knew she was going
to move again. Quickly I followed
suit and her beautiful shining hair
dissolved once more into a bright
golden myopic mist. How I strained
to see her face! The shadowy
smudges that must be her eyes and
the blur that was her mouth swam
mistily before my aching eyes.
Once more she settled herself in
her seat but as she did not put on
her glasses, I dared not don mine.
If I only knew the strength of her
eyes, 20 40 or 20/60, I might cal
culate what she could see and know
whether I could safely put mine on
and still not have them noticed by
her. Now I'll, never be able'to rec
ognize her on Quad and if I did
she would probably think a strange
man was accosting her.
As we left the class I tried to get
near enough to see her features, but
a crowd of students separated us. I
only got a glimpse of her firmly
tucking her glasses into the bottom
of her bag. Women are all alike.
They are all so vanity ridden.
