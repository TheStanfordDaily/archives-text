# Drunk Meter Tests Breaths

### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 17 (/P).â€”Six bot
tles of beer or six ounces of bonded
whisky make the average American
drunk.
That's the verdict of the drunk
o-meters or similar devices which
chemically test the breath of mo
torists suspected of being intoxi
cated.
At least 125 cities and some 22
state law enforcement agencies now
use such devices to obtain evidence
against drunken drivers, the Amer
ican Municipal Association reported
today.
The device is accepted as compe
tent court evidence in 28 states.
If a suspect has as much as 0.15
per cent alcohol in his blood, he's
wasting his time telling the judge
he had only two beers. That alco
hol level in the blood requires six
ounces of 100-proof whisky or six
12-ounee bottles of beer.
A suspect confronted with a
drunk-o-metcr simply blows a bal
loon full of air. If he refuses, the
machine can scoop up his breath
when he exhales. The reaction of
chemicals in the machine show the
alcohol level in the blood.
