AN ACT OF LOVE by Ira Wolfcit
(Simon and Schustcr)
. . He had had a feeling of
coming home at last. But actually
his feeling was of having returned
at last to where it would be easy
lo die. That was what "home"
meant to him now — a world he
could hate and relish murdering. In
killing himself, he would murder
the world. But. although the death
in him had made its resolution in
stantly, the life in him refused in
stantly to concur."
This is the general (heme of "An
Act of Love." Although technically
a war story, the book is a very un
usual study. It is actually a minute
psychological study of Lieut. Harry
Brunner. Brunnor is a coward.
Realizing this, he hates himself. At
the same time, he pities himself.
Feeling that he is a victim of race
prejudice, besides taking the whole
war as a personal offense, he de
liberately forces himself to impress
upon others that he is not a coward.

Because of this
feeling, Brunner
is seldom able to
ma k e a deci
sion. He ponders
what to do. and
then ends by
running away if
he can. When
his ship is blown
up. he insists
upon jeopardiz-

ing the lives of 20 survivors to pro
tect one seaman who is almost cer
tain to die. When he is subsequent
ly rescued by a group of natives, he
runs away from them for fear of
becoming involved with their tra
ditions and taboos.
He stays with the family of an
American planter until the Ameri
can forces attempt to recapture the
island. He joins the American
forces, but only to escape from the
situation at the home of the planter.
Finally, when attached to an
army division, he joins in the bat
tle. He had not wished to come, nor
did he have to, but he was more

afraid of staying away. He still felt
compelled to risk his life.
It was during the battle that, for
the first time in his life, Brunner
forgot to think of himself. He. quiu
unselfishly, saved the life of another
man. When he finally began to
think about what he had done, he
realized that he had at last freed
himself of his self-centered cowar
dice.
"He had gone beyond the fears of
animal life and its closed circle of
movement for survival, survival for
movement, and had taken his place
beside the man who had chosen to
die so that another might live. And
when he had done so, the knowl
edge of love had come to him. His
fears had ended and he had the
wisdom the human mind enjoys
when it is not bedeviled by fear.''
At last, the childish neurotic had
grown up. That is about the es
sence of the story. He had learned
the futility of maintaining a hostile
attitude toward the world. He fi
nally realized that he was part of
the human race. After this rather
sudden awakening, Harry Brunner
became a reasonable normal human
being.
The book is extremely interest
ing. It is well written and the plot
is intelligently developed. It is more
or less on the stream of conscious
ness pattern in that every event,
every character, is treated in terms
of the effect upon Brunner.
Because everything is seen
through the eyes of Brunner him
self, including his own estimate of
himself, the reader receives a clear
impression of the personality of the
neurotic Brunner.
This perfect portrayal is rare in
narrative novels. For this reason
alone. Wolfert could be praised as
an extremely adept novelist. To bo
able to write a different and fasci
nating war story, long after the
reading public has been thoroughly
sated with such literature, is suffi
cient testimony to the fact that
Wolfert has written an extraordi
nary novel.—Priseilla Claudius

is seldom able to
ma k e a deci

what to do. and

running away if
he can. When
his ship is blown
up. he insists
upon jeopardiz-

ing the lives of 20 survivors to pro
tect one seaman who is almost cer
tain to die. When he is subsequent
ly rescued by a group of natives, he
runs away from them for fear of
becoming involved with their tra
ditions and taboos.
He stays with the family of an
American planter until the Ameri
can forces attempt to recapture the
island. He joins the American
forces, but only to escape from the
situation at the home of the planter.
Finally, when attached to an
army division, he joins in the bat
tle. He had not wished to come, nor
did he have to, but he was more

afraid of staying away. He still felt
compelled to risk his life.
It was during the battle that, for
the first time in his life, Brunner
forgot to think of himself. He. quiu
unselfishly, saved the life of another
man. When he finally began to
think about what he had done, he
realized that he had at last freed
himself of his self-centered cowar
dice.
"He had gone beyond the fears of
animal life and its closed circle of
movement for survival, survival for
movement, and had taken his place
beside the man who had chosen to
die so that another might live. And
when he had done so, the knowl
edge of love had come to him. His
fears had ended and he had the
wisdom the human mind enjoys
when it is not bedeviled by fear.''
At last, the childish neurotic had
grown up. That is about the es
sence of the story. He had learned
the futility of maintaining a hostile
attitude toward the world. He fi
nally realized that he was part of
the human race. After this rather
sudden awakening, Harry Brunner
became a reasonable normal human
being.
The book is extremely interest
ing. It is well written and the plot
is intelligently developed. It is more
or less on the stream of conscious
ness pattern in that every event,
every character, is treated in terms
of the effect upon Brunner.
Because everything is seen
through the eyes of Brunner him
self, including his own estimate of
himself, the reader receives a clear
impression of the personality of the
neurotic Brunner.
This perfect portrayal is rare in
narrative novels. For this reason
alone. Wolfert could be praised as
an extremely adept novelist. To bo
able to write a different and fasci
nating war story, long after the
reading public has been thoroughly
sated with such literature, is suffi
cient testimony to the fact that
Wolfert has written an extraordi
nary novel.—Priseilla Claudius
