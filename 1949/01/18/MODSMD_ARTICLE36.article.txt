tion as to whether we would have
a Dean of Men or continue the posi
tion of Student Advisors, which had
a somewhat lower status.
Wanted Stanford Man
"When we made the decision to
have a dean we also decided that
we wanted a Stanford man who
knew the traditions of the Univer

ver in the class of '97 and Wilbur,
'9(5. and became close friends in col
lege.
