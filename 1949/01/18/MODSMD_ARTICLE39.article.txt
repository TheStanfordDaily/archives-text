# Wintertime Is Worktime For Indian Grid Coaches
## 
### AL BERRY 
When the last program and
crushed water cup has been cleared
out ol' the stadium, and all the root
ers' caps put back into moth balls;
when the familiar names ol' the
gridsters are heard only in class
rol! calls, and the spotlight ol glory
turns on to the B-Ball boys, it is
then that the football coach puts
away his nightmares and settles
down to three months of plian
hard work.
Contrary to popular opinion,
football coaches do not hibernate
during the winter months. For In-

tlian hea l man Marchie Schwartz
cl ere is a t!iin« called "football pub
lic religions,'" which includes nearly
everything in the book, from alum
ni luncheons to Golden Eoys' yards
gained average.
Assisting Marchie in the cold war
to got better Stanford ball clubs are
(he familiar names of Bengtson,
Hammett, Elwood, and Taylor. As
end coach Mai Elwood put it, "We
show game pictures to the Rotary
Club, the Kiwanis, the Elks, the

r.uck of the Month, and then around
the loop to the Rotary again."
If one could get used to fried
chicken a la banquet, this public
relations business would not seem
ike a bad job. But for Marchie
Schwartz anil staff, fireside chats
and speaking tours are only a small
part ol the job. The staff has to get
together and dissect the season's
game pictures, study the enemies'
defense and offense, and map it out
on cards. They study Stanford's
own defense and offense.
If the plays worked last season
the staff must determine if they will
work with next season's personnel.
And if the plays didn't work. Mar
chie's crew must find out why. In
short, the l rid iron generals spend
the winter mapping the battle tac
tics for '• e coming spring war
games ar i the autumn wars.
And a Class, Too
In addition to formulating next
year's attack and building squad
morale, Coach Schwartz and staff
have other coaching tasks. Marchie,
assisted by backfield coach Ray
Hammett, teaches a class, "Football
Methods." Ray also spends a sizable
hunk of time as an assistant to Har
ry Wolters, the baseball coach.
Phil Bengtson, the Big Red's gen
ial line mentor, is currently tutor
ing the junior varsity basketba!lei's.
And Mai El wood teaches a course
called PE 112. — Fundamentals of
Track, a course designed to teach
the more inexperienced trackmen
the secrets of how to win a race.
A large portion of the winter's
work fal's on the very capable
•houlders of freshman coach Chuck
Taylor. Taylor, an All - American
guard here in 1942, might well be
termed the "procurement officer"
on General Schwartz' staff. It is
with Taylor that the incoming grid
iron "nuggets" will spend their first
year on the Farm. And to a large
extent it is Taylor who must con
vince the incoming cleatsters that
an education at Stanford is more
desirable than a small pension at
some other school.
More Taylor Woes
In addition to his football woes,
Coach Taylor also spends his win
ters "managing" the wrestling squad
and coaching the rugby team. (Re
garding rugby, Taylor claims, "I'm
just Marty Feldman's assistant.")
To make sure that the sandy-haired
Taylor doesn't have too much free
time, he is also "woe-man" in
Stanford's intramural set-up. He's
the guy to whom the Row-men run
in anguish when an Encina team
slips a couple of "ringers" in its
volleyball team.
And there it is. The cave to cave
scoop on how Stanford's "hibernat
ing" football coaches spend their
winters — wishing that it were
spring or fall —or even summer.
Winter to them is a necessary pe
riod of dull office routine, mechan
ical handshaking, and—most of all
play planning and personnel
work. It might well have been one
of this unhappy breed who—look
ing over his littered desk — first
sighed and wishfully muttered, "If
winter comes, can spring be far
behind?"
