## 
### 
Miss Augusta Roberts, na
tional YWCA secretary in Ma
nila, stopped here yesterday
on her way back from the Phil
ippines to speak at a luncheon
of the "Y" Advisory Board de
scribing her experiences in
helping with rehabilitation and
reconstruction in the islands.
Over 23.000 students attend just
one of the universities in Manila.
Miss Roberts said that the demand
for education has necessitated the

founding of private universities in
the city. Both men and women arc
conscientious in their work and in
their desire to build a better coun
try from the ruins about them.
Leadership
Women are beginning to learn
the meaning of leadership, Miss
Roberts said. At first they were
afraid to speak out, but after being
separated from the men they were
less afraid to speak. Both men and
women are used to large gioup dis
cussions, probab.y due to training
in law, so it was hard to conduct
small group meetings, added Miss
Roberts.
It takes a long time to conduct a
meeting because the students are
so particular about choosing the
right words, she said. The oiTicial
language of instruction i:; English.
Furthermore, time means nothing
in that tropical atmosphere; a meet
ing scheduled at 2 p.m. might not
take place until 3:30.
'"Women are very style - con
scious," she continued. They come
from horrible rubbles, all that is
elt of their home, but they look
neat and fresh always. They are i
beautiful women and just begin- j
ning to realize it.
Japan Visits
Miss Roberts went to China and
Japan just before reporting lw»ek to |
the United States. She said she was
one of eifbt passengers leaving on 1
the TWA evacuation planes. Miss
Roberts was pulled out of the Phil
ippines because her people can

YWCA policy not to keep Ameri

lorver than necessary. ' The people
are eat?er to carry on for them
selves," she concluded.
