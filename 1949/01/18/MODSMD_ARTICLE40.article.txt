The Bears have been had, and about that nobody is sad, but sett
down for awhile and we'll talk basketball. It'll be a cage rehash ot
meat and potatoes weekend against the finally-put-in-place Californ
Golden Bear.
For the first time in six years, six long years, a Stanford basket b;
team, wearing its sentimental splash ol red, went into the California Gyn
nasium and came out with a victory verdict.
Old "800 Pavilion" has been tough on us gentlemen Cards, but \
finally paired the course, and from here on in it's going to be eask
Thanks are due to the Davidsons, Stephensons, Yardleys, and the who
Card crew.
< AL ROOTERS HAVE IT
C. alifornia rooters have calmed down to a roar of late, possibly due
the Napoleon-like methods of Referee Lloyd Leith, but anyway they p
on a fine show.
Ihe Bears really talk it up before a game, something that Stanfo
white-shirts only make a half-hearted attempt to do. Starting off with
band that uses straw hats for uniforms, the Bears go through every stu
in the book.
Friday night California boys and girls sang five different songs, gave tl
axe-yell, added their own Oskie-wow-wow and Viva yells, and finish*
off with Come Join The Band in waltz-time tempo. And that was ;
accomplished in the space of about 10 minutes.
During the pre-game warmups down at the Stanford Pavilion one c;
spend his time counting bald heads or looking at sweaters across the wa
but one need not worry aLout exhausting one's self yelling. Leave
lace it. Were living on the conservative-cursed Farm.
SAN FRANCISCO SHOWS CLASS
Getting down to more serious business, the coming clash of the giai
billed for the Pavilion next Friday night should prove to be one of tl
biggest cage wars put on m the nation this season.
San Francisco, oozing class from every pore, has piled up a beautif
1-1 and 1 record, and has beaten teams such as CCNY. Bradley, Kans
State, and LaSalle. all pretty fat fives when you come right down to it.
Their center, Don McNamee, owns the Cow Palace individual scori
record at .'5B. and their "real" basketball player, forward Bob Lofgran.
a consistent 20-point man.
"tickets for the weekend have already perished, another point whi
could be used in the prosecution of the famous Stanford Pavilion, a ba
kctball barn which we could do without.
DON'T OVERLOOK SANTA CLARA
With all eyes foscused on the coming crucial with San Francisco, patro
of the bounce are apt to overlook Santa Clara's sometimes dangero
Broncos, who will lie taking over the Pavilion Saturday night.
The Broncos gave Stanford one complete scare in the Cow Palace, b
bowed in the last minute due to some fancy second-half work fcy Geor
Yaidljv and Bill Stephenson. The game finally was put to bed wi
Stanford on top by a bucket, 49 to 47. but nobody was impressed.
Saturday night would be just the right spot for them to get back t
win they lost.

Bill Rose, still waiting to take that Ecoii test, wasn't able to attend t
weekend basketball games. Rose, thinking that he was going to get com
for the two games, didn't bother to stand in line for tickets. But Ho

That's about it.and until I can put together a complete story on Sta

has got to go.
