## Coaches Bow to Row Five Varsity Lunnymen Ready for Broncs 
### 
Stanford's varsity boxing squad
intends to do some plain and fancy
bronco-roping this week; but they'll
be using jab and uppercuts in
place of the more conventional las
sos and branding irons. For the
Broncos they'll be going alter ar'e
those of Santa Clara University,
and chances are that the Broncos
will object to being branded and do
a little punching themse'ves.
Mentor Ray Lunny disclosed yes
terday that Wednesday's mauling
melee fit Santa Clara will feature at
least seven top-notch bouts, prob
ably more if the matches can be
arranged.
Best news of the day concerns
Mike Pelsinger, ace Card heavy
weight. who received a bad cut over
the eye in last Friday's light card
against Cal Poly. At first it was
believed that the Indians would be
forced to forfeit the heavyweight
division bout against the Broncos
due to Mikes injury. However, by
mutual agreement of the two
coaches, it has been decided that
the big boys wi'l wear headguards
in order that the feature match may
be scheduled.
Fred Ten Eyek. classy 165-
pounder, will enter the ting Wed
