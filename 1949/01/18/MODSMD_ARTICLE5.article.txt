# Truman Asks Restoration Of Overhauling Powers
## Veto Stays In Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (AP)
- President Truman asked to
day for the right to shake up
the executive branch of govern
ment. Quickly a bipartisan
move started to let him have it,
but Senator Taft (R-Ohio) urged
caution.
Mr. Truman asked the lawmakers:
1. To restore the power to over
haul the government that was held
by the President temporarily under
1939 and 1945 laws. He wants it
made permanent.
2. To make no exceptions. The
previous laws barred the President
from touching a number of agencies.
3. To keep the veto power in Con
-1 gress. This means that Mr. Tru
| man would lay any reorganization
plan before the lawmakers. If they
1 didn't approve they would have t>o
j days to kill it.
Plan Follows Hoover's
Mr. Truman's proposal followed
| similar recommendations by Chair
j man Herbert Hoover of the Com
mission on Government Reorganiza
tion. The former president wrote
j Congress last week that a general
: reshuffling of the "most gigantic
business on earth" is badly needed.
He also said that to get reoults there
should be no exempted agencies.
Mr. Truman's message prompted
| immediate introduction of a bill by
1 Chairman McClellan (D-Ark.) of
I the Senate Executive Expenditures
Committee to give him broad au
thority.
It was sponsored by three other
Democrats as well as Senator Mc-
I of Wisconsin, Republican
I spokesman on that committee. Sena
; tor Aiken (R-Vt.) former chairman,
; told a reporter he agrees with the
i Hoover recommendations.
No Trouble Expected
; In the House, Speaker Rayburn
! (D-Tex.) told reporters he expects
i the President's plan to have no
| trouble there.
| But Taft snid the reorganization
I request will be studied Friday by
| the Senate Republican Policy Com
i mittec, which Tai't heads.
"It ought to be very carefully ex
amined by Congress because of the
tremendous powers involved," Taft
told a reporter. "We don't want to
give the President authority to leg
islate, to change the powers of bu
j reaus set up by Congress."
Wants Transfer Power
McClellan said in a statement that
| under the bill Mr. Truman may
! submit to Congress plans to "trans
, fer, consolidate, or coordinate any
I agencies or functions of the execu
; tive branch and may also abolish
functions." In addition, such plans
'may authorize any officer to dele
gate any of his functions."
"Some of the provisions may be
controversial," said McClellan, whose
! committee is expected to handle the
bill.
I A House Republican. Rep. Hoeven
| of lowa, put in a sarcastic note.
"If he (the President) really wants
to effect economies and efficiency
I he can start almost anywhere," he
: told a reporter.
He said he understands that 360
| new people arc being hired every
i day in government departments and
1 "he will need to reorganize to find i
j jobs" for them.

dent's three-point program.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (AP)
- President Truman asked to
day for the right to shake up
the executive branch of govern
ment. Quickly a bipartisan
move started to let him have it,
but Senator Taft (R-Ohio) urged
caution.
Mr. Truman asked the lawmakers:
1. To restore the power to over
haul the government that was held
by the President temporarily under
1939 and 1945 laws. He wants it
made permanent.
2. To make no exceptions. The
previous laws barred the President
from touching a number of agencies.
3. To keep the veto power in Con
-1 gress. This means that Mr. Tru
| man would lay any reorganization
plan before the lawmakers. If they
1 didn't approve they would have t>o
j days to kill it.
Plan Follows Hoover's
Mr. Truman's proposal followed
| similar recommendations by Chair
j man Herbert Hoover of the Com
mission on Government Reorganiza
tion. The former president wrote
j Congress last week that a general
: reshuffling of the "most gigantic
business on earth" is badly needed.
He also said that to get reoults there
should be no exempted agencies.
Mr. Truman's message prompted
| immediate introduction of a bill by
1 Chairman McClellan (D-Ark.) of
I the Senate Executive Expenditures
Committee to give him broad au
thority.
It was sponsored by three other
Democrats as well as Senator Mc-
I of Wisconsin, Republican
I spokesman on that committee. Sena
; tor Aiken (R-Vt.) former chairman,
; told a reporter he agrees with the
i Hoover recommendations.
