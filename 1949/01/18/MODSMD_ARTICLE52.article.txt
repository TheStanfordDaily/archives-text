Fossils and the age of mammals can be interesting. Dr. George
Gaylord Simpson, noted professor of Paleontology at Columbia
University, proved this fact in an informative lecture on ancient
geography at Memorial Auditorium Friday night.
Dr. Simpson's subject v/as "The Continents During the Age

of Mammals."
Continental drift, one of the theo
ries of land separation, suggests
that the continents were once
massed together in much the same
shape they are now, but gradually
separated, Dr. Simpson said. This
accounts for the eastern <x>ast of
South America looking like the
piece of the puzzle that goes next
to Africa's west coast.
Bridges and Corridors
Dr. Simpson's theory is that dur
ing the past 70.000.000 years there
have been various major filter
bridges and corridors, a variable
sweepstakes route, and constant
barriers. Constant barriers, the
oceans, most likely were the same
as the}' are at present, he said. Ma
jor filter bridges and corridors
probably existed between North and
South America, between Africa and
Europe. Asia and the arehpelagoes
of the Pacific, and between Asia and
North America.
Using a humorous metaphor. Dr.
Simpson spoke of the variable
sweepstakes route between Eurasia
and Australia. He said that the odds
of animals island-hopping over the
sweepstakes route were approxi
mately 20,000 to one against them.
Migration to South
Mammals generally originated in
North America or the heart oi Eur
asia and circulated from there. Sa
ber-toothed tigers, rhinoceroses, and
camels once lived in North Amer
ica. Many types of North American
animals migrated to South America.
Dr. Simpson said. but. few animals
from south of the border have trav
eled north.
Dr. Vertress L. Vane-erHoof, as
sociate professor of geology, intro
duced Dr. Simpson.
Dr. Simpson lived up to the
praise of his introduction. His slides
consisted of explanatory cartoons
and admirab'e charts and maps. The
clarity and humor of his material
allowed the audience to enjoy a lec -
ture that might easily have been
made very technical.
