# Inaugural Fuss Strikes Capital
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (AP)—President Truman rang up the
curtain on the super-colosal inauguration festivities tonight with
pep talk asking cooperation in putting through his legislative
program and attaining world peace.
"I'm Just Wild About Harry," played a band as the President

f appeared in the Mayflower Hotel,
where 2,500 high officials and others
| attended a $15-a-plate dinner of the
Truman-Barkley Club.
It was the same ballroom in which,
nearly a year ago, Mr. Truman told
a dinner of Young Democrats:
' "There'll be another Democrat in
i the White House during the next
four years and you are looking at
I him."
Washington a Mammoth Carnival
Few believed that prediction then;
i but Washington tonight wore the air
of a mammoth carnival in tribute
to the man who made the political
miracle come true.
Mr. Truman appealed to the as
, sembled Democrats, to Congress anc.
to the people at large to cooperate
with him. Pie said he and Vice
president-elect Barkley face a tre
mendous burden.
"We are going to assume that
burden," he said, "and we are going
to do our best to carry out the
I things that are necessary to meet
the situation with which we are
faced, in this country and in the
world.
"But. we can't do that unless yoUj
and the Congress, and the people
of these United States get behind us
j and help us carry out those princi
ples that are necessary to get the
thing done, to get the peace in this
world that we need and that we are
j going to have."
i He also called on the Truman
; Barkley Club to continue active into
the 1950 campaign because "we
don't want to elect another 80th
j Congress."
Weatherman Pledges Cooperation
The weatherman pledged reason

, ceremonies on Thursday, but the
! Senate threw a financial monkey
wrench.
The forecast, for the hour when the
President is sworn into his present
job at better pay, is for wind, clouds,
and chill. No rain or snow.
But the Senate atmosphere was
: frigid as it voted, 47 to 44, against
' exempting t i c k e ts to inaugural
events from the 20 per cent federal
tax. It was the first administration
defeat in the new Democratic Con
gress. #
The tickets have been sold out.
■ with no tax collected. It was guessed
unofficially that the tax on parade,
inaugural ball, and other tickets
might be $60,000.
