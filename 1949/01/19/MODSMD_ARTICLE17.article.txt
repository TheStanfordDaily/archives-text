# Phi Sigs' House Will Have New Wing and 'Face-Lifting'
## 
### 
Ground was broken Monday on
tit. 1 first post-war expansion project
unk-rtaken by a Farm fraternity,
vhen San Francisco contractor Jay
-Juetnick began construction of a
lew wing for the Phi Sigma Kappa
iouse at 564 Mayfield.
The addition, when completed,
vi 11 provide the Phi Sigs with a
•picious new living room, four ad
itional study rooms on the second
ioor, and increased bathroom l'acil
lies. Plans for the new house were
)ri .in illy foimulated in 1941, but
•uttered a forced postponement due
o the war.
Quetniek has estimated that the
.ving wi'l be under construction for
approximately three months. In ad
lition to the new construction, the
iouse will receive a complete out
ride stucco face-lifting; and current
plans also call for extensive remod
lin 4 of the interior of the present
iouse.
There is just one fly in the oint
ment as lai* as the Phi Sig actives
ire concerned —they will be with
ut a bathroom for about six weeks
luring the installation of the new
■eilities. But they are agreed to a
m n that any hardships entailed
will be more than repaid when their
new home is completed.
