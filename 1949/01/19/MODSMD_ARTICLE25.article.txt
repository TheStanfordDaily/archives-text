## Our Feud With W.C. 
### 
In today's mail was a letter from a girl (signed by others) who
thinks The Daily's latest quarrel with Women's Council is over
the Demerit Plan. She went to some trouble to point out why
it is a good system.
Evidently we gave the wrong impression somehow when we
said that women's regulations were being "amended constantly."
What we meant was that regulations and "orientation" are
showing signs of becoming too complicated. We were not re
ferring to the Demerit Plan at all.
As a matter of fact, The Daily stated editorially three or four
times that the plan is good legislation. We merely objected to
its being railroaded through without being submitted to the vote
of women students and without the bonus system if the women
wanted it.
It's true we've been feuding with W.C. since early in the
school year, but for varying reasons.
First, we learned that three members of Women's Council
were in on a plan to tack third person responsibility to social
regulations. Without wasting words, the plan is fantastic.
Next, it was the railroading of the Demerit Plan that drew our
fire.
Most recently it was a rash of reports of "raw deals" handed
out by the Council. We suggested that the v/omen take more
care in selecting the members of Women's Council.
There's nothing inherently wrong with Women's Council and
women's regulations per se, and we hope we haven't given
that impression.
