Plan and Counter Plan
To (he Editor:
Your solution for the insufficient number of basketball tickets is not a
good one, for you are discussing the situation from the side of the lazy
Stanfordite, the person who turns over and shuts off his alarm clock,
telling himself illogically that there will still be some tickcts for sale
when he climbs from the arms of Morpheus; or the person who decides
on Thursday afternoon that he just has to see Joe Schmoe, the center
from XXU", on Friday night, and then complains loud and long because
he can't find any tickets.
Your article suggests that you are a member of this class of Stanford
students. Therefore, I have a plan to offer you and the other members
of your late-rising group. Next Monday morning, get up when your
alarm clock rings (don't set it for 10 o'clock), eat quickly, and leave
before you have a chance to change your mind. If you're among the first
100 in line, you'll have plenty of time to arrive in time for your nine
o'clock.
A bigger Pavilion would be a help, but it would not solve the problem
completely, for even Cal with its larger gym has, in comparison, longer
lines and many more disappointed due to a greater amount of basketball
Jans.
At any sale the truth to the matter is the early bird gets the worm,
and at Stanford the wormless brave or squaw has no right to complain,
for he could have been early too.
