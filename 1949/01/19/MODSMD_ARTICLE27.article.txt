This idea, originated by a Southampton, England, paper publisher, re
portedly is sweeping the British Isles: Build a boat that will be a replica
of the Mayflower and have a second band of Pilgrims sail across the At
lantic to land at Plymouth! It's a pretty cute idea. But I would amend
the gentleman's idea; to wit, instead of a new crowd of blue bloods, put
on that new Mayflower representatives of Europe's refugees whose uncer
tain haven is the British Isles. Yes, this time let's get on that Pilgrim
boat the Adlebcrgs and Axclsons, the Kamphoefners and von Kalinow
skis, the Pappases and the Polettis, the Yanamuras and the Yees, the
Zebroskys and the Zischkes. No English Anglo-Saxons on this boat, see?
What's the object? Why keep off the Moores, the Joneses, and the
Smiths and the other Anglican etceteras? Well, they'll be getting into
the U.S. under the unfair and frozen status-quo immigration laws any
way. Keep them off the new Mayflower—other than one or two of them.
Reverse the prejudice on this one symbolic occasion and give the Natuni
wizces and the Metovskys a break.
