## A 						Long-Suffering Reactions To His 
### 
Not long ago we dissected the classification homo
profs. Lets switch to the other side of the pulpit
and give those long-suffering profs a break. What
are the types of students he sees from behind his
specs?
1. Sleight of mind:
This student is so enmeshed in the net of ancient
history that he's drowning in it. He's just asleep in
the deep mystery of history. His eyes are glazed, his
mouth is open. He's given up the ship. He's probably
asleep.
Reaction:
a. Yep. it's Monday again.
b. There must be an easier way to make a living.
c. Guess 111 take a trip to China ... on a slow
boat . . . after this quarter.
2. The jitterbug:
This kid has ants in his pants. lie twitches, lie
squirms. Step right up. ladies and gentlemen . . .
Reaction:
a. Ihe money I could make as a sideshow barker
with this bunch of freaks.
b. Third door to the left down the hall, bud.
c. Guess I'll take a long trip to Siberia after this
quarter and rest up.

ing, anyhow.
Reaction:
a. Forget it, honey. I'm old enough to be your
grandpa.
b. Okay, smile! So you've still got your own teeth!
Just wait 20 years.
c. Guess I'll take a rest cure in France after this
quarter.

jokes. Maybe she'll get them later. Must be prac-
