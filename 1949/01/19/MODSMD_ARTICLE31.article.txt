# 'Influence Friends and Make People'
## 
### BOB RIGNEY 
I burst into my room the other
clay and found an old friend of mine
flipping through his Hash cards
telephone numbers on one side,
girls' names on the other. "What's
new with you?" he asked, meaning
women of course.
"Nothing," I replied dolefully as
I put down my book. "How to In
fluence Friends and Make People."
"I just don't seem to know how to
attract them.'"
"You just don't use the right bait.
Let me fix you up," ho offered gen
erously. But I was a little dubious.
After all, he worked on an Alaskan
fishing boat last summer and what
ever bait he uses still draws purely
planktonic women.
As I was thinking the matter
over, in walked my roommate with
his dignified and measured tread.
'"My bags, boy." he commanded. He
can talk that way. He's witty,
suave, urban, cultured, and also has
a car. Besides, he is hasher at
Roble and wades neck deep in
women three times a day. That
makes him chief among men in my
college dorm civilization.
"Wait ti! 1 I tell you about my date
last night," were his next words.
He always greets me with that sen
tence. Like all Stanford men ho
has a wide range of conversational
topics. "The Balalaika," he contin
ued, "good music, food, beautiful
girl, and the conversation was
sparkling. Just sparkling!" He goes
in for the best things of life. "We
played Hinky. Pinky all the way
home."
"Gee." I murmured awestruck. I
can never think of anything to say
when I'm out with a woman. Tint
is. I don't think I could if a girl
would ever go out with me. The
only ones who would look as if they
would give me trichinosis if 1
touched them.
The conversation between my two
friends turned to women and 1 l'eM
frustrated again. There was noth
ing left for me to do but go off in
a corner and sublimate.
