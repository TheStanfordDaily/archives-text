# Navy Head Believes Strong Defense Is Price of Peace
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15 </P).—
The Navy does not expect present
international ■ controversies to lead
to war, Secretary John L. Sullivan
stated, but believes a powerful de
fense is the price of peace.
"Literally speaking, that price is
rising," Sullivan said in his annual
report for 1047-48.
Following within a week Presi
dent Truman's request for $14,000.-
000,000 for the armed services—the
largest peacetime military budget in
the nation's history — Sullivan de
clared future Navy budgets "'ines
capably" will be even higher.
Higher Costs
"Maintaining an effective Navy
has required large appropriations
in recent years," he said. "To main
tain an equally effective Navy in
the future, the cost inescapably will
be still larger."
The reasons he listed — inflation,
more complex war machines, and
exhaustion of wartime stockpiles—
presumably would apply with equal
force to Army and Air Force money
needs.
"It is felt that the international
controversies developing since
World War II are susceptible to
eventual resolution," Sullivan com
mented, adding:
Strong Defense
"In any event, a strong defense is
the greatest deterrent to attack, and
is therefore a powerful influence for
peace. The Navy's plans and condi
tion of readiness are geared to pro
vide that influence . . ."
"Radical" changes in antiaircraft
guns, heavier and faster planes,
faster submarines, faster ships, and
better detection and destruction
methods are being developed
against the major threats of "fast
deep - diving submarines, high
speed planes, and guided missiles
and atomic weapons." he said.
As to the future, Sullivan said
remote "push - button" warfare is
far from realization and "may not
fully materialize in our time."
At the same time, he added, im
provements in weapons are pro
ceeding swiftly and any future war
would find radical alteration in tra
ditional methods of naval warfare.
Recent developments in the field
of guided missiles "have exceeded
expectations," he said, listing such

milestones as the launching of ;
German V-2 rocket from a carriei
the firing of a smaller V-l rocke
from a submarine, and the develop
ment of the ram-jet engine.
Antiaircraft
Greatly improved antiaircraf
guns are expected to punch dowi
attacking aircraft at much greau
ranges, now and in the immediate
future, Sullivan said.
.He noted the trend toward aut >•
matic control of aircraft "whvi
may mean eventually the end o
piloted military aircraft as they an
known today." .
At another point in his report, h
said, "It is anticipated that speed:
may be reached soon where man
ual control of an airplane as wi
now know it may no longer be pos
sible."
And to avoid the mass damage o
atomic bombs, Sullivan said tin
huge fleet of laid-up ships is scat
tered at 20 points on the East. West
and Gulf coasts and decentraliza
tion of shore stations and bases i:
being weighed as a protective meas
ure.
Two "radically different" antra!
guns to increase "materially" Nav\
plane firepower arc under develop
ment, a Navy official said in am
plification of the report.
Rockets
Rockets with double the walloj
and performance of wartime lock
ets are in the design stage, as wel
as more accurate fire control sys
tems, he added.
Sullivan said the 20 - millimetei
cannon will soon replace the .50-
caliber machine gun in almost a!
new aircraft.
Although the Navy has beer
reaching back into the storeroom!
and partly living on wartime sup
plies. Sullivan warned that the cup
board is getting empty.
He said that this year (1945--1!)
the actual cost of operating tin
Navy will exceed by more than on<
billion dollars the cash voted b\
Congress.
Appropriations
"Inevitably this . . . will neces
sitate increases in future appropri
ations if the present size and scopt
of naval operations is to be sup
ported."
