# Eating Clubs Plan New Building for Members
## 
### TERRY GREEN 
With plans for an eating club
building materializing, the embat
tled members are beginning to see
ight in their struggle to regain the
position the clubs held at Stanford
for more than 40 years.
Arising from an urgent need, in
to very early days, to have a place
to eat. the clubs "went through an
amazing growth in which many
turned into fraternities and co-op
erative houses, some disbanded, and
seven survived into the '20's as an
institution. unique to Stanford.
When Stanford opened its doors,
vneais were served in Encina for the
men living there. This dining hall
was closed after a few years, leav
ing the men no place to eat but the
swamped Stanford Inn, which stood
at approximately the location of the
main libe.
The result was that most of the
nen walked into Mayfield or Menlo
Park three times a dav—and natu-

rally began to form clubs which
walked and ate together.
Early Hisoary Obscure
The early history of the clubs is
very obscure and hard to find, since
practically no records were kept,
and it was almost 1920, when Ihe
clubs began to assume their mature
form, that they began to bother
with getitng pages in the Quad.
One ot the first groups to be
formed, and which still exists, as an
eating club, was Los Arcos, which
was formed about 1902. The de
funct Coyote Ciub was formed at
about the same time; a few years
later it disbanded, and reformed as
Breakers. Most of the other clubs
date from this general time.
Three of the present clubs —
Breakers, El Campo, and El Toro—
built shacks in the field across the
road east of Encina in 1912. Known
as the "Little Quad,'' these buildings
combined kitchen, dining room, and
lounge for each dub.
Buildings Condemned
During the war they were con
demned as unfit for such use and
carted ofi to the ROTC area where
they were used as auxiliary stables.
They were torn up during this last
Christmas vacation and the lumber
sold.
When the Encina Commons was
built in 1922. four clubs—El Capi
tan. El Cuadro. El Tigre. and Los
Arcos —were given small dining
rooms there, which they furnished
and used as dining rooms and
lounges. The food was bought from
the Commons, and the clubs hired
their own hashers and took care of
the rooms.
In 1942 the eating clubs sus
pended operations for the duration j
of the war, as did the fraternities, j
When the eating club members !
came back in the fall of 1946, they ;
found no clubrooms, their records
and property stored in various base- 1

ments, and a total membership of
about 60. They were qiven a small
dining room in the Commons—what
one club had previously had — for
all the clubs, and later were moved
to one of the large rooms there.
Building Considered
At last they have been to!d that
they may be allowed to build them
selves quarters, and committees are
working closely with the University
to get plans drawn up for an eating
club building. No concrete ideas
have been settled on, but each club
will have a dining room-lounge, ei
ther combined or separate.
With the opening of Stern Hall
and the consequent easing of the
housing shortage on the Farm, the
c'ubs expect to be able to offer
more to their members than their
present percentage of rooms in
Toyon Hall.
Characterized by a free and easy
camaraderie, with two basic rules—
that an eating club does not force
its members into compliance with
the group action but gets united ac
tion through enthusiasm, and that
an eating club pays no attention to
race, creed, or color—the clubs have
a disproportionately large percent
age of student leaders in all Stan
ford activities. In the last 25 years,
about half the student body presi
dents have been eating club men. as
one example, and today they oc
cupy positions of top leadership in
oraetically every activity on the
Farm.
With a new building, dining room
and lounge for each club, the eat
ing club men of Stanford expect
the clubs to enter a period of great
er productive activity and more
plain good fun than ever before.

The early history of the clubs is
very obscure and hard to find, since
practically no records were kept,
and it was almost 1920, when Ihe
clubs began to assume their mature
form, that they began to bother
with getitng pages in the Quad.
One ot the first groups to be
formed, and which still exists, as an
eating club, was Los Arcos, which
was formed about 1902. The de
funct Coyote Ciub was formed at
about the same time; a few years
later it disbanded, and reformed as
Breakers. Most of the other clubs
date from this general time.
Three of the present clubs —
Breakers, El Campo, and El Toro—
built shacks in the field across the
road east of Encina in 1912. Known
as the "Little Quad,'' these buildings
combined kitchen, dining room, and
lounge for each dub.
Buildings Condemned
During the war they were con
demned as unfit for such use and
carted ofi to the ROTC area where
they were used as auxiliary stables.
They were torn up during this last
Christmas vacation and the lumber
sold.
When the Encina Commons was
built in 1922. four clubs—El Capi
tan. El Cuadro. El Tigre. and Los
Arcos —were given small dining
rooms there, which they furnished
and used as dining rooms and
lounges. The food was bought from
the Commons, and the clubs hired
their own hashers and took care of
the rooms.
In 1942 the eating clubs sus
pended operations for the duration j
of the war, as did the fraternities, j
When the eating club members !
came back in the fall of 1946, they ;
found no clubrooms, their records
and property stored in various base- 1

ments, and a total membership of
about 60. They were qiven a small
dining room in the Commons—what
one club had previously had — for
all the clubs, and later were moved
to one of the large rooms there.
Building Considered
At last they have been to!d that
they may be allowed to build them
selves quarters, and committees are
working closely with the University
to get plans drawn up for an eating
club building. No concrete ideas
have been settled on, but each club
will have a dining room-lounge, ei
ther combined or separate.
With the opening of Stern Hall
and the consequent easing of the
housing shortage on the Farm, the
c'ubs expect to be able to offer
more to their members than their
present percentage of rooms in
Toyon Hall.
Characterized by a free and easy
camaraderie, with two basic rules—
that an eating club does not force
its members into compliance with
the group action but gets united ac

position the clubs held at Stanford
for more than 40 years.
Arising from an urgent need, in
to very early days, to have a place
to eat. the clubs "went through an

institution. unique to Stanford.
When Stanford opened its doors,
vneais were served in Encina for the
men living there. This dining hall
was closed after a few years, leav
ing the men no place to eat but the
swamped Stanford Inn, which stood
at approximately the location of the
main libe.

they were used as auxiliary stables.
They were torn up during this last
Christmas vacation and the lumber
sold.
When the Encina Commons was
built in 1922. four clubs—El Capi
tan. El Cuadro. El Tigre. and Los
Arcos —were given small dining
rooms there, which they furnished
and used as dining rooms and
lounges. The food was bought from
the Commons, and the clubs hired
their own hashers and took care of
the rooms.
In 1942 the eating clubs sus
pended operations for the duration j
of the war, as did the fraternities, j
When the eating club members !
came back in the fall of 1946, they ;
found no clubrooms, their records
and property stored in various base- 1

ments, and a total membership of
about 60. They were qiven a small
dining room in the Commons—what
one club had previously had — for
all the clubs, and later were moved
to one of the large rooms there.
Building Considered
At last they have been to!d that
they may be allowed to build them
selves quarters, and committees are
working closely with the University
to get plans drawn up for an eating
club building. No concrete ideas
have been settled on, but each club
will have a dining room-lounge, ei
ther combined or separate.
With the opening of Stern Hall
and the consequent easing of the
housing shortage on the Farm, the
c'ubs expect to be able to offer
more to their members than their
present percentage of rooms in
Toyon Hall.
Characterized by a free and easy
camaraderie, with two basic rules—
that an eating club does not force
its members into compliance with
the group action but gets united ac

an eating club pays no attention to
race, creed, or color—the clubs have
a disproportionately large percent
age of student leaders in all Stan
ford activities. In the last 25 years,
about half the student body presi
dents have been eating club men. as
one example, and today they oc
cupy positions of top leadership in
oraetically every activity on the
Farm.
With a new building, dining room
and lounge for each club, the eat
ing club men of Stanford expect
the clubs to enter a period of great
er productive activity and more
plain good fun than ever before.
