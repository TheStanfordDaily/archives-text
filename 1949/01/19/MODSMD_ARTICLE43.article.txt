# Stanford-Don Cage Tilt Looms as Struggle For Mythical Pacific Coast Championship
## 
### 
San Francisco's highly rated Hill -
J toppers, hungry for added glory,
will invade the Pavilion Friday
night to battle Stanford for the
| mythical championship of the Pa
| cific Coast.
Pete Newell's USF cagers, easily
; the top independent team in the
West, have a sparkling record of 14
wins and only one defeat. Among
I Don victims are Bradley, Kansas
| State, LaSalle, California, North
j Carolina State, Loyola, and several
j other top quintets.
Their lone loss came at the hands
' of UCLA, being a 61-57 affair that
definitely caught the Dons on a bad
j night.
McNamce and Lofgran
Led by two tall sharpshooters,
| center Joe McNamee. 6-6, and a
high-scoring forward, Don Lofgran.
6-s'/2, the Hilltoppers will be out
; to add Stanford to their list of ac
complishments.
A win over Stanford would give
San Francsico added prestige and
would just about cinch the Dons a
bid to the post-season playoffs in
Madison Square Garden. The game

! will also decide just which is ac- j
tually the top team on the Coast, an J
| honor upon which Stanford has its |
j own eyes fastened.
While the Deanmen were lower
ing the boom on California, the
I Dons took the measure of Loyola
! and Santa Clara last weekend. The i
{ Loyola win was a 40-39 squeak
earned by freezing the ball during
the final minute of play.
Tight Games for USF
San Francisco's 49-43 victory over
j Santa Clara was the second time j
! this year that USF has beaten the
j Broncos.
So far this season, the Hilltoppers
j have been masters of the tight
: squeak. Six of their 14 wins have
! been by three points or less,
i Number one man in the Don of
i fensive is Don Lofgran, who has
dumped in a total of 205 points for ,
a 13.7 average per game. Also handy j
around the hoop is center Joe Mc-
Namee, who tossed in 38 points one
; night against Santa Clara to break
' the scoring record at the Cow Pal
: ace.
Other cogs in the Don attack are

guards Rene Herrerias and Ross
Giudice. Pete Rozelle, USF pub
licity man, likes to call them "San
Francisco's watch - charm guards,
two of the smallest regulars in the
country."
Herrerias is 5-9 and weighs 137
pounds, while Giudice barely out
does him at 5-10 and 145. Their
ball hawking is one of the keys to
the Dons' steady stream of tri
umphs.
John Bennington, referred to as
the steadiest man on the squad, is
the fifth man for the Dons. Ben
nington acted as game captain for
USF in most of last year's games,
and will probably be game captain
against Stanford. A 26 - year - old
junior, he is a good set shot and a
consistent scorer.
Don reserves are plentiful, and
boys such as Hal DeJulio, John
Hanley, and Frank Kuzara expect
to see extensive action against Stan
ford.
Tickets for the game have already
disappeared, and public interest is
running high for this "struggle oi
the giants," probably the outstand
ing contest to be staged in the Pa
vilion this year.

So far this season, the Hilltoppers

i Number one man in the Don of

dumped in a total of 205 points for ,
a 13.7 average per game. Also handy j
around the hoop is center Joe Mc-
