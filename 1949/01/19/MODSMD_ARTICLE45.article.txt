The Stanford-USF baskettall game Friday will be interesting for sev
eral reasons. Reason one might well be that USF is rated sixth in the
nation's basketball scene by the Associated Press. Stanford ranks 17th.
Ii the Cards get by this one. their stock should raise considerably as the
Dons hold wins over some of the nation's best squads. The Indians have
;i few big scalps of their own. Michigan, Yale, among others.
Intramural Dliector Chuck Taylor gives with a few figures that show
that the murals have reached the big business scale. Winter quarter
play at Stanford involves some 1300 men students. Basketball claims
about 910, bowling 160. and table tennis 250.
Mural athletic turnout has reached an all-time high with this quarter's
play. The Encina Gym and the Pavilion are kept busy four nights a
week with four games a night. This scheduling takes care of 96 teams
or 14 leagues. Two leagues of eight teams each use the Village Gym four
alternoons a week. The Village Gym is a municipal affair and its use is
thereby curtailed.
There's a Lot of Work to These Murals
Thus, it can be seen that 10 games a week are played. Over a seven
week period some 280 tilts are held. These games must fee recorded, the
winners in each league matched with other winners, and a playoff series
held to determine the University champion.
Last year's champs, the Phi Delt Trojans, look as if they might be a
repeater this season. They scored 68 points, a lot of points in any league,
to their opponents' 8. in their first contest this year. But it's a long
battle before the champ will be crowned and more than one favored
team will lose to some squad they didn't fear .... which is what makes
the murals the interesting games they are.
Taylor would like to see more teams from faculty groups entered. He
will form a separate league for such squads if there are enough teams
entered for spring quarter play.
\> e \\ ouder Ahout Mr. Patton
Mel Patton's announced decision to retire from the track scene and
forego his last year of collegiate eligibility was received with a "We'll
wait and see" attitude hereabouts. Patton pleads the need for time to
work to earn the means to support his wife and child. Such might well
be the case. But this reporter can hardly see a school such as USC let
ting a sure 10-point-per-meet track man go for such a reason. I'm sure
there is more than one USC alumnus that would be willing to shell
out the amount that Pell-Mell would earn in a week to see the sprinter
continue to dominate the world's dashmen for ol" SC.
Patton's decision to retire might be based upon the feeling that he has
reached the top and any further competition would only dull the glamor
that surrounds his name.
Hard for Mel to Improve Much
Mcl is co-holder of the world record for the 100-yard dash with a 9.4
mark. He holds the American record, which is up for world recognition,
with a time of 9.3. He also broke the world record for the 200 meters,
one turn, (which, incidentally, was held by Stanford track coach Jack
Weiershauser since 1937) in the Olympic tryouts last year.
He would have to shave two-tenths of a second off his best mark in
♦he 100 meters dash and four-tenths off his 220 yards straightaway time.
This is pretty hard to do when one reaches the figures held by Patton
and the "world's fastest human" might have decided that it is just beyond
him. He holds two of the lour top dash marks and may let it go at that.
But, as one BAC member put it, "We'll wait until after a couple of USC
meets before we comment." And maybe that is what we should have done.
All of which brings us around to something that has been known for
some time but hasn't seen the light of print in this area.
Six Stanford track men have been li :ted in the 1 rack and Field News*
among the World's 1948 List of top track and field men. Larry HofT's 47.6
seconds in the 400-meter race places him 19th in the 1948 world crop.
Downing McKee and Darrell Kreitz rank 13th and 14th, respectively, in
the 110-meter hurdles, and Bill Larson's 14 feet mark puts him in ninth
place in the pole vault group. Gay Bryan hit 24 feet 5 inches in the UCLA
meet broad jump and this hop gained him 12th place in that division.
Otis Chandler's 53 feet 7 , i> inch toss with the shot puts him eighth in
the 1948 results.
Howard Bugbee, now a Stanford freshman, made the list when in high
school. His 9.5 hundred earned him a 10th place standing in that division.

Weiershauser since 1937) in the Olympic tryouts last year.
He would have to shave two-tenths of a second off his best mark in
♦he 100 meters dash and four-tenths off his 220 yards straightaway time.
This is pretty hard to do when one reaches the figures held by Patton
and the "world's fastest human" might have decided that it is just beyond
him. He holds two of the lour top dash marks and may let it go at that.
But, as one BAC member put it, "We'll wait until after a couple of USC
meets before we comment." And maybe that is what we should have done.
All of which brings us around to something that has been known for
some time but hasn't seen the light of print in this area.
Six Stanford track men have been li :ted in the 1 rack and Field News*
among the World's 1948 List of top track and field men. Larry HofT's 47.6
seconds in the 400-meter race places him 19th in the 1948 world crop.
Downing McKee and Darrell Kreitz rank 13th and 14th, respectively, in
the 110-meter hurdles, and Bill Larson's 14 feet mark puts him in ninth
place in the pole vault group. Gay Bryan hit 24 feet 5 inches in the UCLA
meet broad jump and this hop gained him 12th place in that division.
Otis Chandler's 53 feet 7 , i> inch toss with the shot puts him eighth in
the 1948 results.
Howard Bugbee, now a Stanford freshman, made the list when in high
school. His 9.5 hundred earned him a 10th place standing in that division.
The Stanford-USF baskettall game Friday will be interesting for sev
eral reasons. Reason one might well be that USF is rated sixth in the
nation's basketball scene by the Associated Press. Stanford ranks 17th.
Ii the Cards get by this one. their stock should raise considerably as the
Dons hold wins over some of the nation's best squads. The Indians have
;i few big scalps of their own. Michigan, Yale, among others.
Intramural Dliector Chuck Taylor gives with a few figures that show
that the murals have reached the big business scale. Winter quarter
play at Stanford involves some 1300 men students. Basketball claims
about 910, bowling 160. and table tennis 250.
Mural athletic turnout has reached an all-time high with this quarter's
play. The Encina Gym and the Pavilion are kept busy four nights a
week with four games a night. This scheduling takes care of 96 teams
or 14 leagues. Two leagues of eight teams each use the Village Gym four
alternoons a week. The Village Gym is a municipal affair and its use is
thereby curtailed.
There's a Lot of Work to These Murals
Thus, it can be seen that 10 games a week are played. Over a seven
week period some 280 tilts are held. These games must fee recorded, the
winners in each league matched with other winners, and a playoff series
held to determine the University champion.
Last year's champs, the Phi Delt Trojans, look as if they might be a
repeater this season. They scored 68 points, a lot of points in any league,
to their opponents' 8. in their first contest this year. But it's a long
battle before the champ will be crowned and more than one favored
team will lose to some squad they didn't fear .... which is what makes
the murals the interesting games they are.
Taylor would like to see more teams from faculty groups entered. He
will form a separate league for such squads if there are enough teams
entered for spring quarter play.
\> e \\ ouder Ahout Mr. Patton
Mel Patton's announced decision to retire from the track scene and
forego his last year of collegiate eligibility was received with a "We'll
wait and see" attitude hereabouts. Patton pleads the need for time to
work to earn the means to support his wife and child. Such might well
be the case. But this reporter can hardly see a school such as USC let
ting a sure 10-point-per-meet track man go for such a reason. I'm sure
there is more than one USC alumnus that would be willing to shell
out the amount that Pell-Mell would earn in a week to see the sprinter
continue to dominate the world's dashmen for ol" SC.
Patton's decision to retire might be based upon the feeling that he has
reached the top and any further competition would only dull the glamor
that surrounds his name.

Last year's champs, the Phi Delt Trojans, look as if they might be a
repeater this season. They scored 68 points, a lot of points in any league,
to their opponents' 8. in their first contest this year. But it's a long
battle before the champ will be crowned and more than one favored
team will lose to some squad they didn't fear .... which is what makes
the murals the interesting games they are.
Taylor would like to see more teams from faculty groups entered. He
will form a separate league for such squads if there are enough teams
entered for spring quarter play.

Mel Patton's announced decision to retire from the track scene and
forego his last year of collegiate eligibility was received with a "We'll
wait and see" attitude hereabouts. Patton pleads the need for time to
work to earn the means to support his wife and child. Such might well
be the case. But this reporter can hardly see a school such as USC let
ting a sure 10-point-per-meet track man go for such a reason. I'm sure
there is more than one USC alumnus that would be willing to shell
out the amount that Pell-Mell would earn in a week to see the sprinter
continue to dominate the world's dashmen for ol" SC.
Patton's decision to retire might be based upon the feeling that he has
reached the top and any further competition would only dull the glamor
that surrounds his name.
Hard for Mel to Improve Much
Mcl is co-holder of the world record for the 100-yard dash with a 9.4
mark. He holds the American record, which is up for world recognition,
with a time of 9.3. He also broke the world record for the 200 meters,
one turn, (which, incidentally, was held by Stanford track coach Jack
Weiershauser since 1937) in the Olympic tryouts last year.
He would have to shave two-tenths of a second off his best mark in
♦he 100 meters dash and four-tenths off his 220 yards straightaway time.
This is pretty hard to do when one reaches the figures held by Patton
and the "world's fastest human" might have decided that it is just beyond
him. He holds two of the lour top dash marks and may let it go at that.
But, as one BAC member put it, "We'll wait until after a couple of USC
meets before we comment." And maybe that is what we should have done.
All of which brings us around to something that has been known for
some time but hasn't seen the light of print in this area.
Six Stanford track men have been li :ted in the 1 rack and Field News*
among the World's 1948 List of top track and field men. Larry HofT's 47.6
seconds in the 400-meter race places him 19th in the 1948 world crop.
Downing McKee and Darrell Kreitz rank 13th and 14th, respectively, in
the 110-meter hurdles, and Bill Larson's 14 feet mark puts him in ninth
place in the pole vault group. Gay Bryan hit 24 feet 5 inches in the UCLA
meet broad jump and this hop gained him 12th place in that division.
Otis Chandler's 53 feet 7 , i> inch toss with the shot puts him eighth in
the 1948 results.
Howard Bugbee, now a Stanford freshman, made the list when in high
school. His 9.5 hundred earned him a 10th place standing in that division.
The Stanford-USF baskettall game Friday will be interesting for sev
eral reasons. Reason one might well be that USF is rated sixth in the
nation's basketball scene by the Associated Press. Stanford ranks 17th.
Ii the Cards get by this one. their stock should raise considerably as the
Dons hold wins over some of the nation's best squads. The Indians have
;i few big scalps of their own. Michigan, Yale, among others.
Intramural Dliector Chuck Taylor gives with a few figures that show
that the murals have reached the big business scale. Winter quarter
play at Stanford involves some 1300 men students. Basketball claims
about 910, bowling 160. and table tennis 250.
Mural athletic turnout has reached an all-time high with this quarter's
play. The Encina Gym and the Pavilion are kept busy four nights a
week with four games a night. This scheduling takes care of 96 teams
or 14 leagues. Two leagues of eight teams each use the Village Gym four
alternoons a week. The Village Gym is a municipal affair and its use is
thereby curtailed.
There's a Lot of Work to These Murals
Thus, it can be seen that 10 games a week are played. Over a seven
week period some 280 tilts are held. These games must fee recorded, the
winners in each league matched with other winners, and a playoff series
held to determine the University champion.
Last year's champs, the Phi Delt Trojans, look as if they might be a
