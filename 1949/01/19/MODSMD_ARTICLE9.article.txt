## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 18 (.Pi.â€”
Dean Acheson, 55-year-old lawyer
diplomat. won Senate confirmation
as the new Secretary of State by
an overwhelming 83 to 6 vote today.
Before the vote Senator Vanden
berg (R.. Mich.) served notice that
confirmation does not necessarily
mean approval of future develop
ments in administration foreign
policy. He praised Acheson. but said
President Truman's foreign policies
may be "impromptu and unpre
dicted."
But Chairman Connally (D..
Tex.), chairman of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, hailed
the vote as a "ratification of our
foreign policy of firmness and vig
or." He called Acheson eminently
qualified to handle the "gigantic"
duties of the nation's No. 1 diplo
matic post.
Acheson is expected to be sworn
in Thursday or Friday as the fifth
Secretary of State the nation has
had in five years. He succeeds ail
ing Gen. George C. Marshall, who
resigned following a serious oper
ation.
Six Republicans cast the only
votes against Acheson. They were
Senators Bridges (N.H.), Capehart
(Ind.), Jenner (Ind.), Knowland
(Calif.), Langer (N.D.), and Wherry
(Neb.).
