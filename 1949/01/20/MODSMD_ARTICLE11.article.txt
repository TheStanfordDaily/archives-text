# Lock-outs and Demerit Plan Compared in Summary List
## 
### 
"You know what will happen to
you under the proposed Demerit
plan, while Women's Council de
cides what will happen under the
ptesent lock-in lock-out system,"
stated Gigi Marion. AWS Cabinet
head, yesterday evening.
Miss Marion and other members
of Advisory Board have compiled a
summary list contrasting the differ
ences between the proposed De
merit plan, which will be voted on
next Monday, and the present lock
in. lock-out system.
Present System
At present women must appear
before their house committee after
every technical, offense, and lock
out. This house committee may im
pose a penalty of one or more lock
ins plus a lecture. Under the pro
posed Demerit plan, women are not
called before the house committee
at all. They appear before Women's
Council only after they have ac
cumulated four demerits.
Council, under the present plan,
has the power to give a woman any
number of lock-ins, suspend her. or
put her on social probation for hav
ing accumulated a large number of
lockouts and technicals. No definite
line is drawn as to when a woman
may be put on social probation or
suspended: instead this is left to the
judgment of Women's Council.
No Lock-outs
Under the proposed plan. Council
may not give lock-outs. Instead
they may put a woman on social
probation after she has received her
fourth demerit and suspend her
from school after she has received
her filth demerit. Any case may be
appealed within two weeks of vio
lation.
Whereas four demerits are accu
mulated after 32 technicals or a
120-minute lock-out or 20 lock-outs
or 12 offenses, under the Demerit

plan women must see Women's
Council after seven technicals. 60-
minute lock-out, or three offenses
now.
Classification
Violations under either system
are classified as lock-outs, offenses,
and technicals. An offense is fail
ure to sign out or in. taking more
floaters than you have, men in the
house after hours, and violations by
guests. A technical is the failure to
fill out sign-out slip correctly. A
lock-out is coming in after the
house has been closed without
signing out or coming in after the
time for which you have signed
out.
