Last year it was a squirrel, the
year before they had a kitten, but
this year the men of Toyon have
gone all out and adopted a—hum
mingbird.
The small size P-80 can be found
buzzing merrily around room 249.
But be careful when you go in, it
travels with the speed of light and
is apt to escape before you shut
the door.
The ounce of dynamite was found
Monday afternoon by John Figg-
Hoblyn on the porch in back of
Toyon. He was suffering from mal
nutrition, and was too weak to resist

the kind hands of its rescuer.
Removed to the comfort of room
1249, the infant bird was revived
with a jigger-full of sugar and water.
After a good night's rest, it had re
gained full health, and had already
I surveyed every inch of the room.
The future of the friendly hum
mingbird is bright. With 2GO proud
j fathers in Toyon, it should never
| suffer from starvation or lack of
| friendship.
Already it has begun to acquaint
! itsell with the human race, and John
Figg-Hoblyn has reported that it will
: lly fairly close to you, if you do
not move quickly and startle it.
