by Dr. Albert Schaeffer, .former
Stanford faculty member who is
now at Purdue. The prize is $100,
and each received this amount un
der the joint award.
They were honored for a book
thoy wrote on conformal mapping,
a highly technical mathematical
concept of which one application is
in computation of pressures in the
flow of air over an airplane wing.
