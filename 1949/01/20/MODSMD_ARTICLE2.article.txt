A general outline of the scope of
social service was presented at the
Vocom meeting last night by Mrs.
Ruth Lyons of the San Mateo
County Health and Welfare De
partment.
Mrs. Lyons described various
branches of social service, such as
medical, industrial, psychiatric, la
bor, overseas, and general work,
and told of increasing opportunities
in these fields.
"It is difficult to determine the
merits of a prospective social work
er; the best test is for the girl to
look into her heart," Mrs. Lyons
said.
Miss Ruth Terrel, '47, related her
duties as juvenile probation officer
lor Santa Clara County. Miss Ter
rel recommended that undergradu
ates interested in this field take
courses in sociology and psychol
ogy, as well as social servire.
The speakers were introduced by
Mrs. Elizabeth Doughty, former
member of the California Youth
Authority, who acted as moderator,
for the program.
In the discussion following the
speeches, it was suggested that so
cial workers obtain experience in
the field before continuing with ad
vanced academic training. Mrs. Al
ice Phillips Rose, graduate of the
New York School of Social Work,
stated that social workers must
have graduate work to obtain posi
tions in the Eastern states.
