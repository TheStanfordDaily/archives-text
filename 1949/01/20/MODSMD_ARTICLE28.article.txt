## Want to Transfer 
### 
An appropriate afterthought on The Daily's series of articles
on the Honor Code are these paragraphs from the Intercollegiate
Press Bulletin:
"Houston, Texasâ€”Regulations regarding cheating on exami
nations have been put into effect on the campus of the Univer
sity of Houston. President E. E. Oberholtzer recently instructed
faculty members, in a special bulletin, of the following new
procedure:
"Immediate dishonorable dismissal from the University for the
use of prepared cheating materials or for 'conspiring to use'
fcuch materials, and a grade of "F" on the course for a student ob
served in the act of 'spontaneous, unpremeditated cheating.'
"Each faculty member has been instructed to give clear warn
ing before tests and to maintain close scrutiny of students during
tests or examinations. Graders may assist the instructor in proc
toring groups of under 100, and an additional proctor will be on
hand for each additional 50 students or 'reasonable fraction
thereof.'
"Instructors are further asked to make every test compre
hensive in scope and to change tests from time to time, giving
ot least two different forms of a given test presented to more
than 50 at once."
Dean Kimpton commented, "This gives us something of an
idea, in my opinion, of the advantage we gain in the honor sys
tem. I do not expect any transfers from Stanford to the University
of Houston."
