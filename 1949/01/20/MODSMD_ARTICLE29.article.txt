# Excom Representation
## 
### 
Excom representation will be considered at an open hearing
on the new ASSU Constitution tonight at 7 in room 63 in the
Education Building.
At this time the proposal of combining the present system of
area representation with the former one of class representation
will be considered.
The reinstitution of class representation alone would bring
.back the weaknesses of that system. Under the former method
one special area often had a monopoly of the members of the
Excom, while others lacked it. Furthermore the area system pro
vides a direct channel from the students to their representatives
in that the area member has more contact with his constituents
Ihan the general class one.
However, the off-campus students probably deserve a greater
vote on the Excom.
In order that the best plan possible may be instituted it is im
portant that all students interested attend the meeting.
