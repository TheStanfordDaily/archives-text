# Open Hearing Tonight On Excom Membership
## 
### 
Excom representation will be discussed in the first of a series of open
hearings on proposed revision of the ASSU Constitution tonight at 7
in room 63, Cubberley Hall.
"We urge all students to participate in this open meeting and to
submit suggestions for discussion," said Mark Hatfield, chairman of the
ASSU Constitutional Revision Committee.
The committee has already found a possible solution in the combina
tion of area and class representation on the Executive Committee.
Areas similar to those in existence would be designated, each with one
representative. Other Excom members would be elected upon numerical
ratio basis from each class.
Further discussions in this series will consider problems of the judi
ciary council and election qualifications for ASSU candidates.
