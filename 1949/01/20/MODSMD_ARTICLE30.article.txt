Phi Kappa Sigma Was First
To the Editor:
On page 5 of the Monday, Jan. 17, edition of our pride and joy appears
an absolutely scandalous misrepresentation of fact.
I refer to the "Television" story under the by-line of A 1 McCombs.
Quoting this story:
"TV made its official Farm debut this month at the Chi Psi lodge . . . ."
Phi, excuse me, PHI KAPPA SIGMA's television set was delivered Dec.
13, and a congenial group viewed the first scheduled broadcast on the
Peninsula when we saw the East-West game here on New Year's Day.
And not only TV, but AM, FM, micro-groove, and regular recording,
to boot. Come up and see it sometime, if another condenser hasn't blown
out and the doggone thing is working.
You know how it is, gotta plug the dear old house.
