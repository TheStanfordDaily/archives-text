# Jap Election To Emphasize Rehabilitation
## 
### 
TOKYO, Jan. 15 (/P).—Millions of
still-bewildered ordinary Japanese
will vote Jan. 23 in a general elec
tion in which the occupation will be
the big—but disguised—issue.
The only issue of any importance
is the manner in which Japan shall
attempt to rehabilitate herself cco
nomicaHy.
The voters will be confined
largely to a choice between two ex
tremes — the conservatives and the
far left, both of which oppose
American plans for Japan's internal
economic stability.
The caliber of the men and wom
en elected to the 466-seat House of
Representatives will largely deter
mine whether occupation authori
ties are going to have to get tough
to make Japan help herself.
All but 40 members of the out
going lower house—where corrup
tion was widespread—are back on
the ballot. Both the conservatives
and the Communists have big slates.
The candidates will appeal to the
little man, who as everywhere only
wants to know how he can live
more cheaply and comfortably.
The new "austerity" program de
manded by the occupation to ease
the burden on the American tax
payers affects every group.
Politicians are attempting to cap
italize on American demands for
wage ceilings, better production,
government economy, and in
creased taxes to balance the budg
et.
The conservative politicians,
knowing this program is unpopular,
call for a return to free enterprise.
Leftists demand a "sock the rich"
program that would eliminate taxes
on workers and reduce those on
farmers.
Neither camp of politicians pays
more than vague lip service to the
American program.
Prime Minister Shigeru Yo.shida's
ultra-conservative Democratic Lib
eral party expects to pick up 50
seats for a total of 200. enough to
keep control with the help of the
Democratic party, also conservative.
The Communists are generally
conceded a chance to pick up six
seats for a total of 10.
