## European Impressions 
### 
"Air mail," I shouted at the clerk
in the Naples post office. "Par avion!
Aereo correo!" She regarded me in
utter bewilderment which increased
as I began flapping my arms up and
down illustratively.
I was about ready to give up and
let my epistle travel by stagecoach
when a voice behind me put in,
"Via aerea."
I turned gratefully to find a small,
middle-aged man. dressed neatly if
somewhat shabbily in the dark suit
which seemed characteristic of the
men in post-war Europe. Care had
eroded deep lines into his face, but
he smiled and said his name was
Armando Menella. As we left the
building Armando inquired, in ex
cellent English, if I lived anywhere
near San Francisco (I must have
; reeked of the Stars and Stripes; my
nationality was taken for granted).
When I replied in the affirmative,
| he asked me to please contact and
| deliver a message to a Captain
I Stanley Kelton, formerly with the
U.S. Army in Italy, and now re
[ siding in the Golden Gate city. He
I and the Menella family had become
close friends during the war.
"Just tell him," Armando mur
mured as I pulled a scrap of note
| paper from my purse, "that Biche
! and Videa are dead." My pencil
I stopped in mid-air. It took but one
look at his face, with its lowered
! gaze and drooping lips, to convince
! me that Biche and Videa had been
| very dear to him. As if reading my
thoughts he added. "My wife and
daughter."
How Did It Happen?
I didn't know what to do or say.
I had never experienced such trag
edy in my own life, and I felt small
j and inadequate before Armando's
j suffering. Finally 1 asked how it
j happened.
"A bomb."
"'An—an Allied bomb?"
''German." Somehow I was
j greatly relieved.
Over a dish of pizza, a concoc
tion of pie crust, olive oil, and to
matoes which I would gladly have
exchanged for a hamburger, Ar
mando told me of his pre-war po
| sition with the Naples branch of
Cook's Travel Agency. He had
j loved every minute of it, and had
j made good use of his fluency in
j French, Spanish, and English.
But the war had brought an end
to the tourist trade and also to

Armando's job. Now lie clerked at
a local bank, where he received
what were in pre-inflationary times
Rood wages. The work was dull and
dry, however, and far from satis
fied the esthetic temperament of a
man who knew all of Verdi's op
eras by heart.
He Needs Someone
"I would have committed suicide
after Biche and Videa went," Ar
mando's eyes recaptured the said
expression which haunted them ex
cept when he ate pizza or discussed
Italian opera," except for young
Mando. He needs someone to care
for him." Young Mando, his 15-
year-old son, apparently lived in an
adolescent world of his own, the
preoccupied father being unable to
penetrate it. At any event the two
were not close.
"I must get home now and cook
our dinner," my friend said. "We
usually have spaghetti because it
takes only a short time to prepare."
Ho paused, then asked, '"Won't you
come and meet Mando?" I nodded.
The Slum Section
Through the twisted Neapolitan
streets he guided me until we
reached the edge of the slum sec
tion. The odors of decaying gar
bage were pungent, and dirty, rag
ged children taunted each other in
the streets. We turned into the
courtyard ol a small apartment
building. Armando pointed to a
spot near the center of the patio.
"That is where the bomb struck my
daughter, and that" —he indicated
another spot—"is where Biche fell."
Again that awful inadequacy.
"Let's go find Mando," I said.
The Apartment
But Mando was not at home. The
apartment, though neat and roomy,
had a gray, empty look and lacked
the warmth of womanish touches.
Like the Menella family, it had seen
happier days—days which, accord
ing to Armando, had filled it with
love, laughter, gaiety, music, and
friends to share these bounties.
With pathetic eagerness lie showed
me where the piano had been when
Biche was alive. I left then, unable
to wait for young Mando's return.
Of the many people who have
visited Naples, some will remem
ber its blue skies: others, its appal
ling slums; and still others, the way
the water sparkles in the sunlight
in its crescent-shaped harbor. But
I will remember Armando Menella.

cept when he ate pizza or discussed
Italian opera," except for young
Mando. He needs someone to care
for him." Young Mando, his 15-
year-old son, apparently lived in an
adolescent world of his own, the
preoccupied father being unable to
penetrate it. At any event the two
were not close.
"I must get home now and cook
our dinner," my friend said. "We
usually have spaghetti because it
takes only a short time to prepare."
Ho paused, then asked, '"Won't you
come and meet Mando?" I nodded.
The Slum Section
Through the twisted Neapolitan
streets he guided me until we
reached the edge of the slum sec
tion. The odors of decaying gar
bage were pungent, and dirty, rag
ged children taunted each other in
the streets. We turned into the
courtyard ol a small apartment
building. Armando pointed to a
spot near the center of the patio.
"That is where the bomb struck my
daughter, and that" —he indicated
another spot—"is where Biche fell."
Again that awful inadequacy.
"Let's go find Mando," I said.
The Apartment
But Mando was not at home. The
apartment, though neat and roomy,
had a gray, empty look and lacked
the warmth of womanish touches.
Like the Menella family, it had seen
happier days—days which, accord
ing to Armando, had filled it with
love, laughter, gaiety, music, and
friends to share these bounties.
With pathetic eagerness lie showed
me where the piano had been when
Biche was alive. I left then, unable
to wait for young Mando's return.
Of the many people who have
visited Naples, some will remem
ber its blue skies: others, its appal
ling slums; and still others, the way
the water sparkles in the sunlight
in its crescent-shaped harbor. But
I will remember Armando Menella.
"Air mail," I shouted at the clerk
in the Naples post office. "Par avion!
Aereo correo!" She regarded me in
utter bewilderment which increased
as I began flapping my arms up and
down illustratively.
I was about ready to give up and
let my epistle travel by stagecoach
when a voice behind me put in,
"Via aerea."
I turned gratefully to find a small,
middle-aged man. dressed neatly if
somewhat shabbily in the dark suit
which seemed characteristic of the
men in post-war Europe. Care had
eroded deep lines into his face, but
he smiled and said his name was
Armando Menella. As we left the
building Armando inquired, in ex
cellent English, if I lived anywhere
near San Francisco (I must have
; reeked of the Stars and Stripes; my
nationality was taken for granted).
When I replied in the affirmative,
| he asked me to please contact and
| deliver a message to a Captain
I Stanley Kelton, formerly with the
U.S. Army in Italy, and now re
[ siding in the Golden Gate city. He
I and the Menella family had become
close friends during the war.
"Just tell him," Armando mur
mured as I pulled a scrap of note
| paper from my purse, "that Biche
! and Videa are dead." My pencil
I stopped in mid-air. It took but one
look at his face, with its lowered
! gaze and drooping lips, to convince
! me that Biche and Videa had been
| very dear to him. As if reading my
thoughts he added. "My wife and
daughter."
How Did It Happen?
I didn't know what to do or say.
I had never experienced such trag
edy in my own life, and I felt small
j and inadequate before Armando's
j suffering. Finally 1 asked how it
j happened.
"A bomb."
"'An—an Allied bomb?"
''German." Somehow I was
j greatly relieved.
Over a dish of pizza, a concoc
tion of pie crust, olive oil, and to
matoes which I would gladly have
exchanged for a hamburger, Ar
mando told me of his pre-war po
| sition with the Naples branch of
Cook's Travel Agency. He had
j loved every minute of it, and had
j made good use of his fluency in
j French, Spanish, and English.
But the war had brought an end
to the tourist trade and also to

Armando's job. Now lie clerked at
a local bank, where he received
what were in pre-inflationary times
Rood wages. The work was dull and
dry, however, and far from satis
fied the esthetic temperament of a
man who knew all of Verdi's op
eras by heart.
He Needs Someone
"I would have committed suicide
after Biche and Videa went," Ar
mando's eyes recaptured the said

I and the Menella family had become

"Just tell him," Armando mur
mured as I pulled a scrap of note
| paper from my purse, "that Biche
! and Videa are dead." My pencil
I stopped in mid-air. It took but one
look at his face, with its lowered
! gaze and drooping lips, to convince
! me that Biche and Videa had been
| very dear to him. As if reading my
thoughts he added. "My wife and
daughter."
How Did It Happen?
I didn't know what to do or say.
I had never experienced such trag
edy in my own life, and I felt small
j and inadequate before Armando's
j suffering. Finally 1 asked how it
j happened.
"A bomb."
"'An—an Allied bomb?"
''German." Somehow I was
j greatly relieved.
Over a dish of pizza, a concoc
tion of pie crust, olive oil, and to
matoes which I would gladly have
exchanged for a hamburger, Ar
mando told me of his pre-war po
| sition with the Naples branch of
Cook's Travel Agency. He had
j loved every minute of it, and had
j made good use of his fluency in
j French, Spanish, and English.
But the war had brought an end
to the tourist trade and also to

Armando's job. Now lie clerked at
a local bank, where he received
what were in pre-inflationary times
Rood wages. The work was dull and
dry, however, and far from satis
fied the esthetic temperament of a
man who knew all of Verdi's op
eras by heart.
He Needs Someone
"I would have committed suicide
after Biche and Videa went," Ar
mando's eyes recaptured the said
expression which haunted them ex
cept when he ate pizza or discussed
Italian opera," except for young
Mando. He needs someone to care
for him." Young Mando, his 15-
year-old son, apparently lived in an
adolescent world of his own, the
preoccupied father being unable to
penetrate it. At any event the two
were not close.
"I must get home now and cook
our dinner," my friend said. "We
usually have spaghetti because it
takes only a short time to prepare."
Ho paused, then asked, '"Won't you
come and meet Mando?" I nodded.
The Slum Section
Through the twisted Neapolitan
streets he guided me until we
reached the edge of the slum sec
tion. The odors of decaying gar
bage were pungent, and dirty, rag
ged children taunted each other in
the streets. We turned into the
courtyard ol a small apartment
building. Armando pointed to a
spot near the center of the patio.
"That is where the bomb struck my
daughter, and that" —he indicated
another spot—"is where Biche fell."
Again that awful inadequacy.
"Let's go find Mando," I said.
The Apartment
But Mando was not at home. The
apartment, though neat and roomy,
had a gray, empty look and lacked
the warmth of womanish touches.
Like the Menella family, it had seen
happier days—days which, accord
ing to Armando, had filled it with
love, laughter, gaiety, music, and
friends to share these bounties.
With pathetic eagerness lie showed
me where the piano had been when
Biche was alive. I left then, unable
to wait for young Mando's return.
Of the many people who have
visited Naples, some will remem
ber its blue skies: others, its appal
ling slums; and still others, the way
the water sparkles in the sunlight
in its crescent-shaped harbor. But
I will remember Armando Menella.
"Air mail," I shouted at the clerk
in the Naples post office. "Par avion!
Aereo correo!" She regarded me in
utter bewilderment which increased
as I began flapping my arms up and
down illustratively.
I was about ready to give up and
let my epistle travel by stagecoach
when a voice behind me put in,
"Via aerea."
I turned gratefully to find a small,
middle-aged man. dressed neatly if
somewhat shabbily in the dark suit
which seemed characteristic of the
men in post-war Europe. Care had
eroded deep lines into his face, but
he smiled and said his name was
Armando Menella. As we left the
building Armando inquired, in ex
cellent English, if I lived anywhere
near San Francisco (I must have
; reeked of the Stars and Stripes; my
nationality was taken for granted).
When I replied in the affirmative,
| he asked me to please contact and
| deliver a message to a Captain
I Stanley Kelton, formerly with the
U.S. Army in Italy, and now re
[ siding in the Golden Gate city. He
I and the Menella family had become
