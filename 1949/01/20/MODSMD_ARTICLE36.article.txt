## 
### AL BERRY 
"The King's Jester," currently showing at the Guild, is the kind
112 a motion picture Hollywood could make if Hollywood were as
ood as Hollywood says Hollywood is. Well, Hollywood isn't,
nd the Italians have put forth their most magnificent achieve
ment to prove that sad fact.
"lester" is the story of Rigoletto, buffoon of the somewhat over-

•xed Francis I of 16th century
ranee. Michel Simon, as the hunch-
K-k jester, turns in a performance

large extent, Simon's powerful
laraclerization that makes "The
ing's Jester" Italy's finest film to

Shoe Shine" as well as V. Ro
ance's scintillating "Carmen."

lot. It is rather harmonized into
magnificent background. And, un

King Meets Blonde
Now, about that sex. It comes

In the carefree pursuit of these

nqualifiedly successful. The con
