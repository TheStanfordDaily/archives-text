CHICAGO. Jan. 19 (/P). — Amid |
conflicting rumors which indicated i
"hat ownership of the Los Angeles
Dons and the Chicago Rockets
night change hands, the AH-Amer
ica Football Conference today de-|
cided to continue its box-office war !
•vith the rival National Football |
League next season.
Reports which could not be con- j
irmed had Ben F. Lindheimer, j
chairman of the AAC executive!
board, ready to sel! his interests in
the Los Angeles Dons in order to j
buy the Chicago Rockets, who won ;
only one out of 14 league games last i
season.
This rumor followed an earlier j
terse statement issued by Lindhei- i
ner after an executive session of \
the eight club owners that:
rhe All - America Conference
A'ill continue."
Lindheimer indicated that it will j
be decided at another executive |
session tomorrow whether the 1
league will operate with six or eight '
clubs.
"Sometime tomorrow afternoon,"
Lindheimer said, "I hope to have a
statement that will set everything
right."
Lindheimer's brief declaration of j
confidence left unexplained how the
All - America financial flops — the ;
Chicago Rockets and the Brooklyn ;
Dodgers—could dig up cash for a
3949 campaign.
Since the National loop admitted
v would accept only Cleveland and j

San Francisco as merger clubs, the
AAC was faced with the problem of
either disbanding or making every
effort to get all eight members in
line for a fourth season.
San Francisco, for one, refused to
join a six-club All-America Con
ference for 1949.
The All-America's determination
to carry on left four big league pro
terms, the most ever, in the New
York area. The National's Boston
Yanks, who will move to New York
next season, now must share the
Polo Grounds with the football
Giants.
