## MIDWEEK NOTES Card-Don Contest Tops Coast Play 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Mid-week reflections on the local
cage situation:
Friday night's contest against our
San Francisco cousins is creating
what at first glance appears to be
undue excitement over a non-con
ference battle. But when national
hoop statisticians review the sea
son s records come the ides of
March, this weekend's melee might
easily r; le as the most important
game on the coast in 1949. . .
McNamee Scores ."{S
Whip Lewis and Marv Gelber,
Card defensive whizzes, are slated
lor major roles in the Pavilion
drama. Best example of the impor
tance of defense against the Ilill
toppers: Joe McNamee's record 38-
pount outburst against Santa Clara
at the Cow Palace. . . .
Fight now, the Hilltoppers un
questionably deserve top ranking of
Pacific Coast court squads. They've
won 14 and lost one to date, and
their victims include a number of
the better outfits from over the
country. . . .
What About Yardley's Knee?
One big question-mark, as usual,
will be George Yardley's trouble
some knee. But Jumpin' Jorge
turned in two mighty creditable
performances under the boards
against Cal, and chances are he'll
prove plenty bothersome to the
USFers, knee or no knee. . . .
Never saw a man as unwilling to
be stopped as Dave Davidson last
Saturday night. Driving in for those
lay-ins, he looked like Jensen go
ing through center. . . .
Can't help but hope that the
powers-that-be haven't oversold the
band-box Pavilion again this week
end. My view of the Cal game was
pretty good, but that rafter wasn't
very comfortable.
