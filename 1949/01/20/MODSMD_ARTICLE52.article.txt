The coaches are playing the old shell game again and this year thev'
turned up a good crop of suckers. They're all winning in their ar»nu
game ol now-you-see-it, now-you-don't with the tight-fisted athlet
dn ectors and boards of athletic control.
The secret is that there are a lot of good football coaching jobs st
open and it seems that none of the top-flight mentors are interested
filling them The result being that some of the more enterprising coach
are demanding, and getting, more money at home under the threat
moving elsewhere.
As is the custom every year about this time, many of the natioi
leading grid coaches become "dissatisfied" with their present po-itio
and begin to look for greener pastures. A few of the maltreated pigsk
mentors are seriously interested in new positions, but most of them arer
lhey never had it so good, and know it.
Coaches Use Openings to Gel More Dough
But football coaching being the hazardous occupation that it is coach
are constantly working to get bigger and better contracts where thev ai
and making eyes at other jobs has proven to be about the most effecti
way of doing it.
That's why the big names in the football world are always bandi
around the sports pages every time there's an opening at Flatbush Sta
Usually theres never any attempt made to deny the rumors until alt
the local athletic council has gone into "closed session "
In any case, the coach can't lose. If the directors become jealous a
loosen the purse strings, then he wins. If they don't go for the bait a
the coach cant better himself elsewhere, then there's always the heai
warming angle about not wanting to move because of the long-standi
ties, the climate, etc.
To name several concrete examples there's the case of Jim Aik
at the University of Oregon. For several weeks Coach Jim entertain
juniors that he would move to Nebraska next year, with the result tl
he was finally 'convinced'' to stay at Eugene with a new. long-term co
tract providing lor a $1,500 a year salary boost.
Now rough 'n' ready Jim has done a good job at Oregon despite
his shady tactics, and probably was in line for a pay raise anyway. E
its a cinch the threat didn't slow up the process any.
Joe Stays Home for $12,000
Then there is Joe Sheeketski, the Nevada coach, who recently .sign
" J IC>W , ,) ~ year contract. Sheeketski had been on the listening end of
offers before finally inking at home for $12,000 a season.
Sugar Bowl winner Bud Wilkinson "considered" Harry Stuhldrehe
V£rJ!n h !!! d J COaC , h at Wisconsin just long enough to get three ye;
and M,OOO added to his contract at Oklahoma U.
And to name these three just scratches the surface. There are undoul
edly many others who wheedled raises in the same way.
In the meantime the vacant coaching jobs go begging. The athletic <
rectors aren t taking all comers and the big names aren't having any.
At Nebraska Potsy Clark has all but given up trying to get a coa
with a proven big league record, and the Wisconsin athletic direct,
don t quite know which way to go after being turned down by Wilkinsc
down at Westwood where they were supposedly going all out
get a name coach, the field has been narrowed to six men with so
records. Before Laßrucherie quit, the Los Angeles papers had P;
Brown ol Cleveland all set as the head coach at UCLA, but now t
Browns, Blaiks, Crislers, Leahys, and Biermans have long since be
lorgotten.

Norm's Signed, Sealed, Bui Not Delivered
Up at Eugene ace passer Norm Van Brocklin insists that he is seal
and delivered but not signed to play for the Los Angeles Rams of t
National Football League next fall.
Van Brocklin, who has another year of college eligibility left s;
that he has committed himself to the Rams "in everything except writ in
It was reported that Norm would stay on through another footb
season at Oregon if Jim Aiken would stay as head coach. Now it see
the whole deal is off.
Could be there was a little friction between Aiken and Van Brock
over the Cotton Bowl fiasco. After the game Aiken was quoted as savi
that he thought Van was going pro and that he didn't think there v
anything that could be done about it.
"I believe he was spending some of that pro money around Dalla
Coach Aiken added.
Van Brocklin flatly denies this somewhat surprising accusation.
Van Brocklin expressed no interest in the All-America Football Con It
ence and was not even sure which team had drafted him. He like m
of the other college stars to graduate to the play for pay ranks in t
last two years, think the All-America Conference is a goner, and prcf.
