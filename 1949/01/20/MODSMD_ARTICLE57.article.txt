# North Carolina Notre Dame Gridders to Play in New York
## 
### 
4EW YORK, Jan. 19 (/P). — We
/en't heard anything about Dart
uth meeting Mississippi in a
tba'l game at Portland, Ore., but
•h an arrangement wouldn't sur
se us too much. College cam
-;es cover an amazing lot of terri
y.
"or instance, Notre Dame and
rth Carolina are going to meet
:t fall. It might be expected such
ont*. t would be staged at South
ail or Chapel Hill for the benefit
one of the student bodies, as,
er all. college football is a game
and for the undergraduates.
>o it follows that New York City,
ere the game will be piayed,
st be a coiner of the Notre Dame
npus—a sort of Observatory Hill
ybe. Or it might be the north '
tioii of the University of North
olina's grounds.
Ve are not bemoaning the fact
t the game will be played here,
ierstand. We're quite unselfish I
1 broadminded about it. Natu- I
ly we're not influenced by the ;
t that we might get to see it. Not j
ch, anyway.
kit it does seem that the two
ools are stretching out their j
•ks just a little bit at a time when j
ch criticism is aimed at college
thai! as being over-commercial -
1. The race for the bowl game
lars and the general big-busi
atmosphere surrounding an
ateur sport have brought many
worried frown to the brows of
rts purists.
blue-nosed guys will want
know why, if money isn't a fac
, the Cr"^ 0 wasn't scheduled fnr
home field of one of the insti
iojis.
'he rebuttal to that probably
uld be the statement that both
ools have vast alumni groups
e, and it seemed only right that j
-c loyal former inmates have I
ir chance to see the teams in ,
ion.
ames have been played on neu
grounds before, but, aside from
vl tiii'ics. we can't recall two
n> traveling so far to meet out

of sight of the home folks. Such J
games away from a campus usually j
are in a nearby city where more !
home folks can see them.
Army and Navy met in Chicago,
but Army and Navy are in a cate- '
gory all their own. Thev are schools |
belonging to the United States, with j
the whole country their campus.
For years Army and Notre Dame
met in New York City, and Army
sti'l plays a game here every year. ,
But it is close enough to West Point
to be considered practically a home
field for the Cadets.
. We don't know how the student j
bodies of Notre Dame and North
Carolina feel about the game. Quite .
a number of the students will at
tend. They'll hitch-hike and form
car pools and ride the rods if nec
essary. But there will be many j
more who won't be able to make it.
Anyway, the student bodies can
be here in spirit, if not in body.
