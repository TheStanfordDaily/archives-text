### JOHN HALL 
Santa Clara's basketball-playing I
â–  Broncos, pushecl into the back
ground by USF's glamour boys, will '
meet Stanford Saturday night at 8 1
p.m. in the Pavilion.
So far all eyes have been focused
jon San Francisco's hotcha Dons j
who will take over the Pavilion to- I
j morrow night to clash with the In
dians for the mythical cage cham
j pionship of the coast.
But the Santa Clara - Stanford I
I game has some selling points in its
own right. Of course, it really ,
; doesn't need to be sold, as all tick- '
| ets have already bitten the dust.
However, for the benefit of those !
j who grabbed off the few available

There will be a meeting of all
intramural managers Friday at
5:30 in room 41 of SAC. Freshman
eligibility rules will he discussed.
The Sigma Nu 11 team has been
added to League l>. All teams in 1
this league are ad\ ised to make
certain they add this team to
j their schedules.
All managers are requested to
check their schedules at the in- 1
tfamilial office.

\ ducats and will be present to see
the second Santa Clara - Stanford
contest of the season, here's the
dope.
Broncos Don't Have It
i The Broncos, who practice the
i science of bounce some 15 miles
south of Palo Alto, are cursed at
the present time with one of their
\ worst cage squads in history. And
vet, as always is the case. Santa
! Clara gets tough against Stanford.
In the first meeting between the
j two clubs, the Indians had to fall
J back on a last-second hook-shot by
, Bill Stephenson to pull a lucky win
1 out of the fire. 49 to 47.
The Bronocs have lost to just

about every team on the coast, in
cluding California, St. Mary's, UC
LA, and San Francisco. The Dons
have polished them off twice b>
scores ot 49 to 43 and 51 to 44.
Greenbach Leads Team
Led by a smooth-working guard
Joe Greenbach, who looks like
young Abe Lincoln and therefore
should be five greenbacks, Sants
Clara's only trouble comes from not
being able to hit the hcop consist
ently.
Santa Clara actually does have c>
pretty fair defensive unit in its
starting team, nanie'y Bob McKil
lop and Bill Sunderland at tor
wards, Bud Stein at center, and Jot
Greenbach and Jerry Crawley at
guards.
But whether they will be able tc
hold together throughout Saturday
night's game is a big question.
Pavilion News Slow
Meanwhile, down at the Pavilion
things weren't going too well yes
terday afternoon. George Yard'.ev
and Milt Iverson, bothered by bad
colds, were able only to go through
light di ills. Yardley is fast becoming
Stanford's hard-luck kid.
With the pressure on concerning
the pending battle with USF, Ev
erett Dean is being kept busy try
ing to cook up an adequate defense
for Joe McNamee and Don Lofgran,
the two six-foot six-inch scoring
geniuses.
Bob Whip Lewis will get the job
of handling Don Lofgran. while Bii 1
Stephenson will play opposite Mc-
Namee. For the other boys, it does
n't matter so much.
