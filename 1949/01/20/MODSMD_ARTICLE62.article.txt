# Co-op Auto Club Formed; Offers Rate to Members
## 
### 
Gordon Ness, Stanford journalism student, has organized a
club which should go a long way toward curing the financial
headaches of student car owners. It's the Co-op Auto Club, an
organization designed to save its members money on automotive
supplies and services.
Already in operation on the Stanford campus, CAC branches

are being formed in seven other col
lege communities on the Pacific
Coast. Membership cards are good
at any CAC station, so club members
may enjoy its privileges at any CAC
town on the Coast.
Combats High Costs
The CAC combats the high cost
of operating a car by offering its
members substantial reduction on
many items. Here are the discounts
which the $2 membership fee brings:
Lubrication jobs—4o per cent off.
Motor repair labor, including body,
fender, and paint work—2o per cent.
Motor parts and batteries—2o per
ccnt off.
Accessories, including tires—ls per
ccnt off.
Oil—s cents off per quart.
Gasoline—2 cents off per gallon.
A Single Garage
Only one garage and one major
brand gasoline station ,are main
tained in each college town, so these
establishments are assured of a
high volume of business. Everybody
wins, according to Ness, students and
garage owners alike. The Palo Alto
member stations are Boaz Richfield
and Cardinal Motors.
Club membership at Stanford is
limited to 1,500 —about half the
number of student cars on the cam
pus. Quotas set for other schools
are:
University of California, USC, and
UCLA—2,SOO each; University of
Washington—2,ooo. Figures have not
yet been set for the other member
schools, the University of Oregon,
Oregon State College, and San Jose
State College.
Non-Profit Firm
The CAC is organized under Cali
fornia state laws as a non-profit or
ganization. It is not limited to stu
dent members, but Ness says that
he expects the colleges and univer
sities to supply nearly all the mem
bers.
Ness got the idea of organizing an
automobile cooperative during fall
quarter. He decided to stay out of
school this quarter to get the CAC
off to a good start, but he plans to
return to Stanford in April.


GORDON NESS, above, has .iuxt
started a new co-operative auto
club in various Pacific Coast col
lege communities to enable stu
dents to receive cheaper automo
tive services.
