### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (/Pi.â€”
The United States gave a powerful
helping hand to the government of
Israel tonight by granting it $100.-
000.000 in loans needed to develop
the Jewish state.
The Export - Import Bank made
$35,000,000 available for immediate
use and earmarked 5G5.000.000 more
for the Israeli government to spend
before Dec. 31.
The action was intended to serve
as a concrete demonstration to the
world that the American govern
ment believes that the Israeli na
tion is here to stay.
The credits were announced a
few hours after Acting Secretary of
State Lovett said the United States
and Britain were trying to hammer
out a common approach to the Pal
estine problem.
The loans came as Jews and
Egyptians negotiated on the island
of Rhodes for a truce to the Pales
tine fighting. They are the first
credits the new Israel government
has been able to obtain from any
foreign government since it pro
claimed its independence last May.
Jewish sources greeted the an
nouncement joyfully for it gave
promise of inducing many countries
to grant full diplomatic recognition
to Israel.
Government officials said the
granting of the loans might have
these results:
1. Strengthen the hand of the
present ruling regime in Israel, the
Conservative Socialist party head
ed by David Ben-Gurion, prior to
the Jan. 25 elections.
2. Help the truce negotiations be
tween Jews and Arabs by showing
the Arabs the American govern
ment does not intend to abandon
its long-standing support of Israel.
3. Possibly persuade the British
to review their Palestine policy with
a view to granting recognition to
the Israel government.
At his news conference. Lovett
emphatically denied a report from
a British government source in Lon
don that the British had ottered to
end their diplomatic boycott of Is
rael if the United States would con
sent to join in a British plan for
guaranteeing peace in the Middle
East,
