# Change in SP Train Schedule Gives Commuters Extra Hour
## 
### TREV BURROW 
Stanford students with 8 and 9 a.m. classes, who commute
from the Bay Area and Northern Peninsula by train, can now
spend an extra hour in bed every morning.
After some effective lobbying by Dick Alberton, grad law
student, Southern Pacific took notice of the plight of commuting

students when they considered mak
ing a change in train schedules.
As a result, students no longer
need to catch a 6 a.m. train from
San Francisco in order to attend 8
o'clock classes. The train which for
merly left San Francisco at 7 a.m.
will now leave at 6:50, and is to
arrive in Palo Alto at 7:52.
Alberton also made arrangements
with W. B. Prine, general manager
of the Palo Alto City lines, to have
a bus meet the 7:52 train. This serv
ice should get students to their 8
o'clocks with a few minutes to spare.
Those students who have been
taking the train which leaves San
Francisco at 7 a.m.. in order to ar
rive for 9 a.m. classes, can now catch
the train leaving at 7:35. This train
connects with the Daylight in San
Jose, and arrives at Palo Alto at 8:20.
Alpha Phi Omega, service fra
ternity, is compiling a list of com
muting students who desire to form
car pools or share-the-ride groups.
Jack Robinson, president of the fra
ternity, said yesterday the file will
be complete and ready for use early
next week.
