# Busy Village Wives Preserve Morale, Budgets, and Normalcy
## 
### TOM WIEDER 
A group to be reckoned with at
the Village is the Married Students'
Family Council. It is composed of
iiO young wives of Village men,
who are determined to keep things
;.s normal as possible in the slightly
abnormal atmosphere of the Vil
lage.
The housing unit elects a woman
representative each quarter who at
tends the meetings which are held
every three weeks. These sessions
deal with domestic affairs, how to
keep the kiddies out of trouble,
movies, entertainment, and so forth.
The Council is headed by Ruth
Whalen.
The Apartment Policy Committee
has been formed as a sub-group to
enforce the point system, upon
which hinges the vital question of
â€¢who gets into the precious living
space for married people. Its pur
pose is to invalidate the charges of
I ivoriti.sm that have been tossed at
the housing authorities on various
occasions.
Movies Shown
Movies for children and adults at
the Village are being worked on as
access has been obtained to a pro
jector and foreign and Army films.
Programs with cartoons, Westerns,
and the like will be held on Sat
urday mornings; adults will attend
on Friday and Saturday nights.
About 50 have attended the sew

ing classes. Classes for beginners
are given on Wednesdays and for
(he advanced on Thursdays. The
Village has four machines which are
accessible to anyone during the day.
The problem of keeping the chil
dren in clothes as they grow out of
them is partly solved by the "Baby
Wardrobe." The Stanford Mothers'
Club has collected all types and
sizes of clothes, some of which have
been taken over by the students
who have trouble rounding out the
GI paychecks to the end of the
month.
Tea Scheduled
The Mothers' Club has alio col
lected a stack of baby furniture
such as bassinettes, layettes, and
oilier devices to keep the infants in
a civilized condition. The Mothers
keep the older children (it to live
with by helping out at children's
parties; at Christmas they collected
many toys which were distributed
as presents.
The Council has tentatively
scheduled a tea at the Village Club
house on Feb. 21 to honor the Moth
ers' Club.
