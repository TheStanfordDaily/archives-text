# SIRO to Assist Berlin University
## 
### 
SIRO wil! collect clothes, books,
and food for the Free University of
Berlin from today until Feb. 15. I
The February deadline has been
set in order that the *heavy winter
clothing collected may be sent, to i
Germany while it is still of use to
the students.
The Free University was estab- 1
lished in the American zone of Ber
lin in opposition to the old Univer- !
sity ol Berlin, now controlled by
the Russians.
About 30 per cent or 500 of the
students at the new university are
relugees, most of them political ref
ugees from the Eastern zone and
the old university. These students
especially need clothing, for they*
were able to bring very few of their
belongings with them.
Books are needed too. Because of
the blockade, the selling of books,
paper, and other materials is pro
hibited. Those to be had are of
fered at fantastic prices.
A student at the university said
in a recent letter to a friend in the
United States, "We had to leave all
the material, all the important and
precious books in the old univer
sity; and it is impossible to build up
a new library in a short time when
you can t j*et the books, and when
vou are so short of inoney as Ber
'in is now."
Collection boxes have been dis
tributed to most of the living groups
on campus.
