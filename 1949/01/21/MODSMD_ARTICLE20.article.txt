## Feudal Backwash 
### 
Back in 1932 the Hearst newspaper chain started a feud with
Stanford over one of the University's professors. The chain's
head man wanted the professor discharged from the academic
staff. Stanford refused. Then the feud entered its final stage.
All Hearst papers were ordered never to mention Stanford's name
in any issue.
The feud turned into a comedy when Hearst sports writers
were forced to dig up Stanford synonymsâ€”the Farm, game at
the Stadium south of Palo Alto, the school at Palo Alto, and so on.
When the feud backfired the campaign was called off.
Since 1932 relations with Hearst newspapers have been peace
ful. A few exceptions to the status quo, however, developed here
and there. One of these deviations occurred in the Jan. 9, 1949,
American Weekly Sunday magazine supplement published by
the Hearst chain. *
The story in question concerned Communist activity in Ameri
can schools. One paragraph listed the "Pacific Northwest Labor
School in Seattle and the California Labor School in San Francisco
(with annexes in Los Angeles, Oakland, and Palo Alto, the home
of Leland Stanford Jr. University)" as all-out Communist schools
as reported by the un-American Activities Committee.
Writer Warren Hall's story seemed to be accurate except for
the above paragraph. But his irrelevant, damaging, and distaste
ful association of Stanford with Communist schools nullifies the
potential effect of the article on readers familiar with Stanford
or on readers living in the Bay Area.
Last year the California Labor School's education director (a
Palo Alto resident) handled extension courses in Palo Alto. A
plan to start a Labor School annex in the town evidently was
dropped during the year.
Associating Stanford with an accused Communist school was
a slur; the reference was not constructive in its inference. But
the remark does bring back memories of the era of the Great
Feud, and the recent American Weekly story is an example of
the 1932 hangover.
