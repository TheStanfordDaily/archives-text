## Bring Back Dailey to the Daily 
### 
To the Editor:
What the hell has happened to Bill Dailey? His Bull Session was price
less. It was the best thing in the paper, and the thing everybody read.
Get him back to write it. If he's having trouble with school work, tell
his professors to lay off. This is more important—the morale of Stanford
is involved, and even at stake!

(Kd. Note: Reader PfeilTer's letter was interesting on the outside, too,
being sealed with wax and bearing the family coat of arms.)
