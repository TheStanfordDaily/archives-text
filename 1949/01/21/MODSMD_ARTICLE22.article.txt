# Bill Warren Explains
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Wednesday's Daily quoted me as saying that the Breakers Eating Club
was full and closed to new members. Since this is a direct quote. I must
have said it; or does The Daily make a practice of putting quotes around
anything they feel needs authority?
As I remember it. I said, "All the clubs but Breakers will be repre
sented." I don't remember giving any reason. The clubs can conduct
their rushing by any means they see fit, and Breakers chooses to acquire
its members on a more informal basis.
BILL WARREN.
President of Inter-Club Council
