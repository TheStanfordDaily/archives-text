PSYCHOLOGIST UN RETIRED l>> I
Miriam Allan deFord (Stanford
University Press)
For psycho'ogy students, this
book should prove interesting. It is
the story of the long and useful
career of Dr. Lillien J. Martin, one
of the founders of Stanford's psy
chology department. Not only was
the indefatigable Dr. Martin a pro
fessor of psychology here for many
years, but she continued working as
a consulting psychologist long after
her retirement, and almost up to
her death at the remarkable age
of 91.
Toward the end of her life she
devoted much of her time to the
hitherto neglec ted field of geriatrics, j
that is the study of the problems of j
the aged. Freed of academic respon
sibi'ity at the tender age of GO. the
unselfish and sympathetic Dr. Mar
tin worked hard to begin the Old
Age Counseling Center in San Fran
cisco, spending about 23 years
working there.
The work which she began has at
last been brought to the attention
of psychologists of the present day.
Both the accomplishments of her
life and the astounding vitality of
Dr. Martin are but surface indica
tions of the true personality of this
remarkable woman. Her life pat
tern, as sympathetically described
by Miriam Allen deFord, was in
tended to set a fine example for
those who may someday follow in
her footsteps.
