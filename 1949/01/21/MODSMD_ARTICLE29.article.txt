WASHINGTON —The Air Force
has a camera it says will take pic
tures from a plane flying 1,000 miles
an hour—when and if planes go
that fast.
It also has a new night camera,
tripped automatically by the light
of magnesium flares. Electronic
gadgets prevent tripping by gun
flashes or searchlights.
Air Force picture hounds also are
toying with the idea of a portable
darkroom to be carried in a "cap
sule" and set down in a remote spot.
