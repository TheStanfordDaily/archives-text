LeVino, in cooperation with Inter
fraternity Council, has moderated
this year's rushing program.
He said that, officially, formal
rushing does not end till tomorrow
morning at 10. and that men may be
i rushed till that hour. Men who
! break their pledges after signing
j cards are subject to six months' in
i eligibility as fraternity candidates.
Fraternities, on the other hand,
may break pledges any time before
initiation of their candidates.
LeVino said that this year's pref
erence dinner will not hold the sig
j nificance of those held in previous
j years. "In days past," he commented,
j ''the preference dinner was one of
a limited number of meals. This
| year, because of the unlimited num
; ber of open meals allowed, many of
i the houses have their pledge classes
already assembled, the 'preference'
j of their men already having been
j established."
