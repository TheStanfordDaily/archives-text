BELFAST â€” Northern Ireland
general elections, expected in Feb
ruary, probably wil! be postponed
until May.
Northern Irish leaders have just
finished talks with the British cab
inet on mutual problems and on
whether to change the country's
name to Ulster. They got a sympa
thetic reception but can't talk pub
licly yet about results.
They think that if they called
e'ections next month the voters
might suspect relations with Britain
were crumbling and defeat the Un
ionist government.
