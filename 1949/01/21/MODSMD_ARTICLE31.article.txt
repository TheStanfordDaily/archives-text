Queen quest ....
He put his arms around her and whispered in her ear.
She listened and then nodded—he gently drew her near.
Then he lightly kissed her, and talked in quiet tone.
The girlie was his sister; he had asked her for a loan.

Who comforts me in moments of despair?
Who runs fingers lightly through my hair?
Who cooks my meals and darns my hose?
Squeezes nose drops in my nose?
Who always has a word of praise?
Sets out my rubbers on rainy days?
Who scrubs my back when in the shower?
And wakes me at the proper hour?
Who helps to keep me on the beam?
And figures in my every dream?
I do!

Last night I held a lovely hand ....
A hand so pretty and neat;
I thought my heart would burst with joy,
So wildly did it beat.
No other hand unto my heart
Could greater solace bring.
Than the dear hand I held last night—
Four aces and a king.
Well, whadja expect?

"Ah. I have you whipped," he cried. His huge arms lashed out again
■ and again. Gradually the pile grew—one, two, three, four—all piled
j neatly on top of one another.
"Get the knave," someone behind him hissed, and he grabbed it —all
his 195 pounds of muscle behind the movement. The club rose, then fell.
; He turned then with a triumphant though weary smile. He had won.
It was his second win over Old Sol in a week. He gathered up the cards
I and began shuffling once more.

Lost Weekend ....
It came upon us slowly, the dim awareness of the thing. Persistently,
pounding, grating into our nerves, bringing the full realization of the
awful thing home to us. There it was. right across the room from us. We
tried to shake it off, to discard it as another bad dream. But it persisted—
pounding, pounding! It was driving us trad!
Finally, with a heavy effort, we leaped at it across the room, smashed
i our fist at the place where it seemed to be coming from—and shut off that
i damn alarm.

"Ah. I have you whipped," he cried. His huge arms lashed out again
■ and again. Gradually the pile grew—one, two, three, four—all piled
j neatly on top of one another.
"Get the knave," someone behind him hissed, and he grabbed it —all
his 195 pounds of muscle behind the movement. The club rose, then fell.

Lost Weekend ....
It came upon us slowly, the dim awareness of the thing. Persistently,
pounding, grating into our nerves, bringing the full realization of the
awful thing home to us. There it was. right across the room from us. We
tried to shake it off, to discard it as another bad dream. But it persisted—
pounding, pounding! It was driving us trad!
Finally, with a heavy effort, we leaped at it across the room, smashed
i our fist at the place where it seemed to be coming from—and shut off that
i damn alarm.
Script Tease
On cooler days you must allow
This thought's worth paying heed to:
The sweater girls wear sweaters now
Because they really need to.

Queen quest ....
He put his arms around her and whispered in her ear.
She listened and then nodded—he gently drew her near.
Then he lightly kissed her, and talked in quiet tone.

Who comforts me in moments of despair?
Who runs fingers lightly through my hair?
Who cooks my meals and darns my hose?
Squeezes nose drops in my nose?
Who always has a word of praise?
Sets out my rubbers on rainy days?
Who scrubs my back when in the shower?
And wakes me at the proper hour?
Who helps to keep me on the beam?
And figures in my every dream?
I do!

pretty Pat. . . .
Last night I held a lovely hand ....
A hand so pretty and neat;
I thought my heart would burst with joy,
So wildly did it beat.
No other hand unto my heart
Could greater solace bring.
Than the dear hand I held last night—
Four aces and a king.
Well, whadja expect?
