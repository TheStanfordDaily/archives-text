### ALLEN JOYCE 
The jazz situation in San Francisco has been very good for (he last few
weeks, and at present it is indeed promising. Dizzy Gillespie appeared
for a one-nighter 10 days ago. much to the pleasure of local behop fans.
On the less frantic side, the city now has some fine things to offer.
The great Billie Holliday, here after a series of concerts in the Southland
with Red Norvo. is holding forth at the Cafe Society Uptown. Her dis
tinctive style and famous- rendition of "Strange Fruit" are receiving the
admiration of old and new fans of "Lady Day."
Two concerts are coming up at the War Memorial Opera House. Duke
Ellington, Esquire Jazz Award winner in 1948, will be there Sunday night.
Jan. 30. Featured with him will be Johnny Hodges. A 1 Hibbler, and Kay
Davis. Hodges is a very fine sax player; and both Hibbler and Davis are
terrific singers. Hibbler is the blind vocalist who has been with the Duke
for some time. Kay Davis gained renown with her haunting "Trans
bluecencie." Ray—treat me sweet and gentle—Nance, the trumpeter and
scat songster, will probably also be present.
Hazel Scott will precede Ellington at the Opera House. She will present
a variety of piano and organ numbers next Tuesday.
For those who care: Frankie Laine will be at the Edgewater Ballroom
this Sunday with his usual mediocre accompaniment. Joe Liggins' Honey
drippers and old Meade Lux Lewis are currently filling the bill at Giro's.
The Edgar Hayes combination, with the very "cute" Connie Jordan, have
packed the Say When Club for several weeks.
