# New Comic Book Idea
## 
### 
NEW YORK </P).â€” One way to
persuade your child not to read the
comic books of which you disap
prove is to take him out in the
woodshed and say it with a hickory
stick.
Another way is to supply him
with comics of which you do ap
prove. An attempt to pull this little
; trick is being made right this min
| ute on the youngsters of Mamaro
| neck and surrounding Westchester
| County. New York, and it soon will
be tried across the country.
It began when Henry H. Stans
bury discovered that his two young
sons had in their rooms crime,
blood-and-thundev and sex tales,
and the like which he would rather
hive burned than let into his home
So he and the heads of 11 neighbor
ing families with a total of 50 off
spring "kicked around the idea." as
he says, of doing better comics.
Stansbury consulted the Grus
kins. of this city's Midtown Galler
ies. The G rusk ins in turn consulted
some of the 30 artists thev rcpre

sent, in particular those with chil
dren of their own. Anions them
were Isaac Soyer, Dong Kingman,
and Waldo Peirce, all proud par
ents and A-l artists.
The combined literary-art proj
ect calls on the services of the
world s best tellers of young poo
pie's tales, like Grimm and Ander
son, and leading contemporary
painters. Five thousand copies of
the first new 10-cent comic hook
appeared on Westchester news
stands recently. The story is An
derson's "The Nightingale."
It is illustrated, or as the spon
sors say, "activated." or turned into
a "comic,"' by Kingman. A Gug
genheim Fellow represented in im
portant museums, born in Califor
nia and educated there and in
China, he comes naturally by the
knowledge required to put this
Oriental tale into picture form.
Printed in lots of 100,000. as the
others will be, it will be handled
on a nationwide basis by regular
commercial distributors.
