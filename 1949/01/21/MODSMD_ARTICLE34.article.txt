# 'Hamlet' Film Impresses Daily Critics; Olivier Classic Hailed Best '48 Movie
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN GORDON ADDISON 
Within the stony walls and
dismal ramparts of Elsinore Cas
tle, Laurence Olivier has shaped
a film classic from the tragedy
of Shakespeare's "Hamlet," now
playing at the Park Theater.
Olivier reaches back 350 years to
find a script. To this he adds bril
liant swordplay, gaunt settings, and
breath-taking photography, placing
•he picture at the top of the list for
11)48.
"Hamlet" is, first of all, a triumph
for Olivier as an individual. His in
terpretation of the brooding Dane
should easily win an Academy
Award. It may also be challenged,
for Olivier's Hamlet is not the usual
man of action. Even in the dramatic
soliloquies the Dane is checked, re
strained by Olivier. Only in his fe
verish quarrels with others does
Hamlet turn from inner thoughts to
decisive action and high-pitched
speeches.
Each member of the cast, hand
picked by Olivier, fits perfectly into
his role. Jean Simmons as fragile
Ophelia brings to her madness a
pitiful girlishness, but the climax of
her role comes where her lover
spurns her.
"Get thee to a nunnery," Hamlet
shouts. She falls sobbing to ihe floor
as the camera follows the massive

staircase to the top of the dark castle
and then shows the girl heaped on
the floor far below.
Basil Sidney, Claudius, the king;
Eileen Herlie, the queen; and Felix
Alymer, meddling Polonius, are more
than merely competent. Terence
Morgan brings life to Laertes, the
vengeful, ill-fated enemy of the
Prince.

Technically the movie is also
great. The camera climbs and falls
within the grey walls to lend reality
to the somber mood of Elsinore.
Only once does Oliyier's sense of
timing slip. The flashing swordplay
has ended. The royal family is dead,
and Horatio kneels at the side of
the prince. The tenseness of the
audience has reached a climax and
dissolved. But Olivier does not end
his picture here. He adds a funeral
procession. It is long, ponderous, and
dull, and the sharp incisiveness of
his climax fades.
"Every dog has his day," "There's
something rotten in Denmark," "If
this be madness, yet there's method
in it."—these are phrases we have
added to the modern-day vernacular,
and these flow from the tongues of
the characters in "Hamlet." Olivier
has ruthlessly cut Shakespeare's
four-hour play, but he has cut in
order to heighten suspense. Some
sub-plots are missing, but most of
Shakespeare's immortal lines are un
altered.
There are a few dull scenes in the
screen "Hamlet," but there were also
some tiresome scenes in Shakspeare's
play. Climactic scenes include Ham
let's struggle to restrain himself
from killing the king at prayer, the
tempestuous scene that Hamlet plays
in his mother's bedroom, the king's
great acting during the "play within
a play."

Basil Sidney, Claudius, the king;
Eileen Herlie, the queen; and Felix
Alymer, meddling Polonius, are more
than merely competent. Terence
Morgan brings life to Laertes, the
vengeful, ill-fated enemy of the
Prince.

Technically the movie is also
great. The camera climbs and falls
within the grey walls to lend reality
to the somber mood of Elsinore.
Only once does Oliyier's sense of
timing slip. The flashing swordplay
has ended. The royal family is dead,
and Horatio kneels at the side of
the prince. The tenseness of the
audience has reached a climax and
dissolved. But Olivier does not end
his picture here. He adds a funeral
procession. It is long, ponderous, and
dull, and the sharp incisiveness of
his climax fades.
"Every dog has his day," "There's
something rotten in Denmark," "If
this be madness, yet there's method
in it."—these are phrases we have
added to the modern-day vernacular,
and these flow from the tongues of
the characters in "Hamlet." Olivier
has ruthlessly cut Shakespeare's
four-hour play, but he has cut in
order to heighten suspense. Some
sub-plots are missing, but most of
Shakespeare's immortal lines are un
altered.
There are a few dull scenes in the
screen "Hamlet," but there were also
some tiresome scenes in Shakspeare's
play. Climactic scenes include Ham
let's struggle to restrain himself
from killing the king at prayer, the
tempestuous scene that Hamlet plays
in his mother's bedroom, the king's
great acting during the "play within
a play."


SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER
Within the stony walls and
dismal ramparts of Elsinore Cas
tle, Laurence Olivier has shaped
a film classic from the tragedy
of Shakespeare's "Hamlet," now
playing at the Park Theater.
Olivier reaches back 350 years to
find a script. To this he adds bril
liant swordplay, gaunt settings, and
breath-taking photography, placing
•he picture at the top of the list for
11)48.
"Hamlet" is, first of all, a triumph
for Olivier as an individual. His in
terpretation of the brooding Dane
should easily win an Academy
Award. It may also be challenged,
for Olivier's Hamlet is not the usual
man of action. Even in the dramatic
soliloquies the Dane is checked, re
strained by Olivier. Only in his fe
verish quarrels with others does
Hamlet turn from inner thoughts to
decisive action and high-pitched
speeches.
Each member of the cast, hand
picked by Olivier, fits perfectly into
his role. Jean Simmons as fragile
Ophelia brings to her madness a
pitiful girlishness, but the climax of
her role comes where her lover
spurns her.
"Get thee to a nunnery," Hamlet
shouts. She falls sobbing to ihe floor
as the camera follows the massive

staircase to the top of the dark castle
and then shows the girl heaped on
the floor far below.
Basil Sidney, Claudius, the king;
Eileen Herlie, the queen; and Felix
Alymer, meddling Polonius, are more
than merely competent. Terence
Morgan brings life to Laertes, the
vengeful, ill-fated enemy of the
