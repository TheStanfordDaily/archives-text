# Snow's Deep; Skiing's Good
## 
### 
If you ski. this is definitely not a
weekend to spend with the books.
Yosemite and the weather man
..re combining their best efforts to
provide what promises to be the
rinest skiing of the year. Yesterday
Yosemite reported 16 inches of new
snow in the Badger Pass area,
bringing the total depth to 59 inches.
The Weather Bureau maintains
that the present Sierra snowfall will
continue until Saturday night, pre
dicting clear skies thereafter. For
once it looks as if even the most ef
fervescent of superlatives will not
exaggerate the weekend's promise
for the slope skimmer.
Before hopping pell - mell into
Cadillac or hot-rod for a hot time
in the cold Sierras, it would be wise
to check over the old tire chains.
Always a safe bet on ski trips, they
will be indispensable for this one.
All key roads are open to the bor
der, but many are passable only
with chains, according to the AAA.
