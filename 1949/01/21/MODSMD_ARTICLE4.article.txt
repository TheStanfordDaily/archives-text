# Area and Class Excom Representation Are Considered for ASSU Constitution
## 
### 
Combined area and class repre
sentation for Executive Committee
membership was considered last
night tentatively as the most work
able plan of three suggested for the
new ASSU constitution at the first
in a series of open hearings upon
constitutional problems.
This suggestion, if written into
the new constitution, would provide
for the division of the campus into
arbitrary areas, each having one
representative. These areas would
include:
Men's Row, Women's Row (in
cluding Union Units), men outside
the Row, women outside the Row,
Village, and off - campus. Repre
sentatives also would be elected on
a numerical b;>sis from each of the
ioui classes.
Mark HatfieH. chairman of the
Constitution Committee, said that
this would mepn aoproximately six
area representatives, four class rep
resentatives. pnd throe off-campus
| representatives, rivin" the latter
district more representation than in
the present aren system. This
would also give each student two

votes, one for area and the other for
class representative.
One problem was pointed out by
led Norton who felt that it is diffi
cult to fix natural boundaries and
that the suggested areas were not
to the community interests of the
students such as those living in En
cina, Toyon, and Crothers Hall.
Two other representation propo
sals were made at the hearing:
1. That a congress of 40. com
posed of districts of 200 students,
meet once a month as a large legis
lative body; this body would be
subdivided into smaller committees
; on foreign affairs and social activi
ties, etc.
2. That we maintain the present
j system and redistrict it upon a nu
merical basis.
"Excom representation has al
ways been a problem," said Hat
j field. "Until 1945, members were
elected upon a class basis; then it
was changed to the present area
system. Actually, we have no sys
'em as it now stands, and we want
to make a change which is fair,
'"orknHe, an ' better than the pres
ent one."
