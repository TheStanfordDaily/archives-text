to send much-needed winter cloth
ing, school supplies, and food to

Shortage of Books
A recent letter from one of these
students said:
"We had to leave all the mate
rial. all the important and precious

I books in the old university; and i
| is impossible to build up a new li
brary in a short time when you
can't get the books and when you
j are so short of money as Berlin i-
I now."
Selling of books and other school
' supplies is prohibited because <>i

available are offered at fantastic
prices.
Students Discouraged
"The people are tired," said the
letter, "and an absolutely cold
apartment with darkness all after
noon, all evening, and all night is a
terrible thing. . . . And even foi
us, the youth, it is a bit too much
. . . always to show a joy and a
hope which we are, with all good
will, not always able to feel."
