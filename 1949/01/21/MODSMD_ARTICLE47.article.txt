# Lunnymen Win Over Broncos
## 
### 
Highlighted by the knockout vic
tory of slugging Jim Hammond,
Stanford's varsity boxing team
pounded out a to 3 z win over
Santa Clara Wednesday night at
Santa Clara.
Six matches were on the card, the
other decisions coming via the for
feit route. Stanford forfeited the
125-lb. and heavyweight classes to
Santa Clara and then won the 130-
lbâ€ž 155-lb., and 1 <55-lb. decisions by
forfeit. In the latter two classes
Santa Clara's entrants were fresh
men and not eligible, and although
decisions were rendered, the points
already belonged to Stanford.
Jay Savage was the only other
Stanford victor by out boxing Ben
Cassinerio to score a c'eancut vic
tory in the lightweight. Clever Bob
by Hudson, Farm Welterweight,
earned a draw with Tom Mclnerney
in the best - fought and evenest
match of the night. Both men han
dled themselves well and fought a
last, even contest.
Allan Anderson lost a close deci
sion in the other welterweight class
to Bill Sullivan in a split decision.
Anderson made a strong comeback
but was unable to overcome an
early point advantage gained by
Sullivan.
