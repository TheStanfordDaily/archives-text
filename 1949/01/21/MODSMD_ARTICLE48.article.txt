# Braves In for Trouble: Meet SFCC and Marin
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
Still trying to forget a humiliating zone defense operated by
Menlo JC, the Stanford Braves will attempt to play the inhos
pitable host to some more JC company this weekend.
On Friday afternoon at 3, the JVs battle the formidable City
College of San Francisco. Insignificant as this school may appear

►on the surface, their record shows
them a court power among the
smaller schools of the state. Their
claim to this position rests on the
title of California Junior College
i champion.
As a preliminary to the varsity
contest, the Braves take on their
third JC opponent in succession at
! 6:15. This club, Marin by name, was
no less than National Junior Col-
I lege champion last year by dint of
winning a tournament at Springfield,
Mo.
Marin Loses Men
This year, however, presents a
different picture as several of the
stars have transferred or graduated.
1 One of these, Marino, is now an im
portant cog in the St. Mary's team
which upset Yale earlier in the sea
son.
The probable starters for tomor
| row's contest will prove tougher to
beat on the familiar Pavilion floor.
Fast and tricky Gay Bryan and set
| shot deadeye Paul Watson, recently
1 down from the varsity, will provide
! the scoring punch at the forward
j posts.
Mattson Starts at Center
Mattson. starting his first game at
center will strengthen the team off
the boards and in the scoring column.
Smooth working veteran Jack Schar
fen and spirited Dick Clegg will
bring the ball down the floor.
The less said about the 58-38
: catastrophe the better. The team ran
into an unfamiliar zone defense.and
- could not supply the needed long
shots to break it.
