## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Coach Bob Burnett's Stanford Frosh cagers may receive their
stiffest test of the local season when they tackle a red-hot Lowell
High quintet at 6:15 tonight in a preliminary game to the Stanford-
USF contest.
The flashy prepsters from San Francisco have chalked up 20

straight victories, including a 34 to
11 triumph over Mission High last
Wednesday. Coach Benny NeiFs
cagetuen held Mission to a scant two
field goals, their best defensive per
formance of the prep season.
By way of comparison, the Stan
lord papooses beat Mission 50 to 46
last week, as the Bears staged a
spectacular last-quarter rally on the
Card Frosh subs.

City Kenny Flower, who scored
seven more points than the entire

Sportcaslers Claude Rosenberg

Flower clown to less than 12 points,
we ought to win the game," said
Stanford Frosh mentor Burnett.
The local cagers are no slouchers
themselves, as they have lost only
to the rugged Stanford Braves. The
Cal Frosh, among others, have fallen
twice to the talented Papooses.

back at the pivot post, the Frosh
could turn in a convincing perform
ance. Jim Walsh will handle the
chief offensive duties along with
Ramstead.
Steady shooting forward Ron Car
ver. and guards Bruce Iverson and
Jim Pollock round out the starting
quintet for the locals. Iverson and
Polock have keen controlling both

3-inch Don Carlson, and 6-foot, 1-
inch Flower.
