15 IVERSON 6-1 forward <i-3 BENNINGTON Â«
Hindered by a bad cold, Milt hasn't been up to par of late in hitting his
buckets, but should be set to dig in against the Dons. Iverson is quick un
his toes, stands out on defense, and scores his share of points. Bennington
is steadiest man on USF squad, is in his his third year as a varity letter
man. He is a good shot, consistent scorer, and rebounds well. Will prob
ably be acting captain for tonight's game. EDGE: BENNINGTON.
32 YARDLEY 6-5 forward 6 GIESEN S
Blond George has been bothered by an odd assortment of miseries, in
cluding a bum knee and a steady stream of sniffles, but will no doubt turn
in his usual sparkling game. He is unbeatable on tip-ins and close shots,
and adds great strength to the defensive rebounding. Using a left-handed
hook to advantage, Don Giesen is a smooth-working floor man. He was
second leading scorer on last year's squad, but has been dividing time
with Lofgran lately. EDGE: YARDLEY.
11) STEPHENSON (!-:! center (i-G McNAMEE IK
Captain Bill, showing his best form in the Cal series last weekend, will
have his hands full with McNamee and Lofgran, the two giants who handle
the pivot chores for Pete Newell's Dons. But after tuning up with 38 points
against California, Steve is ready and raring to go. McNamee and Lofgran
team up to make USF doubly strong at center. Both boys score at will, and
are hogs on the boards. Lofgran is the team's leading scorer, but McNamee
owns the individual single game record at 38. Both are dangerous and
spark the Don attack. Lofgran also plays forward. EDGE: EVEN.
4 DAVIDSON (5-3 guard 5-10 GIUDICE 12
Hasn't turned in a bad games yet this year, is the spark of the Card at
tack, and a defensive standout in his own right. He is the best all-around
guard on the Pacific Coast, leads Indian scorers with 59 points in 4 South
ern Division games, and ranks second in the conference. He is rough,
tough, and hard to move on the boards, and is always driving. Ross Giu
dice (Jew-di-see) is a tiny, ball-hawking guard, and is the best dribbler
on the squad. He led Hilltoppers in scoring* last season with 207 points,
and is a clever performer at all times. EDGE: DAVIDSON.
5 LEWIS 6-4 guard 5-9 HERRERIAS 4
Whip Lewis is considered to be one of the outstanding defensive men
in the country. He began to sharpen his shooting eye against California,
when he dumped in 5 points, his highest offensive record of the season.
He is dependable, and sticks to his assignment like glue. Will probably
draw Lofgran for tonight's work. Herrerias is the smallest eager to enter
the Pavilion this season, weighs only 137 pounds, and has to keep out of
the wind, but he gets around the floor like lightning. Is a steady play
maker, and scores a few points when he gets the chance. EDGE: LEWIS.
