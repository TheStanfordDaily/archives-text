## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21 (/P) —
Harry S. Truman came into his own
as 32nd President of the United
1 States yesterday — and solemnly
' called for a great crusade to save
i the world from Communism by eas
! ing the suffering of poverty-ridden
; millions.
l In his inaugural address, he urged
the United States and other nations
with technical know-how to join in
raising the standards of living of
the world's "free peoples." Guaran
j tees —presumably government guar
antees—to private investors who will
i do their part were a salient point in

. the vast program he outlined.
Scornful Note
In blunt and scornful tones, the
I President lashed out against Com
! munism as a "false philosophy" and
| a breeder of war. The nation, he
said, is entering a period that will
be "eventful, perhaps decisive, for
j us and for all the world."
Standing under sparkling, sunny
j skies. Mr. Truman took the oath for
a new, four-year term at 12:29 p.m.
EST (9:29 a.m. PST) before an esti
mated crowd of 130,000 spectators
massed on the Capitol Plaza.
Barkley Sworn In
A few minutes earlier, Senator
Alben W. Barkley, 71-year-old Ken
i tuckian who was born in a log cabin,
had been sworn in as Vice-president.
Promptly at 12:30 p.m., while fcat
j teries of radio microphones carried
I his words out across the country
| and to foreign lands, the one-time
Missouri farm boy who became
President launched into a fighting
speech against Communism and for
"peace, plenty, and freedom."
Blessings of Democracy
The great throng volleyed applause
as Mr. Truman, pitting the blessings
j of democracy against the evils of
Red Marxism, declared with out
i thrust jaw:
"The American people stand firm
i in the faith which has inspired this
nation from the beginning. From
this faith we will not be moved."
