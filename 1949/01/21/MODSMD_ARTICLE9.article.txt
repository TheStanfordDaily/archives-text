Everett Dean will air his views
on tonight's ball game on two
different radio stations. The pop
ular cage mentor will first be
heard over KSFO at 6:15 p.m..
and later over KYA at 7:45. Dur

the lowdown on just what chances
his Indians will have tonight
against the powerful USE Dons.

won and lost record in the Bay
Area, will offer the Indians their
most glamorous competition since
the Yale and Michigan games.
Graduate from Giant Killers
Known as the Giant Killers last
season, the Dons possess an expe
rience, well - rounded outfit this
season that has graduated from its
previous class and has taken its
place among the top fives in the
nation. Already the Hilltoppers have
beaten such specialists as Bradley.
LaSalle, North Carolina State, and
Kansas State.
The lone black mark on the Don
s'ate was suffered at the hands of
UCLA's Bruins, 61 to 57. Stanford
has dumped UCLA twice, 55 to 47
and 61 to 52.
Since bowing to the Bruins, San
Francisco has run up eight straight
victories and will be gunning for its
ninth straight tonight. Having al
ready received a bid to play at
Madison Square Garden in New
York's annual post-season playoffs,
the Dons don't want the Bronx pro
moters changing their minds, and
will be more than happy to fatten
their press-notices at the expense
ol Stanford.
McNainee, Lofgran Spark Attack
USF's amazing record has been
based mainly on the outstanding
work of two highscoring string
beaners, center Joe McNamee and
forward-center Don Lofgran, boih
6 feet (i inches.
Jumping Joe McNamee recently
broke the individual scoring record
at the Cow Palace, dunking in 08
points for 40 mintes of labor
against Santa Clara. - His reserve,
Don Lofgran, tops the season scor
ing with 205 points for a 13.7 aver
age pei game.
Strangest thing about the point
making Lofgran is that he doesn't
start the games, but fills in for
McNamee and then moves over to
a forward spot when Joe feels like
getting back into action.
I.ofgran vs. Stephenson
However, Coach Pete Newell has
stated that he will placc Lofgran in
the ballgame tonight right from the
onening whistle to guard Bill Ste
phenson, so it would seem that he
planned to switch McNamee to a
forward. At any rate, the Dons will
be cit top strength tonight.
Rounding out their starting team
are John Bennington and Don Gie
sen at forwards and Ross Giudice
and Rene Herrerias. the ant-sized
watch-charm regulars, at guards.
Stanford, too, could use a win
tonifht. The Cards, who have been
hurdling bad breaks since the
Southern Division play opened two
weeks ago. will be getting their first
taste of independent play since they
squashed College of Pacific G5 to 5(i,
way back in December.
From 17th (o Sixtli
Stanford will be gunning for its
third straight win as well as its 14th
of the season. By beating USF. the
Deanmen would pul! right alongside
USF at 14 wins and two losses, and
would probably raise their present
rating of 17th to somewhere around
sixth, where the Dons are now
perched.
Everett Dean may make some
shifts in his own starting lineup.
Milt Iverson was forced to miss
most of the practice sessions this
week due to a cold, so Dean may
shift Dave Davidson to forward and
insert Marv Gelber at guard to rest
the ailing Iverson.
Otherwise, the Redshirts will look
just the same as they cid against
California last weekend. George
Yard'ey will swing into action from
his light forward spot, Bill Ste
phenson will duel it out with Mc-
Namee and Lofgran at center, and
Bob Le\?is will be in the lineup to
cover the fancy flinging Lofgran.
Carver Aids Steve
Dean will form his reserve
strength around quick-scoring Gus
Chavalas and Bill Lewis, a sharp
eyed forward. Ralph Carver will
a'so see action, especially if the
combined efforts of Lofgran and
McNamee get too tough for Ste
phenson.
Stanford has a 46 to 42 victory
over the Dons last season to work
on. and will be fighting to prove it
self as the top team on the coast.
Tomorrow night Stanford will en
tertain Santa Clara, same time mid
same place as tonight.

Graduate from Giant Killers
Known as the Giant Killers last

rience, well - rounded outfit this
season that has graduated from its
previous class and has taken its
place among the top fives in the
nation. Already the Hilltoppers have
beaten such specialists as Bradley.
LaSalle, North Carolina State, and
Kansas State.
The lone black mark on the Don
s'ate was suffered at the hands of
UCLA's Bruins, 61 to 57. Stanford
has dumped UCLA twice, 55 to 47
and 61 to 52.
Since bowing to the Bruins, San
Francisco has run up eight straight
victories and will be gunning for its
ninth straight tonight. Having al
ready received a bid to play at
Madison Square Garden in New
York's annual post-season playoffs,
the Dons don't want the Bronx pro
moters changing their minds, and
will be more than happy to fatten
their press-notices at the expense
ol Stanford.
McNainee, Lofgran Spark Attack
USF's amazing record has been
based mainly on the outstanding
work of two highscoring string
beaners, center Joe McNamee and
forward-center Don Lofgran, boih
6 feet (i inches.
Jumping Joe McNamee recently
broke the individual scoring record
at the Cow Palace, dunking in 08
points for 40 mintes of labor
against Santa Clara. - His reserve,
Don Lofgran, tops the season scor
ing with 205 points for a 13.7 aver
age pei game.
Strangest thing about the point
making Lofgran is that he doesn't
start the games, but fills in for
McNamee and then moves over to
a forward spot when Joe feels like
getting back into action.
I.ofgran vs. Stephenson
However, Coach Pete Newell has
stated that he will placc Lofgran in
the ballgame tonight right from the
onening whistle to guard Bill Ste
phenson, so it would seem that he
planned to switch McNamee to a
forward. At any rate, the Dons will
be cit top strength tonight.
Rounding out their starting team
are John Bennington and Don Gie
sen at forwards and Ross Giudice
and Rene Herrerias. the ant-sized
watch-charm regulars, at guards.
Stanford, too, could use a win
tonifht. The Cards, who have been
hurdling bad breaks since the
Southern Division play opened two
weeks ago. will be getting their first
taste of independent play since they
squashed College of Pacific G5 to 5(i,
way back in December.
From 17th (o Sixtli
Stanford will be gunning for its
third straight win as well as its 14th
of the season. By beating USF. the
Deanmen would pul! right alongside
USF at 14 wins and two losses, and
would probably raise their present
rating of 17th to somewhere around
sixth, where the Dons are now
perched.
Everett Dean may make some
shifts in his own starting lineup.
Milt Iverson was forced to miss
most of the practice sessions this
week due to a cold, so Dean may
shift Dave Davidson to forward and
insert Marv Gelber at guard to rest
the ailing Iverson.
Otherwise, the Redshirts will look
just the same as they cid against
California last weekend. George
Yard'ey will swing into action from
his light forward spot, Bill Ste
phenson will duel it out with Mc-
Namee and Lofgran at center, and

McNainee, Lofgran Spark Attack
USF's amazing record has been
based mainly on the outstanding
work of two highscoring string
beaners, center Joe McNamee and
forward-center Don Lofgran, boih
6 feet (i inches.
Jumping Joe McNamee recently
broke the individual scoring record
at the Cow Palace, dunking in 08
points for 40 mintes of labor
against Santa Clara. - His reserve,
Don Lofgran, tops the season scor
ing with 205 points for a 13.7 aver
age pei game.
Strangest thing about the point
making Lofgran is that he doesn't
start the games, but fills in for
McNamee and then moves over to
a forward spot when Joe feels like
getting back into action.
I.ofgran vs. Stephenson
However, Coach Pete Newell has
stated that he will placc Lofgran in
the ballgame tonight right from the
onening whistle to guard Bill Ste
phenson, so it would seem that he
planned to switch McNamee to a
forward. At any rate, the Dons will
be cit top strength tonight.
Rounding out their starting team
are John Bennington and Don Gie
sen at forwards and Ross Giudice
and Rene Herrerias. the ant-sized
watch-charm regulars, at guards.
Stanford, too, could use a win
tonifht. The Cards, who have been
hurdling bad breaks since the
Southern Division play opened two
weeks ago. will be getting their first
taste of independent play since they
squashed College of Pacific G5 to 5(i,
way back in December.
From 17th (o Sixtli
Stanford will be gunning for its
third straight win as well as its 14th
of the season. By beating USF. the
Deanmen would pul! right alongside
USF at 14 wins and two losses, and
would probably raise their present
rating of 17th to somewhere around
sixth, where the Dons are now
perched.
Everett Dean may make some
shifts in his own starting lineup.
Milt Iverson was forced to miss
most of the practice sessions this
week due to a cold, so Dean may
shift Dave Davidson to forward and
insert Marv Gelber at guard to rest
the ailing Iverson.
