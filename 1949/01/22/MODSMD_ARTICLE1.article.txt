## Cardinals Topple Dons Indians Display Sparkling Offense; Humble Sixth in Nation USF, 65-55 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's white-shirted cag
ers, staging their most sensa
tional and crowd-pleasing vic
tory of the year, completely
humbled the sixth-in-the-nation
USF Dons last night in the Pa
vilion, 65 to 55.
San Francisco tried to salvage a
14 and 1 record by putting on a
desperate pressing defense in the
final minutes, and coupled with a
brilliant long-shot offense, the Dons
kept the overflow cowd on its toes,
but Stanford wouldn't let up and
won going away.
Working with an offense that
clicked from all sides, Everett
Dean's Indians proved themselves
superior to the highly rated invad
ers in every department.

another brilliant defensive per
formance.
Team All the Way
