# Eating Clubs Plan Reconversion
## 
### ROW LAND REBELE 
Throughout Stanford's last 47 i
years of University existence, one
powerful institution has remained
to enrich her colorful history.
A scant 11 years younger than the '
University itself, the first eating
club—Los Arcos—heads the list of
six other such clubs formed almost
simultaneously with it.
Freshmen of the class of '52 may '
fail to see a true picture of the j
Farm's seven eating clubs as they
were before the last war. The war
took a lot of the old order with it.
and it remains for the slow process
of reconversion to take effect and
bring the clubs back to pre-war j
status.
Probably one of the greatest ,
losses to eating club men was the !
loss of their ''Little Quad," located
where the Toyon parkin,? lot now
lies. This small cluster ol one—
story stucco buildings was tornj
down during the war and was re- j
cently sold by the University.
Club Features
Built in 1912 by three of the 1
clubs. El Canipo, El Toro, and j
Breakers, the buildings were com- j
posed of separate dinituj rooms, [

kitchens, and lounges. Each club
employed a cook, had its own hash
ers, and would spend many minutes
of the day eating, reading the pa
pers. and bull sessioning in its own
lounge.
The other clubs—Los Arcos, El
Capitan, El Cuadro, and El Tigre—
occupied private dining rooms in
Encina Commons.
Traditions like water-bagging and
a Little Quad were some ol' the rea
sons for the close bond which ex
isted between members of the eat
ing clubs. It is this kind of bond
which the members of today want
to re-establish.
In short, they want a building all
their own—a place yhere each eat
ing club may have its own private
place to eat. cook, and get ac
quainted.
So enthusiastic are the clubs, that
they elected an Executive Commit
tee last Thursday to make all deci
sions concerning the project and ar
range talks with University officials
on its teasibility.
Dean in Favor
Dean K imp ton is in favor of some
such arrangement with the eating
clubs. The Dean believes they have

! proven their undisputed place on
! the Stanford campus.
However, as always, it is the fi
nancial situation which is bogging
down all the well-laid plans. Re- i
grettably the Dean announces that J
"at the present time, there is just
no money for such a project."
Norton, himself an eating club
ber, estimates cost of an all-club
unit at $100,000. Bill Warren, Inter
club chairman, makes it clear that,
for financial reasons, "the plan is
still in the embryo stage." He says ;
there are a lot of preliminary prob- :
j lems which face the clubs, and i
: which can be acted upon before
! consideration of a new building.
"One of these." Bill explains, "is
the problem of getting all our mem
bers accommodations on campus. If
j and when the men get Branner Hall j
back from the women, we may be '
: able to accomplish this, and get ad- |
: ditional dining space at the same j
time."
Dining Trouble
Since the end of the war, the
I question of adequate dining facili
ties has been a major one with the
J clubs.
