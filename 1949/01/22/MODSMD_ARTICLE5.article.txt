						Vino Welcomes New 52 Pledges
## 
### TED LE VINO 
These have been three hectic
weeks for rushees, fraternity men,
and instructors alike.
Although formal rushing has
ended, fraternities will continue to
be on the lookout for good men to
fill up the freshman, sophomore,
and junior classes. Rushing and
pledging is really just beginning,
and undoubtedly some of the men
overlooked in the formal rushing
period will be pledged by the end
of the year.
To the Class of '52 go the best
wishes of all fraternity men, the In
terfraternity Council, and the In
terfraternity Board of Control.
Congratulations to the Freshman
Class for being a fine group of men!
Whether you have chosen to be as
sociated with an eating club or a
fraternity, or with neither, the very
best of luck.
