# Delts Pledge 24 Men; Top '49 Rushing List
## 
### 
k Three hundred and one men
attended pledge dinners last
night, indicating their desire to
pledge in writing 23 Stanford
fraternities this morning.
Twenty-four short of last year's
total, and 34 short of the all-time
record of 335 in '46, this year's total
averaged out to an approximate 13
men pledged per house.
The Delta Tau Deltas were high
on the list with a class of 24 pledges.
Following them were the Theta
Chi sand the Phi Sigma Kappas
with 21 and 18 men respectively.
Runners-up were the Sigma Chi's
with 17, and the Kappa Sigs a
Theta Delts with 15 each.
Although the usual number of
switches are expected this morning
at formal pledging, the total num
ber of men pledged is not expected
to change significantly. Pledges will
assemble this morning at 10 in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house to sign formal pledge cards.
With the two-week formal rush
| ing period behind them, fraternities
will gather together tonight with
their new members to celebrate
what is fraternally known as the
beginning of a lifelong comradeship.
However, for many of the Row
houses, rushing has only begun. The
two-week period just passed signi
fies not only the formal rushing pe
riod itself, but also the beginning ol
I open rushing, without qualification.
I for any student who has completed
| one quarter's residence at Stanford
! and is no more than minus 10.
Any man who breaks his written
pledge to a fraternity is withheld
from joining another fraternity dur
ing the following six months. If the
fraternity breaks the pledge, the
man is free to pledge again at any
time.
