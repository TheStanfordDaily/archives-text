Eating (Hubs
(Continued lrom page 1)
Overcrowded conditions in En
cina Commons, where al! seven
clubs now eat, have eliminated the
possibility of establishing private
dining rooms there. Again, mem
bers explain, membership in the
clubs is held down by the limited
eating facilities.
From all these facts, one gathers
that the eating clubs have quite a
problem on their hands. Enthusias
tically they are campaigning to do
something about it. Most impor
tant, however, in their measure of 1
success, is the fact that they have a
University administration well be
hind them. An administration will
iing to hash over their problems
with them and help find workable
solutions.
Open House
Selection ot members will con- I
tinue throughout the year, Warden
explains. Those chosen will be ex
pected to live up to the eat'ng club i
traditions of a reasonable amount of
participation in club activities arid
otherwise complete personal free
dom.
No doubt the success of the cnt- ;
ing clubs as bigger and better or
ganizations on campus will depend 1
ganizations on acmpus will depend
in large part on the men th.»y se
lect this coming year. The eating ,
clubs offer to these men not only
the opportunity to identify one's
se'f with a growing and ever-profi
table institution, but also a dial- j
lenge to ever better their honored
place on the Stanford campus.
