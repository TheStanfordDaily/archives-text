S. F. Chronicle says: "An automobile maintenance and service club is saving
money for Stanford student motorists."
Palo Alto Times remarks: "The college crowd has come up with an idea to
help beat the high cost of maintaining jalopies, jeeps, and
convertibles."
For only $2 a year you make these huge savings:
40% OFF ON LUBE JOBS (This means you gel lubrications for $1 ).
20% OFF ON MOTOR REPAIR LABOR (This applies to body and fender work,
including paint jobs, as well as all other general repair work on all makes of
cars, at Cardinal Motors).
20% REDUCTION ON MOTOR PARTS, including batteries.
15% REDUCTION ON ACCESSORIES, such as radios, heaters, spotlights.
15% REDUCTION ON TIRES.
5c OFF PER QUART OF OIL AT BOAZ RICHFIELD SERVICE (one block south
of University, on Alma).
2c OFF PER GALLON OF GASOLINE (High-grade Richfield Ethyl and Regular).
WE RE SORRY—
But- in order to ensure speedy and reliable service, we are
only able to offer memberships to 1,500 of Stanford's 4,500
motorists.
If-sounds like a good deal, and it is. By being assured of a volume of business,
Cardinal Motors and Boaz Richfield Service are able to give you a discount and still
come out with more profits than before. You, as a member, will save several times
your $2 annual membership fee each year by taking advantage of these discounts.
