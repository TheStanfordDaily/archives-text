# Cash and Car Taken in Bold Row Thefts
## 
### 
Approximately $370, in cash and
personal valuables, and a 1948
Packard car were stolen early yes
terday morning from members of
Phi Gamma Delta. Sigma Chi, and
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternities.
A'l three houses estimated the
time of the robbery at around 4:30
a.m., shortly after members had
come home from pledging parties
and gone to bed.
Brothers of Phi Gamma Delta es
timated their losses at $160, not in
cluding a '48 Packard stolen from
one man. They said the robbers,
who ransacked the back hall and
failed to get to the third floor, took
all their loot in cash and one ciga
rette lighter. They said two men
lost as much as $40 each.
The man who lost the car said the
burglars must have taken his car
keys, which were missing from his
pants pocket later yesterday morn
ing. Police are still searching for
the car. The robbers left no clues.
At the Sigma Chi house, members
estimated losses at $150, including a
35-millimeter camera valued at $85
und an electric razor worth about
$15. Approximately $50 in two or
three wallets was taken.
The yeggs took personal property
only, going over many of the rooms
on the second floor.
At the Alpha Sigma Phi house,
one man lost his watch and expand
ing band which He valued at $60.
Evidently the robbers were less
successful at this house because of
the great number of men who were
sleeping in their rooms instead of
on the sleeping porch. At both the
other houses robbed, most of the
members had bunked on sleeping
porches.
