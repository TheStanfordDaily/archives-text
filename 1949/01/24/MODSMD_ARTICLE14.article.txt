## 
### 
The Planning Committee wants
suggestions and ideas ior the dining
facilities in the proposed Tresidder
Union. Chairman Ted Norton said
yesterday.
The first unit will he a combined
dining hall and ballroom to answer
the University's most pressing
needs. The committee would like

opinions on whether the next unit
should be a recreation center or a
building to house the ASSU and
other student offices. Norton said.
The plan for the new Union calls
for its construction by units as rap
idly as possible, That way, parts of
the project can be used before all
the builciinys are completed,
Sources for financing the Union
are varied. They include individ
ual donations in memory of Dr.
Iresidder, the profits from the pres
ent Union organization, and an as
sessment of $1 per student per quar
ter voted by Excom, which will also
make donations from ASSU sur
pluses. The Classes of '44, '45, '4li.
and '47. over which Di. Tresidder
presided, are also contributing.
"Construction may start by 1950
or 1951, depending on how tast the
money is collected. We don't think
we should start until we have about
$400,000," Norton said. Probable lo
cation of the buildings will be south
of Santa Teresa Street near the
Oaks.
Suggestions or objections from
students may be left at the ASSU
office in the Old Union, or given to
any committee member.
Committee members include, he
sides Norton, Gus Chavalas, Erline
Anderson. John Pool. Barbara
Czock, Jack Scharfen, Elaine Wal
ton, and H. B. McCuulley. They
