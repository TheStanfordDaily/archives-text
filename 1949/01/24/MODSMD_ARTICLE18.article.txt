# SIRO Seeks Donations for Berlin University
## Clothes, Books, Supplies Needed 
### 
Two tons of warm clothing,
books, and supplies is the goal
of SIRO's drive which began
Saturday. These gifts from
Stanford will be sent to the stu
dents of the Free University of Ber
lin.
Boxes will be placed in every liv
ing group. The drive ends Feb. 15
in order that the clothes will arrive
in Berlin before the coldest weather
in March and April.
"We've worked out all the delivery
details; it merely remains to collect
the goods,' said Bob Van Pagen
hardt, president of the lIR.
The contribution ultimately will
be delivered into Berlin by airlift.
There Richard Sterling, political af
fairs officer on General Clay's staff,
will supervise the distribution.
WSSF To Pay
The World Service Students Fund,
one of the recipients of the recent
Stanford Relief Drive, will pay the
Church World Service for shipping
between San Francisco and Europe.
Stanford's drive is sponsored by
the Associated Students, through the
lIR. The move to aid the new uni
versity was started by Stanford peo
ple who returned from Europe and
told of (he students' difficulties.
The Free University of Berlin
was started in the American sector
of Berlin in opposition to the old
University of Berlin, now controlled
by the Russians. Students bolted
when they were required to take
an oath of loyalty to the Soviet re
gime.
2.200 Enrollment
The university opened its doors
last November and now has an en
rollment of about 2,200. Although
the university was started in opposi
tion to the Soviet-controlled uni
versity. Communists are not barred.
Approximately one-third of the stu

dents are refugees iiom the old uni
versity.
Clothing is needed because the
refugees brought few of their be
longings with them in their (light.
Books are desired because books and
supplies prices have soared out of
reach as a result of the blockade.
Von Pagenhardt stressed the per
sonal nature of the clothing drive.
The relief committee of the Free
University communicates with Stan
ford students via the lIR. and has
already sent many letters of thanks.


WARM- t NOTHING, hooks, and other supplies are being sent to these
students of the Free University of Berlin, who are in the process of
building their own dormitories.

Two tons of warm clothing,
books, and supplies is the goal
of SIRO's drive which began
Saturday. These gifts from
Stanford will be sent to the stu
dents of the Free University of Ber
lin.
Boxes will be placed in every liv
ing group. The drive ends Feb. 15
in order that the clothes will arrive
in Berlin before the coldest weather
in March and April.
"We've worked out all the delivery
details; it merely remains to collect
the goods,' said Bob Van Pagen
hardt, president of the lIR.
The contribution ultimately will
be delivered into Berlin by airlift.
There Richard Sterling, political af
fairs officer on General Clay's staff,
will supervise the distribution.
WSSF To Pay
The World Service Students Fund,
one of the recipients of the recent
Stanford Relief Drive, will pay the
Church World Service for shipping
between San Francisco and Europe.
Stanford's drive is sponsored by
the Associated Students, through the
lIR. The move to aid the new uni
versity was started by Stanford peo
ple who returned from Europe and
told of (he students' difficulties.
The Free University of Berlin
was started in the American sector
of Berlin in opposition to the old
University of Berlin, now controlled
by the Russians. Students bolted
when they were required to take
an oath of loyalty to the Soviet re
gime.
2.200 Enrollment
The university opened its doors
last November and now has an en
rollment of about 2,200. Although
the university was started in opposi
tion to the Soviet-controlled uni
versity. Communists are not barred.
Approximately one-third of the stu

dents are refugees iiom the old uni
versity.
Clothing is needed because the
refugees brought few of their be
longings with them in their (light.
Books are desired because books and
supplies prices have soared out of
reach as a result of the blockade.
Von Pagenhardt stressed the per
sonal nature of the clothing drive.
