Teams from nine Roble corridors
braved Saturday afternoon's rain to
collect approximately 1,000 pounds
of clothing and 700 books lrom Palo
Alto citizens for the Free Univer
sity oi Berlin.
Corridor 3-A won a corridor
spread by turning in an estimated
210 pounds of clothing. 30 pair of
shoes, and numerous books and
other assorted items. Close runner
up in the competition was corridor
3-C.
According to Pat Terry, Roble
SfRO representative, Palo Alto res
idents were extremely co-operative
and gave generously. One lady even
gave a fur coat in good condition.
Although a few of the books col
'ected bore such titles as "The Re
port of the Supervising Architect of
the Treasury Department â€” 1802"
and "Little Lessons in Effective Eat
ing," most of them were of a type
useful to the Berlin students.
