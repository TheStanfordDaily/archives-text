## Demerit Plan Vote 
### 
Is a University woman to be considered a child or a mature
individual? This is the question Stanford women will answer
tonight when they vote in house meetings upon the long-debated
Demerit Plan—a plan designed to promote greater individual
jesponsibility in upholding women's social regulations.
The plan is essentially a great advance over our present anti
quated and outmoded lock-in system. Stand-in-the-corner treat
ment of women disappeared with the famous witch burnings in
early New England.
While giving the woman greater freedom, the plan will also
provide her with a chance for displaying mature judgment and
responsibility for her own conduct. Each woman will be placed
'on her own" with no Gestapo waiting to snatch her for petty
technicals. In other words, the older attitude of distrust has been
dissolved into one of trust, and childish lock-ins have been re
placed by a system that will penalize only the chronic violators
—a mere five per cent of the women.
Several weeks ago AWS incorporated the present 15-minute
bonus with the Demerit Plan which will go before an all-campus
vote tonight. Women will decided whether the plan will be in
stituted with or without the bonus.
Addition of the bonus to the plan would mean further time
allotment for emergency cases, and reinstatement of one of the
familiar features of the present system. However, under the
Demerit Plan alone, a woman may appeal any emergency case
to Women's Council for reconsideration.
Another factor to be considered is that an extra 15 minutes
g?ven every quarter, will not give each woman a chance to prove
her social responsibility to the fullest extent. Miss Elva Brown.
Women's Counselor, has already said that when the women can
prove their dependability, liberalized late leaves will be achieved
slowly. The Demerit Plan alone will offer this opportunity.
