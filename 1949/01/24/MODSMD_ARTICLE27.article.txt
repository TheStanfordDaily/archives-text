## Daily Story on Co-op Club 
### 
To the Editor:
We, the undersigned, would like to know how Gordon Ness and his
Co-op Auto Club rate the large item of free publicity in Thursday's Daily.
While we have nothing personally against Mr. Ness and his club—the club
might possibly be a good thing for some people—we feel that the free
publicity is unfair to others who must pay for their publicity.
For example, The Daily has recently carried large advertisements for a
Palo Alto gas concern which, without any membership fee. can effect
larger savings for most Stanford car owners than Mr. Ness' club unless
the car owners are contemplating a major overhaul.
While the concern about which we speak does not offer reductions on
as many things as the club, the greater savings on some items would,
for most drivers, result in greater total savings. Why should that concern
pay for its publicity when Gordon Ness gets his free?
And if The Daily feels that the Co-op Club rates free publicity because
it is prganized as a non-profit organization, how about a little publicity in
regard to the disposition of the $2 membership fees.

Ed. Note: Drawing the line between "free publicity" and "news" is
sometimes difficult. To a certain extent most of the "news" in The Daily
is "free publicity" for people and organizations. In the Gordon Ness
story, Daily policy was guided largely by the fact that stories on Ness'
activities appeared in the Palo Alto Times and the magazine section of
ihe San Francisco Chronicle. News is news, and The Daily shouldn't
let itself he scooped, especially on a story of a prominent campus per
sonality.)
