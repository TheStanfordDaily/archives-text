## HOUSING AND TAFT 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate Demo
crats backing President Truman's
housing program are attempting to
regain the support of Senator Taft
(R., Ohio).
Taft pulled away when the Demo
crats rushed a bill to the hopper
at the opening session of Congress
before he had opportunity to study
it. Later he assailed parts of it.
Privately the Democrats acknowl
edge they made a big error. Tall
has !cd the fight for public housing,
and his help is needed.
Now Taft is lined up with a dozen
other Republicans drafting another
housing measure. The Democrats
are planning some changes in their
bill in the hope of wooing Taft and
his GOP colleagues into backing a
non-partisan bill.
