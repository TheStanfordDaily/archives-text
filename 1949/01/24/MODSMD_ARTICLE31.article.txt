# WATCH IVES

WASHINGTONâ€”Keep an eye on
Senator Ives (R.. N.Y.) in the labor
| law battle.
The seniority rule "bumped" Ives
off the Senate Labor Committee
this year, but he is still in a strate
gic position as a leader of the 13
self-styled liberal Republican Sena
tors.
The balance of power may rest
with that group when Congress de
cides what to do about the Taft-
Hartley Act.
Ives, generally regarded as a la
bor relations expert, says there is
I "more good than evil" in that law.
He wants some changes and already
has Senator Taft (R., Ohio) in his
corner.
Ives believes he can pull with him
a number of Democrats who might
vote for his revisions instead of re
peal.
