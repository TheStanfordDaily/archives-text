# AIR FORCE PROGRAM
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The Air Force's
program for complying with Presi
dent Truman's 48-group plan is be
ing kept pretty quiet.
One of the main concerns is the
howl that will go up from civic
groups when nearby air bases must
be closed and plans for opening
others must be dropped.
Some officers feel there's no use
begging trouble before the new
Congress gives a better indication
of how it feels about air power
cutbacks. Some planned cutbacks
may then prove unnecessary.
