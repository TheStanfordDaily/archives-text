# Republican Party May Pick Lodge for 1952 Candidate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 22 (/P)—Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., lost a battle, but
some ol lus friends think it may help him win a war—for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1952.
The 46-year-old Massachusetts senator took the hardest fall of all when
the regular Republican leadership flattened 14 insurgents who were trying
to grab the reins of minority control I

in the new Senate.
His name was posted against that

of Senator Robert
A. Taft of Ohio
for chairmanship
of the policy com-8
mittee, a job Taftl
has held for four!
years. Taft won,?
28 to 14. \
But Lodge had
made hisj recorcj..
In his • own - mind,
he now stands
tabbed as the
leader of those

who wanted a new order in the
Senate, a new look in the Repub
lican Party. Be sure that Lodge will
cash in on that.
But why Lodge, the politicians
ask?
His friends popped up with sev
eral surface reasons for his choice
as leader of the Senate insurgents.
Active on Platform
Lodge, they said, did the biggest
part of the job of drafting the Re
publican platform of 1948. Senator
Irving Ives of New York said that
platform proves the Massachusetts
senator represents the "modern
viewpoint" of the Republican Party.
Lodge is young—-46. He did what
no other senator did when he re
signed his seat to serve two years
in the army during the war. He
first came (o the Senate in 1937—tw0
years before Tarft arrived.
These sounded like good argu
ments.
But the reason for Lodge's choice
may lie deeper. And there are some
who say they wouldn't be surprised
if Senator Arthur Vandenberg of
Michigan had something to do with
it.
Vaiulcnherg's Attachment
The Vandenberg-Lodge attach
ment goes a long way back to the
days just after World War I. when
the Massachusetts senator's grand

father, the original Henry Cabot
Lodge, was a power in the Senate.
Vandenberg became acquainted
with the elder Lodge before the
young Michigan editor ever went lo
the Senate. Both were interested in
Alexander Hamilton. Lodge had
written what Vandenberg thought
was the best book on Hamilton until
Vandenberg's own came along.
Vandenberg picked up some point
ers about politics from Lodge. The
Michigan editor put some of them to
use when he went to the Senate in
1928 to become one of the Republi
can "Young Turks."
Vandenberg Aids Lodge
Now Vandenberg—mindful of his
own youthful rebellion against the
party leadership, gives aid to Lodge.
As an example, he put the young
Massachusetts senator on the For
eign Relations Committee.
There is little doubt that Lodge
was named chairman of the platform
drafting committee because Vanden
berg suggested it. Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey took Lodge into the inner
sanctum of his campaign organiza
tion—again the hand of Vandenberg.
Vandenberg kept publicly mum in
the storm that blew up over the
Senate leadership. But friends say
that—though his recorded ballots
didn t show it—the Michigan senator
would not have been adverse to a
turnover which would have placed
more power in younger hards.
Knowing this, the insurgents na
turally turned to Lodge.
Lodge lost, on a secret ballot. But
he may have become a symbol to
young Republicans who want some
changes made—at least that's what
Senator Morse of Oregon says Lodge
is.
Combine that with a matinee idol
look—Lodge is tall in a handsome
sort of way and dresses the part
and you may have the first ingre
dients of a presidential candidate.

ments.
But the reason for Lodge's choice
may lie deeper. And there are some
who say they wouldn't be surprised
if Senator Arthur Vandenberg of
Michigan had something to do with
it.
Vaiulcnherg's Attachment
The Vandenberg-Lodge attach
ment goes a long way back to the
days just after World War I. when
the Massachusetts senator's grand

father, the original Henry Cabot
Lodge, was a power in the Senate.
Vandenberg became acquainted
with the elder Lodge before the
young Michigan editor ever went lo
the Senate. Both were interested in
Alexander Hamilton. Lodge had
written what Vandenberg thought
was the best book on Hamilton until
Vandenberg's own came along.
Vandenberg picked up some point
ers about politics from Lodge. The
Michigan editor put some of them to
use when he went to the Senate in
1928 to become one of the Republi
can "Young Turks."
Vandenberg Aids Lodge
Now Vandenberg—mindful of his
own youthful rebellion against the
party leadership, gives aid to Lodge.
As an example, he put the young
Massachusetts senator on the For
eign Relations Committee.
There is little doubt that Lodge
was named chairman of the platform
drafting committee because Vanden
berg suggested it. Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey took Lodge into the inner
sanctum of his campaign organiza
tion—again the hand of Vandenberg.
Vandenberg kept publicly mum in
the storm that blew up over the
Senate leadership. But friends say
that—though his recorded ballots
didn t show it—the Michigan senator
would not have been adverse to a
turnover which would have placed
more power in younger hards.
Knowing this, the insurgents na
turally turned to Lodge.
Lodge lost, on a secret ballot. But
he may have become a symbol to
young Republicans who want some
changes made—at least that's what
Senator Morse of Oregon says Lodge
is.
Combine that with a matinee idol
look—Lodge is tall in a handsome
sort of way and dresses the part
and you may have the first ingre
dients of a presidential candidate.


Robert A. Taft
WASHINGTON. Jan. 22 (/P)—Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., lost a battle, but
some ol lus friends think it may help him win a war—for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1952.
The 46-year-old Massachusetts senator took the hardest fall of all when
the regular Republican leadership flattened 14 insurgents who were trying
to grab the reins of minority control I

in the new Senate.
His name was posted against that

of Senator Robert
A. Taft of Ohio
for chairmanship
of the policy com-8
mittee, a job Taftl
has held for four!
years. Taft won,?
28 to 14. \
But Lodge had
made hisj recorcj..
In his • own - mind,
he now stands
tabbed as the
leader of those

who wanted a new order in the
Senate, a new look in the Repub
lican Party. Be sure that Lodge will
cash in on that.
But why Lodge, the politicians
ask?
His friends popped up with sev
eral surface reasons for his choice
as leader of the Senate insurgents.
Active on Platform
Lodge, they said, did the biggest
part of the job of drafting the Re
publican platform of 1948. Senator
Irving Ives of New York said that
platform proves the Massachusetts
senator represents the "modern
viewpoint" of the Republican Party.
Lodge is young—-46. He did what
no other senator did when he re
signed his seat to serve two years
in the army during the war. He
first came (o the Senate in 1937—tw0
years before Tarft arrived.
These sounded like good argu
ments.
But the reason for Lodge's choice
may lie deeper. And there are some
who say they wouldn't be surprised
