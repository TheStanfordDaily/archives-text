# KSU Workshop To Meet Tonight
## 
### 
First in a series of announcing
workshops will be held tonight from
S to 10 in the KSU studio, room 204.
Memorial Hall, Wally White. KSU
head announcer, said yesterday.
Anyone is welcome to come.
The workshop will be held on a
different night every week in order
to inlcude as many people as pos
sible. The nights will be announced
at the workshop and in The Daily.
The series will be a practical
training ground rather than theo
retical work. The workshop mem
bers will watch and comment on
KSU announcers on their regular
shifts. Fred Steiner will conduct the
workshop.
