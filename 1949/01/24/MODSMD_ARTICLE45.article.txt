## 
###

Hairy Ape" swings into its first
dress rehearsal tonight in prepara
tion for opening night Wednesday
at 8:15 in the Little Theater.
The four-night run and Satur
day matinee are sold out, but tick
ets which are turned back will be
available at the box office.
The eight - scene play, requiring
seven scene changes, is designed by
Harold Neven as his Master's thesis.
Although the scenery will be dis
torted from reality, it will not be
entirely abstract Scenes vary from
the dark pits of the stokehole, lux
ury ocean liners, and F'fth Ave
nue. For this reason the play has
often been called the "designer's
dream—or nightmare."
To accomplish these changes, set
tings are light and lacking in mas

Two false inner presidium arches

The over-all effect will be jagged
and irregular, a rare type for most
modern plays.
The play is directed by R. R.
