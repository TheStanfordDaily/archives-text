# Russell Flops As Hope Tries To Salvage Sagging 'Paleface'
## 
### AL BERRY 
Then we have the Stanford The
ater's gift to Peninsula movie-go
ers. It's a techniflicker called "The
Paleface," with Bob Hope, Jane
Russell, and a few dozen other peo
ple who will do anything for money.
While Bob Hope is never at top
form without his horse-racin' friend
Mr. Crosby, the old dropsnoot does
his hilarious best to save this tur
key from the fire. In some measure
Hope is successful; the picture has
more laughs than the Tuesday Eve
ning Series. And there is good rea
son for Paleface's tenderloin suc
cess: it has Hope, good gags, fair
plot, lots of color, and Jane Rus
sell.
Words fail us when it conies to
describing Miss Russell.
She seems to have all the sex ap
peal of a rusty railroad spike. Her
acting ability is considerably worse
than Cornell Wilde's. She has the
most insipid facial expression—only

one expression—that it has ever
been our misfortune to pay 80 cents
to see. (We went to the matinee.)
To top off this remarkable perform
ance, the buxom Mrs. Waterfield
managed to conceal what charms
she is rumored to have under reams
of broadcloth, buckskins, and but
tons and bows.
In short, Miss Russell is a .com
plete bust.
The story, which is only slightly
better than Miss Russell, deals with
Painless Potter (you guessed it —
Hope), a happy dentist, and the
course his miserable life must run
when he somehow gets "hitched" to
fast-shootin' Calamity Jane (guess
who). Calamity has been commis
sioned by the Governor to truck
down some nasty fellas who are
smuggling guns to the Indians. She
succeeds nobly, and presumably
lives happily ever after.
The audience, however, leaves the
theater wondering if eight donations
to the March of Dimes and a good
history book wouldn't have been a
better way to spend the afternoon.
