### 
It wasn't basketball at its best,
ljut I lie Stanford Daily's cage crew
came up with a 32 to 26 win over
KSU in the first of a series of games
between the publicity departments.
It was The Daily all the way as
John Hall, who writes a good game,
showed that he can also play one
as he led his mates by scoring 12
points and by providing some fine
floor play.
C'aude Rosenberg was high point
man for the day as he tallied 15
points,.;over half the number scored
by the mikemen.
Buoyed up by their win over
KSU. the Daily cagers have issued
challenges to the Quad and Chap
arral in an effort to prove that
Dippy men are the best basket bail
ers of the University's publications.
