## 
### 
Stanford's last - breaking frosh
cagers trounced an outclassed Pa
cific Grove quintet 56 to 25 Satur
day afternoon after dropping a
hard-fought, well-played contest to
Lowell High o 1 San Francisco Fri
day evening, 55-51.
The classy Lowell prepsters lived
up to previous expectations with
all-city Ken Flower leading the at
tack. It was Flower who controlled
both backboards, who dribbled up
and down the court with unusual
ease, and who still found time to
bag 19 points, 11 of which came via
the charity line.
Walsh Leads Indians
However, forward Jim Walsh of
the frosh put in a spectacular per
formance in defeat by tanking 26
points before lie fouled out late in
the fourth quarter. Through Walsh's
tremendous efforts, the Papooses
were on almost even terms with
the Lowell cagers until the closing
minutes. The lanky forward was
the only frosh to score a bucket in
the entire second half.
Sec-saw Battle
The first half was a see - saw
battle all the way, as Papooses Jim
Walsh, Ron Garver, and Jim Ram
stead matched bucket for bucket
with Lowellites Flower and Bill
Stevenson. The first 20 minutes
was played at an extremely rapid
pace, with Coach Bob Burnett's
frosh employing a fast break on of
fense and a full-court, hard-press
ins* defense.
The close guarding and excep
tionally fast style of play seemed
to bother the men from Lowell
quite a bit in the first half, and the
fans wondered if they could keep
up the last pace in the remaining
20 minutes. The teams left the floor
at half-time with the score Lowell
31, Stanford Frosh 30.
However, the second half was a
different story. With Walsh the
only Papoose that could hit a buck
et. Coach Benny Neff's prepsters
slowly but surely began to pull
away. The close guarding tactics
employed by the frosh backfired, as
Jim Ramstead, Bruce Iverson. Jim
Pollock, and finally Jim Walsh
louled out oiÂ°* the game. The final
score read Lowell 55. Stanford 51.
and the crowd gave both teams a
generous round of applause for a
fine performance.
Frosh Islas( drovers
In Saturday's game against Pa
cific Grove High, the Papooses eas
ily chalked up their fourth victory
of the season as they blasted the
quintet 56 to 25. It was strictly "no
contest" from the opening whistle
as Coach Burnett's first - stringers
ran up the score at will.
Since the second- and third
stringers played all but three min
utes of the second half, the scoring
was pretty well divided. Guards
Bruce Iverson and Jim Pollock and
forward Ralph Dixon turned in ex
cellent performances.
