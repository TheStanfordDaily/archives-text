# Iba's Defense Foils St. Louis
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 23 (/P>. — The
Id wheeze that a good ofiense is
le best defense may be true in
urie cases. Jack Dempsey enjoyed
inch success with that battle plan,
nd Joe Louis hasn't done so badly.
However, like a frayed rubber
and. it's liable at times to snap the
ther way. Henry Iba's Oklahoma
gpie basketball team concentrated
n defense to defeat the talented St.
ouis University team. The score
•as 29-27, in overtime, which is
radically a pitchers' battle in these
i.vs of boxcar figures.
Anyway, Iba proves that defen
ve basketball isn't yet a lost art.
nd we have an idea baseball fans
ho like the 1-0 and 2-1 games will
ke his style of basketball play.
