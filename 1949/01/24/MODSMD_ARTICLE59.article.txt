# Braves Lose To Tough JC Cagers
## 
### 
The inept Stanford Braves washed
two more games down the drain
last weekend, as a covp'e of very
classy junior college quintets left
the Pavilion floor victoiious,
The deadly City College of San
Francisco slapped down the JV's,
53-42. Friday afternoon and Marin
JC mace it a double mickey Satur
day night with a 50-44 triumph.
With Paul Watson and Gay Ery?n
out for most of the second half.
Stanford's offensive punch was gone
and CCSF won without stretching.
Watson and Bryan were hieh for
the JV's with 11 and 10 points re
spectively.
The Marin game was nip and tuck
until three and a half minutes be
iore the end. At this point Kenny
Gardner, Marin center, seeing the
score tied 40 all, dumped in three
quick buckets to clinch the contest.
Gay Bryan practically carried the
Braves, hitting for a total of 18
points.
