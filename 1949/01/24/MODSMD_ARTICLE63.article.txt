# Friendships Begin, End With Exchange Dinners
## 
### JEAN HENDERSON 
A Stanford tradition few students have missed out on is the
Exchange Dinner. The current crop of Roble, Branner, Encina,
und Village freshmen are preparing themselves for the second
quarter of these traditional date bureaus.
A pleasant tradition stimulating friendships between -Farm

"Roughs" and maidens is the friendly
exchange dinner. Half the members
of a men's living group visit a
women's residence for dinner, while
a similar number of women recipro
cate by dining with the men left
at home," states the Frosh Bible.
When the freshmen "Maids" first
came, the senior sponsors made at
tempts at heartening advice to put
the girls in the l ight frame of mind
for their dinner date. One well
meaning senior sponsor said she
knew of a girl who met her future
husband on an exchange dinner.
Good stories like this are too often
counterbalanced by the bare facts.
Boy Meets Girl
As the Frosh Bible says, half the
members of a women's group. Ro
ble for instance, leave their dining
hall for Encina. On the night of
an exchange dinner, the lobby of
Roble is crowded with young hope
fuls in ties and sport coats. They
stand around in bunches awaiting
their fate. Then come the girls. They
stand at one end of the room and
glare at the boys at the other end
of the room. A social chairman
steps out and begins calling out
names. Boy and girl meet. They
usually are well-matched, according
to heights, but sometimes that is all.
The the impressionism begins.
"What did you say your name was?
That's nice. Hmmmm, What are you
feeing to major in? My. Arabic and
Greek languages sound absolutely
fascinating. Well. well. Where are
.you from? Los Angeles? Say, do
you know ....?" By the time
dinner is over our Exchangee and
Exchangette have probably found a
mutual acquaintance.
Ratio Forgotten
For the boys who stay at Roble,
the dinner is quite a treat. It's one
of the few times the ratio seems
less formidable. Most boys rather
enjoy the babble of feminine voices
and Roble's restaurant service. The
girls who travel to Encina are in
their glory. On the way to the din
ing room, they can squeal to their
hearts' content when the water bags '
come tumbling down. When she
starts eating, each girl has the pleas
ant feeling of many pairs of eyes |
on her as she slowly eats her meal.
Besides, she has a whole new set of
hashers to observe.
There are some boys who just give !
up before it starts, and decided not
to show up at all for the dinner. ;
Some girls have keen guilty of the
same trick. Since the freshmen
books have been out, there has been
a marked increase in this practice.

For the boys who stay at Roble,
the dinner is quite a treat. It's one
of the few times the ratio seems
less formidable. Most boys rather
enjoy the babble of feminine voices
and Roble's restaurant service. The
girls who travel to Encina are in
their glory. On the way to the din

A pleasant tradition stimulating friendships between -Farm

"Roughs" and maidens is the friendly
exchange dinner. Half the members
of a men's living group visit a
women's residence for dinner, while
a similar number of women recipro

at home," states the Frosh Bible.
When the freshmen "Maids" first
came, the senior sponsors made at
tempts at heartening advice to put
the girls in the l ight frame of mind
for their dinner date. One well
meaning senior sponsor said she
knew of a girl who met her future
husband on an exchange dinner.
Good stories like this are too often
counterbalanced by the bare facts.
