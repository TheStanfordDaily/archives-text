# Minorsky to Talk To Research Unit
## 
### 
Trends in nonlinear mechanics
will be the subject of a talk Wed
nesday by Dr. N. Minorsky, Stan
ford professor of mechanical engi
neering. He will discuss such di
verse problems as flutter of airplane
wings, operation of electron tubes,
rolling of ships, pumping action of
the heart, and the population cycles
ol the fish in Lake Tahoe.
Dr. Minorsky will be the speaker
at the bimonthly meeting of the
Stanford Naval Research Reserve
Unit, to be held in room 268 at
8 p.m.
His lecture will deal largely with
the application aspects of this
branch of mathematics, and he will
attempt to make it as non-scientific
as possible so that it will be of
general interest.
