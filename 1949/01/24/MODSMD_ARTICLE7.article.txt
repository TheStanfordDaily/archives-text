# Indians Stampede Scrappy Broncos; Yardley, Davidson Are High Scorers
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Coach Everett Dean's fast-stepping basketball Indians har
nessed their 15th win of the season Saturday night by stampeding
the inept Santa Clara Broncos, 65 to 45. in the Pavilion.
The Cards played uninspired, oftentimes sloppy basketball,
but even that was good enough to tame the scrappy but punch-

less Broncs who, as suspected, just
don't have it this year.
The Stanford attack was led for
| the second straight night by lanky
! George Yardley, who tallied 19
| points—mostly on spectacular lay-in
| shots. Cave Davidson, the squad's
"clutch player," was runner-up with
13—all scored in the first half when
they were needed the most. The rest
of the points were fairly evenly dis
tributed as Coach Dean gave every
man on the bench a chance to play
before the end of the game.
Still Batiing 1.000
In disposing of Santa Clara for
| the second time this season the Card
; cagers maintained their perfect 1.000
! batting average against non-confer
ence opponents. To date the Indians
: have won 10 and lost none to inde
t pendent and intersection foes.
This weekend the Stanfords will
get some more of the same as they
play host to the ever-dangerous San
| Jose State Spartans in the Pavilion
Friday night and shift to the Cow
Palace boards on Saturday to face a
touring Pittsburgh University five.
The Cards got oft easily to an early
8 to 2 lead over Santa Clara on
buckets by Yardley, Davidson, and
i Marv Gelber. but were not able to
■ hold the advantage. The Broncos
quickly closed the gap to one point
with field goals by Bob McKillop
and Bob Sunderland, and from there
on the game was nip and tuck
throughout most of the first half.
Yardley and Davidson Shine
Santa Clara held a one-point, 25
to 24 lead at the 17-minute mark,
ut the Indians closed with a rush
to seize a comfortable 33 to 27 half
time advantage. The rally was
sparked by Dave Davidson's whirl
ing one-handed push shots from in
close, and by high-jumping George
Yardley's crowd-pleasing lay-ins.
The fast-breaking Indians came
back strong after the intermission to
put the ice-cold Broncos in their hip
pocket and roll up a lead that at
one time reached 23 points. After
eight minutes of play Coach Everett
Dean began to substitute freely and
the Indians finished the game with
an all-Brave five on the floor.
Too Many Fouls
It was a dull game to watch de
spite the hi"h score and the fact that
the lead was tied up six times in
the first half. Neither squad was
able to hit its long shots with any
consistency, and the harmless Bron
cos and a pair of foul-happy offi
cials contributed little toward a
lively evening.
Referees Lloyd Leith and Bobby
Britt slowed the proceedings down
to a walk by whistling a total of 51
personals against the two teams dur
ing the course of the game. Many
of the fouls were unnecessarily
called.
For the Indians, George Yardley
and Dave Davidson turned in their
usual sparkling' performances and
sophomore Marv Gelber had a good
night under the defensive back
board.
Center Bob Sunderland scored 11
points to pace the losers.

The Cards got oft easily to an early
8 to 2 lead over Santa Clara on
buckets by Yardley, Davidson, and
i Marv Gelber. but were not able to
■ hold the advantage. The Broncos
quickly closed the gap to one point
with field goals by Bob McKillop
and Bob Sunderland, and from there

throughout most of the first half.
Yardley and Davidson Shine
Santa Clara held a one-point, 25
to 24 lead at the 17-minute mark,
ut the Indians closed with a rush
to seize a comfortable 33 to 27 half
time advantage. The rally was
sparked by Dave Davidson's whirl
ing one-handed push shots from in
close, and by high-jumping George
Yardley's crowd-pleasing lay-ins.
The fast-breaking Indians came
back strong after the intermission to
put the ice-cold Broncos in their hip
pocket and roll up a lead that at
one time reached 23 points. After
eight minutes of play Coach Everett
Dean began to substitute freely and
the Indians finished the game with
an all-Brave five on the floor.
Too Many Fouls
It was a dull game to watch de
spite the hi"h score and the fact that
the lead was tied up six times in
the first half. Neither squad was
able to hit its long shots with any
consistency, and the harmless Bron
cos and a pair of foul-happy offi
cials contributed little toward a
lively evening.
Referees Lloyd Leith and Bobby
Britt slowed the proceedings down
to a walk by whistling a total of 51
personals against the two teams dur
ing the course of the game. Many
of the fouls were unnecessarily
called.
For the Indians, George Yardley
and Dave Davidson turned in their
usual sparkling' performances and
sophomore Marv Gelber had a good
night under the defensive back

points to pace the losers.
Coach Everett Dean's fast-stepping basketball Indians har

the inept Santa Clara Broncos, 65 to 45. in the Pavilion.
