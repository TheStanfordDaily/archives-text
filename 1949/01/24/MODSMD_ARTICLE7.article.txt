# Indians Stampede Scrappy Broncos; Yardley, Davidson Are High Scorers
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Coach Everett Dean's fast-stepping basketball Indians har
nessed their 15th win of the season Saturday night by stampeding
the inept Santa Clara Broncos, 65 to 45. in the Pavilion.
The Cards played uninspired, oftentimes sloppy basketball,
but even that was good enough to tame the scrappy but punch-

less Broncs who, as suspected, just
don't have it this year.
The Stanford attack was led for
| the second straight night by lanky
! George Yardley, who tallied 19
| points—mostly on spectacular lay-in
| shots. Cave Davidson, the squad's
"clutch player," was runner-up with
13—all scored in the first half when
they were needed the most. The rest
of the points were fairly evenly dis
tributed as Coach Dean gave every
man on the bench a chance to play
before the end of the game.
Still Batiing 1.000
In disposing of Santa Clara for
| the second time this season the Card
; cagers maintained their perfect 1.000
! batting average against non-confer
ence opponents. To date the Indians
: have won 10 and lost none to inde
t pendent and intersection foes.
This weekend the Stanfords will
get some more of the same as they
play host to the ever-dangerous San
| Jose State Spartans in the Pavilion
Friday night and shift to the Cow
Palace boards on Saturday to face a
touring Pittsburgh University five.
The Cards got oft easily to an early
8 to 2 lead over Santa Clara on
buckets by Yardley, Davidson, and
i Marv Gelber. but were not able to
■ hold the advantage. The Broncos
quickly closed the gap to one point
with field goals by Bob McKillop
and Bob Sunderland, and from there
on the game was nip and tuck
throughout most of the first half.
Yardley and Davidson Shine
Santa Clara held a one-point, 25
to 24 lead at the 17-minute mark,
ut the Indians closed with a rush
to seize a comfortable 33 to 27 half
