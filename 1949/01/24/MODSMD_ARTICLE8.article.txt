# Cagers Climb Ladder With Double Victory
## Cards Quell Last-Minute USF Rally 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's white-clad varsity
cagers officially took their place
among the nation's best last
Friday night when the Indians
humbled USF's highly-rated
Dons, 65 to 55.
A wild-eyed, packed Pavilion
watched the Hilltoppers put on a
desperate pressing defense and a
tantalizing long-shot offense in the
closing minutes, but it was no good.
Stanford held the superior hanc.
throughout, and Everett Dean's mer
won going away.
It was Stanford's 14th win in 1'
starts, and placed the Cards right at
the top of the pile. Before droppin;
this one, USF had lost only om
game in 15 tries, and had been
ranked sixth in the nation.
Gelber Starts
Coach Everett Dean juggled his
usual starting lineup when he in
serted Marv Gelber into a forward
spot to relieve Milt Iverson, who
had missed practice because of a
cold. Dean also toyed with an early
zone defense, but switched back to
man-to-man midway through the
opening half.
Working with an offense that
clicked from all sides, Stanford hit
from inside and outside, and looked
especially potent on the backboards.
Control of the boards was one of
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
the victory.
YartUey and Lewis Lead
George Yardley and Bob "Whip"
Lewis were the fair-haired boys for
Stanford, although Dave Davidson,
Bill Stephenson, Marv Gelber, Ralph
Carver, and Gus Chavalas all had
important fingers in the pie.
"Bird" Yardley was top scorer of
the evening, as he whipped in a
combination of long shots and lay-ins
for 20 points. Bob Lewis was second
man with 12, and also turned in his
usual brilliant defensive perform
ance.
Rene Herrerias, the ant-sized, 137-
pound guard, was high for the Dons
with 12. Most of his points were
