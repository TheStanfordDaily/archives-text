# Cagers Climb Ladder With Double Victory
## Cards Quell Last-Minute USF Rally 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's white-clad varsity
cagers officially took their place
among the nation's best last
Friday night when the Indians
humbled USF's highly-rated
Dons, 65 to 55.
A wild-eyed, packed Pavilion
watched the Hilltoppers put on a
desperate pressing defense and a
tantalizing long-shot offense in the
closing minutes, but it was no good.
Stanford held the superior hanc.
throughout, and Everett Dean's mer
won going away.
It was Stanford's 14th win in 1'
starts, and placed the Cards right at
the top of the pile. Before droppin;
this one, USF had lost only om
game in 15 tries, and had been
ranked sixth in the nation.
Gelber Starts
Coach Everett Dean juggled his
usual starting lineup when he in
serted Marv Gelber into a forward
spot to relieve Milt Iverson, who
had missed practice because of a
cold. Dean also toyed with an early
zone defense, but switched back to
man-to-man midway through the
opening half.
Working with an offense that
clicked from all sides, Stanford hit
from inside and outside, and looked
especially potent on the backboards.
Control of the boards was one of
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
the victory.
YartUey and Lewis Lead
George Yardley and Bob "Whip"
Lewis were the fair-haired boys for
Stanford, although Dave Davidson,
Bill Stephenson, Marv Gelber, Ralph
Carver, and Gus Chavalas all had
important fingers in the pie.
"Bird" Yardley was top scorer of
the evening, as he whipped in a
combination of long shots and lay-ins
for 20 points. Bob Lewis was second
man with 12, and also turned in his
usual brilliant defensive perform
ance.
Rene Herrerias, the ant-sized, 137-
pound guard, was high for the Dons
with 12. Most of his points were

go high after a rebound under the Stanford basket in the second half
of the USF game Friday night. Between them is the Dons' tall center,
Don Lofgran. Looking on and waiting for the ball to bounce their way

made from way out. Don Lolgran
and Joe McNamee, USF's twin dyna
mos. were bottled up pretty well by
Bob Lewis and Bill Stephenson.
McNamee Fouls Out
Joe McNamee left the contest early
in the second half because of five
personals, and Don Lofgran was also
benched in the final moments as
Coach Pete Newell put in his fast
boys in an attempt to close a 15-
point gap.
It was then that fancy-dribbling
Gus Chavalas went to work. He
drew the tough job of bringing the
ball down court under the Don press.
He carried out his part to perfec
tion, as he continued to dribble clear,
passing off several times for impor
tant scores.
Ralph Carver also turned in a
masterful last five minutes.. Big
and rugged, Carver was all over
both backtoards, and he added nine
important points to the ledger to
help sink the Dons.
Stephenson Into Clear
Marv Gelfcer looked very good on
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
although not scoring much, was at
his best in bringing the ball off the
boards and into the clear.
Starting slowly, the Cards worked
themselves into a 12 to 9 lead in
the first few moments, only to see it
vanish when Joe McNamee scored
four straight free throws to knot
the count, 18 to 18.
The ballgame was tied four more
times before the Cards finally pulled
into a 29 to 23 lead at intermission.
After the rest period. Stanford
really went to work.
The score was jazzed up to 44 to
oO at the 10-minute mark, and al
though USF came back with some
amazing long-distance bucket s,
Stanford coasted to victory.

throughout, and Everett Dean's mer
won going away.
It was Stanford's 14th win in 1'
starts, and placed the Cards right at
the top of the pile. Before droppin;
this one, USF had lost only om
game in 15 tries, and had been
ranked sixth in the nation.
Gelber Starts
Coach Everett Dean juggled his
usual starting lineup when he in
serted Marv Gelber into a forward
spot to relieve Milt Iverson, who
had missed practice because of a
cold. Dean also toyed with an early
zone defense, but switched back to
man-to-man midway through the
opening half.
Working with an offense that
clicked from all sides, Stanford hit
from inside and outside, and looked
especially potent on the backboards.
Control of the boards was one of
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
the victory.
YartUey and Lewis Lead
George Yardley and Bob "Whip"
Lewis were the fair-haired boys for
Stanford, although Dave Davidson,
Bill Stephenson, Marv Gelber, Ralph
Carver, and Gus Chavalas all had
important fingers in the pie.
"Bird" Yardley was top scorer of
the evening, as he whipped in a
combination of long shots and lay-ins
for 20 points. Bob Lewis was second
man with 12, and also turned in his
usual brilliant defensive perform
ance.
Rene Herrerias, the ant-sized, 137-
pound guard, was high for the Dons
with 12. Most of his points were

of the USF game Friday night. Between them is the Dons' tall center,

made from way out. Don Lolgran
and Joe McNamee, USF's twin dyna
mos. were bottled up pretty well by
Bob Lewis and Bill Stephenson.
McNamee Fouls Out
Joe McNamee left the contest early
in the second half because of five
personals, and Don Lofgran was also
benched in the final moments as
Coach Pete Newell put in his fast
boys in an attempt to close a 15-
point gap.
It was then that fancy-dribbling
Gus Chavalas went to work. He
drew the tough job of bringing the
ball down court under the Don press.
He carried out his part to perfec
tion, as he continued to dribble clear,
passing off several times for impor
tant scores.
Ralph Carver also turned in a
masterful last five minutes.. Big
and rugged, Carver was all over
both backtoards, and he added nine
important points to the ledger to
help sink the Dons.
Stephenson Into Clear
Marv Gelfcer looked very good on
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
although not scoring much, was at
his best in bringing the ball off the
boards and into the clear.
Starting slowly, the Cards worked
themselves into a 12 to 9 lead in
the first few moments, only to see it
vanish when Joe McNamee scored
four straight free throws to knot
the count, 18 to 18.
The ballgame was tied four more
times before the Cards finally pulled
into a 29 to 23 lead at intermission.
After the rest period. Stanford
really went to work.
The score was jazzed up to 44 to
oO at the 10-minute mark, and al
though USF came back with some
amazing long-distance bucket s,
Stanford coasted to victory.

spot to relieve Milt Iverson, who
had missed practice because of a
cold. Dean also toyed with an early
zone defense, but switched back to
man-to-man midway through the
opening half.
Working with an offense that
clicked from all sides, Stanford hit
from inside and outside, and looked
especially potent on the backboards.
Control of the boards was one of
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
the victory.
YartUey and Lewis Lead
George Yardley and Bob "Whip"
Lewis were the fair-haired boys for
Stanford, although Dave Davidson,
Bill Stephenson, Marv Gelber, Ralph
Carver, and Gus Chavalas all had
important fingers in the pie.
"Bird" Yardley was top scorer of
the evening, as he whipped in a
combination of long shots and lay-ins
for 20 points. Bob Lewis was second
man with 12, and also turned in his
usual brilliant defensive perform
ance.
Rene Herrerias, the ant-sized, 137-
pound guard, was high for the Dons
with 12. Most of his points were

Stanford's white-clad varsity
cagers officially took their place
among the nation's best last
Friday night when the Indians
humbled USF's highly-rated
Dons, 65 to 55.
A wild-eyed, packed Pavilion
watched the Hilltoppers put on a
desperate pressing defense and a
tantalizing long-shot offense in the
closing minutes, but it was no good.
Stanford held the superior hanc.
throughout, and Everett Dean's mer
won going away.
It was Stanford's 14th win in 1'
starts, and placed the Cards right at
the top of the pile. Before droppin;
this one, USF had lost only om
game in 15 tries, and had been
ranked sixth in the nation.

and Joe McNamee, USF's twin dyna
mos. were bottled up pretty well by
Bob Lewis and Bill Stephenson.
McNamee Fouls Out
Joe McNamee left the contest early
in the second half because of five
personals, and Don Lofgran was also
benched in the final moments as
Coach Pete Newell put in his fast
boys in an attempt to close a 15-
point gap.
It was then that fancy-dribbling
Gus Chavalas went to work. He
drew the tough job of bringing the
ball down court under the Don press.
He carried out his part to perfec
tion, as he continued to dribble clear,
passing off several times for impor
tant scores.
Ralph Carver also turned in a
masterful last five minutes.. Big
and rugged, Carver was all over
both backtoards, and he added nine
important points to the ledger to
help sink the Dons.
Stephenson Into Clear
Marv Gelfcer looked very good on
the boards, and Bill Stephenson,
although not scoring much, was at
his best in bringing the ball off the
boards and into the clear.
Starting slowly, the Cards worked
themselves into a 12 to 9 lead in
the first few moments, only to see it
vanish when Joe McNamee scored
four straight free throws to knot
the count, 18 to 18.
The ballgame was tied four more
times before the Cards finally pulled
into a 29 to 23 lead at intermission.
After the rest period. Stanford
really went to work.
The score was jazzed up to 44 to
oO at the 10-minute mark, and al
though USF came back with some
amazing long-distance bucket s,
Stanford coasted to victory.
