# Cosmopolitan Stanford Group Housed in Tamarack Lodge
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Coexisting with the fraternities,
the Village, the Chinese Club, and
the various halls on campus, Tam
il rack Lodge might be called the
most exclusive of the University
operated men's esidences.
Six foreign students and four
others make up the present com
plement of the Lodge.
A co-operative house built in
191 (i by the Japanese Students' As
sociation of Stanford University,
Tamarack Lodge today operates 011
an interracial basis, accepting mem
bers of all nationalities.
Before the war, the lodge re
stricted its membership to Japanese
students. Recently, the house Alum
ni Association opened it to all races.
Set back and above the ATO
house on Santa Ynez Avenue, Tam
arack Lodge boasts 10 one - man
rooms, a newly redecorated living
room, a modern poolroom, dining
100 m and kitchen. Owned by the
Japanese Students' Association, the
lodge charges a rent of $60 per
quarter, not including meals.
"Up til] two months ago," said
Wally Smith, self - elected house

historian, "we did all our own cook
ing. . Since then, some ol' the fel
lows have hired a cook and pay her
on their own."
Membership in the house is pure
ly on a non-preference basis. Usu
ally a prospective member is a
friend of one of the men living in
the house. Before he is admitted
he must be voted on by all the
members.
Headed by house president Larry
Ainsworth and business manager
Paul Tani, Tamarack's creed is
more than one of racial diversity
alone. Men in the house are major
ing in fields from political science
to statistics to engineering. There
is active participation in intramu
rals, the group having sponsored
both a volleyball and a basketball
team this past school year.
"Every now and then." Smith
mentioned, "we find vestiges which
belonged to the Japanese students
who occupied the house before the
war. A beautiful portrait of Mount
Fujiyama hangs in Bunny Chang's
room, and our living room has its
library of Japanese volumes, un
translatable bv most of the fellows."
