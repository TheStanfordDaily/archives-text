# Chappie Runs Original Joke
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The Daily de
nies having anything to do with
the writing of the following ar
ticle.)
We are runijing an unusual joke I
in the January issue of the Chappie
which will be out tomorrow. This
joke is unique in the history of the
Chaparral: it has NEVER been ,
printed in any previous issue!
This innovation is the result of a ;
purge of the reactionary sentimen- 1
talists on our staff, who feel that
our readers have become so fond
of our same old jokes that they
would resent any change.
Despite the strength of this argu
ment, the more progressive mem
bers of the staff feel that our clever
new joke will cause almost no in
sanity from shock and absolutely no
u'cers, peptic or otherwise.
This revolutionary issue of the
Chappie will be sold tomorrow on j
the corners of the Quad and by the j
Union and Post Office. Get a copy !
early and tell us what you think of j
our NEW JOKE. If you like it, we j
will make it a regular feature in \
the Chappie.
