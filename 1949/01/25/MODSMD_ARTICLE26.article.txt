$47,585,500 for capital outlay in Governor Warren's budget submitted to
the legislature today. Capital outlay means principally moneys to be
provided for the university's building program.
This is more than double the similar amount included in the 15)48-49
fiscal year budget.
The amount for construction and improvements is in addition to
$47,881,000 for support, which includes salaries, and other regular charges.
State appropriations would account for only $30,980,986 of the forty
seven million plus. The remainder would be chiefly from other revenues
available to the university.
The net total from appropriations would be $5,519,296 more than the
equivalent sum provided in last year's budget.
Expenditures per student are estimated at $935 compared with actual
expenditures of $746 in the 1948-49 year.
Recommended campus expenditures for support are:
Berkeley, $15,691,237; Davis, $3,869,687; La Jolla, $255,146; Los Angeles.
