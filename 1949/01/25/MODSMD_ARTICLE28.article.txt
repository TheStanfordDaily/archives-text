## Let's Have the Best 
### 
We had some feelings of remorse following our differences
with Women's Council. The thing that worried us was that per
haps the really qualified women would be wary of running for
Council in the coming elections while the position was some
what under fire. But, since then, we've learned that some defi
nitely competent women are trying out for the office.
The positions on Women's and Men's Council are important.
They should not be passed over lightly by the voters. Voters
should first of all nominate capable persons for these jobs and
■Ihen make sure the best qualified persons are elected.
One of the most important reasons why students should select
carefully the candidates for any student office is is that the Stan
ford Family has always jealously guarded student government.
They do not want to interfere, but prefer that students run their
own show. Such a situation is a priceless heritage—and it throws
a considerable amount of responsibility on the students.
The Councils are particularly important in this regard. To
them falls the task of administering the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard. Women's Council, in addition, adminis
ters women's regulations. While the Demerit Plan will lessen
individual cases of friction with Women's Council, the Council
nevertheless has a big job and plenty of power.
In past elections little attention has been paid to candidates
running for the Council posts. Few persons realized how im
portant the positions were—unless they got in trouble.
In the elections for which nominations are now being taken
ihere are six Council posts open, four for men and two for women.
Let's have the very best people we can find elected to fill those
positions.
