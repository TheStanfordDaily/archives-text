## ASSU Money and Benny Goodman 
### 
To the Editor:
Excom deserves a whole bucket full of plaudits for their wise decision
to grace the palm of Benjamin Goodman, et al, for making with the
bebop come the 2Gth of February. It is sure peachy-keen that the charac
ters who wish to attend the brawl for four hours that night will be the
recipients of financial help from over 8,000 of their fellow students, so
that the tickets won't even cost the price of four drinks at Dinah's.
After the controversial issues of ISC. aid to foreign students, support
for the University of Naples, or giving bilge pumps to the rowers, it is
.certainly a relief to see our student government lose no time in appropri
ating money for something from which we all will derive great pleasure.
Possibly this will bring about a worthwhile precedent, and in time Excom
can start subsidizing Paly High dances, beer busts in Kansas, or guided
tours to the Black Cat during dead week.
Once and for all, let's quit worrying about the rest of the world; we're
youngâ€”and who gives a hoot about a grand-and-a-half anyhow?
