To the ASSU Student Body:
The purpose of the Associated Students is, among others, to ascertain
and promote the interests of the Student Body as a whole, both as con
cerns our own affairs at Stanford and our relations with the outside world.
The income of the ASSU is largely derived from student fees; consequently,
the money is spent as the students wish. This year we are supporting a
$9,000 Foreign Scholarship program, a $4,000 Institute of International Re
lations, and $1,800 Debate Team, and many other activities. The officers
of your Association have for some time felt that the interests receiving a
large part of funds did not, perhaps, include among their beneficiaries the
entire Student Body: we had the distinct impression that many people
who were not participating in various organizations which benefited them
only indirectly, rightly deserved something concrete for their annual
ASSU fee, and that a good, inexpensive, big-name dance would best serve
their needs and wants. In past year, the Student Body has sponsored
social functions, which were almost unanimously well received; today
we should not let the fact that everything is not the best in this best of
all possible worlds deter us from doing things which give us pleasure
here at home. The question was one of equitable allocation of student
funds; and your Excom with me, is convinced that we must look to all
the interests involved, rather than gelling carried away in a wave of
emotionalism to the point of operating the ASSU as a universal relief
society. Thus, we are proud to offer to 1,400 of you the opportunity for
a uood party at a reasonable price which, in the last analysis, seems entirely
as justifiable as any other use to which we might put your funds.
