To the Editor:
In the past, students have been asked to part with $5 to get into the
Pavilion and hear a big name band. This has been necessary, for the
organizations promoting the dance found it impossible to pay for such a
band unless such a fee was charged. The main problem was selling the
tickets, because $5 is a lot to pay for (he privilege of dancing in the
Pavilion.
Cardinals has long been wanting to give the student body some activity
in which participation would not depend upon a loaded poeketbook. Now
the officers of the ASSU have given us the go signal. Cardinals is proud
to put student body funds to such good use and we are sure that 1.400
jSrople who attend the dance will heartily agree.
