# Deferred Farm Fraternity Rushing Aids Prospective Pledges, Houses
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Formal rushing season for the
Farm's 23 active fraternities is over
for another year. The pins are hung,
the cards are signed, and Saturday
afternoon and evening saw several
hundred freshmen introduced to
the social side of fraternity life.
Regardless of what imperfections
may have been brought to light in
the past 14 days, there is little doubt
that the 1949 rushing system was a
definite improvement over last
year's program.
Ted LeVino and members of the
Interfraternity Board and Council
arc deserving of whatever credit is
given them for their effort. Direc
tion of a selection program with so
much competition and so many
people involved is no picnic for
anyone.
Those 300 Stanford fraternity
pledges may be especially thankful
for one thing: no rushee was led
into the traditional back room for
a cigarette and the accompanying
lecture on the benefits of member
ship in Phi Beta Gamma before he
had had the opportunity to become
thoroughly acquainted with the
University and to place himself on
speaking terms with a good many
fraternity men.
The modern version of rushing at
Stanford is a far cry from the days
when fraternity actives hopped the
commuter train at Burlingame and
had their pledge class formed be
fore they had reached Palo Alto.
Even today more than three
quarters of the country's fraternity
and sorority systems conduct their
rush season during the first part of
the school year, over half of those

during the first week of autumn
quarter.
Bewildered freshmen hardly know
whether they are affiliating with a
Boy Scout troop or a Masonic lodge
before they are issued the pledge
manual of a national fraternity.
Advantages
Other advantages of a deferred
rushing plan are equally obvious:
1. Freshmen can spend one quar
ter. at least, with Western Civ text
books and generally acclimatize
themselves to Stanford before they
must begin to attend house func
tions and learn the Greek alphabet.
2. Friendships outside the frater
nity are made when a man spends a
year in either Encina or the Village.
At other schools pledges move al
most immediately into the houses
they pledge with the resulting nar
row circle of friends and interests.
3. The interfraternity system is
thus strengthened by the good will
formed between houses. A friend in
another house invariably raises the
esteem of that fraternity.
4. Deferred rushing is conducive
to good grades. Pledges who are
minus will not move into fraternity
houses next. tall.
Despite "solid" cliques who in
sist on pledging the same house,
and the added expenses that Christ
mas and January rushing parties
entail, fraternities generally admit
the superiority ot the deferred
rushing system.
SAE's
The SAE's, however, were the
victims last fall of its most painful
aspect when their rushing privi
leges were retracted for a two-year
period. Fraternity Council mem
bers made the discovery that a
"gentlemen's agreement" does not

carry the necessary strength to off
set the natural reluctance to pledge
only in season. Though they were
not the first to violate the "no ille
gal rushing" pledge, the Sig Alphs
were forced to accept the imposed
penalty.
For next year Ted LeVino listed
two improvements that the Inter
fraternity Board and Council are
expected to enact.
More and shorter open houses will
probably be scheduled. Rushees this
year were not given the chance to
visit many Farm fraternities, and
both actives and rushees found that
three hours of glad - handing and
home town queries was a strain on
everybody's social graces.
Open Rushing
The period of open rushing can
be shortened. Most pledges admit
that their minds were made up be
fore the two - week period had
ended.
Taken as a whole, rushing season
this year was notably successful.
One inevitable black note was
seen in a number of freshmen who
looked upon their not being asked
to join a fraternity as a social dis
grace.
Their attitude is ill-founded. The
man who joins a fraternity does not
by this action become a member of
an exclusive "smart set." There are
no "ins" and "outs" at Stanford. A
man accomplishes what he does and
gains whatever privileges and ad
vantages he docs, not because he
wears a jeweled fraternity pin but
because, as a member of the Stan
ford family, he has earned those
accomplishments and advantages.
Here, the word "barb" is a non
entity.
