# Notes from a Padded Cell

### BOB SEDERHOLM 
The new quarter is definitely
under way. It is easy to tell be
cause you no longer hear the warm,
friendly voices of Stanford broth
es and sisters calling out post-vaca
tion greetings of, "How many plus
did you go?" Occasionally, of
course, a couple of gals would vary
ihis with, "How many 'A's' did you
get?"
Autumn quarter was probably no
more daffy than any other quarter,
but a few things definitely stood
out.
For instance, Women's Council
came out with a new demerit plan
that was, and is, the subject of
much verbiage. On the whole, the
demerit plan was received rather
coldly by both sexes. The girls
thought it wasn't liberal enough;
the boys thought Stanford women
had too many demerits already.
During one football game last
quarter, the card stunt section
flashed '"Vote No on Prop. 12." This
was followed by a flourish of let
ters to The Daily, and I understand
that Rally Com was eventually
warned by the Administration.
Proposition 12, happily enough, was
defeated as everyone expected, but
(his brief entry of ours into politics
is being closely studied. I have it
on good authority that the Repub
lican party has set aside a "Stanford
Rally Com Bribe Fund" in the hope
that influential Stanford can carry
California for them in '52.
The truly important event of an
autumn quarter is the Big Game.
This year, the football team was de
feated honorably, but the really
BIG contest ended in ignominious
defeat. Let's face it, our rooting
section spent the whole day play
ing straight man to the Cal section.
To hell with the pass defense, men,
let's brush up on our repartee.
