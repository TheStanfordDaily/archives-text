The Daily presents this account
of the Village scene by Lou Mur

written before the most recent
"crackdown" by the Village
Council. Now the Village is
tomb-like in its silence.)

At 11:130 p.m. in Village 208, si
lence reigns. Pens scribbling furi
ously, brows are furrowed, backs
are bowed, and an atmosphere ol
painfnlly studious industriousness
prevails.
As midnight approaches and as
signments near completion, some
one curses aloud at a difficulty.
'"Crahs-sak," he mutters, "I can't
do this; I'm going back to Ticka
poopa Tech where your IQ doesn't
have to equal your weight."
"Quiet Hours!"
"Turn blue, will ya, turn blue."
"I don't follow this."
"You couldn't follow an elephant
across a basketball court!"
"Quiet Hours!"
A coke bottle slithers along the
passage to smash against the far
end.
"Anyone want a brownie?"
"Oh. oh. this is it,"says a resigned
voice as a small string of "salutes"
placed in the open mouth of a sleep
ing student start to explode.
"'How can anyone study in a
racket like this?" asks an eager
beaver. as the staccato rap of spit -
out teeth is heard rattling against
the window-pane together with the
crash of a falling body slipping on
the blood.
Suddenly bedlam reigns. Someone

lams his bunkie over the head with
a bed for attempting to burn off the
butt - end of his buddy's brownie
with the business end of a flaming
blow-torch.
A flick of the wrist and the stir
ring notes of "Blue Skies" pene
trate the uproar. Lusty, raucous, off
key, coke-strained voices rise to
the occasion to render their own
masculine, inimitable version.
From between two glistening
gold teeth perfectly centered below
flashlight - lensed spectacles these
pearls of wisdom fall among swine:
''In developing a therapeutic
technique in psychopathological
problems he only arrived at a theo
retical interpretation of causation
that profoundly affected the in
stinctivistic . .
A late-comer, returning from a
lecture at the Memorial Audito
rium, teeters in the open doorway
and says not to open the doorâ€”that
he is going to fly over it. He makes
like a bird, trips over the threshold,
and falls flat on his face. He is
quickly kicked aside, as being anti
social and to make room for a
shuffleboard game being played
with coke bottles in the corridor.
Suddenly the heavens open up
and it rains. Bedraggled "nature
boys" stumble in from the s'eeping
porch to add to the confusion.
Finally, as the tension is released
and the realization that tomorrow
is another day strikes the contest
ants, the noise subsides, shoes are
thrown at the lights, darkness de
scends, an occasional snore is heard,
and the jolly-up is over. At 1 a.m.
silence reigns in Village 208.
