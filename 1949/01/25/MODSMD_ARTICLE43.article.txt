## 
### 
Twenty tickets for the perform
ance of "Build No Fence Around
Me" a week from Saturday night
are still available, Chester W. Bar
ker, speech and drama secretary,
said last night.
All other seats tor the show,
which is scheduled to run five
nights and two afternoons, are sold
out. Tickets are $1.20 in room 202,
Memorial Hall.
This simple play of what is usu
ally called "the American frontier
spirit' is set in the southern Texas
marshlands near the Rio Grande.
The scenery accentuates the broad,
windswept look of the land and
open sky.
Against this expansive back
ground stands the lean-to encamp

ment oi the Bevins, the comical yet
inspired family who intend to drain
the land.
Lighting effects will create a
moonlit Texas sky and summer sun
set tor the play.
The entile design of the play was
done by Norman Hock as his thesis
project. Rock did professional de
signing on the West Coast and in
New York for eight years before
the war.
In this area he worked with a
professional theater group in Car
inel to produce Robinson Jeffers'
"Tower Beyond Tragedy" starring
Judith Anderson.
Working under Rock's direction
are Douglas Russell in costumes
and Don Sheffy in lights.
