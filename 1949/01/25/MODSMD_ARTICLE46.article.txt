# Deke Cagers Win, 17-8
## 
### 
A superb defensive battle was 1
enacted at the Pavilion last night as
the football-minded Dekes bviried !
L<irry Fink and miscellaneous The
1a Chi II teammates, 17 to 8.
The game started slowly; in fact, i
there might just as well have not '
been a first quarter as neither team
was able to score in that stanza. It
looked like the contest might de
velop into a pitchers' battle when
Skip Sharkey suddenly scored mid
way in the second period. A roar j
went up from the Deke spectators \
as their heroes assumed a 2-0 lead, j
Aiter a conference, it was de- j
tided not to freeze the ball for the !
remainder of the game, and the j
defensive marathon went on.
A scoring splurge occurred just j
before the half, and the intermis- j
sion count read with the Dekes
in the lead.
Dave Worley, a recently pledged 1

i Deke, was officiating the struggle,
; but in all fairness to Dave it must
; be said that he was calling the fouls
, mostly against his own brothers.
In the second half, the winners
i
I continued to increase their lead and
won easily as the Theta Chi's were
unable to break their tight defense.
Larry Fink headed the Theta Chi
attack and was the whole show,
; scoring all but one of the losers'
i points.
Bill Adams and Merritt Van Sant
; paced the victors with four points
| apiece.
