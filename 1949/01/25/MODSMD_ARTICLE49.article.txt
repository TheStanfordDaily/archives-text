# Memos On Card Boxers

### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Beating the boxing batter:
This is going to be contusing.
Stanford's boxing team—which won
two, lost two, and drew two in six
bouts against Santa Clara last week
—won the match by a score of 5' 2
io 3' 2. S help me. The Lunnymen
received official credit lor victories
both in the 165-pound battle, in
which the Card slugger dropped the
actual ring decision, and in the 155-
pound shindig, which the judges
called a draw. Reason: the Bronco
entries in the two battles were
freshmen and ineligible as such.
Further complicating the issue were
three forfeit bouts, including one
Stanford and two Santa Clara no
shows. Put all these items together
and you get the answer to the
seemingly screwball score. .
Decisions Questioncd
Semi-off-the-record stuff: When
ihe evening's festivities were-con
cluded, Bronco Coach Bob Weber
admitted to Lunny that at least two
ol the contra-Card decisions were
highly questionable. Both Weber
and Lunny felt that Stanford's Bob
Hudson deserved the nod in his
145-pound bout with Tom Mclner
ney. but the judges called it a draw.
And when Fred Ten Eyck was ac
corded the short end of the verdict
in the 165-pound tiff, even the ref
eree joined the circle of dissent
ers. . . .
Iho antics performed by Hudson
and Mclnerney, incidentally, consti
tuted one of the classiest boxing
exhibitions seen in college circles
for some time. Said mentor Lunny:
The fight would have done credit
to a professional main eventer." . . .
The unpopular decision rendered
Ten Eyck was especially hard to
reconcile, since it was Fred's first
loss in two years of varsity bat
tling. . . .
Bruins Invade Farm
Next outing for our sluggers will
be on Feb. 5, when the oh-so-tOugh

UCLA Bruins invade the Farm. The
Westwooders are rumored to have
assembled the finest collection of
beak-busters on the coast, but the
dapper Indian cjach isn't the pessi
mistic type. Qu ,th Hay. "I'm con
fident my boys can hold their own.
provided they stay in top shape and
aren t bothered by sickness or in
juries." . . .
Which reminds us of the good
news that Mike Pelsinger, ace Farm
heavy who suffered a split eye in
the Cal Poly match, will be back in
slugging good shape for the Buin
encounter. . . .

three forfeit bouts, including one
Stanford and two Santa Clara no
shows. Put all these items together
and you get the answer to the
seemingly screwball score. .
Decisions Questioncd
Semi-off-the-record stuff: When
ihe evening's festivities were-con
cluded, Bronco Coach Bob Weber
admitted to Lunny that at least two
ol the contra-Card decisions were
highly questionable. Both Weber
and Lunny felt that Stanford's Bob
Hudson deserved the nod in his
145-pound bout with Tom Mclner
ney. but the judges called it a draw.
And when Fred Ten Eyck was ac
corded the short end of the verdict
in the 165-pound tiff, even the ref
eree joined the circle of dissent
ers. . . .
Iho antics performed by Hudson
and Mclnerney, incidentally, consti
tuted one of the classiest boxing
exhibitions seen in college circles
for some time. Said mentor Lunny:
The fight would have done credit
to a professional main eventer." . . .
The unpopular decision rendered
Ten Eyck was especially hard to
reconcile, since it was Fred's first
loss in two years of varsity bat
tling. . . .
Bruins Invade Farm
Next outing for our sluggers will
be on Feb. 5, when the oh-so-tOugh

UCLA Bruins invade the Farm. The
Westwooders are rumored to have
assembled the finest collection of
beak-busters on the coast, but the
dapper Indian cjach isn't the pessi
mistic type. Qu ,th Hay. "I'm con
fident my boys can hold their own.
provided they stay in top shape and
aren t bothered by sickness or in
juries." . . .
Which reminds us of the good
news that Mike Pelsinger, ace Farm
heavy who suffered a split eye in
the Cal Poly match, will be back in
slugging good shape for the Buin
encounter. . . .
Beating the boxing batter:
This is going to be contusing.
Stanford's boxing team—which won
two, lost two, and drew two in six
bouts against Santa Clara last week
—won the match by a score of 5' 2
io 3' 2. S help me. The Lunnymen
received official credit lor victories
both in the 165-pound battle, in
which the Card slugger dropped the
actual ring decision, and in the 155-
pound shindig, which the judges
called a draw. Reason: the Bronco
entries in the two battles were
freshmen and ineligible as such.
Further complicating the issue were
three forfeit bouts, including one
Stanford and two Santa Clara no
shows. Put all these items together
and you get the answer to the
seemingly screwball score. .
