Bit? Bill Ro.se. the colorful, six-foot four-inch varsity basketball star,
will hold an 8 a.m. rendezvous this morning with an old Econ test, and
the meeting will have important bearing upon the future success or failure
of Stanford's cage squad.
Bill, who was playing first-string forward for Everett Dean until he
got into a mysterious mixup over an Economics final three weeks at*o
was at that time declared ineligible until he could remove an "academic
condition."
This morning he gets his chance to officially remove that condition,
and if he manages to handle the situation satisfactorily, he will be hack
on Ihe Pavilion hardwood by practice time this afternoon.
With Rose back in the lineup. Stanford's already good casaba outfit
will be in excellent fettle to continue on its merry way, on to a Southern
Division championship, to the first clean sweep over California since
1942, and to a top rate in the National standings.
But without Rose, Stanford's path will be cluttered with dangerous
obstacles. Coach Dean lacks powerful reserve strength at the forward,
and that fact alone could hurt the Indians in strength-sapping tournament
play.
So. while you're gulping down your coffee this morning, think of Bill
sweating out that Econ exam, and hope to gosh-darn that he makes it.
IVeseott Sullivan Moans
Prescott Sullivan, the dean of Frisco sport scribes and a wicked gent
with the well-placed pun, must have had a bad dream the other night.
Yesterday in his daily column, The Low Down, Prescott took up the
ci y of his first lieutenant, Bob Brachman, that "too much whistle-tooting"
is destroying the game of basketball.
He goes on to say that spectator interest is being wrecked because of
the high number of fouls, and that something must be done right away
before the Game turns into a free-throwing contest.
All this hogwash started on the night that Stanford whipped California
66 to (55, but was out-fieldgoaled 28 to 18. Brachman and Sullivan as
much as say that the refs handed Stanford the game on a silver platter.
To Foul or Not io Foul
But that isn t even close to the story. Sure, Stanford scored 30 points
of iree style that night, but the Cards earned them. A basketball team
works plays to get good shots, and that what the Deanmen were doing
when they were fouled. If they hadn't been fouled, it is almost certain
that they would have picked up their points on field goals.
Besides, a free-throw isn't an automatic score. It has to be dropped
thiough the net, too, and the fact that Stanford was able to flip in 30
out of 39 that night supports the assumption that the Indians arc a surer
shooting club.
The most important rule for the official is that he be consistent in his
calls. If the fouls are there, blow that whistle! The hoys expect it thev
work all week on plays, and they expect their free-throws when those
plays are illegally broken up.
Charity tosses are a part of the game. Good teams, teams that win don't
miss them Making free-throws is a real art. It takes practice, hard work
and a steady eye.
Sullivan Strikes Out
As to Sullivan's comment that spectator appeal is lost when the offi
cials stop the game so much. 1 can't see the point. The game definitely
hasnt been slowing down. The cage customer gets more run for his
money now than ever before.
Teams around the Bay Area are scoring more points per game this
season than any time in their cage histories. Scores often hit the GO's and
hitVo ' W tW ° and tHree yeai ' S ag °' teams wei ' e hot when 1he >'
Spectators like fancy shooting, high scores, and fast-moving ball games
Thats what they have been getting this season, and from what I've seen
tney ve been enjoying themselves.
Junk Iwo O Atrial System"
Sullivan says that the coaches should junk the two-official system in
thp°h 1U !! ° ne + .°® clal - lh \ t hi nk S that one official would merely follow
the ball, and m that way only call the most important fouls. Ouch what
a mess. A single referee would be a catastrophe
Lets quit complaining. The officials are doing a good job. The plavers
e ime of °n TV ' Y W °" ld , be a moan - They know that basketball is a
wthf cleverness. When a mistake is made, thev
expect to pay off. Let s leave it that way. the best teams are still winning
0r hasnt P, ' ef *ott Sullivan seen any ball games this season'' "
