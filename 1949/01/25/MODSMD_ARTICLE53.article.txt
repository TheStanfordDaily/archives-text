# Card Cagers Look Forward To Weekend Tilts with SJS, Pitt
## 
### JOHN HALL 
After whipping USF and Santa Clara over the weekend, Everett
Dean's up-and-coming cagers earned a rest yesterday afternoon.
Instead of going through their regular paces on the hardwood,
the Indians held an evening chalk-talk and watched pictures of
the recent USF-CCNY contest in New York.
In spite of knocking off USF's Hilltoppers by 10 points last
Friday night, Stanford only picked

up six notches in ihe National
Standings to rats 11th place, two j
places behind USF's ninth.
Today they will resume practice
for their coming tilts with San Jose
in the Pavilion Friday night and
Pittsburgh in the Cow Palace Satur- j
day night.
Team in Good Shape
All hands came out of the two- !
game weekend in good shape, and j
with prospects of regaining Rose in j
time for the San game, Stan- j
ford will be gunning for its lGth j
and 17th wins.
San Jose, boasting a pretty-fair
country five, will be first on the In
dians' list. The Spartans might have
an argument to offer, as they have !
recently polished off St. Mary's, Ne- i
vada, Pepperdine, and Fresno State. j
Pittsburgh, considered the big op- :
ponent of the weekend, will furnish
high-class interseetional competition
in the resumption of the Cow Palace
doubleheaders this weekend.
Coming out to the Coast, Pitts
burgh's colorful Panthers play USF
on Friday night and Stanford Satur- 1
day night. The Pittsburgh record in- j
eludes wins over Penn State, Beth- !
any. Miami (Florida), Carnegie ;
Tech, Allegheny, and Army.
The Panthers have come out sec- '
ond-best against Michigan (60-42), j
North Carolina State (77-42), and
Bradley (52-50).
Panthers in Denver
Pittsburgh left home Sunday, !
heading for Denver for a game there I
last night. Wednesday, the Panthers
will be in Salt Lake City for a game i
with Utah. Then, it'll be the Cow
Palace for the weekend.
Things are looking up for Stan- j
ford. George Yardley has his knee ;
in good shape again. Milt Iverson j
has shaken off his cold, and Bill Rose !
might be back in action.
