# Is it Hot? Cold? Watch the Birds and Bees--Weather Prophet

### SAUL PETT 
NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (AP)—
Every man should be his own
weather man, I always say.
Especially when the weather
bureau crosses you and you
come out dressed fur sunshine and
get trapped in a blizzard with no
hat or rubbers or overcoat. That
happened to me once too often so I
hunted for another way of forecast
ing the weather.
On the basis of this research into
timeless proverbs, rhymes and say
ings I can now predict:
It will snow if—
Grouse shake their feathers at
night; turkeys sit in trees and re
fuse to some down; cows bellow in
the evening; cats sit with their backs
to the lire; dry leaves rattle in the
tr*>es; rabbits take to open country;

many meteors fall; black clouds
gather in the north in winter; burn
ing wood pops more than usual in
winter; my aunt's first cousin's back
aches.
It will thaw if—
Old sheep eat little; cats wash
their faces; hogs rub themselves in
winter; snowflakes get bigger.
It will be a long hard winter if—
The leaves are slow to fall; the
breast bone of the goose is red or
has many red spots; squirrels grow
unusually bushy tails; the brown
band on certain caterpillars is nar
row; autumn had a lot of fog; the
skin on the belly of a catfish is un
usually thick: the mole digs his hole
two and a half l'eet deep (the winter
will be mild if the hole is one foot
deep); October was warm; onion
skins are thick ("onion's skin very
thin, mild winter coming in; onion's
skin thick and tough, coming win

ter cold and rough").
It will be cold if—
The sky has lots of comets; pigs
pick and stoi'e straws and leaves or
become uneasy and grunt and hud
dle together; geese fly about 10 p.m.;
prairie chickens come into creeks;
field larks collect in flocks; my aunt's
first cousin's teeth cavities give her
a bad time.
It will storm if—
Cats rest their heads with their
mouths turned up; old sheep eat a
lot; foxes bark at night; prairie dogs
bank up their holes with grass and
dirt; rabbits run to the woods; birds
stop singing; the aspen leaf shakes
in calm weather; the silver maple
shows the lining of its leaf; the hair
of red head (man or woman) be
comes unusually kinky.
The weather will be just plain foul
it-
Cats snore; one crow flies ulone

(if crows fly in pairs, expect pood
weather); petrels collect under the
stein of a ship; sea pulls sit on the
sand; sun has large spots; my aunt's
first cousin's corns ache.
ll will rain if—
Dags refuse meat or eat grass;
cats cry a lot; Hies Lite your hand;
bees stick close to the hives; cats
sneeze and scratch table tegs; can
dles burn dim; smoke goes down
ward; walls and pavements are damp
and bad smells come up from ditches
and gutters; cows try to scratch their
ears; horses stretch their necks and
sniff the air; mice run around a lot;
smell of pipe tobacco hangs around
longer than usual; soot falls down
the chimney; rigging rope on ships
and clothes lines become slack; the
bull leads the cattle going into pas
ture (if a cow leads, the weather
will be uncertain); you step on an

ant; chairs and tables creak; im
wile decides to wear a new hat.
It will Ik> fair if—
Tliere is enough clear sky to patch
a Dutchman's breeches; spiders nutkt
new webs and ants make new hills,
there are red clouds in the west at
sunset; there are no falling stars on
a clear summer night.
The stuff about the saints' days
gives us some interesting possibili
ties. For example, all you need is
rain on June 19. St. Protasius' Day,
and this will happen:
It will rain for 40 days. That
means it will rain on St. Swithin's
Day. July 15. and that's another 40
days of pouring. That means it will
be raining on Aug. 24. St. Bartholo
mew's Day, and according to the
proverb, "as Bartholomew's Day, so
the whole autumn."

Tliere is enough clear sky to patch
a Dutchman's breeches; spiders nutkt
new webs and ants make new hills,

The stuff about the saints' days
gives us some interesting possibili
ties. For example, all you need is
rain on June 19. St. Protasius' Day,
and this will happen:
It will rain for 40 days. That
means it will rain on St. Swithin's
Day. July 15. and that's another 40
days of pouring. That means it will
be raining on Aug. 24. St. Bartholo
mew's Day, and according to the
proverb, "as Bartholomew's Day, so
the whole autumn."
