# Legendary Redwood Gives Name to Palo Alto
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
E1 Palo Alto—the tree that
gives its name to a city, and its
image to the Stanford seal.
Whether it is used to legalize a
document or to grace a beer
mug, the famous old redwood has
become familiar as a symbol of the
University.
Yet this is the tree that hundreds
of commuters pass every day—and
never notice. It is the same tree
that students rarely see above the

redwood stickers on the windshield? j
of their cars as they speed along El j
Camino Real.
The tree was discovered in ITG9 ;
by a scout of the Portola party, the j
first expedition to enter Alta Cali

fornia. In 1774 Don Fernando de
livera. Padre Francisco Paluo, and
•i group of soldiers and explorers
camped under the tree.
Here Padre Paluo erected a cross
on the bank of the San Francisquito

j Creek where he planned to estab
lish a mission. Two years later a
third expedition led by Don Juan
Bautista de Anza found the cross,
but the plan lor the mission was
abandoned because 4he creek ran
j dry in summer.
| It was the Spaniards who named
the redwood Palo Alio, or tall tree.
Senator Stanford gave this name to
hi.-, stock farm—later the site of the
University. On December 9, 1908,
the Board of Trustees adopted a
seal picturing a redwood that sym
bolized tiie Palo Alto.
Controversy still exists today as
to whether or not the redwood was
once a double-trunk tree. The Pe
dro Font topographical map of 1776
I shows it as such. However, several
Stanford historians say that there
were originally two trees, which
were mistaken for a single forked
j tree by careless observers.
Another disputed point is the
S soundness of the tree. Many ex
perts have predicted that the red
wood will not last much longer.
However, there is an heir apparent
to the tree. Thirty years ago seven
redwoods were planted near the
Physics Building so that a substi
tute would be available when the
original tree dies. Although one of
j the seven redwoods was cut off by
j a horse - drawn lawnmower, the
; remaining six are still standing.
Today the Palo Alto stands in a
I small park south of the railroad
; bridge almost directly opjx>site the
! Tate of the Convalescent Home. In
, itials carved on the trunk show that
j the site is known to some.
The Indians had a legend con
cerning the tree. They believed the
J Great Spirit dwelt there, ant so
I they met at this spot to settle dis
! putes by peaceful council. The
j ground under the tre was sacred
i and al! were safe in its shadow.

'iiii'. TREE BY TIIE TRACKS—TIiis redwood named "Palo Alto" or
"tall tree" by the Spaniards, is an important link with early California
history, as well as the tree which Is pictured on the seal of Stanford
University. —Photo by Stan Marvus
E1 Palo Alto—the tree that
gives its name to a city, and its
image to the Stanford seal.
Whether it is used to legalize a
document or to grace a beer
mug, the famous old redwood has
become familiar as a symbol of the
University.
Yet this is the tree that hundreds
of commuters pass every day—and
never notice. It is the same tree
that students rarely see above the

redwood stickers on the windshield? j
of their cars as they speed along El j
Camino Real.
The tree was discovered in ITG9 ;
by a scout of the Portola party, the j
first expedition to enter Alta Cali

fornia. In 1774 Don Fernando de
livera. Padre Francisco Paluo, and
•i group of soldiers and explorers
camped under the tree.
Here Padre Paluo erected a cross
on the bank of the San Francisquito

j Creek where he planned to estab
lish a mission. Two years later a
third expedition led by Don Juan
Bautista de Anza found the cross,
but the plan lor the mission was
abandoned because 4he creek ran
j dry in summer.
| It was the Spaniards who named
the redwood Palo Alio, or tall tree.
Senator Stanford gave this name to
hi.-, stock farm—later the site of the
University. On December 9, 1908,
the Board of Trustees adopted a
seal picturing a redwood that sym
bolized tiie Palo Alto.
Controversy still exists today as
to whether or not the redwood was
once a double-trunk tree. The Pe
dro Font topographical map of 1776
I shows it as such. However, several
Stanford historians say that there
were originally two trees, which
were mistaken for a single forked
j tree by careless observers.
Another disputed point is the
S soundness of the tree. Many ex
perts have predicted that the red
wood will not last much longer.

to the tree. Thirty years ago seven
