# Battle to Feed Livestock by Air Continues
## 
### 
Planes, army bulldozers,
trucks, and foot parties were
pressed into the battle to save
snowbound western livestock
Tuesday. The rescue operation
was one of the most widespread of
its kind ever undertaken.
Meanwhile, new cold, snow, sleet,
and floods hit various sections in
the western half of the country.
In Washington, a Senate commit
tee approved a $750,000 emergency
fund to finance rescue work in Ne
vada, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota,
and sections of North Dakota and
Montana. The South Dakota legisla
ture considered a $100,000 special
disaster fund.
The army readied three bulldozers
reported state funds were exhausted
reported state funds weer exhausted
and that the situation was "out oi
hand."
A thick blanket of snow that

trapped more than a million sheep
, extended from Western California to
l the Dakotas.
With winter continuing its Janu
ary rampage temperatures skidded
to more than 40 below zero in parts
of Wyoming and Montana. Carlin,
Nev., claimed an unofficial —57 as
the coldest spot in the nation
Reno had —15.
The coldest weather of the wintei
also gripped the Northwest. The
mercury dipped to —22 in Omak and
Moses Lake, Wash., and —25 at Ba
ker, Ore. Meanwhile, Nome Alaska,
had a comparatively mild 15 above.

Six deaths were blamed directly
or indirectly on the cold in Eastern
Washington during the past few days.
Snow caused many rural schools to
close intermittently. The 25th con
secutive day of sub-freezing weather
in Portland tied a record set in 1893

fear heavy losses unless huge quantities of feed reach
western sheep soon. The animals can't get at the
