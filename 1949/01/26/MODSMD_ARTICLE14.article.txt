# Russia Answers ERP with ECMA; Neighbors Will Join Soviet Plan
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Jan. 25 (/P). —The new
1 Economic Council of Mutual As
j ,
ustance organized by Soviet Russia
and five of her neighbors was
viewed by foreign diplomats here
today as the East's answer to the
West's European Recovery Pro
gram.
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hun
gary, Poland, and Romania joined
Russia in forming ECMA at a Mos
cow conference earlier this month.
The formation of the council was
announced today, with the aim: '"the
exchange of experience in the eco
nomic field, the rendering of tech
nical assistance to each other, and

the rendering of mutual assistance
in regard to raw materials, food
stuffs, machinery, equipment, etc."
Russia, with her vast resources, is
obviously going to be the key na
tion in the council.
Money or Equipment?
(There is no indication, however,
that Russia intends to send rubles
into the economy of her associates
as the United States has sent dollars
to Western Europe to speed recov
ery. Two-way trade agreements
have linked members of the Soviet
b'oc since the end of the war.
Its Cominform, a Communist po
ltiical grouping of the bloc, has
been gunning for the ERP since Oc
tober, 15)47. British diplomats said
they do not expect any major shift
in Eastern European trade policies
to result from ECMA.)
Other Nations May Join
"Other countries of Europe that
share the principles of the council
and wish to participate in broad
economic co-operation with the
afore - mentioned countries" may
join, it was announced.
Of the council's principles de
fined, one of the foremost was a
declaration that the United States,
Britain, and "certain other coun
tries of Western Europe" are boy
cotting the six nations in trade.
Another was that the ERP, or
Marshall Plan, interfered with the
sovereignty of nations.
At Least View ERP
To become a member of ECMA
then, an applying country must at
least view ERP and the present
economic policy of the United
States and Britain as they are re
garded by the council.
Diplnrifats speculate that Albania
and Finland, the Soviet - occupied
sector of Germany, and the Soviet -
ocupied sector of Austria may
apply.

MOSCOW, Jan. 25 (/P). —The new
1 Economic Council of Mutual As
j ,
ustance organized by Soviet Russia
and five of her neighbors was
viewed by foreign diplomats here
today as the East's answer to the
West's European Recovery Pro
gram.
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hun
gary, Poland, and Romania joined
Russia in forming ECMA at a Mos
cow conference earlier this month.
The formation of the council was
announced today, with the aim: '"the
exchange of experience in the eco
nomic field, the rendering of tech
nical assistance to each other, and

the rendering of mutual assistance
in regard to raw materials, food
stuffs, machinery, equipment, etc."
Russia, with her vast resources, is
obviously going to be the key na
tion in the council.
Money or Equipment?
(There is no indication, however,
that Russia intends to send rubles
into the economy of her associates
as the United States has sent dollars
to Western Europe to speed recov
ery. Two-way trade agreements
have linked members of the Soviet
b'oc since the end of the war.
Its Cominform, a Communist po
ltiical grouping of the bloc, has
been gunning for the ERP since Oc
tober, 15)47. British diplomats said
they do not expect any major shift
in Eastern European trade policies
to result from ECMA.)
Other Nations May Join
"Other countries of Europe that
share the principles of the council
and wish to participate in broad
economic co-operation with the
afore - mentioned countries" may
join, it was announced.
Of the council's principles de
fined, one of the foremost was a
declaration that the United States,
Britain, and "certain other coun
tries of Western Europe" are boy
cotting the six nations in trade.
Another was that the ERP, or
Marshall Plan, interfered with the
sovereignty of nations.
At Least View ERP
To become a member of ECMA
then, an applying country must at
least view ERP and the present
economic policy of the United
States and Britain as they are re
garded by the council.
Diplnrifats speculate that Albania
and Finland, the Soviet - occupied
sector of Germany, and the Soviet -
ocupied sector of Austria may
apply.
