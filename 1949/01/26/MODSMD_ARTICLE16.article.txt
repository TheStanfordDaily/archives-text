## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 25. (AP) —
Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin
pledged today that Britain will
join the United States in an all
out "answer to Communism"
1 crusade against poverty in Africa
and the East. He said Russia has no
reason to fear aggressive action
; from the West.
Tomorrow Bevin will go before
the House of Commons to defend
his Palestine policies before critics.
He may choose that time to announce
British recognition of Israel, but this
I is far from certain.
American Co-operation
Instead Bevin may mention only
a changed attitude toward recogni
tion of the Jewish state, and report
on Anglo-American co-operation in
the Middle East.
A lot of behind-the-scenes diplo
matic explaining to the Arab nations
and to British dominions was holding
up announcement of recognition.
Bef or e addressing Parliament,
Bevin will meet with fellow Labor
Party members of Commons. There
he may go farther in discussion oi'
Israeli recognition, and tell of his
hopes for agreement ultimately in
the stalemated armistice talks at
Rhodes between Israel and Egypt.
Suez Attacks
Another cabinet member told
Commons today that families of
British troops in the Suez Canal
Zone live behind barbed wire in
tear of attacks by natives. The state
ment came from War Minister
Emanuel Shinwell, who confirmed
that a young British officer recently
was "beaten up. stripped, and left
for dead."
