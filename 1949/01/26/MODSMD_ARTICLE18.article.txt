NANKING, Jan. 25 (AP) —China's Communists today agreed to
a peace conference in Peiping if the government yields to tough
Eed terms for surrender.
An hour after the Communists broadcast their offer, the foreign
office announced that the seat of government was being moved

►out of Nanking. It will go south,
probably to Canton.
There was no immediate indica
tion the Communist decision would
halt the swilt abandonment of the
capital. Frantic thousands of citizens
jammed trains and railway stations,
trying to get out.
Official reaction to the Red offei
was lacking. Li previously had ac
cepted the Red terms, hovVever. as
a basis for opening peace talks. Tht*
Communist terms call for the trial
of "war criminals." And Li is on
their list to be tried
May Spare Nanking
It was hoped that the Communist
offer would spare Nanking from
bombardment. Powerful Red forces
were moving almost unopposed to
the Yangtze.
Latest reports said the Reds al
ready had seized Kuachow, on the
north bank opposite Chekiang. 40
miles east of Nanking. From there
they can harass shipping with artil
lery or small arms fire.
Pukow, across the Yangtze from
Nanking, was all but deserted ol
government defenders. An estimated
150.000 Red troops were moving on
that railway city.
Reds Near Pukow
With the main force only a few
miles away, Red vanguards were ex
pected to enter Pukow almost at any
moment. Then Nanking will be
within easy artillery range.
r l he Red radio, as heard in Nan
king, said the Communists were
willing to talk peace at a confer
ence in Peiping as soon as "the city
is completely liberated."
