# Approval of Demerit Plan Inaugurates New System
## 
### 
The new Demerit Plan which was passed on Monday at House
Meetings will introduce an entirely new method of handling vio
lations and penalties. The system, which was presented by
Women's Council last fall, will, replace the present system of
lock-ins, fines, and other penalties a week from tomorrow.

Since the bonus system has been*
retained, the first three lockouts of t
each quarter, if they total under 15
minutes, will not count toward de
merits. An accumulative record of j
all other violations will be kept for j
each undergraduate woman through- ,
out her years at Stanford.
Four Demerits
Under the new plan, women do
not appear before house committees 1
at all. They appear before Women's j
Council only after they have accu- j
mulated four demerits.
Council may not give lock-ins un
der the new system. Instead it may ;
put a' woman on social probation
after she lias received four demerits
and suspend hev after she has re
eeived five demerits. Any cases may
be appealed within two weeks after
the violation.
Area committees have the right to ;
refer a case to Council, and Council
may summon an individual at any
time. After each lockout, offense, or
technical women will be duly noti- j
tied of their standing by their area '
committee.
Appeals
Requests for appeals may be made
at the Women's Council Office, room I
3, in the Union, between 5 and 5:45
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday. At this time, a woman
may make an appointment with
Women's Council for the time of
her appeal.
During the first year of operation, I
the Demerit System will allow fresh- !
men and sophomores five demerits, i
juniors four, and seniors three.
One demerit is given for late re- j
turns of 30 minutes, or an accumu
lation of more than five lockouts I
which total 30 minutes, or less. It is
also given for a total of three of
fenses, or a total of eight technicals.
Offenses include forgetting to sign ;
in or out, floaters taken in excess of
quota, male guest in the residence j
after closing hours, violations by
â€¢ guests. A technical is failing to sign 1
out correctly.
