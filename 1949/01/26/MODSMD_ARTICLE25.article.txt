## Foreign Scholarships 
### 
The Committee on Foreign Scholarships will make its report
to Excom next Wednesday night. At that time the committee
will present a plan for continuing the program next year. Whether
or not Excom will take immediate action on the proposal is not
known. However, it is soon enough to start discussion of the
Foreign Scholarship Program.
Living groups which have had the foreign students as part
cf their family, particularly fraternities, are overwhelmingly in
iavor of continuing the plan. Some have voted already to provide
joom, board, and up to $25 pocket money for next year's scholars.
A small house, where the burden per man was greater ihan
in some of the larger units, considered the money well spent
and asked for a foreign student for two quarters next year.
One reason fraternities took the lead on the plan is that they
have had continuing success with their Tarver Exchange Schol
arship with the University of London. Last year's Tarver scholar,
Bob Healing, was initiated Theta Chi. The fraternity speaks of
Healing thus: "What a great guy. Wish we could have had him
for another year!"
Generally, we think that is the feeling concerning the seven
students on the ASSU scholarship plan.
Probably the most apparent benefit of the plan is that the stu
dents picked are the future leaders of Europe. They'll be able
to take a true picture of America home with them. Of course,
Stanford has always had foreign students. But there were few
students from Europe, probably for economic reason as well as
i.he war. For that reason the plan was designed for European
students.
Another benefit of the Stanford plan is that nearly 40 other
American universities have become interested in the plan be
cause of the resultant publicity. If the plan is continued here,
there is an excellent chance that it will snowball all over the
United States.
Opposition to continuing the plan will develop along these
lines:
With the rise in tuition and the ending of G.I. Bill benefits,
it is becoming increasingly hard for Stanford students to make
both ends meet. We should use the ASSU surplus funds for
taking care of our own will be the argument.
Granted, the scholarship program here and nationally needs
attention. But the 57,000 (our guess) which will be easily avail
able from surplus funds will be better spent on the foreign schol
arships. The international understanding the plan will promote
and the genuine good it will do for world peace outweighs what
relief the surplus funds could supply locally.
