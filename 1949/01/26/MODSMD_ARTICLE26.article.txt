# "TV Eyes" Debunked
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/P).—Do you have
"television eyes"?
Some people think they do. They
think television is hurting their
eyes. One man even says his dog
went cross-eyed watching televi
sion.
But don't get worried. There's no
such thing as "television eyes."
There aren't any rays coming from
a TV set that will do the slightest
harm to your eyes. Television, in
fact, may help you learn about eye
troubles you already had, but didn't
know about.
Dr. Franklin M. Foote, executive
director of the National Society for
!he Prevention of Blindness, has
checked into the matter pretty
caretully.
"A few people are going to eye
doctors, complaining that watching
television makes their eyes hurt, or
gives them headaches," he said.
"We've received queries, too. Some
people ask whether harmful radia
tions come at their eyes from the
television screen. But from all the
facts we can learn, there's nothing
to either idea."
Maybe your eyes do bother you
when you watch television.
"But the explanation is simple,"
Dr. Foote said. "A person may
have a minor visual defect, like
near - sightedness or astigmatism.
He gets along without noticing it.
Perhaps he doesn't read much, or
do anything else to make his eyes
work hard. Then he gets a tele

vision set. He spends hours focus
ing on a small screen. His eyes
have to work. The eye muscles
and nerves get tired and he gets
eye fatigue. '
"He may discover he needs
glasses. But he would have needed
them if he had started to read
books, or had started going to the
movies every night. Television
: didn't cause any trouble. The
trouble already existed.
"People with normal vision can
, get eye fatigue from television if
1 they sit too close, or too far away,
or if the set isn't tuned properly.
Holding the head in an uncomfor
table position can cause a headache
or neckache. Middle - aged people
may notice the iatigue sooner. At
j middle ape the eye muscles and
even the lenses lose some of their
elasticity.
| There are some good rules to
| avoid eye fatigue, Dr. Foote 'said.
One is not to have the room dark.
The darkness makes too great a
contrast between the bright picture
i and the surroundings. That means
i more work for your eyes. Motion
picture theaters are dimly lighted
to save this kind of eye work. At
home, keep at least a dim light on,
preferably behind you, or an over
head. indirect light.
Sit six to eight feet from sets with
a 10- or 12-inch tube. Sit in front,
preferably, and have the screen at
eye level. Tune the set so you have
a good clear picture.

troubles you already had, but didn't
know about.
Dr. Franklin M. Foote, executive
director of the National Society for
!he Prevention of Blindness, has
checked into the matter pretty
caretully.
"A few people are going to eye
doctors, complaining that watching
television makes their eyes hurt, or
gives them headaches," he said.
"We've received queries, too. Some
people ask whether harmful radia
tions come at their eyes from the
television screen. But from all the
facts we can learn, there's nothing
to either idea."
Maybe your eyes do bother you
when you watch television.
"But the explanation is simple,"
Dr. Foote said. "A person may
have a minor visual defect, like
near - sightedness or astigmatism.
He gets along without noticing it.
Perhaps he doesn't read much, or
do anything else to make his eyes
work hard. Then he gets a tele

vision set. He spends hours focus
ing on a small screen. His eyes
have to work. The eye muscles
and nerves get tired and he gets
eye fatigue. '
"He may discover he needs
glasses. But he would have needed
them if he had started to read
books, or had started going to the
movies every night. Television
: didn't cause any trouble. The
trouble already existed.
"People with normal vision can
, get eye fatigue from television if
1 they sit too close, or too far away,
or if the set isn't tuned properly.
Holding the head in an uncomfor
table position can cause a headache
or neckache. Middle - aged people
may notice the iatigue sooner. At

even the lenses lose some of their
elasticity.
| There are some good rules to
| avoid eye fatigue, Dr. Foote 'said.
One is not to have the room dark.
The darkness makes too great a
contrast between the bright picture
i and the surroundings. That means
i more work for your eyes. Motion
picture theaters are dimly lighted
to save this kind of eye work. At
home, keep at least a dim light on,
preferably behind you, or an over
head. indirect light.
Sit six to eight feet from sets with
a 10- or 12-inch tube. Sit in front,
preferably, and have the screen at
eye level. Tune the set so you have
a good clear picture.
NEW YORK (/P).—Do you have
"television eyes"?
Some people think they do. They
think television is hurting their
eyes. One man even says his dog
went cross-eyed watching televi
sion.
But don't get worried. There's no
such thing as "television eyes."
There aren't any rays coming from
a TV set that will do the slightest
harm to your eyes. Television, in
fact, may help you learn about eye
