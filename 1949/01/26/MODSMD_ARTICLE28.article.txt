## There's Something About Skiing..

"Arlene, I said, ''get up. It's al
| most dawn."
The nebulous while mass on the
: bed next to mine moved slightly
and uttered a barely audible "Fnff."
"Arlene," I repeated, "we are go
j ing up to Sugar Bowl, remember?"
"Two lumps, p'ease. No cream."
When at length 1 had excavated
my roommate from a mound of
| bedclothes, I tossed her a set of
long underwear. "Here,'' I said,
| "put on this union suit."
"But ah'm from the South," she
protested.
"We'll never do any skiing at
this rate," I said.
After Arlene had dressed she
wanted to put on her skis right
away. I persuaded her not to. It
would have been different even if
j our room hadn't been in the far
thest corner of Lagunita (we axe
j sometimes classed as off - campus
! students, but as it was, I felt that
the clacking ot board down the
halls at 5 a.m. would not be re
. garded 112 avorably. Besides, neither
of us knew how to herringbone
down the stairs.
Have We Got Everything?
I "Have we got everything?" Ar
lene asked as we left the room.
"Who are we to judge that?" I
said.
"I mean equipment."
; "Oh. Weil, let me see. Curlers,
bobby pins, hand lotion, astringent,
face cream — and then the skiing
i stuff. Yes, I guess so."
We had begun our 10-minute trek
to the lobby when I noticed that
j Arlene's eyes were half shut. "In
Psych 51," she explained, "we
j learned that this is the most re
laxed position for the eyelids. You
will notice that on most corpses, un
less they have been tampered with,
, the eyes are in this state."
"Please," I shuddered. "This is no
time be be anticipating death."
Five Demerits
A couple of noble Roughs had
volunteered to chauffeur us to the
Sierras, and we found them wait
ing patiently in the Lag driveway.
From the radio of their car hot jazz
; poured forth, wafting its way up to
the rooms directly above. Arlene
j and I turned a bilious shade of
j green.
"Four demerits," Arlene said.
"Five. I said. "It is not classi-
I cal music "
i The trip was relatively unevent
ful until we stooped for breakfast
at a small, dingy roadhouse just
1 east of Sacramento. The first thing
we noticed about the place was that
it was horribly cold. The purpose
of this, we later realized, was to dis
tract the customers attention from
the food and also render him in
capable of describing it to incom

ing patrons. The orange juice was
n t bad—there is not much you can
do to an oranue, even if it is from
Florida. But it was the first time
we had ever wrestled with griddle
cakes that fought back.
We're Getting Close
A few hours later the mountains
rose majestically from the flatness
of the horizon, and we began the
long upward climb.
"We're gettin' near the skiing
area," one of the Roughs remarked.
"How can you tell?" I queried.
"Vultures."
"Don't worry," I told Arlene as
we slumped down further in the
back seat. "My skis came with di
rections on how to convert them
into splinters."
"The word is 'splints'," she mut
tered. ! wouldn't say she was ner
vou.- ! ut I had never seen her chew
her • .v rows before.
On the Tow
At last the long - awaited mo
ment arrived, and we two fledglings
stood with glowing checks in the
Mne waiting to ride up the rope
tow. Two hours later, having finally
mastered the idiosyncrasies of this
contrivance, we were ready to go
DOWN the hill.
"I am only going down as far as
that instructor," Alene said, point
ing to a distinguished-looking gen
tleman who seemed to know a
snowplow from a shovel.
"Lessons!" I ejaculated. "How ri
diculous! The only way to learn is
through experience." I shoved off

J heatedly at a clip of 50 m.p.h. The
j next thing to invade my consciou.s
-; ness was a great pile of snow and,
blended in with it, the distin
guished-looking gentleman. He did
n't look distinguished any more,
and from the remarks he was mak
ing I decided he was no gentleman.
, Finally he asked il I would mind
getting of! of him.
"Certainly not," I said. "You
| should have said something sooner."
Eyes Said •'lilt'
When I found Arlene I asked her
what had happened. "I don't know
exactly, she declared, "but when
you went by me your eyes lit up
and said 'Tilt'.' Suddenly she
choked and pointed toward the bot
tom ol the slope. Two brown specks
were gradually coming to a halt.
1 "Your skis!"
"Let them go," I said. "They are
doing better without me. Arlene,
where do you suppose we could
rent a toboggan cheap?"
