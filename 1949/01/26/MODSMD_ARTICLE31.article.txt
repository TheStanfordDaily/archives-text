From the New York Times Book I
Review:
Morris L. Ernst commenting on i
the book "Mr. Justice Black'' by
John P. Frank: ". . . a worthwhile
book for all those who like to play
with the game of discerning the in
gredients that lie behind a jurist's ;
words."
Murray Hickey Ley writing about
"New Directions," edited by James
Laughlin: ". . . the great majority
of the poems and stories are undis
tinguished. There is competence,
insight, feeling and image . . . which
never issues into sight or moves the |
imagination.
"Why is this so? Perhaps because !
. . . the touchstone of our age is |
lost. . . The heroes strive obscurely
to atone for this loss through cruci
fixion, cannibalism, suicide.
"Little Jack Horner is here ... In I
this mid-twentieth century book he :
is his own meaning: he is neither a
good nor a bad bov. but only an
endlessly lost child."
Criticizes Marc Brnndel of "An
Act of Love" by Ira Wolfert: "Un
fortunately, however much one may
admire Mr. Wolfert as a reporter,
however much one may sympathize i
with his point of view, 'An Act of j
Love' as a novel is grossly out of I
proportion, so intolerably repeti- i
tious. that again and again through
its length one cannot help wonder- i
ing as Harry himself does at one j
point: 'Will there never be an end j
to the incoherence in him?'"

From "In and Out of Books'' by
, Ralph Thompson in The Now York
Times Magazine:
Formula for the popular novelist:

tumed setting or (2) develop a de

O monumental volume, smug and
fat!
Did man, who wrote the Song of
Songs, write that?
O God! O Kinsey! O Jehoshaphat!
Excerpts from "Days with Ber
nard Shaw" by Stephen Winston:
"I believe in the discipline of si- (
lence and could talk for hours j

not wicked enough to become
great."

Carleton 11. Parker, quoted by
Richard A. Lester in "Economics of
Labor": "Students. disappointed
■ and balked by the the impersonal
and perfunctory instruction given in
American universities, compensate
by an enthusiasm over athletics and
| student activities. . . . College ath

the illness of experiencing a uni

take the place of the doctor, nor the
university janitor, the place of a
certain professor, even though some
i students mieht consider that a step
in the light direction."

dyng or a mare'?" With all the can
dor of his diplomacy, the instructor
remarked, "Mv dear young lady, if
i you haven't learned the facts ol
lile by now, see me after class and
I wi'l inculcate in your intellect
the wisdom that will open for you
the portals of understanding and
revelation."
