As long as the Chinese can
earn enough for a bowl of rice
there will be some semblance
of law and order in China.
Once sales in Shanghai drop be
low subsistence levels the people
will revolt, said Dr. Claude A. Buss
at the Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture last night. "And when Shang
hai revolts, even (he Communists
will hesitate to take over."
''American Policy in the Far
East" should be directed toward the
needs of the Chinese people, pro
claimed Buss. He said that it is time
now for the United States to rec
ognize the forward movement
sweeping the Orient, separate that
movement from Communism, and
work for and with the Chinese ac
cordingly.
Dr. Buss has been in Asia for the
past two quarters. He has seen the
masses of discontented beings that
swarm the streets of Shanghai. The
streets are so crowded he could
hardly make his way through the
hicycle-propelled rickshaws.
Throughout the land discontent
ment seethes. The people are starv
ing and crowded, but more than that
they're tired. Too weary for rebel
lion now. they, don't care who gov
erns them. The men negotiating
with the Communists are not wild
eyed revolutionists; they are as
respectab'e as the reputation of
Chiang himself.
British policy also seems to be
directed along a middle of the road
attitude toward the Chinese Com
munists. If a new coalition govern
ment is formed, Britain will gain
the benefits of such a policy.
