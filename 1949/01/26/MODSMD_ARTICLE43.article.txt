## 
### 
Bill Rose is back!
Getting the official okay yesterday afternoon, Big Bill Rose is
back in the run of things, as Stanford goes into its eighth weekend
of basketball against San Jose State and the Pittsburgh Panthers
from far-away Pennsylvania.
Rose, who was declared ineligible three weeks ago, has been

working out on his own every day, 1
and is in top shape to go back to*'
the grind. He was back at practice
last night.
Pepped up by the return of Rose,
the Indians went through two hours !
of snappy drilling last night, and
seemed to be in their best form so 1
fai this season.
San Jose Loaded
With giant-ki'ling San Jose and
far - traveling Pittsburgh on the |
weekend agenda, the Cards will
have to bear down to maintain their
llth-in-the-nation rating. Another j
double victory would suit Everett j
Dean just fine.
San Jose, which always points j
for Stanford, will be a tough cus
tomer to handle come Friday night.
In the midst of a mid-season hot
streak, the Staters have run up six
straight wins over Pepperdine, San !
Francisco '49ers, Fresno State, Ari
zona State, Nevada, and San Fran
cisco State.
Led by high-scoring Stu Inman,
the Spartans have a well-rounded
experienced quintet. Four of the
men playing were regulars on San
Jose's CCAA championship five of !
last season.
Inman Tops Spartans
Inman, a 6-3 center, has whipped
in 57 points in his last three games i

for a season lota! of 280 and an
average of 1-4.7 per game. Last
season Inman set an all-time San
Jose season record by dumping in
39G points.
Coach Walt McPherson expects
Inman to eclipse his own record
Ihis season, as his present pace has
put him well ahead of where he was
last year at this time.
Other men featured in the Spar
tan attack include forwards Don
McCaslin and Bob Hagcn. McCas
lin has scored 192 points for a 10.1
average, while Hagen has piled up
18f> for a 10.3 average. McCaslin, a
transfer from San Mateo, is the tall
est man on the squad at six feet
four inches.
Average Is (i-2
Every man on the Spartan first
team is over six feet, with the entire
team averaging 6-2. San Jose spe
cializes on defense and ball-han
dling. very seldom jumping into the
fast break. Their main ofTense is
molded around their pivot man, the
fast-scoring Stu Inman.
Looking back at Stanford's nar
row 54 to 50 of last year, it would
appear that the Cards are in for a
real battle Friday night.
Playing on the small Pavilion
hardwood against a defensive-spe
cializing club, the Deanmen have
for themselves a rugged job.

Other men featured in the Spar
tan attack include forwards Don
McCaslin and Bob Hagcn. McCas
lin has scored 192 points for a 10.1
average, while Hagen has piled up
18f> for a 10.3 average. McCaslin, a
transfer from San Mateo, is the tall
est man on the squad at six feet
four inches.
Average Is (i-2
Every man on the Spartan first
team is over six feet, with the entire
team averaging 6-2. San Jose spe
cializes on defense and ball-han
dling. very seldom jumping into the
fast break. Their main ofTense is
molded around their pivot man, the
fast-scoring Stu Inman.
Looking back at Stanford's nar
row 54 to 50 of last year, it would
appear that the Cards are in for a
real battle Friday night.
Playing on the small Pavilion
hardwood against a defensive-spe
cializing club, the Deanmen have
for themselves a rugged job.
Bill Rose is back!
Getting the official okay yesterday afternoon, Big Bill Rose is
back in the run of things, as Stanford goes into its eighth weekend
of basketball against San Jose State and the Pittsburgh Panthers
from far-away Pennsylvania.
Rose, who was declared ineligible three weeks ago, has been

working out on his own every day, 1
and is in top shape to go back to*'
the grind. He was back at practice
last night.
Pepped up by the return of Rose,
the Indians went through two hours !
of snappy drilling last night, and
seemed to be in their best form so 1
fai this season.
San Jose Loaded
With giant-ki'ling San Jose and
far - traveling Pittsburgh on the |
weekend agenda, the Cards will
have to bear down to maintain their
llth-in-the-nation rating. Another j
double victory would suit Everett j
Dean just fine.
San Jose, which always points j
for Stanford, will be a tough cus
tomer to handle come Friday night.
In the midst of a mid-season hot
streak, the Staters have run up six
straight wins over Pepperdine, San !
Francisco '49ers, Fresno State, Ari
zona State, Nevada, and San Fran
cisco State.
Led by high-scoring Stu Inman,
the Spartans have a well-rounded
experienced quintet. Four of the
men playing were regulars on San
Jose's CCAA championship five of !
last season.
Inman Tops Spartans
Inman, a 6-3 center, has whipped
in 57 points in his last three games i

for a season lota! of 280 and an
average of 1-4.7 per game. Last
season Inman set an all-time San
Jose season record by dumping in
39G points.
Coach Walt McPherson expects
Inman to eclipse his own record
Ihis season, as his present pace has
put him well ahead of where he was
last year at this time.
