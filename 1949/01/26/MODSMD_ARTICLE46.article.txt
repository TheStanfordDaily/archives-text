## Thru Breier's Pipe 
### 
Today is question day as far as this reporter is concerned. Sports col
umnists usually try to give with hot poop and let their readers in on all
the inside dope, but today let's ask a lew questions.
Why is it that the Stanford programs are the poorest in the Conference?
Why is it that we pay a quarter for a six- or eight-page football program
and get the same old pictures every week? Other schools charge the same
price but the product they deliver is far superior to that put out by Stan-'
ford.
And why are our basketball programs so inadequate? Granted that
some schools charge a small sum for the programs and Stanford gives them
away free. But why was it that when a top-flight prep team such as
Lowell High played the Farm Freshmen basketball team the high schoolers
didn't rate a spot on the program? The Pavilion was filled during the last
half of the preliminary game. There had been a lot of publicity on Lowell
and its star, Kenny Flower, as well as the rest of the squad. Was there
a .PA. system? No. Everyone around us was asking, "Who was
that? Who made that shot?" and so on. This isn't the only instance of
ncglect in regard to programs or publicity releases.
Same for Boxing Fans
No information was readily available to the boxing fans who attended
the Stanford-Cal Poly match two weeks ago. It wouldn't have taken much
time, effort, or money to put out a program containing such information
as the names of the boxers, their weights, number of fights, number won
and lost. etc. But fans had to suffer through the matches with no knowl
edge about the fighters except name and weight division .... which
was given through a Roos Bros, megaphone. Shall we go on, or do you
want to add a few gripes of your own?
It has been a policy of this column to refrain from snap judgments. All
too often does a matter come up that seems to demand immediate attention.
We are asked. "Why don't you write something about so-and-so? He did
this or didn't do that." On the surface it often seems that the charge de
serves airing via The Daily sports columns.
Try to Look Before Leap
But closer examination usually brings out the other side of the argu
ment. The person so charged can usually give a pretty good explanation
for his actions or lack of such.
But we've been noticing the poor quality, and quantity, or the press
releases and programs for going on three years now and the Lowell High
incident only served to aggravate matters. Another question .... Will
something be done about it? We think not.
And why is a certain Econ prof so tough about football players missing
quizzes when they leave on Friday morning for a game away from home?
More than one gridder flunked or got a "D" because of missing classes
while traveling. Of course their low grades weren't due entirely to missed
class time, but it seems that sdme exceptions could be made.
On a general theme, why is basketball suffering at the gate? Less than
;, 'OO persons were on hand lor an American Basketball League game be
tween the Oakland Bittners and Sacramento Jets. The Bittners are one
of the best, if not the best, AAU team in the country. They don't play
Phillips Oilers this year but could probably take them two out of three
games. Still, they have played to crowds of less than 150 people this year.
Madison Square Garden in New York has had but one packed house this
season. And it took the University of Kentucky to do it.
We ran into Frank Walsh, the man who talked the Cow Palace people
into running basketball games in their building, at the USF game the
other night.
W alsli Talk About Ileal
Mr. Walsh is the first to admit that all is not well with basketball at
tendance. The Cow Palace has suffered even more than most game sites.
The unusually cold weather and lack of a heating system at the big
Geneva Avenue building have kept the customers away in droves.
But. said the amiable Walsh, "we will have a heating system next
year. He said that the Westinghouse people were examining the Cow
Palace to determine just what kind of heating installation will be most
efficient.
Besides, claims Walsh, when nine or ten thousand people get together
in one building, the temperature of the place rises quite a bit through
body heat alone. Could be.
Want to Settle Arguments?
A gem in the way of record booklets has been received by The Daily
from the PCC Commissioner's OfTice. H. D. Thoreau, a former Daily
Bull Scssioner, compiled and edited the work that contains the compe
tition records of the PCC teams in eight major sports. From now on
you will be Seeing excerpts from Thoreau's brainchild in the form of
fillers. There is a real wealth of information .... the kind from which
you can write a story or ;i two-line filler.
For instance, we note that Stanford's Hank Luisetti and Jim Pollard
1 ate the All-time Southern Division basketball team along with Don
Barksdale and Frank Lubin of UCLA and Eddie Oram ofUSC. Cali
fornia didn't rate.
