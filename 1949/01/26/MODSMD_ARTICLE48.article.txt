PULLMAN. Wash., Jan. 25 </P)—
Every time the Washington State
College Cougars win a Northern Di
vision basketball title they look up —
and there is Stanford.
The Cougars are a long way from
a Northern Division title yet—al
though they are undefeated in five
Conference games. Anything could
happen in the Southern Division,
too, before the two regions send their
top teams to a Pacific Coast Confer
ence playoff.
Cougars Arc 14th
But when the Cougars were
ranked 14th in the nation this week
in an Associated Press poll, they
noted that the team dubbed most
likely to succeed in the Southern
Division was Stanford, ranked 11th
nationally.
Washington State won twice in the
north. Both times it met the In
dians in the playoffs.
The Cougars won their first North
ern title in 1937. They lost the play
offs to Stanford. They won again in
the north in 1941 and took the Coast
crown from Stanford.
Three Coast Titles
The Indians have won three other
Coast titles since the league was di
vided ill 1922. They beat Washington
in 193G. Oregon in 1938 and Oregon
State in 1942.
But to the Cougars it just wouldn't
seem right to have some other Cali
fornia team win in the South the
same year they win up North.
They're getting used to playing Stan
ford.
