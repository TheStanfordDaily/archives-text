# Thread and Needle Wielded By Men in Costuming Class
## 
### SHIRLEY ELLSWORTH 
"Does my hem hang evenly?" "Are these stitches straight
enough on this dress?" Nothing odd about such guestions in a
sewing class, you say? No. except that these typical comments
are being uttered by decidedly masculine voices!
Speech and Drama 71, Theory of Costume, is reguired for all

undergraduate speech and dram;,
students, including the men. But thi
male members of the class seem to
take their work very seriously. And
they all wield a mean needle!
Males Predominate
The predominantly male class han
dles costuming for all the produc
tions of the Stanford Players. At
present members are working on
Two shows, "Build No Fence Around
Me" and"The Relapse." They have
just completed work on "The Hairy
Ape."
The classroom, located in Memorial
Hall, abounds in sewing machines,
irons, a dressmaker form, and similar
tailoring facilities. An additional
workroom for sewing and a well
.supplied dye room complete the
equipment. Elaborately gowned cos
tume dolls for each period are used
for costume study and reference.
Miss Virginia Opsvig, on leave for
the quarter, is the regular instruc
tor. In her absence, Miss Rebecca
Grimes and Mr. O. G. Brockett
have charge of the class.
Quartet at Work
On a typical afternoon four young ;
men were grouped around a large
table in the center of the room,
needle and thread in hand, busily |
pinning in hems and insets, applying 1
blue ribbon decoration to garments,
putting the finishing touches on as
sorted clothing, and conferring on
color schemes.
As one tall, well-built young man
entered the classroom and sat down,
he opened his wallet and carefully j
removed a needle. He_threaded it
after a mere two attempts, and took
up his sewing. "You can never tell
when something like this will be
handy!" he quipped.
Still another man was vigorously

ripping out a scam. Instead of using
scissors, he was applying brute force,
and the feeble thread was no match
for his sturdy biceps. His companion
exhibited a bright yellow thimble.
Complete Wardrobes
Dresses, skirts, coats, trousers,
shirts, hats—nothing (except an ape
skin, which is being rented for the
play opening tonight), is too compli
cated for these industrious workers.
Each show is costumed completely,
and "each outfit is saved, thus build
ing up the stock continually. Al
ready an entire storeroom in the
basement of Memorial Auditorium
is overflowing with clothing of all
sizes and descriptions.
The storeroom boasts of costumes
for almost every period, including
numerous Shakespearean outfits.
Dozens of shelves of hats and easily
200 pairs of shoes are arranged
around the walls. At least 150 feet
of completely-filled costume racks
crowd the center of the room.

Quartet at Work
On a typical afternoon four young ;
men were grouped around a large
table in the center of the room,
needle and thread in hand, busily |
pinning in hems and insets, applying 1
blue ribbon decoration to garments,
putting the finishing touches on as
sorted clothing, and conferring on
color schemes.
As one tall, well-built young man
entered the classroom and sat down,
he opened his wallet and carefully j
removed a needle. He_threaded it
after a mere two attempts, and took
up his sewing. "You can never tell
when something like this will be
handy!" he quipped.
Still another man was vigorously

ripping out a scam. Instead of using
scissors, he was applying brute force,
and the feeble thread was no match
for his sturdy biceps. His companion
exhibited a bright yellow thimble.
Complete Wardrobes
Dresses, skirts, coats, trousers,
shirts, hats—nothing (except an ape
skin, which is being rented for the
play opening tonight), is too compli
cated for these industrious workers.
Each show is costumed completely,
and "each outfit is saved, thus build
ing up the stock continually. Al
ready an entire storeroom in the
basement of Memorial Auditorium
is overflowing with clothing of all
sizes and descriptions.
The storeroom boasts of costumes
for almost every period, including
numerous Shakespearean outfits.
Dozens of shelves of hats and easily
200 pairs of shoes are arranged
around the walls. At least 150 feet
of completely-filled costume racks
crowd the center of the room.
"Does my hem hang evenly?" "Are these stitches straight
enough on this dress?" Nothing odd about such guestions in a
sewing class, you say? No. except that these typical comments
are being uttered by decidedly masculine voices!
Speech and Drama 71, Theory of Costume, is reguired for all

undergraduate speech and dram;,
students, including the men. But thi
male members of the class seem to
take their work very seriously. And
they all wield a mean needle!
Males Predominate
The predominantly male class han
dles costuming for all the produc
tions of the Stanford Players. At
present members are working on
Two shows, "Build No Fence Around
Me" and"The Relapse." They have
just completed work on "The Hairy
Ape."
The classroom, located in Memorial
Hall, abounds in sewing machines,
irons, a dressmaker form, and similar
tailoring facilities. An additional
workroom for sewing and a well
.supplied dye room complete the
equipment. Elaborately gowned cos
tume dolls for each period are used
for costume study and reference.
