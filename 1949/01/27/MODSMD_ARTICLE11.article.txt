# 'Hairy Ape' Popularity Stays As Players Portray Tragedy
## 
### 
"The Hairy Ape" lurched along
the jagged lower edge o£ humanity
last night in the Little Theater with
all the virility and impact which
has made this play popular since
its birth in 1922.
R. R. Brown, director, shirked
from none of the striking, often al
most overpowering dramatic effect
created by Eugene O'Neill.
But something was given to the
production last night which en
riched it beyond the natural drive
of the play. Richard Kelton. play
ing a difficult transition role, gave
his role simple naive bewilderment
which greatly added to the pathetic
part of Yank.
His '"Where do I go from here?"
answered by society with a "Go to
hell," is the tragedy enacted against
the grotesqueness of jousting, rough
men who on a moment's notice turn
into a snarling, animal - like en
tanglement.
By far the best supporting role
was that of Bert Brauer as the
Cockney. James Haran also stood
high on the roster of characters, all
of whom turned in not only good
acting performances but also mas
tered a motley of foreign accents.
Harold Niven. who handled set

tings, is to be congratulated lor
adding quickness of scene change
j to the obvious talent he displayed
j in creating effective background.
Outstanding in the production
was the make-up care entailed in
| exaggerating the features of the
! players.
"The Hairy Ape" will play before
j sold-out houses again tonight, to
morrow night, Saturday afternoon,
and Saturday night.—Diar.e Jesser.
