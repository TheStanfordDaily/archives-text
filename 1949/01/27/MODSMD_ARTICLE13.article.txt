Icclared today the United States
must marshal new reserves of mili

what he called "reactionary" Com

Acheson, in his first news confer
ence as chief of the U.S. foreign
policy under President Truman, dis
cus-ed two main lines of action:
1. He said that a "very great" res
ervoir of private capital is available
to finance President Truman's new
pro /ram to raise the standard of liv
ing in backward areas of the world.
But he served notice that countries
desiring such help must create con
ditions "attractive" to private in
vest merit.
2. On the military front of the cold
war, Acheson endorsed the plans
worked out by former Secretary of
Slaie Marshall and retiring Under
secretary Lovett for a military al
liance with Western Europe.
He further indicated for the first
♦imc officially that the North At
lantic Defense Agreement, in nego
tiation for many months among the
United States, Canada, Britain,
France, Belgium, The Netherlands,
cind Luxembourg, is about com
pleted. He said that he hoped "to
be able very soon" to talk about it
in specific terms.
On established foreign policy prin
ciples, Acheson spoke out briefly
Jor cooperation with Republican
leaders such as Senator Vandenberg
(R-Mich.) and John Foster Dulles.
He promised to carry out the "good
neighbor" policy toward Latin
America; and he maintained the
hands-off attitude toward China by
declining to go beyond statements
already made by the President. Gen
eral Marshall and Undersecretary
Lovett.
