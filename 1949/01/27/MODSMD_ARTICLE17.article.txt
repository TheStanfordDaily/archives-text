The witness, C. Ellsworth (Dick)
Wylie, also said he once told How
ser that (the late) Leo (Duke) Bol
ger, Los Angeles political figure, "is
the Attorney General of this state
and you're not. He's becoming a
rich man and you're getting hardly
anything."

a "good will' tour in behalf of
Howser.

told Howser he should cut his con
