### 
LONDON. Jar. 2G </P). — The
House of Commons tonight voted
confidence in Foreign Secretary Er
nest Bevin's policy toward Israel.
With 50 Labor members abstain
ing, the House of Commons voted
233 to 193 for adjournment of full
dress debate on Palestine.
Before the vote was taken Attlee
also said that Britain had "accepted
in principle" the recognition of Is
rael.
It was the first major test the
Labor government had faced on
foreign policy.
It was a victory for Bevin, who
had said that recognition of Israel
may contribute to a peace settle
ment, but that he had withheld that
recognition for further international
consultation.
Bevin said Britain was consulting
with members of the British Com
monwealth and its Western Euro
pean Pact allies on the time for
such recognition.
"I am assuming that replies will
be in the next few days when the
final act will be taken," he said.
As to recognition, he said: "The
state of Israel is now a fact and we
(the Labor government) have not
tried or done anything to undo it."
British sources had forecast that
Britain would announce de facto
recognition of the Jewish state to
day. Both Bevin and Attlee made
clear that some steps must come
first.
