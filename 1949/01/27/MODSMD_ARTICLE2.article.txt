# Aid Request In Excom
## 
### 
A revival of the Commission for
Student Aid, composed of members
from the faculty, alumni, and stu
dent body, was proposed by Ted
Norton to Excom last night.
The commission would plan stu
dent aid, administer the scholar
ships, and raise funds to aid stu
dents. Norton stressed the necessity
of reinstituting this commission,
which was originally set up in 1934,
as some students have already left
school due to a lack of funds.
An additional request for $324 on
behalf of the lIR for the UN Edu
cation Center was denied by Excom
with the proviso that the lIR may
allocate funds budgeted for other
purposes to the Center.
John Pool, student manager,
stated that the ASSU must main
tain a certain surplus to care for
emergencies and lean years. The
lIR did not include this expenditure
in its original $3,810 budget. The
granting of continual additional
sums to all organizations that have
worthy purposes has to stop some
where, he said.
Sydney Morgan was appointed
Excom lumber of a committee of
Publications Committee and Ex
com that will investigate the Injun
Fun and Informer publications and
the costs of all student publications.
Excom approved the delegation
of the publication of the "Frosh
Bible" by Publications Committee
to Cardinals. Tiyouts for the edi
torship will be conducted by the
student manager, the president of
Cardinals, and another Cardinals
member.
Consideration of accepting the
music of "Buttons and Bows," as
offered by the owner of the rights
to the song, was withheld until next
