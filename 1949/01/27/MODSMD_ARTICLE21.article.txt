# Nationalists, Communists Countercharge Bad Faith

### 
NANKING, -Jan. 25 TK
Chinese government and the Com
munists accused each other of bad
talth today. As peace prospects
dimmed, the Nationalists hastily
tried to establish a new defense lint
south of the Yangtze.
The Communist radio asserted
Acting President Li Tsung-ien was
trying to Ret a breathing ypell while
organizing further resistance. It
called on him to show his good
faith by immediately detaining
war criminals.
(As heard and translated in
Shanghai, the broadcast called on
Li to "detain" Chiang Kai-shek and
other "war criminals.")
It was reported on high authority
that Chiang Kai-shek would return
to power should the peace talk
fizzle. This report came from
sources so high they can be con
sidered unimpeachable.
A government spokesman accused
the Communists of stalling. Re
called on the Reds to name peace
de'egates now and select a place
lor a conference.
Almost as though in answer to
rtus—although there was no direct
connection between the two state
ments—the Red radio said the Na
tionalists were plotting to distort
peace talks inot "a false peace."
The Nationalits were accused of
seeking "to preserve the strength of
the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaiy
bloc through fake negotiations."
A highly placed source, who
talked to Acting President Li to
day, said Li was trying to halt the
transfer of the government to Can
ton.
The Foreign Office mnouneed
early today that all government
functions would cease in Nankinu
Feb. 3 and the new capital of gov
ernment-held China would be set
up at Canton, effective Feb. 5.
