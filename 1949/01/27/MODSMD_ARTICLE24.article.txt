## Too Fast A Pace? 
### 
In the Report of the President for 1947-48, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich
reported that danger lurks in the present demand of veterans and
older students for practical courses. If the universities were to
yield to any great extent, they would cease to be universities
find become vocational institutions, he said.
In training men and women for professions universities must
keep in mind the importance of basic as well as strictly profes
sional courses, and to provide such basic work adequately uni
versities must guard against an overemphasis upon one field of
study at the expense of other fields, Dr. Eurich added.
We think the President might have said something about the
stepped up pace of today's universities.
Of course, it all started with the veteran influx and the postwar
college jam. Professors enjoyed having lots of eager students.
Both students and professors increased the pace.
But in many cases we believe the pace has been stepped up
1o the limit. In a number of courses the majority of nearly every
one's time is spent on work for work's sake, getting just enough
material to pass an examination. There is not half as much time
any more for the exchange of ideas (bull sessions, if you wish).
Dr. Houck, director of the Health Service, thinks students aren't
having enough fun.
Other highly placed persons on the faculty admit that the
faculty has been spoiled, and that they can't continue to pour it
on the younger students.
Probably no one would want to lower Stanford's high stand
ards. But the strain should be slacked somehow. Perhaps some
changes could be made in the structure of classes.
For example, we've noticed that in some courses the identical
material has been tailored to fit 6, 8, or 10 weeks. How about
abandoning the curve in those classes, cut the course to 6 weeks,
then put the best students to work either coaching the poorer
members or on independent study for the last 4 weeks. This
would keep classes from always being geared to the average
student.
Also, is there any point in flunking a student in required
courses? It seems reasonable to suppose that if a person passes
the entrance tests to Stanford, he should be able to pass any
course.
