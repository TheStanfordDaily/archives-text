At the Cal game (there) Stanford was giving a yell. At the end Cal
echoed over "Louder." A Stanford rough in the middle section stood up

Then out at the Village chow line one of the lads looked at the semi
gelatinous mass broadly labeled dessert, then asked one of the dieticians,

Recently a man leaving the theater threw a coin into the veil and said,
"1 wish I hadn't seen that picture. . . ."
The last word in a closed car is ... . "NO "
Man leaving church telling his wife, "Nice sermon. For once I didn't
