THE EMBERS STILL BURN, by
Ira Hirschmann (Simon and
Schuster)
Ira Hirschmann, accompanying
the late Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia
to post-war Europe as an UNRRA
official, records his impressions and
criticisms, all leveled against the
United States policy, General Clay,
British and American officials, and,
indirectly, the Marshall Plan.
That Hirschmann wants miracles
worked in Europe is commendable,
but that he has the temerity to
expect them over night and to
damn the officials like General Clay
who quite obviously didn't have the
time to listen to the sell' - styled
emancipator or the means or the
authority to carry them out, is un
fair, unrealistic, and inexcusable.
Contradictions
Moreover, ideologically, Hirsch
mann contradicts himself. He first
bitterly criticizes the United States
for not building more DP camps,
not immediately recognizing Jew
ish claims in Palestine, not run
ning their section of Germany more
efficiently (Russia runs theirs beau
tifully, not being particularly fussy
as to whom they draft to work in
the mines), and being too selective.
Also, he does not approve of Amer
ica's ideas about building up Ger
many.
After saying all this, after mak
ing the demands upon the govern
ment, he then reverses himself and
says that the U.S. should not inter
fere directly at all. All work should
be done through the UN. He ig
nores the fact that Russia's veto will
prevent the UN from doing any
thing near what Ira Hirschmann
demands.
Fascist Embers
What Hirschmann is still harping
on is the fact that the embers of
fascism still burn. Communism, on
the other hand, he does not consider
to be a hostile force. According to
him, we can get along with Russia,
but we cannot "bargain" efficiently
with Germany, which we hold un
der military occupation.
Another inconsistency is that
Hirschmann wishes unity, econom
ic recovery, and peace for Europe.
But at the same time he wishes to
see Germany divided, disenfran
chised. and economically prostrate.
