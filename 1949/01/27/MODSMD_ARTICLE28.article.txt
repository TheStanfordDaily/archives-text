# Preacher Is 'Angel' For Bankrupt Weekly
## 
### HAL BOYLE 
BAY MI NET TE, Ala. (/P).—Way
faring preachers have saved many
souls. But only one I ever heard of
saved a weekly newspaper.
He saved it for a friend of mine.
Jimmy Faulkner, publisher of the
Baldwin Times. And today when
Jimmy talks about the Good Sa
maritan to his Sunday school class,
the .old Bible tale has a special
meaning to him.
It's quite a story. And Jimmy is
quite a story, too. At 20 he was
one of the youngest weekly pub
lishers in the country. He was also
at 23, as head of the Alabama Press
Association, probably the youngest
ever to head a state press group. At
24 he was reported the youngest
mayor in America.
'Soft' War Job
When the war came alons* Jimmy
was in a position to grab for some
thing easy. But he volunteered as a
private in the Air Corps and be
came a B-25 bomber pilot instruc
tor.
Now at 32 he is a member of the
State Democratic Executive Com
mittee. and a rising figure in Ala
bama politics.
Jimmy is a symbol of the new
tumult in the South. He thinks the
excitement over the race issue is
less important to the future welfare
of the section than the permanent
educational and economic improve
ment of its people—black as well as
white. And he thinks conditions
are improving rapidly.
College Life
When I first knew Jimmy we
were roommates at the University
of Missouri, which had the oldest
and one of the best journalism
schools in the land. He earned his
way by hopping tables and wiping
dishes, and working in the school
library.
Then he came back home.
He was 20 years old. He owed
$500 and he couldn't find a job.
Then he heard the weekly Baldwin

County Times? was for sale here.
His widowed mother volunteered to
mortgage her home to raise the
down payment. He bought the pa
jper. But it was run down. To im
prove it more money had to be
borrowed.
Early to Debt . . .
"I owed more than $12,000 before
I was 21," Jimmy recalled. "The
mortgages were falling due, and I
had no money to tide me over."
About this time a traveling
preaeher came into Jimmy's office
to ask for a small news story about
the revival. He was tired and his
suit had wrinkles. He looked hun
gry, so Jimmy invited him to his
house for breakfast.
That was the only time he saw
the preacher. But some weeks later
he received a letter from him say
ing:
"I am impressed with what you
are trying to do in your town, and
it occurred to me you might need
some money."
Another Cheek
Jimmy didn't think the man was
in a position to help. But when he
answered and said he was in a tight
spot, back came a check for $1,000.
Later he sent another check for
$1,000.
"Without his help I would have
lost my newspaper," said Jimmy.
"Yet I met this man only once, and
he didn't ask for security of any
kind. He was the angel in my life. - '
Those lean years are past now.
Jimmy repaid the stranger — with
interest. But it taught him this life
long lesson:
"Kindness begets kindness. There
is no excuse for being on this earth
unless we help our fellow man.
And there is no excuse for a news
paper unless it helps to make its
community better."
Jimmy does try to live up to the
stranger's example.
And he has what he war ts—hap
piness in a small town with the
people he knows.

and one of the best journalism
schools in the land. He earned his
way by hopping tables and wiping
dishes, and working in the school
library.
Then he came back home.
He was 20 years old. He owed
$500 and he couldn't find a job.
Then he heard the weekly Baldwin

County Times? was for sale here.
His widowed mother volunteered to
mortgage her home to raise the
down payment. He bought the pa
jper. But it was run down. To im
prove it more money had to be
borrowed.
Early to Debt . . .
"I owed more than $12,000 before
I was 21," Jimmy recalled. "The
mortgages were falling due, and I
had no money to tide me over."
About this time a traveling
preaeher came into Jimmy's office
to ask for a small news story about
the revival. He was tired and his
suit had wrinkles. He looked hun
gry, so Jimmy invited him to his
house for breakfast.
That was the only time he saw
the preacher. But some weeks later
he received a letter from him say
ing:
"I am impressed with what you
are trying to do in your town, and
it occurred to me you might need
some money."
Another Cheek
Jimmy didn't think the man was
in a position to help. But when he
answered and said he was in a tight
spot, back came a check for $1,000.
Later he sent another check for
$1,000.
"Without his help I would have
lost my newspaper," said Jimmy.
"Yet I met this man only once, and
he didn't ask for security of any
kind. He was the angel in my life. - '
Those lean years are past now.
Jimmy repaid the stranger — with
interest. But it taught him this life
long lesson:
"Kindness begets kindness. There
is no excuse for being on this earth
unless we help our fellow man.
And there is no excuse for a news
paper unless it helps to make its
community better."
Jimmy does try to live up to the
stranger's example.

Jimmy Faulkner, publisher of the
Baldwin Times. And today when
Jimmy talks about the Good Sa
maritan to his Sunday school class,
the .old Bible tale has a special
meaning to him.
It's quite a story. And Jimmy is
quite a story, too. At 20 he was
one of the youngest weekly pub
lishers in the country. He was also
at 23, as head of the Alabama Press
Association, probably the youngest
ever to head a state press group. At
24 he was reported the youngest
mayor in America.
'Soft' War Job
When the war came alons* Jimmy
was in a position to grab for some
thing easy. But he volunteered as a
private in the Air Corps and be
came a B-25 bomber pilot instruc
tor.
Now at 32 he is a member of the
State Democratic Executive Com
mittee. and a rising figure in Ala
bama politics.
Jimmy is a symbol of the new
tumult in the South. He thinks the
excitement over the race issue is
less important to the future welfare
of the section than the permanent
educational and economic improve
ment of its people—black as well as
white. And he thinks conditions
are improving rapidly.
