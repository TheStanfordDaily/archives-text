That Germany must also be rebuilt
if a Western Union is to be estab
lished is self-evident. While Hirsch
mann preaches a doctrine of ap
peasing Russia, he wishes Germany
to go through a period like the re
construction of South Carolina in
1865-75. The futility of such a pro
gram should be obvious.
Berlin Airlift
It would be interesting to read
Hirschmann's view of the Berlin

Airlift. That also he would prob
ably criticize. It is actually impos
sible to relate all of the inconsis
tencies in Hirschmann's diatribe.
The one apparent fact is that
Hirschmann's book must be about
as welcome to this nation's foreign
policy as are the views expounded
by Henry Wallace. Or, slated an
other way, the book is 1 about as
helpful as a toothache.
