WASHINGTON. Jan. 26 (£>). — A
battle royal lies ahead in Congress
on the hot subject of compulsory
health insurance.
The plan to tax the nation's
workers and their employers to pay
hospital and doctors' bills has stir
red vehement feelings, pro and con.
On one side are administration
men who say millions can't afford
good medical care, and the govern
ment must step in.
On the other are those who con
tend that "socialized" medicine
would ruin the quality of medical
care and saddle the taxpayers with
burdens running into billions of
dollars.
Congressional views on the
chances of health insurance being
enacted this year are as far apart
as the poles.
Senator Murray (D., Mont.) and
Rep. Dingell (D., Mich.)—sponsors
of identical bills for compulsory in
surance—take the optimistic view.
Election Indicates Desire
Murray says the election of Pres
ident Truman, who has repeatedly
championed such a system, consti
tutes evidence that the people want
a government health plan.
Also, he says,"the decision of the
American Medical Association to
raise a $3,500,000 political fund to
oppose the plan openly should help
our case in the public mind."
(The AMA's House of Delegates
voted in December to assess each of

the association's 110,000 members
525 to finance what is described as
a campaign to educate Americans
on the progress of medicine. Dr.
George F. Lull, AMA secretary, la
ter criticized "government-paid in
formation experts" for calling the
fund a "war chest or propaganda
fund.")
Chances Very Good
Dingell says chances of enactment
of compulsory health insurance leg
islation are "very good" because of
the Democratic complexion of Con
gress.
On the other side of the picture,
influential House Republicans pro
fess to see little chance for enact
ment of any compulsory program
because of the tax features.
Rep. Judcl (R., Minn.), a doctor,
told a reporter:
"This is the wrong solution to the
problem of national health. Com
pulsory health programs would re
duce incentive to continue improve
ments in medical care. The right
way is through voluntary insur
ance systems."
Senator Taft Opposes
Senator Taft (R„ Ohio) —long a
vigorous opponent of compulsory
health insurance — today disclosed
plans to introduce a bill of his own
aimed at the nation's health needs.
Taft did not reveal whether his
bi'l will be the same as one he in
troduced in the last Congress. That
bill favored the extension of vol
untary private insurance plans. It
also proposed a system of outright
federal grants up to $200,000,000 a
year to allow states to provide free

medical care for those unable to
pay for it.
Neither Taft's bill nor the rival,
compulsory health insurance pro
posal introduced by Senator Mur
ray and others in the last Congress
ever- came to a vote.
125 Million Covered
The bill introduced in the Senate
(his session by Senators Murray,
McGrath (D., R. 1.), and Wagner (D..
N.Y.) calls for compulsory health
insurance for 125,000.000 workers
and their dependents—about 85 per
cent of the population.
Rep. Dingell's House bill is the
same, and so is another House bill
introduced by Rep. Celler (D.,
N.Y.). No hearings have been an
nounced on any of these.
President Truman has endorsed
the 10-year multi-billion national
health plan drafted by Federal Se
curity Administrator Oscar Ewing.
The "keystone" of this plan is a
compulsory health insurance pro
posal.
Only Workable Way
And the President, in his State
of - the - Union message, declared:
"National health insurance is tin
only workable way to assure that
all individuals have access to the
medical care they need."
But the President has not yet
proposed specific legislation cover
ing all phases of a social security
and health program.
Meanwhile. Senator Hill (D..
Ala.) said he may offer a Philadel
phia doctor's medical care plan as
a substitute for the administration's
program.
