# Constitution Discussions Tonight
## 
### 
The ASSU judiciary system will
be reviewed tonight at 7 in the audi
torium of the Women's Clubhouse
in the second open hearing on the
new ASSU Constitution.
Mark Hatfield, chairman of the
constitution committee, urged stu
dents to attend the discussion of the
present system with regard to possi
ble improvements.
An appellate court composed of
both students and faculty which
would serve both Men's and Wom
en's Councils has been suggested to
the committee as a possible solution
for the problem of appeals, said Hat
field. At present, the only appeal is
the Dean of Students.
The new constitution will come
before an all-student vote sometime
next month.
