# Farm Health Service Program Includes Chest Examinations
## 
### 
A year ago the Stanford Health
Service bought the latest in photo
fluoroscopic X-ray machines. At
that time Dr. George Houck, Health
Service director, wanted to take
chest X-rays of every student every
year—a goal that was impossible
to reach until the installation of the
new machine.
Dr. Houck's intensive chest sur
vey program has since then devel
oped into a potent preventive
weapon against tuberculosis, and has
also provided supporting proof for
the fairly new idea that TB is not
the only cause of lung calcification.
The Health Service has found
among students many cases of lung
calcification which have not been
due to TB, but have been caused
by two relatively mild diseases:
valley fever and histoplasmosis.

The former centers around the Sun
Joaquin Valley, Arizona, and Nt*v. p
Mexico. Histoplasmosis is mainly ot
Midwestern origin. Both diseases
cure themselves and cause lung cal
cification similar to that of TB.
According to Dr. Houck, the
Health Service has been able to tell
almost 100 students that they have
never had TB—that any traces ol
healed infection in their lungs were
caused by a harmless disease.
"It gives a person a rude jolt to
be told he has once had TB," Dr.
Houck said. "Now it develops that
many people have been told this
unnecessarily in the the past, and
have worried without cause. The
chest survey program has enabled
us to nip these false alarms in the
bud."
