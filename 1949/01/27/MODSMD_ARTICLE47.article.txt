# Dave Stars in Third Varsity Year
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Dave "Ding" Davidson, Stanford's
rugged and dependable guard, is
one of the main reasons behind the
present 15-2 record of Everett Dean's
varsity basketball club.
Davidson, one of the two mar
ried men on the club, has been first
string guard for three years, start
ing in 1946. During his sophomore
year, he captained the team, and
was very much in evidence as' Sta
nford took USC. 3 out of 4, and split
with UCLA, champ of the Southern
Division that year.
Last year, Dave was bothered by
an assortment of flu and virus-X
germs that hit him at odd times dur
ing the season, and he never did
hit top form.
Hit 23 Against Michigan
Even so, he was one of the top
guards on the Coast. This season,

he lias been crowding greatness.
Turning in a brilliant game against
Michigan, lie led the Cards to an
important Victory by dumping in 23
points in a close, 53-51, contest.
Against Yale, it was Davidson who
broke Eli's back by grabbing 11
quick points just as the second half
opened. Yale never recovered.
Against Southern Division foes he
has been just as devastating. He
Hipped in 59 points in 1 lie first four
games, and leads all guards as well
as being second in total Southern
Division scoring.
However, Dave's true worth is not
in his point-making. He is a scrap
per. a hard worker who goes after
the ball, and doesn't quit until the
final gun. Tough on the boards, Dave
is also a steady floor man, a fancy
passer, and boasts an uncanny ofT
balance drive shot
He demonstrated his alertness in
the first Cal game when he noticed
that Bill Hagler, the Bear center,
was overplaying Steve on pass-ins
to the key. He called a time-out,
talked things over with Steve, and
on the next play completely fooled
Hagler, as Stephenson got in back
of him for an easy two points.
