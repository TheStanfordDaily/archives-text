# Pittsburgh Basketballers Face Indians In San Francisco's Cow Palace Saturday
## Pitt Beat Cards 22-11 in '32 Fiasco 
### JOHN HALL 
Pittsburgh's lumbering Panthers,
knee-deep in defeats and train tick
ets, will stop off at the Cold Palace
Saturday night long enough to draw
their guns and fire away at Stan
lord's llth-in-the-nation cage rat
ing.
Dr. 11. C. Carlson, the gentleman
who has mixed basketball and ice
cream for 28 years at Pitt, will be
at the helm when his far-traveling
casaba experts invade the coast for
the first time since 1932. At that
time, Pilt knocked over Stanford,
22 to 11.
Famed for his theory that ice
cream is the ideal ingredient for
hard-working basketballers, Coach
Carlson keeps a large supply of the
stuff, and his boys have Eskimo
pies every night after practice.
Carlson Boasts Good Record
Doc Carlson, considered to be
one of the all-time greats in the
coaching profession, is the inventor
of the famous "figure 8" weave, and
has accomplished creditable work in
health and hygiene. Pitt teams have
won 323 and lost 187 under his 29-
year reign.
His 1949 outfit doesn't measure up
to past products, but as the record
indicates, is very capable of giving
a good account of itself.
So far the Panthers have won 8
and lost 4. They have beaten Penn
State, Bethany, Florida, Carnegie
Tech, Miami. Allegheny, and Army,
and have dropped games to Michi
gan (62-44), North Carolina State
(77-42), and Bradley (52-50).
David and Canterna Sparkle
Led by two trigger-fast forwards,
Sammy David (6-2) and Oland
Canterna (6-1), Pitt bases most of
its offense on a fast break, and likes
to keep the ball moving.
David and Canterna are return
ing lettermen. and co-captain the
squad. The other boys are new.
Mort Lerner. 6-foot 3 and slow,
works the pivot, and Bob Baumbeck
(6-2) and George McCrossin (6-0)
hanudle the guard positions.
Notorious for not being able to
control the boards, the .small Pan
thers go in for ball-stealing and
cat-like defensive tactics. Par
ticularly entertaining to watch is
chunky George Bromanik, 5 - foot
6-inch sub guard, who sees a lot of
action in every game.
Long Time
In the midst of a lengthy road
frip that will keep them on the go
for over a month, the Panthers will
make stops in Denver, Salt Lake
City, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Tucson, and then finally home.
Friday night Pittsburgh will
meet California in the first game of
a Cold Palace double-header that
a'so features St. Mary's Kudelkas
playing Arizona State.
Saturday night it will be Stan
ford meeting Pittsburgh, and USF
facing Arizona State.
Pavilion Play Hot
In the meantime, Stanford's old
men have been whooping it up dur
ing practice drills at the Pavilion.
Looking sharp and fit, the varsity
went through a rugged scrimmage
session yesterday, and appeared
capable of stretching their record
to 17 out of 19 by cereal-time Sat
urday night.
George Yard ley is looking great
again, especially on the business
end of a new screen play that Ev
erett Dean devised to give the for
wards more movement. He is hit
ting from all angles, and is re
bounding and tipping as he (lit! be
fore his knee injury.
Assistant Coach Bobby Burnett
stated last night that Stanford
seems to be in better shape now
than at any time this season. He
thinks that the boys have the hustle
and pep now that will be needed "to
carry them over the rough spots.

His 1949 outfit doesn't measure up

So far the Panthers have won 8

David and Canterna Sparkle
Led by two trigger-fast forwards,
Sammy David (6-2) and Oland
Canterna (6-1), Pitt bases most of
its offense on a fast break, and likes
to keep the ball moving.
David and Canterna are return
ing lettermen. and co-captain the
squad. The other boys are new.
Mort Lerner. 6-foot 3 and slow,
works the pivot, and Bob Baumbeck
(6-2) and George McCrossin (6-0)
hanudle the guard positions.
Notorious for not being able to
control the boards, the .small Pan
thers go in for ball-stealing and
cat-like defensive tactics. Par
ticularly entertaining to watch is
chunky George Bromanik, 5 - foot
6-inch sub guard, who sees a lot of
action in every game.
Long Time
In the midst of a lengthy road

for over a month, the Panthers will

Pavilion Play Hot
In the meantime, Stanford's old
men have been whooping it up dur

Looking sharp and fit, the varsity

Assistant Coach Bobby Burnett
stated last night that Stanford
seems to be in better shape now
than at any time this season. He
thinks that the boys have the hustle
and pep now that will be needed "to
carry them over the rough spots.
