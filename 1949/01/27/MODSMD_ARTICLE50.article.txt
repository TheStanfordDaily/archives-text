### BILL SWIGART Daily Sports Editor 
The inconsistency of newspaper
sports polls was shown up again this i
week when Stanford's up-and- :
coming casaba team, which soundly
whipped the USF Dons on the bas- j
ketball floor Friday night, ran sec- j
ond to the Hilltoppers in the latest
national rankings.
Since the llth-place Cards and the
9th-place Dons have similar 15-2
records against substantially equal
equal competition, we must confess
that such reasoning is a little beyond
us. But considering the big press
buildup that USF has been getting
this season and the manner in which
the Associated Press poll is taken,
we can't say that it surprised us.
Once a week sportswriters and
broadcasters from all over the coun
try submit their nominations for the
nation's 10 best college cage teams.
The votes are tabulated on a point
basis and the results are released as
being a consensus of the country's
top teams.
The unique thing about these con- :
sensus rankings is that they seldom
reflect the true comparative ability j
of the teams or coincide with the i
opinion of the average fan.
But as long as uneven ballot dis
tribution and pork barrel voting pre
vail there's no hope for much im
provement.
Casting a jaundiced eye over the
Associated Press selections, here's I
the way they look to us:
1. St. Louis—Led by cover boy
Easy Ed Macauley, the most publi
cized player since Doak Walker, the
bouncing Billikens from St. Louis
have forced their way into the na
tional spotlight position occupied for
the past two years by Kentucky's
Wildcats. To date the Billikens have
won 12 and lost but one—an unbe
lievably low scoring 29 to 27 over
time contest to Oklahoma A&M. For
our money, Kentucky still has the
better ball club, but any one of the
top three is good enough to finish
the year in the number one spot.
2. Kentucky—The snarling Wild
cats fell into disfavor with the na
tions sportscribes by dropping a two
point Sugar Bowl Tournament con- ;
test to St. Louis. But Adolph Rupp's
boys haven't been pressed since and
will te right back up there if the
leaders blow another one.
Oklahoma A&M—C oach Henry
Iba's squad climbed to its rightful
spot in the top three by outwitting
St. Louis last week. The Aggies j
lost two early-season games but are j
on their way now and may not drop
any more. They don't score much, I
but probably have the best defensive j
record in the country.
4. Western Kentucky—A good lit
tle ball club in its own league, West
ern Kentucky has gained national i
prominence by going undefeated for
15 games. However, its league isn't
very tough, and we don't think the !
Hilltoppers' undefeated record would
last very long in the big time. A
good bet for 12th or 15th place, !
maybe, but not 4th.
5. Minnesota — Undefeated in 13 i
starts this year, the Gophers deserve
a better place on the ladder. The :
Minnesota five prides itself on its j
defensive play, but scores a few it
:-elf every now and then with the |

result that the Bit> Niners have pol
ished oft some of the best squads in
the Middle West. May be the top
team in the country.
6. 11l inois—Paced by the fabulous
Dike Eddleman, the Illini have come
up with a team reminiscent of fam
ous Whiz Kids. The high-scoring
Champaign five has lost only one
contest out of 13, and along with
Minnesota, will have quite a bit to
say about who the Big Nine cham
pion will be.
7. Mainline—Another little nobody
until basketball season comes along.
Ham line has been tackling the big
ones and making them fall. The
Pied Pipers have gone through 14
games and two tournaments without
suffering a loss against such com
petition as Texas Christian, Wyo
ming, Denver, and Loyola of Los
Angeles. Will probably stay unde
feated until they meet the Phillips
Oilers late next month.
8. Yillamna — Sporting a /flashy
11-0 record over fair eastQMjfrcompe
tion the Wildcats deserve the eighth
Spot in the ratings for the time being
anyway. May not have the stuff to
last through the post-season tourna
ments, however.
9. USF—The Dons built up a big
following during their successful
junket through the East—which ac
counts in part for their high ranking.
But the Hilltoppers have "lucked
out" in more games than one, and
with a heavy schedule remaining,
should drop out of the first 10 be
fore long.
10. Utah—A top-flight team with a
top-flight coach, the Utes (13-2) are
always tough. Buoyed up with a
double win over rival Wyoming last
weekend, Val Peterson's team looks
the c!a»s of the rugged Skyline Six
this year. Will he tough to dislodge.

buildup that USF has been getting
this season and the manner in which
the Associated Press poll is taken,
we can't say that it surprised us.
Once a week sportswriters and
broadcasters from all over the coun
try submit their nominations for the
nation's 10 best college cage teams.
The votes are tabulated on a point
basis and the results are released as
being a consensus of the country's
top teams.
The unique thing about these con- :
sensus rankings is that they seldom
reflect the true comparative ability j
of the teams or coincide with the i
opinion of the average fan.
But as long as uneven ballot dis
tribution and pork barrel voting pre
vail there's no hope for much im
provement.
Casting a jaundiced eye over the
Associated Press selections, here's I
the way they look to us:
1. St. Louis—Led by cover boy
Easy Ed Macauley, the most publi
cized player since Doak Walker, the
bouncing Billikens from St. Louis
have forced their way into the na
tional spotlight position occupied for
the past two years by Kentucky's
Wildcats. To date the Billikens have
won 12 and lost but one—an unbe
lievably low scoring 29 to 27 over
time contest to Oklahoma A&M. For
our money, Kentucky still has the
better ball club, but any one of the
top three is good enough to finish
the year in the number one spot.
2. Kentucky—The snarling Wild
cats fell into disfavor with the na
tions sportscribes by dropping a two
point Sugar Bowl Tournament con- ;
test to St. Louis. But Adolph Rupp's
boys haven't been pressed since and
will te right back up there if the
leaders blow another one.
Oklahoma A&M—C oach Henry
Iba's squad climbed to its rightful
spot in the top three by outwitting
St. Louis last week. The Aggies j
lost two early-season games but are j
on their way now and may not drop
any more. They don't score much, I
but probably have the best defensive j
record in the country.
4. Western Kentucky—A good lit
tle ball club in its own league, West
ern Kentucky has gained national i
prominence by going undefeated for
15 games. However, its league isn't
very tough, and we don't think the !
Hilltoppers' undefeated record would
last very long in the big time. A
good bet for 12th or 15th place, !
maybe, but not 4th.
5. Minnesota — Undefeated in 13 i
starts this year, the Gophers deserve
a better place on the ladder. The :
Minnesota five prides itself on its j
defensive play, but scores a few it
:-elf every now and then with the |

result that the Bit> Niners have pol
ished oft some of the best squads in
the Middle West. May be the top
team in the country.
6. 11l inois—Paced by the fabulous
Dike Eddleman, the Illini have come
up with a team reminiscent of fam
ous Whiz Kids. The high-scoring
Champaign five has lost only one
contest out of 13, and along with
Minnesota, will have quite a bit to
say about who the Big Nine cham
pion will be.
7. Mainline—Another little nobody
until basketball season comes along.
Ham line has been tackling the big
ones and making them fall. The
Pied Pipers have gone through 14
games and two tournaments without
suffering a loss against such com
petition as Texas Christian, Wyo
ming, Denver, and Loyola of Los
Angeles. Will probably stay unde
feated until they meet the Phillips
Oilers late next month.
8. Yillamna — Sporting a /flashy
11-0 record over fair eastQMjfrcompe
tion the Wildcats deserve the eighth
Spot in the ratings for the time being
anyway. May not have the stuff to
last through the post-season tourna
ments, however.
9. USF—The Dons built up a big
following during their successful
junket through the East—which ac
counts in part for their high ranking.
But the Hilltoppers have "lucked
out" in more games than one, and
with a heavy schedule remaining,
should drop out of the first 10 be
fore long.
10. Utah—A top-flight team with a
top-flight coach, the Utes (13-2) are
always tough. Buoyed up with a
double win over rival Wyoming last
weekend, Val Peterson's team looks
the c!a»s of the rugged Skyline Six
this year. Will he tough to dislodge.
The inconsistency of newspaper
sports polls was shown up again this i
week when Stanford's up-and- :
coming casaba team, which soundly
whipped the USF Dons on the bas- j
ketball floor Friday night, ran sec- j
ond to the Hilltoppers in the latest
national rankings.
Since the llth-place Cards and the
9th-place Dons have similar 15-2
records against substantially equal
equal competition, we must confess
that such reasoning is a little beyond
us. But considering the big press
buildup that USF has been getting

of the teams or coincide with the i
opinion of the average fan.
But as long as uneven ballot dis
tribution and pork barrel voting pre
vail there's no hope for much im
provement.
Casting a jaundiced eye over the
Associated Press selections, here's I
the way they look to us:
1. St. Louis—Led by cover boy
Easy Ed Macauley, the most publi
cized player since Doak Walker, the
bouncing Billikens from St. Louis
have forced their way into the na
tional spotlight position occupied for
the past two years by Kentucky's
Wildcats. To date the Billikens have
won 12 and lost but one—an unbe
lievably low scoring 29 to 27 over
time contest to Oklahoma A&M. For
our money, Kentucky still has the
better ball club, but any one of the
top three is good enough to finish
the year in the number one spot.
2. Kentucky—The snarling Wild
cats fell into disfavor with the na
tions sportscribes by dropping a two
point Sugar Bowl Tournament con- ;
test to St. Louis. But Adolph Rupp's
boys haven't been pressed since and
will te right back up there if the
leaders blow another one.
Oklahoma A&M—C oach Henry
Iba's squad climbed to its rightful
spot in the top three by outwitting
St. Louis last week. The Aggies j
lost two early-season games but are j
on their way now and may not drop
any more. They don't score much, I
but probably have the best defensive j
record in the country.
4. Western Kentucky—A good lit
tle ball club in its own league, West
ern Kentucky has gained national i
prominence by going undefeated for
15 games. However, its league isn't
very tough, and we don't think the !
Hilltoppers' undefeated record would
last very long in the big time. A
good bet for 12th or 15th place, !
maybe, but not 4th.
5. Minnesota — Undefeated in 13 i
starts this year, the Gophers deserve
a better place on the ladder. The :
Minnesota five prides itself on its j
defensive play, but scores a few it
:-elf every now and then with the |

result that the Bit> Niners have pol
ished oft some of the best squads in
the Middle West. May be the top
team in the country.
6. 11l inois—Paced by the fabulous
Dike Eddleman, the Illini have come
up with a team reminiscent of fam
ous Whiz Kids. The high-scoring
Champaign five has lost only one
contest out of 13, and along with
Minnesota, will have quite a bit to
say about who the Big Nine cham
pion will be.
7. Mainline—Another little nobody
until basketball season comes along.
Ham line has been tackling the big
ones and making them fall. The
Pied Pipers have gone through 14
games and two tournaments without
suffering a loss against such com
petition as Texas Christian, Wyo
ming, Denver, and Loyola of Los
Angeles. Will probably stay unde
feated until they meet the Phillips
Oilers late next month.
8. Yillamna — Sporting a /flashy
11-0 record over fair eastQMjfrcompe
tion the Wildcats deserve the eighth
Spot in the ratings for the time being
anyway. May not have the stuff to
last through the post-season tourna
ments, however.
9. USF—The Dons built up a big
following during their successful
junket through the East—which ac
counts in part for their high ranking.
But the Hilltoppers have "lucked
out" in more games than one, and
with a heavy schedule remaining,
should drop out of the first 10 be
fore long.
10. Utah—A top-flight team with a
top-flight coach, the Utes (13-2) are
always tough. Buoyed up with a
double win over rival Wyoming last
weekend, Val Peterson's team looks
the c!a»s of the rugged Skyline Six
this year. Will he tough to dislodge.
The inconsistency of newspaper
sports polls was shown up again this i
week when Stanford's up-and- :
coming casaba team, which soundly
whipped the USF Dons on the bas- j
ketball floor Friday night, ran sec- j
ond to the Hilltoppers in the latest
national rankings.
Since the llth-place Cards and the
9th-place Dons have similar 15-2
records against substantially equal
equal competition, we must confess
that such reasoning is a little beyond
us. But considering the big press
buildup that USF has been getting
this season and the manner in which
the Associated Press poll is taken,
we can't say that it surprised us.
Once a week sportswriters and
broadcasters from all over the coun
try submit their nominations for the
nation's 10 best college cage teams.
The votes are tabulated on a point
basis and the results are released as
being a consensus of the country's
top teams.
The unique thing about these con- :
sensus rankings is that they seldom
reflect the true comparative ability j
of the teams or coincide with the i
opinion of the average fan.
