# In the Court of the Beloved Oak

### 
As I mentioned last week,
at Stanford I am blessed with
a roommate. Now my room
mate and I went suit shop
ping at the Clothes Closet the
other day.and a line pair we
made, she being; a sweet, pe
tite o' 2", and 1 reaching up
toward a glorious 5' lfl". We
were enough to strike terror
into any clothier's heart.
Any, that is, cxcept the
Clothes C'.oset. They showed
us their impeccably tailored
Hart, Schaffner & Marx suits
which come in proportioned
tall and petite sizes as well as
regular sizes.
I didn't have the usual
problem of wrists dangling
from the sleeves or unclad
knees knocking in the win
ter's breeze. And Koomy, as
I've named her, didn't lose
her ankles in folds of ma
terial almost touching the
ground. Today we both sport
HS&M suits, the smartest
suits in town. Remember, the
CC is at 520 Knrnona just oft'
l'niversit.\.
