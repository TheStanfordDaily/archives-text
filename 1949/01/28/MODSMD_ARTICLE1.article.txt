# Students Ask For Changes In Judiciary
## 
### 
All Honor Code violations, both
men's and women's cases, should be
considered by joint meetings of
Men's and Women's Councils, was
the recommendation made last night
to the ASSU Constitution Commit
tee at an open hearing on the judi
ciary system.
Need for a specific Court of Ap
peals through which students might
appeal cases involving major penal
ties also was registered in two sep
arate plans submitted at the hearing.
Proposed joint council meeting for
all Honor Code eases would unify
the procedure and penalties nuw
given in the separate hearings, said
Mark Hatfield, chairman of the
Constitution Committee. "These
joint Council meetings would be
limited to cases of common viola
tions," he said. Repiesentatives from
Loth Councils endorsed the plan.
Under the major problem of ap
peals. Ted Norton suggested Council
recommendation on all cases involv
ing loss of privileges (disqualifica
tion or suspension from the Uni
versity) for more than one quarter,
fine of $50 or more, of 50 hours Con
Home labor, be withheld from the
Dean of Students for six days.
'"Ihis would give a student time
to appeal to the same Council for a
retrial of his case before the penalty
became final," said Norton. "It
would act also as a stop-gap for im
perfections which appear in even the
best organized student government."
A Court of Appeals was also pro
posed which would serve as an in
termediary body between the Coun
cils and the Dean of Students. It
would have the power to repeal any
of Council's recommendations. This
Court would be composed of two
members of the administration and
two members of the student body,
appointed by the administration for
term of office.
