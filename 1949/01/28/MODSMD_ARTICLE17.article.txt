# GOP Chairman
## 
### 
OMAHAâ€”Hugh D. Scott Jr. held
on to his chairmanship of a kick
ing. scratching Republican National
Committee today by a slim margin
of four votes.
After a day of political fighting
seldom equaled by the staid old
GOP. the 48-year-old Pennsylvania
Congressman won a 54 to 50 vote
of confidence.
Scott thus won a fight pitched by
avowed critics of Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey of New York, the 1948 GOP
Presidential nominee.
But in doing it, Scott put himself
on record flatly as saying that
Dewey "should not. could not, and
will not" become a candidate for a
third Presidential nomination.
