# New Jobs Open for Students On Executive Staff of HR
## 
### 
A number of positions on the IIP?
executive staff are open to inter
ested students, according to Bob von
Pagenhardt, lIR president. Since
IIR is an ASSU administration
board, all students are automatical
ly members, he stated. Thus anyone
with the time and the inclination
may participate. The lIR office will
open to interview applicants at 3
Friday afiernoon.
Three secretary-receptionists are
needed. They would assist students
requiring information at the lIR
office and help the president and
vice-president with correspondence.
To give an idea of the type and
amount of correspondence handled
through the executive office alone,
von Pagenhardt listed the follow
ing letters sent out last week:
A letter in reply to the Assistant
Sercetary General for Public Infor
mation of the UN concerning the
visit of a Stanford student, a letter
in reply to the Institute of Interna
tional Education concerning the

F arm's foreign scholarship plan,
letters to the State Department and
io the educational adviser of Gen.
Mac Arthur's staff.
Other positions include:
A personnel director to keep pcr-
I sonnel files and promote student
1 participation in the lIR, and per
> sons to work on a liaison staff
which would work with other re
! gional and national organizations
t such as the UN and the Institute of
International Education. File clerks
and mimeographers are also urgent
ly needed.
A really interested person is
J needed for the job of assistant to
the group's president. He would
| assist the president in administra
! tion of the organization and in rep
resenting the lIR to the world at
j large. He could, according to von
Pagenhardt, understudy the presi
i dent's job so that he may become
â€¢ prepared as president or vice-presi
! dent himself, if elected.
