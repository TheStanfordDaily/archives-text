# Cagers Host SJS, Pitt
## Indians Favored in Weekend Tilts; Pavilion Tipoff Tonight at Eight 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's 15 and 2 cage rec
ord will be in for a tough ride
tonight when San Jose's battling
Spartans invade the Pavilion for
the Peninsula's annual neigh
borhood feud.
Another jammed crowd is ex
pected to be on hand for the 8 p.m.
tipoff, as all tickets have been sold
since last Wednesday. Stanford
Braves and Modesto JC get-together
for the 6:15 p.m. preliminary.
Tomorrow night Stanford will
head for the Cow Palace to face
the far-traveling Pittsburgh Pan
thers. The Indians will be favored
both nights, and should run their
string to 17 out of 19 if all goes as
expected. Cow Palace starting time
is set for 9:150 p.m.
Dean Expects Trouble
However, Everett Dean is looking
: for plenty of trouble from the neigh
boring San Jose bunch. The Spar
tans always point for Stanford, and
if playing their best ball, could sur
prise. Stanford regards State as no
cinch, and has been preparing for
the Spartans all week.
The Spartans just dropped a game
to St. Mary's Tuesday night to fold


I)R. H. C. CARLSON, Pittsburgh's
famed cage mentor, brings his
touring Panther squad into the
San Francisco Cold Palace to
morrow night to test Stanford's
up - and - coming varsity basket
hallers. Carlson has been coach
ing at Pittsburgh for 28 years.
