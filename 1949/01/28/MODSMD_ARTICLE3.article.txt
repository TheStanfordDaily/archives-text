# Cagers Host SJS, Pitt
## Indians Favored in Weekend Tilts; Pavilion Tipoff Tonight at Eight 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's 15 and 2 cage rec
ord will be in for a tough ride
tonight when San Jose's battling
Spartans invade the Pavilion for
the Peninsula's annual neigh
borhood feud.
Another jammed crowd is ex
pected to be on hand for the 8 p.m.
tipoff, as all tickets have been sold
since last Wednesday. Stanford
Braves and Modesto JC get-together
for the 6:15 p.m. preliminary.
Tomorrow night Stanford will
head for the Cow Palace to face
the far-traveling Pittsburgh Pan
thers. The Indians will be favored
both nights, and should run their
string to 17 out of 19 if all goes as
expected. Cow Palace starting time
is set for 9:150 p.m.
Dean Expects Trouble
However, Everett Dean is looking
: for plenty of trouble from the neigh
boring San Jose bunch. The Spar
tans always point for Stanford, and
if playing their best ball, could sur
prise. Stanford regards State as no
cinch, and has been preparing for
the Spartans all week.
The Spartans just dropped a game
to St. Mary's Tuesday night to fold


I)R. H. C. CARLSON, Pittsburgh's
famed cage mentor, brings his
touring Panther squad into the
San Francisco Cold Palace to
morrow night to test Stanford's
up - and - coming varsity basket
hallers. Carlson has been coach
ing at Pittsburgh for 28 years.
up a six-game winning streak, but
they'll be set to dig in against Stan
ford. Before blowing the duke to the
Gaels, San Jose had whipped Pep
perdine, San Francisco 49ers, San
Francisco State, Fresno State, and
Arizona State.
Ininan Tops State
Backbone of the Spartan attack is
big Stu Inman, who consistently
scores over 12 points. Inman plays
the pivot, but he moves in and out,
and is a hard man to move away
from the boards.
Everett Dean will start the same
men as he used against Santa Clara
and USF last weekend. Marv Gelber
and George Yardley will open at for
wards:, Bill Stephenson will be at
center, and the guard spots will uo
to Dave Davidson and Bob Lewis.
Bill Rose, just returned to the
squad after sitting out an academic
condition for three weeks, will not
start, but will see early action. Rose
is still a little off in his timing, but
he should be back to normal when
these two games are under his belt.
Stanford had trouble with San
Jose State last year, finally nosing
the Spartans, 54 to 50. Tonight the
Deanmen should have an easier time.
San Jose has been winning, but
teams which went into their vic
tory column haven't measured up
to standard.
Soft Touches
Pittsburgh, another probable soft
touch, makes its claim to fame this
season by having traveled far and
wide, and by having one of the big
gest name coaehcs in the business.
If Stanford gets by San Jose, it
should have no trouble picking up
its 17th win against the Panthers.
Pitt has stumbled across the coun
try. losing to Bradley Tech. Denver,
and Utah in rapid order, and will
probably drop two more to Califor
nia tonight and Stanford tomorrow
night.
Doc H. C. Carlson, Pitt coach for
29 years, will try to whip together
an offense to maintain his one-game
win streak against Stanford which
he started in 1932, 22 to 11. But
times have changed, as Carlson
must have noted the other night
when Utah turned on the heat, On
to 44.
Kernel* Is Beefy
Big boy in the Panther attack is
i center Mort Lerner, 6-3, who tips
the Fairbanks at 205. He is the
beefiest center that Bill Stephenson
will meet this season.
Pittsburgh uses a wild and wooly
pressing defense and will converge
on the ball from all angles, and
should be a colorful team to watch.
But it's dollars to doughnuts that
their name won't be up in the win
column after the final gun.

Doc H. C. Carlson, Pitt coach for
29 years, will try to whip together
an offense to maintain his one-game
win streak against Stanford which
he started in 1932, 22 to 11. But
times have changed, as Carlson
must have noted the other night
when Utah turned on the heat, On
to 44.
Kernel* Is Beefy
Big boy in the Panther attack is
i center Mort Lerner, 6-3, who tips
the Fairbanks at 205. He is the
beefiest center that Bill Stephenson
will meet this season.
Pittsburgh uses a wild and wooly
pressing defense and will converge
on the ball from all angles, and
should be a colorful team to watch.
But it's dollars to doughnuts that
their name won't be up in the win
column after the final gun.

Stanford's 15 and 2 cage rec
ord will be in for a tough ride
tonight when San Jose's battling
Spartans invade the Pavilion for
the Peninsula's annual neigh
borhood feud.
Another jammed crowd is ex
pected to be on hand for the 8 p.m.
tipoff, as all tickets have been sold
since last Wednesday. Stanford
Braves and Modesto JC get-together
for the 6:15 p.m. preliminary.
Tomorrow night Stanford will
head for the Cow Palace to face
the far-traveling Pittsburgh Pan
thers. The Indians will be favored
both nights, and should run their
string to 17 out of 19 if all goes as
expected. Cow Palace starting time
is set for 9:150 p.m.
Dean Expects Trouble
However, Everett Dean is looking
: for plenty of trouble from the neigh
boring San Jose bunch. The Spar
tans always point for Stanford, and
if playing their best ball, could sur
prise. Stanford regards State as no
cinch, and has been preparing for
the Spartans all week.
The Spartans just dropped a game
to St. Mary's Tuesday night to fold


I)R. H. C. CARLSON, Pittsburgh's
famed cage mentor, brings his
touring Panther squad into the
San Francisco Cold Palace to
morrow night to test Stanford's
up - and - coming varsity basket
hallers. Carlson has been coach
ing at Pittsburgh for 28 years.

they'll be set to dig in against Stan
ford. Before blowing the duke to the
Gaels, San Jose had whipped Pep
perdine, San Francisco 49ers, San
Francisco State, Fresno State, and
Arizona State.
Ininan Tops State
Backbone of the Spartan attack is
big Stu Inman, who consistently
scores over 12 points. Inman plays
the pivot, but he moves in and out,
and is a hard man to move away
from the boards.
Everett Dean will start the same
men as he used against Santa Clara
and USF last weekend. Marv Gelber
and George Yardley will open at for
wards:, Bill Stephenson will be at
center, and the guard spots will uo
to Dave Davidson and Bob Lewis.
Bill Rose, just returned to the
squad after sitting out an academic
condition for three weeks, will not
start, but will see early action. Rose
is still a little off in his timing, but
he should be back to normal when
these two games are under his belt.
Stanford had trouble with San
Jose State last year, finally nosing
the Spartans, 54 to 50. Tonight the
Deanmen should have an easier time.
San Jose has been winning, but
teams which went into their vic
tory column haven't measured up
to standard.
Soft Touches
Pittsburgh, another probable soft
touch, makes its claim to fame this
season by having traveled far and
wide, and by having one of the big
gest name coaehcs in the business.
If Stanford gets by San Jose, it
should have no trouble picking up
its 17th win against the Panthers.
Pitt has stumbled across the coun
