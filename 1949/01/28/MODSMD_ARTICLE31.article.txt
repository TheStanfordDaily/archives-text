"On Bteing Spiritually Active" is
the topic selected by Chaplain Paul

Johnston's text is from John 7:38:
"He that believeth in Me, as the
Scriptures have said, from within
him shall flow rivers of living wa
ter."
The University Choir will sing an
anthem and a motet: Mozart's "Ave
Verum" and Bortninsky's "Cheru
bim Song." Hymns to be sung by
the congregation include "All Hail
the Power of Jesus' Name," "Now
Thank We All Our God," and "Rise
Up, O Men of God."
The organ preludes are Cesar
Franck's Prelude, Fugue, and Vari
ation"' and "How Brightly Beams
the Morning Star"; the postlude.
Bach's "In Thee Is Gladness."
Services begin promptly at 11.
The attention of parents is again
drawn to the Sunday school, for
children from 4 to 12. which meets
in the Vestry before services.
