Dismissed Washington Professors
To the Editor:
Last weekend three professors were dismissed from the University of
Washington faculty because of past or present affiliation with the Com
t mnist Party. Three others were placed on "probation"' (conform, or else)
on similar charges.
Since, by the investigation, the professors were not found wanting in
the discharge of their teaching duties, the conclusion must be drawn that
these men of 20 years tenure with the university were bounced merely
because their ideas concerning social change differed from those held by
the regents, or those people who control the regents.
Needless to say, the whole episode lacks only the "untimely death
from a sudden heart attack," or perhaps and "open court confession of
deviationist tendencies" on the part of the severed professors to equal the
outrageous practices used by totalitarian regimes we know so well.
Come to think about, with "loyalty pledges" and witch-hunting blight
ing free thought more and more each day, it is obvious that less and less
do we have the right to "cast the first stone" of accusation at other coun
tries regarding the protection of civil liberties.
