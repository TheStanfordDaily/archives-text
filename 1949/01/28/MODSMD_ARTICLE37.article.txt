No more beer?
Cornell University co-eds are j
"fed up with beering dates," j
claimed girls in a broadcast over !
the university's radio station re
cently.
As a substitute the girls suggested
a stroll, periods of intelligent con- J
versation, card playing, hiking, and
"any number of things except beer
ing." They also called for "dating
on a less strenuous financial scale."
Cornell men frankly admitted j
they were surprised—but willing to
co - operate. However, one com
mented dryly, "Girls may be sick i
of beer parties, but I haven't seen
any aversion to 'champagne
brawls'."
See, there are other problems
besides "the ratio."

No "true confessions" in Can
ada . . .
Canadian students at Sir George .
Williams College in Quebec aren't
faced with the same problem as I
Cornell. They just won't talk! Ac- [
cording to the school paper, The ;
Georgian, the Quebec WCTU is
having difficulty in getting entries j
for its essay contest on alcohol.
Yep, there are problems in the
world today.

A ski tow in every back yard . . .
This may be the beginning of a
new era. The University of Con
necticut now has its own ski tow. j
The lift is located on Horsebarn Hill
near the campus, and is divided into
sections for beginning and ad
vanced skiers, as well as spots for
jumping. The university's ski club
has organized a ski patrol, and
provisions are being made for bor
rowing skis from the athletic de- j
part ment.
Who knows? If this weather
keeps up. maybe we'll have a tow
on Skyline.

Tobogganing—served on trays . . .
Washington State doesn't have a
ski tow, but that hasn't stopped its
students from enjoying the winter
sports.
It has been found that the plastic
trays in the Stadium Commons, !
when applied to the seat of the
pants, make an excellent substitute
for the old-fashioned toboggan.
However, the cafeteria isn't too
eager about this new athletic trend I
—seems that approximately 50 trays
were taken during one evening j
meal.

Next time try tea . . .
Overheard in the Michigan State |

Union grill:
"Gee, maybe I'd better not drink
this cup of coffee. If I do I'll toss
and turn all day in class.
After Cellar coffee, who has
strength to toss?

The light of learning dawns . . .

During the recent power short
age at the University of Toronto,
one enterprising student showed up
at a lecture with a burning candle.
When asked to douse the light,
he made the undying friendship of
his professor by remarking, "I just
wanted to brighten up the lecture.''
