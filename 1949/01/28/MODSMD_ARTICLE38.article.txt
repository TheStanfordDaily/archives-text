What has the Negro given to American music?
I say he has given his all. Jazz came and the blues followed. Boogie
tcok a hand. Dixieland had its fling. And now swing has taken over.
But it all started once upon a time in a jungle of yore where young
prince Muratroid, or whatever they called young princes in those days,
started kicking the gong around. All he had was a hollow log to beat
his brains out on. But that started evolution.
We have come a long way from there. The jazz era came in with a
gang of hellions whooping up on Basin Street, the red light district of
New Orleans. "King Oliver," "Pinetop" Smith, and "Bunk" Johnson were
a 1! there to welcome it. "Pinctop's Boogie Woogie" is still being recorded,
incidentally, and with astounding record sales.
'ihere isn't a story written 01 a talc told wherein the Negro musician
can be bested in pop music. Look at the record.
The Negro started barrelhousing in the New Orleans French section,
when the colonists were still tin-ear ickies, just as hep as the Minuet.
The term "barrelhouse" even comes from the name of a low-brow tavern
in this isle of sin. "Gut bucket." another of the hep cat's swing terms, comes
from the name of the bucket that caught the gutterings of the beer or
what-have-you kegs then in use. It signifies music that is "low down"
in character—hot licks, that is. So even the musicians' talk comes from
the Negro.
There are legends from down under there, too. When the party started
to get rough "King" Buddy Bolden, one of the alMime greats on trumpet,
used to play "Don't Go 'Way Nobody," and then the band would start
I.eating his theme, "Emancipation Day." It was a great favorite of the
"chillun," as the "king" liked to call his disciples. But when he played
the shuflle blues (and this is where Henry Busse got his old shuffle rhythm
idea), that's when they loved him best. On still nights his horn could
be heard up the river clear to Lake Ponchartrain.
Spike Jones had his counterpart in "Stale Bread" Lacoume and his
Spasm Band which played the zither, a cheese box banjo, and a bass
fiddle made from half a barrel and some clothesline wire.
The jazzmen had their sense of humor then, too. A lot less subtle
than now perhaps, but humor nonetheless. Instead of their music fol
lowing stuff like Spike Jones' "Hotcha Cornia" and "Our Hour," they
put out some badwy lyrics like "Gettin Dirty Just Shakin' that Thing" by
Nelson and a Tony Jackson piano favorite about 1908, called "I've Got
Elgin Movements in My Hips with Twenty Years Guarantee."
A 1 vino Rey invented the electric guitar lie uses, but looking back we
find that Bill Johnson of the 1911 Creole Band invented the bass as we
have it today. He was sawing away one night in the then-approved 'cello
manner when the saw-string broke. There were no spares around, so
in desperation he started slapping the strings. The improvement was such
that he threw away all his bows next day.
Ziggy Elman and Chuck Peterson synchionize trumpets on a Tommy
Dorsey record so it sounds like one terrific soloist. It's the. to me, sensa
tional "Well Get It." But was have the same thing cropping up in music
history with Louis Armstrong and "King" Olive)-, player and leader in
the Original Creole Band, respectively. These two could start riding a piece
together without a flaw just by sing-songing it through together once.
Another music great was "King" Keppard. He held the distinction of
having the greatest playing range for cornet then, just as Harry James
holds it today for trumpet. He could play so low as to sound like a trom
bone. and then go up above high E. He could also play so softly as to
be heard only a few feet away, then on occasions so loudly as to make the
front rows move back. He played music 30 years ago that would sound
modern today.
And the Negro is still out in the lead. Just as 30 years ago Keppard
was the pioneer of musicdom, so now is Duke Ellington 30 years ahead
of his time .... and he just recently was chosen America's number one
band of the year by "Downbeat" magazine.

Spike Jones had his counterpart in "Stale Bread" Lacoume and his
Spasm Band which played the zither, a cheese box banjo, and a bass
fiddle made from half a barrel and some clothesline wire.
The jazzmen had their sense of humor then, too. A lot less subtle
than now perhaps, but humor nonetheless. Instead of their music fol
lowing stuff like Spike Jones' "Hotcha Cornia" and "Our Hour," they
put out some badwy lyrics like "Gettin Dirty Just Shakin' that Thing" by
Nelson and a Tony Jackson piano favorite about 1908, called "I've Got
Elgin Movements in My Hips with Twenty Years Guarantee."
A 1 vino Rey invented the electric guitar lie uses, but looking back we
find that Bill Johnson of the 1911 Creole Band invented the bass as we
have it today. He was sawing away one night in the then-approved 'cello
manner when the saw-string broke. There were no spares around, so
in desperation he started slapping the strings. The improvement was such
that he threw away all his bows next day.
Ziggy Elman and Chuck Peterson synchionize trumpets on a Tommy
Dorsey record so it sounds like one terrific soloist. It's the. to me, sensa
tional "Well Get It." But was have the same thing cropping up in music
history with Louis Armstrong and "King" Olive)-, player and leader in
the Original Creole Band, respectively. These two could start riding a piece
together without a flaw just by sing-songing it through together once.
Another music great was "King" Keppard. He held the distinction of
having the greatest playing range for cornet then, just as Harry James
holds it today for trumpet. He could play so low as to sound like a trom
bone. and then go up above high E. He could also play so softly as to
be heard only a few feet away, then on occasions so loudly as to make the
front rows move back. He played music 30 years ago that would sound
modern today.
And the Negro is still out in the lead. Just as 30 years ago Keppard
was the pioneer of musicdom, so now is Duke Ellington 30 years ahead
of his time .... and he just recently was chosen America's number one
band of the year by "Downbeat" magazine.
What has the Negro given to American music?
I say he has given his all. Jazz came and the blues followed. Boogie
tcok a hand. Dixieland had its fling. And now swing has taken over.
But it all started once upon a time in a jungle of yore where young
prince Muratroid, or whatever they called young princes in those days,
started kicking the gong around. All he had was a hollow log to beat
his brains out on. But that started evolution.
We have come a long way from there. The jazz era came in with a
gang of hellions whooping up on Basin Street, the red light district of
New Orleans. "King Oliver," "Pinetop" Smith, and "Bunk" Johnson were
a 1! there to welcome it. "Pinctop's Boogie Woogie" is still being recorded,
incidentally, and with astounding record sales.
'ihere isn't a story written 01 a talc told wherein the Negro musician
can be bested in pop music. Look at the record.
The Negro started barrelhousing in the New Orleans French section,
when the colonists were still tin-ear ickies, just as hep as the Minuet.
The term "barrelhouse" even comes from the name of a low-brow tavern
in this isle of sin. "Gut bucket." another of the hep cat's swing terms, comes
from the name of the bucket that caught the gutterings of the beer or
what-have-you kegs then in use. It signifies music that is "low down"
in character—hot licks, that is. So even the musicians' talk comes from
the Negro.
There are legends from down under there, too. When the party started
to get rough "King" Buddy Bolden, one of the alMime greats on trumpet,
used to play "Don't Go 'Way Nobody," and then the band would start
I.eating his theme, "Emancipation Day." It was a great favorite of the
"chillun," as the "king" liked to call his disciples. But when he played
the shuflle blues (and this is where Henry Busse got his old shuffle rhythm
idea), that's when they loved him best. On still nights his horn could
be heard up the river clear to Lake Ponchartrain.
