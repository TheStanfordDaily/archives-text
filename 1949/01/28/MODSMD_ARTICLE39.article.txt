(Editor's note: This is the sec

developments, along with the pros
and cons, in the controversy over
a national health program.)
WASHINGTON l.4 J >. — Advocates
and opponents of compulsory health
insurance for the nation are still
so far apart in their views today

they even differ on defining "so
cialized medicine."
Oscar Ewing, Federal Security
Administrator, whose proposed
health program has the endorse
ment of President Truman, says his
plan does not constitute "socialized"
medicine.
But—yes. it does, says the Jour
nal of the American Medical Asso
ciation.
In a report outlining his plan—
which calls for taxes on wages and
payrolls to pay for hospital and
doctors' bills Ewing said:
"Certainly, government health in
surance as proposed here is not so
cialized or state medicine.
"Basically, socialized or stale
medicine means that the govern
ment owns and operates all hospi
tals. and that practicing physicians
are employed by ihe government on
a salary basis. They, like firemen
or policemen, are on government
payrolls and come under full gov
ernment supervision.
"Clearly, no such system is pro
posed under the plan for govern
ment insurance . . ."
Dr. Morris Fishbein. editor of
the A.M.A. Journal, defines it this
way:
"Socialized medicine is any plan
for medical care which is estab
lished for masses of people rather
than on an individual basis, and in

which government or other agen
cies assume responsibility."
The Truman-endorsed Ewing re
port says that "a scant 20 per cent
of our people are ab'e to afford all
the medical care they need."
It maintains that 325.000 deaths
could he prevented annually "if we
were able today to assure every
person in the country that he would
he able to receive the health and
medical services that are needed."
Who are the opponents of com
pulsory health insurance and who
are its backers?
The Michigan Public Expenditure
Survey, which describes itself as a
'"Michigan non-profit corporation."
says in a pamphlet entitled "Uncle
Sam . . . M.D."
"Lined up against the passage of
a compulsory health insurance law
todav are . . . those who have for
merly opposed such programs. They
include the big majority of the na
tion's doctors and dentists, the
American Medical Association, in
surance companies, and probably
the bulk of business men dependent
on free enterprise."
A group of Democratic Congress
men who recently introduced a
compulsory health insurance bill
said a similar bill introdued in the
last Congress "received strong back
ing from the American Federation
of Labor and the CIO. the Farm
ers' Union, and various churches,
civic, and professional groups . . ."
