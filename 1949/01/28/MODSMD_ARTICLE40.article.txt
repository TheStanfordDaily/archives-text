# KSU Finds 'Stoodents Stoopid'
## 
### MARY E. HILL 
"I hate women," says Jim
Crooker, master of ceremonies
for the "Stoodents Are Stoopid"
show, presented over KSU
every Tuesday at 10 p.m.
Crooker is surrounded by a new set
of women each week on this show,
which is considered ' the soj'tcst job
on the stall."
The show was started last sum
mer by Steve Phillips. KSU general
manager, in the hope of partially re
deeming the prevailing sentiments
regarding "Stanford Women."
"Stanford men seem to take the
attitude that Stanford women are too
intelligent to be suitable for dating
purposes." said Phillips, "so I
thought the only way to redeem the
women was to prove them stupid.
And it's been easy."
Answers Prove Theory
And some of the answers have
proved his theory. Such as the ones
received from this question. "You
are engaged. The man involved has
seen a picture of you in a newspaper
coming out of burlesque show with
several men. Explain the situation."
Replies ranged from the "Hell no. it
was my mother" type to "It was re
quired for one of my courses."
The program, however, is not
limited to the general question.
Emcee Crooker has to get acquainted
with the girls first. One Southern
girl was asked what she thought of
Stanford men in comparison with
men from the South. She replied,
"Southern men arc men of distinc
tion; Stanford men are men of dis
traction."
The inevitable question about

"What type of man do you like to
kiss?" received some interesting
answers. The summer show found
one girl who didn't believe in kiss
ing. But the most recent retort was
"It just depends on the kind of gum
he chews."
Some of the girls were more than
the master of ceremonies could
handle. The original problem in
setting up the show was to get a
man who could get along well with
the girls. And the only man who
filled this requirement was mar
ried. One night a participant got a

little too well acquainted with the
master of ceremonies and he got so
flustered he forgot his own name.
A record was hastily substituted
when he mistook the girl for the
microphone.
Dumbest Wins Prize
The girl with the most stupid
answers receives prizes from the
Palo Alto stores. But the best prize
of all should have been awarded to
a former producer of the show. He
called one of the women's houses
and asked the president to send over
five of the most stupid girls in the
house.
