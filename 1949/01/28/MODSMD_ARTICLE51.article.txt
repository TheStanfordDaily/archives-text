PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 27 (/Pi.â€”
A city hall official disclosed today
that there's a strong possibility the
Army-Navy football game will be
played somewhere other than Phil
adelphia at least once during the
next three years.
The service football classic has
been played at Philadelphia since
1931 except for a three-year lapse
during the war. The contract to
play at the huge Municipal Sta
dium ran out after last year's game
which ended in a 21-21 tic.
Thomas Buckley, director of pub
lic works, said he has been in touch
with West Point and Annapolis "in
a preliminary way" paving the way
for future talks about renewal of a
contract.
