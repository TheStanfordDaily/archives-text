# Frosh Face Prep Fives; Ramstead Will Miss Tilts
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Minus the services of star center Jim Ramstead, the Stanford
Fiosh cagers will tackle two more pre.p quintets this weekend
when they meet Lincoln High of San Francisco on Friday after
noon at 3, and Palo Alto High on Saturday at 2.
The loss of Ramstead will be a big blow to Coach Bob Burnett's

pivot play offense, but otherwise the
Papoose squad is in good shape.
Ramstead received a dislocated
thumb in the Lowell game last Fri
day, and the injury will definitely
put him on the shelf i'or at least
a week.
The big center will be replaced
by lanky Karl Davis, who has had
pitnty of experience this season,
and who will move right up from
his second string post.
High-scoring forward Jim Walsh,
who tanked 2U points in the Lowell
contest, will be ready to lead the
Frosh offense against the Mustangs
Friday and the Vikings Saturday.
Coach Burnett has been centering
his plays around the talented ior
ward, who shoots with excellent ac
curacy from all angles of the lloor.
Reserves To See Action
Ron Garver, Bruce Iverson, and
Jim Pollock will round out the
Papoose starting five. Coach Bur
nett plans also to use his capable
second string which is led by Ralph
Dixon, former All-State prepster
from Arizona. Bill Vaughn, Gary
Andrews, and Tom Glickbarg also
plan to see plenty of action.
The Papooses' first foe, Lincoln
High of San Francisco, has had a
tough time getting started this sea
sun with the ioss of their ace scorer
Bob Froesche. The Mustangs took
the City championship last year with
all-City Ramstead at the pivot post,
but this year they have a 1 and 2
record in league play to date. They
whipped Polytechnic High, 41 to 23,
last week.
The Palo Alto Vikings, who are the
Froshs' second ioe on Saturday
afternoon, have been named the
hard-luck quintet of the P.A.L. The
favored Vikings lost all chance of
winning the league when they
dropped a 35 to 32 contest to Lin
coln High of San Jose last week.
Paly Makes Comeback
However, the Norsemen made a
comeback this week. They turned
in their highest scoring effort of ihe
season when they beat Washington
High of, Centerville, 54 to 27. Coach
George Hurley of the Vikings finally
found and offense-minded starting
quintet, who will be all out for a
victory over the Frosh. A 1 Tamboy,
the Peninsula's fourth-highest scor
er, leads the Viking attack.
Coach Burnett's Papaooses have a
season's record of five wins against
Jour losses. Three of the four de
feats were at the hands of the po
tent Stanford Braves, while the last
loss was to a classy Lowell High
quintet, 55 to 51. The Frosh hold
victories over Fremont. Mission, Pa
cific Grove, and the California
Frosh. The Papooses have trimmed
the Bear Cubs twice and thus are
assured of at least a split in their
traditional four-game series.

day's game:

Walsh 112 Lazzeri
Garver 112 Mohr
