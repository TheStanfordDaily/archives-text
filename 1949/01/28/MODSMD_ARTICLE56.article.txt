## PRELIMINARY Modesto Set For Rough Tilt With Hapless Braves 
### GIL JONAS 
Hiding on the wrong end of a i
five-game losing streak, Coach Phi!
Bengtscn's Craves will attempt to j
turn back the tide at the Pavilion I
against Modesto Junior College at
G: 15 tonight.
The Modesto aggregation is an •
unknown quantity as far as the 3
Braves aie concerned. The only in
formation which has come from tse
east is the rumor that a brother of
T. S. Ary, injured Card hoopster,
is a starter for the visitors.
It will make little difference ;
whom the Braves face—Girls' Com
mercial or Tibet Kindergarten —if

they maintain their frigid shooting
percentage of the past few games.
There is little cause for complaint
in the other departments—passing,
breaking fast, defense, and re
bounding—but in the column that
counts, the Braves have been woe
fully off. It's difficult to explain
why the Braves haven't been able
to dent the twine with any con
sitency. Dick Shutte and Gay
Bryan have had hot nights. Re
serves Pete Layman, Gene Martin,
and Dave Atcheson looked com
mendable in spots. But as a unit,
the Braves have failed to roll up
many top-heavy scores.
Several of the Braves were
rushed into the final few months
of the Santa Clara-Varsity fray last
Saturday and about all they de
rived from it were baskets by Paul
Watson and Bryan and some much
needed road work.
