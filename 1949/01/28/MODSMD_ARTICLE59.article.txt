"Well, howdy, pardner. Did you
make the team?"
"Naw, the coach gave me a bum !
steer."
Such conversations might be !
common on the Washington State |
College campus if the school adopts <
rodeo competition as an intercolle
giate sport.
Athletic officials said today they i
are "seriously considering" a re- I
quest by a group of students to |
form a rodeo team and schedule an ;
intercollegiate rodeo championship ;
in Pullman bv 1952.

| Several other Western colleges
have rodeo teams and have com
peted in intercollegiate rodeos. offi
