# Editor Is Needed For 'Frosh Bible'
## 
### 
Want to earn $50? Cardinals is
offering this wage to the student
selected as the editor of next year's
"Frosh Bible."
Tryoutees will be interviewed by
John Poole. ASSU business mana
ger; Joe Zukin, president of Cardi
nals; and one other Cardinals
member. Anyone interested <n the
job should report to the Excom
room in the Student Union either
Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon
between 3:15 and 4:15.
The job will entail some work
during the summer, so applicants
living in the Bay Area are prefer
able. Previous experience in pub
lications would be advantageous,
but is not absolutely necessary.
The main qualification is that the
applicant have some good ideas
about putting out a "bigger and
better"' Frosh Bible.
Previously, the editor of the frosh
book was chosen from the members
of Cardinals and publication of the
book itself came under the super
vision of Activities Committee. How
ever, a constitutional revision by
Excom made it a separate enter
prise, and specified that the editor
be a student chosen by a commit
tee of Cardinals members and one
member of Publications Council.
Any new student who did not
get a Frosh Bible this year may
get one by stopping at the ASSU
office beginning Monday.
