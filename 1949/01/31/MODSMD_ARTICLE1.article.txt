# Stalin Agrees To Talk Peace With Truman
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Jan. 31 (/P) â€” Prime
Minister Stalin said yesterday he
has "no objection" t<s a meeting with
President Truman at some mutually
acceptable place to discuss a "peace
pact" between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
(President Truman has stated fre
quently he is ready to meet Stalin
any time in Washington. But offi
cials in Washington took a cold view
today of Stalin's latest pronounce
ment. pointing out that there has
been no official Soviet approach lor
a Truman-Stalin meeting.)
Replying to a questionnaire, Stalin
said the Soviet Union "would be
prepared to consider" the issuance
of a joint declaration with the United
States in which each country would
proclaim it had no intention of re
sorting to war against the other.
Further, the Soviet leader said
Moscow was willing to join with
Washington in measures leading to
"gradual disarmament."
In a reference to the German prob
lem Stalin said Russia "sees no ob
stacles" to lilting the Berlin block
ade if two conditions are met by the
Western Powers. These would re
quire the removal of the West's
counter blockade and would require
the United States, Britain, and
France to postpone establishment of
a Western German state pending a
meeting of the Big Four Council of
Foreign Ministers on the entire
German issue.
(Several attempts have been made
by the Western Powers to compro
mise the ticklish Berlin situation.
The last time was last fall before
the United Nations Security Council
in Paris. A proposal advanced at
that time called on Russia to lift
the blockade and for a Big Four
Foreign Ministers' meeting on Ger
many 10 days later. It was vetoed
by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei
Y. Vishinsky.)
