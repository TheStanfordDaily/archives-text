The Army, bulldozing its way
through western snowdrifts, yester
day reported "we just don't have
enough planes or time" to feed
storm-starved cattle by air.
"Figure it out for yourself," Fifth
Army Headquarters in Chicago said.
"In one county in Nebraska, Holt,
there are 100.000 cattle starving. A
C-47 plane can carry two tons of
feed.
"To supply those cattle with one
day's feed would require 500 flights.
We just don't have enough planes or
time to do the job by air. We've
got to get the roads open."
The Army's efforts to open roads
in the West highlighted a spotty na
tional weather picture.
In Southern California, freezing
temperatures which followed Satur
day's windstprms eased somewhat
last night. The mercury had been
down to 20 degrees in some of the
coldest spots Sunday morning.
Smudging was general in the citrus
groves, and a heavy smoke pall cut
visibility in Los Angeles to one mile.
Northern California experienced
comparatively mild weather. Tem
peratures dropped to freezing and
below at night—not uncommon in
the northern section at this season—
but climbed comfortably during the
day.
