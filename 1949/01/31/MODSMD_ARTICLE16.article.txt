â€”A bloodless revolution deposed the
government of President J. Natalico

Brazilian Embassy as members of
his own cabinet seized power. They
had formed a secret dissident group
in his own Colorado Party.
Thus ended the five turbulent
months of his administration. It was
the' sixth Paraguayan revolution
since the start of 15)48. Gonzalez
himself led one of them.
Labor Minister Augusto Salvidar,
a leader of the coup, said the new
government would seek peace with
the country's multiple warring polit
ical factions. The Colorado Party
had outlawed all opposition.
Salvidar annouced the National
Assembly would meet at 4 p.m. and
lorm the new government.
Not all of the cabinet had a hand
in the rebellion. Some members took
haven with Gonzalez. Among them
were Treasury Minister Leandro
Prieto.
Manuel Talavera, president of the
Colorado Party's governing board,
fled to the Argentine Embassy.
(Where the military has thrown its
support in the revolution, and who
besides Salvidar were involved, were
not explained in the dispatch. Fre
quently there is censorship on such
occasions.
The Youth Branch of the Colorado
Party, Juvcntud Partido Colorado,
celebrated the coup by gathering in
the Plaza of Heroes in the morning
and shouting slogans.
