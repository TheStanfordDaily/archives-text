## Freedom In Berlin 
### 
The current collection of clothes and books for the Free Uni
versity of Berlin is more than an ordinary drive. Like the adop
iion by Stanford of the University of Naples, the gifts have a per
sonal basis. And person-to-person aid has always had more ap
peal to us than the more complicated machine-like help agencies.
It's a case of Stanford students helping Berlin young people
who had guts enough to leave the Soviet zone and set up their
own university. They left in haste and didn't take much with
Ihem.
The revolt of the Berlin students when reguired to take an
oath to the Soviet regime is another move by the Germans to
redeem themselves. American support will give public proof
lhat their stand has captured the idealism of the world, even
es the Air Lift. But let the students speak for themselves:
"The work here started already in November with the normal
plan of lessons of a real school. And it has got to be a success,
tor it is a guestion of prestige for all non-Communistic Germany.
"It sure is hard, but you would not find a single person in
he Western Sector who would want to give up the fight now,
even if that would change all this right away.
"I'm not regretting that I changed to the new university be
cause it is so different there, as I told you already in my last
'etter. The big meeting of all the students and professors when
?he new university was opened was a very funny thing—
nobody knew who would be there because everybody had kept
his change secret. It was dangerous to talk about it. But when
we all met, everyone found exactly the people being there that
we had expected to find there.
"People in Berlin first were skeptical about the new university,
but we all can see that from today its gets more of the character
of a real, good working, and serious institution of sciences and
not of a political instrument as these people thought. But it is
clear that our institution which is created out of a situation like
ours in Berlin must be political to a certain extent, because at
tending it means already a political confession.
"Many of the students who did not dare to change to the
Western University feel already very sorry for it and I think
the new term will bring another load of them—and some pro
lessors too.
"And by the way, the article which I wrote could not do me
c,ny harm any more because we are all on the blacklist anyway.
"If your school really will try to help our young university
it would be a very good thing."
