## Concern for Civil Liberties 
### 
To the Editor:
The concern for civil liberties shown by some of those on this campus
r.nd elsewhere is laudable. I join with them in expressing the hope that
they may never perish from this land as they have with such disheartening
thoroughness elsewhere. The philosophy as expounded recently in the
nlment over the late Washington professors is shared by not a few
wherever intellectuals gather together in the name of justice for the sub
merged masses. These individuals apparently feel that is is merely a
matter of difference of opinion over social change which marks Com
nunist Party members from registered Democrats or Republicans. That
being so, they contend it un-American to discriminate between the three
parties and such action as canning brightly-hued instructing st;i(T in our
halls of learning is practically on a par with the tactics developed by our
Slavic brothers across the waters—tactics which in a few isolated instances
re reported to have even been fatal to non-conformers.
Let's face it. The CP isn't just another political group. They don't like
our way of doing things—no less on Main Street than on Wall Street. They
wish to bring us the joys of collective living as sponsored and promoted
by that happy breed of people enjoying such a high standard of living
behind the Iron Curtain thrown up by Western Imperialism.
My suggestion to those concerned with the fate of unemployed CP
< lembers is that they pass the .hat and secure passage for them to to' lain
f«r away places where they will certainly be welcomed and provided
..Hinful employment. And they won't have to worry about losing their
< ivll liberties like they did over here. I'll be happy to look up sailing
schedules.
