WASHINGTON â€” The handwrit
ing is on the wall for Europe's Mar
shall Plan countries.
The emphasis which President
Truman and Secretary of State
Acheson both have placed on the
use of private capital abroad is re
garded by officials here as the tip
oft that there will be no great new
out-pouring of American dollars
after 1952.
To Europeans who have been
worried about running a dollar defi
cit after the Marshall Plan is closed
out this means, in effect, that they
should get their affairs in order so
that they can rely on private capital
and such established public financ
inu agencies as the World Bank.
The President and Acheson were
not talking specifically about Euro
pean countries in their statements
on Mr. Truman's program for build
ing up underdeveloped areas of the
world.
But their remarks did have a
bearing on basic financial policies.
Moreover, the Marshall Plan will be
coming to an end in the few months
betore the next Presidential e'ec
tion. That is always a difficult time
to lay down a heavy new spending
program.
