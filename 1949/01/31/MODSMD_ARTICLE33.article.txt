BERLIN â€” You may have heard
only the beginning of a long drawn
out row over the '"German compe
tition problem."
As Germany recovers it will start
pinching the U.S., Britain, and oili
er industrial nations in world mar
kets.
Since we are footing a bill for
German recovery, there will be in
creasing protest that we're feeding
a hand that's biting us. (The Brit
ish are yelling already.)
