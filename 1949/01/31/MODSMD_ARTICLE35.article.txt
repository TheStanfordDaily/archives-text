WASHINGTONâ€”Opinion is wide
spread among educators that the
investigation by the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP) into the discharge of three
University of Washington profes
sors on grounds of Communist ac
tivity "promises to become another
Scott Nearing case."
In the '20's the AAUP was strong
ly criticized for upholding the right
of Nearing. a University of Penn
sylvania professor, to be a Social
ist. That right has now been gen
erally accepted, but the Washington
case brings Communism before the
AAUP for the first time.
