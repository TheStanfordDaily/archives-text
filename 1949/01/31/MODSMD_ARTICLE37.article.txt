Whether good or bad, there will always be a weather.
At least, there will always be a weather everywhere except in Hawaii.
The Hawaiians don't even have a word for it. yet they have ideal weather.
Imagine two people starting a conversation with "Nice something today"
in place of the usual.
Now there are even people that are trying to control the weather. The
rain-maker of the middle ages has finally come of age. A fellow flics
into a cloud, drops dry ice, rain gushes, drought is over, hurray-hurray,
frolicking in the rain-swept streets.
But they have found that even when you do something about the
weather, you still can't depend on it. For instance, residents of an Okla
homa town sent up their rain-maker to do his stuff. Meanwhile, the wind
came up. Result: It rained gloriously in a township nearby.
What a boon this is going to be to some sections of the country, though
this man-induced rain. But like any weather, it isn't perfect. At any
rate, people can't look for any gully-washers. For instance, if a cloud
i.; two miles thick and is standing still, the most moisture that will come
lament over the late Washington professors is shared by not a few
Even this will be a boon to some of the people down in the Texas Pan
handle, though .... not so much for the older settlers as lor the kids.
Some of the older settlers have seen rain.
For all-around weather, though, people will have to come to the Pa
cific Coast. "There's weather to suit every tasteâ€”some of the time," says
University of Washington's department of meteorolgy and climatology,
anyhow. Proving the point put forward, Professor Phil E. Church claimed
the highest and lowest temperatures; greatest and least annual rainfall
most rain in one minute; least rain in two years; most snow least fog'
the most and least sunshine.
If you like winter sports, try Verhoyansk, in the Province of Yakutsk
oiberia. Its the coldest inhabited place in the world, where Fahrenheit
temperatures hit as low as 90 degrees below zero.
To the other extreme, the heat record, for this country, is held at
degrees. That was in Death Valley, California, at "Greenland Ranch"
ironically enough, on July 10, 1913.
But even that isn't tops in temps. In Jefara, North Africa, it once
reached to the heights with a record 136.4 degrees.
If you like variety you might try taking a "jet to the moon. The tem
perature up there varies from 209 degrees Fahrenheit in full sunlight to
144 degrees below zero during its total eclipse.
