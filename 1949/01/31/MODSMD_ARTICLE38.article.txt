# Western Blizzards Boom Bars; Hurl Education
## 
### 
DENVER, Jan. 29 (^P). â€”Religion
and tormul education took a beating
and folks drank more whiskey.
At Rockport, Colo., a mother paid
a nickel for a buttered soda-cracker
to leed her hungry baby.
Las Vegas, Nev.. motorists paid
as much as $100 a set for tire chains.
Uninvited wildcats prowled the
streets of several northern Idaho
towns. And at Salt Lake City. Utah,
small bewildered bands of deer 1
moved into town and commenced
chomping the leaves off shrubbery
in the residential districts.
A helicopter raced the stork from
a Colorado farm home to an urban t
hospital.
These were but a few of the od
dities caused this month when na
ture tossed a series of Sunday
punches at the Western states. Res- !
idents of a region which is not j
known for its balmy winters learned
that most of the blizzards and cold
spells of past years were simply a
playful prelude to the big show: |
the big white production of Janu
ary. 1949.
On several occasions churches j
and schools went out of business
because of the 40-below mark.
The weather at Butte. Mont.,
stopped the watches of the ski tour
nev officials, freezing the viirk
parts.
The blizzards were ..specially
kind lo tavern owners and to per
sons who ordinarily struggle tor
plausible excuses to drink. At
Rockport. Colo., where 300 snow
stranded motorists and bus pas- 5
sengers were crammed into the ,
shelter of a beer hall, business was j
fine. A cup of weak soup sold for
30 cents. The more standard re
freshments of the place sold for
regular prices.
John Gillies of Chicago described
the jammed tavern as considerably '
like a "snake pit."
"There wasn't a square inch of
space to spare on the floor," he said.
"People slept in their clothes. They
used the windows for doors. There
were no sanitary facilities and the j
kids kept howling for something to
cat, or to go to the bathroom."
Forty-one-year-old Daniel Ryman
of Cheyenne. Wyo., used to think it
was a pretty simple thing to stroll
down to the grocery store and col
lect a bag of vittles. But the bliz
zard caught him between home and
store. Visibility dropped to zero.!
He stumbled around ("I don't know
how long") humping into telephone
poles and fire hydrants. But all the
houses .seemed to have disappeared. !
"I got so scared I started lighting |
matches to try and keep warm," he j
reca'ls. "The3' kept going out. Fi
nally there were no more matches."
He fell to his hands and knees in

' IHe snow and began yelling.
Jim Brisbie. 20. Walter Magnu
son. 26, and Lois Gordy, 20. all of
Miles City. Mont., spent 50 hours in
a stalled car. Lois said they learned
during their experience that: (1)
The best way to keep warm is to
wriggle like a worm." (2) "Just
plain living and breathing is a mir
acle."
The blizzards demonstrated that
the nation's railway system is not
an invincible thing.
Scores of slick super-trains were
| stalled throughout the West. In
j some instances the passengers had
i to use table pads from the dining
car a blankets. At Green River.
Wyo., where 1.200 passengers were
stranded, a young man from Walla
Walla. Wash, (himself a stranded
passenger), edited and published a
news sheet known as the Stalled
Train Ledger. Alfred McVay used
train porters and stewardesses as
men. They sifted the gosip
I from the various coaches snd Pull
man cars for the editor. He used a
duplicator machine at the train sta
| tion to get out the paper. Circula
! tion reached 800 before the trains
were able to leave.
At Kimball, Nob., dining-car
chefs took over the kitchen of a
j small hotel and did their cooking
there. Their 270 passengers moved
into the hotel. It became so crowd
ed that its patrons had to sleep in
shifts.
Among those aboard halted trains
were a group of Northwestern Uni
versity students, headed back for
j Chicago after the Rose Bowl game.
; They borrowed the largest theater
; in Cheyenne, Wyo.. put on a skit, a
parody of the moving picture,
"Rope." The audience enjoyed it.
There was no admission pri"" And
there was hardly any other place to
for recreation.
