# Current Library Exhibit Recalls Days Of First Farm President, Dr. Jordan
## 
### FRED M. SCOTT 
The exhibit currently on dis
play at the Library commemo
rating David Starr Jordan is in
honor of more than our Uni
versity's first president. Dr.
Jordan is responsible for having con
tributed a major part of Stanford's
most cherished traditions, and yet
we know very little about him.
David Jordan was a big man. He
stood well over six feet and was
naturally likable, a good speaker,
and friendly to everyone.
According to his close friend, Dr.
Edward Hume, "Dr. Jordan was in
terested in every vital phase of life."
He disliked details and ran his oflice
in a very informal manner.
When Professor Hume came to
Stanford as a freshman, he needed
a job and was sent to Dr. Jordan's
office as the only employment serv
ice on campus.
It has been rumored that several
freshmen were talking about the
president and one of them bet the
others that if he called Dr. Jordan
"David" he would not be repri
manded. His friends goaded him on,
and the boy accosted Dr. Jordan,
who was walking toward his office,
and said, "Pardon me, David, may I
ask you a question?"
"Certainly," replied the president
calmly. "But why be so formal?
Why not call me Dave?"
Grading System
One of Dr. Jordan's pet peeves
was red tape. During his administra
tion, there were no bawl-outs be
cause there were no grades. A stu
dent was given one of three marks
at the end of a course: a plus for
passing, minus for condition, and a
zero for failure. Dr. Jordan always
believed that a university should in
volve more than memorizing facts.
During his first years at Stanford
he stressed the ability to communi
cate as a prerequisite for teachers.
Most of the staff was young and
broad-minded and agreed with the
president's formula that if a good
teacher and an eager student were
.fitting on opposite sides of a log,
there was a university.
Freshman Lecture
The first Tuesday evening lecture

every fall was given by Dr. Jordan,
especially for the freshmen. He used
no notes. His subject was always
the same, "'The Value of Higher
Education," but his speech was al
ways different. Professor Hume was
most impressed by- his handling of
(he problem of mediocre teachers:
"I was once a freshman myself,
and 1 know that you think all your
teachers are going to be good. 1
wish that were possible, but a good
teacher is a rare person. If out of

your four years at Stanford you find
only a few good teachers, that is
enough. If you find only one, that
is enough. After all, only one per
son can educate you—you your
selves."

and 1 know that you think all your
teachers are going to be good. 1
wish that were possible, but a good
teacher is a rare person. If out of

your four years at Stanford you find
only a few good teachers, that is
enough. If you find only one, that
is enough. After all, only one per
son can educate you—you your
selves."


DAVID STARK JORDAN. Stanford's first president, is being currently
honored by a commemorative exhibit in the Library. Dr. Jordan was
one of California's most famous educators and scientists.
The exhibit currently on dis
play at the Library commemo
rating David Starr Jordan is in
honor of more than our Uni
versity's first president. Dr.
Jordan is responsible for having con
tributed a major part of Stanford's
most cherished traditions, and yet
we know very little about him.
David Jordan was a big man. He
stood well over six feet and was
naturally likable, a good speaker,
and friendly to everyone.
According to his close friend, Dr.
Edward Hume, "Dr. Jordan was in
terested in every vital phase of life."
He disliked details and ran his oflice
in a very informal manner.
When Professor Hume came to
Stanford as a freshman, he needed
a job and was sent to Dr. Jordan's
office as the only employment serv
ice on campus.
It has been rumored that several
freshmen were talking about the
president and one of them bet the
others that if he called Dr. Jordan
"David" he would not be repri
manded. His friends goaded him on,
and the boy accosted Dr. Jordan,
who was walking toward his office,
and said, "Pardon me, David, may I
ask you a question?"
"Certainly," replied the president
calmly. "But why be so formal?
Why not call me Dave?"
Grading System
One of Dr. Jordan's pet peeves
was red tape. During his administra
tion, there were no bawl-outs be
cause there were no grades. A stu
dent was given one of three marks
at the end of a course: a plus for
passing, minus for condition, and a
zero for failure. Dr. Jordan always
believed that a university should in
volve more than memorizing facts.
During his first years at Stanford
he stressed the ability to communi
cate as a prerequisite for teachers.
Most of the staff was young and
broad-minded and agreed with the
president's formula that if a good
teacher and an eager student were
.fitting on opposite sides of a log,
there was a university.
Freshman Lecture
The first Tuesday evening lecture

every fall was given by Dr. Jordan,
especially for the freshmen. He used
no notes. His subject was always
the same, "'The Value of Higher
Education," but his speech was al
ways different. Professor Hume was
most impressed by- his handling of
(he problem of mediocre teachers:
"I was once a freshman myself,
and 1 know that you think all your
teachers are going to be good. 1
wish that were possible, but a good
teacher is a rare person. If out of

your four years at Stanford you find
only a few good teachers, that is
enough. If you find only one, that
is enough. After all, only one per
