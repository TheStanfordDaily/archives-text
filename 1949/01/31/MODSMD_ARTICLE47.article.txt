# Indian Ruggers Smother University Club 11 to 0
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Indian ruggers continued their winning ways Saturday
as they rolled to a convincing, 11 to 0, victory over the Uni
versity Club. It was the third consecutive win for the Cards
and gives them a perfect 2-0 record in league play.
The deciding factor in Saturday s game was the outstanding

scrum piny of the Card forwards.
The aggressiveness of the Indian for
ward division was directly respon
sible for two scores, and their play
throughout the game kept the Club
men on the defensive most of the
time.
The lirst Card try came in the
early part of the first half when A 1
Morris, punting while on the run,
booted the ball over the enemy's
goal. Morris then proceeded to race
across the goal where he fell on the
ball for the score. Ed Culin's at
tempted conversion was wide.
Fcldman Scores
In the second half A 1 Turriziani
broke loose and almost went all the
way, but he was forced out of bounds
just short of the goal. At this point
the Indians pushed it over from
the scrum where Marty Feldman fell
on it. The Clubmen, led by big
Hank Borghi, ex-Cal rugger, pro
tested vehemently, claiming time
was out when the play started. The
try was disallowed, and a scrum was
called again at the same spot.
However, a moment later Bob
Lindsay, from his scrum half posi
tion. took the ball from the scrum
and ran it over for the score. Cu
lin's successful conversion with
George LeMaitre holding, made it
8 to 0.
A few minutes later the Cards al
most scored again. The forwards
led by Mick Lacheribruch, Mike
Sipio. and John Rosekrans started
a dribbling rush which was halted
on the 5-yard line. A scrum was
called and the ball was pushed
across, but a University Club man
retrieved the ball and kicked it out.
Boruk Breaks Loose
The final Card tally followed a
30-yard run by Holy Boruk. Boruk
was tackled on the Clubmen's 10-
yard line, but the Indian forwards
gained control of the ball and drib
bled it over the goal where Feld
man pounced on it for the try. Cu
lin's kick was wide.
The University Club threatened
to score on several occasions, but
brilliant defensive work by Vance
Sheffey at the fullback position cut
short these scoring threats.
Next week the Card ruggers will
continue their drive for the league
championship when they meet the
Olympic Club on the local field.

In the second half A 1 Turriziani
broke loose and almost went all the
way, but he was forced out of bounds
just short of the goal. At this point
the Indians pushed it over from
the scrum where Marty Feldman fell
on it. The Clubmen, led by big
Hank Borghi, ex-Cal rugger, pro
tested vehemently, claiming time
was out when the play started. The
try was disallowed, and a scrum was
called again at the same spot.
However, a moment later Bob
Lindsay, from his scrum half posi
tion. took the ball from the scrum
and ran it over for the score. Cu
lin's successful conversion with
George LeMaitre holding, made it
8 to 0.
A few minutes later the Cards al
most scored again. The forwards
led by Mick Lacheribruch, Mike
Sipio. and John Rosekrans started
a dribbling rush which was halted
on the 5-yard line. A scrum was
called and the ball was pushed
across, but a University Club man
retrieved the ball and kicked it out.
Boruk Breaks Loose
The final Card tally followed a
30-yard run by Holy Boruk. Boruk
was tackled on the Clubmen's 10-
yard line, but the Indian forwards
gained control of the ball and drib
bled it over the goal where Feld
man pounced on it for the try. Cu
lin's kick was wide.
The University Club threatened
to score on several occasions, but
brilliant defensive work by Vance
Sheffey at the fullback position cut
short these scoring threats.
Next week the Card ruggers will
continue their drive for the league
championship when they meet the
Olympic Club on the local field.

AI, MORRIS scored the first try
for the Indian ruggers in their
game with the University Club
last Saturday. The Cards emerged
victorious by an 11 to rt count.
The Indian ruggers continued their winning ways Saturday
as they rolled to a convincing, 11 to 0, victory over the Uni
versity Club. It was the third consecutive win for the Cards
and gives them a perfect 2-0 record in league play.
The deciding factor in Saturday s game was the outstanding

scrum piny of the Card forwards.
The aggressiveness of the Indian for
ward division was directly respon
sible for two scores, and their play
throughout the game kept the Club
men on the defensive most of the
time.
The lirst Card try came in the
early part of the first half when A 1
Morris, punting while on the run,
booted the ball over the enemy's
goal. Morris then proceeded to race
across the goal where he fell on the
ball for the score. Ed Culin's at
tempted conversion was wide.
