# Stanford Cagers Blast Hapless Panthers, 55 to 37
## DAILY Sports Yardley's 22-Point Splurge Sinks Pitt 
### JOHN HALL 
Ho-humming to their ljth win.
Stanford's easy-going cagers easily
outclassed Pittsburgh's pitiful Pan
thers Saturday night in the Cow-
Palace, 55 to 37.
An anemic crowd, half bored and
half frozen out of its skin, watched
the mumble-jumble Figure 8 fizzle,
as Stanford height and Yardley lay
ins overwhelmed the visiting Put
in en.
The Pittsburgh affair was a defi
nite contrast to the San Jose State
thriller of Friday night which the
Cards pulled out of the lire in the
last 15 econds. Pittsburgh had
nothing but its weave that didn't
jell, and Stanford extended its win
streak to six ior a season record of
17 out of 19.
Yardley from All Sides
George Yardley kept the yawn
ing crowd awake by tossing in an
amazing array of lay-ins and tips
for 22 points. The rest of the Stan
ford scoring was divided evenly be
tween the first ten men.
Pittburgh was the worst team to
face Stanford all season. The Pan
thers were afraid to shoot from far
ther than six feet out, and spent
most of their time trying to break
a man loose under the basket. But
instead of handling the ball well and
moving fast, the Pittmen dragged
through their weave, fumbled
passes, muffed lay-in, and looked
like untidy little boy trying to play
a man's game.
Had Everett Dean chosen to use
a zone defense, and had the officials
been a bit more exacting on the foul
calling, Pittsburgh might have been
held scoreless. That's how sad the
viitors were.
Cecconni Pitt's Best
Sammy David managed to dump
in 10 points for the doomed men,
but most of them came when Stan
ford was relaxing with a 20-point
lead. Most impresive of the yellow
clad invaders was Mike Cecconni. a
hard - working little fellow who
hawked the ball on defense and
scored Pitt's only long shots on of
fense for eight points.
Stanford started the contest with
a lightning attack that zoomed the
score to 16 to 4 in the first five min
utes. Most of the tallies came on
high passes to George Yardley who
dropped them through the net from
all angles.
The score was 29 to 12 at half
time, and Pitt was helpless. The
Panthers made only four shots out
of 31 attempts in the firt half.
Dean Pulls Kejriilars
The score had jumped to 41 to 23
at the 10-minute mark, and Ever
ett Dean kindly called off his regu
lars. as Stanford started to ease up.
By this time, the fans were heading
for home.
The game was strictly a breather.
Bill Rose got back into the starting
lineup, scored five points and threw
some nice passes, but didn't have a
chance to work hard.
Bill Stephenson took only a small
number of shots, and consequently
ended ti e evening with a season low
of one point. There just wasn't
anything to do.
Cow Palace Crowd Small
Frank Walsh, the man who pro
motes games for the Cow Palace,
must have felt pretty bad watching
the imported Panthers staggering
through their paces on his floor. He
must have also felt bad when he
took a look at the empty seats which
easily outnumbered the filled ones.

Ho-humming to their ljth win.
Stanford's easy-going cagers easily
outclassed Pittsburgh's pitiful Pan
thers Saturday night in the Cow-
Palace, 55 to 37.
An anemic crowd, half bored and
half frozen out of its skin, watched
the mumble-jumble Figure 8 fizzle,
as Stanford height and Yardley lay
ins overwhelmed the visiting Put
in en.
The Pittsburgh affair was a defi
nite contrast to the San Jose State
thriller of Friday night which the
Cards pulled out of the lire in the
last 15 econds. Pittsburgh had
nothing but its weave that didn't
jell, and Stanford extended its win
streak to six ior a season record of
17 out of 19.
Yardley from All Sides
George Yardley kept the yawn
ing crowd awake by tossing in an
amazing array of lay-ins and tips
for 22 points. The rest of the Stan
ford scoring was divided evenly be
tween the first ten men.
Pittburgh was the worst team to
face Stanford all season. The Pan
thers were afraid to shoot from far
ther than six feet out, and spent
most of their time trying to break
a man loose under the basket. But
instead of handling the ball well and
moving fast, the Pittmen dragged
through their weave, fumbled
passes, muffed lay-in, and looked
like untidy little boy trying to play
a man's game.
Had Everett Dean chosen to use
a zone defense, and had the officials
been a bit more exacting on the foul
calling, Pittsburgh might have been
held scoreless. That's how sad the
viitors were.
Cecconni Pitt's Best
Sammy David managed to dump
in 10 points for the doomed men,
but most of them came when Stan
ford was relaxing with a 20-point
lead. Most impresive of the yellow
clad invaders was Mike Cecconni. a
hard - working little fellow who
hawked the ball on defense and
scored Pitt's only long shots on of
fense for eight points.
Stanford started the contest with
a lightning attack that zoomed the
score to 16 to 4 in the first five min
utes. Most of the tallies came on
high passes to George Yardley who
dropped them through the net from
all angles.
The score was 29 to 12 at half
time, and Pitt was helpless. The
Panthers made only four shots out
of 31 attempts in the firt half.
Dean Pulls Kejriilars
The score had jumped to 41 to 23
at the 10-minute mark, and Ever
ett Dean kindly called off his regu
lars. as Stanford started to ease up.
By this time, the fans were heading
for home.
The game was strictly a breather.
Bill Rose got back into the starting
lineup, scored five points and threw
some nice passes, but didn't have a
chance to work hard.
Bill Stephenson took only a small
number of shots, and consequently
ended ti e evening with a season low
of one point. There just wasn't
anything to do.
Cow Palace Crowd Small
Frank Walsh, the man who pro
motes games for the Cow Palace,
must have felt pretty bad watching
the imported Panthers staggering
through their paces on his floor. He
must have also felt bad when he
took a look at the empty seats which

fense for eight points.
Stanford started the contest with
a lightning attack that zoomed the
score to 16 to 4 in the first five min
utes. Most of the tallies came on
high passes to George Yardley who
dropped them through the net from
all angles.
The score was 29 to 12 at half
time, and Pitt was helpless. The
Panthers made only four shots out
of 31 attempts in the firt half.
Dean Pulls Kejriilars
The score had jumped to 41 to 23
at the 10-minute mark, and Ever
ett Dean kindly called off his regu
lars. as Stanford started to ease up.
By this time, the fans were heading
for home.
The game was strictly a breather.
Bill Rose got back into the starting
lineup, scored five points and threw
some nice passes, but didn't have a
chance to work hard.
Bill Stephenson took only a small
number of shots, and consequently
ended ti e evening with a season low
of one point. There just wasn't
anything to do.
Cow Palace Crowd Small
Frank Walsh, the man who pro
motes games for the Cow Palace,
must have felt pretty bad watching
the imported Panthers staggering
through their paces on his floor. He
must have also felt bad when he
took a look at the empty seats which
easily outnumbered the filled ones.

Ho-humming to their ljth win.
Stanford's easy-going cagers easily
outclassed Pittsburgh's pitiful Pan
thers Saturday night in the Cow-
Palace, 55 to 37.
An anemic crowd, half bored and
half frozen out of its skin, watched
the mumble-jumble Figure 8 fizzle,
as Stanford height and Yardley lay
ins overwhelmed the visiting Put
in en.
The Pittsburgh affair was a defi
nite contrast to the San Jose State
thriller of Friday night which the
Cards pulled out of the lire in the
last 15 econds. Pittsburgh had
nothing but its weave that didn't
jell, and Stanford extended its win
streak to six ior a season record of
17 out of 19.
Yardley from All Sides
George Yardley kept the yawn
ing crowd awake by tossing in an
amazing array of lay-ins and tips
for 22 points. The rest of the Stan
ford scoring was divided evenly be
tween the first ten men.
Pittburgh was the worst team to
face Stanford all season. The Pan
thers were afraid to shoot from far
ther than six feet out, and spent
most of their time trying to break
a man loose under the basket. But
instead of handling the ball well and
moving fast, the Pittmen dragged
through their weave, fumbled
passes, muffed lay-in, and looked
like untidy little boy trying to play
a man's game.
Had Everett Dean chosen to use
a zone defense, and had the officials
been a bit more exacting on the foul
calling, Pittsburgh might have been
held scoreless. That's how sad the
viitors were.
Cecconni Pitt's Best
Sammy David managed to dump
in 10 points for the doomed men,
but most of them came when Stan
ford was relaxing with a 20-point
lead. Most impresive of the yellow
clad invaders was Mike Cecconni. a
hard - working little fellow who
hawked the ball on defense and
scored Pitt's only long shots on of
fense for eight points.
