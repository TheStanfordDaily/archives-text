### GIL JONAS 
The Stanford Braves dropped an
other game, their sixth straight, to
Modesto JC. GO-46. Friday in the
preliminary game at the Pavilion.
For the major part oi' the first
half, the win-starved JV's had great
difficulty in hitting the backboardâ€”
either their shooting was oft' or their
p?ssing was woeful. After Dick
C!e : ig tallied with a 25-foot one
hander on the opening pi ay. the
losers failed to sink a field goal
until the 10 - minute mark when
Clegs' repeated with a rebound
bucket. Meanwhile. the flashy
Modesto lads, snarked by John
O'Eoyle. former NYU frosh ace. and
Ken Milo, established a neat 17-
point total.
Bryan Scores
From that point the tide began to
turn in favor of the Braves as
speedy Gay Bryan whipped in. three
quick lay-ups and four free -throws
to narrow the margin to a more re
spectable 29-19 half-time. The
brunt of the Braves' scoring, how
ever. was accomplished against the
Modesto reserves.
Bryrm opened the final-half with
a quick-break lay-up and the blue
clad Modesto team retaliated with
big Lee Wade's two tip-ins and
Milo's pop shot and brace of fouls.
Scharfen interrupted the splurge
with a driving score from close in.
and Jack O'Sullivan followed with
a rebound shot. A volley of scor
ing exchanges ensued with Modesto
maintaining a 12-point. margin until
their reserves entered with 10 min
utes remaining in the fray.
t'se C; rid Tactics
With the cause lost, the Braves
resorted to some spirited gridiron
tactics with Dick Sehutte exhibit
ing some body contact that would
make Pod Frantz quiver.
O'Boyle and Milo led the victors
vith 12 points apiece. Gay Bryan
topped his mates with 13 points.
