handed shot in the dying seconds
of the game to give the Indians Â»
one-point, 50 to 49, basketball vic
tory over neighboring San Jost
j State.
With but 15 seconds remaining tc
! play, a screaming, almost hysterica'
Pavilion crowd of over 2.500 watcher
tall George Yareley break up a Sar
Jose stall, pick himself up off the
floor, and take a desperation 40-foot
j shot which Stephenson rebounded
and put up again for the game

Cards Trail
The Cards trailed badly through -
; out most of the contest, and were
I on the short end of a 27 to 21 count
iat half-time. But after the lunch
! hour the Deanmen went to work ir
| earnest, and on fine shooting by
i Yardley drew up into a 44 to 40
j lead with but five minutes to go.
But it was then that Spartans Str
; Inman and Don McCaslin solved
| the riddle of Stanford's tight man
j to-man defense and the pair drove
i in for heart-breaking lay-ups that
, wiped out the Card advantage. At
j the 18-minute mark San Jose led
49 to 4G and the blue-shirted Spar
| tans began to p 1 ay keep-away.
The Indians intercepted a pass
under their own bucket and Marv
I Gelber narrowed the gap to one
j point by promptly meshing a pretty
two-handed set shot from 25 feet
out.
(ins Steals the Ball
The final 55 seconds of the game
was a wild and woolly affair ir.
i which the Cares committed fou - .
| personal fouls trying to break uy
! the blue-shirt stall. Gag Chavalas
i took the ball away from his ma"
! and passed long to George Yardley
who was under the San Jose basket,
but referee Bobby Britt said that
Chavalas had stepped out of bounds
with the ba'l, and Yard ley's bucket
. was ruled no good. The Spartans
.once more inbounded the ball and
| Yardley immediately stole it away
I again to set up the winning score.
It was a tough one for the Spar
i tans to lose as they had the upper
hand throughout most of the con
test. The Indians seemed unable to
get their own pivot plays to work,
and had a tough time throttling Stu
Inman and San Jose's cleverly con
ceived screen offense. The red-hot
Spartans, obviously high for this
j one. outdid the lethargic Indians in
I evervthing but scoring.
