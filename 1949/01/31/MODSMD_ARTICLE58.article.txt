# Bridge Scores Decisive 'Slam' on Farm
## 
### GORDON ADDISON "I've been finessed 
So goes the phraseology that
is so meaningful to card sharks
from coast to coast. Whether
it's a cut-throat contract game at
the Stanford Bridge Club, a pick-up
at the Nitery, or a teach-one-another
session in the seculsion of a Roble
mom. bridge players always have
much in common.
Like the football squad, bridge
tennis each year schedule a Big
Game with their Berkeley rivals up
north. Last year's pre-game rally
before the Stanford-Cal bridge
tournament will go down as one of
the most enthusiastic gatherings in
recent Farm history. Yell-leader
Tom Elke's rendition of "Give 'Em
the Spade." together with the spirited
veils of the "howling 500." awoke

more than one student who was
studying in the nearby Education
lobrary. All over the campus, slo
gans such as "Club Cal," "Spade
the Bear," and "Have a Heart" were
plastered on the walls and windows
of buildings.
Team Out—Trumped
Still in the vulnerable position of
a new organization, however, the
Stanford team was out-trumped in
spite of strong hearts. This year the
team will again make a strong bid
for a grand slam over the Berkeley
"bridgers" when their Bii> Game
comes around next month.
Nitery Addict
The Bridge Club, open to all stu
dents, meets every Tuesday night in
the Women's Clubhouse for dupli
cate bridge games. One of the big
events of the spring bridge season is
the National Collegiate tournament
which the club enters. Top scores

ire sent in to the national rating
sheets, and players strive to make
the most out of each hand rather
than simply burying opponents un
der a manage of doubled and vul
nerable scores.
A glance in the Nitery on almost
any afternoon will disclose three or
four tables of bridge. This cross
section of Culbertson addicts is com
posed of hard, cold veterans. When
you don't try for an "obvious" slam,
when you miss a possible finesse,
when you forget to "get the kiddies
oft' the street"—you're strictly low
class. Just as many kibitzers as
players fill the Nitery when the
cards start flying. Besides the four
pairs of eyes guiding the players,
there are half a dozen more trying
to outguess the next lead.
A third group of players at Stan
ford are the dubs, the people who
timidly slip in one club bids when

they have five honor-count holdings.
This group hangs out in Roble, En
eina, or any other corner where stu
dents are trying to develop "social
graces."
But no matter where you go on
campus—whether it's the Nitery, a
fraternity living room, or a patch of
grass on Quad —those same conven
tional words always ring true, "Are
we playing Blackwood or Culbert
son?"

son?"
So goes the phraseology that
is so meaningful to card sharks
from coast to coast. Whether
it's a cut-throat contract game at
the Stanford Bridge Club, a pick-up
at the Nitery, or a teach-one-another
session in the seculsion of a Roble
mom. bridge players always have
much in common.
Like the football squad, bridge
tennis each year schedule a Big
Game with their Berkeley rivals up
north. Last year's pre-game rally
before the Stanford-Cal bridge
tournament will go down as one of
the most enthusiastic gatherings in
recent Farm history. Yell-leader
Tom Elke's rendition of "Give 'Em
the Spade." together with the spirited
veils of the "howling 500." awoke

more than one student who was
studying in the nearby Education
lobrary. All over the campus, slo
gans such as "Club Cal," "Spade
the Bear," and "Have a Heart" were
plastered on the walls and windows
of buildings.
Team Out—Trumped
Still in the vulnerable position of
a new organization, however, the
Stanford team was out-trumped in
spite of strong hearts. This year the
team will again make a strong bid
for a grand slam over the Berkeley
"bridgers" when their Bii> Game
comes around next month.
Nitery Addict
The Bridge Club, open to all stu
dents, meets every Tuesday night in
the Women's Clubhouse for dupli
cate bridge games. One of the big
events of the spring bridge season is
the National Collegiate tournament
which the club enters. Top scores

ire sent in to the national rating
sheets, and players strive to make
the most out of each hand rather
than simply burying opponents un
der a manage of doubled and vul
nerable scores.
A glance in the Nitery on almost
any afternoon will disclose three or
four tables of bridge. This cross
section of Culbertson addicts is com
posed of hard, cold veterans. When
you don't try for an "obvious" slam,
when you miss a possible finesse,
when you forget to "get the kiddies
oft' the street"—you're strictly low
class. Just as many kibitzers as
players fill the Nitery when the
cards start flying. Besides the four
pairs of eyes guiding the players,
there are half a dozen more trying
to outguess the next lead.
A third group of players at Stan
ford are the dubs, the people who
timidly slip in one club bids when

they have five honor-count holdings.
This group hangs out in Roble, En
eina, or any other corner where stu
dents are trying to develop "social
graces."
But no matter where you go on
campus—whether it's the Nitery, a
fraternity living room, or a patch of
grass on Quad —those same conven
tional words always ring true, "Are
we playing Blackwood or Culbert
son?"
