"ABEL MABEL," the Navy's new one-man attack plane, can take off with a gross weight of more than
29,000 pounds. The cratt is carrying three full-size torpedoes. 12 five-inch rwkets, and four 20-mm. aerial
cannon. Mabel's tremendous gross weight is believed to he the heaviest ever flown by a single-engine aircraft.
