# 'Yellow Sky' Good Formula Western
## 
### AL BERRY 
After nearly two years of
spasmodically attending the
Stanford Theater, we finally got
our 80 cents' worth! "Yellow
Sky" is a better-than-average
Western.
The flick i.s no "Red River." but

it misses being a great picture by
considerably less than most of the I
wonderful Westerns to come out of !
the golden suburb of West Los An- !
geles.
The picture manages this even
though following to the letter the
hackneyed Hollywood formula for
making financially successful flicks.
The formula: (1) Lotsa gun-play. (2)
beautiful heroine in dire danger. (3)
aged grandfather incapable of sav
ing day, (4) hero overcomes bad
tendencies and saves heroine. (5)
hero, in picture's last blast of vio
lence, guns down snarling villain,
(6) they (hero and shero) live hap
pily—oh, so happily—ever after with
grandpa.
Lots of Twists
That, roughly, is the plot of "Yel
low Sky," but it certainly does not
tell the story. Within the formula,
the plot has more twists than a tor
nado. but most of them are carried
oft' with excellent taste and likewise
acting.
Gregory Peck, leading a happy
band of cut-throats, quietly and ef
ficiently holds up a small Western
tank. In escaping they are forced
to cross 20 miles of salt flats. When
they arrive on the other side of the
flats at a ghost town called "Yellow
Sky," they have somehow acquired
a small thirst. Guess who is there
to lead them to water? Anne Bax
ter!
The plot then develops into a fight
between the happy band of outlaws
as to who will get Anne's grand
father's gold flr?t and who will get

Vnne fir-t. It is this latter conflict
; that holds the audience's interest
most, miss Baxter turns in some
! charming action when she pants
lustfully after Mr. Peck's lips have
' touched hers. Or as the 'teen-age
girl in front of us said: "Who's act
ing. yet?"
Peck Gets Baxter
As the formula demands, it is
soft-spoken Mr. Peck who gets Miss
Baxter in the end. and grandpa gets
all his gold. It is presumed that
grandpa has the courtesy to die soon
enough to let the couple have fun
with all that money.
Tup billing should go to Richard
Widmark who. of course, plays the
villain. Widmark is so sinister in
this one that even those of us who
; generally like villains were relieved
when Mr. Peck finally dispatched
him to climates warmer.
"Yellow Sky" is not a great mo
tion picture, but it is good enter
tainment. Sometimes violent, some
times genuinely moving, this pix is
one for 1949 that is worth seeing.

Western.
The flick i.s no "Red River." but

it misses being a great picture by
considerably less than most of the I
wonderful Westerns to come out of !
the golden suburb of West Los An- !
geles.
The picture manages this even
though following to the letter the
hackneyed Hollywood formula for
making financially successful flicks.
The formula: (1) Lotsa gun-play. (2)
beautiful heroine in dire danger. (3)
aged grandfather incapable of sav
ing day, (4) hero overcomes bad
tendencies and saves heroine. (5)
hero, in picture's last blast of vio
lence, guns down snarling villain,
(6) they (hero and shero) live hap
pily—oh, so happily—ever after with
grandpa.
Lots of Twists
That, roughly, is the plot of "Yel
low Sky," but it certainly does not
tell the story. Within the formula,
the plot has more twists than a tor
nado. but most of them are carried
oft' with excellent taste and likewise
acting.
Gregory Peck, leading a happy
band of cut-throats, quietly and ef
ficiently holds up a small Western
tank. In escaping they are forced
to cross 20 miles of salt flats. When
they arrive on the other side of the
flats at a ghost town called "Yellow
Sky," they have somehow acquired
a small thirst. Guess who is there
to lead them to water? Anne Bax
ter!
The plot then develops into a fight
between the happy band of outlaws
as to who will get Anne's grand
father's gold flr?t and who will get

Vnne fir-t. It is this latter conflict
; that holds the audience's interest
most, miss Baxter turns in some
! charming action when she pants
lustfully after Mr. Peck's lips have
' touched hers. Or as the 'teen-age
girl in front of us said: "Who's act
ing. yet?"
Peck Gets Baxter
As the formula demands, it is
soft-spoken Mr. Peck who gets Miss
Baxter in the end. and grandpa gets
all his gold. It is presumed that
grandpa has the courtesy to die soon
enough to let the couple have fun
with all that money.
Tup billing should go to Richard
Widmark who. of course, plays the
villain. Widmark is so sinister in
this one that even those of us who
; generally like villains were relieved
when Mr. Peck finally dispatched
him to climates warmer.
"Yellow Sky" is not a great mo
tion picture, but it is good enter
tainment. Sometimes violent, some
times genuinely moving, this pix is
one for 1949 that is worth seeing.
After nearly two years of
spasmodically attending the
Stanford Theater, we finally got
our 80 cents' worth! "Yellow
Sky" is a better-than-average
Western.
