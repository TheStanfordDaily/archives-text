### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 31 </P>. —
The United States is producing su
per A-bombs — substantially more
powerful than the missiles that
blasted Japan during World War 11.
The Atomic Energy Commission
made this disclosure today for the
first time in an official report to
Congress.
It announced that emergency de
fense measures have been taken to
safeguard the world's No. 1 secret
against sabotage and "against at
tack."
A major objective, the commis
sion reported, is a greatly stepped
up production of the two atomic
fuels—uranium 235, which is found
sparsely in raw ore, and the syn
thetic new element, plutonium.
To this end, officials said there is
now under way '"the biggest single
construction effort in American
peacetime history," which will
eventually cost more than $700,000,-
000.
