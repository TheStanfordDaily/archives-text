# University Foundry A Money Saver, But Hot and Noisy
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Is it tlie Hoboken iron works? Is
it a Kaiser shipyard? Is it Cal's
Stephens Union? No, it's the Stan
lord foundry.
From the corners of this large
laboratory, located directly behind
the clock tower, comes the clatter

of the .grinding machines, the smoke
and heat from the huge 500-degree
ovens, and the whir of the sand
slinger.
The foundry is operated largely
by the 50 engineering students who
spend their afternoons molding
equipments for the University as
well as numerous personal gadgets
such as anoiions, candlesticks, and
bookends. In addition to these ob
jects, tiie foundry has turned out
the much-publicized manhole cov
ers. lead bricks for Stanford's linear
aceleration testing equipment for
the math, physics, and metallurgy
departments, and the bronze class
plates placed in front of Memorial
Church.
The foundry received a financial
boost since the war in the form of
donations from the war surplus
centers and from outside sources.
One of the benefactors is the En
terprise Foundry of South San
Francisco, which presented the
foundry with a large oven worth
$2,000.
According to Professor D. L. Ma
son, head of the foundry, "As the
University deteriorates, scrap metal
accumulates, and we don't have to
buy any additional pig iron." A
look at the foundry scrap pile dis
closes heaps of old theater seats,
metal staircases, and boiler parts.
Brass, aluminum, and bronze are
brought separately, and sand with
a high silica content is sent from
Nevada.
Because of the addition of a new
technique, the sand conditioning
system, much of this excellent sand
can be salvaged from the old molds
in which it is used. The foundry
students use three giant furnaces:
the cupola, the electric arc, and the
crucible type.
While some of the fellows are
me 1 ting metal in the ovens, other
groups are serving as inolders, core
makers, and cleaners.

Is it tlie Hoboken iron works? Is
it a Kaiser shipyard? Is it Cal's
Stephens Union? No, it's the Stan
lord foundry.
From the corners of this large
laboratory, located directly behind
the clock tower, comes the clatter

of the .grinding machines, the smoke
and heat from the huge 500-degree
ovens, and the whir of the sand
slinger.
The foundry is operated largely
by the 50 engineering students who
spend their afternoons molding
equipments for the University as
well as numerous personal gadgets
such as anoiions, candlesticks, and
bookends. In addition to these ob
jects, tiie foundry has turned out
the much-publicized manhole cov
ers. lead bricks for Stanford's linear
aceleration testing equipment for
the math, physics, and metallurgy
departments, and the bronze class
plates placed in front of Memorial
Church.
The foundry received a financial
boost since the war in the form of
donations from the war surplus
centers and from outside sources.
One of the benefactors is the En
terprise Foundry of South San
Francisco, which presented the
foundry with a large oven worth
$2,000.
According to Professor D. L. Ma
son, head of the foundry, "As the
University deteriorates, scrap metal
accumulates, and we don't have to
buy any additional pig iron." A
look at the foundry scrap pile dis
closes heaps of old theater seats,
metal staircases, and boiler parts.
Brass, aluminum, and bronze are
brought separately, and sand with
a high silica content is sent from
Nevada.
Because of the addition of a new
technique, the sand conditioning
system, much of this excellent sand
can be salvaged from the old molds
in which it is used. The foundry
students use three giant furnaces:
the cupola, the electric arc, and the
crucible type.
