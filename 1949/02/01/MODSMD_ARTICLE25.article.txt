Nature can't make us perfect, so she did the next best thing—made us
blind to our faults.
I don't have any, myself. My girl says so. She loves me so much she
goes out with other guys just so I can get my proper rest.
She told me she was getting real fond of me—until the other night when
3 got fresh and spoiled it. She said she thought it was terrible how last
a man could undo everything.
Yes, what I hale to sec is that look of distrust in a woman's eyes when
I'm lying to her.
My grandmother was the same way. When she was a lass of flapper age
you can bet there would have been an awful family row if she had done

the things the modern maidens do. But since she
missed them then—she does them now.
She has always keen eager to help the needy. Last
week she was down town in Frisco and she spied a
particularly sorry-looking individual standing on a
street corner. She walked over to him and pressed u
dollar bill into his hand and said, "Chin up."
The next day, on the same corner, the same indi
vidual shuffled over to her and slipped a sawbuck
into her hand. "Nice pickin', lady," he said in a low
tone. "Paid nine to one."

Personally I think that to kiss a miss is awfully simple. To miss a kiss
is simply awful. Kissing spreads germs 'tis stated. But kiss me, kid. I'm
vaccinated!
Men aren't the only predatory creatures:
"Starry night, crescent moon;
Situation opportune.
Kuby lips,-slight mustache;
Combination, in a Hash.
Maiden speaks, whene'er she can.
Softly whispers, 'Naughty man.'
Pause a moment—and then:
Please be naughty, man, again."
Of course, the difference between kissing your grandmother and your
girl is considerable—as much as sixty seconds sometimes.
But no matter what the age, if a girl's lovemaking has a breezy technique
to it, all the boys soon get wind of it.
Keep in mind that to stay young one should associate with young people.
To get old in a hurry, one should try to keep up with them. Life no
longer begins at 40. It begins at 0400.

into her hand. "Nice pickin', lady," he said in a low
tone. "Paid nine to one."

Personally I think that to kiss a miss is awfully simple. To miss a kiss
is simply awful. Kissing spreads germs 'tis stated. But kiss me, kid. I'm
vaccinated!
Men aren't the only predatory creatures:
"Starry night, crescent moon;
Situation opportune.
Kuby lips,-slight mustache;
Combination, in a Hash.
Maiden speaks, whene'er she can.
Softly whispers, 'Naughty man.'
Pause a moment—and then:
Please be naughty, man, again."
Of course, the difference between kissing your grandmother and your
girl is considerable—as much as sixty seconds sometimes.
But no matter what the age, if a girl's lovemaking has a breezy technique
to it, all the boys soon get wind of it.
Keep in mind that to stay young one should associate with young people.
To get old in a hurry, one should try to keep up with them. Life no
longer begins at 40. It begins at 0400.
