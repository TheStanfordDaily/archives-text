## Spare Us Those Puns 
### 
To the Editor:
There seems evidenced lately among The Daily movie critics attempts
to assume airs of sophisticated criticism. Believe me, whereas the sophis
tication has succeeded nobly, the art of criticism has suffered horribly.
In particular, after seeing the movie, "The Paleface," starring Bob Hope
ar.d Jane Russell, one can hardly recognize it as the same movie "re
viewed" by "critic" A 1 Berry, and one can only wonder what prompted
him to say what he did. I suppose it was intended to be a "clever" piece
of writing—if so, it failed; it was neither witty nor clever. • The Paleface"
Is a delightful burlesque Western with plenty of blood-thirsty Indians,
' nasty fellows," and Bob Hope slapstick at its best.
A 1 Berry, however, pans it. That's all right—every man to his own
opinion, but the method he uses violates good taste. Mr. Berry ceases to
bt a critic when he begins wise-cracking and this he does from the first
sentence of his review to the last, inclusive. Let's not sacrifice good
critical sense for sophistication, but at any rate, please, Mr. Berry, spare
us those puns!
