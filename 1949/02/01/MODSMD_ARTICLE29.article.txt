# There's a Man Down There
## 
### BOB RIGNEY 
Hesitatingly I walked around the
lobby ot Mariposa wondering how
I was to lure down my Saturday
night date out of the mysterious
upper stories. No buzzer system,
no house mother, no human was in
sight. Tentatively I called up the
staircase but no answer came from
the silent rooms.
"Louanne," I bellowed, exhaust
ing my wind and any air of sophis
tication I might have had in one
breath. I sounded like a love-sick
moose or the winner of a hog-call
ing contest. Perhaps I was both.
But that bellow got results. "Lou
anne!" the cry was echoed by myr
iads of delicate female voices that
for tone could have been runners
up in the hog-Calling contest. It is
harcl to realize that those melodious
voices that answer the Mariposa
telephone could cover such a range
of nerve-jangling octaves.
"There's a man down there, Lou
anne," yelled a voice louder than
the rest. The voices paused for a
moment's silence, the only moment
of silence that I was to hear there.
"What does he look like?" asked
a bodiless voice.
"I don't know; I can't see."
"Where is he?"
"Over there. See?"
Heads suddenly appeared lining
the balustrade of the upper stair
well like a row of fat little black
birds perched on a telephone wire.
Hastily 1 beat a retreat to a more
obscure part of the living room.
Some alumna had better donate
money for soundproofing the walls
or at least enough money for a book
on etiquette, I thought as I tried to
thumb nonchalantly through sever
al dog-eared magazines heaped on
the table before me.
"Come out. come out, wherever
you are," sang the blackbirds on the
balustrade. I got up from my chair
and retreated behind it.
The song was interrupted with a
sudden fanfare. Then the itasalized
tones of a sideshow barker rang out,
"Here comes Louanne now!" Ea
gerly I started forward as I per
ceived Louanne was really at the
door. But I again retreated as the
self-appointed chorus swung into
"Here Comes the Bride."
"Good grief," I thought wildly, "I
only asked for a date, didn't I?"
Halfway to the nearest window I
again stopped. Relief and happiness
surged through me. What did I
have to worry about? Just the
day before I had heard that my date
was pinned to someone else.

"Come out. come out, wherever
you are," sang the blackbirds on the
balustrade. I got up from my chair
and retreated behind it.
The song was interrupted with a
sudden fanfare. Then the itasalized
tones of a sideshow barker rang out,
"Here comes Louanne now!" Ea
gerly I started forward as I per
ceived Louanne was really at the
door. But I again retreated as the
self-appointed chorus swung into
"Here Comes the Bride."
"Good grief," I thought wildly, "I
only asked for a date, didn't I?"
Halfway to the nearest window I
again stopped. Relief and happiness
surged through me. What did I
have to worry about? Just the
day before I had heard that my date
was pinned to someone else.
Hesitatingly I walked around the
lobby ot Mariposa wondering how
I was to lure down my Saturday
night date out of the mysterious
upper stories. No buzzer system,
no house mother, no human was in
sight. Tentatively I called up the
staircase but no answer came from
the silent rooms.
"Louanne," I bellowed, exhaust
ing my wind and any air of sophis
tication I might have had in one
breath. I sounded like a love-sick
moose or the winner of a hog-call
ing contest. Perhaps I was both.
But that bellow got results. "Lou
anne!" the cry was echoed by myr
iads of delicate female voices that
for tone could have been runners
up in the hog-Calling contest. It is
harcl to realize that those melodious
voices that answer the Mariposa
telephone could cover such a range
of nerve-jangling octaves.
"There's a man down there, Lou
anne," yelled a voice louder than
the rest. The voices paused for a
moment's silence, the only moment
of silence that I was to hear there.
"What does he look like?" asked
a bodiless voice.
"I don't know; I can't see."
"Where is he?"
"Over there. See?"
Heads suddenly appeared lining
the balustrade of the upper stair
well like a row of fat little black
birds perched on a telephone wire.
Hastily 1 beat a retreat to a more
obscure part of the living room.
Some alumna had better donate
money for soundproofing the walls
or at least enough money for a book
on etiquette, I thought as I tried to
thumb nonchalantly through sever
al dog-eared magazines heaped on
the table before me.

you are," sang the blackbirds on the
