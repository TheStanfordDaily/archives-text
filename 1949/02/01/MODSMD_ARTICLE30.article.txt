livan. veteran AP reporter and

lowing news review from the
background of his own extensive
war experience in China and the

covered the fighting in China
from 1942 to 1944 and for a time

NEW YORK (/P).—The U.S. is
losing the Pacific war to Communist
expansion and World War 111 is in
the making in the Orient, Maj. Gen.
Claire L. Chennault (ret.) warns.
But there's still time to do some
thing about it in China, he says, de
spite Chinese Communist military
victories that have forced General
issimo Chiang Kai-shek's National
ist regime near the brink.
The doughty Chennault, the first
American to fight the Japanese in
the air, swings a policy pen this
time pointed at Soviet aims to tip
the world balance of power in the
Far East and also at U.S. "brass
hat" bungling which he says con
tributed to China's civil war de
bacle.
Leader of the "Flying Tigers"
against the Japanese, and since
head of an airline in China, Chen
nault tells his story in "Way of a
Fighter," published Monday by G.
P. Putnam's Sons.
Stilwell. Marshall Blamed
His old CBI theater commander,
the late General Joseph Stilwell,
and former Secretary of State Mar
shall are singled out for special
criticism.
A complete Communist victory in
China, Chennault writes, could
touch oil: other victories in South
east Asia, giving the Reds a string
of bases from Saigon to Siberia.
"Then the stage will be set for the
unannounced explosion of World
War III."
He seriously questions that Rus
sia will make any more than prob
ing skirmishes in Europe until her
Asiatic flank is secure.
Insisting that it is not too late for
effective action in China, Chennault
holds that U.S. military aid should
be given top priority—that a mili
tary decision is necessary before po
litical and economic reforms can be
attained.
Small, Stout Force
"It is certainly not impossible for
a small force of stout men who know
the terrain to apply the best of mod
ern equipment against critical Com
munist weak spots and halt the ad

vance in its tracks," he writes. This
would save the lower Yangtze Val
ley and South and West China as a
base in which Chinese nationalism
could reorganize ..."
He apparently has in mind an air
force such as he led against the
Japanese invaders.
Gen. Marshall, who went to China
in the fall of 1945 as a special emis
sary, is blamed by Chennault for
forcing a truce in the civil war at
■> time when the Central Govern
ment forces were winning. U.S.
military aid was withheld, he re
lates, and eventually as the result
of truce moves the Chinese Com
munists got into Manchuria where
they had access to the Japanese mil
itary stockpile seized by the Rus
ians. Chennault estimates there was
sufficient materiel to equip one mil
lion men for 10 years of light
ing. The Communists subsequently
"chewed up" Nationalist divisions
running out of American supplies.
Impossible Orders
Chennault says Marshall had or
ders from the State Department
which were "utterly impossible to
carry out. They were given to him
by a State Department that was the
source of a Russian policy now ad
mitted to be a grievous error."'
Marshall's mission was to stop the
civil war and attempt to bring
about a coalition government in
cluding Chinese Communists.
"Marshall did not originate that
policy, and when he became Secre
tary of State he was the leader in
the fight to change it," Chennault
adds.
Stilwell-Chennault Feud
The Stilwell-Chennault feud and
the feud between Stilwell and
Chiang Kai-shek get extensive air
ings in the book.
Chennault declares that before
Stilwell was relieved of his CBI
command he had "poisoned Sino-
American relations for two critical
years and hamstrung effective Al
lied co-operation on the Asiatic
continent."
He details the final blowup be
tween Stilwell and Chiang over
Stilwell's insistence on supreme
command over the Chinese armies
when both had come to distrust and
loathe each other. He dwells on
Stilwell's "obsession" to retake
northern Burma from which he
walked out in retreat in an earlier
campaign, call the Stilwell road "a
worthless boondoggle," and scores
what he terms "Vinegar Joe's" vic
torious opposition to the Himalaya
hump airlift which carried most of
the supplies to China.

the terrain to apply the best of mod
ern equipment against critical Com
munist weak spots and halt the ad

vance in its tracks," he writes. This
would save the lower Yangtze Val
ley and South and West China as a
base in which Chinese nationalism
could reorganize ..."
He apparently has in mind an air
force such as he led against the
Japanese invaders.
Gen. Marshall, who went to China
in the fall of 1945 as a special emis
sary, is blamed by Chennault for
forcing a truce in the civil war at
■> time when the Central Govern
ment forces were winning. U.S.
military aid was withheld, he re
lates, and eventually as the result
of truce moves the Chinese Com
munists got into Manchuria where
they had access to the Japanese mil
itary stockpile seized by the Rus
ians. Chennault estimates there was
sufficient materiel to equip one mil
lion men for 10 years of light
ing. The Communists subsequently
"chewed up" Nationalist divisions
running out of American supplies.
Impossible Orders
Chennault says Marshall had or
ders from the State Department
which were "utterly impossible to
carry out. They were given to him
by a State Department that was the
source of a Russian policy now ad
mitted to be a grievous error."'
Marshall's mission was to stop the
civil war and attempt to bring
about a coalition government in
cluding Chinese Communists.
"Marshall did not originate that
policy, and when he became Secre
tary of State he was the leader in
the fight to change it," Chennault
adds.
Stilwell-Chennault Feud
The Stilwell-Chennault feud and
the feud between Stilwell and
Chiang Kai-shek get extensive air
ings in the book.
Chennault declares that before
Stilwell was relieved of his CBI
command he had "poisoned Sino-
American relations for two critical
years and hamstrung effective Al
lied co-operation on the Asiatic
continent."
He details the final blowup be
tween Stilwell and Chiang over
Stilwell's insistence on supreme
command over the Chinese armies
when both had come to distrust and
loathe each other. He dwells on
Stilwell's "obsession" to retake
northern Burma from which he
walked out in retreat in an earlier
campaign, call the Stilwell road "a
worthless boondoggle," and scores
what he terms "Vinegar Joe's" vic
torious opposition to the Himalaya
hump airlift which carried most of
the supplies to China.

NEW YORK (/P).—The U.S. is
losing the Pacific war to Communist
expansion and World War 111 is in
the making in the Orient, Maj. Gen.
Claire L. Chennault (ret.) warns.
But there's still time to do some
thing about it in China, he says, de
spite Chinese Communist military
victories that have forced General
issimo Chiang Kai-shek's National
ist regime near the brink.
The doughty Chennault, the first
American to fight the Japanese in
the air, swings a policy pen this
time pointed at Soviet aims to tip
the world balance of power in the
Far East and also at U.S. "brass
hat" bungling which he says con
tributed to China's civil war de
bacle.

against the Japanese, and since

Stilwell. Marshall Blamed
His old CBI theater commander,
the late General Joseph Stilwell,
and former Secretary of State Mar
shall are singled out for special
criticism.
A complete Communist victory in
China, Chennault writes, could
touch oil: other victories in South
east Asia, giving the Reds a string
of bases from Saigon to Siberia.
"Then the stage will be set for the
unannounced explosion of World
War III."
He seriously questions that Rus
sia will make any more than prob
ing skirmishes in Europe until her
Asiatic flank is secure.
Insisting that it is not too late for
effective action in China, Chennault
holds that U.S. military aid should
be given top priority—that a mili
tary decision is necessary before po
litical and economic reforms can be
attained.

NEW YORK (/P).—The U.S. is
losing the Pacific war to Communist
expansion and World War 111 is in
the making in the Orient, Maj. Gen.
Claire L. Chennault (ret.) warns.
But there's still time to do some
thing about it in China, he says, de
spite Chinese Communist military
victories that have forced General
issimo Chiang Kai-shek's National
ist regime near the brink.
The doughty Chennault, the first
American to fight the Japanese in
the air, swings a policy pen this
time pointed at Soviet aims to tip
the world balance of power in the
Far East and also at U.S. "brass
hat" bungling which he says con
tributed to China's civil war de
bacle.
Leader of the "Flying Tigers"
against the Japanese, and since
head of an airline in China, Chen
nault tells his story in "Way of a
Fighter," published Monday by G.
P. Putnam's Sons.
Stilwell. Marshall Blamed
His old CBI theater commander,
the late General Joseph Stilwell,
and former Secretary of State Mar
shall are singled out for special
criticism.
A complete Communist victory in
China, Chennault writes, could
touch oil: other victories in South
east Asia, giving the Reds a string
of bases from Saigon to Siberia.
"Then the stage will be set for the
unannounced explosion of World
War III."
He seriously questions that Rus
sia will make any more than prob
ing skirmishes in Europe until her
Asiatic flank is secure.
Insisting that it is not too late for
effective action in China, Chennault
holds that U.S. military aid should
be given top priority—that a mili
tary decision is necessary before po
litical and economic reforms can be
attained.
Small, Stout Force
"It is certainly not impossible for
a small force of stout men who know
the terrain to apply the best of mod
ern equipment against critical Com
munist weak spots and halt the ad

vance in its tracks," he writes. This
would save the lower Yangtze Val
ley and South and West China as a
base in which Chinese nationalism
could reorganize ..."
He apparently has in mind an air
force such as he led against the
Japanese invaders.
Gen. Marshall, who went to China
in the fall of 1945 as a special emis
sary, is blamed by Chennault for
forcing a truce in the civil war at
■> time when the Central Govern
ment forces were winning. U.S.
military aid was withheld, he re
lates, and eventually as the result
of truce moves the Chinese Com
munists got into Manchuria where
they had access to the Japanese mil
itary stockpile seized by the Rus
ians. Chennault estimates there was
sufficient materiel to equip one mil
lion men for 10 years of light
ing. The Communists subsequently
"chewed up" Nationalist divisions
running out of American supplies.
Impossible Orders
Chennault says Marshall had or
ders from the State Department
which were "utterly impossible to
carry out. They were given to him
by a State Department that was the
source of a Russian policy now ad
mitted to be a grievous error."'
Marshall's mission was to stop the
civil war and attempt to bring
about a coalition government in
cluding Chinese Communists.
"Marshall did not originate that
policy, and when he became Secre
tary of State he was the leader in
the fight to change it," Chennault
adds.
Stilwell-Chennault Feud
The Stilwell-Chennault feud and
the feud between Stilwell and
Chiang Kai-shek get extensive air
ings in the book.
Chennault declares that before
Stilwell was relieved of his CBI
command he had "poisoned Sino-
American relations for two critical
years and hamstrung effective Al
lied co-operation on the Asiatic
continent."
He details the final blowup be
tween Stilwell and Chiang over
Stilwell's insistence on supreme
command over the Chinese armies
when both had come to distrust and
loathe each other. He dwells on
Stilwell's "obsession" to retake
northern Burma from which he
walked out in retreat in an earlier
campaign, call the Stilwell road "a
worthless boondoggle," and scores
what he terms "Vinegar Joe's" vic
torious opposition to the Himalaya
hump airlift which carried most of
the supplies to China.
