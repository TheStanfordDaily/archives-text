### BERNARD AURENTZ 
Charles A. Beard (God rest his
soul), quoting a British wit, in his
introduction to "The Idea of Prog
ress" by J. B. Bury: "The power
which a concept wields over human
life is nicely proportioned to the
degree of error in it."

"Nature can produce pupils more
quickly than it can produce teach
ers."—The New Yorker
"Nature can produce animal
trainers more quickly than it can
produce parrots." — Bernard Au
rentz

who think, a tragedy to those who
feel."—Bill S.
* * *
From Wally Frank's "Pipe and
Tobacco Catalog": ". . . When our
pipe expert early this year went
back to England, he was ordered to
get a popular priced "Sunburst"
English pipe. To go into the details
of how he accomplished this seem
ingly imposisble task—how he ca
joled department heads—how he
spent hours with production men in
earnest persuasion at the local pub
to get this special "Sunburst" type
of briar, would fill a book three
times this size . .

Richard A. Lester in "Economics
(H Labor": "Statistics are generally
dull, but income figure are so star
tling that politicians frequently
quote them to their constituents."

Harry Gilroy, quoting W. Somer
set Maugham in "How to Write- By

Maugham" in the New V ork Times
Magazine: "I don't understand
symbolism in fiction. It is only a
tashion of the day, so far as I can
judge, and it will disappear. What
is a symbol? You say one thing
and mean another. Why the hell
shouldn't you say it right out?"
♦ * *
"Along the Highways and By
ways of Finance" by Robert H. Fet
ridge in the New York Times: . .
Dr. Sumner SHchter, the Harvard
economist, has estimated that cor
porations in the three last years
overstated their earnings to the
tune of $10,400,000,000 and the rea
sons for this arc many, including
the fact that accounting methods
have not been brought 'nto line
with current conditions. Probably
correct from an accounting stand
point, one observer remarked, but
a bit hollow from the standpoint of
stability."

Classroom notes:
Famous first remarks: "I will
make a serious bid for popularity
by announcing I shall not lecture to
you tomorrow. With that prospect
from intellectual resistance, let us
proceed."
As the late arriving troops pa
raded in nonchalant review around
the classroom, the professor stop
ped in the middle of a meaty, eru
dite sentence to remark, "Some
times I think I understand Euro
peans who make a great virtue of
orderly' existence."
A professor, speaking of Czar Al
exander: "He turned his mind to
th darker, pathological recesses of

mysticism." And again: "The Brit
ish , fn capturing Napoleon in his
flight to the United States, pre
vented us from receiving a new im
migrant. and possibly distinguished
citizen."

"Time's Causeway" by Christie.
Jeffries in the New York Times:
Above the marsh of sorrow, beyond
tears
Time, like a patient, careful work
man, rears
A Causeway, which grows to a
monument,
Symbol of strength which comes
when grief is spent.

Morris Kaplan in "Rumblings in
the Fraternities" in Ihe Now York
Times Magazine: "The 'Amherst af
iair' resulted, however, from 110 of
ficial stand by the college itself but
rather from undergraduate action.
It began when Amherst's chapter
of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity
pledged Thomas W. Gibbs, a 19-
year-old Negro from Evanston, 111.
The fraternity's national organiza
tion frowned on the move. The lo
cal chapter, which includes Jews
and Catholics as well as Protestants,
stuck by its guns. Gibbs was ini
tiated and the chapter was suspend
ed. It then set up as an independ
ent fraternity.

set Maugham in "How to Write- By

Maugham" in the New V ork Times
Magazine: "I don't understand
symbolism in fiction. It is only a
tashion of the day, so far as I can
judge, and it will disappear. What
is a symbol? You say one thing
and mean another. Why the hell
shouldn't you say it right out?"

"Along the Highways and By
ways of Finance" by Robert H. Fet
ridge in the New York Times: . .
Dr. Sumner SHchter, the Harvard
economist, has estimated that cor
porations in the three last years
overstated their earnings to the
tune of $10,400,000,000 and the rea
sons for this arc many, including
the fact that accounting methods
have not been brought 'nto line
with current conditions. Probably
correct from an accounting stand
point, one observer remarked, but
a bit hollow from the standpoint of
stability."

Classroom notes:
Famous first remarks: "I will
make a serious bid for popularity
by announcing I shall not lecture to
you tomorrow. With that prospect
from intellectual resistance, let us
proceed."
As the late arriving troops pa
raded in nonchalant review around
the classroom, the professor stop
ped in the middle of a meaty, eru
dite sentence to remark, "Some
times I think I understand Euro
peans who make a great virtue of
orderly' existence."
A professor, speaking of Czar Al
exander: "He turned his mind to
th darker, pathological recesses of

mysticism." And again: "The Brit
ish , fn capturing Napoleon in his
flight to the United States, pre
vented us from receiving a new im
migrant. and possibly distinguished
citizen."

"Time's Causeway" by Christie.
Jeffries in the New York Times:
Above the marsh of sorrow, beyond
tears
Time, like a patient, careful work
man, rears
A Causeway, which grows to a
monument,
Symbol of strength which comes
when grief is spent.

Morris Kaplan in "Rumblings in
the Fraternities" in Ihe Now York
Times Magazine: "The 'Amherst af
iair' resulted, however, from 110 of
ficial stand by the college itself but
rather from undergraduate action.
It began when Amherst's chapter
of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity
pledged Thomas W. Gibbs, a 19-
year-old Negro from Evanston, 111.
The fraternity's national organiza
tion frowned on the move. The lo
cal chapter, which includes Jews
and Catholics as well as Protestants,
stuck by its guns. Gibbs was ini
tiated and the chapter was suspend
ed. It then set up as an independ
ent fraternity.

of sentiment in the name of practi
