# Huntington Park Judge Says Friendship Clubs Are Legal
## 
### 
HUNTINGTON PARK, Jan. 31
OP). â€”Justice of the Peace Stanley
MofTatt ruled today that Califor
nia's Pyramid Friendship Clubs are
not a lottery. He acquitted Robert
H. Miller of Bell Gardens of a
charge of violating (he state lottery
law by holding a Pyramid Club
meeting.
The court ruling followed a hec
tic day in the auditorium of a school
building. The justice court was too
small to accommodate a cheering
and partisan crowd of 300 persons.
Deputy District Attorney Thomas
Cochrane stalked angrily out of the
hearing after repeated clashes with
Judge Moftatt.
"This is not a bona fide prosecu
tion, shouted Cochrane. "This trial
is a total nullity. The district at
torney is not interested in a ficti-

tious affair. I desire to withdraw
from the ease."
Judge MofTatt granted the motion
"with pleasure" and the crowd
cheered lustily.
Pyramid Friendship Ciubs began
to flourish in Southern California
early this month, promising mem
bers that for $1 they would get
back $2,048 when names at the
bottom reached the top of a pyra
mid at the end of 12 weekly meet
ings.
"It seems there is not enough
crime in Los Angeles, and, for that
reason, police have been pushing
housewives around," Judge MofTatt
said. "I've been asked if the pyra
mid plan is illegal. I said I didn't
know and 1 thought there should be
a test, case."
Alter the deputy district attor
ney withdrew, Judge MofTatt con
tinued the hearing.
