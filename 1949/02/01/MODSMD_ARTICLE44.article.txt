## INTRAMURAL Toyon Dumps Oldsters 31-24 
### 
Toyon 213 uncorked a stretch
drive against the Oldsters in last
night's feature intramural contest
to score a 31-24 victory, but only
after trailing throughout most of
the contest.
The Oldsters jumped into an ear
ly lead, thai ks mainly to a smooth
working 1-ist break and some clever
ball-handling, and led at half-time
by a coi n't of 13-7. Zunger was
particuh riy effective for the Old
sters during the first hatf.
The lads from Toyon came back
with a vengeance, however, at the
opening whistle of the second half,
and within eight minutes had whit
tled the Oldsters' lead down to two
points. Seibel knotted it up at 22-
al!, and 213 finished out the con
test going away as Schouweider and
Bullock caught fire in the final mo
ments.
With forward Blair leading the
way, the Kappa Sigs downed a
stubborn Phi Delt squad 26-16 with
a fourth-quarter splurge that put
the battle on ice. The defensive
â€¢play of both teams dominated the
first half of play, which ended 10-8
in favor of the Kappa Sigs; but Art
Adams tied it up with a set shot to
start the second half, and from that
point on the fast-breaking Kappa
Sigs had things much their own
way.
Blair and Adams were both out
standing for the winners, Blair
claiming high-point honors for his
evening's work.
In another mural contest played
last night, Delta Tau's Pawns wal
loped Theta Chi II by 34-1(5 as
Bradshaw netted 14 points for the
winners.'
