Cow Palace Should (Hick
As LIU, N\(X, Hit Town
If Frank Walsh doesn't pack em in at his Cow Palace this week, ho
might as well throw in the towel. Walsh, who has been losing sleep latelv
ccuntmg empty seats, has finally lined up an array of talent that should
encourage any loyal cage fan to brave the cold, the ride, and what have
you, to tfet h looksee at what's going on.
Topped by a list of such notables as CCNY. LIU, USF. Stanford USC
and St. Mary's the Cow Palace should see its best attendance of the

The two famous New York teams, Clair Bee's Long Island University
squad and Nat Holman s City College of New York, alone, should be
enoueh drawing power to pack the place.
LlU's Blackbirds, whose record includes sensational win streaks of 43
and 41 straight games against big time competition, will play Santa Clara
It will be their first appearance in these parts, and you can expect
C'air Bees boys to give it the go-gettum stuff, as they set out to please
the Bay Area fans.
Of more importance to Stanford is the scheduled appearance of Nat
Ho man s City College Beavers. CCNY. tops in Eastern cage circles, will
tackle Stanford Friday night, and will face USF on Saturday night. CCNY
has won 11 and lost 2 so far this season.
At an\ rate, the Cow Palace has come up with some beautiful tilts
lor the coming weekend, and if all goes well. Frank Walsh will be able
to kiss those empty seats good-bye.

finishing up. There you have it, the Bay Area's best (Stanford and USF)
the two prides and joys of New York, and USC's Trojans thrown in. to
add up to a terrific cage menu.
Yardley Gains Backers
Recently the Los Angeles Times published a little George Yardley pro
paganda that should be worthwhile to pass along to all the local Yardley
..ukns. If George Yardley isn't careful, he may grow up to be a tail
legend like Hank Luisetti and the two bridges and cable cars.
Game by game, the long blond from Balboa begins to shape up as the
tnird of Stanford's modern-era greats." (Others being Jim Pollard and
Hankus-Pankus Luisetti.)
Coach Pete Newell of USF's dapper Dons also had a quote to offer about
H e blond birdman. "Yardley is the Pacific Coast's greatest collegiate back
board man since Jim Pollard. He is absolutely tops as a control man at
Cither backboard."
All of which are very sweet little words about George. He has already
earned the award for being the outstanding player in the PCC. so when the
All-American fives start rolling off the presses, George's name should see
a little print.
Globetrotters Here
Harlem's Happy Globetrotters, lending their color to an already «t*u
siudded weekend of Bay Area basketball, will invade Kezar tomorrow
night to amaze patrons with their out-of-this-world antics. House of
David will furnish the competition, or at least be straight men for the act.
Traveling with the Globetrotters are Jesse Owens and the champion
ping pong team of Cartland and Cook. They perform at half-time. Any
thing to get the fans out for the games this year.
Anyway, there s a lot of basketball] going on.
