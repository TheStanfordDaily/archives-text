## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. .11 (/P).â€”
Gene Bearden, Cleveland Indians'
pitching star who carries a plati
num plate in his head and another
in his leg as a result of war inju
ries, tonight was named "most cour
ageous athlete of 1948" by the Phil
adelphia Sports Writers' Associa
tion.
Bearden. World Series hero and
American League rookie of the
year, was honored at the annua!
writers' banquet along with his
manager. Lou Boudreau, who was
named the "outstanding athlete of
the year."
Charley Bednarik, Penn football
star, was honored as "lineman of

i the year."
The 27-year-old native of Helena.
Ark., was almost given up for dead
alter suffering injuries in the sink
ing of the USS Heleiid in the Pa
cific. But he rallied and with the
; aid of surgery that filled him with
| platinum plates, returned to good
I health.
Won 20 in First Year
The partial !oss of mobility in
Bearden's right leg didn't stop him
from winning 20 games in his first
full year as a major leaguer. It
didn t prevent him from tossing a
shutout in his first World Series
tjame and from turning back the
challenging Boston Braves in the
| final 1948 series game to win the
world's baseball title for Cleveland.
Bearden saved that final game in
relief of Bob Lemon.
The wavv-haired southpaw actu
ally was a throw-in in the deal that
brought him to Cleveland. He was
i sent along as excess baggage in the
trade that brought Allen Gettel and
Hal Peck to Cleveland and sent
Ray Mack and Sherman Lollar to
the New York Yankees.
Bearden captured top American
League pitching honors for the year
with a remarkable 2.43 earned run
average.
