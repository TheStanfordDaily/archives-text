# Mittmen Meet Bruins Friday
## 
### 
Stanford Pavilion will rock and
sway Saturday night under thy
force of the punches of two of the
finest boxing squads on the coast.
Starting at 8 p.m., Ray Lunny's
varsity sluggers will test their un
defeated record before the on
slaught of- the equally successful
UCLA Bruins in what promises to
be the outstanding fistic attraction
ol the year for local fight fans.
The Bruins are currently favored
to cop the coast championship, but
mentor Ray and his charges aren't
quite so optimistic about the
chances of the potent punchers from
Westwood. Ever-cautious Ray isn't
making any predictions, of course;
but the dapper Card coach is con
fident that his boys will make an
impressive showing.
Feature event of the evening's
hostilities will pit big Mike Pel
singer, his split eye now completely
healed, against Bruin Bob Edwards,
a ISO-pounder who fought for Mo
desto JC before drifting to the Los
Angeles campus. Mike was also a
JC belter until this year, and the
pre-fight form sheet calls this one
all even.
Two Light-heavy Bouts
The outstanding ten - bout card
also includes two light-heavyweight
matches. Hard-punching Jim Ham
mond, Card 175-pounder who has
tallied one knockout and one deci
sion in his two outings to date, will
slug it out with Les Goodman in the
top offering in this division. The
other light - heavy battle will see
Stanford's Jim Vatcher in his first
bout of the year against southerner
Marc Kaufman.
Another treat for Farm fight fans
will be the first local appearance of
speedy Fred Ten Eyck, probably
the handiest boxer on Lunny's
crew. Ten Eyck. who found him
self on the short end of a highly
questionable and unpopular deci
sion in his only performance of the
year at Santa Clara two weeks ago.
will match his talents with those of
Don Hubbard in the 165 - pound
event.
Willie Altus and Pete Willett will
handle the 155-pound chores for the
Indians against the invaders' Irwin
Thompson and Bob Small. Altus, a
three-year varsity veteran, has won
two clear-cut decisions so far this
season, while Willett drew in his
only match at SanLa Clara.
Anderson to Rattle Rabin
Alan Anderson will carry a one
nd one record into the ring for
the Indians in the 145-pound class;
slugging for the Bruins in this di
vision will be Pete Babin. who let
tered at 155 pounds last year but
trimmed down to the lighter weight
this season.
Card lightweight Jay Savage will
trade punches with the veteran of
the Westwood aggregation, Mike
Furlong, now slinging the leather
in his third year for the Bruins.
Stanford's Max Money faces Sam
McGruder in the second light
weight tussle.
Little Bob Baker will touch oft
the evening's fireworks for the In
dians when he squares off in the
130-pound opener against UCLA's
Chuck Stenonce.
Officials for the match will be
Frankie Brown, referee; Jack Rice
Vein Bybce, judges; and Harry
Pulley, timekeeper.
