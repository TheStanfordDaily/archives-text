## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
As the last sets from"The
Hairy Ape" were dragged from
the stage in the Little Theater
Sunday after a successful four
nicjht run, scenery and furni
turo for "Build No Fence Around
Me" were rushed into place for first
dress rehearsals of the production,
which is to open tomorrow.
All tickets for the "Build No Fence
Around Me" six-night stand are sold
out. A few are left for the Saturday
matinee which are available at the
box office in front of Memorial Hall
from i) a.m. to 5 p.m.
The forthcoming play is being pro
duced for the first time on any stage,
and its staging is considered to be
equivalent to a pre-Broadvvay trial.
The play has been optioned by
Elia Kazan and George Abbott, both
noted Broadway producers. In the
event of its success here, the show
may 140 on to New York, and there
is a stiong possibility that Jane Dar
well may go with it.
Represents Trend
The first showing of this play at
Stanford represents a trend through
out the nation in the last few years
to decentralize the theater from its
concentration in New York and a
few other centers. This movement
has been largely developed through
the facilities of various universities
throughout the country. Stanford
has been among the foremost of
these.
Stanford has contributed to this
movement through its "junior artist
in residence" plan, now moving into
its third year. It is the only school
to which funds are allocated for this
purpose by the National Theater
Conference.
The group, which will begin a
five-months' stay here in March to
help and act with students of the
drama department, includes three
iclors and two technical directors.

on a previous $500 grant. She has

was also director of speech at the

one year ol professional radio in

Chicago, played in the Broadway
production of "Pygmalion," with
Gertrude Lawrence. She appeared

Radio, TV Work
John McLiam of New York has

-1 ther Adler in "End of Silence," and

vision, and movie work. James

'tended four universities (Illinois,
