WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (AP)
—The hot fight over the Truman
Labor Bill opened today in Con
gress. Secretary of Labor Tobin
called for its enactment, and
Republicans immediately objected
that it had '"no teeth'' to deal with
union leaders like John L. Lewis.
In both House and Senate today,
administration chiefs put the spurs
to the President's bills as the big
program ground through committee
hearings, with economic bills in the
lead.
At the White House, Speaker Ray
burn (D-Tex.) told the President
that the tariff bill—the administra
tion's move to restore reciprocal
trade agreements legislation to its
original form—will be taken up in
the House next week. The bill would
wipe out restrictions voted by the
Republican Congress clipping Presi
dential authority to cut tariffs in
agreement with other nations.
Rayburn said early House action is
in prospect on Mr. Truman's de
mand for an increase from 40 to 75
cents in the national minimum wage
Hearings may end Friday. In the
House Labor Committee, the West
ern Union Telegraph Company asked
that any new wage-hour law exempt
some of its part-time workers in
small communities.
Republican senators grilled Sec
retary of Labor Tobin about opera
tion of the administration's proposed
substitute bill for the Taft-Hartley
Labor Act.
Lewis, though absent, dominated

the hearing before the Senate Labor
Committee on the administration
bill, which would repeal the Taft-
Hartley Act. and replace it with an
"improved" Wagner Act.
Much of the discussion centered
on an administration proposal to
wipe out the Taft-Hartley Law
power to block "national emergency"

i strikes by means of court injunc-
I tions.
Tobin said this provision should
j be scuttled and replaced with a 30-
i day voluntary cooling off procedure.
Tobin argued that settlement rec
ommendations by emergency boards
: under the cooling off procedure
would be backed by the "powerful
i force" of public opinion. He said
I that would do the trick and prevent
strikes affecting national health oi
i safety.
In assailing the Taft-Hartley Law
: and plugging for a new labor law
I "encouraging free collective bargain
ing." Tobin read a 20-page state
ment. When he finished there was
| less than an hour left for commit
| tee questioning.
