# New Snows, Winds Hit East Nevada
## Blizzard Halts Hay Lift to Cattle 
### 
ELY, Nev., Feb. 1 (AP)â€”A
new snowstorm moved east
ward across Nevada late today,
temporarily halting the hay lift
to thousands of livestock already
floundering in the worst snows
in the state's history.
The U.S. weather bureau at Reno
issued a special warning to stock
men to prepare for a storm of bliz
zard proportions tomorrow and
Thursday, followed by "abnormal
cold and high north winds."
Stockmen feared that more snow
and wind may undo everything that
has been accomplished in the last
week toward keeping alive starving
cattle and sheep marooned in huge
snowdrifts.
The hay lift operation from the
Fallon air base in western Nevada
was halted early this afternoon on
the storm forecast.
In California
The storm moved across the north
ern Nevada-California border this
afternoon. It was expected to blank
et the entire northern portion of the
state and part of Utah with very
heavy snow during' the next two
days.
Meanwhile, William B. Wright,
past president of the American Na
tional Livestock Association and a
big cattle raiser in northeastern Ne
vada, described the Nevada hay lift
as "more dramatic than effective."
"The situation in Nevada, where
the airlift idea may have been orig
inated,* and certainly where the pub
licity is running wild, needs a little
amplification," said Wright in a press
statement at Elko.
