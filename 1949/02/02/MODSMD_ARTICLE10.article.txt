# Norway Set To Line Up With West
## Oslo Overrides Red Objections 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. I—(AP)
—The State Department was ob
viously pleased tonight by Nor
way's apparent determination to
line up with the Atlantic powers,
despite Russian pressure.
Norway and several other states
will :Loon bo invited to join negotia
tions lor r. North Atlantic security
treaty, the Department disclosed.
The American government's posi
tion was made known officially about
the same time that the Norwegian
government was politely but firmly
turning aside a Russian note object
ing to tha pact. This note was evi
dently designed to discourage Nor
way trom joining in the agreement.
Norway Firm
The reply released in Oslo tonight
| showed that the Norwegian govern
ment, despite the fact that Russia
is a neighbor with a common border.
: had taken a firm stand on two points:
1. The Russians were advised—as
the neutrality-minded Swedish gov
ernment had previously been told
last weekend—that Norway was con
: sidering the possibility of lining up
with the Atlantic powers. In the ab
sence of an invitation to the talks
here, this appeared to be about as
far as the Oslo government could
properly go at the moment.
2. The Russians were also advised
that Norway had no intention of
I granting bases to foreign powers un
i less under attack or the threat of
an attack. Authoi ities here did not
appear oil hand to regard this as a
: crippling reservation although the
establishment of bases obviously will
be an important part of the projected
security system.
Meeting Planned
Other informants said it is ex
' pected that Secretary of State Ache
' son will meet soon, possibly this
! week, with the ambassadors of Can
ada, Britain, France, Belgium, The
j Netherlands and Luxembourg to dis
; cuss the treaty project.
; The belief is that then the group
will take up the question of invit
ing other nations to join. Bids are
expected to go out to Norway, Ice
land. Ireland, Portugal, Italy and
i probably Denmark.
In Washington, the treaty draft has
not been completely worked out but
it has been agreed that each of the
member countries will be committed
to provide appropriate assistance,
i possibly military, in case any one of
the countries is attacked.
