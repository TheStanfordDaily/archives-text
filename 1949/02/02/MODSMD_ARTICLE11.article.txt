# China's Acting President Tries For Peace Conflab
## 
### 
NANKING, Teh. 1 </P>. â€” Acting |
President Li Tsung-jen today told
China's Communists in effect to quit
raising new demands and begin
peace talks.
Li struggled with the task of try
ing to arrange a nation-wide settle- j
ment while apparently approving |
attempts at separate peace deals for j
Nanking, Shanghai, and Hankow.
The Reds were reported putting
the pressure on Hankow, huge Cen
tral Government base more than ;
300 miles southwest of Nanking, j
Brief reports reaching Nanking |
said at least 120,000 Red troops from

| the Central China command were
massing north of Hankow. Some
were said to be already moving to
ward that big Yangtze River city.
Li is almost alone in this capital,
which is deserted of nearly all of
j ficials. But he appeared to be win
ning a fight to persuade some of
| them to return and help the peace
| negotiations along.
A source close to Li said the act
ing President had induced Premier
I Sun Fo and various cabinet minis
; ters now in Shanghai to return. The
Reds have been suspicious of all
I government peace offers as !ono, iis
i officials were retreating to Canton
j and elsewhere.
The informant said Li had given
I up plans to go to Canton Saturday,
| the day the new capital is to begin
functioning in that South China
! city. Instead he will stay here and
work for peace.
