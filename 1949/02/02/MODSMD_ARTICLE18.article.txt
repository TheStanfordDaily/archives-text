"The greatest thing since indoor
plumbing," says John Motheral,
producer of KSU's "Ruff 'n' Ready"
show. "The infernal show has been
running four quarters now, and we
still haven't found a new joke. But
we're the best and funniest thing
on campus this side of the time
schedule."
Since its origin last spring "Ruff
n' Ready" has featured almost any
thing that popped into the writers'
minds. These ideas, incidentally,
were frequently the result of the
atmosphere in one of the saloons
down the highway.
But this quarter's shows are
parodies of campus groups and in
stitutions. Future shows will in
clude take-offs on The Daily, Chap-
Die, Excom, Stanford Players, and
sponsors Congdon and Crome. Bob
Simons, former Chappie editor,
was a guest on a previous show of
this sort. He had just one line
which turned out (typically Chap
pie), "Jesu? Christ. Yes!"
Campus Characters
Stock characters with occasional
guests now replace the guest pre
eminence of earlier shows. Dave
Quinn is Warren G. Wonka, the
What's wrong with him? He goes
plus," glad-hand fraternity man.
Mary Baker, who also writes
arge portions of the script, plays
Gladys Mixmaster. Gladys is a
member of Women's Council, Rally
Com, sells Quad subscriptions,
vorks on The Daily, waves a pom
.jom at all the games, knows Marty
Feldman, never smokes on Quad,
;.nd has a friend who knows a Deke.
Dawn Movin, the Marie Wilson
"â€žype of girl, is played by Jo Ann
Tuttle. She is a stupid babe who
has a faculty for getting men and
reads "Peter Rabbit" to learn how
to multiply.
John Motheral, producer of the
show, among other things plays the
oart of the Village Idiot who thinks
"lo be 01 not to be" comes from the

Time Schedule. Motheral has also
been known to carry on a rapid
five-minute dialogue playing both
parts himself.
Tearing of Hair
But one of the niost unusual slip
ups was when two participants of
opposite sexes got their lines mixed
up in a love scene . . . and didn't
know the difference till they'd fin
ished two pages of script.
"Ruff 'n' Ready, presented ev
ery Wednesday at 10 p.m. over
KSU. is produced by John Motheral
and directed by Jinni Law. Writers

al, Dave Quinn, Molly Smith, John
