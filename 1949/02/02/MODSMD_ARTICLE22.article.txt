# Federal Scholarships
## 
### 
Less than a week ago the budgets and proposed spending for
the University of California were released. The figures were
rather large, including something like 57 million dollars for build
ing and expansion, and an estimated cost per student of $975.
Like the budgets of other universities, there seemed to be a pro
vision for everything, new buildings, larger staffs, modern lab
oratories—everything except one essential: some provisions for
persons with every aptitude for college work except the eco
nomic.
There seems to be no future in the constantly increasing cost
of higher education unless more effort is made to get the right
people into school, to equalize opportunity by a soundly con
ceived federal scholarship program.
Federal aid to education is not new and is based on sound
precedent. But in the past, federal aid has been confined to grants
of land, money, tax-exemptions, and so on. We think federal help
should now be expanded to include scholarships aid to worthy
young people who desire to continue their education.
Higher education in America theoretically is for everyone;
everyone who can afford it. And in the larger towns a great
number of persons from low-income homes obtain their degree.
But at the same time larger numbers of eminently-qualified
young men and women are prevented from going to college be
cause they do not live near college and cannot afford to move
3way from home to continue their education.
We have reached that stage of civilization where the im
portance of the nation's investment in education is no longer be
littled. Quoting from the President's Commission on Higher
Education:
"Higher education is an investment, not a cost. It is an invest
ment in free men. It is an investment in social welfare, better
living standards, better health and less crime. It is an investment
:n higher production, increased income, and greater efficiency in
agriculture, industry, and government. It is an investment in a
bulwark against garbled information, half-truths, and untruths,
against ignorance and intolerance. It is an investment in human
talent, better human relations, democracy, and peace."
And it has become increasingly clear that as our national
economy grows more complex, and as the United States assumes
a greater position of leadership and responsibility in international
affairs, higher education must be made available to every young
American who is able to profit from it.
As a means of expanding educational opportunity for all able
young people, by overcoming the influence of economic barriers,
the President's Commission supported a substantial plan of fed
eral scholarships. These scholarships would become available in
.arger amounts each succeeding year, as the number of veterans
subsidized under the GI bill of rights Act and Public Law No. 16
decreased. The Commission proposed that these scholarships be
granted to students primarily on the basis of financial need and
that they would also depend upon the applicants' "Ability, char
acter, and sense of responsibility." It also recommended that the
maximum scholarship be set at $800 a year. The Commission
further recommended that scholarships be provided for at least
20 per cent of the total undergraduate nonveteran student enroll
ment. This program would be initiated in 1948-49, with an ap
propriation of $120,000,000 to provide scholarships for approxi
mately 300,000 students.
Federal expenditures for the last fiscal year in connection with
post-high school education were $1,772,000,000. In comparison,
:he figures for the proposed scholarship plan do not seem radical
ly high. Certainly a small percentage of the expenditures on
education should be for the purpose of insuring that every Amer
ican youth has the opportunity to receive the highest level of
education by which he can profit.

ing and expansion, and an estimated cost per student of $975.
Like the budgets of other universities, there seemed to be a pro
vision for everything, new buildings, larger staffs, modern lab
oratories—everything except one essential: some provisions for
persons with every aptitude for college work except the eco
nomic.
There seems to be no future in the constantly increasing cost
of higher education unless more effort is made to get the right
people into school, to equalize opportunity by a soundly con
ceived federal scholarship program.
Federal aid to education is not new and is based on sound
precedent. But in the past, federal aid has been confined to grants
of land, money, tax-exemptions, and so on. We think federal help
should now be expanded to include scholarships aid to worthy
young people who desire to continue their education.
Higher education in America theoretically is for everyone;
everyone who can afford it. And in the larger towns a great
number of persons from low-income homes obtain their degree.
But at the same time larger numbers of eminently-qualified
young men and women are prevented from going to college be
cause they do not live near college and cannot afford to move
3way from home to continue their education.
We have reached that stage of civilization where the im
portance of the nation's investment in education is no longer be
littled. Quoting from the President's Commission on Higher
Education:
"Higher education is an investment, not a cost. It is an invest
ment in free men. It is an investment in social welfare, better
living standards, better health and less crime. It is an investment
:n higher production, increased income, and greater efficiency in
agriculture, industry, and government. It is an investment in a
bulwark against garbled information, half-truths, and untruths,
against ignorance and intolerance. It is an investment in human
talent, better human relations, democracy, and peace."
And it has become increasingly clear that as our national
economy grows more complex, and as the United States assumes
a greater position of leadership and responsibility in international
affairs, higher education must be made available to every young
American who is able to profit from it.
As a means of expanding educational opportunity for all able
young people, by overcoming the influence of economic barriers,
the President's Commission supported a substantial plan of fed
eral scholarships. These scholarships would become available in
.arger amounts each succeeding year, as the number of veterans
subsidized under the GI bill of rights Act and Public Law No. 16
decreased. The Commission proposed that these scholarships be
granted to students primarily on the basis of financial need and
that they would also depend upon the applicants' "Ability, char
acter, and sense of responsibility." It also recommended that the
maximum scholarship be set at $800 a year. The Commission
further recommended that scholarships be provided for at least
20 per cent of the total undergraduate nonveteran student enroll
ment. This program would be initiated in 1948-49, with an ap
propriation of $120,000,000 to provide scholarships for approxi
mately 300,000 students.
Federal expenditures for the last fiscal year in connection with
post-high school education were $1,772,000,000. In comparison,
:he figures for the proposed scholarship plan do not seem radical
ly high. Certainly a small percentage of the expenditures on
education should be for the purpose of insuring that every Amer
ican youth has the opportunity to receive the highest level of
education by which he can profit.
Less than a week ago the budgets and proposed spending for
the University of California were released. The figures were
rather large, including something like 57 million dollars for build
ing and expansion, and an estimated cost per student of $975.
