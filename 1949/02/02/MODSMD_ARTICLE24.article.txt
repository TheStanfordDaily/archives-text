# Flunking Out? Try Psych 51, Says Writer
## 
### BOB SEDERHOLM 
On past occasions, I have fear
less'y passed out a little advice on
courses. This has gotten me in a
bit of trouble, and as a result sev
eral teachers have rejected me for
their courses. Dy a strange coinci
dence. however, they are all courses
that require a "B" average for ad
mittance.
One of the livelier general courses
offered is Psychology 51, and I rec
ommend it heartily. The course is
interesting in itself; and if it has no
other practical value, you will at
least learn enough technical lan
guage to understand Lew Ayres
when you go to the movies.
The highlight of last quarter's
lecture session came when Dr. Tay
lor was explaining true paranoia. It
seems that true paranoia is rather
difficult to diagnose and a number
of sufferers are walking around
loose. "In fact," blurted Dr. Tay
lor, ''some of them are extremely
sexcessful."
Long after I have forgotten all
else about psychology (presumably
through retroactive inhibition), I
will no doubt vivid'y remember the
following paragraph from Ruch's
text. The New Yorker would prob
ably label it, "Onward and Up
ward with Psychotherapy, Clumsy
Plumber Division":
'The withdrawn patient is fre
quently helped by some occupation
in which the unexpected is always
happening. A good many years ago
it was noticed (hat one such patient,
assigned as helper to a clumsy
plumber, was shocked out of his
withdrawn state when a pipe broke
and he was drenched with cold wa
ter."
Gee, think what an awkward
electrician could do.
