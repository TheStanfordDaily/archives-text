# "EXPERT" SAYS:
## 'You Just Can't Win

WASHINGTON. Jan. 29 </P)._
Your wile cashes in on a horse be
cause she likes the color ot the
jockey s jacket. You collect non
negotiable tickets because you fol
low breeding lines.
Ever wonder why?
A man who has been studying
gambling for 15 years says he's
found out its because "you just
can't win."
Feeding slugs into his own slot
machine, Dr. Ernest E. Blanche
said:
"It's mine and it's honest, but it
pays me only 70 per cent."
Dr. Blanche, a 36-year-old math
ematician, once wanted to be a
physician. Instead, ho has been di
agnosing the probabilities of gam
bling success.
He aims his preaching against
gambling from the practical rather
than the moral viewpoint.
"People don't want to be told they
can't win," he says. "My theory is
that they'll always lose if they stay
at it. The ones who can't be con
vinced are the ones I'm trying to
reach."
Some of his conclusions:
You've got one chance in 17 of
making four straight passes with
the dice, shooting for seven, 11, or
your point.
If its eight straight winning
throws, the chances are one in 287.
It its 10. you have one chance in
1,181 unless the dice are crooked.
From the mathematical stand
piont, he says he has tried all the
angles — from roulette to hunting
the red-centered piece of candy that
would entitle him to a free pepper
mint stick.
His own home is a cache of gam
bling equipment — all experimental
and some of it phoney. He says he
has been kicked out of some places
merely for taking notes.
Besides being a Doctor of Philos
ophy, Dr. Blanche is chief statisti
cian in the logistics division, Army
General Staff, and a former news
paper reporter in Passaic, N.J.
Hasn t he ever found a winning
system?
Says the doctor: "Don't think 1
wouldn't have used it if I had."
