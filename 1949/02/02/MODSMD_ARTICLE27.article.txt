I wondered about school in the first grade. I didn't think the idea
would ever become popular. I personally didn't ever think much of it.
I couldn't read or write and they wouldn't let me talk. I didn't see much
sense in it.
Hal Boyle, another columnist, says that if he had a child he'd want
him to go to n school which doesn't exist. He says it is the school he
wishes he could have gone to when he was a child.
To begin with, he would have one teacher for every five or ten pupils.
And the goal of the school would be to educate the heart, head and hand
so as to prepare the student to live a happy life with his fellow men.
One of his incidental points brought out was that from kindergarten
on they would be taught that the finest career possible is matrimony.
Anyhow, he thinks there would be no skipping his school. He thinks
the kids would like it. But he is prepared just in case they don't. He'd
send truants to the basement to practice •"Flight of the Bumblebee" on
the tuba.
It seems that nowadays this progressive education is gaining in popu
larity. In Oakley, Idaho, a teacher took her pupils on a field trip to dem
onstrate, progressively, the pitfalls of gambling. She put a dime in a
slot machine—anil hit the jackpot. A truly great thing, this progressive
education .... sort of like the old adage: Early to bed, and early to rise,
and you'll make enough money to do otherwise.
There is just no end to this Yankee ingenuity. Progressive education is
a boon to six student veterans at an unnamed school on the Pacific
coast. They pooled resources and bought a wire recorder. Now they are
charging fellow students 50 cents to hear the play-backs of prof's lectures.
Mrs. Martha M. Mavormat in Savannah, Ga„ aims to put her high
school civics class into a practical proving grounds, the home. She made
it an assignment for each student to be charming at breakfast, offer to do
any chores around the house, and to pay their mothers a compliment. Re
sults at one household was a dose of castor oil, because the mother thought
the child "was coming down with fever." What's this about "do unto
others"?
Th ree hundred twenty-eight men and women are going to school in
neighborhood colleges in Louisville, Ky. It's the latest thing in the field of
education. Woodrow Strickler, director of the University of Louisville's
division of adult education, states it is a way to lake "culture to the
people." s
Classes are held in two branches of the city library, conducted by some
of the top teachers of the University faculty. It's all free, except to those
who want college credit. Most people seem to want only to "stimulate
their mentality," though.
At least in a setup like that you wouldn't have to worry about going
minus. Right now I d like it. This subject that I'm carrying isn't really too
much lor me. Its the four that I m dragging that are wearing me down. I
guess it's really true that college is just like a laundry—you get out of it
just what you put into it. But you d never recognize it sometimes!
The weeks are passing—l should be glad. The weeks are passing, but I
am sad. The weeks are passing, sad my lot. The weeks are passing, but I
am not!
The University of Minnesota didn t only go progressive this past summer,
they went revolutionary. They let the students grade the instructors to see
which were considered to have the greatest teaching ability. Imagine a
pupil going up to his history prof and saying, "If you flunk me I'll flunk
you." Do unto others .... you know.
Education may be very different in the years to come. A plan now being
used at Kiski preparatory school in Pennsylvania gives students a single
course for six hours a day for nine weeks. They they go on to the next
subject. This plan is said to eliminate much of the homework and to make
it almost impossible for a student to fall behind in his work. Even Stan
ford could import athletes with a setup like that.
But all I can say for this progressive education is that if this guy Ex
perience is the best teacher, why isn't he on the faculty?
