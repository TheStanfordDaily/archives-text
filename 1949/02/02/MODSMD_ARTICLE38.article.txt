# Promising Farm Baseballers Start Long Season Saturday
## 
### HILL SWIGART 
With prospccts the brightest in
i years, Stanford's men of baseball
open their lengthy season of base
hits, foul tips, and double plays Sat
urday afternoon with a nonconfer
! ence game at the Sunken Diamond.
Harry Wolter's star-laden ball club
| swings into action with a nine-inning
tussel with the MofTat fylantecas, one
of the better San Francisco semi
pro outfits. Coach Wolter, now in his
26th and final year at Stanford will
throw out the first ball promptly at
2:30.
A Heavy Hitting Squad
The veteran Indian squad, with
heavy power at the plate and speed
to burn, looks like a good pre-season
bet for CIBA honors this year. Ten
lettermen return from last spring's
1 squad, and with such promising
transfers as Jim Castagnoli, Ken
Rose, and Bud Kline coming up, the
1949 Cards have the basis for a real
I fence busting outfit.
I Veteran third sacker Captain Bill
Arce holds almost a closed corpora
tion around the hot corner but aside
from this spot Coach Harry Wolter is
having a tough time settling on a
i starting lineup.
j Lettermen hurlers Dave Dahle,
I Frank LaBrum, and Dave Stott re
turn to form the nucleus of a tal-
I ented mound corps. The semi-pro

Mantecas will probably get a look
at Dahle's portside slants Saturday.
McGraw and Castagnoli
Squatting behind the plate this
year will be letterman Frank Mc-
Graw and transfer Jim Castagnoli.
Both are able receivers with Castag
noli slightly the better wood man.
Consistent Charlie Cole, the
squads leading batter last year, will
again be the custodian of first base.
But he is getting plenty of competi
tion from hard hitting Ken Rose;
and should Rose prove his worth
around the initial sack Cole may
move to the outfield.
This year's keystone combination
centers around shortstop Dave Mel
ton and second sacker Ray Winter
halter. However footballer Bud
Kline may move in at either spot
before the season is far along.
The outfield again looks'strong
with Blasting Bob Nava, Clyde Ding
felder, an J Jim Claypool returning.
LSF OYER ST. MARY'S
Paced by giant Don Lofgran's 16
points, the University of San Fran
cisco scored an expected 47-38 tri
umph over St. Mary's last night.
USF enjoyed a 21-15 half-time
lead and at one point led 46 to 30.
Center Joe McNamee, the other of
SF's "twin peaks," tanked 14 points
for second high Don scoring honors.
Guard Augie Bullwinkle led the
'osers with 11 digits.
