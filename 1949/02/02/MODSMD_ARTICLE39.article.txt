Elsewhere on these pages the results of the Associated Press basketball
poll is printed and .... Stanford is ninth in the nation. Thus ends the
weary vigil that started the moment after the Cards beat Pitt last Saturday
night. "Where will we rank now?" questioned loyal Stanfords. "Gee, we
must have gone up a way on the poll." etc.
This reporter is as rabid an Indian cage fan as there is, but my faith in
polls ended abruptly in the wee small hours of November 3, last year.
I must admit that my confidence in such devices as polls, public opinion
as well as sports writers, was somewhat shaken in the months of October
; nd November when the writers backed the California football team to the
point of voting them fourth place in the top teams of the nation.
With the end of football season most sport fans thought the poll would be
forgotten until that spoi l was resumed next Fall. Then came the reversal
of the predictions of such as Roper and Gallup when Truman won the race
foi president. Most of us thought the pollsters would lie low for a re
spectable length of time anyway.
But up comes the AP with a poll of the nation's basketball teams.
Writers from all over the country send in their votes on Sunday morning.
Students and followers of the schools that stand a chance of making the
charmed "top ten" circle then start the wait for the Monday afternoon or
Tuesday morning papers to see just how their school rates.
Two weeks ago the USF team was rated sixth in the nation, largely oft
their showing on their eastern trip. Today they are tenth. Stanford beat
them and they started their drop. They had ninth place and 146 votes last
week (after Stanford had beaten them). This week, although they won
one game and lost none, they have dropped to tenth place and have only
92 votes. Non Seqitur, as our English teachers say.
Cards Beat SJS, Pitt, and Move Up Two Places
The Dons, after losing to Stanford by 10 points, still rated two positions
above the Cards (last week). This week, Stanford is one place above the
Dons, though the Cards squeaked through to a one point win over San
Jose (who probably didn't rate in the top 30 teams of the nation), and
beat, as did everybody else, Pitt.
Let me stop right here and go on record again as saying that the Stan
ford basketball team ranks among the very best in the nation. This article
is not intended to run down our team in any way. I only wish to point out
the nonsense of the AP poll.
On a given night Stanford could'give any of the eight teams now rated
over them a very good battle and probably win more than they would
lose. But by the same theory, many of the teams now ranked below the
Cards could give them a good battle, and some of them might well win.
Stanford has nine games remaining on the schedule. One is with CCNY
on Saturday and the others are with the other three Southern Division
teams of the PCC—three with UCLA and USC, and two with California.
Two of these teams have beaten Stanford. CCNY has a 11 and 2 record
against some tough teams. California must be improving by leaps and
bounds to run up 54 points against a team such as the Oakland Bittners
1 as they did Saturday.
The Cards are tied with USC for the lead in the Southern Division as of
this date. Next week's games in the Southland may prove all important as
far as post-season games are concerned. Our fine record against outside
' opponents will mean nothing when it comes to choosing the team to enter
the playoffs for the Conference title.
Stanford Spirit Known in East
According to an issue of the Harvard Crimson received here, the Crim
! sons are expecting a royal welcome when they come to the Farm to p';t;
Stanford in football in September next.
The Easterners ran a story on a story published in The Daily concerning
a plan put forth by Stanford yell leader Tom Elke. Elke came up with the
idea of dressing a section of the student body in "top hats, tails, and vvhite
ties."
The Crimson picked up the story and commented that Harvard will "run
into a hotbed of organized spirit unknown in the Ivy League."
I quote further:
"Such stunts may seem far-fetched to local (Harvard) spectatorin !

monster bonfires, float parades, and all the freshman men ueari ig

What pricc fame?
