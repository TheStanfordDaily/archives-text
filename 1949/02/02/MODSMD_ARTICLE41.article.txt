# Card Record Impressive Despite Lack of Support
## Rally Com Cited For Farm Silence 
### JOHN HALL 
For a ballclub that has nut to
gether an impressive record of 17
trumphs in 19 contests, Stanford's
varsity hoopsters haven't been able
to raise so much as a peep out of
the student body.
Having beaten last year's Big
Nine champ, Michigan; having
made a clean sweep of Bay Area
competition by downing St. Mary's,
USF, Santa Clara, and California;
having jumped into an early lead in
the Southern Division; and having
piled up the best record of any In
dian team since the 1942 National
Champs, you would expect a slight
cheer from the sidelines.
But as yet, the Deanmen have not
been honored by one of those fiery
yelling sessions, sometimes referred
to as a rally. All has been silence
on the Farm.
Chances Dime A Dozen
Maybe the cagers can get along
without the noise. The way they
have been improving their record
each week, indicates they can. But
it would seem that Stanford's es
teemed Rally Committee would take
pleasure in planning an organized
pat on the back for their lovable
representatives.
The chances for red hot rally ma
terial have been a dime a dozen so
far this season. It would have been
a perfect time for the clap-clap
routine when the melonmen opened
the Southern Division season in the
Pavilion several weeks ago. That
game marked the first time since
1943 that Stanford had opened the
season at home.
Did Their Work in Silence
Another likely spot for a good old
fashioned cheer occurred when
USF's Hilltoppers, at that time 6th
in the national ranking, invaded the
Pavilion. For Stanford, it was the
biggest game of the season. The
Cards had to beat USF to gain na
tional recognition. A yell or two
would have helped, but the cagers
did their work in silence ... at that,
besting the Dons by 10 points, 65 to
55.
But the Cards accomplished all
these things. They opened the sea
son successfully against UCLA. 61
to 52. They junked San Francisco's
Dons to become the top team on the
Pacific Coast, and they overcame
the Berkeley jinx to win two straight
from the Bears and bounce into the
Southern Division lead with USC.
Maybe Some Day
Still no rallies. And now with
CCNY coming to town, the varsrity
will be pressing to rack up a victory
that would raise them possibly two
more notches in the national rating.
All of which is another opportunity
for Rally Comm to muff the play.
Maybe, one day again we will have
a basketball rally here on the Farm.
