## Cockiest, Toughest Coach In The Business-- Meet "Mr. Basketball", Nat Holman of CCNY 
### AL BERRY 
The game of basketball came into
being in the year 1891. Five years
later, in New York's lower East
Side, a son—named Nat—was born
to a large-family-minded grocer.
Herein begins a success story.
For today, 52 years later, those
three—basketball, New York, and
Nat Holman—have bundled them
selves into a unity that will be
talked about as long as men con
tinue shooting at the immobile but
elusive netted hoop.
This year, that same Nat Holman
is completing his thirtieth year of
coaching basketball at the City Col
lege of New York, an institution,
ineir entally, that does not have a
reputation for losing basketball
cames. In the past three decades
Holman has gained many things—a
record of nearly 75 per cent wins,
an overwhelming, but seldom mis
placed ego, and the whole-hearted
support and respect of the cagers,
students, and faculty of a pretty fair
country school—CCNY.
350 Victories for Nat
Since Nat took over the cage
bossing duties at City in 1919. the
Beavers have won over 350 games
to 'ess than 125 lost. On top of that,
the record hook shows that half
of Holman's 30 seasons have been
marred by only three losses or less
—and it has usually been less.
In the last three-tenths of a cen
tury CCNY has become one of the
strongest powers in the national
basketball setup. About the only
honor a Holman team has failed to
>ain is an undefeated season. They
"ame closest to this in the three
years 1932 to 193*1, when the New
Yorkers lost but one game per sea
son—43 wins out of 4G games.
That is just about "Bingo!" in
•anybody's sports book.
Anderson One. oi Greatest
One of the greatest tributes to
Nai Holman's coaching concerns the
"orn-.or City star, "Stretch'' Ander
son. In his junior year at City, An
derson was a gangly six-three-er
who had neither inteiest nor expe
rience in any athletics. He had
never played basketball in his life,
and had none through his freshman
and sophomore years at CCNY
without so much as seeing a bas
ketball game.
Nat took an in!e;est in Anderson,
ignored his arguments, and issued
him a suit. Anderson got. in a few
games his junior year. The rest is
history.
"Stretch" Anderson became, in
his senior vear, one of the groate:t

| centers in Beaver history. That
l reason the New Yorkers won 12
frames to one lost, and defeated
Princeton, the Ivy League champ,
! twice. Stretch graduated with four
top professional clubs tossing lush
j offers at him.
Horatio Alger Himself
For those who like a success
story, Holman is it. Born as "mid
d'e man" in a family of seven boys
and three girls, Holman spent his
youth in Lower East Side New York
helping his father run the grocery
store. In high school (a long, long
time ago), he found a little time for
athletics — he made all - league in:
(1) soccer, (2) football, (3) basket
ball, and (4) baseball.
Upon graduation, Holman turned
down a pro baseball contract and
enrolled in the Savage School of
Physical Education. He got his de
gree there and then it was 1917 and
a small war. Holman didn't miss
that either.
With His USN discharge in one
| hand and a spherical called a bas
ketball in the other, Nat Holman
; took what proved to be a perma
nent job at a one-watt school called
the City College of New York.
The next ten years were to be
the busiest in Holman's 'ife, for in
addition to being CCNY's "boy
wonder," Nat was at the same time
earning another reputation in pro
fessional ball as "the world's great
est basketball player."
IK" soon became the star of the
original New York Celtics, a club
that is still called "the greatest bas
ketball team of all time."
Nothing; to It
Cne of the best stories of Nat's
pro days took place when the Celts
were playing in a small town
a local team that was "up"
j for them, and determined for an
I'rsct. The hometown crowd was
slightly on the partisan side; and
i when a foul was called against the
| locals, the crowd set up a roar that
would do the Berkeleyites proud.
Nat went up to the free throw
line to take the shot but the noise
and the catcalls made him pause.
Then he took his position, put a
sneer on his face, and turned his
\ head away from the basket and
stared at the crowd coldly. Still
looking at the stands, he shot the
ball and scored.
After the disbanding of the Celts.
Nat found that he had plenty to
i keep himself occupied in just keep
ing the Beavers in the winning col
umn. He has done this by hard

work and confidence in himself. A
player who flubbed one of his first
principles once heard him shout:
"Why can't you do it right? You
have Holman to teach you. You
should thank your lucky stars! I
never had a Holman to teach me."
'Mr. Basketball'
Yep, Nat Holman has a great
fondness for himself —or rather he
has supreme confidence in his own
capabilities. But it is even a greater
insight to the inan to note that
CCNY loves him more than he does
himself. Thirty years of cheers-and
support have proved that.
He was also given an honorary
degree from City, which should be
some sort of proof that the really
great can become heroes in their
own home towns. Nationally. Hol
man rates tops also. It wasn't too
long ago that he was elected presi
dent of the National Association of
of Basketball Coaches. Top this off
with more national acclaim than
most U.S. Presidents have gained,
and you have some sort of picture
of the man who takes his team
[against the Big Red Machne Fii
day night.
So The Daily tips its red beanie to
! a great coach, with a great record,
and -we hope after Friday night—a
great future: Nat Holman, 'Mr.
3asketball."

sneer on his face, and turned his
\ head away from the basket and
stared at the crowd coldly. Still
looking at the stands, he shot the
ball and scored.
After the disbanding of the Celts.
Nat found that he had plenty to
i keep himself occupied in just keep
ing the Beavers in the winning col
umn. He has done this by hard

work and confidence in himself. A
player who flubbed one of his first
principles once heard him shout:
"Why can't you do it right? You
have Holman to teach you. You
should thank your lucky stars! I
never had a Holman to teach me."
'Mr. Basketball'
Yep, Nat Holman has a great
fondness for himself —or rather he
has supreme confidence in his own
capabilities. But it is even a greater
insight to the inan to note that
CCNY loves him more than he does
himself. Thirty years of cheers-and
support have proved that.
He was also given an honorary
degree from City, which should be
some sort of proof that the really
great can become heroes in their
own home towns. Nationally. Hol
man rates tops also. It wasn't too
long ago that he was elected presi
dent of the National Association of
of Basketball Coaches. Top this off
with more national acclaim than
most U.S. Presidents have gained,
and you have some sort of picture
of the man who takes his team
[against the Big Red Machne Fii
day night.
So The Daily tips its red beanie to
! a great coach, with a great record,
and -we hope after Friday night—a
great future: Nat Holman, 'Mr.
3asketball."


CO-CAPTAINS SONNY JAMESON (center) and Hilty Shapiro (right) give Coach Nat Holman a basket
hall complete with candles on his 30th birthday as head basketball coach at the City College of New York.
The rest of the CCNY squad looks on.
The game of basketball came into
being in the year 1891. Five years
later, in New York's lower East
Side, a son—named Nat—was born
to a large-family-minded grocer.
Herein begins a success story.
For today, 52 years later, those
three—basketball, New York, and
Nat Holman—have bundled them
selves into a unity that will be
talked about as long as men con
tinue shooting at the immobile but
elusive netted hoop.
This year, that same Nat Holman
is completing his thirtieth year of
coaching basketball at the City Col
lege of New York, an institution,
ineir entally, that does not have a
reputation for losing basketball
cames. In the past three decades
Holman has gained many things—a
record of nearly 75 per cent wins,
an overwhelming, but seldom mis
placed ego, and the whole-hearted
support and respect of the cagers,
students, and faculty of a pretty fair
country school—CCNY.
350 Victories for Nat
Since Nat took over the cage
bossing duties at City in 1919. the
Beavers have won over 350 games
to 'ess than 125 lost. On top of that,
the record hook shows that half
of Holman's 30 seasons have been
marred by only three losses or less
—and it has usually been less.
In the last three-tenths of a cen
tury CCNY has become one of the
strongest powers in the national
basketball setup. About the only
honor a Holman team has failed to
>ain is an undefeated season. They
"ame closest to this in the three
years 1932 to 193*1, when the New
Yorkers lost but one game per sea
son—43 wins out of 4G games.
That is just about "Bingo!" in
•anybody's sports book.
Anderson One. oi Greatest
One of the greatest tributes to
Nai Holman's coaching concerns the
"orn-.or City star, "Stretch'' Ander
son. In his junior year at City, An
derson was a gangly six-three-er
who had neither inteiest nor expe
rience in any athletics. He had
never played basketball in his life,
and had none through his freshman
and sophomore years at CCNY
without so much as seeing a bas
ketball game.
Nat took an in!e;est in Anderson,
ignored his arguments, and issued
him a suit. Anderson got. in a few
games his junior year. The rest is
history.
"Stretch" Anderson became, in
his senior vear, one of the groate:t

| centers in Beaver history. That
l reason the New Yorkers won 12
frames to one lost, and defeated
Princeton, the Ivy League champ,
! twice. Stretch graduated with four
top professional clubs tossing lush
j offers at him.
Horatio Alger Himself
For those who like a success
story, Holman is it. Born as "mid
d'e man" in a family of seven boys
and three girls, Holman spent his
youth in Lower East Side New York
helping his father run the grocery
store. In high school (a long, long
time ago), he found a little time for
athletics — he made all - league in:
(1) soccer, (2) football, (3) basket
ball, and (4) baseball.
Upon graduation, Holman turned
down a pro baseball contract and
enrolled in the Savage School of
Physical Education. He got his de
gree there and then it was 1917 and
a small war. Holman didn't miss
that either.
With His USN discharge in one
| hand and a spherical called a bas
ketball in the other, Nat Holman
; took what proved to be a perma
nent job at a one-watt school called
the City College of New York.
The next ten years were to be
the busiest in Holman's 'ife, for in
addition to being CCNY's "boy
wonder," Nat was at the same time
earning another reputation in pro
fessional ball as "the world's great
est basketball player."
IK" soon became the star of the
original New York Celtics, a club
that is still called "the greatest bas
ketball team of all time."
Nothing; to It
Cne of the best stories of Nat's
pro days took place when the Celts
were playing in a small town
a local team that was "up"
j for them, and determined for an
I'rsct. The hometown crowd was
slightly on the partisan side; and
i when a foul was called against the
| locals, the crowd set up a roar that
would do the Berkeleyites proud.
Nat went up to the free throw
line to take the shot but the noise
and the catcalls made him pause.
Then he took his position, put a
sneer on his face, and turned his
\ head away from the basket and
stared at the crowd coldly. Still
looking at the stands, he shot the
ball and scored.

d'e man" in a family of seven boys
and three girls, Holman spent his
youth in Lower East Side New York
helping his father run the grocery
store. In high school (a long, long
time ago), he found a little time for
athletics — he made all - league in:
(1) soccer, (2) football, (3) basket
ball, and (4) baseball.
Upon graduation, Holman turned
down a pro baseball contract and
enrolled in the Savage School of
Physical Education. He got his de
gree there and then it was 1917 and
a small war. Holman didn't miss
that either.
With His USN discharge in one
| hand and a spherical called a bas
ketball in the other, Nat Holman
; took what proved to be a perma
nent job at a one-watt school called
the City College of New York.
The next ten years were to be
the busiest in Holman's 'ife, for in
addition to being CCNY's "boy
wonder," Nat was at the same time
earning another reputation in pro
fessional ball as "the world's great
est basketball player."
IK" soon became the star of the
original New York Celtics, a club
that is still called "the greatest bas
ketball team of all time."
Nothing; to It
Cne of the best stories of Nat's
pro days took place when the Celts
were playing in a small town
a local team that was "up"
j for them, and determined for an
I'rsct. The hometown crowd was
slightly on the partisan side; and
i when a foul was called against the
| locals, the crowd set up a roar that
would do the Berkeleyites proud.
Nat went up to the free throw
line to take the shot but the noise
and the catcalls made him pause.
Then he took his position, put a
sneer on his face, and turned his
\ head away from the basket and
stared at the crowd coldly. Still
looking at the stands, he shot the
ball and scored.
After the disbanding of the Celts.
Nat found that he had plenty to
i keep himself occupied in just keep
ing the Beavers in the winning col
umn. He has done this by hard

work and confidence in himself. A
player who flubbed one of his first
principles once heard him shout:
"Why can't you do it right? You
have Holman to teach you. You
should thank your lucky stars! I
never had a Holman to teach me."
'Mr. Basketball'
Yep, Nat Holman has a great
fondness for himself —or rather he
has supreme confidence in his own
capabilities. But it is even a greater
insight to the inan to note that
CCNY loves him more than he does
himself. Thirty years of cheers-and
support have proved that.
He was also given an honorary
degree from City, which should be
some sort of proof that the really
great can become heroes in their
own home towns. Nationally. Hol
man rates tops also. It wasn't too
long ago that he was elected presi
dent of the National Association of
of Basketball Coaches. Top this off
with more national acclaim than
most U.S. Presidents have gained,
and you have some sort of picture
of the man who takes his team
[against the Big Red Machne Fii
day night.
So The Daily tips its red beanie to
! a great coach, with a great record,
and -we hope after Friday night—a
great future: Nat Holman, 'Mr.
3asketball."


CO-CAPTAINS SONNY JAMESON (center) and Hilty Shapiro (right) give Coach Nat Holman a basket
hall complete with candles on his 30th birthday as head basketball coach at the City College of New York.
The rest of the CCNY squad looks on.
The game of basketball came into
being in the year 1891. Five years
later, in New York's lower East
Side, a son—named Nat—was born
to a large-family-minded grocer.
Herein begins a success story.
For today, 52 years later, those
three—basketball, New York, and
Nat Holman—have bundled them
selves into a unity that will be
talked about as long as men con
tinue shooting at the immobile but
elusive netted hoop.
This year, that same Nat Holman
is completing his thirtieth year of
coaching basketball at the City Col
lege of New York, an institution,
ineir entally, that does not have a
reputation for losing basketball
cames. In the past three decades
Holman has gained many things—a
record of nearly 75 per cent wins,
an overwhelming, but seldom mis
placed ego, and the whole-hearted
support and respect of the cagers,
students, and faculty of a pretty fair
country school—CCNY.
350 Victories for Nat
Since Nat took over the cage
bossing duties at City in 1919. the
Beavers have won over 350 games
to 'ess than 125 lost. On top of that,
the record hook shows that half
of Holman's 30 seasons have been
marred by only three losses or less
—and it has usually been less.
In the last three-tenths of a cen
tury CCNY has become one of the
strongest powers in the national
basketball setup. About the only
honor a Holman team has failed to
>ain is an undefeated season. They
"ame closest to this in the three
years 1932 to 193*1, when the New
Yorkers lost but one game per sea
son—43 wins out of 4G games.
That is just about "Bingo!" in
•anybody's sports book.
Anderson One. oi Greatest
One of the greatest tributes to
Nai Holman's coaching concerns the
"orn-.or City star, "Stretch'' Ander
son. In his junior year at City, An
derson was a gangly six-three-er
who had neither inteiest nor expe
rience in any athletics. He had
never played basketball in his life,
and had none through his freshman
and sophomore years at CCNY
without so much as seeing a bas
ketball game.
Nat took an in!e;est in Anderson,
ignored his arguments, and issued
him a suit. Anderson got. in a few
games his junior year. The rest is
history.
"Stretch" Anderson became, in
his senior vear, one of the groate:t

| centers in Beaver history. That
l reason the New Yorkers won 12
frames to one lost, and defeated
Princeton, the Ivy League champ,
! twice. Stretch graduated with four
top professional clubs tossing lush
j offers at him.

Beavers have won over 350 games
to 'ess than 125 lost. On top of that,
the record hook shows that half
of Holman's 30 seasons have been
marred by only three losses or less
—and it has usually been less.
In the last three-tenths of a cen
tury CCNY has become one of the
strongest powers in the national
basketball setup. About the only
honor a Holman team has failed to
>ain is an undefeated season. They
"ame closest to this in the three
years 1932 to 193*1, when the New
Yorkers lost but one game per sea
son—43 wins out of 4G games.
That is just about "Bingo!" in
•anybody's sports book.
Anderson One. oi Greatest
One of the greatest tributes to
Nai Holman's coaching concerns the
"orn-.or City star, "Stretch'' Ander
son. In his junior year at City, An
derson was a gangly six-three-er
who had neither inteiest nor expe
rience in any athletics. He had
never played basketball in his life,
and had none through his freshman
and sophomore years at CCNY
without so much as seeing a bas
ketball game.
Nat took an in!e;est in Anderson,
ignored his arguments, and issued
him a suit. Anderson got. in a few
games his junior year. The rest is
history.
"Stretch" Anderson became, in
his senior vear, one of the groate:t

| centers in Beaver history. That
l reason the New Yorkers won 12
frames to one lost, and defeated
Princeton, the Ivy League champ,
! twice. Stretch graduated with four
top professional clubs tossing lush
j offers at him.
Horatio Alger Himself
For those who like a success
story, Holman is it. Born as "mid
d'e man" in a family of seven boys
and three girls, Holman spent his
youth in Lower East Side New York
helping his father run the grocery
store. In high school (a long, long
time ago), he found a little time for
athletics — he made all - league in:
(1) soccer, (2) football, (3) basket
ball, and (4) baseball.
Upon graduation, Holman turned
down a pro baseball contract and
enrolled in the Savage School of
Physical Education. He got his de
gree there and then it was 1917 and
a small war. Holman didn't miss
that either.
With His USN discharge in one
| hand and a spherical called a bas
ketball in the other, Nat Holman
; took what proved to be a perma
nent job at a one-watt school called
the City College of New York.
The next ten years were to be
the busiest in Holman's 'ife, for in
addition to being CCNY's "boy
wonder," Nat was at the same time
earning another reputation in pro
fessional ball as "the world's great
est basketball player."
IK" soon became the star of the
original New York Celtics, a club
that is still called "the greatest bas
ketball team of all time."
Nothing; to It
Cne of the best stories of Nat's
pro days took place when the Celts
were playing in a small town
a local team that was "up"
j for them, and determined for an
I'rsct. The hometown crowd was
slightly on the partisan side; and
i when a foul was called against the
| locals, the crowd set up a roar that
would do the Berkeleyites proud.
Nat went up to the free throw
line to take the shot but the noise
and the catcalls made him pause.
Then he took his position, put a
sneer on his face, and turned his
\ head away from the basket and
stared at the crowd coldly. Still
looking at the stands, he shot the
ball and scored.
After the disbanding of the Celts.
Nat found that he had plenty to
i keep himself occupied in just keep
ing the Beavers in the winning col
umn. He has done this by hard

work and confidence in himself. A
player who flubbed one of his first
principles once heard him shout:
"Why can't you do it right? You
have Holman to teach you. You
should thank your lucky stars! I
never had a Holman to teach me."
'Mr. Basketball'
Yep, Nat Holman has a great
fondness for himself —or rather he
has supreme confidence in his own
capabilities. But it is even a greater
insight to the inan to note that
CCNY loves him more than he does
himself. Thirty years of cheers-and
support have proved that.
He was also given an honorary
degree from City, which should be
some sort of proof that the really
great can become heroes in their
own home towns. Nationally. Hol
man rates tops also. It wasn't too
long ago that he was elected presi
dent of the National Association of
of Basketball Coaches. Top this off
with more national acclaim than
most U.S. Presidents have gained,
and you have some sort of picture
of the man who takes his team
[against the Big Red Machne Fii
day night.
So The Daily tips its red beanie to
! a great coach, with a great record,
and -we hope after Friday night—a
great future: Nat Holman, 'Mr.
3asketball."
