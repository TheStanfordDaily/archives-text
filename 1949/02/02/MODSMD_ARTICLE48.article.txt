# Inmates Freeze and Fry In Last "Village Shack"
## 
### TOM WIEDER 
One of the symbols remaining
from even more hectic po&t-war
days is the last tarpaper shack at
the Village. On paper it's listed as
Building 25.'!, but 253's inmates
know it better as the "barracks" or
the "shack."
This quaint dwelling is the last
of four tarpaper shacks used to
handle the huge overflow from the
more inhabitable parts of the Vil
lage. It's the same old story—cold
in winter, hot in summer. In be
tween times it's just plain un
healthy. Building 253 holds about
35 single men: double-decker bunks
are on one side of a wing, desks and
books are on the other. Warm air
from the gas heaters hisses gently
and quietly to the high ceiling and
seeps through the cracks. The cold
air hovers down on the cement
floors. The occupants are often
found huddled over the heaters to
cut off the hot air before it starts
on its way to the great out-of
doors.
Th'.n Walls
Insulation? The boys of 253 have
forgotten what it means. An extra
thick partition of cardboard sepa
rates inside from outside. One of
the more energetic members of 253
pounded his fist gently against the
wa'l one day and the fist went
through without much resistance.
As the wall merely separated a
small separate room where some
members study, a later stunt was
the insertion of a shoulder through
the smaller hole, making a much
larger one. Thereby one of 253's
lew concessions to privacy van
ished.
Rumor had it that 253 was due
to be closed down for good. But
according to the Village Director's
Office, demand and supply have not
been equated to the point where the
Vi'lage can do without Building 253.
It will have to be held open for fu
ture use as students' quarters, a

storehouse, or for the Research In
stitute.
Finances
In order for the Village to break
even financially, dorms must be
filled. There were 1,603 beds avail
able in the Village at the beginning
of fall quarter; by Oct. 15 about 200
of these were empty. Tarpaper
shacks have been closed, one by
one.
According to statistics, those left
in 253 have a lot of consolation, if
they feel they need it. The tar
paper shacks cost more to run than
do the other buildings.
Shacks Expensive
Gas heating piped in by an in
dependent line runs up a neat little
bill, especially since so much heat
merely warms the ceiling. Lighting
costs between a third and a half
•more per student; janitorial service
is expensive because there are more
square feet per student and a ce
ment floor collects everything in the
way of debris.
