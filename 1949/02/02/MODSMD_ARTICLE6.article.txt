# Split in Communist Party Key To U.S. Relations with Russia
## 
### 
Relations between the United
States and Russia depend upon a
split within the Communist Party.
The split has arisen over the ques
tion "Have the capitalistic nations
been brought to the brink of col
lapse by World War 11, or is their
economic solidarity intact?"
Dr. Anatole G. Mazour, Stanford
associate professor of history, voiced
this opinion in his Tuesday Evening
Series address last night.
''We are not sure just where Stalin
stands, he aid, "but we must re
member that the policies of the Com
munist Party are flexible and can be
changed to meet any emergency."
Stalin may choose to base his ac
tions on the beliefs held by the
Party faction lead by Varga, who be
lieves that the capitalistic nations do
not face collapse. Varga and his fol
lowers leel that Communism and
Capitalism can and must exist to
gether.
An economic crisis within the
capitalistic nations, says Varga, is
extremely unlikely, especially since
the advent of the European Recov
ery Program. Such a crisis, he be
lieves, could not happen until Eu
lope's production has reached at
least a pre-war level, which he esti
mates will take more than ten years.
The war added much power to the
capitalistic governments, and Varga
insists that it not only taught these
governments to plan their economy,
but proved they can do so.
Violently opposed to the Varga
faction are the Orthodox Marxists,
headed by Voznesscnsky, who argues
that a planned economy can exist
only in a Communistic state. Talk
of planned economy and of socialism
in capitalistic states, Voznessensky
insists, is merely deluding camou
flage, and these states arc rapidly de
caying economically. The Orthodox
Marxists, then, advocate active agi
tation for world revolution.
While Russia suffered greatly
during the past war, she gained in
prestige. But with the war's end,
the Cominform was revived and the
goodwill built up between the US
SR and the Western Powers was
wiped out by the Communists' re
vival of the idea of world revolu
tion.
"There can be no doubt that a
heavy responsibility for the decay
of relations between Russia and the
United States rests direct'y on Rus
sia." said Dr. Mazour.
Only by standing firm, morally as
well as physically, can we hope for
world peace, concluded Dr. Mazour.

''We are not sure just where Stalin
stands, he aid, "but we must re
member that the policies of the Com
munist Party are flexible and can be
changed to meet any emergency."
Stalin may choose to base his ac
tions on the beliefs held by the
Party faction lead by Varga, who be
lieves that the capitalistic nations do
not face collapse. Varga and his fol
lowers leel that Communism and
Capitalism can and must exist to
gether.
An economic crisis within the
capitalistic nations, says Varga, is
extremely unlikely, especially since
the advent of the European Recov
ery Program. Such a crisis, he be
lieves, could not happen until Eu
lope's production has reached at
least a pre-war level, which he esti
mates will take more than ten years.
The war added much power to the
capitalistic governments, and Varga
insists that it not only taught these
governments to plan their economy,
but proved they can do so.
Violently opposed to the Varga
faction are the Orthodox Marxists,
headed by Voznesscnsky, who argues
that a planned economy can exist
only in a Communistic state. Talk
of planned economy and of socialism
in capitalistic states, Voznessensky
insists, is merely deluding camou
flage, and these states arc rapidly de
caying economically. The Orthodox
Marxists, then, advocate active agi
tation for world revolution.
While Russia suffered greatly
during the past war, she gained in
prestige. But with the war's end,
the Cominform was revived and the
goodwill built up between the US
SR and the Western Powers was
wiped out by the Communists' re
vival of the idea of world revolu
tion.
"There can be no doubt that a
heavy responsibility for the decay
of relations between Russia and the
United States rests direct'y on Rus
sia." said Dr. Mazour.
Only by standing firm, morally as
well as physically, can we hope for
world peace, concluded Dr. Mazour.
Relations between the United
States and Russia depend upon a
split within the Communist Party.
The split has arisen over the ques
tion "Have the capitalistic nations
been brought to the brink of col
lapse by World War 11, or is their
economic solidarity intact?"
Dr. Anatole G. Mazour, Stanford
associate professor of history, voiced
this opinion in his Tuesday Evening
Series address last night.
