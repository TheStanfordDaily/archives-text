I feci a touch of Spring in
the air, but it is still too cold
for cotton. Filled with a de
sire to buy something new. I
started to wander from one
department to another in the
Clothes Closet. It had to be
wool, and yet it had to be
new.
I found what I was looking
for ... a special purchase
of gray men's wear flannel
skirts at the wonderful price
of only $7. I chose the belted
style with a kick pleat in
back. Perhaps you'd prefer
the trouser styleâ€”plain, with
a stitched front fly pleat.
They're a sensational buy.
While waiting for my pack
age. 1 pored over a table piled
high with earrings, another
special purchase. 1 hey were
all priced at only 7!t cents a
pair, and as a girl can never
have too many, I let myself
buy three pairs. Here's your
chance to choose from a mar
velous collection, so be sure
to drop in and see these two
s| ecials at the Clothes Closet.
