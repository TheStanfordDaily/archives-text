# Wolff Reports On Foreign Scholarships
## 
### 
Stanford's Foreign Scholarship
Program drew lengthy attention at
last night's Excom meeting.
The program chairman, Frank
Wolff, presented a full report on the
program thus far. He said that liv
ing groups housing this year's seven
students have reported general ap
proval of the scholarship program.
''Ideas have been exchanged, good
will spread, and outstanding Euro
pean students have expanded their
knowledge in the international rela
tions field," Wolff said.
More than 300 colleges throughout
the country have been contacted,
Wolff added, to get an idea how
many universities would like to
adopt the plan. Forty universities
have requested additional informa
tion. Fifteen other schools are con
sidering the plan for their students.
ASSIJ President Gus Chavalas
said, "Cur job is to spread the schol
arship program to other schools. The
full value of Stanford's investment
will be realized when other uni
versities adopt the plan."
In a letter addressed to Excom,
Ted Norton asked the body to con
sider some means to increase the
grants-in-aid fund for students un
able to pay the high cost of tuition.
"The G.I. Bill is running out, high
prices have not declined, and plans
for another Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram have developed." Norton
wrote. "We must give more consid
eration to our own students." He
suggested a grants-in-aid program
appropriation that would equal the
Foreign Scholarship Program.
Excom approved AWS minutes
containing women's approval of the
Demerit Plan. The Demerit System
will go into effect a week from to
night.
