### 
NANKING, Feb. 2 (/P).—Acting
President Li Tsung-jen may dare
all and. fly to Red territory in a
dramatic bid for peace, his friends
said today.
The Communists have marked
him as a "war criminal" but these
sources say he is ready to take his
chances if there seems no other
way.
There is growing belief in Nan
king, however, that Li at most will
be able to speak only for Nanking,
Shanghai, and Hankow.
(This is because most government
officials, over whom Li has no con
trol, have moved south to Canton.
Canton is scheduled to become the
new capital Saturday even though
Li intends to stay in Nanking.
(In Canton, Gov. Hsueh Lueh of
Kwangtung province announced on
Monday that regardless of what Li
does, the four southern provinces
ot Kwangtuns, Kwangsi. Hunan,
and Fukien will rght to the last.)
"The time has passed," said one
Chinese leader, "when Li or any
one else other than Chiang Kai
shek can make an agreement in
volving the whole nation and keep
it."
