# Acheson Rejects Soviet Peace Bid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (AP) —The United States today rejected
Premier Stalin's bid for a "peace" talk with President Truman
behind the Iron Curtain.
The new Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, stated the U.S.
position emphatically at a news conference, in which he indi-

rcctly accused the Soviet leader of
playing politics with peace hopes of
hundreds of millions of people.
Acheson blasted the Russian lead
ership on the ground that.it had con
sistently blocked all efforts in the
United Nations concerning disarma
ment, control of the atom bomb, and
creation of a UN police force.
Stalin Meeting
The White House stood by its posi
tion that President Truman would bt
willing to see Stalin—in Washington.
But Acheson emphasized that, even
in Washington, there would be nc
discussions which left other inter
ested nations out in the cold.
Stalin claimed that his health
would not permit him to travel
abroad, so the matter apparently
had reached a dead end.
Acheson came to his news con
ference primed to reply, in detail,
to Stalin's latest moves — moves
which many Washington officials be
lieve are instrumental in gaining the
premier an advantageous propa
ganda position in the cold war.
Acheson Replies
Referring to voluminous notes,
t Acheson replied point by point t<
J statements Stalin made last Sunday
i in response to questions from an
American news correspondent.
I Kingsbury Smith, of the Interna
tional News Service. Stalin followed
up today with a wire to Smith bid
] ding for a meeting with Truman in
! Russia, Poland or Czechoslovakia.
The substance of Stalin's state
ments Sunday was that he would be
| prepared to consider joint issuance
of a "peace declaration" with the
United States, that he had no objec
| tion to a meeting with President
' Truman, that Russia naturally would
cooperate with the United States in
' disarmament under such a "pact of
peace." and that the Berlin blockade
j would be lifted on certain condi
! tions.
Two Points
In reply, Acheson made two major
points:
1. He asserted that the United
j States would "not discuss with any
| nation any matter of direct interest
to other nations without the partici
: pation of the representatives of those
I other nations."
2. As for a "peace" declaration.
Acheson said he found this sugges
tion "puzzling." Russia, the United
; States, and all other UN members
i are already pledged "by j-nost sol
i emn treaty commitments not to en
gage in war with one another," he
i said.
Peace "Sacred"
At outset of his lengthy analysis
of the questions and answers and
again at the end, Acheson declared
that the hopes of the world's peoples
for peace are considered by this gov
ernment to be fundamental and "sa
cred, ' and the United States would
never "play international politics
with a matter of this importance."

The substance of Stalin's state
ments Sunday was that he would be

of a "peace declaration" with the
United States, that he had no objec

Two Points
In reply, Acheson made two major
points:
1. He asserted that the United
j States would "not discuss with any
| nation any matter of direct interest
to other nations without the partici
: pation of the representatives of those
I other nations."
2. As for a "peace" declaration.
Acheson said he found this sugges
tion "puzzling." Russia, the United
; States, and all other UN members
i are already pledged "by j-nost sol
i emn treaty commitments not to en
gage in war with one another," he
i said.
Peace "Sacred"
At outset of his lengthy analysis
of the questions and answers and
again at the end, Acheson declared
that the hopes of the world's peoples
for peace are considered by this gov
ernment to be fundamental and "sa

never "play international politics
with a matter of this importance."


DEAN ACHESON, Secretary of
State, turned down Stalin's offer
for a peace meeting with Presi
dent Truman.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (AP) —The United States today rejected
Premier Stalin's bid for a "peace" talk with President Truman
behind the Iron Curtain.
The new Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, stated the U.S.
position emphatically at a news conference, in which he indi-

rcctly accused the Soviet leader of
playing politics with peace hopes of
hundreds of millions of people.
Acheson blasted the Russian lead
ership on the ground that.it had con
sistently blocked all efforts in the
United Nations concerning disarma
ment, control of the atom bomb, and
creation of a UN police force.
Stalin Meeting
The White House stood by its posi
tion that President Truman would bt
willing to see Stalin—in Washington.
But Acheson emphasized that, even
in Washington, there would be nc
discussions which left other inter
ested nations out in the cold.
Stalin claimed that his health
would not permit him to travel
abroad, so the matter apparently
had reached a dead end.
Acheson came to his news con
ference primed to reply, in detail,
to Stalin's latest moves — moves
which many Washington officials be
lieve are instrumental in gaining the
premier an advantageous propa
ganda position in the cold war.
