# Poll Reveals Opposition To Socialized Medicine
## 
### AL JOYCE 
A recent poll conducted on cam
pus by Roger Goodfriend, a pre
med student, found over 70 per cent
of Stanford students opposed to so
eia.'ized medicine. The chief reason
for their opposition was the appar
ent conviction that the quality of
medical attention wou'cl deteriorate.
Goodfriend said that the poll,
compiled on the return of over half
of 300 questionnaires distributed
around campus, would be represen
tative of Stanford students. He es
pecially emphasized the point that
the results would not be represen
tative of the country as a whole for
obvious reasons.
Apparently the majority of the 24
per cent who favored socialized
medicine wanted it as a humani
tarian measure, but did not want it
for themselves. For instance, 65 per
cent of those favoring socialized
medicine would prefer to receive
medical attention from private
practitioners rather than from the
state.
Goodfriend indicated that the
answers of the groups favoring and
those opposed to socialized medi
cine varied in consistency. The re
plies of those opposed to socialized
medicine tended to be more con
sistent and informed than those fa
voring socialized medicine. Here are
the answers to some of the more

important questions in the poll.
"Do you advocate government
controlled medical care plans?"

A recent poll conducted on cam
pus by Roger Goodfriend, a pre
med student, found over 70 per cent
of Stanford students opposed to so
eia.'ized medicine. The chief reason
for their opposition was the appar
ent conviction that the quality of
medical attention wou'cl deteriorate.
Goodfriend said that the poll,
compiled on the return of over half
of 300 questionnaires distributed
around campus, would be represen
tative of Stanford students. He es
pecially emphasized the point that
the results would not be represen
tative of the country as a whole for
obvious reasons.
Apparently the majority of the 24
per cent who favored socialized
medicine wanted it as a humani
tarian measure, but did not want it
for themselves. For instance, 65 per
cent of those favoring socialized
medicine would prefer to receive
medical attention from private
practitioners rather than from the
state.
Goodfriend indicated that the
answers of the groups favoring and
those opposed to socialized medi
cine varied in consistency. The re
plies of those opposed to socialized
medicine tended to be more con
sistent and informed than those fa
voring socialized medicine. Here are
the answers to some of the more

important questions in the poll.
"Do you advocate government
controlled medical care plans?"
Yes No No Ans.
