# Mazour Says Russian Crisis Relates to Civilization Level
## 
### 
Russia hangs, as usual, like a cloud, dark and ominous, on the
edge of Europe." Dr. Anatole G. Mazour prefaced his Tuesday-
Evening Series lecture this week with this quotation which ap
peared in Harper's Weekly on Oct. 10, 1857.
Noting this parallel to Russia's position today, Dr. Mazour pro-

ceeded to point out that the current
international crisis can well be |
viewed with relation to the devel- l
opment of the Russian people.
Russia has been a frontier civiliza- j
tion, explained Dr. Mazour. And
>uch a civilization breeds a degree j
<>112 assumed superiority, perhaps a
secret envy of other civilizations,
and certainly an open desire to
surpass them.
Geographic Conditions
The limitless plains of Russia and
the people's attachment to the land, j
said Dr. Mazour, bear great resem
blance to the Midwest in the United
States. These factors, coupled with
Russia's severe climate, the repeated j
invasions of the Russian lands, and |
ihe long existence of serfdom in
Russian society, combined to instill j
in the Russian people the qualities |
of callousness, patience, and the air j
of melancholy so consistently re
jected in Russian art and literature. j
"Russia is an old people, but a j
young nation." said Dr. Mazour. '
There has been in Russia a promi- j
nent lack of antiquities, of interest
in its historical background.
Philosophies
Such conditions have led the Rus- j
sian people to a kind of audacity, a
willingness to experiment with new
social theories and economic philoso
phies. The Russian has a certain
indifference to suffering and dislike
nf haste. His endurance is such that
he can bear oppression better than
Western Europeans, Dr. Mazour ex- j
plained.
"The Russian is stubborn and sly
.... the 'prince of evasion'," said
Dr. Mazour, "but he is terrible when
aroused!"
Russia's history is riddled with ;
peasant revolts, but the Russian is ;
essentially a peace-loving man.
"When I think ef the Russian as
an individual,' said Dr. Mazour, "I
am reminded of a woman: he is gen
tle. But collectively , . .

The Russian, according to Dr. Ma
zour, considers himself the champion
of all people and the Russian nation
a sort of midwife to deliver the new
order on a world scale.
World-Wide Communism
In 1927, according to Dr. Mazour,
Russia realized there was little hope
for world revolution and acceptance
of Communism. Thus, she switched
her policy of international Com
munism to a policy of national so
cialism.
Now, as the good will built, up
during World War II between Russia
and the Western Powers has been
allowed to decay, we once more face
an international crisis.

tion. Dr. Mazour said:
'Suspicion breeds suspicion. Never
have so many known so little about
so much."

The Russian, according to Dr. Ma
zour, considers himself the champion
of all people and the Russian nation
a sort of midwife to deliver the new
order on a world scale.
World-Wide Communism
In 1927, according to Dr. Mazour,
Russia realized there was little hope
for world revolution and acceptance
of Communism. Thus, she switched
her policy of international Com
munism to a policy of national so
cialism.
Now, as the good will built, up
during World War II between Russia
and the Western Powers has been
allowed to decay, we once more face
an international crisis.
Summing up the current situa
tion. Dr. Mazour said:
'Suspicion breeds suspicion. Never
have so many known so little about
so much."
Russia hangs, as usual, like a cloud, dark and ominous, on the
edge of Europe." Dr. Anatole G. Mazour prefaced his Tuesday-
Evening Series lecture this week with this quotation which ap
peared in Harper's Weekly on Oct. 10, 1857.
Noting this parallel to Russia's position today, Dr. Mazour pro-

ceeded to point out that the current
international crisis can well be |
viewed with relation to the devel- l
opment of the Russian people.
Russia has been a frontier civiliza- j
tion, explained Dr. Mazour. And
>uch a civilization breeds a degree j
<>112 assumed superiority, perhaps a
secret envy of other civilizations,
and certainly an open desire to
surpass them.
Geographic Conditions
The limitless plains of Russia and
the people's attachment to the land, j
said Dr. Mazour, bear great resem
blance to the Midwest in the United
States. These factors, coupled with
Russia's severe climate, the repeated j
invasions of the Russian lands, and |
ihe long existence of serfdom in
Russian society, combined to instill j
in the Russian people the qualities |
of callousness, patience, and the air j
of melancholy so consistently re
jected in Russian art and literature. j
"Russia is an old people, but a j
young nation." said Dr. Mazour. '
There has been in Russia a promi- j
nent lack of antiquities, of interest
in its historical background.
Philosophies
Such conditions have led the Rus- j
sian people to a kind of audacity, a
willingness to experiment with new
social theories and economic philoso
phies. The Russian has a certain
indifference to suffering and dislike
nf haste. His endurance is such that
he can bear oppression better than
Western Europeans, Dr. Mazour ex- j
plained.
"The Russian is stubborn and sly
.... the 'prince of evasion'," said
Dr. Mazour, "but he is terrible when
aroused!"
Russia's history is riddled with ;
peasant revolts, but the Russian is ;
essentially a peace-loving man.

an individual,' said Dr. Mazour, "I
