# Stanford Students Correspond With Berlin Free University
## 
### 
Farm students may correspond
personally with students at the
Free University of Berlin if they
so wish, Gretchen Blaesing, SIRO
chairman, announced today.
Nearly 2,000 pounds of c'othing
collected by Stanfordites through
SIRO is being flown to the Free
University next week by airlift.
SIRO has on file a list of names
and addresses of Berlin students to
whom this clothing is being sent.
Students who would like to hear
directly from Berlin where their
donations went and to what use
they were put may contact the
SIRO office in the lIR shack. In
formation concerning the individual
Berlin students, such as age and
interests, is available on the corre
spondence list.
Several Stanford students are now
corresponding with persons at the
university and in the Berlin area.
Typical of tlje sentiment expressed
in many letters from these people
whom the clothing collection drive
will help is this excerpt:
' We have lo learn now, that ev
ery one is a human being and that
not others, called government or
authority can govern without limi
tation, but that it is his duty to
know what happens and to say if
he does not agree. And to do what
he can do. To learn this is our

task. Maybe that in this way that
democracy as a holding, not as a
form of government, may become
a tradition in German. Only by this
way we can find a worthy base of
agreement between Germans and
fel'owship to others abroad. May
be, later on!"
Clothing and books may be
turned in to SIKO until tomorrow
afternoon. SIRO office hours are '■*>
to 5 every week day.
