## For 57 Years 
### 
Student government has operated so well at Stanford for 57
years it is pretty much taken for granted. True, the spirited ASSU
elections last spring brought out a record number of voters. But
ior the most part student government operates without a large
percentage of students realizing how importantâ€”and how unfet
tered it really is.
However, two people have been overly impressed with Stan
ford's unique program of student control.
One of them is John O'Connor, graduate student in journalism,
a transfer from Notre Dame. O'Connor was so surprised at the
complete freedom exercised by students in running their own
affairs that he wrote a magazine article telling about the scheme.
He pointed out that disciplinary regulations, publications, ac
tivity funds, dramatic productions, concerts, motion pictures, stu
dent police, and a score of social activities at Stanfod come under
the direction and control of the student body though its asso
ciation.
The other person who has been impressed with student gov
ernment is The Daily Editor. More than anything else in our
dealings with faculty, alumni, and administration we've learned
that student government is respected and scrupulously guarded.
Such an interest by the older members of the Stanford Family
should elicit an equal fervor among students. We hope the in
terest generated in last year's ASSU election, and the number of
candidates for the winter quarter by-elections are an indication
of a trend in that direction.
One of the most important phases of student government at
:he moment is the revision of the constitution. The work is being
handled by capable persons, but more students should attend the
-hearings on the different sections of the constitution so that a
good representative opinion is obtained.
Another important operation of student government will take
place next Wednesday when the ASSU elections are held. These
elections are important because six posts on the Student Council
are to be filled. The best possible candidates should be elected.
Remember, above all, that student government at Stanford,
although highly successful for 57 years, is only as strong as the
students behind it or participating in it.
