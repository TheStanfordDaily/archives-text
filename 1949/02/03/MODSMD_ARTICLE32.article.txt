## Bull Session 
### 
THE PERFECT ANSWER
Waiters are a sharp breed. They have to be. Now take one famous
•ase I know of. The customer beckons, "Waiter," lie says, "there's a fly
in my soup!"
Now if you were a waiter, what would you say?

1. Don't point, sir, this is a classy joint.
2. Yes, the little rascals really get around, don't they?
3. Shh. all the customers will be wanting one.
4. So, I'll bring you a fork.
5. I see you've cornered him at last.
6. Well, give him some help. You can see he's try
ing to get out, can't you?
7. What do you think I am—a lifeguard?
8. Be careful, sir, our food is so full of vitamins he
may attack you.

9. if he's green, you win a cream puff, sir.
10. Specialty of the house, sir.
11. You need glasses. Can't you tell a bullfrog when you see one?
12. I've got a million answers for that one, sir.
There's your first lesson. Now, supposing a customer calls you. as a
•waiter, over and says there are two flies ni his soup. Then what do you
say?
1. Looks like the little fellow is the better swimmer, doesn't it?
2. Aha, he's her now, hasn't he?
3. Did you find the green one yet?
Now the lessons really get tough. Suppose the customer calls you,
■-till as a waiter, and says, "what does this mean? There's a fly in the
j ittom of my tea cup." Do you have a comeback?
1. How do I know? I'm not a fortune teller.
2. The little rascals sure get around don't they? (Stock answer.)
3. So he got high on tea? His name must be Mitchum.
4. Did you find the green one yet?
Waiters have been getting it in the neck long enough. If a dinner is
slow coming out of the kitchen, he gets the blame, even. The customer
always has some studied smart rejoinder he's been waiting to spring for
months .... like "Aren't you the waiter who took my order? How did
you enjoy your vacation?"
If he orders turtle soup I know a good comeback. Say, "Yes, sir, but
you know how turtles are." If he orders something else, you're on your
own. Except coffee. If he complains that the coffee tastes like mud, you
can always remind him that it was just ground this morning.
As a waiter, I've noticed that if the customers were twice as cute as
they try to be, they still wouldn't be half as cute as they think they are.

•waiter, over and says there are two flies ni his soup. Then what do you
say?
1. Looks like the little fellow is the better swimmer, doesn't it?
2. Aha, he's her now, hasn't he?
3. Did you find the green one yet?
Now the lessons really get tough. Suppose the customer calls you,
■-till as a waiter, and says, "what does this mean? There's a fly in the
j ittom of my tea cup." Do you have a comeback?
1. How do I know? I'm not a fortune teller.
2. The little rascals sure get around don't they? (Stock answer.)
3. So he got high on tea? His name must be Mitchum.
4. Did you find the green one yet?
Waiters have been getting it in the neck long enough. If a dinner is
slow coming out of the kitchen, he gets the blame, even. The customer
always has some studied smart rejoinder he's been waiting to spring for
months .... like "Aren't you the waiter who took my order? How did
you enjoy your vacation?"
If he orders turtle soup I know a good comeback. Say, "Yes, sir, but
you know how turtles are." If he orders something else, you're on your
own. Except coffee. If he complains that the coffee tastes like mud, you
can always remind him that it was just ground this morning.
As a waiter, I've noticed that if the customers were twice as cute as
they try to be, they still wouldn't be half as cute as they think they are.

THE PERFECT ANSWER
Waiters are a sharp breed. They have to be. Now take one famous
•ase I know of. The customer beckons, "Waiter," lie says, "there's a fly
in my soup!"
Now if you were a waiter, what would you say?

1. Don't point, sir, this is a classy joint.
2. Yes, the little rascals really get around, don't they?
3. Shh. all the customers will be wanting one.
4. So, I'll bring you a fork.
5. I see you've cornered him at last.
6. Well, give him some help. You can see he's try
ing to get out, can't you?
7. What do you think I am—a lifeguard?
8. Be careful, sir, our food is so full of vitamins he
may attack you.

9. if he's green, you win a cream puff, sir.
10. Specialty of the house, sir.
11. You need glasses. Can't you tell a bullfrog when you see one?
12. I've got a million answers for that one, sir.
There's your first lesson. Now, supposing a customer calls you. as a

say?
