# Frau Lobbies To Share Men In Germany
## 
### GEORGE BOULTWOOD 
HAMBURG, Germany, Feb. 2 (/P).
—A twice-wed woman schoolteach
er is fighting ior legal husband
sharing in Germany, and to put
papa in his place.
Iler main objective: more babies,
despite the man shortage.
Mrs. Dorothy Klaje, 52. contends
husbands, while necessary, are "un
important" in themselves. In broad
casts and interviews, she is cam
paigning to make women the domi
nant family members and to pass
around the husbands under a sys
tem of short-term marriages.
Pick a Man
She tells the girls her plan would
work like this:
You pick a husband for a specific
period. At the end of the period,
turn him loose. Divorce will not be
necessary; just report to the town
hall that the marriage has expired.
The man then could go on to the
next woman who wanted him.
Mrs. Klaje, who is childless, says
some 7,000,000 German women now
have no hope of getting husbands or
bearing legitimate children. Her
husband - sharing plan, she says,
would boom the birth rate and
"save our culture."
She demands that her proposals
be written into the West German
constitution, now under study at
Bonn.
Question of Time
"Time marriage" is her term for
the plan. She also wants the law to
decree that wives shall retain their
maiden names, which also would
become family names. Name and
property would descend to eldest
daughter, as name and property
have descended to eldest son.
Men seem prone at first to dismiss
her ideas as "Nazi theories." After
a little thought, however, they say
that comparison is bad.
The Nazis wanted the blond Nor
dic "superman" to be dominant, and
while she also wants more babies
born, Mrs. Klaie calls the Nazi en
couragement of births out of wed
lock repugnant.
There has been practically no of
ficial comment.
No Immorality
A Hamburg secretary, unmarried,
said warily some of the girls she
knows who do not expect to get
husbands wou!d like to raise fami
lies and are willing to "support
children on their earnings, but they
don't want to be immoral."
A Protestant church spokesman
said Mrs. Klaje's views are not be
ing taken seriously. The constitu
tion-drafters at Bonn said they are
not yet "aware" of her demands.
None of the men would be quoted
on it.
Both the former husbands of Mrs.
Klaje are dead.

Bonn.
Question of Time
"Time marriage" is her term for
the plan. She also wants the law to
decree that wives shall retain their
maiden names, which also would
become family names. Name and
property would descend to eldest
daughter, as name and property
have descended to eldest son.
Men seem prone at first to dismiss
her ideas as "Nazi theories." After
a little thought, however, they say
that comparison is bad.
The Nazis wanted the blond Nor
dic "superman" to be dominant, and
while she also wants more babies
born, Mrs. Klaie calls the Nazi en
couragement of births out of wed
lock repugnant.
There has been practically no of
ficial comment.
No Immorality
A Hamburg secretary, unmarried,
said warily some of the girls she
knows who do not expect to get
husbands wou!d like to raise fami
lies and are willing to "support
children on their earnings, but they
don't want to be immoral."
A Protestant church spokesman
said Mrs. Klaje's views are not be
ing taken seriously. The constitu
tion-drafters at Bonn said they are
not yet "aware" of her demands.
None of the men would be quoted
on it.
Both the former husbands of Mrs.
Klaje are dead.
HAMBURG, Germany, Feb. 2 (/P).
—A twice-wed woman schoolteach
er is fighting ior legal husband
sharing in Germany, and to put
papa in his place.
Iler main objective: more babies,
despite the man shortage.
Mrs. Dorothy Klaje, 52. contends
husbands, while necessary, are "un
important" in themselves. In broad
casts and interviews, she is cam
paigning to make women the domi
nant family members and to pass
around the husbands under a sys
tem of short-term marriages.
Pick a Man
She tells the girls her plan would
work like this:
You pick a husband for a specific
period. At the end of the period,
turn him loose. Divorce will not be
necessary; just report to the town
hall that the marriage has expired.
The man then could go on to the
next woman who wanted him.
Mrs. Klaje, who is childless, says
some 7,000,000 German women now
have no hope of getting husbands or
bearing legitimate children. Her
husband - sharing plan, she says,
would boom the birth rate and
"save our culture."
She demands that her proposals
be written into the West German
constitution, now under study at
Bonn.
