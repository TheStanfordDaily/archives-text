# Telephone Situation Bad, Not Improving
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
So you want a telephone? Well,
you're not going to gel one, so there.
Go hide in I he closet and cry about
it—you're still not going to get a
phone. Claustrophobia, yes, but not
a phone.
Why aren't you going to get one?
Simple. There are 1,600 applica
tions on file at the Pacific Telephone
and Te'egraph Company offices in
Palo Alto. They should have had
their phones last August.
Last November and December the
company finally was able to release
2.400 phones to customers who
should have had their phones be
fore August. The next release of
phones will be 10 months from now
in November. Until then, the only
way for customers to be supplied
will be via a high priority:' you
have to be a doctor, dentist, seri
ously i 1!, a U.S. general, or the Gov
ernor of California. Here's your
chance to get into politics. That way
you get a new career and a new
phone at the same time.
"If the demand continues after the
November phone installations," said
local manager Mr. J. L. Sweeney,
"we'll soon again be right back to
a big backlog of unfilled orders such
as we now have." Mr. Sweeney is
not a happy man.
In short, demand is by far exceed
ing supply, though the Western
Electric Company, a subsidiary of
the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company, is manufacturing
equipment for the local Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company,
also a subsidiary, on a 24-hour ba
sis. The situation will remain criti
cal for quite some time.
The local phone company is pro

viding service for 20.000 customers
in the Palo Alto, Menlo Paik, and
Atherton area, all handled through
the Palo Alto exchange. However,
the Palo Alto population has grown
by almost 10,000 people since 1040.
'"In one year we put in approxi
mate'y 8,000 phones. That has still
not been enough," Mr. Sweeney
added. "On the Pacific mo-re
than 1.000,000 phones have been in
stalled since V-J Day. Before the
war it took our company, the AT&T.
15 years to do that." In addition,
the local PT&T is spending 5500.000
a day on the Pacific Coast.
Stanford, as a university, gets a
number one priority for new phone
installations. But students and most
professors are just like anyone else
in their private capacities — they,
too, face the closet treatment.
If you're ever lucky enough to
procure a phone, you might as well
know now that the home phones in
this area are connected with one
of four unique phone exchanges in
the United States. Only Palo Alto.
Redwood City, a Los Angeles ex
change, and one small one in the
East near Philadelphia have what
are known as customer toll dials.
In this area the home customer can
dial directly to San Francisco or al
most any other place in the Bay
Area without going through the
delaying intermediary operator.
The phone company is already
prepared to handle the installation
of new instruments in the Law
School and next year in Stern Hall.
But, as for you—hack into the
closet. Any communicating that
you'll be doing for at least a year
more will be via the spirits, or <i
long bicycle ride to the nearest pub
lic phone booth.

lic phone booth.
So you want a telephone? Well,
you're not going to gel one, so there.
Go hide in I he closet and cry about
it—you're still not going to get a
phone. Claustrophobia, yes, but not
a phone.
Why aren't you going to get one?
Simple. There are 1,600 applica
tions on file at the Pacific Telephone
and Te'egraph Company offices in
Palo Alto. They should have had
their phones last August.
Last November and December the
company finally was able to release
2.400 phones to customers who
should have had their phones be
fore August. The next release of
phones will be 10 months from now
in November. Until then, the only
way for customers to be supplied
will be via a high priority:' you
have to be a doctor, dentist, seri
ously i 1!, a U.S. general, or the Gov
ernor of California. Here's your
chance to get into politics. That way
you get a new career and a new
phone at the same time.
"If the demand continues after the
November phone installations," said
local manager Mr. J. L. Sweeney,
"we'll soon again be right back to
a big backlog of unfilled orders such
as we now have." Mr. Sweeney is
not a happy man.
In short, demand is by far exceed
ing supply, though the Western
Electric Company, a subsidiary of
the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company, is manufacturing
equipment for the local Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company,
also a subsidiary, on a 24-hour ba
sis. The situation will remain criti
cal for quite some time.
The local phone company is pro

viding service for 20.000 customers
in the Palo Alto, Menlo Paik, and
Atherton area, all handled through
the Palo Alto exchange. However,
the Palo Alto population has grown
by almost 10,000 people since 1040.
'"In one year we put in approxi
mate'y 8,000 phones. That has still
not been enough," Mr. Sweeney
added. "On the Pacific mo-re
than 1.000,000 phones have been in
stalled since V-J Day. Before the
war it took our company, the AT&T.
15 years to do that." In addition,
the local PT&T is spending 5500.000
a day on the Pacific Coast.
Stanford, as a university, gets a
number one priority for new phone
installations. But students and most
professors are just like anyone else
in their private capacities — they,
too, face the closet treatment.
If you're ever lucky enough to
procure a phone, you might as well
know now that the home phones in
this area are connected with one
of four unique phone exchanges in
the United States. Only Palo Alto.
Redwood City, a Los Angeles ex
change, and one small one in the
East near Philadelphia have what
are known as customer toll dials.
In this area the home customer can
dial directly to San Francisco or al
most any other place in the Bay
Area without going through the
delaying intermediary operator.
The phone company is already
prepared to handle the installation
of new instruments in the Law
School and next year in Stern Hall.
