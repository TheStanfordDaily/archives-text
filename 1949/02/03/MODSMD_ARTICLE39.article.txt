To the Editor:
We, the iVicmbers of Living Group 253, wish to raise our voices in protests
of righteous indignation. The picture Mr. Wieder has painted of our
living conditions is quite descriptive but altogether one-sided and inade
quate. A harsh invective upon you. Tom Wieder! May you "Freeze and
Fry" as your headline states, unto all eternity.
ft is intimated in The Daily's article that we are beinj, oppressed and
discriminated against. Let it be known that there exists in Stanford
Village no "more inhabitable" quarters which we would consider changing
for our own. We live here because we like it. There is a greater spirit of
cemeraderie in Building 253 than in any other'group on or off the campus.
It is outrageous to think that the editors of The Daily would permit an
article so purely libelous as that to be printed without even consulting us.
We believe that a public apology is the least wc are due, and henceforth
we would appreciate your reporters keeping their opinions to themselves
on matters such as these.

(Ed. Note: Tom Wieder reported only the sub-par living conditions
of old No. 253. or what seemed so to him. We are glad to learn that
"tameraderie" more than makes up for the conditions described by re
porter Wieder.)
