## 
### 
By SHIRLEY GABBERT
Stanford's UN Education Cen
ter serves a very important job
not only as a Farm organization,
but in the world as a whole.
Started only last summer, it has
been designated by the United Na
tions as their official educational
renter cÂ£ the West Coast.
Previously there had been groups
at eastern universities and scattered
groups in the West distributing in
formation concerning the UN to
.idults. But nobody had been doing
the job for high school students, the
ones who will he running the UN
and the world in a few short years.
That is the job the UN Education
Center does. By means of bi
monthiy bulletins and student
speakers, it keeps students of
Northern California high schools,
except those in the three counties
handled by Cal. informed on the
current activities and accomplish
ments of the United Nations.
Provides Literature
The center sends bulletins and
literature to civic and non-govern
mental organizations such as the
League of Women Voters, as well as
to the high schools. Requests for in
formation from other sources are re

ferred to the World Affairs Council
of Northern California in San Fran
cisco.
Bill Hayden. director, says that
they hope soon to set up a UN in
formation table in the lIR office
where Farm students may obtain
literature and other information
concerning the United Nations at
any time.
Bi-Monthly Bulletin
Hearing of a high school teacher
who complained. "I would really like
lo teach my classes about the United
Nations, but I just don't know
enough about it. By the way. what
i.s this Lake Success I've been hear
ing about? Bill Hayden and his
committee set up their bi-monthly
bullelins to combat similar ignorance
with concrete information.
The second of the bulletins con
tained 40 suggestions for incorpor
ating international study in the
regular curriculum through such
classes as world literature, govern
ment and home economics and for
general international activity. Since
Ihe issue of this bulletin the educa
tion center has had complimentary
letters on it with requests lor more
copies lor distribution from the
State Department, the United Na
tions, and from the World Affairs
Council in San Francisco.
Explains UN
Bulletin number three, a simpli
fied version of the United Nations
Charter, explains the mechanics of
the organization. Intended primarily
for high school students, the bulletin
not only outlines the charter itself,
but also cites examples of actual
cases which luive come up under the
different provisions.
Many high schools have reported

to the Farm center that they have
mimeographed copies and are using
it in their history and government
classes.
To combat the "do nothing" criti
cism currently directed at the United
Nations. Hayden has compiled in his
fourth bulletin a list of actual ac
complishments of the organization
since its inception lour years ago.
Student Speakers
The Stanford Speakers Bureau,
under the chairmanship of Frank
Carpenter, will send a student
speaker to any high school or other
group upon request. They are speak
ing on such currently significant
topics as "Crisis in Palestine,"
"Japan in a Divided World," "Soviet
Foreign Policy." and "UNESCO in
Community Life."
The UNESCO Relations Staff is a
sub-committee of the UN Education
Center. Its recent formation came
about as a result ol the IIR-spon
sored high school conference on
UNESCO last December. Under the
direction of Charles Miller, the .staff
hopes to carry out the work started
by the conference by forming
UNESCO councils in high schools
and then helping them form an ex
ecutive board made up of students,
teachers, and principals.
