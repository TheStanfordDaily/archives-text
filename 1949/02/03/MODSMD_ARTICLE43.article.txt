# Activities Agency Serves Students and Organizations
## 
### JAN HANSON 
Have you always wanted to play the tuba? Are you an anthro
pology major with a secret yearning for the end spot in a chorus
line? If you have some such thwarted ambition, Activities
Agency may find a place for you, said Hardin Holmes, co-chair
man of the agency.
The main function of this Cardinals sponsored agency is to co-

ordinate campus organizations need
ing workers and students wanting
to work.
Activities Agency is a relatively
new organization. It was started two
years ago and is still somewhat in
the experimental stage.
Last year, all students were asked
to fill out cards indicating campus
activities in which they were inter
ested. These cards were placed on
file in the Activities Office for the
reference of any interested groups.
Files Not Used
Until this year, campus groups
have made little use of the files.
This fali, however, the Activities
Agency compiled lists of names for
most of the larger Farm organiza
tions.
"Activities Morning" was insti
tuted as a part of the pre-reg pro
gram last autumn quarter. All the
major campus organizations were
asked to maintain booths at Union
Court to explain their activities to
the freshmen and take sign-ups.
Temporary committees, such as
dance committees, or the commit
tees in charge of the Con Home
Drive, have most recourse to Un
files,
Ihe larger, permanent organiza
tions usually arc able to enlist
enough members during their regu
lar tryout periods, so have little
need to consult the files. Students
interested in joining such organiza
tions are advised to try out person
ally instead of waiting to be invited
to join.
Streamlining
At present, Activities Agency is
embarking on a program to stream
line its operations and stimulate
more interest in its services. First
on the program is a plan to vest
executive authority in one chairman

instead of two.
The filing system, too, is being
simplified. In the future, only fresh
men will be asked to fill out cards;
and these will be kept on file for
four years.
Activities Agency has other duties
too. Before the recent constitutional
revision, it was in charge of editing
and distributing the Frosh Bible.
