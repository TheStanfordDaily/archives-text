### JOHN HALL 
It will be the King of the West
meeting the Ciown Prince of the
East tomorrow night when Stan
ford moves over to the Cow
Palace to entertain CCNY's pow
erful Beavers.
Stanford and CCNY will get to
gether at 9:30 p.m. in the second
half of a Frank Walsh double
header that also features USF's
snappy Hilltoppers clashing with
use.
Tops In East
Nat Holman's Beavers, just of! the
plane from New York, are rated
the best club in the tough Metro
politan area, and in living up to their
rating, have won 11 and lost 2 so
far this season.
But running up sensational sea
son records is nothing new to CCNY.
Their coach, the colorful Nat Hol
man, has a way with the win column
that few other coaches have been
able to match.
In his 30-year reign, the Beavers
have won 75 per cent of their games,
and have been consistently ranked
among the top 10 teams in the na
tion.
Eleven Victims
This -season CCNY has beaten
Queens, Paterson, Brit/nam Young,
Brooklyn College. Kings Point, Ok
lahoma, Newark, Miami, St. John's.
St. Joseph's, and West Virginia.
The Beavers have not received
their share of the limelight recently,
mainly because of two losses to
Southern Methodist and USF. but
with a chance to knock off both
Stanford and USF this weekend.
CCNY could hop back into national
prominence.
CCNY actually has the ability to
rank light at the top. and will be
out to prove it tomorrow night. So
Stanford won't be taking
chances when it goes out to protect
its ninth-in-the-nation standing.
The Cards will be- out to run up
their 18th win of the season, as weii
as stretch their present winning
streak to eight.
Thirteen 1,-ettermen
Led by co-captains Hilty Shapiro
and Sonny Jameson. CCNY will
floor a veteran five, backed up by
13 returning lettermen and a host
of Eastern sharpies that do fancy
tricks with a basketball.
Shapiro is playing his fourth year
1 of ball for the Beavers, and is the
spark ol their attack. He is a come
through point maker, having netted
124 points in 13 contests.
Individual scoring leader is Irwin
Dambrot although the team has re
vealed what is probably the best
balanced scoring punch in the na
lion. Dambrot has 148 points, and
center Sonny Jameson follows
closely with 141.
KS.(i Average
Being one of Ihe fastest breaking
teams in the country, CCNY has
demonstrated potent offensive abil
ity by averaging 63.6 points per
game for a 13-game total of 892.
The New Yorkers shoot from all
angles and should offer quite a con
trast to last week's Cow Palace foe.
Pittsburgh's deliberate Panthers.
Other featured cogs in the Holman
machine are Joe Caliber, 135 points.
I Norm Mager 101, and Mike Wittlin
99 points. Coach Nat figures he has
six regulars, and any one of these
men can get hot enough on a given
night to produce a CCNY victory.


SONNY JAMESON, six font, 175-pnund CCNY cage star, is blessed with
plenty of swift in his legs. Hated as one of (he speediest doormen in the
nation, Jameson is the second-highest scorer on the City College hall
club. He has tanked 141 points in 13 games. He will open at a forward
spot when CCNY faces Stanford tomorrow night at 9:30 p.m. in the
Cow Palace. Sonrry will he on the Farm today when he and bis team
