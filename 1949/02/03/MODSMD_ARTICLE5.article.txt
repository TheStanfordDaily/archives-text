# Darwell's Cham Makes 'Build No Fence Around Me'
## 
### 
Last night's performance of
"Build No Fence Around Me"
proved one thing —if Alexander
Greendale wants his play on Broad
way, that's where it's apt to go.
More than a "howling" success
from start to finish, this play has
warmth and bigness of heart. It has
that quality which writers hailed as
Americanism in "The Human Com
edy."
Jane Darwell, sparkling and nat
ural in the role of Maw Bevin, nes
tled into the heart of her audience
right from the start. What describes
her better than Jules living's lines:
"If Mrs. Bevin isn't a character and
a half, I don't know who is"?
Humor in the play runs high and
constant throughout the three acts,
which cover a good two and a half
hours. The well-delivered prattle
of the Windy City boy is a refresh
ing change and contrast of family
jokes which are developed within
the play. (Sample: "I'm from Chi
cago. It's got a bad reputation, but
don't you be'ieve it, even though
every day ten people die there.)
The best minor performance was
turned in by Hal Todd as the loan
company agent who just didn't have
the heart to see the loan foreclosed.
Scenery for the show portrayed
the wide-open Texas horizon, and
not a trick of realism was spared.
Norman Rock, designer, saw to it
that the stars really twinkled and
the rainbow really shone.
The play threatened to stagger off
the stage in its happy ending, how
ever, but Maw and Irv managed to
make it stand on its feet. All in all,
it's a better-than-good comedy with
a most capable director, Dr. A.
