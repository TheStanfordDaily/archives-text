# Ky Ebright To See New Stanford Crew Facilities
## 
### BILL BETHKE 
Ky Ebright, coach of California's
IiMS Olympic champion crew, will
visit the Farm tomorrow atternoon
lo confer with Indian crew coach
Ace Clark. They will look over the
Stanford group's rowing facilities
and make final arrangements for
the Cal-Stanford crew race to be
held at the Palo Alto yacht basin in
early May.
What Ebright will see when he
.steps inside the crew's bayside
boathouue at the loot of Embarca
dero Road will be a far cry from
last year's state of affairs. The Cards
have been sweating over equipment
since last July in their effort to pro
vide the best possible training fa
cilities for the winter and spring
season.
Most notable among their proj
ects are a new training barge, a
new 108-1 oot system of clocks, and
complete refinishing of the crew's
Jive shells.
New Barge Built
The new solid oak barge was
built last summer by Coach Clark
and a few crewmen at school dur
ing summer quarter. Holding places
tor ten oarsmen, the big scow more
than doubled the boat space avail
able for training the ambitious ciop
■>112 frosh that turned out early in the
fall.
Riggers and fittings o(T of an old
'al scow were donated last spring
by Coach Ebright, but the remain
der of the parts were ferreted out
by crew members.
To facilitate the taster launching
)f shells and barges, the 60 crewmen
next pitched in to build the new
docks Clark had planned. Work
started late last quarter after Grad
uate Manager Lou Lindsey procured
the needed lumber and balsa floats.
Under the supervision of senior
oarsman Ray Haley, construction of
he five 22-loot floating docks was
completed last Monday.
The new equipment enables the
rew to put two of their 62-foot
•edar shells in the water simulta
neously, eliminating much of the
confusion and wasted time that
nampered practice last year.
Equipment in Top Shape
While most of the oarsmen were
practicing in the barges, building
floats, or painting the boathouse last
I ill. Senior Manager Mort Gollen
der and his aides set to work to put
the racing equipment in top shape.
Preliminary work had already been
done by Jim Smith, who used
his spare time during the summei
to almost completely rebuild the
wrecked Washingtonian, which cap
sized last spring.

When school began last fall, Gol
lender, Norm Swanson, and Boh
Fox supervised the tremendous job
ot scraping and repainting the rig
gers of the five shells,-repairing and
revarnishing them, and installing
new footboards and sliding seats.
The work on the last shell was
completed yesterday.
Launch to Ee Overhauled
The only major project that re
mains unfinished is the overhauling
oi the speedy coaching launch.
Chief Engineer Jim Graham. Dent
Tat't, Jon Hol'oway, Clauc e Wake
field, Dick Fowler, and others have
worked for the past two months re
fitting the motor and the trim hull.
The red and white craft should be
launched Saturday to enable Coach
Clark to supervise his charges next
week when they begin to turn out
every day for their six-mile jaunts.
These projects all lead to a com
mon goal, the crew's success in the
spring conquests. The biggest ob
ective is Ebright's mighty Cal, fresh
from an Olympic win and stiil re
membering a fighting Stanford crew
that gave them a terrific battle last
May in Oakland.
