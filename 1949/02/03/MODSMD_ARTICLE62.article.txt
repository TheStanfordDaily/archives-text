# Skiers Urged Not to Abuse Yosemite Facilities
## 
### 
I here are going to be a lot or
sadder and wiser members of the
Ski Club unles a few "shady prac
tices" are eliminated from the Yo
semite weekends.
According to Don Glass, the Ski
Club is in clanger of losing its spe
cial privileges at Yosemite because
members have been abusing them.
In recent weeks, many members
have forgotten to pay their bills.
When this happens, Yosemite no
tifies the Ski Club, which pays the
bi'ls, and then has to collect from
the members concerned through the
ASSU office. In the future, any
member forgetting to pay his bill
will be fined $2 plus the cost of the
bill. Members who sign up for the
weekend and then don't go will also
be fined.
One of the benefits of belonging
to the Ski Club is the half-price
rate on lift tickets. This privilege
has been badly abused by members
who buy extra tickets for their
friends. In addition, many members
have been borrowing ski cards
when they either lose or forget their
own. These cards are non-transfer
able.

The Curry Company is aware of
these infractions, and if they con

tinue, will stop offering the dis
count as well as other considera
tions. These include free ski lessons

and preference in filling reserva
tions.
Every member of the Ski Clul
wil! suffer if these infractions con
tinue. All members are therefore
asked to be more careful in observ
ing the rules, since most of these
violations are due to carelessnes
or ignorance of the rules them
selves.
