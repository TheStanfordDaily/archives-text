# No Relief in Housing Seen For Off-Campus Students
## 
### TOWNSEND BROWN 
! Off - campus students are faced
j with high rents and no apparent
I possibility of moving into a Uni
' versity residence. Sheldon Beatty,
: Chief Counselor for Men, believes ,
| that there will be no real decrease I
i in the number of students who will !
be forced to live off campus during
! the next few years.
The most recent statistics avail
able at the Dean of Students' office
reveal that 3.08J1 men live in Uni
versity residences (fraternities, Vil
lage, and dormitories), and 3.082
j men live off campus. A Toyon resi- j
dent pays $17 per month for his ■
room, and the Housing Oilice esti- ;
mates that the off-campus students
pay between $25 and $45 a month.
Building Inadequate
Unfortunately the existing pro
gram of building is inadequate to
j meet the needs. Crothers Hall
i houses 63 graduate students. Stern
. Hall is designed to hold 224 under
graduates, and there is no immedi
ate prospect of widespread dormi
| lory building.
The En.-ir" dining hall is now
; within 50 d. .s of being filled to !

I capacity. As yet Stern Hall is un
; finished, and only half of Toyon and
! Crothers eats at Encina. When \
\ Stern Hall is completed, the 130 off
i campus students now eating at En
i cina will be unable to do so. The
situation will then be such that not
even all the men living in Stern,
| Toyon, and Crothers will be able
! to eat there.
Apartments Scarce
Stanford Village, through the
auspices of the Federal Housing
Authority, has been able to offer 300
low-rent ($36-$45) units lor mar
j ried veterans. Three hundred fifty j
; couples are on a waiting list and are
forced to pay between $90 and $135
for a three-room apartment, de
i pending on its distance trom the
campus. In order to be assigned a
Village unit immediately, a couple
would have to have 25 points—i.e.,
tour children.
The Housing Office believes that
rents are coming down. Married
.students, however, will find little
improvement for several years un
less the University should begin a
! housing project.
