BE A WINNER—
OF A BIG STEAK DINNER . . .
. . . like John Forsythe, Jr., who
wins this week's dinner for his ad:
"Ye Olde Sage Says," on another
page in this edition. You ran win,
too. Just write an ad about those
luscious Big Macs and double-thick
shakes. Bring your ad—or mail if
if you prefer—to Johnny Mac's
Drive-In, El Camino south of Five
Points, Redwood City.
