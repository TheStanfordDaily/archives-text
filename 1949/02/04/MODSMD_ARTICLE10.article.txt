# Stanford-CCNY Battle Tops Cow Palace Season
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's ninth-in-the-nation Indians, attempting to add another
item to their satchel full of successful outings, will run into
CCNY's visiting Beavers tonight at 9:30 in the Cow Palace.
USC's Trojans from Los Angeles and the San Francisco Dons
will do battle in the 7:45 first game of what should turn out tc

fbe the top double - barreled pi'o
; gram of the Cow Palace season.
CCNY, coached by the fabulous
and fantastic Nat Holman, and
boasting one of the most colorful,
fastest breaking, and oft - winning
fives in America, wi!l make its firs:
Bay Area appearance in history to
night.
Outstanding Records Showing
Not one, not two, but three of the
! nation's best cage records will be or
: the firing line, as Stanford and USF
j both search for their 18th victory.
while CCNY looks for its 12th. Each
! team has dropped only two games
i Add the Trojans, currently tied
with Stanford for leadership in thi
Southern Division, to the star-stud
s' ded program, and you get the com
plete picture. USC will be after it
eighth win. as the Troys now owi
I a 7-7 record.
Stanford's losses were to Califor
nia and USC. USF dropped the
duke to UCLA and Stanford, while
CCNY missed against Southern
I Methodist and USF.
Should Stanford get by City Col
i the Indians would probably
step up another notch on the ladder
to national prominence, but the
| Beavers are said to be in their best
I shape for this weeeknd, and will
i offer Stanford all it can handle.
Cielbei to Start
Everett Dean will start the same
I lineup against the New Yorkers
: that faced San Jose State last Fri
j day. That means Marv Gelber will
again step up from the guard corps
I to furnish George Yardley a run
: ning mate.
Gelber and Yardley will get the
! first call at the forwards; Captain
j Bill Stephenson, the gent who beat
! San Jose with a last-second trick
! shot, will handle the post; and reg
ulars Dave Davidson and Bob
i "Whip" Lewis will be at the guard
spots.
Gelber, who started his cage ca
reer on the foreign New York hard
woods, is expected to be at his best
against his old cronies from the met
ropolitan area. Marv should look
very much at home with his two
handed shooting, fancy footwork,
and strictly Eastern assortment oi
; fakes and feints.

George Rolling Again

I Blond George Yardley should also
I roll again tonight. Having had a
1 great time with the adding machine
of late, George leads all Stanford
i scoring with 259 points in 19 games
; ior a 13.6 average. In his last four
i efforts, the Birdman has junked in
77 digits for an impressive 19 per.
Everett Dean fears the CCNY fast
break, which he says will be the i
fastest-moving offense seen in these :
oarts this season. He has stated that
he will warn his own men about I
trying to match swift with the Bea- J
vers, as teams trying to outspeed j
New York usually end up second j
best.
Irwin Damdrot, G-4, tallest man '
on the starting five and highest j
CCNY scorer with 148 points in 13 I
tries, leads the New York attack. |
But it is Sonny Jameson who really ;
supp'ies the get-up-and-go. Jame- j
son has been tabbed as owner of a I
pair of the fleetest feet in the game '
today.
Damdrot Leads CCNY
Damdrot and Jameson, with (
scrapper Hilty Shapiro thrown in, j
have romped over opponents to run j
up a high-powered 68.fi points per
game, which is moving the ball in
any league.
To combat that rapid run of the
scoreboard. Dean will use his regu
lar man-to-man defense, but will !
definitely warn his men against i
running with the Beavers—to do so
woukl be playing right into Nat
Holman's hands.
In keeping pace with New York, ,
Dean will have to use his reserve
power to the fullest extent. Bill
Rose, a sharp passing and deadly 1
shooting forward, will be seeing i
early action.
Also ready for an early call is '
Gus Chavalas, whose speed will j
come in handy against New York.
Other Indians who should get into
the thick of things include forwards i
Milt Iverson and Bill Lewis, center
Ralph Carver, and perhaps utility
man Gay Bryan.

oarts this season. He has stated that
he will warn his own men about I
trying to match swift with the Bea- J
vers, as teams trying to outspeed j
New York usually end up second j
best.
Irwin Damdrot, G-4, tallest man '
on the starting five and highest j
CCNY scorer with 148 points in 13 I
tries, leads the New York attack. |
But it is Sonny Jameson who really ;
supp'ies the get-up-and-go. Jame- j
son has been tabbed as owner of a I
pair of the fleetest feet in the game '
today.
Damdrot Leads CCNY
Damdrot and Jameson, with (
scrapper Hilty Shapiro thrown in, j
have romped over opponents to run j
up a high-powered 68.fi points per
game, which is moving the ball in
any league.
To combat that rapid run of the
scoreboard. Dean will use his regu
lar man-to-man defense, but will !
definitely warn his men against i
running with the Beavers—to do so
woukl be playing right into Nat
Holman's hands.
In keeping pace with New York, ,
Dean will have to use his reserve
power to the fullest extent. Bill
Rose, a sharp passing and deadly 1
shooting forward, will be seeing i
early action.
Also ready for an early call is '
Gus Chavalas, whose speed will j
come in handy against New York.
Other Indians who should get into
the thick of things include forwards i
Milt Iverson and Bill Lewis, center
Ralph Carver, and perhaps utility

CCNY missed against Southern
I Methodist and USF.
Should Stanford get by City Col
i the Indians would probably
step up another notch on the ladder
to national prominence, but the
| Beavers are said to be in their best
I shape for this weeeknd, and will
i offer Stanford all it can handle.
Cielbei to Start
Everett Dean will start the same
I lineup against the New Yorkers
: that faced San Jose State last Fri
j day. That means Marv Gelber will
again step up from the guard corps
I to furnish George Yardley a run
: ning mate.
Gelber and Yardley will get the
! first call at the forwards; Captain
j Bill Stephenson, the gent who beat
! San Jose with a last-second trick
! shot, will handle the post; and reg
ulars Dave Davidson and Bob
i "Whip" Lewis will be at the guard
spots.
Gelber, who started his cage ca
reer on the foreign New York hard
woods, is expected to be at his best
against his old cronies from the met
ropolitan area. Marv should look
very much at home with his two
handed shooting, fancy footwork,
and strictly Eastern assortment oi
; fakes and feints.

George Rolling Again

I Blond George Yardley should also
I roll again tonight. Having had a
1 great time with the adding machine
of late, George leads all Stanford
i scoring with 259 points in 19 games
; ior a 13.6 average. In his last four
i efforts, the Birdman has junked in
77 digits for an impressive 19 per.
Everett Dean fears the CCNY fast
break, which he says will be the i
fastest-moving offense seen in these :
oarts this season. He has stated that
he will warn his own men about I
trying to match swift with the Bea- J
vers, as teams trying to outspeed j
New York usually end up second j
best.
Irwin Damdrot, G-4, tallest man '
on the starting five and highest j
CCNY scorer with 148 points in 13 I
tries, leads the New York attack. |
But it is Sonny Jameson who really ;
supp'ies the get-up-and-go. Jame- j
son has been tabbed as owner of a I
pair of the fleetest feet in the game '
today.
Damdrot Leads CCNY
Damdrot and Jameson, with (
scrapper Hilty Shapiro thrown in, j
have romped over opponents to run j
up a high-powered 68.fi points per
game, which is moving the ball in
any league.
To combat that rapid run of the
scoreboard. Dean will use his regu
lar man-to-man defense, but will !
definitely warn his men against i
running with the Beavers—to do so
woukl be playing right into Nat
Holman's hands.
In keeping pace with New York, ,
Dean will have to use his reserve
power to the fullest extent. Bill
Rose, a sharp passing and deadly 1
shooting forward, will be seeing i
early action.
Also ready for an early call is '
Gus Chavalas, whose speed will j
come in handy against New York.
Other Indians who should get into
the thick of things include forwards i
Milt Iverson and Bill Lewis, center
Ralph Carver, and perhaps utility
man Gay Bryan.
