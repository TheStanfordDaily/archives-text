## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3 </P). —
President Truman said positive v
today that this government won't
spurn the United Nations for sepa
rate talks with Russia 01 any other
country.
Mr. Truman told a news confer
ence that Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's detailed rejection of
Prime Minister Stalin's indirect
"peace" talk offer had his lull en
dorsement.
Asked it this nation would meet
with other powers outside the UN,
Mr. Truman replied flatly that it
would not.
The questions about Stalin and
Russia came thick and fast. They
were prompted by Stalin's offer—in
reply to a newspaperman's written
questions— to meet the President in
Russia, Poland, or Czechoslovakia.
Mr. Truman recalled that he had
Liven the Soviet Premier an invi

tation to Washington at the Pots
dam conference. He said he is will
ing to see him here any time.
But he made it clear that there
would be no ignoring the United
Nations in any discussion that
might result from such a meeting
here.
He was asked about Acheron's
analysis of the Stalin interv'cw in
which the Secretary of Stato em
phasized we would not talk with
Russia about matters concerning
other nations. Mr. Truman said he
thought that the Stalin statements
were completely and fairly an
swered by Acheson and that no fur
ther statement is needed.
What if Stalin would be willing
to come as far as Alaska? Mr. Tru
man's answer was lost in the laugh
ter.
"Did you say Nome?" the report
er asked. Mr. Truman chuckled

and said he didn't answer.
lo a woman reporter's query, Mr.
Truman said that il Stalin comes
here he would have Mrs. Truman
get the guest room in Blair House
ready for him.
Other news conference develop
ments:
1. The President said General
Lucius Clay would remain in con
trol of American military govern
ment in Germany.
This was prompted by a question
whether he planned to transfer
control of administration in the
American zone to the State Depart
ment. The Army is known to have
made an urgent request lor the;
change.
2. Mr. Truman hopes that no
agencies of the government are ex
empted from reorganization author
ity which he has asked of Congress.
A reporter told him there were

moves on loot to write a hands-off
order into the pending bill to pre
vent his dealing with the Interstate
Commerce Commission, the Federal
Trade Commission, and other bu
reaus. Mr. Truman seeks the au
thority to make reorganizations
throughout the executive depart
ments as he sees fit. 'Ihey would be
effective unless Congress vetoes his
orders.
