# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Closing Statement 
### 
I made one serious error in my statement of policy at the be
ginning of the volume. I said that there weren't enough local
problems to write an editorial about every day, that The Daily
should contain editorials on national issues. It turned out that
there are a lot of problems right on the Campus deserving of
editorial comment, plus national issues common to all college
students.
As much as possible The Daily tried to point out those problems
and to suggest ways of solving them.
In the news field I wanted the Campus to come first, and the
staff covered it rather well. Top national and world news was
given space when available. But in the main, as a community
newspaper, The Daily gave preference to Campus news and the
promotion of Campus affairs. That is the best policy to follow
I believe.
I was surprised two weeks ago to receive a visitor who com
plained bitterly that a person had to know someone on The Daily
staff to get a story in the paper. I convinced him that he was be- J
hind the time, that if The Daily reporter didn't come around, to
telephone the story or visit the Shack; news is always welcome.
In short, that is all the policy I believe The Daily should have:
to stand up for clean, democratic student government, to promote
worthy campus affairs, and to try hard to give every organization
a break in reporting their activities. The editor's door should al
ways be open. The Daily, like all newspapers, is a quasi-public
institution.
I have been well satisfied with the paper this year. The staff
was loyal and hard working. They had initiative and imagination.
The quality of the paper improved from day to day, and was
limited only the amount of direction that the editorial board could
give and still stay in school.
The cooperation of student leaders, faculty, and administration
made a tough job easier.
In my volume I didn't do all the things I planned. But I know
the really grand staff of Volume 115 will accomplish a lot of
ihem.
Above all, it is a real pleasure to turn the office over to Lorry
lokey, an "old Stanford" man. I know that he has the ability to
lead another splendid Daily volume, 112 know also that he has the
confidence of the Farm Family as well as the staff. I know that
Stanford is dear to his heart and that he'll report and interpret
the Farm and it's problems accurately and fairly.
Sincerely,
TOM SELF.

made a tough job easier.
In my volume I didn't do all the things I planned. But I know
the really grand staff of Volume 115 will accomplish a lot of
ihem.
Above all, it is a real pleasure to turn the office over to Lorry
lokey, an "old Stanford" man. I know that he has the ability to
lead another splendid Daily volume, 112 know also that he has the
confidence of the Farm Family as well as the staff. I know that
Stanford is dear to his heart and that he'll report and interpret
the Farm and it's problems accurately and fairly.

I made one serious error in my statement of policy at the be
ginning of the volume. I said that there weren't enough local
problems to write an editorial about every day, that The Daily
should contain editorials on national issues. It turned out that
there are a lot of problems right on the Campus deserving of
editorial comment, plus national issues common to all college
students.
As much as possible The Daily tried to point out those problems
and to suggest ways of solving them.
In the news field I wanted the Campus to come first, and the
staff covered it rather well. Top national and world news was
given space when available. But in the main, as a community
newspaper, The Daily gave preference to Campus news and the
promotion of Campus affairs. That is the best policy to follow
I believe.
I was surprised two weeks ago to receive a visitor who com
plained bitterly that a person had to know someone on The Daily
staff to get a story in the paper. I convinced him that he was be- J
hind the time, that if The Daily reporter didn't come around, to
telephone the story or visit the Shack; news is always welcome.
In short, that is all the policy I believe The Daily should have:
to stand up for clean, democratic student government, to promote
worthy campus affairs, and to try hard to give every organization
a break in reporting their activities. The editor's door should al
ways be open. The Daily, like all newspapers, is a quasi-public
institution.
I have been well satisfied with the paper this year. The staff
was loyal and hard working. They had initiative and imagination.
The quality of the paper improved from day to day, and was
limited only the amount of direction that the editorial board could
give and still stay in school.
The cooperation of student leaders, faculty, and administration
made a tough job easier.
In my volume I didn't do all the things I planned. But I know
the really grand staff of Volume 115 will accomplish a lot of
ihem.
