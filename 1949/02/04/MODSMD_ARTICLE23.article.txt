Two problems that should come up for editorial comment in
ihese columns in the near future are the Scholarship program and
■he architectural style of new buildings.
On the scholarship program, one group wants to continue the
112 oreign Scholarship Program. Another group stresses the need
of increased aid to Stanford students. The crux of the question
seems to be that the FSP must be continued—at least in reduced
-Orm. The reason is that there are so many more universities
ready to follow Stanford's lead, universities with a greater surplus
- n their student body funds. These universities will be largely
.influenced by Stanford's action. Probably a compromise will
have to be reached.
The problems of architecture is more serious than might be
apparent at first. Alumni opposition to the trend of Stanford
architecture, as exemplified in the Lucie Stern Residence Hall
now under construction, has manifested itself in a deluge of let
ters to the Administration and the Alumni Review and in dis
cussions wherever alumni have gathered.
Alumni objection to the Stern dormitory has centered on the
ilat roofs. It is generally agreed that the building is a praise
worthy example of modern architectural design, but that it does
not fit in with the "timeless quality" of Stanford's original archi
.ecture. Red-tile roofs and buff walls have always been the
identifying features of Stanford buildings.
The Union Planning Committee of Excom stated in its first re
port that it favors the traditional Stanford architecture for the
union which is to be built as a memorial to Donald B. Tresidder,
.'ate president of the University.
