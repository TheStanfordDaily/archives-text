# Falsies Hold '49 Plunging Necklines
## 
### 
NEW YORK (J-1 J ).—The plunging
necklines of 1949 have posed a
pretty problem for figure conscious
gals.
How. they inquire anxiously, can
you wear a bra with a dress whose
neck'ine is cut down to the belt?
They needn't worry, however.
Two glorifiers of the American bust,
Ruth Merzon and Ruth Fisk, have
come up with an answer. The
sprightly ladies who have been
supplying "falsies" to many of the
flat-chested females of the U.S. for
many years now are tackling the
problem of the revealing neckline
with all the scientific zeal of master
engineers.
Says Mrs. Merzon modestly:
"I think we have everything un
der control. For the low, scoop
neckline which comes almost to the
point of the bust we have the half
bra, with a little band of net across
the top to make everything secure.
It is wired, strapless, and built up
from beneath to give that curve
that is so important with the new
necklines. Any girl may wear it
without fear of a slip."
For the plunging neckline which
is slit to the waist, Mrs. Merzon
also has an answer. It is a long
line strapless bra, also slit to the
waistband, boned and wired to hold
it in place. Says she:
"This is a type of bra that was
worn many years ago: we made it
then, and we can make it again.
Since the accent this year is upon
a beautiful bosom, women must not
make the mistake of wearing the
new low - neckline styles without
bras. There is a type of support
suitable to every neckline."
For the strapless evening gowns
and sun dresses of the season, the
strapless bra is, of course, the an
swer. Newest production of the
Merzon-Fisk team is a bra made
like two discs of padded satin, laced
together by a narrow ribbon in
front and elastic with adjustable
laces in back. It is, of course, wired
to hold it in place. Says Miss Fisk
enthusiastically:
"Why, a girl can even play ten

nis in one of these and have every
thing under control. We do not be
lieve in separate pads in bras. They
are too likely to slip out of place.
After all, it is very embarrassing
for a girl to realize suddenly that
her bust pad has slipped up to her

shoulder blade."
Mrs. Merzon and Miss Fisk can
pul "falsies" in almost any article
of clothing. They specialize in
glamorizing bathing suits. They
also apply "gay deceivers," as they
call them, to evening gowns, negli
gees. and even nightgowns.

NEW YORK (J-1 J ).—The plunging
necklines of 1949 have posed a
pretty problem for figure conscious
gals.
How. they inquire anxiously, can
you wear a bra with a dress whose
neck'ine is cut down to the belt?
They needn't worry, however.
Two glorifiers of the American bust,
Ruth Merzon and Ruth Fisk, have
come up with an answer. The
sprightly ladies who have been
supplying "falsies" to many of the
flat-chested females of the U.S. for
many years now are tackling the
problem of the revealing neckline
with all the scientific zeal of master
engineers.
Says Mrs. Merzon modestly:
"I think we have everything un
der control. For the low, scoop
neckline which comes almost to the
point of the bust we have the half
bra, with a little band of net across
the top to make everything secure.
It is wired, strapless, and built up
from beneath to give that curve
that is so important with the new
necklines. Any girl may wear it
without fear of a slip."
For the plunging neckline which
is slit to the waist, Mrs. Merzon
also has an answer. It is a long
line strapless bra, also slit to the
waistband, boned and wired to hold
it in place. Says she:
"This is a type of bra that was
worn many years ago: we made it
then, and we can make it again.
Since the accent this year is upon
a beautiful bosom, women must not
make the mistake of wearing the
new low - neckline styles without
bras. There is a type of support
suitable to every neckline."
For the strapless evening gowns
and sun dresses of the season, the
strapless bra is, of course, the an
swer. Newest production of the
Merzon-Fisk team is a bra made
like two discs of padded satin, laced
together by a narrow ribbon in
front and elastic with adjustable
laces in back. It is, of course, wired
to hold it in place. Says Miss Fisk
enthusiastically:
"Why, a girl can even play ten

nis in one of these and have every
thing under control. We do not be
lieve in separate pads in bras. They
are too likely to slip out of place.
After all, it is very embarrassing
for a girl to realize suddenly that
her bust pad has slipped up to her

shoulder blade."
Mrs. Merzon and Miss Fisk can
pul "falsies" in almost any article
of clothing. They specialize in
glamorizing bathing suits. They
also apply "gay deceivers," as they
call them, to evening gowns, negli
gees. and even nightgowns.
