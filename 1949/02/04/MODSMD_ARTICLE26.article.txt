## Bull Session 
### 
"Huzzah! I shouted into the phone as I recognized the rasping voice.
"Can this really be you. Tom, old man?"
(Pause)
"But, Tom, I can't write a Bull Session for your last edition of Volume

114. You know I didn't write my own copy, and now
that Eob Loeffelbein is paying my writers more
money
(Pause)
"All ri-jht, so I admit I had my mother write that
letter to The Daily. But what can I use for a subject
for this Bull Session?"
(Pause)
What s thatA Bull Session about the best movies,
best plays, ana best songs of 15)48? Aw, that sounds
lousy."

(Pause)
"But, Tom, I haven't got that five bucks I owe you! What can I say?"
"Yes,' I said simply. (And Max Schulman's publishers sued me for
plagiarism.)

After spending the past year sneaking into theaters by walking in back
wards (to make the ushers think I was coming' out), I am now prepared to
present the Bull Session awards for the best movies, songs, and staae
plays of 1949.
Best Play of the Year: "A Streetcar Named Desire," or "It's a Wise Man
Who Knows His Own Father."
Best Revival Movies of the Year: "My Brother Who Talks With Horses."
Many of you probably thought this was a new picture. The truth is that
il s a revival of an old story by Sam Goldwyn's brother entitled: "My
Bi other Who Horses With Talkies."
Most Gory Murder Film: That movie about the hatchet murders, "I Dis
membered Mama."
Best Mystery of the Year: "Warren Wonka" (or "Let's Hear Your
Explanation of This Gag.")
The Musical With the Best Potential and Worst Results: "Words and
Music," starring Mickey (I was voted most likely to be obnoxious) Rooney,
the cigar that walks like a man.
Best Supporting Role of the Year: Perma-Lift Corset Company.
Best Excuse for Birth Control: "A Song Is Born." Or. "Another one
like this. Danny Kaye, and you'll be working for Monogram!"
Best Movie Song of the Year: "Buttons and Bows." I don't think, how
ever, that "Buttons and Bows" was the right number for Bob Hope to
sing to Jane Russell in "The Paleface." Everything considered, a more
appropriate selection would have been "Thanks for the Mamillaries."
Sexiest Actress on the Screen: Margaret O'Brien. Gawd, but that kid
is sexy!
BULL SESSION RECOMMENDS—
1. For Dogs: "Another Part of the Forest."
2. For Alcoholics: "Walk a Crooked Mile."
For Dailey: Another long vacation.

Best Excuse for Birth Control: "A Song Is Born." Or. "Another one
like this. Danny Kaye, and you'll be working for Monogram!"
Best Movie Song of the Year: "Buttons and Bows." I don't think, how
ever, that "Buttons and Bows" was the right number for Bob Hope to

After spending the past year sneaking into theaters by walking in back
wards (to make the ushers think I was coming' out), I am now prepared to
present the Bull Session awards for the best movies, songs, and staae
plays of 1949.
Best Play of the Year: "A Streetcar Named Desire," or "It's a Wise Man
Who Knows His Own Father."
