## Are Fraternity Men Dumb? Low Row Grade Average Explained 
### 
Are fraternity men dumb?
Io attempt a .simple affirmative or negative answer
to a question of this nature would be to overgeneralize
the matter. All the same, there is considerable talk
these days—and much ol it is not confined to students
concerned—about the intelligence of the average Stan
ford fraternity man.
Statistics sheets indicate that Row men just don't
have the "pipes" to maintain the grade averages held
by dormitory. Village, and off-campus men. Nor is
the situation improving. In the fall of 1947 fraternities
maintained a 2.43 grade average as against an all
men's average of 2.52. Last quarter the fraternity
aver fell to 2.38 while the all-men's average was
boosted to 2.5G.
Each new testimony of Row men's ignorance is
greeted with hair-tearing on the part of resident ad
visers, impassioned pleas by house presidents, fines
for rough-housing after 7 in the evening, and gloomy
discussions at Board meetings. Results are still the
same. More than one person has offered to explain
the situation by merely pointing out that fraternity
men are naturally dumb.
Not Just Locally
And so it is in all parts of the country. Of the 35
largest national fraternities, only one. Beta Thota Pi.
has at present a national grade average that stands
above the national all-men's average. Supporters of
the "fraternity men are stupid" theory appear to have
strong basis for their arguments.
In truth, however, their arguments do not hold
water.
Proof lies first in college aptitude and general in
telligence tests where fraternity men hold scores that
give ample evidence of their natural intelligence. One
of the University's strongest boasts is its refusal to ac
cept Mortimer Snerds for study at Stanford in the
first place. Hordes of top-notch athletes have been
denied admittance because of low grades.
Obviously, fraternity men are not dumb. What they
lack is not an abundance of gray matter, but the
proper study habits and living conditions conducive
to heavy study.
Consider the following' points:
(•cncral Extroverts
1. Men who live in fraternities are generally classi
fied as extroverts. Freshmen without sports page pub
licity or political prominence are taken into frater

! nities largely because of good first impressions made
I or friendships with men already living in. The result is
a large section of "party boys" who predominate at
El Camino night spots on week nights and arrange
j for regular weekend parties.
2. Fraternity brothers who live together in the same
house for a three-year period inevitably become fast
friends with several dozen men who live only a few
; doors away. Bull sessions, movies, and "quick" trips to
j Dinah s arc all too easily arranged. Spontaneous bed-
I lam goes without saying.
Time To Fraternity
?>. National fraternities are more than mere boarding
houses. Social functions, house maintenance, and fre
quent meetings are demanding of spare time. For
i many men two weeks of open rushing are two weeks
of studies lost to open houses and the formation of
a satisfactory pledge class.
These and additional minor considerations are the
reasons that many fraternity men never develop the
study habits to enable them to maintain grade averages
equal to other members of the student body.
University authorities have long been concerned
with the scholastic problem in Row houses, but their
corective policy, consistently in line with their belief
in student academic freedom, has been one in which
men as individuals are asked to realize their own
■ responsibilities.
Fraternity Committees
Fraternities as a whole have established a schol-
I arship committee which studies fraternity academic
problems; houses with grade averages below the all
men's average may not permit men on probation or
pledges who are minus to live in the house.
Fraternities individually improve living' conditions
by passing stringent quiet hour regulations and by
| special help for borderline students.
In the last analysis, however, the old adage about
leading a horse to water is perfectly applicable to the
fraternity scholarship problem. Individual sense of
responsibility, and that alone, offers the final solution.
Problem of Forbearance
Until the fraternity man learns to forego movies,
and a three-hour bull session, and a 10 o'clock beer,
and a Wednesday night poker game, a fraternity na
tional headquarters, Interfraternity Board, and various
j and sundry interested persons will continue to besiege
house presidents with stern lectures and grade aver-
I ages bordered in black.
