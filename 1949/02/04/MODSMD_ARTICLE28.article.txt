# 'Uke' Revival Recalls Flapper Age
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
Dapper roughs and flapper co-eds
have stepped back a bit into the
good old days, and they're carry -
' ing a ukulele along.
, The sudden craze to play the
"uke has caused Paly businessmen
to stare in amazement as their sales
soar up as much as 400 per cent.
. Nobody can imagine what started
, it . . . maybe a radio program.
Stinlord students buy everything
from $4.50 to $35 instruments. "Mar
tin 'ukes' sell as fast as we can get
I them in stock," exclaimed a sales
eirl at one of the local music shops.
Some stores carry a Hawaiian-
I made "uke"' called monkey - pod.
] but Martin's are the most popular.
Booklets Boost Sales
Instruction booklets with encour
aging titles like "Five Minutes and
You Too Can Play the Uke'' can be
found in almost any dorm. Girls at
Lagunita even plunk softly under
the table at meals.
Men s residences also have re
sponded t.o the music makin'. There's
a uke twanging somewhere from
the time an alarm clock jingles a
rough to the deck until the lights
dim in Hoover Tower.
Last j'ear at Roble only one girl
from the islands and one beachrat
from Southern California owned a
ukulele. This year every corridor
in most women's living groups
boasts new musicians.
Hawaiians Don't Know lln*,v
Most people on campus from the
Hawaiian Islands, however, can't
even play the uke, according to stu
dents in Row houses. But the body
surfers from Southern Cal, who have
just about lost their summer tans,
can play and usually do.
They say it all started last sum
mer nt San Diego, Balboa, and San
Onefre—somewhere in between. It
began at beach parties, weinie
roasts, and days ofT from summer
vacation jobs.
Makes I'a, Ma Nostalgic
After vacation the ukes were
packed into the Buicks and Fords ;
that wind up the coast route by the
hundreds in September. Lots more
were brought up after Christmas
vacation, and now the hogan
twangers are all over the place.
Lots of mothers and fathers
smiled to see ukuleles around the
house again—"ukes" in the 1920's
were as prevalent as flag - pole
squatters and turkey-trotters.
It must be the trend of the times
—back with the Charleston, down
with the hemline, tune up the uku
leles!
