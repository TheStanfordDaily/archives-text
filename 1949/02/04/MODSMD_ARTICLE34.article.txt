three in a row tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 when the ruggers face
a powerful Olympic Club fifteen on the local field. The Indians
chalked up a 10 to 8 victory over the Clubmen three weeks ago

n a practice game, but the Cards
had to come, from behind to turn
ihe trick.
Both teams have perfect records
.n Northern California Rugby Un
ion play, the Clubmen emerging
victorious over Menlo and Petaluma
>vhile the Cards have turned back
Petaluma (13-0) and the Univer
sity Club (11-0).

top-flight talent, including kicking
specialist Eel Welch, ex-Cal gridder,
-md former Stanfordites Ted Nell,
Dave Brown, Fred Willy, and Dick
Flatland.
In their practice game with the
Indians the Clubmen displayed a ;
:ast - moving attack which sprang j
the backs loose on numerous occa- j
sions. However, Ihe Indians' de- |
fense has greatly improved since •
then as indicated by their white- ;
wash wins over Petaluma and the
University Club.
The lineup for tomorrow's game j
will be essentially the same one '
which has carried the ruggers to j
three consecutive victories with j
two possible exceptions. Pete Peck
ham may start at third half instead ;
of Dick Hughes, who is suffering |
from a charlie horse. Peckham has j
looked good in practice this week i

and will be a capable replacement
