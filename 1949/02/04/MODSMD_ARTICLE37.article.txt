# Indian Wrestlers Tangle With Cal Poly 'Toughies'
## 
### WIN DANSTON 
Stanford's wandering wrestlers return to the Farm for their
first home match of the season when they meet Cal Poly in the
Pavilion at 8 tonight.
The Indian grapplers will enter the contest as underdogs to the
powerful sguad from the south. Cal Poly holds an 18 to 16 victory

♦■over San Jose State, probably the
best wrestling team in the Bay
Area, and Stanford will be weak
ened with Roy Gaskin, regular 1 Im
pounder, out with a shoulder sepa
ration.
Poly Favored
Although Cal Poly is favored, the
Indian squad has been improving
with each match and the dual meet
tonight could provide some lire
works. In the 121 Dick Esbenshadc
will lead of! for the Cards against
Dick Hutchinson of Cal Poly.
Weber Lawson, Cal Po'.y's out
standing wrestler, should beat Dick
Cruce in the 128 - pound match.
Lawson has not been defeated this
season. Don Williams, fast-iimprov-
I ing Indian 136-pounder, will oppose
Montgomery in the third match of
the evening. Williams has shown
good form in early matches anc 1
should take Montgomery.
Vern Jones, Indian captain
should have no trouble with How
ard Tillotson in the 145 - pound
match. Jones has not been beaten
this year, and he easily decisionea
Wardrup, who edged Tillotson.
The 155 is strictly a puzzler. Dai
Winston will oppose Jim Dowe ot
Cal Poly. Winston holds a decision
j over Jordan of San Jose, while
Dowe won over the Spartan by de
fault when Jordan was injured.
The 165-pound match is also a
question mark. Jim Kurfess will
represent the Indians against Fred
Adams. Both Kurfess and Adams
have dropped decisions to Waxham
of San Jose by similar scores so the
match should be close.
DcWitt at 175
Dick DeWitt will wrestle for the
first time on the Indian varsity in
the 175-pound class against A 1 Ca
i dena. Cadena won a decision last
week over Pat Falice, San Jose 175-
pound wrestler. Falice is one of the
top 175-pound grapplers in the Bay
Area, so Cadena should have an
edge on DeWitt.
In the final match of the eve
ning Jack White returns to the Card
lineup in the heavyweight post to
meet either Bob Thenson or Jack
Darling. White has not met any
j opponent that the Cal Poly wres
tiers have so there is no basis t<
make a prediction as to the out
come ot the match.
