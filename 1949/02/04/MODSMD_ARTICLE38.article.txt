# Card Sluggers Trade Blows With Expperienced Bruins
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The outstanding local boxing card of the year will be presented
at the Pavilion tomorrow night at 8, when UCLA's slugging Bruins
.nvade the Farm to meet Ray Lunny's varsity mittmen.
The Westwooders will carry one of the finest team records on
the Coast into the ring against the Lunnymen, and currently rank
as favorites to cop the PCC title. ♦

But Lunny's relatively inexperi- j
i need crew has made an impressive |
showing in its first two intercolle- j
'-iate matches of the season and can
be expected to provide the south- !
l i ners with a very rough evening j
indeed.
Headlining the stellar 10- bout !
program is the heavyweight feature
1 (.'tween Stanford's Mike Pelsinger
and Bruin Bob Edwards, both for
mer junior college stars now fight
ing in their first season for their I
respective schools. This one should j
l.e a crowd-pleaser; for both lads
are big, fast, and hard-punching.
Jarring Jim Hammond, whose ex
p isive left hook has been spread
ing destruction in its wake all year, ;
will square off against UCLA's Les
Goodman in the number one light—
Heavy battle of the evening. Ham
iond is the heaviest hitter on the
idian squad, and his blasting fac
es have already brought him a
nace of victories in his only per
irmances to date.
Another bout that is drawing ■
lore than its share of spectator in- j
■rest is the 165 - pound slugfest,
hich will match Fancy Fred Ten
yck against Don Hubbard ol' the
■ruins. Fred will be making his
rst appearance of the season be
ne the local fight following, but
is undefeated record of 1948 at
sts to his capabilities within the
quared circle.
Willie Altus, who has been
nunching for Lunny for three years
it the 155-pound post, will be seek- |
.n? his third straight win of the I
ear against Irwin Thompson, vet
el an UCLA pounder: Alan Ander
son will shoulder Lunny's 145-
pound hopes; Max Money and Jay
Savage will see action at 135
pounds; and Card 130 - pounc"e:
Bob Baker will ring up the curtain
on the stellar show when he meets
Chuck Stenonce in the first battle
>i the evening.
Frankie Brown will be the third
n n in the ring; Jack Rice and
ern Bybee will be counting the
•joints from the ringside; and Harry
'olley will serve as timekeeper.

showing in its first two intercolle- j
'-iate matches of the season and can
be expected to provide the south- !
l i ners with a very rough evening j
indeed.
Headlining the stellar 10- bout !
program is the heavyweight feature
1 (.'tween Stanford's Mike Pelsinger
and Bruin Bob Edwards, both for
mer junior college stars now fight
ing in their first season for their I
respective schools. This one should j
l.e a crowd-pleaser; for both lads
are big, fast, and hard-punching.
Jarring Jim Hammond, whose ex
p isive left hook has been spread
ing destruction in its wake all year, ;
will square off against UCLA's Les
Goodman in the number one light—
Heavy battle of the evening. Ham
iond is the heaviest hitter on the
idian squad, and his blasting fac
es have already brought him a
nace of victories in his only per
irmances to date.
Another bout that is drawing ■
lore than its share of spectator in- j
■rest is the 165 - pound slugfest,
hich will match Fancy Fred Ten
yck against Don Hubbard ol' the
■ruins. Fred will be making his
rst appearance of the season be
ne the local fight following, but
is undefeated record of 1948 at
sts to his capabilities within the
quared circle.
Willie Altus, who has been
nunching for Lunny for three years
it the 155-pound post, will be seek- |
.n? his third straight win of the I
ear against Irwin Thompson, vet
el an UCLA pounder: Alan Ander
son will shoulder Lunny's 145-
pound hopes; Max Money and Jay
Savage will see action at 135
pounds; and Card 130 - pounc"e:
Bob Baker will ring up the curtain
on the stellar show when he meets
Chuck Stenonce in the first battle
>i the evening.
Frankie Brown will be the third
n n in the ring; Jack Rice and
ern Bybee will be counting the
•joints from the ringside; and Harry
'olley will serve as timekeeper.
The outstanding local boxing card of the year will be presented
at the Pavilion tomorrow night at 8, when UCLA's slugging Bruins
.nvade the Farm to meet Ray Lunny's varsity mittmen.
The Westwooders will carry one of the finest team records on
the Coast into the ring against the Lunnymen, and currently rank
as favorites to cop the PCC title. ♦

But Lunny's relatively inexperi- j
i need crew has made an impressive |
showing in its first two intercolle- j
'-iate matches of the season and can
