# Health Insurance Society Founded by Dr. Wilbur
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, chancel- i
lor of Stanford University, was
never seriously accused of support
ing socialistic doctrine, but, accord
ing to an article in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, the American Med
ical Association back in 1939 wasn't
too sure just what his views on so
cialism were.
That was the year that Dr. Wil
buv, with the help of the California
Medical Association, founded the
California Physicians' Service, a
voluntary health insurance organi
zation.
Today, as the tenth anniversary
of the founding of the CPS draws
near, the same American Medical
Association is hailing such planning
as free economy's answer to state
controlled medicine.
In explaining the idea back of
the California Physicians' Service.
Dr. Wilbur said: "Since only a small
percentage of people are sick at any
one time, care can be provided on
the insurance principle of a plan
such as the CPS. In this way the
many take care of the few by pro
tecting all."
Some 5,000,000 Californians now
benefit by some sort of voluntary
prepaid health care.
The whole idea was first con
ceived in 1927, and Dr. Wilbur,
then president of Stanford and Sec
retary of tbe Interior, agreed to
head a survey on medical costs. The
results indicated that some type of
widespread low-cost medical care
should be made available to the
public.
Finally, in 1938. the California
Medical Association was sufficiently
so'c'l on the ic'ea to sponsor the CPS.
"The AMA was not in agreement at
the time, but like all professional
bodies, it is a conservative group."
said Dr. Wilbur. "We in California
just moved a little faster than the
rest."


DR. KAY LYMAN WILBUR founded the California Physicians' Service,
a voluntary health insurance organization now being hailed as free
economy's answer («» state-controlled medicine.
