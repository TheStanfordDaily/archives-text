Dr. William Spurr, Stanford pro
fessor of statistics, forecast that
California's population would reach
14,000.000 in 1900. Today the popu
lation of the state is 10.000,000.
In a monograph, "Forecasts oi
California's Population and Produc
tion, 1950-60," Professor Spurr pre
dicted that the production' of the
state will increase by nearly 50 per
cent between 1948 and 1960.
He estimated that net migration
into Calil'orni will average 265,000
a year during the 19505. This figure
exceeds the previous high average of
261,000 a year, which was marked up
during the 19405.
