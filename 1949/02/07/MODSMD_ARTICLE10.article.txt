# Red-Hot CCNY Hoopsters Swamp Stanford Five, 67-57
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's flimsy road to national
greatness was washed out last Fri
day night as Nat Holman's CCNY
cagers eagerly furnished the down
pour.
Any hopes for a top national rank
were shattered by the determined
<jang of Metropolitan New York
sharpies who outran, outsmarted,
i and outplayed Stanford's relaxing
basketballers to ring up a G7 to 57
victory in the Cow Palace.
CCNY used blazing speed and a
deadly long-shot game to blast the
| Cards by more of a convincing mar
-1 gin than the final score actually in
i dicated. Friday night it appeared
| as if the visitors from New York
were just out of the class of local
quintets.
But when USF's hustling Dons
ran past CCNY in a 48 to 32 land
! slide the following night on the
I same floor, question was immedi
: ateiy raised as to just how bad
Stanford had been on Friday night,
i Reason for th*j»*iiebate w<>s Stan
| ford's recent 10 - point, 65 -55 win
, over USF.
Stanford Cold, CCNY Hot
Friday night's disaster seemed to
I be a case of Stanford, having a bad

StaCKfc

j night, meeting CCNY which was 1
I red-hot and couldn't miss.
But it shouldn't have been that I
bad. At least, that's what the 10,124 |
! fans who braved the rain, the Bay- j
| shore car t rap, and the muddy I
parking lots finally concluded.
Stanford was dead. The Card of- j
fense was bottled up by the rough j
Beaver tactics, and Dean's defense j
was riddled by New York's sharp 1
and tricky passing, as well as the !
| phenomenal shooting.
, Hilty Shapiro, NY captain, gave
; the fans a good show, as a tout»h
guy knew what he was doing, who
1 wou'd try anything he could got j
away with. Hud referees Batniale
and Cameron been watchinng the
game, there would have been nu
j merous fouls called.
Cetting Away with Murder
Shapiro and Paul Caliber, the tall
Ncto boy, time and again hooked
arms, nushod. and hipped the In
dians ''St' ey tried to work the ball
in. e referees also missed the
I sters VeipT taken by both teams, as
scverr' obvious infractions went
| uncalled
But ' ford had no excuses.
CCNY 1 "11 the way, and the In
dians were never in the ball game
from beginning to end. Hilty Sha
piro was high point man with 15,
but the Ecuver scoring came from
all angles.
Dave Davidson, the only Stan
lord starter to turn in h<s usual good
game, sparked the offense, such as
it was. Dave scored 14 points, main
ly on driving jump shots, and ap
peared to be the only hustler on the
ball club.
Gelber lroin Way Out
Marv Gelber, matching two
handed long shots with his fellow
New Yorkers, also looked good.
Marv dropped in 12 points, and
picked up a few loose balls, some
thing which Stanford did very little
of.
Bill Stephenson had a hard time
shedding his two bodyguards, but
cashed in on a few of the fouls
called to run up 12 points.
Only clean-cut victor of the week
end was Sam Barry's Trojan team.
USC surprised USF Friday night,
41 to 39, and then followed up with
an easy 71 to 50 victory over Santa
Clara Saturday night.

Stanford's flimsy road to national
greatness was washed out last Fri
day night as Nat Holman's CCNY
cagers eagerly furnished the down
pour.
Any hopes for a top national rank
were shattered by the determined
<jang of Metropolitan New York
sharpies who outran, outsmarted,
i and outplayed Stanford's relaxing
basketballers to ring up a G7 to 57
victory in the Cow Palace.
CCNY used blazing speed and a
deadly long-shot game to blast the
| Cards by more of a convincing mar
-1 gin than the final score actually in
i dicated. Friday night it appeared
| as if the visitors from New York
were just out of the class of local
quintets.
But when USF's hustling Dons
ran past CCNY in a 48 to 32 land
! slide the following night on the
I same floor, question was immedi
: ateiy raised as to just how bad
Stanford had been on Friday night,
i Reason for th*j»*iiebate w<>s Stan

, over USF.
Stanford Cold, CCNY Hot
Friday night's disaster seemed to
I be a case of Stanford, having a bad

j night, meeting CCNY which was 1
I red-hot and couldn't miss.
But it shouldn't have been that I
bad. At least, that's what the 10,124 |
! fans who braved the rain, the Bay- j
| shore car t rap, and the muddy I
parking lots finally concluded.
Stanford was dead. The Card of- j
fense was bottled up by the rough j
Beaver tactics, and Dean's defense j
was riddled by New York's sharp 1
and tricky passing, as well as the !
| phenomenal shooting.
