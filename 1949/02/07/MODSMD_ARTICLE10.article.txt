# Red-Hot CCNY Hoopsters Swamp Stanford Five, 67-57
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's flimsy road to national
greatness was washed out last Fri
day night as Nat Holman's CCNY
cagers eagerly furnished the down
pour.
Any hopes for a top national rank
were shattered by the determined
<jang of Metropolitan New York
sharpies who outran, outsmarted,
i and outplayed Stanford's relaxing
basketballers to ring up a G7 to 57
victory in the Cow Palace.
CCNY used blazing speed and a
deadly long-shot game to blast the
| Cards by more of a convincing mar
-1 gin than the final score actually in
i dicated. Friday night it appeared
| as if the visitors from New York
were just out of the class of local
quintets.
But when USF's hustling Dons
ran past CCNY in a 48 to 32 land
! slide the following night on the
I same floor, question was immedi

Stanford had been on Friday night,

parking lots finally concluded.
Stanford was dead. The Card of- j
fense was bottled up by the rough j
Beaver tactics, and Dean's defense j
was riddled by New York's sharp 1
and tricky passing, as well as the !
