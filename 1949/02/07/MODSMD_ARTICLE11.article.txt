# SAE Penalty Eased; Rushing Permitted
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Board announced yesterday a relaxation of
the penalty it gave the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity last quarter
for infraction of rushing regulations.
Outlining the new penalty, Interfraternity Council President
Ted LeVino said, "The SAE fraternity, starting spring quarter

1949, may pledge and admit any man
who will have 90 units or the equiv
alent by the end of that quarter."
Last quarter's regulation stilted
that the SAE's could not pledge
anyone before autumn quarter '49,
and could not permit anyone to room
and board in the house until the
fall of '50.
May Rush on Equal Basis
The new ruling means that be
ginning spring quarter, the SAE's
may admit any student who will be
come a junior either next summer
or fall quarter. The ruling does not
penalize the house for any rushing
it might do; in this regard the SAE's
are on an equal basis with all other
campus fraternities.
However, the new regulation also
states, in identity with the old, that
the SAE's may not pledge any man
having less than 90 units until fall
quarter '49, and that it may not per
mit these men to room and/or board
in the house until they have com
pleted DO units, or until fall quarter,
'50.
LeVino said the reason for re
laxing the penalty by allowing the
fraternity to admit men of 90 unit
status was that of eliminating the
financial difficulties that would arise
under the old regulation.
Alleviate Financial Burden
He said the SAE's, if not allowed
to admit anyone before the fall oi
'50, as previously ruled, might have
as few as 18 men in thir house that
spring quarter, thus burdening
themselves financially.
"In so far as the penalty was based
on an infraction of rushing rules
only," LeVino said, "the Interfrater
nity Board felt it unfair to impose
not only a rushing but also a fi
nancial penalty on the house.
"Consequently, it delegated Dean
; Kimpton and I, both members of
1 the Intel-fraternity Board of Control,
to work out a new ruling with an
eye to eliminating the financial diffi
culty while retaining a part of the
punishment for the infraction of the
j rushing' rules. We completed our
] work last Thursday night."
LeVino said that any further diffi
culties arising under the new ruling
will be brought before the Inter
fraternity Board for judgment.

laxing the penalty by allowing the
fraternity to admit men of 90 unit
status was that of eliminating the
financial difficulties that would arise
under the old regulation.
Alleviate Financial Burden
He said the SAE's, if not allowed
to admit anyone before the fall oi
'50, as previously ruled, might have
as few as 18 men in thir house that
spring quarter, thus burdening
themselves financially.
"In so far as the penalty was based
on an infraction of rushing rules
only," LeVino said, "the Interfrater
nity Board felt it unfair to impose
not only a rushing but also a fi
nancial penalty on the house.
"Consequently, it delegated Dean
; Kimpton and I, both members of
1 the Intel-fraternity Board of Control,
to work out a new ruling with an
eye to eliminating the financial diffi
culty while retaining a part of the
punishment for the infraction of the
j rushing' rules. We completed our
] work last Thursday night."
LeVino said that any further diffi
culties arising under the new ruling
will be brought before the Inter
fraternity Board for judgment.

The Interfraternity Board announced yesterday a relaxation of
the penalty it gave the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity last quarter
for infraction of rushing regulations.
Outlining the new penalty, Interfraternity Council President
Ted LeVino said, "The SAE fraternity, starting spring quarter

1949, may pledge and admit any man
who will have 90 units or the equiv
alent by the end of that quarter."
Last quarter's regulation stilted
that the SAE's could not pledge
anyone before autumn quarter '49,
and could not permit anyone to room
and board in the house until the
fall of '50.
May Rush on Equal Basis
The new ruling means that be
ginning spring quarter, the SAE's
may admit any student who will be
come a junior either next summer
or fall quarter. The ruling does not
penalize the house for any rushing
it might do; in this regard the SAE's
are on an equal basis with all other
campus fraternities.
However, the new regulation also
states, in identity with the old, that
the SAE's may not pledge any man
having less than 90 units until fall
quarter '49, and that it may not per
mit these men to room and/or board
in the house until they have com
pleted DO units, or until fall quarter,
'50.
LeVino said the reason for re
laxing the penalty by allowing the
fraternity to admit men of 90 unit
status was that of eliminating the
financial difficulties that would arise
