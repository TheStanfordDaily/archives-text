## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 7 (/P>.â€”
Winds up to 70 miles an hour lashed
a steady snowfall into towering
drifts in the high passes of the
Sierra Nevada yesterday, closing
both of Northern California's all
year highways through the moun
tain range.
Thousands of weekend skiers in
the Lake Tahoe and Donner Pass
areas were caught by the storm.
Rain soaked the northern low
lands and swept south over most of
the state.
Until tiiis week U.S. 40 through
Donner Pass had not been blocked
in years. It has been closed twice
this weekend.
U.S. 50, to the south over Echo
Summit and around Lake Tahoe,
the other all - weather route, was
closed also.
Highway Division patrols con
voyed hundreds of automobile loads
of the skiers bumper to bumper
behind snowplows.
Many other parties remained

overnight in resort hotels or cab
ins.
Cross-country buses and freight
trucks were held at Truekee, Calif.,
on the eastern approaches. On the
west side no new traffic was per
mitted beyond Baxter on Highway
40 and Placerville on 50.
Private motorists were urged to
turn around and seek lodging back
along the highways.
The blizzard extended to within
about four miles of Reno, where it
was snowing lightly.
The Air Force called oil the Ne
vada hay lift at noon after about 12
C-C2 flying boxcars had dropped
hay to snowbound cattle in the Ely

ranch country. It will resume when
j weather permits.
Snowbanks along Highway 40
j were more than 10 ieet high, heaped
I by rotary plows.
