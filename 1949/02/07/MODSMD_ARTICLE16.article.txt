BUDAPEST. Hungary, Feb. 7 (/P>.
—Hungarian Communists published
i a bitter attack yesterday on Josef
Cardinal Mindszenty, who faces a
i possible death sentence i'or treason,
j The trial of the licman Catholic
j primate was described in this blast
i as a defeat for the West.
An editorial entitled "End of a
j Legend" filled the first page of the
official Communist newspaper Sza
j bad Nop. It referred to the leader
i of Hungary's 7.000,000 Catholics as
a "wretched worm, a frightened
scoundrel who abandoned his prin
ciples and" aims, and is scared only
tor his miserable life."
The denunciation came only a
few hours after Cardinal Mindszen
ty made his final plea in the tiny
i Budapest courtroom. In it the
Catholic primate asked that divine
guidance be granted his judges so
that their verdict would help pro
mote peace between church und
state.
(Catholics in the United States
denounced Cardinal Mindszenty's
trial as a mockery during a day of
"prayer and protest" against the ar
rest and imprisonment of the Hun
garian primate. In New York,
I Francis Cardinal Spellman said the
j United States faces certain Com-
I munisl conquest and annihilation if
jit fails to learn a lesson from the
j "martyrdom" of Cardinal Mind
