## Two Worthy Projects 
### 
Excom on Wednesday will discuss the Foreign Scholarship
Program and the grants-in-aid problem. The question on the FSP [
will be, first, is the program to be continued; and next, how much
money should the ASSU budget for it?
The question arising on the grants-in-aid plan is, should funds
for the SlOO per student grants be voted this year at the expense
of the FSP?
We need a Foreign Scholarship Program, and the University i
and the students should make every effort to continue the pro
gram next year by bringing over at least five to seven students.
Farm students also are in need of an enlarged grants-in-aid fund.
But where can the ASSU get the financial support to back the two
projects? Several possibilities exist, but first we will present
some backgound material on the FSP and the grants-in-aid fund. I
In his FSP report to Excom Wednesday, Chairman Frank Wolff
said that through Stanford's scholarship program, "Ideas have
been exchanged, good will has been spread between native and
foreign students, and outstanding European students have ex
panded their knowledge in the international relations field."
ASSU President Gus Chavalas added the point that the value
of the Stanford investment may be measured next year by the
number of universities adopting the FSP.
The Daily will support the FSP for two reasons.
First, we cannot expect other schools to adopt the program if
we do not continue it ourselves. Secondly, the program has
developed a more constructive understanding of other world
states between the seven foreign students and those in the Stan
ford Family that have come in contact with them.
The need for additional grants-in-aid money also has our strong
support.
Last spring Excom budgeted $5,000 for grants-in-aid to supple
ment those grants provided by the University. That ASSU sum
was to last three years to aid students in school at the time of
the tuition increase. Over half—s2,9oo—of the ASSU grants-in-aid
money has been distributed so far this year! Furthermore, there
are no more grants of any kind available for the rest of this
school year and summer quarter. Therefore, we feel the need
for help at home is just as important as providing instruction for
foreign scholars.
Several possibilities exist that may lead to a larger grants-in
aid fund.
First the ASSU may allot an additional $5,000 for grants. But
such an expenditure would put a big dent in the ASSU account
if a $6,000 to $9,000 Foreign Scholarship Plan must be financed
as it has been this year.
Secondly, FSP expenses may be cut in half next year if Stan
ford can take advantage of the Fullbright Bill. The bill would
account for round-trip traveling expenses for foreign students.
Money saved from the application of this federal bill could be
budgeted to the grants-in-aid fund.
The third possibility involves a value judgment. Which de
serves our more immediate attention—a new union or additional
funds for the grants?
A union is chiefly a recreational center. Grants-in-aid pro
vide tuition grants of $100 per quarter to students caught by the
rising cost of tuition after they had entered Stanford. An indi
vidual with a university education is more valuable to society
than a new union.
If the dollar that each student pays out of his tuition fee for
the proposed Tresidder Union could be diverted for one quarter
to provide for an enlarged grants-in-aid program, a serious prob
lem could be eased. Such a decision for the Board of Trustees
would be a difficult one to make, however, because in these years
of cheap money, now is the time to build up a large union fund.

and the students should make every effort to continue the pro
gram next year by bringing over at least five to seven students.
Farm students also are in need of an enlarged grants-in-aid fund.
But where can the ASSU get the financial support to back the two
projects? Several possibilities exist, but first we will present
some backgound material on the FSP and the grants-in-aid fund. I
In his FSP report to Excom Wednesday, Chairman Frank Wolff
said that through Stanford's scholarship program, "Ideas have
been exchanged, good will has been spread between native and
foreign students, and outstanding European students have ex
panded their knowledge in the international relations field."
ASSU President Gus Chavalas added the point that the value
of the Stanford investment may be measured next year by the
number of universities adopting the FSP.
The Daily will support the FSP for two reasons.
First, we cannot expect other schools to adopt the program if
we do not continue it ourselves. Secondly, the program has
developed a more constructive understanding of other world
states between the seven foreign students and those in the Stan
ford Family that have come in contact with them.
The need for additional grants-in-aid money also has our strong
support.
Last spring Excom budgeted $5,000 for grants-in-aid to supple
ment those grants provided by the University. That ASSU sum
was to last three years to aid students in school at the time of
the tuition increase. Over half—s2,9oo—of the ASSU grants-in-aid
money has been distributed so far this year! Furthermore, there
are no more grants of any kind available for the rest of this
school year and summer quarter. Therefore, we feel the need
for help at home is just as important as providing instruction for
foreign scholars.
Several possibilities exist that may lead to a larger grants-in
aid fund.
First the ASSU may allot an additional $5,000 for grants. But
such an expenditure would put a big dent in the ASSU account
if a $6,000 to $9,000 Foreign Scholarship Plan must be financed
as it has been this year.
Secondly, FSP expenses may be cut in half next year if Stan
ford can take advantage of the Fullbright Bill. The bill would
account for round-trip traveling expenses for foreign students.
Money saved from the application of this federal bill could be
budgeted to the grants-in-aid fund.
The third possibility involves a value judgment. Which de
serves our more immediate attention—a new union or additional
funds for the grants?
A union is chiefly a recreational center. Grants-in-aid pro
vide tuition grants of $100 per quarter to students caught by the
rising cost of tuition after they had entered Stanford. An indi
vidual with a university education is more valuable to society
than a new union.
If the dollar that each student pays out of his tuition fee for
the proposed Tresidder Union could be diverted for one quarter
to provide for an enlarged grants-in-aid program, a serious prob
lem could be eased. Such a decision for the Board of Trustees
would be a difficult one to make, however, because in these years
of cheap money, now is the time to build up a large union fund.
Excom on Wednesday will discuss the Foreign Scholarship
Program and the grants-in-aid problem. The question on the FSP [
will be, first, is the program to be continued; and next, how much
money should the ASSU budget for it?
The question arising on the grants-in-aid plan is, should funds
for the SlOO per student grants be voted this year at the expense
of the FSP?
