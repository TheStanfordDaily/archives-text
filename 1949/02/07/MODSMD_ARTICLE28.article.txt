# Filibusters 'Yawn' Bills To Death
## 
### ARTHUR EDSON Associated Press Reporter 
| WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (/P).—lt's
| high time a national illusion war,
busted to smithereens, so let's do it
right now:
Filibusters are not funny.
This comes up today because the
Senate is trying to decide what it
j should do about filibusters.
Some Southern Senators insist
| this is the only way to keep what
I they consider harmful legislation
| out of the lawbooks.
I Others contend that the filibuster
| is a time - wasting maneuver, de
signed to defeat the wishes of the
! majority.
Despite this basic disagreement,
! though, I believe both sides would
agree with me in saying there's no
j fun in a filibuster.
I don't know how (he impression
j cot around that a filibuster is a
; combined Milton Berle, Fred Allen,
| and Jack Benny variety show.
Maybe the late Huey Long, talk
j ative Senator from Louisiana, is re-
J sponsible.
Some Senators have such a ram
bling style it's almost impossible for
them to call a spade a spade, where
as Huey could call potlicker pot
licker.
This forthright habit, plus a
shortage of certain other inhibi
tions, made his talk sprightly, after
ja fashion. And when he filiibus
i tered all this was duly reported.
Gradually the idea grew that a
j filibuster is a mad, gay thing, with
I quips flying like arrows during a
j wagon train ambush.
I wasn't in Washington during
j Huey's time. But I recently dug out
I one of his old speeches and read a
j fair-sized hunk of it. No bellows of
j laughter burst from my lips; maybe
i I got hold of the wrong speech.
! The more recent filibusters I have
j attended faithfully. And I can at-
I test that anyone who could enjoy
j them would get a kick out of a
prize fight in which the boxers
i spent the entire time lacing on their
j gloves, or would love a night at the
| theater in which the curtain never
i goes up.
For nothing ever happens. The
| whole point of a filibuster isn't to
be funny, but to be dull, to be so
j dull the opposition has its objec
j tives bored off of it.
You might say that a bill beaten
I by a filibuster has died of natural
j causes.
It has yawned itself to death.

right now:
Filibusters are not funny.
This comes up today because the
Senate is trying to decide what it
j should do about filibusters.
Some Southern Senators insist
| this is the only way to keep what
I they consider harmful legislation
| out of the lawbooks.
I Others contend that the filibuster
| is a time - wasting maneuver, de
signed to defeat the wishes of the
! majority.
Despite this basic disagreement,
! though, I believe both sides would
agree with me in saying there's no
j fun in a filibuster.
I don't know how (he impression
j cot around that a filibuster is a
; combined Milton Berle, Fred Allen,
| and Jack Benny variety show.
Maybe the late Huey Long, talk
j ative Senator from Louisiana, is re-
J sponsible.
Some Senators have such a ram
bling style it's almost impossible for
them to call a spade a spade, where
as Huey could call potlicker pot
licker.
This forthright habit, plus a
shortage of certain other inhibi
tions, made his talk sprightly, after
ja fashion. And when he filiibus
i tered all this was duly reported.
Gradually the idea grew that a
j filibuster is a mad, gay thing, with
I quips flying like arrows during a
j wagon train ambush.
I wasn't in Washington during
j Huey's time. But I recently dug out
I one of his old speeches and read a
j fair-sized hunk of it. No bellows of
j laughter burst from my lips; maybe
i I got hold of the wrong speech.
! The more recent filibusters I have
j attended faithfully. And I can at-
I test that anyone who could enjoy
j them would get a kick out of a
prize fight in which the boxers
i spent the entire time lacing on their
j gloves, or would love a night at the
| theater in which the curtain never
i goes up.
For nothing ever happens. The
| whole point of a filibuster isn't to
be funny, but to be dull, to be so
j dull the opposition has its objec
j tives bored off of it.
You might say that a bill beaten
I by a filibuster has died of natural
j causes.
It has yawned itself to death.
