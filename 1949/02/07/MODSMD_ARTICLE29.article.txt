# Dentists Promise Sounder Teeth By New Methods

### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 6 (TP). —Your
children will have a better chance
for good teeth than you ever had.
And they probably will keep them
longer.
This is the message for the first
National Children's Dental Health
Day, Feb. 7, by Dr. Allen O. Grueb
bel. secretary of the American Den
tal Association.
"The dental profession," he says,
"now has the knowledge to prevent
or control nearly all tooth decay,
gum diseases, and crooked teeth."
Various means of stopping tooth
destruction have been found in the
last 10 years. Preventive steps for
children, Dr. Gruebbel says, are:
'"One, prevent formation of mouth
acids by brushing teeth right after
eating.
"The second is to deprive the bac
teria of sugars by cutting down on
the sugar we eat in the form of con
fections and sweetened beverages
and desserts.
"The third is to make teeth more
resistant to acids by treating them
with sodium fluoride."
Most dentists, he says, now use
this preventive in a series of four
treatments, which must be done in
the dentist's office. The treatments
are repeated every three years or so
up to age 14.
Dr. Gruebbel said that fluorine
treated teeth show 10 per cent less
decay. Investigators are looking for
ways to make fluorine work on
grownups' teeth.
