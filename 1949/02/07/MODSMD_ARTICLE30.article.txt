The other day I was cleaning out my pocket when I
of used Kleenex, which started me thinking, to wit:
You know, things ar.e sure dull around here nr .ink
Wolff runs for ASSU president again this spring for
the future.
There used to be a Dean who graced these ha». and once
set the student body (and the Administration) on its ive ear by
sonorously proclaiming that the reason the lights in the iv*. a Libe were
so poor was "because they have always been poor."
And then there was the Bull Sessioner, who, during the year of a
gubernatorial election, gave the campus his considered opinion on how
to vote on the various propositions that cluttered up the ballot. One of
the propositions advocated legalizing dog racing (and betting). His com
ments were: "Let the sons of b s run. Vote yes."
Yes, things are getting dull. We haven't heard a legitimate king-sized
gripe in a long, long time. The best we've noticed this quarter was one
that filtered through a closed door in Toyon propelled by a booming
anguish. "But this is a . . . ah . . . ah ... a eulogy of Harry Hopkins,
and I don't feel like eulogizing Harry Hopkins. Besides . "
We tiptoed past the closed portal, leaving behind a forlorn student to
commune with his roommate, his soul, and the GOP.
So you see, things are getting duller every day. Unless, of course, one
wishes to consider the decisions handed down by Women's Council. For
the most part, however, the male segment of this campus has always re
garded that 100 per cent feminine activity as being just beyond the ken
of human understanding in a never-never land all its own.
To digress completely from the obvious nonsense previously offered, we
believe that Stanford students are missing a good bet. There is something
lacking here that makes for a fuller life in other places, a truly, living,
vital force in the University that would round out life at Stanford for
many besides adding unread reams of praise for the Farm from similar
groups elsewhere.
Therefore, we stand foursquare and solid behind the proposition that
an interested group of Stanford students should organize a bird-watchers
society. Or, haven't you parked your car under a tree lately?
This organization could perform innumerable useful functions on the
campus besides issuing pertinent bulletins to a breathlessly awaiting stu
dent body:
"Sighted and identified positively by Olga Urp ('52), birdwatcher 2nd
ciass, over the Pioneer Oak at 1:42 p.m., one crow." "Interviewed by an
intrepid Daily reporter about her startling observation, Miss Urp stated
positively that it was a crow. 'I ought to know a crow when I see one;
after all, I been looking at birds for years. Say, haven't I seen you
someplace before? Dinah's? L'Ommie's? Longbarn, maybe?'
" 'Gee, I got a terrific lilt when I saw that crow flapping around. Re
minded me of the time a seagull followed us all the way home from
the beach. Gee, did that burn my date up'!"
Thank you, Miss Urp. So you see, dear reader, an organization of
birdwatchers is just what this little old place needs to liven it up a bit.
That and Miss Urp. And both can be had for very little; all that it takes
is a little effort. And if nothing else, this crew of stiff-neck advocates
could at least put warning signs around the most pertinent trees.
One more digression: one of these days we're going to write a long and
tremendously involved piece about why we think beer should be sold on
j campus. What we'd like to do even better is write a series of articles on
| why we should have beer here. We may even do that. too. And we also
realize that even if we do turn out 30 or 40 thousand words on why we
I should, we're bound to miss an occasional reason. Maybe you have an
idea that we'd be tempted to overlook; all you have to do is engrave it
on the head of a pin and send it to the Dippy. We'll offer our personal
guarantee that it gets stuck in the right place.
And if you don't think we should on campus, may you fall in love with
Olga Urp.

One more digression: one of these days we're going to write a long and
tremendously involved piece about why we think beer should be sold on
j campus. What we'd like to do even better is write a series of articles on
| why we should have beer here. We may even do that. too. And we also
realize that even if we do turn out 30 or 40 thousand words on why we
I should, we're bound to miss an occasional reason. Maybe you have an
idea that we'd be tempted to overlook; all you have to do is engrave it
on the head of a pin and send it to the Dippy. We'll offer our personal
guarantee that it gets stuck in the right place.
And if you don't think we should on campus, may you fall in love with
Olga Urp.
The other day I was cleaning out my pocket when I
of used Kleenex, which started me thinking, to wit:
You know, things ar.e sure dull around here nr .ink
Wolff runs for ASSU president again this spring for
the future.
There used to be a Dean who graced these ha». and once
set the student body (and the Administration) on its ive ear by
sonorously proclaiming that the reason the lights in the iv*. a Libe were
so poor was "because they have always been poor."
And then there was the Bull Sessioner, who, during the year of a
gubernatorial election, gave the campus his considered opinion on how
to vote on the various propositions that cluttered up the ballot. One of
the propositions advocated legalizing dog racing (and betting). His com
ments were: "Let the sons of b s run. Vote yes."
Yes, things are getting dull. We haven't heard a legitimate king-sized
gripe in a long, long time. The best we've noticed this quarter was one
that filtered through a closed door in Toyon propelled by a booming
anguish. "But this is a . . . ah . . . ah ... a eulogy of Harry Hopkins,
and I don't feel like eulogizing Harry Hopkins. Besides . "
We tiptoed past the closed portal, leaving behind a forlorn student to
commune with his roommate, his soul, and the GOP.
So you see, things are getting duller every day. Unless, of course, one
wishes to consider the decisions handed down by Women's Council. For
the most part, however, the male segment of this campus has always re
garded that 100 per cent feminine activity as being just beyond the ken
of human understanding in a never-never land all its own.
To digress completely from the obvious nonsense previously offered, we
believe that Stanford students are missing a good bet. There is something
lacking here that makes for a fuller life in other places, a truly, living,
vital force in the University that would round out life at Stanford for
many besides adding unread reams of praise for the Farm from similar
groups elsewhere.
Therefore, we stand foursquare and solid behind the proposition that
an interested group of Stanford students should organize a bird-watchers
society. Or, haven't you parked your car under a tree lately?
This organization could perform innumerable useful functions on the
campus besides issuing pertinent bulletins to a breathlessly awaiting stu
dent body:
"Sighted and identified positively by Olga Urp ('52), birdwatcher 2nd
ciass, over the Pioneer Oak at 1:42 p.m., one crow." "Interviewed by an
intrepid Daily reporter about her startling observation, Miss Urp stated
positively that it was a crow. 'I ought to know a crow when I see one;
after all, I been looking at birds for years. Say, haven't I seen you
someplace before? Dinah's? L'Ommie's? Longbarn, maybe?'
" 'Gee, I got a terrific lilt when I saw that crow flapping around. Re
minded me of the time a seagull followed us all the way home from
the beach. Gee, did that burn my date up'!"
Thank you, Miss Urp. So you see, dear reader, an organization of
birdwatchers is just what this little old place needs to liven it up a bit.
That and Miss Urp. And both can be had for very little; all that it takes
is a little effort. And if nothing else, this crew of stiff-neck advocates
could at least put warning signs around the most pertinent trees.
