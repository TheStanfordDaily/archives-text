# Men Throw Dice.... Or Do Dice Throw Men?
## 
### 
Dice have been used in every
' country in every period of its ex-
S istence throughout history.
I Archaeologists recently uncov
ered some 66 shops in the ancient
| city of Corinth, some obviously set
up as forerunners of the saloon, and
j in them were found a flock of
| knuckle bones with pictures and de-
I signs on them—dice of an earlier
era.
I guess lady luck has been chasing
the gay blades longer than I thought.
! And she doesn't need a leap year
j to help out her percentages. In the
! case of rolling dem bones she more
than breaks even. There are 36
j ways to turn tip a pair of dice.
Throw five, though, and the odds
go sky high because are there are
7,776 different combinations then.
There is one boy who bet on the
dice many times, though, and never
lost. But he was smart. He let the
! other person roll them .... and
he bet 20.000 to 1 that they couldn't
j throw boxcars (double sixes) six
I times in succession. Why not try
I something easy like building a bat
| tleship out of peppermint sticks.
The shooter in a game of craps,
so called, has the odds 351 1o 244
i against him. That doesn't look too
bad at all ... . till you start roll
j ing them. Ya' can't win, believe
me.
Of course, there arc ways of boost
j ing those odds, too. Dice can be
made crooked in nearly 30 ways.
! About 20 of these don't require load-
I ing of the interior, just a few ex-
I terior-curricular changes. Most of
! these methods alter the shape so
j slightly that their owner even al
lows the other players to use them.
1 He doesn't even have to pull a
switcheroo. Most people don't know
i how to use "loads" anyhow.
If you want to make your own

loaded dice, here's how. The sim
plest way of all, figuring that no
one can see any more than three
sides of a cube at a time without
i handling them, you just put three
! numbers on each one—such as 1-3-5
;or 2-4-6. And you duplicate each
| on the opposite side.
Now when thrown they will pro
i duce only even combinations and the
\ shooter can make point, after point
without lousing up with a seven
| point. But it's tricky, don't go into
j a game cold. Better practice up on
| sugar cubes first.
There is also a study being main
tained on more honest ways to win
| at craps. It involves a brain, though.
! which automatically cuts the field of
! competition down a great degree.
The idea is called psychokinesis, the
! study of mind over matter.
For instance, Dr. Joseph Bank.--
! Rhine of Duke University devoted
a time to study on this point and
■ found out (to his satisfaction at least
! —never to mine) that if you plead
"come eight" every time you rolled,
more eights would turn up th;m it
I you tossed in silence.
Something's wrong. I guess my
mind just isn't up to it. But after
doing the research for this column 1
have invented the perfect dice.
They're round — for people who
would rather play marbles.
