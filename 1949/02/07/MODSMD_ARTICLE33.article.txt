# Student Guides Find Encyclopaedic Mind Helpful for Tourists' Queries

Shaped like an egg and nes
tled into the left arch of Me
morial Court is the "Cell" —;
headquarters of the Student
Guide Service.
From 50 to 75 tourists a day drop j
into the "Cell" to buy the postcards |
or pamphlets on sale, to l'equest a j
guide for a tour through Memorial |
Church or the Hoover Tower, or to |
ask where Johnny Smith ("I think !
he goes to Stanford") is staying.
Guides have to bone up on the
enclycopedia to answer some of the
questions tourists ask. Dean Whit
low, head guide, was recently j
stumped by:
"Is there a Stanley Steamer in
the Museum?" and "What kind of \
frees are outside the Hoover j
Tower?"
The Guide Service was founded j
15 years ago by a group of students j
who hoped to earn part of their tui- j
tion by selling postcards and other
literature to visitors. The Service is !
now incorporated into a University i
department and includes a stall of 1
10 guides who work from 3 to 15
hours a week. The main job of the
guides is to conduct tourists through j
the Church and the Hoover Tower, j
The present staff of guides in
cludes Dean Whitlow, head guide; 1
Ruth Ahrens, Marge Grunewald, j
Mary Kilbourne, Bob Kimball, Mary '
Lou LeVan, Ellen Mitchell, "Pepper" j
Orme, Sonia Pro Pal, and Gladys i
Tipton. Any student may apply for '
a job as a guide, and vacancies are j
filled trom a long waiting list.
Many people do not have a clear

idea of what the guides do. One
distraught woman called the "Cell"
and declared that her six-year-old
son needed guidance and would the I
guides please help. The guide on
duty promptly referred her to the
psychology department.
Although 10 or 15 students drop
in at the "Cell" every day, most of
them ask for a match or the height j
of the Hoover Tower. Student trade !
is heaviest at the beginning of the i

quarter when bewildered students
ask the locations of rooms.
"Does Stanford have a medical
school?" and "Where can I catch a
! bus?" are some questions the guides
have come to expect. There are
even some tourists who peek timidly
into the "Ceir' and ask if it is open,
but by far the most frequent ques
! tion is:
"Where's the nearest restroom?"

etchings, and maps of the campus, conducts tours in Memorial Church
and to the top of the Hoover Library. —Photo by Dick Fowler
