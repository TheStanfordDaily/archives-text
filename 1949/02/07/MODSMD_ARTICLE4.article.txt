# Bayshore Tie-up Delays Students
## 
### 
Between 70 and 75 cars, many
driven by Stanford students headed
lor the Cow Palace basketball
games, were involved in a series of
rear-end collisions which caused a
gigantic traffic jam on the Bayshore
Friday night.
No one was injured in the wrecks,
but the California Highway Patrol
reported that at least 50 of the cars
had to be towed away by wreckers.
The jam, which delayed many
Stanfordites headed for the Cow
Palace, including the team and the
band riding in chartered buses, last
ed for an hour and a half and
blocked all northbound traffic from
Geneva Street to South San Fran
cisco. Students reported that it took
as long as an hour and a half to
get from South San Francisco to
the Cow Palace.
According to police, Ihe Iraffic
began to clog up from Geneva
Stieet, the left turn to the Cow
Palace, about 7 p.m., with the first
accident reported at 7:21 p.m.
Emergency crews were dispatched
to the Bayshore to push cars off the
highway and clear the lanes.
Other officers stopped southbound
traffic at Geneva, allowing autos
bound for the Cow Palace to make
the left turn more quickly. This
unelogged the northbound lanes and
relieved what the patrol described
as "the worst traffic jam ever seen
on the Bayshore."
