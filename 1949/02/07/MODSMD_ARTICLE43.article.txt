### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Ray Lunny's varsity punchers
; made their most impressive show
! ing of the year at the Pavilion Sat
urday night by battling the heavily
i favored UCLA Bruins to a virtual
standstill before losing a heart
breaking 5 1 2 to 4 1 /:2 match decision
j to Ihe West wood ers.
Actually, the margin of victory
I for the southerners was not gained
j in the l ing but via the forfeit route,
j Of the nine matches featured on the
j sterling card, the Lunnymen won
j tour, 'ost four, and broke even in
! one; but on Indian default in the
125-pound division clinched the de
cision for t.e invaders.
But even at that, the final reck
-1 oning could just as easily have been
reversed in favor of the Farm fight
ers had not the referee departed
from official intercollegiate proce
dure in awarding UCLA's Irwin
Thompson a TKO victory over Wil
: lie Altus in the 155-pound feature
i when Altus suffered a split ear in
I the third frame of the hard-fought
bout.
Rcf Ignores Rules
Intercollegiate boxing rules state
. that in the event a contender re
j ceives a cut at any time after the
j first round, the fight shall be stopped
i and the decision awarded to which
ever fighter is ahead on points at
the time; but, while most ringside
observers agreed that Altus had
outpointed Thompson throughout
1 the first two heats, the referee ac
corded the TKO verdict to Thomp
son without consulting the judges'
scorecards.
Sophomore Alan Anderson, fight
ing at the 145-pound spot in his first
varsity season, scored the major up
set of the evening by decisioning
veteran Bruin battler Pete Babin.
who handled the 155-pound chores
j for UCLA last season. The game
' Anderson carried the fight to Babin
i all the way and gained the unani-
I mous decision of the judges and
S referee.
Ten Eyck Wins
Fred Ten Eyck, clever Card IGS
- outpointed southerner Don
Hubbard in a close tussle which
saw Ten Eyck close fast to take the
decision.
Jay Savage also gained the nod
l in his 135 - pound feature against
! Chuck Stenhouse of the Bruins; and
i Jarring Jim Hammond scored Ihe
j final Stanford victory of the eve

ning by pounding his way to an
easy decision over Westwooder Bill
Hendricks in the light-heavy slug
fest. In the second 135-pound tiff
Indian Max Money drew with the
Bruins' Mike Luskin.
Heavyweight Loses
On the debit side of the ledger,
big Mike Pelsinger dropped the
heavyweight headliner to invader
Bob Edwards by the TKO route;
155-pounder Pete Willet was out
pointed by UCLA's Floyd Wilson;
and Bob Baker was a TKO victim
in the 130-pound curtain-raiser as
he lost to lightning-fast Hideo Ta
il aka.
Next outing for the Lunnymen
will be Friday night, when they
meet the San Francisco State leath
cr-slingers at 8 o'clock in the Pa
