# Rain, Cold Cancel First Baseball Game
## 
### 
Cold weather and wet grounds j
caused cancellation of Saturday's j
baseball opener between the In
dians and San Francisco's Moffat
Mantecas. Weather permitting, j
the Cards will try again this
weekend with a nine-inning tilt j
against the San Francisco Police
Department scheduled.
