# Braves Upset Favored Menlo Cagers, 46 to 33
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
The Stanford Braves finnhy
looked like a term with some spirit
and identity of their own, instead of
some individual lower-caste varsity
men out for an afternoon of exer
cise, when they spanked Menlo JC,
46-33, lasl Friday afternoon at tho
Pavilion.
The Falcons were never in con
tention as first Jack O'Sullivan and
then Dick Schutte got hot to keep
the locals in command.
Menlo reverted from a zone de
fense. which had baffled the Braves
in the teams' previous two meet
ings, to a rather inoffensive man-to
man which proved particularly vul
nerable to the JV s fast break.
In lact, for Stanford, the whole
first half was break, break, break.
With peppy Jack O'Sullivan on the
scoring end, the Braves swept down
the court again and again to rake a
20 to 14 lead into the dressing room
at intermission. O'Sullivan netted
12 of the JV's first-half 20-point
total.
Schutte Gets Hot
Dick Schutte, who was hotter than
an Irishman's temper in the second
half, got the first of his five buckets
on a beautiful hook shot, just after
play resumed. This stepped up
Stanford's lead to eight points.
However, Menlo did not lie down,
and six quick points put the JC's
back in the game. Forward Don
Gleason tipped one in and a long
shot and two free throws by center
Bob Adams completed the spurt.
But Stanford would not be denied
and came back with 10 points to
Menlo's three to regain command,
32 to 23, with eight minutes to go
in the ball game.
At this point, Menlo shifted into
its potent zone defense. The game
virtually stopped as the Braves
would not play ball under those
conditions; they passed the ball
slowly around outside the key,
making no attempt to penetrate
their opponents' defense.
Braves Stall
The crowd hooted as Bill Warren
held the ball for as long as 10 sec
onds at a time. But the crafty
Braves, resting on their nine-point
lead, would not change their tac
tics. Even when Pete Layman was
fouled, Stanford refused the shot
and took the ball out.
Finally Menlo switched back to
a man-to-man, but could not catch
Stanford as Schutte, Layman, and
Warren combined their scoring tal
ents to keep the home five in front.
iligh scorer for tiie game was the
Braves' Jack O'Sullivan with ]4
points. "Sully,'' however, hardly
outshone brilliant Dick Schutte who
whirled out of the post to sink hook
shot after hook shot in the second
half for a total of 10 important
points.
Subs Sparkle
Bill Warren and Pete Layman
must also be mentioned. Substi
tutes going into last Friday's game,
they came into their own against
the Falcons, scoring six and three
points respectively. Warren, espe
cilaly, sparked the team with his
spirited, driving play.
Bill Gisler topped the losers with
10 points, made mostly on post-in
termission long shots. Bob Adams
was second with nine. It was he
and Gisler that kept the score
respectable against the red - hot
Braves.
The Menlo team added to the
Braves' prestige on Saturday niyht
when they downed the heretofore
undefeated City College of San
Francisco. JC champions of Cali
fornia, 34-33.

Braves Stall
The crowd hooted as Bill Warren
held the ball for as long as 10 sec
onds at a time. But the crafty
Braves, resting on their nine-point
lead, would not change their tac
tics. Even when Pete Layman was
fouled, Stanford refused the shot
and took the ball out.
Finally Menlo switched back to
a man-to-man, but could not catch
Stanford as Schutte, Layman, and
Warren combined their scoring tal
ents to keep the home five in front.
iligh scorer for tiie game was the
Braves' Jack O'Sullivan with ]4
points. "Sully,'' however, hardly
outshone brilliant Dick Schutte who
whirled out of the post to sink hook
shot after hook shot in the second
half for a total of 10 important
points.
Subs Sparkle
Bill Warren and Pete Layman
must also be mentioned. Substi
tutes going into last Friday's game,
they came into their own against
the Falcons, scoring six and three
points respectively. Warren, espe
cilaly, sparked the team with his
spirited, driving play.
Bill Gisler topped the losers with
10 points, made mostly on post-in
termission long shots. Bob Adams
was second with nine. It was he
and Gisler that kept the score
respectable against the red - hot
Braves.

DICK SCHUTTE, Brave center,
led his jayvee teammates to a
rousing 4(i-.'!3 upset win over
Menlo JC Friday afternoon with
a 10-point splurge in the second
half.
The Stanford Braves finnhy
looked like a term with some spirit
and identity of their own, instead of
some individual lower-caste varsity
men out for an afternoon of exer
cise, when they spanked Menlo JC,
46-33, lasl Friday afternoon at tho
Pavilion.
The Falcons were never in con
tention as first Jack O'Sullivan and
then Dick Schutte got hot to keep
the locals in command.
Menlo reverted from a zone de
fense. which had baffled the Braves
in the teams' previous two meet
ings, to a rather inoffensive man-to
man which proved particularly vul
nerable to the JV s fast break.
In lact, for Stanford, the whole
first half was break, break, break.
With peppy Jack O'Sullivan on the
scoring end, the Braves swept down
the court again and again to rake a
20 to 14 lead into the dressing room
at intermission. O'Sullivan netted
12 of the JV's first-half 20-point
total.
Schutte Gets Hot
Dick Schutte, who was hotter than
an Irishman's temper in the second
half, got the first of his five buckets
on a beautiful hook shot, just after
play resumed. This stepped up
Stanford's lead to eight points.
However, Menlo did not lie down,
and six quick points put the JC's
back in the game. Forward Don
Gleason tipped one in and a long
shot and two free throws by center
Bob Adams completed the spurt.
But Stanford would not be denied
and came back with 10 points to
Menlo's three to regain command,
32 to 23, with eight minutes to go
in the ball game.
At this point, Menlo shifted into
its potent zone defense. The game
virtually stopped as the Braves
would not play ball under those
conditions; they passed the ball
slowly around outside the key,
making no attempt to penetrate
their opponents' defense.
