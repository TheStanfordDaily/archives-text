# JOHN HALL
## The 						Front Row 
### 
I Its out with the old and on with the new today as a brand new staff takes
1 charge of The Daily. Here on pages six and seven, we're set to start giving
you the very best in campus coverage as well as taking brief daily looks
at the national picture. Or at least that's our goal for the days ahead.
We would like to be able to give j'ou spurts fans a quick glimpse of
1 the scene every morning so that you wouldn't have to turn to the Green
j ft r your dope.
Hight now. the sports staff is in its best shape since the war. A year ago,
; our staff was formed around a couple frustrated athletes, a journalism
; major who didn't have anything better to do, and a guy who came in to
practice typing lessons every day.
Experience, We Got It
; But finally, after some pitiful efforts, an experienced, well-informed
I crew began to materialize. Wait a minute, that doesn't mean that the
mistakes disappeared and that we became experts, but it does mean that
a conscientious staff came into being, one that wants to give you some
thing to read with your morning coffee, or when the lecture material gets
! too boring.
At any rate, I'd like to introduce the different members of our depart
j ment, with hopes that you will be enjoying their work lor the next six
I months or so.
''Sideline Slants" To Stay
Topping the list ol holdovers is Bill Swig-art, former sports editor re
cently upped to associate, who will cover the coming baseball campaign.
; Battling Bill will also continue to pen his Thursday morning Sideline
1 Slants.
The pipeman, John Breier, is back to watch over spring football to see
that all goes well. John got the reputation for being Stanford's number
' one iootball fan last season, and at least was their most loyal booster in
Ipi int. He hitch-hiked J,OOO miles to see his boys play Army in New York
I last November.
Through Bieiers Pipe will be a regular Wednesday morning feature.
Vaisit> tiack, said to be in lor a great season, will be covered by sopho
more Dwight Wilbur, who has already seen a year's experience as a Desk
Editor. Dwight knows the sport from actual contact, as he ran the mile
j lest season as a freshman.
Jones Top Makeup Man
.-1 rugby fanatic, Cray ton Jones, is starting his second year as a desk
editor. Critical Crayton is probably the best makeup man on the staff.
Two newcomers, A 1 Berry and Bob Bernstein, will take over a desk Tor
' the coming year. Funnyman Berry adds a needed touch to the sports ,=ide,
j while Bob Bernstein fits in smoothly as creator of Midweek Musings and
' reporter of boxing.
Dan Winston, who received honors for writing the story of the year at
Saturday night's Daily Banquet, will handle the Sunday hotspot at desk,
â–  and will cover wrestling right from the mats. Winston is a grunt and
pioan man himself, and has already won a good share of his matches
this season.
Crusade For Color
Balancing out the staff are assistant desk men Phil Steinmetz, Bill Morley,
Fred Scott, Carl Irving. Gil Jonas, George Anderson, and Dick Klein.
Gil Jonas doubles in photography and is an expert in the field, so we will
finally get some new art to work with over here. Those same cuts you've
been seeing for a year, have got to go.
By the way, the Front How will be jammed into print anytime I can find
| a spot, and I take my regular turn every Tuesday morning.
So, we re starting the new regime, covering it play-by-play as Stan-
I ford's athletic teams keep plugging along that, long road back to national
prominence. We're going to crusade for more color, the personal touch,
and the straight story. Stick around, it might prove interesting.
