to 8 decision to heavily favored Cal
Poly in a dual meet in the Stanford 1
Pavilion Friday night.
Although the score was lopsided,
the Indians came close to upsetting j
llie powerful team from the south.
Cal Poly got of! to a roaring start !
when they copped the first two !
matches of (he evening by deci- j
sions. Dick Hutchinson beat Dick j
Esbenshade in the 121-pound bout, !
and Weber Lawson took the meas- ;
lire of Dick Cruce in the 128-pound i
match.
Williams Gains Fall
Don Williams pulled the Indians j
within one point of Cal Poly when i
he threw D. Montgomery in the
second period of the 136 - pound
bout. Williams was clearly the su
perior wrestler, and his five points
for the fall made the score 6 to 5
in favor of Cal Poly.
In the 145 match Vern Jones came
through in his customary style to
win an easy decision from Howard
Tillotson. Jones' decision put the

; Indians ahead by a count of S to 6
Jim Dovve, Cal Poly captain, de
i cisioned Dan Winston in the 155-
j pound match to put Cal Polv ahead,
I and from then on the visitors from
| tHo south could do no wrong.
Drops Close Match
Jim Kujless dropped a heart -
J breaker to Frank Adams in the 165-
j pound tussle. Kurfess trailed badly
I after the fi'.f t period, but he put Â®u
; a tremendous rally that just tell
j short as Adams took the decision o;i
I a 9 to 8 count.
A last-second take-down gave A!
I Cadena a narrow 4 to 3 decision
I over Dick DeWitt in the 175-pound
! scrap. DeWitt, wrestling for the
first time on the Indian varsity, had
I given the favored Cadena a thor-
I ough going-over before the Cal Poly
grappler eked out his decision.
In the final match of the even ivy;
I Jack Darling pinned Indian heavy
weight Jack White in the first pe
riod to give Cal Poly the final mar-
I gin of victory.
