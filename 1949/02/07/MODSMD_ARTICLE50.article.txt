# Chicago Dean Explains Fraternity Ruling
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
"Univrsity of Chicago fraternities
ore jus I as strong as ever." says
Chicago Dean Robert Strozier, "de
spite the fact that a university rul
ing prohibits freshman and sopho
more pledging."
Dean Strozier, who was heard
with Stanford Dean Lawrence A.
Ki.npton on KSU's new "quest ion -
and - answer" program Thursday
night, explained that the ruling was
intended to strengthen the dormi
tory system rather than weaken the
fraternities.
As the five-student pane! partici
pating in the program continued to
fire questions at the two deans re
garding the housing situation at i
Stanford and Chicago. Dean Kimp- !
ton stated:
"I expect that no freshmen will !
live in the Village next year."
Questioned as to why the Uni

versity of Chicago dropped inter
collegiate football. Dean Strozier re
plied:
"Chancellor Hutchins felt that
football was too commercial. Chi
cago never has been a formidable
foe for other schoo's in sports, but
we now have a very healthy intra
mural program, including tackle
football, and more men are par
ticipating in sports than ever be
fore."
Dean Strozier was questioned as
to the "normalcy" of Chicago stu
dents, who enter the university at
the high school junior level.
"We don't have a bunch of quiz
kids," he said. "Well, some are, but
over-all they're just as normal as
students in any other university."
He admitted that Chicago stu
dents have nothing in the way of
the school spirit found at Stanford.
Thursday night's program was the

first in a series of panels to feature
Dean Kimpton. Each week a group
of informed students will question
the dean on a pre-selected topic of
timely interest.
Students firing the questions 011
last week's discussion were: Ann
Magrath. graduate transfer from the
University of Chicago; Bill Warren,
Inter - Eating Club Council presi
dent; Ted LeVino, chairman of the
Interfraterriity Board of Control;
Don Fix. varsity football player; and
Jack Little, Daily night editor.
