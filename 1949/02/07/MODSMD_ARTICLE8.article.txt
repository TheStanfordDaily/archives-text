# Air Lift Flys SIRO Gifts
## 
### 
Clothes turned in up until this
Friday to SIRO will be sent to the
Free University of Berlin via air
lift. SIRO has asked that besides
books and clothing, students also
donate needles, pins, thread, yarn,
and soap.
These items may be turned in
either to the SIRO office or to the
SIRO representatives in the vari
ous living groups.
Packers will be needed all week
in order to prepare the collected
material for shipment by air lift
next weekend. Students wishing to
help may report to the SIRO office
in the lIR shack any time after 9
a.m. Monday through Friday.
The Friday deadline does not
mean that no clothes may be do
nated to SIRO following that date.
It merely means that clothes given
before then will have top priority
on air lift flight to the Free Uni
versity of Berlin. "The SIRO cloth
ing drive a perpetual thing," said
Gretchen Blaesing. "We can al
ways use clothing donations."
