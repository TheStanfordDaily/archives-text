SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 7 UP).—
Northern California recovered to
some extent today from one of the
most violent storms of the season.
Major highways to the East were
partially reopened, but transconti
nental train service bogged down
as blizzards raged in the Sierra Ne
vada and in the Midwest.
At least six Northern California
traffic deaths were blamed on the
weather. Highway patrolmen used
scout cars and snow plows in an ef-

fort to rescue skiers marooned in the
Sierra and Siskiyou resort areas.
Chains were necessary on the ma
jor highways to Nevada and to Ore
gon.
San Francisco relaxed tempora
rily when predicted rain and wind
failed to develop. Sun beat down
on the city, which has been shiver
ing for a week from cold and rain.
But a new storm was whipping in
on the .slate, and tlje Weather Bu
reau said it would strike tomorrow.
The storm caused a rockslide on
Telegraph Hill, in the heart of the
city. Down on the Peninsula, trees
blew down and storm sewer covers
popped oft.
The storm brought 16 inches of
snow to Quincy and other commu
nities in Plumas County, and Lake
Almanor reported five l'eet of snow.
Part of Eureka was plunged in
darkness by a power failure in the
Trinity Alps.
Four inches of snow fell yester
day at Truckee, where scores of bus
passenegrs and private motorits
were marooned.
Westbound trains due to arrive in
San Francisco today and eastbound
trains which left here yesterday
were stranded at points in Utah,
Nevada, and Wyoming.


HARD-PACKED DRIFTS have bogged down transcontinental railroads
like the relief train pictured above on the Colorado-Wyoming run. A
new storm, expected to strike tomorrow, is already screaming toward
Northern California.
