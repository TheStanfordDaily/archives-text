BUDAPEST, Hungary, Feb. 7 1/4').
—Josef Cardinal Mindszenty prayed
alone in his prison cell tonight as
the hour ot his judgment on trea
son charges drew near.
Verdicts against the Cardinal and
six eo - defendants will be an
nounced by the people's court of
Communist-dominated Hungary at
9 a.m. tomorrow (midnight PST).
The thin Roman Catholic primate
afid the others face possible death
by hanging.
(Separated by oceans and nation
al boundaries, the peoples of many
countries outside the Soviet sphere
prayed with the Cardinal. Protests
against the trial mounted in the
Catholic world. Many Protestants
and Jews joined in these expres
sions of indignation.)
The Hungarian government re
jected Britain's protest over the re
fusal of Hungarian authorities to
allow British observers to attend the
trial. There were no official United
States observers at the trial either.
Prominent Hungarian Catholics
voiced skepticism about the whole
proceedings. Catholic churches in
Budapest and its suburbs were
jammed yesterday. Lines formed
outside many of them as people
waited to attend services. There
were no special sermons for the
Cardinal.
The trial lasted for three days. In
his summation Saturday prosecutor
Gyula Elapi called for a "hard and
inexorable" verdict—death on the
gallos. He accused the Cardinal of
organizing a spy ring with the in
tention of overthrowing the Hun
garian government and restoiing
Archduke Otto of Hapsburg to the
throne. The prosecutor also denied
charges from the Vatican and other
Western sources that the Cardinal
had been drugged and tortured.
Members of the press, chiefly
Hungarian journalists, who covered
the trial said they thought the Car
dinal would be sentenced at least to
life imprisonment. Many believed
he would be sentenced to death.
