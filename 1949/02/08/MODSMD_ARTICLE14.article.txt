# Graduate Women Plan Coffee Hour, Afternoon Tea, New Constitution
## 
### PEGGY STERN 
A coffee hour to bridge that gap
between morning classes was one of
the ideas proposed by Mary Ellen
Rice, social chairman, at the last
meeting of the Associated Graduate
Women.
The first of these sessions, which
will feature music, refreshments,
and an opportunity for graduate
students to get acquainted, Is be
ing planned by Wanda Holmes and
Courtney Cowgill, who will also ne
gotiate with social representatives

of graduate men's living groups to
be invited.
The graduate women also favored
having an afternoon tea this quar
ter to which several faculty mem
bers will be invited. Lucille Bark
dull is in charge of arrangements
for this event, which will be dis
cussed at the next Graduate Wom
en's luncheon.
With an eye to participating more
actively as a group in campus ac
tivities, the Grad Women appointed
Sally Taylor and Carol Newton to
represent them at the Mock Con
vention of the YWCA which was
held last Friday and Saturday. Sal
ly Brown, president of the "Y." ex
plained the purpose of the conven
tion and emphasized the impor
tance of both graduates and under
graduates participating.
Peggy Svern submitted the first
draft of the revised constitution for
the Gradaute Women's Organiza
tion, after which the various provi
sion;; were discussed. There will be
a further report on the constitution
?t the next meeting, which is to
bt hold Feb. lf> at 12 noon in the
Gprdc.i Win.* of the Union Dining
Room. Ann Hazelton, president of
the organization, asks that graduate
women who plan to attend the
meeiing contact her at DA 2-2151 to
make reservations.
