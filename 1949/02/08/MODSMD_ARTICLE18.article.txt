# NORWAY VS. RUSSIA
## Acheson, Discuss Alliance as Russ Protest 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7 (/?).â€”
Norway's Foreign Minister submit
ted personally to Secretary Acheson
today questions his country wants
answered before deciding whether
to join in the North Atlantic Secu
rity Alliance.
Russia has brought pressure on
Norway to stay out of the alliance.
Foreign Minister Helvard Lange
of Norway talked with Acheson for
32 minutes at the State Department.
He told reporters afterward that he
regards today's brief session as a
preliminary to more intensive dis
cussions later in the week. State
Department officials immediately
threw a news blackout around the
conversation.
In talking to reporters, however,
the Norwegian diplomat took oc
casion to dispute Russia's assertion
that Norway had failed to give a

clear answer to a Soviet question
about the possibility of foreign
bases on Norway's soil.
Russia had "raised the question
whether Western powers, under the
Atlantic Pact, might not establish
bases on Norway's territory.
Norway replied on Feb. 1 that she
would never grant bases to foreign
powers unless attacked or threat
ened with attack.
Russia termed this assurance un
satisfactory because "hastily con
cocted stories about a threat of at
tack would suffice to make Norwa>
open her doors to foreign troops
and grant bases."
Lange said today, "To my mine
it was a clear answer. I don't want
at this moment to make any furthei
comment."
The purpose of the next discus
sions. he said, will be to get the
answers Norway's cabinet and par
liament need before deciding on the
next move to protect the Norwe
gian border against possible aggres
sion.
Lanee said, in reply to questions,
that Acheson did not invite Nor
way at today's meeting to partici
pate in the security negotiations the
United States is now conducting
with Canada and five Western Eu
ropean countries.
Lange's ca'l at the State Depart
ment marked a broadening of the
talks about the Atlantic Pact. Unti!
now, all discussions have been con
fined to representatives of Britain.
Canada, France. Belgium, the Neth
erlands, Luxembourg, and the
United States.
