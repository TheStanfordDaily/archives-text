fee'in g (hat ti e Village is a tempo
rary thing," he said. "It is now a
vital and continuing part of the
University community."
The Village," stressed Kimpton,
"must become aware of its own
needs and have the urge to satisfy
them. Any number of means would
serve. Among those suggested were
a large Village social center, and
eating clubs. To spark such activi
ties would require considerable in
dividual effort as well as united
eroup action. The individual should
fulfill his responsibilities to have his
rights protected.
Dean Kimpton assured the group
that the faculty and the administra
tion were ready to give the fullest
co-operation to the Village in pro
moting its activities.
The meeting concluded with Aus
