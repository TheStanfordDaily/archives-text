# Spring Swimming Possible; Lake Lagunita Filling Fast
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
It may not be long before enthu
siastic Farm mermaids anil mermen
take up swimming with the sea
gulls out on Lake Lagunita.
According to latest facts and fig
ures, Stanlord's big spring feature
is 14 million gallons full and boasts
a maximum depth of six feet. Ca-

of the lake is IIS million gal
lons.
Ernie Brandsten, head keeper up
• at Searsville Lake, Lagunita's prin
cipal source, says that his lake
should fill up today or tomorrow,
' provided the runoff from the moun
tains keeps up.
Assuming the runoff continues.
I Senrsville's overflow will then be
drained away by San Francisquito
j Creek which in turn flows into the
Lagunita flume.
Capacity of the flume is 12 million
gallons per day. This means that it
would take at least eight days of
full-flume to fill the outdoor pool to
near-capacity.
Ernie Brandsten thinks these
eight days are swiftly approaching.
He says that if there is a storm
today or tomorrow, some four inches
of rain will have fallen in his area
in the space of six days, a sure in
dication of an extraordinary Sears
ville overflow.
At present, Searsville has 40 mil
lion gallons to go, or about 15
inches.
Carl Meyer, assistant Stanford
engineer, said yesterday that the
water now in Lagunita has come
from West Union Creek, a tributary
of San Francisquito.
Somewhat, less optimistic thgn
Mr. Brandsten. Meyer said that
there is little possibility of an eight
! day full-flume period. He made the
ooint. however, that Lagunita
j should be full by the end of Febru
; ary if it is to remain so spring
