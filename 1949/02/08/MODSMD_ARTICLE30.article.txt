Tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. off-campus students will rally to the
Memorial Auditorium to hear top-flight student talent and to form
activity groups among themselves in order to become better inte
grated to campus activities. *
Off-campus students perhaps are the most homogeneous group
of men and women attending Stanford. They are represented in
all age groups, both sexes, and every organization that comprises
student extracurricular activity.
The rally tomorrow will provide the catalytic agent for off- J
campus students to unite and form camera, bridge, and writing
clubs; to organize a basketball team; to prepare for the Spring
Sing; and to form a centralized branch of student life where 4,000
students can exploit the rest of their interests.
Before we open an attack on the disrepair of campus roads, a
note might be injected here about Farm sidewalks. In one area
in particular—from the Union Residence parking lot to the back
of the Cellar—five-minute rains fill the gravel walk.
Take your pick: Get your feet wet, and flirt with pneumonia;
or, step out into the street and get hit by a car.
One of the best professions to learn synonyms of one's native
language is journalism. But try as hard as we can, Daily news
and headline writers have been unable to find a synonym to
the word "foreign" when applied to our seven guests from
Europe and to other students from all over the world.
For some of us, the "foreign" students are no more foreign
than our own roommates. They have been accepted with en-
Ihusiasm in bull sessions, activities, and classrooms.
We request, therefore, that you 212 students from countries
outside the United States not regard the term "foreign" as an at-1
tempt to isolate you. The English language has its limitations.
