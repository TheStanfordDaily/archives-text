## Federal Scholarships 
### 
To the Editor:
Your editorial. Federal Scholarships, is perhaps typical of many super
ficial presentations of the fundamental issue of the Federal Government's
relation to the individual. It is. of course, an obviously simple matter to
'point out that it would be nice if all citizens had an equal opportunity
at higher education.
However, the fact that some do not is not sufficient justification for
the conclusion that any form of Federal aid—even scholarships—is neces
sarily just, fitting', and proper.
Education problems must be considered politically,' for to consider
Federal participation in anything without considering the political conse
quences thereof is sheer folly. The history of our Republic of recent has
been that of increased Federal control over states and individuals.
Federal aid to education—even in the form of scholarships—is clearly
another step in that direction. History presents no examples of Federal
assistance without Federal intervention. It seems inevitable that when the
helping hand of Uncle Sam gives, it also takes—gives money, takes liber
ties. The non-material aspects of Federal aid to education are highly
relevant.
In considering the apparently simple question of Federal scholarships,
certainly deeper and more consequential matters must also be discussed:
How far shall the Federal Government support the individual? How far
*hall the Federal Government control the individual?
