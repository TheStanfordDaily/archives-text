To the Editor:
Every year when election time comes around, one of the biggest cam
paign promises is the extension of on-campus social life. All the candi
dates favor more open houses, after-the-game parties, and more big
dances.
The time has come when students find themselves in a position where
there is no place on campus where they can take their dates. There is no
reason for this.
By the encouragement of the ASSU Social Committee, every living
group on campus could afford to provide at least one open dance a year.
E.ieh week-end should have a minimum of two all-campus dances to
which fellows could take their dates.
Some groups may argue that the residences can't afTord to finance such
Mmill dances as the successful "Trade-Mark Dance" and the "Hard-Up
Hop.' However, if these houses would forget the idea of trying to make
everything free, they would not go in the hole every time. A small, 50-
cent fee per couple would not break anyone, and a combo and light re
freshments could be easily financed.
These suggestions are not directed only to fraternities, but also to
Women's Row houses. Instead of living off the male pocketbooks, they
could plan some all-campus parties for a change. If groups fail to volun
teer for parties, it is up to Social Com to encourage other on-campus
social life. My date is tired of going to Sunday movies!
