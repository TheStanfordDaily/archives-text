# Australians Worried By High Prices

SYDNEY, Feb. 7 (/P)—Australians
are becoming worried about the ris
ing cost of living in their country.
These higher prices also are of
concern to people of Britain and
Europe who are thinking of moving
"Down Under."
Some immigrants who have come
here have gone back on the next
ship. In most cases high costs wire
the reason.
Many Australians can see no early
end to the inflationary spiral thai
began when World War II ended.
Government statistics show these
increases in living costs in Sydney
compared with 1939: food, 42.U per
cent; clothing, 117.7 per cent; mis
cellaneous items, 36.2 per cent;
rents, .8 per' cent.
These increases have been brought
about mainly by:
1. Withdrawal of government sub -
sidies on essential lood and clothing.
2. Introduction of a 40-hour week,
which has reduced each worker's
output.
3. Shortage of manpower, which
has forced employers to pay high
wages.
4. Removal of price ceilings on
thousands of items.
5. Pressure by unions for higher
minimum wages and benefits.
The Australian basic wage is ad
justed to the cost of living every
few months. An increase in the basic
wage usually means a raise for
everyone because most employees on
margins also get it.
This very soon pushes up the
of living again, and there is a fur
ther basic wage change.
These increases are meant to keep
pace with rising living costs. But
many people say they don't.
The average Australian workei —
the one who is more or less happy
has had a house or flat since before
the war. The rent is still the same
as in 1939. His economical wife
knows how and where to buy the
cheapest food and clothes.
Increases in his wages have been
only one step behind each rise in
living costs.
Today the basic wage in Sydney is
six pounds, four shillings ($20.15) a
week. In 1939 it was four pounds,
two shillings ($13.32) a week.
