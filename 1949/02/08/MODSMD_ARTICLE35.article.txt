Definition of Stanford: Stanford is a place, were if the student hits the
books, the books are liable to hit back.

In the last Western Civ final, last quarter, department readers were
startled by this rather unique student interpretation of the philosophy of
history (according to a fully unreliable source):
Concerning Roman civilization, one Encina stalwart wrote:
" — An d since the Roman Empire had 32.000 prostitutes, it is safe to
assume the reason Roman Civilization went down the drain was because
everybody was lying down on the job."

Farm men are asked by the Stanford Bookstore to place their orders
and deposits early for Dr. A. C. Kinsey's next volume, The Sex Habits of
the American Female. The book comes out in 1950.
Talk being heard on the book industry grapevine is that Kinsey gath
ered his material for this volume by disguising* himself and living in
Lagunita for two years as a housemother.

Newest military rumor: Some of the clauses of the new Stanford ROTC

curves."

We ve found a song, to which we added a number of verses that fit the
Cal student to a '"1. When Stanford students sing it, of course we preface
it with an intro.:
Sung to Theme of "Jealousy"
Oh, we're so horrible
Oh. we're so terrible
Yes, you're so right,
It is so unßearable .... (YELL NEXT LINE)
PAUSE. We're Cal students! (GROAN)
Leprosy, my God, I've got Leprosy!
There goes my eyeball, right into my highball.
Leprosy, there it goes crawling all over me.
Da. da. da, da. Leprosy, etc.
(Here are the rest of the middle lines of the stanzas):
There drops my red nose right into my Four Rose.
There goes my double chin into my triple gin.
There goes my front tooth into my Vermouth.
There goes my right car into my Western beer.
There goes my finger nail, into my Regal Pale.
There goes my left thigh into my coke high.
There goes my elbow into my Old Crow.
There goes my finger into my stinger.
There falls my hairline into the white wine.
There go my ear drums into my Seagram's.
There goes my broad A into my Dubonnet.
There goes hair that's sandy into my cherry brandy.
There goes my head that's hairy into my Tom and Jerry.
There goes my knee cap into the beer on tap.

Then there are some other choruses that even the Chaparral wouldn't
print.
