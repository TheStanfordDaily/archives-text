At the midnight spook show last
Saturday in Paly they were passing
out "Faint Checks," but one of the
lads was using them for another
purpose. We saw him kiss a girl,
then hand her one of the "Faint
Checks." How sure of yourself can
one get?
I knew one of the boys who had
the idea that he was irresistible to
all womankind. He finally got over
the idea, though. He died.
He was so sure of himself one
night when he went calling on his
current, lady love that he wore a
baseball suit. Last I heard, though,
he didn't get to first base.

Picture of the week was seen on
the Village .">l2 bulletin board re
cently. It was advertising their
coming beer bust. The sign itself
was simple and to the point. It con
sisted merely of a pictured stein of
beer alongside a pictured- just what
you think was pictured.
Another picture drew a lot of in
terest in the Frisco Examiner last
week. It whs an engagement notice
of one of the UC wheels who, it is
reported, lives at the "Alpha Tan
Omega Sorority house." What's this,
boys, starting a women's auxiliary?

To make a mistake is human, even
if you would hove a hard time
telling it to your superior officer.
Who is the Marine Corps Officer at
Stanford who passed an officer in
the hallway with a snappy, "Hello,
Major? Only thing wrong with the
picture is that the "major" was
wearing a silver star! Quite a speedy
demotion there.
But that isn't much worse than a

journalism professor the other day
who couldn't answer one of his pu
pils' questions about what a "raised
square" was. Funny thing, too, lie
cause that is one of the definitions
the students have to learn for that
class.

llow hungry can a person get?
This story is really pretty nauseat
ing. If you have a weak stomach,
you'd better skip it.
There is a scully at the Village
Commons who. after cleaning the
plates with his hands, very neatly
licks his fingers off. I didn't think
anyone could like Village chow that
well.
And talk about licking your lips.
Try this on your current flame or
friend. Tell him or her to think and
concentrate on the best kiss he or
she ever received. Watch them
closely—they'll lick their lips when
they've thought of it, every time.

Chivalry is not yet dead, but it's
sure in its death throes. Seems po
liteness these days consists in offer
ing your seat to a lady when you
get off a crowded bus.
But then women have always been
crying about equal rights. Now an
increasing number of them are evn
taking up the study of law. To my
way of looking, the usual number
are still laying it down, though.
I'd say "spring fervor" Ins struck
already, from the deep lethargic
looks of the classrooms. I've always
been of the opinion that if all the
students who sleep in class were
placed end to end they would he
much more comfortable.
