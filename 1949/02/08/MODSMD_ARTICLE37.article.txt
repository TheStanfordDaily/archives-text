WASHINGTON. Feb. 7 (A 3 )—The
average income of U.S. families was
$3,000 in 1947. the Census Bureau
reported today, adding that was the
highest figure up to that time.
The bureau found that income was
distributed among the nation's 37.-
000,000 families in this fashion:
Four million had under $1,000: six
million had $1,000 - $2,000; ei«ht
million $2,000-$3.000; eight million
$3,000-$4,000; four million $4,000-
$5,000; three million $5,000-$6,000:
three million $6.000-$10,000; and one
million $10,000 or more.
Thus only four million families
or slightly fewer than one out oi
each nine families in the nation
had in that year the $6,000 whirl;
