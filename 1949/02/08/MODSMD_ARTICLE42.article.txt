# Snake Pit' Acting Superb, But Hollywood Plot Class B
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Cinemalancl has added an ele
mentary psychological case history
jto a brutally moving book and
tossed in a jigger of first-rate aet-
I ing performances to emerge with
j "The Snake Pit," Hollywood's prob
! able choice for "Picture of the
, Year."
That "The Snake Pit," now play
| ing at the Stanford, doesn't measure
i up to its potentialities is a great
pity. Olivia De Haviland reaches a
peak of excellence as the bewil
dered psychotic heroine which
places her first in line for an "Os
car" come march. She manages to
skirt the neurotic hysterics into
which her performance could easily
i have degenerated.
Within the grey walls of Juniper
I Hill Hospital Producer Zanuck
| builds a tense and frightening dra-
Jma of the insane. The disheveled
I women groping for their lost minds
j in the dark hospital are a terrify
i ing sight. The overworked doctors
and nurses—who end by becoming
robots or going insane—are just a*
terrifying and well drawn.
! But when "The Snake Pit" pads
Marv Jane Ward's terse story with
j a "B"' picture Hollywood plot, the
! movie loses its dramatic grip. Fa
ther-complex plus emotional shock
i merely equal one-half hour, of frus
tration for the audience.
112 Leo Genn outshines a superb

supporting cast with his sympathet
ic interpretation of psychiatrist Dr.
Kik. Genn has more sex appeal in
his melodious voice and smooth
manner than has been seen in the
movies in quite a while. Without
exception the women in the asylum
turn in excellent performances. Ce
leste Holm and Betsy Blair are
standouts. Glenn Langham and
Mark Stevens are the only medi
ocre actors in the cast.
"The Snake Pit" is not the best
picture of the year. It does not
have the tenseness of "The Treas
ure of Sierra Madre" or the smooth
ness of '"Hamlet." Nor is it "enter
tainment." It is blunt and brutal in
parts, and in these parts it hits a
level that is way above the average
for the year.
