clean sweep in the two-game series.
In a non-conference game, the
UCLA Bruins squeezed by a scrappy
Pitt five 51 to 48. However, the
Bruins, whom the Cards meet next
Saturday, blasted the 20th Century
Fox team earlier in the week, and
must not be counted out in the hotly
contested PCC race.
Bears Win Two
Cotch Nibs Price's California
Bears, who have an 0-4 record in
Pacific Coast Conference play,
smothered two parochial rivals,
Santa Clara and St. Mary's, over the
weekend. The Bears measured the
Broncs 58 to 40 on Friday night, and
then trounced the Gaels 59 to 42 on
Saturday.
