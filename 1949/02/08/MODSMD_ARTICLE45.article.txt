## INTRAMURAL Betas Swamp DU Hotdogs 
### BILL MORLEY 
The potent Beta I's swept into a
tie with the Leftovers for the
League 111 lead last night at the Pa
viiion. by virtue of a 42-29 victory
ovei the DU Hotdogs.
Bob Swiii ley scored over half of
the Betas' oints, 23 to be exact, to
come close to beating the hapless
DU's by himself. Swingley scored
most of 1. points by merely driving
in under the basket and laying it
up. The DU's shifting man-to-man
proved unable to do anything about
it.
Both teams used the fast break
whenever they could, but both were
sloppy and nobody but Swingley
could put the ball where it should
go with any consistency.
Knowlton Nets Ten
Jack Knowlton played a good
game behind Swingley, scoring 10
points himself and setting up his
flashier teammate for many buck
ets.
The remainder of the Beta offense
was supplied by chunky Roger
Boles. Boles played an unspectacu
lar but steady game at guard, scor
ing seven points mostly on medium
length shots from the key. Rog also
took most of the defensive re
bounds.
For the DU's, it was mostly Jim
Caldwell. Although he only scored
three baskets, all in the second half.
Big Jim, amazing as it may sound,
took over half the game's rebounds.
The frailer Betas could do nothing
about moving him out from either
backboard, and he took rebounds
almost at will.
Blond Dan Ferguson peppered
the basket all night, and although he
did not hit a very high percentage,
his eight points were good enough
to top the Hotdogs.
Jim Flips 22
The game started as though it
might be very close. At the end of
the first half, the Betas led by only
three points, 16 to 13. Dan Fergu
son led the first-half scoring with
six points as Swingley scored only
five of his 23 points in the first half.
Bob must have found his eye in
the rest period, because everything
he threw at the basket after the in
termission seemed to go through.
Very shortly after play resumed the
DU's were no longer in the ball
game as Swingley, at one point,
scored five baskets in a row.
The Delt Pawns established a
new scoring record at the Gym.

victory. Jim Bradshaw flipped in
22 points to lead the potent Delt
attack.

Big Jim, amazing as it may sound,
took over half the game's rebounds.
The frailer Betas could do nothing
about moving him out from either
backboard, and he took rebounds
almost at will.
Blond Dan Ferguson peppered
the basket all night, and although he
did not hit a very high percentage,
his eight points were good enough
to top the Hotdogs.

The game started as though it
might be very close. At the end of
the first half, the Betas led by only
three points, 16 to 13. Dan Fergu
son led the first-half scoring with
six points as Swingley scored only
five of his 23 points in the first half.
Bob must have found his eye in
the rest period, because everything
he threw at the basket after the in
termission seemed to go through.
Very shortly after play resumed the
DU's were no longer in the ball
game as Swingley, at one point,
scored five baskets in a row.
The Delt Pawns established a
new scoring record at the Gym.
racking up a phenomenal 86 to 19
victory. Jim Bradshaw flipped in
22 points to lead the potent Delt
attack.
The potent Beta I's swept into a
tie with the Leftovers for the
League 111 lead last night at the Pa
viiion. by virtue of a 42-29 victory
ovei the DU Hotdogs.
Bob Swiii ley scored over half of
the Betas' oints, 23 to be exact, to
come close to beating the hapless
DU's by himself. Swingley scored
most of 1. points by merely driving
in under the basket and laying it
up. The DU's shifting man-to-man
proved unable to do anything about
it.
Both teams used the fast break
whenever they could, but both were
sloppy and nobody but Swingley
could put the ball where it should
go with any consistency.
Knowlton Nets Ten
Jack Knowlton played a good
game behind Swingley, scoring 10
points himself and setting up his
flashier teammate for many buck
ets.
The remainder of the Beta offense
was supplied by chunky Roger
Boles. Boles played an unspectacu
lar but steady game at guard, scor
ing seven points mostly on medium
length shots from the key. Rog also
took most of the defensive re
bounds.
For the DU's, it was mostly Jim
Caldwell. Although he only scored
three baskets, all in the second half.
