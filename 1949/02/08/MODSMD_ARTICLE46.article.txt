If King Stanford—oh, pardon me, I mean Chump Stanford—doesn't get
cti the dime this Friday night, our local cage hotshots are going to get
a nasty going-over by USC's burly thugs down in LA's smoke-filled Olym
pic Auditorium.
And that's no kidding, gentlemen. Those Trojans are tough, mean, ugly,
ngeiessive, and brutal, and that just ain't the way our boys want to plav.
Ihe trouble being that Stanford has to play USC in order to step for
ward in its journey to the Southern Division Crown.
b tan lord s seasonal record of 17 wins and only 3 losses is sweet-sounding
indeed, but it isn t going to mean one holy heck to El Troje, whose cage
monsters have already smeared Stanford's slate once and will not hesitate
to push the Cards in the puss as many times as possible.
Five Straight for Troy
For the record, USC has bested Everett bean's students five straight
umes now, the last one being a 56-46 affair which Stanford had been
iavored to win. Last year it was four out of four.
And how do they do it, sir? Backboard control, sir, control, will
to win, and by Sam, the old college try. USC has won 9 games against 7
oefeats so lar this season, and compared to Stanford's majestic record,
that s alfalfa feed.
But USC will beat Stanford if all it has to do is go after the ball. That
l a.- been the theme song of Stanford's recent foes. Play the Cards tough
and you ve .wot 'em. Little punk San Jose almost got away with it USC

Cow Palace Quotes
And while talking about the CCNY Beavers, who on Friday night were
the greatest group of cagers ever assembled and who suddenly became
just so many dubs an evening later, I must pass on some of the little items
which came drifting out of the Cow Palace mist; and, pals, it was misty.
What time does the game start.' Stanford is still warming up." (That
was about eight minutes into the game.)
"Isn't that Stanford's Defensive Ace—yes. right there, the person that

Stanford Still Has Stuff
Now don't get me wrong and think that I'm trying to run down Stan
lord's basketball team. I'm not. I have watched them play too many
games this season. They are good basketball men. Besides that, they stiil
own one ol the best clubs in the country.
Individually and collectively, Stanford has got what it takes to "beat
anybody. Sure, undefeated Hamline, CCNY, USF over and over, the Tro
jans, California anbody. With the right mental attitude, that is.
Lately, the mental attitude has been "What the hell." And to quote
a fellow who has his stuff running over at the Park Theater, "Something
is rotten in Denmark."
The ieasons for the decline and fall of the 9th-best-team-in-the-nation
run almost parallel to those of an old Western Civ subject, the Roman
Empire.
Indians Getting Soft
First, the Indians have become too soft. They have had too much success
at an easy price, and it has gotten to the place where they don't like to
trade blows with hard working slugs who obviously don't have their class.
And the Indians just reek class. If it's just a case of a battle between
i ancy-Dans (a la USF and Stanford), you can usually be safe in chalking
up another Card win, but when Troy's gorilla-men, Bud Pelka, Stan
Christie, and Joe White, start tossing their heft around, the results will
be brutal.
Which brings us right back to this little shindig coming up Friday night.
Stanford has to win this one. In the Los Angeles fight arena, Olympic
Auditorium by name, the Cards will have to go uphill all the way.
If, If, If
But the Deanmen can win if they play their ballgame; if they just get
down to business, USC will be victim number 18.
But it will take a different team from the one we have seen for the past
two weekends. It will take a hungry bunch of fighters who really want
to get out and go. The Deanmen have the polish, now's the best time io
shine. Its their stiffest test of the season.
And loi sure, it isn t a game to be missed. Even if you have to drive
400-odd miles to see it. I'm going to crawl if I have to.' grab me a front -
row seat, and shriek my lungs out every time this Christie lug fouls.
The ref is either going to toss him or me out of the ballgame.

And while talking about the CCNY Beavers, who on Friday night were
the greatest group of cagers ever assembled and who suddenly became
just so many dubs an evening later, I must pass on some of the little items
which came drifting out of the Cow Palace mist; and, pals, it was misty.
What time does the game start.' Stanford is still warming up." (That
was about eight minutes into the game.)
"Isn't that Stanford's Defensive Ace—yes. right there, the person that
little New York guy just ran by."
"Where's the new Hank Luisetti?"

squad put together."
"If we had five Dave Davidsons, we could beat those guys."
Look, Milt Iverson can pass as fancy as those .... whoops, New

Stanford Still Has Stuff
Now don't get me wrong and think that I'm trying to run down Stan
lord's basketball team. I'm not. I have watched them play too many
games this season. They are good basketball men. Besides that, they stiil
own one ol the best clubs in the country.
Individually and collectively, Stanford has got what it takes to "beat
anybody. Sure, undefeated Hamline, CCNY, USF over and over, the Tro
jans, California anbody. With the right mental attitude, that is.
Lately, the mental attitude has been "What the hell." And to quote
a fellow who has his stuff running over at the Park Theater, "Something
is rotten in Denmark."
The ieasons for the decline and fall of the 9th-best-team-in-the-nation
run almost parallel to those of an old Western Civ subject, the Roman
Empire.
Indians Getting Soft
First, the Indians have become too soft. They have had too much success
at an easy price, and it has gotten to the place where they don't like to
trade blows with hard working slugs who obviously don't have their class.
And the Indians just reek class. If it's just a case of a battle between
i ancy-Dans (a la USF and Stanford), you can usually be safe in chalking
up another Card win, but when Troy's gorilla-men, Bud Pelka, Stan
Christie, and Joe White, start tossing their heft around, the results will
be brutal.
Which brings us right back to this little shindig coming up Friday night.
Stanford has to win this one. In the Los Angeles fight arena, Olympic
Auditorium by name, the Cards will have to go uphill all the way.
If, If, If
But the Deanmen can win if they play their ballgame; if they just get
down to business, USC will be victim number 18.
But it will take a different team from the one we have seen for the past
two weekends. It will take a hungry bunch of fighters who really want
to get out and go. The Deanmen have the polish, now's the best time io
shine. Its their stiffest test of the season.
And loi sure, it isn t a game to be missed. Even if you have to drive
400-odd miles to see it. I'm going to crawl if I have to.' grab me a front -
row seat, and shriek my lungs out every time this Christie lug fouls.
The ref is either going to toss him or me out of the ballgame.
If King Stanford—oh, pardon me, I mean Chump Stanford—doesn't get
cti the dime this Friday night, our local cage hotshots are going to get
a nasty going-over by USC's burly thugs down in LA's smoke-filled Olym
pic Auditorium.
And that's no kidding, gentlemen. Those Trojans are tough, mean, ugly,
ngeiessive, and brutal, and that just ain't the way our boys want to plav.

monsters have already smeared Stanford's slate once and will not hesitate
to push the Cards in the puss as many times as possible.
Five Straight for Troy
For the record, USC has bested Everett bean's students five straight
umes now, the last one being a 56-46 affair which Stanford had been
iavored to win. Last year it was four out of four.

trade blows with hard working slugs who obviously don't have their class.
And the Indians just reek class. If it's just a case of a battle between
i ancy-Dans (a la USF and Stanford), you can usually be safe in chalking
up another Card win, but when Troy's gorilla-men, Bud Pelka, Stan
Christie, and Joe White, start tossing their heft around, the results will
be brutal.
Which brings us right back to this little shindig coming up Friday night.
Stanford has to win this one. In the Los Angeles fight arena, Olympic
Auditorium by name, the Cards will have to go uphill all the way.
If, If, If
But the Deanmen can win if they play their ballgame; if they just get
down to business, USC will be victim number 18.
But it will take a different team from the one we have seen for the past
two weekends. It will take a hungry bunch of fighters who really want
to get out and go. The Deanmen have the polish, now's the best time io
shine. Its their stiffest test of the season.
And loi sure, it isn t a game to be missed. Even if you have to drive
400-odd miles to see it. I'm going to crawl if I have to.' grab me a front -
row seat, and shriek my lungs out every time this Christie lug fouls.
The ref is either going to toss him or me out of the ballgame.
If King Stanford—oh, pardon me, I mean Chump Stanford—doesn't get
cti the dime this Friday night, our local cage hotshots are going to get
a nasty going-over by USC's burly thugs down in LA's smoke-filled Olym
pic Auditorium.
And that's no kidding, gentlemen. Those Trojans are tough, mean, ugly,
ngeiessive, and brutal, and that just ain't the way our boys want to plav.
Ihe trouble being that Stanford has to play USC in order to step for
ward in its journey to the Southern Division Crown.
b tan lord s seasonal record of 17 wins and only 3 losses is sweet-sounding
indeed, but it isn t going to mean one holy heck to El Troje, whose cage
monsters have already smeared Stanford's slate once and will not hesitate
to push the Cards in the puss as many times as possible.
Five Straight for Troy
For the record, USC has bested Everett bean's students five straight
umes now, the last one being a 56-46 affair which Stanford had been
iavored to win. Last year it was four out of four.
And how do they do it, sir? Backboard control, sir, control, will
to win, and by Sam, the old college try. USC has won 9 games against 7
oefeats so lar this season, and compared to Stanford's majestic record,
that s alfalfa feed.
But USC will beat Stanford if all it has to do is go after the ball. That
l a.- been the theme song of Stanford's recent foes. Play the Cards tough
and you ve .wot 'em. Little punk San Jose almost got away with it USC

Cow Palace Quotes
And while talking about the CCNY Beavers, who on Friday night were
the greatest group of cagers ever assembled and who suddenly became
just so many dubs an evening later, I must pass on some of the little items
which came drifting out of the Cow Palace mist; and, pals, it was misty.
What time does the game start.' Stanford is still warming up." (That
was about eight minutes into the game.)
"Isn't that Stanford's Defensive Ace—yes. right there, the person that
little New York guy just ran by."
"Where's the new Hank Luisetti?"
(it ez. Coach Buinett down there has more fire than the rest of the
squad put together."
"If we had five Dave Davidsons, we could beat those guys."
Look, Milt Iverson can pass as fancy as those .... whoops, New
York has got the ball again!"
Stanford Still Has Stuff
Now don't get me wrong and think that I'm trying to run down Stan
lord's basketball team. I'm not. I have watched them play too many
games this season. They are good basketball men. Besides that, they stiil
own one ol the best clubs in the country.
Individually and collectively, Stanford has got what it takes to "beat
anybody. Sure, undefeated Hamline, CCNY, USF over and over, the Tro
jans, California anbody. With the right mental attitude, that is.
Lately, the mental attitude has been "What the hell." And to quote
a fellow who has his stuff running over at the Park Theater, "Something
is rotten in Denmark."
The ieasons for the decline and fall of the 9th-best-team-in-the-nation
run almost parallel to those of an old Western Civ subject, the Roman
Empire.
