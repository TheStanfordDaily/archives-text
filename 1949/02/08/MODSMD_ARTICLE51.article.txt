# Successful Swimming Season Predicted by Coach Haynie
## 
### 
B\ AL BERIiY
The most engaging thing about
Indian swimming coach Tom Hay
nie is that he calls a spade a spade,
and has seemingly become inca
pable of moaning and groaning
ahoui t!lines to come. Ii he thinks
his mob of tanksters are going to
win, he says so. Yesterday he said
so.
"We have had 33 consecutive
wins," he srid, "and I don't see any
reason why we should stop now."
Remembering the past and look
ing, mystic-'ike, at the future, Hay
nie said. "'I think we had a good
team last \var and this year's team
will be just as good, if not better,
than last year's." That •'pood" team
of year swept the PCC—win
ning all but two events, set a mad
dening number of new records, anM
completed the third straight year
that Stanford has remained unde
feated in dual meets.
San Jose First
This dual meet record will get its
first 1949 test on Feb. 22, when the
loaded Cardinals visit San Jose
State to show the Spartans that
Stanford can win in ways less of
fensive than last-minute dashes.
The only depreciable losses from
last year's championship squad
came with the graduation of rec
ord-setter Bob Anderson and 100
freestyler Dick Narver. "We'll miss
the great Bob Anderson and Nar
ver, but in the sprints their loss
merely means that we won't win by
as far as we have been," said the
affable Mr. Haynie. Chief candidate
to splash in Anderson's 50 and Nar
ver's IGO are last year's point-get
ters Harry Borchers and Woody
Hoogs. Behind them in the sprints
are lettermen Major, Mead, and
Cutting, and some likelv up-from
the-frosh freestylers, Kelly, Horack.
and Patch.
Farm tank followers have heard a
lot about Bob Wycoff, a likely
young man. who in an unofficial
clocking early this year tied Bob
Anderson's sensational PCC 50-vard

freestyle record of 22.8. This year,
however, WycofT is a freshman and
thus ineligible for varsity compe
tition. Make way for new lrosh rec
ords!
The number one nugget of this
year's tank team is water polo Ail-
Coaster Ralph Sala. In the '20 and
440 Sala's times ai'e such that he
will, in all probability, not do worse
ihan tirst all season. Hayni. l had a
quote on Ralph also, "If I lake any
swimmers to the national swimming
meets at the University of North
Carolina this year, I will expect
Sala to win the 4(!() as well as the
1,500 freestyle." Sala, with typical
explosiveness, had no comment to
make on this statement.
Weedens Top Backst lokers
Don Hester, who completely shat
tered the FCC 200-yard breaststroke
record (2:23.3) last year, will be
back to lead butterflyers Ed Fenstad
and Marsha'l Pearlin to win the
breaststroke conquests. The fellows
who lie on their backs and watch
the blimps will be led by Jack
VVeeden and his sophomore brother
Don. Jack won the 150 backstroke
in the PCC tourney from runner-up
Rupe Wolf of Troy, with little dif
ficulty past the 50-yard mark.
All in all, it looks like another
uneventful season in the LSJU
tanks, with the Big Red Swimming
Machine torpedoing any and all
competition. The Big Meet will be
with USC, which has "the best
swimming team in Trojan history."
But the pre-season pickers say it
will be the Cards all the way, so
until—and pardon the big 'it"—SC
shows they "got it,"the crospects
will be no moral victories lor any
body—just big scoreboard wins for
Haynie's hilarious tanksters.

The most engaging thing about
Indian swimming coach Tom Hay
nie is that he calls a spade a spade,
and has seemingly become inca
pable of moaning and groaning
ahoui t!lines to come. Ii he thinks
his mob of tanksters are going to
win, he says so. Yesterday he said
so.
"We have had 33 consecutive
wins," he srid, "and I don't see any
reason why we should stop now."
Remembering the past and look
ing, mystic-'ike, at the future, Hay
nie said. "'I think we had a good
team last \var and this year's team
will be just as good, if not better,
than last year's." That •'pood" team
of year swept the PCC—win
ning all but two events, set a mad
dening number of new records, anM
completed the third straight year
that Stanford has remained unde
feated in dual meets.
San Jose First
This dual meet record will get its
first 1949 test on Feb. 22, when the
loaded Cardinals visit San Jose
State to show the Spartans that
Stanford can win in ways less of
fensive than last-minute dashes.
The only depreciable losses from
last year's championship squad
came with the graduation of rec
ord-setter Bob Anderson and 100
freestyler Dick Narver. "We'll miss
the great Bob Anderson and Nar
ver, but in the sprints their loss
merely means that we won't win by
as far as we have been," said the
affable Mr. Haynie. Chief candidate
to splash in Anderson's 50 and Nar
ver's IGO are last year's point-get
ters Harry Borchers and Woody
Hoogs. Behind them in the sprints
are lettermen Major, Mead, and
Cutting, and some likelv up-from
the-frosh freestylers, Kelly, Horack.

Farm tank followers have heard a
lot about Bob Wycoff, a likely
young man. who in an unofficial
clocking early this year tied Bob
Anderson's sensational PCC 50-vard

freestyle record of 22.8. This year,
however, WycofT is a freshman and
thus ineligible for varsity compe
tition. Make way for new lrosh rec

The number one nugget of this
year's tank team is water polo Ail-
Coaster Ralph Sala. In the '20 and
440 Sala's times ai'e such that he
will, in all probability, not do worse
ihan tirst all season. Hayni. l had a
quote on Ralph also, "If I lake any
swimmers to the national swimming
meets at the University of North
Carolina this year, I will expect
Sala to win the 4(!() as well as the
1,500 freestyle." Sala, with typical
explosiveness, had no comment to
