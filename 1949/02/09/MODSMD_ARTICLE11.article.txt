# Women's Council (Short Term)

'"Women's Council must use its
combined judgment, knowledge,
and understanding in matters that
come before it. However, it must
be concerned, not only with indi

vidual cases, but with how its de
cisions affect Stanford women as a
group. I sincerely want to serve on
the next Council."
SAC
RALPH A. SALA
"Too long the Stanford Athletic
Council has been an inactive 'yes
man' io Mr. A 1 Masters & Co.—it's
about time we regain STUDENT
CONTROL OF STUDENT ATH
LETICS, and the best way to do it
is through an ACTIVE SAC."
BILL DE YOUNG
"1. SAC is now virtually power
less. I shall try to make it a real
organ of student opinion and not
just a rubber stamp for A 1 Masters.
"2. Athletic receipts should go to
building a new Pavilion.
"3. Basketball tickets should be
distributed so that everyone can see
some games."
JOSEPH "BUDDY" SCOTT
"Money derived from athletics
should be put back into the athletic
fund. At the present time, the mon
ey derived from athletics goes to
the administration, and an inade
quate budget taken from this money
is doled out to athletics. That is
why our minor sports such as rugby
and the crew are suffering from in
sufficient funds."
