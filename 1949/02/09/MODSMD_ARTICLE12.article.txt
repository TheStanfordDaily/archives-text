"I do not think a prudent one
Will ever aim too high;
A cockroach seldom whips a dog,
And seldom should he try."
HOWARD LEWIS
"What is needed most on Men's
Council is that uncommon quality,
common sense. Balance, perspec
tive, integrityâ€”whatever name we
use, this quality means constructive
action appropriate to existing cir
cumstances. If elected to short
term Men's Council, I will try to
provide this constructive action."
