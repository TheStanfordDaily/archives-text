LILLIAN DURHAM
"Every woman on campus needs !
a liberal and understanding repre
sentative on Women's Council. Un
biased opinion on Women's Coun
cil is guaranteed by Lillian Dur- j
ham."
MARILYN SCHWARTZ
"With the new Demerit system,
responsibility of upholding regula
tions is passing from a body of five
girls to each woman student. I feel
that in order to be sure that any |
changes Council may propose in
these regulations are the will of the
majority, close contact must be i
maintained between the two groups. j
If elected, this would be my goal."
CARRIE LANE
"I am very much interested in i
Women's Council. I realize that it
is a very demanding position, but j
if elected I would do my very best
to serve you."
CORKY MESERVE
"As the duties of a Women's '
Council member consist of render
ing decisions in individual cases, |
the qualifications needed are under
standing, keenness of judgment,
and a friendly, helpful attitude. My [
background includes two quarters
on an area committee and a strong ,
interest in Women's Council work, j
I would like to see the Council op- ;
erated efficiently and in a unified j
manner."
CAROL SPERO
"Every decision must be careful- I

ly weighed, for we seek a delicate
balance*"-â€”between fairness of un
derstanding for each person, an<. :
respect for the interests of the
community."
ELOISE BEIL
"Interest and experience on com
mittees of nine are my major rea
sons lor running for Women's Coun
cil. The new demerit system will
probably add a great deal more re
sponsibility to Council, and, i:
elected, I would try to follow the
wishes of the greatest number of
girls and to exercise fair and ma
ture judgment at all times."
DIAttE BROWN
"I have come into contact with
women's social problems on the
Row and in dormitories. Thus I fee',
that I have enough understanding
to help you solve your social prob
lems. I would deeply appreciate the
opportunity to serve you not only
as a member but :>lso as a friend or.
Women's Council."
DORIS COOPER
( 'A position on Women's Counci!
is one of the most challenging job-;
at Stanford today. With the demerit
system in operation and Council
functioning as a court of appeals,
the consideration of each case must
be more individual. I would sin
cerely enjoy working on Council ir.
an effort to make the transition
from lockout to demerit system a
step forward for Stanford women."
BETTE ACUFF
"We're all interested in making
the demerit system work. Because
it is new, and on trial, so to speak,
we will want to elect Council mem
bers who have understanding, ar
objective attitude, and a willingness
to co-operate with the individual
girl in working out a fair solution
to her problem.
'"My main rason for running for
Council is just plain interest, and I
would like to have the opportunity
to try to make the demerit system
work better and more effectively
for Stanford girls than the lockout
system did,"
