# "Help SIRO, Help Berlin!" Adopted as Relief Slogan
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
"Help SIRO, help Berlin!" This
slogan carried the meaning of the
present SIRO drive to collect books,
clothes, and various other small but
useful items for the students at the
Free University of Berlin.
Heavy winter clothing is espe
cially needed by the Berlin stu
dents. Many of them are refugees
from the Russian - controlled old
University of Berlin. In fleeing the
Russian sector they were able to
take only a few belongings with
ihem.
Children's clothes are also need
ed, as a large number of the stu
dents aup married and have chil
dren.
Books and school supplies are
very difficult to obtain because of
the blockade. The few offered are
at exorbitant, prices. The Free Uni
versity has but the beginnings of a
library, for most of the old collec
tion of books had to be left at the
old University. Technical books—
science, math—can be used espe
cially.
All donations turned in either to
the SIRO office or to SIRO repre

sentatives in (lie living groups this
week will be flown directly to the
University by air lift. This is being
done by WSSF and the Church
World Service, tree of charge to
SIRO.
SIRO has asked for needles,
thread, pins, yarn, and soap in ad
dition to clothing and books. These
are small items easily obtained here
which are equally unobtainable in
Berlin.
In order for the winter clothing to
reach Berlin in time to be of use
this winter, it must be sent across
this weekend. SIRO needs students
to help pack the clothing all this
week. Anyone wishing to help may
report to the SIRO oflice in the IIR
shack any day this week.
Clothing donations may always be
made to SIRO, but anything do
nated this week will be earmarked
for the Free University of Berlin.
