# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Look Before Voting

Probably the most important offices appearing on today's
ASSU ballot will be those for Men's and Women's Council.
Because these Councils uphold the principles of the Honor
Code and the Fundamental Standard, their positions are actually
the most powerful in student government.
Recent Daily editorials have resulted in increased student in- j
lerest in both Councils. Because of the large number of candi- j
dates running for the positions, we, as voters, can be more se
lective than ever before in our choices.
We would like to see Council members elected upon the basis
of excellent qualifications and personal merit—rather than upon
campaign promises. Because neither Council is a politically con
trolled body, political promises cannot be fulfilled.
Neither are the Councils police organizations. Each body re
views cases involving violations of student regulations and rec
ommends penalties to the Dean of Students. Women's Council,
however, has the additional responsibility of suggesting changes
in women's social regulations.
The future success of the operation of the Councils depends'
upon the caliber of students elected today. Look before voting.
