## Landlord Lowers Rent 
### 
To the Editor:
This letter is intended to be an open letter to all landlords in the Palo
Alto area.
Having had a ehild for the last two and one-half years, and not being
financially able to purchase a home of our own while 1 am in school, my
wife and I have been among the multitude of victims of the post-war
housing shortage.
Those in similar positions can readily sympathize.
Fortunately, a year ago we found a large, comfortable, fully-furnished
home in College Terrace for which we have been paying $75 per month.
We felt this to be a very fair price, for we have a great many friends and
acquaintances who are paying considerably more for much smaller, un
furnished houses in less desirable districts.
We just received a letter from our landlord from which I quote in part:
"As the general level of prices has begun to decline. I have the feeling
that rents should move in the same direction. If agreeable to you (and,
believe me, it was!) I will be satisfied with $60 a month . . . . "
The purpose of this letter is to give much-needed encouragement to
those families in positions similar to ours. All landlords are not blood
suckers, but I will support the view that too many of them are not far
removed from being such. However, as long as there are a few landlords
such as ours, the situation is not hopeless.
It is my sincere hope that this letter, mild as it is, will cause more
than one Palo Alto landlord to shudder at the thought of facing his over
charged tengnts. It would give me an equal amount of pleasure to think
that this letter might act as the necessary instrument for some overcharged
tenant to employ in compelling his landlord to reduce the rent to a fair
level.
