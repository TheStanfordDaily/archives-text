# Bird Study Nostalgia
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Your Mr. Farkas' article about the need for a bird-study club and
beer on campus, caused a wave of nostalgia to sweep over me. I've cut
my study down from 17 hours a day to 10 hours, and I spend the addi
tional seven hours reminiscing.
Mr. Farkas does not know it, but he has hit on two apparently diverse
topics which actually go hand-in-hand in a most pleasant way.
While attending Pomona College, I was a member of the Indian Bird
Study and Marching Club which hauled up into the hills behind Clare
nont every Saturday afternoon with a couple of kegs of beer. There our
bird watching began.
Until the uke playing got too loud, many different bird species were
reported and we had a petition up to get school credit from the zoology
department.
1 must say lhat this sort of cultural endeavor must bo limited to men
as if you let women know they will come up and find you when you've
Â£,ot your eye on an owl or an ostrich.
