To the Editor:
Stripped of all the unnecessary references to "Russia's standard of liv
ing," the "Iron Curtain," and "sailing schedules to far-away places,"
Kenneth B. Valentine's letter on the Washington University faculty case
boils down to this: Civil Liberties? Of course I'm for them—but not for
everybody!"
Can we deny to some people these rights and still claim they exist?
