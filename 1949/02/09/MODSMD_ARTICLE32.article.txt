Louis Adamic in "Dynamite,"
quoting the "Rise of American Civ
i ilization" by Charles and Mary
| Beard: "... cigarettes were
wrapped in hundred dollar bills;
j fine black pearls were given to the
| diners in their oysters . . . with mon
keys seated between guests, human
! goldfish swimming about in pools,
! and chorus girls hopping out of pies
Edmund Burke in "Reflections on
the French Revolution": "The degree
| of estimation in which any profes
j sion is held becomes the standard
j of the estimation in which the pro
fessors hold themselves."
Anatole France in "The Gods Are
Athirst"': "Since Homer began it, it
i has always been a mania with poets,
! this extolling the powers of lighting
i men. War is not an art, and luck
| alone decides the fate of battles.
With two generals, both blockheads,
; face to face, one of them must in
evitably be victorious. Wait till
| some day one oi these warriors you
make gods of, swallows you all up
like the stork in the fable who gob
bles up the frogs. Ah! then he
would be really and truly a god!
For you can always tell the gods
by their appetite."

Edmund Burke in "Reflections on
the French Revolution": "The degree
| of estimation in which any profes
j sion is held becomes the standard
j of the estimation in which the pro
fessors hold themselves."
Anatole France in "The Gods Are
Athirst"': "Since Homer began it, it
i has always been a mania with poets,
! this extolling the powers of lighting
i men. War is not an art, and luck
| alone decides the fate of battles.
With two generals, both blockheads,
; face to face, one of them must in
evitably be victorious. Wait till
| some day one oi these warriors you
make gods of, swallows you all up
like the stork in the fable who gob
bles up the frogs. Ah! then he
would be really and truly a god!
For you can always tell the gods
by their appetite."
Excerpts from the "New York
Times":
"Along the Highways and Byways
of Finance by Robert 11. Fetridge:
I"The new $20 currency bills picture
i the south front of the White House,
as usual, but with the addition of
the 'Truman Porch'."
"Education in Review" by Benja
min Fine: ". . . . the majority would
i not retain an avowed Communist on
j their campuses . . . They concluded
; that membership in a totalitarian
; party made a professor unfit to do an
; honest job of teaching American
j youth . . . Basically the nation's edu
[ cators agree on the issue of aca
-1 demie freedom. They insist that the
j right of the professor to his own
J opinions should remain inviolate.
| They jealously guard the principles
j of classroom and campus freedom
i that have evolved through the years.
! At the same time they are convinced
that a line must be drawn at some
point beyond which even academic
1 freedom must not go."
