## IT SEZ HERE:

Intrepid Daily reporter Ignatz Ub beat his way through the interminable
jungles of the islands on the Quad, and emerged in front of the Law Libe.
Casting discretion to the winds, Ub panhandled the first strolling student
he came upon for his morning cigaret, and engaged Sleepyhead in con
versation.
' What's new, friend?"
"Uh?"
"Well, as I see it, if they don't hurry up and bring beer to the students,
the students will just have to go to the beer. Any reasonable man would
understand the situation, and were he of ordinary prudence and caution,
would he not rally to the glorious cause of beer on campus, posthaste?
What say, l'liend?"
"Uh?"
(Gad, he sounds like somebody from the freshman football team, thought
our hero.)
"Beer! Beer! You know the stuff; at Encina they drink it, at Roble
they wash their hair in it. Beer! Beer!"
"Uh?"
Ignatz Ub slunk back to his jungle lair, and, as the elephant grass
ciosed behind him, he turned for one last look at Bigmouth. potential all-
America timber, and, curling his lip disdainfully, he muttered:
"Bah, an athlete; a teetotaler. Bah!"
Ub was depressed, understandably, and leaving the safety of his jungle
once again appeared on Quad, this time hurrying toward the darkroom
hideout of his sidekick, the intrepid Daily photographer Alphone Goose.
Leaving Ub behind for a moment, let us set the scene for the next act.
Sitting in the noonday sun, Miss Olga Urp ('49) gazes avidly as a steam
shovel voraciously rips the guts from the ground preparatory to the
building of a new men's John behind the old men's John.
Miss Urp is third assistant vice-president of the Stanford Sidewalk
Superintendents (also known as steamshovel kibitzers), and has cut three
8 o'clocks this week in order to get an early start on her hobby. Miss
Urp is not a teetotaler; she is not a teetotaler.
Into the scene come Ub and Goose, the latter loaded down with the
paraphernalia of his calling— plateholders, bulbs, reflectors, Brownie—
which he distributes about the landscape prior to snapping Miss Urp.
Miss Urp (to Üb): Haven't I seen you someplace else before? Dinah's?
L Ommie's? Longbarn's? maybe? Oh, I remember now, you're the shnook
that interviewed me about seeing a crow; don't deny it. I never forget a
face. Well, for your information, it wasn't a crow at all. It was my room
mate I saw. I didn't know until I got home. She had a date with a yoyo
from the flying club. She said he was harder to handle than eight men.
Naturally, she walked home.
Üb: What's this racket about watching a steamshovel?
Miss Urp: The SSS is a non-profitable group of students devoted to ob
serving the University's building program in the raw. We have students
stationed at Stern Hall, Law School, Microwave Lab, power and pipe lines,
and here. I'm the committee for the new men's John. Every Monday we
meet in the Nitery and discuss what we've seen. We feel we are an
integral part of University life because we have such a deep interest in
Stanford.
Üb: What do you think of beer on campus?
Miss Urp: I'd love some; I'll be ready at 8.
Goose: Now, Olga, stand a little closer to the hole. That's right, back
up just a little more. Just a little more. That's good. Hold it! Olga.
Olga! Miss Urp! Miss Urp!
