## Debates Continue As China Falls 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
For months American editorial
writers and speakers played the
semi-sophisticated game of "appcla
tion-tabbing."
One side would say: "The Chinese
'Communists' aren't really Commies
at all. They're actually devout,
hard-working, long-suffering Chi
nese peasants who actually would
love to wallow in the puddle of capi
talism if they could only have the
chance—and so they're making their
own chance.
"After all, that's what we Ameri
cans did in our revolution. We got
sick of the way things were going,
so we upped and bopped the ones
that were guilty of intimidation and
imperialism."
While China was in convulsions,
the oilier side in this little game
said:
"The Chinese Communists are just
that. Mao Tse Tung and the other
Communist leaders received the
Gospel in Moscow and went back to
China to spread it. The Chinese
Communists have contemptuously
referred to Americans as imperial
ists and people to be despised. What
has happened in China is the great
est victory of Joseph Stalin's bunch
since the October Revolution.
"We should give (now it's 'should
have given') Chiang Kai-Shek and
the Chinese Nationalists active
overt aid. China is the shiniest ap
ple of the Far East; if we allow its
infection by the Red disease, the
whole barrel will soon putrefy and
rot. The Nationalists are the type of
Democrats most complementary to
the American preferences and ideals
So the game went, over Town
Meeting of the Air, and in the big
magazines. The game continued as
the putrefaction continued in thr
land of Confucius.
Round two of the game is here.
We see that the Communists now al
most have China under their samo
var. Well, they that play this game

reason: "Let's accept this fait ac
compli; its a Communist China,
more or less. But why worry?
China is immense and immutable.
It has met and in good time—swal
lowed and digested, with but little
heartburn, such extraneous forces as
the Mongol hordes, foreign religions,
famines, and the Japanese."
It was unfortunate that our State
Department, presumably willful and
perspicacious, became immersed in
vacillation. It was unfortunate that
the brain power available to the de
mocracies did not get together for a
superlative effort to win the all
important hand in China.
It was more unfortunate for the
Chinese that they did not do some
thing lastingly effective towards
creating a modern democratic state.
Admittedly this is not so easy when
a large group of Reds inimically
try to forestall such a creation.
Now it is redundant to castigate
the self-destroying propensities of
the conglomerate grouping which
surrounded Chiang Kai Shek and
his own effacious oredilictions.
Part of the totai weakness, it ap
pears to us over here, was the Chi
nese leaders' trait of opportunism
and the lack of a true spirit of na
tional co-operation. We're aware,
too. of other contributing factors.
Now Mao's Red tide will control
China. We shall sec not a swallow
ing of the Communists like the game
players hope—not in the near future,
anyway. The Commies will leave
more than an impact on China. And
now the Communist nations may
have two voices on the Security
Council and other UN bodies, so
their influence is internationally
strengthened as well.
We doubt deeply that we shall
see a modified, more democratic,
more humanitarian, more capital
istic China emerge.
What can we learn from this?
This has been like a sec-sawing bas
ketball game for tremendous stakes
the championship of the World

League. It seems the world. Commu
nists are the fast-break boys. They
have also been controlling the back
boards more often of late. So we
made some nice shots in the Bene
lux, Atlantic Pact, Balkan Investi
gating Commission, Marshall Plan,
and Truman Plan tosses. The latter,
though, is teetering on the hoop rim
in Greece. That's a good place to
begin—let's tip that one in.
Let's start sharpening up the
shooting eye —diplomatically, eco
nomically, and politically. Let's
start breaking faster with that ball;
let's j,?t control of it once again. The
Communist side, we're fearful, has
just made a 10-point lead through
the China shots, and there are about
eight minutes to go in the game. We
face the prospect of having them
freeze the ball in their Cold War.

begin—let's tip that one in.
Let's start sharpening up the
shooting eye —diplomatically, eco
nomically, and politically. Let's
start breaking faster with that ball;
let's j,?t control of it once again. The
Communist side, we're fearful, has
just made a 10-point lead through
the China shots, and there are about
eight minutes to go in the game. We
face the prospect of having them
freeze the ball in their Cold War.
For months American editorial
writers and speakers played the
semi-sophisticated game of "appcla
tion-tabbing."
One side would say: "The Chinese
'Communists' aren't really Commies
at all. They're actually devout,
hard-working, long-suffering Chi
nese peasants who actually would
love to wallow in the puddle of capi
talism if they could only have the
chance—and so they're making their
own chance.
"After all, that's what we Ameri
cans did in our revolution. We got
sick of the way things were going,
so we upped and bopped the ones
that were guilty of intimidation and
imperialism."
While China was in convulsions,
the oilier side in this little game
said:
"The Chinese Communists are just
that. Mao Tse Tung and the other
Communist leaders received the
Gospel in Moscow and went back to
China to spread it. The Chinese
Communists have contemptuously
referred to Americans as imperial
ists and people to be despised. What
has happened in China is the great
est victory of Joseph Stalin's bunch
since the October Revolution.
"We should give (now it's 'should
have given') Chiang Kai-Shek and
the Chinese Nationalists active
overt aid. China is the shiniest ap
ple of the Far East; if we allow its
infection by the Red disease, the
whole barrel will soon putrefy and
rot. The Nationalists are the type of
Democrats most complementary to
the American preferences and ideals
So the game went, over Town
Meeting of the Air, and in the big
magazines. The game continued as
the putrefaction continued in thr
land of Confucius.
Round two of the game is here.
We see that the Communists now al
most have China under their samo
var. Well, they that play this game

reason: "Let's accept this fait ac
compli; its a Communist China,
more or less. But why worry?
China is immense and immutable.
It has met and in good time—swal
lowed and digested, with but little
heartburn, such extraneous forces as
the Mongol hordes, foreign religions,
famines, and the Japanese."
It was unfortunate that our State
Department, presumably willful and
perspicacious, became immersed in
vacillation. It was unfortunate that
the brain power available to the de
mocracies did not get together for a
superlative effort to win the all
important hand in China.
It was more unfortunate for the
Chinese that they did not do some
thing lastingly effective towards
creating a modern democratic state.
Admittedly this is not so easy when
a large group of Reds inimically
try to forestall such a creation.
Now it is redundant to castigate
the self-destroying propensities of
the conglomerate grouping which
surrounded Chiang Kai Shek and
his own effacious oredilictions.
Part of the totai weakness, it ap
pears to us over here, was the Chi
nese leaders' trait of opportunism
and the lack of a true spirit of na
tional co-operation. We're aware,
too. of other contributing factors.
Now Mao's Red tide will control
China. We shall sec not a swallow
ing of the Communists like the game
players hope—not in the near future,
anyway. The Commies will leave
more than an impact on China. And
now the Communist nations may
have two voices on the Security
Council and other UN bodies, so
their influence is internationally
strengthened as well.
We doubt deeply that we shall
see a modified, more democratic,
more humanitarian, more capital
istic China emerge.
What can we learn from this?
This has been like a sec-sawing bas
ketball game for tremendous stakes
the championship of the World

League. It seems the world. Commu
nists are the fast-break boys. They
have also been controlling the back
boards more often of late. So we
made some nice shots in the Bene
lux, Atlantic Pact, Balkan Investi
gating Commission, Marshall Plan,
and Truman Plan tosses. The latter,
though, is teetering on the hoop rim

This has been like a sec-sawing bas
ketball game for tremendous stakes
the championship of the World

League. It seems the world. Commu
nists are the fast-break boys. They
have also been controlling the back
boards more often of late. So we
made some nice shots in the Bene
lux, Atlantic Pact, Balkan Investi
gating Commission, Marshall Plan,
and Truman Plan tosses. The latter,
though, is teetering on the hoop rim
in Greece. That's a good place to
begin—let's tip that one in.
Let's start sharpening up the
shooting eye —diplomatically, eco
nomically, and politically. Let's
start breaking faster with that ball;
let's j,?t control of it once again. The
Communist side, we're fearful, has
just made a 10-point lead through
the China shots, and there are about
eight minutes to go in the game. We
face the prospect of having them
freeze the ball in their Cold War.
For months American editorial
writers and speakers played the
semi-sophisticated game of "appcla
tion-tabbing."
One side would say: "The Chinese
'Communists' aren't really Commies
at all. They're actually devout,
hard-working, long-suffering Chi
nese peasants who actually would
love to wallow in the puddle of capi
talism if they could only have the
chance—and so they're making their
own chance.
"After all, that's what we Ameri
cans did in our revolution. We got
sick of the way things were going,
so we upped and bopped the ones
that were guilty of intimidation and
imperialism."
While China was in convulsions,
the oilier side in this little game
said:
"The Chinese Communists are just
that. Mao Tse Tung and the other
Communist leaders received the
Gospel in Moscow and went back to
China to spread it. The Chinese
Communists have contemptuously
referred to Americans as imperial
ists and people to be despised. What
has happened in China is the great
est victory of Joseph Stalin's bunch
since the October Revolution.
"We should give (now it's 'should
have given') Chiang Kai-Shek and
the Chinese Nationalists active
overt aid. China is the shiniest ap
ple of the Far East; if we allow its
infection by the Red disease, the
whole barrel will soon putrefy and
rot. The Nationalists are the type of
Democrats most complementary to
the American preferences and ideals
So the game went, over Town
Meeting of the Air, and in the big
magazines. The game continued as
the putrefaction continued in thr
land of Confucius.
Round two of the game is here.
We see that the Communists now al
most have China under their samo
var. Well, they that play this game

reason: "Let's accept this fait ac
compli; its a Communist China,
more or less. But why worry?
China is immense and immutable.
It has met and in good time—swal
lowed and digested, with but little
heartburn, such extraneous forces as
the Mongol hordes, foreign religions,
famines, and the Japanese."
It was unfortunate that our State
Department, presumably willful and
perspicacious, became immersed in
vacillation. It was unfortunate that
the brain power available to the de
mocracies did not get together for a
superlative effort to win the all
important hand in China.
It was more unfortunate for the
Chinese that they did not do some
thing lastingly effective towards
creating a modern democratic state.
Admittedly this is not so easy when
a large group of Reds inimically
try to forestall such a creation.
Now it is redundant to castigate
the self-destroying propensities of
the conglomerate grouping which
surrounded Chiang Kai Shek and
his own effacious oredilictions.
Part of the totai weakness, it ap
pears to us over here, was the Chi
nese leaders' trait of opportunism
and the lack of a true spirit of na
tional co-operation. We're aware,
too. of other contributing factors.
Now Mao's Red tide will control
China. We shall sec not a swallow
ing of the Communists like the game
players hope—not in the near future,
anyway. The Commies will leave
more than an impact on China. And
now the Communist nations may
have two voices on the Security
Council and other UN bodies, so
their influence is internationally
strengthened as well.
We doubt deeply that we shall
see a modified, more democratic,
more humanitarian, more capital
istic China emerge.
