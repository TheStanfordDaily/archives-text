# Pilots Have Beds In Future Planes
## 
### 
DAYTON. 0.. Feb. 6 (#).—The
Aii Force may have its pilots lie
down to fly super-last airplanes in
the future.
The Aero-Medical Laboratory of
nearby Wright Field disclosed to
day the development of a "prone
position pilot bed" that allows pilots
to withstand about three times as
much strain from gravity before
blacking out.
During centrifuge tests, said the
Air Force, pilots in the prone posi
tion withstood 12 G's— 12 times the
pull of gravity—for a given time
without blackout.
Pilots in the normal sitting po
sition can tolerate only about 4'j
to 5 G's.
Wright Field's experts pointed to
a number of advantages for the
prone position: it adds a safety fac
tor and eliminates much of the ac
cident possibility of blackouts; it
requires less space for the cockpit,
permitting aircraft with slin .er
and speedier silhouettes.
