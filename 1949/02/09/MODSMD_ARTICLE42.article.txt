eight starts, the Stanford Frosh cage 1
team will £et back in action after a i
week's lapse when they challenge |
: n up-and-coming Sequoia High |
(jUintet Saturday morning at 10:30.
With the good news that center j
."im Ramstead is finally off the in- '
ured list and will be ready to !
-start, the Frosh five will be heavy |
avorites to beat the league-leading •
Cherokees on Saturday.
Bob Burnett, regular Papoose
coach, will make the trip to Los |
Angeles with the varsity team, so
ihe Braves' coach, Phil Bengtson, i
•vill guide the Frosh this weekend. I
The Papooses have been stressing |
practice on a tight zone defense this j
week which can be used inter- ;
hatigeably with their successful j
pressing man-to-man guarding'.
Last week's convincing double ,
victory over Lincoln High of San
and Palo Alto High, places
he Frosh team high among the Bay
\rea yearling quintets. The Pa- !
oooses hold two victories over the i
Bear Cubs already this season, and j
:eed onlv one more win to clinch

their traditional series. All prep foes
have also fallen before the Freshmen
with the exception of Lowell High,
which is undefeated in 25 games.
Coach Ray Dimick's Sequoia
Cherokees have won live straight
victories without a defeat in the
neighboring Peninsula Athletic
League. They are led by high
scoring Bob Peterson, who has
tanked 51 points in four league
games for a high average of 12.7
points.
The Frosh will probably open
with the same line-up that rolled
up 17 points in the first four min
utes against Palo Alto, with the ex
ception of Ramstead as center. Jim
Walsh and Ron Garver at the for
wards; Jim Ramstead at center; and
