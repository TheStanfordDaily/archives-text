# Yardley Continues to Improve
## 
### 
Blond George Yardley. the Thy
roid Kid and one of the most like
able cage specialists in the game to
day, has been directly responsible
lor the fine 17 and 3 record owned
by Stanford's Redshirts.
So far this season there has been
a definite correlation between
George's point total and the success
ot the team. In 20 games, he has
contributed 270 points for an aver
age of 13.5 per contest.

Bothered by a knee injury during
the first four games of the Southern
Division campaign, Birdman Yard
ley didn't score his usual number of
points, but he has returned to top
form and should get back into the
league scoring race this weekend in
Los Angeles.
Big George, considered by the
coaches to be the most improved
eager on the coast since last season,
has come a long way from his
freshman days on the Farm hard
woods.
Hailing from Newport Beach,
where he earned CIT honors for his
high school abilities, George was
buried in his first year with a slow
JV squad.
Showing more promise last sea
son, he earned his varsity letter and
picked up a few starting assign
ments, but it was not until the be
ginning of this season that George
really hit his stride.
Pouring through points from all
angles, he received acclaim from

everybody for his tremendous
spring, amazing tip-in artistry, and
versatility on the backboards.
His defense has improved stead
ily until he is one of the best de
fensive men on the coast. Several
times in a game he will block shots
and steal the ball, something which
happened very little in lvs- early
playing days.
In the pro-conference Pacific Coast
Invitational Tournament, he amazed
all the Cow Palace fans with his
style ol play, and wound up with
honors for being the outs landing
man in the tournament.
Right now, he is looking forward
to getting another shot at (JSC's
Trojans, and if he has things his
own way, Stanford will be coming
back to the Farm with a double
victory next Sunday,
And also, a clean-cut first-place
perch in the Southern Division race.
George is the boy who can supply
the stufi' that it takes.
