Some of the most neglected men in modern day college sports are the
student managers. Time was, the old timers tell us. that the job of sopho
i more or junior manager in football, track, or basketball was one of the
I most sought-after positions on the campus. Every fraternity took it upon
j itself to see that it had a representative on the managerial staff of the
j current sport.
j Maybe it is an indication of the trend of the times, but present-day
! senior managers are having one hock of a time filling the posts of as
\ sistant managers.
Jake Erwin, Encina store manager, tells of the days that used to be
when he says that job "had more applicants than we could count." A 1
: Masters mentions the ''terrific competition among the men for the five
j 01 six spots open for each sport."
But like the sports they manage, the senior managers are having a hard
! time building up their staffs to pre-war efficiency and strength.
Take John Berl, present senior manager of the basketball team, for
i instance. John reached his present rating by coming up through the
( ranks as does every senior manager. He worked as assistant manager in
hts sophomore and junior year and was chosen for top post for this
I season.
Manager's Job Really a Good Deal
Berl is running three teams, Frosh, Braves, and Varsity, with a four
! man staff. He advertised for sophomore managers but had no applicants
I and finally had to send his junior managers out to talk a couple of their
friends into trying out for the jobs. And these are the jobs the students
used to fight over.
Ihe job of manager is really a lucrative position. In addition to getting
i free meals at the training table, the senior managers get Block S sweaters
i and four complimentary tickets for each game. They get to travel to all
games and are entitled to any extra awards that their team might win
; in the way of post-season games. The two football managers who traveled
j to the Army game got suede traveling jackets, too.
The sophomore and junior managers are not forgotten. They get
sweaters and some trips in addition to some free meals. The best junior
manager graduates to the job of senior manager.
Frosh Ruling Due for a Change
Various explanations have been offered as to why there are so few
takers for these jobs. The one that sounds the most plausible involves the
present policy of barring freshmen from manager jobs. By the time a
student is a sophomore, he is interested in other activities on campus and
has neither the time nor desire to take on another job. In all probability
; this rule will be changed by next football season.
The job of senior manager involves far more work than most people
realize. By the time a student has worked his way up through senior
manager, he has learned a lot about traveling and managing traveling
groups.
The manager is responsible for payment and accounting of all bills on
| athletic trips. He assigns the rooms, pays the tips, arranges for trans
portation, and in general runs the team.
He must verify the menu of the meal the boys eat before a game. This
is set up by the trainer, but the manager must note that the necessary
icod is served. The Stanford manager is responsible for seeing that hot iea
is available at half-time for the basketball team.
Heavily sugared tea is served to the players for three reasons. The
tea acts as a stimulant and a source of heat, while the sugar provides
i energy. Such are the Jobs of the managers.
Laugh with the AP Poll
The AP Poll provided for a few good laughs again this week. Little ol'
Hamline jumped from eighth to fifth place by beating still smaller Con
cordia. This win, plus a 15 to 0 record, earned the Pied Pipers fifth place
in the nation. I just don't think they are that good. So they are ihe
: only undefeated team in the nation. Who clo they play? They don't meet
j any of the other teams in the top 10 ... . teams that play the best the
j country has to offer. Wonder where they will be next week.

Ihe job of manager is really a lucrative position. In addition to getting

Frosh Ruling Due for a Change
Various explanations have been offered as to why there are so few
takers for these jobs. The one that sounds the most plausible involves the
present policy of barring freshmen from manager jobs. By the time a
student is a sophomore, he is interested in other activities on campus and
has neither the time nor desire to take on another job. In all probability
; this rule will be changed by next football season.
The job of senior manager involves far more work than most people
realize. By the time a student has worked his way up through senior
manager, he has learned a lot about traveling and managing traveling
groups.
The manager is responsible for payment and accounting of all bills on
| athletic trips. He assigns the rooms, pays the tips, arranges for trans
portation, and in general runs the team.
He must verify the menu of the meal the boys eat before a game. This

Laugh with the AP Poll
The AP Poll provided for a few good laughs again this week. Little ol'
Hamline jumped from eighth to fifth place by beating still smaller Con
cordia. This win, plus a 15 to 0 record, earned the Pied Pipers fifth place
in the nation. I just don't think they are that good. So they are ihe
