BUDAPEST, Hungary, Feb. 8 (AP) —The threat of death still
hung over Josef Cardinal Mindszenty last night despite a People's
Court decision that he must serve the remainder of his life in
prison.

The higher bench of People's Courts, to which the cardinal has

; appealed for reduction of his sen
; tence. has the power to increase the
j sentence if it sees fit. Or it can
! let the lower court's ruling stand.
There was no indication yester
day, while the cardinal and his six
j convicted associates went to prison.
; as to when the appeals court will
I take up the case. When it does, it
| will consider a renewed plea by
Prosecutor Gyula Elapi that the
' cardinal receive the extreme penalty
—death by hanging. The prosecutor
! first made the demand last Saturday.
| and he voiced it again today in as-
I sailing the People's Court sentence
on the ground that it was too light.
The 56-year-old Roman Catholic
i Primate of Hungary was convicted
of treason, seeking to overthrow the
i Communist government in favor of
the Hapsburg Monarchy, and illegal
trading in dollars received from the
United States and the Vatican. The
court blamed part of Cardinal
j Mindszenty's troubles on the United
States, which it eastieated as a med
! dler in Hungarian affairs.
Though a death sentence re
mained legally possible, a foreign
i office spokesman said such a sen
| tence for treason was invoked only
j in case of war..
In addition to the prison terms,
i properly of the defendants was or
| dered confiscated.


THIS IS HOW Josef Cardinal
Mindszenty. Roman Catholic Pri
mate of Hungary, appeared as he
listened to testimony in his trial
for treason, espionage, and black
market dealings before a people's
court in Budapest, Hungary.
Mindszenty and several others
who were tried with him are
awaiting a verdict. Their trial
was concluded after three days of
testimony.
