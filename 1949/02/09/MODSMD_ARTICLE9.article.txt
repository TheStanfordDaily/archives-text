# AWS Recommends Penalties For Faulty Sign-Out Slips
## 
### 
AWS Social Regulations Commit
tee recommended to AWS Cabinet
yesterday afternoon that technicals
under the incoming demerit plan
be given only for:
1. Wrong date on a sign-out slip.
2. Blank spaces on a sign-out slip.
3. Wrong time of return on a
sign-out slip.
All other errors made in signing
in and signing out will be handled
by area committees. House regula
tion violations do not fall under de
merit plan jurisdiction and should
also be handled by area commit
tees. Area committees may not give
demerits for these violations.
The recommendations were ap
proved by the Cabinet.
Gigi Marion, AWS Cabinet head,
explained that this classification of

I technicals was necessary because
there was no uniformity regarding
; what constituted a technical.
! Miss Marion also said that the
j demerit system, which goes into ef
! tect Thursday, will cover all vio
| lations of women's social regula
i tions as stated in the Women's So
j cial Regulations book.
AWS social regulations commit
tee is in charge of the social regu
l lations book, she added.
AWS Cabinet will hold a tea hon
oring new house presidents next
week. Miss Elva Brown, Counselor
for Women, will speak. The scho!-
! arship cup will be awarded.
