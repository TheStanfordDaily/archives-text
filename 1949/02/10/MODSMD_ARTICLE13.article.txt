## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 </P). — ,
Ambassadors of Denmark and Swu- j
den outlined to Secretary of State !
Acheson late today their govern- j
moat's views on Scandinavian de- !
fense in connection with the pro
jected North Atlantic Alliance.
(In Stockholm, indications grew j
today that Denmark may follow ;
Norway in defense discussions with
the Western powers, whi'e Sweden
declared anew her intention to sit
out the cold war.
(Sweden's foreign policy declara- i
tion was presented to parliament by
Premier Tage Erlander and Foreign 1
Minister M. Oesten Unden in a ;
joint statement.)
The envoys in Washington called
at the State Department only a few j
hours after Acheson served notice j
(he United States will go ahead with i
the North Atlantic defense agree- j
ment despite strong Russian criti
cism. He rejected Soviet charges
that the pact represents an '"ag
gressive policy."
Diplomatic officials said the Dan
ish ambassador, Hendrik de Kauff
man, made preliminary inquiries
about terms on which Denmark J
could join the Western Alliance.
They indicated de Kauffman and '
his embassy aides planned a more
intensive study at meetings later
this week.
The Swedish ambassador, Eric

i Boheman, was reported to have
| outlined the situation which re
: cently led Sweden to invite Norway
j and Denmark to join in a Scandi
navian neutrality pact Officials said
J Boheman acted under instructions
j from his government and no fur
; ther meetings are contemplated
with American authorities now.
The U.S. has made plain its oppo
| sition to separate defense group
j ings such as the Scandinavian neu
trality proposal. In the American
' view such agreements would be un
; realistic and useless in resisting ag
gression.
Immediately after tne Swedish-
I sponsored neutrality talks wound up
inconclusively last week, Norwe
gian officials came to Washington to
■ discuss terms whereby Norway
could join the North Atlantic Al-
I liance.
It was this Norwegian move that
stirred sharp Russian criticism j
against the alliance.
Acheson emphatically rejected at j
a news conference Moscow's charge !
that the alliance "serves the aggies- i
sive policy of certain powers." j
The Secretary said the purpose of j
the pact now being negotiated is
the exact opposite — to help the ,
United Natic ms maintain world i
peace.
