as "wanton" Communist religious
persecution which has "sickened
and horrified" the free world.
The United" States, he disclosed, is

already considering possible action
( through the United Nations.
Britain and T ranee are being
consulted on the next mome.
On Capitol Hil!, the House unani
mously passed a resolution de
nouncing the Mindszenty trial and
urging the United States to raise
the issue in the United Nations or
by other "appropriate" means. There
was no debate on the resolution,
which now goes to the Senate.
Throughout the non - Communist
world, a storm of protest was ris
ing.
In Vatican City, it was an
nounced that Pope Pius XII has
protested solemnly against "the
grave offense inicted upon the
whole church." The pontiff sum
moned the Sacred College of Car
dinals to a "secret and extraordi
nary consistory" next Monday. He
is expected to address the Cardinals
on the Mindszenty case.
In New York, Francis Cardinal
Spellman called on Americans to
emphasize their protests by wiping
out "every Communist cell within
our own government, our institu
tions."
Acheson noted that Hungary is
not a member of the United Na
tions. But he said the Soviet-con
trolled country is definitely bound
"by the obligations set forth in Ar

tide 2 of the treaty of peace with
Hungary."
And on the basis of this treaty,
which guarantees freedom and hu
man rights, Acheson said the United
States may bring violation charge
in the United Nations.
Mindszenty, the Roman Catholic
primate of Hungary, was accused by
the Communist government of trea
