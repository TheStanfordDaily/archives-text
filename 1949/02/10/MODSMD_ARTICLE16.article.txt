# In the Court of the Beloved Oak

### 
Both my roommate and I
arc ski casualties, so we
have decided to vacation at
the seashore from now on.
As this momentous decision
calls for a change in our
wardrobes, we went down
to the Clothes Closet to see
what is new.
We had only one foot in the
door when we were astonished
to see the number of new cot
tons. There were two racks
full of dazzling white clothes
and we were drawn to them.
Roomy pulled out a long
white coat and slipped it on.
It was beautiful â€” gold but
tons. high style, and made of
fine quality waffle pique. But
the coat was only part of a
complete set fashioned by
Fleishman's. I had to try on
the sunback dress, which is
strapless and boned, with a
built-in bra. The short bo
lero or the short coat make it
right for day or evening wrjr
on campus or in town.
But there are still more
pieces to this remarkable set:
a gored skirt with enormous
side pockets; a boned, strap
less bodice; a shorts-and-bra
set. All are beautifully styled;
all are da/./.ling white. We
had never seen such versatile
beach clothes. You will love
them, so drop down to the
Clothes Closet. 52(1 Kamona.
