## Frosh-Soph Jamboree 
### 
Tomorrow and Saturday the freshmen and sophomores will j
compete in another annual Jamboree. Aside from providing
all of the students with a weekend of entertainment and com- ;
petitive games, the Jamboree has its effect on the members of !
the two younger classes.
First of all, a certain amount of class spirit and competition
develops that creates interest amona freshmen and sophomores |
in student activities.
The Jamboree, secondly, is a unifying program. It ties the j
freshmen into University life. Members of this year's sopho- ;
more class point out last year's Jamboree as an example. The I
1948 frosh licked the sophomores by a one-point margin and
thereby won the Jamboree trophy for a year. This year the '
sophs want possession of the cup for another year, while the
frosh will be fighting to keep the trophy in possession of the
freshman class.
A third—and most important—effect ot the Jamboree de
velops when contacts and friendships are made between the
class members. In this way the freshmen are brought into the
fold with the rest of the students.
Incidentally, several of our reporters tell us that the women's
touch football game slated for Saturday will be the best event
since Bawlouts if their practice sessions are any indication of
the game.
