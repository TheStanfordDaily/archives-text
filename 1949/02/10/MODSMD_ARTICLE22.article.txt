T<- the Editor:
It has come to our attention, as members of the freshman class, ihat
the so-called roughs of the class of '51 are a degenerate group of CS's
(college students) and imbeciles.
Never in the history of this great school has any other class president
been captured, other than the sophomores of this year and last. This
clearly shows the lack of incentive and school spirit so profound and neces
sary at Leland Stanford Junior University.
When one or two freshmen can capture the mighty Ted Buttner (twice),
the class of '51 has begun its downfall.
Our undefeated and untied freshman football team plans to keep its
record clean and unblemished by romping over a few sophomores who
call themselves "The Greats of the Gridiron."
When the final points are tabulated, the Toyon Tootsies and the Row
Rodents representing you, the class of '51 will be very fortunate if you
have scored one point.
Mourning for the class of '51, we remain.
WING 2E, "THE BREWS BOYS"
P.S. Our Girl Gridders Will Grind You Into The Ground.
