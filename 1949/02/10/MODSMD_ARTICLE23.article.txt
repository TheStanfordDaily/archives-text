# Federal Education Fund
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Why must there always be people who delight in evading any progres
sive move that might remedy such momentous problems as the present
inability of thousands of conscientious students to gain a decent education?
Using the Harrison type of reasoning we may conclude that any plan
raising the standards of living of the less fortunate classes through gov
ernment aid is to be immediately discarded, for such a program would
only lead to strict federal control of the individual.
All that is necessary, and all that we ask, is that a small portion of the
millions of dollars that are being used to make the instruments of war
be converted to a fund which would enable increasing numbers of Ameri
cans to obtain a proper education. This fund could be supervised by the
universities themselves without the interference of the national govern
ment.
After all, one man or woman who understands the convictions and prob
lems of other peoples is a much more powerful weapon in the preserva
tion of peace than 10 atomic bombs.
