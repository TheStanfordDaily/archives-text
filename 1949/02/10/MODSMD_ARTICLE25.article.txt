# Frosh-Sophs: Groom Beards For Contest
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
In the forthcoming Jamboree be
tween the classes of '51 and '52, one
of the events will be the beard
growing contest. Here are the rules:
(1) For '51, six weeks to grow;
(or '52, who knows?
(2) You ROTC members do not
have to be totally excluded just be
cause of military impropriety of
beards. Let your hair under your
armpits grow! Then, in T-shirts, you
can walk around like Tahitian
women carrying your books on your
head. (Who knows, a talent scout
might hire you to replace Lamour.)
(3) If you are one of those who
has a bet that Stanford will win the
first baseball series against Cal, and
will not shave until we do, what to
do in case of a tie? Shave one-half
of your face.

There should be a practical course
offered on this campus along' with so
much of civilization's fuss with
autos. Why not a seminar on "Penin
sula Used Car Dealers?"
Let's turn the Farm's jaundiced,
academic eye on this ultraworldly
sport of the business world. Gad!
What a field day for the faculty
psychologists, economists, and the
people who run the Union to learn
a few new tricks.
Other Stanfordites could learn as
well:
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES:
Could attend the dealer's round ta
ble discussing "How to Raise
Money."
THE FOOTBALL LINE COACHES
Could attend the round table dis
cussing "How To Charge Effectively
â€”and Get Away With It."
THE BOTANY DEPARTMENT
Could attend the discussions on
'How To Make a Lemon Look Like
a Peach" and "How To Squeeze
Blood Out of a Turnip-Headed Pub
lic.
THE PHILOSOPHY DEPART
MENT Might be interested in the
time traveling lecture (a few steps
ahead of Einstein) titled "Lost Mile
age and the Speedometer."
