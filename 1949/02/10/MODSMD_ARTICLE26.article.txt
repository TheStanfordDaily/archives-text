# Verboten Signs Passed by In Hamburg's Prosperity
## 
### 
HAMBURG. Feb. 9 (/P)—The sign j
on the door of the plush Atlantik ;
Hotel still says Verboten to all Ger
mans.
Sickly kids beg cigarettes as the
British cars roll up.
Half a mile away across the Alster,
the picturesque lake right in the
middle of Hamburg, stands another
hotel, the Esplanade. There are no
signs here because this is a Ger
man place.
Inside the paneled rooms of the
Esplanade, waiters in tails hover over
prosperous-looking men with beau
tiful, expensively dressed women. A
dance band plays far better jazz than
you can hear in a British club.
Outside stand the kids, this time
begging from Germans.
This is Hamburg"; 1949. The fe
verish pulse of currency reform has
given the city a Parisian glow.
Everyone agrees it's the most lux-
I urious place in Germany. One rea
! son may be that it's a port; another
J that the bombs which wrecked the
outskirts spared the center. At night
\ thousands of lights twinkle around
! the beautiful Alster.
If it's night life you want, you can
j go to the Esplanade, or the Taran
| tella, or a place called Er und Sie
(He and She), done in cream and
j dark blue in the best New York tra
dition.

A bottle of good champagne costs
35 Deutsche marks. At the export -
import rate of exchange, the only
official one, this is $12. On the black
bourse, which is the way most for
eigners get their marks, it figures
to about $2.
The aura of prosperity has got
under the skins of the British occu
pation people. Verboten signs on
British clubs don't mean much in
the way of who's who when the
Germans have better clubs.
The Esplanade had a fashion show
just before Christmas. Junoesque
blondes paraded about in rich cos
tumes for the be jeweled clientele. A
British woman who had parked her
motor pool Volkswagen behind a
German-licensed Mercedes said,
"Why, we're getting to be just poor
relations."
Actually, it's the rare German who
can afford the clubs or the clothes.
The man who can't says the others
are black market operators or busi
nessmen who cheat on taxes or for
eigners. Now and then you arc re
minded of the poverty. Germans
still scramble when you dump your
automobile ashtray in the streets.
But it's hard to see the dreary val
leys when you have your eye on
the luxury peaks — which weren't
' here a year ago.

HAMBURG. Feb. 9 (/P)—The sign j
on the door of the plush Atlantik ;
Hotel still says Verboten to all Ger
mans.
Sickly kids beg cigarettes as the
British cars roll up.
Half a mile away across the Alster,
the picturesque lake right in the
middle of Hamburg, stands another
hotel, the Esplanade. There are no
signs here because this is a Ger
man place.
Inside the paneled rooms of the
Esplanade, waiters in tails hover over
prosperous-looking men with beau
tiful, expensively dressed women. A
dance band plays far better jazz than
you can hear in a British club.
Outside stand the kids, this time
begging from Germans.
This is Hamburg"; 1949. The fe
verish pulse of currency reform has
given the city a Parisian glow.
Everyone agrees it's the most lux-
I urious place in Germany. One rea
! son may be that it's a port; another
J that the bombs which wrecked the
outskirts spared the center. At night
\ thousands of lights twinkle around
! the beautiful Alster.
If it's night life you want, you can
j go to the Esplanade, or the Taran
| tella, or a place called Er und Sie
(He and She), done in cream and
j dark blue in the best New York tra
dition.

A bottle of good champagne costs
35 Deutsche marks. At the export -
import rate of exchange, the only
official one, this is $12. On the black
bourse, which is the way most for
eigners get their marks, it figures
to about $2.
The aura of prosperity has got
under the skins of the British occu
pation people. Verboten signs on
British clubs don't mean much in
the way of who's who when the
Germans have better clubs.
The Esplanade had a fashion show
just before Christmas. Junoesque
blondes paraded about in rich cos
tumes for the be jeweled clientele. A
British woman who had parked her
motor pool Volkswagen behind a
German-licensed Mercedes said,
"Why, we're getting to be just poor
relations."
Actually, it's the rare German who
can afford the clubs or the clothes.
The man who can't says the others
are black market operators or busi
nessmen who cheat on taxes or for
eigners. Now and then you arc re
minded of the poverty. Germans
still scramble when you dump your
automobile ashtray in the streets.

leys when you have your eye on
