## Bull Session 
### 
Several nights ago, one of my three roommates, who was one of my 19
roommates last year at the Village, interrupted my work by stating in his
usual hero worshiping one, "Hey, stupid. I was just thinking about Stan-
I lord Village. What times we had out there. It makes me feel neuralgic
just thinking about it."
"You mean* nostalgic, I replied loftily after setting down my bottle.
"No, nostalgic has to do with homesickness; neuralgic is an acute pain.
I mean neuralgic."
i "Touche, touche."
"Why don't you put on your hip boots and go out there and do one
iof those newspaper stories on the old place. Let's have the truth this
i time. I hear Van Vanderdyne 111 is out there. Why not interview him?"
"Not the Van Vanderdyne of the Used Car Vanderdynes! Stanford, they
can call you bourgeois no longer. I shall make haste."
I found young Vanderdyne in one of the cubicles which he democratically
; shares with three other congenial and well-matched students, one of whom
I was writing a letter to The Daily demanding that fraternization between
, the sexes be completely banned.
"Terrible things can happen," he was writing, "even going to and from
, the library."
Vanderdync's other two roomies (or should you call them cubbies) were
reminiscing on (he extraordinary amorous successes they had enjoyed
i in the ETO by judiciously distributing chocolate bars and cigarettes.
1 Vanderdyne himself was idly reclining on his bunk after spending a hard
( day interviewing' rushing chairmen.
"How do you like Stanford Village?" I asked.
Without a word he slashed at me (in a well-bred way) with a gold
handled riding crop. What could I do? I immediately quoted him as
saying that he was very happy with his accommodations and thought
it would be a fine experience in the democratic way of living.
j "How is the food?" I continued.
"Ghastly."
"Ha, ha," I chuckled, "perhaps, but it looks to me as if you have put on
I some weight."
"I would gain weight if I ate nothing but rocks, but that doesn't mean
: rocks are a good diet."
I noted on my pad that Vanderdyne found the meals simple but full of
; nourishment and well-cooked.
j "Well, what do you think of Stanford as a whole?"
"One of the most dimly-lit holes I have ever been in."
I wrote, "Vanderdyne announced that he has fallen in love with Stan
ford and will be a true son of Stanford all his life."
"One last question. What do you think of Stanford women."
"They can go to Honest John."
"In conclusion, young Vanderdyne scoffed at the reports circulating about
Stanford women. 'Best-looking and nicest bunch of girls I have ever seen'."'
j "Well, thanks for the interview, Vanderdyne."
"You can go to Madman Muntz."
As I left, I couldn't help thinking' how nice it would be if Vanderdyne
got himself run over someday, preferably by a conservative old couple
| out for their Sunday drive.

"How do you like Stanford Village?" I asked.
Without a word he slashed at me (in a well-bred way) with a gold
handled riding crop. What could I do? I immediately quoted him as
saying that he was very happy with his accommodations and thought
it would be a fine experience in the democratic way of living.
j "How is the food?" I continued.
"Ghastly."
"Ha, ha," I chuckled, "perhaps, but it looks to me as if you have put on
I some weight."
"I would gain weight if I ate nothing but rocks, but that doesn't mean
: rocks are a good diet."
I noted on my pad that Vanderdyne found the meals simple but full of
; nourishment and well-cooked.
j "Well, what do you think of Stanford as a whole?"
"One of the most dimly-lit holes I have ever been in."
I wrote, "Vanderdyne announced that he has fallen in love with Stan
ford and will be a true son of Stanford all his life."
"One last question. What do you think of Stanford women."
"They can go to Honest John."
"In conclusion, young Vanderdyne scoffed at the reports circulating about
Stanford women. 'Best-looking and nicest bunch of girls I have ever seen'."'
j "Well, thanks for the interview, Vanderdyne."
"You can go to Madman Muntz."
As I left, I couldn't help thinking' how nice it would be if Vanderdyne
got himself run over someday, preferably by a conservative old couple
| out for their Sunday drive.
Several nights ago, one of my three roommates, who was one of my 19
roommates last year at the Village, interrupted my work by stating in his
usual hero worshiping one, "Hey, stupid. I was just thinking about Stan-
I lord Village. What times we had out there. It makes me feel neuralgic
just thinking about it."
"You mean* nostalgic, I replied loftily after setting down my bottle.
"No, nostalgic has to do with homesickness; neuralgic is an acute pain.
I mean neuralgic."
i "Touche, touche."
"Why don't you put on your hip boots and go out there and do one
iof those newspaper stories on the old place. Let's have the truth this
i time. I hear Van Vanderdyne 111 is out there. Why not interview him?"
"Not the Van Vanderdyne of the Used Car Vanderdynes! Stanford, they
can call you bourgeois no longer. I shall make haste."
I found young Vanderdyne in one of the cubicles which he democratically
; shares with three other congenial and well-matched students, one of whom
I was writing a letter to The Daily demanding that fraternization between
, the sexes be completely banned.
"Terrible things can happen," he was writing, "even going to and from
, the library."
Vanderdync's other two roomies (or should you call them cubbies) were
reminiscing on (he extraordinary amorous successes they had enjoyed
i in the ETO by judiciously distributing chocolate bars and cigarettes.
1 Vanderdyne himself was idly reclining on his bunk after spending a hard
( day interviewing' rushing chairmen.
