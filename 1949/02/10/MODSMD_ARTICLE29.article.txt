## Talk About Nothing... 
### 
"What did you say?" "1 don't |
know. I wasn't listening."
That's the trouble—some people 1
don't know enough about a subject
to stop talking about it.
It's like the teacher who said, "A
I sensible man doubts everything.
Only a fool is certain of what he
says." A pupil asks him, "Are you

sure?" "I'm positive." he says.
That's just like some of these
mastoids of ceremonies in some of
the second-rate night clubs in the
City .... pains in the ear.
One of them the other night
cracked wise with, "Did you notice
how my voice filled the room last
night?"
His straight man came back with,
"Why yes. In fact, I noticed several
people leaving to make room for it.''
I didn't think it was a joke, my
self. I won't say he was bad, but if
he'd cackled just once he'd have
been playing incubator to a flock of
chicks. Those gags weren't old, they
were prehistoric.
He should have remembered that
a good beginning and a good ending
make a good speech—if they come
close enough together .... and
that most of us like a guy who
comes right out and says what he
thinks, when he agrees with us.
r J act is the secret of success in
the lecture room. Tact is like the
gal who, when the prof asked her
why she looked at her watch so
often, replied, "I was afraid, sir, that
you wouldn't have time to finish
your interesting lecture."
Or the one that said, "Oh. profes
sor, what must you think of me now
that I've kissed you?" That is the
time for teach to think fast. The
classic answer would be, "You'll
pass."
There are some people you can do
nothing with, though. There is the
story of a professor, trying to em
phasize a point in logic, who asked
his class, "If the U.S. is bounded
on the east by the Atlantic Ocean,
on the west by the Pacific Ocean,
on the north by the Iron Curtain,
how old am I?"
Silence!
finally the class dullard spoke up.
j "You are 44."
Now it was the prof's turn to look
' dumbfounded. "That's right, but how
j did you ever get the answer?"
"It was easy. I have a brother
who is 22. and he's half crazy."
Which is almost as bad as the
teacher who told all the students to
pass their exam papers to the end
of the row, with a sheet of carbon
paper between each one, so she
could correct all the mistakes .it
once. Yeah, now read it again.
