## TENNIS Du Bray Heads Freshman Stars 
### DICK KLEIN 
Loaded with the polish and finesse
lof three national ranking juniors, i
(he freshman tennis squad is a hot-
I bed of real center court talent. The
j '52ers loom as the finest group of j
racquet-wielders to enroll in the 1
Cardinal reservation in a single sea- 1
son.
With future matches again the Cal j
Frosh, Menlo and San Mateo JCs, 1
and Bay Area high school aggrega- j
tions, the road looks clear for the ;
powerful netmen to serve up an un
defeated season. Tutored and condi
tioned by Coach Elwyn Bugge, the j
I squad is rapidly Hearing peak form
j for the coming clashes. Mr. Bugge, !
: who in his many years of coaching j
; championship Stanford tennis teams
has turned- out such headliners as '
Ted Schroeder, Larry Dee, and Kirk
j Meechem. appears optimistic over his
| charges' capabilities.
Ernie du Bray, a big San Fran- j
| cisco lad who was ranged 17th |
\ among the nation's junior players |
I last year, holds down the number
one slot, based on his excellent play- ;
ing in practice sessions. A big leftie
who slams the ball with a tremen-
I dous spin, he practices hard. Ernie
is a former Boys' and Juniors' Cali
| fornia Stats Singles and Doubles
! champ and also was a semi-finalist j
I in the National Doubles Tourney, j
|He won the National Hardcourt 1
; Doubles last year.
Next in line is George Gentry of |
La Jolla, who is rated fourth in the I
country in the juniors. George's vie- j
i tory belt includes the top trophy for
I winning the National Doubles last
! year, semifinalist in the National
i Singles, and Southern Cal Singles,
j and Doubles titleholder for several
! years. His game is mainly offensive !
| with a powerful service and press- j
i ing net game.
Nailing down the third spot is the i
j remaining seeded player, Tom |
I Lewyn, a product of the New York j
| clay courts. Gut of Scarsdale, Tom |
i is a stylist, playing a sound court }
| game that features smooth footwork, j
j Twice New York State Junior Sin- !
j gles and Doubles winner, the same
I in New Jersey, and twice Metro
i politan Tourney Singles champion,
j is the ample tournament experience
| of this 13th best national junior.
Rounding out the six-man team,
J Dean Brinkman, Steve Blumberg, |
| and John Gerlack play the remain-
I ing singles. Brinkman, a Long'
I Beach, California, lad, is another
, leftie with a topspin. A steady, con
sistent netter from Fresno, Blumberg j
; knows how to handle himself on the
! court. Both lack big tournament
j trials, playing mainly on their high
! school outfits and in local tourneys.
| Gaining most of his experience in
J South America during the summers,
j Gerlack. a Chicagoan by residence,
has some good basic strokes but must i
j develop speed.

: who in his many years of coaching j
; championship Stanford tennis teams
has turned- out such headliners as '
Ted Schroeder, Larry Dee, and Kirk

Ernie du Bray, a big San Fran- j
| cisco lad who was ranged 17th |
\ among the nation's junior players |
I last year, holds down the number
one slot, based on his excellent play- ;
ing in practice sessions. A big leftie
who slams the ball with a tremen-

; Doubles last year.

country in the juniors. George's vie- j
i tory belt includes the top trophy for
I winning the National Doubles last
! year, semifinalist in the National
i Singles, and Southern Cal Singles,

j Twice New York State Junior Sin- !

Rounding out the six-man team,
J Dean Brinkman, Steve Blumberg, |

I ing singles. Brinkman, a Long'
I Beach, California, lad, is another
, leftie with a topspin. A steady, con
sistent netter from Fresno, Blumberg j
; knows how to handle himself on the

j trials, playing mainly on their high
