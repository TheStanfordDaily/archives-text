### BILL SWIGART 
Ihe San Francisco Cow Palace threw open its doors to the fabulous
world champion Phillips Oilers the other night, and the visiting' basketball
men got a pretty rough going over.
Not only were the Oilmen upset by the local Stewart Chevrolets, bul
they took a beating at the box office, too. A disappointing mid-week
crowd of only 2,000 turned out to witness an entertaining basketball
doubleheader that reasonably should have drawn at least five times
that number.
Frankly, we don't get it. The renowned 68 Oilers, (5-time national
champions, have proven to be one of the best drawing cards in the game
today. They've played before capacity crowds of 18.000 in Madison Square
Garden, and wherever they travel fans will usually come from far and
near just to see them play.
Their opposition, the Stewart Chevrolets represent the pick of last
year's Bay Area college stars. Hank Luisetti's team got off to a slow
start, but has been coming along fast in recent weeks and in their last
outing the Carmen soundly defeated the University of California Bears.
So on Tuesday night casaba impresario Frank Walsh put the two to
gether in the San Francisco Cow Palace, threw in a Bay Area "natural"
between evenly-matched St. Mary's and Santa Clara, and what did he
get for his trouble? Empty seats, that's what. Twelve thousand of them.
Six for every paying customer.
Maybe It's Habit Forming
Its not the first time, either. A look at our attendance statistics reveals
that only 1,107 people saw the Oakland Bittners rack up a new Cow
Palace scoring mark of 90 points against St. Mary's; that a USF-Loyola,
Stewart-St. Mary's doubleheader played before a paltry 2,150; that a
Friday night double bill featuring California and Pittsburgh was seen by
only 2,315. There were other twin bills played before less than 3,000, too!
The Santa Clara-Long Island U. game comes to mind, as do some of the
PCC tournament contests.
So adding up all the red marks in the Cow Palace books and dividing
by some of the undernourished crowds seen at Kezar Pavilion, the Oak
land Auditorium, the California Gym, and even in Stanford's 2x4 cracker
box in recent years, we're coming to the conclusion that the old town
just doesn't like the game of bounce.
For example, the YMI outfit upset the Oakland Bittners before 120 fan.-
in Kezar Pavilion. A week or so later, all of 346 people jammed into
Kezar to watch St. Mary's and YMI play. For an area which prides itself
on being a sportsman's town, such figures are appalling.
They'll turn out for the big ones, sure. The magic name of Notre Dami
drew 11,000 people out of their shells for the evening, and the Stanford-
CCNY, USC-USF double bill played before 10,000. But there were still
plenty of empty seats left, and we suspect that such contests would be sole
out days beforehand if played elsewhere.
Pro Game Can't Make 11 Either
And pro basketball? Not a chance! This region supports two profes
sional football teams, two triple-A minor league baseball teams, two ict
hockey outfits, and a half a dozen boxing and wrestling rings, but ever
attempt to install pro basketball has folded before it started. The pro
moters like to eat too well for that.
So, let's face it. We may be living in a basketball era, but we're no
living in a basketball town.
Owner Lou Bittner of the hot-shot Oakland Bittners decided that somi
time ago. He has announced that he will take his squad out of the Oaklam
Auditorium and play his remaining home games out in the sticks. Smal
town folk, it seems, are more appreciative of the Bittners.
The whole trouble stems from the fact that spectator basketball ha
never been promoted in San Francisco. Heretofore there was no pavilio'
in which to play a game that would allow more than a few people to see i
Many newspapermen and athletic publicity directors took the negativ
viewpoint that as long as no one could see basketball games anyway, ther
wasn't anj' point in promoting it.
Now that Frank Walsh has chased the cows out of the Geneva Avenu
pavilion and laid a few boards on the floor where all can see, he find
that there's still no demand for the stuff. The big names are coming 1
town all right, but without the proper amount of publicity, it's like tryin
to feed a person when he's not hungry.
Perhaps Sportswriters at Fault
Yet little is being done to put an edge on that appetite. There's ni
enough newspaper space devoted to local basketball, nor is there enoug
showmanship or attention to the little details that make attending a bas
ketball game more pleasant.
During the middle of the week a sports fan can read four newspapei
without finding a line of print about any of the Bay Area teams. Th
weekend stories are usually mediocre and buried down at the bottom <
the page. There's not nearly enough pictures. Bowling gets as much pla
as basketball, and horseracing ten times as much.
A little showmanship wouldn't hurt either. By itself basketball
really a good gameâ€”not hard to take at all. But some sugar coating i
the form of more color and halftime entertainment might make the pi
easier to swallow.
