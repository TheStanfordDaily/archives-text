# An Indian, A Bruin; Cage War in Offing
## Cagers Hit Los Angeles; Friday Night At Olympic Auditorium; Saturday at Westwood 
### JOHN HALL 
Twelve of Everett Dean's
arsity cagers will hop the
oon Daylight today heading
>r Los Angeles and their sec
ad weekend series with the
vo Southland trouble-shooters,
SC and UCLA.
The two games will have all-im
ntant bearing on the Southern
1 vision basketball derby, as Stan
•rd and USC are deadlocked for
ie present lead (3-1), with UCLA
tst one step behind. (2-2).
Friday night Stanford's red-shirt
1 Indians will invade the pint
/.ed Olympic Auditorium to face
SC's thuggish Trojans in what fig
•es to be the most crucial clash
the Dixie loop season.
IJSC Jinx Grows
Stanford will be working on its
th win, while the Figueroa Street
)opsters will be searching for their
ghth. But the local gang has not

aten USC since 1947, and al-
Dugh the Troys have dropped
ven contests already this; year,
in ford hasn't grabbed any of the
'ivy.
Last time they met this season,
m Barry's gori'la-men outslugged
inford in the Pavilion, 56 to 46,
I that was when big George Yard
r was limping on one leg.
Since then, the Deanmen have
>n seven out of eight, while USC
s had opportunity to try only two
nes. defeating USF and Santa
ira last weekend in the Cow Pal-
Looking their best against the
ins, Barry's boys served sharp
tice to Bay Area fans that they
II not be too impressed with

Stanford's 17 and 3, lOth-in-the-na
tion rating.
Sharman Sparkles Plenty
Bill Sharman, using his deliberate
faking style of play to ruin USF,
\»i'l be in the driver's seat when the
Trojans try to run up their sixth
straight triumph over Stanford.
Backing up Sharman are center
Stan Christie, guards Marty Pelka
and Bud Doty, and back from the
injured list, forward Abe Androff.
Tommy Riach, the speeder who
helped Troy with its earlier win
over Stanford, is expected to see
added action.
Joe White, another member of
USC's gorilla corps, will also be
causing trouble. White is one of the
best come-through players on the
squad.
At West wood Saturday
Saturday night, John Wcoden's
crazy-legged Bruins will take up
the fight. Moving over to Westwood,
Stanford will try to back up its ear
lier 61-52 and 55-47 (PCC Tourna
ment) Bruin victories with more of
the same.
But the Bruins, always torigh to
beat on their home hardwood, may
prove more stubborn than Farm
hands expect. Idle for two weeks
because of exams (same as USC and
Ca'), the Bruins came roaring out
ot their hibernation last week,
bounicng 20th Century-Fox easily
mil then edging Pittsburgh, 51 to
48.
If Chuck Clustka and Carl
Kraushaar, the leading Uclan point
makers, have hot nights, the Cards
will be in for trouble. Add to that
the fact that Stanford always seems
to tire on the second night and that
the Indians have spent most of their
pre - game practice pointing for
Troy, and you run into a slight hint
of pending disaster.
UCLA on certain nights can run
with the best of them, and Stanford
cannot afford to take the West
wooders lightly. Neither can the
Indians relax for USC. so their
coming weekend is going to be any
thing but pleasant.
Braves Imitate Troy
Working as USC's Trojans, Phil
Bcngtson's Braves have been giving
the varsity all it could handle for
fhe past few nights over in the
Pavilion. Dick Schutte acting like

1 Stan Christie and Gay Bryan pre- ;
i tending to be Bill Sharman have
; been playing their parts all the way
down the line.
Looking in the very best of form
this week is George Yardley, whose 1
drive-in shots have been unstop- j
! pable. Bill Rose has been working
the ball in to the post with effec- ,

tiveness, and the shooting eyes of
Dave Davidson and Gus Chavalas
appear to be at their sharpest.
The 12-man squad, leaving Palo
Alto at noon today, will arrive in
Los Angeles shortly before 10 p.m.
The Indians will make their head
quarters at the Chapman Park Ho
tel on Wilshire, which is only about
a 15-minute ride to the Olympic
Auditorium.
The traveling squad includes Rill
Stephenson, George Yardley, Marv
Gelber, Dave Davidson, Bob Lewis,
Milt Iverson, Gay Bryan, Ralph
Carver, Gus Cliavalas. Dick Schutte,
Bill Lewis, and Bill Rose.


GUS CHAVALAS, Stanford's specialist in the swift and grit, is an artist
at the now-jou-see-it-now-ypu-don't game, and has pulled the Dean
men out of many tight spots this season with his tantalizing dribbling
ability. He will run into trouble Saturday night against Bruin ALLAN
SAWYER, pictured above. Sawyer is a loading cog in UCLA's front line
attack.

Stanford will be working on its

Looking their best against the

II not be too impressed with

Stanford's 17 and 3, lOth-in-the-na
tion rating.
Sharman Sparkles Plenty
Bill Sharman, using his deliberate
faking style of play to ruin USF,
\»i'l be in the driver's seat when the
Trojans try to run up their sixth
straight triumph over Stanford.
Backing up Sharman are center
Stan Christie, guards Marty Pelka
and Bud Doty, and back from the
injured list, forward Abe Androff.
Tommy Riach, the speeder who
helped Troy with its earlier win
over Stanford, is expected to see
added action.
Joe White, another member of
USC's gorilla corps, will also be
causing trouble. White is one of the
best come-through players on the
squad.
At West wood Saturday
Saturday night, John Wcoden's
crazy-legged Bruins will take up
the fight. Moving over to Westwood,
Stanford will try to back up its ear
lier 61-52 and 55-47 (PCC Tourna
ment) Bruin victories with more of
the same.
But the Bruins, always torigh to
beat on their home hardwood, may
prove more stubborn than Farm
hands expect. Idle for two weeks
because of exams (same as USC and
Ca'), the Bruins came roaring out
ot their hibernation last week,
bounicng 20th Century-Fox easily
mil then edging Pittsburgh, 51 to
48.
If Chuck Clustka and Carl
Kraushaar, the leading Uclan point
makers, have hot nights, the Cards
will be in for trouble. Add to that
the fact that Stanford always seems
to tire on the second night and that
the Indians have spent most of their
pre - game practice pointing for
Troy, and you run into a slight hint
of pending disaster.
UCLA on certain nights can run
with the best of them, and Stanford
cannot afford to take the West
wooders lightly. Neither can the
Indians relax for USC. so their
coming weekend is going to be any
thing but pleasant.
Braves Imitate Troy
Working as USC's Trojans, Phil
Bcngtson's Braves have been giving
the varsity all it could handle for
fhe past few nights over in the
Pavilion. Dick Schutte acting like

1 Stan Christie and Gay Bryan pre- ;
i tending to be Bill Sharman have
; been playing their parts all the way
down the line.
Looking in the very best of form
this week is George Yardley, whose 1
drive-in shots have been unstop- j
! pable. Bill Rose has been working
the ball in to the post with effec- ,

tiveness, and the shooting eyes of
Dave Davidson and Gus Chavalas
appear to be at their sharpest.
The 12-man squad, leaving Palo
Alto at noon today, will arrive in
Los Angeles shortly before 10 p.m.
The Indians will make their head
quarters at the Chapman Park Ho
tel on Wilshire, which is only about
a 15-minute ride to the Olympic
Auditorium.
The traveling squad includes Rill
Stephenson, George Yardley, Marv
Gelber, Dave Davidson, Bob Lewis,
Milt Iverson, Gay Bryan, Ralph
Carver, Gus Cliavalas. Dick Schutte,
Bill Lewis, and Bill Rose.


GUS CHAVALAS, Stanford's specialist in the swift and grit, is an artist
at the now-jou-see-it-now-ypu-don't game, and has pulled the Dean
men out of many tight spots this season with his tantalizing dribbling
ability. He will run into trouble Saturday night against Bruin ALLAN
SAWYER, pictured above. Sawyer is a loading cog in UCLA's front line

the Dixie loop season.
IJSC Jinx Grows
Stanford will be working on its
th win, while the Figueroa Street
)opsters will be searching for their
ghth. But the local gang has not

aten USC since 1947, and al-
Dugh the Troys have dropped
ven contests already this; year,
in ford hasn't grabbed any of the
'ivy.
Last time they met this season,
m Barry's gori'la-men outslugged
inford in the Pavilion, 56 to 46,
I that was when big George Yard
r was limping on one leg.
Since then, the Deanmen have
>n seven out of eight, while USC
s had opportunity to try only two
nes. defeating USF and Santa
ira last weekend in the Cow Pal-
Looking their best against the
ins, Barry's boys served sharp
tice to Bay Area fans that they
II not be too impressed with

Stanford's 17 and 3, lOth-in-the-na
tion rating.
Sharman Sparkles Plenty
Bill Sharman, using his deliberate
faking style of play to ruin USF,
\»i'l be in the driver's seat when the
Trojans try to run up their sixth
straight triumph over Stanford.
Backing up Sharman are center
Stan Christie, guards Marty Pelka
and Bud Doty, and back from the
injured list, forward Abe Androff.
Tommy Riach, the speeder who
helped Troy with its earlier win
over Stanford, is expected to see
added action.
Joe White, another member of
USC's gorilla corps, will also be
causing trouble. White is one of the
best come-through players on the
squad.
At West wood Saturday
Saturday night, John Wcoden's
crazy-legged Bruins will take up
the fight. Moving over to Westwood,
Stanford will try to back up its ear
lier 61-52 and 55-47 (PCC Tourna
ment) Bruin victories with more of
the same.
But the Bruins, always torigh to
beat on their home hardwood, may
prove more stubborn than Farm
hands expect. Idle for two weeks
because of exams (same as USC and
Ca'), the Bruins came roaring out
ot their hibernation last week,
bounicng 20th Century-Fox easily
mil then edging Pittsburgh, 51 to
48.
If Chuck Clustka and Carl
Kraushaar, the leading Uclan point
makers, have hot nights, the Cards
will be in for trouble. Add to that
the fact that Stanford always seems
to tire on the second night and that
the Indians have spent most of their
pre - game practice pointing for
Troy, and you run into a slight hint
of pending disaster.
UCLA on certain nights can run
with the best of them, and Stanford
cannot afford to take the West
wooders lightly. Neither can the
Indians relax for USC. so their
coming weekend is going to be any
thing but pleasant.
Braves Imitate Troy
Working as USC's Trojans, Phil
Bcngtson's Braves have been giving
the varsity all it could handle for
fhe past few nights over in the
Pavilion. Dick Schutte acting like

1 Stan Christie and Gay Bryan pre- ;
i tending to be Bill Sharman have
; been playing their parts all the way
down the line.
Looking in the very best of form
this week is George Yardley, whose 1
drive-in shots have been unstop- j
! pable. Bill Rose has been working
the ball in to the post with effec- ,

tiveness, and the shooting eyes of
Dave Davidson and Gus Chavalas
appear to be at their sharpest.
The 12-man squad, leaving Palo
Alto at noon today, will arrive in
Los Angeles shortly before 10 p.m.
The Indians will make their head
quarters at the Chapman Park Ho
tel on Wilshire, which is only about
a 15-minute ride to the Olympic
Auditorium.
The traveling squad includes Rill
Stephenson, George Yardley, Marv
Gelber, Dave Davidson, Bob Lewis,
Milt Iverson, Gay Bryan, Ralph
Carver, Gus Cliavalas. Dick Schutte,
Bill Lewis, and Bill Rose.


GUS CHAVALAS, Stanford's specialist in the swift and grit, is an artist
at the now-jou-see-it-now-ypu-don't game, and has pulled the Dean
men out of many tight spots this season with his tantalizing dribbling
ability. He will run into trouble Saturday night against Bruin ALLAN
SAWYER, pictured above. Sawyer is a loading cog in UCLA's front line
attack.

Twelve of Everett Dean's
arsity cagers will hop the
oon Daylight today heading
>r Los Angeles and their sec
ad weekend series with the
vo Southland trouble-shooters,
SC and UCLA.
The two games will have all-im
ntant bearing on the Southern
1 vision basketball derby, as Stan
•rd and USC are deadlocked for
ie present lead (3-1), with UCLA
tst one step behind. (2-2).
Friday night Stanford's red-shirt
1 Indians will invade the pint
/.ed Olympic Auditorium to face
SC's thuggish Trojans in what fig
•es to be the most crucial clash
the Dixie loop season.
