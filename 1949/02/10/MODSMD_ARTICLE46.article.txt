baseball p'ayer Fve seen in many
seasons," bubbled Bushong, and lie
had almost as enthusiastic praise for
Osenbaugh and Chez. Osenbaugh
was All-City in a Sacramento high
school, and Chez was All - State
while playing for Medford High in
Oregon. Hamilton v/as chosen to
the Esquire All - American boys'

ing catcher, by Owen Powell cov
ering the hot corner, and by Ter
rible Tony Stellar who roams the
