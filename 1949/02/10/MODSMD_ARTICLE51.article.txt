# IIR Representatives Visit International House at Cal
## 
### 
A committee of six representa
tives from the Stanford lIR visited
the Cal International House last
I riday afternoon to obtain infor
mation pertinent to the establish
ment of a similar house at Stan
Â»ord.
On the committee were Olga Son
dar, in charge of the"I" House
project; Bob von Pagcnhardt, pres
ident of the IIR; B. J. Denning, lIR
vice - presiden; David Chan, "I"
C'ub president; and Dick Kelton
and Sushil Guha.
Mrs. Allen C. Blaisdell, director of
the Cal "I" House, besides showing
the group the facilities of the "1"
House, answered many questions
concerning the purposes, adminis
trative organization, financial his
tory, and activities of the house.
Besides this trip to Cal, the"I"
Club committee has written to "I"
houses and similar institutions all
over the world, even as far away
as India and Egypt, for information
to help them in the proposed estab
lishment of a Stanford 'T" House.
They are now preparing a de
tailed report of what information
they have gathered and of plans
which they will subsequently sub-

Mit to the student body, the ad
ministration, and the Board ol
Trustees for criticism and further
suggestions.
In a talk with Miss Sender Wed
nesday, Dean Kimpton said that
if the committee would submit such
a report with concrete plans the
administration would definitely be
interested in considering them.
Miss Sonder says the house would
be set up as a self-sustaining co
operative dormitory, probably in
Palo Alto.
Students who are seriously inter
ested and who would "co-operate
enthusiastically" are needed to help
on the committee, according to Miss
Sonder. Interviews for positions
will be held tomorrow and next
Friday afternoon between 3 and 5
at the"I" Club desk in the lIR
office.
