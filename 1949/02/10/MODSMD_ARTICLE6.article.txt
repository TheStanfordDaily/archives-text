# Demerit Plan Begins Today; Lockouts Become Extinct
## 
### 
The Demerit System will go into
effect today, AWS Cabinet an
nounced yesterday afternoon. This
new plan, which was approved by
an overwhelming vote of on-cam
pus women two weeks ago, will in
troduce an entirely new method of
handling violations of women's so
cial regulations.
The system, presented by Wom
en's Council last fall, replaces the
former method of lock-ins, fines,
and other penalties.
Since the bonus system was re
tained, the first three lockouts of
each quarter, if they total under 15
minutes, will not count toward de
merits. An accumulative record of
all other violations will be kept
for each undergraduate woman
throughout her years at Stanford.
Under the new plan, women do
not appear before house committees
at al). They appear before Women's
Council only after they have ac
cumulated four, demerits. Council
may not give lock-ins; instead it
may put a woman on social proba
tion after she has received four dc

j merits and suspend her after she
i has received five demerits. Cases
| may be appealed within two weeks
| after the violations.
One demerit is given for late re
| turns of 30 minutes, or an accumu
: lation of more than five lockouts
which total 30 minutes or leja. It is
j also given for a total of three of
i fenses, or eight technicals. Techni
| cals include writing the wrong date
i on a sign-out slip, leaving blanks
| on sign-out slips, or putting wrong
time of return on sign-out slips.
Other sign - out or house violations
: will be handled by area o r house
! committees.
Requests for appea's may be made
at the Women's Council office, room
3 in the Union, between 5 and 5:45
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
or Thursday. At this time, a woman
may make an appointment with
Women's Council for the time of
her appeal.
During the first year of opera
tion, the Demerit System will allow
freshmen and sophomores five de
merits, juniors four, and seniors
three.
