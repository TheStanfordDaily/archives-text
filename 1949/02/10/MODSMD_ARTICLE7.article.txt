# Excom Votes Compromise Foreign Plan
## 
### 
Excom approved a compromise
foreign scholarships program by a
7 to 6 vote last night. After a lively
two - hour discussion it was de
cided that the foreign scholarships
program begun this year would be
continued, but on a more restricted
basis.
Only $5,000 will be available next
year, whereas a $9,000 program is
in effect now. The difference will
go in||j a grant-in-aid fund for do
mestic students who are already in
school, but who are in danger of
dropping out for financial reasons.
It is understood that more money
will be put into the two funds later,
if available, however.
The discussion centered around
the relative importance of the two
programs, and whether or not the
aims of the foreign scholarship pro
gram could be fulfilled just as well
by doing more for the foreign stu
dents who arc already enrolled at
Stanford.
The aims of the program were
defined by Excom representative
Mark Hatfield as bringing over for
eign students for a year of study
to "promote international under
standing and goodwill."
Excom also eliminated "Injun
Fun" as an official publication, ap
pointed Maurine Bourne editor of
next year's "Frosh Bib'.e," and made
victory awards to the 1947-48 golf
and swimming teams.
