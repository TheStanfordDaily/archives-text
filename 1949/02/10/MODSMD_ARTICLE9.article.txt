tion of students interested in the
program. Art Herzog and Bill Rose,
off-campus Excom representatives,
who arranged the rally, will assist
in co-ordinating whatever plans are
made.
Keynoting the program were
short talks by representatives of
proposed bridge, photography, and
writers clubs, a spring sing group,
intramural basketball, and Klahoya,
women's off-campus organization.
Dean Lawrence L. Kimpton, an
off-campus student himself during
his undergraduate days on the
Farm, was also present to offer his
encouragement to students intend
ing to participate in the project.
"Though Stanford is generally
known as a resident university," he
said, "the fact is that only 37 per
cent of our students actually live
on campus, 53 per cent including
the Village.
"Anything that will get off-cam
pus students better acquainted and
give them more of a chance to par
ticipate in Stanford life is a fine
thing."
Master of Ceremonies Bob Se
trakian and partner Charlie Jelli
son, well - known Rickey's enter
tainers, highlighted the variety
show. Bolstering the program were
a Frank Wolff rendition of "St.
Louis Blues," King Riverbottom
Mud's Streamlined Jazz Band's
version of "Alexander's Ragtime
Band," the antics of cheerleader
Tom Elke, and a noisy performance
by the nine-musician, motley-cos
tumed Phi Delt band.
