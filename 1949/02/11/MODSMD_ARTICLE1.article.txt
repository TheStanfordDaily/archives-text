# Indians Ready To Battle USC
## Southern Ball Title At Stake 
### JOHN HALL Daily Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11.â€”
Here at the Chapman Park Ho
tel on Wilshire Blvd., Stanford's
lOth-in-the-nation Indians are
getting ready to do battle to
night with USC's rugged Tro
jans.
Leadership in the Southern Di
vision basketball derby is in the
balance.
Tipoff is scheduled for 8 in the
Olympic Auditorium tonight, and a
basketball - conscious Los Angeles
crowd is expected to jam the place
to get a glimpse of championship
competition.
Tomorrow night. Stanford moves
over to Westwood to face UCLA's
hot and cold Bruins. Starting time
i? set back to 8:30.
Both games will be radioed out
to the Bay Area over station KLX.
The Indian - Trojan clash may
prove to be the turning point in the
Southern Division race. Knotted
together with identical 3-1 league
records, both clubs will be out to
offer their stiffest arguments as to
who has and who hasn't got it for
1049.
Stanford, working on a 17-3 sea
son standing, will be out to avenge
ils earlier 56 to 46 loss to USC.
Right now, the Indians are in per
fect shape tor the task.
George Yardley, who was sput
tering at half-speed for the first SC
outing, is right again. Bill Rose,
a'so out of the last USC fray, will
be back tonight and should make
some difference.
Everett Dean, working on the as
sumption that experience is the best
policy, will start the same five that
opened against CCNY. Whether the
boys can bounce back from that
disaster remains to be seen.
Marv Gelber will go again at the
left forward spot, which seems to
be the only changeable position on
the team. The other positions will
be handled by the regular combo
of Yardley at forward, Bill Ste
phenson at center, and Dave David
son and Whip Lewis at guards.
