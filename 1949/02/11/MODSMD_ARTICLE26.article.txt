"That's a hell of a note," said the Devil as he poked some damned soul
ivith a pitchfork and listened critically to the resulting shrill shriek of
rain. "I've increased the siz.e of the shaft and still the quality of the suf
fering seems to be below par." He threw down his pitchfork in disgust.
"I know," replied his assistant morosely, "an 8 o'clock class can get a
bigger groan out of a Stanford student than all the red hot pokers and
pitchforks in Hell."
"Without modernizing how can we expect to keep up with them up there?
We've no mid-terms, no finals, no .... "
"Well, we're learning," interrupted the Devil defensively. "If you'll
look at that new neon sign over the Gates of Hell, you'll see I've im
proved on Dante a bit. It's a little trick I picked up at Stanford. It now
reads 'Give Up All Money, Ye Who Enter Here.' You should have heard
the screams of agony from the new arrivals then. Sounded just like
old times."
"1 think those infernal women in Harpy House are the cause of the low
morale here," said the assistant bucking for a promotion. "Every time
they walk down to the hot sullur pools for their daily dip, the shrieks of
the Damned seem to take on a whistling sound."
"I've fixed that, too," said the Devil gleefully. "I'll only let one woman
in for every three men. Copied that from Stanford, too."
"But the women have such a head start down here that it won't make
any difference for centuries," moaned the assistant. "Look what an up
roar Cleopatra's causing at the brimstone mill. The men will be happy
fcr the rest of the day."
Just then an angel flying overhead caught a glimpse of the Nile Queen.
"Well, I'll be damned," he cried and dropped down beside her.
"Hey, we can't have any of that here!" yelled the Devil as he rushed
over to the fallen angel. "You'll have to wait your turn under the immi
gration system."
"Shucks," said the angel crestfallen. "You know what it's like up there.
All the pretty women are down here."
"Aw, go to Heaven," growled the Devil. "Then he turned to Cleopatra.
"Listen, Clco!" he commanded. "There is something I've got to say to you."
"Why, you old sinner," she simpered, "after all these years. You've
made me so happy!"
The Devil broke down. "Good God!" he cried as he (lung himself into
a handy bottomless pit. "I can't stand it. This is Hell!''
"That's a hell of a note," said the Devil as he poked some damned soul
ivith a pitchfork and listened critically to the resulting shrill shriek of
rain. "I've increased the siz.e of the shaft and still the quality of the suf

We've no mid-terms, no finals, no .... "
"Well, we're learning," interrupted the Devil defensively. "If you'll
look at that new neon sign over the Gates of Hell, you'll see I've im
proved on Dante a bit. It's a little trick I picked up at Stanford. It now
reads 'Give Up All Money, Ye Who Enter Here.' You should have heard
the screams of agony from the new arrivals then. Sounded just like
old times."
"1 think those infernal women in Harpy House are the cause of the low
morale here," said the assistant bucking for a promotion. "Every time
they walk down to the hot sullur pools for their daily dip, the shrieks of
the Damned seem to take on a whistling sound."
"I've fixed that, too," said the Devil gleefully. "I'll only let one woman
in for every three men. Copied that from Stanford, too."
"But the women have such a head start down here that it won't make
any difference for centuries," moaned the assistant. "Look what an up
roar Cleopatra's causing at the brimstone mill. The men will be happy
fcr the rest of the day."
Just then an angel flying overhead caught a glimpse of the Nile Queen.
"Well, I'll be damned," he cried and dropped down beside her.
"Hey, we can't have any of that here!" yelled the Devil as he rushed
over to the fallen angel. "You'll have to wait your turn under the immi
gration system."
"Shucks," said the angel crestfallen. "You know what it's like up there.
All the pretty women are down here."
"Aw, go to Heaven," growled the Devil. "Then he turned to Cleopatra.
"Listen, Clco!" he commanded. "There is something I've got to say to you."
"Why, you old sinner," she simpered, "after all these years. You've
made me so happy!"
The Devil broke down. "Good God!" he cried as he (lung himself into
a handy bottomless pit. "I can't stand it. This is Hell!''
"That's a hell of a note," said the Devil as he poked some damned soul
ivith a pitchfork and listened critically to the resulting shrill shriek of
rain. "I've increased the siz.e of the shaft and still the quality of the suf
fering seems to be below par." He threw down his pitchfork in disgust.
"I know," replied his assistant morosely, "an 8 o'clock class can get a
bigger groan out of a Stanford student than all the red hot pokers and
pitchforks in Hell."
"Without modernizing how can we expect to keep up with them up there?
We've no mid-terms, no finals, no .... "
