## IT SEZ HERE:

The Cactus Gardens are a bit of barren land over thataway, completely
inhabited by tribesmen transplanted from the Gobi Desert, and occasionally
visited in the season of the full moon by an organization of local eager
beavers known as the Cactus Fanciers Association. Between the beavers
and the full moon, a lot of wood is hewn.
The association is presided over by the jovial, genial Little Professor,
who wrote his best-selling Ph.D. thesis entitled "Which Way Is Up?"
when he was 65. The other officers of the association are Publicity Hound
Ignatz Üb, Candid Cameraman Aiphonse Goose, and Recording Secretary
jn Charge of Hidden Microphones Miss Olga Urp ("42).
Because the association is not sanctioned by the University its mem
bership rolls are secret, but needless to say its numbers are legion. It col
lects no dues, holds no meetings, and its only purpose for existence is that
it. does provide an outlet for the excess energies of a certain type of
student.
This is the way the Association operates, and you are warned in advance
that this is a skimpy and condensed version of its operations.
The Little Professor stations himself behind an unlikely looking shrub
near the main road leading to the Cactus Gardens, and on the approach of
a likely looking conveyance flashes a signal (usually an owlhoot or two)
io the other association officers who are concealed within the Gardens.
First allowing time for the convertible to park and the occupants to
become engrossed in some intense cactus fancying, Sec. Urp—who does
resemble a \ ucca moth—flits to the automobile (once it was a hansom
carriage, but we won't go into that) and parks the mike in a suitable
position.
Next comes Candid Goose who aims his camera, with flash attached,
into the conveyance and proceeds to take a picture of what there is to
take a picture of.
Whereupon Hound Ub appears and begins to interview the initiates to
the Cactus Fanciers Association. (We trust that you realize that all this
is dependent upon split-second timing and the action follows rapidly.)
Ub (to the occupants of the car): Are you in favor of beer on campus?
Male voice (inside car): What the Hell is this?
Female voice (simultaneously): Eeceeeeeeeecek!
Male voice: ESCVX (?!:;.0$ THMBZ $.'(♦!;(;: AFFG! ~:;('! ODWK!....
Üb: Beer, you know, beer, beer, beer. On campus, you know.
Female voice: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeoeeek!
Male voice: ESCVX (?!:;.0$ THMBZ $.'(*!;(;: AEFG! ~:;('! ODWK!....
Miss Urp: Haven't I seen you someplace before? Dinah's? L'Ommie's?
Longbarn, maybe? How about Mora's? You look like a birdwatcher.
(Noise of siren on campus patrol car in distance—drawing nearer.
Üb: Personally, I'm in favor of canned beer, that way we won't have
to worry about the Encina freshmen waterbagging with old beer bottles.
Goose: What about them waterbagging with old beer cans?
Miss Urp: Killjoy!
Üb: Okay, then, serve draft beer in paper cups.
(Noise of grinding gears as convertible digs out for fast getaway.)
(The Little Professor (stopping getaway car by waving a red lantern
in the middle of the road): Young man (to driver), if you'll leave me
your name and address we'll be glad to send you two prints of the excel
lent photo our cameraman took of you and your companion earlier this
evening.
Miss Urp: Cheezit! The cops!
As the patrol car appears, the Cactus Fanciers Association officers vanish
in puff's of smoke, leaving the conveyance and its occupants to try their
own hands at creative writing.
