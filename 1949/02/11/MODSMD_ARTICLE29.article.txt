## Immunity 
### 
To the Editor:
"Diplomatic immunity protected
the French Consul-General for
San Francisco from paying a $2
parking fine . . . . "
—Feb. 7 issue of The Daily, p. 1.
Nuts!
Bully for you, Chief Davis! T'was
a noble gesture. Heads up. Chief
Davis! Look around, it's dark in
there, isn't it?
Nuts! Mr. Broekel has switched
to the diplomatic service and wants
his two bucks back!
RAY (I paid my 2 bucks) BROEKEL
(Ed. Note: Three reasons justi
fied Chief Davis' recall of the con
sul's traffic ticket. First, the con
sul was an official guest at Stan
ford. Second, he was representing
the faculty in that he gave two
lectures to political science classes
that day. In that light, then, he
deserved to park in a faculty re
served parking area.
The third reason is a legal one.
Every diplomat throughout the
world has immunity against arrest
and fines. Consuls have such im
munity through comity—a cour
tesy. Their cars hear diplomatic
service license plates. Unlike the
Eastern Seaboard area, diplomatic
cars are not usually seen in the
West, and traffic officers, therefore,
are not familiar with the service
courtesies.)
