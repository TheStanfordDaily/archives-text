# French Boost ‘Kinsey’ Sales
## 
### 
PARIS, Feb. 10 (/P) — France,
which usually takes its sex books
without statistics, is acquiring a taste
for the "Kinsey Report."
Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey's "Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male," is
going briskly in translation here.
Some 30,000 copies, complete with
graphs and tables of figures, have
been sold in France since it was pub
lished early in January. Another
edition of 10.000 will be off the
presses soon.
Dr. Kinsey's publisher here is "Les
Editions du Pavois." The same firm
also owns the French rights to the
Katherine Winsor novel "Forever
Amber."
Pierre-Francois Caille, who picks
its American books, gave the trans
lation an American slant. He called
it "Sexual Behavior of the American
Male."
Most French critics do not believe
that Dr. Kinsey's findings apply to
Frenchmen. The weekly "Samedi-
Soir," which published a series of
articles on the work, headlined one
of them:
"In France, AO per cent of hus
bands are unfaithful."
Dr. Kinsey's estimate is "about
half."
Caille said his firm went about the
publication of the book quietly. He
refused to specify how much it paid
for the French rights, but said the
book showed a profit after the first
10.000 sales of a subscription edition
for doctors, social workers, lawyers,
and other professionals.
"Quite a few clergymen bought it,
too," Caille said.
This edition sold at a bargain price
of 900 francs ($3). Unlike most
French books, which have paper
covers, the Kinsey Report appeared
in a flexible imitation leather bind
ing.
Dealers' reactions were mixed.
Caille said. Some sent their copies
back after one look with the com
plaint that nothing so scientific could
have a popular sale. Others reor
dered. A few wanted to know when
"Sexual Behavior of the American
Woman" would come out.
"We don't know the answer to
that," Caille said. "It hasn't come
out in the U.S. yet. But we have
the rights for France when it does."
"Of course," he said with a remi
niscent sigh, "it's not like 'Amber.'
The day after that came out, we had
a line of booksellers at our office
that reached all tHo way around the
block."
