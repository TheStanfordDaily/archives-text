# Chaplain’s Niche
## 
### 
PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain
How do you do! Only, l refuse to
be put in a niche! Try as yon will
to shove me and what I represent
into a pigeon-hole, I won't bo
shelved. Wrap me round and round
with your simulated indifference,
fetter me with your prejudices, ball
and chain me with your natural
doubts; I'll out-magic Houdini and
.suddenly appear in the most amazing
places.
This I propose to do at Stanford!
Presumptuous, is it? No! Just "real
istic."
No one con stop me. because I can
get at anyone where he is most vul
nerable. Man may be born an ani
mal. but he is a religious animal
and he can't shed his nature. Aware
of this, Stanford's Administration
has prepared to put religion back
into the center of this campus, as
the Founder wished and dreamed.
That's why Minto and I are here,
with a lot of help already flowing in.
The Daily Editor has generously
given me some space which I am to
use each Friday to outline the proc
ess. It's very decent of him. I dare
you to read this column! Here I am
to present our "program." It falls
into four main parts:
1. Worship in the Church;
2. Student counseling;
3. The respectable teaching of re
ligion;
4. Activities, under a representa
tive student council.
Whatever is done with the latter.

I can promise that you who read
this sheet are goiny to plan, steer,
and manage it.
We're out for "good religion/'
There are religions good and bad.
Some of them aren't worth the room
they occupy in this world, some are
fantastic foolishness. Evidently a
lot of young people have met up only
with that kind.
But no fellow who respects his
own integrity and suspects even a
liitle of what life demands of him
is going to niche the good sort oi
religion. There arc good kinds. At
least he will give them a fair chance
to present credentials. If they stand
up he'll go along further; then he'll
demand they yield their secret.
That goes for each of us, even for
the most blue-jeaned sophisticate
on this famous Farm.
So, all aboard for this adventure!
Around the chancel in Memorial
Church are a lot of niches—l 2 in
all—-?md I suppose there was one
built for each of Christ's 12 Dis
ciples.
Once each held a statue, but the
earthquake shook them out, and
now they are just empty basins. On
Sundays we stick palms in them,
so they won't appear so barren. But
they are empty. And there is a
parable:
Disciples won't abide being niched
—they've got to get down and out
on the road. Then they're "Apostles."
Religion is alive; thus may our pro
gram be.


That's one of the improvements made by the Women's Counselor
PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain

We're out for "good religion/'
There are religions good and bad.
Some of them aren't worth the room
they occupy in this world, some are
fantastic foolishness. Evidently a
lot of young people have met up only
with that kind.
But no fellow who respects his
own integrity and suspects even a
liitle of what life demands of him
is going to niche the good sort oi
religion. There arc good kinds. At
least he will give them a fair chance
to present credentials. If they stand
up he'll go along further; then he'll
demand they yield their secret.
That goes for each of us, even for
the most blue-jeaned sophisticate
on this famous Farm.
So, all aboard for this adventure!
Around the chancel in Memorial
Church are a lot of niches—l 2 in
all—-?md I suppose there was one
built for each of Christ's 12 Dis
ciples.
Once each held a statue, but the
earthquake shook them out, and
now they are just empty basins. On
Sundays we stick palms in them,
so they won't appear so barren. But
they are empty. And there is a
parable:
Disciples won't abide being niched
—they've got to get down and out
on the road. Then they're "Apostles."
Religion is alive; thus may our pro
gram be.


That's one of the improvements made by the Women's Counselor
PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain
How do you do! Only, l refuse to
be put in a niche! Try as yon will
to shove me and what I represent
into a pigeon-hole, I won't bo
shelved. Wrap me round and round
with your simulated indifference,
fetter me with your prejudices, ball
and chain me with your natural
doubts; I'll out-magic Houdini and
.suddenly appear in the most amazing
places.
This I propose to do at Stanford!
Presumptuous, is it? No! Just "real
istic."
No one con stop me. because I can
get at anyone where he is most vul
nerable. Man may be born an ani
mal. but he is a religious animal
and he can't shed his nature. Aware
of this, Stanford's Administration
has prepared to put religion back
into the center of this campus, as
the Founder wished and dreamed.
That's why Minto and I are here,
with a lot of help already flowing in.
The Daily Editor has generously
given me some space which I am to
use each Friday to outline the proc
ess. It's very decent of him. I dare
you to read this column! Here I am
to present our "program." It falls
into four main parts:
1. Worship in the Church;
2. Student counseling;
3. The respectable teaching of re
ligion;
4. Activities, under a representa
tive student council.
Whatever is done with the latter.
