## Soph ’Bruise Boys’ Answer Challenge 
### 
To the Editor:
We think it should be brought to
the attention of the Frosh Frooties
that they are about to tangle with
a class that has never let anyone
stand in its way. After our machine
has rolled over you, your mangled
bodies won't be worth dog food.
Remember that our men's team
was also unbeaten when they were
frosh, and since then they have
steadily improved. Our contestants
are all Stanford Roughs, and will

smear you in the Saturday games.
As for the girls' football game, we
quote Triple Threat Galegos: "After
the game their name will be mud:
in fact, their faces, their tresses,
their dresses, are m-u-d."
Face the facts, rosy-cheeked lads
and fragile beasties, we have the
Jamboree sewed up. When it's all
over, you can cry in your beer and
look in admiration upon the mighty
class of '51.
With pity in our hearts, we remain:
