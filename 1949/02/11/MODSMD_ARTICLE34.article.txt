as pass-catchers.

center; Barbara Metzger, and Dot
Thomas, a plunging defensive tackle,
according to August. August's
coaching staff includes Dick Abra
ham. offensive line coach; Terry
Waters, defensive line coach; Tom
Shaw, Joe Cusick, and Jim Zwernc

McColl proclaimed psychology was

ponents.
Uniforms for the game will be
white sweat shirts with red jerseys
tor the sophs and white jerseys for
the frosh.
