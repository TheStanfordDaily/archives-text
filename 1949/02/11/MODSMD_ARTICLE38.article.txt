# Clash Recalls Violent Past
## 
### MARGE McKEON 
Rivalry between neophyte fresh
men and "veteran" sophomores has
been campus tradition on the Farm
since Encina first housed a rough.
Last year, breaking a precedent of
mud fights and "tie-ups," '50 and
'51 initiated the Frosh-Soph Jam
boree. setting an all-time high in
competition with a weekend battle
of wits, strength, and agility.
Men of the classes of '09 and 10
surged on to the football field for
a half-hour clash in the first or
ganized lower division competition
in 1906, ending with a sophomore
victory.
Setting a tradition to be resur
rected and discarded many times
during the following 25 years, lower
division men of 1907 initiated the
"frosh - soph tie-up." This was a
unique contest in which first- and
second-year men battled to capture
their opponents and bind them with
rope. The sophs triumphed in the
first clash.
Preceding the 1920 "tie-up," a
"state of war" was declared as the
men of '23 and '24 camped cn the
banks of Lake Lag until 3 a.m.
when they surged up the Row to
the Duke house lawn. '"The shot
was fired, '23 and '24 met. and the
water began to flow.'" Only a 4 a.m.
deadline on the fight stopped the
man-made shower.
The first lower-division mud fight
took place in the bed of Lake Lag
in 1925. The mud fight tradition,
brought back in 1931, was culmi
nated in 1936 as the second-year
men dumped 200 neophyte rivals in
the specially prepared mud pit.
Climaxing more than 50 years of
lower division battles, the first an
nual Frosh-Soph Jamboree came
into existence last year as '50 and
51 went all-out to include both
men and women in clashes of wit,
speed, and strength.
