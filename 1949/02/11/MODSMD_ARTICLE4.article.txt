# Kimpton Speaks Of Honor System On Station KSU
## 
### 
"'Third - person responsibility as
associated with the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard" was dis
cussed in a panel interview with
Dean Lawrence Kimpton over KSU
last night.
Appearing on the program with
Kimpton were Marilyn Janeck,
Shirley Rogers, Tom Diamond, and
Hawley Smith. Townsend Brown
was moderator.
The question of responsibility for
reporting another woman in vio
lations of the Fundamental Stand
ard was answered by Miss Janeck,
who stated that in obvious cases in
volving a definite University rule,
such as the late leave system, a
witness is responsible lor reporting
the instance.
However, Miss Janeck added, in
instances which involve a personal
morality standard, Council feels it
is up to each individual whether
she reports it.
Women who do not report vio
lations of the Fundamental Stand
ard are given minor penalties, she
said.
"How does the faculty feel about
the Honor Code?" Dean Kimpton
was asked. He stated that most
professors are very pleased with
the system. Diamond said that most
honor infractions are turned in by
professors to Men's Council.
Smith said that many classes
themselves are responsible for
Honor Code violations. Such classes
should be turned in to the commit
tee, which tries to solve the prob
lem. At present, he said, there has
been trouble with large lower di
vision courses.
