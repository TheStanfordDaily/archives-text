# Card Nine to Arrest SF Police Saturday
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Old Man Weather will hold the
upper hand out at the Sunken Dia
mond tomorrow afternoon as the
Farm horsehiders once again try to
yet Lheir lengthy six-month season
under way.
With the permission of the ele
ments. Harry Wolter's potent willow
wielders will level their bats and
fire away at the invading San Fran
cisco Police Department nine in a
non-confeernce game beginning at
2:30.
But with threatening skies over
head and a forecast of more wet
weather to come, chances are that
the curtain raiser will be put off
another week. The scheduled open
er between the Indians and the
semi - pro Moffat Mantecas was
washed out lust Saturday.
Practice Washed Out
It's be en a gloomy week out at
the practice field as the intermittent
downpours have literally washed a
much-needed week of work down
the drain.
The pitchers and catchers have
found time between showers lo
hold daily workouts but infield ac
tivity has been virtually nil, and
the outfielders chased just enough
fly balls this week for Bud Klein to
sprain his ankle in the soggy going.
Coach Harry Wolter yesterday
switched around his starting lineup
for tomorrow's game, and at the
same time indicated that more
changes are forthcoming in an at
tempt to get the best nine men on
the field.
AH Positions Wide Open
"All positions are still wide open.''
says Coach Harry, and chances are
that they will remain so until after
the Cards get a few games under
their belts.
The biggest shift to dale finds
first sacker Consistent Charlie Cole
out in center field with footballers
Ken Rose and Jack Barnes dividing
time on first base.
Cole has the speed and throwing
arm to make him a first-class out
fielder. while the heavy - hitting
Rose seems to be more at home in
the infield.
Dingfelder May Start
Starting time will find Blasting
Bob Nava out in right field, and
probably Bud Klein in left. If
Klein's ankle fails to respond, then
hustling Clyde Dingfclder wili
probably fill in.
Big Jim Castagnoli will share his
backstop duties with letterman
Frank McGraw, and Ray Winter
halter will start at second. Dave
Melton at short, and Captain Bill
Arce on the hot corner.
Pitchers Dave Dahl, Frank La-
Brum, and Dave Stott will all see
action before the afternoon is over,
but Dahle will probably get the
starting nod.
