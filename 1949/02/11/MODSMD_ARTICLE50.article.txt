# Femmes Try Grid Tactics
## 
### JOHN HALL 
S'i'er posh sakes!
The flimsy femmes will step out
of character tomorrow alternoon to
have at it in the best of manly con
flicts â€”football.
It's all on the level, say the girls,
and they will show up at 1:15 p.m.
on the intramural field to prove it.
Starting timidly as a gag for the
Frosh - Sophomore Jamboree, the
girls decided that they knew a good
thing when they saw it, and roared
into the present plan.
Coaches and Everything
Complete with coaching staffs,
formal practice sessions, and the old
battle cry of "We'll murder you
bums," the girlies have been hitting
the sod with grit and grimace these
past afternoons, getting ready for
the big tilt.
Tutored by varsity footballers
Tom August, Tom Shaw. Dick
Abraham, and Joe Cusick, the
sophomore babes figure to rate a
slight edge over the less experi
enced frosh women. However, you
never can tell in the Gurl Game, as
spirit runs high and the old will to
win reigns supreme.
Led by Captain Ann Peterson,
who handles one of the wing jobs,
the sophs plan to run the frosh dizzy
with some razzle-dazzle twin dyna
mite at the half spots.
Wadswort h W;zaid ry
Look-alikes Charlotte and Caro
line Wadsworth will supply the raz
zle, while the Rousseaus, Olive and
Rosemary, will furnish the dazzle.
"The sophomore spirit is running
high," stated assistant coach Joe
Cusick. "The girls have been put
ting out for us all week."
The freshman cuties aren't wor
ric'l by this, however. They have
also been going at it all week. And
for a coaching staff, the first-year
girls have grabbed off Harry Huga
sian. Bill McColl, and Gary Ker
korian, a trio of talented bozos who
have never lost a game under Stan
ford colors.
Platoon Systems Yet
Both squads will use the platoon
system, which gives evidence of
depth in the ranks, or at least that
there are more girls hanging around
than Bill Daily gives them credit
for.
So man the guns, run for your
lives, it's the first organized Gurl
Game.
It may set Stanford ahead at
least 50 years.
