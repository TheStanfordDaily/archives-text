### JOHN HALL 
SOPHOMORES FRESHMEN
Name size Pos. Size Name
BUCKLEY Short LER Tall JONES
Experienced Pat, sharp and steady at receiving passes, will get the initial
call at end. Her opponent, Ambling Alice Jones, only in her first year,
needs added experience. EDGE: PAT.
PETERSON All There REL Her Too MONTAGUE
Trigger-Toes Annie-gurl. Co-captain and spark of the second-year outfit,
is a master at the art of defense. Fast, but definitely. Shifty-hipped
Louise Montague, plenty potent on ends around, is expected to be at her
best against the sophomore passes. EDGE: ANN.
PRICE Tall RGL Red Hair FISH
Midge grabs the starting assignment off her spirited showing in the Gai
eties. Any gal who can sing can play football. I love red hair. Gosh,
mcfcfce she can p'ay football, too. EDGE: JOAN.
THOMAS Big RTL Blonde BR.IDENBAUGH
Dot's a good name for a football girl, has lots of power; will be in the
thick of things. I like blonde hair, too. EDGE: JEAN.
REICHLING Firm C Slim PETIT
Mangling Mitzie, the fireball of the front line, co-captain and goodie
of the Soph stalwarts, is the pride and joy of Coach Tom Shaw. Petite
Julie Petit, the Frosh version of Lauren Bacall, will be hustling all the
way. EDGE: MITZIE.
POTTINGER Tall LGR Medium CASELLA
Margy Pottinger guards 'em rood. Has a lot of hustle, and her friends
call her "Potty." Shirley, the tall blonde, not Regal Pale, will give Marge
a battle all the way. EDGE: POTTY.
LEVIN Solid LTR Slim STRODE
Aljean, the movie critic turned gridder, will be difficult to move out of
position. Is good on the ground game. Shirley, no relation to the Woodrow
who played end for UCLA a few years back, but has a few talents of
her own, anyway. EDGE: STRODE.
METZGER Tiny Q Baby-face KINNEY
Battlin' Barb, great play-maker and field general, will toss her 90 pounds
of heft around with plenty of ability. Sideline Sally, serves notice of
carrying out Gary Kerkorian's orders right to the letter. With fire, she
could quarterback her club to victory. EDGE: METZGER.
WADSWORTII Ready LIIR Brunette BRUMMEL
Caroline, or Charlotte, gives with the double-trouble, mystery for the
Frosh, and fun for the coaches. Caroline handles the left half spot, handles
the Phi Delts, too! Marian is nice for a girl. As a football player, you
never can tell. EDGE: WADSWOKTH. Caroline, that is.
WADSWORTH Always RHL Good GALLEGOS
Charlotte, tabbed tubby, is too cute to mess around with this grid game.
Oh well, when the Wadsworths get tired, Olive and Rosemary Rousseu
will take over. This gets more interesting all the time. Jumping Joan
Galeglos, triple-threat captain of the greenies, hits hard, runs well, and
that's all you want of a gurl. OLIVE.
MITCHELL Medium F Small TICE
What's in a name, or are fullbacks named Mitchell? Ellen ain't Emery,
but she'll be in there charging. They say Joan will attempt to cn-TICE
the officials, but either way nobody will lose. It's all in a day's work.
EDGE: It's enTICING.
