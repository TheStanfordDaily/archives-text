# Pope May Invoke Grave Church Ban
## 
### 
VATICAN CITIY, Feb. 13 (JP)—
Vatican circles said today anathema
—the most dreaded and awesome
form of excommunication in the Ro
man Catholic Church—conceivably
may be invoked against the foes of
Josef Cardinal Mindszenty at to
morrow's extraordinary Papal Con
sistory.
Spokesmen said they do not ex
pect the invocation of anathema—
but that it should not be ruled out
as impossible. The Vatican has not
disclosed its plans.
Meanwhile, the United States gov
ernment is expected to decide this
week whether to expel Hungarian
Minister Andrew Sik in retaliation
for the forced recall of the American
envoy to Budapest, Selden Chapin.
Diplomatic informants here specu
lated that action against Sik might
be the next important move in the
whirlwind of bitterness between
Washington and Budapest growing
out of Communist Hungary's treason
trial of Cardinal Mindszenty.
