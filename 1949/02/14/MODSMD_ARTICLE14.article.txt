# Southern Teams Ruin Card Cagers
## Trojans Wallop Indians, 54 to 44; UCLA Completes Rout, 59 to 48 
### JOHN HALL 
The black armbands are out this morning gentlemen! The
cnce high-powered prestige of tfte Stanford basketball playinc
Indians is dead, gone, and buried.
Stanford went south looking for a clean-cut lead in the South
ern Division. To say the least, the Indians didn't find it.

Instead, they returned to Farm
twice-beaten, humiliated, and barely
out of the cellar. Eleven- and 10-
point losses became the story.
SC's burly but efficient Trojans
started the funeral march when they
pummeled our boys, 54 to 44, on
Friday night. UCLA hit off and easy.
39 to 48 Saturday night.
The SC game was close for the
first eight minutes, at which time
Stanford led, 8 to 7. But suddenh
the bottom dropped out, and USC
whipped in enough points to leat
22 to 15 at half.
From there it got worse. Stanford
was futile in its efforts to get back
in the ballgame. Dave Davidson anc"
Marv Gelber sparked one drive that
closed the gap to 29 to 25 with 10
minutes remaining, but the sensa
tional Bill Sharman and a new Tro
jan gorilla named Bob Kolf put out
the fire.
Friday night Stanford started fast,
looked for a moment to be its old
self, but UCLA's half-good quintet
began to get basket-happy, and the
Cards couldn't stay with it.
Allan Sawyer pushed in 20 points,
his best showing of the season, to
lead the home-playing Bruins to
their 59 to 48 win.
The two games were the worst the
Deanmen have turned in all year.
Friday nifht at the Olympic they
were pitiful, and didn't even come
close to resembling the Stanford
team which won 17 games previous,
and was the toast of the pre-season
Cow Palace patrons.
Tlie Olympic Auditorium crowd
was one of the most vicious group
of bench-jockeys I've seen this sea
son. From the moment George Yard-
Icy stepped out on the floor, he was
the target for organized cat-calling,
abuse, and general bad taste.
To make matters worse, George
played his poorest game of the year.
The shots he did get free to take, he .
missed by miles. His floor game was 1
off, and he wasn't on the boards. His 1
four persona] fouls in the first min
utes of play offer some excuse, but
he still was a great disappointment
to the Los Angeles fans.
The entire team was a disappoint
ment. "Completely inadequate," said
the Examiner's Bob Hunter.
"Strangely inept," said the Mirror's
Charley Park. And the wordy Mr.
Hunter added. ''The Indians couldn't
hit the basket with a handful of
rice."
Davidson. Gclber Star
Dave Davidson and Marv Geiber
were standouts lor Stanford against
USC, both lighting all the way. Gei
ber played one of his best games,
but his j. ood performance wasn't
catching.
Saturday night was more of a
shock than Friday night. Stanford
had polished off UCLA twice pre
viously, and started more of the same
with a 26 to 21 hall time lead this
time.
But UCLA, fighting desperately :
to maintain its record of never hav
ing lost a game on its home floor j
this season, came back to completely [
outclass Stanford.
It wasn't a matter of the Indians j
letting down. That is the sad part of
the story. They were giving their j
all, fighting hard, dead game, but!
the Cards just didn't have the stuff.
Cards Helpless
Here was a team that was beaten.
They were helpless in the latter j
stages of the game, as UCLA ran!
its way to an 11-point victory.
Bill Stephenson turned in a good
game, as he did against USC on j
the backboards. He spent the final ,
moments chasing the Bruins all over
the floor, not giving up.
The double defeat gives Stanford a
3-3 rccord in the division and fol
lowing California's Saturday night
upset over USC, a meek third place
in the standings.
UCLA and USC are tied for first
with 4-2 records, and California i
brings up the rear with a 1-5 sea
sonal effort.
Next week USC and UCLA will be i
back in the Bay Area to open the
next chapter in the divisional cage I
race. Stanford will have one more
chance to get back where it belongs.

Stanford went south looking for a clean-cut lead in the South

Instead, they returned to Farm
twice-beaten, humiliated, and barely
out of the cellar. Eleven- and 10-

The SC game was close for the
first eight minutes, at which time
Stanford led, 8 to 7. But suddenh
the bottom dropped out, and USC
whipped in enough points to leat
22 to 15 at half.
From there it got worse. Stanford
was futile in its efforts to get back
in the ballgame. Dave Davidson anc"

closed the gap to 29 to 25 with 10
minutes remaining, but the sensa

jan gorilla named Bob Kolf put out
the fire.
Friday night Stanford started fast,

his best showing of the season, to

The two games were the worst the

Friday nifht at the Olympic they
were pitiful, and didn't even come
close to resembling the Stanford
team which won 17 games previous,
and was the toast of the pre-season
Cow Palace patrons.
Tlie Olympic Auditorium crowd
was one of the most vicious group
of bench-jockeys I've seen this sea
son. From the moment George Yard-
Icy stepped out on the floor, he was
the target for organized cat-calling,
abuse, and general bad taste.
To make matters worse, George
played his poorest game of the year.
The shots he did get free to take, he .
missed by miles. His floor game was 1
off, and he wasn't on the boards. His 1
four persona] fouls in the first min
utes of play offer some excuse, but
he still was a great disappointment
to the Los Angeles fans.
The entire team was a disappoint
ment. "Completely inadequate," said
the Examiner's Bob Hunter.
"Strangely inept," said the Mirror's
Charley Park. And the wordy Mr.
Hunter added. ''The Indians couldn't
hit the basket with a handful of
rice."

Saturday night was more of a

had polished off UCLA twice pre
viously, and started more of the same
with a 26 to 21 hall time lead this
time.
But UCLA, fighting desperately :
to maintain its record of never hav
ing lost a game on its home floor j
this season, came back to completely [

It wasn't a matter of the Indians j

the story. They were giving their j

stages of the game, as UCLA ran!
its way to an 11-point victory.
Bill Stephenson turned in a good
game, as he did against USC on j
the backboards. He spent the final ,
moments chasing the Bruins all over
the floor, not giving up.
The double defeat gives Stanford a
3-3 rccord in the division and fol
lowing California's Saturday night
upset over USC, a meek third place
in the standings.
UCLA and USC are tied for first
with 4-2 records, and California i
brings up the rear with a 1-5 sea
sonal effort.
Next week USC and UCLA will be i
back in the Bay Area to open the
next chapter in the divisional cage I
race. Stanford will have one more
chance to get back where it belongs.
The black armbands are out this morning gentlemen! The
cnce high-powered prestige of tfte Stanford basketball playinc
Indians is dead, gone, and buried.
Stanford went south looking for a clean-cut lead in the South
ern Division. To say the least, the Indians didn't find it.

Instead, they returned to Farm
twice-beaten, humiliated, and barely
out of the cellar. Eleven- and 10-
point losses became the story.
SC's burly but efficient Trojans
started the funeral march when they
pummeled our boys, 54 to 44, on
Friday night. UCLA hit off and easy.
39 to 48 Saturday night.
The SC game was close for the
first eight minutes, at which time
Stanford led, 8 to 7. But suddenh
the bottom dropped out, and USC
whipped in enough points to leat
22 to 15 at half.
From there it got worse. Stanford
was futile in its efforts to get back
in the ballgame. Dave Davidson anc"
Marv Gelber sparked one drive that
closed the gap to 29 to 25 with 10
minutes remaining, but the sensa
tional Bill Sharman and a new Tro
jan gorilla named Bob Kolf put out
the fire.
Friday night Stanford started fast,
looked for a moment to be its old
self, but UCLA's half-good quintet
began to get basket-happy, and the
Cards couldn't stay with it.
Allan Sawyer pushed in 20 points,
his best showing of the season, to
lead the home-playing Bruins to
their 59 to 48 win.
The two games were the worst the
Deanmen have turned in all year.
Friday nifht at the Olympic they
were pitiful, and didn't even come
close to resembling the Stanford
team which won 17 games previous,
and was the toast of the pre-season
Cow Palace patrons.
Tlie Olympic Auditorium crowd
was one of the most vicious group
of bench-jockeys I've seen this sea
son. From the moment George Yard-
Icy stepped out on the floor, he was
the target for organized cat-calling,
abuse, and general bad taste.
To make matters worse, George
played his poorest game of the year.
The shots he did get free to take, he .
missed by miles. His floor game was 1
off, and he wasn't on the boards. His 1
four persona] fouls in the first min
utes of play offer some excuse, but
he still was a great disappointment
to the Los Angeles fans.
The entire team was a disappoint
ment. "Completely inadequate," said
the Examiner's Bob Hunter.
"Strangely inept," said the Mirror's
Charley Park. And the wordy Mr.
Hunter added. ''The Indians couldn't
hit the basket with a handful of
rice."
Davidson. Gclber Star
Dave Davidson and Marv Geiber
were standouts lor Stanford against
USC, both lighting all the way. Gei
ber played one of his best games,
but his j. ood performance wasn't
catching.
Saturday night was more of a
shock than Friday night. Stanford
had polished off UCLA twice pre
viously, and started more of the same
with a 26 to 21 hall time lead this
time.
But UCLA, fighting desperately :
to maintain its record of never hav
ing lost a game on its home floor j
this season, came back to completely [
outclass Stanford.
It wasn't a matter of the Indians j
letting down. That is the sad part of
the story. They were giving their j
all, fighting hard, dead game, but!
the Cards just didn't have the stuff.
