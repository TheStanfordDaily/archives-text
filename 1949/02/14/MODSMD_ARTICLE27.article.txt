Two items cf general interest disturbed us at last Wednesday's
Excom meeting.
The first one concerned the hurried passage of the Foreign
Scholarship and grants-in-aid programs for next year when pro
ponents of each project reached a compromise financial agree
ment. Although we need both programs, little factual material
was presented on the value of the two projects as compared with
other ASSU projects. Furthermore, no data was given to show
which of the two projects could do the most good to the student
body. The cost of supporting one foreign student at Stanford,
ior instance, would pay for enough grants-in-aid allotments to
keep 10 or 12 students from dropping out of school. On the
other hand, no definite proof was presented to show Excom that
higher tuition costs have created a need for additional grants
jn-aid.
You might say that the two projects were passed by Excom on
:he basis of circumstantial evidence. We cannot agree with such
action for two reasons. First, a very large amount of money—
$9,000 —was involved. Secondly, the facts were available to any
students wishing to take the time to find Ihem.
Both of the programs deserved and had Excom support, but
proof of their need to the students was lacking because opinion
and estimates were dominant at the meeting.
Our other criticism of Wednesday's meeting actually concerns
FSP mechanics.
Next year's FSP may be limited to European students. Basis
for such geographic centralization is that "We have a large num
ber of Eastern students at Stanford already, but we have very
iew European students," the FSP chairman told Excom.
We take exception with such reasoning. Why diminish the
value of a foreign scholarship program by limiting its candi
dates to one race? Where are our representatives from Japan
and Indonesia that are "already at Stanford?" The purpose of
the FSP is to promote international understanding and good will.
It is not maintained with the idea of bringing over students only
from countries not represented at this time in the University.
How can we overlook the Far East at a time when Communism
is becoming more powerful? Japan and Indonesia may be the
next countries to go communistic in government unless the
Western countries can show them good reasons for remaining
democratic. Two FSP students coming to Stanford from that
area would be a step in the right direction.

Our other criticism of Wednesday's meeting actually concerns
FSP mechanics.
Next year's FSP may be limited to European students. Basis
for such geographic centralization is that "We have a large num
ber of Eastern students at Stanford already, but we have very
iew European students," the FSP chairman told Excom.
We take exception with such reasoning. Why diminish the
value of a foreign scholarship program by limiting its candi
dates to one race? Where are our representatives from Japan
and Indonesia that are "already at Stanford?" The purpose of
the FSP is to promote international understanding and good will.
It is not maintained with the idea of bringing over students only
from countries not represented at this time in the University.
How can we overlook the Far East at a time when Communism
is becoming more powerful? Japan and Indonesia may be the
next countries to go communistic in government unless the
Western countries can show them good reasons for remaining
democratic. Two FSP students coming to Stanford from that
area would be a step in the right direction.
