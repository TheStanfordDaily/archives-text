I'll never forget the first time I met her—and don't think I haven't tried.
I won't say how it happened, but it sure cured me of whistling.
I was down in the Cellar when the effects of 17 cups of codec took
iheir toll. Slowly I collapsed to the floor, and there she was—lying under
a table with a 1915 rooter's ticket clasped in her little hand.
The aroma of faint perfume clung to her tenderly—Schenley No. 5.
I say faint perfume because it made you want to do just that. She looked
beautiful that afternoon. She looked as if she had just stepped out of
Vo^ue —and fell flat on her face.
I knew at once she was a lady. She had just come out of a room marked
that.
Ah, but those lips, those ears, those cheeks, that eye. She had lips
ike petals—pedals on a bicycle .... a schoolgirl complexion with big
diplomas under her eyes. She had shiny black hair and nails to match.
And her teeth! They were like sparkling water—Seven-Up.
There were so many cavities in her teeth she talked with an echo. But
she was strictly a Stanford coed. You know what a coed is. That's a
sweater with a high IQ.
She wore a sweater for three reasons. One, it kept her warm. The
other two reasons were obvious.
We used to stroll in the woods at Rossotti's and pick flowers. Occa
sionally her roommate would follow us and then we HAD to pick flowers.
She never liked swimming; it made her feet too big. She never liked
tennis; it made her arms too big. She never like horseback riding; it made
her ....
She once went out with a Row man she thought was the strong, silent
type. Then she found out he was suffering from halitosis and had to keep
his mouth shut.
She said she was an old fashioned girl, and drank a dozen of them to
convince me.
But then tragedy struck. I still remember that last day when I asked
her if I could kiss her hand and she looked at me so sweetly and said.
"Whassa matter, is my mouth dirty?"
She said she was going to lose 50 pounds in two weeks. I didn't think
she could do it, but in two weeks she went down from 200 to 150 pounds—
casket and all.
They found $5,000 sewed in her bustle. That's an awful lot of money to
?eave behind. You know what a bustle is. It's nothing but a deceitful
seatful. ✓
Now every Sunday I visit her pave with that tender inscription upon
the headstone, "She was just a Communist's daughter, but everyone
got his share."

iheir toll. Slowly I collapsed to the floor, and there she was—lying under
a table with a 1915 rooter's ticket clasped in her little hand.
The aroma of faint perfume clung to her tenderly—Schenley No. 5.
I say faint perfume because it made you want to do just that. She looked
beautiful that afternoon. She looked as if she had just stepped out of
Vo^ue —and fell flat on her face.
I knew at once she was a lady. She had just come out of a room marked
that.
Ah, but those lips, those ears, those cheeks, that eye. She had lips
ike petals—pedals on a bicycle .... a schoolgirl complexion with big
diplomas under her eyes. She had shiny black hair and nails to match.
And her teeth! They were like sparkling water—Seven-Up.
There were so many cavities in her teeth she talked with an echo. But
she was strictly a Stanford coed. You know what a coed is. That's a
sweater with a high IQ.
She wore a sweater for three reasons. One, it kept her warm. The
other two reasons were obvious.
We used to stroll in the woods at Rossotti's and pick flowers. Occa
sionally her roommate would follow us and then we HAD to pick flowers.
She never liked swimming; it made her feet too big. She never liked
tennis; it made her arms too big. She never like horseback riding; it made
her ....
She once went out with a Row man she thought was the strong, silent
type. Then she found out he was suffering from halitosis and had to keep
his mouth shut.
She said she was an old fashioned girl, and drank a dozen of them to
convince me.
But then tragedy struck. I still remember that last day when I asked
her if I could kiss her hand and she looked at me so sweetly and said.
"Whassa matter, is my mouth dirty?"
She said she was going to lose 50 pounds in two weeks. I didn't think
she could do it, but in two weeks she went down from 200 to 150 pounds—
casket and all.
They found $5,000 sewed in her bustle. That's an awful lot of money to
?eave behind. You know what a bustle is. It's nothing but a deceitful
seatful. ✓
Now every Sunday I visit her pave with that tender inscription upon
the headstone, "She was just a Communist's daughter, but everyone
got his share."
I'll never forget the first time I met her—and don't think I haven't tried.
I won't say how it happened, but it sure cured me of whistling.
I was down in the Cellar when the effects of 17 cups of codec took
iheir toll. Slowly I collapsed to the floor, and there she was—lying under
a table with a 1915 rooter's ticket clasped in her little hand.
