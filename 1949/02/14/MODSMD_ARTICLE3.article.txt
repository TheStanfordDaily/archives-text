# Rowmen Hold Open House This Tuesday
## 
### 
Stanford's 24 fraternities will hold
open houses tomorrow night from
7:30 to 9:30 principally for the ben
efit of those who were unable to see
the houses earlier in the quarter
during the annual pre-rushing pro
gram.
The additional open house date
was decided upon unanimously last
Tuesday night at a meeting of the
Intel fraternity Council, headed by
President Ted LeVino.
LeVino said the council felt that
many men interested in fraternities,
especially freshmen, were unavoid
ably unable to attend the earlier
open houses.
He said the lack of enough open
houses is considered the major de
fect in this year's rushing program,
and that more of them are being
scheduled for next year.
Many Encina freshmen, during
the two-week rushing season, ex
pressed a desire for more open
houses. LeVino said IFC was un
able to hold additinal dates at that
time because the rushing program
was already under way and fra
ternity schedules were too tight to
admit any more engagements.
