When first we began writing this
column we had intended it to be
full of comments on various aspects
of life in these here parts, spiced
with a bit of tart criticism here
and there, and on the whole a thing
of Jovian and jovial commentaries.
But through the quirks of imagina
i tion-run-riot and uncontrollable cir
! eumstances, we found ourselves
| shuttled into the limbo of quasi
j Bull Session with no return ticket
I in sight.
Therefore, for the time being at
' any rate, we decided temporarily to
j abandon our previous sallies into the
J local cul de sacs for a more seeming
; and pertinent discussion on already
j existing vagaries.
| With foregoing in mind, we have
j chosen a topic for today that returns
jus to our first love: sports. And along
J with several thousand other Stan
! fordites, we too are wondering,
j "What happened to our basketball
j team?"
Frankly, we don't know. But we
! do have some ideas which we pass
| along to you for what they're worth,
i And our first precocious thought was
j that the hoop casabers haven't been
j scoring enough points.
Shooting Okay
Th« first reaction to this is that the
! shooting is off. but the reason
| this is not that the boys have simply
: lost their "eye." Having seen the
j Indians play their first 20 games, we
| don't think their shooting is any
j worse now than when they first
; started out this season.
i It isn't the shooting that's off,
they're just not getting the same
I shots they used to. In other words,
the local team is still playing the
; same brand of cute basketball that
! gave them a 17-2 record up to two
weeks ago. The difference is due to
the type of defenses their opponents
! are playing against them.
The best probable way of beating a
. team like Stanford, i.e.. semi-fast
break, is outmuscle them in the
| area referred to as the "circle." That
j is roughly a circumference drawn
j on a 20-foot radius from the hoop,
j The Indians did it to Yale and USF.
j And everybody else is doing it to the
1 Indians now. If you keep pressing,
j keep 'em off-balance, keep working
! them over under the boards, you
| can beat 'em. And we don't mean
| dirty basketball, we mean hard bas
| ketball. The difference is a moot
j point.
Downfall Before CCNY
The Stanford downfall didn't start
j with CCNY. You can throw that
; game out; the imports were playing
so far over their heads that night,
they haven't come up for air yet. It
| started long before, when Sam Barry
j got a look at the willow-wands and
decided that his beef trust (Pelka,
, Bertram, and Christie) could handle
I them in the circle.
And they did, very, very effec
! lively. And I'll bet you an Encina
J cookie that UCLA's Johnny Wooden
i told his boys at halftime to get
! tougher in the circle and they could
! take the hamburgers. In the second
half they did.
Far be it from us to second-guess
Everett Dean in regard to what
course of action he will take in re
| buttal to these tactics. But we do
know that it will avail him little un
less some ol the bigger babies on his
; ball-club are taken in hand and
I shown the error ol their ways
We fail to see the humor in the
i situation in which fair material is
worked into a good (sometimes un
justifiably called "great") ball-club,
only lo have it fall apart in a well
known bistro over a bale of press
clippings.
Perhaps things were too easy at
j the start and the kids have run out
! of gas late in the season when it's
! needed most for the stretch drive.
| Perhaps .they weren't much to start
with and have used up their share
of luck. Perhaps there aren't enough
hard-working married men on the
squad to take up the slack when the
; punk brats dope off.
As we said earlier, take it for what
' it's worth.

Downfall Before CCNY
The Stanford downfall didn't start

; game out; the imports were playing
so far over their heads that night,
they haven't come up for air yet. It
| started long before, when Sam Barry
j got a look at the willow-wands and
decided that his beef trust (Pelka,
, Bertram, and Christie) could handle
I them in the circle.
And they did, very, very effec
! lively. And I'll bet you an Encina
J cookie that UCLA's Johnny Wooden
i told his boys at halftime to get
! tougher in the circle and they could
! take the hamburgers. In the second
half they did.
Far be it from us to second-guess
Everett Dean in regard to what
course of action he will take in re
| buttal to these tactics. But we do
know that it will avail him little un
less some ol the bigger babies on his
; ball-club are taken in hand and
I shown the error ol their ways
We fail to see the humor in the
i situation in which fair material is
worked into a good (sometimes un
justifiably called "great") ball-club,
only lo have it fall apart in a well
known bistro over a bale of press
clippings.
Perhaps things were too easy at
j the start and the kids have run out
! of gas late in the season when it's
! needed most for the stretch drive.
| Perhaps .they weren't much to start

of luck. Perhaps there aren't enough
hard-working married men on the

We fail to see the humor in the
i situation in which fair material is
worked into a good (sometimes un
justifiably called "great") ball-club,
only lo have it fall apart in a well
known bistro over a bale of press
clippings.
Perhaps things were too easy at
j the start and the kids have run out
! of gas late in the season when it's
! needed most for the stretch drive.
| Perhaps .they weren't much to start
with and have used up their share
of luck. Perhaps there aren't enough
hard-working married men on the
squad to take up the slack when the
; punk brats dope off.
As we said earlier, take it for what
' it's worth.
