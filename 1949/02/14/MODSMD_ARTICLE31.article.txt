## European Impressions 
### 
Umberto started at me for a mo
\ ment. then extended a bony hand
and said, with a faint smile, "Bene
] serra."
As I murmured "Good evening" in
| return, the self-pity which I had
! felt as the result of 12 uncomfortable
! hours on the crowded bus from Na
ples suddenly melted into shame.
| Umberto's feet were bare and
swollen, and his face was covered
with the sores of malnutrition. Yet
he seemed glad just because we had
come.
I looked around at the other di-
I minutive citizens of this Villaggio
| del Fanciullo, or Village of Home
less Boys, which our relief group had
| come to visit. Like Umberto, no-'
of them wore shabby, ill-fitting
I clothes; their shoes, if they possessed
any, were cast-off army boots whose
I excessive size lent a grotesque, L'il
Abnerish effect to the wearer.
Dark circles had traced themselves
; under the eyes of even the smallest,
j and their stunted growth deceived us
i into judging them several years
younger than they actually were.
Physically, the Villaggio presented
only a collection of frugal buildings;
; spiritually, it was far more than that.
Disguising the whitewashed walls

were brightly painted birds, flowers,
and scenes of village life. Wherever
possible rough edges had been
smoothed, sharpness had been
rounded, and bareness beautified.
We sensed then what we later
learned was the guiding principle of
the Villaggio—that regardless of how
lacking one is in material comforts,
there is always some sort of beauty
to be found and enjoyed.
Meals Are Unbalanced
When the dinner gong rang our
group almost ran to the long, wooden
tables. We were famished. It had
been several days since we had eaten
what was, by our definition, "a
square meal." And then dinner was
set down before us—a bowl of maca
roni and a bit of bread.
Between gluttonous mouthfuls. we
noticed that the boys iite• without
great relish; then as they were, they
did not seem overly hungry. We
thought at first that the explanation
oi this phenomenon lay in the mo
notony of their diet, for bread and
macaroni comprised their noon and
evening meals day after day.
As we observed them further,
however, we concluded that it was
merely another manifestation of
their lack of emphasis upon material
things. They had subsisted for a long
time on just one meal a day; three
were almost superfluous.
When supper was finished and the
boys had gone to bed, one of the
Friends' Service Committee workers
told us the story of the Villaggio.
Gangs Form
During the Italian campaign in
the mountain districts of Abruzzi,
boys of all ages, whom the war had
deprived of their families and of all
means of livelihood, organized them
selves into a gang and lived by rob
bery. Finally, they were caught by
the police and locked up in the stable
of some ruined barracks in the town
of Lanciano.
Given little food and no clothing
or blankets, they would encourage
Stray dogs to come in. for by sleep
ing next to the animals they could
gain some warmth. It was on
Christmas Eve. 1945. that fortune
smiled—or at least grinned a little—
for they were found by Don Guido
Visendaz, a young Catholic priest
who had been sent to teach in a
nearby boarding school.
Laying aside his robes. Don Guido
donned a pair of khakis and with
the boys began to rebuild the stable
into a dormitory. A minimum of
outside moral and financial aid was
offered, and much of that which was
had to be refused because there
were "strings" attached which would
have precluded the Villaggio's re
maining non-sectarian and non
political.
Although the material accomplish
ments of the group—dormitories,
common rooms, workshops, a kitch
en. and even a little altar—were in
spiring, it was not they which most
impressed us. Rather, it was the fact
that these boys, who had been aban
doned by the world, who had no one
to care for or about them, and who
were fast becoming criminals, had
now become useful citizens in their
own small, self-governing commu
nity.
Boys Friendly
The boys were always friendly
and polite to us. Some grasped and
held our hands, hungry for affec
tion. Others demonstrated their de
sire to be friends in a more business
like way. With touching generosity
they would ofTer us more than our
share of their meager fare.
Dusk had just begun its descent
on the mountains when we followed
the boys out to the front of the main
building. We watched them form a
semi-circle around their (lag, and
then suddenly the song of the Vi 1—
laggio broke into the twilight still
ness.
In my own throat a lump began
to form. It was still light enough
for us to see that the owners of the
beautifully blended voices were not
the healthy, well-scrubbed members
of a boys' choir, but were instead
undernourished, unwashed, sallow.
The last notes of the song floated
up and out of hearing. As we
slowly filed back into the dormi
tory, none of us said anything; the
Villaggio, it seemed. ha<l spoken for
itself.
