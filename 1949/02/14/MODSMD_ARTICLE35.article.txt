# 'The Years Between' Is Charming, Too British
## 
### AL BERRY 
It's '"blood, sweat, toil, and tears"
time at the Guild Theater this week.
The wave of ten-year-old nostalgia
cronies in the form of a J. Arthur
Hank job somewhat mysteriously
called "The Years Between." Un
ike British movies in general, and
Guild movies in particular, this
.slow-moving pic is about as effec
tive as the Chinese Nationalist
army.
Most theater-goers will leave the
Guild's mobile seats wondering
whether or not they like "The
Years Between," and chances are
they will never be able to make up
their collective minds. The flick has
a great deal of charm; some of its
dialogue is brilliant; and many of
its scenes enchantingly tender. But
in spite of this, and in spite of some
very fine acting on the part of Val
erie Hobson. "The Years Between"
doesn't have the cards for a grand
slam, nor —in the light of cold dawn
does it even make its bid. Down
two, minus one hundred.
Too British
Besides noticing its obvious lack
>1' cohesion, most American audi
ences will find "The Years Be
ween" a bit too British, which is
11 most as bad as having it a bit too
Hollywood. To make matters worse.
Mr. Rank is waving the flag so hard
in this one that it is difficult to dis
tinguish the plot of Daphne Du
Mnurier's book from the clippings
oi the very correct British Informa
tion Service.
The plot goes this-a-way. The at
tractive wife of a British MP (Mem
ber of Parliament) receives word
that her beloved husband had been
killed in the war—the last one, that
is. She nearly cracks up in an
guish, but finally runs and is elected
to Parliament in hubby's place. She
falls in love with hubby's best
friend (Michael Redgrave), and
consents to marry him. Then—guess
what hubby comes back. He hasn't
•icon dead at all: he has been lead
ing the underground movement.
Audience Blinded
From this point on. the audience
can't see the screen for the Union

Jack, and the well of problems that
arise to face our Mrs. Miniver-like
heroine. The picture ends with a
solution, but nobody seems to know
whether the ending is happy or not.
We are sorry that "The Years
Between" is not a great motion pic
ture. It has a touch of real charm
that is exceedingly rare these days.
But in .spite of our sympathy, "The
Years Between" remains a slightly
better—and only slightly—than av
erage pic. Sympathy and condolence
to Mr. Rank, the Guild Theater, and
to the cast. It was a nice try, any
way.
