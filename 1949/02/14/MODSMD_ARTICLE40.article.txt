# Peerce Proves Himself Master of Vocal Artistry
## 
### GEORGE HOULE 
Stanford music lovers were treat
ed to a display oi artistic virtu
osity and insight Friday night that j
was one of the great musical events
of tlie year. The concert showed j
Jan Peerce to be one of the select
few who can be called great artists, i
Peerce, accompanied by Warner ,
Bass at the piano, showed a mastery i
over every style from Purcell's re
finement to Rachmaninoff's senti- \
mentality.
Peerce is master of the technical
aspects of his art. Thus one is never
conscious of the business of sing- j
ing, but only of the artistic use to
which he puts his voice. His rich
full voice is unique, yet he has such
control that the audience must ;
strain to capture the whisper of the i
ending of such a piece as Duparc's i
"Soupii
The program's first high point
came with the Handel aria, "Sound
an Alarm," from the oratorio "Ju- ;
das Maccabeus." PeeVce's voice
seems made for the sturdy Handel 1
style, which demands strength and
great sustaining power.
This vigor was also evident in
the Cilea aria, the '"Lamento di Fe
derico" from "L'Arlesiana." Peerce
sings the volatile Italian music in a !
dashing spirit that makes the senti- i
ment become real romanticism.
The evening's climax, came with [
the Schubert songs and the two '
French songs. The simple structure !
and dramatic climax of the somber
"Der Doppelganger" was a master- |
piece of timing.
In the French group, Foudrain's j
"Carnaval" was much akin to the j
"Ungeduld's" spirit with an addi- !
tion of dry Gallic wit foreign to i
Schubert. His masterful phrasing
brought out the kaleidoscopic na- 1

tine of the song.
In Dupurc's "Soupir," Peerce pro
jected the typically restrained emo
tion of the French idiom. Other
numbers on the program were good
vehicles for the excellent singing
Peerce gave them. He ended by
completely winning his audience
with six encores, which included
Leoncavallo's "Vesti la Giubba"
lrom "I Pagliacci."

finement to Rachmaninoff's senti- \
mentality.
Peerce is master of the technical
aspects of his art. Thus one is never
conscious of the business of sing- j
ing, but only of the artistic use to
which he puts his voice. His rich
full voice is unique, yet he has such
control that the audience must ;
strain to capture the whisper of the i
ending of such a piece as Duparc's i
"Soupii
The program's first high point
came with the Handel aria, "Sound
an Alarm," from the oratorio "Ju- ;
das Maccabeus." PeeVce's voice
seems made for the sturdy Handel 1
style, which demands strength and
great sustaining power.
This vigor was also evident in
the Cilea aria, the '"Lamento di Fe
derico" from "L'Arlesiana." Peerce
sings the volatile Italian music in a !
dashing spirit that makes the senti- i
ment become real romanticism.
The evening's climax, came with [
the Schubert songs and the two '
French songs. The simple structure !
and dramatic climax of the somber
"Der Doppelganger" was a master- |
piece of timing.
In the French group, Foudrain's j
"Carnaval" was much akin to the j
"Ungeduld's" spirit with an addi- !
tion of dry Gallic wit foreign to i
Schubert. His masterful phrasing
brought out the kaleidoscopic na- 1

tine of the song.
In Dupurc's "Soupir," Peerce pro
jected the typically restrained emo
tion of the French idiom. Other
numbers on the program were good
vehicles for the excellent singing
Peerce gave them. He ended by
completely winning his audience
with six encores, which included
Leoncavallo's "Vesti la Giubba"
lrom "I Pagliacci."
