## 
### GIL JONAS 
A gent named Jack—Jack O'Sul- i
hvan—and a couple of mates who |
ran also run led the Stanford Braves i
to a twin victory this weekend over j
Monterey and Hartnell JC in the
Pavilion.
With the varsity dropping two in
• he Southland, the Stanford high ]
command of the casaba should take j
notice of Mr. O'Suliivan. who tal- :
lied 19 points in the 70 to 3f> Mon- j
lerey rout and, playing the full 40 j
minutes, notched 21 in the 57 to 48 I
victory over Hartnell. Moreover, |
his passing was razor - sharp, his ;
general floor work outstanding. !
Sully's" dual exhibition made fans ;
'.'onder where he had been keeping
himself ail season, and why he had- !
o t taken the "Lark" south with the ;
Big" Indians.
Monterey Routed
The Monterey contest Friday af- 1
fernoon was a pure run-away. The j
Braves employed a devastating j
'ast break that tore the visitors' de
fense tQ shreds. Every Farm per
former gave a commendable exhi- J
bition of what had been expected of
him all season long. Together with
O'Sullivan's 19 points, Fran Watson
notched 13, and Gene Martin 10. ;
Prince of Monterey earned the •

Rime's high scoring honors with 22.
Hartnell provided some stiller op
position on Saturday, and it took
a final Brave scoring burst to insure
the victory. The Braves, mainly by
a potent O'Sullivan to Dave Atehe
son pass play and the former's shots
from al! points on the floor, pulled
steadily away. In the first half, the
Braves' quick break outclassed the
Hartnell team's mere deliberate
style of play, and the Braves led al
intermission. 29-20.
Fight Of! Spurt
The final frame saw the precision
of the quick break go awry and the
losers creep up to a 45-44 deficit
with six minutes remaining. Paul
Watson, O'Sullivan, and Pete Lay
man collaborated tor four quick
baskets to ice the game at that
point.
Bij* bespectacled Dave Ateheson,
improving with each contest, tallied
a wholesome 11 points and passed
oft well iir the post. The steady
floor work of Paul Watson, burly
Bill Warren, and Pete Layman con
tributed greatly lo the victory. Joe
Cordial, with 13 points, was Hart
nell's high man.
