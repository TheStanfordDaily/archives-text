# Spartans Clip Card Matmen
## 
### 
The luckless Stanford wrestlers
dropped a dual meet to the San Jose
State mat team Friday night by a
19 to 13 count in their second clash
of the season.
San Jose's margin of victory came
on a break in the 128-pound bout.
Stanford's Dick Cruce had a defi
nite edge on Ben Ichikawa at the
end of the (irst period, leading by a
4 to 1 count. Then in the second
period Cruce fell into a key lock
and was pinned. Cruce was the
superior wrestler for all but a few
seconds, and a Stanford victory here
would have given the Cards the
meet.
Vein Jones, Indian captain,
proved that opposing coaches Know
what they are talking about when
they instruct their wrestlers to
wrestle strictly defensively when
they meet him. In the 136-pound
match Jack Jackson elected to mix
it up with Jones and Jones threw
him in the second period.
RothwcH Wins
San Jose took the lead in the
match when Bill Rothwel! won a
decision over Dick Esbenshade in
the 121 by a 2 to 1 score. The deci
sion plus Ichikawa's fall over Cruce
in the 128 gave the Spartans an 8
to 0 lead on the Indians.
Jones gained a fall to make the
score 8 to 5 in favor of San Jose.
Then Dan Winston put the Indians
ahead by a 10 to 8 count when he
won by default from Bill Wardrup
in the 145 when Wardrup was in
jured.
Frank Waxham put the Spartans
back ahead when he won a 5 to 0
decision over Jim Kurfess in the
155. The victory moved the San
Jose squad out front by an 11 to 10
score.
Felice Comes Through
Pat Felice, San Jose captain,
proved to have too much mat savvy
for Bruce Gait in the 165-pound
match. Felice grabbed five points
for the Spartans by malting Gait in
the final period.
The deciding match of the con
test was the 175-pound c!ash which
Dick Campbell of San Jose took
from Dick DeWitt via the decision
route. Campbell edged DeWitt by
a 2 to 1 count to give the Spartans
a 19 to 10 lead and assure the San
Jose victory.
"Smiling" Steve Garst provided
the Cards' final points when he de
cisioned Spartan heavyweight Phil
Bray. Garst grinned at Bray the
whole three periods but proved that
he wasn't fooling by gaining a 5
to three advantage to take the deci
sion, giving the Cards their 13-point
total.
