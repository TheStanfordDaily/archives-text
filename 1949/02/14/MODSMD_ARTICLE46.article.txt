# Frosh Cagers Trounce Hapless Sequoia Five
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
The devastating Stanford frosh
cagers, three deep in every posi
tion, continued their merry slaugh
ter oi outclassed Peninsula high
school teams, flattening Sequoia, 48-
31, Saturday morning at the Pavil
ion.
Sequoia, which the night before
had clinched the championship of
the Peninsula Athletic League
against Lincoln Hiuh of Santa
Clara, proved to be little more than
a pratcice session for the boys in
red. The first-and second strings
each played 10 minutes in the ini
tial half, and the first three strings
all played an equal part of the post
intermission exercise.
Walsh Leads Cards
Jim Walsh, as usual, could not be
stopped and, even though he played
less than hall the contest, the for
mer Lowell Hi<ih star led the Pa
pooses with 11 points. Walsh scored
most of these, seven to be exact, in
the first half when he and • Ron
Garver led a fast, sharp-shooting
attack which left Sequoia buried
under a 22-9 deficit at the inter
mission.
Ronnie Garver, who has his hot
and cold afternoons, apparently en
joyed the innovation of a.m. bas
ketball for he played a better than
average floor game and scored nine
points.
Sequoia Demoralized
Sequoia never looked like the
ballclub that has won seven straight
games in the PAL without a defeat.
They were disorganized and de
moralized—mainly because of Stan
| ford's annoying tactic of continually
i stealing the ball to break up their
slow "fast break."
The frosh's own fast break was
working with mechanical perfec
tion. especially in the third quarter.
At the end of this stanza, Sequoia's
representatives looked the least
dignified, the score being 31 to 14
against them.
At this point. Coach Bengtson
saved red Sequoia faces from grow
ing any redder by sending in his
second and then his third strings
which were more in the opposition's
class.
Holmquist High Scorer
Frank Holmquist, playing forward
; for the Redwood City team, was the
game's high point man with 15
points. Teammate Bob Peterson was
close behind with 13 counters. Be
tween them Holmquist and Peter
son scored all but one of their
team's 22 second-half poinis.
Center Jim Ramstead played his
first game since dislocating his
thumb two weeks ago against Low
[ ell High. Jim looked a little rusty
1 but will no doubt quickly round
into form as he did alter his plag
uing back injury.

Jim Walsh, as usual, could not be
stopped and, even though he played
less than hall the contest, the for
mer Lowell Hi<ih star led the Pa
pooses with 11 points. Walsh scored
most of these, seven to be exact, in
the first half when he and • Ron
Garver led a fast, sharp-shooting
attack which left Sequoia buried
under a 22-9 deficit at the inter
mission.
Ronnie Garver, who has his hot
and cold afternoons, apparently en
joyed the innovation of a.m. bas
ketball for he played a better than
average floor game and scored nine
points.
Sequoia Demoralized
Sequoia never looked like the
ballclub that has won seven straight
games in the PAL without a defeat.
They were disorganized and de
moralized—mainly because of Stan
| ford's annoying tactic of continually
i stealing the ball to break up their
slow "fast break."
The frosh's own fast break was
working with mechanical perfec
tion. especially in the third quarter.
At the end of this stanza, Sequoia's
representatives looked the least
dignified, the score being 31 to 14
against them.
At this point. Coach Bengtson
saved red Sequoia faces from grow
ing any redder by sending in his
second and then his third strings
which were more in the opposition's
class.
Holmquist High Scorer
Frank Holmquist, playing forward
; for the Redwood City team, was the
game's high point man with 15
points. Teammate Bob Peterson was
close behind with 13 counters. Be
tween them Holmquist and Peter
son scored all but one of their
team's 22 second-half poinis.
Center Jim Ramstead played his
first game since dislocating his
thumb two weeks ago against Low
[ ell High. Jim looked a little rusty
1 but will no doubt quickly round
into form as he did alter his plag
uing back injury.
The devastating Stanford frosh
cagers, three deep in every posi
tion, continued their merry slaugh
ter oi outclassed Peninsula high
school teams, flattening Sequoia, 48-
31, Saturday morning at the Pavil
ion.
Sequoia, which the night before
had clinched the championship of
the Peninsula Athletic League
against Lincoln Hiuh of Santa
Clara, proved to be little more than
a pratcice session for the boys in
red. The first-and second strings
each played 10 minutes in the ini
tial half, and the first three strings
all played an equal part of the post
intermission exercise.
