## DAILY Sports 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's hard - punching mitt
men added the San Francisco State
boxers to their ever-growing list of
ling victims by pounding their way
to a convincing to 3victory
at the Pavilion Friday night over
the game but definitely outclassed
Staters.
The invaders from the north were
accorded the nod in the 145-pound
feature and gained a draw in the
JO5-pound slugfest, their other two
points coming via the forfeit route.
Light-heavyweight Jim Hammond
ran his victory string to four
straight in the headline attraction
of the evening as he pounded SF'er
Bruce Brunaman into submission
with one minute gone in the third
round of their hectic battle. Jim
the Jolter floored Brunaman twice
in the second heat and had the less
experienced city lad hanging on the
ropes throughout most of the bout.
Anderson Dropped
Alan Anderson was the only In
dian loser of the evenng when he
ran up against slugger Ted Abbot in
the 145-pound event. Abbott, de
scribed by Lunny as the hardest
puncher for his weight that the
Card have encountered all year,
canvased Anderson in the second
with a straight right to the chin
that had knockout written all over
it; but A 1 weathered the storm with
a disp'ay of gameness that forced
the fight to a decision.
Stater Gene Hughes picked up the
final half - point for the Staters
when he was awarded a draw in his
battle against Card 1(55 - pounder
Fred Ten Eyck. This decision was
greeted by a lusty round of booing,
as ringside observers voiced their
opinion that Hughes had been
soundly thrashed by the more ag
gressive and classier Ten Eyck.
Slim Bobby Baker used lus reach
to good advantage in the 130-pound
opener as he outpointed little Yit
Tom by a decisive margin. The
stocky Tom found Baker's long left
in his face every time he tried to
rush, and at no point was he able
to worry the taller Indian puncher.
Rael Wins
Jose Rael and Stater Nelson Yee
tangled in a fast - moving lightâ€”
wjight tussle that had the fans on
their feet during most of the bout
as the lads threw their punches fast
and furious throughout all three
rounds. Rael gained the decision in
this one, but it was closer than the
proverbial gnat's hair.
Jay Savage was the final Card
winner as he easily outpointed
wild-swinging Jerry Friedman of
San Francisco. Friedman's punches
were of the long-distance, great
circle route variety, and the smooth
Savage had no trouble keeping away
from the looping haymakers.
Jack Downey refereed the slx
bout card; Vern Bybee and Jack
Rice were the judges; Harry Polley
served as timekeeper; and Ferris
Booth announced the bouts.


SHOWN ABOVE IS the Stanford boxing team that pounded out a s'j
to o'j victory over the San Francisco State College punchers Friday
night. Coach Lunny's leather-swinging crew has shown steady improve
ment throughout the season.
