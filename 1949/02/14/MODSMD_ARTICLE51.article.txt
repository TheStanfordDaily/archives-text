# RAIN STOPS BASEBALL OPENER
## 
### 
For the second week in a row,
wet grounds for the cancellation
of Stanford's scheduled baseball
opener. Midweek rains and the
heavy freeze on Friday night left
the Sunken Diamond in unplay
able condition for Saturday's
scheduled game between the In
dians and the San Francisco Po
lice Deportment.
The Cards will get ar other
chance Saturday with a nine
tilt with the S.F. Fire Depart
ment slated.
