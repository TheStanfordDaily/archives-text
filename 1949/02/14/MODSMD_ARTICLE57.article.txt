# Rains Filling Lake Lagunita
## 
### 
A dilapidated old rowboat manned
by three enthusiasts signaled the
early beginnings of Lake Lagunita's
spring season yesterday afternoon
as picnickers and their youngsters
romped on tlie lake's shores.
Sporting a grand total of 28 mil
lion gallons to date, the Farm's
spring activity center has risen some
15 million gallons this past week,
largely due to Searsville Lake's first
seasonal overflow last Thursday.
With 90 million gallons yet to go,
prospects of filling the lake by the
first few weeks of March depend
mainly on additional rainfall be
tween now and March 15.
Carl Maier, assistant engineer,
said yesterday that the rainfall fig
ures to date are three to four inches
below normal and one inch above
last year's total at this time.
He said that if the lake is to be
full during the spring, it must gain
most of its water between now and
the end of the month, and possibly
some during the first few weeks of
March.
Because of Searsville's condition,
most of the water flowing into it
from now on will overflow the dam
and drain into Lagunita via San
Franeisquito Creek and the Lagu
nita flume.
