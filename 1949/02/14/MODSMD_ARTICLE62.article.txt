How Du Pont scientists
found o way to
Moistureproof Cellophane
There's no secret to Du Font's suc
cessful system for making chemical
discoveries. It is simply research
through teamwork.
As each new problem in research
arises, it is tackled by men and
women whose training and skill qual
ify them to master it. Backed by
ample funds and facilities, they are
continuously extending the field of
scientific knowledge.
Take the case of moistureproof
Cellophane. Plain, transparent Cello
phane was strong, clear and protec
tive. As a packaging material it had
eye appeal. Its uses were limited,
however. Perishable
in this cellulose film were protected
from contamination and were good
to look at, but they did not retain
their freshness. They either lost or
absorbed moisture, depending on the
nature of the food and atmospheric
conditions.
That was a challenge to Du Pont
research people. They set out to find
materials that would moistureproof
Cellophane without materially af
fecting its thinness or transparency.
After developing a basic test to mens-

lire moistureproofness, they tried
various procedures—adding ingredi
ents to Cellophane dope before east
ing, impregnating sheets in baths
and coaling the (ilm.
Coating showed the most promise.
Had you been a member of the re
search team on this job, you might
have helped mix and test several
hundred different coating formulae
over a 10 months' period. With suc
cessful coatings in sight, a small
pilot operation was set up. Then—
to make sure the new Cellophane
was right—doughnuts, cookies and
cakes were wrapped in it and sent
to market. Finally, engineers were
called 011 to design machinery for
full-scale operation.
Now everything from chewing gum
to porterhouse steaks is being sold in
moistureproof Cellophane. Another
scientific achievement is helping
change the food packaging and food
buying habits of America!
Using your training at Du Pont
Diverse problems call for diversified
talents. At any one time, there are
hundreds of interesting projects un
der way in the Du Pont laboratories.
You may be trained in chemistry,
engineering or physics. You may
have studied in the fields of botany,
entomology, parisitology, pharma-

cology or plant pathology. In fact,
almost all the sciences are put to use
at Du Pont.
Working as a member of a small
team, the individual is aiforded every
opportunity to show his talent and
capabilities.
