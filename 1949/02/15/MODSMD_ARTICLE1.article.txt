# Midwest Cold Spell Dwindles As Spring Floods Threaten
## 
### Associated Press 
The bountiful great mid-con
tinent area, benumbed by re
peated blizzards and arctic cold,
yesterday was promised some
relief.
The trail of weekend, wind-borne
snow dissipated, leaving behind
load-blocking snowdrifts. Moder
ating temperatures which followed
a biting cold early yesterday gave
relief agencies some respite and a
chance to re-start digging opera
tions.
Forecasters in Chicago predicted
above - zero temperatures through
out the snow - distressed Great
Plains, Great Basin, and Mountain
States regions.
Elsewhere the forecast was for
rain and freezing temperatures in
the Great Lakes and Ohio River
Valley; clear and unseasonably cold
in the Far West; mild and pleasant
in the South; some precipitation
with cold in the Southwest; snow
and rain in the East; light, scattered
snow in New England,
But the halt, perhaps temporary,
of the snow pointed up a new dan

ger in the Missouri Basin states.
New snow atop pi led-up drifts in
the Upper Basin states increased
flood dangers. Only a very gradual
change from winter to spring and
an orderly thaw can avert serious
flooding, a report stated.
Sleet and snow from one to three
inches blanketed nearly all Kansas.
Some Oklahoma roads were closed
by sleet, rain, and ice.
The weekend blizzard in the
storm-distressed mid-continent was
the worst in two weeks. It halted
temporarily some relief work in
South Dakota, Wyoming, and Ne
braska and spread into six counties
of North Dakota.
On the outer fringe of the wind
and snow, May bell, Colo., played
host to 500 snowbound travelers.
Scores of buses, trucks, and cars
were locked in by the snow.
In Utah and Idaho transportation
over major highways returned to
near normal. Major highways in
Idaho were being cleared to accom
modate two lanes of traffic. Many
secondary roads in the two states,
however, remained closed.
Haylift operations in Utah con
tinued to isolated areas.
An Agriculture Department sur
vey showed blizzards in four West
ern states killed 81,000 cattle and
calves and 97,000 sheep and lambs.


SHORTLY AFTER TIIIS ENGINE made its way through snowdrifts on
a Northern Pacific spur line leading to a coal mine near Ilazen. N.D.,
another blizzard closed the line again. Snowplows are now attempting
to clear the tracks once more.

Forecasters in Chicago predicted
above - zero temperatures through
out the snow - distressed Great
Plains, Great Basin, and Mountain
States regions.
Elsewhere the forecast was for
rain and freezing temperatures in
the Great Lakes and Ohio River
Valley; clear and unseasonably cold
in the Far West; mild and pleasant
in the South; some precipitation
with cold in the Southwest; snow
and rain in the East; light, scattered
snow in New England,
But the halt, perhaps temporary,
of the snow pointed up a new dan

ger in the Missouri Basin states.
New snow atop pi led-up drifts in
the Upper Basin states increased
flood dangers. Only a very gradual
change from winter to spring and
an orderly thaw can avert serious
flooding, a report stated.
Sleet and snow from one to three
inches blanketed nearly all Kansas.
Some Oklahoma roads were closed
by sleet, rain, and ice.
The weekend blizzard in the
storm-distressed mid-continent was

temporarily some relief work in
South Dakota, Wyoming, and Ne
braska and spread into six counties
of North Dakota.
On the outer fringe of the wind
and snow, May bell, Colo., played
host to 500 snowbound travelers.
Scores of buses, trucks, and cars
were locked in by the snow.
In Utah and Idaho transportation
over major highways returned to

Haylift operations in Utah con
tinued to isolated areas.
An Agriculture Department sur
vey showed blizzards in four West
ern states killed 81,000 cattle and
calves and 97,000 sheep and lambs.


SHORTLY AFTER TIIIS ENGINE made its way through snowdrifts on
a Northern Pacific spur line leading to a coal mine near Ilazen. N.D.,
another blizzard closed the line again. Snowplows are now attempting
to clear the tracks once more.
The bountiful great mid-con
tinent area, benumbed by re
peated blizzards and arctic cold,
yesterday was promised some
relief.
The trail of weekend, wind-borne
snow dissipated, leaving behind
load-blocking snowdrifts. Moder
ating temperatures which followed
a biting cold early yesterday gave
relief agencies some respite and a
chance to re-start digging opera
tions.
