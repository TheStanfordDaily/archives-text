WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 </P). —
The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion today blocked a proposed in
crease in hauling charges for news
poper supplements on the West
Coast.
The action was taken following a
protest by the American Newspa
per Publishers' Association. In sus
pending the projected change in
rates, the ICC ordered a hearing
Match 28 in Nt-w York City, where
the NAPA has headquarters. Ex
aminer E. L. Glenn will preside.
The increase was proposed by the
Southern Pacific Railroad on news
paper supplements shipped in bulk
in baggage cars from San Fran
cisco to Seattle. Present rates pro
vide for a minimum weight of 37.500
pounds, handled at 61 cents per 100
pounds.
Southern Pacific proposed to
change this to provide for two
classes of shipments—those weigh
ing 20,000 to 40,000 pounds to be
handled at $1.04 cents per 100
pounds, and shipments of 40,000
pounds or more to be handled at
90 cents per 100 pounds.
The railroad recently gave public
notice that it desired to make the
change effective tomorrow. Feb. 15.
The ICC action suspends the change
until Sept. 14, or pending further
action by the commission.
