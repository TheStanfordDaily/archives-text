## 
### MARY KRAFT TOWNSEND BROWN 
Secretary of the Army Kenneth
Royal 1 denied that American troops
will be withdrawn from Japan in
the near future. Roy all has just re
turned tram a three weeks' tour of
installations in Japan, Korea, Alas
ka. and Guam. He spoke yesterday
at the Palace Hotel meeting of the
Democratic Luncheon Club of San
Francisco.
The two purposes of his trip were
"to get a better perspective of our
over-all Pacific defence problem"
and "to investigate living conditions
of men overseas."
Royall stated that "we are ready
to take on all comers in the event
">f war" and that "the army is the
finest in our history."
Re-enlistment is occurring at the
rate of 18,000 men a month, he said,
adding that this is indicative of the
high morale of the army.
In a press conference before the
luncheon, Royall declined to com
ment on the Chinese situation, but
expressed his confidence in Gen.
Mac Arthur's handling of the Far
Eastern command.
Royall pointed out. as an example
of unification of the armed forces,
that in Alaska the three service
branches work as one.
He reported that housing of
troops in Korea and Alaska left
much to be desired and that he is
going back to Washington to rec
ommend improvements.
The Secretary emphasized the
importance of President Truman's
program of building up the econo
mies of backward nations. He
pointed out that the purpose of a
government is to raise the standard
of living of its citizens. Only by
adopting an unselfish policy toward
other nations can the United States
hope to maintain world peace, he
added.
