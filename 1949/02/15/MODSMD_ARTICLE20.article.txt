# Progressive Says US. Aid To China Was Serious Error
## 
### DICK STANNARD 
America made a serious po
litical and diplomatic error in
deciding to support the Kuo
mintang government of Chiang
Kai-shek, William Kerner told an
audience of Student Progres
sives Saturday afternoon.
Speaking on the topic, "New
Forces in China," the West Coast
representative of the Committee for
a Democratic Far Eastern Policy
.said that by this support, the United
States has lost the good will ot the
Chinese people ancl has seriously
impaired the position of American
businessmen.
On the latter point, Kerner point
ed out that while our State Depart
ment was urging American traders
to get out of Communist-held North
China, the British announced that
their subjects would stay and make
trade agreements with the Commu
nists wherever possible. It is this,
he declared, that accounts for the
opposition of businessmen to fur
ther support of Chiang.
"In deciding to support Chiang
against the Chinese Communists,
American leaders did not realize,
because they could not conceive of,
the incredible corruption of the
Kuomintang regime," Kerner said.
Four Top Families
"The Nationalist government is
dominated by four ruling families,
the Chiangs. Soongs, Kungs, and
Chens, who use their official posi
tions to further their financial af
fairs." One striking instance of this,
Kerner said, was T. V. Soong's im
porting huge numbers of American
'rucks in his capacity as an im
porter. than declaring an embargo
on further imports in his capacity
as Premier. When the price of the
trucks skyrocketed, Soong sold
them at high profits and then lifted
the embargo.

The Chinese Communist armies
are almost entirely armed with
American equipment, Kerner con
tinued, most of it sold to them by
the Nationalists. Six hundred mil
lion dollars' worth of ammunition
for the Nationalists was so'.d by
them to the Communists before it
was off the ship.
Peace Possible
Concerning our future relations
with the Communists, Kerner de
clared that there is no reason why
we and they should not have peace
to our mutual advantage. Mao-tze-
Tung, China's top Communist, ha<
said that China will need aid from
all friendly countries, and has in
dicated willingness to work with
American capital.
The fear of many Americans that
a Communist victory will be dan
gerous to American security in the
Far East is groundless, Kerner went
on. "'The only effect Red victory
will have on our relations with
China is to remove her from the
area of United States imperialism.
China will no longer tolerate un
fair trade policies, but will be gUui
to deal on an equal basis."
In his closing remarks, Kerner
emphasized the need for a change
in our attitude toward China. This
includes a prompt recognition of the
Communist regime as a finished
fact. If we don't, our Chinese trade,
so vital to the port of San Francisco,
wH disappear. Anil we must stop
thinking of China as an area where
we can do whatever we wish.

on further imports in his capacity
as Premier. When the price of the
trucks skyrocketed, Soong sold
them at high profits and then lifted
the embargo.

The Chinese Communist armies
are almost entirely armed with
American equipment, Kerner con
tinued, most of it sold to them by
the Nationalists. Six hundred mil
lion dollars' worth of ammunition
for the Nationalists was so'.d by
them to the Communists before it
was off the ship.
Peace Possible
Concerning our future relations
with the Communists, Kerner de
clared that there is no reason why
we and they should not have peace
to our mutual advantage. Mao-tze-
Tung, China's top Communist, ha<
said that China will need aid from
all friendly countries, and has in
dicated willingness to work with
American capital.
The fear of many Americans that
a Communist victory will be dan
gerous to American security in the
Far East is groundless, Kerner went
on. "'The only effect Red victory
will have on our relations with
China is to remove her from the
area of United States imperialism.
China will no longer tolerate un
fair trade policies, but will be gUui
to deal on an equal basis."
In his closing remarks, Kerner
emphasized the need for a change
in our attitude toward China. This
includes a prompt recognition of the
Communist regime as a finished
fact. If we don't, our Chinese trade,
so vital to the port of San Francisco,
wH disappear. Anil we must stop
thinking of China as an area where
we can do whatever we wish.
America made a serious po
litical and diplomatic error in
deciding to support the Kuo
mintang government of Chiang
Kai-shek, William Kerner told an
audience of Student Progres
sives Saturday afternoon.
Speaking on the topic, "New
Forces in China," the West Coast
representative of the Committee for
a Democratic Far Eastern Policy
.said that by this support, the United
States has lost the good will ot the
Chinese people ancl has seriously
impaired the position of American
businessmen.
On the latter point, Kerner point
ed out that while our State Depart
ment was urging American traders
to get out of Communist-held North
China, the British announced that
their subjects would stay and make
trade agreements with the Commu
nists wherever possible. It is this,
he declared, that accounts for the
opposition of businessmen to fur
ther support of Chiang.
"In deciding to support Chiang
against the Chinese Communists,
American leaders did not realize,
because they could not conceive of,
the incredible corruption of the
Kuomintang regime," Kerner said.
Four Top Families
"The Nationalist government is
dominated by four ruling families,
the Chiangs. Soongs, Kungs, and
Chens, who use their official posi
tions to further their financial af
fairs." One striking instance of this,
Kerner said, was T. V. Soong's im
porting huge numbers of American
'rucks in his capacity as an im
porter. than declaring an embargo
on further imports in his capacity
as Premier. When the price of the
trucks skyrocketed, Soong sold
them at high profits and then lifted
the embargo.
