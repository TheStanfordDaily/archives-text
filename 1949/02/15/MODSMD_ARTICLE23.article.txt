LOS ANGELES. Feb. 14 (JP) —
Actor Robert Mitchum, who's still
drawing his $3,250 a week while he's
in jail, pocketed an extra couple of
bucks today. So did Actress Lila
Leeds.
They accepted service of subpoe
nas calling them as witnesses at the
Mar. 8 trial of Dancer Vicki Evans
on charges of marijuana possession.
With the acceptance went the cus
tomary $2 fee. The money will go
into their jail canteen funds—from
which cigarettes, candy, magazines,
and the like are purchased.
Mitchum. Miss Leeds, Miss Evans,
and Real Estate Man Robin Ford
were arrested at an alleged "reefer"
smoking party and all but Miss
Evans were convicted of conspiracy
to possess marijuana. She did not
appear, and was brought here by
bench warrant from New York for
later trial.
Mitchum and Miss Leeds began
<iO-day sentences last Wednesday.
Fords' sentence was deferred pend
ing trial Mar. 9 on a second posses
sion o! marijuana count, growing out
of his arrest while he was at liberty
after the earlier raid.
Chief Jailer Charles Fitzgerald
also disclosed that Mitchum is to be
removed to the prison honor farm
next Wednesday, if he can pass a
physical test. There, instead of
swabbing jail floors, he'll work at
outdoor agricultural pursuits.
