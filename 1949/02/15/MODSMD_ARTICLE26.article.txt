# Oaks Women Sniff, Then Sigh, As All That Food Passes By
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
If you'll go through the downstairs hall of the Oaks, past the
telephone nook, and out onto the back porch, you'll find a window
out into the inner wall of the house. And if you have any imagi
nation at all, you 11 pry open the window, as the newcomers to
the Oaks do every year, and rediscover an inner sanctum
kitchen—completely and modernly i

equipped—which is hidden lor all
but six weeks out of the year.
But regularly, once a year, an ad
vance squad armed with pails and
mops is sent forth into the confines
of the kitchen, and amid the cease
less Japanese equivalent of ya-ta
ta. tho gas is turned on. The kitchen
is now open for business.
Residents of the Oaks inevitably
express pangs of remorse at having
a beautiful kitchen in their midst
when they still must traipse over
to Union for meals. But what is
considerably more frustrating both
to residents and afternoon callers is
the aroma of a home-cooked meal
which penetrates through the house
every day about 4 o'clock.
This, the residence chalks up as
its sacrifice to education, while on
the .sly it tries to dream up some
kind of profitable arrangement with
the women students of the Home
Management course.
Steak Menus
Peeling potatoes and pounding
steak in the cooking lab once a
week holds a very real interest for
most students in the course. Being
engaged isn't a prerequisite (the
class is limited to 30). but most of
the girls are.
The cooking lab is a by-product
oi a complete home management
survey given the students by Miss
Christine Kicker, director of dining
halls and education lecturer.
Before she ever sets foot in the
kitchen each girl has a mental vita
min chart and several projects in
planning meals on a limited budget
behind her. The lab is principally a
process of getting to know the
kitchen, organizing a meal so that it
al! comes out of the oven at once,
and practice in various cooking
methods.
The girls are instructed in the

handling of modern culinary de
vices like pressure cookers and
ready-made cake mixtures as well
as the traditional cooking lessons.
Home Kitchen Mods
The kitchen is a regular, com
plete home kitchen with special
pantry, back porch, and kitchenette
besides the kitchen proper. A com
plete set of dishes and silverware is
provided in addition to all utensils,
two gas stoves, and an icebox. Each
girl has her own working table.
Besides getting a thrill out of
seeing their own popovers turn out
(most ol the girls have had no ex
perience), they're saving their fu
ture spouses possible gastronomic
pains later.
Labs are under the direction of
Elizabeth Kice, director of Lagunita
dining hall; Mary Scoltock of the
Roble diing hall: Mrs. Dorothy Bell
and Florence Smith of Union din
ing halls.
The three - unit Home Manage
ment course consists mainly of dec
tures on what to look for when
buying linen, china, and silver
ware; budgeting time and money;
and actual problems in planning
meals, etc.
Two married women in the class
serve as guinea pigs when problems
about today's budgeting arise.
The course was started in 1936 in
response to need expressed by sen
ior women, and today the course is
open only to upper division stu
dents. The cooking lab used to be
housed in the basement of the Ed
ucation Building, but psychology
moved in and the lab had to find
other quarters.
