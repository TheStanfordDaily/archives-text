## Inadequate Income 
### 
One of the basic reasons for the high cost of going to Stan
ford lies in the small size of the University's endowment. Be
cause our endowment is small, the yearly interest return is
inadequate.
At the time of its founding in 1891, Stanford was one of the
richest universities in the world with its 20-million-dollar en
dowment. Harvard at the same time "struggled" with an endow
ment of about two million dollars.
Stanford was meant to be a rich university providing high
quality education tuition-free to children raised in the State of
California. Men and women in any economic level having the
mental aptitude to cope with the high standards demanded by
the University would be able to use its facilities.
But things have changed in the last 50 years. Farm enrollment
has skyrocketed at least 400 per cent. The endowment, on the
other hand, has slowly increased from 20 million to only 37 mil
lion dollars. Harvard University, meanwhile, has an endowment
fund today near 235 million dollars. Interest from a million dol
lars will return $40,000 a year. But that amount will cover only
four or five professors' annual salaries. Look back at the Stan
ford and Harvard endowments and you can see which univer
sity has the highest income on its endowment at four per cent
per year.
Fifty years ago, interest from the Stanford endowment paid
100 per cent of the maintenance and tuition costs; today interest
plus gifts covers only 60 per cent of those costs. Students must
make up the 40 per cent deficit, and that deficit is becoming
more burdensome as money becomes cheaper.
Why did Stanford's endowment not increase in proportion to
Harvard's and a dozen other universities now much wealthier
than Stanford?
Twenty million dollars was a great deal of money 50 years
ago. Today it is not. Until recent years, people saw no need to
contribute gifts to a rich school. This psychology carried
through until we suddenly realized that Stanford was no longer
a "rich" university. Harvard's endowment increased, snowballed,
and became a mountain of wealth through many gifts while our
endowment remained almost stationary for many years.
Today, Stanford representatives are striving to sell the Uni
versity to alumni and friends of the University. This is not a
high pressure campaign, but it is one designed to show the great
needs of the school in order to keep Stanford open to youth from
all economic levels.
In past years Stanford s position has been one of an eminent
university in the West and throughout the world—a leader in
education. If Stanford University is to remain a leader in the edu
cation field, the volume of gifts v/ill have to show a marked
increase.

lion dollars. Harvard University, meanwhile, has an endowment
fund today near 235 million dollars. Interest from a million dol
lars will return $40,000 a year. But that amount will cover only
four or five professors' annual salaries. Look back at the Stan
ford and Harvard endowments and you can see which univer
sity has the highest income on its endowment at four per cent
per year.
Fifty years ago, interest from the Stanford endowment paid
100 per cent of the maintenance and tuition costs; today interest
plus gifts covers only 60 per cent of those costs. Students must
make up the 40 per cent deficit, and that deficit is becoming
more burdensome as money becomes cheaper.
Why did Stanford's endowment not increase in proportion to
Harvard's and a dozen other universities now much wealthier
than Stanford?
Twenty million dollars was a great deal of money 50 years
ago. Today it is not. Until recent years, people saw no need to
contribute gifts to a rich school. This psychology carried
through until we suddenly realized that Stanford was no longer
a "rich" university. Harvard's endowment increased, snowballed,
and became a mountain of wealth through many gifts while our
endowment remained almost stationary for many years.
Today, Stanford representatives are striving to sell the Uni
versity to alumni and friends of the University. This is not a
high pressure campaign, but it is one designed to show the great
needs of the school in order to keep Stanford open to youth from
all economic levels.
In past years Stanford s position has been one of an eminent
university in the West and throughout the world—a leader in
education. If Stanford University is to remain a leader in the edu
cation field, the volume of gifts v/ill have to show a marked
increase.
One of the basic reasons for the high cost of going to Stan
ford lies in the small size of the University's endowment. Be
cause our endowment is small, the yearly interest return is
inadequate.
At the time of its founding in 1891, Stanford was one of the
richest universities in the world with its 20-million-dollar en
dowment. Harvard at the same time "struggled" with an endow
ment of about two million dollars.
Stanford was meant to be a rich university providing high
quality education tuition-free to children raised in the State of
California. Men and women in any economic level having the
mental aptitude to cope with the high standards demanded by
the University would be able to use its facilities.
But things have changed in the last 50 years. Farm enrollment
has skyrocketed at least 400 per cent. The endowment, on the
other hand, has slowly increased from 20 million to only 37 mil
lion dollars. Harvard University, meanwhile, has an endowment
fund today near 235 million dollars. Interest from a million dol
