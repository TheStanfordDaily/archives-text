To the Editor:
I believe that the little courtesies
of everyday life are important. 1
was dismayed, therefore, when I saw
such poor manners displayed by a
few college men and women re
cently.
Friday night Building :506 of the
Village had the honor and pleasure
of having a group of Mills College
women to dinner at the Pink Room.
While at first glance these coeds
seemed to be clear-cut average
American girls, actually it seemed
that appearances were deceiving.
It happens to be the custom for
those who have the good fortune to

eat at the Village dining room that
the diners, after having finished their
meal, carry their trays and dishes
to windows near the kitchen—thus
dispensing' with the need for extra
help. Under the influence, however,
of these sophisticated college women,
some of the Stanford Roughs must
have felt ashamed to ask his refined
partner to do such a menial task as
carry her tray.
But to the eternal gloiy of Stan
ford University and Mills College, I
am glad )o say that the majority of
the couples did lower themselves
sufficiently to pick up their trays.
