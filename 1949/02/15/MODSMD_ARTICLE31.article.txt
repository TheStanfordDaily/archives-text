## Cupid's Story Dates Back 463 Years 
### 
When Cupid shoots his arrow . . .
I hope he Mrs. you.
So St. Val miss-ed you instead.
Don't give up the ghost. Sadie
Hawkins Day comes about Novem
ber. If even that passes you by in
Ihe smog, there are still ships sail
ing to the South Seas, where (he
Polynesian custom requires the
women always to take the initiative
in matters of the heart.
Imagine a place where the men
have to light for a leap year in
order to get a say in the matter
. . . just women fighting over you all
the lime. What a horrible way to
die—not being able to satisfy all
of them, I mean.
But don't let me discourage you
men about sending' out your val
entines again next year. They won't
stand up in court, anyhow. Just
remember not to say yes to anything
she says or asks you. Forget the
word, but don't forget its meaning!
They have ways of phrasing things
so they sound safe and soft like
whipped cream. Beware, son, a wise
word to the bachelor is sufficient.
The birds and bees started all this
nonsense way back in 1476. The fa
ble goes that on St. Valentine's Day
they are supposed to mate. Per
sonally I didn't know they could
read, let alone figure out periods
on the calendar.
Anyhow, we sheep-like homo
sapiens followed the trend. Being
more civilized, however, we wrote
our names on slips of paper and the
opposite sexes drew lots for their
loved ones. Then they pinned these
technical marriage certificates to
their lapels, sort of like fraternity
pins, and treated their new-found
valentines to gifts—gifts of what it
doesn't say.
At the time this balderdash was
in vogue the festival lasted for sev
eral days, and on occasion stories
have come down that this haphazard
sport often actually produced love
matches. Something to do with the
power of suggestion, no doubt.
They luid a few other ideas about
foretelling their future mates in this
earlier era, too. One was a belief
that on Valentine's morn the first
man a girl glimpsed would be her
intended. Many was the wench who
locked herself in her room until
notified by a trusted member of the
family that the right young man was
either in her home or passing by.
These women don't leave much to
chance, you know.
There is, or was, an odd situation
in Russia or thereabouts. The United
Press reports from a book by for
mer Hungarian Premier Fcrenc
Nagy entitled "The Struggle Behind
the Iron Curtain"—and get this lead
sentence — "Soviet women soldiers
raped thousands of Hungarian men
in the early days of the Soviet oc
cupation.
"Russia established a camp near
Keoskemet for 30,000 ill and con
valescent women members of the
Soviet army and police forces. They
would band together and swoop
down on neighboring villages and
kidnap men, keeping them prisoner
for sometimes several days.
"Pretty soon it got so the Hun
garian women were hiding their
men in the forests and in haystacks
to keep them from the .... Soviet
women troops."
