# Arctic Jet Planes Burn Gasoline Too
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P).—For quick
startability in arctic temperature,
the Air Force is equipping all jet
planes to burn gasoline as well as
the usual kerosene.
Gasoline is generally less desir
able as jet fuel from the standpoint
of heat released per pound, but it is
much better for starting in cold
weather.
The change also will mean that
jets can be refueled at any air
base which accommodates propellor
planes. The Navy has been using
gasoline almost altogether to avoid
having to stock two kinds of fuel
aboard carriers.
The Aii- Force has around 1.000
jet planes, mostly fighters, in serv
ice.
