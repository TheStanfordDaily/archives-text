## Republicans Hear Student At Lincoln Day Banquet 
### 
In an atmosphere of smouldering anger and self-constructive criticism,
played against the minor theme of barbed labelings aimed at the opposition,
the San Mateo County Republican Committee held its annual Lincoln Day
Dinner last Thursday at the Villa Chartier in San Mateo.
The 250 party officers, members, and invited guests partook of a ceremony

which has been repeated from coast
to coast this last week in hundreds !
of towns and cities.
The principal speaker at the San
Mateo dinner was a Stanford stu
dent, Forden "Skip" Athearn, a pre- i
law student, former Governor of the
Junior Statesmen of America, for
mer national oratorical contest win
ner, and a leading light in Young
Republican circles in Northern Cali
fornia.
Athearn made a speech which in
cluded within it the hopes and prob- !
able basis of political salvation of
the Republican Party.
"The challenge of the hour is to
organize the party in the spirit of
Lincoln," he said.
Get The Votes
"What we have been doing the
past 20 years is to talk up votes
among ourselves." He added that
there was a block of seven million
votes which the GOP must win next
time to gain victory. To effectuate j
this, the Stanford student told the
Republican gathering, "we must act |
on two assumptions:
"A two-party system is essential
to our democracy and a party to live i
should win some of the time!"
Athearn charged that the Demo
crats had captured and held the pre
vious Republican constituents of
farmers, small business men, and
other elements and "what's remark
able is that this combination under
the New Deal has held up so long.
But then, remarkable things can be
done with the taxpayers' money!"
The Stanford student said, "This
college generation doesn't know any
other party in power. A person has
to be at least '11 years old to re
member successfully voting for the j
Republicans—and the mortality rate
is working against us!"
Be More Definite
In keeping with the aroused state
ments of Republican speakers the
last week, Athearn said "Time is j
past when candidates can get by on
glittering generalities."
"We should try to clean up mo
nopolies; the government must
stringently control them. We should
give labor a better break—we must
let every man know he's a capital
ist."
Athearn said many of the present I
welfare policies of the government
must be continued, taxes should, be
lowered, the youth of the country
must be won over. Relative to the
last, the speaker suggested that Re
publican local committees all over |
the country might offer college
scholarships to high school youths
winning essay contests on "Why
I'm a Republican."
While calling for a progressive.
20th century party, Athearn casti
gated the difficulties of evident dor
mancy, "while totalitarian forces
are engulfing the world. The Repub
lican party must break the chains
and win. Must there be a wake after
every election?"
"Going To Fight"
Going further than many older I
Lincoln Day speakers, Athearn '
bluntly said, "Any leadership that

is so insulated against public opin
ion should gracefully bow out to
give leadership to those more in tunc
with the times. We're not going to
go into mourning; we're going to
fight!" He called for streamlining
of the party "to reach the aspira
tions of achievement the world has
never known!"
Whereas Forden Athearn gave an
enthusiastically received address,
delivered without notes and with
verve, Dudley Swim, former na
tional vice-commander of the Amer
ican Legion and a former leader ol'
the New York State Young Re
publicans, with the aid of notes, suc
ceeded in dulling some of the dy
namism aroused within the crowd by
the Stanford student. One reason
was that Swim placed an inordinate
faith in name-tabbing and did not
delve deeply enough into the issues
confronting the GOP.
Telegrams Read
Preceding the main speakers, tele
grams were read from the rostrum;
a unique message sent by Congress
man Jack Anderson read, "Sorry I
cannot be at San Mateo with you.
I'm busy opposing the shame of the
spendthrift policies of the Fail-
Deal
Aaron Sergeant, of Palo Alto, re
ceived applause after being intro
duced by the chairman as the "suc
cessful prosecutor who was instru
mental in having the 'Building
America Series' thrown out ol the
classrooms."
After Athearn and Swim, Mrs.
Eugene Prince, Republican woman
of wit and charm and former presi
dent of the Pro-American organ
ization, said of the "uncertain voters
swallowing the Democratic line and
the vacillating Republican voters,"
that "This country is suffering from
a calamity of hot heads and cold
feet."
To remedy the situation in the fu
ture, Mrs. Prince said, "We must
throw out Emily Post and take up
the Marquis of Queensbury rules."

Get The Votes
"What we have been doing the
past 20 years is to talk up votes
among ourselves." He added that
there was a block of seven million
votes which the GOP must win next
time to gain victory. To effectuate j
this, the Stanford student told the
Republican gathering, "we must act |
on two assumptions:
"A two-party system is essential
to our democracy and a party to live i
should win some of the time!"
Athearn charged that the Demo
crats had captured and held the pre
vious Republican constituents of
farmers, small business men, and
other elements and "what's remark
able is that this combination under
the New Deal has held up so long.
But then, remarkable things can be
done with the taxpayers' money!"
The Stanford student said, "This
college generation doesn't know any
other party in power. A person has
to be at least '11 years old to re
member successfully voting for the j
Republicans—and the mortality rate
is working against us!"
Be More Definite
In keeping with the aroused state
ments of Republican speakers the
last week, Athearn said "Time is j
past when candidates can get by on
glittering generalities."
"We should try to clean up mo
nopolies; the government must
stringently control them. We should
give labor a better break—we must
let every man know he's a capital
ist."
Athearn said many of the present I
welfare policies of the government
must be continued, taxes should, be
lowered, the youth of the country
must be won over. Relative to the
last, the speaker suggested that Re
publican local committees all over |
the country might offer college
scholarships to high school youths
winning essay contests on "Why
I'm a Republican."
While calling for a progressive.
20th century party, Athearn casti
gated the difficulties of evident dor
mancy, "while totalitarian forces
are engulfing the world. The Repub
lican party must break the chains
and win. Must there be a wake after
every election?"
"Going To Fight"
Going further than many older I
Lincoln Day speakers, Athearn '
bluntly said, "Any leadership that

is so insulated against public opin
ion should gracefully bow out to
give leadership to those more in tunc
with the times. We're not going to
go into mourning; we're going to
fight!" He called for streamlining
of the party "to reach the aspira
tions of achievement the world has
never known!"
Whereas Forden Athearn gave an
enthusiastically received address,
delivered without notes and with
verve, Dudley Swim, former na
tional vice-commander of the Amer
ican Legion and a former leader ol'
the New York State Young Re
publicans, with the aid of notes, suc
ceeded in dulling some of the dy
namism aroused within the crowd by
the Stanford student. One reason
was that Swim placed an inordinate
faith in name-tabbing and did not
delve deeply enough into the issues
confronting the GOP.

To remedy the situation in the fu

Republicans—and the mortality rate
is working against us!"
Be More Definite
In keeping with the aroused state
ments of Republican speakers the
last week, Athearn said "Time is j
past when candidates can get by on
glittering generalities."
"We should try to clean up mo
nopolies; the government must
stringently control them. We should
give labor a better break—we must
let every man know he's a capital
ist."
Athearn said many of the present I
welfare policies of the government
must be continued, taxes should, be
lowered, the youth of the country
must be won over. Relative to the
last, the speaker suggested that Re
publican local committees all over |
the country might offer college
scholarships to high school youths
winning essay contests on "Why
I'm a Republican."
While calling for a progressive.
20th century party, Athearn casti
gated the difficulties of evident dor
mancy, "while totalitarian forces
are engulfing the world. The Repub
lican party must break the chains
and win. Must there be a wake after
every election?"
"Going To Fight"
Going further than many older I
Lincoln Day speakers, Athearn '
bluntly said, "Any leadership that

is so insulated against public opin
ion should gracefully bow out to
give leadership to those more in tunc
with the times. We're not going to
go into mourning; we're going to
fight!" He called for streamlining
of the party "to reach the aspira
tions of achievement the world has
never known!"
Whereas Forden Athearn gave an
enthusiastically received address,
delivered without notes and with
verve, Dudley Swim, former na
tional vice-commander of the Amer
ican Legion and a former leader ol'
the New York State Young Re
publicans, with the aid of notes, suc
ceeded in dulling some of the dy
namism aroused within the crowd by
the Stanford student. One reason
was that Swim placed an inordinate
faith in name-tabbing and did not
delve deeply enough into the issues
confronting the GOP.
Telegrams Read
Preceding the main speakers, tele
grams were read from the rostrum;
a unique message sent by Congress
man Jack Anderson read, "Sorry I
cannot be at San Mateo with you.
I'm busy opposing the shame of the
spendthrift policies of the Fail-
Deal
Aaron Sergeant, of Palo Alto, re
ceived applause after being intro
duced by the chairman as the "suc
cessful prosecutor who was instru
mental in having the 'Building
America Series' thrown out ol the
classrooms."
After Athearn and Swim, Mrs.
Eugene Prince, Republican woman
of wit and charm and former presi
dent of the Pro-American organ
ization, said of the "uncertain voters
swallowing the Democratic line and
the vacillating Republican voters,"
that "This country is suffering from
a calamity of hot heads and cold
feet."
To remedy the situation in the fu
ture, Mrs. Prince said, "We must
throw out Emily Post and take up
the Marquis of Queensbury rules."


SKIP ATHEARN, Stanford pre
law student, was the principal
speaker at the San Mateo County
Republican Committee dinner on
Feb. 12.
In an atmosphere of smouldering anger and self-constructive criticism,
played against the minor theme of barbed labelings aimed at the opposition,
the San Mateo County Republican Committee held its annual Lincoln Day
Dinner last Thursday at the Villa Chartier in San Mateo.
The 250 party officers, members, and invited guests partook of a ceremony

which has been repeated from coast
to coast this last week in hundreds !
of towns and cities.
The principal speaker at the San
Mateo dinner was a Stanford stu
dent, Forden "Skip" Athearn, a pre- i
law student, former Governor of the
Junior Statesmen of America, for
mer national oratorical contest win
ner, and a leading light in Young
Republican circles in Northern Cali
fornia.
Athearn made a speech which in
cluded within it the hopes and prob- !
able basis of political salvation of
the Republican Party.
"The challenge of the hour is to
organize the party in the spirit of
Lincoln," he said.
Get The Votes
"What we have been doing the
past 20 years is to talk up votes
among ourselves." He added that
there was a block of seven million
votes which the GOP must win next
time to gain victory. To effectuate j
this, the Stanford student told the
Republican gathering, "we must act |
on two assumptions:
"A two-party system is essential
to our democracy and a party to live i
should win some of the time!"
Athearn charged that the Demo
crats had captured and held the pre
vious Republican constituents of
farmers, small business men, and
other elements and "what's remark
able is that this combination under
the New Deal has held up so long.
But then, remarkable things can be
done with the taxpayers' money!"
The Stanford student said, "This
college generation doesn't know any
other party in power. A person has
to be at least '11 years old to re
member successfully voting for the j
Republicans—and the mortality rate
is working against us!"
