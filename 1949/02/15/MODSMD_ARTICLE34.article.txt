"Dr. Marshall, Chaplain of the
Senate, who died January 25, once
said, 'Save us from the sins of wor
rying, lest stomach ulcers be the
badge of our lack of faith'."
"In and Out of Books" by Ralph
Thompson:
"Mark Twain, while a member of
the Savage Club in London, drank
Scotch whiskey for his health, but
sighed so deeply for the medicinal
joys of bourbon that his fellow Sav
ages imported six cages from Ken
tucky Called back to New
York after only four cases were con
sumed. Mark died before getting
around to the remainder.
Much later Malcolm W. Bingay,
who relates the incident in his auto
biographical "Of Me I Sing," visited
the Savage cellar and was shown a
touching monument to American lit
erature and British sentiment two

| eases of bourbon 'around which had
been neatly folded heavy oilcloth
! with a molit 1 clasp nailed 011 the top:
Property of Samuel L. Clemens
(Mark Twain)."
From J. Soloman Fink's review in
the New York Times of K. (\ (tilde's
new hook, "Fictions of Life":
"It is often said that sentimental
; reflection is the panacea for stream
lined modern living. Yet those who
live life to its fullest extent are the
pace setters."
Concerning the struggle for suc
cess in "A Day at Home" by Buin
side Koone:
"Retrogressions caused by swiftly
advancing technological and scien
tific discoveries are apparent on
every hand. This, however, is not
a condemnation of our society or
times, but rather a human frailty
to be overcome."
