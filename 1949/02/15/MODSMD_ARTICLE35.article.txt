# Satire, Music Feature Novel Straw Hat Review

### JIM THURBER 
With the easy-going manner j
I stage veterans, Carol Brumm
nd Gordon Connell stole the
how Thursday from the rest
112 the Straw Hat Revuers at the
pening night of "Out of Or
ler."
Under the professional guidance j
112 Elizabeth Berryhill, the youthful
ompany produced one of the great
st collection of hilarious satirical
kits ever to hit the stage in San
'rancisco.
The Straw Hat Revue has been
lerforming for over two years, with
nly five weeks' rest. The cast |
vrites its own skits, does its own
■üblicity work, ushers, changes
cenery, and serves cokes to the
udience during the intermission.
The acting was superb, but the
inging left much to be desired. Un
artunately, the company is com
'letely lacking an actor with real
inging ability, and several of the |
kits fell down because of this dc
ciency.
Although most of the actors and
ctresses gave exceptional perform- j
nces, the work of Miss Brumm in |
•he skits "Report from Makapau" j
nd "A Women's World," and Con- \
.ell's acting in "The Trial of Dolly
srine," were by far the best of the j
veiling.
Several of the skits, especially at i
he beginning of the performance,
/ere definite flops, but the cast got
/armed up as the evening pro
ressed, and ended up with a
mashing take-off on "Hellzapop
'in'."
The young group has worked
arcl on its production .since the
irst, show in ;m East Bav barn, and

the performance last night was an
excellent indication of what hard
work can do. Their next stop is
Los Angeles, where they are booked
for an initial two weeks' run at the
Las Palmas Theater.
San Francisco is their stamping
ground, however, and they will be
back. I recommend this show for
anyone who enjoys good slapstick
comedy, plus excellent acting.
