## 
### 
Lake Lagunita gained 1G million
gallons last weekend, chalking up
its greatest rise of the season to
date.
By way of a reading taken yes
terday morning, Carl Maier, assist
ant engineer, reported the lake now
holds 44 million gallons, or is 37
per cent full. Capacity is 118 mil
lion gallons.
Maier said the sudden increase
was due to the fact that Searsville
Lake had its first overflow last
Thursday. Water over the Sears
ville dam is channeled to Lagunita
by way of San Francisquito Creek.
However, Maier said, rainfall is
still some three inches below nor
mal. To date, seven inches have
been recorded in this area, one inch
above last year's total at this time.
Throughout last year's rainy sea
son, the assistant engineer said, we
had only 12 inches. As a result, La
gunita had its worst year since '32,
tilling to an all-time low of 50 mil
lion gallons.
The lake's best year since '32 was
1941, when it filled to capacity on
Jan. 9 and remained full till the
middle of June. Since '41, with the
exception of '4t>, the trend has been
downward, each succeeding year
showing a lesser content.
