## The 						Front Row

Any resemblance between the helpless capers of last weekend and tl
highly-rated Stanford basketball team ol bygone days, is purely act
dental.
Since double-doused by the South, theories for the downfall of l
Deanmen have been a dime a dozen. I have spent a dime and come
with a dozen.
After traveling through rain in the desert and snow on the ridge, a
alter sitting in a broken chair at the Olympic Auditorium, and after watt
ing two ol the worst Stanford cage performances this season, I can 1
you that the weekend in old L.A. was a flop, a stinkeroo, a real hardsl
that shouldn't happen to a dog.
But now, for the record- a few of those theories:
Those closest to the varsity say that a late-season slump, scientifica
termed STALENESS, has been gradually setting in.
IS IT STALENESS ALONE?
This sialcness routine is something that happens to the best of the
especially teams that have won 17 games and lost but a handful.
If staleness were the only reason for the 10- and 11-point losses in t
Southland, then a course of correction would not be 100 difficult to folU
Everett Dean has already taken the first steps to remedy the siekm
He has called for a rest cure. One practice session of serious degree,
the morrow, will be the only real workout of the week.
Whether this rest cure will be enough to snap things back to norn
won't be known until Friday night. At the moment, I don't think tl
the rest alone will do the job. There are several other factors involved
TAKE LOAD OFF YARDLEY
It's been the old standby slogan of "49 to say "As Yardley goes, so gi
the Stanford team."
Well, the Deanmen had better junk this little saying if they ever h<>)
to get going again. Actually, there is no excuse for placing so much
a load on George.
Every sports writer in Los Angeles chimed in with the same note 1
Sunday morn, that George Yardley, the blond bomber from Balboa ;
voted most likely to succeed by the Front Row all year, was the bigg
disappointment in recent days.
And it's no wonder. Everybody in the South was laying for Geoi
Down there he had been tabbed as a second Luisetti, a one-man worn
who could make or break the Tribe attack. They concentrated tl
forces on making him look bad, and oh. how they succeeded.
It the Cards had not been accustomed to building 1 their entire oflens
around an overhead game to George, the twin disasters might never h;
occurred.
STEVE CAN STILL SCORE
With Bill Stephenson around, a sharp-eyed bloke who could run
plenty of points if given hall' a chance, Stanford doesn't need to rest
weary eyes on the Birdman.
Add to Stephenson's ability such capable scorers as Bill Rose (8 poi
in 128 seconds against USC), Marv Gelber who gets better with e.
game, Dave Davidson who is always dangerous, and Gus Chavalas v
can pot long shots with the best of them.
Sum that list up and you see that Stanford boasts a host of point push
the likes of which would make a lot of coaches drool.
And you know, it's the pointmakei's who must do their job if the tc
is to win. You can talk all you want to about the team players, the
fensive aces, and the nice guys who run fast, but it's the galoots \
make music with the net who make the team go round.
NO BUCKETS, NO WINS
The outstanding problem last weekend was that Stanford could not b
beg, steal, or just plain make a bucket.
The playing floors and foreign crowds helped produce the chill. B
the Olympic and Westwood patrons were on Yardley's back from
moment he stepped on the floor. And I mean, THEY WERE ON ]
BACK.
(George will he interviewed tomorrow night by Walt Gainage on I
8 p.m. radio broadcast over station KLEN (ll>70), and perhaps he \\
relate first hand as to what was wrong with the L.A. weather or som
thing.)
The Southerners tried to shout Stanford right off the floor, and t
didn't do a bad job. At Westwood they threw paper on the court, jee
every whistle even when obvious, and generally made things miser;
for all save their own boys.
It was the same at the Olympic, and the payoff was victory for
hometowners.
YELL OR TWO NEVER HURTS
Maybe that should offer a slight clue to the Farm patrons of the game
little noise in our Pavilion Tomb could help push the Bruins and Tro;
right back to Los Angeles.
And perchance you decide to heckle a couple of these strangers, I
refer you to a twosome who can't take it, guys who can dish it out but d
like getting it back.
Now, please don't get out of line. But just happen to mention to Tr
Stan Christie that he's a lug who should have stayed at home. An
crying Bruin tagged Carl Kraushaar might not like it if you speak
name with anything but sweetness.
Both Christie and Kraushaar have naughty tempers which will get tl
into trouble someday. A good lesson somewhere along the line wc
do 'em good.
SHARMANIZED, BUT GOOD
But getting back to the original plan, that of listing a few theo
behind the GREAT DOWNFALL, T must add a couple of individual i
sons, gents named Bill Sharman (USC) and Allan Sawyer (UCLA).
Friday night Stanford was "Sharmanized" (thanx. A! Berry) by
best forward in Western America.
Saturday night the Cards were "Saw-yered" in two by the ret
Allan of UCLA.
That's Hall, brother!
