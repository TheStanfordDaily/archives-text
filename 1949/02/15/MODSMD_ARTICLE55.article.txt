# Encina 3-E Wins Mural Hoop Tilt
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
Matt Schmutz took everything oft'
the defensive backboard, and the
whole team began to hit from the
outside in a second-half relentless
rally by the Encina 3E I club,
who crushed their upstairs brothers
from 4W, 30-21, in the first Lasket
ball game at the Encina Gym last
nigh i.
Schmutz, who was insignificant in
the scoring colum with only two
points, was the difference between
the two teams as the game un
iolded.
It was Schmutz who took the ball
off his team's backboard to start the
fast breaks which were turned into
baskets by Char'ie Legue and Hal
Skillman. It was also Sehmutz's
ball-clutching leaps which invari
ably gave 4W only one shot at a
time and frustrated potential tip-in
artists from the upper floor.
Behind at Half
Down 13 to 10 at the half, 3E 1
came roaring back with 20 points
while holding their opponents to
eight in the action after intermis
sion.
As a matter of fact, 3E started
out very fast and when they were
leading 10-2 midway in the second
quarter, the contest looked like a
rout. At this point their offense
stalled and Dick Faville came into
the game tor 4W.
Dick promptly lifted his team out
of the depths with two whirling
buckets, and when Jack Rivenburg,
Jack Roberts, and Faville again had
scored, the victors found themselves
three points in arrears. So it ended
at the hall'.
With the start of the second half,
the 3E team quickly ended their
point famine on a driving basket by
Hal Skillman.
3F Regains Lead
Charlie Legge was then fouled
twice in succession in the act ol
shooting. He made three out of the
four shots, and after Rod Hills had
swished a long one. Legge was good
for two more on a fast break. This
splurge gave the victors a 17-13
margin, a lead which they never
relinquished.
It was principally desperation
long shots by the losers which kept
the score as close as it was. Once
in a while one of these long archers
would hit. Homer Smith excelled
in that department with four points.
Charlie Legge, a flashy individual
player with a variety of spectacular
jump shots, took scoring honors for
the game with 11 points. Legge was
also a hustler on defense and was
all over the court bothering his op
ponents even after the game ceased
to be close.
Skillful Skillman
Close behind Legge in the scoring
parade was a speedy forward for
3E, Hal Skillman. Skillman's spe
cialty was a belter - skelter fast
break, made possible by Sehmutz's
effective work off the boards, and
he was good enough at it to score
10 points.
Larry Peterson also played a fine
game at guard for the winners. Be
sides scoring five points, Larry
helped Schmutz off the boards and
fed the ball in to bis higher scoring
teammates.
For the losers, Dick Faville was
high with seven points despite the
fact that he played little over half
the game. Guards Jack Rivenburp
and Homer Smith followed with
our points apiece.
