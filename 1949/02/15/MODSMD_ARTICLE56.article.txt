# 'MAN OF STEEL'
## Zale-Cerdan Match Likely 
### 
CHICAGO. Feb. 14 (/P). — Tony
Zale, boxing's slight'y rusty "man
of steel," said today that "I "feel I
can handle this fellow the next
time" — referring to middleweight
champion Marcel Cerdan and a pos
sible title rematch this summer.
Zale's determination to get an
other crack at the Fienchman who
dethroned him last Sept. 21 has
puzzled his co-managers and long
time friends, Sam Pian and Art
Winch.
But they'll string along with the
35 - year - old scrapper from Gary,
Ind., if Cerdan agrees to fight him
again. The champion plans a U.S.
title defense this summer.
Came Back for Graziano
'"We thought we had Zale in re
tirement —and still think it would
be best that way," said Pian.
"But as Tony keeps pointing out
to us—we were wrong when we
told him to quit after his second
fight with Rocky Graziano. He cer
tainly looked like he was tlnough
that time. Then he gave Graziano
the licking of his life in their third
fight to regain the title."
Zale's bid for a return match
with Cerdan was disclosed last
weekend in New York by the Tour
nament of Champions which is pre
pared to promote the bout, perhaps
in Chicago.
Zale. now helping condition Cath
olic Youth Organization boxers
here, admits he hasn't talked to
Pian and Winch recently about
meeting Cerdan again.
'Wasn't Feeding Right'
'"I know they're against it,' said
Zale, "but I'm out to regain my
title. I was off form last summer,
but I'll be in there this time.
"The night of the fight. I wasn't
feeling right." he recalled, not men
tioning that he was a battered light
ing machine that simply ran out of
gas against the dancing Frenchman,
who stopped him in the 12th round
at Jersey City.
'"The night before the bout. I was
feeling swell; I was in wonderful
menta! shape. Th;-t night I could
have beaten Cerdan. The next
night, everything I did was wronT.
That won't happen the next time.'
