### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Weekends may come, and week
; ends may go; but it'll be a long time ;
i before grief-stricken Farm hoop ]
I fans forget last week's Ei Foldo in 1
the southland.
As funnyman A 1 Berry put it, we
were Sharmanized.
But then we still have a chance
at the conference title—if our boys
can only learn to beat teams that
aren't as good as they are
All in all, it was rather a wierd
j weekend, with three out of the four j
J southern battles resulting in upsets.'
i When you get right down to it, the
real surprise in the PCC will be
! when the boys start playing accord
ing to the form sheet
A Gleam of Light
One bright note in the otherwise
oh-so-discouraging Indian fade-out j
act has been the ever-improving
, work of Marv Gelber.
Marv's defensive play and re
bound work have been top-notch all
season; but in the CCNY affair he
I proved himself quite a hand atj
i twitching the netting; and in Los j
J Angeles his all-around floor game i
was a big factor in keeping the)
j scores as close as they were
Dave Is Tops
| Speaking of CCNY. the Beavers;
j agreed to a man after the contest
j that Dave Davidson is one of the
| finest guards they've run up against
i all season
You remember CCNY—the lacls I
: with the 145 per cent shooting- av- i
j erage
Shannan Marches On
Troy's Bill Sharman took a long j
step toward the conference indi- j
I vidual scoring crown by tallying a |
I total of 32 points against the Indians ;
! and Cal's unpredictable Bears.
Davidson and Stephenson were J
I only a few paces behind Bullseye
j Bill when the weekend carnival of j
j upsets began, but they're pretty far
I off the trail now
Jim the Joltev
The weekly Associated Press bas- i
j ketball ratings will be released this [
| afternoon. "And another redskin bit 1
I the dust." ....

Ray Lunny and his crew of fistic
specialists have been producing some
mighty fine shows over at the Pa
vilion this year, but you'd never
know it by looking at the handful
of fans that turn out for the events
The cards are always fast-moving
and there's no lack of excitement
for the ringsiders. F'r instance: Jin-
Hammond, the Los Altos jolter, hit
his San Francisco State opponent
so hard Friday night that the hap
less Stater broke the bottom rope oi
the ring on his downward flight.
A 1 Anderson, Stanford's top-fligh:
145-pounder, was the victim of an
other oddity the same evening. It
seems that A 1 and opponent Ted Ab
bott bounced their noggins together
during a flurry of infighting, and
the bout had to be stopped when it
was discovered that the lads had
received twin gashes over their re
spective right eyes. ....

Ray Lunny and his crew of fistic

of fans that turn out for the events
The cards are always fast-moving
and there's no lack of excitement
for the ringsiders. F'r instance: Jin-
Hammond, the Los Altos jolter, hit
his San Francisco State opponent
so hard Friday night that the hap
less Stater broke the bottom rope oi
the ring on his downward flight.
A 1 Anderson, Stanford's top-fligh:
145-pounder, was the victim of an
other oddity the same evening. It
seems that A 1 and opponent Ted Ab
bott bounced their noggins together
during a flurry of infighting, and
the bout had to be stopped when it
was discovered that the lads had
received twin gashes over their re
spective right eyes. ....

were Sharmanized.
But then we still have a chance
