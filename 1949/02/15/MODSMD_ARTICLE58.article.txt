# New Drug Cures Sea-Car-Air Sickness

### 
BALTIMORE. Feb. 14 (/P)—Ever,
battle with seasickness? It appears
the green plague which stalks rock
ing ships and upsets passengers'
,-~t. maches is on the way out.
A drug called dramamine worked
sueh wonders in an army-sponsored
experiment with a shipful of Gls
that Johns Hopkins Hospital physi
cians reported tonight seasickness
now can be prevented and cured.
Success of dramamine — whose
jit; rtling properties were discovered
by accident — holds out excellent
hope also for sufferers from car
.sickness, air sickness, and train
.sickness.
These, like the seaborne variety
of motion sickness, are caused by
disturbance of man's delicate mech
anism of equilibrium. Results are
varying degrees of nausea, vomiting,
and dizziness.
Cured Carsickness
In fact a woman whose car sick
ness the drug unexpectedly cured led
Di. Paul Carliner and Dr. Leslie H.
Gay on the road culminating in to
night's announcement.
In their scientific account to the
Hopkins Medical Society, the two
physicians said the decisive test was
made last December aboard the
army transport S.S. General Ballon.
Dramamine given 418 seasick sol
diers on an extremely rough cross
ing from New York to Bremerhaven.
Germany, the doctors said, brought
quick and complete relief to 407. In
only 11 cases was the cure partial
or lacking.
On the other hand, of a group of
soldiers receiving the drug—which
js not yet commercially available—
as a preventive, only about two per
cent developed the malady.
No Discomfort
What is most important. Drs. Car
liner and Gay declared, "In no in
stance—even though thousands of
capsules were administered, was
there a complaint or evidence of dis
comfort which necessitated discon
tinuance of the treatment."
World War II prompted intensive
studies of the malady whose military
importance is obvious where masses
of men must be transported by air
or sea and landed in the best possi
ble physical shape.
But, said the Hopkins physicians,
no drug that can be used liberally
and repeatedly has been found.
Those which were apparently suc
cessful produced side effects as seri
ously handicapping as motion sick
ness itself."
No such sitle effects were observed
in the use of dramamine (or if you
prefer, beta - dimethylaminoethyl
benzohydryl ether 8-chlorotheophyl
lirate).
The drug was being investigated—
one among many—for possible use in
relieving allergic conditions. One
patient, suffering from hives, hap

pened to be a lifelong victim of car
sickness besides.
Dramamine cured the hives—and,
she told the doctors, she found she
got complete relief from car sick
ness when she had taken a capsule
shortly before boarding her street
car.
YVhereup Dr. Gay and Dr. Carliner
went to work.
They soon discovered that "other
victims of air sickness and car sick
ness were completely freed of dis
comfort" if they took dramamine
just before starting their trips.
This was exciting, but not con
clusive. So in the summer of '48,
the di ug was used aboard the liner
America. Results were so promis

ing that the physicians applied to
the army.
Wanted—Hough riding Ship
They wanted the kind of ship that
would behave somewhat like a buck
ing bronco. And they got their ves
sel in the Ballou, which had been
built for duty in the more placid
Pacific. Her narrow, high construc
tion promised a lively midwinter
crossing over the rough Atlantic—
plus a handsome run of seasickness.
The doctors isolated 485 of the
1.37G Gls aboard in fouv sub-level
compartments. One of the groups
received dramamine on leaving New
York Harbor and regularly there
after for 43 hours—one capsule be
fore each meal and upon retiring.
