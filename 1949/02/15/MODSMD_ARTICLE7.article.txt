# Chappie Defeats Commie Menace
## 
### 
(Editor's note: With unbeliev
able brevity, the Chappie oilers
this gem as publicity for its latest
effort.)
Tor some time the staff of the
Chaparral has viewed with consid
erable alarm the rise of the dirty
red-fascist Communist menace in
this great free land of ours. (This
sentence is remarkable in that it
contains at least five popular cli
ches; this is known within the trade
as "out-hearsting Hearst.")
We have concluded that only the
most extreme measures will be suc
cessful in combating the Commu
nists and have acted accordingly.
The February issue of Chappie
will be on sale tomorrow.
THE COVER IS NOT RED!
This represents a major victory
for counter - revolutionary forces
the Communists have been sup
pressed. This fearless crusade
against the forces of evil and op
pression must and will be main
tained to prevent a counter coun
ter-revolutionary revolutionist en
counter.
