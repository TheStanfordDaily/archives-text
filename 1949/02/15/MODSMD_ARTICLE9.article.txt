# Fraternities to Hold Open Houses Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight between 7:30 and 9:30
each one of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities will hold an open house
welcoming all men interested in
joining a fraternity.
Designed principally as a means
of getting acquainted with those
who were unable to make the open
houses earlier in the year, the addi
tional date was decided upon last
Thursday at a meeting of Interfra
ternity Council.
During last month's rushing sea
son, many Encina freshmen said
they would favor some additional
open houses. There were many
dates which conflicted with the
scheduled open house evenings.
However, Ted LoVino, Interfra
ternity Council president, said at
the time that "the fraternities art
unable to act on this request, due to
house schedules that are already too
tight to admit changing.''
Now, in answer to the frosh re
quest, the Council, made up of a
representative from each Stanforc
fraternity, voted unanimously on an
additional date for tonight.
Moreover. LeVino said at the vot
ing session that the lack of enough
open houses is considered the major
defect in this year's rushing pro
gram. He said more are being
planned for next year.
All the fraternities have urj,ed the
visitors to come up and see as many
houses as possible tonight.
