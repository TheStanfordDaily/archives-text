# Chorus, SF Symphony Prove Good Combination
## 
### 
In their performance at the
Memorial Auditorium last night,
Pierre Monteux and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra again
distinguished themselves as one ol'
the finest orchestral groups in the
United States.
Proving itself deserving of such
company as the Stanford University
Chorus, Stanford Director Harold
C. Schmidt's group joined with the
orchestra to perform Brahms' "A
Song of Fate." The chorus showed
a mature emotional grasp of the
music. Perhaps at one point they
strained in trying to get volume.
But their dramatic, if not their
technical power, was on a profes
sional plane.
Monteux and the orchestra did
not show their full capabilities un
til the performance of Sibelius'
Symphony No. 2 in D Major. Con
ducting in his modest, restrained
manner, Monteux seemed to take
from the score exactly what Sibe
lius must have put into it. The
quietly exhilarating melodies and
calm power of the music were sen
sitively interpreted without being'
exaggerated.
Other numbers on the program
were the "Tragic Overture" and five
waltzes by Brahms, and "Configu
ration" by George Barati. In the
Overture, the orchestra's string sec
tion did a remarkably fine job. The
brass seemed a little uneven, per
haps a .little overpowering in spots,
but the small auditorium may have
been responsible.—Foster
