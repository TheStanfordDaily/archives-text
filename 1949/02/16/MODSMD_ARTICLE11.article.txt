## MacArthur Reports Red Advances Have Changed Jap Strategy Setup 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (AP)—General Douglas Mac Arthur's
request for more American troops in Japan has been rejected.
Secretary of the Army Royall said today.
"He was told it would be impractical to put more troops over
there," Royall said after returning from an 18-day inspection trip

through the Pacific area. He spent
six days in Japan.
Whether to build up America's
military strength has been a behind
the-scenes issue for months. IVlac-
A'thur, supreme Allied commander
in Japan, is understood to have re
parted to the War Department that
Communist advances in China have
upset Japan's startegic situation.
Back of Royall's announcement is
a long argument which dates back
to the early days of the war. One
school of thought contends that tht
Far East is vastly important, and
should receive more attention from
military planners in Washington.
Washington officials, on the othei
hand, reply that even the United
States is not strong enough to keer
a global defense line uniformly
powerful and that it must concen
trate its strength where it will do
the most good. Europe must have
priority over the Far East.
Royall said there was no discus
sion of Mac Arthur coming back to
the United States.
