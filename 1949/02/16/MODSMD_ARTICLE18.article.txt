# Pope to Air Cardinal's Trial Sunday; Ignore Claim He Was Informed
## 
### Associated Press 
Pope Pius XII will make another
major pronouncement Sunday on
the trial of Josef Cardinal Minds
zenty. He will address a demonstra
tion by Catholic Action, military lay
organization, in the square before
St. Peter's Church.
Catholic Action leaders estimate
about 400,000 persons will attend
the demonstration, called to protest
Hungary's trial of Cardinal Minds
zenty. Such a throng would rival
in size the unprecedented Easter
rally in St. Peter's Square before
the Italian election last spring.
Amid these preparations, the Vati
can gave scant attention to a dec
laration by a Communist spokesman
in Budapest, Josef Revai, that Hun
gary gave the Holy See an outline
of the charges and an opportunity
to remove Cardinal Mindszenty be
fore she acted against him.
"The Vatican never descends to
such compromises," an informed
source said, without confirming or
denying such a proposition was re

ceived. He said "the Catholic
clergymen live with their own peo
ple."
The chief spokesman of Hungar
ian Communists now says Jose:
Cardinal Mindszenty was brought t.
trial only after the Vatican had
passed up an opportunity to with
draw him.
Josef Revai, the spokesman, told
a mass meeting last night Hungary
officially informed the Vatican abou*
all charges against the Cardinal "ir
due time, before the trial," to give
the Vatican a chance to remove him.
"We would have let Mindszenty
go. only to help reconciliation be
tween church and state," Revai said
"The Vatican had the opportunity
to act. If the Vatican did not want
Mindszenty, we thought we could
go on and try him."
Although Revai said only the oft'ei
was made "in due time, before the
trial.' a government spokesman said
it was made before the arrest o:
the Cardinal Dec. 2G. After the ar
rest, he said, the trial was inevitable
