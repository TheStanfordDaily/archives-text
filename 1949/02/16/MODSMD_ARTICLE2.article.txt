# February Chappie Purged of Reds
## 
### 
(Editor's note: There'll prob- j
ably be another Chappie out next !
month, too. Life's a trap.)
Yesterday the announcement was |
made that the publication of the j
February Chappie, out today, is the !
greatest anti-Communist-coup since
the general elections in Italy, as the 1
cover of this issue is not red.
It has been brought to our atten
tion by a bright young man at the
Stanford Press that this statement
is not quite accurate; the cover j
does have a dash of red here and
there. This touch of red demon- :
.strates that Chappie is not an old- !
guard reactionary publication, while i
the more predominant black injects
the proper note of conservatism.
White—lily white, that is—covers a
large area of the cover, indicating
the general tone of the interior of
the magazine.
This politically correct issue of
the Chappy is on sale today at all
four corners of the Quad and at
the Post Office and Union. Get
yours early, before they're all
snapped up by Poly Sci majors.
