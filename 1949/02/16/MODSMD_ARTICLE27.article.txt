It is not hard to believe that Ori
ental craftsmen often spent their
whole lives on a single work of art
alter one has examined the current
Japanese diplay in the Art Gallery.
Two of the most spectacular
pieces, each representing at least
a lite-span of painstaking work, are
the 18th century wall tapestries.
One, precisely embroidered with
gold, silver, and pastel thread, por
trays a typical Japanese country
side. A resplendent peacock is set
forth on the other, amid lavish pink
and white flowers and a glistening
gold-threaded background. Every
feather tuft and blade of grass is
carefully stitched into this majestic
pipce.

Meticulous artistry of another
sort is to be found in the three
dimensional scenes carved into the
surface of two tire - thick ivory
tusks. A graceful Japanese figure
with a minutely elaborate hairdo
has also been shaped in ivory.
Although its silk has begun to
split and some of the seams are
fastened with glue, the 18th century
wedding robe may well be the most
striking exhibit on display. The in
tricate design with its compelling
red and silver is at once indicative
of Japanese spirit and charm.
The Japanese art has been se
lected lrom the Leventritt, lkeda.
and Hopkins collections and from
material Mrs. Stanford gathered in
the Far East.
