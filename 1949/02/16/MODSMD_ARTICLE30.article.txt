## Editor's Notebook

Several people have approached us about the sloppy condi
tion of the Nitery, Union Court, and music listening rooms. The
Nitery in particular resembles a pig pen despite the cleaning it
gets in the morning, evening, and light policing once an hour
during the day.
Since the Nitery is the center of student activity on campus,
we should make every attempt to place paper cups, bottles, and
cigarette butts where they belong. If proper care is not taken,
last ditch action will have to follow, such as closing the Nitery
do all but duly registered student groups.
It's to our advantage to have a gathering place like the Union
Nitery. The room is the only location on campus where all stu
dents from all living areas can get together for bull sessions, card
games, meetings, and relaxation.
Several weeks ago the parking lot between Toyon and Bran
ner was resurfaced. While the work is an improvement, its need
has been guestioned by students living in that area. The job
was criticized because across the street from Toyon there is a
parking strip that turns into a muddy morass every time rain
falls.
Car owners feel that a few dollars worth of gravel spread over
the area will form a surface firm enough to withstand the effects
of our spring rains. Their suggestion is guite justified and reas
onable.
Incidentally, that resurfacing project on the Toyon parking
lot was ordered to prevent mud from being tracked into the
men's dorm. Later in the year, the lot will become a volleyball
court.

Speaking of Toyon, we notice that the men voted to continue
the hall's support of the foreign scholarship program next year.
Outcome of the balloting on the program Monday had been in
doubt because of the belief that Toyon men were too decen
tralized among themselves to feel that the plan was profitable
for the residents. The FSP was approved by a large majority of
votes from 82 per cent of the men. The same result occurred in
favor of immediate installation of a television set.
Though interest in Toyon affairs does tend to break down oc
casionally, the situation appears to have been overemphasized in
the past.
