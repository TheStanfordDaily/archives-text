# Dance Bids
## 
### 
Complaints have been circulating among the students concern
ing the sale of tickets at the History Corner to the Benny Good
man Dance.
In spite of an efficient system developed by Cardinals for dis
tributing these tickets, several flaws in the system should be
corrected.
Tickets should be limited to one per person, instead of letting
each person buy two bids if he has two student body cards. This
would make it more of a first-come, first-served basis.
Cardinals is using this system of two student body cards per
person because some students have claimed that they do not
have a free period during which to buy tickets, even though
Cardinals has staggered ticket sales to cover the entire day.
Ticket sales should not start before the appointed hour. Yes
terday morning, a student posing as a member of Cardinals,
made a list at 10 o clock of the first GO in line at the History Cor
ner. Later, tickets were sold only to those who had signed up
earlier, but no effort was made by this person to notify the others
in line that the tickets had already been allotted.
Even though this was an unusual case, and probably will not
happen again, a better system would be to distribute numbers,
one for each student body card, as students arrived for tickets.
This would prevent anybody from jumping the line, and would
also prevent an excess number of people waiting needlessly
for tickets.
