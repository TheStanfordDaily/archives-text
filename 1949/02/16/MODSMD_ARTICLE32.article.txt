Village Tray Incident
To tlie Editor:
On behalf of the men of House 306, may I apologize for the incident
pollrayed by Mr. Taylor in the Village Pink Room in his letter Monday.
However, Miss Loi.s Lamfcerson, Village Dining Hall Director, and Mr.
Rollie Poppino. head hasher, have not indicated to me any displeasure
about the conduct of our dinner with the girls' from Mills College last
Friday evening.
Rather, they are in agreement with me that besides the girls being at
tractive and charming, it was a pleasure to have them here at Stanford
Village.
Mr. Taylor is speaking in an unofficial capacity, apparently as an after
dinner visitor to the Pink Room, which is used as a study in the evening.
A few of the boys may have been remiss about taking out their trays,
although I'm sure the few involved returned Saturday morning to correct
the situation.
