# TRUMAN PROGRAM
## Agriculture Gets Notice 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15 (/P> —In
the beginning much of President
Truman's "bold new program" of
teaching underdeveloped nations
American skills will be centered on
agriculture.
That's because any improvement
in living levels must be built on
well-fed peoples. Surveys show that
two-thirds of the world's population
is undernourished.
In carrying out a program for im
proving farming skills abroad, Mr.
Truman has two major agencies at
his disposal. One is the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of
the United Nations. The other is
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
This choice in the field of agri
culture— between an international
agency and one of the United States
government—points up a situation
that Mr. Truman will have to face
in working out his entire program.
The idea of a broad program for
helping less fortunate areas first was
attacked on a wide scale by a food
conference at Hot Springs, Va., in
1943.
Called by the late President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt this con
ference was hailed as the beginning
of a new era of international co
operation to raise world living and
social levels. Representatives of 44
nations attended. Included were
some of the best known authorities
on agriculture, food, and nutrition.
Out of this grew FAO. charged
with eliminating hunger and im
proving the economic lot of the
world's farmers.
FAO was to send technical ex
perts into underdeveloped areas to
teach them how their agriculture
could be improved and how food
producers could be assured of fair
returns. FAO already has made a
start on its work.
President Truman's program may
change all this. There are indica
tions that the United States may not
channel its activities through FAO,
but undertake them on its own.
Certainly the possibilities have FAO
officials and supporters worried.
In outlining his program in his in
augural address, Mr. Truman did
mention United Nations organiza
tions such as the FAO. He did indi
cate that there would be coopera
tion with them.
Nevertheless, initial steps in his
program indicate the United States
will do much of the work on its own.
The Agriculture Department has
disclosed that it plans to broaden its
present programs for providing
technical aid to other countries.
The department's program started
back in 1939 as part of the "good
neighbor" policy toward Central and
South America. It now covers 15
Western Hemisphere countries.
By next year the department plans
to extend it to such Eastern Hemi
sphere countries as Afghanistan,
Iran, the Philippines, Siam, and
Syria. This would double such ac
tivities.
After President Truman outlined
his plan, Sir Herbert Broadley. act
ing director general of the FAO.
said he hoped the United States
would operate through his agency.
He said he believed such a program
could be put over much more suc
cessfully if administered by an in
ternational agency.
Responsible officials at the Agri
culture Department say they believe
President Truman will want to work
through both FAO and the depart
ment. They say there is room for
both.
One official, who asked that he not
be quoted by name, says it must be
recognized that the United States
has a special interest in developing
some areas abroad, particularly the
Far Eastern areas to which Auri
culture Department help will be ex
tended next year.
