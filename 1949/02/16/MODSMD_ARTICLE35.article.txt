## Bull Session 
### 
How do things appear through the eyes of the grad students, those who
have come back to college to pick up some of the things they missed the
first time? Most of them are older than the general run of students at
Stanford. Lets go behind the specs of one as he looks over the current
crop of freshmen and see what he sees.
1. The Social Climber:
He s found the success formula for the social swim. He uses Duz be
cause Duz does everything. He shines his pledge pin with it; he uses it
as after shave lotion to break down the feminine resistance; he eats
it in place of vitamins.
Reaction:
A. I don't have to worry. I've got a wife waiting at home for me.
B. How are you going to set the world on fire, you little squirt?
C. You'd think I'd be old enough to know better than to try to keep
up with-these youngsters, but here I am young enough to try it again.
2. Hie Hepcat:
These kids have bees in their bloomers. They bounce each other off the
ceiling, grapple in what looks like legalized mayhem, and just generally
kick up their, heels but good.
Reaction:
A. 1 suppose they get married after one of these orgies.
B. And they used to raise cain about the Bunny Hug, my gawd!
C. OK, so I can't throw a girl over my shoulder any more. I've got more
dignity now.
D. I'm old enough to know better but young enough to try to learn.
E. Oh, my aching sacroiliac!
.'{. The Big-Money Man:
His old man is loaded and the lad is here in school trying to follow
in his dad s footsteps .... so that's the way he comes in every night—
loaded!
Reaction:
A. So I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I probably look
better without it, anyhow.
B. So you think the girls go for you spending all that money on them?
Yeah, I guess they do.
C. I'm old enough to know better but young enough to try to keep up.
4. The Big-Time Athlete:
The T-shirts he always wears show off his bulges to good advantage.
•He has to make a muscle-demonstration out of everything, even if it's
just to scratch his head over a test paper.
Reaction:
A. So you've got muscles—let's see you unbend a pretzel.
B. It seems to be enough of a workout for you boys just chasing the
girls nowadays.
C. Just remember, early to bed and early to rise—and your girl goes out
with other guys.
I). I m old enough to know better, and I do. My sports life consists of
making ice cubes for highballs.
5. The Hog-Wild Boozer:
He's going to impress the people in this school or bloat in the attempt.
Reaction:
A. Careful, son, it's a long' evening.
B. One hangover does more than three good critics to lower a man's
opinion of himself.
C. I'm old enough to know better! ''Double bourbon, please."
D. Ginger ale. please. My ulcers, you know.
(». The Campus Cutie:
Ah, the beauty of youth, the utter carefree innocence! She has a pair
of bold eyes entirely out of focus with the 12-year-old mind that backs
them.
Reaction:
A. I'd like to tell her about the birds and the bees and shock that look
of unadulterated innocence off her face.
B. Stop it, you fool, that chick's too young to fry.
C. Where's your baby-sitter, honey?
D. I'm old enough to know better, Ait young enough to try again.
C'mere, babe.
7. The Oomph Girl:
From bad enough to worse. This gal has a one-track mind, and it lead. c
in a circle. She likes older men—they're more mature. She also likef
younger men, middling men, tall, short, rich, poor men. If it wears lonj.
pants she throws herself at it. She's going to make an impression or bust.
Reaction:
A. She must read Hemingway.
B. New look, hell. That look's old as ihe hills.

How do things appear through the eyes of the grad students, those who
have come back to college to pick up some of the things they missed the
first time? Most of them are older than the general run of students at
Stanford. Lets go behind the specs of one as he looks over the current
crop of freshmen and see what he sees.
1. The Social Climber:
He s found the success formula for the social swim. He uses Duz be

B. How are you going to set the world on fire, you little squirt?

up with-these youngsters, but here I am young enough to try it again.

better without it, anyhow.

girls nowadays.

with other guys.

making ice cubes for highballs.
