# Ram's Head One Act Plays Will Open Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
Personal observations on the Ne-
- White program in New York
City prompted Herb Blau to write
"By Definition," which will be
among the One-Acts presented by
Ram's Head tomorrow through Sat
urday at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater.
The play is set in a Greenwich
bar which is almost a dive. Behind
the predominant conflict mingle the
types of characters which usually
inhabit such places, while woven
through the entire structure is a
love plot.
"By Definition" won the Margery
Bailey Award this year. Another of
Blau's one-acts, "Whose Fault Is
Mine?" dealing with juvenile de
linquency. was presented here fall
quarter.
In the moduction shadow effects
will be employed for emphasis in
the dimly lit bar.
In contrast to the seriousness of
"By Definition." the' comedy "Mor
decai's Will" will be performed in
the midst of a red-shaded Vic
torian bedroom setting.
Mordecai, an old man but still a
practical joker, has his fan in
watching two aunts, an overanxious
brother, and various other relatives
trying to grab their share of his in
heritance.
The setting for this play is a pro

file set, in which half of the set is
drapes.
The remaining play on the bill.
"Expecting Trouble." requires no
set. The comedy deals with a slight
entanglement which develops when
a college theatrical group starts re
hearsing.
Tickets for any of the three nights
may be purchased at the ASSU of
fice for 75 cents.
The one-acts this quarter are the
only purely dramatic activity pre
sented to the public by Ram's Head
dramatic society. Their other two
annual shows, the Gaieties and the
Spring Show, are musicals.
