# Gaillard to Play Hot Jazz at Rally
## 
### 
Long awaited by Stanford's all
round sports fans, a rally boosting
four of the Farm's neglected sports |
will be held on Feb. 25.
Special feature of the evening is j
Slim Gaillard and his mellow-rooney
music. Slim has promised to arrive
at 7:30 p.m., ready to play as long
as he's wanted—within reason—ac
cording to Hap Black, co-chairman
of Rally Com.
In addition, a lot of noisy appre- j
ciation for the undefeated rugby'
team, a rousing send-oH for the'
spring sports of baseball, track, and
swimming will be in order.
