### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 15 (/l*)â€”
The San Francisco Seals tonight an
nounced outright release of pitcher
Tommy Fine, who came to them last
year from the Boston Red Sox.
General Manager Charles J. Gra
ham said Fine's release, like
of pitcher Dob Joyce and catcher
Will Leonard earlier, was due to the
new play* r limit ruling restricting
squads to 20 veterons and three
rookies.
"Somebody has to go," Graham
said.
Fine, 34, who represented part of
the Red Sox payment for Neill
Sheridan, finished the 1948 season
by winning five, losing six.
