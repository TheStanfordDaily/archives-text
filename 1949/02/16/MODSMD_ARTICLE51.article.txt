# Cal-Stanford Relays Set For March 26 in Stadium
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
. For the first time since before the war, Bay Area track fans
will get an early glimpse of the season to come when the Indian
and Bear cinder teams clash in the Stanford-California Relays
to be held at Stanford Stadium on Mar. 26.
The Relays originated in the 1940 track season when a strong

*Card track squad, headed by speed
i ster Clyde Jeffrey, swamped the
i Bears, 3GI-3 to 23 2-3.
Even though it was early in the
season, an Indian two-mile relay
team ol Jack Moore. Burman Shra
ble, Paul Moore, and Mushy Girard
| broke the National Intercollegiate
record in the sensational time of
i 7:37.7,
The famous mile relay team of
Ernie Clark, Charlie Shaw, Craig
Williamson, and Jeffrey also put on
a splendid showing in 1940 by whip
ping the Bears' four-man team in
3:11.8. The Cards copped all of the
track events except for the Distance
; Medley Relay to win the meet with
ease.
Cal Turns Tallies
However, the '41 meet was just
i the reverse, as the Bears routed
Stanford, 41 to 19. Led by Glover
Klenimer and Captain Clarence
| Barnes, the men from Berkeley
I copped nearly all of the track events
i to win the meet handily.
The Relays were discontinued
i during the war, but will be revived
again this season. Each school must
have four men compete in every
| event, including the field events.
There are 12 track and field events
in all, each counting five points, for
a total of 60 points.
With the series tied at one meet
1 apiece, both teams are looking for
ward anxiously to the contest. The
Indians have definite superiority in
some events, especially in the field,
but the Bears look to dominate most
of the track relays.
Card Hurdlers Tops
The championship Card shuttle
hurdle relay team of Skip Kent,
Del Russell. Downing McKee, and
Darrell Kreitz. is almost a sure bet
to capture that race this year. The
Indian foursome ripped through the
event in 59.3 seconds last year, a
record that has been fettered by
only four teams in the history ot
the event.
The four-man Stanford shot put
aggregation should also shatter the
Relay record of 189 feet set by the
Indian team in 1940. Coach Jack
Weiershauser of the Indians has
three men, Otis Chandler, Norm
Nourse, and Lou Davis, who have
already thrown over 50 feet.
Veteran Steve McKeKe, who has
been credited with tosses over 48
leet. will probably be the fourth
man. If the four Card aces could
average .")0 feet, there would piob
ably be some kind of collegiate rec
j ord in order.
Bear Two-Mile Team Strong
The Bear two-mile relay team will
be hard to beat. Don Jackson, Phil
Arnot. and Dick Cotton will all be
back this year, although they will
have to hustle to break the fast
7:37.7 meet record set in 1940.
The Bears also will be heavily
favored to capture the 440- and
880-yard relays.
Angell Field, the Indians' practice
field, is in very poor shape at thÂ»
present time because of continued
rains and frosts. The new resur
facing job is only half finished, leav
ing the track soft and mucky. How
ever, a few more days of cleai
weather will dry the track suffi
ciently to complete the badly-needed
resurfacing job. In the meantime,
most of the practices have been con
fined to the inside track.
The Cards this season have sehed
| uled seven dual meets in addition
to the Relays, PCC, and National
meets. Opponents include COP,
UCLA. San Jose State, Olympic
Club, Southern Cal. and Cal. All
but the UCLA and Cal meets are
scheduled for Stanford Stadium.
