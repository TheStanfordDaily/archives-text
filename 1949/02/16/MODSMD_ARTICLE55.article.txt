## Thru Breier's Pipe Mural Basketball Passes Halfway Mark; Gymnasts Hold Local Spotlight Tonight 
### 
One of the most successful intramural basketball seasons ever held at
Stanford has passed the hallway mark and with this week's games heads
into the linal stretch. Most of the teams in the 17 leagues have played
three or four of their five games.
Seven nights of regular play remain on the schedule, and after the make
up games are played the finals will begin. The winners of the 17 leagues
will meet in a four-day tournament that will probably start on Mar. 3.
. Out of (he mixup of the 106 teams entered in the mural competition,
there have emerged some top-flight organizations. The policy of some
of the Row teams in putting their best players on the supposedly second
or third team entered by that house has paid oft in some instances and
backfired in others.
But all in all the leagues aie quite uniform and close races have de
veloped. In most cases two or three teams have dominated the play
with the lesser squads dropping by the wayside.
All-Star Squad to He Chosen
During the finals, the members of The Daily sports staff who cover the
games, and representatives of the SAC will meet to choose an all-star six
man squad. These men will receive medals for winning a place on the
mythical team. Players will be chosen from the entire mural setup and
not just from the teams that won most of their games during the tourna
ment.
The choice of this team, as in most polls, will be a rather haphazard
affair. The fact that there are many good basketball players from which
to choose won't make the task any easier.
I believe a team could be chosen that could beat both the Braves and
the Frosh. 11' I were to choose such a team at this time, I would raime
Bob Janssen, Bob Swingley, Claude Rosenberg, Dave Holman, Bob Ander
son. Dude Anguis, and John Hall. That's a pretty good outfit but many
of the mural fans could probably pick one as good. As mentioned above,
there are many good men from which to choose. I, for one, would like
to see a mural team such as. this play the Braves or Frosh.
\S omen Are Cordially Invited
Those of you with some free time tonight could do a lot worse than
drop in at the Encina Gym Gymnastics loom at 8 p.m. The Farm squad
will host San Jose State who, if for no other reason than the heartbreaking
losses to Stanford in football and basketball, will be out to take the Cards.
Women are invited, too. Entrance is through the door near the swimming
pool.

are entered in each event. The four best shot puts of each man are
added, and the team with the winning total wins that event, etc A
