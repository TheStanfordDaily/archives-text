### 
Robert North, research assistant
at the Hoover Library, explained
the position of Russia in the Chi
nese civil war yesterday in an ad
dress on "Russian Policy in China."
North, studying on a fellowship
from the Carnegie Project on Revo
lution and Development of Inter
national Relations, spoke in the
Village Pink Room.
'Stalin did not want to build
world revolution all at once," North
stressed. "His idea was to build so
cialism in one country."
North stated that qualified ob
servers in the present conflict are
agreed that the Chinese Commu
nists have not built up their present
strength solely by Russian arms and
assistance.
''During the period when the
Kuomintang was fighting both the
Chinese Communists and the Japa
nese. Moscow shipped supplies to
the Nationalist government, not to
the Reds. The Communists were
left on their own."
"When it appeared that Japan
would lose the war," said North.
"Russia attacked the corruption of
the Nationalist government. The
Pact of Friendship was signed in
1G45 between the two nations, after
which the civil conflict broke out
once again."
