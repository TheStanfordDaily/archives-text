A list of what girls dislike most
in men has been compiled from a
wide assortment of University of
Miami coeds by Miami Hurricane
feature writers:
Heading the list, and running
neck and neck, are dirty fingernails
and conceit. "God's gift to women."
and he who "constantly tries to
prove he's a college yo-yo," are
definitely taboo. Dirty and bitten
down fingerails are not only taboo—
"They are strictly repulsive," ac
cording to the long-nailed coeds.
"Men who can't stop talking about
how much money they spend, who
can only talk about cars and how
last thy can make them go. who
boast, generally, about every phase
of their lives, and who always try
to bo the life of the party," are
heartily condemned.
Vulgar language, sloppy dressers,
and men needing a shave, come high

on the list of dislikes. Cigars, beards,
suspenders, and mustaches are gen
erally condemned. Bad manners,
table and otherwise, are unappre
ciated by the gals.
The "overbearingly temperamental
male is very hard to endure," "Said
one of those interviewed.
Sarcastic men. loud men. lazy
men, and those with shallow, in
sensitive natures are among the
banned. I like a fellow who has am
bition—who can talk about some
thing besides the race track and
cars," is the way one coed put it.
Male superiority complexes come
at the head of the list. "The kind
of boy who thinks he's superior in
intellectual ability to the female—
tells you what to wear, criticizes
every little thing about you, and
insists on choosing the evening's en
tertainment.
Men at Ohio Wesleyan were quick

to reply to the Florida poll with
their tabulation of what's wrong
with women:
The consensus was that painted
finge mails in run-down condition
compares quite favorably with the
men's dirty finger nails condemned
by the coed. One chap inferred that
some women paint their nails to
cover up the dirt.
One male complained about
women being late for dates, saying
that many coeds take the stand that
if they are on time for a date, they
are showing too much interest. Ac
cordingly. they show up anywhere
from 10 to 40 minutes late. They
also "tend to put too much emphasis
on the amount ot money possessed
by their date," he continued.
Another interviewee begged that
women at least "try to act natural
wit! ntTecting the mannerisms of
a si< ning 'teen-ager attempting to
play ! ■►use.
