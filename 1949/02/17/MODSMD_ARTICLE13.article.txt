# An Open Letter to YOU!

To the Student Body:
There have been many complaints about the manner in which ticket sales
for the Benny Goodman Dance have teen handled. Cardinals would like
to clear up all doubts, questions, and criticisms concerning the sales.
In the first place, it is unfortunate that only 700 tickets may be sold
and that the demand is probably around 1.500. The shortage of tickets wilt
just have to be accepted and from that point equitable methods of distri
bution have to be worked out. Cardinals thinks that a pretty good method
hiiS been worked out.
As was done yesterday, numbered "priority" slips will handed out today
and tomorrow. Then only those holding one of these slips will be allowed
to buy a ticket at the time of the sale.
This system brings forth many questions which Cardinals will attempt
to answer:
Why are the numbered "priority" slips handed out?
Answer: Because many persons would "let somebody get in line in front
of them" just a few minutes before the sale started, thus cutting someone
out at the end of the line who may have been waiting for two or three
hours.
But as soon as a person gets a numbered slip can he stop .waiting in line
end come back at the time of the sale?
Answer: A Cardinals representative will be at the Union Court to inform
those waiting in line that they must remain there even after they have
secured their numbered slip.
How do you know when to pass out the numbered slips?
Answer: This is the real problem. What Cardinals has attempted to do
is to pick out an agreeable time for everyone to pass out the numbered
slips.
If the sale starts at 2 p.m., and 150 people are lined up by 11 a.m. and
the numbered slips are handed out at 11, a remedy has been l'ound for
persons cutting into the line after that time.
If the numbered slips were handed out before 11, then even with a
Cardinals representative there to keep people around after they have ob
tained their slip, many people would leave the line for the next few hours.
This would not only defeat the idea of setting a time for the sale, but
would also be unfair to those who come later. They would be willing to
stand in line for three or four hours but would be out of luck, since all of
the numbered slips would have been passed out.
Cardinals sincerely regrets that the demand for tickets for the dance
cannot be satislied. All that is possible is being done to distribute the
tickets fairly so that all may have an equal chance to go to the dance.
As it looks now, you'll have to get in line long before the sale actualh
begins. Those who wish to wait in line for a long period of time should
be rewarded by being able to obtain a ticket.
