WASHINGTON. Teb. 16 (/P).—
Secretaiy of State Acheson de
clared emphatically today that
American policy toward the pro
posed North Atlantic Security
Treaty has not changed.
He thus challenged complaints in
Western Europe and Communist
propaganda claims that the United
States was backing down on its in
tention to make an effective defense
alliance with the Western Euro
pean nations.
His statement was issued at a news
conference in response to questions
prompted by assertions of Senate
leaders that this country cannot
make v any automatic commitment to
go to war in case one of the other
nations in the security system is
attacked.
The precise kind of commitment
which may be made is still being
negotiated and Acheson did not dis
cuss it. He talked instead about
"objectives" and "policies" and de
clared that in this respect there are
"no real differences" between the
State Departmnt and the Senate's
bi-partisan foreign policy leaders,
Connally (D.. Tex.) and Vanden
berg (R., Mich.).
