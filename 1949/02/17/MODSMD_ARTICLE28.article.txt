VATICAN CITY. Feb. 16 (/P).â€”
Diplomats of nations presented
Pope Pius XII today a message de
claring the treason trial of Josef
| Cardinal Mindszenty an "offense to
I religious, personal, and political
! liberty.' They gave the Pope their
sympathy.
From a gold, red, and ivory
throne, the Pope expressed his
; thanks.
"In the midst of the conflict that
! opposes the defenders of a totali
j tarian regime against the champions
j of a concept of the state and society
founded, according to the will of
; God, upon the dignity and the lib
-1 erty of man," he said, "this historic
audience faithfully reflects the
thoughts and aspirations of by far
the largest and most wholesome
i part of the community.
"It manifests the reaction of the
i Christian, or simply human, con
| science against all oppression and
all arbitrariness, against all denial
of justice and all menace to sacred
| rights and principles."
