WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (/P). —
Overriding Republican cries of "so
cialism," the Democratic-controlled
House overwhelmingly votec 1 ap
proval today on the first big money
bill ol 1949. The vote was 367 to 19.
Hie measure calls for the appro
priation of $471,895,177 to run 35
iederal agencies and offices until the
end of the current fiscal year, June
30. It now goes to the Senate.
GOP protests that the bill would
foster socialistic trends in the fed
eral government centered on a $2,-
500,000 item for construction of a
Tennessee Valley Authority steam
power plant at New Johnsonville,
Tenn.
An expected battle today over
whether top Reclamation Bureau
executives should be engineers did
not develop.
Rep. Wadsworth (R„ N.Y.) offered
an amendment to extend a require
ment voted by Congress last year
that the Reclamation Commissioner
and the Bureau's regional directors
must be engineers. The effect was
to dismiss Commissioner Michael
Straus and Regional Director Rich
ard L. Boke, Sacramento, Calif.,
from their jobs. Neither is an en
gineer.
Wadsworth's amendment was de
feated 136 to 87.
