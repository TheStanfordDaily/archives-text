## Honor versus Proctors 
### 
Occasionally we stumble upon editorials from other collegiate
papers that contain criticism of their proctoring systems. The
Harvard Crimson editorial quoted below gives us an indirect
example why the Stanford Honor Code is the greatest single
asset v/e own in student government. Point three in the follow
ing editorial, by the way, is an item a number of Farm faculty
should investigate.
"Examinations are here again, so it is time to make the following
pleas. If acted upon, they would help make examination time
even more a period of joy, gladness, and genuine profit than it
is already.
"1) Proctors should say to themselves every five minutes "I
?.m not now, nor was I ever, a representative of the Federal Bu
zeau of Investigation." By doing this, they might be able to
eliminate the stealthy creep and the awful eye that characterize
so many Harvard examination rooms. A student taking an exam
,s a pathetic creature. Let him at least feel that if he looks around
?he room or glances at his watch, he is not in danger of instant
indictment by the House Un-American Activities Committee.
"2) Without exception, students should be allowed to see their
corrected exams and to discuss them with some official of the
course in question. If there is any educational value at all in the
business of taking examinations, a large part of it is lost when
a student can not find out what was good and what was poor
.n his paper.
"3) On top of that, he ought to be able to keep his paper,
tf/hether he wants it for future reference, or for sentiment's sake,
or for no special reason at all, he has more use for it than the
particular Department involved, which can do nothing more
valuable with it than donate it to an old-paper drive.*'
