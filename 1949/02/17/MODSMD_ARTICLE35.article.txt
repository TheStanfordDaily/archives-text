To the Editor:
For the first time since 1942 Stanford has a winning team in a major
sport. What has been done aout this? Not a damned thing! The big
wheels of most highly exalted Rally Com have done absolutely nothing
about building up a Utile student spirit to help the team over the rough
spots. It is a commonly recognized fact that all the members of Rally Com
-re suffering from nervous breakdowns following their tremendous efforts
in behalf of our football team last fall; but we believe that a few of them
cr.uld recover temporarily, sufficiently to make their usually feeble effort
at building up student backing for our team.
We realize, of course, that it is easier to write mere scathing sports
columns in The Daily about how poor our basketball team looked in the
games last weekend; but a little well-directed criticism and comment
about the refusal (or ignorance) of Rally Com to make an effort to boost
the basketball team would be in order.
At several points during the last month there were very good examples
of the need we have for rallies in behalf of our representatives on the
hardwood. It is our opinion that, for the games played in the Southern
Division, an ideal spot for a rally would have been preceding the first
games. These games have opened the first Southern Division series in
which the Indians played at home since 1943. Also we could have done
much to bolster our team's chances if we had sent them down to L.A. with
the cheers of several thousand avid rooters ringing in their ears.
It is our earnest opinion that our team could use a little exhibition
of spirit to show them that the students are backing them to the hilt.
Ji has gone almost to the point now that the situation is beyond helping;
l.ut even a little very belated help would be greatly appreciated by the
very hardworking men who represent us on the basketball floor.

(Editor's Note: At the beginning of (he season Coach Everett Dean
was approached by members of Kally Com on the matter of holding a
rally lor the basketball team. At the time Dean said that he would prefer
to wait until the end of the season. He bases his view on the fact that
the team would rather have one big rally than several poorly-attended
ones.)
