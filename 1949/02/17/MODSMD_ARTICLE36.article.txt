# Charity and the FSP
## 
### 
To the Editor:
You have rightly criticized the Excom decision on the Foreign Scholar
ship Program. "Charity begins at home" is an old saying which, when
applied here, means that not a single Stanford student should be forced
to drop school for lack of grants-in-aid due to FSP scholarships.
Again, "charity knows 110 boundaries" is another Eastern saying which
f-trongly amplifies your view of international aspects of FSP. Your readers
rnust realize—Excom members in particular—that the noble idea of FSP
is beyond all color and creed, race and religion.

(I'd- Note: I lie Daily editorial Monday said that "Although we need
Ijoth programs, little factual material was presented on the value of the
two projects as compared with other ASSU projects. Furthermore, no
data was given to show which of the two projects could do the most
good to the student body."
(While allotment of ASSU money for the projects was based on value
judgments, we now add, the decision should not have been made until
more supporting evidence had hecn reported. Money budgeted for (he
grants is only a sliver of the total amount needed; in the same way, the
I SP students now at Stanford arc only a nucleus of a group that should
be much larger next year in many American universities.)
