## This Kilroy Myth 
### 
Kilroy is old as the hills. Five
ancient sandst'on e inscriptions
carved 1,500 years ago in the red
walls of the Wadi Feiran, in the
Sinai region of the Near East, have
been collected by the Egyptian di
vision of the Oregon University At- ,
rican expedition.
The inscriptions, of which there
are about 2,600 in the region from
Petra in Trans-Jordan to South
western Sinai, were gouged out of
the rock by the Nabateans, Arabs oi
an old kingdom which was once a
Roman province. Individuals, who
had taken a journey and were anx
ious to record the fact, carved their
names in the sandstone, an action ;
comparable to the modern Kilroy ;
craze.
But just who is Kilroy? That is
the question that has bothered John I
Q. Public. The American Transit
Association has determined the real
Kilroy, at least to their own satis
faction. So they sent him, James '
J. Kilroy of Halifax, Mass., a street- |
car as token acknowledgment. And |
a streetcar is a handy thing to have
—if you have nine little Kilroys, '
anyhow, with no roof over their
heads.
Kilroy's Claim
Kihoy's claim is: "During the war
I was employed at the Bethlehem j
Steel Company's Quincy shipyard
inspecting tanks, double bottoms,
and other sections of warships under 1
construction. To satisfy superiors ,
that I was doing my duty, I scrib- i
bled 'Kilroy was here' on inspected '
work.
"Soon the phrase began to appeal' J
in unrelated places. I believe the j
14.000 shipyard workers who en
tered the armed forces were respon
sible for its subsequent world-wide :
use."
He will have a time proving his
claim to the general public, however.
The VFW has signed up 33 Kilroys j
already—just in the states of Massa- ,
chusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, and D.C.
Seventeen of them were in the
first World War. Generally we think 1
of the origination in big battle No. 2. |
However, the Army Times source
is that the original served in France i
as a first lieutenant in the 308th :
Field Artillery of the 79th Division.
Signs Beat Marines
On an initial invasion of the blue
Pacific, Marines were greeted on the j
beach by the sign "Kilroy was here." j
Suspected culprits in the plot were
a group of amphibious sailors that j
had been moored in their landing!
craft offshore overnight. Proof was
never gained, but it shows to what

lengths a gag will go.
Beside a chow line at the Naval
base in the Philippines was inscribed
"Kilroy starved to death waiting in
this line. On a latrine door in
Leyte was marked "Kilroy, Per
sonal." The last page of a Paine
Field library book bore the terse
reminder that "Kilroy read it first."
So a legend grows. Wherever we
went this character greeted us. Till
at last servicemen began to fight
back. On the wall of a small room
at Canto Island airfield, way out in
the Pacific waters, a pilot scribbled
a triumphant entry "I was here he
lore Kilroy." What happens? After
returning from his next flight this
cryptic taunt had appeared beneath
his own bit of wit—"Like hell you
were. I was here when this was only
a gleam in the CO's eye. Kilroy."
Others have tried. On Kwajalein
newcomers read, "No grass atoll, no
trees atoll, no water atoll, no women
atoll, no liquor atoll, no fun atoll."
Pre :sently the proud legend "And no
Kilroy atoll" was added. Then came
the needle, for the next day"he"
had written a postscript, "I just
didn't pause atoll. Kilroy."
Kilroy Missing
But the fabulous character missed
a couple of spots. Out of the Shangri
La Valley of New Guinea an Ameri
can WAC was rescued. "No Kilroy
there," reports. And when the
only man ever to get out of the
white Lolo country alive, Diebolds,
reached India, one of the first ques
tions put to him was, "Any sign of
Kilroy back there?" and his report,
too, was negative.
According to Newsweek, though,
this is how it really happened. One
day back in '43 at the Boca Raton
Field in Florida a notice appeared
on the bulletin board, "Kilroy will
be here next week." It was written
by Set. James Maloncy while his
buddy. Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr., wr>s
resting in the infirmary with a touch
of flu.
Moved to another station, Maloney
kept writing notices. Others took it
up, though few ever saw the hero,
since, ironically enough, he served
only in Italy and didn't move around
much.
Now Associated Press says he is
dead. His demise occurred October
27 when the army ROTC of Minne
sota University gave a military fu
neral to his effigy.
But Kilroy wasn't there! Francis
Kilroy is now just another civilian
in Everett, Mass. But that is how
it started. But then maybe you have
your own ideas on the subject. And
that is your privilege.

Moved to another station, Maloney
kept writing notices. Others took it
up, though few ever saw the hero,
since, ironically enough, he served
only in Italy and didn't move around
much.
Now Associated Press says he is
dead. His demise occurred October

But Kilroy wasn't there! Francis
Kilroy is now just another civilian
in Everett, Mass. But that is how
it started. But then maybe you have
your own ideas on the subject. And
that is your privilege.
Kilroy is old as the hills. Five
ancient sandst'on e inscriptions
carved 1,500 years ago in the red
walls of the Wadi Feiran, in the
Sinai region of the Near East, have
been collected by the Egyptian di
vision of the Oregon University At- ,
rican expedition.
The inscriptions, of which there
are about 2,600 in the region from
Petra in Trans-Jordan to South
western Sinai, were gouged out of
the rock by the Nabateans, Arabs oi
an old kingdom which was once a
Roman province. Individuals, who
had taken a journey and were anx
ious to record the fact, carved their
names in the sandstone, an action ;
comparable to the modern Kilroy ;
craze.
But just who is Kilroy? That is
the question that has bothered John I
Q. Public. The American Transit
Association has determined the real
Kilroy, at least to their own satis
faction. So they sent him, James '
J. Kilroy of Halifax, Mass., a street- |
car as token acknowledgment. And |
a streetcar is a handy thing to have
—if you have nine little Kilroys, '
anyhow, with no roof over their
heads.
Kilroy's Claim
Kihoy's claim is: "During the war
I was employed at the Bethlehem j
Steel Company's Quincy shipyard
inspecting tanks, double bottoms,
and other sections of warships under 1
construction. To satisfy superiors ,
that I was doing my duty, I scrib- i
bled 'Kilroy was here' on inspected '
work.
"Soon the phrase began to appeal' J
in unrelated places. I believe the j
14.000 shipyard workers who en
tered the armed forces were respon
sible for its subsequent world-wide :
use."
He will have a time proving his
claim to the general public, however.
The VFW has signed up 33 Kilroys j
already—just in the states of Massa- ,
chusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, and D.C.
Seventeen of them were in the
first World War. Generally we think 1
of the origination in big battle No. 2. |
However, the Army Times source
is that the original served in France i
as a first lieutenant in the 308th :
Field Artillery of the 79th Division.
Signs Beat Marines
On an initial invasion of the blue
Pacific, Marines were greeted on the j
beach by the sign "Kilroy was here." j
Suspected culprits in the plot were
a group of amphibious sailors that j
had been moored in their landing!
craft offshore overnight. Proof was
never gained, but it shows to what

lengths a gag will go.
Beside a chow line at the Naval
base in the Philippines was inscribed
"Kilroy starved to death waiting in
this line. On a latrine door in
Leyte was marked "Kilroy, Per
sonal." The last page of a Paine
Field library book bore the terse
reminder that "Kilroy read it first."
So a legend grows. Wherever we
went this character greeted us. Till
at last servicemen began to fight
back. On the wall of a small room
at Canto Island airfield, way out in
the Pacific waters, a pilot scribbled
a triumphant entry "I was here he
lore Kilroy." What happens? After
returning from his next flight this
cryptic taunt had appeared beneath
his own bit of wit—"Like hell you
were. I was here when this was only
a gleam in the CO's eye. Kilroy."
Others have tried. On Kwajalein
newcomers read, "No grass atoll, no
trees atoll, no water atoll, no women
atoll, no liquor atoll, no fun atoll."
Pre :sently the proud legend "And no
Kilroy atoll" was added. Then came
the needle, for the next day"he"
had written a postscript, "I just
didn't pause atoll. Kilroy."
Kilroy Missing
But the fabulous character missed
a couple of spots. Out of the Shangri
La Valley of New Guinea an Ameri
can WAC was rescued. "No Kilroy
there," reports. And when the
only man ever to get out of the
white Lolo country alive, Diebolds,
reached India, one of the first ques
tions put to him was, "Any sign of
Kilroy back there?" and his report,
too, was negative.
According to Newsweek, though,
this is how it really happened. One
day back in '43 at the Boca Raton
Field in Florida a notice appeared
on the bulletin board, "Kilroy will
be here next week." It was written
by Set. James Maloncy while his
buddy. Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr., wr>s

there," reports. And when the
only man ever to get out of the
white Lolo country alive, Diebolds,
reached India, one of the first ques
tions put to him was, "Any sign of
Kilroy back there?" and his report,
too, was negative.
According to Newsweek, though,
this is how it really happened. One
day back in '43 at the Boca Raton
Field in Florida a notice appeared
on the bulletin board, "Kilroy will
be here next week." It was written
by Set. James Maloncy while his
buddy. Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr., wr>s
resting in the infirmary with a touch
of flu.
Moved to another station, Maloney
kept writing notices. Others took it
up, though few ever saw the hero,
since, ironically enough, he served
only in Italy and didn't move around
much.
Now Associated Press says he is
dead. His demise occurred October
27 when the army ROTC of Minne
sota University gave a military fu
neral to his effigy.
But Kilroy wasn't there! Francis
Kilroy is now just another civilian
in Everett, Mass. But that is how
it started. But then maybe you have
your own ideas on the subject. And
that is your privilege.
Kilroy is old as the hills. Five
ancient sandst'on e inscriptions
carved 1,500 years ago in the red
walls of the Wadi Feiran, in the
Sinai region of the Near East, have
been collected by the Egyptian di
vision of the Oregon University At- ,
rican expedition.
The inscriptions, of which there
are about 2,600 in the region from
Petra in Trans-Jordan to South
western Sinai, were gouged out of
the rock by the Nabateans, Arabs oi
an old kingdom which was once a
Roman province. Individuals, who
had taken a journey and were anx
ious to record the fact, carved their
names in the sandstone, an action ;
comparable to the modern Kilroy ;
craze.
But just who is Kilroy? That is
the question that has bothered John I
Q. Public. The American Transit
Association has determined the real
Kilroy, at least to their own satis
faction. So they sent him, James '
J. Kilroy of Halifax, Mass., a street- |
car as token acknowledgment. And |
a streetcar is a handy thing to have
—if you have nine little Kilroys, '
anyhow, with no roof over their
heads.
Kilroy's Claim
Kihoy's claim is: "During the war
I was employed at the Bethlehem j
Steel Company's Quincy shipyard
inspecting tanks, double bottoms,
and other sections of warships under 1
construction. To satisfy superiors ,
that I was doing my duty, I scrib- i
bled 'Kilroy was here' on inspected '
work.
"Soon the phrase began to appeal' J
in unrelated places. I believe the j
14.000 shipyard workers who en
tered the armed forces were respon
sible for its subsequent world-wide :
use."
He will have a time proving his
claim to the general public, however.
The VFW has signed up 33 Kilroys j
already—just in the states of Massa- ,
chusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, and D.C.
Seventeen of them were in the
first World War. Generally we think 1
of the origination in big battle No. 2. |
However, the Army Times source
is that the original served in France i
as a first lieutenant in the 308th :
Field Artillery of the 79th Division.
Signs Beat Marines
On an initial invasion of the blue
Pacific, Marines were greeted on the j
beach by the sign "Kilroy was here." j
Suspected culprits in the plot were
a group of amphibious sailors that j
had been moored in their landing!
craft offshore overnight. Proof was
never gained, but it shows to what

lengths a gag will go.
Beside a chow line at the Naval
base in the Philippines was inscribed
"Kilroy starved to death waiting in
this line. On a latrine door in
Leyte was marked "Kilroy, Per
sonal." The last page of a Paine
Field library book bore the terse
reminder that "Kilroy read it first."
So a legend grows. Wherever we
went this character greeted us. Till
at last servicemen began to fight
back. On the wall of a small room
at Canto Island airfield, way out in
the Pacific waters, a pilot scribbled
a triumphant entry "I was here he
lore Kilroy." What happens? After
returning from his next flight this
cryptic taunt had appeared beneath
his own bit of wit—"Like hell you
were. I was here when this was only
a gleam in the CO's eye. Kilroy."
Others have tried. On Kwajalein
newcomers read, "No grass atoll, no
trees atoll, no water atoll, no women
atoll, no liquor atoll, no fun atoll."
Pre :sently the proud legend "And no
Kilroy atoll" was added. Then came
the needle, for the next day"he"
had written a postscript, "I just
didn't pause atoll. Kilroy."
Kilroy Missing
But the fabulous character missed
a couple of spots. Out of the Shangri
La Valley of New Guinea an Ameri
can WAC was rescued. "No Kilroy
there," reports. And when the
only man ever to get out of the
white Lolo country alive, Diebolds,
