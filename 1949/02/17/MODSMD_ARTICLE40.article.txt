Supcr-now look with a dial tone—
According to the Spartan Daily, a
topnoteh dress designer, Rene Hu
bert, has predicted that the "super
new look" will oust the '47 "new
look." Hubert says short skirts,
skin-tight, and slit lo the thigh, will
be back by 1950, along with "pop
over" necklines. But here's the top
per. Your 1950 outfits will come
equipped with built-in telephones—
in shades to match.
"It's not so fantastic," Hubert ex
plained. "They'll just be tiny walky
talkies. Only they'll come in at
tractive suede bags that hang on
your belt, and the receivers will
be collapsible."
All he needs now is for coeds to
embroider their telephone numbers
on their backs. That way, a rough
can look over the girls in his class
and call up for a date before a coed
gets off the Quad.
This should make the ratio even
tougher on guys who can even afford
a nickel for a phone call now.

Strike up the hand!
San Jose State must have taken
the super-new look seriously, be
cnuse the school's hand threw away
their old uniforms and adopted
snappy new outfits of gold and white
gabardine whipcord.
The difference, says the Spartan
Daily, is in the style of the coat. It
features a long, rolled lapel and
drape shape, as compared with the
old square-cut military style.
Well, all reet!

"Dry hones, them dry hones . . .

All you have to do to be listed in
"Who's Who Among Students in
American Universities and Colleges"
is to drop dead!
Al least that's what happened to
Goodrich C. Dooley, a skeleton who
was recently listed in the publica
tion. The skeleton has played a part
in pranks for 30 years at the uni
versity from which the name was
submitted.
So, if you have one foot in the
grave—watch it!

"Let it rain, let it rain
The University of California has
come up with an Indian rain formula
that actually seems to work.
A Cal archaeologist. Franklin Fe
nanga, saic. the first two things he
tried the rain-making "magic" he
got terrific downpours —and during
the worst state drought, too.
Fenanga got the rain-maker from
the grandson of a tribal medicine
man. Its parts, still in perfect work
ing order, include the tail of a bea

ver, snapdragon seeds, eagle down,
fossi! fish vertebrae,, bag of dust,
and various charm stones.
Indians claim that in addition to
guaranteeing rain, the charm can be
used to make winds blow, floods re
cede, and create practically any kind
of weather.
Okay, Mr. . Fenanga, now that we
know who's to blame for our recent
downpours, let's see what you can
do with this cold spell.

"Twinkle, twinkle, ÜBC
Hollywood isn't the only pLce that

The Daily Übyssey. the University
of British Columb'a now has a
heavenly body.
A two-star system recently "dis

However, ÜBC will probably have
