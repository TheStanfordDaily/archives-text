## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
Bright colors and yards and yards of rayons and velvets are the order
of the day in making costumes for the restoration comedy "The Relapse,"
to he given in Memorial Auditorium March 3, 4. and 5.
The play of manners calls forth the ultimate in clothes during an age
finery in dress at all social levels. Even dressing of the servants became

a matter of personal pride with the"
very rich, for the better dressed the
servant, naturally the richer his \
master.
Virginia Opsvig, costume director,'
has designed the clothes in typical
fifteenth century fashion. Men pa
rade in long-sleeved, tight-waisted,
short, full coats. Shoes are pointed
•harply at the toe and have high
heels.
Women's Fashions
The women have full-sleeved,
tight-waisted bodices which flare
over the hips to be drawn into a
bustle and long drape in back. Be
neath this "train" effect is a full,
long, contrasting skirt.
For hats the women wear fon
tages, little scooped-out beanies
with lots of frou-frou. The style was
irst set by Fontagne, a mistress of
Louis XIV, who one day while riding
in the park lost her hat and quickly
clapped her ruffled garter on her
head. Soon the idea was the rage
>f hat designers.
Fashions For Men
For the men this was the era of
the tricorne, which was seldom on
top of anyone's head but which
,'otild be easily carried in the crook
jf the arm.
At the ultra-social gatherings
women waved their fans while the
nen waved their handkerchiefs and
.ield their snuff boxes.
Long canes were all the style for
nen of the period, while women
.vho never ventured into the kitchen
considered frilly aprons a "must"
or a wardrobe.
This was also the day of the fuli
jottom, natural-colored wigs. The
ostume class "rolls their own'' with
•vhat is called plastic horsehair. The
fleet, if not the texture, is one of
hining, soft locks.
Hair Styles
The hair is permanently curled by
.vetting and rolling in curlers, and
s attached to a skull cap base for
convenience of the wearer.
Assistants in the costume depart
ment are O. G. Brockett, Rebecca
'.times, and Douglas Russell. Most
if the work is done by the costume
•lass.
