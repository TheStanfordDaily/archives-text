Originally we had intended to accompany your morning cup of coffee
with a Sidelines discussion of the post-season basketball tournaments.
Such items of interest as the NCAA finals at Seattle, the controversy over
the method of selecting regional representatives, possibilities of a New
York Invitational-NCAA playoff game this year, and our views of Stan
lord's spot in the national picture were on the agenda for treatment (or
mistreatment) this morning.
However, all that was mapped out before Fold-Up Weekend down in
the Southland. Our beloved Indians traveled south as the 10th team in
i the nation, and came home tied for the 20th spot.
1 Just exactly what's happened to the Deanmen we're not quite sure—
j but whatever it is. it's been coming on for some time now.
Actually, the Cards haven't played a game since they drubbed USF
almost a month ago. They had trouble getting going against outclassed
1 Santa Clara, experienced a terrible night with San Jose State, and were
i miles behind fast-stepping CCNY. The Pittsburgh debacle was strictly
j a farce that did them more harm than good.
Ifs Been a Long, Long Time
Three weekends without a sharp game. A team can't do much toward
enhancing its national prestige playing that way.
Everybody's got a theory on what's the matter. Sports Editor John Hall,
who saw the games in Los Angeles, came home with a dozen of 'em.
But whatever the trouble is, we don't think it's going to last. We'll even
go so far as to predict that the Indians will bounce back strong, with a
double over USC and UCLA this weekend.
A week's layoff should do Everett Dean's cagers a world of good. Five
j months is a long time to think about little besides putting a ball through
j a hoop. With three or four practice sessions and two games every week,
; the Indians may be getting just a little stale.
Coach Everett Dean seems to think so. He has padlocked the Pavilion
; this week save for one brief workout last night.
Let's Destroy Troy
Such a complete change in routine may be just what the doctor ordered.
By Friday night all traces of staleness may be gone, and the Cards psycho
| logically prepared to play their best game of the year against Sad Sam
Barry's Figueroa Street thugs.
At any rate, we hope so, and we'll just save our carefully prepared post
-1 season tournament notes until next week. Perhaps the black armbands
i will be gone by then.

We received a clipping in the mail this week which lends further sup
r.nrt to our argument that this (the San Francisco) area isn't a basketbal:
town—that the local interest in the game of bounce isn't ail that it should
i Ix.
It's from the University of Minnesota's Daily newspaper, and says that
seats for a recent Minnesota-lowa basketball game were sold out by
| noon of the day they went on sale. There's nothing unusual in that
except that Minnesota's Fieldhouse seats 16,000—the joint is even biggei
than the Cow Palace.
Bigger Than the Garden
The article goes on to say that the "strained" conditions will lie im
proved by next year, as plans are beyond the blueprint stage to add 4.00(
more seats before next season rolls around. Approximately $750,000 wil
be spent this summer to construct the seats and add a permanent ic<
hockey ring with a seating capacity of 6,500.
A far cry from the Farm, where it takes three days to give away 2,80<
' basketball tickets.

An interesting story about Cal's ice hockey team appears at the botton
i of the same clipping. We think it's worth passing on.
It seems that the barnstorming Bears hailed into Minneapolis severa
I weeks ago to take their annual shellacking from Minnesota's more adep
Gophers. During the course of one of the games the Cal goalie (wh«
made 118 saves during the two-game series) stopped one with his mouth.
When one of the officials skated over to his net to inquire about th
condition of his dentures, lan Watson opened his toothless mouth am
Said, "Heck, I haven't any. I lost them a long time ago."

An interesting story about Cal's ice hockey team appears at the botton
i of the same clipping. We think it's worth passing on.
It seems that the barnstorming Bears hailed into Minneapolis severa
I weeks ago to take their annual shellacking from Minnesota's more adep
Gophers. During the course of one of the games the Cal goalie (wh«
made 118 saves during the two-game series) stopped one with his mouth.
When one of the officials skated over to his net to inquire about th
condition of his dentures, lan Watson opened his toothless mouth am
Said, "Heck, I haven't any. I lost them a long time ago."

Originally we had intended to accompany your morning cup of coffee
with a Sidelines discussion of the post-season basketball tournaments.
Such items of interest as the NCAA finals at Seattle, the controversy over
the method of selecting regional representatives, possibilities of a New
York Invitational-NCAA playoff game this year, and our views of Stan
lord's spot in the national picture were on the agenda for treatment (or
mistreatment) this morning.
However, all that was mapped out before Fold-Up Weekend down in
the Southland. Our beloved Indians traveled south as the 10th team in
i the nation, and came home tied for the 20th spot.
1 Just exactly what's happened to the Deanmen we're not quite sure—
j but whatever it is. it's been coming on for some time now.
Actually, the Cards haven't played a game since they drubbed USF
almost a month ago. They had trouble getting going against outclassed
1 Santa Clara, experienced a terrible night with San Jose State, and were
i miles behind fast-stepping CCNY. The Pittsburgh debacle was strictly
j a farce that did them more harm than good.
Ifs Been a Long, Long Time
Three weekends without a sharp game. A team can't do much toward
enhancing its national prestige playing that way.
Everybody's got a theory on what's the matter. Sports Editor John Hall,
who saw the games in Los Angeles, came home with a dozen of 'em.
But whatever the trouble is, we don't think it's going to last. We'll even
go so far as to predict that the Indians will bounce back strong, with a
double over USC and UCLA this weekend.
A week's layoff should do Everett Dean's cagers a world of good. Five
j months is a long time to think about little besides putting a ball through
j a hoop. With three or four practice sessions and two games every week,
; the Indians may be getting just a little stale.
Coach Everett Dean seems to think so. He has padlocked the Pavilion
; this week save for one brief workout last night.
Let's Destroy Troy
Such a complete change in routine may be just what the doctor ordered.
By Friday night all traces of staleness may be gone, and the Cards psycho
| logically prepared to play their best game of the year against Sad Sam
Barry's Figueroa Street thugs.
At any rate, we hope so, and we'll just save our carefully prepared post
-1 season tournament notes until next week. Perhaps the black armbands
i will be gone by then.

It's from the University of Minnesota's Daily newspaper, and says that
seats for a recent Minnesota-lowa basketball game were sold out by
