# Excom Hears Budget Plan
## 
### 
A new system for over-all ASSU
budgeting was proposed by John
Poo! at last night's Excom meeting.
It would involve drawing up a pre
liminary budget and then fitting the
soecial ASSU organizations to this
budget.
This would let the students weigh
the value of one organization
against another when allotting
money, Pool explained. Also, since
the money would then be given to
the organizations in a lump sum,
it would allow them greater flexi
bility with their accounts.
Pool released a probable budget
for 1919-50, on which the prelimi
nary budget could be based:
Income
Fees, $1.25 per student. .$26,250

A new system for over-all ASSU
budgeting was proposed by John
Poo! at last night's Excom meeting.
It would involve drawing up a pre
liminary budget and then fitting the
soecial ASSU organizations to this
budget.
This would let the students weigh
the value of one organization
against another when allotting
money, Pool explained. Also, since
the money would then be given to
the organizations in a lump sum,
it would allow them greater flexi
bility with their accounts.
Pool released a probable budget
for 1919-50, on which the prelimi
nary budget could be based:
Income
Fees, $1.25 per student. .$26,250
