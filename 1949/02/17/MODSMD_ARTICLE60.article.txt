# Troy Forwards Are Top PCC Scorers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
When USC's league-leading Tro
jans pull into the Pavilion cage barn
next Friday night, they will bring
forth the top three forwards in the
Southern Division. Statistically
speaking, that is.
Bill Sharman, Joe White, and Abe
Androff, who all buy their text
books at the Trojan Book Store,
monopolize the three scoring de
partments: total points, field - goal
percentages, and free - throw per
centages.
Classy Bill Sharman is the top
individual scorer with 100 points in
six games for an average of better
than 16 point per game.
Abe Androff, Troy's likable team
captain, leads the field goal per
centages with .375. Androff has
been out of action recently with a
bad ankle.
Joe White moved into the lead as
the best free-throw tosser in the
division when Stanford's Dave Wa
vidson got a basket chill and missed
nine out of 11 over the weekend.
White put on the gas with seven
out of eight to brine his total to 15
out of 18. and the first-place posi
tion of . 533.
Bill Stephenson and Dave David
on, Stanford's contenders in the
scoring race, maintained their hold
on second and third p'aces, as Steve
brought his total to 78 and Dave
followed closely with 77.
Other Stanford men who rate in
the scoring columns include George
Yardley, whose 58 points give him
an eighth place in the total scoring;
Stephenson and Yardley. who rate
second and fifth in free throws: and
Davidson, who is fourth in field
goal percentages.
The fast-moving Bruins, who will
face Stanford in the Pavilion Satur
day night, have a few boys of their
own who have made the list.
Al'an Sawyer and Carl "Cry
baby" Kraushaar are fourth and
fifth respectively in Dixie scoring,
and Sawyer picked up a third spot
in the field goal percentages.

BICÂ» CARL KKAUSIIAAR, the man of the explosive personality, will
itart in the pivot spot when the fast-breaking Bruins cf L.A. tip-off
against Stanford in a crucial basketball game at the Pavilion Saturday
night at S. This game, along with the one on Friday against the pon
derous L T SC Trojans; will make or break the fading Indians in the
Southern Division race.
'lhe Westwood squad will leave Los Angeles on the Lark tonight
and will live at the Sir Francis Drake for the duration of their hard
wood invasion. Towering Carl is one of lhe most potent point-pushers
on the Bruin squad. From his position under the boards, he has racked
up 71 points in the Southern Division title race, good enough to rank
him lit lb in the individual scoring rate behind teammate A 1 Saw yer.
