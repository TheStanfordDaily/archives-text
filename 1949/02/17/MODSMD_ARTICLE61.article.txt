"Who is the top pivot man in the
eague?" This question has been
ticked around a lot by hardwood
enthusiasts recently, so let's take a
ook-see at the situation, men.
Tor Tramway Tech, hefty Stan
Christie has been handling the cen
er chores. Replacing SC's famed
Mox Hnnnum, he is 6 ft. 4 in. with
i well - built 204 - pound frame.
Christie has little varsity experi
:nce, as he was playing behind
iannum all last year.
For such a bruiser, he is fairly
igile and is plenty rough on both
)ackboards, especially the offensive
toppers; and he is a pressing,
roublesome guard in the key on
leiense.
Christie Hogs Ball
In one Cow Palace tilt when the
"rojans were battlint* USF, Chris
it? gave a demonstration of his out
tanding backboard skill. He re
•overed the ball four times in a
ow, and each time until a goa! was
cored, with a wrist hook pa§s he
lipped the ball back (o his mate,
landing on the free throw line.
This incident also gives another
nsire on Stan's play—he is not a
ood shot, and he doesn't try too
nany. In most of the conference
nines he has scored under 10 mark
ers.
Towering Carl Kraushaar, a
r'in'for from Compton JC, is UC
.A's center. Just a bit under 6 ft.
■ in., Carl is too slow for the Bruin
ast break. But his ability at tip
ns makes up for his slowness.
Krausliiiiir Erratic
Another "ood backboard "inn, he
s continually clearing the ball for
he Westwooders. An erratic scorer,
ic is unstoppable when having a
ood night. Other nights he is re
noved from the lineup to allow an
ther speedster to make the fast
ireak work.
Having one of his exceptional
nmes, Kraushaar gave the Stan
ord rooters a good show in the
onference opener. He rang up 22
loints, mainly on tip-in shots from
is mates' off-the-hoop passes.
Often allowing his temper to

flafe. Carl gets into trouble with
both the fans and the refs with his
continual complaining antics. He is
a junior with a year of eligibility.
Hagler of Cal
The Bear contender for the All-
Southern Division center slot, is
Bill Hagler. Although the Cal of
fense is of the scatter-ball variety,
Hagler is still tabbed as a top cen
ter. Employed as another man in
the pot-nnd-drive game, not as a
key center, he has demonstrated his
ability as a solid fundamentalist.
Hagler plays a smooth floor game,
setting up a large number of Bear

p'avs. He hits his share of long
shots and grabs a lot of balls off the
boards.
Bill is also a junior with another
year of basketball before him. With
additional experience, his solid and
well-tutored game should develop.
Next year he will be an even biggei
jog in the Bear machine.
Steve Tcps 'Em All
Playing his fourth year of var
sity ball. Bill Stephenson is the
oivot and captain of this year's
Stanford live. The floor general of
the Cards, Steve starts most of his
team's plays from the post with
well-executed hand-offs and over
head passes.
He emolovs a hard-to-stOD hook
shot, and when he is covered close
ly, he can move out of the key to
score from far out. An effective
scorer from anywhere on the floor,
Steve is averaging close to 14 points
per in loop play.
When the going gets tough, Ste
phenson seems to play better. He
should be even more valuable to the
Indian cause in the pennant drive,
as he continues to inspire his team
mates with the will-to-win spirit,
clever shooting, and field general
ship.

Bill is also a junior with another
year of basketball before him. With
additional experience, his solid and

Next year he will be an even biggei

Steve Tcps 'Em All
Playing his fourth year of var
sity ball. Bill Stephenson is the
oivot and captain of this year's
Stanford live. The floor general of
the Cards, Steve starts most of his
team's plays from the post with
well-executed hand-offs and over
head passes.
He emolovs a hard-to-stOD hook
shot, and when he is covered close
ly, he can move out of the key to
score from far out. An effective
scorer from anywhere on the floor,
Steve is averaging close to 14 points
per in loop play.
When the going gets tough, Ste
phenson seems to play better. He
should be even more valuable to the
Indian cause in the pennant drive,
as he continues to inspire his team
mates with the will-to-win spirit,
clever shooting, and field general

igile and is plenty rough on both
