# Bruce Iverson Elected Frosh B-Ball Captain
## 
### 
Blond Bruce Iveison, starting
guard for the frosh basketball team,
was elected their captain today.
Bruce has been a mainstay of thrf
potent Papoose outfit all year, scor
ing mere than his share of poincj
j and especially shining with his hus
tling defensive play. The blond
speedster's specialty, though, is ball
hawking and lie is so good at it that
his opponents are tight and off
balance as long as Bruce is hound -
ing' them.
