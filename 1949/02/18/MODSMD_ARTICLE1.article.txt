HAP BLACK AND DEAN BORBA catch up on their
studies as they fry a couple of eggs for a pre-dawn
lircakfast in Union Court. Determined to go to the
Denny Goodman Dance "at any cost," they pitched

camp during the night, and made themselves com
fortable for the long wait. Other students began to
line up for dance bids at 7:45 a.m.
