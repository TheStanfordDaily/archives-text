# Post Office Needs Divorce From Politics, Says Hoover
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 <A > ). â€” j
The Hoover Commission recom
mended today that the Post Office
Department be completely divorced !
from politics and put on a strict |
business basis.
In the fourth of a series of re
ports on its studies on reorganiza
tion of the government, the commis
sion told Congress:
1. The Postmaster General should

be barred from heading national
political committees, as has occurred
several times in the past.
2. He should be given an expe
rienced director of posts to serve as
operating head of the department,
while the Postmaster General de
termines policies.
3. The postal service should be
decentralized into 15 regions, with
regional directors and district su
perintendents.
4. Confirmation of postmasters by
the Senate should be abolished,
with those officials selected from
career men on a merit basis. (Only
today, President Truman sent up
700 postmaster nominations for the
Senate's consideration.)
5. The administrative structure of
the department should be simplified
to give it more flexibility.
6. The Postmaster General should
be allowed to set the rates for reg
istered mail, insured mail, C.O.D.'.s.
money orders, postal cards, and spe
cial delivery, to make each of tho.-e
services self-supporting. Congress
should continue to establish the
rates on first, second, third, and
fourth class matter.
Payments to common carriers
for transporting mail should not be
used to hide a subsidy for aviation.
The commission said that recur
ring annual post office operating
deficits have been caused for the
most part by circumstances beyond
the control of the department "and
can-be remedied only by strong and
courageous action."
