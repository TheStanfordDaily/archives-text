JERUSALEM, Feb. 17 <£>).—Dr. j
Chaim Weizmann was inaugurated [
today as the first president of the |
young state of Israel in a ceremony
filled with ancient Hebrew symbol
ism.
Thousands of spectators lining j
Jerusalem's streets cheered and
wept for joy as they viewed the |
procession held for the 74-year-old I
scientist who has devoted a life
time to the Zionist cause.
Weizmann took the oath in the
Jewish Agency Building before the '
recently elected Israeli Parliament.
The 120-member Parliament named
him president last night on the first
ballot after adopting a new consti
tution.
He had been provisional presi
dent since last May, when the Brit
ish surrendered their League of
Nations mandate over Palestine and
Israel proclaimed herself an inde
pendent nation. Weizmann is pro-

Western and outspokenly anti-Rus
sian in his views.
The provisional Israeli govern
ment, headed by Premier David
Ben-Gurion, resigned in accordance
with the procedure laid clown in the
new constitution. Weizmann will
ask Ben-Gurion to form a new gov
ernment.
