## Third Person Clause 
### 
One of the more disturbing issues concerning the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard is the position of third-person
responsibility. The guestion is raised again in Excom member
Ralph Miller's letter to The Daily below.
Excom has ruled that the Honor Code is apart from the Funda
mental Standard. And Excom has been given full and exclusive
right to interpret the Honor Code. (Letter from Acting President
Alvin C. Eurich 4o Dean of Students Lawrence Kimpton, Jan.
27, 1948.) Thus, third-person responsibility, as we know it here
at Stanford and as it was designated to operate under the Honor
Code, does not apply in the case of the Fundamental Standard.
Yet with the definiteness of policy the above paragraph es
tablishes, one phase of regulations—women's social regulations
—does operate on the basis that women "undertake the respon
sibility of accepting social standards in spirit as well as in actions,
and, individually and collectively, of upholding the fundamental
principles which lie behind the regulations." (Page 1, Social
Standards by and for the Women Students.) Council has inter
preted this sentence as meaning third-person responsibility.
This policy of enforcement is directly opposite to the ruling
passed by Excom May 19, 1948, which stated:
"In the opinion of Executive Committee, the Fundamental
Standard establishes a general standard for student conduct. The
Honor Code relates only to honesty in academic work. It is
neither desirable nor practicable that the Honor Code encompass
every phase of Stanford life, nor does the Honor Code place
on each student individually the responsibility for the observ
ance of all University or ASSU regulations."
Present interpretation of third-person responsibility in relation
to social regulations has existed for many years. Excom's more
recent May 19 interpretation of third-person responsibility super
sedes the older practice.
Apparently neither Excom nor Women's Council fully realized
the other group's policy, and this conflicting situation, therefore,
has existed since last May.
Since Excom has exclusive right to interpret the Honor Code,
we recommend that Excom reconsider as soon as possible perma
nent policy on third-person responsibility as applied to the
women's social regulations.
