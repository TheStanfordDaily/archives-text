# Chaplain's Chat

PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain
Last week this chat was written
in the aggressive mood. It was a
notification to the campus-commu
nity that the new (or revived) re
ligious program for Stanford would
refuse to be '"niched," and that its
leaders would ever be looking for
ways to gain the interested atten
tion of the students.
Of course I realize that the pro
gram and the personnel must both
earn the respect and obtain the per
ticipation of the student body. This
we solicit. We likewise solicit any
opinions, of whatever color; for we
are wide open to suggestions and
will give each its due. We are not
looking for "yes-men," except when
the "yes" can be cordially granted.
In outlining some of the plans to
be developed, I raised the point that
the program must be student-cre
ated and managed. Mr. Minto and I
mean that with all our hearts.
Beyond the direct preaching
function and other such appoint
ments, we consider that we are
here as "counselors" rather than as
"directors." The implication is that
we have a certain experience to
contribute; and, to be sure, we are
expected to pace the enterprise
since we occupy the spot given us.
Yet we are fully aware that we
will get nowhere fast unless the
student leadership of this Univer
sity shares the concern for a vital
religious experience, and organizes

ways in which to assure its reality.
Stanford has always had a tradi
tion of student autonomy in campus
life. I have been soaking myself in
"Stanfordiana" by reading such
books as Professor Elliot's "Stan
fordâ€”the First Twenty-five Years";
"Mrs. Stanford." a book by her de
voted companion; and several of
the volumes from the pen of Dr.
Wilbur.
This student liberty, together
with its assumption of parallel re
sponsibility to keep behavior conso
nant. with Stanford ideals, is cfbvious
history. Hence, our p!ans for cre
ating a "Council of Religious Ac
tivities" would seem to be in stride
with proper and acceptable habits
here.
This Council is envisioned as a
body of students, generous in size,
and chosen to be representative of
all quarters of the campus. To this
Council all religious activities on
campus, of whatever nature, would
be related; and from the Council
would go stimulation for various
projects of its own choosing. Its
formation is in process, and we hope
to have its first caucus early in the
spring quarter.
In these successive comments I
wish to elaborate on the other sev
eral majors in our program. Mean
time, it would be a great idea if
you who are reading this column
would speak to the chaplains about
your ideas of how and where we go
from here.
