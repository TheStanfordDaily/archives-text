# Freeze Hits Farm Gardens, Heating Plant
## 
### ALLEN JOYCE 
It was never like this down
south, snapped our Southern Cali
fornia friend when (he big freeze
hit last month. Not being the type
to let a slur from the south pass, 1
gently reminded him of the bliz
zards in L.A., the Balboa shivers,
and all the ice in Hollywood.
"Makes no difference," he contin
ued. "It it gets any colder I'll need
a haylift or a Saint Bernard to get
me to my 8 o'cloc." We were pon
tile to my 8 o'clock." We were pon-
Saint Bernard from the President's
storm funds, when roommate Dale
pecked around from behind Dante's
"Divine Comedy."
"It's a fact," he said, "that the
cold weather wi:l not only be costly
for the ranchers and the citrus
growers, but also for the University.
Now Dale is the kind of guy that
comes up with this sort of thing, so
we inquired further. "You mean,"
we asked, "the University will be
had by the cold?"
"Quite so. I talked with Mr.
Blacker, superintendent of build
ings and grounds, and he said the
University's heating bill for January
was $15,000. Although this was a
record expenditure, some still com
plained of the cold." Dale gets
around, you see.
"Moreover, Mr. Scherer, the gar
dener foreman, informs me that
plant damages are extensive."
"Not really!" This was the sort of
thing one generally didn't know.
"Quite so. How many flowers,
bushes, and trees were killed can
not be ascertained for some time.
Preliminary reports do indicate that
many small plants are lost, and
there is the possibility that some of
the larger trees, such as the euca
lypti, are dead."
How Dale ever gets the dope, we
don't know. Nevertheless, lie is al
ways supplementing our limited
knowledge with these choice bits.
"Dale," we inquired, "what other
damage was caused?"
"Well, that just about covers it.
There were a few frozen pipes
about campus, but nothing of a seri
ous nature."
Yes sir, we can always count on
Dale. One day it's a hot story; the
next day it's a cool one.
