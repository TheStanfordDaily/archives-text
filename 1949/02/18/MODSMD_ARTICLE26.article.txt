This week's long faces are being
worn by the first-year law students.
The boys just got their grades back
Irom last quarter's exams in Crimi
nal Law. To put it mildly, the boys
are a trifle apprehensive as re
gards their futures before the bar.
Out of a class of about 250 law
students there was but one "A" and
a handful of "B's." The rest net
ted what's usually left over. One
young man who got a you-know
what wanted to know if there's an
opening some place for a "good"
pogo-stick and yoyo salesman.
By dawn's early blush it would
look like there's nothing but lump
lumps in the class, which, to put it
mildly, is nothing but a base canard
and a lie to boot. Without knowing
one thing about it, we hereby go
on record as stating that this year's
neophytes are no dumber than their
illustrious predecessors.
The trouble lies elsewhere, and
the boys are getting co'd-shoul
dered by circumstances beyond
their control. The trouble seems
to be that there are just too many
lawyers around, and considering
the sizes of the first-year classes in
the various legal mills around here,
there's going to be a lot more. Or
rather, there WAS going to be a lot
more.

It seems that the Bar Assoeiatio
—which is the state legal licensin
agency — has adopted some hard
headed tactics to prevent a furthe
glut on the market. Last October'
bar examination dealt a rough an
rude blow both to the local lax
school and to the lads involved. 1
flunked about 10 of the Farm as
pirants.
Oh, you should have heard th
moaning, and the groaning, and th
weeping, and the waiiing. In th
first placc, it was a gross affront t
the Stanford Law School, and in th
second place it was far from funn
to the guys who had invested si
years of schooling only to be turne
down.
Putting it a little more bluntly
there are a lot of guys who groun
out three years of law school onl
to wind up selling insurance o
shoes. Some of this year's begin
ners might even wind up digging
ditch or two. As far as the law'
concerned there just isn't room fo
them.
A situation such as this makes fo
an exceedingly grave commentary
A door is slammed in the faces i
eager young men in this land <
miraculous opporunity. Tough
Yeah, that's it: tough. Better lut
next time—in some other field.

nal Law. To put it mildly, the boys
are a trifle apprehensive as re
gards their futures before the bar.
Out of a class of about 250 law
students there was but one "A" and
a handful of "B's." The rest net
ted what's usually left over. One
young man who got a you-know
what wanted to know if there's an
opening some place for a "good"
pogo-stick and yoyo salesman.
By dawn's early blush it would
look like there's nothing but lump
lumps in the class, which, to put it
mildly, is nothing but a base canard
and a lie to boot. Without knowing
one thing about it, we hereby go
on record as stating that this year's
neophytes are no dumber than their
illustrious predecessors.
The trouble lies elsewhere, and
the boys are getting co'd-shoul
dered by circumstances beyond
their control. The trouble seems
to be that there are just too many
lawyers around, and considering
the sizes of the first-year classes in
the various legal mills around here,
there's going to be a lot more. Or
rather, there WAS going to be a lot
more.

It seems that the Bar Assoeiatio
—which is the state legal licensin
agency — has adopted some hard
headed tactics to prevent a furthe
glut on the market. Last October'
bar examination dealt a rough an
rude blow both to the local lax
school and to the lads involved. 1
flunked about 10 of the Farm as
pirants.
Oh, you should have heard th
moaning, and the groaning, and th
weeping, and the waiiing. In th
first placc, it was a gross affront t
the Stanford Law School, and in th
second place it was far from funn
to the guys who had invested si
years of schooling only to be turne
down.
Putting it a little more bluntly
there are a lot of guys who groun
out three years of law school onl
to wind up selling insurance o
shoes. Some of this year's begin
ners might even wind up digging
ditch or two. As far as the law'
concerned there just isn't room fo
them.
A situation such as this makes fo
an exceedingly grave commentary
A door is slammed in the faces i
eager young men in this land <
miraculous opporunity. Tough
Yeah, that's it: tough. Better lut
next time—in some other field.
This week's long faces are being
worn by the first-year law students.
The boys just got their grades back
Irom last quarter's exams in Crimi
nal Law. To put it mildly, the boys
