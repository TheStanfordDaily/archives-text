## Third Person Responsibility 
### 
To the Editor:
Recently at a panel discussion concerning "Third-Person Responsibilit
with regard to Honor Code and Fundamental Standard," a member <>
Women's Council was reported as making statements to the effect the;
are holding women students responsible for reporting violations of Uni
versity rules not concerned with the Honor Code.
If this is true, Women's Council is acting in direct opposition to th<
official interpretation of the legislative body of the school. Last yea
(May 19. 1948) Excom ruled that third-person responsibility applies
in Honor Code cases and not with regard to Fundamental Standard.
It was felt to be extremely important lor the continued effectiveness e
the Honor Code (hat the entire student body understand this. Howevei
it is impossible to expect the student body to retain the correct impressio
of third-person responsibility when one of the judicial bodies is treatin
it incorrectly.
