# Why Rallies Are Not Held

To the Editor:
Attention, 13 Men from Village 306B:
Your unwarranted, but "well directed criticism and comment abou
the refusal or ignorance of Rally Com to make an effort to boost th
basketball team," seems to lack a necessary element'lor a success fu
scathing letter.
It is not, as you "aptly" say. because the members of the Rally Com
mittee are suffering from nervous breakdowns after the strain of footbal
season. The primary point is that Coach Dean has requested that n«
basketball rallies be held.
This was done in light of the poor showing at such events during th<
last three years. We have tried to comply with the wishes of the coacl!
but it seems that there will always be "fair weather" friends.
Last week, plans were underway for n bit* basketball rally. We ha<
eve n acquired an extra drawing card to insure a crowd Slim Gaillnr.
and his trio. Once again, however, Coach Dean requested that the rail;
be called oIT. We took his word, feeling that he knew what was best i'o
his team. Therefore, there will not be a basketball rally and the Rail;
Committee feels that it is justified in not having one.
It seems to me that if people would look into something before the
try to comment on it, a lot of arguments and misunderstandings woul<
never occur.
I appreciate your interest, but your criticism is neither fair nor wel
directed, and about 50 people who have spent a great amount of thei
extra time in planning such things as rallies, object to it.
