# Goodman Attempts Bop On Opera House Stage
## 
### ALLEN JOYCE 
Benny Goodman and his new band opened their San Francisco
engagements with a concert at the Opera House Wednesday
night. Ironically enough, Dizzy Gillespie finished his stand at
the Barbary Coast the same night.
Mr. Goodman is still playing the fine clarinet that made him

famous as the "king of swing" in (
the late 'thirties. He opened the '
concert with a few of the oldies that 1
established him: "Bugle Call Rag,"
"Sing, Sing, Sing," and "Rose Room."
Then, explaining that music had;
advanced along a new vein, he
donned a green beret and attempted 1
10 introduce Be-Bop. It takes more
than a beret and a new band to play j
be-bop, and Goodman proceeded to j
prove this with such numbers as j
"Slow Boat To China," "Gardasti" j
(it's a drag, spelled backwards), and
"Chico's Bop." These tunes may'
have other merits, but as played by j
Goodman they cannot be accepted ;
as bop. Mr. Goodman has a good i
swing' band, as he proved later in j
the evening, so lie must be excused
for his pseudo-be-bop.
Sextet Combo Tops
Perhaps the highlight of the con
cert came during the sextet num
bers. With the rhythm section, i
Goodman on clarinet, a trumpet, and
Wardell Grey on tenor sax, the sex
tet turned out a nice "Clarinet a la
King" and "Sweet Georgia Brown."
In addition to the sextet, Goodman
has beautiful blonde Terry Swope
who sings, a ballet team, and a
comedian.
Those of you fortunate enough to '

have tickets to Goodman's, dance
will hear a good dance band. He
will undoubtedly present a fine
show, but don't expect any be-bop.
Dizzy Does the Hopping
After the concert, a large part of
Goodman's band trotted on down to
the Barbary Coast where Dizzy Gil
lespie, the king of be-bop, was hold
ing forth. Dizzy has a great band,
plus vocalist John Hartman, bop
vocalist Joe Carol, and Sabu Mar
tinez on the bongo drums. To say
the least, the music and Dizzy were
mad, real mad. In such numbers
as "Things To Come," the fury and
subtleness of bop exploded. Good
manite Wardell Grey, sitting in with
the band, was featured on "'S Won
derful." It was.
During an intermission, one of
Dizzy's- boys waltzed up to a fellow
in Goodman s band. Leaning back
on his heels and laughing, he said,
"Man, you was playing SWING at
a concert!" Ob, one could go on
about the Diz and his boys all night.

will undoubtedly present a fine
show, but don't expect any be-bop.
Dizzy Does the Hopping
After the concert, a large part of
Goodman's band trotted on down to
the Barbary Coast where Dizzy Gil
lespie, the king of be-bop, was hold
ing forth. Dizzy has a great band,
plus vocalist John Hartman, bop
vocalist Joe Carol, and Sabu Mar
tinez on the bongo drums. To say
the least, the music and Dizzy were
mad, real mad. In such numbers
as "Things To Come," the fury and
subtleness of bop exploded. Good
manite Wardell Grey, sitting in with
the band, was featured on "'S Won
derful." It was.
During an intermission, one of
Dizzy's- boys waltzed up to a fellow
in Goodman s band. Leaning back
on his heels and laughing, he said,
"Man, you was playing SWING at
a concert!" Ob, one could go on
about the Diz and his boys all night.
Benny Goodman and his new band opened their San Francisco
engagements with a concert at the Opera House Wednesday
night. Ironically enough, Dizzy Gillespie finished his stand at
the Barbary Coast the same night.
Mr. Goodman is still playing the fine clarinet that made him

famous as the "king of swing" in (
the late 'thirties. He opened the '
concert with a few of the oldies that 1
established him: "Bugle Call Rag,"
"Sing, Sing, Sing," and "Rose Room."
Then, explaining that music had;
advanced along a new vein, he
donned a green beret and attempted 1
10 introduce Be-Bop. It takes more
than a beret and a new band to play j
be-bop, and Goodman proceeded to j
prove this with such numbers as j
"Slow Boat To China," "Gardasti" j
(it's a drag, spelled backwards), and
"Chico's Bop." These tunes may'
have other merits, but as played by j
Goodman they cannot be accepted ;
as bop. Mr. Goodman has a good i
swing' band, as he proved later in j
the evening, so lie must be excused
for his pseudo-be-bop.
Sextet Combo Tops
Perhaps the highlight of the con
cert came during the sextet num
bers. With the rhythm section, i
Goodman on clarinet, a trumpet, and
Wardell Grey on tenor sax, the sex
tet turned out a nice "Clarinet a la
King" and "Sweet Georgia Brown."
In addition to the sextet, Goodman
has beautiful blonde Terry Swope
who sings, a ballet team, and a
comedian.
Those of you fortunate enough to '

have tickets to Goodman's, dance
will hear a good dance band. He
will undoubtedly present a fine
show, but don't expect any be-bop.
