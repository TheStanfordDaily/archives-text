Bob Simon and Ron Fincbeug

Washington team, which usually
employs a zone defense. The latter
could hold down the fast break
which the frosh have used so effec

competition Saturday night when
they meet league - leading Fresno

by "Barking Joe" Kelly, cne of Sam
Barry's famed cage pupils, and are
currently burning up their league
with an impressive G-0 record.

Iverson, is in tip-top shape, so the
frosh could turn in their top per
