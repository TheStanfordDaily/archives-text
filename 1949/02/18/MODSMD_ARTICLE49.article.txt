# Stanford Nine Hosts Firemen Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's weather-plagued base
ballers, rained out on two succes
sive weekends, will once again try
to ring up the curtain on their 1949
season tomorrow afternoon at the
Sunken Diamond.
The hard - hitting San Francisco
Fire Department nine will be on
hand to furnish the opposition, and
weather permitting, action will get
under way promptly at 2:30.
Coach Harry Wolter has an
nounced that he will start his ace
southpaw, Dave Dahle, in the
opener, and Frank ''Penguin" Mc-
Graw will be behind the dish re
ceiving Dahle's portside slants.
Starting time will also find either of
Stanford's slugging footballers Ken
Rose or Jack Barnes on first, and
hard-working Ray Winterhalter will
open at the keystone sack.
Peppery Bill Arce will captain his
mates from third base, and he will
be backed up by Dave Melton in
the short patch.
Speedsters Bud Klein. Charlie
Cole, and Bob Nava are slated to
start in the outfield for the Indians.
