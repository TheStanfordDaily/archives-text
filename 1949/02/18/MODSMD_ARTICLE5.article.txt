# Denny Scores As Mordecai In One-Acts
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
Rani's Head launched its winter
quarter one-acts in orderly fashion
last nightâ€”one good, one fair, and
one poor.
"Mordecai's Will" was worth the
price of the entire bill. George
Denny turned in a wonderful per
formance as a cagey old practical
joker who has fun exposing his in
heritance-seeking relatives. George
Eckstein, who's a chip off the old
block, is very good as the gleeful
nephew.
The only serious drama on the
bill, "By Definition," gave a unique
setting to the Negro-white problem,
and was good enough to hold its
audience even in this era of non
demand for social reform plays.
Robert Brown as the embittered
young Negro, Jane Cannon, Sally
Cassell, and Ed Riessien as the old
man who's never without a diction
ary all give excellent performances.
A'len Fletcher, director of the
play, employed interesting shadow
effectjj and background din to offset
the sameness of the play's fore
ground.
As for "Expectin Trouble," the
most inspiring suggestion of the play
was uttered in its own last lines:
"Why don't you all go home?" Bet
ter than average performances were
handled by Mary Pat Sawyer as the ,
siren with a cold and Ann Guilbert ;
as the trouble accelerator.
Vic Palmieri was good, as was .
Thornton Lake, but both were the
victims of dropped cue lines. Le- ;
nore Rosenfeld would profit from
something to cure a bad case of
overacting, even while playing the
role of an actress.
