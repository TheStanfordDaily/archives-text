# Contagious Stanfordites Isolated in 'Pest Home'
## 
### JOAN HARZFELD 
The Isolation Hospital made its debut in the "Under the
Weather" column last Wednesday. Its appearance in the Dippy
brought forth several comments, such as: "Is this a joke?" or
"What the hell is the Isolation Hospital?"
Somewhat shamefacedly, we must admit that the "Pest Home"

lias been in existence for over 30
years. But it took a phone call from
Dr. George Houck, head of the
Farm Health Service, to bring into
print the name and temporary oc
cupants of the haven for measles
and mumps-bound Stanfordites.
If you take the road to Rossotti's,
cross "Dead Man's'' stone bridge,
and turn left on a little road over
a wooden bridge, you'll find yourself
entering the domain of the Isolation
Hospital. The building is brown
shingle, very impressive, and every
inch the austere keeper of communi
cable-disease patients.
Mrs. Margie Webb is the potentate
of the hospital. She keeps every
thing in order when no catching
diseases are prevalent on campus,
and she manages the place when it
is open to ailing students.
The Pest Home, formerly known
as Students' Guild Hospital from the
days when the students themselves
ran it. is an adjunct of the Palo Alto
Hospital. It is built on University
property, however, and is only open
to Stanford students.
The hospital is equipped to handle
28 cases, but in an emergency it
can take on 17 more, as it had to
do during the flu epidemic that

swept the campus during' the last
j year of the 'war.
There is an average ratio of two
nurses for every 10 or 11 students
j maintained.
Space is provided for both men
■ and women students. The women
| have the ground floor, while the
; men are placed on the upper floor.
There are four solariums which can
hold four beds each, three wards,
j and four private rooms.
The cost of running the Isolation
Hospital when it's in action (ac
tually. it's only a part-time insti
tution) is greater than provision of
j normal bedside care in a hospital,
i Costs are paid by part of the tuition
| from Stanford students, as is the
I Health Service which supervises the
! auxiliary hospital.
j As a parting shot. Mrs. Webb said
j she expected the measles epidemic
; to mount, and that in a few days
! there would be "standing room only"'
at the Pest Home.

The Isolation Hospital made its debut in the "Under the
Weather" column last Wednesday. Its appearance in the Dippy
brought forth several comments, such as: "Is this a joke?" or
"What the hell is the Isolation Hospital?"
Somewhat shamefacedly, we must admit that the "Pest Home"

lias been in existence for over 30
years. But it took a phone call from
Dr. George Houck, head of the
Farm Health Service, to bring into
print the name and temporary oc
cupants of the haven for measles
and mumps-bound Stanfordites.
If you take the road to Rossotti's,
cross "Dead Man's'' stone bridge,
and turn left on a little road over
a wooden bridge, you'll find yourself
entering the domain of the Isolation
Hospital. The building is brown
shingle, very impressive, and every
inch the austere keeper of communi
cable-disease patients.
Mrs. Margie Webb is the potentate
of the hospital. She keeps every
thing in order when no catching
diseases are prevalent on campus,
and she manages the place when it
is open to ailing students.
The Pest Home, formerly known
as Students' Guild Hospital from the
days when the students themselves
ran it. is an adjunct of the Palo Alto
Hospital. It is built on University
property, however, and is only open
to Stanford students.
The hospital is equipped to handle
28 cases, but in an emergency it
can take on 17 more, as it had to
do during the flu epidemic that

swept the campus during' the last
j year of the 'war.
There is an average ratio of two
nurses for every 10 or 11 students
j maintained.
Space is provided for both men
■ and women students. The women
| have the ground floor, while the
; men are placed on the upper floor.
There are four solariums which can
hold four beds each, three wards,
j and four private rooms.
The cost of running the Isolation
Hospital when it's in action (ac
tually. it's only a part-time insti
tution) is greater than provision of
j normal bedside care in a hospital,
i Costs are paid by part of the tuition

I Health Service which supervises the
! auxiliary hospital.
