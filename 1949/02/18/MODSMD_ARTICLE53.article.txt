# GI Allotment Change Eased
## 
### 
Plans for a "painless" mid-term
transition from federal to state edu
cational assistance for approximate
ly 500 veterans enrolled at Califor
nia colleges and universities this
spring were announced yesterday
by the State Department of Veter
ans' Affairs.
Students affected are those who
are eligible for state aid, but who
have been taking advantage first of
the more liberal subsistence allow
ances provided by the federal GI
Bill of Rights. Under newly devised
plans worked out with the colleges
and universities, these veterans will
start drawing on their state allot
ment as soon as their federal time
expires, with no interruption in
their studies.
Veterans who were born in or
entered service from California and
who served 90 days prior to Jan. 1,
1947, may be eligible for state edu
cational assistance. It consists of
payment of tuition fees, books and
supplies, and an allowance of $40 a
month, up to a maximum expendi
ture of $1,000 for any one veteran.
Information on the program is
available from county service offi
cers and community service center
directors, as well as from offices of
the Department of Veterans' Affairs
in Oakland, San Francisco, and San
Jose.
