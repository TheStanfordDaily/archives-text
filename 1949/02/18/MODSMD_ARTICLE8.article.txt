# Cards Seek Revenue in Cage Crucials
## Troy, Bruins, Top Loop Teams, Play in Contests This Weekend 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's slipping Indians, with their backs to the wall and
an ultimatum at hand, will face burly USC tonight in a last-ditch
chance to get back into the Dixie Division cage scamper.
Tipoff time is set for 8 p.m. in the Pavilion, with a preliminary
clash between Stanford Frosh and Washington High getting

* under way at 6:15.
Tomorow night Stanford will get
another stiff test when UCLA's sur
prising Bruins invade the Pavilion.
UCLA, tied with the Trojans for
the league lead (2-2), will play Cali
fornia tonight at Berkeley.
Having dropped three straight
contests, Stanford must come
through in both games. The Card
are only one game off the pace, and
wins would put them right back
into contention.
Thug Patrol First
USC's thug patrol, ably balanced
by the scientific Biil Sharman, will
be the tougher nut to crack. The
Trojans have run up six straight
victories over Stanford, the last be
ing the 54 to 44 romp in the Olym
pic Auditorium.
Bill Sharman, the smoothest work
ing forward in this part of the coun
try, is the main reason behind Troj
success so far this season. Sharmai
leads the Southern Division in scor
ing, with IOC) points for six games,
for an average of 16.8 per game.
Other cogs in the rugged Trojar
attack are the new guard, Bob Koli.
who hurt Stanford last week with
a second-half barrage of long-dis
tance field goals, and Stan Christie,
a big 6-3, 200-pound bruiser who
helps control both backboards.
Joe White, Marty Pelka, and Abe
Androff are other Trojans who might
gram the spotlight. Any one of the
trio is apt to get hot enough on a
given night to cause plenty of
trouble.
Back To Post
To stop USC, Stanford will try
going back to its early-season style,
that of hitting' Bill Stephenson at
the post and working most of its
plays ofT the pivot.
Speed and the fast break will also
be used more than usual tonight, as
the Deaninen realize it's their do-or
die game of the season, and are set
to produce different results from
those tacked up on the scoreboard
in the Southland last weekend.
Spending the past week in seclu
sion and rest, Everett Dean's start
ing five should be fresh and ready.
The doors to the Pavilion have been
shut tight all week, save for the
one workout Wednesday.
It'll be the same starting team as
usual, as Marv Gelber and George
Yardley open at forwards, Bill
Stephenson handles center and
Whip Lewis and Dave Davidson
start at guards.
Iverson Looks Good
If the practice session Wednesday
has any indication of what is to
come, speedsters Milt Iverson and
Gus Chavalas, and sharp-eyed Bill
Ro«e will be in the thick of things
early in the game.
Bill Rose, who is one of the dead
est shooters on the team, is finally
hitting his stride again. He looked
potent against USC, pitching in eight
points during his brief stay in the
contest, and should be getting more
of a chance this time out.
Sparkling Marv Gelber, improving
with every game, is becoming one
of the mainstays of the starting
team. Gelber is a hustler, good
floor man, and an accurate two
handed shooter. If light, he could
hurt the Trojans, as they do not
have a defense for his type of shoot
ing.
A good long shot game would hurt
USC more than any other offense.
Troy's game is purely backboard,
and the Barry boys crowd all five
men under the basket. So far, it
lias paid off against Stanford.
Itruins Gunning fur Eighth
UCLA's Bruins, if they get past
California tonight, will be out to
maintain their longest win streak in
history tomorrow night. Wooden's

Westwooders will be tiding to rack
up their eighth straight.
Away from their home floor, and
probably not as hot as when they
dumped Stanford by 11 points last
week, UCLA will find things more
difficult tomorrow night.
Led by tall Allan Sawyer, who
pumped in 20 points against the
Cards, the Bruins will undoubtedly
us* their crowding defense again.
Chuck Clutska, hindered by an
ailing back recently, will be back in
top shape for Stanford. He will be
aided by Carl Kraushaar, who out
jumped Yardley twice, and Ron
Pearson, and George Stanich.
Stanford's main hopes for victory
will be formed around the expected
return to form of the rested starters.
Everett Dean figures that the In
dians are still very much in the
race. ' A 7-5 won and lost record
should lie good enough to take the
Southern Division," stated the Stan
ford coach yesterday.
At any rate, it's going to be a hec
tic finish. The race is still wide
open with plenty of room for change.

Back To Post
To stop USC, Stanford will try
going back to its early-season style,
that of hitting' Bill Stephenson at
the post and working most of its
plays ofT the pivot.
Speed and the fast break will also
be used more than usual tonight, as
the Deaninen realize it's their do-or
die game of the season, and are set
to produce different results from
those tacked up on the scoreboard
in the Southland last weekend.
Spending the past week in seclu
sion and rest, Everett Dean's start
ing five should be fresh and ready.
The doors to the Pavilion have been
shut tight all week, save for the
one workout Wednesday.
It'll be the same starting team as
usual, as Marv Gelber and George
Yardley open at forwards, Bill
Stephenson handles center and
Whip Lewis and Dave Davidson
start at guards.
Iverson Looks Good
If the practice session Wednesday
has any indication of what is to
come, speedsters Milt Iverson and
Gus Chavalas, and sharp-eyed Bill
Ro«e will be in the thick of things
early in the game.
Bill Rose, who is one of the dead
est shooters on the team, is finally
hitting his stride again. He looked
potent against USC, pitching in eight
points during his brief stay in the
contest, and should be getting more
of a chance this time out.
Sparkling Marv Gelber, improving
with every game, is becoming one
of the mainstays of the starting
team. Gelber is a hustler, good
floor man, and an accurate two
handed shooter. If light, he could
hurt the Trojans, as they do not
have a defense for his type of shoot
ing.
A good long shot game would hurt
USC more than any other offense.
Troy's game is purely backboard,
and the Barry boys crowd all five
men under the basket. So far, it
lias paid off against Stanford.
Itruins Gunning fur Eighth
UCLA's Bruins, if they get past
California tonight, will be out to
maintain their longest win streak in
history tomorrow night. Wooden's

Westwooders will be tiding to rack
up their eighth straight.
Away from their home floor, and
probably not as hot as when they
dumped Stanford by 11 points last
week, UCLA will find things more
difficult tomorrow night.
Led by tall Allan Sawyer, who
pumped in 20 points against the
Cards, the Bruins will undoubtedly
us* their crowding defense again.
Chuck Clutska, hindered by an
ailing back recently, will be back in
top shape for Stanford. He will be
aided by Carl Kraushaar, who out
jumped Yardley twice, and Ron
Pearson, and George Stanich.
Stanford's main hopes for victory
will be formed around the expected
return to form of the rested starters.
Everett Dean figures that the In
dians are still very much in the
race. ' A 7-5 won and lost record
should lie good enough to take the
Southern Division," stated the Stan
ford coach yesterday.
At any rate, it's going to be a hec
tic finish. The race is still wide
open with plenty of room for change.
Stanford's slipping Indians, with their backs to the wall and
an ultimatum at hand, will face burly USC tonight in a last-ditch
chance to get back into the Dixie Division cage scamper.
Tipoff time is set for 8 p.m. in the Pavilion, with a preliminary

UCLA, tied with the Trojans for
the league lead (2-2), will play Cali

Having dropped three straight
contests, Stanford must come
through in both games. The Card
are only one game off the pace, and
wins would put them right back
into contention.
Thug Patrol First
USC's thug patrol, ably balanced
by the scientific Biil Sharman, will
be the tougher nut to crack. The
Trojans have run up six straight
victories over Stanford, the last be

Back To Post
To stop USC, Stanford will try
going back to its early-season style,
that of hitting' Bill Stephenson at
the post and working most of its
plays ofT the pivot.
Speed and the fast break will also
be used more than usual tonight, as
the Deaninen realize it's their do-or
die game of the season, and are set
to produce different results from
those tacked up on the scoreboard
in the Southland last weekend.
Spending the past week in seclu
sion and rest, Everett Dean's start
ing five should be fresh and ready.
The doors to the Pavilion have been
shut tight all week, save for the
one workout Wednesday.
It'll be the same starting team as
usual, as Marv Gelber and George
Yardley open at forwards, Bill
Stephenson handles center and
Whip Lewis and Dave Davidson
start at guards.
Iverson Looks Good
If the practice session Wednesday
has any indication of what is to
come, speedsters Milt Iverson and
Gus Chavalas, and sharp-eyed Bill
Ro«e will be in the thick of things
early in the game.
Bill Rose, who is one of the dead
est shooters on the team, is finally
hitting his stride again. He looked
potent against USC, pitching in eight
points during his brief stay in the
contest, and should be getting more
of a chance this time out.
Sparkling Marv Gelber, improving
with every game, is becoming one
of the mainstays of the starting
team. Gelber is a hustler, good
floor man, and an accurate two
handed shooter. If light, he could
hurt the Trojans, as they do not
have a defense for his type of shoot
ing.
A good long shot game would hurt
USC more than any other offense.
Troy's game is purely backboard,
and the Barry boys crowd all five
men under the basket. So far, it
lias paid off against Stanford.

UCLA's Bruins, if they get past
California tonight, will be out to
maintain their longest win streak in
history tomorrow night. Wooden's

Westwooders will be tiding to rack
up their eighth straight.
Away from their home floor, and
probably not as hot as when they
dumped Stanford by 11 points last
week, UCLA will find things more
difficult tomorrow night.
Led by tall Allan Sawyer, who
pumped in 20 points against the
Cards, the Bruins will undoubtedly
us* their crowding defense again.
Chuck Clutska, hindered by an
ailing back recently, will be back in
top shape for Stanford. He will be
aided by Carl Kraushaar, who out
jumped Yardley twice, and Ron
Pearson, and George Stanich.
Stanford's main hopes for victory
will be formed around the expected
return to form of the rested starters.
Everett Dean figures that the In
dians are still very much in the
race. ' A 7-5 won and lost record
should lie good enough to take the
Southern Division," stated the Stan
ford coach yesterday.
At any rate, it's going to be a hec
tic finish. The race is still wide
open with plenty of room for change.

Stanford's slipping Indians, with their backs to the wall and
an ultimatum at hand, will face burly USC tonight in a last-ditch
chance to get back into the Dixie Division cage scamper.
Tipoff time is set for 8 p.m. in the Pavilion, with a preliminary
clash between Stanford Frosh and Washington High getting

UCLA, tied with the Trojans for
the league lead (2-2), will play Cali

Having dropped three straight
contests, Stanford must come
through in both games. The Card
are only one game off the pace, and
wins would put them right back
into contention.
Thug Patrol First
USC's thug patrol, ably balanced
by the scientific Biil Sharman, will
be the tougher nut to crack. The
Trojans have run up six straight
victories over Stanford, the last be
