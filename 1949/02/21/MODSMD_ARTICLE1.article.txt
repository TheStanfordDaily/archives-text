# Cards Rubbed Out By Southern Cagers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford dropped its second double-header in a row to the bad
boys from the Southland last weekend in the Pavilion to lose all
hope in the Southern Division basketball race.
Friday night USC's Trojans, sparked by third-string center
Charles Adamson's 8 points in the closing moments, lasted to

edge the Cards, 58 to 57. *
Saturday night, UCLA's nasty
brats, coached by foul-tempered
John Wooden, outpunched the In
dians to a 10-round, 59 to 4G decision,
in a game that was much more in
doubt than the final score indicates.!
The twin losses, Stanford's fourth
and fifth straight, dropped the Tribe :
deep into third place in the di
vision standings with a 3-5 record.
UCLA and USC, both double victors i
during their stay in the Bay Area, j
maintained their co-leadership in
the Dixie loop with 6-2 records.
One More Crack
Stanford will get one more crack
at the Southland kingpins when the
Cards travel to Los Angeles next!
weekend. The Deanmen still have i
a slight mathematical chance of tie- j
ing for the crown, but judging from i
the past two weekends, every chance j
has already been by-passed.
Leading 3G to 31 at halftime |
against USC, the Cards went limp !
early in the second half, and be- j
fore they knew it, Stan Christie had
dunked 9 straight points to knot the
count at 4(j-46.
From there it was touch and go, I
as USC slowly edged into command. I
With USC's centers leading the way,!
Troy pulled into a 58 to 53 lead with j
five minutes left. Stanford again
closed the gap on some long-dis- |
tance flinging by Marv Gelber and j
Dave Davidson, but the clock ran
out with USC still a point to the
good.
Milt Ivcrson was awarded a free- ;
throw with 15 seconds remaining, j
but his shot hit the back rim and
bounded out. Iverson had been |
knocked out a few moments before (
after a collision with Marty Pelka. j
Davidson Carries Load
Dave Davidson, who tossed in 18
points, all at crucial spots, ranked
right alongside Troy's Bill Sharman '
as being the outstanding man on |
the floor. Both Sharman and David- !
son looke like sure bets for all
conference honors. |
Against UCLA, Stanford's fright
ened Cards completely reversed I
their tactics of the night before, as
they slowed the game down to a
standstill in an effort to halt the
Bruin fast break. But the West
wooders weren't bothered in the
slightest, and won by 13 points to
prove it.
What's Happened?
Twice before Stanford had beaten
the Bruins by mixing it up, but as
of late the Cards have gone into a
shell. The fear everybody, and have
rorgotten that they once had a po
tent offense of their own.
Stanford led, 12 to 5, at the be
ginning, but the slow, tired offense
seemed to carry over into the de
fense. and that's when UCLA began
to riddle the bucket with a high per
centage of shots.
The fanatics from Westwood,
;iumping around like crazy men,
yelling at the referees, throwing
punches under the backboards, and
noaning at everything that hap
pened, outran Stanford to pile up a
43 to 2f) landslide lead with 12 min
utes remaining.
At that point. Gus Chavalas and
Bill Rose were inserted into the line
up, and as Stanford returned to its
i.sual tempo, a definite change came
■nto the game. At once, the Cards
began to whittle down the Bruins'
]4-poirit lead.
Speed llclps Out
With Chavalas bringing the ball
.'•own court at full speed, Stanford
regained a spark that has been
missing for six games. Yardley,

; Davidson, and Stephenson started
working the boards, and Stanford
men actually started scrapping for
I possession of the ball.
Davidson and Stephenson came
( through with some beautiful buck
ets, Dave on fall-aways and Steve
; with his hooks, to narrow the margin
| to five points.
Had Stanford owned enough time
to keep at that pace, the Indians
i probably would have continued to
I close the gap. But time was running
: out. and in desperation the Cards
! started two-timing the man with the
ball, which left a Bruin wide open
| on every play.
UCLA made the most of its op
portunity and whipped in eight
i points in the closing minute to finish
the fight. But Stanford had looked
much better mixing things with
j UCLA. If there hadn't been such,
i a large margin to overcome, the
j final outcome might have been a
different story.
Percentages Tell Story
Both USC and UCLA had a tre
mendous percentage of field goals in
; their games in the Pavilion, USC
I crabbing 50 per cent Friday, and
the Bruins tanking 4G per cent Sat
; urday. All of which is tough to
beat anytime, but one cannot help
j feeling that the Cards allowed their
opponents to rack up such fancy
; figures by not making things rough
' on defense.

Both USC and UCLA had a tre
mendous percentage of field goals in
; their games in the Pavilion, USC
I crabbing 50 per cent Friday, and
the Bruins tanking 4G per cent Sat
; urday. All of which is tough to
beat anytime, but one cannot help
j feeling that the Cards allowed their
opponents to rack up such fancy
; figures by not making things rough
' on defense.
Stanford dropped its second double-header in a row to the bad
boys from the Southland last weekend in the Pavilion to lose all
hope in the Southern Division basketball race.
Friday night USC's Trojans, sparked by third-string center
Charles Adamson's 8 points in the closing moments, lasted to

edge the Cards, 58 to 57. *
Saturday night, UCLA's nasty
brats, coached by foul-tempered
John Wooden, outpunched the In
dians to a 10-round, 59 to 4G decision,
in a game that was much more in
doubt than the final score indicates.!
The twin losses, Stanford's fourth
and fifth straight, dropped the Tribe :
deep into third place in the di
vision standings with a 3-5 record.
UCLA and USC, both double victors i
during their stay in the Bay Area, j
maintained their co-leadership in
the Dixie loop with 6-2 records.

out with USC still a point to the
good.
Milt Ivcrson was awarded a free- ;
throw with 15 seconds remaining, j
but his shot hit the back rim and
bounded out. Iverson had been |
knocked out a few moments before (
after a collision with Marty Pelka. j
Davidson Carries Load
Dave Davidson, who tossed in 18
points, all at crucial spots, ranked
right alongside Troy's Bill Sharman '
as being the outstanding man on |
the floor. Both Sharman and David- !

conference honors. |
Against UCLA, Stanford's fright
ened Cards completely reversed I
their tactics of the night before, as
they slowed the game down to a
standstill in an effort to halt the
Bruin fast break. But the West
wooders weren't bothered in the
slightest, and won by 13 points to
prove it.
What's Happened?
Twice before Stanford had beaten
the Bruins by mixing it up, but as
of late the Cards have gone into a
shell. The fear everybody, and have
rorgotten that they once had a po
tent offense of their own.
Stanford led, 12 to 5, at the be
ginning, but the slow, tired offense
seemed to carry over into the de
fense. and that's when UCLA began
to riddle the bucket with a high per
centage of shots.
The fanatics from Westwood,
;iumping around like crazy men,
yelling at the referees, throwing
punches under the backboards, and
noaning at everything that hap
pened, outran Stanford to pile up a
43 to 2f) landslide lead with 12 min
utes remaining.
At that point. Gus Chavalas and
Bill Rose were inserted into the line
up, and as Stanford returned to its
i.sual tempo, a definite change came
■nto the game. At once, the Cards
began to whittle down the Bruins'
]4-poirit lead.
Speed llclps Out
With Chavalas bringing the ball
.'•own court at full speed, Stanford
regained a spark that has been
missing for six games. Yardley,

; Davidson, and Stephenson started
working the boards, and Stanford
men actually started scrapping for
I possession of the ball.
Davidson and Stephenson came
( through with some beautiful buck
ets, Dave on fall-aways and Steve
; with his hooks, to narrow the margin
| to five points.
Had Stanford owned enough time
to keep at that pace, the Indians
i probably would have continued to
I close the gap. But time was running
: out. and in desperation the Cards
! started two-timing the man with the
ball, which left a Bruin wide open
| on every play.
UCLA made the most of its op
portunity and whipped in eight
i points in the closing minute to finish
the fight. But Stanford had looked
much better mixing things with
j UCLA. If there hadn't been such,
i a large margin to overcome, the
j final outcome might have been a

Percentages Tell Story
Both USC and UCLA had a tre
mendous percentage of field goals in
; their games in the Pavilion, USC
I crabbing 50 per cent Friday, and
the Bruins tanking 4G per cent Sat
; urday. All of which is tough to
beat anytime, but one cannot help
j feeling that the Cards allowed their
opponents to rack up such fancy
; figures by not making things rough
' on defense.
Stanford dropped its second double-header in a row to the bad
boys from the Southland last weekend in the Pavilion to lose all
hope in the Southern Division basketball race.
Friday night USC's Trojans, sparked by third-string center
Charles Adamson's 8 points in the closing moments, lasted to

edge the Cards, 58 to 57. *
Saturday night, UCLA's nasty
brats, coached by foul-tempered
John Wooden, outpunched the In
dians to a 10-round, 59 to 4G decision,
in a game that was much more in
doubt than the final score indicates.!
The twin losses, Stanford's fourth
and fifth straight, dropped the Tribe :
deep into third place in the di
vision standings with a 3-5 record.
UCLA and USC, both double victors i

What's Happened?
Twice before Stanford had beaten
the Bruins by mixing it up, but as
of late the Cards have gone into a
shell. The fear everybody, and have
rorgotten that they once had a po
tent offense of their own.
Stanford led, 12 to 5, at the be
ginning, but the slow, tired offense
seemed to carry over into the de
fense. and that's when UCLA began
to riddle the bucket with a high per
centage of shots.
The fanatics from Westwood,
;iumping around like crazy men,
yelling at the referees, throwing
punches under the backboards, and
noaning at everything that hap
pened, outran Stanford to pile up a
43 to 2f) landslide lead with 12 min
utes remaining.

Bill Rose were inserted into the line
up, and as Stanford returned to its
i.sual tempo, a definite change came
■nto the game. At once, the Cards
began to whittle down the Bruins'
]4-poirit lead.
Speed llclps Out

.'•own court at full speed, Stanford
regained a spark that has been
missing for six games. Yardley,

; Davidson, and Stephenson started
working the boards, and Stanford
men actually started scrapping for
I possession of the ball.
Davidson and Stephenson came
( through with some beautiful buck
ets, Dave on fall-aways and Steve
; with his hooks, to narrow the margin
| to five points.
Had Stanford owned enough time
to keep at that pace, the Indians
i probably would have continued to
