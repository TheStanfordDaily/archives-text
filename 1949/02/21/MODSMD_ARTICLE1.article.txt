# Cards Rubbed Out By Southern Cagers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford dropped its second double-header in a row to the bad
boys from the Southland last weekend in the Pavilion to lose all
hope in the Southern Division basketball race.
Friday night USC's Trojans, sparked by third-string center
Charles Adamson's 8 points in the closing moments, lasted to

edge the Cards, 58 to 57. *
Saturday night, UCLA's nasty
brats, coached by foul-tempered
John Wooden, outpunched the In
dians to a 10-round, 59 to 4G decision,
in a game that was much more in
doubt than the final score indicates.!
The twin losses, Stanford's fourth
and fifth straight, dropped the Tribe :
deep into third place in the di
vision standings with a 3-5 record.
UCLA and USC, both double victors i
during their stay in the Bay Area, j
maintained their co-leadership in
the Dixie loop with 6-2 records.
One More Crack
Stanford will get one more crack
at the Southland kingpins when the
Cards travel to Los Angeles next!
weekend. The Deanmen still have i
a slight mathematical chance of tie- j
ing for the crown, but judging from i
the past two weekends, every chance j
has already been by-passed.
Leading 3G to 31 at halftime |
against USC, the Cards went limp !
early in the second half, and be- j

dunked 9 straight points to knot the
count at 4(j-46.
From there it was touch and go, I
as USC slowly edged into command. I
With USC's centers leading the way,!
Troy pulled into a 58 to 53 lead with j
five minutes left. Stanford again
closed the gap on some long-dis- |
tance flinging by Marv Gelber and j
Dave Davidson, but the clock ran
out with USC still a point to the
good.
Milt Ivcrson was awarded a free- ;
throw with 15 seconds remaining, j
but his shot hit the back rim and
bounded out. Iverson had been |
knocked out a few moments before (
after a collision with Marty Pelka. j
Davidson Carries Load
Dave Davidson, who tossed in 18
points, all at crucial spots, ranked
right alongside Troy's Bill Sharman '
as being the outstanding man on |
the floor. Both Sharman and David- !
son looke like sure bets for all
conference honors. |
Against UCLA, Stanford's fright
ened Cards completely reversed I
their tactics of the night before, as
they slowed the game down to a
standstill in an effort to halt the
