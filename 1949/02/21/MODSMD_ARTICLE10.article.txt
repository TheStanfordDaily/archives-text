# Chinese President Li Threatens To Oust 'Uncooperative' Premier
## 
### 
NANKING, Feb. 21 (/P).—Acting
President Li Tsung-jen flew to Can
ton yesterday to ask Premier Sun
Fo to return to Nanking and restore
Chinese government unity.
Li's associates said this was a
"final effort," acsting aside all per
sonal pride, and that if it failed Li
would approve direct action to oust
Sun as Premier—by force if neces
sary.
(It was not apparent how force
could be used if Sun chose to stay
in Canton, more than 700 miles
south of Li's Nanking seat of pow
er.)
With Li in Nanking. Sun and the
cabinet in Canton, and President
Chiang Kai - shek in questionable
retirement at Fenghwa, government
attempts to beg acceptable surren
der terms from the Communists
have bogged down in a mire of
cross purposes.
Li has been seeking to end the
three-year civil war at almost any
price. Sun has balked at still Com
munist demands, while Chiang has
been described as laying undercover
lines for a possible return to au
thority if peace efforts collapse.
Li's flight south, an action al
most unprecedented for the head of
state, was described by his asso
ciates as a last, bold stroke.


LI TSUNG-JEN, Acting President
of China, flew from Nanking to
confer with Premier Sun Fo.
