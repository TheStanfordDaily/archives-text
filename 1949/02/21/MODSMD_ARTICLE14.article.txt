# Norway to Participate In North Atlantic Pact
## 
### 
OSLO. Norway, Feb. 21(^T,>—Nor
way has decided to take the calcu
lated risk of participating in the
North Atlantic defense talks, de
spite Russian warnings.
Observers said yesterday it is only
a question of time before the Nor
wegians join the negotiations now
being conducted in Washington. The
decisive factor probably will be the
United States timetable.
Norway's position became clear
last night when the powerful Labor
Party gave the government the go
ahead signal to join the talks. Par
liamentary approval still must be
given, but that is expected some
time this week. All the parties in
Parliament except the small group

of Communists are strongly back
ing Foreign Minister Halvard M.
Lange's policy.
Lange has said repeatedly that
Norway is looking to the West be
cause it is no longer possible to pre
tend that the United Nations alone
is capable of securing peace. Nor
way's leaders believe a regional de
fense system may offer better pro
tection for small nations.
The Labor Party's action dashed
Swedish and Danish hopes for a
change in the Norwegian govern
ment's attitude toward the projected
North Atlantic Defense Alliance.
Up to the last minute, Norway's
neighbors had hoped to work out a
compromise between the Norwegian
stand for a Western security system
and the Swedish proposal for a neu
tral Scandinavian defense bloc. Such
a bloc would have been neutral in
form only, insofar as it would have
relied upon military supplies from
the Western democracies.
Norway decided, however, that
such a bloc would not offer full se
curity. Since talks conducted by the
three nations deadlocked over this
issue three weeks ago, concern has
been mounting in Scandinavia be
cause of the two warnings Russia
has given Norway against joining
the Atlantic pact talks.
