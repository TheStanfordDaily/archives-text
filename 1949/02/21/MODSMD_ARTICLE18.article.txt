# Health Service Sot Worried About Possibility of Epidemic
## 
### 
The smattering of measles cases throughout the campus is
not an epidemic —or even an outbreak as many students have
been thinking, said Dr. George Houck, head of Sanford's Health
Service.
Before the war, there were several such cases of measles every

spring. However, during the war the
,-ervice men who hadn't previously
succumbed to this childhood disease
caught it, and brought their im
munity with them to college.
With the return of normalcy and
more students fresh from high
school, came the return of measles—
both kinds, red and German. At
this time, German measles are more
prevalent on campus.
There are 10 measles patients in
the Isolation Hospital now. Affected
students started coming in Jan. 17,
according to Mrs. Margie Webb,
manager of the hospital.
Incubation period for measles is
14 days, and the disease is highly
contagious.
The Health Service applauds every
time a Stanford coed catches the
measles. It's not because they take
a satanic joy in seeing a feminine
face full of red splotches; there's
a sensible biological factor behind
their happiness. According to Dr.
Houck. if a woman has measles
during the first three months of
pregnancy, it is liable to adversely
affect her child.
Above all, Dr. Houck suggests
that no one be terribly worried be
cause 10 students out of 8.000 have
caught a not-too-serious childhood
disease. About the only bad effect
from measles, if properly cared for,
is non-attendance at lectures.
