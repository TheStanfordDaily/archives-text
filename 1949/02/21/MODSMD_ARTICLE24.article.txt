Any of you people taken Psych 51 lately? If so. you'll remember the
paragraph out of Ruch that explained how a patient was shocked out of
his mental illness after he had been assigned to a clumsy plumber. He
was drenched with cold water when a pipe broke. For those of you
that arc interested in further information on the case, I have some hitherto
unpublished letters from Sigmund Freud to his wife. I found them kicking
around my psychiatrist's lounge and felt that I should pass them on
to you.

Dearest Mama,
Life is becoming difficult for me these days. How I envy you your
peaceful life up there in the mountains with only the cat ad terra firma.
The sunsets must be beautiful. Here I see no sun. Only I listen to peo
ple's troubles. Sometimes I feel like maybe I am only a barkeep in a
rathskellar. Who knows, maybe I was happier in my innocence when I
was a wine-taster for the Kaiser under the old regime.
My despondency is caused by a patient of mine whom I cannot help.
When I started this psychoanalysis business I was exalted and felt that
I should add my bit to science. Now my shoulders weigh heavy with re
morse. Man, I think, was born to suffer. This patient came to me with
a twitching ear and a hop in his walk like maybe he was a pogo stick.
His case I diagnosed quickly, but of what good is a diagnosis when 1
can offer no remedy.
I consulted Jung and Adler, and, although it is opposed to my policy,
I wrote to that young upstart, Gregory Peck. It was to no avail. The
future of science hangs in the balance. However, there seems to be a
way out. I am going to apprentice the man to a clumsy plumber, and
pray to God that this will help. I fear for sciene if this fails.
I caress you,
SIGMUND
P. S. Keep the cat away from the goldfish. If I cannot afford sturgeon
for myself, why should the cat have fancy goldfish?

My Loving Wife,,
Well, Mama, success has fallen upon me. No longer are my nights
haunted with visions of lost science. My patient has recovered and the
scientific world breathes easily again. I did not mention for fear of
frightening you, but the Hollywood people threatened me with a suit if
1 let psychoanalysis collapse. Try to help humanity and the merchants
in America fall upon you. Such is the bourgeois world.
It seems that a water pipe broke and shocked my patient out of his
withdrawn state. I am sure now that science knows no bounds, the stars
are our limit. The plumber was at first indignant at the expense of having
a broken pipe, but we appeased him with the Legion of Merit award.
God knows, the man deserves it. Maybe I shall be home for a little vaca
tion soon.
I pour kisses upon you,
SIGMUND
P. S. Let the cat have the goldfish. The gods have scattered good
fortune upon us.
