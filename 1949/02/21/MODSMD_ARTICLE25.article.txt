## Religious Program Satire 
### 
To the Editor:
In reference to the Chaplain's new column, I must say that I do not
think him presumptuous at all. For too long there has been too much
prejudice against religion, so when Mr. Johnston says that there are good
religions and bad ones and that he is going to promote one of the good
ones, I know that he speaks wisely and well.
He proposes a student-created and -managed program under a Council
of Religious Activities, under the guidance (but not the direction) of him
self and Mr. Minto. This is a wonderful idea, one we have needed at
Stanford for a long time.
By faith, I am a Manichaean, so I can appreciate Mr. Johnston's re
marks on the wisdom of Mrs. Stanford's requests. Believing as all good
Manichaeans do that man was created in the image of the Devil to the
detriment of God, it is somewhat more than right—actually it is necessary
—that we live up to that little spark of light which is in us, and repress the
overbearing majority of the spirit of darkness.
I believe that with a little bit of organization and with the cooperation
of the executives of the University, we might put a program into effect
that would really "go places," as Mr. Johnston might say.
The program I propose (and I am sure Mr. Johnston will back me
in this) is as follows:
1. Strictly vegetarian diet in University dining halls.
2. Smoking and drinking of alcohol absolutely forbidden, whether on
or off campus.
The abolition of intercollegiate and intramural sports (which are
merely a substitute for sex experiences), to be replaced by periods of
prayer and fasting.
4. Regulations and curfews for the men similar to those imposed on the
women, with fewer privileges and shorter leaves, stricter punishments
(since we must presume that such correct laws will be broken naturally
by those who are completely possessed by the powers of darkness), and
the limitation of social affairs to three per year.
i>. Card playing, all forms of music, the theater, and movies are banned,
and dancing will be forgotten due to the abolition of music.
The above list nearly covers my plan for making the students at Stan
ford more worthy of the spark of God which is in them, and I know that
there are hundreds of my fellow students here on the campus who will
get behind such a program and push it with all their hearts.
One thing that I forgot to mention, and which I think is absolutely
necessary, is the extirpation of conversation. With such a Being as God
with Whom to be in communion, what need have we of such creatures
of the Devil (as every man and woman is) to talk to?
