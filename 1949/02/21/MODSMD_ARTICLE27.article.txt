# Living Costs Less in U.S. Than Europe

LONDON, Feb. 20 (/P) —A boiler
maker in Kansas City smacks home
a half-dozen rivets in two minutes.
It earns him a loaf of bread.
The black haired little Italian who
around to mend the furnace in a
Rome apartment works nearly half
an hour for his loaf. In London,
where government subsidies pay a
large part of bread cost, the boiler
maker has to work twice as long for
a loaf as his Kansas City counter
part.
Those items are a nutshell com
parison of the cost of living in Eu
rope and the United States.
The average American complain
ing about expenses can take comfort
from this fact: he works lewer hours
and gets a whale of a lot more for
his labor than most of the people
he's helping on this side of the At
lantic.
To find the facts about the cost
of living in the Western World, As
sociated Press staff men in 21 major
cities, including Washington and
Kansas City, investigated living con
ditions of typical families.
For comparative purposes, each
selected a bookkeeper, a ditchdigger
and a boilermaker, all married and
the fathers of two children. Be
cause money values in Europe's
patchwork of currencies mean little,
the cost of living was translated into
minutes and hours of work needed
to obtain life's necessities.
The AP men just went out to find
how typical families live.
They found that earning power in
terms of groceries approaches United
States standards in Oslo, Copen
hagen. and Stockholm—but other
ordinary items, especially clothes,
are considerably higher.
Madrid turned out to be the tough
est spot in Europe—worse even than
the "Iron Curtain" countries or bat
tered Germany.
In every country, most people are
worse off than before the war. Price
hikes have more than outstripped
wage gains, even in Britain where
economic controls have operated
more effiectively than in other na
tions.
