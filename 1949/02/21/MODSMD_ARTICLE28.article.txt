We luid always been under the
impression that campus theatrical
performances were produced under
the auspices of Ram's Head and af
filiates. But Saturday night we were
treated to the finest dramatic exhi
bition it has been our pleasure to
observe since Sir Laurence Olivier's
"Hamlet."
The scene was in the Stanford Pa
vilion, and the stars were the UCLA
basketball team. You could pluck
almost any name from the visitors'
roster and the guy could move in
and take over the Stanford Players.
It is our considered opinion that
the plot was a little weak—we could
stand a better ending, and a lot
more development in the local su
pernumeraries—but these shortcom
ings certainly did not deter Jumping
Johnny Woodin and the Ursine
Thespians from giving their all to
the assemblage.
And they certainly gave their all,
up to the final curtain. And we trust
that Hollywood will not overlook
the efforts of the Bruin Troupe in
their next appearance at Westwood
Village. The iat-headed moguls
could do worse than put the next
Uclan hoop casaba extravaganza on
celluloid.
But enough of this love-making;
leave us proceed to apply the lash
and the flail and cat-o'-nine-tails.
We arc sorely depressed to notice
that one of our favorite sports—the
same basketball—is rapidly being
overrun by the same brand of lousy
yaks that have in the past ruined
some other supposedly sportsman
like undertakings.
An aura of brutality seems to be
enveloping the world and nothing
seems able to avoid the contamina
tion of this filth. Blatant hypocrisy
and calculated cynicism coupled
with a complete disregard for the
rules have converted sportsmanlike
conduct during a game into some
thing closely akin to a purge by
Genghis Khan.
A nice, quite, rainy-day game for
middle-aged YMCAers as invented
by Dr. James Naismith back in the
90s started getting out of hand

about 10 years or so ago, and it
looks like it 11 get a lot worse in
the future and probably never any
better.
The damned thing is getting bru
tal, and we would favor a cessation
of the sport rather than see the
trend continued. Football, in the
early 1900s, suffered from the same
influence; and the thing that cured
football was the dropping of thy
sport by a lot of schools. They
played rugby or soccer or anything
else until football cleaned it own
house and then they returned to
the fold.
The 10-second rule and the de
velopment of the race-horse tech
nique converted basketball into a
grand commercialized success. And
with the great crowds came the cry
for "more blood!"' And following
the path of least resistance, bas
ketball has become a first cousin of
football, lacking only the pads.
Basketball today still has a very
formidable body of rules regarding
the contact aspects of the sport. But
along come some newspapers and
some coaches who insist that "for
the benefit of the spectators" the
whistle-tooting be played down.
It is easier for the coaches to lay
the blame for their own sins at the
door of the officials. We can't ac
tually claim they teach dirty bas
ketball—and their denials of that
premise are long, windy, and heart
rending—but they certainly are not
wasting any time teaching clean
basketball. (Mind now, this does
NOT apply to ALL coaches.)
Basketball is not designed as a
dirty sport, and yet the violations
are more flagrant than in the
avowedly contact sport such as foot
ball and company. Perhaps the pas
sage of the proposed four-fouls-and
out rule will alleviate the matter.
That, and a more rigid interpreta
tion of the rules by the officials (and
not the coaches or the spectators)
may produce some surcease from
recumbent bodies on the floor and
diminish the lynching moods of the
crowds.
We hope so.
