# Army Turning Volunteers Away
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (/P)—'The
Army, a few short months ago cry
ing for men and spending millions
preparing to handle them, is now
turning away volunteers and cutting
down its size.
The Selective Service System, mo
bilized last June to supply the Army
with as many as 30,000 men monthly,
is now drafting no one.
Why?
Go back to last spring, just before
Congress enacted the draft law and
authorized an Army manpower ceil
ing ol 837,000 men and officers plus
110,000 one-year volunteers. At that
time the Army was down to a post
war low of 500,000.
Military intelligence foresaw a
war possibility. Czechoslovakia had
just been taken over by a Russian
dominated government. Our Army
was dwindling. The re-enlistment
rate had fallen to a low point upon
the discharge of many soldiers who
had enlisted two years or more ear
lier to reap GI Bill benefits and
wanted no more Army.
President Truman and Congress
said we should act fast to get our
war fist cocked into position. The
draft, rather than universal military
training, was picked as the best way.
For one thing, it wanted to get
to the 700,000 mark fast and the draft
would naturally help. (Actually, it
only had money to support 700,000.
Congress, although it authorized
837.000, did not appropriate money
for that many).
There was another reason.
As early as October Army person
nel officials saw a possibility that
actual drafting might not be needed
to get full strength. But if they had
announced this just before the No
vember presidential election, it was
felt even the deaf would have hoard
cries of playing politics. Too, Army
officials were not yet confident that

voluntary enlistments would con
tinue high.
And there was this paradox. Just
one month after (he Draft Act was
passed President Truman told De
fense Secretary Forrestal that he
would recommend a budget ceiling
for the defense establishment of
$15,000,000,000 for the next 12
months starting next July 1.
This was less than Forrestal
wanted. The Army's share would
not support it at a strength near
the congressionally-authorized 837.-
000.
It wasn't until after the election
that Forrestal announced allocation

of the $15,000,000,000 among the three
services. The Army's cut will re
strict it to a total of G77.000 for the
next fiscal year—even less than its
present strength of about 700,000.
But last July, Mr. Truman set
his ceiling on defense spending, a
Republican Congress was at odds
with the administration. It approved
in principle an Air Force of 70
groups over the President's wishes.
It might have been expected to vote
money for a larger Army than the
President wanted.
And a Republican administration
might ask for an Army much nearer
the strength authorized in the Draft
Act than the President wanted.
So the Army played it safe. It
opened up four new training camps
to handle the expected flow of draf
tees. (Recently it closed up two of
them. Cost of opening and closing
was $3,500,000. But it would have
been ready tor a large expansion if
called upon. As it turned out. Presi
dent Truman came back to the White
House and the international situa
tion improved.
Today the Army has had to abolish
two-year enlistments and put a ceil
ing on the number of men who may
enlist for three, four, five, and six
year terms. Its reenlistment rate is
running high (more than 40 per
cent) and a proposed pay raise won't
discourage volunteers.
Army statisticians figure that at no
time during the war-time draft or
the present draft has the rate of
voluntary enlistments fallen below
the level needed to keep Army
strength at 677.000. During on"
seven-week period this winter 72.000
volunteers were counted off by re
cruiting offices as against 27.000 din -
ing the same period last winter,
when we had no draft law.
But if the voluntary enlistment
curve should suddenly plummet the
Army has the draft to fall back on.
