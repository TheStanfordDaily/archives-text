### 
There'll probably be a knock
-1 down, drag-out battle of the sex j
|at Women's Vocom Wednesday
I night. Three married women will j
assemble to give their bird's-eye !
j view of "Marriage and/or a Ca- i
' reer."
A former Daily editor, Mrs. Helen :
Dietz Pickering, will point up mar- j
, riage hand-in-hand with a career.
I Right now, Mrs. Dietz is helping put |
I her husband through school. She j
I is secretary to Dr. Chilton Bush of
j Stanford's School of Journalism.
Mother of four children, Mrs. '
| Richard E. Doyle still manages to j
! write stories for magazines. She will :
, be a strong booster for career and
marriage at Wednesday's discus
sion.
Marriage as a full-time career in j
[ itself will be upheld by Mrs. Rob- j
' ert Vickery of Berkeley. She now !
has a freshman daughter at Stan- ;
; ford.
Moderator for the careerin' and
! feudin' wives will be Mrs. Thomas
Carpenter of Palo Alto. Mrs. Car
j penter is on the YWCA Advisory
Board at Stanford.
Which will it be —marriage with
j a career or marriage with only a
j husband? That remains to be seen
