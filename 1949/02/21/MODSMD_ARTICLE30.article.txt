# Air Records Threatened
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (7P). â€”The avia
tion record books may get quite a
working-ovei this year.
The Navy would like to shoot at
the world speed mark of (570 miles
per hour held by the Air Force
F-BG, using its new F7U Cutlass, a
two-engine tailless fighter.
The Navy also is eyeing the inter
national helicopter speed record, 124
miles per hour, which the British
set last year in a gyrodyne.
The Air Force has given some
thought to the world record for dis
tance with refucling-in-flight. No
official mark has ever been set for
this.
It ha* cast an eye also at the 100-
kilomcter ((>2.1!>7 miles) closed
course record, held by a British
Vampire jet fighter at (>O5 mph.
Another blank line in the record
book is the 'round-the-world speed
record, never attempted under of
ficial rules.
All these marks are within reach
of American planes, but a record
attempt requires considerable prep
aration and expense.
