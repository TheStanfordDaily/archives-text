'The time has come, the walrus
said, to talk of many things: of
shoes and ships, ami swimming
yet, and other sordid things."
For a bri'ef, glorious instant we
are going to talk about victory.
And on the sports page when vic
tory is mentioned it is usually men
tioned in connection with swim
ming. So those of you who aren't
interested in either victory or
swimming, please stop now and
turn to J. Hali's sad B-Ball com
mentary.
This column started Friday, when
I walked into the swimming office
out by the pools. Swimming Coach
Tom Hayne was talking and his top
middle - distance man, Ralph Sala,
was listening. "Now this is the pace
you've got to keep the entire race.
No variance, the same speed each
lap. Got it?"
"But, coach, I'll probably pass out
half-way through the race, if I try
to keep that speed up."
"I'll Re Around . . ."
"If you pass out, OK." grinned
Hayne. "But you'd darn well bet
ter be pulling that pace when you
do. And don't worry; I'll be around
to fish you out.
Sala got up and went out of the
swimming office into the fog-cov
ered pool. "I'll see what I can do,"
he said at the door. He was still
pulling the same monotonous stroke
when I left Hayne's office a half
hour later.
That to rr.e—a newcomer to the
tank-life coverage—told a lot about
why Stanford is the top swimming
school in the nation. With guys like
Sala — and Hoogs and Hester and
Weeden, etc. — and a coach like
Hayne, victory comes naturally
when blended with a lot of hard
work. And it is that deadly three
some that is going to duck San Jose
Statesters tomorrow, when Stan
ford's terrible tanksters open an
other sunny season. The splashings
will be nocturnal and in the Spar
tans' home pool.
