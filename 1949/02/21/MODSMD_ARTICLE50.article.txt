## 
### 
One more scalp now hangs at
the belt of the Stanford wrestling
team as the Indians tomahawked a
hapless Santa Clara squad 30 to 7
in the Encina Gym Friday.
Santa Clara managed to win only
one varsity match during the fray
as Ray Misner gained a fall over his
Indian opponent in the first period
ot the 155-pound bout. On their
part the Cards gifabbed two falls, a
default, two forfeits, a decision, and
a draw tor their 30 points.
The best match of the afternoon
was supplied by the heavyweights
when Indian Steve Garst and Hock
wrestled to a draw. Po'.nts were
tied at 2 to 2 at the end of the
bout, and although Garst had 37
seconds top time the referee called
it a tie.
Vern Jones, Indian captain, gave
Bolton a thorough working over in
the 145 - pound tussle and pinned
the Bronco in the second period.
Jones was never pressed as he won
his seventh straight match this sea
son.
Following Jones' lead Bruce Gait
added to the Card total by throw
ing Rickenbacker in the first period
of the 165-pound match. Dick De-
Witt was well on the way to re
peating Gait's triumph when his op
ponent Fenart was injured in the
175-pound bout, and DeWitt won
by default.
Dick Esbenshade won the Indian
decision by a narrow 4 to 3 score
over Schultz in the 121. The match
was close all the way and Esben
shae'e won in the last period when
he gained a come-out for the mar
gin of victory.
In two exhibition matches the
Card team won one and lost one but
came out with a 5 to 3 advantage.
Bob Harmon supplied the Indians
five points by throwing Pritchard in
the third period of a 165 - pound
bout. Corvello scored for Santa

I Clara by decisioning Eollin Rose in
j a 145-pound tussle.
