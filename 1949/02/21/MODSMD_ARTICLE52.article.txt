# Highbrow, Lowbrow Musicians Argue Over Merits of Be-Bo

### JACK LITTLE 
To be-bop or not to be-fcop, that
is the question ... a question that
has elevated eyebrows and aroused
controversy among musicians, crit
ics, and music-lovers all over the
world. Now. with the erstwhile
King of Swing's scheduled appear
ance in the Pavilion, you hear peo
ple asking:
'•What is this 'bop' music that
Benny Goodman is supposed to be
playing? How do you tell 'bop
when you hear it?"
Well, first let's explain that be
bop is just another phase in the de
velopment of jazz music. It all
started with spirituals, then came
blues and Dixieland, swing, ■and
now progressive jazz and be-Cop.
Be-bop began in a little New
York musicians' rendezvous called
Minton's, when Thelonious Monk,
pianist, and John Birks Gillespie,

trumpeter, started experimenting
with chord structures and unortho
dox rhythmic patterns. Legend has
i it lhat bop was so named when Mr.
Gi'lespie, "Dizzy" Gillespie lo you,
was explaining how a typical bop
phrase should be accented:
"Play it like this," he said. "Be
i bop, be-bop."
And they've been playing it like
that ever since.
A lot of people have tried to put
be - bop down in words. Harry
| Thomas, a physics teacher at the
j University of Connecticut, explains
; it like this, in part:
'"Bop embodies, in its harmonic
structure, logical extensions of the
harmony formerly found in jazz.
For example, there is the ever
present Hatted fifth. It really isn't so
weird; it's the major 11th which is

usually left out of a straight 13th
chord."
That's what happens when you
try to write about bop; you wind
up snarled in a limbo of musical
terms and technicalities. Bop is a
new sound in music, and the best
way to get acquainted with a new
sound is to listen to it. It's played
by big bands and small bands alike,
even sung, and a lot of it has been
recorded.
Try listening lo Dizzy Gillespie's
"Emanon" or "Good Bait" or "Man
teca" on Victor records; Claude
Thornhill's "Anthropology" or
"Robin's Nest" on the Columbia la- i
bel; Woody Herman's "Four Brotli
ers" or "The Goof and I."
Notice the variety of rhythms
used, from the Afro-Cuban mix
tures to straight four-four time; the
j sharp explosions of multi - note
phrases with their sometimes abrupt

divergence from tempo and melt die
line; and the "unorthodox" phrasing
1 and harmony.
When you've listened to be-bop '
for aw bile, you'll see that it de
mands of the musicians a greater
technical mastery of their instru
ments than that demanded by ear
lier forms of jazz.
On the other hand, there's more
to be-bop than technical gymnastics
executed at break-neck tempo . . .
more than new sounds in harmony.
It's got to have" the same basic ele
| ment that has always distinguished
i good jazz from bad jazz . . . intense
! and sensitive emotional expression.
1 It's an easily recognized quality, once
! you become familiar with bop.
A lot of very bad be-bop is being
played because a lot of musicians
lack the sound musical background
required. But don't condemn bop

as a form of music on that sccoi ]
And remember that there's a lot ]
mutual respect between the b 1
sters and such composers as St ]
vinsky and Prokoffiev.
Saturday night you'll proba
be able to hear the bop inHue
in BG's new bitnd, but chances
it won't go beyond the "synthe
stage, with borrowed bop phn
liberally sprinkled throughout
arrangements. But you will h
some great dance music and 1
fine old brand of Goodman ,<w
