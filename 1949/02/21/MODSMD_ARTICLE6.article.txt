## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
As the bells on the clock tower
struck 1 a.m. Friday, the fog lifted
and re'.ealed a student bivouac area
flanking the fountain in Union
Court.
The attacking force of 29 men,
sleeping calmly in two tents and an
assortment of sleeping bags, were in
position on the Union Court lawn,
ready to swoop down on the re
maining Benny Goodman tickets,
which were to be sold there at i)
a.m.
Tom Eike and Rom Handel were
two of the first of the platoon in
line Thursday night when they en
tered their blue pup tent, courtesy
of John '"Wonka" Wentmore, at
11:30.
A list of the queued men was
made up about 1 a.m.
As dawn began to break through
the fog, th»> encampment enlarged
and at 5:30. TO people were lined
ur> to buy the day's quota of 140
tickets.
The first woman arrived at 5 a.m.

and copies of The Dippy, fresh off
the press, were distributed at 5:33.
As usual the Cellar did a rousing
business in coffee, reviving watch
ers who were shivering in the damp
| cold air.
One man in line was heard to
moan that six of the men in line so
early were not buying the tickets
for themselves. Wanting the novelty
| ot spending the night on the ground,
they were getting tickets for their
; friends.
Hank Rosin, chairman of the
dance which will be held Saturday
night, passed out numbers at 7:30
j a.m.
! Promptly at 9 the tickets went on
, sale, and a little while later 70 be
| draggled but triumphant students
started for home and bed clutching
! the much-coveted ducats—the re
! ward for their vigil.
Famous list words that night:
l "Anyone buying only one ticket?''
"Would you mind being quiet so I
t can sleep?" (This was remarked at
7 a.m.) "Where the hell's my belt?"
