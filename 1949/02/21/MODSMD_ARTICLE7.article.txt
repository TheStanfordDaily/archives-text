His childhood home was a station
in the pre-Civil War Underground
Railway. He was the son of poet
Nathaniel Parker Willis, who wa>
co-found in 184G of Town and Coun
try.
One of Willis' first jobs was sur
veying the Lake Superior region for
iron ore. This area now leads the
country in iron production. He also
was one of the first persons to climb
Mt. Rainier, Washington.
In 1881 Dr. Willis became geolo
gist for the Northern Transconti
nental Survey, and he was with the
United States Geological Survey
from ISS4 to 191l>, becoming chiei
geologist.
During his time with the Survey,
he made important discoveries con
cerning the structure of the Appa
lachian Mountains. In 1902, the Car
negie Institution of Washington sent
him to China to search for fossils

other resources in connection with
a settlement project by the Argen
tine government.
During his life, he made trips to
South America, the Philippines,
Japan. China, Africa, and many other
parts of the world. He was a prolific
writer, having written 3G books as

tific papers.
Dr. Willis' last book, Friendly
China, just finished, is in the proc

books are Mechanics of Appalachian
Study, Research in China, Living
Africa, Northern Patagonia, Earth
quakes in (he Holy Land, and A
Van qui in Patagonia.
Dr. Willis is popularly known as
the man who predicted the great
Santa Barbara earthquake in 1929,
but he later denied that he had any
thing to do with it, only being there
at the time.
Twelve years ago he predicted the
Golden Gate Bridge would fall if
deeper foundations were not laid.
His advice was taken. For years he
was the enemy of real estate agents
because of his predictions that Cali
fornia would continue to have earth
quakes due to its fault construction.
His house was a model of earth
quake prevention. He had protected
his valuable collection of antique
china by methods he worked out
for "earthquake proofing." His sug
gestions were the basis for most
earthquake clauses now found in
California building laws.
Dr. Willis was a member of many
scientific organizations, having been
president of the Seismological So
ciety of America and the Geological
Society of America.
He was the recipient of innumer

During his life, he made trips to
South America, the Philippines,
Japan. China, Africa, and many other
parts of the world. He was a prolific
writer, having written 3G books as

Dr. Willis' last book, Friendly

books are Mechanics of Appalachian

quakes in (he Holy Land, and A
Van qui in Patagonia.
Dr. Willis is popularly known as
the man who predicted the great
Santa Barbara earthquake in 1929,
but he later denied that he had any
thing to do with it, only being there
at the time.
Twelve years ago he predicted the
Golden Gate Bridge would fall if
deeper foundations were not laid.

was the enemy of real estate agents
because of his predictions that Cali

quakes due to its fault construction.
His house was a model of earth
quake prevention. He had protected
his valuable collection of antique
china by methods he worked out
for "earthquake proofing." His sug

Dr. Willis was a member of many
scientific organizations, having been
president of the Seismological So

His house was a model of earth
quake prevention. He had protected
his valuable collection of antique

earthquake clauses now found in
California building laws.
Dr. Willis was a member of many
