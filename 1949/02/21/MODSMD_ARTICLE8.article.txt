# Stern Hall Construction Will End by December
## 
### TOWNSEND BROWN 
Stern Hall will be completed by
December, John Levers, construc
tion director, said yesterday.
Levers reported that the building
is about 10 days behind schedule
because of bad weather which pre
vented the pouring of concrete. He
said that at least 100 men are cur
rently employed in building the
dormitory, and that he has had no
labor trouble as yet.
During his 26 years in California,
Levers supervised the building of
Toyon. Branner, the Hoover Li
brary, Cubberley Auditorium, the
Memorial Auditorium, and Crothers
Hall.
Stern Hall is designed to house
224 men in four separate living
units. Each unit will have its own
dining room, lounge, guest lounge,
and cafeteria. The residents will be
fed by a central kitchen.
Plans for Stern call for double
rooms with dimensions of 12 by lt»
feet. The new dormitory, when

I completed, will cost more than
j $1,000,000.
Still in the blueprint stage is a
I plan for building an identical dor
! mitory which will join Stern Hall
; at the kitchen.
"Reconverting the Administration
Building into the new Law School
has proved a real construction job,''
said John Beattie, Lever's assistant.
"Only the outer shell of the Law
i School will look like the old build
| ing"
Especially strong steel props have
i to be put in because a large central
part of the hall used to be a glass
domed lobby. Stacks will fill part
of the space, and a lecture room
! will take up the rest.
The whole project will cost as
j much as the Hoover Tower, about
three-quarters of a million dollars,
and it will be completed by next
i January.
Crothers Hall was completed last
November after a year's work and
at a cost of $400,000. It. too, was a
difficult construction job because a
; basement was authorized after the
| walls had been nearly finished.
Crothers has 3 single rooms for
• graduate law students. The only
i complaint about it is the lack of
! soundproofing between rooms,
i No other new buildings are au
thorized for the immediate future,
but plans have been drawn, and
new construction is waiting only for
an appropriation.
