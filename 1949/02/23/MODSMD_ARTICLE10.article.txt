# IIR Croup Wants Opinions on New Interim 'I" House
## 
### 
Is there a large number of Stan
lord students who would like to
live in a house with other students
from nations all over the world?
fhey may have this opportunity
next quarter at Stanford.
Realizing that the building of a
permanent international house on
a large scale will take several years
more, the"I" House committee is
asking ior campus opinion on the
establishment of an interim '"I"
House next quarter.
Students who would be interested
in living in the house or who have
any ideas and suggetions to offer as
to how it should function are asked
to send a post card offering their
suggestions to Olga Sender, Box 98(5,
campus, or to stop by the lIR ofiice
any afternoon between 3 and 5 and
talk with Miss Sonder.
The interim houses, one for men
and one for women, would probably
be established in rented buildings
in Palo Alto, according to Miss Son
der. Tentative plans state that each
building would house about 20 stu
dents, half of whom would be
Americans and half from other na
tions.
As the interim house would prob
ably be run on a co-operative basis
with each member of the group
contributing a small share of work,
it should provide very inexpensive
accommodations, according to Miss
Sonder. And the work being dis
tributed evenly among the residents
would make very little demands on
their individual time.
"An international house is an
ideal way to really get to know stu
dents from abroad," said Miss Son
der, who lived several months in a
similar residence in Switzerland.
"When you eat, study, and wash
dishes with a person you get to
know him very closely, better even
than in a regular dormitory.'"
