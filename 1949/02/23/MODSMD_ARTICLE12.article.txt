# Two Berlin Residents Write Thanks for Stanford Help
## 
### 
The grim outlook toward the new
year, 1949. was brightened for at
least two Berlin residents by the ef
forts of Stanford students. Students
here had overcome the first problem
in supplying food and clothing to
the needy families of Europe, that
of collecting and sending the items
to a particular European city.
In a letter to Stanford students,
sent in care of Bob von Pagenhardt.
Karl and Annelies Hohlfeld tell how
they overcame the second problem,
that of getting their package from
the distribution center after it had
reached Berlin.
"How glad we were, when we
found in the morning of Jan. Ist
your letter in our letter box! A

wonderful start in the new year!"
they begin the letter.
They then tell of their own troub
les in obtaining their package sen:
from Stanford:
'"In the last days the difficulties
here have grown up again. It is no:
allowed to bring food from the So
viet - Sector in the U.S. - Sector
Communistic policemen are con
trolling the border. And we had
order to receive your packet in the
Soviet-Sector! I think the ware
house of Cerita is there."
Karl exolains why they used the
subway to bring the package across
''So we deliberated how to get i:
here. I was the opinion Subway
is the right, because there is nc
light (no lamps) in the waggons
and there are on'.y minutes time in
the station for controlling and tht
next station (Guhaller Bahnhof) is
in the U.S.-Sector.'"
Even then they had trouble tak
ing their food past the Russian,
guard:
"So we did. When we came to
Potsdame Platz, the controlling
eastern policeman took away fooc.
and democratic newspapers. We
stood in the middle of the waggor.
so that they had no more much
time for getting my good things. S-:
I tried to start a discussion with
them. But they didn't want that..
So they tried it with violence. But
they were only three and there has
been so many people in the waggon
and no light, so that they could no:
even get out of the subway in time
and they had to drive with us ir.
the U.S.-Sector. You can imagine
how we thrashed them! It was won
derful!"
Their escapade and others like i:
have raised new problems, although,
they apparently do not worry much
about them:
"But now they don't allow the
train leaving till they are all to
gether, and they start controlling ir.
Unter den Linden. Never mind, I
got my parcel and I am very, very
glad!— Now two reasons are finish
ing the letter, no more place for
writing and the daylight is going to
end too. And so I send you my bes
wishes and my greatest thanks."

from Stanford:
'"In the last days the difficulties
here have grown up again. It is no:
allowed to bring food from the So

Communistic policemen are con

order to receive your packet in the
Soviet-Sector! I think the ware
house of Cerita is there."
Karl exolains why they used the
subway to bring the package across
''So we deliberated how to get i:
here. I was the opinion Subway

light (no lamps) in the waggons
and there are on'.y minutes time in
the station for controlling and tht
next station (Guhaller Bahnhof) is
in the U.S.-Sector.'"
Even then they had trouble tak

So they tried it with violence. But
they were only three and there has
been so many people in the waggon
and no light, so that they could no:
even get out of the subway in time

train leaving till they are all to
gether, and they start controlling ir.
Unter den Linden. Never mind, I
got my parcel and I am very, very
glad!— Now two reasons are finish
ing the letter, no more place for

wishes and my greatest thanks."
The grim outlook toward the new
year, 1949. was brightened for at
least two Berlin residents by the ef
forts of Stanford students. Students
here had overcome the first problem
in supplying food and clothing to
the needy families of Europe, that
of collecting and sending the items
to a particular European city.
In a letter to Stanford students,

Karl and Annelies Hohlfeld tell how
they overcame the second problem,
that of getting their package from
the distribution center after it had
