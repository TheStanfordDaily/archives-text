# Crew Rescues Injured Shell From Fate of Watery Grave
## 
### 
The wind was blowing, the Bay
vas rough, the oarsmen were inex
perienced—consequently, nine mem
bers of the Stanford crew went
swimming when their shell was
swamped yesterday morning.
The shell, named the "Washing
tonian." a present from the Univer
sity of Washington, was sunk last
year in approximately the same
place, and with many of the same
oarsmen.
The shell had been shipping water
for some time before the crew not
iced that it was in danger of swamp
ing. They pulled close to another
shell, which stood by in case trouble
should develop.
As the crew pulled for shore, the
water in the shell rushed back to
wards the stern, and this, combined
with the fact that a bulkhead was
missing, carried the stern under the
water.
A small motor-sail boat saw the
plight of the rowers, and came to

their aid. While the drenched crew
men were taken back to the Paly
Yacht Harbor, members of the other
shell emptied out the swamped boat,
sent a prize crew aboard, and
brought it back to the harbor.
The Washingtonian was unharmed
by the disaster, and quick work with
a couple of dry towels set the sur
vivors straight again.
