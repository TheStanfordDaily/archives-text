## A 						Good Investment

One of the most important stories to appear in The Daily
this quarter concerns today's report on the Board of Trustees'
approval of an additional $25,000 for University-financed schol
arships and grants-in-aid.
The action ends one chapter in Stanford history, but it also
begins another one.
Though the University was founded with the goal of offering
low-cost, high-quality education to young men and women in
any economic level in California, rising costs, increased enroll
ment, and a small endowment have forced tuition and living
costs higher in the last generation.
Twenty-five years ago students coasted through a year of
Stanford for eight or nine hundred dollars—tuition, board and
room, and modest personal expenses.
Nowadays, a sum of $1,200 covers tuition and board and
xoom costs, but it does not account for personal expenses.
I Just before the war, the pinch of an inadequate endowment
was beginning to affect the University budget. All student
expenses increased during and after the war, but the GI Bill has
prevented the cost of higher education from being prohibitive to
many students with limited savings.
Last spring, however, announcement of a $100 tuition in
crease had several effects on University personnel.
First, they realized that the additional cost would hit the
marginal non-veteran students hard—those students who already
were fighting high costs to remain in school.
Secondly, students attending Stanford under the GI Bill
would lose some of their entitlement in order to pay $100 more
tuition. Some of these students had just enough time left under
the GI Bill to complete their four years at Stanford at the lower
tuition cost.
Thirdly, and most important, the administration realized that
the cost of going to Stanford had reached such a high figure
that unless some aid was provided in the way of scholarships
and grants, Stanford would become a school representative only
of the higher economic classes. A few private schools, such
as Princeton and Exeter, escaped such a fate only by launching
ample scholarship programs.
A substantial scholarship and grants program in an expen
sive university will insure a representative and democratic group
cf students. We regard the Board's $25,000 appropriation as a
step in the right direction. Although the sum is small when
compared to present and future needs, it will nearly double pres
ent unrestricted, general University funds spent on scholarships
and financial grants to students.
