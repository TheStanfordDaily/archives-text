## Palo Alto Tag Day 
### 
To the Editor:
These appear to be "tag" days in Palo Alto. All the little "blue boys"
have their pencils sharpened, their eyes peeled and motors running. What
I mean to say is, I got "tagged" for speeding through an "obstructed
intersection."
The Cheerful Charlies said, "Just plead guilty and tell him it's your
first offense. You'll get off with a warning, etc., etc." So the judge re
cited his pretty little ditty, ending with, "What say you to the charge?"
i must have sayed him the wrong words, 'cause it came out 10 bucks.
And here it is only the 17th of the month.
When I walked into the courtroom, it looked like just another Stan
ford classroom (overcrowded, etc.). But then I realized there were a few
individuals who appeared to work for a living.
I got to wondering how much Stanford students contribute annually to
Palo Alto's budget. Could this be one of the indirect costs of education?
or an indirect form of taxation? So far this year, I've contributed $ 13.00;
and I consider myself a below average "careless" driver.
Maybe we could get the Board of Equalization to increase Paly's tax
rate? Or maybe we could have an annual, on-Campus "Help Our Paly"
<irive? Personally, I'd rather have my name appear on a donation stub
than on a traffic citation.

P. S. What is an "obstructed intersection?" I re-enacted the scene of
live crime but could find no overturned obstructions. Not even a knocked
over pedestrian.
