# Gorged Signature
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Upon investigation of the letter in the Feb. 14 Daily, yon might be
interested to learn that Bob Taylor of House 110. Village, was NOT the
author of the letter (Village Tray Service); but rather Frederick Chapin
of House 312-A, Village, so I am informed. Taylor has denied writing
the letter.
I think it is sad that Stanford students are now signing letters with
fictitious signatures. Only in this case it has backfired.
