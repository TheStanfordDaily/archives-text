# Pin-Up Gals Measure Up In Male Eyes
## 
### BOB LOEFFELBEIN 
j Let's face it, the pin-up girl is
j here to stay.
A petite gal named Mary Lou
i Gleason was chosen as the pin-up :
[ queen of 1!)47. It seems they base i
i this choice on the girl who has had j
: the most requests for pictures!
throughout the year. There must be i
j a reason.
Venus de Milo's bodily measure
ments were: height—s feet, four;
| bust—37 inches; waist—26 inches;
hips—3B inches. Mary Lou's tallies
up to height—s feet. 4 1 •»; bust—34;:
waist—24; hips—34. I'll still take j
Venus. But, then, even the latest j
Miss America misses the marks |
farther than that. Bebe Shopp. Miss j
Minnesota, is 5 feet, nine; weighs j
138, and has a 37-inch bust. She I
was only a photographer's daughter,
but, oh how she developed!
Miss America of 1944, first red
head ever to win the title, came
much closer to the vital statistics.
Height—s feet, 7; weight—l2s, bust j
—36 1 ,;>, waist—2s, hips—37 l i». Oddly
enough her name was Venus, too—
Venus Ramey. They say a beautiful I
woman can get away with murder.
That's why I never tell a gal she
! is beautiful.
Classic Figure
They say Gene Tierney has one
of Hollywood's most classic figures.;
Height—s feet, 5 1 :;; weight—lls;
bust—34, waist—24 1 / 2, hips—3s. Yet
! the publicity boys were putting out j
the stuff that Rita Hayworth, then
playing the Greek goddess, Terp
i sichore, in a current flick, had the j
same body measurements as Venus. 1
Actually, publicity was straining to
meet the demands. The beauteous i
Rita stands 5-6, has a 35 bust, a 25
i waist, and a 35 hip measurement.
In fact, among the 10 top stars you
won't find one measuring up. It just |
, isn't the style to be buxom today. I
j Yet you can't say there isn't dis
tinct beauty in every one of the 10—;
Veronica Lake, Ann Sheridan, Rita
Hayworth, Gene Tierney, Lana Tur
ner, Alexis Smith, Hedy Lamarr,
Carole Landis, Rosalind Russell, and
Brenda Marshall.
Of course, if you wanted to go
composite, you could get a pretty j
close picture of what Venus looked
like. Take the height of Lana Tur
ner, the bust of Carole Landis, the
waist of Rosalind Russell, and the j
hips of Alexis Smith .... and who
! says it wouldn't still look good!
Powers Model
On the other hand, John Powers
picks an ideal American girl with
the following traits: height 5 feet, 5;
bust—34, waist —24, hips—3s, shoe
size— .... and that is get
ting down to fine points. But he i
must know whereof he speaks be
i cause the statistics Earl Carroll gives
for his ideal girl match in duplicate
i except for an extra half-inch around j
the hips. Whic brings up another
point that isn't commonly known.;
The average woman's bosom today
measures 35' a inches .... of-course,
| that is taking some off some and !
i adding some to some, you under
stand.
And how do you stack up, young
lady?
Best beware of the boy who smiles
at you. He may be too polite to
laugh. Like the gal on the street
car, definitely on the plump side,
who was struggling nobly to get
out, but couldn't quite make it. The
harried bus driver suggested she
try it sideways. Says she, "But 1
ain't got no sideways."
Some of these large women look
like their mothers had been scared
by pouter pigeons. I danced with
one the other night who had a
bosom that was like satin and felt.
The there's the girl who went to
! a genealogist to have her family
tree looked up. and he traced a
couple limbs so far she had to slap
his face. It's the same old story all
over again of the lisping shoe sales
man who said, "Jutht a moment,
lady, I'll have to look up your thize."
"No, dear, I won't be home from
the office until late. I have a form
here I must work over."

lady?
Best beware of the boy who smiles
at you. He may be too polite to
laugh. Like the gal on the street
car, definitely on the plump side,
who was struggling nobly to get
out, but couldn't quite make it. The
harried bus driver suggested she
try it sideways. Says she, "But 1
ain't got no sideways."
Some of these large women look
like their mothers had been scared
by pouter pigeons. I danced with
one the other night who had a
bosom that was like satin and felt.
The there's the girl who went to
! a genealogist to have her family
tree looked up. and he traced a
couple limbs so far she had to slap
his face. It's the same old story all
over again of the lisping shoe sales
man who said, "Jutht a moment,
lady, I'll have to look up your thize."
"No, dear, I won't be home from
the office until late. I have a form
here I must work over."
j Let's face it, the pin-up girl is
j here to stay.
A petite gal named Mary Lou
i Gleason was chosen as the pin-up :
[ queen of 1!)47. It seems they base i
i this choice on the girl who has had j
: the most requests for pictures!
throughout the year. There must be i
j a reason.
Venus de Milo's bodily measure
ments were: height—s feet, four;
| bust—37 inches; waist—26 inches;
hips—3B inches. Mary Lou's tallies
up to height—s feet. 4 1 •»; bust—34;:
waist—24; hips—34. I'll still take j
Venus. But, then, even the latest j
Miss America misses the marks |
farther than that. Bebe Shopp. Miss j
Minnesota, is 5 feet, nine; weighs j
138, and has a 37-inch bust. She I
was only a photographer's daughter,
but, oh how she developed!
Miss America of 1944, first red
head ever to win the title, came
much closer to the vital statistics.
Height—s feet, 7; weight—l2s, bust j
—36 1 ,;>, waist—2s, hips—37 l i». Oddly
enough her name was Venus, too—
Venus Ramey. They say a beautiful I
woman can get away with murder.
That's why I never tell a gal she
! is beautiful.
Classic Figure
They say Gene Tierney has one
of Hollywood's most classic figures.;
Height—s feet, 5 1 :;; weight—lls;
bust—34, waist—24 1 / 2, hips—3s. Yet
! the publicity boys were putting out j
the stuff that Rita Hayworth, then
playing the Greek goddess, Terp
i sichore, in a current flick, had the j
same body measurements as Venus. 1
Actually, publicity was straining to
meet the demands. The beauteous i
Rita stands 5-6, has a 35 bust, a 25
i waist, and a 35 hip measurement.
In fact, among the 10 top stars you
won't find one measuring up. It just |
, isn't the style to be buxom today. I
j Yet you can't say there isn't dis
tinct beauty in every one of the 10—;
Veronica Lake, Ann Sheridan, Rita
Hayworth, Gene Tierney, Lana Tur
ner, Alexis Smith, Hedy Lamarr,
Carole Landis, Rosalind Russell, and
Brenda Marshall.
Of course, if you wanted to go
composite, you could get a pretty j
close picture of what Venus looked
like. Take the height of Lana Tur
ner, the bust of Carole Landis, the
waist of Rosalind Russell, and the j
hips of Alexis Smith .... and who
! says it wouldn't still look good!
Powers Model
On the other hand, John Powers
picks an ideal American girl with
the following traits: height 5 feet, 5;
bust—34, waist —24, hips—3s, shoe
size— .... and that is get
ting down to fine points. But he i
must know whereof he speaks be
i cause the statistics Earl Carroll gives
for his ideal girl match in duplicate
i except for an extra half-inch around j
the hips. Whic brings up another
point that isn't commonly known.;
The average woman's bosom today
measures 35' a inches .... of-course,
| that is taking some off some and !
i adding some to some, you under

composite, you could get a pretty j
close picture of what Venus looked
like. Take the height of Lana Tur
ner, the bust of Carole Landis, the
waist of Rosalind Russell, and the j
hips of Alexis Smith .... and who
! says it wouldn't still look good!
Powers Model
On the other hand, John Powers
picks an ideal American girl with
the following traits: height 5 feet, 5;
bust—34, waist —24, hips—3s, shoe
size— .... and that is get
ting down to fine points. But he i
must know whereof he speaks be
i cause the statistics Earl Carroll gives
for his ideal girl match in duplicate
i except for an extra half-inch around j
the hips. Whic brings up another
point that isn't commonly known.;
The average woman's bosom today
measures 35' a inches .... of-course,
| that is taking some off some and !
i adding some to some, you under
stand.
And how do you stack up, young
lady?
Best beware of the boy who smiles
at you. He may be too polite to
laugh. Like the gal on the street
car, definitely on the plump side,
who was struggling nobly to get
out, but couldn't quite make it. The
harried bus driver suggested she
try it sideways. Says she, "But 1
ain't got no sideways."
Some of these large women look
like their mothers had been scared
by pouter pigeons. I danced with
one the other night who had a
bosom that was like satin and felt.
The there's the girl who went to
! a genealogist to have her family
tree looked up. and he traced a
couple limbs so far she had to slap
his face. It's the same old story all
over again of the lisping shoe sales
man who said, "Jutht a moment,
lady, I'll have to look up your thize."
"No, dear, I won't be home from
the office until late. I have a form
here I must work over."
j Let's face it, the pin-up girl is
j here to stay.
A petite gal named Mary Lou
i Gleason was chosen as the pin-up :
[ queen of 1!)47. It seems they base i
i this choice on the girl who has had j
: the most requests for pictures!
throughout the year. There must be i
j a reason.
Venus de Milo's bodily measure
ments were: height—s feet, four;
| bust—37 inches; waist—26 inches;
hips—3B inches. Mary Lou's tallies
up to height—s feet. 4 1 •»; bust—34;:
waist—24; hips—34. I'll still take j
Venus. But, then, even the latest j
Miss America misses the marks |
farther than that. Bebe Shopp. Miss j
Minnesota, is 5 feet, nine; weighs j
138, and has a 37-inch bust. She I
was only a photographer's daughter,
but, oh how she developed!
Miss America of 1944, first red
head ever to win the title, came
much closer to the vital statistics.
Height—s feet, 7; weight—l2s, bust j
—36 1 ,;>, waist—2s, hips—37 l i». Oddly
enough her name was Venus, too—
Venus Ramey. They say a beautiful I
woman can get away with murder.
That's why I never tell a gal she
! is beautiful.
Classic Figure
They say Gene Tierney has one
of Hollywood's most classic figures.;
Height—s feet, 5 1 :;; weight—lls;
bust—34, waist—24 1 / 2, hips—3s. Yet
! the publicity boys were putting out j
the stuff that Rita Hayworth, then
playing the Greek goddess, Terp
i sichore, in a current flick, had the j
same body measurements as Venus. 1
Actually, publicity was straining to
meet the demands. The beauteous i
Rita stands 5-6, has a 35 bust, a 25
i waist, and a 35 hip measurement.
In fact, among the 10 top stars you
won't find one measuring up. It just |
, isn't the style to be buxom today. I
j Yet you can't say there isn't dis
tinct beauty in every one of the 10—;
Veronica Lake, Ann Sheridan, Rita
Hayworth, Gene Tierney, Lana Tur
ner, Alexis Smith, Hedy Lamarr,
Carole Landis, Rosalind Russell, and
Brenda Marshall.
