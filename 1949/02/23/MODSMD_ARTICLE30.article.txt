## Hem and Haw-Sons of Sin 
### 
To the Editor:
In his letter to The Daily, Monday, Mr. Wheeler evidently was attempt
ing to pour satirical scorn on the sincere efforts of Dr. Johnston to improve
the religious atmosphere on our campus. We could see nothing construc
tive in this distorted form of criticism, and therefore he left us nothing on
which to base a constructive reply. The necessity of a reply to the atti
tude behind this type of sniping criticism brings to mind the poem "Hem
smd Haw," by Bliss Carman:
Hem and Haw were the sons of sin,
_ Created to shally and shirk;
Hem Hay 'round and Haw looked on
While God did all the work.
Hem was a fogy, and Haw was a prig,
For both had the dull, dull mind;
And whenever they found a thing to do.
They yammered and went it blind.
Hem was the father of bigots and bores;
As the sands of the sea were they.
And Haw was the father of all the tribe
Who criticize today.
But God was an artist from the first,
And knew what he was about;
While over his shoulder sneered these two,
And advised him to rub it out.
They prophesied ruin ere man was made:
"Such folly must surely fail!"
And when he was done, "Do you think, my Lord,
He's better without a tail?"
And still in the honest working world,
With posture and hint and smirk.
These sons of the devil are standing by
While man does all the work.
They balk endeavor and baffle reform,
In the sacred name of law;
And over the quavering voice of Hem
Is the droning voice of Haw.
The best constructive suggestion we can make is that those who didn't
read Dr. Johnston's columns, get hold of the Dailies of the past two Fri
days and find out what Dr. Johnston really had to say.
