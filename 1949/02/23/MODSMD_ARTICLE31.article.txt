To the Editor:
The piping voice of the new Chaplain's column in The Daily, weak and
inoffensive as it is, nevertheless aroused a satiric protest in Monday's
Letters to the Editor.
The letter-writer apparently believed that there is no middle ground
between keeping Stanford irreligious and turning it into a Trappist monas
tery. He will probably win his argument with the Chaplain, because Mr.
Johnston is operating under a peculiar handicap.
The Stanford grant of endowment directs the Administration "to prohibit
sectarian instruction." In consequence, "sectarianism" has been barred
not only from the classrooms but also from the whole Stanford property.
We can have no church in Stanford-town but the established Stanford
Church.
A minister of any faith may preach here—if he confines himself to the
uncontroversial portion of the truths he believes. "Sectarian religious
01 ganizations" may meet on campus only under narrow restrictions. The
organized religions, like political parties and the beer trade, have been
kept rigidly in check.
Admittedly, the discouragement of sectarian religion is only partial. The
student previously accustomed to regard his church as a source of spiritual
strength is not compelled to satisfy himself with this meager diet of non
sectarianism; if he wants samething more he is free to leave the campus
to forage for it.
1 low true non-sectarianism might be reconciled with organized religion
is familiar to anyone who has seen, for example, a military chapel used
each week by Jews, Catholics, and diverse Protestants, each in their own
separate services.
It is unfortunate —for the Chaplain atid for the student body—that our
University, dedicated as it is to the free development of the human mind,
can admit religion to the campus only when it is filtered down to a nega
tive uniformity.
