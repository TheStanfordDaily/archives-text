# Interpretation Debated

To the Editor:
I am not usually provoked to writing letters to the editor, but Mr.
Wheeler's interpretation of the Chaplain's column doesn't strike me as an
intelligent one. Just because the Chaplain's approach doesn't appeal to
him, he goes off the deep end and makes much of the Chaplain's refer
ence to keeping "campus behavior consistent with (Mrs.) Stanford's Ideals "
Well. I don't think Mr. Wheeler's ideas are those the Council of Religions
Activities would care to enforce. Although the idea behind this council has
not been clearly formulated in anyone's mind, it seems to me that one
of its primary purposes would be. aside from developing our intellects
and bodies, covered amply by courses, to develop our spiritual selves.
This does not seem inappropriate for a university student as far as 1
am concerned. In contrast to other courses which we are forced to take
to obtain a decree, the latter development is left up to ourselves; the
least we can do for a start is to give the Chaplain a chance and listen
to what he has to say, not only in the brief column, but also at the scrvice,
before we prematurely misinterpret him.
It is unfortunate that all too often he has to address an audience of
P.:lo Alto citizens rather than a group of students at this service. It is
Hood to know that Stanford students in their actions towards the uni
versities of Europe, for example, have assumed a more realistic point of
view of the type of thing the council might do. in contrast to Mr. WheelerV
ideas. It would do him no harm to register next quarter for:
