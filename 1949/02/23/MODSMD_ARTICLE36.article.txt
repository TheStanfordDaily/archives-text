# Roughs Visit San Quentin By-the-Sea, Famous Resort Open the Year-round
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
Monday afternoon 43 Stanford
roughs visited what its employees
described as "one of the world's most
famous resorts â€” open the year
around." The visitors were invited
to make their reservations imme
diately.
But none of them did. The "re
sort" was "San Quentin by-the
sea," California's largest penal insti
tution.
The trip was undertaken by stu
dents in Political Science 2, in or
der that they might gain a better
understanding of tlie operation of
California's prison system.
Visitors 'Frisked'
The guard at the prison gates
warned the group that it was un
lawful to enter the institution with
pocket knives, cameras, liquor, nar
cotics, or benzedrine inhalers. When
questioned about the prohibition of
the inhalers, the guard explained
that visitors sell them to prisoners,
who dismantle them, remove the
benzedrine, brew it in some hot
water, and have a full-fledged jag
from the resulting concoction. Sev
eral guards have been dismissed
from the institution for selling the
inhalers to inmates for as much as
five or 10 dollars.
Before entering the prison, mem
bers of the group submitted to an
"inspectroscope" test. This device is
nothing more than a mechanical
"frisker." The person undergoing
the test faces a blank wall, and at
the instruction of the guards turns
to one side, then the other, and fin
ally to the rear. A voice is heard
over the loudspeaker describing

what the individual has on his per
son, even down to coins and cigar
ette lighters. The "inspectroscope"
makes it almost impossible for an
outsider to sneak even a hacksaw
blade in to one of the inmates.
San Quentin is a city in itself.
Founded in 1851, the institution has
j steadily grown until today it houses
about 4.800 inmates. Only a few of
the original buildings remain in use.
Training School
The institution has both a grade
school and a high school. Graduates
1 are awarded the same type of diplo
mas as graduates from night school
might receive.
The men are also able to gain
practical experience in manual arts
in the prison's manual training shops.
Every prisoner must have assur
ance of a job on the "outside" be
fore he is released from the insti
tution. During the depression, San
Quentin had a great deal of diffi
culty obtaining positions for prison
! ers eligible for release, but today
; there are only about 40 inmates for
! whom a job is the only barrier to
! freedom.
San Quentin receives all male
prisoners committed to the three
[ California penal institutions. After a
series of interviews with psychia
trists, religious counselors, and voca
tional experts, the more hardened
! criminals are assigned to the state
j prison at Folsom, and the "first
] timers'' are sent to Chino. Those in
' the intermediate group remain at
j San Quentin.
Warden Clinton 11. Duffy said that
only about 8 per cent of the men

released from San Quentin are re
turned to prison for new felonies.
A college education is no disquali
fication from a prison term. Al
though exact figures could not be
obtained, it was learned that there
are several Stanford graduates in
San Quentin at the present time.
The prison also houses a former
USC professor who is serving out
his time for what the guards de
scribed as "sex capers."
