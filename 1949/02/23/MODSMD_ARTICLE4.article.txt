# Herzog, Marcum Win Debate Meet
## 
### 
For the second consecutive year,
Stanford debaters have come home
from the Rocky Mountain Debate
Tournament with top speaking laur
els. Although the final team count
has not been tabulated, the two
Stanford men sewed up a sure rank
ing among the the first five schools,
by virtue of Art Herzog's second
place and Jack Marcum's third in
the individual tournament ratings.
Over 100 debaters entered the
three-day University of Denver
tournament, and the Stanford team
was competing against 26 other col
leges and universities.
Marcum was selected to give a
demonstration debate in one of the
opening sessions on Thursday and
Herzog earned one of the four first
ratings awarded in the after-dinner
speech competition. The four win
ners presented speeches for the
Thursday evening banquet, and they
discussed the general topic "Unity
Within Freedom."
As a team, the two Stanford men
won three ot their four debates, tak
ing one superlative rating and three
excellents. They took the negative
side of the Federal Aid to Educa
tion question on all four debates.
The two Stanford representatives
returned from the week-end compe
tition Saturday night.
