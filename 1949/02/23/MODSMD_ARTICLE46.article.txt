All too often do sportswriters go far afield in seach for ''good copy"
■ hen actually it exists right at home. Such is the case with a 19-year-old
Stanford coed who is one of the nation's top women swimmers.
A sophomore, blonde, blue-green-eyed Pat Geary narrowly missed
n,iking the Olympic team last summer when she finished fourth in pre-
Diympic trials. The three girls who heat her out made the team and Pat
,i.d only the consolation that the race, a 200-meter backstroke event,
vasn't her strongest event.
The attractive Lagunita miss has piled up records in junior competition
md has gone on to challenge the leaders in the senior division events
•vcn though her own specialty is racing in the three-mile rough water
'U'SS.
But Pat, who started swimming competition at the tender age of eight,
las learned the techniques of most of the strokes and can hold her own
vith the best. Since swimmers are limited to three events in most meets
ho has settled on the 200-meter backstroke, 300-meter individual medley,
nd 1500-meter freestyle classes.
Slices Aiming for the Nationals
Pat's next big tournament is the National Outdoor Women's which will
>robably be held in Hawaii. She will enter the three events mentioned
bove as well as some relay races.
Belore the Nationals, however, she will enter the Southern Pacific and
'acific Coast meets, both of which will be held in Los Angeles. Like so
i"any of the top swimmers from the Southland. Miss Geary is a member
l', and swims for, the Los Angeles Athletic Club. It is this organization
hat has sponsored her in the past.
A former Stanfordite, Brenda Helser, is Pat's teammate and the two of
hem were on the LAAC 800-meter freestyle team that won the Nationals
i San Digo last summer. Pat describes Helser as "one of the best swim
mers in the business."
Pat Likes the Long Raees
But it has been the slim Long Beach girl's fate to be matched against
>nn Curtis and Helser when she bids for National fame in her best "short"
vent, the 200-meter backstroke. Now that Curtis is turning professional,
le chances are that the sporting world will take increased notice of a
al named Geary.
It is not inconceivable that Pat might someday break some of Curtis'
-cords, made while Ann was an amateur. The phrase has a different
leaning when you say that Pat's "size is against her." Unlike most women
immers, particularly distance swimmers, Pat is somewhat slight of build,
he weighs but 120 and five feet five and a half inches tall.
Then again, Pat is but a youngster compared with the current record
oloers. While it is true that women swimmers start at an early age. at
) this Stanford soph has just started her assault on the record books.
Her Best Is Yet to Come
Already she has mastered the difficult "flip" turn; a turn similar to that
-ed by Bob Anderson. She placed third in the National Outdoor 300-
icter individual medley relay event and fourth in the mile. This was
gainst the best in the nation, too.
School work, of course, interferes with swimming and the sport must
■ke second place— at least for this quarter. As Pat says, "I'm just loafing
i training now but will start in earnest next quarter."
As it is. because the women's pool is closed, she practices several times
week in the men's pool. To do this she must be in the pool by 8:30 in
ic morning to get in an hour of work. After that the men take over
ain. Pat speaks very highly of Tom Haynie. Card swim coach, who has
;en lending a helping hand.
Come spring quarter and the reopening of the women's pool. Pat will
ke to noon practices in preparation for the summer meets.
As mentioned above. Pat likes the rough water or "pier to pier" events,
nese usually cover a three-mile course and are anything but an easy
'ent. This reporter is still amazed that a girl the size of Pat Geary can
. im three miles, let alone through rough water.
But. I guess it is live and learn week.
By the way, Pat doesn't confine her water sports to swimming alone. She
vns an 18-foot centerboard sloop which she has entered in some of the
oes held in the Southland.
So watch this young miss. We may be hearing about her come Nationals
ne in August.

bove as well as some relay races.
Belore the Nationals, however, she will enter the Southern Pacific and
'acific Coast meets, both of which will be held in Los Angeles. Like so
i"any of the top swimmers from the Southland. Miss Geary is a member
l', and swims for, the Los Angeles Athletic Club. It is this organization
hat has sponsored her in the past.
A former Stanfordite, Brenda Helser, is Pat's teammate and the two of
hem were on the LAAC 800-meter freestyle team that won the Nationals
i San Digo last summer. Pat describes Helser as "one of the best swim
mers in the business."
Pat Likes the Long Raees
But it has been the slim Long Beach girl's fate to be matched against
>nn Curtis and Helser when she bids for National fame in her best "short"
vent, the 200-meter backstroke. Now that Curtis is turning professional,
le chances are that the sporting world will take increased notice of a
al named Geary.
It is not inconceivable that Pat might someday break some of Curtis'
-cords, made while Ann was an amateur. The phrase has a different
leaning when you say that Pat's "size is against her." Unlike most women
immers, particularly distance swimmers, Pat is somewhat slight of build,
he weighs but 120 and five feet five and a half inches tall.
Then again, Pat is but a youngster compared with the current record
oloers. While it is true that women swimmers start at an early age. at
) this Stanford soph has just started her assault on the record books.
Her Best Is Yet to Come
Already she has mastered the difficult "flip" turn; a turn similar to that
-ed by Bob Anderson. She placed third in the National Outdoor 300-
icter individual medley relay event and fourth in the mile. This was
gainst the best in the nation, too.
School work, of course, interferes with swimming and the sport must
■ke second place— at least for this quarter. As Pat says, "I'm just loafing
i training now but will start in earnest next quarter."
As it is. because the women's pool is closed, she practices several times
week in the men's pool. To do this she must be in the pool by 8:30 in
ic morning to get in an hour of work. After that the men take over
ain. Pat speaks very highly of Tom Haynie. Card swim coach, who has
;en lending a helping hand.
Come spring quarter and the reopening of the women's pool. Pat will
ke to noon practices in preparation for the summer meets.
As mentioned above. Pat likes the rough water or "pier to pier" events,
nese usually cover a three-mile course and are anything but an easy
'ent. This reporter is still amazed that a girl the size of Pat Geary can
. im three miles, let alone through rough water.
But. I guess it is live and learn week.
By the way, Pat doesn't confine her water sports to swimming alone. She
vns an 18-foot centerboard sloop which she has entered in some of the
oes held in the Southland.
So watch this young miss. We may be hearing about her come Nationals
ne in August.
All too often do sportswriters go far afield in seach for ''good copy"
■ hen actually it exists right at home. Such is the case with a 19-year-old
Stanford coed who is one of the nation's top women swimmers.
A sophomore, blonde, blue-green-eyed Pat Geary narrowly missed
n,iking the Olympic team last summer when she finished fourth in pre-
Diympic trials. The three girls who heat her out made the team and Pat
,i.d only the consolation that the race, a 200-meter backstroke event,
vasn't her strongest event.
The attractive Lagunita miss has piled up records in junior competition
md has gone on to challenge the leaders in the senior division events
•vcn though her own specialty is racing in the three-mile rough water
'U'SS.
But Pat, who started swimming competition at the tender age of eight,
las learned the techniques of most of the strokes and can hold her own
vith the best. Since swimmers are limited to three events in most meets
ho has settled on the 200-meter backstroke, 300-meter individual medley,

he weighs but 120 and five feet five and a half inches tall.
Then again, Pat is but a youngster compared with the current record
oloers. While it is true that women swimmers start at an early age. at
) this Stanford soph has just started her assault on the record books.
Her Best Is Yet to Come
Already she has mastered the difficult "flip" turn; a turn similar to that
-ed by Bob Anderson. She placed third in the National Outdoor 300-
icter individual medley relay event and fourth in the mile. This was
gainst the best in the nation, too.
School work, of course, interferes with swimming and the sport must
■ke second place— at least for this quarter. As Pat says, "I'm just loafing
i training now but will start in earnest next quarter."
As it is. because the women's pool is closed, she practices several times
week in the men's pool. To do this she must be in the pool by 8:30 in
ic morning to get in an hour of work. After that the men take over
ain. Pat speaks very highly of Tom Haynie. Card swim coach, who has
;en lending a helping hand.
Come spring quarter and the reopening of the women's pool. Pat will
ke to noon practices in preparation for the summer meets.
As mentioned above. Pat likes the rough water or "pier to pier" events,
nese usually cover a three-mile course and are anything but an easy
'ent. This reporter is still amazed that a girl the size of Pat Geary can
. im three miles, let alone through rough water.
But. I guess it is live and learn week.
By the way, Pat doesn't confine her water sports to swimming alone. She
vns an 18-foot centerboard sloop which she has entered in some of the
oes held in the Southland.
So watch this young miss. We may be hearing about her come Nationals
ne in August.
