# Scholarship Fund Raised
## Trustees Budget Additional $25,000 
### 
Stanford University's Board of Trustees has budgeted an
additional 525,000 for the 1949-50 school year for scholarships
and grants-in-aid, Acting President Clarence H. Faust disclosed
yesterday.
The Board also approved the re-establishment of the Stu
dent Aid Commission as a subordinate committee of the Schol
j arship Committee. (Details on the commission appear elsewhere
| on this page.)
Appropriation of additional scholarship money by the Board
; of Trustees is designed to improve somewhat Stanford's insuf
ficient grants and scholarship funds. It is the beginning of a
larger program of grants-in-aid and scholarships.
Since 1946. the Board of Trustees has been setting aside a
portion of each student's tuition each year. This money will
serve as a scholarship fund against the time when the GI en
titlement is exhausted and harder times arrive.
Dean of Students Lawrence Kimpton in his report to the presi
i dent recommended the additional scholarship budget for two
| reasons:
1. The GI Bill is beginning to run out for many students, and,
at the same time, economic conditions are beginning to stiffen.
2. The Farm's administered scholarship funds have been far
below current needs. Moreover, they are much less than those
of other private American universities comparing in size with
Stanford.
As an example of the inadequacy of University-administered
! grants, fellowships, and scholarships, Dean Kimpton compared
: Stanford's funds with those of Yale and the University of Chi
cago:
j
1. The University of Chicago handles 5622,000 in scholarships.
2. Yale University administers 5599,431 in awards totaling
! 1,568 aids, scholarships, and fellowships.
3. Stanford directly administers awards totaling only
5142,749.
"We have been able during this year to make awards to about
one out of each 20 applicants at the freshman level, and one out
of each 15 applicants at the graduate level," Dean Kimpton added.
"Not all of these applicants were worthy of an award, of
| course, but by no means could all worthy students be given
awards. Among our already matriculated students, one out of
! three who made application for financial aid was given help."
The Dean placed the greatest needs in the area of scholar
ships at the freshman, graduate, and professional school levels
i as a supplement to the GI Bill.
"We also need more grant-in-aid funds for the young man
or woman who is just short of being able financially to make it,"
Kimpton added in his report to the president.
University funds alloted for 1949-50 before the additional
I $25,000 was approved included:

Scholarships 113 521,867

Endowed 17 512,000

Total University-administered

The Board of Trustees' action in budgeting an additional
525,000 to University-administered scholarship funds raises next
year's total to 5167,000, of which 556,927 consists of University
money.
A tentative breakdown of the use of the 525,000 sum is 515,000
for scholarships ar.d 510,000 for grants-in-aid.
Exact division of the money, however, will not be known
until later this year when definite student needs are determined.
On the ASSU side of the scholarship picture, $4,000 has been
appropriated by Excom for grants and scholarships for next
year. In addition, there still remains 52,100 from a 55,000 ASSU
i appropriation passed by Excom last spring. This money will be
combined into the general University scholarship-student aid
i budget.
