# Card Boxers Host Bears on Friday; Mitchell to Fight Heavyweight Bout
## 
### 
Emery Mitchell, the balding Eu
reka dynamo, is in top fighting con
dition and will definitely box the
heavyweight headliner against Cal
at the Pavilion Friday night.
That good news for the Farm
fight faithful was disclosed yesterday
by Boxing Coach Ray Lunny after
Mitch had gone three fast rounds
witli light-heavyweight Jim Ham
mond in a morning workout. On
lookers at the sparring session were
thoroughly convinced, along with
the dapper Card coach, that Maulin'
Mitch is fast approaching the form
that led Lunny to pronounce him
the top collegiate heavyweight on
the coast last year.
Lunny also announced that Fred
Apostoli. the fighting bellhop who
held the middleweight champion
ship of the world a few years back,
will be on hand Friday as one of
the judges of the sterling eight-bout
card and will be introduced to the
crowd during the pre-fight ceremo
nies at the Pavilion.
Apostoli to Judi*e
Apostoli is still active in profes
sional circles and only a few months
ago was scheduled to have met
Bad-Boy Rocky Graziano in Oak
land. only to have the Rock skip
out of the state a few days before
the fight.
The two feature attractions of the
evening will pit Stanford's dyna
mite duo of Mitchell and Hammond
against the Bears' John Groff and
John Emerson, respectively. May
hem should be the order of the day
when these two top Indian slug
gers unleash their explosive mittens
againt Berkeley's best.
The Cards' classy 165 - pounder,
Fred Ten Eyck, will be out for a
repeat performance against Cal's
Jack Lamke. who last year went to
the semi-finals of the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate tourney. Fred de
feated Lamke during the regular
season in 1948 but was unable to
enter the All-Coast meet, since it
fell during final exams. Both lads
expect to enter this year, however,
and Friday night's winner might
easily cop the role of favorite for
the 1949 163-pound Pacific Coast
crown.
Willie Altus, a slick 155-y:ounder
who has taken the headlines away
from the bigger boys many times
during his three years' varsity bat
tling. will be back after a two-week
layoff to scrap the Bears' Hank
Harvey. Willie's bouts have always
been crowd-p!easers, and his tiff
with the rugged Harvey should fol
low the established pattern.
Sophomore A 1 Anderson, the cut
eye he received in his last outing
against San Francisco State now
completely healed, will be socking
from his usual 143 - pound post
against either Doug Keith or Ed

Fan-is. Keith is a slugger and Far
j l'is a fancy-dan boxer, but Andy
has proven himself equally capable
! of going against either style in his
i first year of punching for Ray.
Another veteran of the Stanford
ring crew, Jay Savage, will lead the
Card lightweight corps into action
against the invading Golden Bears.
Savage will fight in the number
one spot against Ed Griffin, while
Max Money will hold down the
number two position against Rod
Doerr.
As usual, slim Bob Baker will
' touch off the evening's fireworks in
I the 130 - pound opener, this time
| against either Jim Handel or John
Parha m.
Lightweight Jose Rael and light
heavy Joni Vatcher will not com
! pete against the Bears this week but
will see action when the same two

teams square off at Berkeley Marc'.i.

| weight Mike Pelsinger, victim of :j
| broken nose in the UCLA match,
j may also be ready to t,o at Berke
; ley.

the semi-finals of the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate tourney. Fred de
feated Lamke during the regular
season in 1948 but was unable to
enter the All-Coast meet, since it
fell during final exams. Both lads
expect to enter this year, however,
and Friday night's winner might
easily cop the role of favorite for
the 1949 163-pound Pacific Coast
crown.
Willie Altus, a slick 155-y:ounder
who has taken the headlines away
from the bigger boys many times
during his three years' varsity bat
tling. will be back after a two-week
layoff to scrap the Bears' Hank
Harvey. Willie's bouts have always
been crowd-p!easers, and his tiff
with the rugged Harvey should fol
low the established pattern.
Sophomore A 1 Anderson, the cut
eye he received in his last outing
against San Francisco State now
completely healed, will be socking
from his usual 143 - pound post
against either Doug Keith or Ed

Fan-is. Keith is a slugger and Far
j l'is a fancy-dan boxer, but Andy
has proven himself equally capable
! of going against either style in his
i first year of punching for Ray.
Another veteran of the Stanford
ring crew, Jay Savage, will lead the
Card lightweight corps into action
against the invading Golden Bears.
Savage will fight in the number
one spot against Ed Griffin, while
Max Money will hold down the
number two position against Rod
Doerr.
As usual, slim Bob Baker will
' touch off the evening's fireworks in
I the 130 - pound opener, this time
| against either Jim Handel or John
Parha m.
Lightweight Jose Rael and light
heavy Joni Vatcher will not com
! pete against the Bears this week but
will see action when the same two

teams square off at Berkeley Marc'.i.
4 Lunny also disclosed that heavy
| weight Mike Pelsinger, victim of :j
| broken nose in the UCLA match,
j may also be ready to t,o at Berke
; ley.
Emery Mitchell, the balding Eu
reka dynamo, is in top fighting con
dition and will definitely box the
heavyweight headliner against Cal
at the Pavilion Friday night.
That good news for the Farm
fight faithful was disclosed yesterday
by Boxing Coach Ray Lunny after
Mitch had gone three fast rounds
witli light-heavyweight Jim Ham
mond in a morning workout. On
lookers at the sparring session were
thoroughly convinced, along with
the dapper Card coach, that Maulin'
Mitch is fast approaching the form
that led Lunny to pronounce him
the top collegiate heavyweight on
the coast last year.
Lunny also announced that Fred
Apostoli. the fighting bellhop who
held the middleweight champion
ship of the world a few years back,
will be on hand Friday as one of
the judges of the sterling eight-bout
card and will be introduced to the
crowd during the pre-fight ceremo
nies at the Pavilion.
Apostoli to Judi*e
Apostoli is still active in profes
sional circles and only a few months
ago was scheduled to have met
Bad-Boy Rocky Graziano in Oak
land. only to have the Rock skip
out of the state a few days before
the fight.
The two feature attractions of the
evening will pit Stanford's dyna
mite duo of Mitchell and Hammond
against the Bears' John Groff and
John Emerson, respectively. May
hem should be the order of the day
when these two top Indian slug
gers unleash their explosive mittens
againt Berkeley's best.
The Cards' classy 165 - pounder,
Fred Ten Eyck, will be out for a
repeat performance against Cal's
Jack Lamke. who last year went to
