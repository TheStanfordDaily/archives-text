# Students Want Communist Professor Given Job Here
## 
### 
A spontaneous gathering of stu- [
dents met yesterday to plan how to j
secure an appointment for Profes- j
soi Herbert J. Phillips to speak on |
campus. Phillips was recently boot
ed from the University of Washing- j
ton as an avowed Communist.
Today a committee will speak to !
Dean Lawrence A. Kimpton as a '

first step in scheduling the profes
sor's appearance to speak in his
own defense. The committee is tak
ing over the reins the Young Pro
gressives held in promising Phil
lips an appointment.
'112 he Young Progressives preferred
that an unbiased group of students,
interested solely in academic free
dom, take over their work.
Most of the group met out of cu
riosity when they saw the posters
removed that had announced Phil
lips would speak in Palo Alto.
Stanford policy is to permit no
political speeches on campus unless
both sides are given.
