# Pool Breaks Ankle, Receives Bid Offer
## 
### 
A new twist developed this
week on the Benny Goodman
dance.
Dining the holiday weekend,
ASSU Business Manager John
Pool broke his ankle while "try
ing" to ski. Normally such an
event would not draw too much
attention except from his friends.
But the "news" of the story de
veloped while Pool was being
loaded onto a stretcher by mem
bers of the Yosemite ski patrol.
Alfie Heller, another Farm stu
dent, dashed over to the stretcher
and asked:
"John, would you be interested
in selling your ticket to the Benny
Goodman dance?"
Reporters were unable to re
cord Pool's reply.
