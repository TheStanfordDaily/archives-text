# Sequoia Theater Bill Falls Flat: Humor Is Very Poor
## 
### AL. BERRY 
The Sequoia Theater, in Redwco
City, has billed a couple of pictures
that are strictly for laughs: "Eveiv
Girl Should Be Married" and "S
This Is New York." Both picture?
pretend to be tunny, and neither
succeeds very well. Both pictures,
laid end to end, do manage to kil
a lot of time—about three and ;•
quarter hours—but accomplish littl.
more than a few unhealthy belly
laughs.
"New York" is the better of the
two flicks, and features Henry Mor
gan in his first screen triumph.
Morgan at his best, on the radio, i?
magnificent. Morgan at his best, or
the screen, would probably be like
wise. Unfortunately, for the au
dience and the pic, Morgan is no ?
allowed to excel enough in this
boiled-up version of Ring Lard
ner's great story "The Big City."
The plot deals with a "hick" front
South Bend, Indiana, who is drag
ged to the Manhattan metropolis to
watch his wife (Nan Grey) spent
her inheritance while seeking a
"worthy" (i.e., rich) husband for
her lovely-legged, half-witted sis
ter (Dona Drake). When Morgan
gets a chance to make with the
yuks, the picture is delightful. But
on the whole, it is much too long,
and the audience starts looking at
the design of the theater's interior
The other one — "Every Girl
Should Be Married" — is Cary
Grant's worst effort to date. This
isn't Grant's fault; he's tops when
ever he gets on the screen. He isn't
on very much—at least not enough
for the patrons who get very tired
of watching "every girl" trying to
lure him out of a happy bachelor
hood. The picture is well - made
enough to keep the audience think
ing that it will get better, and just
funny enough to keep the audience
—not rolling in the aisles—fidgeting
in their seats.
