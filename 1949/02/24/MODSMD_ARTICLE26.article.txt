## Attack Object Mistaken 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to the letter ( which appeared in The Daily on Feb. 21 propa
gating the "Manichaean heresy," I think that Mr. Wheeler has mistaken
the object of his attack.
The efforts of a sincere and able man like Mr. Johnston to establish a
program of religious guidance for those students who need or desire it
(fortunately there are still a few of them at Stanford) are certainly no
grounds for ridicule. There are students in this University who hold a
religious faith and who participate in church activities. They would like
1o see on campus more opportunities for expression of their interest. They
feel that there has prevailed too long a slack attitude of neglect toward
tne spiritual.
If Mr. Wheeler and his cohorts of sarcastic indifference choose to remain
xJoof from such a movement, this is their business. But they should have
the decency to refrain from discourtesy toward our new chaplain and scorn
toward what many of our student body consider a worthwhile endeavor.
