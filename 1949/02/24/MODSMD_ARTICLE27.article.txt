# Pious Mouthings and Poetry

To the Editor:
As is too frequently the case, the defense of religious activity inspires
little more respect than does the ridicule of such activity. However little
one may think of the ill-informed satire on religious activity at Stanford
which appeared in Monday's Daily, one can hardly think much more of
the pious mouthings and cheap poetry offered in reply to it.
We who wish to find at this University instruction about all human in
stitutions and schools of human thought, welcome the opportunity which
is now being given us to learn about Christianity. Dr. Johnston is known
as an intelligent and sincere exponent of the Christia ideal. We are there
fore happy that he is here, and hope he will present to us an intelligent
rtligious faith which we may respect.
