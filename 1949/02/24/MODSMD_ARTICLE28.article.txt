# Religion in Human History
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Fred Wheeler satirizes the role that religion might play in the life of
Stanford students. It is apparent by now that our scientific era contains
the seeds of its own undoing.
On the other hand, the religious drive has been the source of much
that is high and noble in human history. Arrogance and ignorance subtly
hidden in humor and ridicule should not becloud this fact.
