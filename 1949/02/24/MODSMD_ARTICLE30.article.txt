# European Tour
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Last year I had projected a summer tour to Europe, including France,
Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and England; about 50 days
on land, personally conducted, with cultural and educational values to
the fore. At that time The Daily printed a brief announcement of the
plan, and the resulting response among Stanford students was so great
that your action was more than justified.
I am now planning a similar tour for the coming summer, and I wonder
whether you would be willing to do the same thing again. I believe that
students would be glad to know of the opportunity afforded.
