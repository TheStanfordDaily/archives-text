# Ticket Sales by Mail

To the Editor:
It would seem that all the standing in line for tickets to such events
as the Benny Goodman Dance could be simplified if the ASSU and
Card inals would adopt the following policy:
Aftei the date and the price have been announced for a coming event,
students could send in money, check, or money order covering the ;id
mission charge together with a self-addressed, stamped envelope.
rho.se incoming applications could be stamped upon arrival, so they
would be attended to in the order received.
Should the quota run out, the money could be returned in the envelopes.
A student s name could be checked in the directory with a limitation in
the number ol tickets per student imposed in advance.
