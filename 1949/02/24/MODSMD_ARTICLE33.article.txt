### Priscilla Claudius 
BACKLASH by James Raisin (Si
mon and Schuser); 218 pges
Raisin's remarkably vivid de
scriptions of the life in a British
touring carnival make "Backlash"
an exceptional book. This story,
the first novel of James Raisin, is
far better than the average run of
novels being published today.
The story fortunately is kept
quite simple. The entire action, the
story of Racer and his only friends,
Maguire, the pugilistic has - been,
and Lillian, the dance-hall girl, is
kept within the small scope neces
sary to the production of a care
fully detailed and well - developed
novel.
The plot is merely the almost in
sane passion of Racer to return to
the big-time circuit in racing. Em
bittered because of an injury which
terminated his racing career, he has
taken a job with the carnival in the
hope of getting back again. Racer
does not care whom he hurts or
upon whom he has to trample to
achieve his ambition.
Outcasts make up the carnival.
Racer takes out his frustration and
anti - social feelings on his fellow
sufferers. His two friends stand by
him. He finally returns to the track,
but the price he has had to pay has
been 100 great.
When he is killed in the race, no
one is particularly grieved. The
moral being that no one who has
hated humanity and has always
lived in ruthless disregard of his
fellow men could ever have anyone
lo share either his sorrows or his
pleasures, and without someone to
share them with, those feelings have
no meaning.
"Backlash" was originally pub
lished in England. It was received
with so much acclaim that it has
been brought to this country's
reading public.
Although it is difficult to predict
the future success of any novelist,
it is almost safe to say that if James
Raisin exhibits the same careful,
intelligent, colorful style of writing
which he has employed in "Back
lash," his first published work, he
should become a great novelist.
lie has more discretion, more
sense of color and character, more
actual writing ability than can nor
mally be expected from a beginning
novelist. He has written an absorb
ing and brilliant novel.

novel.
The plot is merely the almost in
sane passion of Racer to return to
the big-time circuit in racing. Em
bittered because of an injury which
terminated his racing career, he has
taken a job with the carnival in the
hope of getting back again. Racer
does not care whom he hurts or
upon whom he has to trample to
achieve his ambition.
Outcasts make up the carnival.
Racer takes out his frustration and
anti - social feelings on his fellow
sufferers. His two friends stand by
him. He finally returns to the track,
but the price he has had to pay has
been 100 great.
When he is killed in the race, no
one is particularly grieved. The
moral being that no one who has
hated humanity and has always
lived in ruthless disregard of his
fellow men could ever have anyone
lo share either his sorrows or his
pleasures, and without someone to
share them with, those feelings have
no meaning.
"Backlash" was originally pub
lished in England. It was received
with so much acclaim that it has
been brought to this country's
reading public.
Although it is difficult to predict
the future success of any novelist,
it is almost safe to say that if James
Raisin exhibits the same careful,
intelligent, colorful style of writing
which he has employed in "Back
lash," his first published work, he
should become a great novelist.
lie has more discretion, more
sense of color and character, more
actual writing ability than can nor
mally be expected from a beginning
novelist. He has written an absorb
ing and brilliant novel.
