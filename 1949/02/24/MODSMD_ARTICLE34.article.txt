# Old Timer Plugs Fast Navy Life During War
## 
### 
Now, about the N;ivy. Take it
from an oldtime who knows what
he's talking about, yardbird. This
"Join the Navy and See the World"
is the real McCoy. You do get
around. And the women you meetâ€”
a gal in every port, no less.
Maybe you've heard of the defi
nition of "lucky bag," a Navy term
meaning a soldier's girl out with a
sailor. It went so far in the last
strife that the dogies had to get
out a perfume called "Sailor r?e
pellant" for girls engaged to soldiers.
In China you used to be able to
get three pounds of imported Swiss
cheese, a case of beer, a quart of
whiskey and a wife for a five-spot.
It was awful whiskey, though.
If you ever do get to China be
sure and get a ride in those gin
rickshaws. They've got horses pull
ing them that look just like men.
You really see the world. There
was a radarman named Joe Wilson
who arrived late for registration in
a Navy refresher course in the
States. His excuse to the teacher
was, "I was in Africa yesterday."
S'pose you've heard about the
Scotch sailor who spent three
months in occupied France looking
for a Free-Frenchwoman. When he
did find her, though, she not only
broke his heart, she ruined his whole
evening.
He had only a six-hour pass and
he had to work fast. He suggested
they play a game called Air Mail
that s Post Office, on a higher plane.
Did you ever read any sailors'

girls' diaries? Well, that's how I
know about this fatal charm of
swabbies. Some gal in Seattle con
tributed her diary to a USO book
drive to give our boys something
to read. It was very enlightening.
Page one told of a dull time with
a marine. "Was he missing in ac
tion!" she had inscribed.
Page two started out with, "Sea
man Jones got into town today."
The rest of the page was embers.
