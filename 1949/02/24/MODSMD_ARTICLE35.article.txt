## Bull Session 
### 
Strolling down Memorial Court and feeling very Quady in my new
saddle shoes, 1 was suddenly struck by a happy thought. A person who
is forever behind in his studies is always in a better position to pursue
them.
As I approached the Law Libe. two women talked into view. Women
could make wonderful lawyers. In a battle of words and tongues, a
woman can always hold her own. But she seldom docs.
Two other law students were earnestly discussing the possibility of
contesting a man's will. "Where there's a will, there's a lawsuit," is the
lawyer's motto. It seems the man whose will was the topic of debate
had died accidentally by drinking a bottle of varnish. Boy, did he ever
have a fine finish!
Another group was discussing the case of a girl who had gone out
with a Stanford Rouuh. Things had just reached the point where a Vic
torian girl would have fainted but a modern girl wouldn't dare to faint,
when suddenly the motor stopped. Both crawled under the car to see
if they could fix it. '
"I beg your pardon," said a policeman some time later as he touched
the fellow's shoulder, "but I'm afraid someone has stolen your automobile."
Realizing the students would argue the case of the stolen car far into
the afternoon, I moved on.
But I was more thoughtful, for I appreciated for the first time the
sterling character of lawyers. They arc always there when a felon needs
a friend.
