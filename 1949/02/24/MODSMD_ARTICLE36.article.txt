# Watch that Attitude
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 19 </P)—Your
attitude—oil politics, money, women,
religion, table manners, or anything
else—can get out of order and cause
mental illness, says Dr. Frederick
C. Thorne, a psychiatrist.
Your attitude is the way you feel
about something, or what you think
is right. But lots of people have sick
attitudes, and this makes them mal
adjusted or. eccentric, he explains.
Dr. Thorne says this kind of trou
ble "perhaps constitutes the most
common type of psychic disorder."
He thinks it deserves a new. sep
arate, name, and suggests it be called
"attitudinal pathoses."
The main reasons for doing" this
are that attitude troubles are dif
ferent from other mental illnesses,
and can be corected more easily, he
writes in the Journal of Clinical
Psychology, which he edits.
Dr. Thorne. assistant professor of
psychiatry at the University of Ver
mont, lists these as common types of
people with sick attitudes:
Religious fanatics; people who re
gard science as a fetish; the artistic
type who must live a "Bohemian"
life; the rabid reformer; the per
fectionist;
Misers and spendthrifts, with sick
attitudes about money; woman
haters and man-haters; hypochon
driacs with undue concern over their
health; vegetarians; people ruled by
superstitions; those who worry too

much about etiquette or who exag
gerate personal mannerisms;
"Class snobs'' and people intoler
ant of others because of race, color,
or religion.
Many of these attitudes are com
mon. They cause troubles when
they are overemphasized. The trou
ble is different from neuroses, Dr.
Thornc said.
"In the attitudinal pathoses, the
person consciously behaves in a par
ticular way because he believes that
it is 'right.' But in neuroses he be
haves in a certain way because of
complexes which he is unable to
control, even though he may recog
nize them as maladjusted or wrong."
How do people get the sick atti
tudes?
Mainly by faulty education. Dr.
Thorne said. Either they don't know
enough to form a correct, healthy
attitude, or were misinformed. Or
they may be influenced by supersti
tion or folklore.
Sick attitudes also can spring
from the things that cause neuroses,
like fcad experiences, imitation of
someone who already has sick atti
tudes, and eraction to stess, frus
tration. or defeat.
Treatment of the attitudinal sick
ness is easier, though.
"Since attitudes are learned, they
can be modified by un-learning* and
re-learning. They may be identified,
diagnosed, and modified according
to the psychology of learning. In es
sence, the psychological counselor
may operate, in ridding the person
of attitudinal pathoses, as a master
educator who fills in the gaps and
corrects the erroneous attitudes
which the person has acquired in the
haphazard course of general educa
tion."
Most of the people with sick atti
tudes don't have anything wrong
otherwise in their mental or physi
cal make-up, Dr. Thorne added.
He said studies have shown that
changing the attitude at the core of
their trouble had helped set alco
holics, criminals, and prostitutes
back on the right path. It also
helped persons who were hypo
chondriacs and many Arho were fa
natics in other ways.
