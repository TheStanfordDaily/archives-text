# Midweek Musings . . . .
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
When it's all said and done, there's
nothing like a good fight for provid
ing the maximum in thrills, spills,
r.nd excitement.
Multiply said thrills and spills by
eight, and you begin to see why Fri
day eve's canvas carnival at the Pa
vilion. featuring the ace mitten
fielders of Stanford and California,
js creating such lively interest on
Ye Olde Farm this week
Major attraction for Stanford fight
fans, of course, is Emery Mitchell's
first appearance of the year in the
heavyweight headliner. Mitch is
just newly, recovered from the knee
injury received in the Army grid
massacre and has been training for
something less than two weeks, but
'.he Eureka dynamo is always a top
drawing card, even when in less
than-perfect condition.
In all likelihood, Mitch won't be
:.t peak form after such a short train
ing period; but after watching him
,vork out against such handy lads
as Jim Vatcher and Jim Hammond
the last few days, we're confident
He can hold his own against any
thing the Bears might throw at
him
Hammond Looks For Win
Joltin' Jim Hammond, No. 2 man
of the Cards' dynamite duo, will be
slugging for his fifth consecutive
win of the year Friday night in the
fight-heavy feature. Two of Jim's
four victims to date have suc
cumbed via the knockout route,
which is a pretty fair indication of
the boy's punching power. As men
tor Ray Lunny phrased it: '"When
Jim hits 'em, they stay hit." ....
Lightweight Jose Rael of cinder
fame will fight against the Bears in
place of Max Money, who was orig
inally .stated to battle in the No. 2
lightweight spot. Jose turned in a
real crowd-pleaser his last time out
when he won a close decision in the
San Francisco State match
What with the biggest crowd of the
year anticipated for the Cal shindig,
this might be an opportune time to

review collegiate boxing rules for
the benefit of such spectators as
might otherwise be completely mys
tified by Friday's goings-on.
Three-Round Fights
Each fight is three rounds, with
each contender earning a maximum
of 10 points in any one round. The
lad whom the judges deem to have
won the heat is awarded 10 points,
the loser gaining 7, 8, or 9 points,
depending upon his showing. If the
round is judged even, each man re
ceives the full 10 points, and at the
conclusion of the bout the battler
with the highest number of points,
logically enough, is awarded the de
cision
One seemingly peculiar rule con
cerns the awarding of the decision
in the event one of the gladiators
receives an open cut. If such an in
jury occurs at any time after the
first round, the fight is stopped and
the decision awarded to the fighter
who was ahead on points ai the end
of the preceding round. This
sounds odd at first hearing, but we
presume it was intended to prevent
a fighter from deliberately trying
to reopen any old cuts his oppon
ent might have

injury received in the Army grid
massacre and has been training for
something less than two weeks, but
'.he Eureka dynamo is always a top
drawing card, even when in less
than-perfect condition.
In all likelihood, Mitch won't be

,vork out against such handy lads
as Jim Vatcher and Jim Hammond
the last few days, we're confident
He can hold his own against any
thing the Bears might throw at
him
Hammond Looks For Win
Joltin' Jim Hammond, No. 2 man
of the Cards' dynamite duo, will be
slugging for his fifth consecutive
win of the year Friday night in the
fight-heavy feature. Two of Jim's
four victims to date have suc
cumbed via the knockout route,
which is a pretty fair indication of
the boy's punching power. As men
tor Ray Lunny phrased it: '"When
Jim hits 'em, they stay hit." ....
Lightweight Jose Rael of cinder
fame will fight against the Bears in
place of Max Money, who was orig
inally .stated to battle in the No. 2
lightweight spot. Jose turned in a
real crowd-pleaser his last time out
when he won a close decision in the
San Francisco State match
What with the biggest crowd of the
year anticipated for the Cal shindig,
this might be an opportune time to

review collegiate boxing rules for
the benefit of such spectators as
might otherwise be completely mys
tified by Friday's goings-on.
Three-Round Fights
Each fight is three rounds, with
each contender earning a maximum
of 10 points in any one round. The
lad whom the judges deem to have
won the heat is awarded 10 points,
the loser gaining 7, 8, or 9 points,
depending upon his showing. If the
round is judged even, each man re
ceives the full 10 points, and at the
conclusion of the bout the battler
with the highest number of points,
logically enough, is awarded the de
cision
One seemingly peculiar rule con
cerns the awarding of the decision
in the event one of the gladiators
receives an open cut. If such an in
jury occurs at any time after the
first round, the fight is stopped and
the decision awarded to the fighter
who was ahead on points ai the end
of the preceding round. This
sounds odd at first hearing, but we
presume it was intended to prevent
a fighter from deliberately trying
to reopen any old cuts his oppon
ent might have
When it's all said and done, there's
nothing like a good fight for provid
ing the maximum in thrills, spills,
r.nd excitement.
Multiply said thrills and spills by
eight, and you begin to see why Fri
day eve's canvas carnival at the Pa
vilion. featuring the ace mitten
fielders of Stanford and California,
js creating such lively interest on
Ye Olde Farm this week
Major attraction for Stanford fight
fans, of course, is Emery Mitchell's
first appearance of the year in the
heavyweight headliner. Mitch is
just newly, recovered from the knee
injury received in the Army grid
massacre and has been training for
something less than two weeks, but
