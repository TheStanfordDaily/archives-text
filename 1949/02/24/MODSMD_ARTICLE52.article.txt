## SWIMMING Indians Trample Spartans, 58 to 17 
### 
Stanford's crop of eager swimmers
made it 34 in row Tuesday night
as they carried out pre-meet pre
dictions by soundly dousing San
Jose State, 58 to 17, in the Spar
tans' home pool.
Highlight of the evening's tank
work was when middle-distance
man Ralph Sala carved a tenth of
a second oil the San Jose pool rec
ord in the 220 (time 2:13.7), and
came back a few events later to
shatter the pool record in the 440.
T"he previous 440 record was 4:56.4,
Sala cut it down to 4:49.8.
San Jose was never able to make
a contest out of it, as the Farm fish
took first and second in every event
except diving and the breast-stroke.
Diver Jimmy Bradshaw pulled in
third in the diving division and
Stanford only missed a second in
the 200 breast-stroke because first -
placeman Don Hester was the only
Indian entered.
The winners came in this way:
300-yard medley relay: Stanford,
(Weeden, Hester, Stokely). 220
free style: Sala (S), 2:13.7. 50 free
style: Botchers (S), 24.5. 100 free
style: Cutting (S), 58. 150 back
stroke: Weeden, Jack (S). 440 free
style: Sala (S), 4:40.8. Four-man
relay: Stanford (Cutting, Horak,
Mowat, Fry).
The victorious Indians were weak
ened in the first taste of season
blood by the illness of veteran 100-
man Woody Hoogs. Hoogs, however,
should be back in the drink by next
meet.
