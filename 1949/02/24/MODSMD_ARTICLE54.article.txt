# Card Cagers Leave for Last Ditch Stand in Southland
## 
### 
Leaving on the Noon Daylight today for one final crack .
USC and UCLA, Stanford's varsity cagers will make a last-ditc
effort tomorrow and Saturday night to get back on their feet.
The ballclub, 12 strong, will make its headquarters at the Cha
man Park Hotel across the street from the Brown Derby on W:

shire Boulevard.
Stanford will tackle UCLA first at
Westwood tomorrow night, and then
will move into the Olympic Audi-
torium to meet Sam Barry's Tro-
jans Saturday night.
Chances Slim
With only the slightest mathe-
matical chance remaining for
chances of tieing for the division
championship, Stanford doesn't fig-
ure to have much hope of taking
either the Trojans or Bruins.
USC, led by the best individual
player on the Coast, Bill Sharman,
has beaten Stanford seven straight
times. The last game, a 58 to 57 thril-
ler, was the closest Stanford has
come to topping Troy in two years.
UCLA, conquered twice by the In-
dians in early season games, has re-
versed its previous form to jump
Stanford two straight, and rate a tie
for first place in the division stand-
ings.
Rose To Start
Bill Rose, the trigger-arm
flinger from Menlo Park, will be in-
serted back into the starting lineup
for the first time since last De-
cember.
Other than Rose, Dean will stand
pat on his regular five. George
Yardley will be at the other forward.
Bill Stephenson will handle the point
and Dave Davidson and Marv Gel-
ber will start as guards.
Dave Davidson, who opened at
forward last weekend, picked up a
single point on Troy's Bill Sharman
in the individual scoring race. He
still has quite a way to go.
Sharman leads with 128, with Dav-
idson second at 107. Davidson has
been Stanford's most consistent of-
fensive and defensive performer
since the Southern Division opened.
The traveling squad is as follow
Bryan, Chavalas, Stephenson,
Yardley, Rose, Gelber, Davidson,
Bob Lewis, Bill Lewis, Carver,
Iverson, O'Sullivan.
