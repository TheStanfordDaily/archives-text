# What the 'Bawlout' Means to Stanford—Or How to Get Your Man in One Easy Lesson
## 
### PAT FOSTER 
Back in the good old days of 1901.
juniors and seniors were respected
as a breed apart. In fact, they were
so respected that when a freshman

or sophomore wanted to make r.n
J impression, he would actually pre
tend to be a junior or senior. It was
this freak situation that led the stu- >
dent body of 1901 to nickname the
University Directory the "Bawl
out." because it showed up lower
division social climbers.
But in 1940, the University Direc
tory is still being called the "Bawl- '
| out,' despite the fact ihat no one, :
not even juniors and seniors, re- j
spects juniors and seniors. The
name persists today because the Di
rectory has come to be considered
the Stanford 50 - cent Blind-Date
Bureau.
It reveals enough information on '
Stanford Sam to «ive Stanford Sa
die a basis for guessing whether j
he's her tyj:e and how she should i
gear the conversation. It is from
the Bawlout that Sadie ''gets his :
number."
If, for insance. Sam is one of the :
< 5,619 students from California—the '
state with the largest representation
; —Sadie can expect a sun-bronzed
■ outdoors man with well-developed
biceps. Or so they say. New York,
represented in fourth p'ace with
223. allegedly grows Sams with a j
certain amount of sophistication. If
, Sam is from Delaware. Sadie can J
expect hp to he lonely—the Dela- ;
i ware err was the sparsest of all, !
| yielding nly one student. Every |
state in .'ie Union, including the

District of Columbia, is represented
at Stanford.
Turkey outdid Delaware with 20.
China with 28. South America with
19, Hawaii with 77, Egypt with 4.
Alaska with 10. and Ireland with 3.
For blind date conversation start
ers, the Bawlout reveals a num
ber of odd - sounding home towns.
Twenty-nine Palms, Walla-Walla,
Blackfoot, Marietta, Wenatchee, At
tleboro, Memidji, Aromas, Snoho
mish. and Berkeley are all in the
United States.
Sources for a little teasing are the
middle names the Directory bawls
out. One boy's middle monicker is
de Hart, another's is Bliss, and still
another's Queen. And hundreds of
Herberts, Edgars, juniors, and the
Ill's feel the pangs of pain every
time the Directory is reissued.
Additional knowledge useful for
blind-dating can be gleaned from
the listings of majors. If a student
is one of the 99 speech and drama
majors, he's undoubtedly a ham
who'll be good at parties. If she's
one of the 234 psychology majors,
flattery will get you nowhere un
less it's extremely subtle. Educa
tion. with 75. is the most popular
major according to the Autumn
Bawlout; statistics, with 2. the least.
One hundred ninety-nine are ma
ors in medicine. 422 in law.

juniors and seniors were respected
as a breed apart. In fact, they were
so respected that when a freshman

J impression, he would actually pre
tend to be a junior or senior. It was
this freak situation that led the stu- >
dent body of 1901 to nickname the
University Directory the "Bawl

division social climbers.
But in 1940, the University Direc
tory is still being called the "Bawl- '

not even juniors and seniors, re- j

name persists today because the Di
