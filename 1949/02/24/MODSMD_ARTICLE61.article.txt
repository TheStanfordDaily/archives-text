NEW YORK. Feb. 23 (JP).—Rhode
Island State leads in offense and
Oklahoma A&M in defense, but
only Kentucky's great Wildcats rate
in the first ten in both phases of
play among the nation's major col
legiate basketball teams.
Rhode Island's run and shoot lads
have averaged 71.9 points per game
in 16 contests through Feb. 19, ac
cording to the figures released to
day by the National Collegiate Ath
letic Bureau. On the other hand,
Rhodey has permitted the opposi
tion to run up 59.4 points per game,
an average that would place it far
down the defensive list.
Oklahoma A&M has held its foes
to 34.G points in 20 tilts but has
been able to compile only 46.5
points itself. The Aggies' offensive
mark would put them 'way down
in that department.
Kentucky, tht No. 1 quintet in
the nation, is tenth in scoring with
67.3 in 23 games and third in de
fensive play with 42.7 points.
