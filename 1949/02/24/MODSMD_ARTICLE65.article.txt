# Bulgarian Student Compares Stanford with Former Home
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
In Bulgaria and France there is nothing in the social books
that says a girl can't telephone a boy. Margarita Goldstein, for
eign scholarship student from Bulgaria, wasn't aware of the taboo
upon arriving here.
Once when politely trying to refuse a Saturday night date,

.-he told the boy that she would
call him back, much to the conster
nation of her Lagunita corridor
mates.
But on the whole, Margarita has
had little difficulty in fitting herself
into the social pattern of Stanford
lit' ' Ever since she was 10 years
old, when living in Sophia, Bulgaria,
her ambition has been to come to
America and be like Americans. To
day her ambition is fully realized
and she is the personification of those
"American traits" which she so ad
mires—full of pep, always in a hurry,
and very friendly.
Saddle Shoes
Her first step in the orientation of
American life was to buy a pair of
saddle shoes. When she sent a snap
shot of herself in the new shoes back
home, her friends replied that she
was really sitting on top of the world.
Life and studies in the States are
entirely different from those which
Margarita experienced in Bulgaria.
There she went to a private school,
where high school included two
years of college. For this reason.
Stanford reminds Margarita of high
school.
After high school she attended the
University of Sophia for a year,
where the curriculum varies a great
deal from Stanford's. The students
.specialize in one subject only; our
lower division requirements are
taken care of in high school. There
is no homework, but two- to three
hour lectures, which are not re
quired. Twice a year the students
are given exams.
Prefers U.S. System
Margarita prefers our system,
which keeps you working continu
ously. In Bulgaria, she says, stu
dents don't have to e,o to classes, tut
when those tests arrive, covering an
entire year's work, some heavy
studying is necessary.
The idea of one big happy Stan
ford family is appealing to her when
contrasted with the lack ot' campus
life abroad. There students don't live
on campus. There are no college
coordinated extra-curricular activi
ties. Student newspapers and or
ganizations are all outside of the
school, and there is no such thing
as an on-campus dance. In other
words, Margarita explained, you
just go to school to work.
"Everyone is so friendly here,
especially the boys," she added.
Margarita and her parents escaped
from the Communists in Bulgaria in
September '47 and fled to Paris.
Describing the French, she said.

"You just can't have a friendship
1 witn a Frenchman. They're all
lovers."
American women are far more re-
I spected than Europeans, from what
I Margarita has witnessed. In Amer
; ica, especially at Stanford the men
are not seen molesting the yirls on
ihe streets. Margarita also think
that it is the woman who Ls bos> in
I America.
Because she is only 20. the immi-
I gration law requires that she return
to France for two years, so at the
' end of this year. Margarita will have
J to say good-bye to Stanford.
When she gets to France, she says,
| she is goin;_, to teach the French
j how to Charleston and play the
| ukulele.

where high school included two
years of college. For this reason.
Stanford reminds Margarita of high
school.
After high school she attended the
University of Sophia for a year,
where the curriculum varies a great
deal from Stanford's. The students
.specialize in one subject only; our
lower division requirements are
taken care of in high school. There
is no homework, but two- to three
hour lectures, which are not re
quired. Twice a year the students
are given exams.
Prefers U.S. System
Margarita prefers our system,
which keeps you working continu
ously. In Bulgaria, she says, stu
dents don't have to e,o to classes, tut
when those tests arrive, covering an
entire year's work, some heavy
studying is necessary.
The idea of one big happy Stan
ford family is appealing to her when
contrasted with the lack ot' campus
life abroad. There students don't live
on campus. There are no college
coordinated extra-curricular activi
ties. Student newspapers and or
ganizations are all outside of the
school, and there is no such thing
as an on-campus dance. In other
words, Margarita explained, you
just go to school to work.
"Everyone is so friendly here,
especially the boys," she added.
Margarita and her parents escaped
from the Communists in Bulgaria in
September '47 and fled to Paris.
Describing the French, she said.

"You just can't have a friendship
1 witn a Frenchman. They're all
lovers."
American women are far more re-
I spected than Europeans, from what
I Margarita has witnessed. In Amer
; ica, especially at Stanford the men
are not seen molesting the yirls on
ihe streets. Margarita also think
that it is the woman who Ls bos> in
I America.
Because she is only 20. the immi-
I gration law requires that she return
to France for two years, so at the
' end of this year. Margarita will have
J to say good-bye to Stanford.
When she gets to France, she says,
| she is goin;_, to teach the French
j how to Charleston and play the
| ukulele.
In Bulgaria and France there is nothing in the social books
that says a girl can't telephone a boy. Margarita Goldstein, for
eign scholarship student from Bulgaria, wasn't aware of the taboo
upon arriving here.
Once when politely trying to refuse a Saturday night date,

.-he told the boy that she would
call him back, much to the conster
nation of her Lagunita corridor
mates.
But on the whole, Margarita has
had little difficulty in fitting herself
into the social pattern of Stanford
lit' ' Ever since she was 10 years
old, when living in Sophia, Bulgaria,
her ambition has been to come to
America and be like Americans. To
day her ambition is fully realized
and she is the personification of those
"American traits" which she so ad
mires—full of pep, always in a hurry,
and very friendly.
Saddle Shoes
Her first step in the orientation of
American life was to buy a pair of
saddle shoes. When she sent a snap
shot of herself in the new shoes back
home, her friends replied that she
was really sitting on top of the world.
Life and studies in the States are
entirely different from those which
Margarita experienced in Bulgaria.
There she went to a private school,
where high school included two
years of college. For this reason.
