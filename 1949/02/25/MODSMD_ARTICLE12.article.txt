# Fee System Is Simplified
## 
### 
A simplified systme for handling
woman students' room deposits will
go into effect spring quarter. Dean
of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton
i said yesterday.
From now on, the $25 deposit will
serve the student during her entire
: stay at Stanford, and will be re
turned when she graduates or in
terrupts her residence.
Formerly the deposits were re
turned at the end of each winter
i quarter and applied as part payment
lor spring quarter room and board
: fees. A new deposit then had to be
made in the fall.
The new procedure avoids much
duplicating in accounting, the dean
said. Further simplification is at
tained by eliminating key, pillow,
and other deposits.
