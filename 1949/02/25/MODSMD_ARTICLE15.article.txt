### 
"People who can live, survive,
and maintain a culture under the
ecological difficulties that are found
in the Andean region are of unusual
stamina, fortitude, and stomachs."
So said Dr. Morris A. Stewart in
his talk, "Life on Top of the Andes."
in the Hispanic Series Wednesday
evening.
Dr. Stewart, professor of parasi
tology, University of California,
spoke on the social, political, and
economic structure of the Andean
peoples of Peru and Bolivia.
""The high altitude of the Alti
plano, which is bordered by the
higher ranges of the Andes, has a
great effect on the people who live
there." The people are short—de
formed by the largeness of their
hearts and lungs because of the
lack of oxygen.
The agricultural system is feudal.
The Indians may keep what they
produce on the hacienda land, but
in return they are required to work
for the landowners although this is
forbidden bv Bolivian law.
