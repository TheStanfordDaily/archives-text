### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 24 (VP).â€”
ice - President Barkley said to
ght that in writing a North At
ntic Treaty the United States is
.urely justified in placing our mu
lal strength . . . ut the service of
common defense."
Such a defense, he said, is "vital
the preservation of democracy,
)t only in Europe, but, it may be,
America."
Berkley specifically avoided tak
g sides in the controversy on
hether the proposed North Atlan
-2 pact should include an "auto

matic commitment" for the United
States to go to war in the event of
a Russian attack on the nations of
Western Europe.
In an address at a Jefferson-
Jackson Day dinner here Barkley
said:
"Without attempting to discuss
the details of any compact that may
be entered into, but having faith in
our President and his advisers, and
in our Congress ... I feel confident
that out of it will come a construc
tive understanding that may pre
vent another world war.
"It is unfortunate." he said, "tliat
in the present posture of world af
fairs. nearly three-fourths of our
national budget is devoted to pay
the expenses of past wars and try
ing to prevent future wars.
"If a settled and trusted peace
cou'd come to the nations of the
world, if the time could come when
we and other nations could trust
implicitly the word of every other
nation of the world in its protesta
tions in behalf of the peace, we
would be able to reduce our budget
by $10,000,000,000 to $15,000,000.-
000 per year.
"But these expenditures, burden
some as they seem, are but a mere
fraction of what war would cost us.
and what war has cost us in the
past."
Barkley declared that "whether we
wished it or not, the United States
has become "the leader among the
nations of the world."
