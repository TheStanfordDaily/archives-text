## Good News for Farm 
### 
Wednesday's Daily editorial stated that the day's front page
scholarship story was one of the most important to appear in
the paper this quarter. Today, however, we carry another story
of more immediate importance to every student, faculty member,
and administration official at Stanford.
Dr. Wallace Sterling's advanced arrival to the University, now
set for April 1, is indeed fortunate for every individual on the
Farm.
To seniors the news means that they will be able to meet the
new president while they are students as well as read about him
when they become alumni in a few months.
To the University the news means that Dr. Sterling will have
become fully adjusted to his position by the time the 1949-50
school year begins. The difficult complications involved in the
work of a university president do not make rapid orientation
possible.
To Dr. Sterling we have this to say:
You have the support of the entire student body behind you.
An air of excitement has stirred the interest of the men and
women since your appointment to the presidency was announced.
This is especially true of the students who have Known you
over a period of years and those men and women who met you
since the announcement of your appointment. We all welcome
you back to Stanford and wish you all success in your new posi
tion.
