## Sarcasm Against Religion 
### 
To the Editor:
In regard to the satirical letter of Fred Wheeler, I think it was a mistake
for The Daily to print it. I believe that the great majority of Stanford
students take offense at such sarcasm when directed against religion.
If Mr. Wheeler is a disciple of the pitiful Henry Wallace, his poor taste
is understandable. If not, he certainly should have made clear his lack
of sympathy with the anti-religious persecutions which have so recently
shocked the civilized world. As it is, many readers will conclude (incor
rectly. I hope) that by his attempt to ridicule the greatest force in the
lAvQfld opposing Communism, Mr. Wheeler places himself in alliance with
the degraded torturers of Cardinal Mindszenty and the stooge-worshipers
cf Stalin.
