# Adolescent Satire
## 
### 
To the Editor:
To Mr. Johnston I extend my personal apologies as a Stanford student
for Fred Wheeler's uncalled-for, adolescent "satire" attacking the chap
lain's proposal of establishing a campus religious organization.
Since major universities have such activities represented on their cam
puses in some form, and especially in the light of Mrs. Stanford's wishes
and provision of such a fine chapel, it would seem that Stanford would
do well to promote this phase of campus life.
So, here's hoping Mr. Johnston will be successful in establishing some
fcfrm of active religious organization on the Stanford campus; also, that
future egotistical adolescents restrain themselves from appearing in print
unless they can find at least one concurring opinion in the student body.
