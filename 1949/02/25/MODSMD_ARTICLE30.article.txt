(Ed Note: The following article

Crimson.)
Harvard men don't want to have
any more children than their Rad
clifTe wives do.
That information is one result of a
poll conducted this month among
Social Relations 1 students at both
colleges. The poll indicates that the
average Harvard man and RadclifTe
girl each hope to have four children.
Since 60 per cent of all RadclifTe
girls marry Harvard men, it's a good
thing, too.

Called "Autobiographyâ€”2,ooo A.
D.,'" the questionnaire asked students
to predict what would happen to
I them in the next 50 years. Ques
{ tions included, "How do you expect
' to die?" "What is the worst thing
| that will probably happen to you?"
i and "Do you expect to get divorced?"
Gordon W. Allport. professor of
! Psychology, made the survey to see
j how social and financial background
I affect a student's future hopes and
outlooks. He intends to compare the
! results with surveys in other coun
tries and cultures.
