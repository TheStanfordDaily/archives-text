By PAUL C. JOHNSTON. Chaplain
Thank you. Fred Wheeler, tor the
letter you wrote to the editor last
week. You have done us a great
service. Whether your negative no
tions were put forward seriously or
not, the result has been an avalanche
of criticism of your position.
People may assume an indifferent
attitude toward organized religion,
but when anyone attacks something
deeply sacred he may expect just
such an uprising. I have heard of
a Providence Who over-rules all
things to His purpose. There was a
Prophet who once said:
"Do not these people provoke
themselves, to the confusion of their
own faces?"
Honestly, I suspect you are quite
a line fellow. 1 would like to know
you. Of course, real religion is not
negative. 11 is not prohibition, but
emancipation, and the road to true
liberty.
From what you wrote to The Daily
I would gather that you have met up
with what I dared in my first article
to call a "bad" religion. Possibly
you would care to become ac
quainted with a "good" one.
My thanks to those who, on their
own motion, took up cudgels in be
half ol a vital religious program
here, and wrote to the editor. They
have asked for a fair chance for the
program (and the Chaplain) to prove
themselves entitled to respect. I am
grateful for that, as well as for the
friendly testimonies that a body of
believers already exists in Stanford.
Enough of that. Someone has
asked. "If wc are to have a Council
of Religious Activities, what would
it do?" It is a fair question.
Here are some of the possibilities.
It would be a clearing house for
ideas promoting religion; explore
University policies'and suggest study
changes to the Administration; inte
grate the schedules of the two-score
religious clubs and groups already
here; furnish a "meeting place for
minds," and encourage common un
derstanding.
Being democratically-operated, it
would itself sponsor projects of mu
tual concern. These would include
study and discussion groups, re
ligious emphasis periods, leadership
training classes, methods by which
broad and comprehensive religious
information could be disseminated.
One of the worst traits of our gen
eration is its general religious illit
eracy. This illiteracy cripples the
personality, and is the mother of
prejudice. None may claim to be
an educated person who elects to re
main ignorant of the great ethnic
faiths, the enormous influence they
have exerted in history, or the cur
rent power of the church. A knowl
edge of the literature of religion is
one's passport into the arts.
To the overcoming of religious il
literacy the Council would dedicate
itself. Then, it would interest itself
in projects of campus betterment, in
surveys of campus opinion and prac
tice; in sending deputations off-cam
pus and undertaking l social service
work in the community; in supply
ing representation to regional, na
tional, and international intercol
legiate conferences and movements.
And it would get under the project
of having a religious union building
contiguous to the Church, to house
the activities, a library, and a devo
tional chapel.
These are but hints of what the
Council could be and do. There will
be more suggestions coming.

To the overcoming of religious il
literacy the Council would dedicate
itself. Then, it would interest itself
in projects of campus betterment, in
surveys of campus opinion and prac
tice; in sending deputations off-cam
pus and undertaking l social service
work in the community; in supply
ing representation to regional, na
tional, and international intercol
legiate conferences and movements.
And it would get under the project
of having a religious union building
contiguous to the Church, to house
the activities, a library, and a devo
tional chapel.
These are but hints of what the
Council could be and do. There will
be more suggestions coming.
By PAUL C. JOHNSTON. Chaplain
Thank you. Fred Wheeler, tor the
letter you wrote to the editor last
week. You have done us a great
service. Whether your negative no
tions were put forward seriously or
not, the result has been an avalanche
of criticism of your position.
People may assume an indifferent
attitude toward organized religion,
but when anyone attacks something
deeply sacred he may expect just
such an uprising. I have heard of
a Providence Who over-rules all
things to His purpose. There was a
Prophet who once said:
"Do not these people provoke
themselves, to the confusion of their
own faces?"
Honestly, I suspect you are quite
a line fellow. 1 would like to know
you. Of course, real religion is not
negative. 11 is not prohibition, but
emancipation, and the road to true
liberty.
From what you wrote to The Daily
I would gather that you have met up
with what I dared in my first article
to call a "bad" religion. Possibly
you would care to become ac
quainted with a "good" one.
My thanks to those who, on their
own motion, took up cudgels in be
half ol a vital religious program
here, and wrote to the editor. They
have asked for a fair chance for the
program (and the Chaplain) to prove
themselves entitled to respect. I am
grateful for that, as well as for the
friendly testimonies that a body of
believers already exists in Stanford.
Enough of that. Someone has
asked. "If wc are to have a Council
of Religious Activities, what would
it do?" It is a fair question.
Here are some of the possibilities.
It would be a clearing house for
ideas promoting religion; explore
University policies'and suggest study
changes to the Administration; inte
grate the schedules of the two-score
religious clubs and groups already
here; furnish a "meeting place for
minds," and encourage common un
derstanding.
Being democratically-operated, it
would itself sponsor projects of mu
tual concern. These would include
study and discussion groups, re
ligious emphasis periods, leadership
training classes, methods by which
broad and comprehensive religious
information could be disseminated.
One of the worst traits of our gen
eration is its general religious illit
eracy. This illiteracy cripples the
personality, and is the mother of
prejudice. None may claim to be
an educated person who elects to re
main ignorant of the great ethnic
faiths, the enormous influence they
have exerted in history, or the cur
rent power of the church. A knowl
edge of the literature of religion is
one's passport into the arts.
