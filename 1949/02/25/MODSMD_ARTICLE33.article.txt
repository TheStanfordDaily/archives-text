WASHINGTON (/I I ).—Fuel deal
ers over much of the nation are
finding themselves with disconcert
ingly large stocks on hand.
The Interior Department says this
is especially true in major cities
east of the Mississippi, which nor
mally burn the most coal and oil.
That part of the country has had an
unseasonably warm winter.
The only oil shortages are in cer
tain grades of lighter oils and gaso
line on the West Coast, entirely the
result of last year's refinery strikes.
