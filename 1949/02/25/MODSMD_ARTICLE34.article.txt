# Precision Gage Laboratory Will Open Here Today
## 
### 
Millionths of an inch are an every
day affair in the Precision Gage
Laboratory which will open today i
at Stanford Research Institute.
The new laboratory, in which the 4
science of measurement reaches
limits unbelievable to a person who j
considers a yardstick fairly reliable,
is the only facility of its kind north
of Los Angeles and one of two in
the entire West Coast region, it was j
announced by Dr J. E. Hobson, ex
ecutive director of SRI.
The laboratory will serve industry,
educational institutions, and anyone :
who needs extremely precise mea- 1
surements.
Its equipment, valued at a quar
ter of a million dollars, is capable j
of accurate measurements down to
twenty-five millionths of an inch—
100 times smaller than the diameter
of a fine human hair.
The majority of the equipment is
under contract from the Army Ord
nance Department, which closed its j
San Francisco district gage labora
tories in 1945. It will be available in
the non-profit research institute at
nominal fees to be established on a
cost-incurred basis.
Specially-Designed Room
The delicate measuring devices
are housed in a specially-designed
and scientifically lighted room main
tained constantly at a temperature of
68 degrees Fahrenheit and a hu
midity of 35 per cent.
Metal cubes, rectangular forms,
and thin sections—all known as gage
blocks—are the heart of the labora
tory. They are absolute standards
for comparison measurements and
are extremely sensitive to variations
of heat. A four-inch block held in
the hand responds to body heat so
readily that within five minutes it
increases its size thirty-five mil
lionths of an inch.
Gage blocks are used alone and
in combination with delicate re
cording instruments for determin
ing the accuracy of new and used
industrial parts vital to mass pro
duction. Without periodic checking
for accuracy, master models used in
industrial processes would soon lose
their effectiveness.
The new SRI laboratory hopes to
serve western industry. Dr. Hobson
said, by providing a service in this
region which will make it unneces
sary to send industrial gages, tools,
and parts to eastern points for
checking.
Klncks Cheeked Often
The laboratory has several mas
ter sets of gage blocks, including
Johansson, Hoke, and Van Keuren
makes. They will be checked every
six months with the National Bu
reau of Standards in Washington.
Through the bureau, these measur
, ing standards have a near relation
with the world's nearest perfect
measured distance, the scribed lines
on the platinum-iridium metric bar
• in the International Bureau of

Weights and Measures in Paris—or
of the world's most closely guarde
treasures.
Another technique employed b
Ihe laboratory will be the use <
monochromatic light with optic;
flats for determining the degree <
flatness of a surface. Commo
sources of light emit different wa\
lengths, for each of several colo
contained in it.
To guarantee results in precisic
measurements using light, the lal
oratory at SRI has a sodium vapt
lamp which sends out light of
tingle color and, therefore, one wa\
length. This has been measured
23.2 millionths of an inch.
The smallest divisions of the me;
suring scale are read by electric
impulses in the new Precision Ga;
Laboratory. On hand are three elo<
trolimit comparators which are d<
vised so that the mechanical motk
of a gaging spindle is magniflc
electrically. Magnifications as hi),
as 25,000-to-l are possible in con
parison measurements.
Two of SRl's comparators ha l
twenty millionths of an inch divi
ions and a third has divisions to fif
millionths. Their accuracy is W(
under one millionth of an inch.
Detection Service
Detection is also a service of tl
laboratory. For discovering flaws
metal, such as heat treatment cracl
the laboratory has the latest mod
Magnaflux. This apparatus is a sp
! cial well containing an electric c<
I running through oil in which in
: particles are suspended. A piece
metal to be tested is inserted b
tween the coils. An electrical char
sets up a flux—lines of magnet
force—through the tested piec
The most minute flaws and crac
break the flux and cause the magn
tized filings in suspension to atta
themselves to the surface about t
crack. This adhesion discloses t
location of a fault.
Public inspection of the nc
premises will be invited on Frid;
Mar. 18, between the hours of
a.m. and 3 p.m., according to an a
nouncement by Dr. Hobson. Dot
! onstrations of the various instr
ments will be given and their a
\ plication to industrial techniqv
will be explained.
In announcing the opening of t
laboratory. Dr. Hobson said: "T
convenient calibration of precisi
measuring standards, instrumen
! and manufactured components is o
of the vital necessities of any indi
trial area. We consider ourseh
most fortunate in having obtained
of the instruments needed for ge
eral industrial and research pv.

He pointed out that the facilit
j of the laboratory are unique in tl
region and that they are no
existent in Oregon. Washingt<
Idaho, Wyoming. Montana, Neva<
and Utah.

an industrial flush pin for length specifications. Ashton is using Jo
hansson gage blocks from master set at his left in combination with a

Millionths of an inch are an every
day affair in the Precision Gage
Laboratory which will open today i
at Stanford Research Institute.
The new laboratory, in which the 4
science of measurement reaches
limits unbelievable to a person who j
considers a yardstick fairly reliable,
is the only facility of its kind north
of Los Angeles and one of two in
the entire West Coast region, it was j
announced by Dr J. E. Hobson, ex
ecutive director of SRI.
The laboratory will serve industry,
educational institutions, and anyone :
who needs extremely precise mea- 1
surements.
Its equipment, valued at a quar
ter of a million dollars, is capable j
of accurate measurements down to
twenty-five millionths of an inch—
100 times smaller than the diameter
of a fine human hair.
The majority of the equipment is
under contract from the Army Ord
nance Department, which closed its j
San Francisco district gage labora
tories in 1945. It will be available in
the non-profit research institute at
nominal fees to be established on a
cost-incurred basis.
Specially-Designed Room
The delicate measuring devices
are housed in a specially-designed
and scientifically lighted room main
tained constantly at a temperature of
68 degrees Fahrenheit and a hu
midity of 35 per cent.
Metal cubes, rectangular forms,
and thin sections—all known as gage
blocks—are the heart of the labora
tory. They are absolute standards
for comparison measurements and
are extremely sensitive to variations
of heat. A four-inch block held in
the hand responds to body heat so
readily that within five minutes it
increases its size thirty-five mil
lionths of an inch.
Gage blocks are used alone and
in combination with delicate re
cording instruments for determin
ing the accuracy of new and used
industrial parts vital to mass pro
duction. Without periodic checking
for accuracy, master models used in
industrial processes would soon lose
their effectiveness.
The new SRI laboratory hopes to
serve western industry. Dr. Hobson
said, by providing a service in this
region which will make it unneces
sary to send industrial gages, tools,
and parts to eastern points for
checking.
Klncks Cheeked Often
The laboratory has several mas
ter sets of gage blocks, including
Johansson, Hoke, and Van Keuren
makes. They will be checked every
six months with the National Bu
reau of Standards in Washington.
Through the bureau, these measur
, ing standards have a near relation
with the world's nearest perfect
measured distance, the scribed lines
on the platinum-iridium metric bar
• in the International Bureau of

Weights and Measures in Paris—or
of the world's most closely guarde
treasures.
Another technique employed b
Ihe laboratory will be the use <
monochromatic light with optic;
flats for determining the degree <
flatness of a surface. Commo
sources of light emit different wa\
lengths, for each of several colo
contained in it.
To guarantee results in precisic
measurements using light, the lal
oratory at SRI has a sodium vapt
lamp which sends out light of
tingle color and, therefore, one wa\
length. This has been measured
23.2 millionths of an inch.
The smallest divisions of the me;
suring scale are read by electric
impulses in the new Precision Ga;
Laboratory. On hand are three elo<
trolimit comparators which are d<
vised so that the mechanical motk
of a gaging spindle is magniflc

the hand responds to body heat so
readily that within five minutes it
increases its size thirty-five mil
lionths of an inch.
Gage blocks are used alone and
in combination with delicate re
cording instruments for determin
ing the accuracy of new and used
industrial parts vital to mass pro
duction. Without periodic checking
for accuracy, master models used in
industrial processes would soon lose
their effectiveness.
The new SRI laboratory hopes to
serve western industry. Dr. Hobson
said, by providing a service in this
region which will make it unneces
sary to send industrial gages, tools,
and parts to eastern points for
checking.
Klncks Cheeked Often
The laboratory has several mas
ter sets of gage blocks, including
Johansson, Hoke, and Van Keuren
makes. They will be checked every
six months with the National Bu
reau of Standards in Washington.
Through the bureau, these measur
, ing standards have a near relation
with the world's nearest perfect
measured distance, the scribed lines
on the platinum-iridium metric bar
• in the International Bureau of

Weights and Measures in Paris—or
of the world's most closely guarde
treasures.
Another technique employed b
Ihe laboratory will be the use <
monochromatic light with optic;
flats for determining the degree <
flatness of a surface. Commo
sources of light emit different wa\
lengths, for each of several colo
contained in it.
To guarantee results in precisic
measurements using light, the lal
oratory at SRI has a sodium vapt
lamp which sends out light of
tingle color and, therefore, one wa\
length. This has been measured
23.2 millionths of an inch.
The smallest divisions of the me;
suring scale are read by electric
impulses in the new Precision Ga;
Laboratory. On hand are three elo<
trolimit comparators which are d<
vised so that the mechanical motk
of a gaging spindle is magniflc
electrically. Magnifications as hi),
as 25,000-to-l are possible in con
parison measurements.
Two of SRl's comparators ha l
twenty millionths of an inch divi
ions and a third has divisions to fif
millionths. Their accuracy is W(
under one millionth of an inch.

an industrial flush pin for length specifications. Ashton is using Jo
hansson gage blocks from master set at his left in combination with a
height gage and indicator for this operation.
Millionths of an inch are an every
day affair in the Precision Gage
Laboratory which will open today i
at Stanford Research Institute.
The new laboratory, in which the 4
science of measurement reaches
limits unbelievable to a person who j
considers a yardstick fairly reliable,
is the only facility of its kind north
of Los Angeles and one of two in
the entire West Coast region, it was j
announced by Dr J. E. Hobson, ex
ecutive director of SRI.
The laboratory will serve industry,
educational institutions, and anyone :
who needs extremely precise mea- 1
surements.
Its equipment, valued at a quar
ter of a million dollars, is capable j
of accurate measurements down to
twenty-five millionths of an inch—
100 times smaller than the diameter
of a fine human hair.
The majority of the equipment is
under contract from the Army Ord
nance Department, which closed its j
San Francisco district gage labora
tories in 1945. It will be available in
the non-profit research institute at
nominal fees to be established on a
cost-incurred basis.
Specially-Designed Room
The delicate measuring devices
are housed in a specially-designed
and scientifically lighted room main
tained constantly at a temperature of
68 degrees Fahrenheit and a hu
midity of 35 per cent.
Metal cubes, rectangular forms,
and thin sections—all known as gage
blocks—are the heart of the labora
tory. They are absolute standards
for comparison measurements and
are extremely sensitive to variations
of heat. A four-inch block held in
