# Card Sluggers, Magna Cum Mitchell, Hit Burly Hears in Pavilion Tonight
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
It's the Big Fight tonight at vhe
Pavilion.
Stanford's twice-victorious boxers,
bolstered by the return of heavy
weight Emery Mitchell, rank as
alight favorites to notch their third
victory of the year tonight against
the lads from across the Bay, dem
dirty Golden Bears.
Square-oft time has been sei for
3 o'clock, when slim Bobby Baker
will answer the opening bell to carry
the Indian 130-pound hopes against
Berkeley's John Parham.
Eight star-studded bouts are fea
tured on the stellar card, and the
largest fight crowd of the 1949 sea
son is a certainty. Mostly the fans
vail be there to see the fabulous
"litchell, he of the pretzel knee,
lake on John GrofT in the main
oventer.
And Seven More
But they'll also see seven other
1 cuts which promise to provide the
ilmost in ring thrills.
For Card coach Ray Lunny has as
sembled one of his finest canvas
■ c rps in recent years, and reports
drifting through the log from across
the Bay assure us that the Bear
mittmen are no slouches, either.
Mitchell has been in training for
onJy two weeks following his re
covery .from last fall's knee opera

tion; and while he doubtlessly has
not reached peak form, Lunny is
confident that big Mitch can make
things pretty warm for GrofT.
But then, Mr. GrofT might have
some ideas on the subject, too.
No. 2 man of the Indians' lethal
one-two punch is Joltin' Jim Ham

mond. a vicious young giant who
hasn't been beaten yet this year.
He'll be out for his fifth of the year
against John Emerson in the light
heavyweight feature, and chances
are that he'll get it.
But in any event, ringsiders can
look forward to no small amount of
fireworks in this one.
Ten Eyek Has Class
Fred Ten Eyck, a smooth-working
IGS-pounder who has been doing his
sparring this week with former
Slanford and Pacific Coast middle
weight champ Jack Rice, will tan
gle with rugged Irv Tucker, a con
verted light-heavyweight, in a
match that could easily snare the
headlines awiiy from the bigger boys.
Ten Eyc'i\ has the edge in class,
but Tucker punches with all the
precision i-nd power of a pile-driver,
according to our East Bay informers.
It'll be inuresting, to say the least.
A third-year performer on Lun
ny's ring crew, Willie Altus, will
trade punches with Cal's Hank Har
vey in the 155-pound bout; Sopho
more A 1 Anderson faces rugged Ed
Farris at 145 pounds; and Jay Sav
age and Jose Rael will carry the
Card lightweight banner against Ed
Griffin and Rod Doerr.
Former middleweight titleholder
Fred Apostoli will be one of the
iudges.


EMERY MITCHELL. With wounds
liealeil. hopes high, and a thun
derous right, sportsmen again
will see (he lightning action of
the "Big M."

EMERY MITCHELL. With wounds
liealeil. hopes high, and a thun
derous right, sportsmen again
will see (he lightning action of
the "Big M."
It's the Big Fight tonight at vhe
Pavilion.
Stanford's twice-victorious boxers,
bolstered by the return of heavy
weight Emery Mitchell, rank as
alight favorites to notch their third
victory of the year tonight against
the lads from across the Bay, dem
dirty Golden Bears.
Square-oft time has been sei for
3 o'clock, when slim Bobby Baker
will answer the opening bell to carry
the Indian 130-pound hopes against
Berkeley's John Parham.
Eight star-studded bouts are fea
tured on the stellar card, and the
largest fight crowd of the 1949 sea
son is a certainty. Mostly the fans
vail be there to see the fabulous
"litchell, he of the pretzel knee,
lake on John GrofT in the main
oventer.
And Seven More
But they'll also see seven other
1 cuts which promise to provide the
ilmost in ring thrills.
For Card coach Ray Lunny has as
sembled one of his finest canvas
■ c rps in recent years, and reports
drifting through the log from across
the Bay assure us that the Bear
mittmen are no slouches, either.
Mitchell has been in training for
onJy two weeks following his re
covery .from last fall's knee opera

tion; and while he doubtlessly has
not reached peak form, Lunny is
confident that big Mitch can make
things pretty warm for GrofT.
But then, Mr. GrofT might have
some ideas on the subject, too.
No. 2 man of the Indians' lethal
one-two punch is Joltin' Jim Ham

mond. a vicious young giant who
hasn't been beaten yet this year.
He'll be out for his fifth of the year
against John Emerson in the light
heavyweight feature, and chances
are that he'll get it.
But in any event, ringsiders can
look forward to no small amount of
fireworks in this one.
Ten Eyek Has Class
Fred Ten Eyck, a smooth-working
IGS-pounder who has been doing his
sparring this week with former
Slanford and Pacific Coast middle
weight champ Jack Rice, will tan
gle with rugged Irv Tucker, a con
verted light-heavyweight, in a
match that could easily snare the
headlines awiiy from the bigger boys.
Ten Eyc'i\ has the edge in class,
but Tucker punches with all the
precision i-nd power of a pile-driver,
according to our East Bay informers.
It'll be inuresting, to say the least.
A third-year performer on Lun
ny's ring crew, Willie Altus, will
trade punches with Cal's Hank Har
vey in the 155-pound bout; Sopho
more A 1 Anderson faces rugged Ed
Farris at 145 pounds; and Jay Sav
age and Jose Rael will carry the
Card lightweight banner against Ed
Griffin and Rod Doerr.
Former middleweight titleholder
Fred Apostoli will be one of the
iudges.
