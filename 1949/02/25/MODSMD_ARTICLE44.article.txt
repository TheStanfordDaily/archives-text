# Indian Five Greeted By Southern Maulers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's limping cagers, bat
tered and beaten from two week
ends of abuse at the hands of South
ern foes, will invade Westwood to
night in a last effort to salvage some
self respect.
Tomorrow night, Stanford will
face USC's Sharmful Trojans in
the Olympic Auditorium. USC, cur
rently tied with UCLA for the di
vision leadership, is favored to
knock off tlie Cards for the eighth
time in a row.
With nothing to lose, or so the
story goes, the Indians will be out to
end their six-game losing streak and
demonstrate to Los Angeles fans that
they really do know how to play
basketball. At present, there is
some doubt.
At any rate, both games will be
radioed out to the Bay Area via
station KLA.
/one Defense
In order to stop the recent Tro
jan and Bruin success stories, Ever
ett Dean will play juggler with his
starting lineup and regular defen
sive tactics.
Bill Rose, second highest scorer
on the squad last year but just a
benchman this season, will be in
serted into the first five in place of
the efficient, but slow-moving Bob
Lewis.
Mentor Dean, puzzled and per
turbed over the downfall of his once
lOth-in-the-nation Indians, will have
his boys switch from their usual
man-to-man to a zone defense.
It will be the first time Stanford
has messed with the zone since the
USF game, at which time the Tribe
befuddled the Dons enough in the
early minutes to roll up a G5 to 55
victory.
If said defense has any such re
sults against Wooden's wild West
wooders, it might be back to stay.
Dave vs. Sawyer
Highlighting the weekend battle
will be the race between Dave Dav
idson and Bruin Alan Sawyer for
second place in the divisional scor
ing parade. Davidson has the edge
so far, with a four-point 107 to 103
lead.
Of course, Troy's Bill Sharman is
coasting along with 128. to place him
well ahead of the pack.
Stanford will not be able to use a
zone against USC, as Sharman and
Abe Androff are masters at hitting
from the open spaces.
A double victory this weekend
would give Stanford a slight chance
to tie for the loop Hag. but that fact
is about as probable as the Olympic
Auditorium not hooting at George
Yardley.

Rose F Clutska

face USC's Sharmful Trojans in
the Olympic Auditorium. USC, cur
rently tied with UCLA for the di
vision leadership, is favored to
knock off tlie Cards for the eighth
time in a row.
With nothing to lose, or so the
story goes, the Indians will be out to
end their six-game losing streak and
demonstrate to Los Angeles fans that
they really do know how to play
basketball. At present, there is
some doubt.
At any rate, both games will be
radioed out to the Bay Area via
station KLA.
/one Defense
In order to stop the recent Tro
jan and Bruin success stories, Ever
ett Dean will play juggler with his
starting lineup and regular defen
sive tactics.
Bill Rose, second highest scorer
on the squad last year but just a
benchman this season, will be in
serted into the first five in place of
the efficient, but slow-moving Bob
Lewis.
Mentor Dean, puzzled and per
turbed over the downfall of his once
lOth-in-the-nation Indians, will have
his boys switch from their usual
man-to-man to a zone defense.
It will be the first time Stanford
has messed with the zone since the
USF game, at which time the Tribe
befuddled the Dons enough in the
early minutes to roll up a G5 to 55
victory.
If said defense has any such re
sults against Wooden's wild West
wooders, it might be back to stay.
Dave vs. Sawyer
Highlighting the weekend battle
will be the race between Dave Dav
idson and Bruin Alan Sawyer for
second place in the divisional scor
ing parade. Davidson has the edge
so far, with a four-point 107 to 103
lead.
Of course, Troy's Bill Sharman is
coasting along with 128. to place him
well ahead of the pack.
Stanford will not be able to use a
zone against USC, as Sharman and
Abe Androff are masters at hitting
from the open spaces.
A double victory this weekend
would give Stanford a slight chance
to tie for the loop Hag. but that fact
is about as probable as the Olympic
Auditorium not hooting at George
Yardley.
Starting lineups:
STANFORD UCLA
Rose F Clutska
Yardley F Sawyer
Stephenson C Kraushaar
Gelber G Pearson
Davidson G Stanich
Stanford's limping cagers, bat
tered and beaten from two week
ends of abuse at the hands of South
ern foes, will invade Westwood to
night in a last effort to salvage some
self respect.
Tomorrow night, Stanford will
face USC's Sharmful Trojans in
