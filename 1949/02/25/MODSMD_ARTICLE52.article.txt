### 
BOSTON, Feb. 24 (.-Pi â€” Slugger
Ted Williams' ol't-intimated ambi
tion to become baseball's first $100-
000 player appeared fulfilled tonight
when he advised General Manager
Joe Cronin he would sign his 1949
Red Sox contract on arrival at the
Sarasota training camp on March (5.
"1 ve just had a phone call from
Ted in Everglades City, Fla., during'
which he told me he was very happy
about his contract and would sign
up when he reports about two
weeks hence," Cronin said.
Cronin refused to divulge Wil
liams now salary terms and side
stepped neatly when asked if the
American League's ,365-hitter had
been promised more than the re
ported $80,000 he received last sea
son.
It has been the Red Sox policy to
refrain from publicizing player sal
aries and Williams always has ad
hered to it.
