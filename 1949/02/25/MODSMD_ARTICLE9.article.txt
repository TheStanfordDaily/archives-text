# President Hints Marshall Plan May End Sooner Than Originally Expected
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24 (/P). —
President Truman today reaffirmed
his stand that America should stick
lay the Marshall Plan until Euro
pean recovery is won. But, taking
note of British optimism, he said the
task might not take four years, us
originally contemplated.
Mr. Truman gave no support to
suggestions, arising on Capitol Hill
and elsewhere, that recovery aid
might be throttled down now in
view of optimistic reports on Brit
ish recovery.
If it takes four years, that's all

right, the President said. Perhaps it
wi'l take less if the British reports
are correct, but the plan should be
continued until recovery is assured.
There were reports the Atlantic
powers are near agreement on a
defense clause in the proposed North
Atlantic Treaty designed to erect
safeguards against any Communist
aggression.
The clause, covering action by the
signatories in event of armed at
tack. is designed to bulwark the re
covery program by contributing to
European security.
The key clause is understood to
provide:
First, a military assault on any
of the seven powers shall be con
sidered as an attack on all, and
each country shall assist in meeting
the attack as a matter of self-de
fense under the United Nations
Charter.
Second, each country will decide
for itself the steps it will take, mili
tary or other, to meet the attack.
