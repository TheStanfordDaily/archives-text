## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (/P)—Re
publicans will blast President Tru
man's stabilization program as
"planned economy" in a minority re
port from the Senate-House Eco- I
r.omic Committee this week.
The Democratic majority of the |
committee, headed by Senator
O'Mahoney of Wyoming, is expected !
to give lull-fledged endorsement to
Mr. Truman's proposal for a $4,000,-
000.000 tax increase and for standby
economic controls.
Senator Taft (R-Ohio) told a re- '
portei' that Republicans won't pass
r.p the opportunity to pin point their
opposition to the President's pro
cram.
Charge Government Control
Taft wouldn't elaborate, but else
where it was learned that the Re
publicans plan to charge the Presi
dent's program is aimed toward gov
ernment domination of business, '
particularly through Mr. Truman's ;
proposal for federal authority to
.>uild industrial plants.
The economic report battle will
eature a week on Capitol Hill in
which Southern Democrats begin an
pen Senate fight on the President's j
civil rights program.
Developing in the form of a fili
buster against a proposed rules
change, this battle is expected to stall
:he Senate itself on dead center for
indeterminate period.
House Money Bills
The House, thumbing through
minor bills early in the week, will
_et down to business Wednesday on (
ne first of a long list of money bills.
A bill to continue rent controls-*-a
ital part of the President's domestic
program—may reach the House be- !
'.ore the weekend. A compromise 1
housing bill which many Republi
cans will support is ready for the j
Senate, but will have to wait an end 1
) the exepcted filibuster.
The House Ways and Means Com
mittee begins hearings tomorrow on
the President's proposal for broad
ening Social Security coverage and
benefits. 'Ibis includes controversial
"home aid" provisions.
1 he House Judiciary Committee
takes up Wednesday the question of !
raising the number of displaced Eu
ropeans who can be admitted to this
country, from the present 200.000
limitation to 400,000.
British Aid
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hears Paul Hoffman, eco
omic cooperation administrator, tell
why Britain needs the full $940,-
(•00,000 of sceond-year Marshall Plan
■ id. despite an English spokesman's
statement that Britain is well on the
road to economic recovery. British \
fficials contend that recovery de
pends on continuance of U.S. aid.
The Senate Finance Committee
still has before it a House-approved I

bill reviving the original Reciprocal
Trade Agreements Act, without the
limitations tacked on by the last
Republican Congress. But there was
little indication of speedy committee
action.
Labor Bill
The Senate Labor Committee plans
to begin Friday to write the final
Democratic draft of a substitute bill
ior the Taft-Hartley Act.
O'Mahoney asked the Senate-
House Economic Committee to meet
tomorrow to go over the majority
draft of its report.
The Wyoming senator already has
given clear indication he expects his
party colleagues to support the
President's plea for higher taxes.
Taft, as spokesman for tbe Re
publicans, has said he opposes higher
taxes because they "take from the
people the right to spend the money
they have earned and spend it for
something which the government
thinks is good for them."
Support Trtmian Bill
The O'Mahoney report is expected
to support, in general terms, the sta
bilization bill already sent to Con
gress by the administration.
It proposes, among other things,
authority for the government to
make loans for industrial expan
sion or "as a last resort" to build
industrial facilities itself.
It would set up priority and allo
cation authority over scarce mater
ials and would provide for standby
piree-wage controls.
