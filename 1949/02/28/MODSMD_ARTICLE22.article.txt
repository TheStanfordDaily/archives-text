## 
### 
A. H. Henderson, stale director of
motor vehicles, estimated that more
people operate vehicles on non
resident license plates in California
than in any other state. They are
entitled to do so if they are non
residents, and if the license plates
are valid in their state of residence.
Non-resident license plates may
not be used by persons who have
become registered voters in Cali
fornia, or completed other acts re
quiring California residence quali
fications.
