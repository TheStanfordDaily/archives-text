## Roof Controversy 
### 
One of the largest controversies in recent years to draw the
attention of Stanford alumni is the question of "Should the new
University buildings under construction or in the planning stage
retain the sloping, red-tile roofs characteristic of existing struc
tures?"
In a special message to Farm graduates, Stanford Alumni As
sociation President William S. Kellogg, '19, wrote in the February
Alumni Review:
"No matter in recent years has provoked more general discus
sion among alumni than the new architectural style adopted by
the Board of Trustees last year for major campus buildings now
under construction.
"From its very inception, the distinguishing characteristic fea
ture of Stanford architecture has been the red-tile roofs.
"The modern design now being used, which includes flat-top
roofs, involves such a radical departure from the original plan of
the Founders that the question of the desirability of this change
becomes of paramount interest to all who hold the welfare of
our University at heart.
"The Executive Committee of the Alumni Association has,
during the past six months, brought to you through the pages of
the Alumni Review information on the building program now in
progress.
"We requested comments from alumni. The overwhelming
majority of expressions received to date has been opposed to
the change in architectural style.
"However, in view of the fact that only a small number has
been heard from, in relation to the total number of Stanford
alumni, your Executive Committee deems it advisable to review
the entire situation in the March issue of this publication, setting
forth basic facts and pointing out various arguments, both for
and against the change, along with other information.
"Further, in the belief that perhaps some of the arguments in
favor of the change have either been overlooked or not made
clear, we have invited the Board of Trustees to present its views
in an article for publication in the March issue. We are asking
the Board to set forth the reasons which prompted the change,
whether or not present buildings now under construction can be
modified, and what style of architecture the Board expects to
adopt for future construction of major campus buildings.
"Along with all the possible factual information available, a
questionnaire coupon will be printed in the issue; the coupon to
be filled out by individual alumni and returned to the Association
office."
Though the above message is biased in opinion, we reprint
it in order to display to Daily readers the extent of controversy
the issue has created.
In conjunction with Alumni Review Editor Pete Allen and
Alumni Director Jack Shoup, The Daily early next quarter will
reprint all of the pros and con of the roof issue appearing in the
Alumni Review. In addition, a coupon will be printed to allow
students to mail in their opinions on the controversy to the As
sociation for consideration with Alumni replies.

"Further, in the belief that perhaps some of the arguments in
favor of the change have either been overlooked or not made
clear, we have invited the Board of Trustees to present its views
in an article for publication in the March issue. We are asking
the Board to set forth the reasons which prompted the change,
whether or not present buildings now under construction can be
modified, and what style of architecture the Board expects to
adopt for future construction of major campus buildings.

questionnaire coupon will be printed in the issue; the coupon to

it in order to display to Daily readers the extent of controversy
the issue has created.
In conjunction with Alumni Review Editor Pete Allen and
Alumni Director Jack Shoup, The Daily early next quarter will
reprint all of the pros and con of the roof issue appearing in the
Alumni Review. In addition, a coupon will be printed to allow

One of the largest controversies in recent years to draw the
attention of Stanford alumni is the question of "Should the new
University buildings under construction or in the planning stage
retain the sloping, red-tile roofs characteristic of existing struc
tures?"
In a special message to Farm graduates, Stanford Alumni As
sociation President William S. Kellogg, '19, wrote in the February
Alumni Review:
"No matter in recent years has provoked more general discus
sion among alumni than the new architectural style adopted by
the Board of Trustees last year for major campus buildings now
under construction.
"From its very inception, the distinguishing characteristic fea
ture of Stanford architecture has been the red-tile roofs.
"The modern design now being used, which includes flat-top
roofs, involves such a radical departure from the original plan of
the Founders that the question of the desirability of this change
becomes of paramount interest to all who hold the welfare of
our University at heart.
"The Executive Committee of the Alumni Association has,
during the past six months, brought to you through the pages of
the Alumni Review information on the building program now in
progress.
"We requested comments from alumni. The overwhelming
majority of expressions received to date has been opposed to
the change in architectural style.
"However, in view of the fact that only a small number has
been heard from, in relation to the total number of Stanford
alumni, your Executive Committee deems it advisable to review
the entire situation in the March issue of this publication, setting
forth basic facts and pointing out various arguments, both for
and against the change, along with other information.
