# Beer and Shuffleboard

To the Editor:
While the matter which I would like to bring to your attention and,
possibly, through you, to the attention of The Daily readers does not affect
the future of the nation or involve the Communist menace, I think it does
merit the desired attention since it involves, albeit in a minor way, the
already overburdened student pocketbook.
Recently one of the favorite beering spots for Farm students installed
a shuffleboard. This games provides a fairly interesting diversion as well
as being' a good means for measuring whether an individual playing the
game has consumed enough breaw. When the game was first installed,
it could be played for 10 cents a game, which seemed to be fair enough.
It doesn't take long to play a game, but it was well worth the price.
But the management wasn t satisfied. An electric scoreboard was in
f,tailed, and the instructions to the players require that 10 cents per player
be deposited in the slot for each game. Forty cents per game when four
people are playing is a pretty steep price. If two couples are playing
v :th tn losing team paying for the games, and if one team should lose
consistently, the poor guy supporting the losing team is going to be bled
at the rate of three bucks an hour or more. Which is the equivalent of 15
little of been (Western variety.) That's unreasonable!
II the students who patronibe this hole were to refrain from playing shuf
fleboard or, if they do play, complain bitterly to the management, it seems
likely that the tariff would soon be lowered again so that poor guys like
be could afford to play a little shuffleboard as a sideline to beer-drinking.

(Editor's Note: (irapevinc reports say that the shuffleboard company
controls the price. In any event, we agree with you on the present cost.)
