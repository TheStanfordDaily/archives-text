# Dinner Talk By Barkley Moves Demos
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
(Ed. note: The Stanford Daily
was the only college newspaper
represented at the Jefferson-Jack
son Day dinner.)
The epitome of political dinner
banquets was reached last Thursday
night at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco as 2,500 Democrats inter
rupted Vice - President Alben W.
Barkley's address time and again
with their spontaneous and thrilled
applause.
The Democrats' victory celebra
tion dinner was the largest attended
gathering of its type in the West
Coast's history. This was quite evi
dent as the Vice - President stood
before the bevy of microphones in
the main dining room which was in
turn jonied to four other dining
halls. In his talk Barkley punched
out point after point on behalf of
the Democratic party and its an
tipathy to the seeping red tide.
A generally pervasive spirit of
Democratic resurgence hung over
headquarters, the banquet, and the
social rooms from early afternoon
hours to the early hours of the next
morning. It became obviously evi
dent when the Vice-President pre
dicted a complete Democratic vic
tory in the state of California in
1950 in his talk.
Tosses Script Away
The amusing high point of the day
came when this man. who had got
ten two hours' sleep out of the pre
vious 24, whose staff had issued
copies of the intended main speech
to the members of the press, threw
the script away. What followed was
one of the most outstanding exam
ples of public oratory ever evi
denced by many of the hard-bitten
spectatorsâ€”even by those claiming
the other partisanship.
Reporters who believed that they
had done their job by phoning in
excerpts of the speech from their
early press copies to their papers
and who thought they could now
lean back and relax were discom
fited to see that an almost totally
new speech was being delivered.
Their stories had little relationship
to the talk the Vice-President ac
tually gave.
Barkley proved in his smooth de
livery that he knows his history, his
political philosophy, and the senti
ments of a great portion of the pub
lic, and he put it all over forcefully
in a booming voice.
The Vice-President of the United
States traced the Democratic party's
history of liberal legislation.
He said, "It is true that the ERP
is costing the government billions
of dollars a year, but if we can drive
back the wicked, the insidious, the
godless, the totalitarian advance of
Communism all over the world, it
will have been worth it."
IS Months Abroad
He continued, "I have been in the
last 18 months in Finland, Bulgaria,
Rumania, and Hungary. God for
bid that any regime controlled from
Moscow should ever get control of
the administration of the United
States."
Barkley's command of American
history became quite evident as he
proudly recounted the many-facet
ed genius of Thomas Jefferson.
Concluding, he said. "Would it
not be a glorious thing if our lead
ership as a nation and as a party
could become successful through
out the world so that all men ev
erywhere can celebrate the birth
day of Thomas Jefferson and An
drew Jackson!"
Of course, the talk was frankly a
partisan thing, but no less so than
the Lincoln Day speeches of two
weeks ago delivered by Republi
can leaders.
However, as one former Demo
cratic Congressman said, "If n
stranger were to have walked in
cold and were to have heard the
talk, he might have taken a dim
mer view of the Vice-President of
the United States because of the
obvious partisanship and politics
inherent in the whole address.
"But the talk gave no evident in
dication of the really fine parlia
mentarian and governmental leader
that Barkley was as Senate major
ity leader, and of the greatness of
his capabilities as Vice-President."
