# Letters to the Editor
## Wheeler's Reply

To the Editor:
How serious you people are! One might almost infer that in writing
that letter I was attacking something you are deeply concerned about.
Port of my being a "fide fellow," its the Chaplain suspects, is in my taking
my religion so seriously that 1 am able to joke about it. That I should
■•'lack a subject which many people dare not think about objectively is
likely presumptuous of me. But it is even more presumptuous of my op
ponents to believe they can put me in my place by such subjective re
marks as their letters have contained.
1 am indebted to the president of Toyon for explaining to me that the
theory, Objective analysis, subjective application," is, to be practical,
impossible. But I do not think I am deficient in pessimism concerning
anything, as my remarks on the possible success of a religious program
should demonstrate.
It does not matter that you-all do not agree with me. As a matter of
fact, I had rather you did not. But do not hang an engraved sign on my
Lack reading "Monster,' until you have given some consideration to your
emotional reactions.
I assure you that my first letter was entirely premeditated, and further
more, I assure that I still believe that a religious program on campus is
bound to fyil because of indifference. I do not wish that it should fail at
£■'11, nor do I want so many people to continue to be religiously "illiterate."
It is either immaturity or idealism on my part. I am sure, that causes
rue to say that the methods the Chaplain is using are offensive. But I
believe that many people resist such a program as the one proposed, not
because of its content, but the manner of its presentation.
Those who are indifferent will only find the Chaplain's aggressive man
ner a further reason to be indifferent. Those who are already interested
will participat. Some of the peopl who writ "devastating" letters will
ignore the program because they are "busy" or because they have given
the proper response their society calls for to this particular stimulus.
Now they can slip back into their evasion of religion; they have done their
duty, and 1 imagine they must be very proud.
I personally do not find it necessary to pursue religion by means of a
group. I cannot believe that other people may present a definite pattern
that will be satisfactory for me. My religion does not permit me to connect
it into an electrical circuit, with one button for "on" and another for "off."
1 should enjoy meeting with groups, to see how other people are getting
c lung, but—please—don't ask me to stop trying to make people think.
I have a feeling that many of you must think your letters have left me
rigid, in the proper condition to fill one of those palm-niches. I would
be happy to stand there, il 1 thought your looking' at me would put an
idta into your heads.
