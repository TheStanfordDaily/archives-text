# Name-Calling Is Immature
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I am not attempting to justify Fred Wheeler's rather satirical approach
to the question of a religious activities council, as I personally think it
wss not in the best of taste.
However, I do think that The Daily was justified in printing his letter,
as everyone deserves the right to express his opinions in print. As fax
as I could see, Fred Wheeler did not express any approval of the Com
munist Party or of Mr. Wallace, nor did he express a desire for intolerance
«.nd persecution, as. in a country whose citizens are Christians, at least
in name, this would be cutting his own throat.
1 also think that calling names is hardly a mature method of refutation,
i.ra name-calling has been quite evident in a number of the letters replying
to Mr. Wheeler. It requires neither wit nor intelligence to call someone
an adolescent or a Communist.
I would also like to ask Dr. Johnston if there will be room for those
individuals and groups of faiths and opinions other than Christianity on
his Council of Religious Activities, or is this organization to be a "closed
shop?"
I believe that those of different religions and opinions would appreciate
the privilege of discussing religious matters in an atmosphere of mutual
respect, tolerance, and equality, the only basis for a genuine and lasting
understanding.
