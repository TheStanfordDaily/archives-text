# What Are "Good Religions"?

T'» the Editor:
"We're out for good religion. There are religions good and bad. Some
of them aren't worth the room they occupy in this world, some are fan
tastic foolishness. Evidently a lot of young people have met up only with
thct kind." These are the words of our Chaplain.
I would like to ask the Chaplain which faiths are "good religion" and
which ones "aren't worth the room they occupy in this world." If the
C'laplain dares to claim he meant something else than what is literally
siated in his column. I'd like to remind him he is talking to students who
don't appreciate remarks that aren't sincere in their implication.
The Chaplain is trying to make campus religion dynamic, but let him
realize that at Stanford those who want religion will go out and find it,
and many others who for the most part have their own beliefs, don't want
to be "pushed"—even into "good religion."
I believe that an atheist or agnostic has just as much rifeht to his way
of thinking as our Chaplain does his. This implication the Chaplain
makes about some misguided souls meeting bad religion is bordering on
the intolerant and in bad taste. 1 say "bad taste" because religion was not
iit ended to be forced or controversial here at Stanford. Our Chaplain
his unfortunately violated both of these understandings.
