# Frosh Class Dues Nearing Final Goal
## 
### 
Collection of Freshman Class dues
now totals $2,800, announced Jack
White, '32 prexy. This amount is
approximately 75 per cent ol' the
final goal.
This week will be the last in
which collections will be taken.
Every frosh is urged to try to pay
his dues now, so that books may be
set up and plans started.
"We've had a good response so
far." said White, "but let's try to
make it a little closer to 100 per
cent."
