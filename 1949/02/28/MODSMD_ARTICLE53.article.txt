# Double Defeat Shoves Indians Toward Cellar
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's staggering cagers, sink
ing deeper into the depths of utter
futility, took another twin trounc
inÂ« last weekend to drop their sev
enth straight basketball game.
UCLA kept its Westwood record
perfect by dropping the Cards 56-50
Friday night, and USC's Trojans
kept pace with an easy 60-51 win in
the Olympic on Saturday night.
California's Golden Bears also

dropped a pair of games over the
weekend, leaving USC and UCLA
knotted for first place in the South
ern Division and giving Los Angeles
| sole possession of the two top clubs
in the loop.
Stanford led the UCLA game un
til the last 10 minutes, but couldn't
stay with the Bruins when they
; started to press. Stanford had it 35-
32 at half time, and managed to
j stretch that into 4G-38 shortly after
! the rest period. But then came the
| fold.
Sheldrake Ruins Cards
Alan Sawyer did most of the
! damage with 22 points, but it was
sub Eddie Sheldrake's clutch bas
kets in the second half that ruined
the Cards.
USC, gaining speed with every
| step, rolled to its eighth straight
victory over Stanford. Sam Barry's
Trojans have made clean sweeps of
| the Stanford series two years in a
row.

As usual, Dave Davidson was the
leading offensive threat for the
Tribe. Dave poured through a total
of 26 points for two nights' work,
but slipped behind UCLA's Sawyer,
who added 36 to gain second place
in the race for individual honors.
Shartnan Leads Scorers
Bill Sharman, undoubtedly the
outstanding player in the Far West,
riddled the net for 49 points, giv
ing him a safety-first lead with 177
points.
Sharman's 177 gives him a wide
margin over Sawyer's 139 and Da
vidson's 133.
Dave Davidson captured much
praise from Los Angeles sports
writers and from the radio men as
being one of the top performers in
the division.
Davidson combines a great offen
sive eye with a steady defense, and
should be ranked right alongside
Bill Sharman for top individual
honors on the coast.
Indians Drop in Rank
Stanford's season record, reduced
to ridiculous proportions by the re
cent win famine, stands at 17 wins
and nine losses. At one time, the
Cards owned a 17 and two record
and were ranked as the ninth best
team in the nation.
They will finish the season next
weekend against Cal's equally im
potent Bears, who have a mathe
matical chance of lying Stanford for
the cellar.
Only California's terrible 1 and 9
Dixie record is worse than Stan
ford's 3 and 7.
