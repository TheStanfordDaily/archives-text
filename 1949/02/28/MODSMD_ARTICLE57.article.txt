# Cal Boxers Edge Cards; Mitchell Wins Heavyweight
## 
### 
Emery Mitchell made a successful ]
•eturn to collegiate boxing circles j
Friday night at the Pavilion by j
winning the heavyweight main j
ivent from Cal's John Groff; but j
he Bears won the match anyway,
j to 4.
Fighting before an overflow Pa- j
vilion mob, Mitchell started slowly. I
:hen pounded the outsized Groff
into complete submission in the !
hird round to cop the unanimous
decision of the judges.
Actually, Mitch's inspiring per- j
formance had no effect on the final j
outcome of the match, for Cal led
live points to three, going into the
heavyweight battle.
The victory in the main eventer j
did give the Cards an even 4-4 break
in bouts fought, but the Bears' mar- |
'in of victory was the Stanford
forfeit in the 125-lb. class.
Hammond Beaten
The light-heavy semi-windup be- j
tween Joltin' Jim Hammond and ;
Berkeley's equally jolting Jim Em- |
erson was, as expected, the freest
swinging, hardest-punching bout of
tlie evening.
The more experienced Emerson
ought a crafty and cautious bout;
ind although Hammond was the
aggressor for most of the battle.
Emerson managed to score more
often with his lethal hooks and won i
a TKO verdict in the second round.
It was Hammond's first defeat of
the year.
The lightweight division produced
he two best fights of the evening.
The Cards' Jay Savage was the j
■vinner in the first one, staging a j
spirited comeback in the final two ■
•ounds to stagger opponent Ed Grit- j
in and gain a close decision.
The first round was a battle be
ween Griffin's right hand and Sav- i
ige's jabbing left, with Griffin tak- ;
ng a slight advantage. Jay be
anie the aggressor in the second, ,
lowever, arid his two-handed as
sau't had Griffin reeling by the final
jell. It was Savage by a wide mar- J
;in.
Rael Gains TKO
Jose Rael, the other lightweight '
vinner for the Indians, turned in
cool, craftsmanlike performance
gainst Rod Doerr to score a TKO
n the third round.
With the huge crowd roaring its j
pproval, the Card boxer worked ■
lowly and methodically, landing J
>ne punch at a time, until the out- !
lassed Doerr was unable even to !
■rotect himself midway in the final j
ieat.
Fred Ten Eyck tallied the other :
tanford point in the IGS - pound j
eature. Ten Eyck won going away '
rom wiry Irv Tucker, a converted ;
iglu-heavy, and hardly mussed his
air in so doing.
Tucker, who lokoed at least fO \
ounds heavier than Ten Eyck, was I
ever effective and lost all three J
ounds to th classier Card puncher. 1
Altus Stopped
Willie Aitus. Stanford 155-pound
r, was the victim of a one-punch
rst-round TKO which was fin
shed almost before it had begun.
Powerful Hank Harvey was the
ictor in this one. when he floored
.Itus during the first exchange with
tremendous right to the button
hich left Willie wobbly and glassy
yed.
The bout left a lot of questions :
nanswered. as Altus is a mighty j
nooth performer who very likely h
ould have given Harvey a good j
ittle had not the dusky Bear land
-1 the knockout blow—which might
■ might not have been a lucky
.inch.
Bobby Baker was the first Stan
>rd loser of the evening, dropping
le 130-pound opener by a wide
largin to John Parham.
The Bears' Ed Farris took the 145-
Dimd decision from A 1 Anderson
i the well-fought pre-intermission
nale.
The Lunnymen get their chance !
r revenge at Berkeley Friday
*ht when, with a few exceptions.
urno lads will battle it out on
if Bears' home grovnd: .
