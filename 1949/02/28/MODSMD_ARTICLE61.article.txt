# Farm Matmen Tie Favored Cal Team In Season Final
## 
### WIN DANSTON 
Stanford's hard - working grap
plers battled California's favored
wrestling team to a draw in the
Encina Gym Friday night by taking
four of eight varsity matches to
knot the score at 12 to 12.
Although the Bears salvaged a
tie in the fray, the Indians looked
like the better team. Each team
won four decisions, but the Cards
won their four by large margins
while the Bears had trouble win
ning in three of the four matches
they captured. V
Cal got off to a good start when
Perry Langford beat Jay Hughes in
the 121 by a 6 to 4 decision. Dick
Hanson made it two in a row for
the Bears by taking Dick Cruee 7
to 4 in the 128-pound bout. Both
Hanson and Langford were called
for stalling but they held on to grab
close decisions.
Williams Downs Hart
Don Williams helped the Indian
cause when he gained a 5 to 2 de
cision over Bill Hart in the 136-
pound tussle. Williams had Hart in
trouble throughout the match and
missed a fall by a slim margin.
In the 145 - pound class it was
strictly no contest as Vein Jones,
Indian captain, took a decision over
Roy Watson. There was never any
doubt as to who would win the
match and the only question was
whether the Bear grappler could
keep Jones from throwing him.
Jones wound up four years as a
varsity wrestler at Stanford in the
Cal match, and finished this season
undefeated.
Indians Take Lead
With the score tied at 6 to 6. Dan
Winston put the Cards ahead by
taking Bill Bardin by a count cf 5
to 0 for a decision. The victory
brought the count to 9 to 6 in favor
of Stanford.
Cal came back with victories in
the IGS and 175. Armond Bloch took
a 5 to 2 decision from Bruce Gait in
the 165, but the result of the match
was in doubt until the final seconds.
Captain Mark Bunge gave the
Bears their only clean-cut win by
decisioning Dick DeWitt in the 175-
pound match. Bunge had too much
experience for DeWitt. but the Card
wrestler gave him trouble for the
first two periods.
With the Bears leading 12 to 9
Steve Garst assured the Indians a
tie with a decision over Dick Nor
ton. The Card heavyweight didn't
smile this time but went all out to
throw Norton. Garst couldn't quite
get the job done, but he did grab
the decision to remain undefeated
this season.
