### BOB BERNSTEIN 
California won the boxing match
at the Pavilion Friday night; but
nobody seemed to care.
The 2,000 delighted, screaming
fans were far more interested in
the successful comeback of Emery
Mitchell, the balding bomber who.
in the words of his coach, "didn't
know when the hell to quit."
Mitch was not in top condition.
Far from it. He was winded and
tired from the very first. Hi.-, timing
was badly of?. And he became even
more tired by the end of the second
round, after aborbing a number of
towering John Groft's best punches
and wrestling the bulky Bear in the
clinches.
To the second-guescrs sitting just
below Mitch's coiner, it seemed
perfectly clear at the end of the
second round that the Eureka dy
namo would have to rely on his
defense to carry him through the
final heat gracefully. No doubt
about it, he was a weary man.
He was tired, but not beaten. And
the partisan Pavilion mob arose
from their seats and roared their
lusty recognition of a great com
petitor when the big M. finally
caught up willi the outsized Bear
in the third stanza and rocked him
with such devastating power that
only the bell saved the dazed and
helpless Groff from a knockout.
Quit? Mitch never heard of the
word.

j Irv Tucker, the California 165-

pound entry, tendered the big crowd
some hearty amusement with h,i
pre-fight warm-up activities. In ad -
dition to the usual toot-shuffling
and shadow boxing procedures.
Tucker further prepared himself for
the battle by pounding his own chia
with a salvo of lefts and rights.
Bui it was really very unneces
sary. The Cards' Fred Ten Eycfc
took care of that job very capably
once the fight began.
* * *
That boy Groff was really b:£.
At one point during a clinch in th'-j
second round, he lifted Mitch right
off his feet and deposited ths;
heavyweight some ten feet away.
When Mitch got his first glimpse
of the mountain - that - moves, his
grinned widely with an expression
that said plainly, "Big, ain't he'."'
Ht * *
The only scars Ten Eyck carried
out • of the ring were two black
eyes—the same two he had when ha
entered.
They're souvenirs of Fred's spar
ring sessions last week with Jai.

Tucker further prepared himself for
the battle by pounding his own chia

Bui it was really very unneces

took care of that job very capably
once the fight began.

That boy Groff was really b:£.
At one point during a clinch in th'-j
second round, he lifted Mitch right
off his feet and deposited ths;
heavyweight some ten feet away.
When Mitch got his first glimpse
of the mountain - that - moves, his
grinned widely with an expression
that said plainly, "Big, ain't he'."'

The only scars Ten Eyck carried
out • of the ring were two black

Rice, former Stanford and Paciti.:
Coast middleweight champ.
California won the boxing match
at the Pavilion Friday night; but
nobody seemed to care.
The 2,000 delighted, screaming
fans were far more interested in
the successful comeback of Emery
Mitchell, the balding bomber who.
in the words of his coach, "didn't
know when the hell to quit."
Mitch was not in top condition.
Far from it. He was winded and
tired from the very first. Hi.-, timing
was badly of?. And he became even
more tired by the end of the second
round, after aborbing a number of
towering John Groft's best punches
and wrestling the bulky Bear in the
clinches.
To the second-guescrs sitting just
below Mitch's coiner, it seemed
perfectly clear at the end of the
second round that the Eureka dy
namo would have to rely on his
defense to carry him through the
final heat gracefully. No doubt
about it, he was a weary man.
He was tired, but not beaten. And
the partisan Pavilion mob arose
from their seats and roared their
lusty recognition of a great com
petitor when the big M. finally
caught up willi the outsized Bear
in the third stanza and rocked him
with such devastating power that
only the bell saved the dazed and
helpless Groff from a knockout.
Quit? Mitch never heard of the
word.
