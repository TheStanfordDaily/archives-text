# Red Ex-Prof To Talk Today
## 
### 
Herbert J. Phillips, ex-University
of Washington professor fired as an
avowed Communist, will speak this
afternoon from 3 to 5 in the Boy
Scout amphitheater at the Palo Alto
Community Center, 1305 Middlefield
Road.
Chairman Andy Jordan of the
Committee on Academic Freedom,
a Stanford group formed to secure
a speaking place for Phillips here,
announced that his group had finally
succeeded in obtaining a definite
.spot for the meeting, after they had
been turned down by Palo Alto
Mayor Walter S. Caspar and the
Stanford Committee on Public Ex
ercises.
Jordan added that no opposition
speaker would be present because
President Raymond Allen of the
University of Washington, in answer
to a request by the Stanford com
mittee: had telegraphed that he
would not be able to send a speaker
to explain Washington's position in
the case.
Phillips is one of three Wash
ington professors recently dismissed
as avowed Communists. He is cur
rently on a West Coast speaking
tour, and was reported to have
spoken before 2,000 students at
Berkeley's West Gate Friday. He
will soon launch a nation-wide
speaking tour to explain his beliefs
on academic freedom.
