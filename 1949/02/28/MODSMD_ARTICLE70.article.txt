# Few Places Available for 60-Day Conducted European Excursion
## 
### 
A limited number of places are'
available for a conducted tour of
Europe this summer. Mrs. Robert
Reynolds at Parney Storey House
has arranged the tour, and anyone
interested in going should contact
her immediately as there are only
about five or six places left open.
The group will sail July 13 from
New York on the M.V. Britannic
and will spend approximately 60
days on the continent, returning
Sept. 20. The trip will probably
cost between $1,400 and $1,500
apiece. Mrs. Reynolds points out
that this is really very reasonable
as she has managed to get cabin
rates on the Britannic, which is a
first-class ship. After they arrive in
Europe, the students will pay a flat
rate of $12 or $14 a day which will
include everything from room and
board to guide fees and tips.
England will be the first stop on
the itinerary, and the group will
spend a week there. From there
they will go to Paris for a week,
then on to the chateau country, and
finally to the Riviera for a few days.
During a three-week tour of Italy,
the students will visit Rome, Milan,
Venice, and Genoa. From Italy,
they will go to Lake Como in Switz
erland. If time permits, Mrs. Rey
nolds will take the group to the
Tyrol, and will try to reach Salz
burg in time for the music and
drama festivals which are held in
July and August.
Reservations are at a premium
and definitely must be secured by
the end of the month; so Mrs. Rey
nolds must know immediately how
many people want to go. As yet
she has been unable to make return
reservations on a ship, so there is
a possibility "that the group may
have to fly back. She is still at
tempting to secur ;pace, however.
