# Dean Sees Enrollment Drop, No Tuition Change Next Year
## 
### 
No increase or decrease in tuition
is in sight tor next year, said Dean
of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton
in his regular weekly KSU broad
cast, "Interview with Dean Kimp
ton," last Thursday night at 10:30.
The dean made this statement
while discussing the topic "Spend
ing the Student Dollar" with a panel
of six students: Jiggs Macauley, ex
student manager; Mark Hatfield,
graduate member of Excom; John
Pool, student manager; Lorry Lo
key. editor of The Daily; Gigi Mar
ion, president of AWS; and Ted
Norton, former Excom member and
member of the Union Planning
Board. Townsend Brown was the
moderator.
"I am quite confident that the
tuition next year will remain the
same as this year," Kimpton said.
He also asured the other members
of the panel that he expected no
change in room and board costs.
Only a reduction in enrollment
on the graduate, not the undergrad
uate, level would cut costs enough
to lower tuition, the dean said, in
answer to Norton's quetion as to
whether it would be more economi
cal to have a lower enrollment.
"However," he added, "since quite a
bit of Stanford's reputation comes
from its graduate work, it should
not be minimized."
Enrollment will be approximately
200 less next year, he said. But
there is little possibility that Bran
ner wil be turn'.ed over to the men
next year, since total enrollment
will not be low enough to releace
the dormitory.
In reply to a question by Pool as
to whether the BAC would be re
constituted so as to provide money
for minor sports, the dean said that
would be decided after President
Sterling arrives.
Lokey asked whether men liv
ing in Toyon in a four-man room
were justified in thinking that their
room rent was too high. Kimpton
explained that the University does
not make money on the residences
or on the dining halls. It all evens
out in the end, he added.
In breaking down Stanford's
yearly income, the dean said that it
costs $8,000.000 a year to run the
University. Two million of this is
raised through gifts, $2,000,000 comes
from the endowment, and the re
maining $4,000,000 is student tuition.
When asked what is being done
by the University to increase the
amount of money coming in through
gifts, he said that a tremendous
amount was being done now and
that more would be done when
President Sterling arrives.
"This gift money comes to the
University in two forms," he dean
said. "One is an unrestricted gift
which can be used for any purpose
the University sees fit; the other is
a restricted gift which must be used
for certain purposes specified by the
donor."

Norton, former Excom member and
member of the Union Planning
Board. Townsend Brown was the
moderator.
"I am quite confident that the
tuition next year will remain the
same as this year," Kimpton said.
He also asured the other members
of the panel that he expected no
change in room and board costs.
Only a reduction in enrollment
on the graduate, not the undergrad
uate, level would cut costs enough
to lower tuition, the dean said, in
answer to Norton's quetion as to
whether it would be more economi
cal to have a lower enrollment.
"However," he added, "since quite a
bit of Stanford's reputation comes
from its graduate work, it should
not be minimized."
Enrollment will be approximately
200 less next year, he said. But
there is little possibility that Bran
ner wil be turn'.ed over to the men
next year, since total enrollment
will not be low enough to releace
the dormitory.
In reply to a question by Pool as
to whether the BAC would be re
constituted so as to provide money
for minor sports, the dean said that
would be decided after President
Sterling arrives.
Lokey asked whether men liv
ing in Toyon in a four-man room
were justified in thinking that their
room rent was too high. Kimpton
explained that the University does
not make money on the residences
or on the dining halls. It all evens
out in the end, he added.
In breaking down Stanford's
yearly income, the dean said that it
costs $8,000.000 a year to run the
University. Two million of this is
raised through gifts, $2,000,000 comes
from the endowment, and the re
maining $4,000,000 is student tuition.
When asked what is being done
by the University to increase the
amount of money coming in through
gifts, he said that a tremendous
amount was being done now and
that more would be done when
President Sterling arrives.
"This gift money comes to the
University in two forms," he dean
said. "One is an unrestricted gift
which can be used for any purpose
the University sees fit; the other is
a restricted gift which must be used
for certain purposes specified by the
donor."
No increase or decrease in tuition
is in sight tor next year, said Dean
of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton
in his regular weekly KSU broad
cast, "Interview with Dean Kimp
ton," last Thursday night at 10:30.
The dean made this statement
while discussing the topic "Spend
ing the Student Dollar" with a panel
of six students: Jiggs Macauley, ex
student manager; Mark Hatfield,
graduate member of Excom; John
Pool, student manager; Lorry Lo
key. editor of The Daily; Gigi Mar
ion, president of AWS; and Ted
Norton, former Excom member and
