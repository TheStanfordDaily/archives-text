"I was dismissed solely on the grounds that, as a member of
the Communist Party, I was incapable of objective teaching,"
former University of Washington Professor Herbert Phillips told
a crowd of over 200 students and Palo Alto residents at a meet
ing in the city pary yesterday afternoon.
Standing on a park bench, Phillips told his audience that the

American Communist Party did not"*
advocate violent overthrow of the
government. "If this were so," he
said, "I would not be a member."
Phillips also said that it was true
that the Communists often agree
with Russian policy, but said that
the reason for this was that both
interpret history along the basic
concepts developed by Marx, and
therefore quite naturally agreed.
Move To City Park
Phillips' speech, sponsored by the
Stanford Academic Freedom Com
mittee, was originally scheduled for
the Boy Scout Amphitheater.
When the audience arrived, how
ever, they found that Mayor Walter

Two reasons were given to a
Daily reporter by Mayor Caspar
for turning down the Stanford
Academic Freedom Committee's
scheduled rally at the Boy Scout
Amphitheater:
1. Washington University did
not send down a speaker to pre
sent the other side of the ques
tion.
2. The students had misrepre
sented themselves when asking
permission to use the amphithea
ter. The representative of the
committee had indicated that the
meeting was a strictly social affair.

S. Gaspar and members of the city
council had directed the placing of a
loud speaker to drown out the pro
gram.
When representatives from the
"roup protested the action, Mayor
Gaspar said the speaker was put up
for a children's folk dance pro
gram scheduled to be held that
afternoon. He advised the group to
move to the city park.
"Act lake Children": Mayor
Within five minutes after the stu
dents moved on to the park the city
officials had the speaker taken down.
While this was going on, one man
said to the mayor, "You must think
that we are a bunch of children the
way you had this loudspeaker and
music set up."
"The way you are acting," the
mayor replied, "you look like chil
dren.-'
