# Clay Asks Retirement
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 28 MY—Gen. Lu
cius D. Clay said tonight he has
asked informally to be retired from
his duties as United States military
governor of Germany.
It appears likely there may be a
complete change in American ad
ministration here by early sum
mer. Clay's retirement would cer
tainly be followed by wholesale
resignations among the top advis
ers in the military government.
Three generals have been men
tioned as possible successors. They
are: Gen. Mark Clark, former mili
tary governor of Austria; Lt. Gen.
Walter Bedell Smith, who has asked
to be relieved of his post as am
bassador to Moscow; and Lt. Gen.
Albert C. Wedemeyer.
Clay told an informal news con
ference in Frankfurt that he had no
information about who might suc
ceed him. The general asked to be
freed from his duties here "at the
earliest moment the government
felt it could release me."
The Chicago Tribune said last
night it had learned authoritatively
that Clay would retire by June and
possibly within the next 60 days.
Clay originally applied for re
tirement a year ago. He has become
a symbol of resistance against So
viet pressure in Germany. This has
been one of the chief factors in the
general's staying here.
Even now the Russians would
propagandize Clay's retirement as a
victory for them. However, the air
lift to blockaded Berlin symbolizes
American policy at present, and
Clay's retirement would not have
the adverse effect on German mor
ale now it would have had last year.
