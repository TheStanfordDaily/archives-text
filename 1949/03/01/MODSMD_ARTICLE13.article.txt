# Terman Talks On IQ Exams
## 
### 
The merit of IQ tests, such as the
Stanford-Benet Intelligence Test,
was upheld Sunday by the man who
revised the test and made IQ a fa
miliar term.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, Stanford
professor emeritus of psychology,
spoke to a group of experts of the
International Council for Exceptional
Children at the Fairmont Hotel. He
defended the tests, saying not enough
emphasis is being* placed on their
value.
The statement was directed in op
position to that made by Allison
Davis, University of Chicago pro
fessor of education, who said re
cently that IQ tests were meaning
less and invalid.
Dr. Terman told of a 40-year study
of groups of children with an IQ of
140 or better, and added "We have
been swayed too much by the all-
American feeling for the fellow at
the foot."

1 The answer, he said, was more
j recognition and opportunity for a
j child to make the most of the tal
ents he possesses, including particu
| lar attention to those children who
j have an intelligence quotient of 135
!or better. '"Our chance of survival
I in another war may well depend
; upon the discovery and utilization of
' highly superior abilities of every
kind," he said.
