of engineering will be the program
for the Men's Vocom meeting to

school of mineral sciences; Harold
F. Elliott, a consulting engineer in
San Francisco; and Dr. Nathan
Bower, a civil engineer and editor
of the Engineering New Record, will

fields of electrical, mechanical, civil,
and mining engineering.
According to Pat deYoung, Vocom
chairman, the discussion should aid
students in making a vocational
choice, give undergrad engineers an
idea of what to expect in the engi

plain how to prepare for that world.
This is one of the series of lec
tures planned by Men's Vocom in
