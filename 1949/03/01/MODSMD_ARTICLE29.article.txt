## Picture Puzzle 
### 
Wanting to divert the attention of his troublesome young
daughter, a father cut a map of the world from a newspaper,
sheared it into a number of odd-shaped pieces, and told her to
put it together again.
He was hoping for an hour of quiet, but in five minutes the
2ittle girl had completed the task.
"How did you manage to work your puzzle so quickly?" he
asked.
"Oh, it was easy," replied the child. "I turned the pieces over
and saw there was a man's picture on the other side. I just put
the man together right, and when that was done, the world was
right."
