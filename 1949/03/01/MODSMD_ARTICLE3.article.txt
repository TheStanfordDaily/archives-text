# USC Debaters Edge Stanford
## 
### 
Two experienced Indian debaters
from USC, present Pacific Coast de
bate champions, edged the Stanford
team by a split 2-1 vote last night
to win the traveling trophy which
is donated by the Stanford chapter
of Delta Sigma Rho. Omar Ku
reishi and Kamal Faruki argued the
negative side of the federal aid to
education question while Dow Car
penter and Carl Stover capably
presented the affirmative.
Robert Littler, president of the
Palo Alto School Board, introduced
the speakers, and Robert L. Ben
nett, president of Delta Sigma Rho,
presented the cup award.
Carpenter started by introducing
the three contentions of the affirm
ative. He stated that certain areas
were making substandard appropri
ations to education, that this lack of
appropriations denies children an
adequate chance for education, and
these areas are capable financially
of doing no more. He said a pro
gram supported by the federal gov
ernment but administered by the
states would help to dissolve the
main evids—low teachers' salaries,
poor teaching plants, and lack of
adequate supplies.
Omar Kureishi, captain of the
Trojan debate team, presented a
humorous and crowd-pleasing ora
tion which emphasized the fact that
.southern states, mostly concerned
by the problem, had the monetary
resources if they wanted to spend
them for education.
Stover responded in his 15-min
ute speech by claiming that due to
low fiscal capacity these areas were
not able to provide adequate edu
cational opportunity, and he went
on to say that education was the
means to achieve the end of in
creasing a state's fiscal potential.
In his rebuttal, Kureishi went
into a resonant oratorical style and
questioned the possibility that
Southern political machines could
use the federal funds for anything
they might desire — education or
not.
Despite Stover's fast and very
thorough rebuttal which brought
great applause, the judges awarded
the 2-1 ballot decision to the visit
ing team.
