For some time now we've been a fond admirer of "The New Yorker"
magazine and not merely because of its hilarious cartoons, or Audax Minor's
eraciite evaluations of the horses, or Wolcott Gibbs' sage observations of
the stage, or John McCarten's rapier thrusts at the Hollywood bubble,
or the many very, very, good pieces by myriads of Harold Ross' minions.
All of these go into the making up of an extremely palatable magazine,
a trifle blase in the face of its high-priced advertisers (high-priced from
the consumer's standpoint) and mightily concerned with the cause of
liberty in this land of liberty.
From time to time, and frequently, too, this magazine has ranged itself
on the side of individuals or groups who for the moment are on the outs
w'th the stooges of those who fervently believe that largeness is synony
n.ous with greatness.
Nobody standing to the left (politically) of Time and Life, Inc., would
ctnsider "The New Yorker" a tool of the Kremlin (and we don't know
if it has ever been called "Red" publicly or in print). But the magazine
does take it upon itself to occasionally indulge in some testy counter
punching with witch-hunters, both the official and unofficial varieties.
In this week's (Feb. 26th) issue, the lead article puts on the gloves with
those forces that caused the dismissal of three University of Washing-ton
professors for allegedly Communistic activities.
We don't know who wrote the article, although we strongly suspect the
Land of E. B. White, who has given the magazine a strong One-World
aspect in the past.
We haven't gotten permission from"The New Yorker" to reprint any of
this article, but we're betting the magazine won't sue us (or The Daily)
for quoting it.
". . . . although it's easy to dismiss a professor or make him sign an
affidavit, it is not so easy to dismiss the issue of academic freedom, which
persists on campuses as the smell of wintergreen oil persists in the locker
loom. In this land, an ousted professor is not an island entire of itself;
Li; death diminishes us all.
"There is no question but that colleges and universities these days are
under pressure from alumni and trustees to clean house and to provide
dynamic instruction in the American way of life. . . .
"We on this magazine believe in the principle of hiring and firing 1 on the
basis of fitness, and we have no opinion as to the fitness or unfitness of
the fired professors.
"We also believe that some of the firings in this country in the last 18
months have resembled a political purge, rather than a dismissal for indi
vidual unfitness, and we think this is bad for everybody .... Indirectly,
it abets Communism by making millions of highly fit Americans a little
cautious, a little fearful of having naughty "thoughts," a little fearful of
believing differently from the next man, a little worried about associating
with a group or party or club.
A healthy university in a healthy democracy is a free society in minia
ture .... A campus is unique. It is above and beyond government. It
is on the highest plane of life. Those who live there know the smell of
good air, and they always take pains to spell truth with a small "t." This
is its secret strength and its contribution to ... . freedom; this is why
the reading' room of a college library is the very temple of freedom."
We just thought you'd like to know that there are some people still left
in this country who think "The Wind of Freedom Blows" is a good idea.

punching with witch-hunters, both the official and unofficial varieties.
In this week's (Feb. 26th) issue, the lead article puts on the gloves with
those forces that caused the dismissal of three University of Washing-ton
professors for allegedly Communistic activities.
We don't know who wrote the article, although we strongly suspect the
Land of E. B. White, who has given the magazine a strong One-World
aspect in the past.
We haven't gotten permission from"The New Yorker" to reprint any of
this article, but we're betting the magazine won't sue us (or The Daily)
for quoting it.
". . . . although it's easy to dismiss a professor or make him sign an
affidavit, it is not so easy to dismiss the issue of academic freedom, which
persists on campuses as the smell of wintergreen oil persists in the locker
loom. In this land, an ousted professor is not an island entire of itself;
Li; death diminishes us all.
"There is no question but that colleges and universities these days are
under pressure from alumni and trustees to clean house and to provide
dynamic instruction in the American way of life. . . .
"We on this magazine believe in the principle of hiring and firing 1 on the
basis of fitness, and we have no opinion as to the fitness or unfitness of
the fired professors.
"We also believe that some of the firings in this country in the last 18
months have resembled a political purge, rather than a dismissal for indi
vidual unfitness, and we think this is bad for everybody .... Indirectly,
it abets Communism by making millions of highly fit Americans a little
cautious, a little fearful of having naughty "thoughts," a little fearful of
believing differently from the next man, a little worried about associating
with a group or party or club.
A healthy university in a healthy democracy is a free society in minia
ture .... A campus is unique. It is above and beyond government. It
is on the highest plane of life. Those who live there know the smell of
good air, and they always take pains to spell truth with a small "t." This
is its secret strength and its contribution to ... . freedom; this is why
the reading' room of a college library is the very temple of freedom."
We just thought you'd like to know that there are some people still left
in this country who think "The Wind of Freedom Blows" is a good idea.
For some time now we've been a fond admirer of "The New Yorker"
magazine and not merely because of its hilarious cartoons, or Audax Minor's
eraciite evaluations of the horses, or Wolcott Gibbs' sage observations of
the stage, or John McCarten's rapier thrusts at the Hollywood bubble,
or the many very, very, good pieces by myriads of Harold Ross' minions.
All of these go into the making up of an extremely palatable magazine,
a trifle blase in the face of its high-priced advertisers (high-priced from
the consumer's standpoint) and mightily concerned with the cause of
liberty in this land of liberty.
From time to time, and frequently, too, this magazine has ranged itself
on the side of individuals or groups who for the moment are on the outs
w'th the stooges of those who fervently believe that largeness is synony
n.ous with greatness.
Nobody standing to the left (politically) of Time and Life, Inc., would
ctnsider "The New Yorker" a tool of the Kremlin (and we don't know
if it has ever been called "Red" publicly or in print). But the magazine
does take it upon itself to occasionally indulge in some testy counter
punching with witch-hunters, both the official and unofficial varieties.
