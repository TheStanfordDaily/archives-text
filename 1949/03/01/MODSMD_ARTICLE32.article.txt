Card playing can be expensive—
but then so can any game where
you hold hands.
Poker is one game in which a great
deal depends on a good deal. This
game was introduced into the U.S. in
New Orleans by French sailors.
They called it "poque," but the
Southern gentlemen who wound up
popularizing it on the side-wheel
riverboats spoke poor French; thus,
the game came to be known as "pok
uh." And so goes evolution.
Playing cards, themselves, have
been traced as far back as 800 A.D.,
when they were popular in Hindu
stan. They spread east and west
from there.
Currently there are 52 cards in a
deck, 13 in each of four suits. This
is supposed to symbolize the year
of 52 weeks and season divided into
13 lunar months.
Hindustan Suits
The old Hindustan deck, however,
had 10 suits to it, each one symbol
izing one of the 10 incarnations of
the god Vishnu. Just think, there
are 2,598,960 possible poker hands
in the modern 52-card deck . . . .
With 10 suits the number must be
prodigious.
Let's face it, the odds are against
you whenever you sit down at the
gaming tables. Even the chances of
getting a 29-count hand in cribbage
is 812,175 to 1.
Take as a classic example a young
Chinese lad named Yao, as reported
by the Shanghai Press. He gam
bled away his money, his clothes,
and then—himself. The guy had it
bad. After a 24-hour session at the
tables, he volunteered for military
service in place of a drafted man—
against a wager of 30 million Chinese
dollars, or $100 American cash. This
is the army, Mr. Yao!
Chinese are supposed to be the
most inveterate gamblers, but Amer
icans play 150 different card games
alone, plus many variations in some.
Big Three Games
And according to Gallup's poll,
bridge, pinochle, and poker are the
big three on the American scene.
About 52.500,000 of the nations esti
mated 94.000.000 adults play cards,
and of these approximately 12,000.-
000 prefer either contract or auction
bridge, approximately 10.500.000
would call for pinochle, and approxi
mately 10,000,000 would play poker.
Behind these come all the rummy
games (exclusive of gin), five hun
ched, and a large miscellaneous
group led by pitch, whist, euchre,
cribbage, solitaire, hearts, and casino.
