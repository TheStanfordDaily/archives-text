To the Editor:
So Mr. Volpe got a tiekct! (Letters, Feb. 23.) I checked hurriedly, and
sureenough, he hails from California. And I say it's about time.
' am assuming that Mr. Volpe is a typical, blood-maddened California
f'river. Its getting so that even on campus one can get across the street
between white lines and large stop signs only when a car driven by a
timid out-of-state tourist comes along.
San Francisco is the first place I've ever seen where old ladies on
crutches have to run across the streets. I only wish California had three
times as many cops.
