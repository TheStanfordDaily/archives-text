# How Is a Religion Judged?

### 
To the Editor:
"We're out for 'good religion.' There are religions good and bad. Some
of them aren't worth the room they occupy in this world; some are fan
tastic foolishness."
Those were the words of Chaplain Johnston in The Daily of Feb. 11.
words which he repeated, in effect, last Friday in connection with Fred
Wheeler.
Now it is rather easy. I guess, to differentiate between a '"good" religion
and Mr. Wheeler's Manicheaeism. But suppose the doctrines of two hypo
thetical religions are more similar. Which one is "good" and which one is
"bad?" If the two religions, such as Presbyterianism and Mohammedanism,
are compared, which is better and which is worse?
These questions, it seems to me, are basic, for any answer requires a
certain individual criterion which will support a diagnosis of "good" or
a diagnosis of "bad."
Perhaps Chaplain Johnston may declare his standard for judging the
worth of a religion.
