# A General Comment

To the Editor:
In regard to the religious belief discussion in the letters column. 1
would like to make a general comment.
First, I am not prepared to talk about religious belief. I am a graduate
.'indent in the Enplish Department. If a letter were written on the subject
ol calculus, I could read it, but I would not be able to argue the Tight
ness or wrongness of it.
The Chaplain's profession is the study and teaching of Christian mor
ality and faith. I am not prepared to criticize what his obligations to his
profession require.
I am willing to take Fred Wheeler's word for his being a thoughtful
and a religious person; but I am inclined to feel that I would rather read
a point by point enumeration of what he believes and why than the letters
lie has written.
Or I would like to read a carefully thought-out letter from a student
telling why he finds it impossible to believe in God or from anyone who
feels that he understands what he believes and who is willing to say
what that is. Someday I would like to write such a letter; I truly regret
that I am unprepared to do this now.
