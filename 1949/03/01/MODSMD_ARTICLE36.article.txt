# Coro Foundation

To the Editor:
As former Stanford students, we should like to tell you about an excep
tional opportunity. We are at present participating as interns in the
work of Coro Foundation in San Francisco. During the last six months
v/e have gained practical experience in public affairs which would have
been impossible to duplicate in any other way.
In this program we have been assigned to government offices, labor
unions, and business concerns. Through our contacts with leading men
in these fields, and through seeing the problems they face, we now feel
better equipped to direct our own future activities.
As the Foundation will soon be taking applications for the next Intern
; hip, which starts in October, we would advise any student who might be
interested to contact the Political Science Department or write directlv
to Coro Foundation, 821 Market Street, San Francisco.
