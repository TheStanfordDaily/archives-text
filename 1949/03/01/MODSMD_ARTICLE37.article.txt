# Practical Politics in One Lesson

### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
(Editor's Note: Political writer
George Velliotes continues his de
scription today of last Thursday's
Democratic Jackson Day dinner in
San Francisco. The Daily was the
only college newspaper repre
sented at the dinner.)

We learned more about practical
politics last Thursday in nine hours
than we have in three or four weeks
in Stanford Political Science classes.
Here are some of the things we
saw and learned:
The obvious delighted pleasure
the Democrats at the speakers' table
were taking in the knowledge that
they were listening to a great job
of ad libbing, the VP's address.
The evident representation at the
banquet of diverse groups from Cali
fornia society.
The fact that Mr. Drew Pearson
had a representative at the dinner.
(Mr. Pearson had just left for the
East, presumably, after seeing the
Merci Train as far as San Francisco.)
The fact that the banquet was the
result of months of planning based
on the huge headache of planning
for the cares of over 3,000 visitors.
Orchids To Wives
Scores and scores of orchids for
the wives of prominent politicians
and party workers; the great chan
deliers and candle-lit tables
throughout (he five huge dining
rooms; the democratieally-business
suitcd crowds;
The many microphones; the wor
ried ABC radio timers; the band

playing "My Old Kentucky Home"
and other modern favorites such as
"I'm Just Wild About Harry"; Bay
Area vocal artist Armand Gerard's
singing;
All this plus the conviviality, the
well-lubricated bar table in Room
2040 and the nine-hour dispensa
tion by two bartenders of real
Scotch whiskey and potent bourbon
from four cases; the constant en
trances and exits of party leaders,
body guards, and politicians such as
Barkley himself who had to face
photographers' flashes and more
line-ups for the hand-shaking rou
tine.
We saw such party workhorses as
Messrs. Oliver J. Carter, State Cen
tral Committee chairman; George
Killion, the dinner committee chair
man; E. George Luckey, vice-chair
man; Harold Berliner, treasurer;
Harold I. McGrath, and many hun
dreds of others who made of the
"social room a veritable teeming
Grand Central Station.
All of this helped to complete the
mosaic background to the whole af
fair. In the thick of things were
four of five Stanford students plus
Prof. Thomas Barclay.
Straws In The Wind
In all of the natural political ru
mors eddying around the day's pro
ceedings at the Palace, and at party
headquarters two blocks further
down Market Street, here are a few
that might be worth scrutiny:
The Democrats expect a very
tough and a very interesting (which

might be another word for "close")
election in 1!)50 for the state's gov
ernorship and senatorship. Some
things perhaps safely citable at this
time are the probable bids for the
governorship by Oliver J. Carter.
Democratic State Central Commit
tee chairman, and by James Roose
velt, Democratic National Commit
teeman.
Carter has a growing support
among the northern Californians (he
was former state senator from Shasta
County) and among local county of
ficers in the San Joaquin Valley
area.
Much as his support grows in this
area, however, it may be that Roose
velt may win the party's bid. Much
of the reasoning here lies in the fact
that Los Angeles County, where he
has ensconced himself, roughly con
trols about 43 per cent of the state
vote.
Plans for the senatorship race
would make interesting reading, too.
Whether Carter or Roosevelt, or
some dark horse, gets the party nod
to run, this does not answer the
question, "Can he beat Warren?"
One answer is. "There's a much
better chance for it in '50 than here
tofore, mostly because the people
often don't stick to a loser. Warren,
too. has proven that his name is not
necessarily sure-fire magic in a
campaign. If the Democratic lean
ings of the state continue on into
50. we II have a good chance of
taking the state."
