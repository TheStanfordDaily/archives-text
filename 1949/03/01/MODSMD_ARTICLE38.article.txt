# 'Farm' Participates In Radio Conference
## 
### 
Mrs. Inez Richardson of the Hoover Institute and Library and
member of the Western Radio Conference Executive Committee,
was chairman of "The Documentary," the first general session
of the Western Radio Conference in San Francisco last Thurs
day and Friday.
The panel for the discussion included Stanley T. Donner, di-

rector of radio at Stanford; Edgar-
E. Willis, department of speech and
drama at San Jose State; Stuart No
vins, director of public affairs at
CBS, Hollywood; and Richard Ber
trandias, program director, KNBC.
Donner and Novins are also mem
bers of the executive committee.
The documentary program was a
dramatization of actual facts con
cerning a community problem. It
was a radio feature similar to the
newspaper feature but adding sound,
speech, dialogue, and music.
The panel agreed to a general
policy of "no editorializing" except
when the opinion would be of com
mon agreement. In other words,
subject matter should explain and
point out a problem but not attempt
to solve it. Novins emphasized the
great potentialities of documentaries
in their recent expansion of topics.
Get the story, do the research, and
form your own documentary style,
was the method suggested to alle
viate a set pattern of presentation.
The wire recorded was named as the
best method to obtain authenticity,
good coverage, effectiveness, and lo
cal color in documentary programs.
The conference opened with the
"Standard School" broadcast Thurs
day morning and closed Friday night
with a television broadcast over
KPIX. Other topics discussed were
forums, listener participation, radio
and education, children's programs,
the symphony program, and cam
paigns.
Stanford representatives to the
conference included Mrs. Inez Rich
ardson. Stanley T. Donner, Ray San
ders, Bill Kane, Jinni Law, Frank
LaFetra. Shirley Bunnell, Pete Daw
ton, Howard Halbert, and Mary Hill.
