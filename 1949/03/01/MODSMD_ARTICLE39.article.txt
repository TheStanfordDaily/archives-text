# IIR Plans Annual All-Campus Parley
## 
### 
A third annual all-campus inter
national conference is being planned
by lIP for spring quarter. All liv
ing groups will be invited to send
delegates.
The one-day session is tentatively
planned to take the form of the UN
General Assembly. Plans will be
announced as they are formulated,
the conference committee said.
Students on Stanford's confer
ence committee are beginning to
realize their two main objectives
proposed for the high school con
ference on UNESCO held last De
cember at Asilomar.
The objectives were to initiate
and encourage interest of high
school students in international ac
tivities.
"Initial response from the high
schools was apathetic," said Marge
Bacon, former commit ice chairman.
"Only 45 out of 300 schools invited
sent delegates, but these few were
so enthusiastic that we felt all our
planning and the conference itself
had been more than worth while."
At the conference the high school
students voted for food and clothing
drives, sending books to foreign
schools, and friendlier treatment of
all friends and neighbors here at
home.
They also voted to establish a
permanent high school conference
on UNESCO and named the Farm
lIK to serve as a temporary secre
tariat to help get the organization
under way.
