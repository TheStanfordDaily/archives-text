# March Chappie Features Joyous Razz on 'Vogue's' High Sassiety
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The Daily is hap
py to announce (hat the Chappie,
so-called campus humor magazine,
has at last realized the inadequecy
of its present name. Here we pre
sent details of the change to a
more suitable and descriptive
title.)
Vogue was never like this
Blue blood will turn cold next
week when the Stanford Chaparral
invades the sphere of society and
fashion to present a magazine un
equalled for slick sophistication and
brittle, sparkling prose.
"Vague" will duplicate its name
sake in make-up, headlines, and
even typeset. Only one small trace
of the familiar Chappie will remain
as the "four little old men" wander
lonesome and lost in the chic en
vironment.
In addition to photographs of over
50 models, "Vague" will contain
more than 10.000 words in the ap
proved and fashionable style.
Features of this issue include a
fashion parody on both formal and
Quad wear; hints for beauty; the
Vague Travelers Travelogue; and"I
Am at Stanford." the impressions of
a woman visitor to this quaint little
hamlet with its picturesque natives
and customs.
For the homemaker or the student

of architecture, there will be a com
plete guide to transforming a chick
en coop into a liveable home.
Not many copies of the March is
sue will be printed, so readers who
want a taste of truly elite society
should be on hand early Wednesday
morning next week for their maga
zines.
