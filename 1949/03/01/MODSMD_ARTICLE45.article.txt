# Lisle Fellowships Interviews Today
## 
### 
Interviews will be held today for
the Lisle Fellowship summer group
living units. Mrs. Dennis Petty
YVyatt, California representative of
the Lisle Fellowship, will conduct
the interviews from 10:30 to 11:30
a.m. and from 4:15 to 5:30 p.m. in
the "Y" lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse.
Men and women — foreign stu
dents as well as American—attend
the summer community living proj
ects. Americans who plan to go
abroad have made everlasting
friends first here. Foreign students
in America on scholarships find an
opportunity to know and enjoy
common American home life in var
ious types of communities.
Each student pays just what ho i. c
able to contribute to a common fund,
to which former students and inter
: ested friends also contribute. All ex
| penses are paid from this fund. The
actual cost per student is $150.
Since foreign students are not ex
pected to have been earning money
during their stay here, their share,
plus transportation, is paid by iLsle.
