# Veteran Bear Ruggers Boast Perfect Record
## 
### 
The Indian ruggers started prep
aration for next Saturday's game
with Cal yesterday as they went
through a strenuous workout. The
Bears as usual are considered the
big rugby power on the coast, and
it is the Cards' avowed purpose to
bring Cal's monopoly to an end.
The Bears have an all - veteran
outfit plus Carl Van Heuit who has
sparked the backs in early season
games. Van Heuit, an ex-Rambler
scatback, has found the game to his
liking, and his hustle and speed
have given the Bears an added of
fensive punch.
The veterans are led by big Jim
Cullom and Hank Wright. These
two stalwarts also handle the place
kicking. Other familiar names from
last year's squad include Wilbur
Lenz, Bob Losey, Art Mower, and
Bob Kniptash.
The Bears have a 2-0 record thus
far this season. Their season started
late because of the semester system,
and consequently they have played
only a third as many games as the
Cards. The two Bear victories were
over the University Club (15-0)
and UCLA (18-0).
Saturday's Big Game in the Stan
ford Stadium will be preceded by a
preliminary game involving the
JV's of the two schools. Inciden
tally. there wi'l be a slight admis
sion lee of 50 cents.


RIG JIM CULLOM lias tempo
rarily switched his efforts from
the gridiron to the rugby field.
Needless to say, big Jim will use
his weight to good advantage next
Saturday when Cal and Stanford
renew their rugby rivalry.
