## FROSH MEET Sala to Try For Record 
### 
Stanford's highly touted freshman
swimming team will open its 1949
season tomorrow in the Indians'
home pool. As usual, Coach Tom
Haynie is exhibiting no signs of
horror or gloom, and the discussion
around the tanks is not "Will we
win?" but "How many records will
we set?"
Strangely enough, the highlight
of the day will have nothing to do
with the I'rosh. Ralph Sala, Stan
lord's "old fisherman," will move
in during an intermission and at
tempt to break the American per
formance record for the half-mile
(880) in a 20-yard pool. This is not
a speed record so much as it is a
performance record—the multitude
of turns causing the difficulties. The
old record, held by Arnie Borg of
the Illinois Athletic Club, stands at
9:59.2, and according to no less
an authority than Tom Haynie him
self, "Sala will break the record."
Also looking for a record-break
ing day is freshman free-styler Bob
Wycoff, who will be aiming at Bob
Arideron's freshman records. Back
in 196 when champion Bob Ander
son was a first-yearer, he swam the
50 in 23.1 and the 100 in 53.9. It'll
be these marks that young Wycoff
will be splashing toward tomorrow.
To wind up the successful—Hay
nie hopes — afternoon, the frosh
four - man 400 - yard freestyle re
layers will aim toward the 3:43.5
record. This relay team consists of
Bob Wycoff, Bruce Putnam, Phil
Chapman, and Jim Smith.
