						Good Old Days Are Gone Forever: Bruins and Trojans Fight It Out in South 
### 
Basketball is pretty popular stuff back in St. Louis or in Kentucky,
but here on the Farm it's better to talk about something else.
But does anybody remember when Hank Luisetti went to Stanford?
Or when Pollard and Dallmar romped their way to a national title in 1942?
Hell, I don't. All I remember is Stanford losing eight straight to USC,
dropping five out of eight to UCLA, and losing seven out of 10 to Cali
fornia's Golden Bears.
1 remember Stanford cage squads that have finished in the cellar in
1940 and 1948. and next to last in 1947.
And now another Indian basketball team, one that looked like a champ
before the season, is struggling to keep out of the cellar.
And it would not be impossible for California to step out of the darkness to
come up with a double win next weekend, and push Stanford right back
into that recent familiar dwelling spot, the cellar.
M emories No Good in 49
But forget it; leave us not go to pieces over our present lack of victory
ability. We got tradition to fall back on. We got the good old days. We
got memories.
Ah yes, as the slight strings of a violin begin to form a suitable back
fciound, remember when Luisetti and H. B. Lee and the Laughing Boys
i oared to three consecutive titles in '36, '37, and '38?
And please talk about the season of '41 when Stanford earned an unheard
of all five places on the Southern Division all-star team.
Or think about 1942 when the Tribe won 26 out of 28, and came up
with the naitonal crown by breezing past Dartmouth. It was one of those
typical Stanford come-throughs which are now so much a part of the past.
(Stanford beat Dartmouth with star Jim Pollard sitting out the game be
cause of illness, as subs Jack Dana and Fred Linari stepped in with ter
l ific clutch performances.)
But that was a long time ago. All we do these days is talk about such
th'ngs. All we have left is the memory. Thanks for the memory. The hell
with the memory.
In This Corner . . .
Down in Los Angeles, the local undertakers are getting ready for a big
rush, that is, they are setting the stage lor the coming cage battle between
th push-and-bash-'em boys from USC and UCLA.
The Olympic Auditorium, L.A.'s original fistic arena, is a perfect site
for the Friday night clash. I would meekly suggest that they import referee
Arthur Donovan from New York's Madison Square Garden to handle
the clinch separating.
Donovan is an old hand at such affairs, and would be much better than
Lou Stringer or Bob Freeze at keeping Stan Christie and Cry-child
Kraushaar from each other's throats.
If there arc five men remaining on both sides by the time the cage war
ceases on Friday night, the Los Angeles (SC from the Southside and UCLA
from the Westside) will have at it again in Westwood Saturday night.
Brass-Knucks Left at Door
Ballplayers from both clubs will be required to check the brass knuckles
at the door, and only fists, elbows, knees, and fingernails will be allowed.
At this, both Trojans and Bruins have demonstrated a great aptitude.
Or does that sound like sour grapes jus because our local casaba spe
c aliats could not trade blow for blow and come out on top? Maybe it does.
But if there is one excuse, and I don't like excuses, for George Yardley's
poor showing, it was that Sam Barry deliberately instructed his boys to
push and shove Yardley every time he got close to the ball.
Anybody who saw the games against USC this year will tell you that
all was not according to Iloyle when blond George was rebounding off
the boards.
Yardley would be high above the rest and then suddenly his body would
be bent in half. George would end up on the floor, and one of Barry's boys
would have the ball.
One thing about the Trojans, they can both give and take it. They play
rough and don't mind when their opponents counter. UCLA just gives it.
When it comes time to take a little, the Bruins start moaning and whining.
That is the main reason why I am picking the Trojans this weekend
to put the Bruins to sleep well before the end of the scheduled 15 rounds.
