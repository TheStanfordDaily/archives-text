# Dr. Brunetti, Inventor of Wrist Radio, Named New Associate Director of SRI
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN 
Dr. Cleclo Brunetti, newly named |
associate director of Stanford Re- i
search Intitute, believes in doing :
big things in a small way.
A specialist in the relatively new J
field of miniaturization, he has tie- i
veloped objects no bigger than a j
man's little finger. Yet these same !
objects are now attracting the at
tention of top leaders throughout |
tht closely related fields ol science i
and industry.
Tracy Wrist Kat'io
Oddly enough, his most famous i
invention is already well known to |
millions of Americans, those mil- '
lions who follow Dick Tracy in the
comic strips. This is because the
Stanford scientist has succeeded in
mtiking a reality of the Dick Tracy
wrist radio.
Dr. Brunetti's tiny radio, which
has been described as the world's
smallest complete broadcasting sta
tion, is so minute that it easily fits
into an empty cigarette pack. He 1
has also developed a sub-miniature
radio transmitter that fits into a
capsule no larger than a lipstick,
and a hearing aid about the size of
a small envelope.
The key to all this amazing work 1
lies in printed circuits—a process
'which makes the use of wiring un
necessary. Dr. Brunetti literally
paints electrical wires into a radio.
His method replaces the costly and
bulky wiring with a system where- :

by currents are conducted through 1
silver and carbon paints.
Ueseanli Work
Dr. Brunetti came to Stanford
two months ago from the National
Bureau of Standards. Serving as
chief of the engineering electronics
section from 1947 to 1949, he was a
member oi' the Bureau staff for
eight years. It was during this pe
i riod that he and his fellow research
experts developed the printed cir
cuit method to its present state.
Now that he is at SRI, Dr. Bru
netti will have more freedom to
i compete and work with industry.
In this connection, he be'ieves that
the industrial trend is now turning
toward compactness because of the
practicability of small size in every
day use. and he cites portable ra
dios, midget cars, and smaller wom
en's pluses as examples of this
trend.
Printed Circuits
In regard to practicability of the
printed circuit method, business
leaders have forecast that this cost

reducing method will soon result in
cheaper and more efficient small
electrical items on the market. It is
an extremely simple and inexpen
sive process from the manufactur
er's point of view.
Already plans have been made
for the miniature radio to be in
cluded in the equipment of police
and forest service outfits, and other
such essential services. Looking for
ward to the day when everyone will
have access to the radio as a sort
of personal telephone system, the
FCC has set aside a spot on the
wave lengths for civilian use, a pre
cautionary move to insure against
jamming of the airways by anxious
pa rents.
For that matter, Dr. Brunetti
claims that he was even approached
by a football coach who wanted to
know if it would be possible to in
sert a miniature radio in his quar
terback's helmet. Dr. Brunetti gave
this proposal a quick veto on the
grounds that he wasn't sure it was
legal.

trend.
Printed Circuits
In regard to practicability of the
printed circuit method, business
leaders have forecast that this cost

reducing method will soon result in
cheaper and more efficient small
electrical items on the market. It is
an extremely simple and inexpen
sive process from the manufactur
er's point of view.
Already plans have been made
for the miniature radio to be in
cluded in the equipment of police
and forest service outfits, and other
such essential services. Looking for
ward to the day when everyone will
have access to the radio as a sort
of personal telephone system, the
FCC has set aside a spot on the
wave lengths for civilian use, a pre
cautionary move to insure against
jamming of the airways by anxious
pa rents.
For that matter, Dr. Brunetti
claims that he was even approached
by a football coach who wanted to
know if it would be possible to in
sert a miniature radio in his quar
terback's helmet. Dr. Brunetti gave
this proposal a quick veto on the
grounds that he wasn't sure it was
legal.
Dr. Cleclo Brunetti, newly named |
associate director of Stanford Re- i
search Intitute, believes in doing :
big things in a small way.
A specialist in the relatively new J
field of miniaturization, he has tie- i
veloped objects no bigger than a j
man's little finger. Yet these same !
objects are now attracting the at
tention of top leaders throughout |
tht closely related fields ol science i
and industry.
Tracy Wrist Kat'io
Oddly enough, his most famous i
invention is already well known to |
millions of Americans, those mil- '
lions who follow Dick Tracy in the
comic strips. This is because the
Stanford scientist has succeeded in
mtiking a reality of the Dick Tracy
wrist radio.
Dr. Brunetti's tiny radio, which
has been described as the world's
smallest complete broadcasting sta
tion, is so minute that it easily fits
into an empty cigarette pack. He 1
has also developed a sub-miniature
radio transmitter that fits into a
capsule no larger than a lipstick,
and a hearing aid about the size of
a small envelope.
The key to all this amazing work 1
lies in printed circuits—a process
'which makes the use of wiring un
necessary. Dr. Brunetti literally
paints electrical wires into a radio.
His method replaces the costly and
bulky wiring with a system where- :

by currents are conducted through 1
silver and carbon paints.
Ueseanli Work
Dr. Brunetti came to Stanford
two months ago from the National
Bureau of Standards. Serving as
chief of the engineering electronics
section from 1947 to 1949, he was a
member oi' the Bureau staff for
eight years. It was during this pe
i riod that he and his fellow research
experts developed the printed cir
cuit method to its present state.
Now that he is at SRI, Dr. Bru
netti will have more freedom to
i compete and work with industry.
In this connection, he be'ieves that
the industrial trend is now turning
toward compactness because of the
practicability of small size in every
day use. and he cites portable ra
dios, midget cars, and smaller wom
en's pluses as examples of this
trend.
