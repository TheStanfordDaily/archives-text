### 
There are two ways to get to San
Francisco, either by zipping down
the Bayshore or by going at a slovv
ei pace along the old King's High
way.
This is the analogy that Professor
B E. C. Davis drew for the Tues

day Evening Series lecture, "*Edu- (
cation at the Crossroads." Tradi
tional self - government, so price- i
lessly guarded by English univer- j
sities, must not be sacrificed for i
mass education at great speed.
As o!d provincial schools become 1
more and more dependent on state j
aid, they jealously guard their aca
demic freedom. Englishmen feel
that instead of losing all private in
itiative they must find a new road
somewhere in between the extremes j
of tradition and experimentation.
