## Distasteful Judgment 
### 
The city fathers of Palo Alto exhibited distasteful judgment
Monday afternoon.
By playing recorded music over a loudspeaker, they forced
student members of the Academic Freedom Committee (alias
Ihe Stanford Student Progressives) into transferring, to the City
Park, their scheduled program featuring Herbert Phillips, avowed
Communist professor ousted from the University of Washington.
Five minutes after the crowd moved on, the loudspeaker was
taken down.
Rooms in the Community Center buildings were declared out
of-bounds by the city's mayor, because Phillips, as an avowed
Communist, would have nothing of value to offer citizens of
Palo Alto. Nothing, Mr. Mayor? To us he represented a curiosity
in a political doctrine too alien to our own government to be
regarded by sensible individuals.
Before the meeting, we heard much criticism of the city's
policy in "trying to cut off free speech." At the meeting itself,
we found that the audience was not completely composed of
Communists—most were interested spectators who wanted to
see the man and to hear his arguments that have made news
paper headlines for several weeks.
Though we do not believe in the doctrines espoused by this
professor, and though we do not adhere to the political beliefs
supported by the Progressives, we do not believe that to censor
a man by this fashion was the same as setting up loudspeakers
over the entire area to broadcast the very words the officials
intended to stifle.
While we frown on the actions employed by city council offi
cials, the students sponsoring Phillips warrant criticism. Their
effort to borrow the Boy Scout Amphitheater without listing its
exact move was not an honest move, and the action raised bitter
ness among some Palo Alto officials.
We do not believe that the gab issued by Professor Phillips
influenced any student at the program to enter the Communist
fold.
The elder generation might do well to bear in mind that '{he
youngsters are very capable of making value judgments between
fact and hogwash. But Professor Phillips is a curiosity—just as
a movie star is in any town outside of Hollywood or New York—
and some of the people wanted to see exactly what he was like.
