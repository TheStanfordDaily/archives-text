## Rugby, the Rugged 
### 
You have 32, gentlemen. Will you ,
try for 16?
Rugby, or legalized mayhem as it j
is better known, is one of the more
popular outdoor sports on the Farm.
Seems to me it would be much sim
plified if the teams would just line I
up opposite each other and beat
away with clubs. The outcome
would be about the same.
An Englishman named W. Webb i
Ellis started this "quick death" back ,
jn 1823. It took till 1906 for it to
spread over to this continent to
Stanford, when the first Cal-Stan- 1
ford Big Game was played.
Since the inception of the game j
in this country. Stanford has always 1
furnished a major portion of the U.S. j
Olympic team members. In 1920, :
10 of the 20 -man team competing at j
Antwerp were from the Farm. Then
in 1924 there were nine Stanfordites !
on the U.S. team which won the ti
tie at Paris.
The rules, from a layman's point i
of view, are rather odd. It looks like
the only way you can foul is to curse.
'Tis a gentleman's game, you know.
As for the rest of it, a guy kicks |
the oversized football and another 1
guy falls on it. This is the signal [
for everyone on both sides to rally'
around and kick the bejesus out of'
the man thus protecting the ball.
If your life insurance has lapsed,
this is just no game for you.
Any rules that there may be acci
dentally stuck around in any odd j
corners of rule books somewhere
weren't readily apparent as I
Watched .... except that there was
a vaguely defined boundary run-'

, ning from the boondocks on the
edge of the Farm to the highway—
i
where even these behemoths refuse
to take sides against these California
drivers.
The penalty whistle seems to be
blown at the whimsy of the referee.
And herein lies the only point of
the game that is like any other game
: of anything we've ever seen—the
referee is just as unpopular here as
in any other sport-conflict.
There the similarity, living or
dead, to any other sport becomes
purely coincidental. It looks like it's
legal to carry the ball as in football.
! though you can kick it like in soc
j cer, too, and then again you can
dribble it like in basketball. This
j last has been brought up to date,
j though. They don't use the old
fashioned way where you dribble
with your hands. They have to make
! it tougher, so you dribble with your
i feet.
The scores seem to be counted by
the number of men that are carried
off the field .... and the game is
: over when everyone is either killed
| or maimed. No substitutions are al
i lowed in the game. However, the
| injured player "may again take his
place on the field and play again any
time he is able to do so."
Just to confuse the issue further
.... you can score at either end
of the field. If the ball goes into
cither end zone, the team which
first falls on it is awarded a touch
down.
Who wants to make a fourth for
I tiddledy-winks?
