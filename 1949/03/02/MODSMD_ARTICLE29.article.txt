Small Fry Taxes
WASHINGTON—Certain children ,
with small incomes, who can't quali
fy as dependents on 1948 income tax
I returns, may help their dads by
making the dependency rating next
! year.
The law now provides that anyone
with a yearly income of $500 or more
i cannot be claimed as a dependent.
But the exemption allowed the tax
payer for a dependent is $(>OO. A bill
has been introduced in the House
to allow a close relative who earned
| less than $600 to qualify as a de
| pendent.
If approved by Congress, this will
mean a saving to some taxpayers of
more than $100.

The Budget
WASHINGTON—Here's the guess
of one White House insider on the
way spending will finally shape up
■ for the year beginning July 1:
When Congress has finished its
work the outlay will be just about
what President Truman asked—s4l,-
900,000,000.
Congress probably will trim off a
billion or more, but the cuts will be
cancelled later by a new cost item—
| rearming Western European nations.

Western Union
WASHINGTON -U.S. mines are
likely to get more business out of
the Western Union pact than Amer
ican arms plants.
American negotiators are insisting
that the Europeans turn out as much
|of their own armament needs as
possible, even though they have to
get ores from us.
In particular they insist that Eu
rope use the fine small-arms fac
tories in Belgium, British aircraft
factories and French truck plants
(which could turn out tanks).

The law now provides that anyone

i cannot be claimed as a dependent.
But the exemption allowed the tax
payer for a dependent is $(>OO. A bill
has been introduced in the House
to allow a close relative who earned

900,000,000.
Congress probably will trim off a

cancelled later by a new cost item—
