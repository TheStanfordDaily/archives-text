## European Travel Expenses 
### 
To the Editor:
The announcement of the "conducted European excursion" in this
morning's Daily surprised me.
It doesn t seem right in the first place that you j,ive so much space for
a commercial plan like this one. Many students get the impression from
such publications that a tour to Europe must cost them $1,400 to $1,500.
In the last few years I traveled all over western Europe. I stayed in
luxury hotels and in youth hostels. I have traveled in third-class car
riages and in Pullmans. So I think I have a good idea of prices in different
countries of Europe.
Now I am sure Mrs. Reynolds organizes a wonderful trip for students
who want to go to Europe, but it doesn't seem necessary to me at all
to spend so much. Even if you go to the best hotels, take the best seats
in the opera in Milan and Palis, and have a very generous allowance,
it doesn't seem necessary to me to spend more than 51.050.
My figures are:
Transportation (round trip): $330, tourist class on Dutch liners.
Expense allowance on boat: $30.
Luxury hotels 45 days, $8 per day. $3(50; you can get very good hotels
in all countries for $4 to $5 per day.
Transportation in Europe: $150. based on Pullman prices.
Allowance for museums, opera, etc., $1 per day, $180 total; this allows
more expense than an average European family has to live on, and 1 don't
sec How you can spend it.
You could, if you have to travel as cheaply as possible, bring your ex
penses down to about $700. Europe will be glad to see you, and even
more so when you don't throw your money around.
