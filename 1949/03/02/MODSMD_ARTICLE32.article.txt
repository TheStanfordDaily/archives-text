# Clever, Well-Written Satire
## 
### 
To the Editor:
To my mind most of the criticism of Fred Wheeler's letter to The Daily
h.is been one-sided and unjustified. Personally, I regarded the letter as a
clever, well-written piece of satire.
Works of its sort help to preserve a relativity of viewpoint and provoke
at least some thoughtful consideration of plans such as the suggested
formation of a religious activities council.
Wheeler's letter has been criticized as being in "bad taste," etc. Is the
consideration of long-established, fixed attitudes of society in an objective
manner "bad taste?" If so, then, in my opinion, there is not enough "bad
taste" in the world.
The die-hard religious zealots, by voicing their emotional, prejudicial
attitudes in this wave of criticism have made their position seem even
more ridiculous.
But the really surprising thing to me is that such persistent bickering
over a single letter could, among supposedly intelligent people, go to such
lengths in the columns of The Daily. Even the University Chaplain, it
seems, has taken up arms in this amusing battle of words. Just what will
be gained one way or another by the whole affair I cannot see.
However, it seems that the subject of religion, like sex. has some special
quality about it. which arouses in people a sort of morbid interest and
al'ows discussions of this type to take place.
