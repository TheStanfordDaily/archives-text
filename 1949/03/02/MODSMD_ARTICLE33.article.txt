# Religion in Student Life
## 
### 
To the Editor:
For the sake of the record, let us straighten out Fred Wheeler's as
sumption that any religious program will fail because of indifference.
Over 80 pe,r cent of the students registered at Stanford expressed preference
for some organized religion.
We are anxious to see religion taken out of the bull session stage and
presented by men who believe what they teach and who have devoted
their lives to studying in their own specialized fields.
So many of us have a grammar school education in religion and are
acquiring a university education in engineering, or history, or psychology.
The university courses in religion offer even less education than we
already have, since their scope includes all Western and Oriental religious
traditions in two three-unit courses. We are poor matches for those pro
fesors and others who attack religion "intellectually" through jibes arid
innuendos.
Our religious groups are ineffective because they have to maintain them
selves two miles from the center of student life. They are denied the use
of University facilities on the grounds that they are "tainted with sec
tarianism" by having a chaplain present. Chaplain Johnston's plan for a
religious-activities building concerns the distant future. How about now?
And don't throw the Charter at me! The administration could interpret
it as the Army, lowa State, Columbia, Princeton. HaVvard, Chicago, Cor
nell, Yale, etc., have done—by admitting to the faculty professors of the
three main religious traditions in America (or any other tradition if
sufficient demand exists).
Or. our administration could ignore the "non-sectarian" provision, just
as it has ignored the provision "to have taught in the University the im
mortality of the soul, the existence of an all-wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws are the highest duty of man." (Section 14,
Charter of Endowment.)
Given a real chance—placed in a position where student religious groups
wouldn't have to just to have a meeting on campus—given the co
operation instead of the opposition of the administration, religion would
scon take its natural place in the student life at Stanford.
