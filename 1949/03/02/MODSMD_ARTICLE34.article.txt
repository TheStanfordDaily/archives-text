# Create Representative Program

To the Editor:
Sincc, in the aftermath of Mr. Wheeler's controversial letter, the whole
subject of Stanford's religious program has come to discussion, we should
like to suggest that the administration clear the religious air and state out
right to students and public that this University officially subscribes to
Protestantism; that it is not the inter-denominational institution which
its founders proposed that it be.
We are not able us Episcopalians to enter into the Stanford religious
program nor can students who are members of orthodox Christianity, or
J"ws, do so. Therefore, the program serves a limited number of Protestants
whose accustomed services may or may not vaguely conform to those
held in the Chapel.
It was. perhaps, Mrs. Stanford's naively Victorian impression that the
basic philosophical differences underlying the branches of Christianity
could be ridden over roughshod; that the whole student population could
find religious expression in an amorphous liturgy recited amidst the out
wj.rd trappings of Catholic Christianity.
We must now, however, ask the administration to face the facts of
n ligious life as they exist today in the University and either declare tin
school to be officially "Protestant non-sectarian" or establish its religious
program on a basis truly representative of the various faiths found in the
student, body.
