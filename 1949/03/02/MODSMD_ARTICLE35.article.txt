# Farm Pioneers With New TV Course

### JACK LITTLE 
Television made its appearance in
the Stanford curriculum just about ;
the lime the Bay Area's first TV
station went on the air and TV re- i
ceivers began to gather large and
faithful audiences along the Row.
At the beginning of winter quar- j
lei a group of students with the
pioneering spirit signed up for j
Speech 2128, "Problems in Tele
vision"' . . . Stanford's first tele- '
vision course. Planned and taught j
by Dr. Stanley Donner, director of ;
radio for the University, and Ray
Sanders, technical director of radio. 1
the course has earned its place in j
the time schedule.
"Problems in Television" is a
comprehensive survey of the tele
vision business. Beginning with a
study of the way a picture is trans
mitted through television and the
electronic principles involved in the
operation of TV cameras and re

i ceivers. the course goes on to con- i
I sider the problems of television i
j production.
Directing methods, studio design,
camera techniques, sound pick-up,
lighting, set construction, make-up,
costuming, programming, and writ
ing . . . all are within the scope
I of the course.
Dr. Donner and Mr. Sanders vis
ited every major television studio
in the Los Angeles and San Fran- 1
i cisco areas, gathering first - hand
material for the course. Supple
menting their regular lectures are
I lecturers from the television indus
try and from allied arts, such as the
theater and movie industry.
Students do research in fields of
special interest to .them, reporting
their findings during the seminar
type class sessions. A complete bib
liography of articles and books on
TV. prepared by the class, furnishes

an abundant supply of material for
i this research.
The new course is designed to
give students a general background
I in the various aspects of the tele
vision industry. Emphasis is placed
on learning the lingo of the busi
ness, students learn how television
| shows are "blocked" . . . the cam
era angles and shots co-ordinated
with the movement of the produe
' tion. and study the problems of
lighting and color presented by the
extremely sensitive television cam
eras now in vise. Consideration is
also given to the costs involved in
television production, and the effi
ciency of TV equipment recently
developed.
"'Problems in Television"' will be
given again spring quarter and con-
I siderably enlarged for the Stan
ford-NBC Summer Radio Institute,
Dr. Donner has announced.

Directing methods, studio design,

Dr. Donner and Mr. Sanders vis
ited every major television studio
in the Los Angeles and San Fran- 1
i cisco areas, gathering first - hand
material for the course. Supple
menting their regular lectures are
I lecturers from the television indus
try and from allied arts, such as the
theater and movie industry.
Students do research in fields of
special interest to .them, reporting
their findings during the seminar
type class sessions. A complete bib
liography of articles and books on
TV. prepared by the class, furnishes

an abundant supply of material for
i this research.
The new course is designed to
give students a general background
I in the various aspects of the tele
vision industry. Emphasis is placed
on learning the lingo of the busi
ness, students learn how television
| shows are "blocked" . . . the cam
era angles and shots co-ordinated
with the movement of the produe
' tion. and study the problems of
lighting and color presented by the
extremely sensitive television cam
eras now in vise. Consideration is
also given to the costs involved in
television production, and the effi
ciency of TV equipment recently
developed.
"'Problems in Television"' will be
given again spring quarter and con-
I siderably enlarged for the Stan
ford-NBC Summer Radio Institute,

electronic principles involved in the
operation of TV cameras and re
