(Ed. note: Egad, nip re of this

"Vogue was never like this!"
Ey no stretch of the imagination
could Vogue ever dare to put out
an issue like the one that the Chap
pie is presenting next Wednesday
at the new low price of 25 cents.
And yet the Old Boy feels that
the poor saps buying the next issue
will recognize all the faults of that
ultra-sophisticated.magazine in the
pages of the Vague Issue, a parody
on Vogue. Lots of phony fashions,
lots ot deb shots, lots of modern
homes and modern clothes and
modem women, widi Stanford
dearies acting as the models.
The Old One hastened to add that
this is, with the exception of the
annual Comic 1.-sue, the first satire
since 1945 and the famous Esquire
Edition.
So don't forget to buy your 20
copies—for the wife and kids—and
get in on the laughs, your chance to
watch the funniest people since the
Dickens novels taking well-aimed
smashes at that paragon of the
woman's world. Vogue, incorporat
ing Vanity Fair. Fertility Fair, Ba
nality Fair, and the Police Gazette.
And remember . . .
"Vogue was never like this!"
