# Bruins, USC Place Two; Tribe Nabs Single Spot
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Two Bruins, two Trojans, and a lone Indian dominated the
Southern Division all-star team picked last night by the Stan
ford Daily sports staff.
USC's Bill Sharman and Stanford's Dave Davidson were both
unanimous choices, with the clever forward from Troy getting
the nod as the outstanding individual

performer of the season.
Davidson, the best all-around
guard on the Coast, is the third
highest scorer in the loop as well
as owning a great defensive record.
Davidson is the best backboard man
in the West, and is a scrappy, hard
working ball player.
Rounding out the top five were
Bruins Alan Sawyer (forward) and
George Stanich (guard) and USC's
rugged center, Stan Christie.
Bill Sharman, whose play for Sam
Barry this season has ranked him

as an all-time Trojan great, was
undoubtedly the toast of the Dixie
cage squads.
The six-foot, one-inch Sharman
leads division scoring, with 167
points for 10 games for a sparkling
16.7 per game.
He is also a fancy floorman and
a driver who has sparked USC. on
to a first-place tie with UCLA in
the league standings.
Dave Davidson, 6-3, has been
Stanford's most consistent offensive
threat since the conference opened.
Davidson has dumped in 133 points,
placing him just six points behind
Alan Swayer for second-place scor
ing honors.
Sawyer, the tall Bruin fireman, ha.*:
been the leading cog in UCLA's late
season win streak. He started the
season slowly, but has been picking
up speed with every step. Lasi
weekend he dumped in 30 points ir
two games to run his season tota
to 139.
George Stanich, the other Bruin t<
steal a spot on the coveted five
grabbed the glory right out fron
under the nose of Cal's Bob Walker
It was Stanich's speed and hi:
strength on the boards that earne<
him the job.
Stanich and Sawyer have beei
great during the recent UCLA rec
ord-breaking win streak, and hav<
also been instrumental in helpin;
preserve UCLA's perfect home rec
ord this season.
The remaining job on the mythica
machine turned out to be a tossu)
between Stan Christie and Bil
Stephenson, with Bruin Carl Krau
shaar even getting into the fight
Because Christie was playing witl
a first-place club, he was given th
edge.

Rounding out the top five were
Bruins Alan Sawyer (forward) and
George Stanich (guard) and USC's
rugged center, Stan Christie.
Bill Sharman, whose play for Sam
Barry this season has ranked him

as an all-time Trojan great, was
undoubtedly the toast of the Dixie
cage squads.
The six-foot, one-inch Sharman
leads division scoring, with 167
points for 10 games for a sparkling
16.7 per game.
He is also a fancy floorman and
a driver who has sparked USC. on
to a first-place tie with UCLA in
the league standings.
Dave Davidson, 6-3, has been
Stanford's most consistent offensive
threat since the conference opened.
Davidson has dumped in 133 points,
placing him just six points behind
Alan Swayer for second-place scor
ing honors.
Sawyer, the tall Bruin fireman, ha.*:
been the leading cog in UCLA's late
season win streak. He started the
season slowly, but has been picking
up speed with every step. Lasi
weekend he dumped in 30 points ir
two games to run his season tota
to 139.
George Stanich, the other Bruin t<
steal a spot on the coveted five
grabbed the glory right out fron
under the nose of Cal's Bob Walker
It was Stanich's speed and hi:
strength on the boards that earne<
him the job.
Stanich and Sawyer have beei
great during the recent UCLA rec
ord-breaking win streak, and hav<
also been instrumental in helpin;
preserve UCLA's perfect home rec
ord this season.
The remaining job on the mythica
machine turned out to be a tossu)
between Stan Christie and Bil
Stephenson, with Bruin Carl Krau
shaar even getting into the fight
Because Christie was playing witl
a first-place club, he was given th
edge.

Two Bruins, two Trojans, and a lone Indian dominated the
Southern Division all-star team picked last night by the Stan
ford Daily sports staff.
USC's Bill Sharman and Stanford's Dave Davidson were both
unanimous choices, with the clever forward from Troy getting
the nod as the outstanding individual

performer of the season.
Davidson, the best all-around
guard on the Coast, is the third
highest scorer in the loop as well
as owning a great defensive record.
Davidson is the best backboard man
in the West, and is a scrappy, hard
working ball player.
