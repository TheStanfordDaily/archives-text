## Thru Breier's Pipe Gridders in the Spotlight Once Again; But Absenteeism Will Hamper Marchie 
### 
College sports may come and go with the passing' of the quarters, but
iootball time seems to roll around before you know it is gone. A few days
alter the start of next quarter, Marchie Schwartz and staff will have
some 130 men out for spring football.
bo it seems that it would not be out of place to mention the coming
V,iid practices at this time. To us it seems that spring football is one of
the most important phases of the game. It is the time that the coaches and
players can lay the ground work for the season to come, a time that
should be used to full advantage.
Spring practice at the Farm will differ from those in the past in several
ways. Last year at this time Coach Schwartz was ready to greet a great
influx of junior college transfers. It so happened that four or five of
these men stepped into first-string jobs before last season endecf.
Had Large J(1 Crop
Because the crop of JC men was so large, a lot of time had to be given
in looking over the new men and indoctrinating them into the Stanford
system. Most of those boys, with the other regulars, will be out for spring
ball early this year. Alter one year with the team, it can be supposed that
tlu.y know the set up. Thus, time can, and according to Schwartz will,
be given to learning some of the fundamentals that are so important.
but what is more significant to us is the number of men who will not
be out for spring football.
Next year Stanford will meet four teams that use the single wing. For
t!it 112 reason Schwartz is adding some basic single wing plays to his T
lc! repertoire. In this way the players can become accustomed to
the two-on-one blocking style that seemed to baffle them in the Santa
Clara game last year, as well as learning what to expect in the way of
ringle wing plays.
But, alas, some boys who could be expected to be a big help will not
be on hand to take advantage of these drills. Baseball will claim some
and track others.
Spring Scrum Vila!
Which brings us around to something that was printed on these pages
almost one year ago today. At that time I said that I did not think a
boy who was out for football should stay away from spring practice. This
year, with the addition of the new plays, it is even more important that
the boys who expect to play football next fall should be out for spring
practice.
Schwartz has said tnat he will give the players but a few plays—probably
eight T formation and four single-wing. The footballers will run these
over and over until they have mastered them—or such is the plan at
this time.
he added that the practices will be of little spectator interest. In fact
they will border on the boring side—but the players will learn to block
and tackle if nothing else. We hope the coaching staff carries through
with these plans. We wish they would drop the charitable attitude about
letting football players go out for other sports without letting the player
know that it will huit his chances come next fall.
Brighter Side, Too
But perhaps it will all equal out in the end. Some of the missing men
could, with the right practice this spring, °ive help to the team next fall.
Those who don't turn out probably will not play so much next year be
t use some fellow who did come out has learned enough to beat him out.
We hope so.
I; some of them do make the team next year, and if they show that
the missed practices hurt their play, we will not hesitate to point that out.
Two of the first three teams we meet, Harvard and Michigan, will throw
the single wing at us. I can't help but think that all the team should attend
i'i'ills that are being held with those games in mind.
Schwartz hits big plans for those spring drills. He will have six teams
L'oing all the time. He figures that he will have enough coaches to handle
t -.ree scrimmages concurrently. Three spring games instead of one are
1 lanned. Scrimmages will be held daily.
All in all, it looks like a fine plan. But it would be better if a full
squad were present.

bo it seems that it would not be out of place to mention the coming
V,iid practices at this time. To us it seems that spring football is one of
the most important phases of the game. It is the time that the coaches and
players can lay the ground work for the season to come, a time that
should be used to full advantage.
Spring practice at the Farm will differ from those in the past in several
ways. Last year at this time Coach Schwartz was ready to greet a great
influx of junior college transfers. It so happened that four or five of
these men stepped into first-string jobs before last season endecf.
Had Large J(1 Crop
Because the crop of JC men was so large, a lot of time had to be given
in looking over the new men and indoctrinating them into the Stanford
system. Most of those boys, with the other regulars, will be out for spring
ball early this year. Alter one year with the team, it can be supposed that
tlu.y know the set up. Thus, time can, and according to Schwartz will,
be given to learning some of the fundamentals that are so important.
but what is more significant to us is the number of men who will not
be out for spring football.
Next year Stanford will meet four teams that use the single wing. For
t!it 112 reason Schwartz is adding some basic single wing plays to his T
lc! repertoire. In this way the players can become accustomed to
the two-on-one blocking style that seemed to baffle them in the Santa
Clara game last year, as well as learning what to expect in the way of
ringle wing plays.
But, alas, some boys who could be expected to be a big help will not
be on hand to take advantage of these drills. Baseball will claim some
and track others.
Spring Scrum Vila!
Which brings us around to something that was printed on these pages
almost one year ago today. At that time I said that I did not think a
boy who was out for football should stay away from spring practice. This
year, with the addition of the new plays, it is even more important that
the boys who expect to play football next fall should be out for spring
practice.
Schwartz has said tnat he will give the players but a few plays—probably
eight T formation and four single-wing. The footballers will run these
over and over until they have mastered them—or such is the plan at
this time.
he added that the practices will be of little spectator interest. In fact
they will border on the boring side—but the players will learn to block
and tackle if nothing else. We hope the coaching staff carries through
with these plans. We wish they would drop the charitable attitude about
letting football players go out for other sports without letting the player
know that it will huit his chances come next fall.
Brighter Side, Too
But perhaps it will all equal out in the end. Some of the missing men
could, with the right practice this spring, °ive help to the team next fall.
Those who don't turn out probably will not play so much next year be
t use some fellow who did come out has learned enough to beat him out.
We hope so.
I; some of them do make the team next year, and if they show that
the missed practices hurt their play, we will not hesitate to point that out.
Two of the first three teams we meet, Harvard and Michigan, will throw
the single wing at us. I can't help but think that all the team should attend
i'i'ills that are being held with those games in mind.
Schwartz hits big plans for those spring drills. He will have six teams
L'oing all the time. He figures that he will have enough coaches to handle
t -.ree scrimmages concurrently. Three spring games instead of one are
1 lanned. Scrimmages will be held daily.
All in all, it looks like a fine plan. But it would be better if a full
squad were present.
College sports may come and go with the passing' of the quarters, but
iootball time seems to roll around before you know it is gone. A few days
alter the start of next quarter, Marchie Schwartz and staff will have
some 130 men out for spring football.
