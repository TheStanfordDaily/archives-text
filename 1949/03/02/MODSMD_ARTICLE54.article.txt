# Spring Reg Dance
## 
### 
Benny Goodman was only the be
ginning! Lovers of good music will
really get a treat at the spring
quarter Reg Dance. Bob Ames,
dance chairman, said yesterday.
Lu Watters and his Yerba Buena
Jazz Blind are returning to the
campus and will play from 9 to 12
p.m. in the Women's Gym on Reg
Day, March 28.
Most Stanford students need no
introduction to Lu Watters and his
popular recording orchestra since
they have performed on campus
before, and hundreds of students
have driven all the way to El Cer
rito to hear Watters at his regular
stand.
But just in case there are some
who are not familiar with Watters,
he plays the solid New Orleans
rhythms described by Louis Arm
strong in Time magazine, "If you
have to ask what it is. you'll never
find out."
Sigma Delta Chi. sponsoring or
ganization, decided to spend twice
as much for a good band, Ames
sa,id. There'll be room for 4G3
couples, he added.
