# AWS Announces Guest Regulations
## 
### 
AWS Cabinet decided yesterday
that guest violations will continue
to remain under the demerit sys
tem.
Guest technicals and offenses will
be regarded as such on the hostess's
record. Under the demerit system
the hostess has the alternative of
counting her guest's late return:
(1) Under her own bonus
(2) An offense
(3) Minutes toward a demerit.
This provision changes the previ
ous regulation which made offenses
of all late returns and other viola
tions of AWS social regulations by
guests. The hostess may appeal her
guest violations to Council.
Nellie Phillips, social rgeulations
chairman, said Social Regulations
Committee considered recommend
ing that guest violations be dropped
from the demerit system. However,
this would necessitate setting up
another system along with the de
merit system. Miss Phillips said.
Since there is a small number of
guest violations, the advantages of
doing this would not outweigh the
resultant confusion of the guest vio
lations being placed under another
svstem.
