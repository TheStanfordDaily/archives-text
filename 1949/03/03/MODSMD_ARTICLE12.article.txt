# Sophomore Class Sponsors Rossotti Social to Fatten Crew Treasury
## 
### 
The sophomore class will salute
the Stanford crew at Pop Rossotti's
Picnic Grounds Friday afternoon,
April 1. Lu Watters and his Yerba
Buena Jazz Band will entertain.
Chuck Getchell, co-chairman of the
affair, said the proceeds will be do
nated to the crew.
The sophomores hope to raise
enough money on the project so
that they can make a contribution
to the slim bankroll of the hard
pressed crew men. Getchell said
the crew has been holding its own

with other coast crew teams while
footing most of the bills out of their
own pockets, since the University is
unable to give them financial sup- j
port.
'"Watters and the boys will be j
playing outside Pop's barn from j
about 3:30 until dinner time, so all
crew fans, jazz lovers, beer drink
ers, and assorted Friday loafers are
urged to keep the first Friday after
vacation in mind," he added.
Free beer will be included in the j
admission charge.
