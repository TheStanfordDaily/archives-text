# In the Court of the Beloved Oak

Roomy and I set off on a
shopping tour yesterday, and
we had !S25 between us. We
both wanted a new cotton
dress, but with soaring prices
we doubted if we could even
bring home two blouses for
our money.
We went in the Clothes
Closet and headed back to
ward the dresses. Conven
ience and joy—that's the mot
to of the Pop Shop, the CC's
popular-priced dress depart
ment. We were first struck
by the fetching decorations
. . . displayed cotton prints
and lollypops, both real and
decorative. But the true joy
of the Pop Shop is the prices
. . . darling cotton prints and
strips, lovely tie silk prints,
for S10, $12.95, and $15. And
what a selection — over 500
dresses to choose from in
both regular and junior sizes.
The result was Roomy and
I came happily home with
«iew dresses, the both of
which cost only $25. Come
see the Pop Shop at 520 Ka
mona just off University.
