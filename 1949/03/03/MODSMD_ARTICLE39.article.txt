## Spectator Courtesy 
### 
Several old timers around the University have been wondering
what has become of Stanford's spectator courtesy at athletic con
tests. They refer to the USC and UCLA contests of two week
ends ago in particular.
When we offered the poor officiating by the referees and the
rough tactics of the visiting teams as excuses, they demanded to
know what that had to do with the students' continued booing—
even during the time an opponent tried to sink his free throw.
"Mob psychology," we said with a shrug of the shoulders.
And yet the old timers complained that this is the first year
they can remember that Farm basketball spectators have been
penalized for poor sportsmanship—or disorderly conduct. In
addition, they said, this is the first year they have noticed a
general tendency among some of the southern division teams
to brush up on their wrestling and boxing lessons during a hoop
match.
The double loss by the team in the Southland last week
raised another question—this time by several students still in
school.
"With the Cal games coming up tomorrow and Saturday," they
stated, "we wonder what the attitude of the spectators will be
now that the team has lost any chance for a division title."
We wonder, too. Every student group will express vocal dis
appointment for a few seconds' time toward a ref's decision or
an opponent's rough play, but few schools can boast of outstand
ing spectator courtesy in all their athletic contests as Stanford has
claimed in past years.
It would be a shame for us to throw away that distinction.
