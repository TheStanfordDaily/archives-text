## Clear Up Some Points 
### 
To the Editor:
Since Dr. Johnston's proposed religious program for Stanford is presently
under discussion, and since he has been tasked to make clear one or more
of its points, now would seem an opportune moment to ask him to explain
another point.
The question of whether or not religious groups are allowed to meet
on campus has customarily been decided by the permanent chaplain of
the University. During the time (hat there was no permanent chaplain,
the matter was handled by the dean of students.
Dr. Johnston's immediate predecessor as permanent chaplain, Dr. Elton
Trueblood, allowed religious meetings on campus. This would seem to
be within his authority.
However, in an article in the most recent issue of the Stanford Alumni
JJeview, Dr. Johnston makes two statements which, in the light of his
decision regarding religious meetings, are perplexing.
He states that under the arrangements of his proposed religious pro
gram " . . . . our young people need not be denied intimate fellowship
with the Christian movements going on so usefully in the United States and
all over the world." This allegation makes the forcing of religious groups
to meet two miles from campus quite inconsistent.
Further on in the article Dr. Johnston remarks that there is an im
mediate need for a "Church House" at Stanfordâ€”"a building located con
tiguous to the Church which can house large and small assembly rooms
and halls for religious meetings . . . ."
He adds that this would be a handsome donation for some alumnus to
make. This is probably true, but it seems somehow illogical to build, in
tne center of the campus, a building which is to house activities which
are not allowed on University property.
I should appreciate it if Dr. Johnston would explain the apparent
incompatibility of his proposed program and of what he is actually doing.
