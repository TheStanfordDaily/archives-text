# Religious Indifference
## 
### 
To the Editor:
With all the present controversy surrounding religion and religious in
d'fference, it might be interesting to speculate on why indifference does
exist, apart from the question of how much indifference we have at
Stanford.
The theoretical prime purpose of college is education, which, though it
is the total of all experience, is usually looked upon as an intellectual
process.
College students, then, are interested in intellectual processes, at least
to a greater extent than average. My contention is that many religious
programs are presented to us in an emotional manner which leaves the
student with a feeling of dissatisfaction.
It is probable that a religion completely devoid of warmth and personal
reactions would be able to claim few advocates. Certainly, I have no
desire to suggest such an emotional void. However, I believe, and perhaps
wiongly so, that a student finds a philosophical consideration of religious
faiths and problems more appealing than the emotional approach, which
c;'tcn is based on more presuppositions than the student would care to
accept without discussion. In a nondenominational program, perhaps the
intellectual approach would be particularly rewarding.
