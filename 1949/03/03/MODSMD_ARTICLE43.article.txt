### Priscilla Claudius 
Actions and Passions by Max Lerner i
(Simon and Schuster)

This is the work of a rational, ob
jective, non-Communistic, non-Wal
laceite liberal. For this reason the
book commands more of the reading
public's intelligent attention because
of this lack of definite political bias.
Lerner has efi'ectively separated
sociology from politics, a rare ac
complishment for a hell-bent re
former. He does not particularly be
lieve in forceful and thereby un
natural legislative liberalism. Rath
er, he tends to point out the spon
taneous growth of liberal ideals in
this country. He tends to classify
the general movement toward a more
liberal social system not as a political
government, such as Wallace fos
tered, but a series of infinitesimal
and "multiple revolutions."
Lerner illustrates many times in
(he book that the liberal tenden
cies in this country have manifested
themselves gradually, and therefore,
naturally. Thus our "liberal ges
tures," rather than having been pro
duced by sudden pressure, dema
goguery, or deceit, have come from
within the people themselves, rather
than from outside pressure from a
group of fire-breathing fanatics.
In other words, people seem to be
heading in that direction already,
and the inciters are unnecessary.
He goes further to point out the fact
that the so-called Progressive Party,
and particularly its candidate, Henry
Wallace, was far more interested in
trying to defeat the Democratic Par
ty than he was in trying to establish
a sincere and practical liberal move
ment.
To support his major thesis that
it is the liberal individual exerting
himself that has brought about these
social revolutions, Lerner cites the
private individuals and the small
organizations which have inde
pendently, and almost unconsciously,
brought about the many changes in
the last 20 years.
These individuals range from
Franklin Roosevelt to the explosive
Leo Durocher, by which Lerner
seeks to prove that each individual
is useful in his own way. And each
has shown that it is still the indi
vidual and not the pressure group,
who will bring about the construc
tive change or gradual amendment of
social problems.
