# The 						Spark that Ignited Be-Bop
## 
### 
NEW YORK I The spark that
ignited the be-bop school of jazz
music is a lonely and rarely seen
pianist who lives in the San Juan
Hill section of New York—a Negro
tenement neighborhood in which all
the dime novel plots you ever saw
about the joys and sorrows of jazz
musicians are continually going on.
This pianist's name is Thelonious
Sphere Monk. Not. for one minute
does he consider himself eccentric.
But:
He wears a thin and scraggly
goatee because lie hates razors. He
wears blue berets because he hates
hats. He is partial to green knit
neckties, and wears gorgeous spec
tacles of gold and silver whose car
hooks are half an inch wide.
Despite a history that is as mixed
and varied as a mythical Balkan
country with a dozen claimants to
the throne, jazz historians and crit
ics are pretty well agreed that The
'onious is the true originator of be
bop.
This form of music is an offshoot
of swing with twitching rhythms
and unmelodic harmonies which
began to make itself felt 10 years
ago and has grown into a recogniz
able movement only in the last two
years.
Orrin Keepnews, a current jazz
writer, credits Monk with being
"one of the very first to play this
style."
Monk says flatly that lie is the
originator of the school. Such be

bop greats as Dizzy Gillespie, Char
lie Parker, and others say they
gathered at Monk's feet 10 years
ago to "hear the new sounds" as he
worked out the chords in after
hour sessions in Minton's Playhouse
in West Harlem.
They found Monk a man with
"great musical imagination," whose
piano has been likened to the sur
realism of Da!i. In the little seven
by-eight-foot room where Monk
broods and culls his mystical
rhythms, there is a photograph in
scribed. "'To Thelonious, my first
and only inspiration — Your boy
Dizzy." Gillespie is a talented trum
peter whose band is billed "King of
Bebop."
Technically, be-bop is character
ized by the accenting of passing
notes, especially flatted fifth and
ninths. It is a dissonant and stac
cato spasm, played at breakneck
pace. As boogie-woogie went back
to Bach, be-bop must have some
kind of kinship with Stravinsky.
Aside from occasional profession
al appearances and in record cut
ting sessions at Blue Note Records.
Thelonious is ral'ely seen.
He was born in the same small
shabby apartment on San Juan Hill
where he lives today with his
mother.
So peculiar in habit is this
brooding musician that he has been
known to refuse jobs which were
sorely needed, preferring to remain
in the little room which some call
the inner sanctum of be-bop. Here

time to hear him play. On occasi
they bring food.
Though Thelonious nt 30 is hen
with inspiration, lie doesn't wo
much at commercializing his wai
—a circumstance that makes 1
mother unhappy.
"Thelonious lacks push," she h
said to friends.
His behavior at the piano is sin
lar to his life —he broods and coi
poses for two days and nights wit
out pause. He is as likely to i
four or five meals in a few hoi
and sleep for two days.

There is seldom a casual accej
ance of he-hop. It is all the way.
not at all. Some critics refer to
as evidence of a neurotic world.
Thelonious plays only his t>\
compositions. Among his new<
numbers are "Off Minor" and "Wt
You Needn't." A famous Mo
number is "Epistrophy.' which
identifies as "a reversion from t
abnormal to the normal."
Women attempt to ambush h
from time to time and plot to sh;
his idle moments. One girl w
lived in the same apartment buil
ing came every day to clean
wash his dishes. His friends say s
idolized him, placing cigarettes
his mouth and lighting them, t
he rarely spoke to her.
"Women are a heckle," Theloi
ous says, speaking for himself,
don't want to be tied down to an
thing but music."
