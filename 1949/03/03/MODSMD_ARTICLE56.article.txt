### BILL SWIGART 
It's a pity that baseball pennants aren't won with black and white beans
and laws of probability.
Because if they were, then we're sure that Stanford's all-time baseball
record would be much better than it actually is.
For during the 22-year existence of the California Intercollegiate Base-
I all Association, Stanford's red-clad horsehiders have won the CIBA flag
cniy once—in 1931. It's been 18 years since a baseball championship has been
returned to the Farm; and considering that there are only six teams in
the league, even the scholarly little man over in the Statistics Department
who's never seen a ball game in his life will agree with us that Stan
ford's number should come up pretty soon now.
To win a pennant it takes baseball players—good baseball players—
something that Stanford hasn't had too many of.
For some reason or another the line art of hitting and throwing a ball
has been neglected here on the Farm. For many years now baseball has
bf:en a major sport orphan at Stanford.
There have been no "Vow Boys" or "Laughing Boy" eras in Stanford
baseball history—just the second division every year.
But taking a look over this year's roster, we can't help thinking that
things might be a little bit better this season. Not a whole lot better,
mind you, but perhaps improved enough to bring Coach Harry Wolter
his first pennant in 18 years.
Although far from great, this year's Card baseball team seems to be
adequate in almost every branch of play. Pitching and catching looks
good, the outfield will be outstanding, but infield play is questionable.
The Card pitching staff, built around veteran southpaw Dave Dahle
t'lid lanky right-hander Frank Laßrum, may be the best in the CIBA
I tijis season.
Smooth-working Dave Dahle, to be remembered for his one-hitter
against UCLA last season, has been one of the leading CIBA mound per
formers for two years. He has a fair variety of pitches, good control, and
should be a consistent winner this year.
Laßrum and Dahle Pace Mound Corps
Curve-balling Frank Laßrum, victor over Cal last spring, may be the
best college hurler on the Coast this year. Easy-going Frank throws 'em
all, but a big looping curve is his Sunday pitch.
Backing up Laßrum and Dahle on the hill will be rangy Jim Claypool,
up from the frosh, and veteran right-hander Dave Stott. Claypool has
plenty of natural stuff and is chiefly a fast ball pitcher. Stott, a top-flight
performer two years ago, has been troubled by a sore arm and has not
thrown much so far.
Behind the plate, it's more of the same with heavyweights Frank Mc-
Craw, Jim Castagnoli, and Dick Clegg handling the backstop duties.
"Penguin" McGraw, playing his fourth (or is it his fortieth?) year of
i varsity ball rightly deserves the title of the Grand Old Man of Stanford
Baseball. He can hit at times, throws well, and knows every batter in
; the league like a book.
Behind McGraw are Castagnoli and Clegg. Both have plenty of savvy,
1 and it's a shame that all three can't get into the lineup at the same time.
If Coach Harry Wolter is smiling the next time you see him out on
j the Sunken Diamond, then you can probably figure he's thinking about
his starting outfit—it's that sweet.
Roaming the center patch is consistent Charlie Cole, a Daily all-CIBA
j first base selection last season. Cole would be a "natural" at any position
j! and is taking to his outfield chores like a duck to water.
Swinging his big yellow war club from the port side of the plate, three-
I! C Cole pounded out a lusty .375 percentage in CIBA play last year.
Returning to his right field berth in Coach Harry Wolter's starting nine
; is blasting Bob Nava—another .300 slugger. Nava also swings from the
j left side, and packs plenty of wallop up there at the dish.
Klein Will Be a Bij; Help
Husky Bud Klein looks like the "find" of the year out in left field. In-
J eligible last spring, Klein seems to do everything well, and he owns one
1 o! the best throwing arms on the squad.
The infield is the big question mark. As goes the infield, so will go
| Stanford this spring'.
j Captain Bill Arce, back for his third season of varsity ball, is one of
1 t'ne steadiest all-around performers on the squad, and will perhaps be
| the outstanding hot corner man in the CIBA during the coming campaign,
j Arce batted over .300 last year, and will probably hit from the leadoff
l spot once the flag race gets under way.
But after third base, things drop off a bit. Cleanup hitter Dave Melton
can pound out the ball with the best of them, but when it comes to playing
shortstop, that's something else again. In his first two games he com
mitted three errors, and he is occasionally guilty of holding on to the
J p. II too long.
i However, the position is new to him, and with more work in the short
I patch Dave could develop into a pretty good leather man. As long as he
' continues to drive in more runs than he lets in, Dave's going to be a good
I man to have around.
A Good Fielder, But . . .
Second baseman Ray Winterhalter is just the other way around. A
j pretty good fielder, little Ray doesn't show much promise of hitting the
boll very hard.
First base is "uncertain" to say the least. Cole's departure to the out
field leaves a big hole at first base but neither of the likely candidates.
Bob "Whitey" Larson or Jack Barnes appears capable of completely
fii ling Consistent Charlie shoes. However, they may develop. Footballer
Kin Rose may work in later, but has been troubled with a sore arm.
It's not a great club by any means, but to our way of thinking—adequate.
It wouldn't surprise us a bit if, one of these days, we should pick up a
j newspaper and discover that someone has burst into print with a predic
tion that Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford baseballers will win the CIBA
j pennant this season.
We wouldn't think of doing such a thing ourselves—even though the
• Woltermen do look like a good pre-season bet.
| With the complete el foldo of our one ninth-in-the-nation basketball
! tram, we've finally come around to the decision that we've predicted one
j Stanford victory too many. In the hereafter we'll turn our "kiss-of-death"
B forecasts loose on somebody else's ball club—preferably Cal or UCLA.
Leave poor Stanford alone.
