# Indian Hoopsters Prep For Weekend Basement Battle
## 
### JOHN HALL 
With all pressure of the conference cage race tossed aside,
Stanford's Indians will settle down this weekend to do battle with
the basement-residing Golden Bears from Berkeley.
The two teams meet at Stanford Pavilion tomorrow night, start
ing at 8, and at Berkeley Saturday night, tipoff set for 8:30.

The Indians must gain at least a
split to avoid ending up in the base
ment for the second straight year.
Theie will be preliminary games
both night. Cal and Stanford frosh
get together at 6:15 Friday night,
and meet again Saturday at 5:45.
Stanford Braves will close out
their season with two tilts against
the Blues, tipping off Friday after
noon at 3. and Saturday night at 7.
Cards Seek to End Loss Streak
Plagued by an assortment of bad
breaks, Los Angeles jinx games, and
an overdose of lax officiating', Stan
lord will be giving its final push of
the season in an effort to junk a 7-
game losing streak.
California, starting the season as
the first team to win the Pacific
Coast Tournament, has lost its last
four games and has won only one
conference game all season.
Thus far this season, Stanford has
beaten Cal twice while losing once.
The lone Bear win came in the
finals of the Cow Palace PCC tourn
ament in December.
The two Card victories came in
league play in January, and were
featured around the 66-65 thriller at
Berkeley, and the 55-48 ease-in at
the Pavilion.
If Stanford wins both games this
weekend it will mark the second
time it has won four games from
California in one season.
Davidson, Stephenson End Careers
Playing their last game for the
Indians and eager to supply the
punch for a clean sweep, will be
Dave Davidson and Bill Stephenson,
two gentlemen who always go well
against the Bears.
Other graduating cagers include
Bob Whip Lewis. Milt Iverson, Bill
Piose, Dick Sehutte, Bill Lewis, and
Jack Scharfen.
Bill Stephenson, the soft-spoken
Card captain, will close out three
years of first-string play at the cen
ter spot. In his first two seasons,
Steve led the Stanford five in scor
ing. He has been a great clutch
performer, a steady man on the
backboards, and an inspiration to
his teammates.
Steve's two game-winning buck
ets. one at the last second against
Santa Clara, and the other at the
same time against San Jose, were
standouts of the 1949 cage season.
Dave Davidson is also finishing
his third season of first-string play.
Big Dave was captain of the varsity
in his sophomore year and has been
the spark of Stanford's 1949 outfit.

He is a leading choice for all
division and Coast honors.
Mike O'Neill Out
Out to reduce Stanford's 17 and
9 season record to even lower pro
portions will be Nibs Price's incon
sistent Bears, who will probably
have to plav without the services
of Mike O'Neill.
O'Neill, the Bears' leading scorer,
turned his ankle in the USC game
and might not be able to respond
in time.
Practice sessions in the Pavilion
this week indicate that Everett Dean
might go back to the fast break for
the Bears. Looking very potent
Tuesday night was Gus Chavalas,
who was bringing the ball down
court with lightning speed.
Also expecting to see fast break
action is Gay Bryan, made-over
trackster, who turned in some good
work against USC last weekend.
