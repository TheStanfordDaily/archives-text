# Bailey Stresses Ethics in School
## 
### 
Too litt'e ethics is being taught I
I
now in schools, brought out Dr.
Margery Bailey in her talk at the
Women's Vocom meeting last night.
Dr. Bailey began by saying that
women in professional fields have
to be far superior to the men in
order to succeed. And, furthermore,
she said, a woman must never tor
get that she is a woman, because
she can get farther by femininity
than by assuming masculinity and
belligerence.
A woman who follows a career
must resign herself to living alone
and facing her difficulties alone. 1
The life of a teacher. Dr. Bailey
said, is much like that of a clergy- 1
man, for both have to abide by the
rules: poverty, chastity, and obe
dience. And a teacher must be a

purveyor of ethics, as a minister is;
students depend upon their instruc
tors not only for factual knowledge
but for spiritual knowledge.
Every subject — biology, history,
literature—should in some way be
connected with the life a student
is living. To teach understanding of
life as well as curriculum should be
the aim of a university, she con
cluded.
