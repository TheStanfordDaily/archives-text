# Brass Choir Will Make Its 1949 Debut
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
If Stanford students were im
pressed with the musical drive and
power of Benny Goodman's eight -
piece brass section, they should cer
tainly bend an ear to Julius Shu

chat's 12-piece "brass combo." This
organization will make its 1949 de
but in the balcony of Memorial
Church for the Founders' Day pro
gram next Wednesday morning.
Although the group will appear
on the formal program as the Stan
ford Brass Choir, it must be noted
that brass chamber music was rec
ognized - is top entertainment for
festivals, dances, fairs, and tower
concerts during the 16th and 17th
centuries.
The ensemble has chosen some of
the "tower music" for next week's
program. They will play Sonata No.
'1 from "Hora Decima" by Johann
Pezel. The title is appropriate, for
this melody was played by the
Leipzig tower musicians at 10
o'clock in the daily concerts during
the ltiTO's.
The Committee on Public Exer

cises has obligingly scheduled the
Founders' Day program for 10 a.m.
so that the brass music can again
be presented at the "correct" time.
This composition is highly effective
ceremonial music which requires
excessive variability in dynamics
an:l rante as well as difficult lip
control. The fugue theme is inter
woven among the trumpet, trom
bone, baritone, French horn, and
tuba parts and ends with a re
sounding' crescendo.
All the Renaissance music which
the brass choir plays was written
originally for the ancestors of pres
ent-day instruments, according to
the director. Mr. Shuchat. The choir
members laughingly joke about
their instruments formerly known
as "cornetts" and "sagbuts." Prob
ably Tommy Dorsey never has
known that he plays one of the
latter species.
If a person looks back at the
6th century, he can imagine the
formal invitations which might
have read something like. "Gabriel
Gabrieli and his cornett - sagbut
combo will open at the Venetian
Gardens for Countess de Vara's tea
party and May dance at sundown
on the fifteenth."

members laughingly joke about
their instruments formerly known
as "cornetts" and "sagbuts." Prob
ably Tommy Dorsey never has
known that he plays one of the
latter species.
If a person looks back at the
6th century, he can imagine the
formal invitations which might
have read something like. "Gabriel
Gabrieli and his cornett - sagbut
combo will open at the Venetian
Gardens for Countess de Vara's tea
party and May dance at sundown
on the fifteenth."
