artisan speakers on any subject
always given free reign to speak
Stanford so long as opposition
ups are also represented to give
r points of view, said Dean
lpton last night on KSU's
nd - table program, "Interview
h Dean Kimpton."
e was clarifying the position of
University regarding partisan
itics on campus.
What prevents men like Profes-
Phillips, recently of the Univer
sal Washington, from speaking on
lpus is a stipulation in the l'ound
grant of tne University which
aids use of the buildings and
unds for partisan politics," the
n explained.
An appeal to the California
its would be necessary to
nge this regulation."
'he absence of speakers on the
ent national elections, he said,
s due to the fact that the Com
tee on Public Exercises was un
e to siinultaneously produce the
uired speakers.
!ound - table speakers opposing
University's stand contended that
â€¢h a stand denied them a full ed
ition. Students should be allowed
hear what any speaker is trying
sell regardless of his political
ws or whether there is opposi

tion prsent to refute his argu
ments, they said.
"There is a difference between
education and propaganda," replied
Dean Kimpton. "'ln order to be in
line with University regulations,
we must present both sides at the
same time. This is impossible if
we represent only one point oi
view.'"
Participants on the program, in
addition to Dean Kimpton, were
Naomi Grossberg, Tom Lupher,
Bruce Mitchell, John Motheral, and
l ed Is or ton.
