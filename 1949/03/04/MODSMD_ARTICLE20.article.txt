WASHINGTON, March 3 (/I 1 ). â€”
President Truman today accepted
the resignation of Secretary of De
tense James V. Forrestal and chose
for the post Louis A. Johnson, who
was Army mobilizer on the eve of
World War 11.
It confirmed by the Senate, as is
expected, Johnson will take over
from Forrestal on March 31.
The 58-year-old Johnson, a West
Virginia and Washington lawyer,
becomes head man in the Pentagon
in the midst of America's most gi
gantic peacetime military prepara
tions.
As Assistant Secretary of War
under Franklin D. Roosevelt he di
rected the planning for Army mo
bilization a decade ago. Last fall, he
was fund raiser for the Truman
campaign tor the Presidency.
Forrestal, fust man to head the
Army, Navy, and Air Force under
the unification act, was the last re
maining member of the Roosevelt
cabinet.
President Truman's decision to
put a new man in Forrestal's place
had long been rumored. However,
as is customary in such cases, the
White House today made public
correspondence in which Forrestal
urged acceptance of his resignation
for "urgent personal considera

tions" and the President "reluctant
ly" acquiesced.
Praising Forrestal highly, Mr.
Truman wrote him:
'"Your entire service has been
characterized by vision, foresight,
and a broad appreciation of the
vital importance of relating our
military potential to the require
ments of our national policy."
Johnson inherits a $15,000,000,000
defense program, a vast arming of
America stemming from difficulties
with Russia. He takes over from
man foremost in advocating a
"tough" policy in dealing with Com
munist expansion.
The new Secretary is handed the
difficult job of achieving harmony
under the unification program
