## Protestant Non-Sectarian 
### 
To the Editor:
The letter, signed by Messrs. Chaffey, Gripp, and Sage, advocating the
University being officially declared "Protestan non-sectarian" or .something
more "truly representative of the various faiths found in the student body"
dm s not necessarily reflect the view of the Episcopal Church.
Although there are about 2,000 Episcopalians at Stanford, I know few
who advocate Stanford's being declared Episcopal.
There is no particular reason why Stanford should be declared "Protes
t; nt non-sectarian" or anything else. At the present, Roman Catholics
are forbidden to participate in non-Roman services, and Jews, by the nature
of their faith, do not choose to do so except on a limited basis. There
fore mainly Protestants participate. Why then, the need for any declara
tion?
For many years Stanford has had Episcopal chaplains, perhaps because
of the many Episcopalians here. The Episcopal Church neither objects
to nor particularly encourages participation in non-denominational ac
tivities; Episcopalians presumably know their first duty is to The Church.
Mrny Protestant faiths may have similar altitudes.
To my knowledge, no proposal for an official religious declaration has
ever come before Interfaith Council. The Episcopal Church does not at
tempt to force its faith upon others. This may help clarify the impression
the Chaffey-Gripp-Sage letter may have on some:
1. That the Episcopal Church opposes campus religious activity, and
li. That it tavors some sort of declaration, perhaps in favor of Angli
canism. Neither is the case.
