# Academic Freedom Committee

To the Editor:
Some misconceptions wrought by The Daily both editorially and other
wi.se, regarding the Academic Freedom Committee, need to be corrected.
First,'said committee in applying for use of the Boy Scout Amphitheater
inlormed the Scotu office that: 1. The group applying was the Stanford
Academic Freedom Committee.
2. It wished to hold a public discussion on the question of academic
freedom, and
Several speakers would appear.
'\ his explanation so satisfied the Boy Scout Office that it twice con
finned the transaction. Obviously any alibis offered by the Scout office
to the effect that the committee was a group of Scouts planning' a wiener
lOr-st are pure rationalization, merely serving the purpose of extrication
tu in an embarrassing positionâ€”which position, I might add. the removal
therefrom was an open attack on freedom of speech.
Second, the editorial analogy between the committee and the Student
Progressives represents a direct falsification of fact. The majority of
committee members, including the chairman, Carl Stover, do not belong
to any Progressive organizations.
These are only a minute percentage of The Daily's misrepresentations
1 egaiding libeial and progressive organizations. The excuse of inexperience
no longer suffices to explain the consistent blundering of The Daily on
such issues.
