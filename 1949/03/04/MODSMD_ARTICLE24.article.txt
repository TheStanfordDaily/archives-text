# Should Communists Teach?
## 
### BY GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Tuesday night, over ABC's "Town
Meeting of the Air." a subject of
general interest to the Stanford
scholastic community was aired. It
was "Should Communists Be Al
lowed To Teach in Our Colleges?"
The evident growing support for
the negative is a reminder to this
writer of the debate Stassen and
Dewey held in Oregon before the
Republican Convention of '48 on the
subject of whether the Communist
Party should he outlawed. Dewey
said "no"; Stassen said "yes." Most
of the American people agreed with
Dewey's case then; Stassen lost the
convention.
Tides of opinion and events seem
to be enhancing Stassen's position
and perhaps Stassen, eventually, in
the minds of the public.
Here is a rather ,brief review of
the Town Meeting broadcast. Many
of the words given by the two
speakers below have been para
phrased or condensed.
IMi\ George V. Denny: (The pro
grain's moderator) There is a body
of opinion in our country that be
lieves Communist affiliation and
American citizenship is incongruous
.... Speaking on the negative of
our question, "Should Communists
Be Allowed To Teach in Our Col
leges'.' we have the President of
Saiah Lawrence College, Dr. Harold
Taylor. He thinks that Mr. Allen
made a big mistake in firing the
Communist instructors.
Taylor: Communists should not he
excluded from teaching in American
Colleges. I don t defend the Com

munists; if we start excluding Com
munists, we'll end up excluding any
one with something new, interesting,
or provocative in the way of ideas.
A teacher is a citizen; he should
have a citizen's rights .... as long
as he doesn't inject his doctrine into
his classroom. Our question should
be, "Is he fair and a good teacher?"
That should be our only criterion.
American students are quick to
detect partisan views in their in
structors and are equally quick to
reject them.
Only three out of 1.500 on the
University of Washington staff were
considered dangerous; yet through
their years there they hadn't been
proven to ruin the youth. It took an
Un-Ameican Affairs Committee to
ferret this out . . . (laughter).
We should judge any man by his
honesty. The daily encounter with
truth should be open and free,
otherwise there is a lack ol' nerve
on our part.
Denny: Next wc have a physician
turned educator. He has been on
the University of Minnesota faculty,
he has keen the Executive Dean of
Illinois Colleges, and he is now the
President of the University of
Washington. A few weeks ago, Dr.
Raymond B. Allen dismissed three
of his faculty for being Communists.
Allen: The Communists shouldn't
be able to teach in American col
leges. because they are not free men
. . . Our educational institutions are
the foundations of freedom .... I
contend that since society must pro
vide the conditions of freedom, those
teaching must seek and teach the

truth. This is their first obligation
as teachers of free men. Any re
straint on their (the teachers') free
dom is a road block on the road of
education.
We have studied this situation
carefully; we have proved beyond
doubt that the Communists are
slaves to dogma. A Communist has
abdicated control over his intellec
tual life; a teacher can't be a whole
man and be half slave.
I insist the issue between Com
munism and education is the effect
Communism has on the teacher and
his ability to teach. It is qot a mat
ter of civil rights.
Can you imagine a teacher oper
ating in the field of biology who
would toss out the Mendelian con
cepts and operate under those of the
Lysenko doctrine? Can you imagine
a philosopher committed to support
universal military training in Rus
sia and to be against it in the United
States?
A teacher with weird reasoning
like this . . . is .. . not free . . .
not competent to be a teacher . . .
not intellectually honest ... a slave.
I hold he is in neglect of the most
essential duty of a teacher, intel
lectual honesty and freedom.
Denny: Next, we have the director
of the American Civil Liberties
Union, a graduate of Harvard Uni
versity, an Overseer there of the
Economics Department. Roger Bald
win is steadfastly opposed to Mr.
Allen's views.
