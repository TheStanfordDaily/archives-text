### PAUL C. JOHNSTON Chaplain 
Now that we have your attention,
and as this quarter comes to an end,
I can afford to write more soberly :
and for clarification.
I am very glad for Fred Wheeler's '
second letter, just as I was interested !
in his first. As for the indifference
to religion which bothers him, of
course it exists. How widespread it 1
is awaits surer measurement than
may yield to impressions any indi
vidual or even group may gain.
Given the basic thesis that every
person is by nature inescapably re
ligious, it follows that current in
attention may occur from many j
causes.
Among them I would list: an im
mature ranking of values, an over
confident rationalization, a disregard
of historic or personal experience, |
a disgust about either the organiza- 1
tions of religion or its professional !
representatives, or some inadequate
or bad theology.
Added to these must be absorption i
in the pursuit ol certain "pleasures,"
which are frowned upon by ethical
religion, with reaction against the j
latter since desire votes status to i
the former. These are not all the
reasons for indifference which occur
to me—they are enough with which
to begin to assess the situation.
Of all these causes, I believe that
inadequate or bad theology is most
guilty. Inadequate? Willard Sperry
ol Harvard, in his advice to teachers
and parents, warns:
"Never teach your child as true
something which is not true for !
you."
Yet many young men and women '
emerge into college years bearing
the impress of a religious faith
which has been unreasonable, nar
row, or literalistic. When the pov
erty of its intellectual content meets 1
the method and wealth of the class- '
room, its possessor is tempted—not
to "fight his doubts, gather faith, not
to make his judgment blind, and so
find a finer faith his own"—but to

discard the whole business.
Bad theology? I would say that
religious fears with all their psycho
logical entail that spawn from un
worthy ideas of God and from con
sequent notions of His dealings with
us, are potent illustrations. Every
one who has worked long in the
parish ministry is keenly aware of
their destructive influence.
Bad theology differs from good
theology with the latter's Christian
distinction. I speak, of course, from
the point of view of a Christian
minister. Even within Christian
theology there are ranks and levels;
yet I refer to the higher and more
refined interpretations.
To me, for instance, it is bad theol
ogy to speak of God as implacable
Judge and to neglect His mercy—to
so center upon His "wrath" as to
crowd out His love.
Someone has asked what I mean
by the difference between "good"
religions and "bad" religions.
The above is what I mean. I also
mean that religions do not command
my respect which depend for their
continuance on parroted shibboleths,
whose emotional content is in pro
portion to the absence of thought,
and whose methods are therefore
either cheap or shoddy and cannot
elicit the admiration of intelligent
people.
Folk who have a healthy-minded
and rationally-supported religion
are much concerned in these days
because of the rank growth of the
fringe-cults and the recrudescence
of superstitions in religion.
The religious approach which I
shall consistently advocate and en
courage on the Stanford campus is
one which welcomes Truth from
whatever quarter it may appear and
challenges that it A>e put to the test
with whatever equipment we pos
sess.
I know that the final word will
never lie with Reason, for that word
rests in both life's warm experiences
and in the soul's "invincible sur
mise." But the reasoning faculty is
one of God's rich endowments, and
we are meant to use it to the full.
This is my answer to the friend
who wants to know if there is to be
opportunity to discuss religious mat
ters "in an atmosphere of mutual re
spect, tolerance, and equality." It

! likewise guarantees room 01
| proposed Council of Religiou:
! tivities for faiths and opinions
j than those of Christianity, as
; they will wish to participate.
Finally, religion that is "lore.
! not true religion; it is its gl
shadow. There is no intention
tempting to coerce Stanford sti
into religious concern or an u
ling acceptance of dogma. Onl
honest election of data that is
j suasive to the fair mind is in
It is because I have such <
i dence in the ultimate fairne
i mind of the majority of stu
here that 1 believe the faniout
i difference" of some or many of
may be overcome.
A lew have taken umbrage <
so-called "aggressiveness." Is
think that all and sundry
welcome a "rustling of the
bones!"
But I have been mis-read
aggressiveness is not for the sa
imposing a faith; it is to dra\
tent ion to the offerings. And
to bring to corporate consciou
what I believe are the wishes c
majority on this campus for
| more religious information, a
I chance both to test their fai
| community and to put it vital
work.
To this latter end diseussior
study groups are our intention
deed, several have already
formed and are meeting. 3
more, under competent leadei
will be coming on. To this end
agreed that more of the formal
sentation of religious ideas and
tory will be offered within the
eral education structure of the
versity.
To this end the Council is de:
both to make student religious 1
' vocal, and to supply the prope
j sponse.
Into this democratic advei
i everyone who has, or may hav
j interest is invited. It is a mutu
; as I have so often stressed bo
j public utterance and in these
1 pers.
The religious quest has beer
fined as that community of pe
| who are the "Seekers and Fit
ol God." May such a purpos
the temper, and may it defim
I direction, of our endeavors.
