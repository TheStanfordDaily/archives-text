### 
Proponents of socialized medicine
in the United States would find
more sympathetic listeners at San
Jose Slate than at Stanford, accord
ing to a comparison of two polls
conducted by Roger Goodfriend.
pre-med student at Stanford. Re
sults of his Stanford poll were pub
lished in The Daily several weeks
ago.
Of the total number of students
polled at San Jose, 37.5 per cent
advqeated government - controlled
medical care plans, while at Stan
ford, only 24.2 per cent were in
favor of the idea. The majority of
students at both schools, however,
prefer private to socialized medicine.
Main reasons contributing to the
difference of opinion between the
two schools, Goodfriend reports, ap
pear to be the generally lower in
comes of the families of San Jose
students and the higher frequency of
doctors in the families of Stanford
students. Nearly half of the San
Jose students polled were from fam
ilies earning less than $5,000,. while
less than one-sixth of Stanford stu
dents' families are in that income
bracket.
"One interesting thing I noticed,"
Goodfriend said, "was the tendency
of students supporting socialized
medicine to be less sure of them
selves than students who were
against it. Opponents of the plan

were less hesitant and wore
convinced of their stand."
Reasons most frequently givei
opposition to socialized med
were the expected reduction ir
quality of medical treatment
the loss of close relationship bet
patient and doctor under gov
ment medical pians.
Those supporting socialized n
cine pointed to the eliminatio
high medical costs which enal
person to be treated for all ailn
at a small expense. National h<
standards, they claim, would
raised considerably.
Another discrepancy between
Jose and Stanford is seen ar
students who favor socialized n
cine. Nearly three-fourths of
Stanford students advocating
plan prefer themselves to be trc
by private practitioners. A like
centage of San Jose students p
treatment under government rr
than private programs.
'"The difference again." says G
friend, "appears to be the lowei
come of San Jose students who
socialized medicine for financial
sons. Stanford students suppo
the program apparently are 100
at it from a humanitarian v
point."

Proponents of socialized medicine
in the United States would find
more sympathetic listeners at San
Jose Slate than at Stanford, accord
ing to a comparison of two polls
conducted by Roger Goodfriend.
pre-med student at Stanford. Re
sults of his Stanford poll were pub
lished in The Daily several weeks
ago.
Of the total number of students
polled at San Jose, 37.5 per cent
advqeated government - controlled
medical care plans, while at Stan
ford, only 24.2 per cent were in
favor of the idea. The majority of
students at both schools, however,
prefer private to socialized medicine.
Main reasons contributing to the
difference of opinion between the
two schools, Goodfriend reports, ap
pear to be the generally lower in
comes of the families of San Jose
students and the higher frequency of
doctors in the families of Stanford
students. Nearly half of the San
Jose students polled were from fam
ilies earning less than $5,000,. while
less than one-sixth of Stanford stu
dents' families are in that income
bracket.
"One interesting thing I noticed,"
Goodfriend said, "was the tendency
of students supporting socialized
medicine to be less sure of them
selves than students who were
against it. Opponents of the plan

were less hesitant and wore
convinced of their stand."
Reasons most frequently givei
opposition to socialized med
were the expected reduction ir
quality of medical treatment
the loss of close relationship bet
patient and doctor under gov
ment medical pians.
Those supporting socialized n
cine pointed to the eliminatio
high medical costs which enal
person to be treated for all ailn
at a small expense. National h<
standards, they claim, would
raised considerably.
Another discrepancy between
Jose and Stanford is seen ar
students who favor socialized n
cine. Nearly three-fourths of
Stanford students advocating
plan prefer themselves to be trc
by private practitioners. A like
centage of San Jose students p
treatment under government rr
than private programs.
'"The difference again." says G
friend, "appears to be the lowei
come of San Jose students who
