# Fernandel Clowns, Makes Faces In French Comedy
## 
### AL BERRY 
Mawgawd!
Once again the Guild Theater, lo
cal home of foreign flicks, has bar
rel-rol'ed into the winner's circle.
"Francis I" is as refreshing as a
bucket of suds on a hot day.and is
the funniest thing to hit these parts
since the Hist of the Hope-Crosby
road shows.
For those who liked greatness and
magnificent characterization, the
Guild showed "Carmen"; for those
with an eye for adventure, "The
Blood Red Rose"' filled the bill; for
the students who go for powerful
drama, "The King's Jester" was the
>hing. Now. for anybody with a
funnybone. Ihe French have turned
out (with subtitles) the incompar
able Fernandel and "Francis I."
The ticket - buyer leaving the
Guild will probably think of three
things. First, that somebody in
France has read Mark Twain's
"Connecticut Yankee" and made the
best of it. Secondly, that that fool
Fernandel is wonderful in his best
part. And thirdly, that "Francis I"
is undoubtedly the "loosest" picture
on record. And the ticket-buyer
will be right on all counts.
Plot Incidental
The plot—which is only inciden
tal—deals with a likeable but frus
trated chap (Fernandel) who is hyp
notized back from a 1949 carnival
tent to 1520 and the court of the
passionate Francis I of France. From
there on Fernandel is much like
Twain's Yankee, and the sight of
the 16th century court —in full pe
riod regalia—doing the turkey trot
is almost worth the price of admis
sion. But that is just the start, and
only a small part of the nonsense
thai will keep most patrons roar
ing in the Guild's tricky seats.
But by far the greatest asset to
the film's success is that man Fer
nandel. His facial expressions are
beycncl the realm of description, so
we won't try. He belongs in the

"ya-gotta-see-it-to-be lieve-it" de
partment. From his oblong feet to
his hideous puss. France's Fernan
del is the greatest "yuk" in years.
Risque Humor
When we say that "Francis" is
loose, we mean it. The picture's
various mid wives have thought of
nearly every great burlesque gag.
except the stripper, and tossed it in
for laughs. They have a deadly trial
by combat that ends up in a grunt
and groan session; a deaf ghost with
a flashlight; the Inquisition, whose
members resemble the Ku Klux
Klan; and above all, Fernandel, who
is a big enough joke in himself.
But this throwing together of a mil
lion and one laughs has been done
with a fortunate degree of good
sense. It avoids the slapstick stage,
but is, again, loose enough to keep
moving like fury most of the way.
Our principle adverse criticism is
of the subtitles, which could have
been much better. Granted that
Fernandel's humor doesn't need
words to express it. we still like to
know what is being said all the
time. The subtitles were good
enough to keep the audience in the
plot, but not good enough to keep
the pic from dragging in places
where it had no business to drag.
Fortunately the slow places are few
and far between. But still the
French could take some subtit'e les
sons from their Italian neighbors.
We like "Francis I." It gets our
special four-bell award for humor,
as well as the tag: "don't miss this
one." The picture, nice people, is
one way to keep dtad week from
being completely dead. Go and see
it.and put in a couple of "yuks" for
us.
