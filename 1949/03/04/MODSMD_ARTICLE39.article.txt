# Old Boy Dolls Up For 'Vogue' Issue
## 
### 
(Ed. note: At least this is all
from thcr.i for a month or so.)
That distinguished fellow in the
Brooks Brothers' suit and the horn
rimmed glasses you have been see
ing around the campus lately isn't a
transfer from Harvard. It's the Old
Boy. His sartorial impeccability is
the direct result from the long
: hours of research into the world of
ashion and gracious living which
have produced the enlarged 'Vague" i
| issue of the Chappie.
j For this issue the Old Bov has
[ set aside his customary sledge in
I favor of the daintier, but just as ,
; lethal, stiletto. Said stiletto has J
! been thrust full into the well-mas- ,
soured back of the "Vogue" maga
j zinc and twisted a couple of times
; for good measure.
New life will be inserted into
] dead week with articles, art, and
photographs on travel, fashion, and I
manners. Everything to transform
| roughs into smooths, and sows into j
I well-clad sophisticates.
j Send the chauffeur down early '
i Wednesday for your copies.
