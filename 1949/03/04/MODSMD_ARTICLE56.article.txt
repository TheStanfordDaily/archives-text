# Far East Exhibit in Art Gallery Features Persian Rug Collection
## 
### 
Twenty-seven exceptional Persian
rugs are hanging in the Art Gallery
this month as part of the new Mid
dle East exhibit. Collected pains
takingly since 1922 by Professor of
History Carl F. Brand, each rug has

a particular history as well as its
j own distinct colors and design.
The handwoven patterns for the !
j most part show geometric order and
; balance with much emphasis on i
i heavy blues and crimson. All of the
! tugs are very closely woven, ranging
from the usual 200 up to 444 knots
j per square inch. The collection is
remarkably well preserved,
many of the rugs dating to the 1790's
and early nineteenth century.
The rare Persian paintings loaned j
to the Gallery by William P. Cleary :
| of San Francisco are exquisitely dei
| tailed and tinted with stimulating
colors. A single squirrel's hair was
used to achieve much of the finest !
work in these prints.
Elaborate Persian armor from the ;
! Stanford Museum, and textile work
from the Middle East are also dis
played in the show.
Mr. Cearly will discuss the paint- j
ings before the public at the Art
Gallery at 3 p.m. Sunday.
