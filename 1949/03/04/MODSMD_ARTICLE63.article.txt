LOS ANGELES. March 3 (/Pi.—
The UCLA basketball team staged
a final drill iale today for its all
iniportant series with Southern
California, but impartial observers
al! but counted the Uclans out of
the title race in the Southern Divi
; sion of the Pacific Coat Conference.
The Bruin hopes took a nosedive
when crack forward Alan Sawyer
i was lost from the series becausc of
nn emergency appendectomy last
, night, and more worries burdened
Coach John Wooen today.
! His other starting forward. Chuck
Clustka, and regular guard Ron
j Pearson are both weak and ailing
from virus ailments, and both may
1 see only limited action tomorrow
and Saturday nights.
USC and UCLA go into the series
tied for the division lead, each with
eight wins and two losses.
Sawyer, with loS) points in con
! ference competition, was hieh point
man for the Bruins, but his re
j placement, Ralph Joeckel, while ap
pearing in 20 games, has caged only
13 points in conference play.
Coach Sam Barry of USC. who
has had his share of player ail—
) merits all season —but never to his
J star, Bill Sharman, or in such
heavy doses—also sent his Trojans
I through a brisk workout and pro
nounced the team in good condition.
