### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanfor d's
mitmen invade the California Men's
Gymnasium at Berkeley tonight in
their final intercollegiate match of
the season.
The Bears won here at the Farm
last week by virtue of a forfeit
match, but Coach Lunny and his
charges are confident they can even
the count when the two squads tan
gle again tonight.
The Lunnymen will he without
the services of both their top
heavyweights. Mike Pelsinger and
Emery Mitchell. Pelsinger suffered
a broken nose earlier in the year,
whil? Mitch has received doctor's
orders to keep his achin:, jaw out
of the ring this week.
Charles Blown will fill the gap,
fighting the Bears' mobile Campa
nile, John Groff, in the heavyweight !
feature. The towering Groff lost a
decision to Mitchell last Friday.
Light-heavy Jim Hammond, who
has won four and lost one this year,
will face Jack Lamke in the 175-
pound headliner. Lamke went to
the semi-finals of the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate 165-pound competi
tion in 1&1£ but has been unable '
to make the lighter weight this sea
son.
A second fight in this division will
match the Cards' Jim Vatcher with
Berkeley's Jack Bartley. Neither of
the lads saw action on last week's
Pavilion card.
Fred Ten Eyck will be out for a
repeat performance against Bear
Irv Tucker in the 165-pound melee.
Ten Eyck won handily from the
taller Tucker the first time and
should duplicate the performance ■
across the Bay.
Willie Altue, who was TKOed in
the first round by rugged Hank Har
vey last Friday, will try again
against ihe same opponent tonight.
Harvey is a devastating puncher
for his weight, but Altus hopes to
out-1". ox the heavier-hitting Bear
this time out.
A 1 Anderson and Bobby Baker are
the other Indian punchers who will
be seeking revenge against the lads
who whipped them at the Pavilion.
Anderson will battle Ed Farris in
the 145-pound tussle, and Baker
faces Lefty John Parham in the 130- '
pound curtain-raiser
The lightweight division, which
produced the two best-fought
matches of the evening at the Pa
vilion, will rind Jay Savage seeking
No. 2 over Cal's Ed Griffin and Card
Max Money tangling with Rod
Doerr was beaten last week by Jose
Rael.
