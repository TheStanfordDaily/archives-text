Crozier and Kellberg are very
evenly matched. Both have shot
69's this year, Crozier in his match
with Jack Wallace, and Keliberg in
the qualifying round when he grab

bed medalist honors. Both men hit 1
a long ball, and are good putters,
but each has had trouble with his
approach lately.

with his matches thus far. He de- '
feated Harvey Doron 4 and 3. \Val- 1
lace 4 and 3, Dick We'.don 2 and 1.
and But Moe 1-up. His match with
Moe was the most exciting of the ;
tournament. Crozier put his 30-foot
approach shot within four feet of ,
the 18th pin to gain a half on the J
hole and sew up the match.
Kellberg had an easy time in all
four of his matches. He defeated j
Don Patch 5 and 4, Cully Ingram 3 \
and 2. Dave Mitten 4 and 3, and
Lynn Miller 5 and 4. Kellberg was
a finalist in the tournament last
year when he was defeated by Men
