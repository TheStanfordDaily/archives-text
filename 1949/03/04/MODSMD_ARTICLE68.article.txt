## The 						Front Row 
### 
Comes the time once again to toss
in the towel as today The Stanford
Daily rides out the count and, like
Joe Louis, goes into a quick retire.
But before we relax and just fade
into the vile, inactive dullness of
dead week, leave us take a few
last whacks at cleaning up pending
problems.
First of all, the rugby men who
will finish their season this after
noon in Stanford Stadium deserve a
good add. So add rugby men.
They take on Cal's Bears tomor
row at 2. and if it weren't for the
watery atmosphere and the 50-cent
fee, I would be there.
Next, another word about basket
ball. Brush those tears from your
eyes, and get ready to witness a
pair of good ball games this week
end.
The local hoopsters, who spent
the entire month of FEBRUARY
searching for their 18th victory, will
get off to a new MARCH tonight
against their rival Berkeley Bears.
Besides, the Deanmen have given
the Bears the air in three straight
games now, and have a chance to
rack up their second clean sweep
in history.
I hope, but doubt, that they will
do it.

But working on a win-a-few-lose
a-few basis, Stanford's casaba spe
cialists of 1949 have run up a pretty
fat record. The top of the ladder
was reached when they jumped on
USF's Hilltoppers to smash Lofgran
and friends by a good 10 points.
Since then, USF has moved into
eighth place in the national rating,
and the Cards hit the bottom oi
the ladder with a 13-pointl oss to
UCLA two weeks ago.
Still, it must be pointed out that
in spite of the seven straight losses,
Stanford possesses a good total rec
ord. The Indians have beaten top
teams and have taken their lickings
in sporting style.
They have not quit, and if the
game goes according to Hoyle to
night, the Cards will be back in the
win column.
But enough of the cage woe.
Spring is come, the lake is full,
baseball and track are rolling off
the starting blocks, and we will try
it again next quarter.
Because of a few misplaced bas
ketball wagers, the following had
to take place. Joe Pinotti, Don Tha
mer. Dick Dales. Don Fix, George
Dickinson. Jim Harri, Bill Dailey,
and Dick Schulze. So now, just
like at Chinese New Year, I'm all
square. See ya in the spring.

But working on a win-a-few-lose
a-few basis, Stanford's casaba spe
cialists of 1949 have run up a pretty
fat record. The top of the ladder
was reached when they jumped on
USF's Hilltoppers to smash Lofgran
and friends by a good 10 points.
Since then, USF has moved into
eighth place in the national rating,
and the Cards hit the bottom oi
the ladder with a 13-pointl oss to
UCLA two weeks ago.
Still, it must be pointed out that
in spite of the seven straight losses,
Stanford possesses a good total rec
ord. The Indians have beaten top
teams and have taken their lickings
in sporting style.
They have not quit, and if the
game goes according to Hoyle to
night, the Cards will be back in the
win column.
But enough of the cage woe.
Spring is come, the lake is full,
baseball and track are rolling off
the starting blocks, and we will try
it again next quarter.
Because of a few misplaced bas
ketball wagers, the following had
to take place. Joe Pinotti, Don Tha
mer. Dick Dales. Don Fix, George
Dickinson. Jim Harri, Bill Dailey,
and Dick Schulze. So now, just
like at Chinese New Year, I'm all
square. See ya in the spring.
Comes the time once again to toss
in the towel as today The Stanford
Daily rides out the count and, like
Joe Louis, goes into a quick retire.
But before we relax and just fade
into the vile, inactive dullness of
dead week, leave us take a few
last whacks at cleaning up pending
problems.
First of all, the rugby men who
will finish their season this after
noon in Stanford Stadium deserve a
good add. So add rugby men.
They take on Cal's Bears tomor
row at 2. and if it weren't for the
watery atmosphere and the 50-cent
fee, I would be there.
Next, another word about basket
ball. Brush those tears from your
eyes, and get ready to witness a
pair of good ball games this week
end.
The local hoopsters, who spent
the entire month of FEBRUARY
searching for their 18th victory, will
get off to a new MARCH tonight
against their rival Berkeley Bears.
Besides, the Deanmen have given
the Bears the air in three straight
games now, and have a chance to
rack up their second clean sweep
in history.
I hope, but doubt, that they will
do it.
