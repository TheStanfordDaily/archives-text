# Bears, Indians Vie For Rugby Title
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's undefeated ruggers, boasting an impressive record
of five wins and one tie, will make a bid for the league title
tomorrow afternoon when ihey take the field against a powerful
Cal rugby team in Stanford Stadium. Starting time is set for 2 p.m.
The Bears have copped the Northern California Rugby Union
tii If for the past two years, so an

Indian win wou'.d cut short a victory j
streak which began three years ago. '
An added incentive is provided by '
tlie Angell trophy, which is annu
ally awarded to the winner of the j
Card-Bear game.
Stanford's last victory over Cali- j
fornia on the rugby field was in '4o j
when they triumphed 11 to 3; the
Bears won in '47, 8 to 0 and last |
year by a 5-0 count. Last year's j
battle was a hard-fought affair i
which saw the blue and gold push j
across for a single tally in what was j
otherwise a very evenly-fought j
contest.
Two Perfect Records
This marks the second consecutive
week that the Indians have had a
chance to ruin a perfect record as '
the Bears, in their only two games
thus far this season have posted
shutout victories over the Univer- ,
sity Club (15-0) and UCLA (18-0).
1 he Cards have disposed of the same ;
two teams 11-0 and 2U-5, respec- j
lively, so comparative scores leave
little to choose between the two j
fifteens.
Jim "Truck" Cullom, Wilbur Lenz. '
and Hank Wright have been the big !
guns in Cal's two games. Cullom is
the place-kicking specialist who also '
likes to tuck the ball under his arm |
and, with head lowered, plow over
the opopsition.
Lenz is a speed merchant whose '
alert play accounted for two scores j
against UCLA. While Hank Wright i
(all 240 pounds of him) handles one 1
of the second rank positions, and is

j a hard man to push around in the
I scrum.
The Indians are in top physical
1 t-hape for the clash as Dick Hughes
I and Boyd Benson have recovered
I from ley injuries which hampered
j diem earlier in the season.
j Cal has a fast group of backs, but
i the Indian combination oi John
1 Banks, Hughes, Benson, Holy Bor
| uck, and A 1 Turriziani would be
I hard to stop in any league.
A wet field will hinder loth teams,
! but the Cards have been practicing
I all week in the rain, so are pre
| pared in the event the downpour
continues.
The public address system will be
in operation with Lou Sloss at the
mike to explain the game to those
j who are battled by the proceedings.
| Sloss is well-qualified since he was
| a mainstay on the Card varsity in
! '47 and '48 and has been helping
| Chuck Taylor with the coaching
! chores this season.
The JV game which was origin
| ally scheduled to precede the var-
I sity tilt, will immediately follow it
i instead. This will prevent the soggy
I turf from getting ripped up before
! the varsity clash.

Two Perfect Records
This marks the second consecutive
week that the Indians have had a
chance to ruin a perfect record as '
the Bears, in their only two games
thus far this season have posted
shutout victories over the Univer- ,
sity Club (15-0) and UCLA (18-0).
1 he Cards have disposed of the same ;
two teams 11-0 and 2U-5, respec- j
lively, so comparative scores leave
little to choose between the two j
fifteens.
Jim "Truck" Cullom, Wilbur Lenz. '
and Hank Wright have been the big !
guns in Cal's two games. Cullom is
the place-kicking specialist who also '
likes to tuck the ball under his arm |
and, with head lowered, plow over
the opopsition.
Lenz is a speed merchant whose '
alert play accounted for two scores j
against UCLA. While Hank Wright i
(all 240 pounds of him) handles one 1
of the second rank positions, and is

j a hard man to push around in the
I scrum.
The Indians are in top physical
1 t-hape for the clash as Dick Hughes
I and Boyd Benson have recovered
I from ley injuries which hampered
j diem earlier in the season.
j Cal has a fast group of backs, but
i the Indian combination oi John
1 Banks, Hughes, Benson, Holy Bor
| uck, and A 1 Turriziani would be
I hard to stop in any league.
A wet field will hinder loth teams,
! but the Cards have been practicing
I all week in the rain, so are pre
| pared in the event the downpour
continues.
The public address system will be
in operation with Lou Sloss at the
mike to explain the game to those
j who are battled by the proceedings.
| Sloss is well-qualified since he was
| a mainstay on the Card varsity in
! '47 and '48 and has been helping
| Chuck Taylor with the coaching
! chores this season.
The JV game which was origin
| ally scheduled to precede the var-
I sity tilt, will immediately follow it
i instead. This will prevent the soggy
I turf from getting ripped up before
! the varsity clash.

Stanford's undefeated ruggers, boasting an impressive record
of five wins and one tie, will make a bid for the league title
tomorrow afternoon when ihey take the field against a powerful
Cal rugby team in Stanford Stadium. Starting time is set for 2 p.m.
The Bears have copped the Northern California Rugby Union
tii If for the past two years, so an

Indian win wou'.d cut short a victory j
streak which began three years ago. '
An added incentive is provided by '
tlie Angell trophy, which is annu

Card-Bear game.
Stanford's last victory over Cali- j
fornia on the rugby field was in '4o j
when they triumphed 11 to 3; the
Bears won in '47, 8 to 0 and last |
year by a 5-0 count. Last year's j
battle was a hard-fought affair i
which saw the blue and gold push j

otherwise a very evenly-fought j
contest.
