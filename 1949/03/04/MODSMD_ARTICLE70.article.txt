# Weather Meets Card Nine
## 
### 
The varsity baseball schedule
calls lor a non-conference game to
be p'ayed tomorrow afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond between the
Cards and the USF Hilltoppers.
However, with the Sunken Dia
mond now almost completely out of
sight under two inches of water,
and with a forecast of more wet
weather to come, chances are slim
that the game will be played.
If those rain clouds and the in
field lake pull a quick disappearing
act, action will get under way at
2:30, but no one, including Coach
Harry Wolter, is counting on it.
Four contests out of six have al
ready been washed out as the ex
cessive winter quarter rainfall has
made almost a complete failure of
the Indians' pre-CIBA baseball cam
paign.
Stanford's baseballers will return
to action alter finals with a heavy
five-game vacation week schedule.
The CIBA season will open March
26 when the Indians and the Uelans
clash on the Westwood Diamond.
