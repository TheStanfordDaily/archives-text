# Card Hoopsters Gunning For Cal
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Win-hungry and starved by the February famine of no victo
ries, Stanford's basketball Redshirts will go after their second
clean sweep in history against California this weekend.
With the cellar door still open, Stanford's next-to-last Indians
will play host to California's last-place Bears tonight at 8 p.m. in

Stunlord Pavilion.
Paying in what has been called
the Batile of the Basement, neither
team has much more than its self
respect at stake.
But it will bt? the 101st Big Bas
ketball Game, and as always when
Indian meets Bear, sparks will fly
; and skyrockets will boom.
Preliminaries between Stanford
Braves and Cal Blues at 3 p.m. and
Stanlord and Cal frosh at G:l5 p.m.
will start off the evening's festivi
ties.
On Other Side Tomorrow
Tomorrow night all six teams will
move across the Bay to complete
the series and finish off the season.
Varsity tip at Berkeley is sched
uled iur 8:30.
Stanford's chances for double vic
tory are riding on Dave Davidson
and Bill Stephenson, the two red
shirts who put the Bears to sleep
in the previous Big Game meetings
this season.
Both Dave and Steve averaged 19
j points in the first two games against
! the Bears.
If Stanford wins both games this
weekend it will mark the second
; time in history that the Cards have
i won four games from Cal in one
i season. The other time was in 1942.
Yardley and Rose
Rounding out the Stanford attack
will be regulars George Yardley
and Bill Rose at the forwards and
Marv Gelter at guard.
