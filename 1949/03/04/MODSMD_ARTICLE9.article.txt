# Card Hoopsters Gunning For Cal
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Win-hungry and starved by the February famine of no victo
ries, Stanford's basketball Redshirts will go after their second
clean sweep in history against California this weekend.
With the cellar door still open, Stanford's next-to-last Indians
will play host to California's last-place Bears tonight at 8 p.m. in

Stunlord Pavilion.
Paying in what has been called
the Batile of the Basement, neither
team has much more than its self
respect at stake.
But it will bt? the 101st Big Bas
ketball Game, and as always when
Indian meets Bear, sparks will fly
; and skyrockets will boom.
Preliminaries between Stanford
Braves and Cal Blues at 3 p.m. and
Stanlord and Cal frosh at G:l5 p.m.
will start off the evening's festivi
ties.
On Other Side Tomorrow
Tomorrow night all six teams will
move across the Bay to complete
the series and finish off the season.
Varsity tip at Berkeley is sched
uled iur 8:30.
Stanford's chances for double vic
tory are riding on Dave Davidson
and Bill Stephenson, the two red
shirts who put the Bears to sleep
in the previous Big Game meetings
this season.
Both Dave and Steve averaged 19
j points in the first two games against
! the Bears.
If Stanford wins both games this
weekend it will mark the second
; time in history that the Cards have
i won four games from Cal in one
i season. The other time was in 1942.
Yardley and Rose
Rounding out the Stanford attack
will be regulars George Yardley
and Bill Rose at the forwards and
Marv Gelter at guard.

With O'Neil on the sidelines,
Stanford should have a decided ad
vantage. The Cards already boast
an edge in season records, owning
a 17-9 status as compared to the
barren 14-17 Bear standing.
Eight Stanford seniors will play
their hist games this weekend. Top
ping the list is Captain Bill Ste
phenson. first-string center for the
past three years.

Hagler and Bill Stephenson for top
scoring honors among the Southern
Division centers.
Hagler leads by a single digit,
109 to 10S, but Steve should over
take him this weekend. Bruin Car
iVrausnaar may steal it all. how
ever, as he will be the Bruins' main
offensive threat now that Alan
Sawyer must miss the USC series.
Kraushaar has 107 points.
Sawyer Loses Out
Sawyer's appendix operation two
days ago will keep him out of bas
ketball for the remainder of the
year, and will undoubtedly allow
Stanford's Dave Davidson to re
gain his second spot in division
scoring behind Bill Sharman.
Sawyer had 139, Davidson owns
133. and Bill Sharman tops them
all with 167 points with two games
remaining.
Stanford reserve strength, formed
mainly around the fast-break crew
of Gus Chavalas, Milt. Iverson, and
Gay Bryan, figures to see added ac

The dribbling and fast-break ar
tistry of the alert and ready Cha
valas played an important part in.

Ralph Carver, who turned in
some fine defensive work against
USC last week at the Olympic Au

offensive threat now that Alan
Sawyer must miss the USC series.
Kraushaar has 107 points.
Sawyer Loses Out
Sawyer's appendix operation two
days ago will keep him out of bas
ketball for the remainder of the
year, and will undoubtedly allow
Stanford's Dave Davidson to re
gain his second spot in division
scoring behind Bill Sharman.
Sawyer had 139, Davidson owns
133. and Bill Sharman tops them
all with 167 points with two games
remaining.
Stanford reserve strength, formed
mainly around the fast-break crew
of Gus Chavalas, Milt. Iverson, and
Gay Bryan, figures to see added ac
tion against California.
The dribbling and fast-break ar
tistry of the alert and ready Cha
valas played an important part in.
the two earlier wins over the Bears.
Ralph Carver, who turned in
some fine defensive work against
USC last week at the Olympic Au
ditorium, will spell Stephenson at
center.
The starting lineups:
STANFORD CALIFORNIA
Yardlcy 112 O'Neill
Hose I' Nichols
