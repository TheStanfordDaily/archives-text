# Doodles Weaver Legend Grows by Word Of Mouth and College Humor Magazine
## Arizona kitty Kat Features Article About Famous Stanford Character 
### JACK LITTLE 
"Every campus has its legends.
But among other things, probably
the greatest legend of them all was
Doodles Weaver, Stanford, '30."
Around here we take this pretty
much for granted . . . but this par
ticular recognition of the Doodles
Dynasty comes from the University
ol Arizona humor magazine, the
Arizona Kitty Kat.
It all started when the Spike
Jones show, featuring Doodles as
Professor Feedlebaum, blew into
Tucson. Mike Pistor, Kitty Kat
humor writer, decided to interview
the Feedlebaum of "the pitch pipe,
the William Tell Overture, and the
seal bark."
The results of the interview ap
pear in the February Kitty Kat. en
titled "Never Tangle with a Leg
end.' ' It seems that Doodles gave
Mr. Pistor a rather hectic few min
utes, by the interviewer's own ad
mission. He writes:
" Mr. Weaver,' I said in a voice
quaking with stage fright, 'is it true
that you had a picture of the Savior
in your bedroom inscribed "To
Doodles from Jesus"?'
"He frowned and said in an icy
voice, "Most certainly not. Would
you?'
" 'Well, I —uh, I . . .'
"I pulled myself together and
asked him what his major had been
at Stanford. Was it dramatics?
" 'No. I majored in educational
psychology.'
" 'Oh! Have you ever had a

chance to practice this since you got
out?'
"There was a long silence after
this," says Mr. Pistor. "I was a
shattered hulk."
Mr. Pistor's article, very natu
rally, tells of some of Doodles'
more famous pranks at Stanford:
Plow the distinguished alumnus
unveiled a statue of Leland Stanford
before a large gathering, only to
reveal Doodles comfortably seated
in Senator Stanford's marble lap (a
bottle of beer in one hand and a
cigar in the other, says Mr. Pistor);
how Doodles, attempting to set a
new automobile speed record to Los
Angeles, smashed up his car on
Palm Drive, retired to his fraternity
house, and didn't come out for
three days (the way we heard it,
the undaunted Doodles hired a cab
and drove to LA anyway); and
how, when Doodles' parents went
East for a visit, he had the house
painted black on the inside and
turned it into a night club — the
Club Foot (?).
And so goes the legend of Doo
dles Weaver, bounding from cam
pus to campus and writer to writer,
amusing many and confusing some,
like Mr. Pistor, who glumly com
ments:
"Doodles Weaver is a legend. He
is also a horse's neck."
We beg to differ.

Professor Feedlebaum, blew into
Tucson. Mike Pistor, Kitty Kat
humor writer, decided to interview
the Feedlebaum of "the pitch pipe,
the William Tell Overture, and the
seal bark."
The results of the interview ap
pear in the February Kitty Kat. en
titled "Never Tangle with a Leg
end.' ' It seems that Doodles gave
Mr. Pistor a rather hectic few min
utes, by the interviewer's own ad
mission. He writes:
" Mr. Weaver,' I said in a voice
quaking with stage fright, 'is it true
that you had a picture of the Savior
in your bedroom inscribed "To
Doodles from Jesus"?'
"He frowned and said in an icy
voice, "Most certainly not. Would
you?'
" 'Well, I —uh, I . . .'
"I pulled myself together and
asked him what his major had been
at Stanford. Was it dramatics?
" 'No. I majored in educational
psychology.'
" 'Oh! Have you ever had a

chance to practice this since you got
out?'
"There was a long silence after
this," says Mr. Pistor. "I was a
shattered hulk."
Mr. Pistor's article, very natu
rally, tells of some of Doodles'
more famous pranks at Stanford:
Plow the distinguished alumnus
unveiled a statue of Leland Stanford
before a large gathering, only to
reveal Doodles comfortably seated
in Senator Stanford's marble lap (a
bottle of beer in one hand and a
cigar in the other, says Mr. Pistor);
how Doodles, attempting to set a
new automobile speed record to Los
Angeles, smashed up his car on
Palm Drive, retired to his fraternity
house, and didn't come out for
three days (the way we heard it,
the undaunted Doodles hired a cab
and drove to LA anyway); and
how, when Doodles' parents went
East for a visit, he had the house
painted black on the inside and
turned it into a night club — the
Club Foot (?).
And so goes the legend of Doo
dles Weaver, bounding from cam
pus to campus and writer to writer,
amusing many and confusing some,
like Mr. Pistor, who glumly com
ments:
"Doodles Weaver is a legend. He
is also a horse's neck."
We beg to differ.

Pushing your bike, rather than
riding it across Inner Quad, is a
Stanford tradition.
"Every campus has its legends.
But among other things, probably
the greatest legend of them all was
Doodles Weaver, Stanford, '30."
Around here we take this pretty
much for granted . . . but this par
ticular recognition of the Doodles
Dynasty comes from the University

Arizona Kitty Kat.
