# Doodles Denies Many Exploits, But Admits That Maybe He Was Unusual
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Doodles Weaver was almost a
normal student while on the Farm.
Enrolled incognito under the name
of Winstead Sheffield Weaver, he
received his A.B. in 1937. sporting
a plus 83 for 183 units. He later did
graduate work in psychology under
Professor Hilgard of the psychology

department, compiling a book on
William James.
Doodles himself emphatically de
nies the Weaver legend, though he
admits he was somewhat of a cam
pus character. In his own words.

he says,"I did enjoy myself at
Stanford while simultaneously play
ing two parts—buffoon and student.
. . . Notice the use of the adverb
'simultaneously' — no schizophenia,
as there was no split involved—just
two extremes integrated by exten
sional discipline."
The student will rarely admit
that he actually believes any of the
tales of Doodles' exploits, but pos
sibly for lack of evidence to the
contrary or maybe because of some
Freudian satisfaction, he cherishes
the Weaver legend as a vital part of
Stanford tradition. As a result, new
escapades are daily being unearthed
and enlarged upon by someone who
knows someone who knows some
one who was there.
Anfong the more popular of the
tales is one describing how Doodles
avoided reg-day crowds. On this
particular day registration was be
ing held on the lawn before the Ad
Building. The customary lines were
present and evening was rapidly ap
proaching when the sharp notes of
a bugle pierced the air and simul
taneously Doodles, astride a white
dairy-horse, came charging across
the lawn up to the desk, registered,
and rode off again.
Another fable has it that Dood!es
once led a horse up the Encina
steps to a fellow student's room,
shot it, and left it there over the
Christmas holidays to welcome the
vacationing student upon his re
turn. Many pages would be re
quired to list all of our hero's pur
ported exploits, ad infinitum and ad
nauseam. In short, any zany event
which ever occurred at Stanford is
eventually credited to the rich
man's Tom Elke.


BELIEVE IT OR NOT, this char
acter, better known as Doodles
Weaver, graduated "plus" from
Stanford, and did graduate work
in psychology.
