## Bookstore Lines 
### 
Several years ago when the registration procedure took three
to six hours to complete, the battle lines around the Bookstore
counters were overlooked as just another phase of reg activities.
Since the end of the war, however, the registration program
has been improved so much that any student can enroll within
an hour's time. Meanwhile, students began complaining about
''that Bookstore rush." *
But instead of improving, the Bookstore situation became worse.
Twice this year The Daily had suggested ideas for better sales
organization methods at the textbook counters. Beginning today,
the Bookstore clerks will try the line-up method for better sales
efficiency.
Students will write the names of all their texts on one slip of
paper they receive as they enter the side door of the store. Use
of the order blanks will save the clerks' time because they will
have only one trip to make to the supply shelves for each cus
tomer.
After all the kinks have been ironed out of this new system
from spring and summer quarter registration week sales, the
clerks should be ready to handle the heavy autumn quarter reg
istration crowd with a minimum of confusion.
