### Priscilla Claudius 
The Young Homeniakcr's Cook Book,
by Esther S. Schifferman (Mur
ray & Gee)
Here is a useful cook book. It is
designed for the varying degrees of
ability of all ages. The novice, the
intermediate, or the culinary expert
can all find something new in this
book.
In these days of the omnipresent
can opener, such a complete and
helpful guide to meal planning and
cooking is very helpful. Directions
are easy to follow, and it covers
such rudimentary cooking operations
as making coffee or frying an egg.
Besides the recipes, the author has
thoughtfully included a section on
food values, table settings, and, best
or all, whole menus. There is a
concise discussion of vitamins, and
the most explicit directions on food
preparation.
But the final test is, of course, to
actually try the countless recipes.
They pass this test. 1 subjected six
people to the product of one of the
book's easier recipes, and it proved
to be delicious in spite of the hap
hazard liberties which I took with
the original formula. With these
recipes there is quite a safe margin
for error, a vital factor in the work
of an inexperienced cook.
And the whole tone of the volume
is one of sympathetic understanding.
Here is one experienced cook who
can realize that there arc others
who do not understand even the
simplest cooking requirements. The
dedication exemplifies the whole
spirit of the book.
"To brides everywhere:
If your cakes fall flat.
And the pancakes burn:
Don't get discouraged,
We all had to learn!
