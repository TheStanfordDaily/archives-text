### MARGIE BOTTS 
Student versus llog ....
One University of Michigan jun
i ior is not only eating like a hog, but
j is trying to outeat a hog.
In a contest scheduled between
the student and Broadview Perfect
Lad, a four-month-old hog, the for
mer will attempt to match pound for
| pound of food with (he hog until
j the animal calls it quits.
Both will weigh in as welter
! weights—at 165 pounds.
The contest climaxes a growing
j series of gastronomical feats on the
! campus. One student ate 48 oysters
: and a second topped him by eating
! 76. A coed managed to consume
12 h 2 hamburgers, but fell half a
| 'burger short of the intercollegiate
| record.
This should stop all talk about
i Stanford pigs.

! Speaking of eating ....
| Food seems to be a problem at
i Harvard, too, but not in such large
| quantities.
The Student Council is attacking
| the problem by distributing an
eight-question poll on college food.
The poll asks whether the food is
j nutritional, well coordinated, varied.
! too starchy, well cooked—and if an
| expert survey is needed.

Next time try the plane ....
Student commuters might take a
lesson from teachers at San Fran
cisco State College who make week
! ly trips by commercial airlines to
j reach their extension classes in
Shasta County.
Twelve California counties are
i now covered by the In-Service (ex
| tension) Division, and over 50
courses are offered on the program
I to meet the needs of people who
work during the day.
However, the flying professors
should be thankful that they don't
have 8 o'clocks.

No demerits, but points at MSC . . . .
A revolutionary cry has started
, for emancipation of coeds from the

| "points limitation program" at Mich
, igan State College.
■ The point program is a system of
j limiting the number of extra-cm
| ricular activities of coeds by assign
ing a particular number of points
:to each activity. Freshman women
m«y accumulate 25 points, sopho
mores 40, juniors 50. and seniors 60.
However, a columnist for the col
| lege newspaper claims that "this is
: just another aspect of the almost ab
solute regimentation suffered by the
j MSC coed."
Comes the revolution .... and
J unlimited activity at MSC.

Battle of the Sexes ....
There seem to be two different
schools of thought at the City Col
| lege of San Francisco.
An article in the Guardsman re
cently stated that men at this col
lege agreed that "the female animal
is a predatory, grasping specie."
Coeds retaliated by declaring that
"fellas are too sly, egotistical and
selfish, but paradoxically shy. which
| makes them sorta interesting."
Judging from the Guardsman's so
cial news, however, the "egotistical
; men" are still dating the "grasping
species."
