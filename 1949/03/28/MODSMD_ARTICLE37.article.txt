A San Jose State student on a
geology class Held trip found what
may be a 500,000-year-old shoulder
blade once part of a Western camel
(Camelops Hesternus).
Dr. Vertress L. Vander Hoof, Farm
paleontologist, identified the bone
and its estimated age.
He said that in this section of the
West camels were "as thick as ileas"
up to the ice age, when they grad
ually became extinct. They were
somewhat larger than the modern
camel, he said.
Geologists do not consider the
find to be in the rare class, but the
hones of the Camelops are not too
frequently found, Vander Hoof
stated. Searchers in this area are
constantly turning up remains of
lions, tigers, and many more ani
mals that date back to prehistoric
times, he said.
The bone was found near a beach
cliff at Rodeo in Contra Costa
County.
