# MERRIMAN BIDS FOR MAJORS
## 
### 
Lloyd Merri m a n, ex-Stanford
gridiron star, is making a loud bid
la snatch Johnny Wyrostek's center
field post with the Cincinnati Reds
away from the veteran. Merriman
has shown Redleg manager Bucky
Walters that his Sally League total
cf 44 bases stolen in his first year
in organized baseball was no acci
dent. In addition, the rookie out
fielder has displayed a fine throwing
arm, defensive ability bordering on
the spectacular, and extra-base
power to spare with two round
trippers to his credit.
