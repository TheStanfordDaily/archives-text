# Cards Romp Over Bears in Track Relay
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Coach Jack Weiershauser's 1949
cinderteam got off to a flying start
| last Saturday as they humbled the
; California varsity 40 to 20 in the
third Stanford-California Relays at
Stanford Stadium in perfect track
weather.
With "come through" perform
i ances in both the track and field
! events, the Indians pulled steadily
i away from their traditional foes.
Particularly important were upsets
! in the 440 and medley relays, the
. high jump and the pole vault.
Along with their convincing vic
! Tory, the Cards established three
individual and one aggregate meet
records. Stanford's ace javelin
thrower. Bud Held, heaved the

, stick 224 feet 4 inches to establish
, not only a new Cal-Stanford Relay
I record, but also a new all-time
i Stanford record, replacing John
Mottram's record of 221 feet 9
inches made in 1935.
Chandler Stars
Otis Chandler gave indications of
a great season to come when he
i bettered the relays old shotput mark
j by more than a foot, throwing it
i 54 feet 5 inches.
Stanford's aggregate shotput team
I also broke the relays record with
i 192 feet llVa inches, replacing the
1 old mark of 189 feet made by Stan
-1 ford in 1940. In addition to Chan
dler's 54 foot 4 inch mark, Norm
Nourse added a 50 foot 6V2 inch
toss. Steve McKee had 47 feet 7

inches and Sophomore Bob Scott
had 40 feet 5 inches.
Gay Bryan, the Indians' perennial
iron man, also had his share in the
record breaking when he leaped
6 feet 4 inches in the high jump.
Dave Dunlap, Ken Peck, and Char
lie Barnett each cleared 5 feet 10
inches in this event to win the ag
gregate high jump for the Cards.
Medley Upset
But the real upset victories were
recorded on the track itself. Cal's
highly-favored distance medley re
lay team, composed of Jim Wyatt,
Paul Mello, Kaare Vefling, and Fay
Blair, was nipped at the tape by A 1
Lyons, who ran the last leg for the
Stanford team.
Rod Reynolds finished - his lap in

the exciting medley race slightly b
| hind Cal's Wyatt and Card Geoi
Mooers ran a 1:57-flat half mile
even up the race. The Bears' t
distance man, Kaare Vefling, w
supposed to run away from Soph
more Drew Terramorse in the 1£
(three laps), but Drew stuck j ij.
behind the Cal ace until the ve
| end. This set up the Cards*
Lyons to make his dramatic finish
j the mile and win the event for Sta
j ford.
The Cards' mile relay team serv
I notice that it is the team to beat
| the Coast when it outran the (
team by 35 yards in the fast ti
of 3:17.4. Larry Hoff ran his .
in 48.3. and Pitch Johnson in 48
after sprint star Kupe Andrews 1
whizzed by the Bears' Don Jacks
in the second lap.
Cards Cop 440
Without the Bears' * sprint ;
Donnie Anderson (out of the met

posed of Ronnie Buck, Dell Rus
Dick Hart, and Rupe Andre
romped to victory in the good 1
of 42.4. Two bad baton passes
the 880 yard relay to the Bears
Hurdler Dell Russell, who
ran in both sprint relays, persoi
won the 480 yard shuttle hu
relays by coming from far bel
in the anchor lap to win the e
for the Indians. Stanford's J
Fank, Ken Peck, and Jim Pi
substituted capably for Dow
McKee, Skip Kent, and Da
Kreitz, of last year's record-bn
ing shuttle hurdle team.
Kreitz will definitely be out
the season, following a leg op
tion, while McKee and Kent
expected to. be ready to go
Saturday against COP. in the S
ford Stadium.
Although the marks were no
to their usual par. the Card di
team beat the Bears by more
seven feet. Veteran Steve Mi
heaved the platter 138 feet
inches to win the event. The
dians' Dalton Paxman was se
with 133 feet ll 1 ■> inches,
Chandler third, and Bob '
fourth both with over 132 feet
Bears Break Record
The Bears' four-man broad
team broke the aggregate relay
cord with a combined total c
feet 3".j inches, breaking the
mark of 90 feet 8 inches mad
the Stanford team in 1:M0.
Bryan led the Cards with a jun
23 feet 8 inches.
Although Cal's Bill Paddock
the individual pole vault honoi
13 feet (> inches, the Cards' a;
gate team took ihe event. Both
Campbell and Bud Held clean
feet, with Campbell barely mi
at 13 feet 6 inches. The pre-st
dope figured Stanford weak ir
event, but with just a little
provement Held and Campbel
place high in all the meets.
All in all, it was a very succ<
opener for the Indians. Sta

Coach Jack Weiershauser's 1949
cinderteam got off to a flying start
| last Saturday as they humbled the
; California varsity 40 to 20 in the
third Stanford-California Relays at
Stanford Stadium in perfect track
weather.
With "come through" perform
i ances in both the track and field
! events, the Indians pulled steadily
i away from their traditional foes.
Particularly important were upsets
! in the 440 and medley relays, the
. high jump and the pole vault.
Along with their convincing vic
! Tory, the Cards established three
individual and one aggregate meet
records. Stanford's ace javelin
thrower. Bud Held, heaved the

, stick 224 feet 4 inches to establish
, not only a new Cal-Stanford Relay
I record, but also a new all-time
i Stanford record, replacing John
Mottram's record of 221 feet 9
inches made in 1935.
Chandler Stars
Otis Chandler gave indications of
a great season to come when he
i bettered the relays old shotput mark
j by more than a foot, throwing it
i 54 feet 5 inches.
Stanford's aggregate shotput team
I also broke the relays record with
i 192 feet llVa inches, replacing the
1 old mark of 189 feet made by Stan
-1 ford in 1940. In addition to Chan
dler's 54 foot 4 inch mark, Norm
Nourse added a 50 foot 6V2 inch
toss. Steve McKee had 47 feet 7

inches and Sophomore Bob Scott
had 40 feet 5 inches.
Gay Bryan, the Indians' perennial
iron man, also had his share in the
record breaking when he leaped
6 feet 4 inches in the high jump.
Dave Dunlap, Ken Peck, and Char
lie Barnett each cleared 5 feet 10
inches in this event to win the ag
gregate high jump for the Cards.
Medley Upset
But the real upset victories were
recorded on the track itself. Cal's
highly-favored distance medley re
lay team, composed of Jim Wyatt,
Paul Mello, Kaare Vefling, and Fay
Blair, was nipped at the tape by A 1
Lyons, who ran the last leg for the
Stanford team.
Rod Reynolds finished - his lap in

the exciting medley race slightly b
| hind Cal's Wyatt and Card Geoi
Mooers ran a 1:57-flat half mile
even up the race. The Bears' t
distance man, Kaare Vefling, w
supposed to run away from Soph
more Drew Terramorse in the 1£
(three laps), but Drew stuck j ij.
behind the Cal ace until the ve
| end. This set up the Cards*
Lyons to make his dramatic finish
j the mile and win the event for Sta
j ford.
The Cards' mile relay team serv
I notice that it is the team to beat
| the Coast when it outran the (
team by 35 yards in the fast ti
of 3:17.4. Larry Hoff ran his .
in 48.3. and Pitch Johnson in 48
after sprint star Kupe Andrews 1

in the second lap.

the 880 yard relay to the Bears
Hurdler Dell Russell, who
ran in both sprint relays, persoi
won the 480 yard shuttle hu
relays by coming from far bel
in the anchor lap to win the e
for the Indians. Stanford's J
Fank, Ken Peck, and Jim Pi
substituted capably for Dow
McKee, Skip Kent, and Da
Kreitz, of last year's record-bn
ing shuttle hurdle team.
Kreitz will definitely be out
the season, following a leg op
tion, while McKee and Kent
expected to. be ready to go
Saturday against COP. in the S
ford Stadium.
Although the marks were no
to their usual par. the Card di

seven feet. Veteran Steve Mi

Although Cal's Bill Paddock

Campbell and Bud Held clean
feet, with Campbell barely mi
at 13 feet 6 inches. The pre-st
dope figured Stanford weak ir
event, but with just a little
provement Held and Campbel
place high in all the meets.
