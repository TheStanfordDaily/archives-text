# Two Boys Killed In Yosemite Fall
## 
### 
An afternoon's hike to Lower Yo
seinite Falls last Wednesday by Vil
lage students Gerson B. Kaplan and
Herbert B. Osborn led to the dis
covery of two youths who had been
killed while trying to scale a tiOO
loot cliff.
The dead were identified as Peter
j B. Yeazell, 18, and Kenneth Alden
i Haines, 19, both of Fresno.
San Francisco papers previously
reported that Yeazell and Haines
i were Stanford students, but Regis-
I trar H. Donald Winbigler said that
they were not registered in the past
, and had not been accepted for fu
i ture admittance.
Chief Ranger Oscar A. Sedergren
j said the boys apparently had fallen
i to their deaths from a height of
about 400 feet while attempting to
scale the ledge. He surmised one of
the pair fell first and pulled the
other after him by the rope that
I lied them together.
Climbing conditions have been
extremely dangerous in the area
where Yeazell and Haines attempted
their ascent, Sedergren said. The
{ cliff is formed in a series of rocky
| edges, but the rocks are now wet
j and slippery.
