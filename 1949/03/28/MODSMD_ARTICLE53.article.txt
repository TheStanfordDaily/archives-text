# Farm Fireless Over Vacation
## 
### 
The Stanford fire department re
mained inactive during the past
three weeks, following a $150 blaze
in the Inner Quad March 7.
A short circuit in the basement
of room 100 of the Law School was
blamed for the small blaze which
damaged wiring and the floor of the
lecture room. Smoke, drifting in
the steam tunnel under the room,
made the lire appear larger than it
was. Power to a corner of the
Physics Building was disrupted
temporarily.
During the fireless vacation, the
Farm alarm system received a com
plete overhauling and two boxes
were added to the system, one at
Escondido and Galvez for Crothers
Hall, and the other at Alvaraco and
Galvez to serve Stern Hall. New
fireboxes throughout the campus
and automatic alarm equipment in
the firehouse replace the 20-year
old system. A new code of three
digit numbers will be used for fire
calls. The new alarm system is flex
ible enough to take additional alarm
boxes as the University expands.
