# Fraternities Hit By Milk Ruling
## Majority of Houses Must Purchase Extra Iceboxes to Hold Milk Bottle 
### JIM THURBER 
Appoximately 18 out of the Farm's 24 fraternities will have tc
install extra iceboxes to accommodate the new, small milk bot
tles, a Daily survey revealed yesterday.
The change to the individual service cartons was made neces
sary after a bill, exempting fraternities from a state law, was

tabled by the assembly committee
on livestock and dairies. The state
law forbids boarding houses serving
milk out of large containers.
In the past, fraternities have usee
the large containers. They assumed
that they were not boarding houses
as they were non-profit and did not
cater to public trade.
Many of the fraternities ques
tioned stated that they did not have
the money to install the new re
frigerators, and would have to cut
down the milk s-upply to that which
would fit their present equipment
"Besides playing havoc with the
storage situation, the new ruling
will raise the board bills of mer
living in Row houses," Ted LeVino
chairman of Interfraternity Council,
said yesterday.
LeVino figured that milk server
in small containers would cost 4<
per cent more than milk bought u
two- or five-gallon cans.
Two of the fraternities questioner
stated that their bookkeeping woulc.
also be increased as records woulc
have to be kept of the members
drinking more than their share of
milk. Only in this way could thej
make up an accurate and fair board
bill.
