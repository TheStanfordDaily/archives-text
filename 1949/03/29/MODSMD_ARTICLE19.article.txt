# Small Timepiece Controls Entire Stanford Routine
## 
### JAN HANSON 
A very unprepossessing little
timepiece no larger than an ordi
nary alarm clock sets the entire
routine of the Stanford day. This
mighty midget resides high in the
clock tower, completely dwarfed by
all the machinery it controls. The
chimes, the class bells, and the big
clock on the outside of the tower
are all regulated by this one small
clock, which is almost as accurate
as any electric clock made.
The clock tower, which houses the
clock and the chimes, is a very or
dinary-looking edifice located be
hind the Memorial Church. It was
originally built after the earthquake
in 1906 which destroyed the church.
The rebuilding of the church spire,
which originally housed the time
piece, belonged to the indefinite fu
ture, so the clock tower was erected
solely to house the bells and make
it possible for them to ring again.
For a while, there was talk of in
stalling them in the library after it
was built. Perhaps the idea oc
curred to the administration that
the bells would then be sounding
every 15 minutes, directly over the
heads of several score of studying
students. At any rate, the spire was
never restored and the chimes still
reside in the clock tower.
Cables and Weights
The chimes are electrically con
trolled by a complicated system of
cables and weights which drop
when the mechanism trips and
causes the hammers to strike the
bel's.
The man who keeps the wheels
going 'round is Mr. Stanley Shep
ard. For 14 years he has been oiling
the works, rewinding the cable, and
occasionally leading an intrepid
Daily reporter up the tall rickety
ladder to the bell tower.
On the top of the tower, there are
four big brass bells hanging out in
the open. Mr. Shepard displayed
them like a proud father, ducking
under them to point out the in
scription on the oilier side:
"Chimes of the Memorial Church
Erected to the memory of I.eland
Stanford
By his wife, Jane Lathrop Stan
ford
A.D. 15)00."
The chimes were modeled after
the famous Westminster chimes in
the Victorian tower in the Houses
ol Parliament in London. The mu
sic of the chimes was composed for
them by Handel. Mr. Shepard ex

plained that it is the same boll that
sounds the hour which plays for the
quarter - hour, although it sounds
entirely different. The force of thi
hammer is controlled by the elec
trical current, which makes it strike
harder on the hour.
Back down on the landing where
the clock is kept, Mi - . Shepard dis
played a mechanism he invented
himself which turns off the bells at
a certain time in the evening and
keeps them from ringing on Sun
days. He also invented an appara
tus for electrically winding the
cable.
The Musically Minded
One of Mr. Shepard's more inter
esting duties has been to chase oil
occasional student marauders who
try to break in and play tunes on
the chimes. Toward the end of an
all - night jag, this idea seems to
ho'd particular fascination, and sev
eral of the musically inclined have
been apprehended as they were
blearily attempting to toll out "How
Dry I Am."
Nevertheless, the chipped and
battered door attests to the popu
larity of this form of diversion. One
boy was so fascinated by the idea
that he broke in three or four times.
This ingenious lad managed to un
screw the four wheels that control
the chimes and mix them up, pre
senting a rather knotty problem
because nobody could remember
which bar of the music came first.
Mr. Shepard asked the organist,
but he couldn't figure it out either.
Then he went home and tried to
pick it out on his piano.
After a good deal of research, the
chimes were finally straightened
out. Now Mr. Shepard has but one
weary plea to make. If you must
play the chimes, try the Hoover
tower.

A very unprepossessing little
timepiece no larger than an ordi
nary alarm clock sets the entire
routine of the Stanford day. This
mighty midget resides high in the
clock tower, completely dwarfed by
all the machinery it controls. The
chimes, the class bells, and the big
clock on the outside of the tower
are all regulated by this one small
clock, which is almost as accurate
as any electric clock made.
The clock tower, which houses the
clock and the chimes, is a very or
dinary-looking edifice located be
hind the Memorial Church. It was
originally built after the earthquake
in 1906 which destroyed the church.
The rebuilding of the church spire,
which originally housed the time
piece, belonged to the indefinite fu
ture, so the clock tower was erected
solely to house the bells and make
it possible for them to ring again.
For a while, there was talk of in
stalling them in the library after it
was built. Perhaps the idea oc
curred to the administration that
the bells would then be sounding
every 15 minutes, directly over the
heads of several score of studying
students. At any rate, the spire was
never restored and the chimes still
reside in the clock tower.
Cables and Weights
The chimes are electrically con
trolled by a complicated system of
cables and weights which drop
when the mechanism trips and
causes the hammers to strike the
bel's.
The man who keeps the wheels
going 'round is Mr. Stanley Shep
ard. For 14 years he has been oiling
the works, rewinding the cable, and
occasionally leading an intrepid
Daily reporter up the tall rickety
ladder to the bell tower.
On the top of the tower, there are
four big brass bells hanging out in
the open. Mr. Shepard displayed
them like a proud father, ducking
under them to point out the in
scription on the oilier side:
"Chimes of the Memorial Church
Erected to the memory of I.eland
Stanford
By his wife, Jane Lathrop Stan
ford
A.D. 15)00."
The chimes were modeled after
the famous Westminster chimes in
the Victorian tower in the Houses
ol Parliament in London. The mu
sic of the chimes was composed for
them by Handel. Mr. Shepard ex

plained that it is the same boll that
sounds the hour which plays for the
quarter - hour, although it sounds
entirely different. The force of thi
hammer is controlled by the elec
trical current, which makes it strike
harder on the hour.
Back down on the landing where
the clock is kept, Mi - . Shepard dis
played a mechanism he invented
himself which turns off the bells at
a certain time in the evening and
keeps them from ringing on Sun
days. He also invented an appara
tus for electrically winding the
cable.
The Musically Minded
One of Mr. Shepard's more inter
esting duties has been to chase oil
occasional student marauders who
try to break in and play tunes on
the chimes. Toward the end of an
all - night jag, this idea seems to
ho'd particular fascination, and sev
eral of the musically inclined have
been apprehended as they were
blearily attempting to toll out "How
Dry I Am."
Nevertheless, the chipped and
battered door attests to the popu
larity of this form of diversion. One
boy was so fascinated by the idea
that he broke in three or four times.
This ingenious lad managed to un
screw the four wheels that control
the chimes and mix them up, pre
senting a rather knotty problem
because nobody could remember
which bar of the music came first.
Mr. Shepard asked the organist,
but he couldn't figure it out either.
Then he went home and tried to
pick it out on his piano.
After a good deal of research, the
chimes were finally straightened
out. Now Mr. Shepard has but one
weary plea to make. If you must
play the chimes, try the Hoover
tower.
