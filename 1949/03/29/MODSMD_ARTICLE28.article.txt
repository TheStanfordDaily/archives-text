In less than two months the 1949 Quads will be ready for
distribution to the 3,500 student purchasers. Meanwhile, the
remaining unsold subscriptions will be placed on sale during
the first two weeks of this guarter. Once the 3,500 copies are
sold, no more Quads will be available.
We value a class yearbook as much as we do a daily news
paper, for both offer permanent histories of student, class, and
school activities. Outside of our permanent academic records,
the Quad is the only single volume printed that describes the
complete story of the year's activitiy.
Thirty Quad staff members will have worked five months
taking and mounting over 6,000 photographs, drawing scores of
layout patterns, and burning midnight oil to make page dead
lines by the time we pick up our copies June 1.
Indicative of the amount of wbrk needed to put together a
school yearbook is this comparison. Until 20 years ago members
of the Junior Class used to organize the Quad. But the general
trend in yearbook design throughout the country in the last 15
♦rears has called for more pictures and less copy. As a result, a
single and independent organization of students prepares photos
of living groups, sports, candids, student activities, the adminis
tration, and graduating seniors for the annual yearbook.
Seven dollars is a reasonable sum to spend for the 416-page
yearbook—lo years from now the 1949 Quad will be a prized
possession.

Oh, so you finally decided to put down that Time Schedule and read
The Daily, eh? Go ahead, say it:
"You'd rather read the Time Schedule because the stories are funnier,
wouldn't you?"
Well, that's all right, but just remember that I don't have to do this
kind of work. I've got the binocular concession at the top of the Hoover
Libe.
Seriously, it's good to be back pounding the old Remington after a
quarter of "academic work." My grades weren't really so low, but I
■was a little worried when I was listed in the autumn Bawlout under a
Miction headed "Out .... Bawling."
Therefore, I'm in a position to offer the solution to the academic prob
lems of the typical Stanford student. Alter all, let's face it: This is spring
quarter and Lake Lag is full.
Our first step in easing the academic strain is to abandon the regular
Time Schedule and plan our courses from the new simplified Bull Session
Time Schedule, given below. One quarter of study using the Bull Session
Time Schedule, and we guarantee you will be graduated Magna Cum
Lousy.
