# East-West Agreement Impossible
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
There is no agreement possible
between the Western democracies
and the Soviet Union—no more than
there is between the truth and a
lie.

In the course of the next months
one alternative is open: either the
Soviets will succeed in conquering
and absorbing Asia and Western
Europe, or they will be rcpe'led,
disarmed, and overthrown. In any
case, the ever-increasing tension we
live through cannot last much long
er—boiling up stops when the lid
blows oft.
It is the duty of all freedom-lov
ing people to know what is at stake
—democracy vs. dictatorhip, exact
ly the same problem as 10 years ago.

To believe that
the choice is war
vs. peace is but
an easy and fal
lacious escape
from the real is
sue.
"Peace in our
time." said Mr.
Neville Cham
berlain when he
returned from
Munich in Sep-

tember, 1938. One year later, the
| eyes of the one-time pacifist pre
mier had opened up. He summed up
the impossibility of negotiation with
! a faithless regime in a few words,
"Mr. Hitler is not a gentleman."
And today, unless we consider Mr.
Stalin is a gentleman, there is no
peace in our time either.
Can we speak of peace when mil
lions of men. women, and children
are herded together for deportation
and bondage under the control of
the NKVD. the Soviet Gestapo?
Peace when thousands of Czechs,
Poles, Hungarians, even Russians,
prefer to leave their homes and
those they love rather than to live
in the Soviet "paradise"?
Is it peace when world-respected
leaders such as Eduard Benes and
Jan Masaryk myteriously die to the
best advantage of the totalitarian
forces, or when others must face ig
nominious trials?
And finally, can we speak of
peace when every nation of West
ern Europe, from Norway to Italy,
fears a direct onslaught or a Soviet
engineered coup?
There is no peace today, in
March, 1949, except the peace of
our selfishness and of our illusions.
For the war against aggresion
and enslavement is not over. It is
still on. unless we suddenly disavow
al! that we have been fighting for.
Between 1939 and 1945, millions of
people strove and millions of them
died in the great battle against op
pression. It was not a battle like
those related in schoolbooks. This
time, the people who fought and met
death had not been drafted for the
uprising.
They all were volunteers in the
great, anonymous enterprise to re
gain their freedom. And they chose
their own battlefields — "Maquis,"
Commandos, sabotage groups, intel
ligence network.
Those who survived until their
liberation could then believe they
had won the war, their war against
evil.
But in Eastern Europe they met
with a regime as ruthless as the one
they had endured for six long years,
while in Western Europe the re
gained freedom was kept only al
the price of everyday fear, struggle,
and watchfulness — a way indeed
very far from the gay unconcern
the brave fighters had dreamed of
throughout the war.
Today, democracy has to cope
with so malignant a threat that in
comparison Hitler's attempt appears
like a Boy Scout's undertaking.
Skillfully, Communist imperialists
are using every possible propaganda
weapon. Playing up the theme of
tht U.S. atomic bomb, they seek to
sow defeatism and panic. Loudly
claiming their democratic right to
freedom of expression, they use it
to attack the very fundamentals of
democracy, to the extent of betray
ing their own countries.

And finally, can we speak of
peace when every nation of West
ern Europe, from Norway to Italy,
fears a direct onslaught or a Soviet
engineered coup?
There is no peace today, in
March, 1949, except the peace of
our selfishness and of our illusions.
For the war against aggresion
and enslavement is not over. It is
still on. unless we suddenly disavow
al! that we have been fighting for.
Between 1939 and 1945, millions of
people strove and millions of them
died in the great battle against op
pression. It was not a battle like
those related in schoolbooks. This
time, the people who fought and met
death had not been drafted for the
uprising.
They all were volunteers in the
great, anonymous enterprise to re
gain their freedom. And they chose
their own battlefields — "Maquis,"
Commandos, sabotage groups, intel
ligence network.
Those who survived until their
liberation could then believe they
had won the war, their war against
evil.
But in Eastern Europe they met
with a regime as ruthless as the one
they had endured for six long years,
while in Western Europe the re
gained freedom was kept only al
the price of everyday fear, struggle,
and watchfulness — a way indeed
very far from the gay unconcern
the brave fighters had dreamed of
throughout the war.
Today, democracy has to cope
with so malignant a threat that in
comparison Hitler's attempt appears
like a Boy Scout's undertaking.
Skillfully, Communist imperialists
are using every possible propaganda
weapon. Playing up the theme of
tht U.S. atomic bomb, they seek to
sow defeatism and panic. Loudly
claiming their democratic right to
freedom of expression, they use it
to attack the very fundamentals of
democracy, to the extent of betray
ing their own countries.

There is no agreement possible
between the Western democracies
and the Soviet Union—no more than
there is between the truth and a
lie.

In the course of the next months
one alternative is open: either the
Soviets will succeed in conquering
and absorbing Asia and Western
Europe, or they will be rcpe'led,
disarmed, and overthrown. In any
case, the ever-increasing tension we
live through cannot last much long
er—boiling up stops when the lid
blows oft.
It is the duty of all freedom-lov
ing people to know what is at stake
—democracy vs. dictatorhip, exact
ly the same problem as 10 years ago.

To believe that
the choice is war
vs. peace is but
an easy and fal
lacious escape
from the real is
sue.
"Peace in our
time." said Mr.
Neville Cham
berlain when he
returned from
Munich in Sep-

tember, 1938. One year later, the
| eyes of the one-time pacifist pre
mier had opened up. He summed up
the impossibility of negotiation with
! a faithless regime in a few words,
"Mr. Hitler is not a gentleman."
And today, unless we consider Mr.
Stalin is a gentleman, there is no
peace in our time either.
Can we speak of peace when mil
lions of men. women, and children
are herded together for deportation
and bondage under the control of
the NKVD. the Soviet Gestapo?
Peace when thousands of Czechs,
Poles, Hungarians, even Russians,
prefer to leave their homes and
those they love rather than to live
in the Soviet "paradise"?
Is it peace when world-respected
leaders such as Eduard Benes and
Jan Masaryk myteriously die to the
best advantage of the totalitarian
forces, or when others must face ig
nominious trials?
