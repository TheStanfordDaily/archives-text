## One-Acts Scripts ”Fixed” 
### 
To the Editor:
At the risk of seeming inclined to a belated display of stale bile. I sub
mit a few remarks relative to Ram's Head contributions to last quarter's
Thespian endeavors on campus.
If it's any reassurance to the local theatre enthusiasts who still cling
to the belief that contemporary theatre must find rejuvenation in the
fiesh. more disinterested approach of the amateur and semi-professional
projects of college and Little Theatre groups, the three original one-acts
selected for presentation last quarter did not necessarily represent the
cream of the dramatic works submitted; for all evidence seems to prompt
me to assert that the "campus-wide competition" bannered by The Daily
was "fixed" from the start.
As I understand it. Ham's Head was originally organized for the benefit
oi those students interested in amateur theatricals who were not affiliated
with the Drama Department; in theory, then, the annual contest with
promise of production for three local writers is a magnificent opportunity
which should encourage the very best in original dramatic writing talent.
And so, being an idealist, I proceed to hole myself up and devote my
entire Yuletide vacation to the writing of a verse tragedy which was so
good I half-suspected myself of plagiarism. For purposes of comparison.
I admit its worth, and the worth of the two other plays I submitted, quite
candidly; and I found it something of a personal affront that, in prefer
ence. Ram's Head chose—surprise! surprise!—three plays by Ram's Head
members—all intimately associated with the Drama Department and all.
as the saying is, "in."
I prefer to think that my plays were not even read, for I'd like to give
Pern's Head credit for enough discernment to preclude—upon equal,
unprejudiced consideration—the favoring of what seem, in reptrospeetion.
pale, conventional little plays distinguished from one another only by
dramatic type-classification and a varying degree of vapidity.
Whether it was a case of playing the favorites or simply that my plays
were over the Ram's Head, it makes one dubious about the part of the
college stage in the hoped-for decentralization of legitimate theatre from
New York monopoly. Before we tail? of decentralization, let's be certain
that our college groups will have more to offer hi competition to Broad
way than productions rendered abortive by a provincial esprit de corps
or meaningless and questionable by such burlesque-house humor as char
acterized the recent "Build No Fence Around Me."
It will be interesting to note the outcome of the competition which will
determine this quarter's Ram's Head contribution, the Spring Show. I
hope that even here, as well as in next year's one-act contest, recognition
and subsequent production will be granted not to pleasant people but to
praiseworthy playwrights.
I suppose in securing the whole of a liberal education, the student should
h; ve the opportunity of coming up against bias and partiality, typical of
much in "open-to-all" campus functions, for heaven knows it's prevalent
enough out in the cold, cruel world. But when such a buddy-buddy coterie
becomes a threat of negation of the art potential in some phase of collegiate
endeavor, it would seem time to take note.
II is, as I have suggested, the privilege—nay, the responsibility—of
college theatre to offer production to th? original, the experimental drama
of the tyro and the young genius—and what group is better equipped
fo" it than the students' own, e.g.. Ram's Head? And what group has
too-often proved itself inadequate for such a function in the past?
Um-hmm.

To the Editor:
At the risk of seeming inclined to a belated display of stale bile. I sub
mit a few remarks relative to Ram's Head contributions to last quarter's
Thespian endeavors on campus.
If it's any reassurance to the local theatre enthusiasts who still cling
to the belief that contemporary theatre must find rejuvenation in the
fiesh. more disinterested approach of the amateur and semi-professional
projects of college and Little Theatre groups, the three original one-acts
selected for presentation last quarter did not necessarily represent the
cream of the dramatic works submitted; for all evidence seems to prompt
me to assert that the "campus-wide competition" bannered by The Daily
was "fixed" from the start.
As I understand it. Ham's Head was originally organized for the benefit
oi those students interested in amateur theatricals who were not affiliated
with the Drama Department; in theory, then, the annual contest with
promise of production for three local writers is a magnificent opportunity
which should encourage the very best in original dramatic writing talent.
And so, being an idealist, I proceed to hole myself up and devote my
entire Yuletide vacation to the writing of a verse tragedy which was so
good I half-suspected myself of plagiarism. For purposes of comparison.
