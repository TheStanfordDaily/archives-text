In order to obtain its wide variety
materials, Hoover Library main
ins a far-flung organization that
>vers most of the world.
A member of the staff, usually do

entral Europe, the United King
mi, the Scandinavian countries,
atin America, the Middle East, the
ur East, India, and the United

The curators are in contact with
picsentatives in the foreign coun
