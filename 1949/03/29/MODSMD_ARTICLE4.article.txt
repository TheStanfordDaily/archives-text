The five students were also placed

According to Deputy Sheriff Jack
O'Brien of San Mateo County, on
the night of Feb. 19 the students
took red flags and lanterns marking
dangerous highway repair work and
about ten ornamental signs from
estates in the Woodside - Atherton
area. They also prowled around
several cars and damaged property
on the estates.
Deputy sheriffs impounded King's

flags, and lanterns. When King re

morning, he was questioned and a
confession obtained. He admitted
having several beers and some liq

Men's Council Chairman Bob
Anderson stated that the Council
would take no action on the case,
although King violated the Funla
mental Standard, because Council
felt that further punishment was
unwarranted.
