## PRODUCING METALLIC TITANIUM FOR INDUSTRIAL EVALUATION

Du Pont group research
developed a pilot plant with
daily capacity of TOO pounds
Du Pont research has just made
available to industry what may be
come one of America's key structural
materials, titanium metal. Midway
in density between aluminum and
iron and with an especially high
melting point, silvery-white titanium
offers an extraordinary combination
of strength, lightness, corrosion re
sistance and hardness.
Titanium is the ninth most com
mon element. But it has been slow
in coming into its own as a metal be
cause of the difficulty of separating
it in pure form from its ores.

Du Pont scientists first began to
probe the possibilities of metallic ti
tanium in the course of their long
experience with the titanium oxide
pigments. Their research was inter
rupted by World War 1 112. Meanwhile,
the U.S. Bureau of Mines la bora to
i ics succeeded in producing the metal
for research purposes.

After the war, Du Pont scientists
developed a process for the produc
tion of ductile titanium metal that
can be scaled up to meet commercial
demands. The research team that
mastered the complex problem con
sisted of chemical engineers special
izing in design and production, as
well as chemists and a metallurgist.
In September 1948, a pilot plant was
opened with a daily capacity of 100
pounds. Titanium metal is now being
produced in sponge and ingot form.
Samples are available to industrial
and college laboratories with research
projects in related fields. Studies of
methods for forming, machining and
alloying are under way.
Exhaustive studies will be neces
sary before the many possibilities of
titanium metal can be known. Re
cause of its high ratio of strength to
weight, early uses may be in airplane
power plants and structural parts.
Its hardness and rust-resistance rec
ommend it for railroad transporta
tion equipment, marine power plants
and propellers, and food packaging
equipment. Its high melting point
suggests use in pistons, and its re
sistance to electric currents points to
electronics. Titanium wire may be
used for springs and titanium sheet
for such highly stressed parts as
microphone diaphragms.

Your Opportunity in Research

Tho commercial development of ti
tanium metal is a typical example of
Du Pout research in action. How
ever, the Pigments Department,
which worked out the process, is
but one of the ten Du Pont manu
facturing departments. Each con
ducts continuous research. Each is
operated much like a separate com
pany. Within these "companies"—
whose interests range from heavy

chcmicals to plastics and textile fi
bers—college trained men and wom
en work in congenial groups where
they have every opportunity to dis
play individual talent and capa
bilities. Who knows what their con
tributions will mean in the future
to science and the world!
