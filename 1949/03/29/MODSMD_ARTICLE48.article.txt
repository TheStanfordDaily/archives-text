it the baseball team, Harry Wolter's diamond specialist", my boys,
already dropped their first two league games. To UCLA. That's
vorst part. Those Bruins, never too apt at the horsehide dodge. were

Bruins Surprise Again
what happens? UCLA walks of! with 7-6 and 10-5 victories, and
lord leaves Los Angeles empty-handed once again. It seems that the
Angeles jinx, so prevalent for the basketball squad, has carried over
ague the baseballers.
anybody is interested, there were a few reasons for the double loss
h might be passed along to make things easier for the horsehide
asiasts who didn't see the games.
st of all, Stanford pitching wasn't up to par. Dave Dahle had one
s worst days on the mound. Jack Heinen, who was mildly sensa
-1 against Santa Barbara, couldn't keep out of trouble against UCLA
was shaky throughout. The other Card hurlers to see action, Dave
and Jim Claypool, didn't show too much either.
d Frank Laßrum was good for only one pitch, that being a nifty to
a Skip Rowland who slashed to center to drive in the winning run
e first game.
Men Left Stranded
:ondly, the Cards left too many men on base. When Stanford muffed
with the bases loaded and none out, and another time with the
; loaded and one out, it passed by the victory side of the ledger,
en. too, it should be pointed out that Stanford didn't get much chance
on out early season kinks against capable competition. Whereas
A had been warming up against Coast League and Major League
, the Cards went into their first league games with only four con
behind them. And those were against second-rate teams.
t, all in all. the baseballers put in a pair of timid afternoons, and
will have to improve but quick if they are to take California next
day.
wever, there were some bright spots to the Los Angeles trip. Stan
stickwork was better than average, and the hustle displayed by the
