Dr. Sidney Raftel, professor of
bacteriology here, will be able to
continue his work in the field of
tuberculosis research for the next
year, thanks to proceeds taken in
from the 1948 Christmas Seal sale.
Dr. RafTel was awarded one of 22
grants annually given to American
scientists for TB research.
