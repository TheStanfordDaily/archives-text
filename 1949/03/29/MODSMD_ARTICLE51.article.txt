## BASEBALL Indians Confront Tigers Tonight 
### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's varsity baseball nine,
still licking its wounds from a
double pasting at the hands of UCLA
last weekend, will go after non
conference game toniaht when it
tackles the COP Tigers under the
Stockton Oak Park arcs. Game time
is set for 8 o'clock.
Stanford's starting pitcher is
strictly a matter of conjecture at
this writing. Coach Harry Wolter,
meditating over the fact that nei
!her of his starters lasted more than
five innings against UCLA, has not
yet named his starter, and will
rrobably not do so until shortly be
fore game time.
Tiie two Daves, Dahle and Sott,
curve-balling Frank Laßrum, and
rangy Jim CI ay pool are all ready to
go. but right-hander Ed Shive may
get the nod to open against his
home-town rivals.
iVlcWilliams Tops
Led bv their star right-hander
Stan McWilliams. who rates as one
of the best collegiate hurlers in the
game, the Tigers have come up with
one of their best nines in recent
years.
McWilliams will undoubtedly get
the starting call tonight as the Pa
cificers seek a clean sweep over
CIBA competition. The Tigers
opened their season with a 7 to 3
victory over the St. Mary's Gaels,
and decisioned Santa Clara's cocky
Broncos under the lights at Stock
ton last Friday night.
Big Stan won seven while losing
only two last season, and his blaz
ing fastball is particularly effective
under the arcs.
C'legg to Start
To oppose McWilliams' right
handed slants, Coach Wolter will
probably start Frank McGraw be
hind the plate, Dick Clegg on first,
Ray Wyiterhalter at second. Dave
Melton at short, Captain Bill Arce
on the hot corner, and Bud Klein,
Charlie Cole, and Bob Nava in the
outer gardens.
The biggest shift to date finds
made-over catcher Dick Clegg on
the initial sack. Clegg is still a bit
awkward around his new position,
but adds plenty of power to the
batting order.
The Card keystone combination
of peppery Ray Winterhalter and
slugging Dave Melton was out
standing on the tiip south. Melton
was superb in the field and drove
in nine runs in four games with his
big bat. while Winterhalter turned
in a fine series around second and
drove across three runs.

Led bv their star right-hander
Stan McWilliams. who rates as one
of the best collegiate hurlers in the
game, the Tigers have come up with
one of their best nines in recent
years.
McWilliams will undoubtedly get
the starting call tonight as the Pa
cificers seek a clean sweep over
CIBA competition. The Tigers
opened their season with a 7 to 3
victory over the St. Mary's Gaels,
and decisioned Santa Clara's cocky
Broncos under the lights at Stock
ton last Friday night.
Big Stan won seven while losing
only two last season, and his blaz
ing fastball is particularly effective
under the arcs.
C'legg to Start
To oppose McWilliams' right
handed slants, Coach Wolter will
probably start Frank McGraw be
hind the plate, Dick Clegg on first,
Ray Wyiterhalter at second. Dave
Melton at short, Captain Bill Arce
on the hot corner, and Bud Klein,
Charlie Cole, and Bob Nava in the
outer gardens.
The biggest shift to date finds
made-over catcher Dick Clegg on
the initial sack. Clegg is still a bit
awkward around his new position,
but adds plenty of power to the
batting order.
The Card keystone combination
of peppery Ray Winterhalter and
slugging Dave Melton was out
standing on the tiip south. Melton
was superb in the field and drove
in nine runs in four games with his
big bat. while Winterhalter turned
in a fine series around second and
drove across three runs.
Stanford's varsity baseball nine,
still licking its wounds from a
double pasting at the hands of UCLA
last weekend, will go after non
conference game toniaht when it
tackles the COP Tigers under the
Stockton Oak Park arcs. Game time
is set for 8 o'clock.
Stanford's starting pitcher is
strictly a matter of conjecture at
this writing. Coach Harry Wolter,
meditating over the fact that nei
!her of his starters lasted more than
five innings against UCLA, has not
yet named his starter, and will
rrobably not do so until shortly be
fore game time.
Tiie two Daves, Dahle and Sott,
curve-balling Frank Laßrum, and
rangy Jim CI ay pool are all ready to
go. but right-hander Ed Shive may
get the nod to open against his
home-town rivals.
