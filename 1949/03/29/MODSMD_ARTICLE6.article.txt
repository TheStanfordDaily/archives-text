# Bookstore Line Gets Test Today
## 
### 
Today is the big test day for the
new Bookstore line -up system.
First classes of spring quarter will
meet this morning, and after they
are over most Farm Roughs will
pour into the store for their class
supplies.
Yesterday's textbook line rarely
extended beyond the side-door en
trance of the store. As students en
tered the building, they picked up
an order blank and wrote down
the authors and titles of their text
books.
When a customer reached the
cash register, a clerk took his order
! ship, got the texts from the shelves,
j and returned with the books to the
i student.
The entire length of the textbook
and typewriter counters has been
roped off to keep the line straight
and to discourage line crashers.
Supplies and general books may
be purchased without waiting in
ine, and students may walk in the
front door. But students wanting
textbooks must enter tile Bookstore
through the side entrance on the
west side of the building.
The line-up system will be used
at the Bookstore until the regis
tration week pressure ends.
