J. Paul Sheedy* Switched to Wildroot (Team-Oil
Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test
POOR old Sheedy had a hang dog look before he tried tha
Finger-Nail Test and switched to Wi'.droot Cream-Oil.
Today—he's a blue ribbon winner. Regular use of Wildroot
Cream-Oil now gives him a snappy, well-groomed look. No
longer is he bothered by dryness and loose, ugly dandruff. MM
He's out of the dog house for good with his girl friends. Why
not dog trot down to your nearest drug store for a bottle or f(i
tube of non-alcoholic Wildroot Cream-Oil right now! And ask ;! KbHI |>j
your barber for professional applications. You'll find that once H ''
you start using Wildroot Cream-Oil containing Lanolin, you're [(.' j
a gay dog in even the best society. a,
