A round, black piece of rubber,
marked with a cross, has proved to
be an innovation in shoe heels.
Howard H. Moody, inventor of the
new rubber heel, promised to pay
$1,000 to anyone who could prove
the heel would wear out—and eat
the heel, to boot.
The part of the heel that resem
bles that on an ordinary pair of
shoes is made of plastic and hol
i lowed out. Tin. rubber part is in
serted in the center with the aid ot
a resilient rubber ring.
These pattented rubber heels are
i suitable lor men's shoes, and the
| amount of "give" in each heel is
I based on the approximate weight ot
■ the wearer.
With a twist of the wrist these
j rubber heels can be turned so they
: will wear evenly. This eliminates
j the need to buy new heels when
I only one side is ground down.
Moody, who has teen stationary
engineer at the Village power plant
for two years, spent 12 years per-
I fee ting his invention.
