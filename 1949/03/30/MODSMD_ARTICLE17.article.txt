NEWARK. N.J., March 29 — A
coast-to-coast tour of 18 Commu
nist "world peace" conference del
egates ended before it started to
night.
The Slate Department spiked the
proposed cross-country journey of
delegates from behind the Iron Cur
tain less than 12 hours before they
were to appear at the first of a
series of "no more war" rallies here.
The Department said their U.S.
visas were good only for last week
end's Cultural and Scientific Con
ference for World Peace in New
York City.
NEW YORK. March 29—New se
ries of retail price cuts were laid
before the consumer today, further
clipping inflation's wings.
Automobiles and auto accessories,
radios, refrigerators, and ranges
were among the wide variety of

items affected. Continued reduc
tions in such basic commodities
lead, zinc, copper, and steel indi
cated that there might be further
cuts in manufactured goods in the
wind.

WASHINGTON. March 29-Con
gress today approved a 15 - month
rent control bill with a "home rule"
escape clause and sent the measure
on to the White House.
Although it does not contain as
much as President Truman had
asked, he is expected to sign the
legislation to replace the present
law which expires at midnight
Thursday.
The new rent bill continues rent
ceilings for 15 months, to June 30,
1950, and sets up a "home rule"
process for decontrol of states, cit
ies, or other local areas.
