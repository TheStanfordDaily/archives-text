# Inadequate Housing Criticized by Kimpton

### 
(Editor's Note: The following discussion by Dean of Students Law
rence Kimpton appeared in the March Alumni Review.)
"I am pretty unhappy about our whole housing situation. We have
about 1,300 men and almost 100 women living at the Village, for instance.
Fcr the most part they live in barracks-type buildings with eight to a
room, and the room is nothing more than a small semi-enclosed area
created by war surplus lockers piled on top of each other.
"One of the things we can do and ought to be doing, and they can't do,
is house all of our students on the campus. We ought to build a residence
institution with a rich internal life on the Farm for graduate and under
graduates.
"But look at the facts. We are housing on the campus in the University
residences and the fraternities only 37 per cent of our students. If we
toss in Stanford Village as a University operation, it brings the figure up
to 53 per cent.
"Only a little more than half of our students live in campus or Uni
versity operated residences! And this rather dismal percentage is achieved
only by heavy crowding.
The number in the halls and houses is up from 5 per cent to 25 per cent
over normal occupancy figmes. We can't even get our freshmen under
a single roof. Only 84 per cent of our freshmen are at Encina and the
rest at the Village or at home. And only G8 per cent of our freshmen
women are at Roble, with the rest in Branner, Lagunita, and at home.
"Encina Commons was built to feed about 450, and we arc feeding over
900 there, cafeteria style, with almost every chair in the place warmed
twice for each meal.
"The beautifid new Crothers Hall for lav/ students helps, but it houses
only 62 men. And Stern Dormitory, which is opening next fall, will be
wonderful, but it houses and feeds only 228 men.
"When I say that 47 per cent of our students are unable to obtain
housing from the University, I am talking about almost 4,000 students,
on the basis of - our present enrollment of about 8,000.
"They live from Sausalito to San Jose, and from La Honda to Livermore.
A boy has to join a fraternity if he hopes to live on campus in his sopho
ruore and junior years, and nobody at Stanford to have to join
anything.
"Perhaps the most serious problem created is the change in focus of
social life. Inevitably it has shifted off campus to the spots along the
highway and in the City. If we can't give them a home on the Farm,
they'll go elsewhere, too, for their recreation."
