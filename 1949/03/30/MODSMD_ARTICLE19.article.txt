# Class Grades Instructor
## 
### 
Near the end of each quarter a small number of Stanford instructors ask
students for written comments about their courses and instruction. Ques
tions usually relate to quality of presentation and content. As a result, the
lecturers learn their weak points in delivery as well as the short-comings
of the courses.
For the most part, students are requested to list any suggestions that
might be applied to improve a course. One lecturer, however, distributed
an extensive '"multiple choice" questionnaire to his students. It contained
queries on every phase of the course's material and lectures.
In order to receive sincere answers, the lecturer requested that names
nol be signed to the form. He did not request that the students' midterm
litter grades be noted down. Had he asked for that grade, the lecturer
would have been even better informed as to what category of studnts
offered the most adverse criticisms.
Below is a number of the questions posed by the engineering instructor
on his student opinion form. Students checked the appropriate opinion.
Every question was followed by space for student comment to qualify
hio answer if necessary.
