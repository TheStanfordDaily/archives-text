# Princeton's New Grade Plan Starts
## 
### 
Princeton University has intro-*
dueed a new academic program :
i which measures student effort on ;
the basis of over-all ability, thus j
j disregarding deficiencies in minor!
I subjects.
Under the program, which is ex- j
peeled to have far-reaching infiu- ]
j ence among other schools, the uni- !
! versity has discarded the traditional
! college practice of requiring a spe
! eific number of course credits for a
1 degree.
It has also drastically revised :
I present standards of "passing" and ;
j "failure."
Henceforth, Dr. Jeremiah S. Finch '
said, a student who fails a subject j
will not have to repeat that course [
or an equivalent course. His over
all performance instead of individual
! course grades will be the criterion j
for determining whether a student i
should be allowed to continue col
j lege.
"A student who has several fail- i
! uros, but who nevertheless has an
| average which meets the univer- j
sity's requirements, will be allowed
to continue college,' Dr. Finch as- I
; serted. "We are emphasizing a j
j qualitative rather than a quantita- |
I tive concept of education."
; Many professional schools, includ
ing most of the medical colleges,
long ago adopted this view, he said. !
Until now, Dr. Finch continued, a
! student had to pass a certain number |
; of required courses to receive a de- j
gree. "We believe that the 'pass-fail' I
system is not educationally valid,"
he commented.
At Princeton the faculty commit
tee has established a system of
"sliding averages." A freshman who.
| perhaps because of the newness of ;
college work, failed several subjects, j
would be permitted a lower general
average than would sophomores,
juniors, or seniors. With each suc
ceeding year, however, his work
would be reviewed and the require- i
ments for a passing average scaled
higher.
Actually, Dr. Finch said, the new
program does not make it any easier
for students to get their degrees. ■
even though in some instances a
student may now earn a degree with
far less credits than before. Most
| students who failed under the old
system, he explained, would also fail
under the new program.
It does, however, make college life
a little easier for students, particu
i larly for the "borderline cases." \
Under the traditional system, these
I students, the least able, were forced
to carry an extra burden of "make
up" courses to replace the subjects
; in which they had failed.—Leonard
Buder, in New York Times.

Buder, in New York Times.
Princeton University has intro-*
dueed a new academic program :
i which measures student effort on ;
the basis of over-all ability, thus j
j disregarding deficiencies in minor!
I subjects.
Under the program, which is ex- j
peeled to have far-reaching infiu- ]
j ence among other schools, the uni- !
! versity has discarded the traditional
! college practice of requiring a spe
! eific number of course credits for a
1 degree.
It has also drastically revised :
I present standards of "passing" and ;
j "failure."
Henceforth, Dr. Jeremiah S. Finch '
said, a student who fails a subject j
will not have to repeat that course [
or an equivalent course. His over
all performance instead of individual
! course grades will be the criterion j
for determining whether a student i
should be allowed to continue col
j lege.
"A student who has several fail- i
! uros, but who nevertheless has an
| average which meets the univer- j
sity's requirements, will be allowed
to continue college,' Dr. Finch as- I
; serted. "We are emphasizing a j
j qualitative rather than a quantita- |
I tive concept of education."
; Many professional schools, includ
ing most of the medical colleges,
long ago adopted this view, he said. !
Until now, Dr. Finch continued, a
! student had to pass a certain number |
; of required courses to receive a de- j
gree. "We believe that the 'pass-fail' I
system is not educationally valid,"
he commented.
At Princeton the faculty commit
tee has established a system of
"sliding averages." A freshman who.
| perhaps because of the newness of ;
college work, failed several subjects, j
would be permitted a lower general
average than would sophomores,
juniors, or seniors. With each suc
ceeding year, however, his work
would be reviewed and the require- i
ments for a passing average scaled
higher.
Actually, Dr. Finch said, the new
program does not make it any easier
for students to get their degrees. ■
even though in some instances a
student may now earn a degree with
far less credits than before. Most
| students who failed under the old
system, he explained, would also fail
under the new program.
It does, however, make college life
a little easier for students, particu
i larly for the "borderline cases." \
Under the traditional system, these
I students, the least able, were forced
to carry an extra burden of "make
up" courses to replace the subjects
; in which they had failed.—Leonard
Buder, in New York Times.
