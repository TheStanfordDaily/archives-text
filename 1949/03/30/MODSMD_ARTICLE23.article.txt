More Facts Against Ram's Head
To the Editor:
An Alfred Wm. Lees allowed a rather facetious and vitriolic letter,
daected to Rams Head, to be printed Tuesday. Although the grounds for
Sciici letter are valid, the prime reason behind the letter seems to be one
ol hurt pride, rather than sound, specific complaints against the organ
ization.
I would like, therefore, to support Mr. Lees' basic contention with a
few more facts.
Ii is my belief that Ram s Head cannot hope to compete with Broadway:
therefoie, their production campaign should lie one ot aid to the student
rather than exploitation of him.
Last spring, Ram's Head asked for original scripts, the best script (in
their opinion) to be produced. The scripts didn't measure up to Ram's
Head's nebulous high standards—they were, therefore, junked, and the
group fell back upon an old "tried and true" formula job, produced some
years previously, which saved Ram's Head the uncomfortable job of
making a workable production of one of the submitted scripts.
By doing the latter, they would have helped present Stanford play
wrights, and also would have lived up to the intended purpose of the
organization. In that instance, as it often is, there was a question of time.
But, the necessity for a rush act was brought about by Ram's Head's
pi oerastination and disorganization, not by the playwrights.
This year, Rani's Head pulled the same general deal, but went il one
better. They upped the ante by 200 bucks, and threw around a lot of
gn.dy posters urging Stanford writers to submit their wares.
They promised to notify the donors by March 17th whether or not their
respective scripts had been accepted for production. As this letter is pub
lished. the writers still don't know what the score is.
Ram's Head has kept mum. But. the script has already been selected—
in fact, it is being prepared right now! Ram's Head has had ample time
to both notify the writers, as well as to publish their decision; but they
haven't.
Who gets the 200 bucks' Nobody. Ram's Head is keeping it for them
selves. The book for the show is being re-written by an ex-Stanford stu
dent: the musical score has been composed by a UCLA student. Neither
person is eligible for the awards.
"lhe clique that runs Rams Head seems to have set themselves up as
the coming producers of our age. They can't afford the time to help
Stanford writers, but also forget that those scripters have spent as much
time as a year writing and preparing their Spring Show entries.
Yet. Ram s Head can treat them as obsequious servants to the cause of
art. Personally, even though they employ these methods, I have yet
to see a decent Ram's Head production in the last three years.
It appears to me that ii our college impresarios continue to employ these
same methods, it will be just a matter of a short time before they're out
or street corners cadging quarters!

Why No Wrestling?
To the Editor:
After consulting my Time Schedule for next quarter in order to figure
out my future program, I made the incredible discovery that there is no
course in wrestling offered by the University.
i wonder what the SAC has up its sleeve. Every other university, col
lege. or high school, yet. that I have ever heard about oil the West Coast
has offered to its student the opportunity to take a course in wrestling.
I firmly doubt that the SAC is running so low on funds that they have
to fold up one of their courses in order to make both ends meet, if they
think there is not enough enthusiasm for the sport, they should have been
to see the intramurals.

(Editor's Note: Wrestling was given both autumn and winter quarters
ol this year by Chuck Taylor. Like nearly all other courses in the Uni
versity, wrestling is not offered every quarter. Funds, in this case, do
not determine whether the wrestling course is presented because the
athletic staff has to be rotated to handle spring sports.)
