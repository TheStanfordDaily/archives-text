## Bull Session 
### 
Evrey year at this time approximately 101 per cent of the men on campus
become broad-minded. And. with broads in mind, their thoughts turn to
(what else?) Lake Lagunita. So. being no different from the rest of the
rtci-blooded Stanford roughs, I decided yesterday to put on la.st year's
trunks, which fit me like last year's trunks, and go over to the Lake.
Gad, what a scene of joyous pleasure that lake was!
"Here." I said to myself, "is the college life I've dreamed about. The
eel lege life I read about in 'The Rover Boys at Balboa Tech.' That's what
I like about college," Iphilosophized, "it's so collegiate!"
But my reverie was broken by the mhthful laughter of the sunbathers
who were pointing at me and giggling.
"Oh. joy of joys," I thought. "What fun it is to belong; to be one of
the big, happy Stanford family!"
But then I looked down at last year's trunks. Flying out a strategically
placed hole were a dozen of last year's moths.
Quickly covering myself with my history book. "Inside John Gunther,"
I sat down and tried to absorb a little sunshine. This seemingly simple
task was made considerably harder by a small boy who kept asking me
to "make the moths fly out again. Mister."
I wished I could have gone in swimming, but I had to stay out of the
cold water because I've got something wrong with my stomach. No guts.
I must admit, however, that it was great fun sitting on the pier listening
to the Roble girls strum their ukeleles and sing those clever little songs
like "If I Had My Life To Live Over. I'd Live Over the Burlesque Show."
and "It's Too Bad You Meant Your Ukelele When You Said Your G-Strinir
Broke."
But all was not quiet and serene with my thoughts. As 1 watched the
water I couldn't help thinking about writer Jack Douglas' story about the
fisherman who was arrested for violating the Mann Act. It seems the
police caught him transporting female seals across the state line for
immoral porpoises.
