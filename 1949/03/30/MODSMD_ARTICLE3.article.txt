# Overnight Leaves On Sign-out Slips Undergo Change
## 
### 
Changes in the old sign-out slips,
which will go out of use this week
end, were announced by Buffy
Working, Women's Council chair
men, at AWS cabinet meeting yes
terday.
The new slips will have the
phrase "permission granted by"
omitted from the overnight leaves.
All the slips will have a double line
at the bottom under which addi
tional information such as "campus
production leave" or "participant's
leave" may be added.
Miss Working pointed out that if
anything above the double line was
left off it would count as a techni
cal, but additional information does
not necessarily have to be added
below the line.
It was decided % that the social
regulations committee should work
tor two weeks at formulating the
new regulations book'et, which
would then be discussed by AWS
and presented to the women at
house meetings.
