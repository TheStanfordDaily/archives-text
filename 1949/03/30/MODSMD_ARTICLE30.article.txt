campus sometime next week, ac
cording to Fire Chief John Mar
ston.
New recording and alarm box
equipment is now being installed to
replace the system which has been
in service for more than 20 years.
The installation cost is about $15.-
000.
The new system has several ad
vantages over the one now in use.
Chief Marston said. It can be ex
panded to keep pace with future
growth of the University. In addi
tion. it enables the fire department
to maintain closer supervision over
the alarm system.
The new system eliminates many
mechanical weaknesses found in the

o'd equipment and will therefore be
more reliable, Chief Marston said.
Another new feature is a direct
wire to the chief's home. All alarms
will be sounded in his home and in
the home of another fireman living
on campus. The new system also
enables the chief to communicate
