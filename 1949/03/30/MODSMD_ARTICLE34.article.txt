j CHICAGO, March 29 </Pt.—Frank
Lane, general manager, thinks the
! "very unusual" Southern Califor
nia weather has had something to
j do with the tardy spring training
j development of the Chicago White
j Sox.
Lane, fresh off a plane from
| ' windy and colder than blue blazes"
J Pasadena, declared that the Sox,
; especially the pitchers, are not in
| good shape.
'"We have a lot of colds and
■ sniflles on the squad—the weather
! has been brutal, for California," said
! Lane. "I was shivering in an over
| coat at Pasadena yesterday."
Lane said that with the exception
i of the Pittsburgh Pirates, "sheltered
| from high winds" at San Bernar
| dino, West Coast training has had
i poor results this spring.
"The Cubs at Los Angeles and the
! Browns at Burbank are just about
in the same boat as the Sox," he
! continued.
Lane conceded that this was an
exceptional year for California
weather.
