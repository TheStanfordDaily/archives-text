# Long PCL Race Starts Today
## Peerless Pickers Choose Rainiers To Cop Twenty-six Week Marathon 
### 
Pants Rowland's paid employees, the Coast League's triple
aye diamond specialists, will swing into action today with a set
of games which are expected to draw the largest opening day
crowds in PCL history.
Topping the opening day program is the afternoon contest in
Los Angeles between the favorite

Seattle Rainiers and LA's own, the
Cub-fed Angels.
The other afternoon opener fea
tures Lefty O'Doul's Seals playing
host to Bill Sweeney's Portland Bea
vers.
Oakland will travel to Sacra
mento, and Hollywood will invade
San Diego in the other curtain
raisers.
Loop President Clarence "Pants"
Rowland predicts a "doglight for the
pennant and a new all-time minor
league attendance record." But
other baseball men aren't so sure.
Majors Still Stingy
?till lacking promised major
league talent, most of the clubs are
staitiny the elongated PCL cam
paign with motors missing and a
lot of gaps to fill. As yet. the major- !
league teams have not come up with
starting nines, so the gasping
Coasters will just have to gasp a
little longer.
A majority of the baseball scribes
on the Coast have given Seattle's ,
veteran Rainiers the edge in the 1
coming pennant chase, so it was no
surprise last night when the Stan-!
lord Sports Stafl followed suit by i
making those same Rainiers their j
number-one choice.
Basing their opinion on the fact
that Jo-jo White's Seattle boys are
already set for the season, with
every position filled by a capable i
veteran, they pick Seattle to coast
in by a slight margin over the Los
Angeles Angels.
1 lie total flag race should end up
about this way, or so says The
Daily Sports staff:

11)48
Finish
1. Seattle Rainiers 4
2. Los Angeles Angels ;}
.'i. San Diego Padres 7
4. Hollywood Stars (i
"). Oakland Oaks 1
■». San Francisco Seals 2
7. Portland Beavers 5
•S. Sacramento Solons S
Talent Will Arrive
After tlie majors finish loading up
their little cousins, the Coast race
should develop into a real battle.
I'iv-e brand new managers, just
down from the big-time should help
tilings along.
Bucky Harris, the former Yankee
headman, tops the list as he will
flash signals from the San Diego
bench. Bill Sweeney, from Detroit,
is back at Portland where he led
the Beavers to a league crown in
1934.
The other newcomers to Coast
circles are Chuck Dressen of New
\ork, at Oakland; Del Baker from
the Boston Red Sox, at Sacramento;
and Fred Hainey of the St. Louis
Browns, at Hollywood.
Holdover managers are the an
ient Lefty O'Doul at his beloved
San Francisco home; Bill Kelly at
Los Angeles; and Jo Jo White at
Seattle.

Pants Rowland's paid employees, the Coast League's triple
aye diamond specialists, will swing into action today with a set
of games which are expected to draw the largest opening day
crowds in PCL history.
Topping the opening day program is the afternoon contest in
Los Angeles between the favorite

Seattle Rainiers and LA's own, the
Cub-fed Angels.
The other afternoon opener fea
tures Lefty O'Doul's Seals playing
host to Bill Sweeney's Portland Bea
vers.
Oakland will travel to Sacra
mento, and Hollywood will invade
San Diego in the other curtain
raisers.
Loop President Clarence "Pants"
Rowland predicts a "doglight for the
pennant and a new all-time minor
league attendance record." But
other baseball men aren't so sure.
Majors Still Stingy
?till lacking promised major
league talent, most of the clubs are
staitiny the elongated PCL cam
paign with motors missing and a
lot of gaps to fill. As yet. the major- !
league teams have not come up with
starting nines, so the gasping
Coasters will just have to gasp a
little longer.
A majority of the baseball scribes
on the Coast have given Seattle's ,
veteran Rainiers the edge in the 1
coming pennant chase, so it was no
surprise last night when the Stan-!
lord Sports Stafl followed suit by i
making those same Rainiers their j
number-one choice.
Basing their opinion on the fact
that Jo-jo White's Seattle boys are
already set for the season, with
every position filled by a capable i
veteran, they pick Seattle to coast
in by a slight margin over the Los
Angeles Angels.

Pants Rowland's paid employees, the Coast League's triple
aye diamond specialists, will swing into action today with a set
of games which are expected to draw the largest opening day
crowds in PCL history.
Topping the opening day program is the afternoon contest in
Los Angeles between the favorite

Seattle Rainiers and LA's own, the
Cub-fed Angels.
The other afternoon opener fea
tures Lefty O'Doul's Seals playing
host to Bill Sweeney's Portland Bea
vers.
Oakland will travel to Sacra
mento, and Hollywood will invade
San Diego in the other curtain
raisers.
Loop President Clarence "Pants"
Rowland predicts a "doglight for the
pennant and a new all-time minor
league attendance record." But
other baseball men aren't so sure.
Majors Still Stingy
?till lacking promised major
league talent, most of the clubs are
staitiny the elongated PCL cam
paign with motors missing and a
lot of gaps to fill. As yet. the major- !
league teams have not come up with
starting nines, so the gasping
Coasters will just have to gasp a
little longer.
A majority of the baseball scribes
on the Coast have given Seattle's ,
veteran Rainiers the edge in the 1
coming pennant chase, so it was no
surprise last night when the Stan-!
lord Sports Stafl followed suit by i
making those same Rainiers their j
number-one choice.
Basing their opinion on the fact
that Jo-jo White's Seattle boys are
already set for the season, with
every position filled by a capable i
veteran, they pick Seattle to coast
in by a slight margin over the Los
Angeles Angels.
1 lie total flag race should end up
about this way, or so says The
Daily Sports staff:

11)48
Finish
1. Seattle Rainiers 4
2. Los Angeles Angels ;}
.'i. San Diego Padres 7
4. Hollywood Stars (i
"). Oakland Oaks 1
■». San Francisco Seals 2
7. Portland Beavers 5
•S. Sacramento Solons S
Talent Will Arrive
After tlie majors finish loading up
their little cousins, the Coast race
should develop into a real battle.
I'iv-e brand new managers, just
down from the big-time should help
tilings along.
Bucky Harris, the former Yankee
headman, tops the list as he will
flash signals from the San Diego
bench. Bill Sweeney, from Detroit,
is back at Portland where he led
the Beavers to a league crown in
1934.
The other newcomers to Coast
circles are Chuck Dressen of New
\ork, at Oakland; Del Baker from
the Boston Red Sox, at Sacramento;
and Fred Hainey of the St. Louis
Browns, at Hollywood.
Holdover managers are the an
ient Lefty O'Doul at his beloved
San Francisco home; Bill Kelly at
Los Angeles; and Jo Jo White at
Seattle.
Starting today's ballgames will be
the following teams:
