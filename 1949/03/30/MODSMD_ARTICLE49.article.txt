# Peace Pipe Puffs Put Pictures in Proper Place
## 
### AL BERRY 
This is going to be a small column on motion pictures in gen
eral, and The Daily's aftitude toward them in particular. This
isn't going to be any Hedda Hopperish gossip job, because we
don't care who marries who how many times. We just have a
couple of things to tell you, and it seems that this is the best
way to do it. *

First of all come the puffs. Once
upon a time, back before the veter
ans traded in their khakis for levis,
'lhc Daily printed little figures next
to their movie reviews to let the
reader know whether the picture
stunk or was just bad. This idea
was dropped in 1!J45, and—what do
you know—presto, quickie, the local
humor magazine picked up the idea,
built a bored-looking bear and
started reviewing movies on their
own.
Since the Chappie's reviews
seemed to be more for laughs than
for accurate reviewing, The Daily
never reverted back to its opinion
ated Indian figure.
Cartoon Added
This quarter, however, The Daily

is presenting with
each and every
movie review the
cartoon seen at
the right. The In
dian remains the
same with each of
the four cuts we
have, but the
puffs of smoke,
vary with th e ■
judged quality of

the picture. This cartoon, drawn by
Chappieman Geoff Relf, has four
puffs, and we have printed it today
because you may never see it again.
Four puffs mean that the picture is
a super hum-dinger, and will be re
served for pictures of the "Hamlet"
or "The King's Jester" stature.
Three puffs mean that the Hick is
well above average, but will not
ring any golden bells when it dies
and goes to heaven. "Yellow Sky,"
The Saxon Charm," or "Francis I"
would be thiee-putf pictures. Two
puffs mean that the picture is a good
time-killer and is about par. War
ner Brothers' "Fighter Squadron" is
a good example of a "two-puffer."
The unfortunate one puff means
that you'd be better off studying. It
shows that advance billing built up
the flick to a degree that your re
viewers thought it was worth seeing,
and were mistaken. "The Paleface"
gets our nomination for a one
puffer.
B-niinus Films
Regarding the hundreds of B
minus pictures that come and go,
we don't—or try not—to bother to
review them. As a general rule, a
picture should be worth seeing if
it is worth reviewing. Even "The
Paleface" appealed to many, so it
was reviewed. Movie reviewing
must, of necessity, be very opinion
ated. The reviewer must decide
whether or not he liked the picture
first, then decide whether or not
the average student will like the
picture, and then write his review
accordingly.
The present reviewing staff of The
Daily is prone to consider great act
ing, good directing, and good writ
ing first, and to place the more
la-de-da stuff—which often makes
for good entertainment — second.
Thus, "The King's Jester" would get
possibly four putt's, while "Every
Gir! Should Be Married" might get
but one or two. In other words,
quhe often the good "heavy" will
be rated higher than the good
"comedy."
