## $4,454 Spent by Administration For Extra Refrigeration Space 
### JIM THURBER Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University spent $4,454 installing extra refrigeration ir.
women's houses to comply with the state "individual container"
milk bottle law, Business Manager Alf Brandin reported yester
day.
The 54,454 would be enough to finance more than seven tuitior.

scholarships here at Stanford for
one year.
The "individual container" law
requires all boarding houses to
serve milk out of small bottles, and
not out of large, multi-gallon cans.
Before last summer, all the resi
dences on campus, except Encina,
served milk at the table in pitchers.
The milk was bought from the dai
ries in large cans of five gallons or
more.
The first shift, ordered by the
Health Department, was made last
summer at Lagunita when a walk
in refrigerator was installed for
$2,200.
Before school started in Septem
ber, five cabinet refrigerators and
three iceboxes were installed in
Women's Row houses at a total cost
of $2,254. No new equipment was
installed in Roble, Branner, and a
fpw Lasuen houses, but existing
equipment is badly overtaxed.
Fraternities, which have used
large containers up till now, are
faced with this same problem. Ted
LeVino started work on a special
bill to exempt fraternities from this
law. but the State Assembly com
mittee on livestock and dairies ta
bled the bill.
Over three-quarters of the fra
ternities will have to install extra
equipment to take care of the small
containers, and many of these have
stated that they do not have the
money for new refrigerators. The
cost may run well into the thou
sands of dollars.
Until new equipment is installed,
milk consumption will be cut
sharply in the fraternity houses. A
40 per cent rise in milk costs is
expected under the new system.
