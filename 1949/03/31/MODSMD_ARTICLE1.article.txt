# Luckett Upholds Bulk Milk
## 
### JIM THURBER Associate Editor, The Daily 
"The use of small individual-service milk
bottles in fraternities is less desirable than the
use of bulk milk, in fact, it is somewhat unsani
tary," Stanford Health Officer George Luckett
said yesterday.
"As long as the large milk cans are properly
refrigerated, they pose no serious health prob
lem," he continued. "But the stacking of small
bottles in refrigerators would help to spread
contamination."
He was guick to say, however, that he was
in favor of restrictions as they applied to res
taurants and milk bars. Many of these places
have been very careless in the handling of milk.
Discusses Attempt
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Luckett dis
cussed the recent attempt by Farm fraternities
to amend the "individual container" milk bill.
This bill reguires all boarding houses, catering
to the public, to serve milk in individual bottles.
In references to this bill, Attorney General

Fred N. Howser ruled that fraternities are board
ing houses serving to the public. But earlier,
when talking about the restaurant act, he said
that they were not serving to the public.
Milk vs. Hamburger
Dr. Luckett pointed out that when a fraternity
serves a hamburger, it is not serving to the pub
lic, but that the milk on the table at the same
time is being served to the public.
"If an amendment could be put through stat
ing that the fraternities were not serving to
the public, the whole problem would be
solved," Dr. Luckett said.
"This type of bill would probably have a
much better chance of passing the state legis
lature than one specifically exempting fraterni
ties from the milk bill, as was the case with
the amendment proposed earlier by Ted Le-
Vino," he continued.
He also stated that the State Department of
Agriculture had no intention of including fra
ternities under the "individual container" law.
This group is completely in favor of the new
amendment.
