## 
### 
The Burma YWCA must work
more closely with the church than
the American group does, Daw
Katherine Khin-Khin, Burmese "Y"
leader, told the "Y" Cabinet in the
Women's Clubhouse yesterday.
Miss Khin-Khin said the work of
the YWCA unit in Burma is of a
wider range because the Red Cross
there is connected mostly with the
SPCA and other similar groups.
The "Y" deals with better condi
tions in Burma than in India, but
considerable decentralization is
needed to reach all parts of the
country, she added.
At present the Burma YWCA is
incorporated with the India-Cey
lon - Pakistan area group. Miss
Khin-Khin is working to establish
it as an independent national unit.
She attended the international
Convention in San Francisco after
completing a course at Columbia
University, and has since visited
various units. Miss Khin-Khin is
head instructress at St. Mary's girls'
school in Rangoon.
