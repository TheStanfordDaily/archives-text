## Ram's Head Scripts 
### 
Four letters printed in The Daily this week contain criticisms
of the Ram's Head theatrical organization. We have talked with
two of the letter writers and several Ram's Head members.
Briefly, the criticism of Ram's Head, particularly in their selec
tion of student-written plays, is:
1. Ram's Head members have had a priority over non-members
when scripts were chosen for productions.
2. The organization has been exploiting students rather than
helping them.
3. Ram's Head selected the 1949 Spring Show script without
notifying all of the writers. In addition, the $200 prize money
for the winning student will be pocketed by the organization
because the writers are not registered students.
In answer to those charges, the Ram's Head members said:
1. Membership within Ram's Head is not a criterion to script
acceptance. Two out of three of the 1948 One-Acts, for instance,
were written by non-Ram's Head members.
2. One of the judges of this year's scripts was Professor
Hubert Heffner of the Speech and Drama Department. Without
Ram's Head suggestions, he picked the same script as Ram's
Head members had because, "It is the only producible script
turned in—the others could not be re-written." Writers without
academic playwriting experience compete with students who are
drama majors.
3. Ram's Head listed March 17 as the closing date of the script
contest. All four students entering the contest were notified
that judgment would be delayed, but that they would be given
the results as soon as possible. The Ram's Head member in
charge of the contest admitted that he did not have time to notify
the contestants of the results.
4. Although the prize money was put up to encourage more
students to turn in Spring Show scripts, the Ram's Head members
blamed a late starting date as the cause for the small number
of entries. No money was pocketed by Ram's Head, because
Excom approved that sum to be taken from the improvement
fund. The fund cannot be touched without Excom approval.
One of the letters printed below states that Ram's Head lost
a submitted script. While the script was received and read, one
of the members evidently was careless in his handling of the
work.
In summary, Ram's Head members say that those scripts
chosen are the best available. Writers, on the other hand, ques
tion the integrity of those choices. The proof will come in the
presentation. We advise that the organization improve its public
relations by keeping script writers posted on the judging. Au
thors regard their works as pieces of art; their tempers run high
when they believe that their products are treated with indif
ference.

because the writers are not registered students.
In answer to those charges, the Ram's Head members said:
1. Membership within Ram's Head is not a criterion to script
acceptance. Two out of three of the 1948 One-Acts, for instance,
were written by non-Ram's Head members.
2. One of the judges of this year's scripts was Professor
Hubert Heffner of the Speech and Drama Department. Without
Ram's Head suggestions, he picked the same script as Ram's
Head members had because, "It is the only producible script
turned in—the others could not be re-written." Writers without
academic playwriting experience compete with students who are
drama majors.
3. Ram's Head listed March 17 as the closing date of the script
contest. All four students entering the contest were notified
that judgment would be delayed, but that they would be given
the results as soon as possible. The Ram's Head member in
charge of the contest admitted that he did not have time to notify
the contestants of the results.
4. Although the prize money was put up to encourage more
students to turn in Spring Show scripts, the Ram's Head members
blamed a late starting date as the cause for the small number
of entries. No money was pocketed by Ram's Head, because
Excom approved that sum to be taken from the improvement
fund. The fund cannot be touched without Excom approval.
One of the letters printed below states that Ram's Head lost
a submitted script. While the script was received and read, one
of the members evidently was careless in his handling of the
work.
In summary, Ram's Head members say that those scripts
chosen are the best available. Writers, on the other hand, ques
tion the integrity of those choices. The proof will come in the
presentation. We advise that the organization improve its public
relations by keeping script writers posted on the judging. Au
thors regard their works as pieces of art; their tempers run high
when they believe that their products are treated with indif
ference.
Four letters printed in The Daily this week contain criticisms
of the Ram's Head theatrical organization. We have talked with
two of the letter writers and several Ram's Head members.
Briefly, the criticism of Ram's Head, particularly in their selec
tion of student-written plays, is:
1. Ram's Head members have had a priority over non-members
when scripts were chosen for productions.
2. The organization has been exploiting students rather than
helping them.
3. Ram's Head selected the 1949 Spring Show script without
notifying all of the writers. In addition, the $200 prize money
for the winning student will be pocketed by the organization
because the writers are not registered students.
