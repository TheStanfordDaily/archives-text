To the Editor:
Mr. Lees letter in Tuesday s Daily has brought to the surface a suspi
cion long harbored by many a Stanford playgoer and writer. A couple of
years ago we, too, submitted for Rani's Head consideration an original
one-act play which, is not a magnum opus, at least ranked as a pleasant
little comedy of manners. Its rejection led us to believe that the student
organization maintained rigid standards of excellence in making its periodic
judgments.
That our assumption was spurious became painfully manifest in the
groups subsequent offerings. Repeatedly, the so-called "open competi
tion is won by individuals who are already Ram's Head members. And
repeatedly, the productions spew forth a mawkish lack of talent, wit,
and taste. The injury is further compounded when one considers audi
ences which must pay to witness these studious evasions of substance
and craftsmanship.
A casual appraisal might lead to the view that mere stupidity gives rise
to the general defection. Unhappily, the membership status of the several
authors chosen seems to preclude such a possibility. May we suggest that
th*' ethics which here obtain must inevitably be associated with the road
leading to the pokey.
The winds of freedom may blow, but not quite vigorously enough, per
haps, tor an unmistakeable odor hangs heavy on the campus air.
We anxiously await a refreshing gust from Ram's Mead.
