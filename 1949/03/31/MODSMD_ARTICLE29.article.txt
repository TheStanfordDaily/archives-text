# Shoddy Management
## 
### 
To tho Editor:
Since this seems to be open season for Ram's Head, I'd like to fire my
volley, too. My complaint isn't one critical of the editorial judgment of
the Ram's Head directors, but rather of n much less excusable weakness—
that of shoddy management. Like the other young man, I submitted a
m i ipt to the recent competition for one-act plays, a script which has
suffered a fate worse than rejection—it has been lost.
Such treatment of submitted material is certainly no way to encourage
competition from the student body as a whole, if indeed, as the other
writer has questioned, such be their purpose.
My purpose, and my only one, in writing this is to stir some deadhead
out of his fat lethargy enough to dig up my script and send it back to me
Tins I would duly appreciate, as 1 rlon't happen to have a carbon.
