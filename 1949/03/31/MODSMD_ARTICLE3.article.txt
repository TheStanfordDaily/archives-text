### DICK SEIBEL 
The Stanford Speech Clinic, es- .
tablished in 19:52, is now a thriving !
part of the University program. Its

who needs speech training will be j

The clinic, in its 17 years, has !
treated 1.057 individuals for all j
types of speech difficulties. Not all
of these have been members of the

Stanford family; many have been
residents of nearby towns.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson has been

students.
The clinic provides a carefully
supervised training for students in
speech correction and in physical
therapy. Dr. Anderson supervises
the clinicians in all their work and
still handles some of the more dif

have been trained in speech therapy
work by the clinic.
About one-fourth of the 58 pa
tients this quarter are children,
some of faculty members or stu
dents, but most from families in this
area.
The operations of the clinic are
essential to the Stanford family, as
surveys show that from 8 to 10 per
cent of the college graduates have a
speech problem. This means that
approximately 100 students with
speech difficulties are admitted to
Stanford every year.
The majority of these students
never come to the attention of the
clinic and go through school and
are graduated with the same prob

Eleven per cent of the students of
