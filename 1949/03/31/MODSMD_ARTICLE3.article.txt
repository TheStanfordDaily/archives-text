# Clinic Helps Cure Speech Defects; Trains Students in Therapy Work
## 
### DICK SEIBEL 
The Stanford Speech Clinic, es- .
tablished in 19:52, is now a thriving !
part of the University program. Its
primary purpose is the treatment of I
students with speech problems. {
However, anyone in the Bay Area j
who needs speech training will be j
accepted.
The clinic, in its 17 years, has !
treated 1.057 individuals for all j
types of speech difficulties. Not all
of these have been members of the

Stanford family; many have been
residents of nearby towns.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson has been
director of the clinic since its be
ginning, and for a number of years
conducted all the clinical work
himself. In 1938 the value of the
clinic as a training laboratory for
students in speech correction was
recognized, and since then most of
the work has been conducted by
students.
The clinic provides a carefully
supervised training for students in
speech correction and in physical
therapy. Dr. Anderson supervises
the clinicians in all their work and
still handles some of the more dif
ficult cases.
Clinicians Trained
Since 1938, when students first
entered as clinicians, 278 persons
have been trained in speech therapy
work by the clinic.
About one-fourth of the 58 pa
tients this quarter are children,
some of faculty members or stu
dents, but most from families in this
area.
The operations of the clinic are
essential to the Stanford family, as
surveys show that from 8 to 10 per
cent of the college graduates have a
speech problem. This means that
approximately 100 students with
speech difficulties are admitted to
Stanford every year.
The majority of these students
never come to the attention of the
clinic and go through school and
are graduated with the same prob
lem.
Eleven per cent of the students of
the education department who ap-
ply for teaching credentials are re
ferred to the clinic as having speech
difficulties that will hinder their
profession. These cases are carefully
considered and if the problem is
serious enough the candidate may j
be advised to attempt another field, i
However, this is extreme. In many
cases the problem may be solved
and the speech defect largely cor
rected.
Cases Successful
The clinic does not achieve 100
per cent success, but has been very
successful with most of the cases.
Evidence of this may be seen in the
fact that 25 per cent of the patients 1
are so well satisfied that they reg
ister with the clinic for more than
one quarter's work.
Up to 1938, only one-half hour a

week could be devoted to each case,
but with the addition of clinicians
two half-hour sessions are now pro
vided. Most of the cases handled
are treated individually, although
one special group now exists fo:
stutterers.
The clinic has a very thorough li
brary on subjects closely related t
the speech work. It also has a large
supply of modern equipment fo:
aiding the treatment of cases.
Records Made
Complete records are kept on
each individual, and many persons
have a recording of their voice
made when they enter the clinic
and another later, after the treat
ment is complete. These recordings
help show the improvement that
person has made during his treat
ment.
Many of the people who come to
the clinic have been seen by their
doctors or have heard of it through
the public schools or from friends
Each case is studied closely be
fore it is assigned to one of the 24
clinicians. Then it is studied fur
ther and an investigation into the
causes of the problem is made. The
psychology department assists i:\
many of these tests.
Tests Given
The patient is given tests o:
hearing, IQ, laterality, motor co
ordination, speech differentiation,
and memory span. These aid ir.
finding the causes and suggest pos
sible methods of treatment. The
discovery of the causes behind the
problem is important in that the
treatment should be of both the
cause and the symptom of the speech,
difficulty.
After the cause of the difficulty
is discovered the next step is to
find the proper treatment. Despite
similarities, each individual must
be handled differently. The choice
of treatment calls for imagination,
ingenuity, and insight on the part
of the clincian.

cent of the college graduates have a
speech problem. This means that
approximately 100 students with
speech difficulties are admitted to
Stanford every year.
The majority of these students
never come to the attention of the
clinic and go through school and
are graduated with the same prob
lem.
Eleven per cent of the students of
the education department who ap-
ply for teaching credentials are re
ferred to the clinic as having speech
difficulties that will hinder their
profession. These cases are carefully
considered and if the problem is
serious enough the candidate may j
be advised to attempt another field, i
However, this is extreme. In many
cases the problem may be solved
and the speech defect largely cor
rected.
Cases Successful
The clinic does not achieve 100
per cent success, but has been very
successful with most of the cases.
Evidence of this may be seen in the
fact that 25 per cent of the patients 1
are so well satisfied that they reg
ister with the clinic for more than
one quarter's work.
Up to 1938, only one-half hour a

week could be devoted to each case,
but with the addition of clinicians
two half-hour sessions are now pro
vided. Most of the cases handled
are treated individually, although
one special group now exists fo:
stutterers.
The clinic has a very thorough li
brary on subjects closely related t
the speech work. It also has a large
supply of modern equipment fo:
aiding the treatment of cases.
Records Made
Complete records are kept on
each individual, and many persons
have a recording of their voice
made when they enter the clinic
and another later, after the treat
ment is complete. These recordings
help show the improvement that
person has made during his treat
ment.
Many of the people who come to
the clinic have been seen by their
doctors or have heard of it through
the public schools or from friends
Each case is studied closely be
fore it is assigned to one of the 24
clinicians. Then it is studied fur
ther and an investigation into the
causes of the problem is made. The
psychology department assists i:\
many of these tests.
Tests Given
The patient is given tests o:
hearing, IQ, laterality, motor co
ordination, speech differentiation,
and memory span. These aid ir.

discovery of the causes behind the
problem is important in that the
treatment should be of both the
cause and the symptom of the speech,

After the cause of the difficulty
is discovered the next step is to

similarities, each individual must
be handled differently. The choice
of treatment calls for imagination,
ingenuity, and insight on the part
of the clincian.

part of the University program. Its
primary purpose is the treatment of I
students with speech problems. {
However, anyone in the Bay Area j

The clinic, in its 17 years, has !
treated 1.057 individuals for all j
types of speech difficulties. Not all
of these have been members of the

Stanford family; many have been
residents of nearby towns.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson has been

Clinicians Trained
Since 1938, when students first
entered as clinicians, 278 persons
have been trained in speech therapy
work by the clinic.
About one-fourth of the 58 pa
tients this quarter are children,
some of faculty members or stu
dents, but most from families in this
area.
The operations of the clinic are
essential to the Stanford family, as
surveys show that from 8 to 10 per
cent of the college graduates have a
speech problem. This means that
approximately 100 students with
speech difficulties are admitted to
Stanford every year.
The majority of these students
never come to the attention of the
