# Asia Shows Constant Changes
## 
### JAMES D. WHITE AP Foreign News Analyst 
(Just returned from a four
month trip to the Far East.)
Worried about Europe? Take a
look at Asia.
The place is alive with change.
! Asiatics are getting more wound up
j in each others' problems.
The big news in Asia is Asia itself.
That is the hungry half of the
| world. Its billion and a quarter peo
ple are reaching for change, or the
nearest facsimile thereof. In some
j cases this is Communism, or what
! passes for Communism.
Such old-time western economists
I as Henry George or John Stuart
Mill would iook just as radical to
most Asiatics.
Changes are taking place.
Around the western rim of the
Pacific — which, incidentally, is
where Soviet and American stra
tegic defense lines coincide — more
than half the human race is intent
on how to make these changes.
To the vast majority of Asiatics,
j such Western ideas as the Atlantic
Pact mean only that the West still is
; primping in its own mirror. So Asia
goes ahead with her own problems,
and falling into revolt, civil war,
political dogfights and deadlocks—
none of which her overcrowded,
underfed people can afford.
Strange things go on.
Indonesians
, The Indonesians are trying to get
; out from under the Dutch. The
Dutch cannot afford to let them go.
There has been fighting, "police ac
tion," the Dutch call it.
At one time Britain backed up
the Dutch, and so did America. The
i Dutch went ahead, regardless of
United Nations advice.
Now, as the Asiatics see it, an odd
thing has happened. India, which
many expected to collapse when
Britain turned her loose, did not do
I so. Instead, her leaders are sound
ing the call of freedom for all Asia.
, and for Indonesia in particular.
The result: The British have too
j big a stake in India to antagonize
Indians about Indonesia. Now the
Dutch no longer have British sup
port, .and America has cut off the
EC A aid for them in Indonesia.
The Dutch are paying more atten
tion to the wishes of the United
Nations, and this is amusing indeed
to Asiatics.
Burma
In Burma the tides of change arc
so confused that you find Christians,
Communists, and Karen Tribesmen
fighting together against the Bur
mese government. Yet that govern
ment already has adopted a land
reform program from the Chinese
Communists more literally than the
Chinese Reds themselves enforce it.
The French are barely holding
their own in Indo-China (behind
one of the world's toughest censor
ships) against Vite-Narnese guer
rillas.
The British are somewhat better
off in Malaya, but recent reports
say they are losing more men in
the jungles than the guerrillas they J
are fighting.
The Philippines
The Philippines are fairly stable, |
but the Hukbalahap Peasant revolt
is far from suppressed. Politically. |
President Elpidio Quirino has trou
ble controlling his own party.
In China, the most sweeping of all
Asiatic revolts has paused halfway.
Having conquered half the country,
the Communists still seem to be
making up their minds about how to
go ifter the other half.
The Russo-American cold war ac
tually slops over into little Korea,
where 30,000.000 people find their
national life constricted by an arti
ficial dividing line.
Japan
Only Japan is calm. Defeated and
occupied, she waits. A revolution
has been imposed upon her.
Until (he American occupation
ends, no one rati say how or
whether this revolution will stick.
Nearly 2,000,000 Japanese were
born in 1048, so Japan's population
problem is at least as pressing as
it was before Pearl Harbor.
