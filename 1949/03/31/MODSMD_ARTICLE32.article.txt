The Story of the Wolf Who Cried "Boy!"
(or .... another one of Aesop's Foibles.)

Once upon a there was a Wolf. This Wolf was a genuine four-bell
Hollywood wolf, complete with Cadillac convertible; Polaroid sun glasses;
and a membership card in the "I'll Take the High Road, You Take the
Low Road, and I'll Get to Mitchum's Before You" Club. Even those two
famous Hollywood columnists, Louella Parsnips and Hedda Cabbage,
agreed that he was a real Wolf.
But that was all in the past. During the last month our Wolf friend
had reformed. No longer was he seen under the best tables at Ciro's.
No longer did the starlets at Warner Brothers have to refuse his invita
tions to go for a ride and watch the airplanes write "Honest John" across
the sky.
All of Hollywood wondered why the one-famous Wolf had suddenly
reformed. Hedda and Louella simultaneously printed "exclusive" stories
saying that the Wolf \fas being treated with new gland injections called
"Sulfadenial" and "Noloveatall." But that wasn't the real story.
The truth was, that after playing bit parts in the movies for five years,
the Wolf had finally gotten a movie role which he liked. Previously he
had played the title role of a wax box in "The Parafin Case" and had
aiso been seen as a hearing aid in "Johnny Belinda."
But finally his big chance arrived. He was picked to portray a shepherd
in a David O. Seltzer production about female sheep called "I'll Be Seeing
Ewe." He was very pleased with his p:ut because one of his duties was
guarding' the sheep. At first he felt a little sheepish about doing this, but
in no time at all he learned to like it.
But then tragedy struck our Wolf. His old-time wolf blood returned
to the surface and he fell in love with his sheep. He began to develop a
habit which caused producer Seltzer to get very mad at him.
The Wolf would be sitting with his sheep during a scene when every
thing was supposed to be quiet; and then suddenly he would cry out
"Boy!"
After this had happened several times, Seltzer warned the Wolf that
if he cried "Boy" just once more he would lose his job.
aNturally the Wolf didn't want to lose his job, so he tried very hard
net to say "Boy." He was doing very well for a few minutes until one
of the girls in his herd of sheep snuggled close to him. trying to pull the
wool over his eyes. The Wolf let out a "Boy" that was heard clear to
the lobby of Graumann's Chinese Theatre.
Seltzer was sorry to have to fire the Wolf, but there was nothing else
he could do. Ho told the actor to le-ave, and so the Wolf took it on the lamb.

and a membership card in the "I'll Take the High Road, You Take the
Low Road, and I'll Get to Mitchum's Before You" Club. Even those two
famous Hollywood columnists, Louella Parsnips and Hedda Cabbage,
agreed that he was a real Wolf.
But that was all in the past. During the last month our Wolf friend
had reformed. No longer was he seen under the best tables at Ciro's.
No longer did the starlets at Warner Brothers have to refuse his invita
tions to go for a ride and watch the airplanes write "Honest John" across
the sky.
All of Hollywood wondered why the one-famous Wolf had suddenly
reformed. Hedda and Louella simultaneously printed "exclusive" stories
saying that the Wolf \fas being treated with new gland injections called
"Sulfadenial" and "Noloveatall." But that wasn't the real story.
The truth was, that after playing bit parts in the movies for five years,
the Wolf had finally gotten a movie role which he liked. Previously he
had played the title role of a wax box in "The Parafin Case" and had
aiso been seen as a hearing aid in "Johnny Belinda."
But finally his big chance arrived. He was picked to portray a shepherd
in a David O. Seltzer production about female sheep called "I'll Be Seeing
Ewe." He was very pleased with his p:ut because one of his duties was
guarding' the sheep. At first he felt a little sheepish about doing this, but
in no time at all he learned to like it.
But then tragedy struck our Wolf. His old-time wolf blood returned
to the surface and he fell in love with his sheep. He began to develop a
habit which caused producer Seltzer to get very mad at him.
The Wolf would be sitting with his sheep during a scene when every
thing was supposed to be quiet; and then suddenly he would cry out
"Boy!"
After this had happened several times, Seltzer warned the Wolf that
if he cried "Boy" just once more he would lose his job.
aNturally the Wolf didn't want to lose his job, so he tried very hard
net to say "Boy." He was doing very well for a few minutes until one
of the girls in his herd of sheep snuggled close to him. trying to pull the
wool over his eyes. The Wolf let out a "Boy" that was heard clear to
the lobby of Graumann's Chinese Theatre.
Seltzer was sorry to have to fire the Wolf, but there was nothing else
he could do. Ho told the actor to le-ave, and so the Wolf took it on the lamb.

Once upon a there was a Wolf. This Wolf was a genuine four-bell
Hollywood wolf, complete with Cadillac convertible; Polaroid sun glasses;
and a membership card in the "I'll Take the High Road, You Take the
Low Road, and I'll Get to Mitchum's Before You" Club. Even those two
