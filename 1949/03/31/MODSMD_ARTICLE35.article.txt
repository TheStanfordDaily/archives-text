## 
### 
One of the most shocking and-*
bold-faced crimes ever committed
vin tiie Stanford campus was wit
nessed yesterday afternoon in the
Cellar by several score coflee
drinkers.
A shrill shriek of fright from
co-ed Skippy Brand, who was in
ihe Cellar, first announced the
presence of a rough, unshaven giant
of a man dressed in beret and
striped T-shirt.
With a gleam in his bloodshot
eyes, he quickly made a grab for ,
Miss Brand, and after a short strug
gle, dragged her from the Cellar.
This man, Roy Wright, boy an- 1
thropoid of Theta Xi, was dressed
more for the Montmartre than Quad.
Operating more in accord with the
"Fundamental Drives" than the
Fundamental Standard, he had
broken under the strain of the Stan
ford' boy-girl ratio and made sure
of his date to the Theta Xi Apache
Dance this Saturday.
The kidnaping had little effect on
one of the upper class girls watching
the scene.
Miss Brand's only comment was,
"But I already have a date."
