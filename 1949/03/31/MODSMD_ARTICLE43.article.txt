# Freshman Tracksters Open Season Here Saturday Morn
## 
### 
Stanford s freshman speedsters, handicapped by a week's
layoff during the between-quarters lull, will open the 1949 sea
son at Angell Field at 10 o'clock Saturday morning in a three
way meet against Modesto JC and Hartnell of Salinas.
I* rosh mentor Ray Dean emphasized that, because of the one-

week lapse in the yearlings' train
ing, he is not expecting particularly
good times or distances in Satur
day's first outing; but the neophyte
squad is not lacking in bright pros
pects for future competition.
Two Dash Men
Heading the list of outstanding
frosh performers is Pete Sanford,
sprinter from Long Island. New
York, whose best time so far is 21.5
in the 220. Pete will also compete

in the 100 - yard dash along with
gridder Wilbur Taylor.
John Wooley, a miler from John
Marshall High School in Los An-
Kcles, will flash the form that List
year netted him a time of 4:29.1
and the California state champion
ship in the mile run, John will be
Dean's only entry in the mile.
Another former prep headliner,
quarter - miler Wally McCamant,
heads the list of four Card 440 spe
cialists who will see action Satur
day. Wally racked up a 50.5 quar
ter last season to place second in
the Oregon state meet. He'll be
ioined by Ken Payson, Nelson Ju
dah. and Stan Dawson in that event
Saturday.
Hokanson Looks Good
Dean also has hiph hopes for shot
putter Charlie Hokanson, a burly
lad from Richmond who has tossed
the shot 45 feet in practice. Charlie
will also be pitching the discus for
the Deanmen, as will Frank Brad
ley.
Herb Cohen will shoulder the en
tire burden in the half-mile, and
Bob Berry will do a solo for the
Indians in the two-mile.
The high-hurdle event will find
the Cardbabes with a packed house.
Bill Storum, Paul Warner, Dean
Stewart, and Allan Scott will all
display their wares in this one.
In the low hurdles, it'll probably
be Storum and Jim Pollock carry
ing the Cardinal banner.
Reaching for the sky will be Ron
nie Allen and Clyde Taylor in the'
hiyh jump, and Dick Horn in the
pole vault.
Rod Lippold, Dan Evans, and Earl
Jones will all compete in the broad
jump, wilh Lippold and Evans do
ing a repeat in the javelin throw.
Ken Norris will also perform in the
latter event.
