## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Riding high c\ff a 7 to 3 CIBA victory over St. Mary's and a
lopsided 21 to 1 non-conference decision over USF, California's
Golden Bears will invade the Sunken Diamond Saturday after
noon for the 167 th playing of the Stanford-Cal "Big Game."
It will undoubtedly be fireballing Jackie Jensen on the mound

for Clint Evans' BeaY nine as the*
men in blue and gold attempt to
'maintain their baseball jinx over j
the Indians that through the years
has given them 116 wins over Slan- I
ford as against 50 losses.
Jensen, who didn't pitch last year
because of scholastic difficulties, is !
the ace oi' the Cal mound corps; but
he lias dependable Dave Anderson. |
a sophomore righthander, and
Whimpy Jones behind him in case
he runs into trouble.
In the field the Bears lost live
veterans via the graduation route,
but indications are that Coach Clint
Evans has come up with another
well-rounded ball club.
The Indians dropped their third
straight game Tuesday night, and
in doing so looked anything but
ready to lace the talent-heavy
Bears.
The Cards were slow of foot and
dull of mind as they committed lour
m is c u e s afield, and numerous
"skulls" while at bat in losing to
the College of the Pacific, 5 to 4.
Pitcher Stan McWilliams pushed
across the winning run with an 11th
inning squeeze bunt. The Tigers I
had previously tied it up with a ]
squeeze play in the ninth.
In the last of the 11th, Card short- 1
stop Dave Melton lost Wally Die- I
trich's high pop fly in the lights. |
and when he finally picked the ball
up off the ground. Dietrich was !
standing on second. A sacrifice 1
moved him to third and McWil- >
Jiams squeezed him home.
The Cards outhit the victors S j

blows to 5, but many of Stanford's
hits were of the two out and none
on variety.
The Indians are still showing the
effects of their long weather-forced
February layoff. Pitchers Dave
Stott and Dave Dahle pitched tight
ball, but they didn t get too much
support.

FRED FANK, Card I)road jump
er, broke his own previous he*t
mark last Saturday in the Cal-
S tail ford Relays when he jumped
22 feet 11 inches.
Riding high c\ff a 7 to 3 CIBA victory over St. Mary's and a
lopsided 21 to 1 non-conference decision over USF, California's
Golden Bears will invade the Sunken Diamond Saturday after
noon for the 167 th playing of the Stanford-Cal "Big Game."
It will undoubtedly be fireballing Jackie Jensen on the mound

for Clint Evans' BeaY nine as the*
men in blue and gold attempt to
'maintain their baseball jinx over j
the Indians that through the years
has given them 116 wins over Slan- I
ford as against 50 losses.
Jensen, who didn't pitch last year
because of scholastic difficulties, is !
the ace oi' the Cal mound corps; but
he lias dependable Dave Anderson. |
a sophomore righthander, and
Whimpy Jones behind him in case
he runs into trouble.
In the field the Bears lost live
veterans via the graduation route,
but indications are that Coach Clint
Evans has come up with another
well-rounded ball club.
The Indians dropped their third
straight game Tuesday night, and
in doing so looked anything but
ready to lace the talent-heavy
Bears.
The Cards were slow of foot and
dull of mind as they committed lour
m is c u e s afield, and numerous
"skulls" while at bat in losing to
the College of the Pacific, 5 to 4.
Pitcher Stan McWilliams pushed
across the winning run with an 11th
inning squeeze bunt. The Tigers I
had previously tied it up with a ]
squeeze play in the ninth.
In the last of the 11th, Card short- 1
stop Dave Melton lost Wally Die- I
trich's high pop fly in the lights. |
and when he finally picked the ball
up off the ground. Dietrich was !
standing on second. A sacrifice 1
moved him to third and McWil- >
Jiams squeezed him home.
The Cards outhit the victors S j

blows to 5, but many of Stanford's
hits were of the two out and none
on variety.
The Indians are still showing the
effects of their long weather-forced
February layoff. Pitchers Dave
Stott and Dave Dahle pitched tight
ball, but they didn t get too much
support.
