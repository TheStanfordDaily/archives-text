SACRAMENTO. March 30 (/Pi.—
Sacramento Solons hammered out
10 hits off two Oakland hurlers to
capture their Pacific Coast League
inaugural 5 to 2 here today. An
overflow crowd oi 12.202 jammed
the new Solcn ball park. Joe Marty
drove in four Sacramento tallies,
three of them with a 390-foot homer.
Solon batsmen showed little re
spect for the Oaks' starter, south
pay Charley Gassaway. They
nicked him for hits in four of the
five frames he worked before Oak
Manager Chuck Dressen waved Mat
Zidich in from the bullpen.
Sacramento fashioned its win in a
four-run fifth inning. Catcher Frank
Kerr walked, went to second on
Salvo's sacrifice, to third on short
stop Bill Wietelman's single, and
scored on A 1 White's long fly. Joe
Grace then singled putting two on
and Marty came up to blast his
round-tripper.
Oakland 0(H) 001 010—2 7 0
Sacramento 100 040 OOx—s 10 2
