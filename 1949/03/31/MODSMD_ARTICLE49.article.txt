# Tanksters Lose Services of Sala
## 
### 
Tom Haynie and the Stanford
swimming team are today facing the
grim prospect of meeting a top
flight College of Pacific tank crew
; without the services of crack 440'-
man Ralph Sala. Sala has just been
| proclaimed scho'astically ineligible,
! due to one incomplete in last quar
! ter's work.
! Saturday's doings, scheduled to
; start at 10 a.m., include in addition
to the COP vs. the varsity, a three-
S way meet between the Stanford
t frosh, Stockton JC. and Modesto JC.
| "There'll lie a lot gomtÂ» on all the
time," Coach Haynie reported, "and
| there'll be some awfully swiim
j mers competing."
With Sala out, the varsity rates
, alxiut even with COP. and Stockton
JC is a clean-cut favorite to take
I the three-way meet, with the Pap- ;
i ooses pulling a second.
If the varsity does not set by |
COP it will be the first dual meet '
that they have lost in three years. 1
! That is why Mr. Haynie is not in his
usual optimistic spirit today.
