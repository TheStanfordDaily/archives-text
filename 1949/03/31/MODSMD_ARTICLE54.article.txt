# U.S. Navy Recruits Women Officers
## 
### 
"The Navy wants you."
This time, however, the con
science-piercing stare and accusing
finger of Uncle Sam is directed at
ail unmarried women members of
the senior class who are seeking a
possible career as an officer in the
United States Navy.
For the first time in the history
of the U.S. Navy women are being
offered the opportunity for a career
as an officer. They will have the
same privileges and draw the same
pay and allowances as do the male
officers.
Further information about this
new program can be obtained Fri
day when Lt. Mary Brims, USN,
will talk with all those interested
at 4 p.m. in room 78 of Cubberley
Hall.
