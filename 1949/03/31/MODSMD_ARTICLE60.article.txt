# Stanford Titles Must Pass Excom
## 
### 
It is illegal for student groups and
urbanizations to use the name of
Stanford, or any other name desig
nating the University, unless they
have first obtained permission from
Excom, a by-law passed by Excom
at the last meeting of winter quar
ter stated.
The by-law was designed to pro
tect those organizations which have
already gone through the formal
recognition process provided for by
the ASSU Constitution.
The provision also prohibits stu
dents from being members of or
ganizations, composed partly of
non-students, that use the name of
Stanford without permission from
the Administration.
Penalties for violators of this by
law range from suspension of not
more than one quarter to a fine of
not more than $25 or not more than
50 hours' work at the Convalescent
Home.
