# Congress Extends Rent Controls for 15 Months
## Strengthened Bill Allows Crackdown On Rent Black Market, Truman Says 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (AP). — President Truman today
forecast a crackdown on a "black market in rents" as he signed
the new "home rule" measure extending rent controls 15 months
longer.
Although it is not as strong as he had asked, Mr. Truman said

passage of the act was a "crushing
defeat ior the real estate lobby."
The President signed the bill into
law only a day before the old rent
law was due to expire. Congress
only yesterday had approved tht
extension after weeks of bitter de
bate.
In a statement issued after the
brief signing ceremony at the White
House, Mr. Truman picked out spe
cific provisions which he said
"strengthen rent controls."
Major Points
These are the major ones he
cited:
1. Authorizing the federal hous
ing expediter to regulate evictions,
making it "possible" to curb a
i "black market" in rents.
2. Empowering the U.S. rent bos?
| lo sue landlords for treble damages
on the tenant's behalf in case of i
rent overcharge.
3. Eliminating the
procedure permitting so-called vol
untary leases with rent increases up
to 15 per cent." The president sak
this removed the "possibility of co
ercion by landlords to make tenant>
sign such leases in the future."
"This act," he said, "is the result
of the joint efforts of the Congress
and the administraton to find an
equitable solution for a difficult
problem."
Mr. Truman went on to say that
"while affording more effective pro
tection to tenants against illegal or
unjustified increases, the act also
facilitates the making of adjust
ments necessary to correct injus
tices against landlords."
Aids Small landlords
He said the provision to give
! owners a "fair net operating in
j come" will be particularly "help
ful" to small landlords who may not
be getting an "adequate" return or.
I their investment.
Although many Congress mem
bers objected to this section as be
ing too vague. Mr. Truman said it
"does not create an administrative
ly unworkable standard of 'fair re
turn' nor does it mean a general
increase for all tenants."
"Rather," he said, "it provides an
equitable standard for adjustments
i where they are needed."
Exact operations of this section

Rent Expediter lighe E. Woods is

WASHINGTON, March 30 (AP). — President Truman today
forecast a crackdown on a "black market in rents" as he signed
the new "home rule" measure extending rent controls 15 months
longer.
Although it is not as strong as he had asked, Mr. Truman said

passage of the act was a "crushing
defeat ior the real estate lobby."
The President signed the bill into
law only a day before the old rent
law was due to expire. Congress
only yesterday had approved tht
extension after weeks of bitter de
bate.
In a statement issued after the
brief signing ceremony at the White
House, Mr. Truman picked out spe
cific provisions which he said
"strengthen rent controls."
Major Points
These are the major ones he
cited:
1. Authorizing the federal hous
ing expediter to regulate evictions,
making it "possible" to curb a
i "black market" in rents.
2. Empowering the U.S. rent bos?
| lo sue landlords for treble damages
on the tenant's behalf in case of i
rent overcharge.
3. Eliminating the
procedure permitting so-called vol
untary leases with rent increases up
to 15 per cent." The president sak
this removed the "possibility of co
ercion by landlords to make tenant>
sign such leases in the future."
"This act," he said, "is the result
of the joint efforts of the Congress
and the administraton to find an
equitable solution for a difficult
problem."
Mr. Truman went on to say that
"while affording more effective pro
tection to tenants against illegal or
unjustified increases, the act also
facilitates the making of adjust
ments necessary to correct injus
tices against landlords."
Aids Small landlords
He said the provision to give
! owners a "fair net operating in
j come" will be particularly "help
ful" to small landlords who may not
be getting an "adequate" return or.
I their investment.
