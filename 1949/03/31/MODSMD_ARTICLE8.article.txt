# Excom Grants Debaters $200
## 
### 
An appropriation of up to $200
was made to the Stanford Debate
Society at Excom meeting last night
in order for a team to represent
Stanford at the National Intercolle
giate Debate Championships at
West Point.
Contributions from alumni and
from the University are expected to
meet the rest of the estimated $1,000
cost.
The trip is outside of the regular
Debate Society budget in so far as
the intercollegiate championships
are held on an invitational basis.
Election Dates
In other business last night, Ex
com tentatively approved the dates
for the regular spring quarter elec
tions. If there is no conflict with
the proposed Constitution change,
the primary election will be held on
May 4 and the finals one week later
on the 11th.
Election Board Chairman John
Marin stated that letters explain
ing electioneering regulations and
expense accounts will be sent to all
candidates by Election Board prior
to the election.
Voting Regulations
Marin also said that student po
lice will be used to restrict the
vote - counting area to authorized
persons, and ASSU President Gus

tivities of the Honor Code Commit
tee during the past year.
