A SOPHOMORE SPONSORED picnic and barn dance at Rossotti's this afternoon will help finance the
struggling Stanford Crew on its travels this season. Crew neophytes are pictured abo\e "citing their initial
workout on a training barge. Because equipment is scarce, regular crew members are often forced to take
the barge when the shells are full. Crew funds come out of the treasury of the Stanford Crew Association,
made up of the crewmen themselves. Much of the crew equipment has been financed by student and alumni
groups. â€” San Francisco Chronicle photo
