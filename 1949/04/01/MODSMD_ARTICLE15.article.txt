## 
### 
BOSTON, March 31 (.-P).—Win
ston Churchill said tonight only the
atomic bomb in United States hands
had stopped Communists from
overrunning Europe and bombing
London.
Some of the scientists who helped
develop the atom bomb, as well as
diplomats of several nations, were
part of a distinguished crowd of
13.900 which heard the 74-year-old
British statesman speak at a mid
century convocation of t\ie Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
He bluntly accused "the 13 men
in the Kremlin" of "aiming at the
rule of the world."
He charged they "fear the friend
ship of the West more than its hos
tility."
But. he held out this hope:
"War is not inevitable."
Churchill sounded this warning:
"I must not conceal from you the
truth as I see it. It is certain that
Europe would have been Commu
nized and London under bombard
ment some time ago but for the de
terrent of the atomic bomb in the
hands of the United States.
Three times Churchill struck out
at the '"13 men in the Kremlin,"
but at the very outset he main
tained. "I remain an optimist."
Chants of "Send that bundle back
to Britain" greeted Britain's war
time premier as he was escorted
into Boston Garden.
