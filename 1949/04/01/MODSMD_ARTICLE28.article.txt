## Milk Bill Racket 
### 
Last week the dairy and bottle manufacturers' lobby in Sacra
mento won a profitable victory when a bill to exempt fraternities
from the state milk container law was tabled.
The law rules that milk consumed in public places catering
to the public must be served in individual containers for each
consumer. Milk cannot be poured from the more economical
five-gallon cans.
For restaurants that do cater to the public for a profit, the law
is a good one. But when the same legislation is applied to non
profit dormitories and fraternities, in particular, the lobby-spon
sored law is nothing but a racket.
A very large California dairy company backed the bill. But
the dairy doing most of its business with Stanford houses has
been opposed to the measure. The legislation means this to
campus dorms and fraternities:
1. Extra refrigeration amounting to thousands of dollars must
be purchased, installed, and maintained. In some cases, extra
building had to be added to existing plant space.
2. Milk costs will be as much as 280 per cent higher with
individual containers than with milk bought in five-gallon cans.
3. The individual container method of serving milk is more
likely to induce the spread of germs than the bulk method. In
handling the half-pint milk bottles, hashers grasp the top of the
botiles where milk flows over into the drinking glasses. In the
five-gallon can method, however, sanitary lids prevent human
hands from touching any area covered by the milk as it is
poured into drinking glasses.
4. Dairies can raise bottled milk half a cent without drawing
much public criticism. With large containers, however, a 10
or 15-cent boost—though more economical in the long run than
bottled milk— would be more noticeable to the public.' Inci
dentally, the dairies control the price of milk bottled in small
containers.
While the milk container law involves off campus politics,
we students—especially the fraternity men—can best air their
opinions by writing to their California legislators. We advise
you to address personal, not form, letters to your representatives.
Fight the dairy racket by making your opinions known to Cali
fornia assemblymen. Tell them, as Stanford Health Officer
George Luckett has suggested, that fraternities are not serving
1o the public. Such an amendment would solve the entire prob
lem.
