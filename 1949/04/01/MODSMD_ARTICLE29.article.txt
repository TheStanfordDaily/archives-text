## Bull Session

Before your loving roommate crosses you up by telling you that all of
today's classes have been called off, let me remind you that today is April
Fool's Day.
Any practical joke that might be pulled oft' today would have to go
quite a way to top a premature April Fool gag pulled several weeks ago
at one of the local tongs.
One of the brothers who had been out downing a few beers came back
to the house and drunkenly informed the fellow who slept below him on
the sleeping porch that he had spent the whole evening drinking rye. He
added that he was feeling none too good.
Then, after waiting until the unsuspecting brother had gotten into his
suck, our friend took an ordinary deck of playing cards and staggered
out to his upper bunk.
After several minutes of tossing, moaning, and otherwise sounding sick,
the joker fanned out a half-dozen cards in his hand, made a nauseous
belch, cUid let the cards fall to the wooden floor below. If you've ever
heard six or seven playing cards hitting a wooden floor, you can imagine
what the lower bunk occupant thought was coming down on him, espe
cially after all the previous moaning and groaning.
Cursing and shouting ' Migosh! Don't get that stuff all over my sack,
etc.." lie carried on for about .'»0 seconds, while the rest of the brothers on
the porch, who were all in on the gag, rolled in the aisles.
What the lower bunk man said when he discovered that "that stuff"
was a deck of cards would have made Truman's and Drew Pearson's
messages to each other sound like the Lord's Prayer.

Speaking of fraternities, I had a letter the other day from a former
Stanford buddy who transferred to tho University of Oregon when he
discovered he had webbed feet.
Towards the end of last quarter his Oregon fraternity, which is the
largest on the Eugene campus, was holding, with difficulties, its formal
ii itiatioiT. The difficulties were being provided by one of the pledges who
couldn't quite see the seriousness of the initiation ceremony. Several of
his mirtor wisecracks were overlooked by the actives, but the boys were
;i little peeved when he came out with the following goodie.
Standing before the entire house, he was asked by a non-smiling alumns
e.vminer:
"Now that you have lived here in the house for a few months, what
do you think of this fraternity?"
Without hesitating, the pledge quipped "To tell you the truth. I think
you boys have got a real nice little eating club here!"
