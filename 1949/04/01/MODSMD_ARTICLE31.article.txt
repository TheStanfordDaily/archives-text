### PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
Holy Week is, for Christians, the
most sacred period of the year. It
celebrates the crucifixion of Jesus, '■
the central and most distinguishing
act in our religion, because of what
it implies as to the nature and atti
tude of God.
And it follows that with a cele
bration of the Resurrection of Christ,
which is not only a competently
attested historic fact, but also a
demonstration of God's governance
of life's experiences — of which
death is an incident.
Easter Day concerns itself not
alone with the idea of the immor
tality of man, but brushes past that
to center on the qualities of the
personality which grow into the ex
perience of Eternal Life.
Here in Stanford we expect to ob
serve this season properly. The
Palm Sunday Morning Service,
April 20, will introduce it, bearing
the note of Jesus' personal triumph.
Then, each day of the following
week there will be a service in the
Church. These will occur at 4:15
p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday.
The usual Candlelight Service
held on Wednesdays will be omitted
in favor of the Vesper Service on
that day.
Thursday is Maundy Thursday,
April 14, so called because of Christ's
command issued to His disciples:
"I command that ye love one an
other."
It is the day on which the Lord's
Slipper was inaugurated. In our
Memorial Church we will have an
hour of beautiful sacred music fur
nished by the University Choir, be
ginning at 7:30 p.m., following which
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper
will be offered for all who wish to
partake.
Good Friday, April 15—otherwise
called "Black Friday," because it
was on that day that the crucifixion
took place—is "good" because of
what was achieved on Calvary.
It is the custom in liturgical
Christian Churches to hold a three
hour Good Friday Service, observ
ing the period during which Christ
was actually on the cross. The
"Seven Last Words" He uttered from
that eminence are remembered,
with appropriate meditations.
In our Church there will be such
a three-hour service, with the chap
lains assisted by some of the min
isters from the community. This
service will be spaced at half-hour
intervals, so that worshippers may
come and go as necessity requires.
On Easter Day. April 17, there will
be two major services on the cam
pus. One will begin at 8:30 a.m. in
Frost Amphitheater, and will be
broadcast on a national hook-up for
the first 30 minutes.
University Choir and Singers, to
gether with the Brass Choir, will
furnish the music, Dr. Wallace
Sterling, our new president, will
greet us, and I will preach the ser
mon. At 11 o'clock, in the Church,
the second Easter service will be
held.
I hope that all Stanford .students
and faculty will make note of these
opportunities, and prepare to par
ticipate in them as far as is possible.

the note of Jesus' personal triumph.
Then, each day of the following
week there will be a service in the
Church. These will occur at 4:15
p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday.
The usual Candlelight Service
held on Wednesdays will be omitted
in favor of the Vesper Service on
that day.
Thursday is Maundy Thursday,
April 14, so called because of Christ's
command issued to His disciples:
"I command that ye love one an
other."
It is the day on which the Lord's
Slipper was inaugurated. In our
Memorial Church we will have an
hour of beautiful sacred music fur
nished by the University Choir, be
ginning at 7:30 p.m., following which
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper
will be offered for all who wish to
partake.
Good Friday, April 15—otherwise
called "Black Friday," because it
was on that day that the crucifixion
took place—is "good" because of
what was achieved on Calvary.
It is the custom in liturgical
Christian Churches to hold a three
hour Good Friday Service, observ
ing the period during which Christ
was actually on the cross. The
"Seven Last Words" He uttered from
that eminence are remembered,
with appropriate meditations.
In our Church there will be such
a three-hour service, with the chap
lains assisted by some of the min
isters from the community. This
service will be spaced at half-hour
intervals, so that worshippers may
come and go as necessity requires.
On Easter Day. April 17, there will
be two major services on the cam
pus. One will begin at 8:30 a.m. in
Frost Amphitheater, and will be
broadcast on a national hook-up for
the first 30 minutes.
University Choir and Singers, to
gether with the Brass Choir, will
furnish the music, Dr. Wallace
Sterling, our new president, will
greet us, and I will preach the ser
mon. At 11 o'clock, in the Church,
the second Easter service will be
held.
I hope that all Stanford .students
and faculty will make note of these
opportunities, and prepare to par
ticipate in them as far as is possible.
Holy Week is, for Christians, the
most sacred period of the year. It
celebrates the crucifixion of Jesus, '■
the central and most distinguishing
act in our religion, because of what
it implies as to the nature and atti
tude of God.
And it follows that with a cele
bration of the Resurrection of Christ,
which is not only a competently
attested historic fact, but also a
demonstration of God's governance
of life's experiences — of which
death is an incident.
Easter Day concerns itself not
alone with the idea of the immor
tality of man, but brushes past that
to center on the qualities of the
personality which grow into the ex
perience of Eternal Life.
Here in Stanford we expect to ob
serve this season properly. The
Palm Sunday Morning Service,
April 20, will introduce it, bearing
the note of Jesus' personal triumph.
