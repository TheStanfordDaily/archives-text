I To the Editor:
I have enclosed a clipping which I took from the New York Times of
March 23. I thought you might like to comment on it in the Stanford
Daily because I think there is a need at Stanford for the particular idt\
it represents.
I have often felt we should have some measure of student censure to
eliminate certain faculty members who continually fail to stimulate interest
or who provoke contempt among large numbers of students. As can be
| seen from the article, it would also serve to assure that due credit is
; given to those who truly inspire students with their genuine interest in
teaching as well as their pedagogical abilities.
As Dr. Woodburne of the University of Michigan stated, "If the student
is the object of all this teaching, then he should have something to
| Sc«y about it."

(Special to The New York Times)
ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 22—
The University of Michigan granted
to its students today sweeping crit
ical powers over the caliber of its
faculty.
On the basis of the first report in
a continuing' survey of the faculty
members of the College of Litera
ture, Science, and The Arts by 11.000
students, the university ranked
carefully measured student opinion
roughly on a par with that of de
partment heads in evaluating the
faculty.
The announcement describing
what was said to he the first such
step ever taken by an American
university as a part of top-level
policy was presented orally by Dr.
Lloyd S. Woodburne, Dean of the
college.
The initial survey, made in secret
questionnaire form last December,
polled student opinion regarding the
members of the teaching staff.
Dr. Woodburne said that the 11,000
students, each taking an average of
about four and one-half courses,
submitted more than 50,000 ques
tionnaires covering 410 faculty mem
bers in a total of 1,200 courses.
The test will be repeated during
the second semester in a equal num
ber of courses.
Assuming four points represented
theoretical perfection, Dr. Wood
burne said, the students gave an
average of three and seven-tenths
points to 43 faculty members in 19
departments. These they listed as
"very superior."
Five members were rated at less

than 2.5 points, or "very poor." In
these instances, Dr. Wooburne said,
student judgment was nearly iden
tical with the opinion of the respec
tive department heads, and steps al
ready were being taken either to re
move the "very poor" from the fac
ulty or to reassign them.
The students were asked to rate
their instructors on 10 points, in
cluding the difficulty of the course,
clarity and thoroughness of pre
sentation of subject matter, gen
eral approachahility, ability to
arouse interest and stimulate
thinking, and, "considering every
thing—general teaching effective
ness."
In addition, space was provided
for additional remarks. Here, Dr.
Woodburne said, some were "posi
tively damning."
The faculty-approved device, Dr.
Woodburne said, had already proven
so helpful that it would be continued
for at least five years and, probably,
permanently.
He said that while in theory and
after proper evaluation of the ac
curacy of the results of the tests stu
dents might be in the position to
"flunk" their teachers, it would be
more likely that in most cases
changes would be limited to reas
signinents.
"It is hard to determine what the
validity of this instrument is," Dr.
Woodburne said, "but because it is
difficult is no reason why we should
not try to raise it to its maximum
usefulness. If the student is the ob
ject of all this teaching, then he
should have something to say about
it."
