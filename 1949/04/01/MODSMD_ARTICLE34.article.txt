It doesn't seem to matter whether j
it's alcoholic chemistry or co-ed
psychology nowadays that you want
to take up, there is a trade school |
for it somewhere.
Our institutions of higher learn
ing continue in ever-increasing
numbers to covcr greener pastures
in the types of courses offered. Now, 1
for instance, if you are a female who j
hasn't had much success in alluring
the serious intent on the part of a i
firSt-class male, you go to school
and take a course called Marriage
and Family at New York University.
Evr-n the story about the birds
and the bees has been taken out of
the hands of the parents. Now all is j
told quite candidly in a course called j
Problems of Marriage (open only to I
juniors and seniors) at the State j
College of Washington. Both courses j
have to offer points on "Current |
modes of courtship and mate find- j
ing."
Either that, or go have a woman- j
to-woman chat with Arline Judge, |
36, the original Wampas baby j
movie star of the early thirties. For- j
mer wife of a movie director, an air- i
plane pilot, an advertising man, and j
two millionaires, she has just mar- |
lied her sixth husband, an insur- I
ance man.
I noticed the other day that Bay- ]
lor University is offering a course j
in radio gag writing now. Also some
schools are starting cartooning and j
caricature courses in their art de- j
partments.
Tn London, England, even cabbies
have to go to school. But it isn't
to get the Bronx twang out of their '
voices. They have to complete a j
stiff six-month course in automotive j
mechanics, business training, and all |
points in between. The school they |
attend is even called The Cabmen's
College.
Probably a more interesting class j
to dig into would be the one on !
beer drawing. Yes. you actually j

| learn to draw a glass of beer in
| this course—but of course you draw
| it from a tap. You see, this class
) consists of students from a local bar
j tender's school in New York, with
j even some Gls studying there under
i the GI Bill. It's one place you learn
j to be fast on the draw.
The prof is 55-year-old Ilal Hoff-
I man, the dean of American beer
j drawers. His formula for drawing
j a beer that will melt in your mouth
I is:
"Pull the faucet down fast. If
j you throttle it, you get too much
I foam. But it ought to have a col
-1 lar of foam, say about an inch. It
I should leave a ring on the glass
j every time the customer takes a sip.
J And always wash the glasses in
i water, not soap, because soap kills
j this head.
I "And don't dry the glasses. Use
j them wet. A dry glass forms bub
j blcs on the side, and many cus
tomers will, when they burp, say the
' bubbles carried gas in them."
But don't get the idea that all is
| sport at the school. They're very
J strict. Why one of the students
! passed out in class the other day
; and they propped him up until the
I lecture ended.
| My buddy got home all right after
; the lecture, except that just as he
was turning into the home stretch
] some darn fool stepped on his fin-
I g'ers.
In Chicago there is a school for
clowns even. The principal is plump
! Mrs. Rose Wepner, and her assistant
| is her daughter, Lenore, who has a
i blonde head full of gags. Say they:
"Clowning is serious business."
Incongruous statement, you say?
Well, it's paying off. Grads from t!v
' school are in night clubs, theaters,
circuses.
Women are barred from the
school. Why? For the simple rea
| son that the proprietors "don't think
i women are funny." I la. They shouU'
, have seen the one I was out with
! last night.
