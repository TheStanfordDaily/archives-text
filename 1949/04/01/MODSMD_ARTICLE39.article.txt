# 'Straw Hat' Sets Drawn by Corka
## 
### 
"Cartoonist turns theatrical sot
designer, draws rave notices on
first attempt."
This Hollywood-like theme is the
actual story behind the sets for "Out
of Order." the latest Straw Hat Re
vue. now showing at the Marines
Memorial Theater in San Francisco.
John and Zona Cornin, whose
cartoons appear under the name of
"Corka" in many of the nation's top
publications, are the cartoonists who
have stepped in to design the sets
ior "Out of Order."
The last two performances of this
musical will be given tonight and
tomorrow.
