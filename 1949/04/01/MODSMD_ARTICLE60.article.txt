WASHINGTON, March 31.â€”Pres
ident Truman spoke out today
against a Repub'ican-Ied drive to
cut millions if not billions of dollars
off the flow of American aid to
Europe.
But administration leaders in the
Senate, where the issue was being
debated, conceded that sizable re
ductions may be warranted in 1950
if the Marshall Plan nations get
"'over the hump" this year. Origi
nally a 1'our-year plan, the Marshall
program is scheduled to extend into
mid-1952.
