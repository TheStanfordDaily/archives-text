WASHINGTON. Mach 31-Infla
tion is still a threat President Tru
man contended today as he tailed
anew for standby economic control
powers and a big boost in taxes.
He told a news conference that
the recent price declines are only a
temporary let-up in the inflationary
pressures. He said one factor in
checking the upward spiral has been
his olt-repeated request for author
ity to apply federal curbs when

needed.
As for taxes, the President said
he does not agree with a contention
by Senator George (D-Ga.) that an
increase at this time might set off
a depression.
It would be much more dangerous
to the nation's economy, Mr. Tru
man said, i'or the government to run
up a deficit than to boost taxes.
