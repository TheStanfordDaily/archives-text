# Semanticists Arise! Frantic Early-Morning Commuters Need a New, All-Purpose Word
## 
### TREV BURROW 
Students who commute by train
to Stanford lrom points north need
the immediate services ol all Eng
lish majors and semanticists. A new
word must be coined. A word sim
ilar in purpose to the forceful, but
restricted in meaning, "track,"
"fore," "geronimo," or gangway."
None of these will do as the new
word must have several meanings
and must be immediately clear un
der any circumstances. The word
should be short and expressive, but
preferably not profane. It will be
used by commuting students to re
move obstacles to their speed, to
protect early-morning strollers, and
to soothe irate professors.
Depending upon the occasion and
the listener, the word should de
note. "Gad, it's one minute to eight
and we're still in Menlo"; "Please, a
ride to History corner, quick";
"Look out. here comes the off-cam
pus track team"; or '"Sorry, Doc,
the tiain was late again."
The need lor the word began
early last quartre when Southern
Pacific changed its morning train
schedules to "help" Stanford com
muters. Students living in San
Francisco had been getting up at 5
a.m., catching a 6 o'clock train, ar
riving in Palo Alto about 7. and
then spending a dreary hour on
campus before classes began. A
second train left the city at 7.
but arrived after 8 o'clock classes
started.
Change Initiated
Dick Alberton, student in the law
school, approached University and
Southern Pacific officials in an at
tempt to rectify the situation. It
took him a full quarter to convince
the necessary persons that the loss
of sleep and time was not an aid
to students seeking knowledge. Fi
nally, in January, Alberton's argu
ments took effect. The train which
had been leaving San Francisco at
7 was re-scheduled to leave 10 min
utes earlier. In theory, this train
was to arrive at Palo Alto at 7:52,
allowing eiqht minutes for the stu
dents to get from the station to
c 1 ass.
The new schedule was just initi
ated. however, when forces beyond
the impact of Alberton's arguments
intervened.
San Francisco discontinued a
.streetcar service between the city
and San Mateo. This left some t>00
Burlingame high school students,
who had been using the streetcar,
without transportation between their
homes and school. The students,
who live in scattered localities be
tween San Francisco and Burlin
game, arranged to take the train.
Delay in Burlingame
Unfortunately for the train sched
ule. several hundred high school
.students getting on and off the train
delay its southward progress con
siderably. Ey the time the train
leaves Burlingame, the gained 10
minutes, and generally a few more,
have been lost.
Train company officials have add
ed extra cars and personnel to the
train, hut have been unable to make
it run on time (even Mussolini
would have had trouble speeding
up this train). The high school stu
dents get to Burlingame some 30
or -10 minutes before their classes
start, and are usually in little mood
to be rushed while boarding or get
ting off from the train.
With their natural dignity, care
fully correct dress, propensity for
love (one can't hurry the one with
whom one is holding hands, can
one?"), and overwhelming thirst for
information ("didja see?"' "havya
heard?" "I don't believe it"), these
high school students are fascinating
io their older book-carrying broth

ers -particularly when the train is
extra late.
The Final Sprint
After leaving Burlingame and the
high school students, some enter
prising Farm youths make book on
just how late they will be. Most
commuters are satisfied if the train
arrives one or two minutes before
eight. The speedy ones leave the
train as it slows down, and can be
seen almost any morning frantically
trying to overtake campus - bound
autos. One law student, with
weighty case books under each arm,
is believed to have done 100 yards
in nine seconds while trying to
catch a partially filled convertible
speeding down Palm Drive.
Once on campus, the foot race re
sumes. Here the new word is most
desperately needed. It would warn
casual strollers to take cover as the
late commuters go by. Book-carry
ing speedsters must have a clear
path if serious accidents are to be
avoided.
Rushing into class, the students
should be able to use the word to
explain to the professor that the
train was late again, they are sorry,

they are out of breath, and they
hope they haven't missed two cen
turies; of history.
Car Pool
Alpha Phi Omega, national serv
ice fraternity, has taken a different
approach to solving the commuters'
problem. At the beginning of last
quarter, the fraternity asked com
muting students to iili out informa
tion cards, giving home addresses,
class schedules, and transportation
needs.
Later the fraternity mailed the
compiled information to each stu
dent who signed up. Jack I. Robin
son, president of the fraternity,
apologized for an extended delay in
mailing, but said with the proce
dures learned, the organization will
be able to furnish complete commu
tation information near the begin
ning of each quarter.
Robinson asked that more com
muters sign the information cards
so that car pools or share-the-ride
groups can be formed, making com
muting less irksome. Information
may be left at the information desk,
Temporary Building A.
Meanwhile, interested students

are asked to concentrate on coining
the new word so tHe problems and
dangers of late commuting can be
alleviated.

have been lost.
Train company officials have add
ed extra cars and personnel to the
train, hut have been unable to make
it run on time (even Mussolini
would have had trouble speeding
up this train). The high school stu
dents get to Burlingame some 30
or -10 minutes before their classes
start, and are usually in little mood
to be rushed while boarding or get
ting off from the train.
With their natural dignity, care
fully correct dress, propensity for
love (one can't hurry the one with
whom one is holding hands, can
one?"), and overwhelming thirst for
information ("didja see?"' "havya
heard?" "I don't believe it"), these
high school students are fascinating
io their older book-carrying broth

ers -particularly when the train is
extra late.
The Final Sprint
After leaving Burlingame and the
high school students, some enter
prising Farm youths make book on
just how late they will be. Most
commuters are satisfied if the train
arrives one or two minutes before
eight. The speedy ones leave the
train as it slows down, and can be
seen almost any morning frantically
trying to overtake campus - bound
autos. One law student, with
weighty case books under each arm,
is believed to have done 100 yards
in nine seconds while trying to
catch a partially filled convertible
speeding down Palm Drive.
Once on campus, the foot race re
sumes. Here the new word is most
desperately needed. It would warn
casual strollers to take cover as the
late commuters go by. Book-carry
ing speedsters must have a clear
path if serious accidents are to be
avoided.
Rushing into class, the students
should be able to use the word to
explain to the professor that the
train was late again, they are sorry,

they are out of breath, and they
hope they haven't missed two cen
turies; of history.

Alpha Phi Omega, national serv
ice fraternity, has taken a different
approach to solving the commuters'
problem. At the beginning of last
quarter, the fraternity asked com
muting students to iili out informa
tion cards, giving home addresses,
class schedules, and transportation
needs.
Later the fraternity mailed the
compiled information to each stu
dent who signed up. Jack I. Robin
son, president of the fraternity,
apologized for an extended delay in
mailing, but said with the proce
dures learned, the organization will
be able to furnish complete commu
tation information near the begin
ning of each quarter.
Robinson asked that more com
muters sign the information cards
so that car pools or share-the-ride
groups can be formed, making com
muting less irksome. Information
may be left at the information desk,
Temporary Building A.
Meanwhile, interested students

are asked to concentrate on coining
the new word so tHe problems and
dangers of late commuting can be
alleviated.
Students who commute by train
to Stanford lrom points north need
the immediate services ol all Eng
lish majors and semanticists. A new
word must be coined. A word sim
ilar in purpose to the forceful, but
restricted in meaning, "track,"
"fore," "geronimo," or gangway."
None of these will do as the new
word must have several meanings
and must be immediately clear un
der any circumstances. The word
should be short and expressive, but
preferably not profane. It will be
used by commuting students to re
move obstacles to their speed, to
protect early-morning strollers, and
to soothe irate professors.
Depending upon the occasion and
the listener, the word should de
note. "Gad, it's one minute to eight
and we're still in Menlo"; "Please, a
ride to History corner, quick";
"Look out. here comes the off-cam
pus track team"; or '"Sorry, Doc,
the tiain was late again."
The need lor the word began
early last quartre when Southern
Pacific changed its morning train
schedules to "help" Stanford com
muters. Students living in San
Francisco had been getting up at 5
a.m., catching a 6 o'clock train, ar
riving in Palo Alto about 7. and
then spending a dreary hour on
campus before classes began. A
second train left the city at 7.
but arrived after 8 o'clock classes
started.
Change Initiated
Dick Alberton, student in the law
school, approached University and
Southern Pacific officials in an at
tempt to rectify the situation. It
took him a full quarter to convince
the necessary persons that the loss
of sleep and time was not an aid
to students seeking knowledge. Fi
nally, in January, Alberton's argu
ments took effect. The train which
had been leaving San Francisco at
7 was re-scheduled to leave 10 min
utes earlier. In theory, this train
was to arrive at Palo Alto at 7:52,
allowing eiqht minutes for the stu
dents to get from the station to
c 1 ass.
The new schedule was just initi
ated. however, when forces beyond
the impact of Alberton's arguments
intervened.
San Francisco discontinued a
.streetcar service between the city
and San Mateo. This left some t>00
Burlingame high school students,
who had been using the streetcar,
without transportation between their
homes and school. The students,
who live in scattered localities be

game, arranged to take the train.

Students who commute by train
to Stanford lrom points north need
the immediate services ol all Eng
lish majors and semanticists. A new
word must be coined. A word sim
ilar in purpose to the forceful, but
restricted in meaning, "track,"
"fore," "geronimo," or gangway."
None of these will do as the new
word must have several meanings
and must be immediately clear un
der any circumstances. The word
should be short and expressive, but
preferably not profane. It will be
used by commuting students to re
move obstacles to their speed, to
protect early-morning strollers, and
to soothe irate professors.
Depending upon the occasion and
the listener, the word should de
note. "Gad, it's one minute to eight
and we're still in Menlo"; "Please, a
ride to History corner, quick";
"Look out. here comes the off-cam
pus track team"; or '"Sorry, Doc,
the tiain was late again."
The need lor the word began
early last quartre when Southern
Pacific changed its morning train
schedules to "help" Stanford com
muters. Students living in San
Francisco had been getting up at 5
a.m., catching a 6 o'clock train, ar
riving in Palo Alto about 7. and
then spending a dreary hour on
campus before classes began. A
second train left the city at 7.
but arrived after 8 o'clock classes
started.
Change Initiated
Dick Alberton, student in the law
school, approached University and
Southern Pacific officials in an at
tempt to rectify the situation. It
took him a full quarter to convince
the necessary persons that the loss
of sleep and time was not an aid
to students seeking knowledge. Fi
nally, in January, Alberton's argu
ments took effect. The train which
had been leaving San Francisco at
7 was re-scheduled to leave 10 min
utes earlier. In theory, this train
was to arrive at Palo Alto at 7:52,
allowing eiqht minutes for the stu
dents to get from the station to
c 1 ass.
The new schedule was just initi
ated. however, when forces beyond
the impact of Alberton's arguments
intervened.
San Francisco discontinued a
.streetcar service between the city
and San Mateo. This left some t>00
Burlingame high school students,
who had been using the streetcar,
without transportation between their
homes and school. The students,
who live in scattered localities be
tween San Francisco and Burlin
game, arranged to take the train.
Delay in Burlingame
Unfortunately for the train sched
ule. several hundred high school
.students getting on and off the train
delay its southward progress con
siderably. Ey the time the train
leaves Burlingame, the gained 10
minutes, and generally a few more,
have been lost.
Train company officials have add
ed extra cars and personnel to the
train, hut have been unable to make
it run on time (even Mussolini
would have had trouble speeding
up this train). The high school stu
dents get to Burlingame some 30
or -10 minutes before their classes
start, and are usually in little mood
to be rushed while boarding or get
ting off from the train.
With their natural dignity, care
fully correct dress, propensity for
love (one can't hurry the one with
whom one is holding hands, can
one?"), and overwhelming thirst for
information ("didja see?"' "havya
heard?" "I don't believe it"), these
high school students are fascinating
io their older book-carrying broth

ers -particularly when the train is
extra late.
The Final Sprint
After leaving Burlingame and the
high school students, some enter
prising Farm youths make book on
just how late they will be. Most
commuters are satisfied if the train
arrives one or two minutes before
eight. The speedy ones leave the
train as it slows down, and can be
seen almost any morning frantically
trying to overtake campus - bound
autos. One law student, with
weighty case books under each arm,
is believed to have done 100 yards
in nine seconds while trying to
catch a partially filled convertible
speeding down Palm Drive.
Once on campus, the foot race re
sumes. Here the new word is most
desperately needed. It would warn
casual strollers to take cover as the
late commuters go by. Book-carry
ing speedsters must have a clear
path if serious accidents are to be
avoided.
Rushing into class, the students
should be able to use the word to
explain to the professor that the
train was late again, they are sorry,

they are out of breath, and they
hope they haven't missed two cen
turies; of history.
Car Pool
Alpha Phi Omega, national serv
ice fraternity, has taken a different
approach to solving the commuters'
problem. At the beginning of last
quarter, the fraternity asked com
muting students to iili out informa
tion cards, giving home addresses,
class schedules, and transportation
needs.
Later the fraternity mailed the
compiled information to each stu
dent who signed up. Jack I. Robin
son, president of the fraternity,
apologized for an extended delay in
mailing, but said with the proce
dures learned, the organization will
be able to furnish complete commu
tation information near the begin
ning of each quarter.
Robinson asked that more com
muters sign the information cards
so that car pools or share-the-ride
groups can be formed, making com
muting less irksome. Information
may be left at the information desk,
Temporary Building A.
Meanwhile, interested students

are asked to concentrate on coining
the new word so tHe problems and
dangers of late commuting can be
alleviated.
