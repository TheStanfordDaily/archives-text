# Stanford Netmen Face Rugged Weekend Vs COP and USF
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
takes on two toughies this weekend
when the nelmen meet College of
the Pacific at Stockton today at 2
and tangle with USF on the Farm
courts at 1:30 Saturday.
The Indians meet virtually the
same team that they edged 5 to 4
last year when they oppose the Ti
gers today but the Cards will be
weakened by the absence of Kirke
Mechani, number one singles play
er. Mecham injured his arm and

will not be in shape to compete be
fore next week.
On Saturday the Farm tennis
players run up against one of the
best college tennis squads in the
nation when they meet the Dons.
Heading the Hi hoppers squad are
Art Larson and Sam Match, rated
respectively number 12 and 11 na
tionally.
The Dons took the measure of
the Cure's ti to 3 last s ear and Coach
FJutiue is not optimistic about the

chances of the Indians this time.
Moving up to take over the num
ber one spot iii place of Mecham is
Fred Lewis, and his brother Bob
Lewis will take over the second post
ior Stanford.
Lucien Barbour will hold the
number three slot, and Vincent
Schmieder is the number lour man.
Bob Forbes will hold the filth po
sition. and Errol Lycette completes
the Farm lineup in the sixth spot.
'1 he Timers of COP feature the

same combination of Hank Pfistei
and Don Hamilton as their numbe:
one and two singles men and have
a well-balanced squad. COP lost to
USF last week by a 5 to 4 margin.
Without a doubt the USF Dons
are one of the best teams on the
Coast, ranking with USC and UC
LA as the strongest teams in college
competition. The Hilltoppers will
undoubtedly miss the services ot
Harry Likas but the addition ot
LK.rsen seems to have filled the gi'p
