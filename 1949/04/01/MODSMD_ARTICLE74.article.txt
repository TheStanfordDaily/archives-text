# Victorious Spikemen Race COP Saturday
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Boasting a 40 to 20 win over California in last week's relays,
Stanford's power-packed cindermen will challenge the College
of the Pacific tracksters tomorrow afternoon at the Stanford
Stadium. The mile is slated to start at 2 p.m.. and the admission
is free.
Although COP blasted the Olympic Club, 72 to 58. last Satur-

day in y dual meet, the Indian
squad will be heavily favored to
whip the Tigers and chalk up their
second straight win in the young
1949 track season.
Lyons Elected Captain
Hard-working A 1 Lyons, veteran
Stanford distance man, was elected
captain of the Card team for the
meet. He faces two tough races to
morrow when he meets COP's Jack
Kirpatrick in the mile and Charley
Richesin in the two-mile. Both men
won their events last week against
the Olympic Club.
Stanford sprinters will also get a
tough test tomorrow when they en
counter Don Hardey and Don

All members of the varsity track
team are requested to report to
Stanford Stadium at 1 pan. for
pictures.

Brooks, two 9.8 sprinters. Ronnie
Buck, Don Hart, Rupe Andrews,
and Bob Wood are slated to run
against the Tigei aces.
COP's Clem Cope has chalked up
a 21.5 in the 220, and Hardey a 21.7
in the same event. Both should be
hard to beat.
Kring Tops Vaulters
The only other Tiger spikester
who is scheduled to win his event
is Pole Yaulter Ray Kring. Kring
won the event against the Olympic
Club last week with a 13 - foot
vault, and has been credited with 14
feet.
Cards Don Campbell and Bucl
Held, both of whom cleared 13 feet
last week in the Relays, should be
Kring's chief opposition. George
Van Heusen and Dave Field give
the Indians added strength in this
even i
Although the Tigers' Eddie Macon
won the quarter mile last week in
50.3 seconds. Stanford's one - two
punch. Larry Hoff and Pitch John
son. should outrun the COP star.
Sophomore Cass Bly, who has been
improving every week, may break
into the scoring column.
Sophomores Kim 880
Stanford's half-mile strength will
depend on two sophomores, George
Mooers and Drew Terramorse. Both
men turned in excellent perform
ances against Cal last weekend, and
should be ready to go. Pacific's
Clem Cope, who also substitutes as
a sprinter, is the Tigers' chief
threat. His best time for the half
mile is 1:58.
The Cards' hurdle strength will
probably prove too great for the
Tigers. Wfth Downing McKee, Dell
Russell, and Skip Kent in the

hi.'hs, und with Gay Bryan. Bob
Bryan, and Russell in the lows, the
Cards should place one-two in both
events. Don Brooks, COP flash,
scored a double victory for the
Ti crs in the Olympic Club meet.
The Indians' weight men will be
throwing purely lor their marks, as
COP is very weak both in the shot
and the discs. Otis Chandler, who
broke the Cal-Stanford Relays lec
ord with a 54-it. 5-in. heave last
week, will have another crack at
the all-time Stanford mark of 55 ft.
3 :: 4 in. made by Stan Anderson in
1940.
Davis Returns
Lew Davis, who has thrown over
52 feet in practice, and Norm
Nourse, who broke 50 feet last
week, wii probably complete the
sweep in the shot put for the In
dians. Steve McKee, Bob Scott,
and Dalton Paxmon in addition to
Chandler will be the Cards' discus
entries.
In the jumps. Stanford's triple
event ace Gay Bryan is favored to
win both the broad anil the high
jump. Hal Buck of the Titers
jumped 0 ft. 1> 4 in. last week
against the Olympic Club, and will
vie with Dave Dulap. Charlie Bar
nett, and Ken Peck for the Indians.
Monroe Hess is COP's chief broad
jump threat (22 ft. 5 in.), and will
battle with Fred Fank, Meriitt Van
Sant. and Mike Durket for those
all - important second- and third
p'ace points.
NCAA champ Bad Held will have
♦itle competition in the javelin.
He will be aiming for a new Stan
ford record, which he broke him
self only tast week with a 224-ft.
4-in. throw. Scotc Goldsborough.

Ti crs in the Olympic Club meet.
The Indians' weight men will be
throwing purely lor their marks, as
COP is very weak both in the shot
and the discs. Otis Chandler, who
broke the Cal-Stanford Relays lec
ord with a 54-it. 5-in. heave last
week, will have another crack at
the all-time Stanford mark of 55 ft.
3 :: 4 in. made by Stan Anderson in
1940.
Davis Returns
Lew Davis, who has thrown over
52 feet in practice, and Norm
Nourse, who broke 50 feet last
week, wii probably complete the
sweep in the shot put for the In
dians. Steve McKee, Bob Scott,
and Dalton Paxmon in addition to
Chandler will be the Cards' discus
entries.
In the jumps. Stanford's triple
event ace Gay Bryan is favored to
win both the broad anil the high
jump. Hal Buck of the Titers
jumped 0 ft. 1> 4 in. last week
against the Olympic Club, and will
vie with Dave Dulap. Charlie Bar
nett, and Ken Peck for the Indians.
Monroe Hess is COP's chief broad
jump threat (22 ft. 5 in.), and will
battle with Fred Fank, Meriitt Van
Sant. and Mike Durket for those
all - important second- and third
p'ace points.
NCAA champ Bad Held will have
♦itle competition in the javelin.
He will be aiming for a new Stan
ford record, which he broke him
self only tast week with a 224-ft.
4-in. throw. Scotc Goldsborough.
Mike Durket. and Dan el Jordan
will a'so compete for the Indians

Boasting a 40 to 20 win over California in last week's relays,
Stanford's power-packed cindermen will challenge the College
of the Pacific tracksters tomorrow afternoon at the Stanford
Stadium. The mile is slated to start at 2 p.m.. and the admission
is free.
Although COP blasted the Olympic Club, 72 to 58. last Satur-

day in y dual meet, the Indian
squad will be heavily favored to
whip the Tigers and chalk up their
second straight win in the young
1949 track season.
Lyons Elected Captain
Hard-working A 1 Lyons, veteran
Stanford distance man, was elected
captain of the Card team for the
meet. He faces two tough races to
morrow when he meets COP's Jack
Kirpatrick in the mile and Charley
Richesin in the two-mile. Both men
won their events last week against
the Olympic Club.
Stanford sprinters will also get a
tough test tomorrow when they en
counter Don Hardey and Don

Brooks, two 9.8 sprinters. Ronnie
Buck, Don Hart, Rupe Andrews,

against the Tigei aces.
COP's Clem Cope has chalked up
a 21.5 in the 220, and Hardey a 21.7
in the same event. Both should be
hard to beat.
Kring Tops Vaulters
The only other Tiger spikester
who is scheduled to win his event
is Pole Yaulter Ray Kring. Kring
won the event against the Olympic
Club last week with a 13 - foot
vault, and has been credited with 14
feet.
Cards Don Campbell and Bucl
Held, both of whom cleared 13 feet
last week in the Relays, should be
Kring's chief opposition. George

won the quarter mile last week in
50.3 seconds. Stanford's one - two
punch. Larry Hoff and Pitch John

into the scoring column.
Sophomores Kim 880
Stanford's half-mile strength will
depend on two sophomores, George
Mooers and Drew Terramorse. Both
men turned in excellent perform
ances against Cal last weekend, and
should be ready to go. Pacific's
Clem Cope, who also substitutes as
a sprinter, is the Tigers' chief
threat. His best time for the half
mile is 1:58.
The Cards' hurdle strength will
probably prove too great for the
Tigers. Wfth Downing McKee, Dell
Russell, and Skip Kent in the

hi.'hs, und with Gay Bryan. Bob

a 21.5 in the 220, and Hardey a 21.7
in the same event. Both should be
hard to beat.
Kring Tops Vaulters
The only other Tiger spikester
who is scheduled to win his event
is Pole Yaulter Ray Kring. Kring
won the event against the Olympic
Club last week with a 13 - foot
vault, and has been credited with 14
feet.
Cards Don Campbell and Bucl
Held, both of whom cleared 13 feet
last week in the Relays, should be
Kring's chief opposition. George
Van Heusen and Dave Field give
the Indians added strength in this
even i
Although the Tigers' Eddie Macon
won the quarter mile last week in
50.3 seconds. Stanford's one - two
punch. Larry Hoff and Pitch John
son. should outrun the COP star.
Sophomore Cass Bly, who has been
improving every week, may break
into the scoring column.
Sophomores Kim 880
Stanford's half-mile strength will
depend on two sophomores, George
Mooers and Drew Terramorse. Both
men turned in excellent perform
ances against Cal last weekend, and
should be ready to go. Pacific's
Clem Cope, who also substitutes as
a sprinter, is the Tigers' chief
threat. His best time for the half
mile is 1:58.
The Cards' hurdle strength will
probably prove too great for the
Tigers. Wfth Downing McKee, Dell
Russell, and Skip Kent in the

hi.'hs, und with Gay Bryan. Bob
Bryan, and Russell in the lows, the
Cards should place one-two in both
events. Don Brooks, COP flash,
scored a double victory for the
Ti crs in the Olympic Club meet.
The Indians' weight men will be
throwing purely lor their marks, as
COP is very weak both in the shot
and the discs. Otis Chandler, who
broke the Cal-Stanford Relays lec
ord with a 54-it. 5-in. heave last
week, will have another crack at
the all-time Stanford mark of 55 ft.
3 :: 4 in. made by Stan Anderson in
1940.
Davis Returns
Lew Davis, who has thrown over
52 feet in practice, and Norm
Nourse, who broke 50 feet last
week, wii probably complete the
sweep in the shot put for the In
dians. Steve McKee, Bob Scott,
and Dalton Paxmon in addition to
Chandler will be the Cards' discus
entries.
In the jumps. Stanford's triple
event ace Gay Bryan is favored to
win both the broad anil the high
jump. Hal Buck of the Titers
jumped 0 ft. 1> 4 in. last week
against the Olympic Club, and will
vie with Dave Dulap. Charlie Bar
nett, and Ken Peck for the Indians.
Monroe Hess is COP's chief broad
jump threat (22 ft. 5 in.), and will
battle with Fred Fank, Meriitt Van
Sant. and Mike Durket for those
all - important second- and third
p'ace points.
NCAA champ Bad Held will have
♦itle competition in the javelin.
He will be aiming for a new Stan
ford record, which he broke him
self only tast week with a 224-ft.
4-in. throw. Scotc Goldsborough.
Mike Durket. and Dan el Jordan
will a'so compete for the Indians
ir the event.
