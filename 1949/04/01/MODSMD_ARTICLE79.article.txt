## Thru Breier's Pipe 
### 
By the time most of you read this column this morning, a group of
Stanford sportsmen have been up and about for lour hours. Not only
did they get up at 5 a.m., but since thr.t time they have taken a boat
t'ip to the Dumbarton Bridge over a course that was probably windy
tii id on water that was choppy.
These men, the members of the Stanford crew, of course, don't do I his
once a week; day in and day out some 50 men appear at their boat-
In.use at an hour most of us haven't seen since army days.
'Those Darn Fool Crewmen"
I had heard of these early morning workouts from last year but marked
:M down as something else '"those darn fool crewmen" were up to and
let it go at that. But after thinking about how hard it is for most students
to make their 8 o'clocks, I couldn't help but wonder just what lure crew
racing has to appeal to its members in such a manner.
So yesterday I. too. set the alarm and appeared at the boathouse on the
i iud flats at 5:30. It isn't warm down there at that time of the morning.
Over a wool shirt I wore two coats and expected to see many others
dressed in the same manner.
But, lo and behold, I found over 50 students dressed in bathing suits,
shorts, and T-shirts. There was no griping. Nobody snarled at his neigh
bor, indeed, there was a gay, light-hearted spirit of comradeship present.
But under this spirit, for that is exactly what it is, there was an unrnis
t ikeable show of efficiency.
Small coxswains ordered their oarsmen into positions under shell
lacks, four men to a side. Then began the team work that is present in
crew perhaps more than in any other sport. With precisioned movements,
at the barking commands of the coxswains, the shell was lifted, slid out
from the rack, lilted onto eight shoulders and carried to the water.
There the long, fragile, (52-foot cedar shell was carefully put in the
water. The cox'n was the first to enter the boat while the eight crew
men held it close to the floating dock. Then, again with the movements
of a well-drilled team, the oarsmen entered the shell and shoved off from
the dock.
Five shells were thus launched and by the time I joined Naval ROTC
Instructor Commander A. A. Clark in the launch, they were out of siyht
around the bend in the dredged channel.
What Makes a Crewman Tick?
My purpose for the trip was to try to understand why crewmen are as
they are. One trip certainly cannot show a non-crewman the answer;
but now I have nothing but the highest respect for the Stanford crew,
where before there was but a vague knowledge as to the status of the
sport as being "unrecognized." But that comes later.
But I did not yet have an answer to the question of why do crewmen
become crewmen. Why. I've asked myself, do crewmen practice all year
for four or five races that last no longer than an hour all together?
Take any other sport—football, basketball, track, baseball, soccer, any
of them—and it is easy to see that the individual has a chance to star,
regardless how much teamwork is involved. Even guards can make
louchdowns, even the lowest sub can -sink the winning basket; but how
many people, let alone Cal students, can name even two members of
California's 1948 Olympic championship crew?
Sans Glory, Sails Substitutes
Maybe that is part of the secret. Maybe the men who practice together—
away from clamor of the crowds, alone, and unpublicized—get that feel
ing and desire to win the hard way. Once you are in the shell, once
the race starts, there is no turning back or substituting. Nine men start
and nine men finish. If one fails they all fail, is one falters or weakens,
all is lost. It is truly a gamble. You work all year for a race, but one
missed stroke by one man out of eight, at 34 strokes a minute, can lose
ti e race.
As most of us know, crew is not supported by Stanford. Everything—
every shell, every oar, every drop of gasoline for the launches—all is
obtained by the boys themselves.
I don't think it can last.
You can't ignore a group of men who stay at school during spring vaca
tion to practice even though the first meet is two months away. You
can't get turnouts of up to 150 men who want to work hard, without giving
in some time. I feel that these crewmen are not the ones who are going
to give up. Some day they will get the recognition they deserve, even
though it may not be until the present group has left school and become
influential alums.
By their very nature, the crewmen are gaining support. Tomorrow
the Soph class is sponsoring a dance at Rossott's. All proceeds over
expenses will go to the crew. There should be a turnout of something
like 7,420 students. They deserve it.
Help comes from many sources. The SAEs. in my opinion, more than
earned their way back into the good graces of the Interfraternity Council
by their action over the vacation.
Without regard to the bookkeeping difficulties and so on, the SAEs let
the crewmen eat at their house for the small sum of two dollars per
men per day. And they ate well.
Ii our crewmen receive an invitation to the Poughkeepsie Regatta this
summer, financial trouble should not stand in their way. I don't think
it will.

by their action over the vacation.
Without regard to the bookkeeping difficulties and so on, the SAEs let
the crewmen eat at their house for the small sum of two dollars per
men per day. And they ate well.
Ii our crewmen receive an invitation to the Poughkeepsie Regatta this
summer, financial trouble should not stand in their way. I don't think
it will.
By the time most of you read this column this morning, a group of
Stanford sportsmen have been up and about for lour hours. Not only
did they get up at 5 a.m., but since thr.t time they have taken a boat
t'ip to the Dumbarton Bridge over a course that was probably windy
tii id on water that was choppy.
These men, the members of the Stanford crew, of course, don't do I his
once a week; day in and day out some 50 men appear at their boat-
In.use at an hour most of us haven't seen since army days.
'Those Darn Fool Crewmen"
I had heard of these early morning workouts from last year but marked
:M down as something else '"those darn fool crewmen" were up to and
let it go at that. But after thinking about how hard it is for most students
to make their 8 o'clocks, I couldn't help but wonder just what lure crew
racing has to appeal to its members in such a manner.
So yesterday I. too. set the alarm and appeared at the boathouse on the
i iud flats at 5:30. It isn't warm down there at that time of the morning.
Over a wool shirt I wore two coats and expected to see many others
dressed in the same manner.
But, lo and behold, I found over 50 students dressed in bathing suits,
shorts, and T-shirts. There was no griping. Nobody snarled at his neigh
bor, indeed, there was a gay, light-hearted spirit of comradeship present.
But under this spirit, for that is exactly what it is, there was an unrnis
t ikeable show of efficiency.
Small coxswains ordered their oarsmen into positions under shell
lacks, four men to a side. Then began the team work that is present in
crew perhaps more than in any other sport. With precisioned movements,
at the barking commands of the coxswains, the shell was lifted, slid out
from the rack, lilted onto eight shoulders and carried to the water.
There the long, fragile, (52-foot cedar shell was carefully put in the
water. The cox'n was the first to enter the boat while the eight crew
men held it close to the floating dock. Then, again with the movements
of a well-drilled team, the oarsmen entered the shell and shoved off from
the dock.
Five shells were thus launched and by the time I joined Naval ROTC
Instructor Commander A. A. Clark in the launch, they were out of siyht
around the bend in the dredged channel.
What Makes a Crewman Tick?
My purpose for the trip was to try to understand why crewmen are as
they are. One trip certainly cannot show a non-crewman the answer;
but now I have nothing but the highest respect for the Stanford crew,
where before there was but a vague knowledge as to the status of the
sport as being "unrecognized." But that comes later.
But I did not yet have an answer to the question of why do crewmen
become crewmen. Why. I've asked myself, do crewmen practice all year
for four or five races that last no longer than an hour all together?
Take any other sport—football, basketball, track, baseball, soccer, any
of them—and it is easy to see that the individual has a chance to star,
regardless how much teamwork is involved. Even guards can make
louchdowns, even the lowest sub can -sink the winning basket; but how
many people, let alone Cal students, can name even two members of
California's 1948 Olympic championship crew?
Sans Glory, Sails Substitutes
Maybe that is part of the secret. Maybe the men who practice together—
away from clamor of the crowds, alone, and unpublicized—get that feel
ing and desire to win the hard way. Once you are in the shell, once
the race starts, there is no turning back or substituting. Nine men start
and nine men finish. If one fails they all fail, is one falters or weakens,
all is lost. It is truly a gamble. You work all year for a race, but one
missed stroke by one man out of eight, at 34 strokes a minute, can lose
ti e race.
As most of us know, crew is not supported by Stanford. Everything—
every shell, every oar, every drop of gasoline for the launches—all is
obtained by the boys themselves.
I don't think it can last.
You can't ignore a group of men who stay at school during spring vaca
tion to practice even though the first meet is two months away. You
can't get turnouts of up to 150 men who want to work hard, without giving
in some time. I feel that these crewmen are not the ones who are going
to give up. Some day they will get the recognition they deserve, even
though it may not be until the present group has left school and become
influential alums.
By their very nature, the crewmen are gaining support. Tomorrow
the Soph class is sponsoring a dance at Rossott's. All proceeds over
expenses will go to the crew. There should be a turnout of something
like 7,420 students. They deserve it.

though it may not be until the present group has left school and become
influential alums.
By their very nature, the crewmen are gaining support. Tomorrow
the Soph class is sponsoring a dance at Rossott's. All proceeds over
expenses will go to the crew. There should be a turnout of something
like 7,420 students. They deserve it.
Help comes from many sources. The SAEs. in my opinion, more than
earned their way back into the good graces of the Interfraternity Council
by their action over the vacation.
Without regard to the bookkeeping difficulties and so on, the SAEs let
the crewmen eat at their house for the small sum of two dollars per
men per day. And they ate well.
Ii our crewmen receive an invitation to the Poughkeepsie Regatta this
summer, financial trouble should not stand in their way. I don't think
it will.
By the time most of you read this column this morning, a group of
Stanford sportsmen have been up and about for lour hours. Not only
did they get up at 5 a.m., but since thr.t time they have taken a boat
t'ip to the Dumbarton Bridge over a course that was probably windy
tii id on water that was choppy.
These men, the members of the Stanford crew, of course, don't do I his
once a week; day in and day out some 50 men appear at their boat-
In.use at an hour most of us haven't seen since army days.
'Those Darn Fool Crewmen"
I had heard of these early morning workouts from last year but marked
:M down as something else '"those darn fool crewmen" were up to and
let it go at that. But after thinking about how hard it is for most students
to make their 8 o'clocks, I couldn't help but wonder just what lure crew
racing has to appeal to its members in such a manner.
So yesterday I. too. set the alarm and appeared at the boathouse on the
i iud flats at 5:30. It isn't warm down there at that time of the morning.
Over a wool shirt I wore two coats and expected to see many others
dressed in the same manner.
But, lo and behold, I found over 50 students dressed in bathing suits,
shorts, and T-shirts. There was no griping. Nobody snarled at his neigh
bor, indeed, there was a gay, light-hearted spirit of comradeship present.
But under this spirit, for that is exactly what it is, there was an unrnis
t ikeable show of efficiency.
Small coxswains ordered their oarsmen into positions under shell
lacks, four men to a side. Then began the team work that is present in
crew perhaps more than in any other sport. With precisioned movements,
at the barking commands of the coxswains, the shell was lifted, slid out
from the rack, lilted onto eight shoulders and carried to the water.
There the long, fragile, (52-foot cedar shell was carefully put in the
water. The cox'n was the first to enter the boat while the eight crew
men held it close to the floating dock. Then, again with the movements
of a well-drilled team, the oarsmen entered the shell and shoved off from
the dock.
Five shells were thus launched and by the time I joined Naval ROTC
Instructor Commander A. A. Clark in the launch, they were out of siyht
around the bend in the dredged channel.
What Makes a Crewman Tick?
My purpose for the trip was to try to understand why crewmen are as
they are. One trip certainly cannot show a non-crewman the answer;
but now I have nothing but the highest respect for the Stanford crew,
where before there was but a vague knowledge as to the status of the
sport as being "unrecognized." But that comes later.
But I did not yet have an answer to the question of why do crewmen
become crewmen. Why. I've asked myself, do crewmen practice all year
for four or five races that last no longer than an hour all together?
Take any other sport—football, basketball, track, baseball, soccer, any
of them—and it is easy to see that the individual has a chance to star,
regardless how much teamwork is involved. Even guards can make
louchdowns, even the lowest sub can -sink the winning basket; but how
many people, let alone Cal students, can name even two members of
California's 1948 Olympic championship crew?
Sans Glory, Sails Substitutes
Maybe that is part of the secret. Maybe the men who practice together—
away from clamor of the crowds, alone, and unpublicized—get that feel
ing and desire to win the hard way. Once you are in the shell, once
the race starts, there is no turning back or substituting. Nine men start
and nine men finish. If one fails they all fail, is one falters or weakens,
all is lost. It is truly a gamble. You work all year for a race, but one
missed stroke by one man out of eight, at 34 strokes a minute, can lose
ti e race.
As most of us know, crew is not supported by Stanford. Everything—
every shell, every oar, every drop of gasoline for the launches—all is
obtained by the boys themselves.
I don't think it can last.
You can't ignore a group of men who stay at school during spring vaca
tion to practice even though the first meet is two months away. You
can't get turnouts of up to 150 men who want to work hard, without giving
in some time. I feel that these crewmen are not the ones who are going
to give up. Some day they will get the recognition they deserve, even
though it may not be until the present group has left school and become
influential alums.
