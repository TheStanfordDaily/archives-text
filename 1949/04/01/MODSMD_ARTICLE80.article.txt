# Farm Horsehiders Seek First Win Over California
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
A fired-up Indian baseball team,
sick and tiled of being pushed
around by clubs that it should have
beaten easily, promises to throw
everything it's t,ot at the University
of California horsehiders tomorrow
afternoon when the two teams get
together on the Sunken Diamond
for the l(s7th playing of baseball's
Big Game. Starting time is 3:15.
Coach Harry Wolter plans to start
his southpaw ace Dave Dahle in an
effort to shatter the long-standing
California baseball jinx and pack
home the CIBA bacon for the first
lime this season. The Cards have
to win this one to stay in the run
ning and they know it.
Dah'e has evidently returned to

top form after running into a streak '
of trouble during the vacation trip 1
south. The hard - throwing left- j
hander w;is shelled from the mound
in the fifih inning of the first UCLA
game last weekend, but he returned
strong to handle seven innings of
tight relief work against College of
the Pacific Tuesday night. The
Stockton Club broke up the contest :
in the 11th by squeezing over an
unearned run.
Few Lineup Changes
Elsewhere in the field the start- ;
in j lineup will be much the same
as it has been in recent games— I
except that John "Slats" Claypool !
will open out in right field in Bl;>st
ing Bob Nava's regular spot.
Nava. who's been having a tough |
time with the medics all season, is
currently benched with a case of
badly swollen feet—the result of,
some penicillin shots given him to ■
al'eviate a case of stomach trouble. I
Nava did not play against Pacific,
and it isn't known how long his
left-handed power will be out of
the lineup.
Catcher Jim Castagnoli, who's
been dividing time behind the plate
with beefy Frank MacGraw. will be
Dahle's battery mate.
Jensen on the Hill
With Jensen on the Hill and the :
hard - hitting Fiscalini receiving.
Cal's starting battery is continuing
for college ball. Elsewhere in the
field, the outfield stacks up as good,
but the infield except for stringbean
first-sacker O'Dell is questionable. I
Second baseman Don Dodson. a j
transfer from San Bernardino JC.
is batting a substantial early-season 1
.385 and appears to be the best of ;
the lot. Tim Crcnin, a pathetic .143
poker last yar, and shortstop Don i
Monroe leave something to be de
sired on the left side o fthe infield.
The outfield is full of players con
verted from other positions, but
they seem to be making a go of it
Bud Harwood, who made a letter at 1
third base last year, is playing left J
field and is currently leading the
Bears at the plate with a cool .oCO l
for 32 trips to the plate th-s season. !
