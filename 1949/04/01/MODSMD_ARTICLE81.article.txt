# Frosh Nine Hits At Cal Yearlings On Home Diamond
## 
### 
Stanford's strong frosh baseball
team, undefeated in three starts,
will risk its record in its first "big
game" of the season against the Cal
freshmen at the frosh diamond on
Saturday ai 10 a.m.
The frosh will be eager to avenge
! x>t year's two out of three series
defeat which Cal forced the men of
51 to swallow. However, this year's
â€¢lub is much stronger and is con
fident of improving on that show
in',.
So far, the highlight of this year's
frosh diamond season has been the
chucking. Never has lanky Frank
"Hammy" Hamilton or Rog Osen
baugh allowed more than two runs
in any game, and in the last out
ing Hamilton hurled a 1-0 shutout
against Commerce High School of
San Francisco.
