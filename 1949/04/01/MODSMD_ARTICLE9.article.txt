# Dairyman Quotes Milk Prices; Advises Residences To Use Quart Bottles
## 
### JIM THURBER Associate Editor, The Daily 
Milk in half-pint bottles is 2.8
more expensive than milk brought
in five-gallon cans.
Bulk milk purchased in five- or
ten-gallon cans runs about Â£4 cents
half - pint bottles comes to about
$1.79 per gallon, Edson Pier? of
Piers Dairy said yesterday in a
Daily interview.
' However, milk bought in quart
bottles comes to only 70 cents a
gallon. This would be the most eco
nomical way for fraternities to han
dle the individual container law,"
he Sidd. He estimated that it would
cost the fraternities approximately
$5,000 more per year to comply
with the state law, if they were to

j use half-pint containers.
, Miik prices in the state are set by
i the California Milk Association.
Piers Dairy supplies milk for En
j cina, Roble, Lagunita. Encina store,
! one fraternity, and all of the Wom
j Row houses.
When asked about the space re
quirements of the small bottles.
Piers admitted that the small con
tainers would take more space. Ho
advised against using the square
paper cartons. Carton milk is just
as expensive as that in glass bottles,
and the cartons are much more
i frayile. Furthermore, they are
j harder to pour, and present a difli
. cull disposal problem.
i Piers agreed with Dr. Luckett,
I campus health officer, that the ex
-1 posed lips on the small containers

were more unsanitary than the pro
tected rims of the five-gallon cans.
"The law does protect the public !
i from contaminated milk in many j
I restaurants, when bulk milk is left
standing open, and the fraternities
| have the misfortune of being in
! eluded." he said.
Meanwhile, Interfraternity repre
sentatives are working on the pos- I
| sibility of changing the existing rul
| ing by Attorney General Fred How
| ser.
Howser ruled that the fraternities j
were serving the public. If this j
j could Le changed, the fraternities ;
i could continue to serve bulk milk ;
j irom pitchers.
