## 
### 
The list of houses which will ex
change with each other at dinner
tomorrow night as part of Hello
Day, the opening event in "Back to
the Farm" Week, was announced
yesterday by Hello Day chairmen
Dana Turkington and Gordon Luce.
Exchanging houses are as fol
lows:
Alpha Delt and Lathrop; AKL
and Casa Olivo; Alpha Sigma Phi
and Roth; ATO and Casa Granada;
Betas and Storey House; Chi Psi
and Cubberley; Deke and Durand;
Delt and Russell; Delta Chi and
Casa Eucalypto; DU and part of
Branner; KA and Branner; Kappa
Sisma and Branner.
Phi Delt and Guthrie; Fiji and
Hurlburt; Phi Kappa Psi and Man
zanita and Mariposa; Phi Kappa
Sigma and Casa Espanola and Bran
ner; Phi Sigma Kappa and Jordan;
Theta Chi and Union; Theta Delt
and Branner; Theta Xi and Oaks
and Elm; Sigma Chi and Union;
Sigma Nu and Roble; SAE and
Roble.
Zeta Psi and Madrono; Village
110 and Casa Ventura; Village 117
and Casa Adelfa; Village 310 and
Casa Magnolia; Village 316 and
Casa Naranja; and Encina and
Roble.
Social chairmen in each living
group have contacted their ex
change partners, and should make
final arrangements among them
selves, Miss Turkington said.
Those in the large University din
ing halls such as Encina, Roble, Un
ion, Branner, and Lagunita have
made arrangements through their
respective dining room directors.
Due to dining room regulations
only 80 will be allowed to ex
change in the Encina dining room,
Luce said, so Toyon and Crothers
men therefore will sign up with the
Encina social chairmen.
'"The exchange was determined
at random with consideration of
similar numbers only," Miss Tur
kington said. ''The purpose is to
mix people up, not to arrange indi
vidual exchanges."
This is the opening gun of "Back
to the Farm" Day, a new kind of
Hello Doy. In the past students
have merely said "hello" to people
they did not know on Quad. But
Luce and Miss Turkington, togeth
er with Ed Wells, chairman of
"Back to the Farm" Week, felt that
all campus exchange dinners would
help students meet new people and
carry out the purpose of Hello Day
farther than it has ever been car
ried before.
Hello Day is sponsored by the
Class of '50.

Those in the large University din
ing halls such as Encina, Roble, Un
ion, Branner, and Lagunita have
made arrangements through their
respective dining room directors.
Due to dining room regulations
only 80 will be allowed to ex
change in the Encina dining room,
Luce said, so Toyon and Crothers
men therefore will sign up with the
Encina social chairmen.
'"The exchange was determined
at random with consideration of
similar numbers only," Miss Tur
kington said. ''The purpose is to
mix people up, not to arrange indi
vidual exchanges."
This is the opening gun of "Back
to the Farm" Day, a new kind of
Hello Doy. In the past students
have merely said "hello" to people
they did not know on Quad. But
Luce and Miss Turkington, togeth
er with Ed Wells, chairman of
"Back to the Farm" Week, felt that
all campus exchange dinners would
help students meet new people and
carry out the purpose of Hello Day
farther than it has ever been car
ried before.
Hello Day is sponsored by the
Class of '50.
