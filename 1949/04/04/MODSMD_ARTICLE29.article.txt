## They Talked It Over 
### 
A letter printed on today's editorial page contains constructive
criticism of the ASSU Committee on Constitutional Revision.
Although the writer's ideas already had been considered by
the committee, the group felt that more progress would be made
it students concerned with each phase of the new constitution
sat down at a table and talked over their problems. All these
meetings were open to Farm students. As a result, the finished
product should coincide with student desires.
An example of this procedure occurred when members of
!Men's and Women's Councils, interested students, and commit
tee members met last quarter to reach common understanding
concerning Honor Code and Fundamental Standard hearings.
Students representing both Councils agreed that joint Council
meetings should be held when Honor Code violations are re
viewed. For Fundamental Standard violations, however, the
students felt that the two Councils should meet separately.
With several related roundtable discussions to use for ref
erence, the committee is writing a new constitution for the ASSU.
Before you vote on the new document, The Daily will have
printed the constitution three times. After the first two printings
Ihe committee will gladly receive student suggestions. Any
changes made during the first two printings will appear in the
third and final publication to appear in The Daily. This third
notice will be posted in all voting booths.
We cannot vote on portions of the new constitution because
the ASSU must be able to operate on 100 per cent of it—not 80
or 90 per cent.
When the constitution is printed in The Daily, we cannot, as
Mr. Lindsey suggested, bold face or quote amended passages
because the entire body is new.
