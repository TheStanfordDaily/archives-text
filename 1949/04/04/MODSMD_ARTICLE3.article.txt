# Roble 1-C Sees $1,500 Fire, Heaviest in Dorm's History
## 
### 
Roble girls starting to late break -
! fast about 8:15 Friday morning were
j startled by the building's fire bell,
j which announced the heaviest fire
| yet seen in Roble. The conflagra
tion, which started in the closet of
room 176, corridor 1-C, did about
$1,500 damage to the room and to
the personal property of the resi
! dent, Shirley Scotten.
Cause of the fire has not been de
| termined, according to Fire Chief
! John Marston. It was discovered by
I Mrs. Louise Carter, the maid, and
Carolyn Comaford who lives in 1-C.
Miss Lucie Lataillade. Roble di
rector. reports that the girls cleared
the hall in a very efficient manner
| with no show of panic, long before
I the fire equipment had time to reach
the scene. As soon as it was deter

mined that thei-e was no danger to
other parts of the building, girls
re-entered and breakfast was served
as usual.
Except for some blackening of
corridor 1-C by smoke from the
room, damage was i-estrieted to the
room where the fire started. Chief
Marston lias said before that Roble |
is one of the best fireproofed build- i
ings on campus. The fire spread j
around the moldings and woodwork
and charred some of the furniture
and a number of miscellaneous j
items in the room. All clothing in
the closet was a total loss.
The room was made completely 1
unusable, so Shirley is being ac
commodated in another room in the
corridor until such time as the
walls of her room can be replastered |
and painted.
Miss Lataillade states that the
University, as do most universities. 1
carries no fire insurance on the j
personal property of the residents.
However, she said, the insurance
company reports that Shirley may j
be able to obtain some compensa- j
tion through her parents' insur
ance.


I IRE CHIEF JOHN MARSTON and Marti Tullar of Lagunita Court
survey some of the least damaged property taken from Shirley Scotten's
lire-gutted Roble room. Iler wardrobe and much of her personal prop
erty was burned beyond repair while she was at class Friday morning.
