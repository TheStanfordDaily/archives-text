To Tod Buttner, president of the Sophomore Class
Open Letter to the Class of '51
Dear Ted:
Your class today did one of the finest things I have ever seen in my
entire time here at Stanford. I know that I speak not only for myself,
but every member of the crew in saying we are deeply indebted to you
for the boost you have given us.
With spirit like yours behind us, I don't see how we con possibly lose,
lit is an awfully good feeling to know that we have people like you rooting
for us.
Our hats are oft to you, your class, and your Excom for a fine job,
well done!
JOHN DEE
