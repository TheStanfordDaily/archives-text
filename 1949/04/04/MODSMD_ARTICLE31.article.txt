To the Editor:
The committee on the revision of the ASSU constitution is undoubtedly
doing a fine, conscientious job. They have frequently invited students to
show their interst by attending meetings. Very few students—certainly
not a true campus cross-section—have done so. Such apparent 'apathy
must hamper the production of the best possible new constitution.
Yet perhaps the campus is not really apathetic, but merely unwilling to
be spectators to the long, hard, but important working sessions of this, or
any, committee.
If this be true, there is a simple solution. Whenever the committee com
pletes the revision of a section of the constitution, this proposed "revision
could be published immediately in The Daily in order to sound out campus
opinion.
Such publication may help the committee to present an even better re
vision to the students—or at any rate, to present for eventual vote a re
vision more likely to coincide with the desires of the majority of interested
students.
When the proposed revision is published, it would be helpful to head the
article with a summary index to the location of all changes. All changed
words might be in bold type and all omitted words in brackets.
