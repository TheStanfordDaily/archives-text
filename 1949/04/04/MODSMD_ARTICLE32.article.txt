## Bull Session 
### 
There seems to be little doubt that spring has officially sprung. All of
the young men's fancies are lightly turning to, and even the weather
rtport has a nole of spring in it. The official forecast for today is "abun
dant sunshine, followed by high winds, followed by high skirts, followed
by three Dekes."
Springtime means Easter is "just around the corner," which, when you
come to think of it, is something which mifcht be rather hard to prove.
I've been around several corners recently, and Easter wasn't hiding behind
r<ny of them. But I digress.
With spring and Easter on my mind, I decided the other day to go down
to my clothiers, Hart, Karl, and Marx, and buy a few new clothes. I
haven t been trading with Hart, Karl, and Marx for very long. 1 used
to get my pants at Roos Brothers, my coats at Phelps-Terkel, and my
barrels at Tanforan.
Formerly I bought all my clothes in San Francisco at the five-man com
panyâ€”Foreman and Clark. I first decided to trade there when I heard
their advertisement on the radio. For 30 bucks they gave you a coat, pants,
vest, shoes, socks, underwear, three shirts, five neckties, and a year's sub
scription to Sunshine and Health.
My new spring outfit cost me $175. Of course that price included 14
pairs of pants. The trousers are sort of a lavender blue, dilly. dilly.
with a contrasting coat of a loose brown knit. That coat Ls a flashy looking
number, but Tm glad they turned it around and put the label on the
inside. After all. how many people wear clothes styled by "Guano of
California."
