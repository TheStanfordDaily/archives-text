# Costs Up, Bills Same In Hospitals
## 
### 
CHICAGO. I/P) —Although hos
pitals' costs are skyrocketing, it
won't cost you much more for a hos
pital stay today than it did eight or
nine years ago.
But that's only because you'll be
out of the hospital about twice as
fast as you would have before. You'll
pay a lot more for your care per
day, but you won't be there as
many days.
Hospitals' rates have not kept
pace with their zooming costs, hos
pital authorities say. They've risen
—just as prices on automobiles, or
butter, or shoes have risen.
The American Medical Association
says that the cost of medical care
hasn't risen as sharply as the general
cost of living.
The February issue of the asso
ciation's journal reports that the
average cost of doctor and hospital
bills last year was estimated by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at
141 per cent of the 1935-39 cost.
This compared with the Labor De
partment estimate of 171.2 per cent
for the consumers' price index of
1948.
One of the biggest items in hos
pital expenses is salaries. Dr. Mal
colm T. MacEachern, associate di
rector of the American College of
Surgeons, said today that a few
years ago hospital payrolls com
prised 30 to 40 per cent of the total
budget, whereas they now eat up 80
per cent. Higher pay rates, plus
shorter hours, thus more employees,
explain this boost.
Food costs have climbed from 30
to 50 per cent over 1940 levels, he
said, and surgical instruments are up
50 per cent. And the shortness of
most patients' stay also boosts costs.
Dr. MacEachern declared.
"We used to keep major surgical
cases hospitalized from 17 to 40
days," he stated. "The patients were
generally quite ill for five or six
days, but after that they didn't re
quire so much costly nursing care
and sort of looked after themselves.
"That meant that during that time
they were paying the tariff but there
wasn't so much cost.
Now the average stay is seven to
eight days, which means we only
have the patient in the hospital
when he is sickest, and that is
more costly.
The American Hospital Associa
tion said its figures show the na
tion's general hospitals had an aver
age total patient income per day of
$7.95 in 1945, compared with $9.71
in 1947. Figures for 1948 aren't com
plete. Average hospital expendi
tures per patient per day, it added,
were $8.95 in 1945 and $11.09 in
I 1947.
The difference is made up through
gifts and endowments, charitable
contributions, and local, county, and
i sta<e aid. the AHA said.
Sample items which hospitals
must provide, and their cost, the
I association added, include: sheets,
| $15.18 a dozen in 1943 and $27.85 a
dozen in 1948; potatoes, $1 .'6O per
hundred pounds in 1940, $4.50 in
1948; X-ray equipment, $5,065 in
1941, $10,168 in 1948; salaries of gen
eral duty nurses, $155 monthly in
1945, $204 in 1948.
As for building new hospitals, the
AIIA said construction costs aver
aged $5,000 per bed in 1940. Today?
$ 15.00 ft.
