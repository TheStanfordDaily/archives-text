# Our Beacon in Russia

By GEORGE VELLIOTES
There is an American beacon in
Hussia.
Fifty thousand copies of this slick.
Fortune-sized, Liberty-thick jour
nal are sent monthly to the Soviet
Union where ihey are distributed to
libraries, schools, and to offices of
the intelligentsia throughout the
country.
Amerika reputedly is read by ap
proximately 1.000.000 Russians. (The
magazine is quickly sold out for 10
ruble, equivalent to 90 cents a copy.)
This Russian language magazine is
a hopeful American investment.
Distribution to Russian of these
limited 50,000 copies is done through
on agreement that the United States
State Department foresightedly
managed to get the Russians to sign
in 1945. After a continuous four
years of cold war since then, Amcr
ika is still being distributed in Rus
sia from Siberia to Latvia.
While we manage to keep our foot
in the Iron Curtain's adjoining Iron
Doorway, the cause of democracy is
being served by Amerika's truthful
photographic and verbal accounts of
what Americans do, look like, say,
and think.
This magazine, if printed in Eng
lish and distributed in this country,
undoubtedly would be a very popu
lar seller: there are no advertise
ments (unless the reader in Russia
considers the whole magazine as
such on behalf of the capitalistic
way of life—and in elfect that is a
prime purpose).
However, if some ordinary Amer
ican ads were run in Amerika as an
example of capitalistic living stan
dards, capitalistic goods, and capi
talistic methods of selling and dis
tributing. some of the Russian read
ers might object or disbelieve.
In one of the early issues a photo
showed a number of American fac
tory girls each wearing, a wrist
watch. This some Russian readers
did not believe. They thought it had
been a put up job of posing.
The front, inside front, back, and
inside back covers are not cluttered
up with garish lingerie or cigarette
ads. Instead, here are placed huge,
full-page color photographs of

American industrial, manufacturing,
and scenic views, 3 0 1 3 by 14 inches—
the same size as Life.
Amerika is subtitled "Illustrated
Journal, for it is a pictorial maga
zine to a great extent. The March
issue was about 45 per cent pictures,
graphs, and cartoon; 55 per cent was
stories, explanatory material, cap
tions, and titles.
The last issue had 179 photos,
many of them colored, graphs, car
toons, maps, covering in one issue
on 72 pages subject matter which
ranged from U.S. Labor Unions'
history; color in industry; television
today in America; a fourth install
ment explaining U.S. history (the
Jackson era); a condensation of
John Steinbeck's short story (Pat
Humbert's, a story of a lonely Cali
fornia farm boy); two colorful pages
of American women's spring fash
ions; a photographic essay, "Flight
by Night '; new American compos
ers; a picturization of a Saturday
Evening Post cover by Norman
Rockwell; plus a score of miniature
reproductions of other American
magazine covers with accompanying
literary explanations; science against
pneumonia in America; motion pic
tures, rural electrification, and other
subjects were covered.
One reason why the Russians may
not have slammed the Iron Door on
Amerika's distribution in the USSR
might be due to reasoning that one
million cautioned, warned, 011 guard
against "propaganda Russians out of
200,000,000 population is small
enough price to pay in a war of
ideas for assured, reciprocal distri
bution of Russian propaganda jour
nals in the U.S.A., such as the Sov
iet-embassy transmitted Soviet In
formation Bulletin and other pe
riodicals down on the Justice De
partment's list.
If this guess is true, see what it
means:
The Russian leaders are confident
of controlling any "subversive*' ten
dencies in their own people fostered
by "ideollogical untruths" from
abroad, while they arc confident that
their continued battering at the in
tellectual palisades of America will
bear fruit—perhaps in the form of
Red "terft)ites."
