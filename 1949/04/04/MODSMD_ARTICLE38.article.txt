# Med School Applicants Need Patience Before Patients
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
I'm a junior pre-med student.
Last fall I applied for an appoint
ment to the Stanford School of
Medicine.' This February I was not
one of the 62 students on the
"horseshoe list." Next fall I'll apply
gain. Again I'll wait — but not
hopefully—for the committee's de
cision.
These are the thoughts of approx
mately 1,200 hopeful medical stu
dents each year. In a field as com
petitive as medicine the percentages
are small. Few make the grade.
But still potential physicians ap
ply and reapply year after year.
Selections for the School of Med
icine are completed Feb. 1 by a
committee composed of the medi
cal staff from both the city hospi
tals and from the campus medical
faculty.
Of the 1.200 applications received,
only 1.000 can be considered. From
'his point the committee reviews
the candidate on the basis of grades,
personal qualities, and faculty rec
ommendations.
The 62 fortunates who are chosen
go through five years of medical
school together. For more than a
year their studies are taken on cam
pus until the University degree is
awarded. The fol'owing three years
are filled with specialized courses
and ward work in the San Fran
cisco hospitals. The fifth year is
in internship preparatory to
private practice.
The School of Medicine requires a

[ stiff pre-medicine curriculum. In
i addition to emphasis on biology,
chemistry, and physics, the student
must take extra units in English
and languages. The diploma can be
; earned in nearly any field as long
as the pre - medical requirements
| are met.
Like many other schools, the tui
tion for the School of Medicine has
increased. It costs the student $699
for the regular three-quarter year
in addition to expensive books and
fees which lighten the purse by
more than $100. As a financial boost
there are about 35 kinds of scholar-
I ships available specifically for stu
dents of medicine.
According to Miss Bernice Ewell,
| medical admissions secretary, ap
plications to the Stanford School of
Medicine are received from all over
the United States and from many
foreign countries. The majority of
the applicants are men, but in each
class there are always three or four
j women.
Miss Ewell urges everyone to ap
ply in October because, she said,
"Some selections are made from
among the superior students by De
cember, and there is a greater
chance for the early bird. "Also,"
she added, "it avoids a last-minute
rush in the admissions offices and
allows more time for closer exami
i nation of all students."
It is this examining process which
must produce the 62 best-qualified
students for the limited enrollment
i in the School of Medicine.
