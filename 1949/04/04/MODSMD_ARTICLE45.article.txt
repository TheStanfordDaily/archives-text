# 'Symphonic Pastorale' Good Certainly, But Is It Great?
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
"La Symphonic Pastorale," play
ing at the Guild, has just enough
flaws to lall into the "above aver
age entertainment' 1 category, but

there are many
people who will
call it a great
picture.
The pastor
(Pierre Blan
char) of a small
village in the
Swiss Alps.finds
an untaught

blind girl (Michele Morgan) la
beled as an idiot. In a brutal scene
the starving child stumbles toward
him for a bowl of soup. He brings
her up with his own children, and
only his bitter wife (Line Nora)
realizes that he is in love with her.
The pastor's son Jacques (Jean
Desailly) returns home and also
falls in love with the girl. Gertrude.
An operation gives Gertrude her
sight and she realizes it is Jacques,
whom the pastor has kept her from
marrying, that she loves.
This is the climax and the ending
of the picture should come quickly,
but the film rambles through two
more reels and most of the tragic
suspense is lost. The last few scenes
are as brutal as the impact of a fist,
but there is no steady build-up for
the girl's actions at the end. The
audience wonders little "why it
had to end this way."
Michele Morgan and Pierre Blan
char are excellent in a cast that is
uniformly excellent! but Line Nora
is superb as the resentful wife who

realizes her husband's infatuation
before he is aware of it.
Jean Delannoy's direction of the
1 rench picture is also uniformly
t jrood, although it loses its sharpness
: and originality in the middle of the
I picture. Photography is above av
| erage and there is one exceptionally
photographed scene. As the pastor
| runs desperately to catch Gertrude,
the scenery flashes by at the rate
ol a last train.
