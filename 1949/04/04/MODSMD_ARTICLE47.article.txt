# Frosh Clip Modesto In First Match, 6-3
## 
### 
In their first intercollegiate com
petition a strong Stanford frosh net
squad scored a surprisingly easy
victory over Modesto Jonior Col
lege, 6-3. Saturday on the home
courts.
Tht feature match was won by
Modesto s Lorn Main, the Canadian
star. Main polished off the Card
babes' number one player, George
Gentry, 8-6. 6-4. It was Main's abil
ity to return Gentry's usually pow
erful service that was the key to
the Canadian's victory.
Ernie Dußray was forced into
three sets before he put away Jim
Dean. Starting off shakily, Dußray
regained his steadiness and forced
Dean to make errors.
