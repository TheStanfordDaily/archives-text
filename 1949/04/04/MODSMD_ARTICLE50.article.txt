### BILL SWIGART 
The whistling fastball and the singing bat of Lefty Dave Dahle
paced Stanford's baseballing Indians to their first CIBA victory
of the year Saturday as the Redskins warmed up in the middle
innings to blast the favored University of California horsehiders,
12 to 3, on the Sunken Diamond.
A partisan sun-baked crowd of more than 3,000 roared with

approval as the hustling Cards
scored their most convincing win in
years over a Clint Evans California
nine.
The triumph snapped a three
tame Stanford losing streak and put
the Indians back into the thick of
the CIBA pennant fight with a sea
son record of one win and two de
feats.
Dahle scattered eight California

hits and allowed only one earned
run in addition to having quite a
day lor himself at the plate. The
Card left-hander drilled out a per
fect three doubles and a single in
four trips to lead Stanford's blis
tering 12-hit attack.
The Indians jumped on the Bears'
starter, Jackie Jensen, for two runs
•on two hits in the second inning,
I and added two more safe blows in
the fifth before Cnl was able to tally.
With the score standing at 4 to 2
; against him, Jensen was moved to
center Held in the sixth, and right
handers Dave Anderson and
Whimpy Jones followed him to the
• hill.
Neither managed to fool anybody
and the Cards pounded across five
runs in the sixth and added three
more in the seventh as the Cali
fornia defense fell apart at th< ?
seams.
The game was not without its
usual number of beefs, and Bear
catcher Jim Fiscalini was evicted in
the fifth inning for trying to take a
poke at the place umpire after a
close play at home.
Jim Castagnoli, attempting 10
steal home, Hid around Fiseaiini's
tag with not much room to spare,
rolled completely over home plate,
and had to come back on his hands
and knees to score.
Umpire Frank Syce, right on top
of the play, ruled Castagnoli safe
and then beat a hasty retreat to get
out of the way of the big catcher's
flying fists. Fiscalini was given tlit'
heave ho, and after some 10 minutes
of discussion in which Bear Coach
Clint Evans and the whole Cal team
took part, play was resumed with
reserve backstop Beck behind the
plate.
Pootball hero Jackie Jensen had
a good day at the plate for the losers,
picking up three singles and a walk
to drive in two of the Bears' three
runs. Stringbean first baseman Bob
o'Dell connected with two for four,
including' a long triple in the eighth
inning. Dahle with his four for four,
John Claypool, Bud Klein, and Jim
Castagnoli paced the Indian stick
work.
