# Chandler Hot: Tribe Drubs COP
## Tracksters Roar Past COP Tigers, 101 to 30 
### JOHN HALL 
A pair of shoulders named Otis Chandler moved the shot 55
feet 4 inches Saturday afternoon to steal the show, as Stanford's
improving thinclads thundered past limp College of Pacific,
101 to 30.
A scattered Stadium crowd watched a trio of Tribe fieldmen

set some of the best marks in the"?
nation, as shot put, broad jump, j
high jump, and javelin perform- J
ances were excellent.
Disorganized COP was over- j
whelmed right from the start, and |
managed only to grab two firsts,
one in the pole vault and the other
in the 220.
Chandler's tremendous heave in j
the shot set a new all-time Stan
ford record, besting that of Stan
Anderson's 55 feet 3 :; 4 inches, set j
in 1940.
Bryan Gets a Triple
Figuring almost as prominently J
in the parade of field specialists
was triple-threat Gay Bryan who !
slithered over 6-5 in the high jump, '
bounced out to 24-9 (an inch short |
of Stanford's all-time record) in
the broad jump, and finished up in
another category with a 24.2 vic
tory in the low hurdles.
Bud Held helped things along
with a 214-foot toss in the javelin
to pick up an easy five points. Any
thing over 200 will continue to win
all the remaining dual meets on
Stanford's schedule, and big Bud
Held has reached the point where
he is consistently over 200.
But while the Indian field per
formances were raising Stanford s
stock for the meet with UCLA next
Saturday in Los Angeles, the Card
runners were racking up only luke
warm times.
However, there were many en
couraging factors displayed by the
hardworking cindermen.
MiKee Goes Again
Downing McKee went under 15
flat for the first time this season in
the high hurdles, ticking off 14.9 to
win over teammates Dell Russell
and Jim Parks.
Fleet-footed Larry Iloff showed
that he had it in the clutch by out
driving COP's Eddie Macon in a
thrilling 440, easily the day's best
race. The time. 49 flat, was respec
table. but Larry must improve to
take the Bruins next week.
Ronnie Buck ran his best - ever
100 yards, taking the event by a
stride in 10 flat. COP's Jack Hardy
had been favored to win, but Buck
wouldn't have it that way.
Al Lyons, all by himself, turned
in an easy mile at 4:29.1. and gave
>iyns of being able to do much bet
ter under pressure.
Lew Davis Third in Nation
Other outstanding improvements
included Otis Chandler's toss of 145
feet 10 inches in the discus, and
Lew "Lion" Davis's put of 53 feet
7 inches in the shot.
Still weak in the sprints, the 880.
and the pole vault. Stanford will
run into much difficulty in these
events 'in future meets.

managed only to grab two firsts,
one in the pole vault and the other
in the 220.
Chandler's tremendous heave in j
the shot set a new all-time Stan
ford record, besting that of Stan
Anderson's 55 feet 3 :; 4 inches, set j
in 1940.
Bryan Gets a Triple
Figuring almost as prominently J
in the parade of field specialists
was triple-threat Gay Bryan who !
slithered over 6-5 in the high jump, '
bounced out to 24-9 (an inch short |
of Stanford's all-time record) in
the broad jump, and finished up in
another category with a 24.2 vic
tory in the low hurdles.
Bud Held helped things along
with a 214-foot toss in the javelin
to pick up an easy five points. Any
thing over 200 will continue to win
all the remaining dual meets on
Stanford's schedule, and big Bud
Held has reached the point where
he is consistently over 200.
But while the Indian field per
formances were raising Stanford s
stock for the meet with UCLA next
Saturday in Los Angeles, the Card
runners were racking up only luke
warm times.
However, there were many en
couraging factors displayed by the
hardworking cindermen.
MiKee Goes Again
Downing McKee went under 15
flat for the first time this season in
the high hurdles, ticking off 14.9 to
win over teammates Dell Russell
and Jim Parks.
Fleet-footed Larry Iloff showed
that he had it in the clutch by out
driving COP's Eddie Macon in a
thrilling 440, easily the day's best
race. The time. 49 flat, was respec
table. but Larry must improve to
take the Bruins next week.
Ronnie Buck ran his best - ever
100 yards, taking the event by a
stride in 10 flat. COP's Jack Hardy
had been favored to win, but Buck
wouldn't have it that way.
Al Lyons, all by himself, turned
in an easy mile at 4:29.1. and gave
>iyns of being able to do much bet
ter under pressure.
Lew Davis Third in Nation
Other outstanding improvements
included Otis Chandler's toss of 145
feet 10 inches in the discus, and
Lew "Lion" Davis's put of 53 feet
7 inches in the shot.
Still weak in the sprints, the 880.
and the pole vault. Stanford will
run into much difficulty in these
events 'in future meets.
A pair of shoulders named Otis Chandler moved the shot 55
feet 4 inches Saturday afternoon to steal the show, as Stanford's
improving thinclads thundered past limp College of Pacific,
101 to 30.
A scattered Stadium crowd watched a trio of Tribe fieldmen

set some of the best marks in the"?
nation, as shot put, broad jump, j
high jump, and javelin perform- J
ances were excellent.
Disorganized COP was over- j
