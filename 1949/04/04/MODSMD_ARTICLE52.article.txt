; dual meet, as Hartnell, formerly

• third places for a rather unimpres
j sive total of 3 points.
By far the outstanding individual
performance of the day was turned

I off-season gridder who romped to
decisive wins in both the 100- and
220-yard dash events, then capped
the day's festivities with a 21-ft.
4-in. leap to cop the broad jump
event.

| was clocked at 22 seconds fiat in
' the 220.
Probably the top junior college
vaulter in the country, Modesto's
Walt Jensen took that event with
! a vault of 13-0, but a sudden wind
( hampei'ed Jensen in his attempts to
go higher. Frosh Dick Horn placed
| second by clearing 12-6.
