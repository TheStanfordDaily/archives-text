### AL BERRY 
Stanford's Sala - less swimming '
team made it 36 straight dual meet
victories, Saturday morning, as
they breezily dunked the Col : eee of
the Pacific, 46-29. in the Indians'
own pool.
Times, generally, were poor, but
COP—with two top men restricted
to their campus—was never in a
position to threaten the home-tank
fishmen.
At the same time, the spectators
watched COP's farm club. Stockton
Junior College, easily take a triad
meet away from the Stanford frosh
i and Modesto JC, 59-47-1.
Stockton was never pushed and
set three national junior college rec
j ords while walking away with the
laurels.
Putting in particularly fine per
formances for the Stanford varsity
| were Woody Hoogs. who touched
, out the Indians' Harry Borchers to
win the 50 freestyle, and diver Jim
my Bradshaw, who turned in his
best job to date on the springboards.
The most pleasant surprise of
the morning, however, was John
Mowat, who won both the 220 and
the 440 (ten very essential points)
in lieu of the scholastically side
i lined Ralph Sala. While Mowat s
times were not -remarkable, he was.
: nevertheless, in command of both
races all the way.
Bob Wycoff looked good for the
j Stanford yearlings, winning both
I the 50 and 100 freestyle events.
Bruce Putnam won the 150 back
stroke and pulled in second behind
1 Cullenwood in the 220.
