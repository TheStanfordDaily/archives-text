# Tribe Scores Victories in Sports Play
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's redshirted Indians cel
ebrated their first weekend of
spring quarter with a set of the
most completely successful athletic
ventures seen since pre-war days.
Combining varsity wins in track,
baseball, golf, and swimming, and
adding frosh victories in track,
baseball, golf, and tennis, the Stan
ford athletes made a clean sweep
of every weekend contest except
varsity tennis and frosh swimming.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's cinder
squad led the victory parade with
a landslide triumph over College of
the Pacific, 101 to 30. Powerful Otis
Chandler set the pace with a tre
mendous 55-loot 4-inch heave in
the shot.
Chandler s put was good enough
to establish a new all-time Stan
ford record, nosing out former
holder Stan Anderson by one-quar
ter of an inch.
Indian baseballers turned in their
best game of the year to knock
pitcher Jackie Jensen out of the
box and pounce on California's
Bears," 12 to 3. Stanford's Lefty Dave
Dahle limited the Bears to eight
hits, and he became the game hero
with three doubles and a single in
four trips to the plate.
Diver Jim Bradshaw helped Stan
ford's swimming team to its 36th
straight dual meet victory with a
300-point performance on the 10-
foot board. The mermen went on
to score a decisive 46 to 29 win over
College of the Pacific.
Rounding out the varsity victory
feast was the golf team, which
rolled over Santa Clara. 21 to 6.
Stanford s Bob Crozier shot the
day's best round with a three under
par 69.
