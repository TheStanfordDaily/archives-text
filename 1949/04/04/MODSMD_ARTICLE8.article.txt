# Job Opportunities Surveyed For Future Farm Graduates

### 
Airline jobs, newspaper, radio,,
! and FBI positions will be relatively j
hard to find during the next several j
| years. Many other occupations have j
j a much brighter future, from phy- ,
I sicians through foundry workers, j
i according to a recent press release
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, j
The field of airline pilots is over
! crowded and only the most highly !
experienced and qualified men are!
likely to get jobs for some years.
Although each year sees some
! openings for qualified airline host
; esses, there already exists consider
able competition for jobs.
The newspaper reporting field* is
somewhat overcrowded at present.
In the long run, opportunities in
: newspaper work will probably con
tinue to be limited, but some ex
| pansion in related fields is expected.
A good many openings for radio
| announcers will occur in the near
; future, but competition is likely to
I be keen particularly in large cities.
Prospective FBI agents will have
' a difficult time entering the Held;
there are more job - seekrs than
openings. Some few openings are in
prospect for federal police and de
i tectives.
j The personnel field is overcrowd-
J ed at present. Long-term employ
; ment trend is slowly upward, but
j keen competition for entry jobs is
I likely to' continue for several years.
Although the use of Diesel en
j gines has increased since the war,
there will probably be limited em
j plovment opportunities for new
| workers or those who have only
I specialized Diesel - engine training.
• Companies changing to Diesel en

gines usually assign experienced
mechanics, already on the payroll,,
to service the equipment, giving
them the required retraining.
Opportunities are excellent for
physicians who can gain admission
to medical school. The need for
doctors is greatest in rural areas.
Kindergarten and elementary
school teachers have the best op
portunities. Shortages at those lev
els are expected to continue for a
longer period than at higher grade
levels.
Librarians have very good oppor
tunities. Professionally trained per
sons should find jobs with ease for
at least several years.
The field for secretaries and ste
nographers will be good in the im
mediate future, although keen com
petition is probable in the long run.
The butcher, the baker, and the
electric bulb mold-maker have good
opportunities as well as automobile
mechanics and foundry workers.
