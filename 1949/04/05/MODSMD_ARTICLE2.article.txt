Condition of Kenneth Johnstone,
19-year-old lower division student
injured in a freak swimming acci
dent at Rio del Mar I:each Sunday
afternoon, was described yesterday
as "very slightly improved" by his
physician, Dr. John D. Fuller oi'
Santa Cruz.
''Johnstone is a seriously injured
boy," Dr. Fuller said, "and it will
be necessary for hirn to have sev
eral days' rest before we can make
any positive statement on his con
dition."
A native of Tacoma, Wash., John
stone suffered temporary paralysis
from the shoulders down and a
badly bruised eye after striking his
head underneath the surf waters of
Rio del Mar beach.
Chi Psi fraternity brothers took
him to Santa Cruz Hospital where
X-ray photos revealed no spinal
fractures. He will remain there un
til Dr. Fuller says he is recovered
enough to be transferred to the
Palo Alto Hospital on the Stanford
campus.
Dr. George Houck, director of the
Health Service here, said that as
soon as Johnstone is brought back
to campus, he will be put under the
care of Dr. E. B. Towne, a neuro
