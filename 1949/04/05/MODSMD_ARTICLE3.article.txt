# Orchesis Will Give Original Show Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight the leprechauns will
dance *'At Irish Midnight" as the
.sprites in Orchesis, modern dance
society, leap and dart across the
stage of Memorial Hall. The lec
tlire-concert is being presented at
7:30 p.m. on the Tuesday Evenng
Series.
Original choreography, costumes,
and lighting have been prepared by
Orchesis members for the program,
which is their chief project of the
year.
The four-part program will in
clude studies in rhythm, dance
techniques, styles of expression, and
original dance compositions. Nar
rator for Parts I. 11, and 111 will be
Mrs. Miriam Lidster, director of
dance in the women's physical edu
cation department.
Falls, leaps, and turns will be
used to show the basic fundamen
tals of body movement in Part I.
Part II will express the use of var
ious musical components such as
beat, tempo, accent, and meter in
dance movement.
Words, still objects, and musical
forms create the framework for the
choreography of the next four
dances on the program. The two
pieces, "Life Is Peculiar" and "Take
an Anacin," show the building of a
dance upon mere words. "Saw
horses" illustrates the use of props
and still objects in dance, while
"Three Blind Mice" is based on the
familiar musical round.
Part IV will Include polished
compositions incorporating all of
the elements illustrated earlier in
the program. Music for the last
number, "Decoy," was especially
written by Henry Holt, Palo Alto
pianist and director of the Sinfo
r.etta. "Decoy" is a philosophical
treatment of reaction to temptation.
Jeanne Rogers is student director
of the production. Technical direc
tor is Carol Eller and accompanist
will be Anna Rhodes Rogers.
