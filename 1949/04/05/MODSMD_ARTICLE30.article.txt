## NSA at Stanford? 
### 
Excom is faced with the problem of whether or not to continue
financing the local chapter of the National Student Association
(NSA). This year, this group is spending 5776 of ASSU funds, and
Ihe problem is now to determine whether Farm students have
benefited from this expenditure.
Locally, the NSA is a group of students interested in working
as a closely unified organization to improve the general educa
tional standards here in America. Even more, with the idea that
every student has a right to be heard, they are interested inter
nationally in the general world situation.
When the NSA was originated in 1946, it planned to conduct
investigations of faculty dismissals and administrative banning
of visiting speakers, to further scholarship and loan practices, to
set up student government systems and honor code programs
similar to ours at Stanford, to send relief to needy students at
home and abroad, and to organize programs for summer student
travel.
In many colleges, where conditions warranted, the NSA al
ready has made large material gains for the students.
But has the National Student Association actually benefited
ihe students here at Stanford?
Before this organization was adopted by the ASSU, the Insti
tute of International Relations (IIR) and Cardinals handled prob
iems of student travel, the maintenance of student rig'hts, relief
for devastated areas overseas, and other functions that the NSA
planned to cover.
When the Stanford chapter of the NSA was established, it
delegated most of its work to the already operating agencies on
campus. Thus, Cardinals and the lIR merely continued to carry
cut the same functions that they had been doing before the
NSA arrived. The local NSA chapter was left with the job of
.relaying the suggestions of the national headquarters to our lIR
end Cardinals who put acceptable ideas into effect.
Also, here on the Stanford campus, the NSA found that there
.is very little that they can actually improve. We already have
one of the top three honor code systems in the country, and
cur student government is recognized as being extraordinary
j'rom the standpoint of responsibility entrusted to the students.
For the few students who take an active part in the local group,
ihe NSA offers excellent training in leadership and administra
tion, as well as offering an opportunity to rescue them from the
isolation of their campuses.
If the lIR and Cardinals were not already handling the duties
cf the NSA, then there might be a real need for the continuance
cf the local National Student Association chapter. However,
efter observing the present set up, and being unable to find ma
terial evidence to support the plea for the continuance of the
NSA chapter on campus, it is hard to find justification for this
yearly allotment of over $700.

tion, as well as offering an opportunity to rescue them from the
isolation of their campuses.
If the lIR and Cardinals were not already handling the duties
cf the NSA, then there might be a real need for the continuance
cf the local National Student Association chapter. However,
efter observing the present set up, and being unable to find ma
terial evidence to support the plea for the continuance of the
NSA chapter on campus, it is hard to find justification for this
yearly allotment of over $700.
Excom is faced with the problem of whether or not to continue
financing the local chapter of the National Student Association
(NSA). This year, this group is spending 5776 of ASSU funds, and
Ihe problem is now to determine whether Farm students have
benefited from this expenditure.
Locally, the NSA is a group of students interested in working
as a closely unified organization to improve the general educa
tional standards here in America. Even more, with the idea that
every student has a right to be heard, they are interested inter
nationally in the general world situation.
When the NSA was originated in 1946, it planned to conduct
investigations of faculty dismissals and administrative banning
of visiting speakers, to further scholarship and loan practices, to
set up student government systems and honor code programs
similar to ours at Stanford, to send relief to needy students at
home and abroad, and to organize programs for summer student
travel.
In many colleges, where conditions warranted, the NSA al
ready has made large material gains for the students.
But has the National Student Association actually benefited
ihe students here at Stanford?
Before this organization was adopted by the ASSU, the Insti
tute of International Relations (IIR) and Cardinals handled prob
iems of student travel, the maintenance of student rig'hts, relief
for devastated areas overseas, and other functions that the NSA
planned to cover.
When the Stanford chapter of the NSA was established, it
delegated most of its work to the already operating agencies on
campus. Thus, Cardinals and the lIR merely continued to carry
cut the same functions that they had been doing before the
NSA arrived. The local NSA chapter was left with the job of
.relaying the suggestions of the national headquarters to our lIR
end Cardinals who put acceptable ideas into effect.
Also, here on the Stanford campus, the NSA found that there
.is very little that they can actually improve. We already have
one of the top three honor code systems in the country, and
cur student government is recognized as being extraordinary
j'rom the standpoint of responsibility entrusted to the students.
For the few students who take an active part in the local group,
ihe NSA offers excellent training in leadership and administra
tion, as well as offering an opportunity to rescue them from the
isolation of their campuses.
If the lIR and Cardinals were not already handling the duties
cf the NSA, then there might be a real need for the continuance
cf the local National Student Association chapter. However,
efter observing the present set up, and being unable to find ma
terial evidence to support the plea for the continuance of the
NSA chapter on campus, it is hard to find justification for this
yearly allotment of over $700.
