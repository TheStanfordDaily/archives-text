## Bull Session 
### 
This will probably come as a great shock to many of you, but once in a
Ertat while I do have a serious thought. Not too often, you understand,
but occasionally.
In the weeks to come when I have one of my moments of meditation,
I may be so proud of the effort that it will turn up in Bull Session.
What I am driving at, in a low-gearish sort of way, is that from time
to time when I come across things which I think might be of interest to
you, I will attempt to comment on them in a sane manner. Today is one
of those days.
Today's essay is directed towards the radio industry. Other days when
.( choose to write sensibly, the subject may be music, sports, movies, or
practically anything.
The cue for this column on radio was delivered by a satirical gentleman
named "Pat Novak," who "private eyes" for the American Broadcasting
Company, at 9:30 on Sunday evenings. This is, of coarse, the same "Pat
Novak" who scored such a hard-hitting success several years back broad
cwting from S:in Francisco, and then suddenly slipped off the air.
He's l>ack again, as many of you have undoubtedly discovered. Last
Sunday's broadcast was the eighth of a new ABC series.
Ordinarily I am not a radio mystery fan and would not use space in
Bull Session to plug such a program. But this is something a little extra
special. The Novak plots are not extraordinary, but the dialogue is a
show in itself. (Example: "She was the kind of a woman who moved when
she stood still"; or "The bay was a dark as a bruised crow.") Originally
the show was scripted by Lou Hartman of San Francisco. Whether or
nol he is doing this new series, which originates from Hollywood. I don't
know. But whoever puts that dialogue together gets and "E" for "effort"
in my class.
Novak, the cynical Snn Francisco waterfront private detective, is played
by Jack Webb. Raymond Burr, a rising movie toughie who looks very
much like the late Laird Cregar, portrays Inspector Hellman, the not
so-astute S.F. police inspector, liie results are extremely satisfying,
especially ii, like I did, you long ago gave up listening to radio mysteries
because they bored you.
