# Diets Include Dogs, Snakes, Whaleburger

Here in (he Village we cry about
the chow. But it is an American
heritage.
Let's pose u question, though. Can
America really hope to live in peace
in a world where two-thirds of the
people never get enough to eat?
Can famine and plenty exist side
by side?
Half the world's families eat on
less than $4.50 a day. In faet, the
Chinese, who comprise one-fifth of
the world's population, earn on the
average only $1.40 a week. That is
the reason an average of half the
breadwinners of the world earn less
than five American dollars a week.
At one time in Belgium it got so
desperate that people were stealing
cars and selling them for the ex
change of 120 pounds of coffee. Food
had become more valuable than
gold.
In Tibet the natives use butter to
light their lamps. In fact, they use
it lor almost everything—in lamps,
for bathing in winter, in their food,
and in their beverages.
As it is, today's laboratories are
almost 25 years ahead of our use of
foods now being consumed. Science
has perfected and blueprinted a
basic diet costing only $15 a year. It
shows what a lot of things we could
eat that we don't—yet.
The oceans cover thiee-fourths or
more of the earth's surface, but sea
water has produced only one-half of
one per cent of the food we eat.
Yet a single species of sea life will
equal in bulk all the meat animals
in the world.
London was a pioneer in this -field.
Whaleburgers appeared on cafe ta
bles there two years ago. English
men tried it tentatively and found
they liked the mixture of chopped
whale meat with herbs, onions,
bread, and parsley.
Research has found that the yeast
now being wasted could meet the
world's protein needs; that alfalfa is
edible and nourishing; that sulfite,
a waste by-product of paper manu
facture, could also be a valuable
food source.
We eat pigs and think nothing of
it. though that animal lives in filth.
Dogs are much cleaner—why not
cat them? The Chinese used to
raise Chow dogs to eat. (That could
be where the tear "Chow down"
comes from, I suppose.)
And we eat oysters which are even

more unclean than pigs. Worms are
much cleaner, and just as edible.
The Chinese pioneered this field, too.
After the silk has been removed
from the silk worms, they are fried
in butter or lard, mixed with eggs
and seasoned. Vinegar is added to
taste.
The Japanese are enthusiastic
snake eaters. Over 100 retail snake
stores are operative in Tokyo. They
believe baked snake cures tubercu
losis, rheumatism, and cancer.
Even Hollywood has come up with
an answer or two on how to help the
case of hunger incorporated. They
have found a way to save 000,000
pounds of corn flakes for hungry
Europe in just one year. They
merely substitute the navy's new
liquid fire extinguisher in the place
of breakfast cereal in the filming of
their snow scenes.
Still the world has failed to
conqucr hunger. The minions of
the starving are steadily increas
ing their two-to-one majority
over the well-fed of the earth.

they liked the mixture of chopped
whale meat with herbs, onions,
bread, and parsley.
Research has found that the yeast
now being wasted could meet the
world's protein needs; that alfalfa is
edible and nourishing; that sulfite,
a waste by-product of paper manu
facture, could also be a valuable
food source.
We eat pigs and think nothing of
it. though that animal lives in filth.
Dogs are much cleaner—why not
cat them? The Chinese used to
raise Chow dogs to eat. (That could
be where the tear "Chow down"
comes from, I suppose.)
And we eat oysters which are even

more unclean than pigs. Worms are
much cleaner, and just as edible.
The Chinese pioneered this field, too.
After the silk has been removed
from the silk worms, they are fried
in butter or lard, mixed with eggs
and seasoned. Vinegar is added to
taste.
The Japanese are enthusiastic
snake eaters. Over 100 retail snake
stores are operative in Tokyo. They
believe baked snake cures tubercu
losis, rheumatism, and cancer.
Even Hollywood has come up with
an answer or two on how to help the
case of hunger incorporated. They
have found a way to save 000,000
pounds of corn flakes for hungry
Europe in just one year. They
merely substitute the navy's new
liquid fire extinguisher in the place
of breakfast cereal in the filming of
their snow scenes.
Still the world has failed to
conqucr hunger. The minions of
the starving are steadily increas
ing their two-to-one majority
over the well-fed of the earth.
Here in (he Village we cry about
the chow. But it is an American
heritage.
Let's pose u question, though. Can
America really hope to live in peace
in a world where two-thirds of the
people never get enough to eat?
Can famine and plenty exist side
by side?
Half the world's families eat on
less than $4.50 a day. In faet, the
Chinese, who comprise one-fifth of
the world's population, earn on the
average only $1.40 a week. That is
the reason an average of half the
breadwinners of the world earn less
than five American dollars a week.
At one time in Belgium it got so
desperate that people were stealing
cars and selling them for the ex
change of 120 pounds of coffee. Food
had become more valuable than
gold.
In Tibet the natives use butter to
light their lamps. In fact, they use
it lor almost everything—in lamps,
for bathing in winter, in their food,
and in their beverages.
As it is, today's laboratories are
almost 25 years ahead of our use of
foods now being consumed. Science
has perfected and blueprinted a
basic diet costing only $15 a year. It
shows what a lot of things we could
eat that we don't—yet.
The oceans cover thiee-fourths or
more of the earth's surface, but sea
water has produced only one-half of
one per cent of the food we eat.
Yet a single species of sea life will
equal in bulk all the meat animals
in the world.
London was a pioneer in this -field.
Whaleburgers appeared on cafe ta
