WASHINGT O N—The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee is sit
ting on a red-hot report on Nation
alist China.
Those who have had a peek at it
say that it's just about the frankest
kind of State Department statement
that the Nationalist (Chiang Kai
shek) government is on its last legs,
with the Communists in a position
to take over any time they want to
make the big push.
The committee apparently is de
laying release of the document be
cause of fear that it might destroy
the last hope of the Nationalists in
negotiating some kind of peace.
The report is in the form of a
letter from Secretary Acheson, writ
ten in connection with a bill by
Senator McCarran (D., Nev.) which
would give China $1,500,000,000 in
loans.
Committee Chairman Connallv
(D.. Tex.) has introduced an
amendment to the Economic Co
operation Administration (ECA)
bill to make 5M.000.000 available to
President Truman to be used for
China as he sees fit. Connally says
he may make the Acheson letter
public when he discusses this
amendment.
McCarran says the Acheson re
port would "let China go"—with no
effort to bolster the Nationalist
government.
