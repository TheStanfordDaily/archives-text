# Held Elected Captain For UCLA Meet on Saturday
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Bud Held, last year's NCAA champion in the javelin, was
elected captain of the Stanford track team yesterday for the all
.'mportant LiCLA track meet, which will be held at Los Angeles on
Saturdav.

Held, who has thrown over 229 feet in practice, broke the all-

time Stanford record when he
heaved the javelin 224 feet 4 inches
in the Cal-Stanford Relays just a
week and a half ago.
Last year, because of bad weather,
the Cards had to take a rushed trip
;»t the last moment down to UCLA's
windy oval in order to compete in
ihe meet. The rough ride on the
Coaster the night before didn't help
patters much, and the Indians were
swamped by the Bruins, 80 1 - to 5012.
litis year a very close meet is

anticipated. Stanford's inexperi
' enced sophomores of last year have
matured, and are ready to take on
any and all opponents. Bruin su
premacy still reigns in the track
; events, with Stanford favored to win
only the quarter mile and the mile
| relay.
However, the Cards hope to pile
up enough points in the field events
to tide them to victory. Unexpected
seconds and thirds, especially in the
i sprint events, will help turn the tide
in favor of the Indians.

Bud Held, last year's NCAA champion in the javelin, was
elected captain of the Stanford track team yesterday for the all
.'mportant LiCLA track meet, which will be held at Los Angeles on
Saturdav.

Held, who has thrown over 229 feet in practice, broke the all-

time Stanford record when he
heaved the javelin 224 feet 4 inches
in the Cal-Stanford Relays just a
week and a half ago.
Last year, because of bad weather,
the Cards had to take a rushed trip
;»t the last moment down to UCLA's
windy oval in order to compete in
ihe meet. The rough ride on the
Coaster the night before didn't help
patters much, and the Indians were
swamped by the Bruins, 80 1 - to 5012.
litis year a very close meet is

anticipated. Stanford's inexperi
' enced sophomores of last year have
matured, and are ready to take on
any and all opponents. Bruin su
premacy still reigns in the track
; events, with Stanford favored to win
only the quarter mile and the mile
| relay.
However, the Cards hope to pile
up enough points in the field events
to tide them to victory. Unexpected
seconds and thirds, especially in the
i sprint events, will help turn the tide
in favor of the Indians.
