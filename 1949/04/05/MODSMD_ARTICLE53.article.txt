## Poor Hurling Marks Openers 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Inept pitching, poor fielding, and
a general lack of polish character
ized the opening week of Pacific
Coast League baseball. The pitch
ers in particular had a bad week as
base hits were the rule rather than
the exception.
The most miserable exhibition of
pitching occurred in last Friday
night's Port land-San Francisco fias
co when the Beaver hurling staff
issued 20 walks in a game which the
Seals won 20 to 2.
It seems evident that the heavy
rains which fell during the training
period prevented the pitchers from
getting their salary wings itno
shape. At my rate, whatever the
reason, a big improvement is in
order.
Four Out of Six
The Seals managed to win four
out of six from the befuddled Bea
vers, who looked more like circus
performers than baseball players.
Al Lien ol the .Seals and Tommy
Bridges of Portland were the only
hurlers to turn in creditable per
formances.
The Oakland Acorns hardly re
sembled the champs of last year as
they dropped four out of six to an
inspired Sacramento team. The
Oaks staved off complete disaster
by chalking up two one-run vic
tories in Sunday's double-header.
Slow Starters
However, the Oaks are tradition
ally slow starters, and with a little
juggling of manpower should be
pennant contenders.
In the other two series Los Ange
les and Seattle split a six-game se
ries and Hollywood took three out
of five from San Diego.
Ibis week the clubs pair off as
follows: Seattle at San Francisco,
Oak'and at San Diego, Portland at
Los Angeles, and Hollywood at Sac
ramento.
