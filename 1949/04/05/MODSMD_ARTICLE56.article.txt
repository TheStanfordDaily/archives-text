## Bruins Are Getting Used to Victories; But Cards Can Cure Their Win-ism 
### JOHN HALL 
UCLA: UCLA: UCLA:
Once a naive little branch of Berkeley, nestling peacefully in the West
wood Hills, UCLA has become a jam-packed insane asylum in which
tiie State of California is sponsoring a ridiculous contest to see which
can be poured in taster—students or new buildings.
This Public Works Project is a confusing, dangerous, and actually terri
fying place to be.
Communism, Hollywoodism, snootism. and most recently, athleticism,
run wild.
And haidest lor Stanford to swallow is UCLA's latest and most dis
pleasing fad, win-ism.
This win-ism business in Westwood Hollow is no stale sheepdip from
way back. The Bruins just aren't made for winning ballgames.
So when they drop Stanford three straight in basketball and then add
two more in baseball, I get great big tears in my eyes.
The Remedy
But the reason for all this fancy buildup"is simply this: A REMEDY
IS IN SIGHT.
When Stanford s track squad, bolstered by consecutive wins over Cali
fornia and College oi Pacific, goes down to Los Angeles next Saturday,
the 'I like might be able to win its first UCLA meet since 1941.
Ah, 1941. Those were the days when old Stanford practiced this win-ism
stuft. In fact, before that date, the Cards had won seven straight from
Westwood Willie.
But along came 1942, and UCLA began to get its share. From there,
i';tei <t thiee-year pause, the Bruins picked up enough to make it four
straight.
Stanford still leads in series totals, 8 to 4, but it's been a long time
between swigs.
The Cards were getting pretty thirsty even last season, and if it hadn't
been lor a Gay Bryan leg injury, a last-minute schedule change, and my
piediction that Stanford would win. Jack Weiershauser might have
quenched his thirst right then and there.
So now. Larry Hoff, Otis Chandler, Gay Bryan, Bud Held, and A 1 Lyons
a.'e dry as a martini, and ready to gurgle down anything' in sight.
They Like It
But it isn't going to be dandelions and daisies next weekend. UCLA
i.-. getting used to tromping on Stanford. The Bruins like it. In fact,
they love it.
To stop Stanford, UCLA ""will depend upon a superman hurdler, dark
ot hail, nice of looks, name ol Craig Dixon. This Dixon guy goes over
the bariers like a kangaroo. His times, 14-fiat and 22.8, offer a clue
Besides that, he whips off the 100 in 9.8.
1 hat s 15 points right there, except that Dixon doesn't have to woi\"v
about the century because of Jim Work (9.7), a former Stanford boy,
now running for the enemy.
Bruin Taylor Lewis* is another sure five in the discus. He's easily 15
feet better than anything we have.
Miler Roy Balch, 880-man Bob Miller, and two-miler Johnnie Pattce.
all look adequate enough to snag first places for the Bruins to make think*
tougher.
It'll lie Tough
All of which means that Stanford must come through with top efforts
to win the meet.
Gay Bryan will have to be at his best. Larry Hoff must get under
49-flat. Otis Chandler, Lew Davis, and Norm Nourse must sweep the
shot-put.
Bud Held must hit at least 200 feet again in the javelin. The relay
team must go under 3:20, and men such as Ronny Buck, Pitch Johnson.
Diew Terramorse, Al Lyson, Downing McKee, and George Van Heusen
must come through with their best performances to grab off the much
needed place and show money.
C/nly then will Stanford be able to crack UCLA. To put the Bruins
in their proper place. To put Stanford's track name back in the public eye.
It's fioing to be interesting to see what happens.

When Stanford s track squad, bolstered by consecutive wins over Cali
fornia and College oi Pacific, goes down to Los Angeles next Saturday,
the 'I like might be able to win its first UCLA meet since 1941.
Ah, 1941. Those were the days when old Stanford practiced this win-ism
stuft. In fact, before that date, the Cards had won seven straight from
Westwood Willie.
But along came 1942, and UCLA began to get its share. From there,
i';tei <t thiee-year pause, the Bruins picked up enough to make it four
straight.
Stanford still leads in series totals, 8 to 4, but it's been a long time
between swigs.
The Cards were getting pretty thirsty even last season, and if it hadn't
been lor a Gay Bryan leg injury, a last-minute schedule change, and my
piediction that Stanford would win. Jack Weiershauser might have
quenched his thirst right then and there.
So now. Larry Hoff, Otis Chandler, Gay Bryan, Bud Held, and A 1 Lyons
a.'e dry as a martini, and ready to gurgle down anything' in sight.
They Like It
But it isn't going to be dandelions and daisies next weekend. UCLA
i.-. getting used to tromping on Stanford. The Bruins like it. In fact,
they love it.
To stop Stanford, UCLA ""will depend upon a superman hurdler, dark
ot hail, nice of looks, name ol Craig Dixon. This Dixon guy goes over
the bariers like a kangaroo. His times, 14-fiat and 22.8, offer a clue
Besides that, he whips off the 100 in 9.8.
1 hat s 15 points right there, except that Dixon doesn't have to woi\"v
about the century because of Jim Work (9.7), a former Stanford boy,
now running for the enemy.
Bruin Taylor Lewis* is another sure five in the discus. He's easily 15
feet better than anything we have.
Miler Roy Balch, 880-man Bob Miller, and two-miler Johnnie Pattce.
all look adequate enough to snag first places for the Bruins to make think*
tougher.
It'll lie Tough
All of which means that Stanford must come through with top efforts
to win the meet.
Gay Bryan will have to be at his best. Larry Hoff must get under
49-flat. Otis Chandler, Lew Davis, and Norm Nourse must sweep the
shot-put.
Bud Held must hit at least 200 feet again in the javelin. The relay
team must go under 3:20, and men such as Ronny Buck, Pitch Johnson.
Diew Terramorse, Al Lyson, Downing McKee, and George Van Heusen
must come through with their best performances to grab off the much
needed place and show money.
C/nly then will Stanford be able to crack UCLA. To put the Bruins
in their proper place. To put Stanford's track name back in the public eye.
It's fioing to be interesting to see what happens.

UCLA: UCLA: UCLA:
Once a naive little branch of Berkeley, nestling peacefully in the West
wood Hills, UCLA has become a jam-packed insane asylum in which
tiie State of California is sponsoring a ridiculous contest to see which
can be poured in taster—students or new buildings.
This Public Works Project is a confusing, dangerous, and actually terri
fying place to be.
Communism, Hollywoodism, snootism. and most recently, athleticism,
run wild.
And haidest lor Stanford to swallow is UCLA's latest and most dis
pleasing fad, win-ism.
This win-ism business in Westwood Hollow is no stale sheepdip from
way back. The Bruins just aren't made for winning ballgames.
So when they drop Stanford three straight in basketball and then add
two more in baseball, I get great big tears in my eyes.
