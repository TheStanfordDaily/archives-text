### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Larrtipin* Lloyd Arrives
This spring's Grapefruit League dispatches from the southlands have
been attaching,' some mighty fine superlatives to the name of Lloyd Mer
riman, former Farm grid and diamond great who chose riches over campus
glory.
Lloyd appears have clinched the regular center-field berth for th<
Cincinnati Reds on the basis of his work in early games, and few Stan
fcrdites who saw Merriman perform on the Sunken Diamond are surprised
by his rapid rise to big league status. The merry one has speed to burn,
owns a bullet throwing arm. and proved he can hit big league pitching'
by blasting two home runs in the Reds' first few spring contests.
How on Gonna Keep "em Down on ili<Â» Farm?
Mystery of the month concerns the highly-touted frosh sprinter. Howard
Bugbee, who dropped out of school just prior to the opening of the current
track season. Howard's the lad who created so much furor last year by
getting himself clocked in 9.f> seconds in the 100 while performing' for
a southland high school. Needless to say, he was billed for the starring
role on Ray Dean s yearling crew of speedsters before the mysterious
fade-out.
According to columnist Art Rosenbaum of the green sheet, the Man
hattan Beach flash was forced to leave the Farm because of some unjudi
cious water-bagging. That one is a little hard to figure: if all our water
b.iggers were given the heave-ho, Stanford would be perennially minus
a freshman class.
Spare-Bar ami All
We've seen a few track meets in our time, but the finish of the Fresh
man-Modesto mile relay event Saturday morning was the closest yet.
l'.osh McCamant and Modesto s Booth came down the home stretch of
th. final lap making like a pair of Siamese twins all the way; and if
McCamant won it by more than two inches, I'll eat my typewriter"
