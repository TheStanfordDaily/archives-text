# Woltermen, Mustangs to Clash Today
## Card Batmen Seek Revenge For Early Season Humiliation 
### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's varsity baseballers, 12 to 3 victors over their arch
rivals from the University of California last Saturday, will attempt
to settle another score this afternoon v/hen they collide with
the Cal Poly Mustangs on the Sunken Diamond.
The Indians will be out to avenge an early season, 5 to 3, loss to

the Mustangs, with action slated to
get under way promptly at 3:15.
Playing on a wet, windy day at
San Luis Obispo during their vaca
tion road trip south, the Cards were
upset victims of Cal Poly's first ma
jor sport win in history over a PCC
team; and there's nothing' Captain
Bill Arce's squad would rather do
than gain revenge by blasting the
2C2A-League nine right off the dia
mond.
Mustang Coach Bob Mott will
probably start either of his ace
chuckers, Don German or Johnny
Williams, although reliefer Russ
Christenson is ready to go and may
get the starting nod. Christenson
pulled the Mustangs out of a sev
enth-inning jam and pitched airtight
relief ball thereafter to get credit
tor the earlier victory over the In
dians. 112
Rangy sophomore Jim Claypool
will probably go to the hill for the
Cards, with curve-balling Frank
Laßrum ready in ease Claypool fal
ters. All of the Indian hurlers are
rested and set to go except for
southpaw Dave Dahle, who toiled
nine innings against Cal.
Coach Wolter s pitching plans in

elude sending Dave Stott and or
Jack Heinen against tine league
leading S; nta Clara Broncos tomor
row and having Dahle ready to go
against either Loyola on Friday or
LSF on Saturday.
Good news was in store for Coach
Harry Wolter yesterday afternoon
when his starting rij.ht fielder Blast
ing Bob Nava reported for practice
completely recovered from his re
cent ailments and ready to go at
full speed for the first time in sev
eral weeks. The big outfielder was
suffering irom a touch of stomach
trouble on the vacation road trip,
and the curing penicillin shots made
his feet swell so much he couldn't
run on them.
Nava will return to his starting
right field berth this afternoon—
once again bringing the Cards' blue
ribbon outfield of Nava in right,
Consistent Charlie Cole in center,
and Bud Klein in left, to top
strength.
The Card infield was bolstered
last week when veteran second
sacker Jim Mason returned to the
squad after sitting out a quarter of
scholastic ineligibility.
