# Spring Grid Commences
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Some 110 grid aspirants were on
hand yesterday when Coach Mar
chie Schwartz opened the 1949
spring practice session with an !
hour-long chalk talk.
Though the meeting counted as j
one of the 30 days of practice sl
owed under PCC rules, Schwartz
told the footballers that lie thought i
it important that the squad have
the chance to meet the assistant
coaches and learn what was to come j
in the way of practices.
He then introduced the eight as- !
sistant coaches. In addition to the
regular staff of Phil Bengtson, Ray j
Hammett, Chuck Taylor, Mai El
ward, and Bill Fehring, Schwartz ;
will have the services of Frankie
Albert, Jim Cox, and Dick Madigan
for the spring drills.
Six a Week
The Card headman promised the :
gridders hard work in the five I
weeks of six-a-week practices. He j
said that he would give out but six
or eight basic plays and added that j
some of them would be single wing. |
The squad wi.i receive tetanus
-hots today to ward off any chance |
that the men might pick up the dis
ease from the practice field. It was \
once a part of the ROTC cavalry j
grounds.
Tomorrow the actual field work
begins with the first scrimmage ;
scheduled for Saturday morning.
Schwartz plans to hold three bis !
intra-squad games — April 16 and,
,'!0 and May 13, the final session— |
with regular officials handling them. I
Mitch Masterminding
Emery Mitchell, 1948 regular •
fullback until he was injured in the \
Army game, wil be out for the \
spring sessions though he will not <
participate in contact work. Mitch- j
ell will play from the quarterback
spot. Another injured Card, Don |
Campbell, is expected to be on hand j
next fall for drop-kicking duties.
As it now appears, about 20 of 33
lettermen will be out for spring !
ball. Twenty-five award winners l
are listed as eligible for further play I
but some will be out for other 1
sports at this time of the vear.
