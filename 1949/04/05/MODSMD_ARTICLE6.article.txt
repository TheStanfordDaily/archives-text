# Foreign Ministers' Signatures Make Atlantic Pact a Reality
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 4 (.I 1 ). —
Amid solemn diplomatic pageantry,
12 North Atlantic nations today
signed a treaty designed to confront
any Rusian aggression with a
united defense.
After hearing President Truman
hail it as a "shield against aggres
sion." the foreign ministers stepped
up one by one to put their names
to the historic, 1.040-word pact.
Previously they, like Mr. Truman,
had proclaimed to Russia and all
the world that their only purpose
was peace and security.
But several of them added blunt
warnings to any nation contemplat
ing violence.
Projecting the defense frontiers
of America into the heart of Eu
rope, the treaty would pledge all
12 nations to take measures to re
sist an attack on any of them. It

becomes effective only when rati
fied by the United States and six
od'.er original sponsors. These are j
Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, I
the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. !
Mr. Truman termed ''absolutely |
untrue the charge that the treaty is !
aggressive in intent, a charge which !
Russia made in formal notes on the •
eve of signing.
"Hie pact will be a positive, not a
negative influence for peace, and |
its influence will be felt not only in
the area it specifically covers, but .
throughout the world,'; he declared.
"Twice in recent years, nations
have felt sickening blow of im- !
provoked aggression," he went on. i
"Our peoples, to whom our gov- i
ernments are responsible, demand
that these things shall not happen j
again. We are determined that they j
shall not happen again."
