# Radio Gear Sought For Danish 'Ham'
## 
### 
Would you like to help a fellow
radio amateur in Denmark? The
Stanford Radio Club is holding a
meeting in room 283, Engineering
corner, at tonight for the pur
pose of collecting radio parts for a
Denmark amateur.
A Stanford medical student met
the young man last summer and has
relayed his needs. He already has
his license, and his transmitter is
about three-fourths finished. How
about it? Do you have any surplus
gear that you'd part with to get an
other European station on the air?
