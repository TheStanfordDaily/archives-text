If a Communist teacher cannot be objective in his presen
tation, he is almost by definition precluded from the classroom,
Dr. Wallace Sterling stated yesterday morning at his first press
conference after taking over Stanford's presidency. 1
Speaking before representatives of newspapers and wire
services, Dr. Sterling outlined his i â€”

ideas on Stanford's reputation, its
standards, and its dealings with
Communists.
"I doubt if any member of the
Communist Party is a free agent,"
he continued. "If he isn't a free
agent, he cannot be objective in his
teaching. Therefore, he should be

precluded lrom classroom presen
tation.
'Communism is a real menace in
the world.'' Dr. Sterling said. "We
can only hope that the people con
lronted with the responsibility of
combating it, understand it.
Damnation Not Enough
"I doubt if mere damnation of
dynamite can destroy it. We will
have to demonstrate that our sys
tem of government can do more for
the individual than other systems."
Dr. Sterling, once a football, base
ball. and basketball player, said that
he didn't think Stanford would "put
greater emphasis on athletics" under
his regime.
"Es'erybody, of course, is always
hoping to improve the quality all
along the line," he added.
The 42-year-old historian went on
to discuss the size of American col
lets and curriculum.
"The universities are getting too
large. - ' he said, "and the numbers
make it more difficult to maintain
quality. A pressure exists between
the desire to permit the greatest
number of young people to get an
education and, at the same time,
maintain high standards.
Is Fifth President
Dr. Sterling, Canadian-born but
now a United States citizen, came
to Stanford from the office of the
Director of the Henry E. Huntington
Library and Art Gallery in San
Marino. He is Stanford's fifth presi
dent. succeeding Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, who died last year.
As to future Stanford policy, Dr.
Sterling said. "I have not yet had
opportunity to do my homework as
president of Stanford University, so
it would be presumptuous of me to
make any substantive statement of
policy at this time.
"I am aware, however, of a num
ber of things about the University
which justify pride in my former
and new Stanford associations. Tho
distinctions of its faculty and the
quality of its student body and aca
demic standards have won for it a
deservedly high reputation as an
institution of higher learning."


I)It. J. E. WALLACE STEELING, new president of Stanford, met the
press yesterday morning on his first day in his position as head of the
University.
