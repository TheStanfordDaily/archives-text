# Dance Concert Sets New Note To Music Form
## 
### 
Sawhorses, mice, spiders, and lep
rechauns helped set the form har
mony, tempo, and composition of
the modern dance concert last
night. Members of Orchesis, mod
ern dance society, prepared original
choreography, costumes, and light
ing for the program.
Audience reaction was keyed for
the styles of expression in Part 111
of the lecture-concert. "Lite Is Pe
culiar" and "Take an Anacin" used
words as a medium. "Three Blind
Mice" used musical form, and
"Sawhorses" employed still objects.
"There Is a System" and "Decoy"
seemed the high points of Part IV.
Both numbers were polished com
positions incorporating all the tech
niques demonstrated earlier in the
urogram. Lighting effects by Dick
Hay and Bill Kibby also sparked
the staging of the finished dances.
Stage settings were deliberately
severe and the costumes subordi
nate to the mood of the dance. Once
the audience was so hushed that a
baby's gurgle of pleasure or be
wilderment, it's hard to say which,
sounded like a coxswain's call to
his crew. —B. M.
