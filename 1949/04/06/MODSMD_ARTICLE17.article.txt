# Man and Superman' Is Based On Old 'Deadly Female' Adage
## 
### 
"The female of the species is
deadlier than the male" is the old
adage on which "Man and Super
man," now playing at the Curran
Theater, is based.
Maurice Evans' revival of G. B.
Shaw's battle of the sexes (vintage
1901) is a sparkling production in
which Mr. Evans is the shining star.
Only at the end of the second act
and during parts of the third do
the witly Shavianisms of the 1000's
lack luster. Where Shaw's sophis
tication turns to melodrama the
play loses interest.
Maurice Evans as Jack Tanner,
author of the "Revolutionist's Hand
book," delivers Shaw's pithiest lines
in excellent style. Frances Howe as
Ann Whitefield, the woman who is
out -to marry Tanner, does as well
as the part allows. Shaw is rarely
at his best when he deals wtih
women. Malcolm Keen as Roebuck
Ramsden, ultra-conservative guard
ian of Frances Rowe, was rather
disappointing at first, although he
warmed to his part as the play went
on. Morton DnCosta in the bit part
of a chauffeur lends vitality to a
sagging portion of the second act.
The Superman of Shaw's play is
missing. Evans has left out the
witty though lengthy act which
takes place in Hell, although he in
corporates parts of it into first-act
speeches. To your reviewer's think
ing the cut act contains some of
Shaw's wittiest passages.
Even the talkiest parts of "Man
and Superman," long speeches be
tween leading characters, rarely
drag, partly because of Evans' per
sonality. "Man and Superman," vin
tage 1949, still surpasses most cur
rent humorous plays.—AML
