Well, according to my desk calendar, the sun has come up 96 times and
has gone down 95 so far in the year 1949. That means today must be
the Gth of April.
Thus far, 1949 hasn't oflered the natives any particularly startling de- ;
volopments. The Stanford ratio is still approximately three men to each
woman, and the University of California ratio remains at two to one. j
Two baboons to one human being.

Prosperity has disappeared during the first months of 1949. Not even
the land offices are doing a land office business. The automobile dealers
are no longer insisting that their customers buy unwanted accessories j
for their new cars. This came as quite a blow to the manufacturers of i
Kleenex dispensers.
My father made more money last year than ever before. But the Trea
sury Department confiscated his press.

Radio is still using the singing commercial, and its selling record is
11 100 per cent. So far not one person has even admitted buying a
pioduct advertised via the singing l commercial.
Other radio commercials are still making exorbitant claims about the
rr.erits of their products. 1 heard a hair tonic commercial the other day
and decided to try "the fingernail test." My scalp was all right, but four
cl" my fingernails dropped off.

A new deodorant has hit the market. It is called "Veto." Competitors
are planning a whispering campaign claiming that the new company is
headed by Andrei Vishinsky.

Vaughn Monroe, the frog with a man in his throat, still sounds like he's
singing from the bottom of a 50-foot well.

Soap operas are still telling the simple story of that lovable average
American wife, who. despite four marriages, two murders, and seven trips
around the world, is still just a fresh, unspoiled girl.

The international situation hasn't gotten any better during 1949. Russia ,
Is still offering its citizens an introductory course in Soviet government
called Political Silence I.•.;<

People are still trying to remember which months have how many days
in them. Spike Jones has solved that problem with the poem which
appears in his record of "Liebestraum."
Thirty days hacienda,
April. June, and sombrero.
All of the rest have 31,
Except my uncle, who got life.
