## Thank You Note

To the Editor:
As the day of my departure from campus approaches, I feel I should
try to express my gratitude and appreciation. During my stay of nearly
two years I have received nothing but only kindness, sympathy, considera
tion, and understanding. To mention only a few in person, I must express
my gratitude to Dean Kimpton, Messrs. Beatty and Waterous of the
administration, Dean Jackson, Dr. Hailey, and all other members of the
faculty of the graduate school of business and the department of eco
nomics. In spite of my scores of utter stupidity, they have been very
patient and kind to me. I do not know if I could expect the same con
sideration even in my own country. I think every other foreign student
has this same experience as I do.
During this period, I had the privilege of working with a committee of
lIE for the purpose of investigating the possibilities of having an interna
tional house on campus. The committee has arrived at certain conclu
sions and its suggestions will be put before the Board of Trustees, the
administration, and the student body. Let me hope that the project, the
Tiesidder Memorial International Union, as shall be suggested by the
committee, will have the full support and cooperation of all concerned.
America—despite your follies, I love thee—not merely for your bounti
ful resources and great wealth, but more for your people.
1 shall take this opportunity to thank my friends for everything and
Say goodbye.
SUSHIL R. GUHA
