# Stanford Wrestling

To the Editor:
As far as I know, Chuck Taylor did not coach wrestling' autumn and
winter quarters of this year. This job was handled by Winston Mumby,
who wjts free as a bird then and is probably still available.
It is not because of lack of coaching that wrestling is not offered during
spring quarter.
Jt seems 1o me that wrestling is tolerated, rather than encouraged at
Stanford. Consequently, there is little space available, only student
ccaches, and a poor turn out. Wrestling is a good sport and I, as well as
many others, would like to see more attention and enthusiasm given to
the wrestling team in the future.
Wrestling is given in most other colleges, such as Cal, San Jose State, and
Cal Poly, every quarter. This is necessary in order to keep these teams in
good shape and trainingâ€”a situation which puts Stanford at a big dis
advantage.
