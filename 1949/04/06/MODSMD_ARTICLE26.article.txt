# Life Reports On Changing College Youth
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Mature, realistic, with a deep and
humble sense of the urgency of to- j
morow, the college youth of today ■)
is almost a completely different per
son from his predecessors of the
flaming '20s and the radical '30s.
Writer John McPartland, in his
article "Intercollegiate Bull Session" I
published in the March 28 issue of
Life Magazine, portrays today's col
lege generation as a group of sensi- j
ble young men with ideas of their {
own on jobs, education, religion,
sex Marxian economics, America,
and the future of the human race.
The typical college senior in 1949,
according to McPartland, is shoot
ing for a secure position with ji
large corporation upon graduation.
Organization Needed
"The important thing is the organ
ization,"' says one person that he
interviewed.
"The individual is nowhere with
out it. Who wants to be nowhere?
So you figure out how to fit in."
Gone are the fortune seekers of
'29. out after the big money—hoping j
to be millionaires before '30. Also
gone are the pipesmokers of '39 with
their applications in at a Washing
ton bureau.
College men agree that all uni
versities are now becoming high
powered trade schools, and that
about a third of the men are en
rolled in outright technical courses 1
while the other two-thirds are be
coming specialists in one general
course.
One college editor views today's
universities as West Points for big
business:
"Seniors want to graduate directly
into jobs as second lieutenants with
U.S. Steel or DuPont or some such
an.l retire on a coloncl's pension 30
years later."
Cross-Country Survey
To gather these and other views
which men invariably express when
they draw together for informal bull
sessions. Life Correspondent Mc-
Partland toured the nation's cam
puses talking with students, educat
ors, and administrators alike.
His report, which is in a sense a
cross-country bull session, discloses
an entirely new college generation—
one which has little regard for the
accumulated opinions of the past,
and one which the educators admit
they do not understand.
The Gls have probably made the
big difference, but even after they're
gone the professors may have to
admit that universities are in a new
situation with respect to their stu
dents. A closer relationship between
student and teacher, and a new
measurement of the value of sub
jects taught are problems which now
face the universities.

Cross-Country Survey

His report, which is in a sense a
cross-country bull session, discloses
an entirely new college generation—
one which has little regard for the
accumulated opinions of the past,
and one which the educators admit
they do not understand.
The Gls have probably made the
big difference, but even after they're

admit that universities are in a new

face the universities.
