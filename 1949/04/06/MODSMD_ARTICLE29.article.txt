# Stanford in Spring
## 
### TOM SHAWVER 
Harvard University has an en
dowment of well over $175 million.
The University of Minnesota boasts
a faculty more populous than the
whole town of Carmel. But back at
Cambridge the gentlemen ol the
E.ist are still sloshing through melt
ing snow and ugly-looking mud
holes, while in Minneapolis anyone
who musters the nerve to walk to
an 8 o'clock without a windbreaker
or overcoat on his back is either
crazy or a member of the Twin
Cities Polar Bear Club.
Not so at Leland Stanford Junior
University, for here in the Peninsula
area of Northern California, the
hills are green as St. Patrick's Day
and the air as warm and balmy as
anything offered by a Florida
Chamber of Commerce.
Here, it's "Stanford in Spring," the
season that a few years ago inspired
student Bob Mallett to write a popu
lar song of Lagunita by moonlight
and the Inner Quad on an April eve
ning with the chimes of the old bell
tower ringing out the twilight hour.
Few of the thousands of men and
women who have attended Stanford
in years past will ever think of the
o!d alma mater without recalling
the incomparable beauty of a Stan
ford springtime.
Signs of Spring
This year is no different.
Now the sap is beginning to run
hot again in the veins of young
Stanford manhood as nature, birds,
bees and Dr. Arnold Kinsey com
bine forces to set into motion the
mechanics of Biology 111. Fraternity
pins blossom out 011 female sweaters,
Bendix washers are filled with red
stained handkerchiefs, and deep
growls of frustration emerge from
the darkness of local theaters as
Hollywood sexites sing throijty ver
sions of "I've Got My Love to Keep
Me Warm."
Last Thursday evening after being
confined to indoor recreation by a
six-week spell of winter quarter
rains, Storey House girls and neigh
boring fraternity men unofficially
opened spring quarter revelry by
reviving the ancient and enjoyable
sport of "kick the can." A member
of the "hide-and-seek" family of
outside games, it involves one used
can mixed with lots of screaming
and yelling and a special lingo that
defies any definition.
Age Not a Factor
One of the most disturbing sights
of the evening was the spectacle of
a 100-pound pre-law student and
ex-Marine with 18 months overseas
duty standing with one foot on the
can and bellowing "olly-olly-otts
in-free-e-e." Translated that meant
that all the boys and girls could

''come home free" *o that a new
game could begin. Kibitzers inside
Row houses spurned Poly Sci as
signments in order to shower par
ticipants with water bags.
Another springtime sport inspired
by California weather is especially
popular at Emilio Rossotti's beer
garden and picnic grounds where
the inside rooms, crowded in Febru
ary, are now abandoned in favor of
the weather-beaten tables outside.
The game is known as "beer-ball."
Equipment includes a non-regula
tion baseball diamond, an unlimited
number of players, and quart bottles
(preferably full) of any brand of
western beer. When the man at bat
hits the tall, he is handed a bottle
of beer, which he must carry with
him throughout the circuit of bases.
Whether it is drunk or not is im
material, as the beverage is nor
mally wasted as ammunition. Wait
ing at the bases are members of the
oposing team who douse the runner
with beer as he rounds each base.
No score is kept and everybody has
a grand time—or so they say.
Lag's Evidence
Over behind Roble Hall the hardi
est swimmers of the campus are al
ready braving the chilly waters of
Lake Lagunita. Compensation is of
fered ■by an early-season preview
of female swim suits which in
France have been daringly different
for more than two years. Whether
the style will catch the fancy of
local beauties remains to be seen;
Lake Lagunita has been devoid of
water the same length of time.
On the lawn of Enema, on the
sunporehes and roofs ot dormitories
and Row houses, beside the swim
ming pools of the men's and wom
en's gyms the inevitable sunbathers
are coating necks and arms with
baby oil and sun-tan lotion. Stu
dents from Southern California
don't know what it means to go
back home to Fargo in June with the
melba-toast skin and sun-bleached
hair that North Dakota students
don't have until August.
Profs Ignorant
In the classrooms, though, the
professors drone on as if nothing
had happened, all dutifully bringing
home the bacon and substantiating
the reasons for last year's SIOO tui
tion increase. One economics stu
dent. amazed at his professor's ap
parent indifference to the spring
outside, offered a possible solution
to the universal urge to abandon
textbooks this quarter:
"Give all those profs a bouquet
of lilacs and a couple of hormone
shots." he said, "and right now I'd
be covered with sand down at Rio
del Mar playing 'Hawaiian War
Chant' on my ukelele.*'
