## 
### SHIRLEY ELLSWORTH 
Stanford roughs and coeds will return to the "good old days"
;his Wednesday for the third time in Stanford history as they
don old-fashioned costumes for the day.
Originating in 1940, Back to the Farm Week consisted of
:hree special days during the first week of March. In 1941 the

•ccasion was reduced from a week
to a single day and was celebrated
s the last day of Convalescent
Home Week.
Discontinued during the war
• ears, Back to the Farm, both as a
particular we&k and as one specific
ay, is being revived and will be
held for the first time in eight years.
Shaughnessy Day opened the
•three-day celebration of Back to
the Farm Week in 1940. That, day
Clark Shaughnessy, new football
coach, made his first public address
before Stanford students.
Hello Day
Hello Day, which fell on Friday,
was loaded with a full day and
evening of fun. The event was ded
icated to "the betterment of Stan
ford fellowship."
Old-fashioned costumes on cam
pus were a must for the day. "No-
Gun" Nicoll and his 30-man vigi
lante committee patrolled the Uni
versity to see that everyone was
properly decked out. Offenders who
i ailed to comply with costume reg
ulations ran the risk of being tossed
'into jail in front of the library for
]5 minutes.
Campus - wide exchange lunches
..■•to planned for noon. After lunch
ITobleites vied for first place in a
valking contest to Encina via a
oute laid out over Quad. The girls
.ere carefully watched to see that
'hey walked and did not break into
a trot.
No Motor Vehicles
No mutor - driven vehicles were
• 1 lowed on campus for the day.
rloads to the University were
■locked to all gasoline transporta
:ion. and the Row was roped off.
Horses and bicycles, however, were
permitted on campus and around
Quad. A prize was offered to the
student with the means of transpor
tation most in keeping with the
spirit of the Gay 90 s.
To climax Hello Day's festivities,
students attended the "500" Dance,
which featured a student - chosen
Hit Parade of 10 favorite old-time
tunes. Prizes were awarded for the
>est old-fashioned costumes. Since
no gasoline transportation was al
lowed. a horse and buggy was rent
- d by several couples to get to the
dance.
Founders' Day
Founders' Day, concluding the
week's activities, was celebrated by
n all-campus picnic supper at the
■oathouse. Earlier in the afternoon

the winner of the bearcl-growing
contest was chosen.
Just before the week officially got
under way, Cellar hashers one noon
chose to interpret 'back to the farm"
to mean just that. They appeared
to take orders in stockingless feet
and with ties but no shirts, mean
while puffing on corn-cob pipes.
In 3941 us the conclusion of Con
Home Week, Back to the Farm Day
was patterned on the 1940 Hello
Day. Cars were banned as before,
and all campus roads were closed.
Exchange lunches and a Gay 90's
costume ball that evening rounded
out the festivities.
Old-fashioned Clothes
Old-fashioned garb to be worn
all day long was of course a re
quirement. Some of the "rustic old
costumes" took such extreme forms
as old-fashioned women's bathing
suits with long black tockings. Big
hair bows for coeds and handlebar
mustaches for roughs were officially
recommended as contributing to a
proper appearance.
Once again some literal - minded
individuals devised their own in
terpretation of "back to the farm."
The men were attired in jeans or
coveralls and ragged shirts while
the gals donned faded wash dresses,
braided their hair, and penciled on
freckles.
Back to the Farm Day today is
one of the main features of the
week. It will see the revival of
many traditions established before
the war as Stanford students revert
50 vears into the past.
