### 
Members of the class of '52 are
washing their feet In preparation
for the annual freshman Barefoot
Day to be observed tomorrow.
In addition to the bare feet, men
should wear plaid shirts and levis,
nd straw hats if posible. Women
..re also expected to go shoeless, but
the rest of their costume is left to
their own ingenuity.
Mike Murphy, Traditions Day
chairman, urges both men and
women to get in the spirit of things
nd brave Quad gravel and oiled
roads.
