Lack of JC Transfers Noticeable
As Gridders Begin Spring Drills

This afternoon some 110 football players begin a 29-day practice ses
sion that should tell Head Coach Marchie Schwartz just what material
he will have to work with next fall.
Already the changes from last spring are noticeable. When the squad
gathers around Schwartz before commencing work today, there will be
no more than three or four junior college transfers. Last year there were
ntwcomers such as Ken Rose, Don Enberg, Jim Castignoli, Emery Mitchell.
Bud Klein, etc. All of these men added materially to the strength of
the 1948 team —all were junior college transfers.
But the war-caused rush that sent many veterans to junior colleges
while awaiting college acceptance has died away and with it has died
a fine source of grid material that took little conditioning to make the
college grade.
While it is true that good football players will continue to come out
of junior colleges, the rush has subsided and a mere trickle is all that
remains. The schools with the high-salaried jobs and scholarships will
pick up the Hugh McElhennys and the like and the rest will go where
they may.

Few Newcomers Expected

All of which is to say that the men that are on the field today, with
a few notable exceptions, will make up the team that Schwartz fields
against San Jose State in the season's opener.
Ol course it is possible that another Bob White will show up on the
first of September and ask to play football. But the coaches cannot plan
on such happenings.
Most of the Card gridders have recognized the need for spring practice
and are turning out. The two notable exceptions, Jim Castignoli and
Bud Klein, have found a spot on the baseball team and will stay out
lor that sport. Both will have to work to make the team next fall.
As it looks now, only the two remaining first string tackles, A 1 Rau
and Gordon White, can claim their position with any degree of certainty.
The rest are wide open.
Marchie will have to find his other regulars from among the returning
varsity members and last year's frosh. That fact alone should make for
a hustling bunch of ball players. Some of the boys will win their jobs
oft their showing during the next 29 practice sessions.

Van Brocklin Gone, But...

The word is out that Norm Van Brock lin has turned pro. If so, and
there is every reason to believe that he has been signed for some time,
tl o sporting public will be quick to discount Oregon's chances of re
peating its co-win of the PCC. But word from the Northland has it
that in sophomore Jim Calderwood, Coach Jim Aiken has a quarterback
that will make the most ardent Duck fan forget the All-American.
People who know say that Calderwood can not only pass as well as
the Van Brocklin, but can also handle himself and the ball much better.
If this is true, the Ducks may well turn up with a top flight team again.
Aiken is a shrewd coach to say the least, and he will miss only 12 letter
nien from last years team. Much as the Indian gridders may want to
get back at Oregon for last year's 20 to 12 loss; it may be just as well
that the Ducks are not on the Indians' schedule for the coming season.

50 —'Count 'em —.50

Right after figuring out the reason for the lack of junior college trans
fers at Stanford this quarter, I ran across a story that had as a headline.
"50 JC Stars Will Try For 1949 Team." No, it referred to neither USC
or Washington, but to a school that has received nothing but bumps
on the head while playing Stanford—San Jose State.
Every year the Spartans come to the Farm with fire in their eyes.
A win over Stanford puts them in the big' time, regardless what Stan
ford's win-loss record reads at the time. And year after year they lose.
This year they beat the Cards in every way but the final score in two
sports—football and basketball. The Indians lucked out in both contests.
But with 50, count 'em 50, junior college transfers to throw into the
battle, things may be a wee bit different come September 17.
