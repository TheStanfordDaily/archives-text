# Indians Host Favored Broncos Today
## Card Mine Meets Santa Clara After 6 to 5 Win Over Cal Poly 
### BILL SWIGART 
Card shortstop Dave Melton's long fly ball to center field in
the 11th inning drove in the deciding run that gave the Indians
a 6 to 5 victory over the Cal Poly Mustangs yesterday afternoon
in their last warmup game before the Indians take on the
powerful Santa Clara Broncos in a crucial CIBA contest today.

The Indians will lock horns with
the California Intercollegiate Base
ball Association favorites on the
Sunken Diamond this afternoon at
"i: 15. Righthander Dave Stott will
start on the hill for Stanford, while
Br mc Coach "Patty" Cottiell has
nominated his ace righthander, Don
Keith.
The Indians were slow in getting
started again yesterday, spotting the
visiting San Luis Obispo nine a
five-run lead in the first three
frames, before they finally exploded
in the fifth to tie up the contest.
Frank MacGraw's smashing triple
that rolled all the way to the deep
left centerfield wall, drove across to
runs to spark the attack.
Laßrum Doesn't Last
Neither of the starters went the
full distance—Frank Laßrum was
lifted for a pinchhitter in the fifth

inning alter giving up five runs and
five hits to the Mustang batters, and
Cal Puly's Johnny Williams was
driven to cover in the wild and
wooly fifth.
Rangy Jim Claypool, who pitched
airtight relief ball over the rest of
the route, was credited with the win.
Claypool's fastball was never better
as he set the Mustangs down on
three hits during the six innings
that he worked. Russ Christenson,
winner of Cal Poly's earlier 5 to 3
win over Stanford, was given the
loss.
Inability to hit with men on bases
almost scuttled the Cards again.
Th ree times in the early innings,
the last Card batter went down on
an easy chance, while his mates
were jamming the sacks. Coach
Harry Wolter's redshirted Indians
will have to pick up on their clutch
hitting if they are to have a chance
against Santa Clara today.
Broncs Dust Trojans
The Broncos, picking up speed
with every step, just finished dust
ing off LSC's defending champs in
a two-game series in the Southland.
Led by their hard hitting short
stop, Harvey Toso, Santa Clara
boasts a trio of long ball hitters
who would give any pitcher the
heebie-jeebies. Tom Kelly, who |
was switched from the outfield to
cover first base, is noted for his
devastating power and ability to

; come through in the clutch. He
; rates the second slot.
Number three man in the Bronco
hit parade is footballer Bill Renna.
Center-fielder Renna can shake
i sticks with the best of them.
When Toso. Kelly, and Renna take
i their cuts, danger rides with every
pitch. These men combined to lead
I Santa Clara into second place in the
league last season, and the advance
! word is that they are even better
j this season.
Prentice and Christenson Gone
Only men missing from the Broncs
i of last season are Bill Prentice and
Harvey Christenson, both of whom
caught the eye of Sunken Diamond
| fans.
Backing up the big three are
I sophomore Lou Berberet, a terrific
j hitter with a bright future in the
j backstopping department; Bob Fer
| rari, the slickest fielding third
| sacker in the CIBA; Charles Bedolla
; and Joe Nally in the outfield to
; Hank Renna; and Bob Nard, a vet
| eran second baseman who knows all
! the ropes.
i On top of that, the Broncos own
the best relief pitching staff in the
loop. Ready to follow starter Keith
to the hill are Galen Norquist, Dave
Smith, and Hal Toso, all boys who
j have fooled the Cards in previous [
games.
They have been hailed as the
definite team to beat in the loop
race, and if the Cards can turn the
trick today, Stanford money will be
getting a better play.
For today's victor might well turn
out to be the number one team in
the CIBA race.
