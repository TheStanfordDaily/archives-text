In recognition of Army Day, the Army and Air Force ROTC
paraded and held an exhibit of training equipment yesterday
afternoon at the ROTC drill area.
President Wallace Sterling, making his first public appear
ance at Stanford, greeted the cadets and wished them luck.

In ;in introductory speech, Colonel
Basil H. Perry, professor of military
science and tactics, emphasized thfit
the army is but one part of the total
military establishment. The colonel
announced that the Stanford ROTC
unit had received a certificate of
merit signed by the Secretary of the
Army.
Honored guests at the parade were
Dr. Clarence H. Faust, former act
ing president; Dr. Raymond H. Har
riman, coordinator of military af
fairs; Captain R. K. Davis, professor
of naval science; and Sterling.
The Air ROTC had on display its
F-51 fighter plane, as well as an il
luminated cut-away plane engine,
operated by a small motor, and a
large-scale mock-up of a directional
gyro.
Visitors examined the indoor ter
rain board, used for training artil

lery students. It is a miniature
countryside equipped with smoke
making apparatus to indicate shell
hits. The board was partially con
structed by the ROTC.
The artillery unit also exhibited
105 mm. howitzer, field radios and
telephones, and an observer's "scope
BC." similar to a periscope.
Picture* of equipment and activ
ities, and a display of clothing were
shown by the Quartermaster Corps.
Though Army Day is today, April
(5, the Stanford ROTC chose April 5,
their regular drill day, to celebrate
the occasion. This action was ac
ceptable, according to Colonel Perry,
as the Sixth Army District had "set
the pace" this year by scheduling
their observances for April 9.
