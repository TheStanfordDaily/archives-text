""The Return of Peter Grimm" is
not to be confused with the opera
"Peter Grimes," which was given
here last year.
F. Cowles Strickland of the drama
department said yesterday that
ticket receipts indicate many peo
ple incoirectly regaid "The Return
of Peter Grimm" (it rhymes with
him) as a repeat performance of
the modern opera "Peter Grimes."
l 'Tne Return of Peter Grimm" by
David Be'asco is the romantic story
of a sick child who sensitively re
sponds to the wishes of the spirit
of his master in untangling the love
affairs o! the master's niece.
The play as it will be produced
on the Stanford stage April 14, 15,
and 16 is a replica of the original
opening of the play in 1911. At that
time it marked a decided step to
ward franker realism in the theater.
Although not widely produced, this
play has proved popular wherever
il has been t>iven.
