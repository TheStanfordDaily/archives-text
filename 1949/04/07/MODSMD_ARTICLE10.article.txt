# Realistic Setting To Be Used In 'Return of Peter Grimm'
## 
### 
The smell of hot coffee, the faded
glow of oil lamps, pieces of china
displayed on the mantel —these de
tails will bring the comfortable
realism of an old Dutch-type living
room to the setting for "The Return
of Peter Grimm."
The production will open for a
three-night run in Memorial Audi
torium a week from tonight. Tick

ets may be purchased at the Memo
rial Auditorium box office for 90
cents.
Although the play is supposed to
have taken place about 1915, the old
family house on the banks of the
Hudson presents a picture of late
nineteenth century vintage. China
cabinets, oil paintings, ornate furni
ture, and dark woodwork with the
typical high moldings depict a liv
ing room furnished with accumu
lated objects of many generations.
The setting will follow as closely
as possible the original scene used
by the author. David Be'.asco. noted
for his stage realism. Unlike most
sets, the amount of furniture pres
ent in an ordinary room will be
used.
Rain will be produced against the
window panes by water, and the
aroma of coffee and waffles will
come from behind the stage.
