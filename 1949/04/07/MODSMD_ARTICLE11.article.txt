Have you your Easter suit
yet? Time to come down to
the Clothes Closet and get
outfitted. Nothing can heat
plain colored gaberdine. Our
suits by David Gaines, in
short and tall sizes, are beau
tifully cut along the latest
lines.
Our Hart. Sehaffner & Marx
suits are impeccably tailored,
coming in three proportions:
tall, regular, and petite. Both
these and the Gaines suits
come in all shades of pastels
as well as in navy and gray.
Remember, you can't go
wrong with a tailored suit.
For Easter dress it up with
a flower-trimmed straw bat.
You can find the style best
fitted to you in the color
you're looking for on the
Clothes Closet's hat balcony.
Will you have a huge cart
wheel, a small cloche, a
turned-up brim, a veil?
Come visit us at the Clothes
Closet today. Look for the big
oak tree at 520 Ramona just
off University.
