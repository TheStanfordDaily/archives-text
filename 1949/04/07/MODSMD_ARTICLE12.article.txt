# Indian Traditions Cover All Campus Life
## 
### CARYL HARMS 
When you cast your vote for stu
dent body president, or grab your
rooter's cap and head for a football
game. you probably do it without
any particular thought of a tradi
tion involved. But almost every as
pect of Stanford life is based on
tradition.
Student self-government, for ex
ample. came to the University only
in 1912. Until then, the faculty had
handled the school's administration,
but on March 20 the students voted
536-70 to take over.
A wealth of tradition surrounds
athletics. Rooters' caps were adopt
ed in 1900, and megaphones and
confetti in 11)04. In the latter year
at the Big Game Stanford formed
the first big white "S" in the root
ing section. All these ideas were
soon copied by Cal.
Also in 1004, a big year for school
spirit, the Indians began serpentin
ing after a Big Game victory, and a
year later they introduced the now
accepted courtesy of the home team
taking the sunny-side bleachers at
a game.
Best-known athletic traditions, of
course, are the Big Game rally with
the bonfire, and the legend of the
Axe and the Axe Yell, all of them
dating back to the earliest years of
the University.
The "Big C" was built by Cal to
replace the "Big C" bench, stolen
by Stanford frcm the Berkeley cam
pup and eventually burned as a jinx.
Originally cement-colored, the "C"
cot its first of numerous coats of red

| paint on the clay of the 1905 b.ise
j ball game.
Many everyday traditions have
! survived the years nearly intact.
Stanford's major minor sport,
waterbagging, is almost as old as
the University itself. Within one
week of the school's opening, En
: cina dwellers of the pioneer class
had discovered all the possibilities

of target practice from the hall's
windows.
"No flowers, carriages, or taxis" is
an old tradition instituted to main
tain the democratic spirit of Stan
ford. In this day of private cars
and off-campus dates the latter two
have been forgotten, but corsages
are still absent from campus func
tions.
The "no smoking on Quad" tra
dition, reverently observed during
the University's early days, is now
nearly extinct. And saying "hello"

I on Quad would be a full-time job
i now, but the remembrance of this
i early practice serves to encourage a
friendly atmosphere.
"Jolly-ups" are as old as the cam
pus its-elf, and are still popular and
informal get-togethers.
A tradition which was carefully
prepared for, rather than being a
< spontaneous development, is the
Honor Code. It began as a time
honored system in the Law School
and was eventually adopted for the
: entire University.
More important, though, than any
; specific customs are the intangible
traditions that make the Stanford
Family in spite of increased enroll
! ment and the changing years.
As a Daily editorial of several
years ago put it, these are the "con
cepts and ideals, attitudes and hab
its of thought that have distin
guished Stanford students and their
University from other students in
other universities."
