## The 						Baker Scholarships 
### 
Every large city throughout the nation has one or more schools
offering vocational training to young men lacking either or both
monetary and mental resources to attend a university. For those
men lacking financial support but having a high scholastic back
ground in their schools, the George F. Baker scholarships will
answer a great need.
"Stanford believes that young men of qualifications sought by
the Baker Trust—students with great promise of future contribu
tion to the nation in business, science, and government—may
well be found among high school students who have been denied
any hope of college education for financial reasons," a University
information bulletin stated.
Each scholarship—up to $1,500 each year if needed—is re
newable for four years on the basis of attainment. Thus no man
will be dropped midstream in his studies unless his academic
work is not good. This compares with other students entering
Stanford on University scholarships and losing them after one
year because no funds were available to continue the grants.
The University will award four-year Baker scholarships to
ihree or four men entering Stanford during each of the next
three school years. In granting the scholarships to Stanford, the
Baker Trust said:
" . we would not wish to restrict the selection (of men)
to the highest ranking students. We would hope that the col
leges would find well-rounded, well-developed, balanced indi
viduals. Generally speaking, we would lean toward the selection
of young men who elect active rather than contemplative or
purely academic careers."
