# Frosh Academic Suspensions
## 
### 
Recent complaints from Encina this quarter have been raised
by the frosh over rumors of "the large number of men" who
flunked out of Stanford at the end of winter quarter.
But the Scholarship Committee reported yesterday that only
15 freshmen—a normal postwar number—from a class of 540
were suspended because of poor academic work. Last year at
this time, 19 frosh from a class of 608 were suspended.
Many students who leave the University have taken two or
more quarters to accumulate enough deficient grade points for
suspension. In the case of freshmen, winter quarter finals usually
mean the difference between remaining in or leaving Stanford.
