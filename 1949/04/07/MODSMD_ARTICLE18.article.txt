## Milk Cartons 
### 
To (he Editor:
Fraternity milk-drinkers have a good friend in Mr. Piers of the Piers
Dairy, who advises them to buy quarts instead of half-pints. But, his ob
jections to carton milk strike me as a little strange:
1. That cartons are more fragile than bottles.
2. That cartons ax - e harder to pour.
3. That cartons present a difficult disposal problem.
I should answer as follows:
1. It depends upon what you want to do with the containers. If you
step on them, I suppose the carton would crush before the bottle. But if,
as more frequently happens, you drop them on a cement floor, the bottle
will shatter but the carton will not even spring a leak.
2. Carton milk presents no pouring problem that I can see. It doesn't
dribble and it empties as completely as a bottle. Certainly, it pours more
sanitarily, since the milk need not over the exposed glass rim,
where Mr. Piers himself admits there may be a germ or two.
3. As to disposal, cartons need only be burned with the rest of your
scrap paper. Then they are out. of the way. But bottles should be washed,
if they are not to gather flies while waiting on your back step to be
hr.uled off. Milk racks, which you will have on your hands, full ox
empty, are unwieldy and unsightly. Cartons are always out of sight.
In addition, two other points are wor+h considering:
3. Cartons are square and more compact. You can get more carton
milk in the same refrigerator space.
2. Cartons lessen the danger of your finding broken glass and cigar butts
in your milk. (Naturally, this is not to suggest that Mr. Piers' milk con
tains these ingredients.)
I should add that I am not in the dairy business or the production of
paper cartons.
