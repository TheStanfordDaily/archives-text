# Good Friday Observance
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In reference to the Chaplain's column of last Friday which discussed
the plans for Holy Week, we should like to state that while the services
which will be held at the Memorial Church are, according to the Chaplain,
an adequate observance of Good Friday, the opportunity offered to Stan
find students to attend these services, or others of their choosing, is com
pletely inadequate.
If. as the charter states, this is a Christian University, certainly ihe
administration can afford to dispense with three hours of school to com
memorate Christ s crucifixion, one of the most meaningful events of
Christianity.
