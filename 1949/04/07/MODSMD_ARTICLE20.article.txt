# Finland Seeks Peace, Sick of Hopeless War

(Note: the following article is
the result of an interview with
Tero Vaisanen, foreign scholar
ship student from Helsinki. He
wishes to emphasize that these
are not necessarily his personal
political views, hut rather a state
ment of Finland's postion, viewed
as objectively as possible.)
Ask any Finn this question:
"Which side would you take in a
future war?" You might be a bit
taken aboek by his answer, but it
would probably run like this: "It
doesn't make any difference, we'd
lose anyway."
All this sounds a trifle cynical?
Bu' let's look at the record. In 1939
and 1940, Finland fought, as usual,
with Russia, who was at that time
a 1 lied with Germany. She then had
the moral, though not the military
support of England, France, and the
United Slates. Beginning in '41, she
fought against Russia once more, but
this time the Big Red was allied
with her old friends. Although this
was more in the nature of a private
war, it still put her, in the eyes of
the Allied world at least, in the Nazi
camp. And then in '44, what should
happen but Finland finds herself
fighting with Russian and the West
ern Allies against the Germans.
What did she gain from all this
strife? Absolutely nothing, unless
perhaps a bad name. She lost that
chunk of territory she had fought so
valiantly over with Russia the first
time; the second time, she lost the
Second World War, to say nothing
of her former excellent standing
with the Allies; and after the third
alignment, .she is still saddled with
a staggering reparations bill and a
strait-jacket peace treaty.
With these little items of fact in
mind, perhaps we can see why our
hypothetical Finn wants only to live
in peace, and get involved in wars
no longer, other people's as well as
his own.
This northern state, small in area
and influence, but large in spirit, is
right now sitting on one of the
world's powder barrels. If she goes
in with the West, her Russian goose
is cooked. If she signs on the dotted
Red line, the Atlantic Pact powers
will hold little love for her, although
perhaps a strong measure of sympa
thy, after the fashion of that held
for Czechoslovakia. Not just this,
but the notorious "inconveniences"
of Communist rule.
The people of Finland have fairly
completely come around to the real
ization that idealistic views of the
rightful position of small states in
the game of Big politics are sweet,
but fit only for lovers of the opium
weed. Particularly in her case is it
seen that Wilsonism is no help: her
destinies are inevitably tied up with
the maneuverings of the giants.
Power politics of this sort is the
sport of kings, not of pawns, and
it is often found that kings find
pawns rather expendable.

tomorrow.)

in with the West, her Russian goose
is cooked. If she signs on the dotted
Red line, the Atlantic Pact powers
will hold little love for her, although
perhaps a strong measure of sympa
thy, after the fashion of that held
for Czechoslovakia. Not just this,
but the notorious "inconveniences"
of Communist rule.
The people of Finland have fairly
completely come around to the real
ization that idealistic views of the
rightful position of small states in
the game of Big politics are sweet,
but fit only for lovers of the opium
weed. Particularly in her case is it
seen that Wilsonism is no help: her
destinies are inevitably tied up with
the maneuverings of the giants.
Power politics of this sort is the
sport of kings, not of pawns, and
it is often found that kings find
pawns rather expendable.
(This article will be concludcd
tomorrow.)
(Note: the following article is
the result of an interview with
Tero Vaisanen, foreign scholar
ship student from Helsinki. He
wishes to emphasize that these
are not necessarily his personal
political views, hut rather a state
ment of Finland's postion, viewed
as objectively as possible.)
Ask any Finn this question:
"Which side would you take in a
future war?" You might be a bit
taken aboek by his answer, but it
would probably run like this: "It
doesn't make any difference, we'd
lose anyway."
All this sounds a trifle cynical?
Bu' let's look at the record. In 1939
and 1940, Finland fought, as usual,
with Russia, who was at that time
a 1 lied with Germany. She then had
the moral, though not the military
support of England, France, and the
United Slates. Beginning in '41, she
fought against Russia once more, but
this time the Big Red was allied
with her old friends. Although this
was more in the nature of a private
war, it still put her, in the eyes of
the Allied world at least, in the Nazi
camp. And then in '44, what should
happen but Finland finds herself
fighting with Russian and the West
ern Allies against the Germans.
What did she gain from all this
strife? Absolutely nothing, unless
perhaps a bad name. She lost that
chunk of territory she had fought so
valiantly over with Russia the first
time; the second time, she lost the
Second World War, to say nothing
of her former excellent standing
with the Allies; and after the third
alignment, .she is still saddled with
a staggering reparations bill and a
strait-jacket peace treaty.
With these little items of fact in
mind, perhaps we can see why our
hypothetical Finn wants only to live
in peace, and get involved in wars
no longer, other people's as well as
his own.
This northern state, small in area
and influence, but large in spirit, is
right now sitting on one of the
world's powder barrels. If she goes
in with the West, her Russian goose
is cooked. If she signs on the dotted
Red line, the Atlantic Pact powers
will hold little love for her, although
perhaps a strong measure of sympa
thy, after the fashion of that held
for Czechoslovakia. Not just this,
