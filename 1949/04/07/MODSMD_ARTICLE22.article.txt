You say you want to be a really smooooth Stanford man? You say
you re trying to impress that blonde with the well-developed bank account
in your history class? Tell you what I'm gonna do! I'm going to give
you the lowdown on that evening' of evenings, the hotel date.
Most people think that it's very expensive to dine and dance at a
large hotel. Actually the hostelries operate on a profit-sharing basis.
Every time you walk in, they try to give you the business.
Somehow I always feel as out of place at a large hotel as a clean
shirt at a fraternity house. The waiters seem to go out of their way to
give you a bad time. The other night I sat down at a table, tucked my
napkin under my chin, and before I could order, one of the waiters came
up and asked me if I wanted a shave or a haircut.
Those waiters always cluck around the table as if they were trying
to lay an egg. Usually you're wishing they'd go ofT somewhere and do
just that. And the menus are complete with everything, including the
blood of a former customer who got one look at the prices and slashed
his wrists.
Personally I don't like to go to any of the San Francisco hotels just
to go dancing. The orchestras at every one of them play like each leader
read the same book on music, written by Guy Lombardo. Most of these
local musicion don't know too much about harmony. They think an
"augmented fifth" is a large bottle plus two pints.
I wouldn't mind the music so much if I were a better dancer. But 1
never will be, for two reasons. My feet.
The biggest gag. however, of the typical evening of hotel dancing is
having a picture taken of the three gay couples at your table. When
prints come back, one of the fellows has photographed like he's worried
about how much it's going to cost: the second guy is pouting (he already
krows how much it's going to cost); and the third one is too drunk to
care.
In our party the other night, one of the fellows drank a little too much
and discovered he was going to be sick. A little bird told him.
Then later in the evening the men from the local radio station always
come in toset up their equipment for the late evening dance broadcast.
This is known in the trade as a "dance remote," which means that any
similarity between what goes on here and dancing is extremely remote.
And have you ever noticed the way some of the dance band vocalists
will hold one hand over an ear while they're singing so they can hear
their tones more clearly? Most of the listeners cover both ears and
achieve much better results.
Well, there it is: The Bull Session simplified guide to "that evening out."
But if you decide you'd rather spend next Saturday night by taking in .1
cheap movie, say hello to the guy in line ahead of you. It'll be me.
