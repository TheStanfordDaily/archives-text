# Work Camps Offer Cheap Vacation
## 
### 
One of the most valuable, inter
esting. and inexpensive ways to
spend your summer is in a work
camp. Camps are held by many dif
ferent organizations, especially
church groups and YWCA-YMCA.
You may attend work camps all
over the United States, Mexico, or
Europe. Expenses vary from $000
for some European work camps to
camps in the United States where
you actually make money. Require
ments are usually only character
references and in some cases pre
vious camping experience.
Of the projects of this kind .still
open to applications, many close on
April 15 (which is only next week)
and tlie others 011 May 15. Appli
cations may be obtained at the
Council for UNESCO Office (in the
lIR Shack) or at the YWCA. You
can lind out where to write for
other applications at these two
places also.
In a work camp of this sort, a
uroup of young people, often from
various racial or national groups,
join together for from two to eight
works. Living cooperatively, they

work on some constructive commu
nity of rehabilitation problem.
Besides their manual labor, most
groups attempt through discussions
and speakers to reach a deeper un
derstanding of the problem they are
working 1 with. Different work camps
vary in their emphasis on this phase
of the project.
Some work camps which are still
open are camps in Europe spon
sored by the American Friends
Service Committee. the World
Council of Churches, Finnish uni

versity students and others.
Work camps are still open for
Mexico, ;;nd many opportunities re
main for interesting camps in the;
U.S.
Addresses, pamphlets, and com
prehensive information on all these
work camps are available at the
Council for UNESCO Office (in the
lIR Shack) and at the YVVCA in the
Wf.men's Clubhouse. The YWCA is
open all day, the UNESCO office
from 4 to 5:150 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
