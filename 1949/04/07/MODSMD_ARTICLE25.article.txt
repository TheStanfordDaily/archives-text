# Cow Aids Row Milk Protest
## 
### 
While state officials in Sacramento
shift the milk controversy from one
department to another, the Theta
Delts have decided to attack the
problem in their own way.
A cow, imported from the Stan
ford Farm, was tied to a stake in
front of the Theta Delt house with
appropriate signs as a protest
against Attorney General Fred N.
Howser's ruling that fraternities
were public eating places and would
have to serve milk from individual
containers.
Until this ruling, the fraternities
served bulk milk, as they assumed
that they were not public boarding
houses.
Howser could not be reached for
comment on the Theta Delts' ac
tion, but a member of his depart
ment said that he saw no reason
why the bill should be changed.
Over in the State Department of

Agriculture, W. C. Jacobson said
that a revised bill was put through
in 1947. "It is this bill, the General
Dairy Industry Bill," he said, "that
requires fraternities to serve milk
from individual containers."
"This bill," he continued, "is
backed by the whole California
dairy industry."
When asked about any possible
remedies, Mr. Ghiggoile of the same
department said that he had noth
ing to offer about the whole mat
ter.
"The Attornev General ruled that

the fraternities are public; then
they are public," he said.
He also said that the State De
partment of Health was instructed
to veto the amendment that Ted
LeVino brought up last month.
