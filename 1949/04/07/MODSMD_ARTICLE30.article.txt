# Indian Diamondmen Blast Favored Santa Clara 6 to 5
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
By dint of some good hitting, heads-up base running, and
timely relief pitching, Stanford's climbing varsity baseballers
won their second 6 to 5 game in a row yesterday afternoon,
defeating the ever-dangerous Santa Clara Broncos on the
Sunken Diamond.
It was the Indians' second CIBA win in a week, and boosted

the hustling Farm nine into a tie*
for third place in the CIBA stand- j .
ings.
The Indians spotted the visiting |
Broncos a three-run lead right off ( j
the bat in the first inning, but put j
together two big innings of their
own to score si\ runs and hand the
favored Santa Clarans their first i
conference loss of the season.
Stott Gets Credit
Dave Stott was the Stanford win- j
ner, although both Jack Heinen and j
Lefty Dave Dahle followed him to
the hill in the eighth. Dave Smith,
the second of three Bronc hurlers |
who saw action was charged with j
the loss.
The game was won by the Cards j
in their half of the fifth inning j
when Bud Klein broke up a cinch
Santa Clara double play by knock- ;
ing down the Bronco shortstop,
Harv Toso, on his way into second, j
Klein was within his rights as Toso j
was on the base path and the big j
outfielder's alertness kept alive a
Card rally which was eventually to
produce four runs.
Frank MacGraw, the first man up
in the Card half of the fifth, lashed
out a single to left; Ray Winter- 1
halter walked, advancing MacGraw
to second; Klein walked to fill the
bases; and then Charlie Cole drilled
a hard-hit ball right at the short
stop. Toso touched second, forcing
Klein, but was knocked down as he
started to throw to first.
Seventh In History
Two runs came across on the play,
and the next man up, Dave Melton, j
poled a terrific homer over the left
field wall to drive home two more
Indian tallies. Melton's homer, a
tremendous smash of nearly 400 teet.
was the seventh homer hit out of
the park since the Sunken Diamond
was built in 1927.
The Broncos managed to score
again on a single and a double in
the eighth inning, but the Cards
managed to hold the upper hand un
til the end of the contest on some
neat relief work by Dave Dahle.
Dave Stott recovered from a bad
first inning to chuck some of his
best ball of the year until he tired
in the eighth. He walked only one
man, but gave up seven safeties to t
the hard-hitting Broncs. i
Tom Kelly, Santa Clara first base
man, was the day's leading hitter — 1
slamming out a triple, a home run
inside the park, and two long fly
balls in four trips. Kelly is un
doubtedly the best sticker the Cards
have faced this year.
