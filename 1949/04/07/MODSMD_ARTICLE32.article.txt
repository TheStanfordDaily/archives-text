## TRACK Six Indian-Bruin Records in Danger 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Six UCLA-Stanl'ord dual meet
records are in great danger of being j
broken when the Bruins and the In- j
dians clash on the Westwood track 1
Saturday in the 13th annual UCLA-
Stanford track meet.
Last year, on UCLA's track, four
meet records were shattered and !
one more tied, as the Bruins
swamped the Cards SO 1 2 to 50'2.
Craig Dixon, the Pacific Coast's
leading hurdler, ran the lows in
22.7 seconds, and the highs in 14.2
seconds last year to break both
meet records.
Last Saturday he was clocked at
14-flat in the highs and 22.8 in the
lows and could easily break his
own record in either race. Unless
he smashes into a hurdle, as he
did in the Fresno Relays last year,
Dixon seems a cinch to win both
races on Saturday.
Stanford ace Gay Bryan has an
excellent chance of besting his own
broad jump record of 24 feet 5 inches
made last year with a bad knee.
Bryan came within one inch of the
all-lime Stanford record last week
with a leap of 24 feet 9 inches.
The Card triple-eventer will also
be leaping lor the meet high jump
record of G feet 5 5 8 inches made
by Vern Hart of the Indians in 1941.
Incidentally, Stanford holds all of
the meet records except for Dixon's
hurdle marks made last year and
Frank Fletcher's 1:54.7 half-mile
effort, also in '48. which tied the
meet record.
Otis Chandler, who tossed the shot
55 feet 4 inches last week for a new
all-time Card mark, is practically a
cinch to break his own record of
53 feet 2 inches established laot
year. In fact, there is a good chance
that Lew Davis, who threw 53 feet
7 inches last week, will also break
Chandler's old mark.
Bud Held, Stanford captain for
the meet, has a good chance to
smash John Mottram's 213 foot 6 V 2
inch record in the javelin, made in
1935.
