# 110 Gridders Answer Call
## 
### 
Football relumed to the Farm
! yesterday in grand style as some ,
' 110 gridders turned out in bright j
! sunny weather to open the 1949
â–  spring practice session.
What they lacked in quality in '
j the first practice the fothallers more
! than made up in quantity and spirit
I The huge squad was first given j
' calesthenic drills before being di- j
j vided up for group work.

Any freshmen who are inter
ested in becoming sophomore foot
ball managers next year are asked
to see senior manager Jack Otter
son tomorrow afternoon after 3
on the field.

Coaches Chuck Taylor and Dick !
Madigan handled the guards with !
Phil Bengtson, Bill Fehring, and Jim I
Cox over the tackles. Mai Elward
headed the ends while Ray Hammett :
and Frank Albert assisted Schwartz .
with the multitude of backs.
Highlight of the day was Emery i
Mitchell's handling 1 of the job ot' T j
formation quarterback, the first time j
the solid lad has been on the field '
since his knee injury in the Array
game.
Frankie Albert, somewhat of a |
quarterback in his own right, was j
hiah on Mitchell's initial showing in !
the passing spot.
Today and tomorrow the griddew J
will go through much the same type 1
of practice as yesterday, but j
Schwartz has scheduled a light i
scrimmage Saturday morning, i
Starting time is slated at 9.
