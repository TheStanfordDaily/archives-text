# Excom Okays '49-'5O Budget
## 
### 
Excom last night approved a $28,715 budget for the school
year of 1949-50. With a proposed income of $33,650, this leaves
a surplus of $4,935.
The biggest controversy arose over the amount allotted
to lIR. John Pool, student manager, had budgeted $2,500 to this

i group, but lIR representatives ar
| gued that they would have to cut
j SIRO relief and conferences it they
' did not get more money.
After much debate, lasting well
over an hour, Excom voted lIR $500
more, lor a total of $3,000.
The debate team also felt that
| their allotted budget of $?,500 was
j too small to carry out next year's
| program. "Stanford has a high aca
demic standard," debater Ronald
Klein argued, "and our debate team
helps to maintain this high stand
-1 aid."
Manager Pool said that he had
i tried to figure out what the students
| want and how much they will bene
; fit from each organization, and then
draw a value judgment on which
j to base the budget.
"If we give one organization more
money, then another group will
have to suffer," he said. "We have
just so much money to spend, and
we cannot safely dip into our sur
! plus."
The complete budget for the

school year 1949-50 is as follows:
