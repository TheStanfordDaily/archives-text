Dis and data time around the spring sports loop:
Let's start with a hot one off the griddle. The little rumors that flow
with the winds ot March tell us that Ciav Bryan, crack broad jumper, high
jumper, hurdler, and track nugget in general, is being primed to take
a ciack at Boh IMathias National Decathlon Record come summertime in
Tulare. Funny that this comes to us as a surprise, because Bryan is a
natural for it. He has a faculty for doing everything well in silk pants.
Bctcha he can do it.
A belated but very whole-hearted bit of congratulations to undefeated
f.osh coach Chuck Taylor and to Mrs. Chuck. Their daughter, Susan
Elizabeth, is exactly 71 days old today. She is expected to have Chuck's
nose. Gawd!
Public apologies to horsehide catcher Jim Castignoli—l once said lie
couldn't hit. In last Saturday's Cal game he not only hit, caught weii,
but played tag with the so very irritated California catcher.
Answer to a question posed in the shower room. What happened to the
vaunted Indian swimmers in the recent National Invitational Meet back
in North Carolina? Well, kids, it happened this away. Ralph Sala got a
second in the 1500 meters. Ihats all. But—wait—there are some extenu
ating ciicumstances. Sala swam an excellent 19 minutes 16 seconds, win
ning the first of the final heats without being pushed. Husghesner, oi
Northwestern, beat Sala's time by simply winning the second heat and
si tting his pace taster than Sala. Thus, Ralph got beat but never even
got into the same pool with the guy who beat him.
Incidentally, the meet ended up with Ohio State first, lowa, and Michigan,
in that order.
The cold sport-light fell upon the question of Ralph Sala's ineligibility
due to last quarter's incomplete in Economics 91—Accounting. Ralph took
the test, handed it in and—evidently—it was soon lost by the department.
Kr is retaking the test tomorrow, and should be eligible by the time the
tmiksters hit Cal at Berkeley on the 16th of this month.
While we're on the subject, Stanford's big—and 1 mean BlG—swim
ming meet of the year is with USC on April 22. Troy is touted as having
the best aggregation of fishmen in its long and illustrious career. Stan
lord Coach lom Haynie is talking seriously of a big, super-fine Swim rally
coi.pied with a water carnival the day jDiior to this big one.
Survey of the great big southland:
M.ke Dimietro, rugged Bruin guard who did not see eye to eye with
the hastily departed Bei t Laßrucherie, will not be playing ball for UCLA
next fall. Seems that Mike dipped into the play for pay game in Hawaii
after last season.
News item: Jeff Cravath. with spring football under full steam, started
counting lettermen noses yesterday. He discovered enough to make
even the old weeper smile. All but one of the linemen that Troy started
against Notre Dame (14-14) will be back. This means that on November .1
the Big I?ed will have to face ends Stillwcll and Hatfield, tackles Schutte
and Bird, right guard IWcMurtry and center Boyd Ilachten. With Bill
A.iiitin back at full and Powers at quarter plus umpteen of the best .JC
trdisfeis in the land, the backfield loss of Doll and Kirby won't seem like
too much, if Cravath can put 'em in shape. Look out for that Trojan
horse.
Over at UCLA footballish—Red Sanders is trying to put in a siiu'le
wing system, using Ernie Johnson or Bill Duffy in the vital tailback spot.
Quarterback-passer Ray Nagel, who set a new Bruin passing record in
the middle of last year's disasters, has turned in his suit. Kaput. Seems
that he can't do anything but pass, and the ex-Vandy mentor has no
use for him.
And what appened to USC's national championship baseball team?
After Santa Clara's twin thumping of them, the Broncos look like the
team to beat. And we sure did that nicely yesterday. Thank you. Dave
Melton.
A suggestion for spring housecleaning on the Farm. Why not do some
thing about the stadium tunnels. Either put asphalt on the floors, or if
this is too rough for the SAC's tender pocketbook, howsabout putting
seme heavy gravel in there. Anything to keep the dust from raising like
the Sahara Desert when the crowds scuff through, as we hope they'll
do next fall.
Old Familiar Faces Department: This comes under the classification of.
"old business,' but here it is. Our northern correspondents tell us that
Lon Stmer. former Oregon State grid mentor, went the way of all flesh
due to a rift between himself and the alumni and students. It seems the
alums wanted more snap, a zippier system, than the consistent but con
servative Stiner had to offer. It got to a point, I'm told, where Stiner
was asked to either change his ways or exit. So enter Kip Taylor int-i
the PCC coaching club.
Also among the gone and nearly forgotten stands the somewhat tragic
figure of Bert Laßrucherie, whose Bruins were undefeated way back "in
11>46, whose Bruins staggered in 1947, and whose Bruins died in 1948. Bert
is now selling Pontiacs in the Los Angeles area.
