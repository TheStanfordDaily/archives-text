# Ken Johnstone Dies of Freak Beach Injury
## 
### 
Kenneth Johnstone, 19-year-old
lower division student living at the
Chi Psi house, died suddenly at 11
o'clock last night in the Santa Cruz
Hospital.
Johnstone was injured Sunday
when he hit his head diving into
the surf at Rio del Mar. At that
time, he was partially paralyzed,
but was expected to recover.
Dr. Fuller, of the Santa Cruz
Hospital, had just consulted with a
neurologist yesterday on the case
and said that Johnstone suffered
from a severe bruising of the spinal
cord. However, the X-rays showed
no break.
'"His heart just suddenly stopped,"
Dr. Fuller said.
Johnstone is survived by his par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Johnstone
of Tacoma. Washington. The father
flew to Santa Cruz Tuesday night.
Dr. Houck of the Stanford Health
Service said the death might be at
tributed to a sudden hemorrhage or
injury to a blood vesel. "This is
often the case in tliis type of acci
dent," he said.
