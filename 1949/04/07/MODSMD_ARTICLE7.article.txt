# Stanford Foreign Projects Are Lauded at UNESCO Meeting
## 
### 
Bob von Pagenhardt and Lois
Keister went to Cleveland last
weekend where they represented
Stanford at the second National
organizations, universities, public
schools, and countless other organ
izations were represented at the
throe-day conference. Stanford and
California were the only Pacific
Coast schools attending.
One main point was emphasized
throughout the conference by such
outstanding - persons as Milton Ei
senhower, chairman of the U.S. Na
tional Commission for UNESCO,
and James Bodet, director general of
UNESCO. It was that the greatest
need right now in war torn areas is
educational rehabilitation and re
construction.
"We feel," said von Pagenhardt,
"that Stanford students can be very
proud of what they have already
done in this field, although there is
still an immense task before us." He
referred to such Stanford projects
as the foreign scholarship plan and
the recent drive for books for the
Free University of Berlin.
Stanford's international work was

I praised, says von Pagenhardt, by
UNESCO officers for its "humani
tarianism" and by officers of the
j State Department at the conference
I for its positive contribution to U.S. |
foreign policy. He feels that this
I represents a realistic attitude dis- j
j played by Farm students in their j
work.
An example he gave was that
when Italy was an especially vital i
area in international affairs, Stan- !
ford was sending a large amount of '
I aid to the University of Naples, thus
j not only contributing materially to
i the Italian students, but influencing
1 public opinion favorably for de
j mocracy.
I In meetings where information ,
j was exchanged concerning projects j
| going on at various universities, the :
I Stanford delegates learned that here,
too, Stanford is leading the way.
| Every project mentioned at the con- j
| ference is either already in effect or
i is being looked into at Stanford.
The delegates were able to meet I
j and talk to many of the high
i UNESCO and state department otti
| cials present at the conference, sev
j eral of whom, von Pagenhardt re
| ports were familiar with interna
| tional activity on the Farm.
Specific activities of the Stanford ]
j representatives and projects men- j
J tioned at the conference will be re
lated in The Daily within the next
' few days.
