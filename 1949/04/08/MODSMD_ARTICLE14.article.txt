# Responsibility and Honor Stressed by Dr. Sterling
## 
### 
Corporate honor and responsibil
ity were cited as the most impor
tant and lasting Stanford traditions
by Dr. Wallace Sterling, Stanford's
new president, at a Traditions Day
program last night in the Frost
Amphitheater.
This was the first time Dr. Ster
ling had spoken to the student body
since he took over his duties as
president last Tuesday.
"It is of utmost importance to in
culcate the standards of honor and
responsibility in which Stanford
takes pride," he went on.
Dr. Sterling, classing himself as
"the most recently arrived freshman
on campus," said that he did not re
member many 01 the Stanford tra
ditions completely. However, he
said that the one tradition that he
would try to take up was to learn
the history of Stanford.
"To know the inspiration of the
birth, and the purpose of the growth
and development of Stanford is one
of Stanford's finest traditions," he
explained.
In discussing the Farm tradition
of honor and responsibility, he said
that the attainment of this goal was
not hard as there were not too
many people and the quality of
students was high.
Then he compared the University
of California with its high enroll
ment to the goat-taming episode in
"Robinson Crusoe," in which the
corral was so large that the goats
were not tamed. The audience ap
plauded this anecdote.
Stanford alumnus and Rhodes
Scholar Robert Brown spoke on tra
ditions in genera! and on the history
of the Axe. He told of episodes in
his own Encinu days and those of
the pioneer class.
Another Stanford hymn called
"The Alma Mater" was introduced
by Head Yell Leader Tom Elke,
who also led the Axe Yell. This
hymn, which was used in the early
days of the University, may be sung
at the beginning of football games,
with "Hail Stanford Hail" sung at
the end.
