### 
Traditions Day turned into a
j blistering success for Stanford
j freshmen as the patter of tiny feet
I was heard once more on Quad.
An annual observance, Barefoot
i D;iy showed just how substantial
I the understanding of the class of
: '52 is. Although many returned to
I the protection of shoes alter a few
hours, most of the freshmen were
able to last the entire day unshod.
Most complaints were a result oi
graveled walks and melting tar on
| the roads. A few cuts were received
from broken glass, but nothing se-
I rious has been reported.
Cotton dresses or levis were cho
: sen by the women of '52 to complete
I their ensemble. The inevitable touch
of femininity was added by red,
I blue, or green bows tied charming
: ly around the big toe.
i Alter a session of soaking -then
I feet, the class of '52 should march
i on to bigger and better accomplish
| ments.
