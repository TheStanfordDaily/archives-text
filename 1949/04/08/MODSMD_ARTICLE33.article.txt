## Bull Session 
### 
Sooner or later this quarter I am bound to get around to the subject
<>i the beach party, so it might just as well be today.
Most Stanford students can hardly wait for the arrival of spring quarter
with its numerous beach and swimming parties. Personally, I don't care
ior swimming because 1 don't look good in a swimming suit. In fact, I
look abdominal. I can never seem to find a pair of trunks in my size.
Th>' only good fit 1 ever h;id in a swimming suit turned out to be epilepsy.
This year my haberdasher suggested a pair of yellow swimming trunks.
"With my white skin and that yellow suit, I look like a half-peeled banana.
Everyone has his own particular "best place" to go lor that beach party.
Even President Truman has a special spot. He invited Drew Pearson
to come down for a little dip at Sonova Beach.
My main objection to most of the local swimming places is that the
water is too dirty. I jumped in Lake Lagunita last week and now all
viy mail comes to the house addressed: "Pear Blackie."
The beach party makes a nice, occasion for a family gathering. We had
a nice party last weekend with mother, brother, sister, and Old Grandad.
Father couldn't make the trip. He is out of town practicing for his new
jol with the State Board of Equalization. Right at the moment he's
behind bars.
But I'm getting away from the subject of beach parties. Most Stanford
women like to swim in the ocean, but my girl uses Ponds.
Besides bringing out a bevy of bathing suits, the beach season also gives
rite to all sorts of pants for the girls, such as slacks, pedal-pushers, clam
diggers, etc. Considering this, the following dissertation was little less
than inevitable.
Essay on Pants:
Essay on Pants
Pants are made for men and not for women. Sometimes a man pants for
a woman, and a woman pants for a man. This is called a pair of pants.
Such pants do not always last, usually because the woman wants to
wear both the trousseau and the trousers. The result is often a suit, which
is called "breeches of promise." When two people are mixed up in a suit,
both panting, it is a suit with two pairs of pants.

to come down for a little dip at Sonova Beach.
My main objection to most of the local swimming places is that the
water is too dirty. I jumped in Lake Lagunita last week and now all
viy mail comes to the house addressed: "Pear Blackie."
The beach party makes a nice, occasion for a family gathering. We had
a nice party last weekend with mother, brother, sister, and Old Grandad.
Father couldn't make the trip. He is out of town practicing for his new
jol with the State Board of Equalization. Right at the moment he's
behind bars.
But I'm getting away from the subject of beach parties. Most Stanford
women like to swim in the ocean, but my girl uses Ponds.
Besides bringing out a bevy of bathing suits, the beach season also gives
rite to all sorts of pants for the girls, such as slacks, pedal-pushers, clam
diggers, etc. Considering this, the following dissertation was little less
than inevitable.

Essay on Pants
Pants are made for men and not for women. Sometimes a man pants for
a woman, and a woman pants for a man. This is called a pair of pants.
Such pants do not always last, usually because the woman wants to
wear both the trousseau and the trousers. The result is often a suit, which
is called "breeches of promise." When two people are mixed up in a suit,
both panting, it is a suit with two pairs of pants.

Dear Mr. Dailey:
Today marks the end of the second week that you've been back writing
Bull Session, and I v/anted to write in to tell you that I haven't missed
your column once. No sir, I haven't seen The Daily at all this quarter,
arid I haven't missed your column in the slightest.

Sooner or later this quarter I am bound to get around to the subject
<>i the beach party, so it might just as well be today.
Most Stanford students can hardly wait for the arrival of spring quarter
with its numerous beach and swimming parties. Personally, I don't care
ior swimming because 1 don't look good in a swimming suit. In fact, I
look abdominal. I can never seem to find a pair of trunks in my size.
Th>' only good fit 1 ever h;id in a swimming suit turned out to be epilepsy.
This year my haberdasher suggested a pair of yellow swimming trunks.
"With my white skin and that yellow suit, I look like a half-peeled banana.
Everyone has his own particular "best place" to go lor that beach party.
Even President Truman has a special spot. He invited Drew Pearson
to come down for a little dip at Sonova Beach.
