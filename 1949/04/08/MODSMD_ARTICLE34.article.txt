## Clean Oysters 
### 
To the Editor:
In a recent feature column on your editorial page, I was quite surprised
t > fmd the statement: "We eat oysters which are even more unclean than
pigs. Worms are much cleaner, and just as edible. 1 '
Although the author may have had some specific instance of expe
rience with unclean oysters in mind, he seems to be echoing much of
the current misconception about oysters, and as the only representative
01 the oyster industry here at Stanford, I feel it my duty to take exception
tp the unwarranted "black eye" which his statement gives the industry
and also to defend the oyster as a valuable source of food.
OystefsT to begin with, are grown in salt water, either in the ocean
itt-elf or ill tidal bodies of water adjacent to it. With the exception of
certain areas around large seaport cities, where sewage is emptied into
it. salt water is absolutely free from pollution. And without turning this
into a comercial plug, I would like to say that our oysters are grown in
Willapa Harbor, in the southern part of the state of Washington, as far
from any contaminated water as can be found in the United States today.
The oyster's complete medium is this salt water, out of which he strains
bv, means of an elaborate gill structure the millions of minute plankton
that make up his exclusive diet. The oyster also draws valuable minerals
tvoin the water, including the iodine necessary to goiter prevention. And
all in all, the oyster has been called nature's second most perfect food
milk alone having a higher nutritional content and valueâ€”by a number
of well-known authorities, including Dr. Trevor Kinkaid, Dean of the
School of Biological Sciences at the University of Washington.
In short, 1 m sure that you'll at least agree with me in saying that
oysters in general are certainly cleaner than pigs. As for the comparative
merits of eating worms, I'll leave that up to your gourmand, Mr. Loeffel
bein.
