To the Editor:
We wish to protest to The Daily for the inconvenience to which it placed
us and about 50 other interested persons Wednesday evening'. We waited
in vain throughout the wee hours of the night to refight the battle of
P( leliu at the Burgess Theater located in the Village.
Negligence on our part led us to assume that The Daily was correct
in giving the date this documentary film was to be shown. Alas, The
Daily, in keeping with Traditions Week, maintained its record of being
in error.
