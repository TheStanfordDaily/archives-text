To the Editor:
Could The Daily help correct a condition which is becoming more
dangerous every day? I refer to the dilapidated state of the wooden
.•-Hps leading into the Quad at the Geology corner. In view of their
advanced state of wear, a crippling accident for some hapless rough or,
(Heaven forbid!), one of our beloved Stanford women, is inevitable.
Last week. I stopped using these stairs—l detour around by the Engi
neering corner. Of course, it isn't everyone who weighs 236 pounds,
<;:> I do, but still .... could The Daily help?
