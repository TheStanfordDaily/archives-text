# Finland Tries To Avoid Commitments

(Note: The following article is
the result of an interview with
Tero Vaisanen, foreign scholar
ship student from Helsinki, Fin -
land. He wishes to emphasize that
these are not necessarily his per
sonal political views, hut rather
a statement of Finland's position,
viewed as objectively as possible.
This is the final in a series of two
articles.)

Although Finland is free to han
dle her own domestic policy, having
a democratically elected Diet (par
liament) and president, not subject
to external supervision, she by no
means can wield a free hand in for
eign affairs.
Outside of the restrictions imposed
by the peace treaty with the USSR
and the United Kingdom on her
armed forces, the mere presence
of neighbor Russia is sufficient to
make her tread most carefully. She
earnestly desires the friendship of
all the great powers, but to be rash
may well fce to dangerously irritate
the Big Bear.
Nor can she easily get the help
of the UN in solving her problems.
The Red veto has denied Finland
membership.
The major determinant of all hex
actions in the international sphere is
simply this: to avoid any and all
political commitments. In her case,
it is her proximity to major powers,
not distance, that forces this iso
lationist stand.
The independence of Finland and
Sweden's neutrality are mutually
operating factors. If S<veden moves
to join with the Atlantic Alliance
powers, Finland's position vis-a-vis
Russia may be seriously jeopardized.
On the other hand, if she gets in
too much trouble with Russia,
Sweden will try to protect herself
by doing that very thingâ€”signing
up with the West. This is better
understood in the light of the fact
that all during World War 11. and
up through the present time, Finno-
Swedish relations have been very
intimate and friendly.
This accounts in great part for
Sweden's non-committal stand on
the Atlantic Pact, prompted by her
consideration for her neighbor's
shaky position, even at the cost of
criticism from the Western bloc.
In economic sphere, Finland's re
covery has been greatly hampered
by the tremendous reparations
which she must pay to the Soviets.
Only through one of the heaviest tax
levies in the world, intensive pro
duction, and large exports has she
been able to make ends meet.
To pay off the indemnity, she ex
ports great quantities of wood, paper
and other pulp products, ships, and
machinery to Russia. This sort of
operation can hardly simply a na
tion's economic situation. As if this
were not bad enough, her precarious
positon with regard to Russia makes
it impossible to receive Marshall aid.
Thus Finland is in an extremely
perilous spot. Any major move to
ward the West would be construed
by the USSR as an unfriendly one,
in violation of their modified mu
tual-aid pact, and one in the oppo
site direction would possibly result
in a new shift of the Iron Curtain.
One must certainly realize, then,
that all of Finland's international
actions must be interpreted in terms
of her all-important craving for
permanent pence and independence.
It is unthinkable to the Finnish na
tion that any involvement in the
struggle of the titans could do any
thing but completely obliterate this
hope.
