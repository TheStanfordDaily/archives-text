Holy Week is just before us. It
completes the Lenten Season, which
rises to its proper climax in Palm
Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good
Friday, and Easter Day. The impli
cations of these celebrations across
two thousand years of Christian
history have been enormous in their
effects, as they are today.
Memorial Church is prepared to
offer worship opportunities through
out the week. Readers will please
refer to the church advertisement
on an other page of this paper for
the schtdule of services.
The music which is to be furnished
by the University Choir, the Uni
versity Singers, the University Brass
Choir, the organists and soloists
will be of its usual excellent qual
ity, and a great aid to the spirit of
this period of the church year. The
church and the chaplains are very
proud of the work being done in
this field, under the general direc
tion of Professor Harold Schmidt.
In addition to the music being
readied for Palm Sunday and Easter,
and for the other services an
nounced, I would like to call par
ticular attention to the Sacred Con
cert which will be offered on
Maundy Thursday evening, begin
ning at 7:15 p.m. In complete iden

tification with the reverent intent
of the day, and with the celebration
of the Lord's Supper which will
follow it, the University Choir and
University Chorus, and the Univer
sity Singers will present an hour
of sacred music.
1 trust it is understood that, dur
ing the Good Friday three - hour
service, it will be possible for wor
shippers to come and go as they
have need. The service will be in
sections of about one - half hour
each. Students with afternoon classes
can keep their attendance records
clean, and at the same time share in
some portions of this event.
Of course the Easter Day services
will be happy features of our cam
pus experience. If the day provides
us with good weather, we anticipate
several thousand people at the 8:30
hour in Frost Amphitheater. This
service will be nationally broadcast
for its first 30 minutes: that por
tion including much music and the
Easter greetings of President Ster
ling. And at 11 o'clock the Church
Sanctuary will fill early.
In order that students and faculty
may not be crowded out of the
church for the 11 a.m. service, and
therefore disappointed, reserved
sections will be held for them until
10:50 a.m.

Of course the Easter Day services
will be happy features of our cam
pus experience. If the day provides
us with good weather, we anticipate
several thousand people at the 8:30
hour in Frost Amphitheater. This
service will be nationally broadcast
for its first 30 minutes: that por
tion including much music and the
Easter greetings of President Ster
ling. And at 11 o'clock the Church
Sanctuary will fill early.
In order that students and faculty
may not be crowded out of the
church for the 11 a.m. service, and
therefore disappointed, reserved
sections will be held for them until
10:50 a.m.
By PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain
Holy Week is just before us. It
completes the Lenten Season, which
rises to its proper climax in Palm
Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good
Friday, and Easter Day. The impli
cations of these celebrations across
two thousand years of Christian
history have been enormous in their
effects, as they are today.
Memorial Church is prepared to
offer worship opportunities through
out the week. Readers will please
refer to the church advertisement
on an other page of this paper for
the schtdule of services.
The music which is to be furnished
by the University Choir, the Uni
versity Singers, the University Brass
Choir, the organists and soloists
will be of its usual excellent qual
ity, and a great aid to the spirit of
this period of the church year. The
church and the chaplains are very
proud of the work being done in
this field, under the general direc
tion of Professor Harold Schmidt.
In addition to the music being
readied for Palm Sunday and Easter,
and for the other services an
nounced, I would like to call par
ticular attention to the Sacred Con
cert which will be offered on
Maundy Thursday evening, begin
ning at 7:15 p.m. In complete iden

tification with the reverent intent
of the day, and with the celebration
of the Lord's Supper which will
follow it, the University Choir and
University Chorus, and the Univer
sity Singers will present an hour
of sacred music.
1 trust it is understood that, dur
ing the Good Friday three - hour
service, it will be possible for wor
shippers to come and go as they
have need. The service will be in
sections of about one - half hour
each. Students with afternoon classes
can keep their attendance records
clean, and at the same time share in
some portions of this event.
Of course the Easter Day services
will be happy features of our cam
pus experience. If the day provides
us with good weather, we anticipate
several thousand people at the 8:30
hour in Frost Amphitheater. This
service will be nationally broadcast
for its first 30 minutes: that por
tion including much music and the
Easter greetings of President Ster
ling. And at 11 o'clock the Church
Sanctuary will fill early.
In order that students and faculty
may not be crowded out of the
church for the 11 a.m. service, and
therefore disappointed, reserved
sections will be held for them until
10:50 a.m.
