"When ah fires, all o' yo' kin start a-runnin. When ah fires
aqain after givin' yo' a fair start, Sadie starts a-runnin'. Th' one
she ketches'll be her husband."
Twelve years ago these words introduced Sadie Hawkins Day
to readers of A 1 Capp's comic strip, "Li'l Abner." Tonight, Stan
ford Sadies celebrate the epic speech♦

by dragging their "kctches" to the
Sadie Hawkins Dance.
!l.")oftth Observation
Tonight will make this about the
3.500 th observation of the mythical
holiday. The University of Tennes
see was the first institution to cele
brate Sadie Hawkins Day. By 1047.
3.000 celebrations had taken place
in colleges, high schools, factories,
lodges, and service clubs.
The Sadie Hawkins Incident was
written into Li'l Abncr because AI
Capp was hard up for ideas. Sadie
was the homeliest female in the
hills. For 15 years she had failed to
get her a man, Finally, she appealed
to her father, Hekzebiah Hawkins,
who solved the problem by declar
ing an open season for one day on
males.
The People
Hekzebiah, like all of Capp's
characters except Sadie, is drawn
from actual people. He is a com
posite of six Civil War generals. Of
Sadie's other contemporaries, L'il
Abner is modeled after Henry Wal
lace. Daisy Mae after Veronica Lake,
Marryin' Sam after the late New
York Mayor Fiorello LaGuaidia,
Moonbeam MeSwine after Jane
Russell, and Available Jones after
Winston Churchill.
The reason Sadie alone has no
real-life counterpart other than her
Stanford sisters was explained once
by Life Magazine: "Sadie Hawkins
is just too ugly to have a resem
blance to any persons, living or
dead."

"When ah fires, all o' yo' kin start a-runnin. When ah fires
aqain after givin' yo' a fair start, Sadie starts a-runnin'. Th' one
