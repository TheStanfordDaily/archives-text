In the Autumn Quarter 1948. Exconi appointed a committee to study and make revisions on the
Constitution of the A.S.S.U. This committee reviewed the present Constitution and came to the con
clusion that it would be necessary to rewrite and recommend an entirely new Constitution, in order to
resolve inconsistencies and duplications.
The committee held meetings among themselves, interviewed numerous students, faculty, and Ad
ministration leaders, conducted open hearings, and studied numerous issues, problems, and conflicts,
in order to write this attached Constitution.
It is the sinccre opinion of the committee that the above-mentioned inconsistencies and duplications
have been resolved into a clear and concise document.
