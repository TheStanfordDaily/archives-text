## 
### 
Dr. Eugene Staley, executive di
rector of the World Affairs Council
of Northern California, spoke yes
terday on world security at the
Women's Clubhouse. His talk was
part of the Institute on "The North
Atlantic Pactâ€”Are We on the Right
Ro;id and Where Does It Lead?"
Discussing different approaches to
world security. Dr. Slaley advocated
the combination of several solu
tions, since no single solution can
solve all the complex aspects of the
security problem.
Some of the policies discussed at
the one-day Institute were national
armament: efforts at friendly co
operation between nations; reliance
on the UN security system; supple
mentation of the UN security sys
tem by a world-wide, veto-free al
liance open to all comers; and mov
ing toward world government by
one or more of various suggested
paths.
Dr. Staley concluded by explain
ing, "Today we have to depend for
security on national armed strength,
on alliances, on imperfect begin
nings of a collective security sys
tem, on small fragments of what we
may one day look back upon as the
beginnings of world government.
But we ran't junk the old system
for a while yet. nor can we afford
to postpone work on the new.
"One of the major problems of
our epoch is to build a new security

i structure around the old.''
