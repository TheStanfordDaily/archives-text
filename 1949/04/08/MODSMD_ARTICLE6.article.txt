# Profs Differ In Pact Talk

### 
Pros and cons of the North At
lantic Peace Pact were discussed
last night at an open meeting by
Dr. Easton Rothwell and Dean Carl
Spaeth of Stanford and Dr. Law
rence Sears of Mills College at
Cubberley Auditorium.
The panel was the conclusion of
an all-day session centering around
world security.
Dr. Clarence Faust acted as mod
erator and started discussion by
aasking how each of the speakers
would vote on the pact if he were a
Senator. Sears stated he would
vote against the pact in its present
torm, since he believes it would
make the United States-Russia rift
even wider and that the United
Nations would be weakened. Sears
wants the pact to be transformed
into a world-wide agreement in
stead of a merely geographical one.
Rothwell opposed Sears, saying
that he would vote for the agree
ment, but on the grounds that the
United States would "lose face" if
it did not carry through now, and
that something must be done about
Russia. He added, however, that he
had many reservations concerning
his vote, and that it is important to
keep in mind that this is merely
an expedient to get out of a situa
tion.
Spaeth said he would also vote
"yes" on the grounds that it is
necessary to convince Russia now
that we intend to stay active in Eu
rope.
The institute was under the aus
pices of the University, the World
Affairs Council of Northern Califor
nia, and the League of Women Vot
ers.
