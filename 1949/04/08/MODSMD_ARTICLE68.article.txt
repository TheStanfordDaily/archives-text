# Finnish Student Enjoys Beer and Friendliness

### JOHN BUSH 
America is the extaovert's para
dise. So says Tero Vaisanen, for
eign scholarship student from Hel
sinki, Finland. His most striking
impression of the United States, he
says, is the "extraordinary" friend
liness and pro - social attitude of
Americans, especially students.
Tero insists that it is no exagger
ation to say that he has made more
good friends in seven months here
than he had made during his life
time. This is one of the outstand
ing features he notes in American
college life.
Likes Stanford's Social Life
In Finnish universities, there does
not exist nearly the social life one
finds at Stanford. In their colleges,
the attitude is that a student is there
to get only "book learning," and
little else. There is simply no sucl/
thing as intercollegiate athletics,
and an institution like the all-cam
pus, or even the fraternity, dance is
unheard of.
One thing that sets Vaisanen off
from the usual Finn is his interest
in American jazz. In his country,
he says, jazz is regarded not as "pop"
music, but as an art in itself. How
ever, the average citizen of the land
ol Jan Sibelius is not much inter
ested in it. His favorite artists in
this field are Teddy Wilson, Cole
man Hawkins, Benny Goodman, and
Jack Teagarden. A hot piano play
er himself, Vaisanen regards Mr.
Wilson as his ideal of the ivories.
However, he hastens to emphasize,
hot jazz is only a hobby, as he con
siders classical music to be the true
art.
Beer Slows Studies
Tero realizes that the sterling in
stitution of the daily beer is the
greatest obstacle to his studies, but
is convinced that the brew ought to
replace wood alcohol as the colle
giate drink in the Land of the For
ests.
He is very happy with the foreign

scholarship plan. He feels that the
happiest days in his student life
have been spent on the Farm. The
only drawback he finds in the plan
is the fact that the scholarship stu
dents have to go back to Europe.
