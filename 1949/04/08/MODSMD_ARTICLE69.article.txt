# Atom Smasher Crows at Farm

### 
Work at Stanford on a billion
volt linear accelerator atom smasher
is progressing rapidly under the di
rection of Dr. Wm. W. Hanson, ac
cording to General Electric engi
neer G. W. Dunlap.
The General Electric official, a
Stanford graduate '35, stressed the
important work being done by the
Stanford atomic scientists at a press
conference in San Francisco this
week.
"There are some intricate engi
neering problems connected with the
construction of a linear accelerator,
which differs from a cyclotron in
that it accelerates atomic particles
in a straight line instead of in an
ever-widening circle,'' said Dunlap.
"The problems involved are being
tackled with great energy at Stan
ford," he added.
