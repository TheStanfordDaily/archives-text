## 
### JOHN BREIER 
It will be scrum time tomorrow
morning when Coach Marchie
Schwartz puts his gridders through
their first scrimmage of the year
at [).
Though the footballers will have
had but three days of practice,
Schwartz wants to run his charges
through a light scrimmage to see
just what divisions should be made

in the squad. There will be no
kick-offs tomorrow.
Yesterday the squad was tenta
tively divided into two groups. One
section was subdivided into four
teams with quarterbacks Gary Ker
korian, Dick Horn, Tom Shaw, and
Albrey Devine at the helms.
These arc the teams that will pro
vide the offensive punch in tomor
row's scrimmage. Their opponents
will be taken from the second group
of. players for the first part of the
drill. Later in the drill, they will
meet each other.
The four teams are heavily
stocked with returning lettermen
and members of last year's fresh
man team. Of the new men only
Gordon Rice, transfer from Santa
Clara's 1947 frosh team, made one
of the first four teams. Other men
may be moved up. or down, as the
spring drills progress and the
coaches have a chance to look over
the material.
