# Trojan, Bruin Netmen Hit Hurt Indians
## 
### WIN DANSTON 
It could be a very rough weekend
j for Coach Elwyn Bugge's tennis
! squad this week when the Stanford
j netmcn run into those two meanies
! from the Southland, UCLA and
j use.
Today the Indians take on the
j VVestwoocl Bruins on the UCLA
courts, and from all indications the
[ result will not cause any joyous j
celebration on the Farm. Tomorrow j
the Cards move over to the USC
{ courts to tangle with a powerful j
Trojan team.
I I
The Cards are stil! hampered by
j injuries and early season rustiness. J
j Kirke Mechem is suffering from a I
; sore flipper, and Bob Forbes has a
| bad ankle. In addition Bob Lewis i
j has not had time to round into top ,
j form after basketball season.
On the other hand the Bruins ;
field virtually the same team that
j lost only to USC last year, splitting ;
j a two-match series, and placed third j
in the NCAA Tournament.
j Leading the Westwooders is Herb ;
Flam, ranked eighth nationally, who |
! hsa not lost a match in two years of j
i intercollegiate competition. Flam !
went to the semi-finals of the Na- I
| tional Championships before he was
1 eliminated, beating Gardner Alul- j
j loy and Harry Likas on the way. |
i Teamed with Flam is Gene Gar- j
| rett, another very sharp college ten- I
j nis star. He is undefeated in two \
i years of dual matches, holding a j
i string of 27 straight wins.
Opposing Flam and Garrett will '
Ibe the ailing Mechem and Fred |
j Lewis for the Indians. Only if both j
Farm players put together their i
| best games do they have a chance to i
! win.
i Saturday morning the Indians |
j will again run into the Trojan jinx, j
The Trojans have three potent net- :
men in Straight Clark, Bob Perez, 1
: and Arnold Saul.
