# Victorious Stanford Baseballers Meet Loyola Lions Here Today
## 
### 
Stanford's Gas House baseballers,
minus the services of Dick Cleg};
and Ray Winterhalter, will go after
! their fourth straight against the in
vading Loyola Lions today at 3:15
j p.m. in the Sunken Diamond.
Both first-baseman Clegg and see
j ond-baseman Winterhalter sprained
J ank'es in practice yesterday, and
will miss the weekend games.
Tomorrow Harry Wolter wlil take
his men up to San Francisco to clash
with the USF Dons in the Tribe's
fourth ball game of the week.
Slated to start on the mound
against Loyola today is lanky Jim
Claypool, bespectacled right-hand
er, who turned in some effective re
| lief woik against Cal Poly last
j Tuesday.
Frank Laßrum will start tomor
; row against San Francisco's strange
ly unpredictable Dons. Stanford de
feated USF in an earlier contest.

Starting time for today's game
I is u.13. Admission will be free.
I

The Indians will use the two
games as conditioners for the re
turn match with Santa Clara next
Tuesday night in San Jose.
Nava Back in the Park.
Figuring to return to action this
afternoon is Blasting Bob Nava,
hard-hitting right-fielder, who has
been sitting out a penicillin reac
tion. Nava was one of the team's
leading batsmen last season, but has
not been able to see much duty so
far this year.
His return to the lineup will add
both hitting and defensive strength
to the team, although John Claypool
has been filling in very well at the
position.
If Stanford manages to add both
Loyola and USF to its victory belt,
it will mean five straight and the
longest win streak of the campaign.
The Cards are improving with
every game, particularly in the
fielding department which was sup
posed to be a weak link.
Dick C'egg has done a miraculous
job in switching from the back
stopping business to become a re
liable first-sacker.
Melton to Winterhalter
Dave Melton and Ray Winterhal
ter have also worked wonders in
developing into a flashy keystone
combo, and Bill Ai'ce at third
rounds out an infield that is as good
as any in the CIBA.
Fast - breaking double plays and
consistent fielding have been a great
help in pulling Stanford pitchers
out of tight spots so far this season.
Alert and rugged base - running
have also played an important part
in Stanford's recent wins. If it had
n't been for Bud Klein's block of
Harvey Toso during the execution
of a would-be Santa Clara twin
killing last Wednesday, Stanford's
four - run rally would never have
taken place.
Stanford's baseball team is going
to get better in every game, and
the Indians figure to prove it this
weekend against the likes of Loy
ola and San Francisco.

turn match with Santa Clara next
Tuesday night in San Jose.
Nava Back in the Park.
Figuring to return to action this
afternoon is Blasting Bob Nava,
hard-hitting right-fielder, who has
been sitting out a penicillin reac
tion. Nava was one of the team's
leading batsmen last season, but has
not been able to see much duty so
far this year.
His return to the lineup will add
both hitting and defensive strength
to the team, although John Claypool
has been filling in very well at the
position.
If Stanford manages to add both
Loyola and USF to its victory belt,
it will mean five straight and the
longest win streak of the campaign.
The Cards are improving with
every game, particularly in the
fielding department which was sup
posed to be a weak link.
Dick C'egg has done a miraculous
job in switching from the back
stopping business to become a re
liable first-sacker.
Melton to Winterhalter
Dave Melton and Ray Winterhal
ter have also worked wonders in
developing into a flashy keystone
combo, and Bill Ai'ce at third
rounds out an infield that is as good
as any in the CIBA.
Fast - breaking double plays and
consistent fielding have been a great
help in pulling Stanford pitchers
out of tight spots so far this season.
Alert and rugged base - running
have also played an important part
in Stanford's recent wins. If it had
n't been for Bud Klein's block of
Harvey Toso during the execution
of a would-be Santa Clara twin
killing last Wednesday, Stanford's
four - run rally would never have
taken place.
Stanford's baseball team is going
to get better in every game, and
the Indians figure to prove it this
weekend against the likes of Loy
ola and San Francisco.
