## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga., April 7 (/P).—,
Lloyd Mangrum, who makes more
I money out of playing golf than any- j
t one else in the business, and Frank
; Stranahan, who probably spends I
| more on the same game, showed
| the way through the opening round
of the loth Masters' Tournament to
j day.
Mangrum, the swarthy, mustached
pro who represents the Tam O'Shan
ter Club near Chicago, fired a three
under-par 09 over the windswept !
Augusta National course. Strana- i

ban, the wealthy Toledo amateur,
came in only one stroke behind him
after a round which he described as
"extremely lucky."
These two and % four other ex
perienced pros — Clayton Heafner,
Johnny Revolta. Dick Metz, and
Leland Gibson —were the only ones
who could break par among the 58
golfers chosen for the Masters' be
cause of their outstanding records.
These four came in with 71's and
Lawson Little, another veteran, had
an even par 72.
