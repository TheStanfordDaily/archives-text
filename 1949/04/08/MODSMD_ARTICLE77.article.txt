# 'racksters Head For Westwood Today
## Chandler, Bryan, Held, Hoff, Lyons Ready As Stanford Tackles Bruins in LA Crucial 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
With two convincing cinder victories under their belt, Stan
ford's undefeated tracksters will invade the Southland tomorrow
afternoon when they battle the strong UCLA Bruins on the West
wood oval.
The Indians are still striving for their first conference victory

! quarter miler, will again be favored
| to take his event, as he did last
I year against the Bruins. Hoff per-
I sonally won the relay for the Cards
j last year, the only bright light in an
otherwise dismal day for the In
dians.
Mile Relay Close
Teammate Pitch Johnson will
! have a tough battle with Uclans'
{ Jeff Lawson and A 1 Kapp for second
j place. The mile relay also figures to
' be a close race, with the Bn.iins'
team being clocked in 3:19 last
j week.
The Bruins have two 1:56 ha!f
-j milers in Jack Miller and Hugh
Mitchell, both of whom should be
hard to beat. Sophomores Drew
Terramorse and George Mooers
j will carry the Card banner.
Lyons in the Distances
A 1 Lyons, who is much improved
: over last year, will be the chief
| Indian threat in the distances. Roy
'al Balch, Bruin distance runner,
broke his own personal record when
j he ran a fast 4:22 last week, and will
i be favored to take the event.
Teammate Johnnie Pattee, al
though having about the same best
I time as Lyons in the two-mile, will
J be fresh lor the long eight - lap
i grind. Balch and Lyons will battle
j for that all-important second spot.
The Cards hope to pile up enough
j backlog in the field to tide them to
1 victory. A sweep in the shot put is
S anticipated, with Otis Chandler,
Lew Davis, and Norm Nourse plac
! '.ng in that order. The meet record
i is 53 ft. 2 in., made by Chandler
last year in the Bruin oval.
Tay'or Lewis is the Uclans' only
: sure winner in the field. Lewis
j hopes to break 160 feet before the
| season is over, and chalked up a
l strong 154 ft. 7 inH. last Saturday.
Chandler, Bob Scott, and Steve Mc
! Kee of the Indians will be vying for
i the second and third spots.
In the jumps, senior Gay Bryan
| rates the top position. With George
j Stanich busy with baseball, the old
j er half of the Bryan brothers should
J cop the high jump event. The Card
j ace has a good chance of breaking
| his own meet record of 24 ft. 5 in.
! made last year. Fred Fank and
j Merritt Van Sant complete the Card
entries, in the broad jump.

| since tne war, and are determined to
| turn the tables on the Brnins to-
I morrow. The contest figures to be
| unusually close with seconds and
j thirds probably deciding the out-
I come of the meet.
Two Straight Victories
The Cards have done exceedingly
i well in their first two meets of the
I season, as they crushed California
40 to 20 in the California-Stanford
j Relays two weeks ago, and then
smashed College of Pacific 101 to
30 last Saturday. Both meets were
held in Stanford Stadium.
However, the Bruins' record this
year has been just as impressive.
! Led by Craig Dixon, the Coast's
; top hurdler, UCLA has rolled over
San Diego State, Whittier College,
and Santa Barbara College on suc
cessive Saturdays by large scores.
As was the case last year, the
} Bruins are strong in the track
ev.ents. In fact, Stanford is the fa
; vorite in only two of the nine track
races, tht? quarter mile and the relay.
! Of course, Ronnie Buck in the
I dashes, A 1 Lyons in the distances, 1
; and Drew Terramorse in the 880
j could surprise, but time comparisons
j give the Bruins the edge in these
| races.
Indians Dominate Field
However, in the field the Indians
jar.2 supreme. Except for the discus, i
in which Taylor Lewis of UCLA is j
far in front of the field, the Cards '
j are favored in all of the field events.
| In ihe pole vault and the high jump
where the competition is close, the !
meet may be decided.
Last year, because of rainy i
weather, the UCLA-Stanford track ;
meet was moved from Stanford Sta
j dium to the Westwood oval at the j
last minute, and the Indians subse- !
quently bowed to Coach Ducky J
Drake's Uclans, 80'i> to 50V2.
j However, the Bruins have lost j
Frank Fletcher, Ralph Gold, and
! Jerry Shipkey, among others, and j
; are particularly weak in the pole 1
I vault, the shot put, and the broad j
i jump.
UCLA Dominates Sprints
UCLA figures to dominate the !
1 sprints. Bob Work, Ernie Lightner, I
Jean Reep, and Hurdler Craig Dixon
! give UCLA plenty of power in both j
the 100 and the 220. Work was j
clocked in a fast 9.7 last week.
However, the Cards' Ronnie Buck j
is ready and willing to accept the I
Uclans' challenge. Buck came
through last week against Don Har- I
dey of COP, a pretty fair sprinter,
Ito win the century event. Buck's j
; 10-fiat was against the wind and j
I not 011 a particularly fast track. The |
220 race, on the other hand, looks
j like a lost cause for the Indians.
