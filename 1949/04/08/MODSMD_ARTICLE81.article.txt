# Indian Golf Team Faces Nasty Weekend with Gaels and SJS
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team will j
meet two collegiate foes this week
when they meet St. Mary's on their
home links this afternoon, and j
travel to San Jose to meet the na- !
tional champions tomorrow morn- |
ing.
The San Jose State match at the j
San Jose Country Club should be
the toughest dual match of the sea
son for the Indians. The Spartans '
'ost several men from last year's j
team, but still rate among the top
lve in the country. One of their
stars is Jay Hopkins, who accounted
for six points for the Los Altos Golf
Club when they defeated Stanford \
17-10 earlier in the season.
Last year the Indians and Spar
tans split two very even matches. j
San Jose took the first match at
San Jose to 12V2, but the In
dians came back to win the rematch ,
14-13 at Stanford.
Coach Bud Finger plans to use j
(he same team that played against ;
Santa Clara with the exception of !
one man. Dick Welclon is expected !
to gel the call over Aubrey Devine. j
The other members of the team will
be Bob Crozier, Bud Moo, Ernie
Kellberg', Jack Wallace, and Cully \
Ingram.
Crozier was a mild sensation last
weekend as he shot two (39 s. He

had eight birdies against the Bron
cos, and was four under par after
the first four holes on Sunday. Wal
lace and Moe also played good golf
las week, each coming in with 71's.
The freshman squad will meet
Menlo J.C. this afternoon immedi
ately after the varsity match gets
under way. Dick McElyea, who has
yet to take over 73 strokes this
quarter, will play the number one
position. Keith Beekman, Dufiy
Blabon, Bob Teitsworth, Paul
Palmquist, and Ken Sweeting will
round out the team.
