# Lesnevich Signs To Fight Maxim
## 
### 
CINCINNATI, April 7 (JP).â€”Sam
Becker, local promoter, telephoned
from Paterson, N.J., late today that
he has signed Gus Lesnevich and
Joe Maxim to box 15 rounds here
May 23 for the world's light-heavy
weight championship.
He said Abe Greene, chairman of
the National Boxing Association,
told him that he would recognize
the bout as for the title despite the
fact that Freddie Mills, Englishman,
is the champion.
Mills failed to meet Gus in a re
turn bout within six months after
winning a 15-round decision, and
for that reason the May 23 contest
will be called a championship fight,
Becker said.
Jack Kerns signed for Maxim,
and Joe Vella, manager of Lesne
vich, signed for his boxer, according
to Becker.
He said each man agreed to post
$5,000 as a guarantee that his boxer
will weigh 175 pounds or under for
the contest, and an additional $5,000
guaranteeing appearance.
