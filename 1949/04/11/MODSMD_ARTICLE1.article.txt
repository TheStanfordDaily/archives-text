# Rescue Workers Discover Kathy Fiscus Drowned
## 
### 
SAN FARINO, April 10, (AP) —They found Kathy Fiscus dead
by drowning.
After 52 hours of heart-breaking, back-straining effort, weary
rescuers tonight reached the end of their search, and a hopeful
world of its vigil. That she was dead was announced at 8:59,

But is would have been the same .
if it had been only two hours.
Dr. Robert J. McCullock, family
physician, said that three-year-old
Kathy had been dead '"since last ]
heard from Friday afternoon.That
was little more than an hour after j
she tumbled into the weed-hidden
narrow mouth of an abandoned
well.
Her body was found in water,
wedged in the 14-inch well pipe 92 j
feet below the surface where her j
distraught parents, David and A!ice ;
Fiscus, waited and prayed the two j
days and nights.
It was the end of the line, too, for 1
the 50 or more volunteer rescuers
who went almost without sleep in 1
the frantic digging that carried
them 100 feet down, only to find
water and death.
Nothing had been heard from the
pipe since Kathy's last frenzied,
faint cries to her mother about 6
p.m. Friday. But hope had been
held that perhaps shock had eoma
tized her and somehow she would
survive.
The bereaved Fiscus family, in
response to the sympathy expressed
from all corners of the world, said
simply:
"There is nothing we can say but
merely thank all the people who
have been helpful."
The child's body was brought up !
at 9:47 p.m. She was in the arms
of Dr. McCullock as he was hoisted j
out of the rescue shaft by cable, j
The body, wrapped in a gray blan- j
ket, was placed immediately in a '
waiting black hearse and taken to
the Turner-Stevens mortuary.
From all of Southern California I
men came with equipment to free :
Kathy from her cylindrical coffin.
The plight of the little b'.onde girl
captured the sympathy of the world.
A superhuman effort to pull her
free from the earth grew to epic j
proportions. Men and machines
worked without rest, stubbornly
determined to lift Kathy into the
sunshine again.
Two days of heroism followed.
Men risked their lives for the Kathy
who lay dead 94 feet beneath them.
Spcetators covered every con
ceivable place of vantage. They
pressed 30 deep against the 10-foot
steel mesh fence which borders the
field on the south and east.

The plight of the little b'.onde girl
captured the sympathy of the world.
A superhuman effort to pull her
free from the earth grew to epic j
proportions. Men and machines
worked without rest, stubbornly
determined to lift Kathy into the
sunshine again.
Two days of heroism followed.
Men risked their lives for the Kathy
who lay dead 94 feet beneath them.
Spcetators covered every con
ceivable place of vantage. They
pressed 30 deep against the 10-foot
steel mesh fence which borders the
field on the south and east.


KATHY FISCUS was dead when
she was found last night by res
cue workers.
SAN FARINO, April 10, (AP) —They found Kathy Fiscus dead
by drowning.
After 52 hours of heart-breaking, back-straining effort, weary
rescuers tonight reached the end of their search, and a hopeful
world of its vigil. That she was dead was announced at 8:59,

But is would have been the same .
if it had been only two hours.
Dr. Robert J. McCullock, family
physician, said that three-year-old
Kathy had been dead '"since last ]
heard from Friday afternoon.That
was little more than an hour after j
she tumbled into the weed-hidden
narrow mouth of an abandoned
well.
Her body was found in water,
wedged in the 14-inch well pipe 92 j
feet below the surface where her j
distraught parents, David and A!ice ;
Fiscus, waited and prayed the two j
days and nights.
It was the end of the line, too, for 1
the 50 or more volunteer rescuers
who went almost without sleep in 1
the frantic digging that carried
them 100 feet down, only to find
water and death.
Nothing had been heard from the
pipe since Kathy's last frenzied,
faint cries to her mother about 6
p.m. Friday. But hope had been
held that perhaps shock had eoma
tized her and somehow she would
survive.
The bereaved Fiscus family, in
response to the sympathy expressed
from all corners of the world, said
simply:
"There is nothing we can say but
merely thank all the people who
have been helpful."
The child's body was brought up !
at 9:47 p.m. She was in the arms
of Dr. McCullock as he was hoisted j
out of the rescue shaft by cable, j
The body, wrapped in a gray blan- j
ket, was placed immediately in a '
waiting black hearse and taken to
the Turner-Stevens mortuary.
From all of Southern California I
men came with equipment to free :
Kathy from her cylindrical coffin.
