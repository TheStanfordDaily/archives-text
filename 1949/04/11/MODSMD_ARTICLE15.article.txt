# MAN FAINTS AT LOW PRICES
## 
### 
PALO ALTO, Calif., April ] I —
The high cost of living took its toll
in reverse today. Joe Smudge is so
used to paying high prices for every
thing that when he ran into a low
price for a better product, he bit
the dust!
Seems a friend lent him a wonder
ful razor blade —PAL Hollow
Ground. Joe went to the store to get
some more. "How much?" asked Joe.
"Still only 10<f for 4," said the clerk.
That's when Smudge fainted.
"What?" said Joe when he came to,
"Why I pay twice that for blades
that aren't half as good."
P.S.: Don't be fooled by price. Try
Pal Hollow Ground yourself. You
still get 4 for 10<f, 10 for 25<*, 21 for
44 for For either Double
or Single Edge razors.
