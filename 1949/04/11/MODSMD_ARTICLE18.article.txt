# New Light Shed on Origin of California's Name by Courageous Stanford Professor
## 
### 
A courageous Stanford professor |
—a man very obviously not run- |
ning for political office — came up i
with a new suggestion as to the ori- !
ein of the word "California."
According to Dr. Anthony E. So- j
kol's theory, the state's name may |
go back to Roman times. A certain |
lady named "Calefurnia" misbe
haved so badly in court that all I
women henceforth were barred un- j
del Roman law from pleading their !
cases without a guardian.
Adding insult to injury, Dr. Sokol
offers further evidence that "Cale- !
furnia's misbehavior consisted of a ;
"strip-tease" incident.
Dr. Sokol, professor of Germanic

languages, was led into his research
when he spotted the name "Cale
turnia" in a German law book
probably written about 1230.
Name Occurs Widely
The book was translated into sev
eral other languages, and became
the grandfather of other German
law books. Dr. Sokol suggests these
editions may have been circulated
throughout Medieval Europe, and
may possibly have" reached Spain,
where theory has it that "Califor
nia" originated.
According to the idea of a Span
ish origin, California was an imagi
nary island, rich in pearls and gold,
and peopled with Amazons
whose queen was Califia. The story
was written into a then - popular
Portuguese romance which was
translated into Spanish by Garcia
Ordonez de Montalvo.
The Rev. Dr. Edward Everett
Hale, who formulated this theory in
18G2. believed the story of Califor
nia was known to explorers of that
time and became the basis of the
name of their new discovery.
Calpliurnia Appears
Yet another German book, "The
Ship of Fools," may have contrib
uted to Spanish knowledge of "Cal
pliurnia." In its chapter on "Wicked
Women," the book contains a sen
tence showing that "Calphurnia," as

the name for talkative women, had
survived through the Middle Ages.
The sentence, translated into
rhyme, goes:
"If women's talk is our conten
tion
Ca'.phurnia should come to men
tion."
The myth of the feminine Gabby
Hayes may have its roots in an an
ecdote retold by Valerius Maximus.
He tells of a Caja Afrania who
pleaded her own cases, not because
she lacked defenders, "but because
she was full of impudence."
Carfania Confused with Calpurnia
A later Roman writer gave the
name of the offending woman as
Carfania, possibly a misnomer for
C. Afrania. Dr. Sokol thinks that
somewhere along the line Carfania
became confused with Calpurnia.
the name of Caesar's fourth wife.
When and how the two names
became contused is a mystery, ac
cording to Dr. Sokol. but together
the names woidd account for the
hybrid forms (Calphurnia, Knlpfru
nia, Kalfrunia, to name a few)
found in German law books.
If "Calpurnia" is accepted as the
long-range basis for the name "Cal
ifornia," said Dr. Sokol, it is easy to
imagine how it could change to
Calphurnia. then to Calfurnia, Cale
furnia, and conceivably to Califor
nia.
