## Fuss Over Nothing 
### 
A student entered the Memorial Auditorium last Friday, 40
minutes late for his class. He slipped into his seat so quietly,
however, that not more than a handful of students even knew
that he had arrived. Certainly, nobody's chain of thought was
disrupted.
Suddenly, the professor stopped his lecture. Students
squirmed in their chairs, wondering what was the matter.
"Would the student who just entered the room, please leave,"
the professor ordered.
The latecomer sat still, hardly able to believe his ears, and the
lecturer repeated his command. Finally, the student picked up
his books and left. After a few words to the class about arriving
late, the lecture was resumed.
The late arrival of the student is not to be condoned. But
:he action of the professor is even more inexcusable.
If the student had been noisy and had disrupted the class,
then the professor would have been right in ordering him to
leave.
But that v/as not the case. With the juvenile air of a grammar
school teacher, the lecturer held up the class, and exposed the
student to ridicule. And the professor himself, was also subject
1o ridicule, perhaps more so than the student.
