Someone once offered the very sage observation that "90 per cent of
what the student learns in college is learned outside of the classroom."
This thought undoubtedly was originated by someone who had flunked
out and was rationalizing to his parents, but there is still more than a
little truth to it.
"What is this idiot leading to today?" you say. Well, I won't keep you
in suspense any longer. The answer is "bridge." You know .... "bridge"
— that great card game used by millions to develop their powers of reason
ing, concentration, and mayhem.
What's that! You don't know how to play bridge? Well, heavens to
Imogene, you've got to learn. Here, pull up a chair, and we'll kibitz on
thiii game going on right here at the Nitcry.
North: "Three Hearts." (To himself: "I think that's what the book says
to do. If you hold three cards of the heart suit in your hand, bid three
hearts.)
East: (lie is holding a hundred honors in spades, with a total honor count
of four and a half) "Three spades."
South: (He is holding the bag, with just barely one and a half honors
and a straight face) "Four hearts."
West: (Obviously the only sane man in the game) "Pass."
North: (Who has been listening to an off-color story being told by one
of the kibitzers) "Would you mind reviewing the bidding?"
West: "Aw .... for! (insert appropriate sentiment).
North: "Never mind, if you're going to get sore about it! I'll go to five
hearts."
East: (Looking at his cards) "How would you guys like to play for
money?"
South: "Pass."
West: (Rubbing his shin, which has been taking a beating under the
tables from East's foot) "Double."
(North, East, and South now all pass, and South lays down his hand.)
North: "Oh, migosh! Where's your ESCVX THMBZ trump?"
East: "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
South: "I thought you were bidding diamonds."
West: "Come on, sucker, play the cards."
North: "I've got to go study for a test tomorrow!"

Three simple reminders for that "better bridge game."
1. Silence is imperative. (The other night it was so quiet around our
game you could have heard a pin drop, but luckily my head was securely
fastened.)
2. There should be no "table talk." (That's silly. Who ever heard of a
table talking?)
The phrase "a hundred honors" means you have the King and the
Queen and two others over 10. (What two others over ten, Elizabeth and
Margaret Rose?)

Once you have learned how to play bridge, you'll agree that it is a
great game. After all, who wants friends anyway? And think of all
the money you'll save on Christmas cards.
