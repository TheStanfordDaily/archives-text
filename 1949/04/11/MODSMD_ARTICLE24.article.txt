"Austria is the only nation in
which the Russians have maintained
a large military force without pro-
Communistic results.
"The small nation, housing 7.000.-
000 pei sons—one-third of them in
Vienna, is 3C.000 square miles in
area, ancl only GOO miles from Mos
cow.
"Four problems confronting Aus
tria today include:
1. Displaced persons;
2. Politics—the rights versus the
lefts;
*». Economic shortcomings;
4. The effort to stay democratic
despite tremendous pressure from
the Russians.
Visas Checked
'Russia abuses its council privi
lege of checking visas issued by the
Austrian government to foreign vis
itors. If the visitor is in disfavor
with the Communists, the Russians
refuse to okay the visa.
"For two reasons the United
States must continue to support
postwar Austria:
1. We might lose another country
to the Iron Curtain;
2. We might lose, in addition, the
cold war.
"Austrian Communists are Rus
sia's weakest link in Austria, be
cause everything the Communists
have done has backfired.
"A four-powered Allied Council
of England, France, Russia, and the
United States exists in Austria to
day as a disciplinary force and one
to guide the nation to democratic
government.
"But Austria is far ahead of the
council, because the country already
has a democratic coalition govern
ment. The only thing holding back
further progress of the government
is Russia. Since all four-power
agreements must be unanimous, the
USSR frequently vetoes allied
measures.
Few Bullets
"As an example, the 10.000 Aus
trian police are armed only with
pistols with very little ammunition.
Russia refuses to allow more bullets
because of the 'danger' of the situa
tion. Austria cannot have any war
materials unless they are manufac
tured at home. She has few such
factories.
"Austria was the first country to
supply postwar culture, such as the
opera, to Europe. Cultural life has
helped replace the lack of bread in
the country.
"American newspapermen in Aus
tria have to be diplomats with crys
tal balls.
"The Austrians are a very propa
gandized people. Each of the three
political parties—Socialist, Catholic,
and Communist—and the four occu
pation armies publish newspapers.
Morale Better
"Viennese temperament has im
proved since the end of the war. At
first the people were as downhearted
as any German citizen. The change
is due to the billion dollars the U.S.
has given Austria in aid since 1945.
"The Russians have not gained
prestige in Austria as a result o!
their policy. Since this is election
year, the Russians will sponsor any
party that would weaken the right
factions.
"An Austrian peace treaty, mean
while, will be signed when Russia
wants it signed. The USSR will
okay a treaty when they have the
machinery ready to take over the
country.
"In the last six months I have
never seen a country come back so
fast. One Englishman told me that
'the British are almost up to the
Viennese in postwar recovery.'
"The black market is relatively
small and relatively unnecessary.
Overall, Austria is in about the
same shape as we were back in
1932. The Austrians will continue
to like the U.S. as long as we con
tinue to stand in bade of them with
economic and moral force.
"They will stand off the Bear as
long as they have a shotgun (the
Western Powers)."
