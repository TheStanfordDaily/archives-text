## Consider the Car 
### 
To the Editor:
We don't own automobiles. We are but two of the many who are grate
ful for the Stanford tradition which enables those of us who don't own cars
to get to and from classes. It is because we are grateful that we offer
the following point for consideration by those who occasionally may forget
their obligation to the car owner—the obligation to treat his automobile
with care.
Door-slamming is the particular sin to which we refer here. In the
newer cars, a gentle nudge is all it takes to close the door securely. In
seme of the early models, perhaps a slightly firmer push is needed.
Skimming the car door is inexcusable. Al! this a minor point? Maybe.
But by considering the car and its driver, you are demonstrating your
appreciation for the ride. And we do appieciate it —all of us.
