# "Pastoral" Climax
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The reviewer of "Symphony Pastoral'' has succeeded in upholding The
Daily's traditional reputation fo inept and incompetent criticism.
That the reviewer could believe that the climax of the picture occurred
when the girl realizes she loves the pastor's son betrays a pathetically
uncomprehending mind.
The climax occurred when the girl realized the true meaning of the
pastor's love for her. He did not realize this until the very last scene, and
it is this which makes the final scene so poignant. (I exclude the fade-out
shot of the pastor carrying her across the snow.)
For the reviewer to state that there is no build-up to the girl's actions
at the end merely indicates that the reviewer either did not see the pic
ture at all, or else snored contentedly throughout.
