# ROTC Photo
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The front page photo you ran in the April 5 Daily is miserable.
Granted that the camera is a good one. the setting fine, and the lighting
all right, the subject material stinks.
Since when has the manual called for the color guard of four men to
march in three individual steps? Since when have sun glasses become a
part of the uniform? And, obviously, the only man with any brains is
the Colors Bearer who has his eyes on the ground and is looking for
ground squirrel holes.
God help the outfit unless some ex-GI takes the local color guard in
bsnd prior to the battalion parade this afternoon and teaches them to
march.
Having once been a member myself (1941-43). I will be among the first
to admit that the Stanford ROTC has never been one of the finest march
ing units, but I think that it is a dirty trick on the part of your paper to
broadcast the fact by running a picture like this one.
