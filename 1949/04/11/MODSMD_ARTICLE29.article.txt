# Summer Study Abroad
## 
### 
You can study abroad this sum
merâ€”in practically any country in
the world. Over a hundred uni- j
versities have listed summer courses
in everything from art to local cus
toms.
Almost all the foreign universities
are still accepting applications for
this summer session. The require
ments vary widely, but most of
them only ask for a slight knowl
edge of the language.
Expenses, too, differ among the
various universities. Usually trans
portation is the most expensive item,
while living and tuition costs are
apt to be lower than in the United
States. The University of Mexico
offers the least expensive program.
Although no regular scholarships.

are offered for summer study, funds
are available to those qualified un
der the GI bill.
As far as travel to the different
countries is concerned, reservations
are closing up rapidly. No plane
reservations are available at this
time, but two student ships have
just been released by Congress for
transportation this summer. Stu
dents going abroad to study have
top priority for places on these ships.
Very extensive information on
European and South American uni
versities. and especially on their
summer sessions, is available at the
Council for UNESCO. Office
in the lIR Shack, are from 4 to 5:30,
Monday through Friday.
