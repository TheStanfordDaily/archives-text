## 
### 
Five Stanford students were res
cued from drowning at Rio del Mar
beach this weekend, as a fierce rip
tide caught swimmers oft guard and
prevented them from swimming
ashore.
On Saturday, Jane Ilillman, liv
ing at Hurlburt House, and Bill
Callahan, former president of the
Beta house, were rescued when two
friends from the Beta house towed
the exhausted swimmers to shore
after hearing their cries for help.
Miss Hillman and Callahan had
been swimming in an unusually
heavy surf approximately 100 yards
off-shore. When they attempted to
return to the beach, they found
themselves unable to combat the
cross-tide surf and a current run
ning parallel to the surf.
Sunbathers on the beach spotted
the stranded couple, who were be
ing tossed about by the large waves.
Bol) Davis and Bill Frankland im
mediately swam to the rescue and
towed the exhausted students to
the beach.
Yesterday, Martha Smith, John
Ullman, and John Del Favero, at
tending a Phi Sigma Kappa beach
party, found themselves stranded
by the same rip tide while they
were swimming in the breakers.
They attempted to reach shore,
but became exhausted and had to
call for help.
"The undertow kept taking me
out." Miss Smith related. "The
breakers were battering me, and I
couldn't get my breath. I was too
tired to swim further."
Phi Sigs heard their cries, and
about ten members of the party
rushed into the surf and dragged
them to safety. All three were suf
fering from shock, but soon recov
ered.
