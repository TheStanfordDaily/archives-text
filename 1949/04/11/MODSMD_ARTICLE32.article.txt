# Encina Plans Spring Dance, 'The Big Swim'
## 
### 
Beach clothes of all sorts will be
the order of the day at a freshman
dance to be held April 30 by En-Â«
cina Hall. The name of the dance

is "The Big Swim," and decorations
will be on that motif.
Hal Mead and his nationally fa
mous dance band, straight from
Denver, will provide the music in
Encina's lounge from 9 p.m. to 1
a.m.
"The occasion will be an extra
special one because previous Encina
dances have been financial suc
cesses," Ed Brennan, publicity
chairman, announced.
Originally; costumes were to be
confined to swimming suits and
bathrobes, but protests from both
men and women made it necessary
to allow a greater diversity of beach
attire.
Tickets, at $1.20 a couple, will go
on sale to freshmen soon.
