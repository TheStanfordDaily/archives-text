## 
### 
Three new "junior artists in resi
dence" arrived at Stanford this
quarter, making the total four.
These scholarships, financed by the
National Theater Conference, allow
five months' study at the Univer
sity, F. Cowles Strickland, profes
sor of speech and drama, said yes
terday.
Working on technical problems
during their stay here are Jean
Hockett of Pasadena and James
Thompson of Vermont. Miss Hock
ett has done four summers' work at
the Playhouse in Eagles Mere. Pa.
She was also director of speech at

the Bessie Tift College in Georgia.
Thompson was director of Army
Special Services wartime produc
tion and technical director at Ben
â–  nington College.
Robin Humphrey of Now York
will study acting roles. She did one
1 year of professional radio in Chi
cago. played in the Broadway pro
duction of "Pygmalion" with Ger
trude Lawrence. She appeared in
"Playboy of the Western World"
with Burgess Meredith and under
studied in "Eastward in Eden" with
Beatrice Straight, and has appeared
in many other shows.
The "artist in residence" who also
attended Stanford during winter
quarter is Lillian E. Folster of New
Jersey, opera director. She assisted
Hans Burch at the advanced New
School of Social Research in New
York.
Strickland has pointed out the
threefold purpose which "artists in
residence" serve:
1. From the artists' point of view,
this plan enables them to gain extra
experience, to study roles and tech
niques they are interested in with
out the pressure of earning a living,
and perhaps to enter other or spe
cialized parts in the drama field.
2. From the speech and drama
students' point of view, "artists in
residence" provide a chance to work

closely with people who have had
outside experience. In this way stu
dents learn through observation, and
learn more because more "instruc
tors" are available to help with the
work.
3. From the University's point of
view, the scholarships enable more
and better theatrical productions
here. A greater number of plays
can be given because of extra help
in various lines of production, and
the work is of higher quality, in
general, because a person with ex
perience often tends to lift the en
lire staff or cast to his standards.
Stanford is* the only university in
the United States which has funds
contributed to it by the NTC for this
purpose. The plan is now in its third
year.
