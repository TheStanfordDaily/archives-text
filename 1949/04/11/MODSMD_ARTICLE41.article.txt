## Gay Bryan Stays Loose 
### 
Gay Bryan, perhaps the best all -
I around athlete in America today,
turned in one of the finest come
: through jobs in Stanford sports his
i tory. as he sparked Stanford to an
I impressive 74-57 win over UCLA,
Saturday in Los Angeles.
Bryr.n entered four events, took
| three firsts and a second, broke two
j meet records, shattered another
| school record, and chalked up a
I massive total of 18 points.
His out landing efforts proved his
great versatility and established
him as a definite threat to outscore
Tulare's Bob Mathias in their pro
| posed decathlon contest next sum
mer.
Bryan's marks Saturday:
Broad jump—25 4 :! 4
100-yard dash—9.B
220-yard dash—2l.o
High jump—<i 2-\s
It appears that there is no limit to
Bryan's ability either on the cinder
path or in the field.
Before the UCLA meet, he had
never run the sprints in competi
tion. Yet, he walked off with the
220 in the "good time of 21 fiat, and
was only two steps ofl" taking a 9.7
century.
His high jumping is consistently
good. Against COP, he went 6-5.
i and on a day when he isn't knock
| ing himself out running around be-
I tween events, it is conceivable that
he could get up high enough to
; break Stanford's school record of
6-7 3 /4, set in 1943 by Willard Smith.
At the moment, he is the best
' broad jumper in the country, a na
j tional contender in the high jump,
; among the top ten men in the 220,
I and as yet, he has not taken time
to develop his track specialty, the
low hurdles.
A movement is on to get Bryan
entered in every event on the pro
i gram. There's no telling what 'the
j guy would do.
