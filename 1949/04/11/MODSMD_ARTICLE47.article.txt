# Horsehiders Divide Pain; Meet Broncs, Bears Next

### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's fast-climbing varsity baseballers, now but a single
came out of first place, readied themselves for two forthcoming
CIBA "crucials" by splitting a pair of non-conference diamond
tilts over the weekend.
On Friday afternoon the Indians finished fast to edge by the
visiting Loyola Lions. 7 to 6, but on* -

Saturday it was a different story, as
a makeshift Card lineup blew an
early lead and lost to the USF Dons,
10 to 7.
The Indians will run up against
the talent-heavy Santa Clara Bron
cos tomorrow night, and the Califor
nia Bears Saturday, with the serv
ices of four regulars in doubt.
Ray Winterhalter, the Cards' pep
pery little secondsacker, and regu
lar first baseman Dick Clegg have
been out of action for several days
with sprained ankles. Winterhalter,
in addition, lias a badly swollen
finger on his throwing hand.
To add to Coach Harry Wolter's
other worries, catcher Jim Castignoli
has turned up with a fractured rib,
and Bud Klein, the big footballing
left fielder, who has been in and
out of the lineup all year with a

bum leg, is out of it at the moment.
With another heavy week of base
ball action coming up. Coach Wolter
has made the following changes in
his starting lineup:
1. Consistent Charlie Cole, the lit
tle ccnterfielder who had a good
weekend with the bat, rapping out
two for four in the Loyola game,
an.l three lor four against USF. has
be"m moved back to his old first
base job. Cole was the league's best
first sacker last year, and he will
be on the initial bag at least until
Cleug gets back into uniform.
2. Right fielder Blasting Bob Nava
returned to action in the Loyola
game after a two-week siege with
the medics in time .to drive home
Charlie Cole with the winning' run
in the ninth inning. Cole had pre
viously tripled and he came home
as Nava drilled a slashing single to
right to break a G to 6 deadlock.
3. Hustling Jim Mason saw his ;
first second base action of the year I
in place of injured Ray Winter- j
halter. Mason was the regular last
year, but had to sit out winter quarr !
ter for scholastic reasons, and Ls just
beginning to reach his 1918 form.
4. Rangy outfielder John Claypool
who has been doing big things with
the bat in CIBA play has been
moved over into center field to make
way for Nava in right. Soph Jim
Trabucco and transfer "Whitey"
Larson will probably divide time in
left field as long as Klein is out.
5. Veteran maskman Frank Muc-
Graw will have to shoulder the bur
:len of the catching load as long as
is out. The two have 1
been shaiing the receiving job. but'
MacGraw probably won't get any '
rest this week.
