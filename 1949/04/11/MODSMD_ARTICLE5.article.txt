# Dairy Official Backs Milk Ruling

### JIM THURBER 
Fraternities are public eating
I places, and should be forced to
| serve milk in individual containers,
a representative of the Golden Statf
, Milk Comoany said yesterday.
"Fraternities serve to the public
| as much as restaurants do," he con
tinued. "Only individual families in
! their own homes should be permit-
J ted to serve bulk milk."
In a Daily interview yesterday,
\ the Golden Stale representative was
j asked for his opinions concerning
j the state law requiring all public
I eating places to serve milk in indi-
I vidual containers.
"I think the law serves an impor
| t;int job to protect the public from
i milk contamination in public res
l taurants," he stated. If we were to
| exempt the fraternities, we would
I soon be swamped with requests

from private clubs, small boarding
houses, and the like for similar ex
emptions."
He recommended that the frater
nities buy milk in half-gallon paper
containers. This would raise the
milk price but slightly, and would
not take up too much extra room.
(Edson Piers, of Piers Dairy, said
last week that paper containers
were unsuited for use in fraterni
ties. and advised them to buy milk
m glass fcott'es.)
In reply to Piers' remark, the
Golden State representative said
that Piers probably was not equip
ped to handle the large number of
paper containers, and thus would
prefer to sell milk in bottles.
The representative said that ap
proximately three-quarters of all
milk r.old nowadays is in paper con
tainers, and that glass bottles would
soon be almost entirely replaced.
