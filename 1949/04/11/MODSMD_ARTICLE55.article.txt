## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Maintaining their undefeated sta- j
| tus, three Indian frosh teams i
j chalked up weekend victories. Fri- !
i day the tennis boys blasted San |
i Mateo JC. 5-4, and the golfers bur- \
; ied Menlo JC, 26-1. The next day
! the freshman nine came from be- '
i hind to down Oakland Tech, 7-6.
Ernie Dußray, continuing hi;> j
winning ways, defeated Ken Soren-
J son in a match that lacked good j
tennis. This feature on the varsity |
courts was a two-setter with the 1
! score 6-2, 7-5.
In the second singles Tom Lewyn
j had little trouble with Karl Bruhn,
| scoring a 6-2, 8-6 victory. The only
other Indian winner in the singles j
' was Johnny Gerlach, while Steve 1
Blumberg, Dean Brinkman, and
} Vaughn Manley dropped their -
I matches.

With the score tied at three
apiece, the all - important doubles [
teams went into action. Dußray
teamed with Brinkman to win the
first doubles, and Eric Javits-Blum
berg lost to the JC-ers in three sets.
The deciding point hanging in the
balance, Lewyn and Gerlach came
through with a nifty 6-4, 7-5 kill- \
ing. The final read Papooses 5. San j
Mateo 4.
Touring; the Stanford course with j
considerable ease, Dick McElyea
and Keith Beekman carded top
scores to lead the frosh to an easy
26 to 1 triumph, humbling their JC !
cousins from San Mateo. McElyea i

j missed par with a 75 and Beekman
j had a 76.
Both strokers won three point?
| for low. and their combined best
, ball chalked up another three. Jack
Sweeting and Bob Teitsworth won
a total of B',_>. as did Paul Palni
-1 quist and Frank Santa Cruz. Top
j effort for Menlo was an 81.
In their first Sunken Diamond
I test, Frank Sullivan was top battet
! for the frosh. getting three i'or four
i and scoring the winning run. The
I final tally came in the last half o.
i the ninth inning with the score at
: 6-all.
Sullivan was on second with a
single and bad toss, when seconJ
j baseman Jim Walsh stepped up to
: the plate and clobbered the ball
j clear to the fence for at least an
| unrecorded triple.
Getting to Rog Csenbaugh with
j considerable ease, the high school
i ers from across the Bay went into -j.
-5-1 early - inning lead. But the
| smooth relief hurling of Frank
| "Hambone"' Hamilton, who was
I credited with the victory, cooled,
j the Oaklanders down for a single
tally.
While the pitching of Hamilton
j was holding their opponents, the
, Indian big sticks began a late-in
> ning barrage that netted them six
I runs and the ball game.
