# Eisenhower Praises HR Work at UNESCO Conference
## 
### 
UNESCO by itself is nothing. It
is the schools, the communities, the
individuals working for interna
tional understanding who do the
real job. This idea was brought out
at the national UNESCO confer
ence which Bob von Pagenhardt and
Lois Keister attended last weekend
in Cleveland.
'"We felt that Stanford's work has
been an excellent example of how
the individuals work in this way,"
said von Pagenhardt. Many other
schools told of one or two projects
they had accomplished which in
volved only a few members of their
student bodies. The Farm delegates
realized that Stanford has accom
plished much more, as far as bring
ing individuals in contact with the
work is concerned, through the
many and diversified personal pro
grams under way at the present
time.
For example, they mentioned

large drives involving the entire
campus, discussion groups where all '
! students are welcome, the sending
of Stanford representatives to Eu
rope in the summer, and organiza
! tions such as "I" C!ub, intended es
; pecially to help foreign students
and American students to become
| acquainted.
Stanford delegates had been in- I
i structed to attempt to further other
; personalized projects such as the I
foreign scholarship plan, the stu- •
dent ships, and establishment of a j
! world student council for UNESCO.
They found that these all fit in with
problems already on the agenda for
: the conference.
Von Pagenhardt said, "That the 1
Stanford lIR is well known and re
spected was shown when a student ;
from Michigan took the floor in
j group discussion of all the colleges
represented and said that Chairman
1 Eisenhower had told him to be sure j

and talk to the Stanford delegates,
for in his opinion the Stanford lIR
was the best organized and most
: comprehensive student international
organization in the country."
Schools Doing Much
Officials also mentioned that they
would like to see the Stanford ar
; rangement, concerning the relation
ship of NSA to international organ
izations on university campuses, put
in effect throughout the nation. The
• lIR is in charge of all international
! activities of the Farm NSA group.
It was brought out by many of
the high officials of" UNESCO
speaking at the conference that the
j schools of the nation are doing the
! largest percentage of actual work
toward international understanding.
They felt that more should be done
j by outside individuals and commu
nities.
In attempting to bring the com
munity and younger school age

' persons into international work.
Stanford is again one of the leaders.
Von Pagenhardt stated that he
found that Stanford was one of the
few schools which sent speakers to
surrounding areas and was work
ing outside the campus proper. It
is the only school that is working
with an area council for other
groups—in this case high schools.
"Voice of America"
The State Department asked the
Farm delegates to speak on the
Voice ot America" radio program
while they were in Cleveland. Miss
Keister explained the Stanford for
eign scholarship plan and told some
i of the details of the welcome and
life of a foreign student on the cam
: pus. Von Pagenhardt related some
| of Stanford's contributions to edu
cational reconstruction which was
1 emphasized throughout the confer
j ence. fie told of such things as the
SIRO University of Berlin drive.

sending Stanford representative
abroad during the summer, and th
promotion of international under
standing in Northern Californi
high schools.
