# Indian Tracksters Trip Bruins
## Bryan, Chandler, Held, Hoff, Lyons Sparkle as Cindermen Romp 74-57

Sports Editoi, The Daily
Stanford's fleet and flying Indian Tracksters, performing to
perfection in the Westwood sunshine, rose up and smashed
UCLA's amazed Bruins, 74 to 57, Saturday in UCLA's own back
yard.
An overflow crowd watched Stanford's Gay Bryan, Bud Held,

and Otis Chandler set school and
meet records, and cheered as their
own Craig Dixon tied the world rec
ord in the low hurdles.
Jack Weiershauser's men arrived
in Los Angeles like a tornado intent
upon settling an 8-year-old score
with the Bruins, and in so doing,
ripped oft' three school records and
played a dominant role in the set
ting of six new meet standards.
Gay Cot's Wild
Galloping Gay Bryan, accounting
for 18 points all by himself, turned
in one of the best all-around track
and field performances in Stanford
history.
Gay Bryan won the broad jump
with a leap of 25 feet 4 :1 4 inches,
best jump in America this year, to
earn himself a new meet and all- j
time school record.
Gay Bryan won the 220-yard dash, !
first time he ever ran the event in ;
competition, rolling off an impres- j
sive 21 flat. That also earned him a -
new meet record.
Gay Bryan won the high jump at
6 feet 2 :i ,s inches, just working hard
enough to pick up his third first of
the day.
Gay Byan came within two feet
of winning the 100, being nosed out
by Bruin Jim Work in a 9.7 effort.
Bryan was clocked in 9.8.
Gay Bryan had himself a day. j
But even Bryan's greatness failed
to outshine several other Stanford
men, who came through with the I
best marks and efforts of their ca- J
reel's.
Chandler Ranks With Best
Powerful Otis Chandler estab
lished himself as an all-time great
in the shot-put.
Chandler is the fifth man in re- j
corded history ever to put 16 pounds
of iron over 56 feet. And with
Chandler, it's no fluke. In succes
sive tries, he tossed off efforts of
53-5. 55- 5, 55-1, 56-'4, 54-9, and
56-%.
Bud Held, third man in Stanford's
Big-Three, also added a little more
strong-arm to his previous marks, i
Held threw the javelin 224 feet BJ28 J 2
inches on his first try for another
meet and school record.
For the Bruins, Craig Dixon sal
vaged a share of the glory by bounc- ;
ing to a 14.1 win the high hurdles, I
and then tying the world's record in j
the lows at 22.5. He also ran the !
100, but went unplaced.
A 1 Lyons Upsets Balch
Stanford got off to a surprisingly
fast start in the meet when A 1 Lyons '
upset favored Royal Balch to cap
ture tiie mile in 4:20.6, best mark of !
Al's career.
He ran slightly off the pace for
three laps, and then kicked by the j
struggling Balch on the last turn.
His victory gave the Tribe a lead it
never relinquished.
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson
two-timed in the 440, with Larry
walking off with top honors at 43.4.
By that time, things were pretty
well in hand for the determined In
dians but they took pleasure in
adding insult to injury.
Don Campbell pulled himself over
13 feet to win the pole vault, and
George Van Huesen picked up an
other point by grabbing third.
Drew Ter remorse and George
Mooers surprised with a second and
third in the 880, strictly a foreign
proposition to the form charts of the
pre-meet dopesters.
Jack's Strategy Adds Up
Coach Weiershauser's strategic
switch of Gay Bryan to the sprints
paid off on all accounts, as brother
B'jb Bryan legged it home for a sec
ond in the lows, and leaped to a

third in the broad jump for gooi.'
measure.
The swefep in the shot put with
Low Davis and Norm Nourse both
out over 30 feet, and the second
and third by Downing McKee and
Dell Russell in the highs, didn't
hurt things a bit.
All in all, Stanford ran itself back
into national prominence in track
and field.
The come-through performances
by every man gave indication that
Stanford is going to be a tough cus
tomer for future foes. They also
made Stanford a leading contender
for the championship of the Pacific
Coast.
San Jose State, Compton College,
USC, and California come along ir
that order in dual meets.
And by the looks of things, even
USC. the PCC title, and the NCAA
championship are not out of reach.

An overflow crowd watched Stanford's Gay Bryan, Bud Held,

and Otis Chandler set school and
meet records, and cheered as their
own Craig Dixon tied the world rec
ord in the low hurdles.
Jack Weiershauser's men arrived
in Los Angeles like a tornado intent
upon settling an 8-year-old score
with the Bruins, and in so doing,
ripped oft' three school records and
played a dominant role in the set
ting of six new meet standards.
Gay Cot's Wild
Galloping Gay Bryan, accounting
for 18 points all by himself, turned
in one of the best all-around track
and field performances in Stanford
history.
Gay Bryan won the broad jump
with a leap of 25 feet 4 :1 4 inches,
best jump in America this year, to
earn himself a new meet and all- j
time school record.
Gay Bryan won the 220-yard dash, !
first time he ever ran the event in ;
competition, rolling off an impres- j
sive 21 flat. That also earned him a -
new meet record.
Gay Bryan won the high jump at
6 feet 2 :i ,s inches, just working hard
enough to pick up his third first of
the day.
Gay Byan came within two feet
of winning the 100, being nosed out
by Bruin Jim Work in a 9.7 effort.
Bryan was clocked in 9.8.
Gay Bryan had himself a day. j
But even Bryan's greatness failed
to outshine several other Stanford
men, who came through with the I
best marks and efforts of their ca- J
reel's.
Chandler Ranks With Best
Powerful Otis Chandler estab
lished himself as an all-time great
in the shot-put.
Chandler is the fifth man in re- j
corded history ever to put 16 pounds
of iron over 56 feet. And with
Chandler, it's no fluke. In succes
sive tries, he tossed off efforts of
53-5. 55- 5, 55-1, 56-'4, 54-9, and
56-%.
Bud Held, third man in Stanford's
Big-Three, also added a little more
strong-arm to his previous marks, i
Held threw the javelin 224 feet BJ28 J 2
inches on his first try for another
meet and school record.
For the Bruins, Craig Dixon sal
vaged a share of the glory by bounc- ;
ing to a 14.1 win the high hurdles, I
and then tying the world's record in j
the lows at 22.5. He also ran the !
100, but went unplaced.
A 1 Lyons Upsets Balch
Stanford got off to a surprisingly
fast start in the meet when A 1 Lyons '
upset favored Royal Balch to cap
ture tiie mile in 4:20.6, best mark of !
Al's career.
He ran slightly off the pace for
three laps, and then kicked by the j
struggling Balch on the last turn.
His victory gave the Tribe a lead it
never relinquished.
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson
two-timed in the 440, with Larry
walking off with top honors at 43.4.
By that time, things were pretty
well in hand for the determined In
dians but they took pleasure in
adding insult to injury.
Don Campbell pulled himself over
13 feet to win the pole vault, and
George Van Huesen picked up an
other point by grabbing third.
Drew Ter remorse and George
Mooers surprised with a second and
third in the 880, strictly a foreign
proposition to the form charts of the
pre-meet dopesters.
Jack's Strategy Adds Up
Coach Weiershauser's strategic
switch of Gay Bryan to the sprints
paid off on all accounts, as brother
B'jb Bryan legged it home for a sec
ond in the lows, and leaped to a

third in the broad jump for gooi.'
measure.
The swefep in the shot put with
Low Davis and Norm Nourse both
out over 30 feet, and the second
and third by Downing McKee and
Dell Russell in the highs, didn't
hurt things a bit.
All in all, Stanford ran itself back
into national prominence in track
and field.
The come-through performances
by every man gave indication that
Stanford is going to be a tough cus
tomer for future foes. They also
made Stanford a leading contender
for the championship of the Pacific
Coast.
San Jose State, Compton College,
USC, and California come along ir
that order in dual meets.
And by the looks of things, even
USC. the PCC title, and the NCAA
championship are not out of reach.

with the Bruins, and in so doing,
ripped oft' three school records and
played a dominant role in the set
ting of six new meet standards.
Gay Cot's Wild
Galloping Gay Bryan, accounting
for 18 points all by himself, turned
in one of the best all-around track
and field performances in Stanford
history.
Gay Bryan won the broad jump
with a leap of 25 feet 4 :1 4 inches,
best jump in America this year, to
earn himself a new meet and all- j
time school record.
Gay Bryan won the 220-yard dash, !
first time he ever ran the event in ;
competition, rolling off an impres- j
sive 21 flat. That also earned him a -
new meet record.
Gay Bryan won the high jump at
6 feet 2 :i ,s inches, just working hard
enough to pick up his third first of
the day.
Gay Byan came within two feet
of winning the 100, being nosed out
by Bruin Jim Work in a 9.7 effort.
Bryan was clocked in 9.8.
Gay Bryan had himself a day. j
But even Bryan's greatness failed
to outshine several other Stanford
men, who came through with the I
best marks and efforts of their ca- J
reel's.
Chandler Ranks With Best
Powerful Otis Chandler estab
lished himself as an all-time great
in the shot-put.
Chandler is the fifth man in re- j
corded history ever to put 16 pounds
of iron over 56 feet. And with
Chandler, it's no fluke. In succes
sive tries, he tossed off efforts of
53-5. 55- 5, 55-1, 56-'4, 54-9, and
56-%.
Bud Held, third man in Stanford's
Big-Three, also added a little more
strong-arm to his previous marks, i
Held threw the javelin 224 feet BJ28 J 2
inches on his first try for another
meet and school record.
For the Bruins, Craig Dixon sal
vaged a share of the glory by bounc- ;
ing to a 14.1 win the high hurdles, I
and then tying the world's record in j
the lows at 22.5. He also ran the !
100, but went unplaced.
A 1 Lyons Upsets Balch
Stanford got off to a surprisingly
fast start in the meet when A 1 Lyons '
upset favored Royal Balch to cap
ture tiie mile in 4:20.6, best mark of !
Al's career.
He ran slightly off the pace for
three laps, and then kicked by the j
struggling Balch on the last turn.
His victory gave the Tribe a lead it
never relinquished.
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson
two-timed in the 440, with Larry
walking off with top honors at 43.4.
By that time, things were pretty
well in hand for the determined In
dians but they took pleasure in
adding insult to injury.
Don Campbell pulled himself over
13 feet to win the pole vault, and
George Van Huesen picked up an
other point by grabbing third.
Drew Ter remorse and George
Mooers surprised with a second and
third in the 880, strictly a foreign
proposition to the form charts of the
pre-meet dopesters.
Jack's Strategy Adds Up
Coach Weiershauser's strategic
switch of Gay Bryan to the sprints
paid off on all accounts, as brother
B'jb Bryan legged it home for a sec
ond in the lows, and leaped to a

third in the broad jump for gooi.'
measure.
The swefep in the shot put with
Low Davis and Norm Nourse both
out over 30 feet, and the second
and third by Downing McKee and
Dell Russell in the highs, didn't
hurt things a bit.
All in all, Stanford ran itself back
into national prominence in track
and field.
The come-through performances
by every man gave indication that
Stanford is going to be a tough cus
tomer for future foes. They also
made Stanford a leading contender
for the championship of the Pacific
Coast.
San Jose State, Compton College,
USC, and California come along ir
that order in dual meets.
And by the looks of things, even
USC. the PCC title, and the NCAA
championship are not out of reach.

Sports Editoi, The Daily
Stanford's fleet and flying Indian Tracksters, performing to
perfection in the Westwood sunshine, rose up and smashed
UCLA's amazed Bruins, 74 to 57, Saturday in UCLA's own back
yard.
An overflow crowd watched Stanford's Gay Bryan, Bud Held,
