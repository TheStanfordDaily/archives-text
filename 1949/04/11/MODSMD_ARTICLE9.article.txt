# Fabulous Characters Molded History of Farm
## 
### GORDON McKIBBON 
The Farm—3,ooo acres with a col
orful history all its own. In the
pre-Stanford era it was built around
the personalities of the men who
owned the land.
For all practical purposes, that
period began in 1839 when Don An
tonio Buelna built the first house

in the area beside San Francisquito
Creek, which was much larger than
the impotent-appearing stream of
today. The house was located on
land just north of the present golf
course.
The end of the Mexican period
! came about 1850 with the arrival of
| American land-grabbers and squat
ters. These men took over choice
plots of land, hoping that the U.S.
government would open the land to
homesteaders.
Mad Frenchman Owned Land
In 1869 Senator Leland Stanford
bought his famed Palo Alto Farm,
i but the great railroad tycoon had
to share local renown with another
j personage, the fabulous Frenchman,
M. Peter CouLts. Coutts had ac
quired a large plot of land, com
prising that portion which now in
j eludes most of the Quad and other
■ University buildings, and wasted no
i time in building up a reputation for
eccentricity.
He was known as a free spender,
j and many evidences of his spending
j and planning can still be seen to
; day. About a third of a mile past
Brnaner Hall on Escondido Road
are two structures built by the
Frenchman, a large house known as

; Eseondido Cottage and a brick tow
j ?r, used by Coutts as a library.
Coutts Noted for Weird Habits
Frenchman's Road, at the south-
I west corner of the caniptis, was
| once under an artificial lake made
iby Coutts. Near the road are
J Frenchman's Bridge, a small dam,
j and the remains of some other
1 structures he built. Another brick
; tower and a second dam give added
I testimony to the legend of the
! Frenchman.
j Such oddities as the Frenchman
| studying every morning from 1 un
! til 6. and telling Paul Bunyan sto
' ries, French style, furnished the
neighbors with plenty ol gossip. It
j was his money, or more particular
ly, how he got it, that was the really
j hot topic, however.
Different sources .claimed that he
j stole S5 mi'lion from the French
army, and that he stole a huge
I amount from his brother's bank ac
j count, but all these sources agreed
that he was hiding from French of
! ficials while here.
Claimed Enemy of Napoleon
In an interview with a Stanford
professor in 1927, a relative of
J Coutts settled the matter by stating
| that the Frenchman was merely a
political exile who disagreed dan
| gerously with Napoleon 111 and felt
j a necessity for getting far away
i from home. Coutts later sold out
j to Leland Stanford and returned to
I France.
During this time Mayfield and
! Menlo Park were the two closest
communities to the Farm. The lat
ter was composed largely of serv
| ants and workers from the huge es
j tates of Stanford, Hopkins, and
: others.
Palo Alto clid not appear until
