WASHINGTON, April 11 (AP). —Heavy sniping against the
Marshall Plan as a spur to World War 111 and a "steal" on Ameri
can taxpayers broke out in House debate on a 55,380,000,000
European Recovery Bill today.
The House is working on its own version of the bill, which is

$200,000,000 under the bill approved
by the Senate last week.
Republican critics took the lead,
but some Democrats also joined in
the attack. Others staunchly de
defended the aid project.
Rep. White (D., Calif.) told the
House:
'The Atlantic Pact is all right, but
let's stop this spending plan where
(it is."
White said the huge recovery
program is making the American
people "the goat, just like they were
alter the first World War."
The Californian predicted the on
set of World War 111 if "unneces
sary spending is not stopped and we
do not make the United Nations a
true instrument of peace."
Rep. Sadowski (D„ Mich.) said
the Marshall Plan is "stealing"
money needed to build schools and
hospitals in this country while it is
used for such things as building an
opera house in Vienna.
