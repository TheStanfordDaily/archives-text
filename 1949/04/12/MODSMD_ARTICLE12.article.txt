catcher on the Stanford varsity
baseball team for the past three
seasons, was yesterday de
clared ineligible for further
competition because he had
played professional baseball
during the war.

mitted to SAC officials that he
had played a season of pro ball with
two minor league teams after his
professional career was revealed
yesterday morning by the Oakland
Post Enquirer.

the California State League for the
1941-42 season. He was optioned tc
La Mesa and released June 3. Ht
then signed with Salt Lake City o.

was reserved for the 1943 season.
Frank was immediately barrec
