### BILL SWIGART 
Frank MacGraw, first - string
catcher on the Stanford varsity
baseball team for the past three
seasons, was yesterday de
clared ineligible for further
competition because he had
played professional baseball
during the war.
The big Stanford maskman ad
mitted to SAC officials that he
had played a season of pro ball with
two minor league teams after his
professional career was revealed
yesterday morning by the Oakland
Post Enquirer.
According to the Oakland paper.

the California State League for the
1941-42 season. He was optioned tc
La Mesa and released June 3. Ht
then signed with Salt Lake City o.
the Pioneer League on June 13 ana
was reserved for the 1943 season.
Frank was immediately barrec
from further competition until offi
cial word is received from the CIBA
I office.
The loss of MacGraw came as o
! shock to Coach Harry Wolter, who
! had planned to start Frank in to
night's all-important CIBA contest
with the league-leading Santa Clara
I Broncos. It also left the Stanford
team without an experienced re
| ceiver, as Jim Castagnoli. who has
been dividing time behind the plate
with MacGraw this year, is present
ly benched with a broken rib.
The source of the Oakland paper's
1 tip was not immediately forthcom
| in-}, but Coach Wolter said last night
that he hoped it would be deter
' mined and made public within the
| next few days.
The Post Enquirer story said that
the information came as a result of
an inquiry by "a CIBA official" tc
professional Minor Leagues Presi
dent George Troutman.
Just which CIBA official had in
j vestigated MacGraw's ineligibility
the Post Enquirer did not say.
! Coach Clint Evans of the University
j of California, who is president of
: the conference, denied having any
knowledge of the investigation. The
j other CIBA officers are Art Reichle
| of UCLA and Mike Welds of Santa
Clara.
|
It is not yet known whether Mae
i Graw's ineligibility will have any
bearing on the outcome of the CIBA
games in which he has already par
' ticipated.
Stanford Athletic Publicity Di
! rector Don Liebendorfer said that
"the athletic department has not en
tered into any discussion with the
CIBA on the matter."
The only game that might be af
fected would be last week's win
over Santa Clara. MacGraw did not
participate in the California game
which the Cards won 12 to 3.
Frank told an Associated Press

reporter that he was sorry that the
matter had been brought up, and
that he hoped it wouldn't hurt
Coach Wolter, the team, or the
school.
'"When I signed the Santa Bar
bara contract, I was just out of high
school and I only played a short
time," the Stanford catcher said.
"I then served two years in the
Navy. Upon returning, I thought
that my record was clear, because
of the situation that existed during
the war when rules covering pro
and amateur athletes were gener
ally laxly enforced."
MacGraw is playing his fourth
year of baseball for Stanford. He
took over the starting job as a
freshman in 1946, and has at least
divided the first-string chores ever
since.
