WASHINGTON, April 11. —Her-
bert Hoover testified today that the
Army, Navy, and Air Force are
"padding" their money requests to
Congress by millions of dollars.
He also accused them of "star
tling" waste and extravagance.
The former President, appearing
before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, cited an Air Force re
quest for funds to build 910 family
homes in Alaska costing $58,350
each.
He noted the Army wanted $100,-

000 each to modernize 102 M-26
tanks it doesn't even have.
Then, he said, there was the little
matter of a $30,000,000 clerical error
in requesting $39,000,000 for 69 Na
tional Guard 155-millimeter how
itzers which would actually cost
only $9,000,000.
Hoover told the committee that
what the Department of National
Defense needs is a good bookkeep
ing system.
'"At the present time," he said,
"nobody can tell the cost of any

particular function in the armed |
services."

staff today blamed suffocation in
the tragedy which had much of the
world watching anxiously for more
than two days.

strangulation by a rope tossed o
her aid as a cause of c'eath, and ap
parently rules out drowning in a
musty old water well.

Then, he said, there was the little
matter of a $30,000,000 clerical error
in requesting $39,000,000 for 69 Na
tional Guard 155-millimeter how
itzers which would actually cost
only $9,000,000.

'"At the present time," he said,
"nobody can tell the cost of any

particular function in the armed |

Kathy Fiscus' own fright at her
plunge clown an abandoned 200-foot j
well may have brought her death,
surgeons said today.
In a preliminary autopsy report, :
three doctors from the coroner's |
staff today blamed suffocation in
the tragedy which had much of the
world watching anxiously for more
than two days.
The deputy county coroner said
that the report definitely eliminates
strangulation by a rope tossed o
her aid as a cause of c'eath, and ap
parently rules out drowning in a
musty old water well.

SAN RAFAEL, April It. —Five
College of Marin students who
startled residents last Tuesday night
by staging a mock gangland style
shooting, pleaded guilty in police
court today to charges of disturbing
the peace.
A theater cashier fainted and
about 100 citizens went scurrying
for shelter when the youths drove
up in front of a theater, shouted to
the victim, "Take that, you rat," and
started shooting blank shells. The
"victim" took on a death-like hue
with the well-timed application of
a quantity of catsup.
The youths said the prank was
part of their initiation into a college
organizaiton. the Xanthus Club.
