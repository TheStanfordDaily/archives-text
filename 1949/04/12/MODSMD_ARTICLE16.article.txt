### JOHN BUSH 
A group of three U. S. Navy documentary war films was pre
sented Thursday night at Burgess Theater, Stanford Village
They depicted Navy submarine life in the Western Pacific, the
Army-Marine Corps invasion of Pelelieu, and the Kamikaze at
tacks on the fleet at Okinawa.
The informal program commenced with a short talk by Cap-

tain Ransom K. Davis, Stanford
NROTC commandant, on the role ot
the Naval Reserve in war and peace.
Davis pointed out that nine out o:
10 wartime officers were reservists,
and extended commendations to
them for their performance. Cap
tain Davis also told of the valuable
part in the national security bein
done by the Navy, particularly the
Mediterranean fleet.
The first picture, "SiLent Service,"
gave a very intimate picture of con
ditions on American subs, with sev
eral tine shots of actual torpedo and
deck gun attacks on Japanese war
ships and merchant sliipping. A
humorous note was supplied by j.
scene of sailors boarding a Jap fish
ing boat with all the whooping of .1
band of Barbaray pirates.
The second film, "Fury in the
Pacific," was an actual combat pic
ture taken in the toughest days 01
the Pelelieu invasion. It vividl>
brought home to the armchair gen
erals just how much is involved ir.
prying - thousands of Japs from hills
honeycombed with caves, covered
with brush so thick they were in
visible from even a relatively short
distance. Several military photogra
phers fell during the filming o:
these scenes, a testimonial to th.
fury of the fighting.
The last reel was taken from the
decks of ships in the Okinawa fleet
It told well the tale of the Navy
gunners who saved the fleet front
the desperate attempts of the Kami
kazes to wipe it out.
At the meeting, six local resevv;
officers were administered the oath
by Captain Davis and given perma
nent commissions.
Yeoman Dan Hollywood of Men.
Park announced that further show
ings of the Navy war films is fceinc
considered for the near future.
