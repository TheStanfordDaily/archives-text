# Fam Director of Admissions Tells of Applicants' Plight
## 
### 
It isn't easy to get into any college or university these days.
This was the message delivered at Spokane, Washington, last
Friday night by Dr. Alfred H. Grommon, Director of Admissions
at Stanford. The occasion was the first Stanford alumni confer
ence to be held in this Northwest city.
Speaking at the University Club Dr. Grommon pointed out that
• lost of the universities of our coun-'f

try have far more qualified appli
cants then they ean possibly admit.
He reported that Stanford could ad
mit only one out of every three ap
plicants last year, of those who met |

the University's minimum require
ments.
While many schools had a small
drop in the number of applications
lor admission last year, Stanford's
exceeded the previous all-time high
by 1(5 per cent, and current evidence
indicates no letup in the 1949-50 ad
missions pressure," he stated.
Dr. Grommon had some words of
advice for parents who have sons
and daughters in high school.
"Make your plans early in the
propective applicant's school career,
and make sure that they have taken
the necessary subjects they will need
for the university they wish to at
tend. And make sure that your chil
dren realize that the sophomore,
junior, and senior years are the
critical ones scholastically if they
war.t to continue on to college," he
advised.
He also urged parents not to ig
nore the importance of a well
rounded school life, since evidence
of leadership and good citizenship
are always qualities of interest to
university admissions committees.
Dr. Grommon pointed out that the
most valuable recommendations on
a student's personal qualifications
come from their school principals
and teachers—not from prominent
alumni who are friends of dad or
mother.
