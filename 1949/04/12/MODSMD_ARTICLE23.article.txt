# Stanford Review Criticizes Laws on Sexual Psychopaths
## 
### JOHN BUSH 
The Stanford Law Review today
criticized California laws on sexual
psychopaths as confused, defective,
and difficult to apply.
The article, "Sane Laws for Sex
ual Psychopaths," aimed its major
I criticism at the section of the Wel
| fare and Institutions Code which
| permits courts to suspend criminal
proceedings against such persons
and commit them to state hospitals.
The article pointed out that under
this practice the charge may never
be heard, and the psychopath freed
after a relatively short time, al
though he is not cured.
As summed up by the review, the
situation is this:
When tl le prisoner is found by
j the court to be a sexual psycho
| path, he may be committed to an
institution before trial. Upon certi

fication by the hospital director that
further treatment is useless, he is
returned to the court for further
disposition of his case.
This means that the accused may
be tried only for his alleged crimi
nal acts, but may not be recommit
ted. The lapse of time between the
original hearing and the psycho
path's release from the mental hos
pital makes conviction almost im
possible. The witnesses may no
longer be available, and their mem
ories, dimmed by time, are too often
inaccurate.
The article attacked the Welfare
Code on two points. It suggested
that the public would receive great
er protection if the criminal charge
were tried before commitment, thus
avoiding the difficulties of a de
layed trial. It further took issue
with the provision allowing the hos
pital superintendent to return the
prisoner when he deems further
treatment of no benefit. It declared
that the psychopath should be re
leased only after he is fully cured.
