## Those Rio Crosstides 
### 
Eight students have been caught in the dangerous crosstide
current at Rio del Mar in the last two weeks. The seemingly
large number of students in distress at the beach actually is a
normal number because of the large turnout of swimmers.
The problem worrying us, however, is when will one or more
of the Farm swimmers get caught in the crosstide and not be
able to be heard from shore. Several students reported to us
yesterday that they heard swimmers shouting for help. But
everyone shouts down at the beach and the distress calls went
unheeded.
The best we can do editorially is to describe the nature of
those tides and to advise what precaution should be adopted.
Rio crosstides are strongest 100 yards or more from shore.
The strongest swimmers will sometimes exhaust themselves by
trying to swim to shore or by stalling for time by treading
water. When this exhaustion sets in, the swimmer soon gives
up all care for survival and disappears from sight. Meanwhile,
the crosstide carries the swimmer parallel to the shore. It's like
climbing a wallâ€”you can run alongside of the barrier, but you
cannot always climb it.
As a cautionary suggestion we offer this point. Do not wade
out too far into the surf. Old swimmers rarely go in ocean
water to a depth over their thighs, for at that depth the waves
break at chest height.
Scientists scoff at the factor of chance, luck, or providence.
Instead they speak of probability. Avoid that mathematical
probability figxire. Stay in water where you have a sure footing,
families and friends want you to have some fun, but they
also want you to stay alive to enjoy that fun a little longer.
