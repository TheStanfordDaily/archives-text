To the Editor:
This seems to be as good a time as any for a statement regarding the
r H 'lic> The Daily in regard to the editing of the Letters to the Editor.
] have always believed that it was customary to denote deletions in the text
by three or four dots. This gives the reader an opportunity to see where
material from the original text has been omitted.
If this system is not used, I believe it is only fair to declare, at appro
priate intervals, that letters are not always printed in full and that
deletions are sometimes made.
My letter regarding the review of "Symphony Pastoral" was not printed
in lull, and the reasons are readily apparent. Critical references to the
general quality of The Daily were omitted for obvious reasons. Also a
ct ncluding statement about the reviewer was deleted, probably because
hkins are getting perilously thin in The Daily Shack.
I do not for a moment question the right of The Daily to edit material;
I do think that, in iairness to the writers, omissions be indicated in some
manner.

(Editors Note: A few Daily stalT members have "perilously thin"
skins because they sunbathed too long. Reader Peverieri's first letter
to Hie Dailj was trimmed because it was too long and repetitious. We
reserve the right to shorten any letter over 150 words, as long as its
meaning is not distorted. Since we usually changc several words in
every letter to conform with Daily style, the dots are omitted.)
