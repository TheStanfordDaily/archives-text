## Atlantic Pact No Bar To Red Aggression 
### 
For Western Europe, the North
Atlantic Pact is a relieving token in
that it should prevent the Russians
from attacking isolated countries
through surprise and then letting
the world be faced with a "fait ac
compli. 1 There will be no second
edition of the Prague coup.
However, the pact does not re
move the possibility of aggression
itscif. And here, European think
ing parts from opinions held by
Americans.
In (he United States, those who
think that Russia could win a war
are few. So deep is the feeling of
security afforded by two wide
oceans, so great is the faith in the
atomic bomb that no one can even
begin to think of an American de
feat
In Western Europe the problem is
different. Here is a narrow fringe of
land with practically no natural de
fenses. An aggressor coming from
the East would have cve-ry chance
of occupying Western Europe within
a very short time, unless the armies
of the invaded countries, entirely
mobilized, are ready on the hour the
attack is made.
Therefore, to become effective, the
North Atlantic Pact should be so
developed as to:
1. Make the European powers able
to devote a larger part of their na
tional budgets to rearmament. The
EJRP program provides the means
for this.
2. Make it possible for Western
Europe to obtain arms through a
lend-lease agreement or through
special allotments similar to the

present Greek-Turkish aid program.
3. Ultimately reinforce US troops I
in Europe in order that any Euro- i
pean deficiency in effective force or
armament be remedied.
If such steps are promptly carried
out, they will remove Europe's last
hesitations, which are wholly die- j
tated by the fear of displeasing Rus
sia at a time when there is nothing ;
to oppose her with.
This does not mean that Western '
Europe is looking for war. In the I
first place, at the present time there j
is no valid ground to assume that
a war against the Soviet Union
would be successful. On the con
trary, it would bring about a Soviet !
occupation, which is exactly what !
Western Europe wants to avoid.
Second, the Europeans would not j
have endeavored to rebuild their i
war-devastated countries if the next
move were to renew hostilities.
However, peace is one thing and
appeasement is another. No Euro
pean will ever again make the mis- ;
take of supposing the two synony- !
mous.
If it is peace to give up all means
of resistance to future aggression, i
then peace means suicide.
II it is peace to let a small but
well-organized faction carry out the
orders of a foreign power, then peace
is an encouragement to treason.
Europeans have been slow in
making up their minds because they
did not want to be the sports of
imperialistic designs or capitalist
plans to make war on Russia. If
the latter had refrained from enforc
ing the Marxist plan of world con

quest, there would not have been
any Atlantic pact of defense today.
Yet, compared to Hitler's propa
ganda of 10 years ago, Communist
i techniques of persuasion have been
| more skillful in preparing the
: ground for war and occupation,
j They have excluded nationalism
and "herrenvolk" doctrines from
, their program. In using propaganda
devices to inspire fear, they have
| been careful to depict their oppo
nents, never themselves, as the po
i tential aggressors, whereas the Nazis
delighted in showing off the Wehr
| macht and the Luftwaffe.
Unfortunately for the Commu
nists, three major factors have lost
; them most of the support they had
| acquired by 1945, the year when
j Soviet popularity was at its peak:
1. Failure to justify their pro-
German policy between September,
and June, 1941.
2. Repeated attempts to wreck the
ERP.
.5. Open allegiance of their lead
ers in Western Europe to the Soviet
I Union.
In the past months Europe has
made *,reat progress in the struggle
against Communism. It will do more
in the future, using its own re-
I sources.
In the meantime, if Americans
want to maintain their first lines of
defense and thereby, as in the past,
keep their continent from becoming
a cockpit of war, they will have to
reinforce Europe's defense without
delay.

think that Russia could win a war
are few. So deep is the feeling of
security afforded by two wide
oceans, so great is the faith in the
atomic bomb that no one can even
begin to think of an American de
feat
In Western Europe the problem is
different. Here is a narrow fringe of
land with practically no natural de
fenses. An aggressor coming from
the East would have cve-ry chance
of occupying Western Europe within
a very short time, unless the armies
of the invaded countries, entirely
mobilized, are ready on the hour the
attack is made.
Therefore, to become effective, the
North Atlantic Pact should be so
developed as to:
1. Make the European powers able
to devote a larger part of their na
tional budgets to rearmament. The
EJRP program provides the means
for this.
2. Make it possible for Western
Europe to obtain arms through a
lend-lease agreement or through
special allotments similar to the

present Greek-Turkish aid program.
3. Ultimately reinforce US troops I
in Europe in order that any Euro- i
pean deficiency in effective force or
armament be remedied.
If such steps are promptly carried
out, they will remove Europe's last
hesitations, which are wholly die- j
tated by the fear of displeasing Rus
sia at a time when there is nothing ;
to oppose her with.
This does not mean that Western '
Europe is looking for war. In the I
first place, at the present time there j
is no valid ground to assume that
a war against the Soviet Union
would be successful. On the con
trary, it would bring about a Soviet !
occupation, which is exactly what !
Western Europe wants to avoid.
Second, the Europeans would not j
have endeavored to rebuild their i
war-devastated countries if the next
move were to renew hostilities.
However, peace is one thing and
appeasement is another. No Euro
pean will ever again make the mis- ;
take of supposing the two synony- !
mous.
If it is peace to give up all means
of resistance to future aggression, i
then peace means suicide.
II it is peace to let a small but
well-organized faction carry out the
orders of a foreign power, then peace
is an encouragement to treason.
Europeans have been slow in
making up their minds because they
did not want to be the sports of
imperialistic designs or capitalist
plans to make war on Russia. If
the latter had refrained from enforc
ing the Marxist plan of world con

quest, there would not have been
any Atlantic pact of defense today.
Yet, compared to Hitler's propa
ganda of 10 years ago, Communist
i techniques of persuasion have been
| more skillful in preparing the
: ground for war and occupation,
j They have excluded nationalism
and "herrenvolk" doctrines from
, their program. In using propaganda
devices to inspire fear, they have
| been careful to depict their oppo
nents, never themselves, as the po
i tential aggressors, whereas the Nazis
delighted in showing off the Wehr
| macht and the Luftwaffe.
Unfortunately for the Commu
nists, three major factors have lost
; them most of the support they had

j Soviet popularity was at its peak:
1. Failure to justify their pro-
German policy between September,
and June, 1941.
2. Repeated attempts to wreck the

.5. Open allegiance of their lead
ers in Western Europe to the Soviet
I Union.
In the past months Europe has
made *,reat progress in the struggle
against Communism. It will do more
in the future, using its own re-

In the meantime, if Americans
want to maintain their first lines of

keep their continent from becoming

of the invaded countries, entirely
mobilized, are ready on the hour the
attack is made.
Therefore, to become effective, the
North Atlantic Pact should be so
developed as to:
1. Make the European powers able
to devote a larger part of their na
tional budgets to rearmament. The
EJRP program provides the means
for this.
2. Make it possible for Western
Europe to obtain arms through a
lend-lease agreement or through
special allotments similar to the

present Greek-Turkish aid program.
3. Ultimately reinforce US troops I
in Europe in order that any Euro- i
pean deficiency in effective force or
armament be remedied.
If such steps are promptly carried
out, they will remove Europe's last
hesitations, which are wholly die- j
tated by the fear of displeasing Rus
sia at a time when there is nothing ;
to oppose her with.
This does not mean that Western '
Europe is looking for war. In the I
first place, at the present time there j
is no valid ground to assume that
a war against the Soviet Union
would be successful. On the con
trary, it would bring about a Soviet !
occupation, which is exactly what !
Western Europe wants to avoid.
Second, the Europeans would not j
have endeavored to rebuild their i
war-devastated countries if the next
move were to renew hostilities.
However, peace is one thing and
appeasement is another. No Euro
pean will ever again make the mis- ;
take of supposing the two synony- !
mous.
If it is peace to give up all means
of resistance to future aggression, i
then peace means suicide.
II it is peace to let a small but
well-organized faction carry out the
orders of a foreign power, then peace
is an encouragement to treason.
Europeans have been slow in
making up their minds because they
did not want to be the sports of
imperialistic designs or capitalist
plans to make war on Russia. If
the latter had refrained from enforc
ing the Marxist plan of world con

quest, there would not have been
any Atlantic pact of defense today.
Yet, compared to Hitler's propa
ganda of 10 years ago, Communist
i techniques of persuasion have been
| more skillful in preparing the
: ground for war and occupation,
j They have excluded nationalism
and "herrenvolk" doctrines from
, their program. In using propaganda
devices to inspire fear, they have
| been careful to depict their oppo
nents, never themselves, as the po
i tential aggressors, whereas the Nazis
delighted in showing off the Wehr
| macht and the Luftwaffe.
Unfortunately for the Commu
nists, three major factors have lost
; them most of the support they had
| acquired by 1945, the year when
j Soviet popularity was at its peak:
1. Failure to justify their pro-
German policy between September,
and June, 1941.
2. Repeated attempts to wreck the
ERP.
.5. Open allegiance of their lead
ers in Western Europe to the Soviet
I Union.
In the past months Europe has
made *,reat progress in the struggle
against Communism. It will do more
in the future, using its own re-
I sources.
In the meantime, if Americans
want to maintain their first lines of
defense and thereby, as in the past,
keep their continent from becoming
a cockpit of war, they will have to
reinforce Europe's defense without
delay.
