## Bull Session 
### 
STANFORD IS THE PLACE .... where all the students complain that
the roads are poor, and then complain twice as much while they're being
fixed, because the torn-up places hamper the one-armed driving on the
way home from Rossot's .... where everyone is crossing his fingers and
hopefully looking forward to next football season .... where the school
color is cardinal, which explains why the chairs in the Excom room are
done in blue ... . where the University's orphaned crew gets a financial
helping hand from a sophomore class which hasn't forgotten that one
of the prerequisites of the sport of crew is the idea of everyone pulling
together .... where Ram's Head is such a cliquish "closed corporation"'
that a spring show script was chosen ♦hat provides parts for a mere £4
persons (plus crew and orchestra), probably setting some sort of a record
for hugeness for the annual spring production.
Stanford is The Place .... where friends of one of the local "roughs"
throw a birthday party for him, and then bring as presents a dozen different
varieties of (so help me) . . . bed pans .... Where the girls don't know
anything' about driving automobiles unless they happen to be sitting in
the back seat .... where, in a period of 10 minutes, out of 15 persons
v/ho came into the Cellar and picked up a paper off the newsstand, exactly
three actually bought the paper .... where Rossotti's, which hasn ; t
been owned by the original Emilio Rossotti for almost a year now. has
not, and never will cease to be reverently referred to by Stanfordites as
"Rossot's" .... where the Dekes liven up their Back-to-the-Farm ex
change dinner by bringing in an elderly tramp off the street and putting
him at the head of the table, while their Durand House exchangees gaped
. . . and then gaped a little more .... where the ASSU Bulletin Board
has, for the past year and a half listed Men's Council meetings for Tues
day at 4:15, when they actually meet on Tuesdays at 1:15 ... . and
where, on the porch just 15 steps away from the room where Men's Council
holds its sessions, repose two empty jugs of (ugh!) Mountain View Port
Wine! .... where if the coeds were graded on the basis of "curves,"
at least 90 per cent of them would flunk.
And where do all these wonderful, paradoxical happenings occur? Right
here, right around you as you sit there reading this . . . over that cup
of coffee, or in your 9 o'clock when you should be taking notes (and why
aren't you?). They are the human side of an institution whose largeness
al! too frequently gives the individual a feeling of being a very small
potato in an extremely large field. They are the impressions of college
yctrs that will be remembered by you and me long after we've forgotten
the order of succession of the Kings of England.
They are the things that make us so sure that . . . Stanford is The
Place.

together .... where Ram's Head is such a cliquish "closed corporation"'
that a spring show script was chosen ♦hat provides parts for a mere £4
persons (plus crew and orchestra), probably setting some sort of a record
for hugeness for the annual spring production.
Stanford is The Place .... where friends of one of the local "roughs"
throw a birthday party for him, and then bring as presents a dozen different
varieties of (so help me) . . . bed pans .... Where the girls don't know
anything' about driving automobiles unless they happen to be sitting in
the back seat .... where, in a period of 10 minutes, out of 15 persons
v/ho came into the Cellar and picked up a paper off the newsstand, exactly
three actually bought the paper .... where Rossotti's, which hasn ; t
been owned by the original Emilio Rossotti for almost a year now. has
not, and never will cease to be reverently referred to by Stanfordites as
"Rossot's" .... where the Dekes liven up their Back-to-the-Farm ex
change dinner by bringing in an elderly tramp off the street and putting
him at the head of the table, while their Durand House exchangees gaped
. . . and then gaped a little more .... where the ASSU Bulletin Board
has, for the past year and a half listed Men's Council meetings for Tues
day at 4:15, when they actually meet on Tuesdays at 1:15 ... . and
where, on the porch just 15 steps away from the room where Men's Council
holds its sessions, repose two empty jugs of (ugh!) Mountain View Port
Wine! .... where if the coeds were graded on the basis of "curves,"
at least 90 per cent of them would flunk.
And where do all these wonderful, paradoxical happenings occur? Right
here, right around you as you sit there reading this . . . over that cup
of coffee, or in your 9 o'clock when you should be taking notes (and why
aren't you?). They are the human side of an institution whose largeness
al! too frequently gives the individual a feeling of being a very small
potato in an extremely large field. They are the impressions of college
yctrs that will be remembered by you and me long after we've forgotten
the order of succession of the Kings of England.
They are the things that make us so sure that . . . Stanford is The
Place.

STANFORD IS THE PLACE .... where all the students complain that
the roads are poor, and then complain twice as much while they're being
fixed, because the torn-up places hamper the one-armed driving on the
way home from Rossot's .... where everyone is crossing his fingers and
hopefully looking forward to next football season .... where the school
color is cardinal, which explains why the chairs in the Excom room are
done in blue ... . where the University's orphaned crew gets a financial
helping hand from a sophomore class which hasn't forgotten that one
of the prerequisites of the sport of crew is the idea of everyone pulling
together .... where Ram's Head is such a cliquish "closed corporation"'
that a spring show script was chosen ♦hat provides parts for a mere £4
