# 'Transportationâ€™ Is Float Theme
## 
### 
All campus living groups 3re re
quested to decide on themes of
their floats for the Water Carnival
May (5 at Lake Lagunita.
''History of Water Transporta
tion" will be the theme of the car
nival, and floats may represent any
phase of transportation from Cleo
patra's barge to rubber rafts.
Living groups should sign up
their themes on the list at the ASSU
office, Float Chairman Dave Ber
trand said. Residences may work
together to enter a single float.
Three prizes will be awarded for
the float parade: most beautiful,
most original, and best execution of
the theme.
Construction information will be
distributed to living groups this
week. Space for the builo'ing of
floats is available beside the boat
house on the left shore facing the
lake.
After the float parade, a diving
and aquacade show will be held to
give living groups time to disas
semble their floais if they have used
canoes which are needed for con
tests.
