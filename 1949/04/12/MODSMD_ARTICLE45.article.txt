# Gridders Start Second Week of Spring Drills
## 
### 
The second week of spring foot
ball practice got under way yester
day with the adding of some faces
and subtracting of others to the four
major teams that Head Coach
Marchie Schwartz and staff have
formed.
In keeping with the policy of hav
ing the men play together as units,
but rotating key personnel so that
the actual character of the teams
change, the shifting of men involved,
for the most part, the quarterbacks.
Quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian,
Dick Horn, Tom Shaw, and Aubrey
Devine found themselves running
different squads than those they
hjandled last week.
Ken LaCrosse and live Gustav-
both left halfbacks, were ad
vanced to the first four squads off

their showings in Saturday's scrim
mage. Schwartz spent most of the
afternoon with the second group, the
newer men, in an effort to skim off
the cream of the crop for service
with the first four teams.
For the most part, yesterday's
drills were confined to tackling
practice, passive aerial scrimmages,
and plays designed to improve the
early season timing of the teams.
The fullback position, what with
the loss of Emery Mitchell and
Marty Anderson from last year's
team, is receiving top attention from
the coaching staff.
As of yesterday, Schwartz had
five men—Bill'De-Young, Jim Hayes,
Russ Pomeroy, Eric South wood, and
Bob A hick—operating from this po
sition in an attempt to narrow the
field of candidates to at least two
top performers for next year's squad.
