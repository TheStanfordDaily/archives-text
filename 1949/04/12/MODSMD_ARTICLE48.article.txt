# Woltermen Invade Santa Clara Tonight
## Batmen Gun for Second Win Over CIBA Leaders 
### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford s now catcherless baseball team, hard hit by recent
injuries and the sudden ineligibility of first-string receiver Frank
MacGraw, go after their second win over the pace-setting Santa
Clara Broncos tonight on the league leaders' home field.
The contest will be played under the lights at Washington Park

in Santa Clara. Game time is 8:15, ,
but those intending to follow the >
Cards to Broncoville should plan to
arrive as early as possible as the j
seating capacity is limited.
The Indian baseballers have i
vowed to win this one. The intense j
rivalry that is always stirred up I
when Stanford plays the Broncos, 1
combined with a suspicion that
Santa Clara may have had some- I
thing to do with the investigation {

of MacGraw's professional career, |
has made the Cards fighting mad.
In addition, a win tonight would
put Stanford into a tie for the league j
lead. The Indians are determined j
not to muff their chances.
Lefty Dave Dahle will go to the i
hill for the Cards. Dahle is fast and t
has always been tough under the 1
lights.
Bronco Coach Patty Cottrell has j
not yet announced his starter. Left- I
hander Hal Toso is the Santa Clara |
ace, but he pitched a full game
against Cal Saturday and may not |
be ready yet. If Toso doesn't go,
then either Dave Smith or Galen
Norquist will probably get the call. :
Frank MacGraw's ineligibility left 1
the Card lineup devoid of an ex- j
perienced receiver. Jim Castagnoli, j
the Indians' other starting catcher,
cracked a rib in last Friday's vic
tory over Loyola; and it is still not :
definite that he will be able to go
against the Broncs tonight.
If Castagnoli's rib won't stand up, j
Bill Herron, a rangy sophomore
who played the outfield on the j
freshman squad last season, will get
the starting nod. '
Elsewhere in the field the Cards

may be at full strength for the first
time in a week. First sacker Dick
Clegg, who had been benched with
a sprained ankle, was going at lull
speed again yesterday and will
probably open at first.
Ray Winterhalter, out of the
starting lineup for the same reason,
is back on second; and Bud Klein,
the big left fielder with the tricky
charley horse, will probably start
again in the outfield.
Pepperpot Bill Arce at third, and
Dave Melton at short, round out the
Card infield. Melton hit one of the
longest home runs ever seen at the
Sunken Diamond the last time the
Cards and Broncos got together,
and he will be out to repeat over
the shorter Washington Park walls
tonight.
