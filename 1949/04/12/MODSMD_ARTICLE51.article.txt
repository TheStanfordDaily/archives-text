# Cards' Weekend Performance Portends New Era for Farm Cinder Specialists
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
A new era of Stanford track has arrived!
With "come-through" performances the order of the day, the
Card tracksters were very impressive to everyone concerned as
they swamped the UCLA Bruins last Saturday.
The Stanford team looked like those of pre-war days, when

they crushed the Bruins by large
scores every year from 1924 to 1941.
Inexperienced sophomores ran like
seasoned veterans, with oh's and
all's about Stanford performances
coming often from the partisan
crowd.
The UCLA students, coaches, and
reporters alike were dumbfounded
when a Bruin favorite time and
gave way to a Stanford track
ster who wasn't supposed to have a
chance.
Lyons Starts Victory
The Bruin never fully recovered
from A 1 Lyons' courageous victory
in the mile when he nipped the
Bruin ace Royal Balch at the tape
in 4:20.6, four seconds faster than
he had ever run before.
Lyons was so tired that he could
not finish the two-mile, but he had
already contributed more than his
share toward the big victory.
Little Jose Rael. despite the ill
effects of a bad cough, went on to
score the 66th and winning point by
taking a third in the two-mile.
That 66th point meant a great deal
to the boys and the coach, for even
if the Bruins had swept the low
hurdles and the relay, the Cards
still would have chalked up their
first PCC victory since the war.
440 Men (Jreat
The Indians got off to a fast start
in the meet, for after Lyons won
the mile, Larry Hoff and Pitch
Johnson scored an easy one - two
victory in the quarter, a full six
yards in front of the UCLA horde.
Johnson ran a great race, being
nipped by just six inches at the tape
by speedster Larry* Hoff.
In fact, after the first four event
had been run off, Stanford led the
Bruins 27'2 to The tremendous
Indian shot putters had swept the
event, each man putting over 50
i'eet. Lew Davis took second place
with a respectable 51 ft. 11 in., and
Norm Nourse hit for 50 ft. 3 3 4 in.
But the man who stole the show
was bii,, blond Otis Chandler. The
shot put stalled before the mile was
run, and every eye in the stadium
was focused on the Stanford ace.
looking for a new record.
;"!Â» Feet Just Standing
First Chandler stepped up to the
line and threw a full three feet past
the 50-foot chalk line without mov
ing his legs, and the crowd let out
a big oh!
lie had broken the meet record
which he himself had made last
year (53 ft. 2 in.) without even us
ing the customary jump. George
UCLA shot putter, shook his
head in discouragement when he
saw Chandler perform this tremen
dous feat.
Then big Otis, to the delight of
the fans, proceeded to make throws
of 55-5. 55-1, 56 1 .!. 54-9, and 56 3 4.

j His last record-breaking heave was
| off the side of his hand, had no
I height, and was thrown oft' balance.
We can't help but wonder how far
j Chandler will throw against San
I Jose State next Saturday in his
, home pit.
Javelin Hits PV Runway
Another interesting sidelight was
| meet captain Bud Held's record
i breaking throw of 224 ft. 9*-a in. in
j the javelin. The Bruin oval is so
| constructed that the javelin throw
jis parallel to the straightaways,
j while the pole vault runs across the
j track.
Evidently in building the pole

vault runway they hadn't counted
on anyone throwing the jave'.in as
far as Held did.
At any rate his great throw landed
only a couple of feet from the run
way, with loose sawdust from the
pit surrounding the stick. It's bad
enough to give any pole vaulter a
nightmare!
Incidentally. Mike Durket came
through with a best-ever perform

ance in the event with a seave of
184 ft. 6 in. for third place.
Bryan in Ovation
Too much praise could not be
given to Gay Bryan who turned in
a spectacular performance in the
meet. After winning the 220 in 21
flat for his eighteenth point of the
afternoon, Bryan gracefully re
ceived a well - deserved round of
applause from everyone in the au
dience. His tremendous jump of 25
ft. 4 :! 4 in. speaks for itself.
Ex-gridder Don Campbell did a
beautiful 13-foot jackknife to nab
the pole vault for the Indians.
Campbell has great possibilities in
the event, and will receive a stiff
test next week when he meets
George Mattos of San Jose State
who has done 13 ft. lO in. already
this year.
The Stanford sophomores also
playecl a gx - eat part in the well
earned victory. Drew Terramorse
and George Mooers, who placed
second and third respectively in the
880. both were clockcd under 1:57.
Staying even with Craig Dixon
for the first three hurdles, soph Bob
Bryan coasted to second place in
the low hurdles, and then filled in
capably in the broad jump to take
third place after Fred Fank and
Merritt Van Sant turned up with
pulled muscles.
Much oredit can also be siven to

| hurdlers Downing McKee and Dell
! Russell, who lassoed the second and
third places in the high hurdles for
the Indians. McKee stumbled on
j the second hurdle and nearly lost
! his balance, but shook it off, made
i up the lost distance, and grabbed
! the second spot.
Although the Stanford trio was
second best to UCLA's Taylor Lew
is, the Indian discus situation looks
; very bright for Stanford in the USC
meet. Bill Bayless, USC's top man,
j threw a slim 139 feet last Saturday,
while Otis Chandler and Steve Mc
j Kee heaved the platter over 145
and 143 feet.
All in all, it was a very success
ful weekend for the Cards. With
warm-up meets in order for the
next two weeks against San Jose
State, and then Compton and the
Olympic Club, the Cards look for
ward with eagerness toward the
meet of the year, Southern Cali
fornia versus Stanford, in Stanford
Stadium on April 30.
