# Photos, Paintings Get Contrasting Criticism
## 
### JAN HANSON 
The current art exhibition on display in the Gallery is divided
into two sections. The first group represents the work of a Palo
Alto photographer, Harold Elliott, '16. The second grouping is
a series of paintings on the subject of the oil industry. The photo
graphs are interesting, frequently unusual. The paintings, on the
whole, are rather mediocre. +

The purpose of the photography
display is to illustrate the contrast
between the salon print and the
straight enlarged proof. Elliott
treats his photography as a fine art.
retouching, eliminating unwanted
highlights, filling in "bald" skies
with oil paints.
In '"Autumn Burning,'' Elliott
captures the smoky haze of an au
tumn afternoon. This is one of the
best of the collection. "The Storm
Breaks" is a beautiful example of
his treatment of patterns of light
and cloud formation.
Interesting Treatment
'Scottish Mist" and "Dusk, Ori
ental Harbor" are interesting in that
Elliott has treated them in such a
way that they are practically indis
tinguishable from charcoal sketches.
However, when a photographer's
work has completely lost the photo
graphic quality it raises the old
question of whether or not the ar
tist shoulcf remain true to his me
dium.
But. brushing aside the question
of artistic ethics, the exhibit is in
teresting, skillfully handled, and
contains some very beautiful pieces.
The" paintings were selected by
Standard Oil because they depict
various aspects of the oi! industry,
and the choice was therefore largely
restricted to graphic realism.
Famous Artists
There are several big names in
the show, among them Frederick
Taubes. Thomas Benton, and Peter
Hurd. However, the pieces shown
are definitely not representative of
their best work.
The best in the collection are wa
tercolors by Burns and Georges
Schreiber. an oil by Joe Jones, and
a crayon sketch by Taubes.
Burns has two watercolors in the
show, both of which are notable for
the freshness of color and the <!]uick,
easy brush technique which he em
ploys. In "Bayou Scene," which is
the better of the two, he has cap
tured the brooding mood of the ba
you, while still maintaining a re
markable delicacy of coloring.
Watercolor Composition
Schreiber has done some inter
esting things with composition in
both of his watercolors. "Seepage
Lake" is excellent. It is spontane
ous, the coloring is clean and fresh,
and it conveys a good feeling of
wintry dampness.
"Number 1" by Joe Jones has
good composition and a very good
feeling of space and motion. He
employs a quick, sketchy technique
which lends a nice spontaneity.

crayon sketch by Frederick Taubes.

best of the collection. "The Storm
Breaks" is a beautiful example of
his treatment of patterns of light
and cloud formation.
Interesting Treatment
'Scottish Mist" and "Dusk, Ori
ental Harbor" are interesting in that
Elliott has treated them in such a
way that they are practically indis
tinguishable from charcoal sketches.
However, when a photographer's
work has completely lost the photo
graphic quality it raises the old
question of whether or not the ar
tist shoulcf remain true to his me

But. brushing aside the question
of artistic ethics, the exhibit is in
teresting, skillfully handled, and
contains some very beautiful pieces.
The" paintings were selected by
Standard Oil because they depict
various aspects of the oi! industry,
and the choice was therefore largely
restricted to graphic realism.
Famous Artists
There are several big names in
the show, among them Frederick
Taubes. Thomas Benton, and Peter
Hurd. However, the pieces shown
are definitely not representative of
their best work.
The best in the collection are wa
tercolors by Burns and Georges
Schreiber. an oil by Joe Jones, and
a crayon sketch by Taubes.
Burns has two watercolors in the
show, both of which are notable for
the freshness of color and the <!]uick,
easy brush technique which he em
ploys. In "Bayou Scene," which is
the better of the two, he has cap
tured the brooding mood of the ba
you, while still maintaining a re
markable delicacy of coloring.
Watercolor Composition
Schreiber has done some inter
esting things with composition in
both of his watercolors. "Seepage
Lake" is excellent. It is spontane
ous, the coloring is clean and fresh,
and it conveys a good feeling of
wintry dampness.
"Number 1" by Joe Jones has
good composition and a very good
feeling of space and motion. He
employs a quick, sketchy technique
which lends a nice spontaneity.
"Suspended," the quick conte •
crayon sketch by Frederick Taubes.

He conveys in a simple sketch a
very good feeling of space and

The current art exhibition on display in the Gallery is divided
into two sections. The first group represents the work of a Palo
Alto photographer, Harold Elliott, '16. The second grouping is
a series of paintings on the subject of the oil industry. The photo
graphs are interesting, frequently unusual. The paintings, on the
whole, are rather mediocre. +

display is to illustrate the contrast
between the salon print and the

treats his photography as a fine art.

highlights, filling in "bald" skies

captures the smoky haze of an au
