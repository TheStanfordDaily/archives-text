# Biz School Library Gets New Lighting
## 
### 
Eyestrain will no longer be a
worry of students in the Graduate
School of Business, for during spring
vacation the library in this depart
ment was supplied with a new fluor
escent lighting system.
According to Dean Hugh Jack
son of the Business School, students
formerly had to study in sub-par
lighting but now can enjoy from
30 to .50 candlepower.
Funds for this new project, which
also includes painting the library
ceilings, came from annual appeal
funds. These gifts has been accu
mulated for over two years.
