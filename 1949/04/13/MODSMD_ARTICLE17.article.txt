# First Ratio Complaints Result in "Famous 500"

### BARBARA METZGER 
There are too many women here.
Back in 1898 came the first grum
bles about the Stanford ratio. The
growls sound different now, but 51
years ago there seemed reason
enough to think Stanford had too
many women.
At first women were accepted as
a matter of course. It was Senator
Stanford's desire that the education
of both sexes be equally full and
complete.
Mrs. Stanford felt that since the
University was a memorial to her
son, it was not being consistent to
have women in the student body.
Once the matter was settled, how
ever, her welcome to the coeds was
sincere.
.Mrs. Stanford Opposed
Once, though, Mrs. Stanford was
ready to eliminate women entirely.
She had received exaggerated tales
and rumors about the women's ex
tracurricular activities, and then a
report from the business manager
who ordered the campus patrolled
by mounted watchmen. It was then
that Mrs. Stanford was ready to
keep women off campus, but she
decided to turn the matter over to
the administration's discretion.
After Senator Stanford's death
his wife took over as sole trustee.
There was increasing agitation for
a decrease in enrollment of women,
but for a long time Mrs. Stanford
tried to maintain her husband's pol
icy of accepting women on an equal
basis with men.
Alumni die - hards claimed that
the Cal victories in 189# were due
to our players "queening" instead
of concentrating on athletic prac
tice. The cry went out for ''more
men for better athletics." More men
meant fewer women.
A few disgruntled students
claimed that women were voting
themselves into all the offices. Wom
en headed the junior annual, the
weekly paper, and the debate
squad. It seemed to them that the
tendency was to reduce the Uni
versity to the level of a women's
seminary.
"Famous 500" Limit
Wild appeals sent to Mrs. Stan

ford actually had little influence on
her decision. President Jordan said
that the two groups raising such .x
cy against coeds were (1) Catholic
who wanted to establish an annex
at Menlo under Stanford auspices,
and (2) businessmen educated at
Harvard or Yale. It was hard
convince the elderly graduates that
their system was not the best pos
sible. Neither request was held in
favor on the Farm.
However, Mrs. Stanford watched
the increasing enrollment of women
students with great anxiety. Soon
she felt that enrollment was far be
yond even her husband's utmost
expectations. When women num
bered 40 per cent of the student
body, Mrs. Stanford, without con
sulting anyone, amended the consti
tution to provide for a limit ot 500
Her move was criticized at the
time. President Jordan remarked..
"Mrs. Stanford failed to consult me
because, as she so naively told the
newspaper reporters, I would have
been opposed to the idea." President
Jordan added, though, that her pol
icy was sound.
Vassar of West Coast
Upperclassmen were being sent ti>
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, or Cor
nell to complete courses in special
lines of study which the University
was unable to provide for them at
that time. Women, on the other
hand, required far less outlay on
equipment. It soon looked as though
the men might actually be outnum
bered, and Stanford would become
the Vassar of the West Coast.
The famous 500 limit went into
eflect in 1903. By 1933 enrollment
in Western colleges had increased
so much that the famous 500 limit
gave way to the percentage basis
corresponding to the figures of 1889.
The ratio still remains at three to
one.
