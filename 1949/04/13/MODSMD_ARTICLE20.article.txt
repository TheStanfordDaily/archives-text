Atha Hillback of Palo Alto read
"The Winslow Boy" at the Tuesday
Series last night. This play by Ter
rance Rattigan won the New York
Crtiics' Award for the best foreign
play of 1948.
The story is built around a boy
in an English governmental school
who is unjustly expelled from
school on a charge of petty theft.
The boy's family rallies to his de
fense and challenges the right of a
government-run institution to dam
age the boy's reputation on such
â€¢flimsy evidence,
The case is taken to court and
arouses the sympathy of the entire
country before it is finally resolved.
The family makes tremendous fi
nancial and personal sacrifices in
order to see justice done. They are
assisted by one of England's most
brilliant jurists, who espouses the
cause because it represents the
struggle of the forces of bureauc
racy against the basic rights of the
individual. He refuses an impor
tant office to continue the case. Af
ter more than two years of seem
ingly hopeless litigation, the case is
won and the Admiralty revokes the
accusation.
Rattigan has built an absorbing
play around the right of official
agencies to impose their authority
on individuals of a democracy.
Mrs. Ilillback's reading of the
piece was very well done, maintain
ing the interest of the audience
throughout. Mrs. Hillback is a
mmber of the Palo Alto Community
players and has appeared as a guest
artist with the Stanford Players.
