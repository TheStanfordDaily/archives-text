## New Representation 
### 
When Excom's Constitutional Committee wrote the proposed
aew ASSU Constitution, they had four possible representation
systems from which to choose.
1. Representation based strictly on class year. Several years
ago Farm students discarded such a system because living ,
groups were not represented adequately on Excom. Often sev- 1
eral Excom members came from the same dormitory or living !
area.
2. Representation based on district population in types of liv-1
ing groups. Under such a system half of Excom would be com
posed of off-campus students. Most of student activity, however, :
is carried on by men and women living in campus living groups
and the Village.
3. Representation by large and or important student body or
ganizations, such as Men's and V/omen's Councils, Associated
Women Students, Cardinals, The Daily (or publications), lIR, '
NSA, and Rally Com. Again the faults of class representation
creep into the picture.
4. Represantation based on a combination of the'first two
methods. Excom membership, according to the proposed Con
stitution, would be based on class and living groups.
Living groups were classified for representation on the basis of
similar environment —not population. The following three wom
en's areas are:
Women's Row—each house is a separate living group, and a
Row Council unifies the area into an inner organization.
Union Unit—maintains an inner organization similar to the
Women's Row area, but all Union women eat in the same dining
hall; Union Unit administration and finances are handled by a
single director, while each Row house has its own director.
Women's dormitories (Roble, Branner, Lagunita, and Casa
Ventura) —all dorms have similar councils; women in each build
ing eat in the same dining hall; population in this bracket will
decrease when Branner is turned back to the men.
Three living areas composed of men (except the 120 women at
the Village) break down as follows:
Men's Row—each house is a separate living group; all houses
belong to an inner organization through the centralized Inter- i
fraternity Council.
Village—inner organization provided by Village Council, but
distance from the campus sets up the area as an entire unit.
Men's dormitories (Toyon, Encina, Crothers, and Stern) —halls
have similar councils; all men eat at Encina Commons."
The seventh living area under the proposed Constitution is
off campus. Nearly every student lives and eats apart from
other men and women. Although half of the registered students
in the University live off campus, the group is assured of one
Excom seat. But additional seats may be won by off campus
students if they run for class representation.
The above description of living group representation shows
why the particular divisions were made. Tomorrow, we will
explain the purpose of class representation and how this class
division, when combined with living group districts, can make
next year's Excom a stronger, well-rounded legislative body.

ing groups. Under such a system half of Excom would be com
posed of off-campus students. Most of student activity, however, :
is carried on by men and women living in campus living groups
and the Village.
3. Representation by large and or important student body or
ganizations, such as Men's and V/omen's Councils, Associated
Women Students, Cardinals, The Daily (or publications), lIR, '
NSA, and Rally Com. Again the faults of class representation
creep into the picture.
4. Represantation based on a combination of the'first two
methods. Excom membership, according to the proposed Con
stitution, would be based on class and living groups.
Living groups were classified for representation on the basis of
similar environment —not population. The following three wom
en's areas are:
Women's Row—each house is a separate living group, and a
Row Council unifies the area into an inner organization.
Union Unit—maintains an inner organization similar to the
Women's Row area, but all Union women eat in the same dining
hall; Union Unit administration and finances are handled by a
single director, while each Row house has its own director.
Women's dormitories (Roble, Branner, Lagunita, and Casa
Ventura) —all dorms have similar councils; women in each build
ing eat in the same dining hall; population in this bracket will
decrease when Branner is turned back to the men.
Three living areas composed of men (except the 120 women at
the Village) break down as follows:
Men's Row—each house is a separate living group; all houses
belong to an inner organization through the centralized Inter- i
fraternity Council.
Village—inner organization provided by Village Council, but
distance from the campus sets up the area as an entire unit.
Men's dormitories (Toyon, Encina, Crothers, and Stern) —halls
have similar councils; all men eat at Encina Commons."
The seventh living area under the proposed Constitution is
off campus. Nearly every student lives and eats apart from
other men and women. Although half of the registered students
in the University live off campus, the group is assured of one
Excom seat. But additional seats may be won by off campus
students if they run for class representation.
The above description of living group representation shows
why the particular divisions were made. Tomorrow, we will
explain the purpose of class representation and how this class
division, when combined with living group districts, can make
next year's Excom a stronger, well-rounded legislative body.
When Excom's Constitutional Committee wrote the proposed
aew ASSU Constitution, they had four possible representation
systems from which to choose.
1. Representation based strictly on class year. Several years
ago Farm students discarded such a system because living ,
groups were not represented adequately on Excom. Often sev- 1
eral Excom members came from the same dormitory or living !
area.
2. Representation based on district population in types of liv-1
ing groups. Under such a system half of Excom would be com
posed of off-campus students. Most of student activity, however, :
is carried on by men and women living in campus living groups
and the Village.

ganizations, such as Men's and V/omen's Councils, Associated
Women Students, Cardinals, The Daily (or publications), lIR, '
