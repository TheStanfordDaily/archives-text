Movie Guide Discrepancies
Tc the Editor:
I write this in the hope that I may save some poor soul a needless
tiip out of town to see a movie that is not there.
Please compare your movie guide of April 11 with that of the Chronicle.
Out of 10 movies listed, there are six discrepancies. This is not the first
time that these discrepancies have occurred. Judging from your past
record of inaccuracy concerning the movie guide. I'm inclined to side
with the Chronicle.
Your guide for the 12th is a slight improvement. There are only three
mistakes. If you would take the trouble to investigate, you would find
that "Knock on Any Door" and "Northwest Stampede" are not playing at
the Varsity. "Northwest Stampede" and not "Gun Smugglers" is at the
Sequoia.
With a little improvement, each day you may have a complete and
correct guide by the end of the week. Unfortunately, the pictures change
at the end of the week and I suppose that as usual The Daily will start
o(T on the wrong foot again this coming Monday morning.
How about cutting out the guesswork in the future and getting the
real dope from the theaters? I'm sure that they will be only too glad
to tell you if you ask them in a nice way.
MIKE MacDONALD
(Editor's Note: All movie programs arc obtained directly from the
managers of the theaters, usually by telephone, the afternoon just be
fore the paper goes to press. Also, chain theaters sometimes change their
programs at night after the last show.)
