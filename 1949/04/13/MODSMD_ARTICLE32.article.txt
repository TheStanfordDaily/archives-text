# T.V. Scarce On Campus
## 
### 
Television is having a hard time
getting established at Stanford.
Out of 24 fraternities, only five
have television sets, and of this
number only two purchased sets
with house funds.
Of the other three fraternities
that have sets, one set was won in
the Philip Morris contest, and two
are privately owned television re
ceivers.
Encina and Toyon both have large
TV sets, but due to the size of these
houses, this is but a small drain on
their finances.
Why do so few houses have tele
vision? A Daily survey during
spring vacation showed that every
house on campus had discussed the
matter with its members, but for
a variety of reasons had decided
against purchasing sets.
Low finances was the main reason
for not having a television set. A
16-inch receiver, similar to the one
in Toyon. costs $(506. while a 10-inch
screen, although it only costs $300.
is too small for all the members of
the house to enjoy it.
"We are waiting for new devel
opments,' was another common re
ply from house managers. Adver
tisements have been talking of color
television, bigger screens, and new
channel openings, and the frater
nities arc afraid that their sets will
be obsolete as soon as they buy
them.
Toyon was laced with this same
problem, but the general consensus
was that if they were to wait for
new developments, they would al
ways be waiting.
A local salesman reported yes
terday that it will he a long time
before color television is practical,
and there is no danger of new chan
nel openings for a good many years.
But in general, the fraternities
are uninterested, and the salesmen's
remarks fall on deaf ears. Most of
them want television to grow up
and prove itself before they put a
lot of money into an expensive set.
Until that day. there will he great
competition at five fraternity houses
and two dormitories to "see" the
daily baseball gtmie.
