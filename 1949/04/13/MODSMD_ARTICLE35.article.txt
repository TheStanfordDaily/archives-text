LONDON. April 12 (/Pi â€” The
1,274-year-old All Hallows by the
Tower, blitzed and burned dean of
London's parish churches, will be
come the city's first monument to
American and British war dead
through the gift of an American
businessman.
Charles Sumner Bird of Walpole.
near Boston, Mass., looked over the
debris of bomb blast and incendiary
in the shadow of the Tower of
London and offered 50 tons of Amer
ican steel to finish the job of re
building the ancient shrine which
dates back to (575 A.D.
To the Rev. P. B. Clayton, the
vicar, his friend for nearly 30 years,
he explained his motive was to pro
vide a memorial "to recall from
generation to generation the com
radeship in arms of thousands of
Englishmen and Americans who
died to save freedom."
American authorities and the
British Board of Trade swept aside
tariffs and other technicalities, and
All Hallows is to be completely
resurrected.
Two years ago New Englanders.
organized by Sumner Bird, con
tributed the raw materials to re-roof
the famous church's North Aisle.
Texas business firms heard of
cause and contributed to restore the
South Aisle. A year later Queen

Elizabeth laid the foundation stone
under a canopy ol Boston and Tox;is
steel. Bird's individual effort pro
vides for the rebuilding of the great
nave and thus completes the whole
structure.
The gesture adds another gem to
the treasure of Anglo-American as
sociations that enrich the history of
tho church. Seventeenth century
colonists prayed there before em
barking for the New World.
