# 'Return of Grimm' Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
Costumes of li) 12. that period just
before skirts left the floor, will be
used for "The Return of Peter
Grimm," written by David Belasco,
which opens a three-night run in
Memorial Auditorium tomorrow.
In Belasco's own style, the cos
tumes follow the extensive realism
of the stage setting. Spring house
dresses are conservative in color
and design. Men wear sack coats
and peg-top trousers which give a
leg-o'-mutton effect.
A touch of Old Holland will char
acterize the costume of the family
Dutch maid. The final touch of
home life will be seen in the little
boy's apparel—Dr. Denton's paja
mas.
An abundance of rain in the play
calls forth a parade of umbrellas
and galoshes. O. G. Brockett is in
charge of costumes.
Tickets are available for all three
performances, but only a few are
left for Friday. Tickets may be
bought for 90 cents at the Memorial
Auditorium box office.
