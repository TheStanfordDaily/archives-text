# Undefeated Frosh Diamondmen Try For Sixth Win Against Sequoia High
## 
### 
With five straight wins and trying
for six, the undefeated freshman
baseball team will take the home
field tomorrow afternoon at 3:15,
eager to stretch their streak against
near-by Sequoia High School.
Some new faces will start the
game and some old ones will be
seen in new positions. Handyman
Joe Chez who has seen action at
first and in the outfield will be on
the mound for the first time against
the Sequoiamen.
Joe originally came into camp as
a pitcher, but due partly to team
injuries and no little to his potent
stick, has shuttled across the dia
mond before landing at his home
position.
Don Simpson, who has finally
rounded into shape after a slow
start because of basketball, will
start his first game at second.
Don is a fancy gloveman who will
add much to the team's defensive
strength. His stickwork under pres
sure, of course, is unknown.
Jim Walsh, hero of last Saturday's
game against Oakland Tech, has
been shifted from second to first
base. Jim is learning his new posi
tion rapidly and adds a lot of his
well-known spirit besides a big bat
to the ballclub.
To round out the rest of the team,
Bruce Iverson will be on third, Lar
ry Peterson at shortstop, Dick Cor
zine behind the plate and the out

field will line up as Dan Sullivan in
left, Tony Stellar in center, and
either Jerry Odens or Hal Skillman
will roam in right.
Dan Sullivan has played first up
to the present but was switched to
the outfield to make way for in
fielder Walsh's blasting bat.
Owen Powell has donned the hel
met and shoulderpads of spring
football to make way for another
excellent ballplayer, Bruce Iverson,
at third base. Bruce is one of the
team's best, both at the plate and
in the field.
Nothing' much is known of Se
quoia except that they are rumored
to have strong pitching, all of which
they will need against the Indian
warelubs.
