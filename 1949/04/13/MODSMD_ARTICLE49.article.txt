# Thru Breier's Pipe
## Victor O. Schmidt Arrives on To Check Athletic Department Records 
### JOHN BREIER 
The joint was absolutely jumping with VIPs yesterday and not least
| among them was one Victor O. Schmidt, Commissioner of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Mr. Schmidt is the man, as most of you know, who guides the fortune?
of the PCC with the help of 10 faculty representatives. At least twicc
a year, Schmidt and his assistant, H. D. Thoreau (who ranks as one. ol
the best Bull Sessioners The Daily has ever had) travel to each of the K
; PCC schools to examine the records of the various athletic departments
interview freshmen, etc. Both gentlemen are here now on such a trip.
Now Schmidt is a former lawyer and as such is not one to give will
1 careless answers to prying questions put to him by college reporters. Tr\
as we might we could gain no information as to the progress of the annua
PCC "Proselyting Derby." He would give no hint as to who, if anybody
: will succeed the University of Washington as winner of the largest fine
I to be assessed against a member institution.
PCC Football Is on Its Way Hack
But Schmidt would, and did, comment on the standing of the PCC
in regard to the other conferences, presumably the Big Nine. He believe
that our conference is on the way back in football circles.
He points out that six PCC schools dropped from competition during
the last war and that Stanford stayed out a year longer than the rest. Hv
gf.es on to say that he believes that these schools have just about hi
their stride on the comeback trail.
I But facts and figures were not forthcoming from the gentleman anc
j one has only to guess as to what he and Thoreau have found in thei
i semi-annual search through the correspondence of the various school:
j they have visited.
They are really quite businesslike about the whole affair. Enter H. D
| Thoreau and the reading of the letter files commences. He reads som<
of the letters sent out by the SAC officials to see that no unpermitte<
I aid is given or received . . . that is . . . that no unlawful offers have beei
made to promising prep stars. Then he advances to the employment rec
ords to see just how much the school is paying the different athletes wh<
work the basketball games, officiate intramural games, etc.
Schmidt's Report Due in June
I guess that is the best system available but it seems that it would bi
rather easy for some schools, and I won't mention USC by name, to avoi(
any embarrassment by the simple expedient of removing certain letter
and records from the files. By the way, tomorrow the two gentlemei
move on to Berkeley. Take heed, you peasants, across the Bay.
In June Schmidt will make his report to the 10 men, good and true
I from the PCC schools. He will detail the offenses charged to each an
j then the fun begins. The faculty representatives vote on the amount o
| the fines to be levied. The public is supposed to look at these figures an.
I judge that school A is twice as bad as school B, because its fine was twit
as big.
But never, except in very rare instances, will Schmidt's office declar
an athlete ineligible for further competition due to some irregularity i
' enrolling in a school. The school is felt to be at fault and it draws the fine
Schmidt's office in Los Angeles acts as a clearing house for the man;
and varied letters written each day concerning - interpretations of tli
rules. He must then act and advise the schools as to what view his offic
holds on the matter. He thus amends and shapes the policies that th
1 faculty representatives make in their semi-annual meetings.
The commissioner's office maintains a hands-off policy in regard 1
entrance requirements. Those are left up to the different schools. II
only polices the athletes in regard to «rade standings, i.e., the studei
must be carrying at least 12 units and, in Stanford's case, pass 10 of ther
j each quarter.

\\ In 1 re \S as Hally Com Sunday Nighl?

As per usual, Rally Com missed a darn good bet Sunday night whe
the track team returned from LA after grabbing its first PCC track wi
sir.ee 1942.
It was a natural. Come-through performances had turned the trie
and provided the campus with a real chance to celebrate. It would hn\
be en a simple job to announce at the dining halls and rooms that a rail
would be held at the SP station to welcome the team back.
But the track learn, which had every right to expect a shouting thron
ui students, got off the train to meet but eij.,ht or 10 well wishers. We <
Stanford have become used to such happenings but it shouldn't be. Mayl
there will be some changes made. But I doubt it.

PCC Football Is on Its Way Hack
But Schmidt would, and did, comment on the standing of the PCC
in regard to the other conferences, presumably the Big Nine. He believe
that our conference is on the way back in football circles.
He points out that six PCC schools dropped from competition during
the last war and that Stanford stayed out a year longer than the rest. Hv
gf.es on to say that he believes that these schools have just about hi
their stride on the comeback trail.
I But facts and figures were not forthcoming from the gentleman anc

i semi-annual search through the correspondence of the various school:
j they have visited.
They are really quite businesslike about the whole affair. Enter H. D

move on to Berkeley. Take heed, you peasants, across the Bay.
In June Schmidt will make his report to the 10 men, good and true

that our conference is on the way back in football circles.
He points out that six PCC schools dropped from competition during
the last war and that Stanford stayed out a year longer than the rest. Hv
gf.es on to say that he believes that these schools have just about hi
their stride on the comeback trail.
I But facts and figures were not forthcoming from the gentleman anc
j one has only to guess as to what he and Thoreau have found in thei
i semi-annual search through the correspondence of the various school:
j they have visited.
They are really quite businesslike about the whole affair. Enter H. D
| Thoreau and the reading of the letter files commences. He reads som<
of the letters sent out by the SAC officials to see that no unpermitte<
I aid is given or received . . . that is . . . that no unlawful offers have beei
made to promising prep stars. Then he advances to the employment rec
ords to see just how much the school is paying the different athletes wh<
work the basketball games, officiate intramural games, etc.
Schmidt's Report Due in June
I guess that is the best system available but it seems that it would bi
rather easy for some schools, and I won't mention USC by name, to avoi(
any embarrassment by the simple expedient of removing certain letter
and records from the files. By the way, tomorrow the two gentlemei
move on to Berkeley. Take heed, you peasants, across the Bay.
In June Schmidt will make his report to the 10 men, good and true
I from the PCC schools. He will detail the offenses charged to each an
j then the fun begins. The faculty representatives vote on the amount o
| the fines to be levied. The public is supposed to look at these figures an.
I judge that school A is twice as bad as school B, because its fine was twit
as big.
But never, except in very rare instances, will Schmidt's office declar
an athlete ineligible for further competition due to some irregularity i
' enrolling in a school. The school is felt to be at fault and it draws the fine
Schmidt's office in Los Angeles acts as a clearing house for the man;
and varied letters written each day concerning - interpretations of tli
rules. He must then act and advise the schools as to what view his offic
holds on the matter. He thus amends and shapes the policies that th
1 faculty representatives make in their semi-annual meetings.
The commissioner's office maintains a hands-off policy in regard 1
entrance requirements. Those are left up to the different schools. II
only polices the athletes in regard to «rade standings, i.e., the studei
must be carrying at least 12 units and, in Stanford's case, pass 10 of ther
j each quarter.

\\ In 1 re \S as Hally Com Sunday Nighl?

As per usual, Rally Com missed a darn good bet Sunday night whe
the track team returned from LA after grabbing its first PCC track wi
sir.ee 1942.
It was a natural. Come-through performances had turned the trie
and provided the campus with a real chance to celebrate. It would hn\
be en a simple job to announce at the dining halls and rooms that a rail
would be held at the SP station to welcome the team back.
But the track learn, which had every right to expect a shouting thron
ui students, got off the train to meet but eij.,ht or 10 well wishers. We <
Stanford have become used to such happenings but it shouldn't be. Mayl
there will be some changes made. But I doubt it.
