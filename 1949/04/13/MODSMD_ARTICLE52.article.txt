# Ambitious Farm Rifle Team Enters Northern California Rifle Conference
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
The noise that issues from the
DTC stables area every afternoon
not a flock of woodpeckers, but
s Stanford Rifle Team practicing,
te Rifle Team is one of the most
ibitious minor sports groups on
mpus. They are members of the
uthern California Intercollegiate
He Conference, which includes
ilifornia, Cal Aggies, San Jose
ate, Santa Clara. Stanford, and
SF.
Last year Bill Muggins organized
small group of Stanford rifle en
u.-iasts into a team, and they en
ed the conference. The team op
ited purely on the determination
d interest of its members. Al
xigh the SAC sanctioned the
Dup, it offered no material as
tance. The members of the team
idled themselves, provided their
r n equipment and ammunition,
ey also formed a car pool for
ansportation to conference
itches.
ROTC Unit Aids Team
This year the Stanford ROTC unit
ne to the aid of the team, and
der the guidance of Major George
yerle, Lientenant Barney Barco.
i Sergeant Willy Green, the
irn facilities have rapidly ex

| panded. The team practices and
! holds all its home matches at the
ROTC rifle range. The range was
converted from an old stable by the
non-coms of the ROTC. The range
( is divided into two wings, each will
: handle five men.
Plans are under way to build a
I comfortable club room between the
two wiiv>s. The range now rates as
; one of the top indoor collegiate rifle
ranges on the Coast. Although the
SAC still hasn't come through with
, any assistance to the team, the Uni
versity grounds has offered a help
ing hand.
Miss Lynn !s Outstanding
One of the more outstanding
| members of the team is Frances
| Lynn. This good-looking young
lady can hold her own with anybody
' when it comes to chalking up points
! with a rifle.
The question of women competing
in the conference had never come
up before Frances showed up. but
! the conference ruled that if she
could shoot well enough there was
j no reason why she shouldn't com
pete. and she can shoot well
enough. Frances is also secretary
and recorder for the team. In addi
tion, she helps coach 17 girls, who

turn out from 3 to 5 on Wednesday I
and Friday afternoons.
Team Holds Seven Victories

tories over Santa Clara in confer
ence competition. In addition they j
