# Intramural Games Can't Be Postponed
## 
### 
Intramural Director Chuck Tay
lor announced yesterday that all in
tramural games must be played even
though one team is scheduled to play
volleyball and softbail games at the
same time.
The reason for this ruling is to
get different players to participate
in the two sports. If the opponents
agree to postpone the game, how
ever, it will be permissible to play
the game at another time.
