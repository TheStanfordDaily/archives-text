Three papers weer presented to
the Philosophy Club by Carol New
man. Dave Harrah, and Fred Sontag
on ''Is a study of metaphysics nec
essary to a study of philosophy?"
(A study of metaphysics means a
study of the science of being, of
space, time, cause, and God.)
Harrah was dogmatically skepti
cal and believed metaphysics only
cluttered the mind. A study of the
methods of critical thinking was, he
believed, more important and nec
essary.
The opposite point of view was
taken by Sontag. who believed it
was impossible to reach any un
derstanding of philosophy without
a study of metaphysics.
Miss Newman, whose ideas were
more moderate, was of the opinion
that even science must enter the
realm of metaphysics in order to
speculate.
