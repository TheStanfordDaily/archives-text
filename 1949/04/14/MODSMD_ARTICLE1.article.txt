## 
### 
SEATTLE, April 13 (AP) — Death, fear, and widespread dam
age rocked through the Pacific Northwest at 11:55 a.m. (PST)
today.
The worst earthquake in the region's history brought death
to seven persons and injury to many others. It cracked buildings.

It east bricks and injury into city
sheets on the heads of many of the
thousands who fled the swaying
structures.
It hurled, two houses into Puget
Sound from Fox Island, near Ta
coma, Wash. They were believed
unoccupied, but the Coast Guard
sent a boat to investigate.
It cracked the earth. It disrupted
rail traffic for two hours between
Portland, Ore., and Seattle. It was
felt over a 500-mile-long area of
the coastal Northwest, hitting hard
est the Puget Sound cities of Olym
pia. Tacoma, and Seattle. Eastern
Washington, Oregon, and British
Columbia and northern Idaho felt
it slightly.
A Seattle man died of a heart at
tack two hours after the shock.
The casualty list was concen
trated in the west central Washing
ton area. A workman was killed by
falling bricks, and a woman died ol"
a heart attack at Olympia, Wash. A
child was killed by bricks at a Ta
coma school, and a high school ath
'ete was injured fatally when a
Castle Rock school building top
pled. In Centralia a man was killed
when the entire front of a business
building collapsed.
Injuries were reported from many
western Washington cities. The total
may run to scores.
Damage to Capitol
The quake struck violently in
Olympia, Wash., damaging eight
major State Capitol buildings. Three
were ordered vacated immediately,
and an official said damage to state
structures alone would amount to
uncounted millions. All Olympia
city business buildings were ordered
closed.
The University of Washington
seismograph recorded the start of
the quake at 11:55 a.m. (PST). Both
needles were knocked from the
drum. The seismograph still was
vibrating 20 minutes later.
University seismologists rated the
quake as of No. 8 intensity. (No. 12
is the worst possible intensity and
would mean total destruction of an
area.) The worst previous quake
here, on Feb. 14. 1946. was rated
No. 7.
Center Near Seattle
Keith Oles, geology department
associate, estimated the center as a
short distance west or southwest of
Seattle.
In the western Washington zone
of heaviest damage, water tanks
split open, windows were shattered,
and bricks and concrete blocks
rained into the streets.
Thousands of persons rushed from
swaying buildings in Seattle, Ta
coma, Olympia. Longview. Centra
lia. and other Washington cities, and
in Portland. Ore.
Shrieking sirens of ambulances
and fire equipment added to the din.
Many persons fainted, including
several prisoners in the King County
(Seattle) jail.
Water Tanks Break
In Seattle two water tanks broke
atop business buildings, cascading
water down the sides into the
streets. Throughout western Wash
ington scores of brick and concrete
buildings were cracked and thou
sands of chimneys were damaged in
homes.
Near Bonneville Dam on the Co
lumbia River earth slides caused
alarm, but the big dam and power
lines apparently were not damaged.
In Olympia, where the Capitol
buildings swayed and cracked, 25
Boy Scouts on a sight-seeing tour
were trapped 287 feet above the
earth in the Capitol dome. State
patrolmen escorted them to safety
after the jo!ting stopped.
And in Seattle a police officer re
ported observing an unidentified
man hustling down a main street,
attired only in shorts, shoes, and a
sports coat.
