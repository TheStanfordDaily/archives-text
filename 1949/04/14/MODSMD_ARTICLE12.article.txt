## 
### 
Rally Com held its first meeting
of the quarter under a revised con
stitution last night. The new con
stitutional provisions embody the
principal ideas of a general reor
ganization plan still being devel
oped.
Replacing the two co-chairmen
system of administration, one chair
man and a board of directors will
henceforth guide and co-ordinate
Rally Corn's varied activities. Pat
De Young has been appointed as
chairman for the coming year. The
board of directors includes Sue Ray,
secretary-treasurer; Gordon Luce,
card stunts; Dean Borba, rallies;
and Dana Turkington, publicity.
The new organization achieves
the double purpose of giving re

members in their final year with
Rally Com, and of making possible
the transfer of the invaluable ex
perience gained by this year's co
chairmen, Lynn Cox and Hap Black,
to next year's leaders.
At last night's meeting, prelimi
nary plans for an unusually active
spring quarter were made, princi
pal attention being devoted to the

of the Spring Sing.
Extra splash will be added to
card stunts next fall by the pur
chase of special glazed cards which
reflect much more light than those
previously used, announced Gordon
Luce.
