# Cardinals Discuss Improving Lake
## 
### 
The possibility of putting rubber
fenders on the Boathouse dock at
Lake Lag to keep it from being
ripped by canoes was discussed at
Cardinals meeting Tuesday night.
Dick Reinhardt, Cardinals mem
j ber, will see whether this can be
done. He will also look into sanding
the deck so that people will not
| get splinters in their feet.
The Concessions stand at the
Boathouse, which was put in by
Cardinals, will be painted within
the next few weeks.
j The idea of putting a sand beach
I in at the Lake, which was brought
jup at last week's meeting, was
found to be impossible, Joe Zukin,
I president of Cardinals said.
A concrete dam is to be put in
j by the University and this would
interfere with the beach. Also, the
I cost of bringing in the sand would
be less if it was hauled when the
| lake is dry, he said. Thus, the plan
j was postponed until later in the
! year.
