### 
Andrei A. Gromyko charged to
day the North Atlantic Treaty na
tions are isolating Russia and plot
ting aggressive atomic warfare
against the Soviet Union.

The No. 1 Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister launched the blast on the
12 - nation At'.antic Pact in the
United Nations Assembly. But he
made no demands for UN action at
this time.
Warren R. Austin, chief United
States delegate, promptly issued a
statement to newsmen saying the
pact is not an aggressive instrument.
Austin said it is rooted in the pur
poses and principles of the UN
charter.
