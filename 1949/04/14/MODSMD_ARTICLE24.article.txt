# SIRO Plans Spring Drives
## 
### 
In keeping with the work done
during 1 the past two quarters, SIRO
has a busy and worthwhile sched
ule ahead for spring quarter. The
proposed plans include more clothes
packages and food bundles to be
sent overseas, and a stress on edu
cational rehabilitation.
There will be no further clothing
drives this quarter because of the
large one last quarter, but there is
-till much clothing to be segregated
and tied into bundles for overseas.
>hipment. Food bundles will be sent
when the occasion demands.
The emphasis for the quarter will
be placed on educational rehabili
tation. There are $3,100 dollars re
maining in the SIRO fund from fall
quarter, and most of this money
will be spent on foreign universities.
Five of the foreign scholarship stu
dents have been contacted and have
compiled lists of the books and sup
plies which they think are most
needed by the universities of their
countries.
One student suggested that SIRO
send the money allotted to his par
ticular university to the Bank of
Sweden, where the fund can be
drawn upon when necessary. This
would enable the university to pur
chase their books at a cheaper rate,
and also in their own language.
Several new universities are being
investigated as possible recipients of
SIRO funds. Among these are
schools in the Philippines, China,
and Norway. SIRO is trying to abol
ish the $100 limit per school, as
there are sufficient funds available
to fulfill all the requests of the uni
versities if they are reasonable and
obtainable.
There are plenty of positions
available for work in SIRO. Any
persons interested in working for
this organization would be welcome,
and should drop in at the lIR office,
open from 3 to 5 every afternoon.
