## Class Representation 
### 
Under the proposed ASSU Constitution, which will be voted
on later in the quarter, class representation has been determined
on a numerical ratio basis.
Each of the four undergraduate classes and the graduates are
assured of one Excom representative. Additional class repre
sentation would be granted each autumn quarter if either one ;
of the classes (including grads) had 100 per cent more members J
than the average of all the undergraduate classes. Figures would
be based on the preceding year's undergraduate enrollment.
As an example, let's say the average size of the undergraduate
class from the preceding year was 1,500. In the fall, any class
(including the grads) which exceeded that number by 100 per \
cent, that is, have a size of over 3,000, would have an additional
representative.
It is in this class bracket or representation that off-campus stu
dents can show the true power of their organization. The 4,000
off-campus students conceivably could elect at least three class ,
Excom representatives. But past activities have displayed dis
organization on the part of these men and women—especially
in the case of their low attendance at the rally last quarter.
The only Excom seat that would not be filled in spring quar
ter elections would be the freshman class position. The frosh i
representative would be elected in the autumn.
How do we benefit from this proposed Excom representation?
Top advantage of the new system is that every man and woman !
would have double representation — by class and by type« of j
living group. As stated yesterday, living group districts have '
been proposed by the Constitutional Committee on the basis of i
building location, dining hall location for the area, and the rela-1
tionship — or similarities — among the houses in each living |
bracket.
Four years ago Excom representation was based on class
membership. Two students were elected from each class. Post- i
war Excoms, however, have been composed of students drawn
from living area districts.
The proposed constitutional change strengthens the present 112
representation system by consolidating the living areas accord
ing to type of living group. In addition, class representation is
included in the new system. As a result, constituents of Excom
members could consult with both their class and their living dis- '
trict representatives.
If the proposed constitution is approved, classes could
strengthen their organization by including their ASSU Excom
members as automatic members of the class excoms.
