## Good Friday Observance 
### 
To the Editor:
The adequacy of Stanford's Good Friday observance was questioned last
week. Certainly the students who want to commemorate the Crucifixion by
going to a service either on campus or in Paly should not be penalized
if they have courses at the same time.
In Palo Alto most offices and shops will be closed and government agen
cies will shut down for three hours. If classes can be dismissed for all
campus assemblies and Founders' Day, why can't they be dismissed for
three hours on this day sacred to all Christians?
