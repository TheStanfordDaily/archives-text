You walk into the Cellar. What j
do you hear —a babble of sound, I
just a babble. Strain a bit, though, 1
and you can start to make out indi- i
vidual voices. You walk down the j
aisle and snatches of conversation j
come to you from here and there:
"So 1 told him I wasn't that kind i
of a girl .... Let's skip history and J
go over to the Libe and look around
. . . . But even if I had of said that '
about him .... Studying nothing,
he had a copy of Esquire behind his j
book .... She's put on too much
weight to wear that tight a skirt.
"Sure I know I'm going around j
with a girl with a past—l'm waiting
for history.to repeat itself .... So |
I came into the house and my son I
asks me, 'Daddy, what did you learn j
in school today?' .... Oh my
Gawd, looka that peek-a-boo blouse. !
"I asked my wife for some money I
this morning and she said she was ,
flat, busted. I told her that had
nothing to do with it, and to give i
me some dough .... Well, if you :
know them let's move in ... . and
so on and on and on. It's an art, ;
email talk.
English majors have a few words
of warning, however. They say it
simply: "Let your conversational
communications possess a clarified i
conciseness, a compact comprehen
sibility, coalescent consistency and j
a concatenated cogency. Or in other I
words, sedulously avoid all poly- I
syllabic profundity, pompous pro- j
lixity, psittaceous vacuity, ventri- |
loquial verbosity and vaniloquent
vapidity. Or if you must have it i
in the colloquial form — say it |
simply!

How is your Social IQ, kids? j
Know your correct etiquette? Well j
then, what would you do in the j
following case:
1. Should the man let the woman !
enter the patrol wagon first, or
should he boost her up from the
rear?
2. At a banquet which is the dish |
you shouldn't touch—the dish on
the left (salad), or the dish on the ,
right (blonde)?
3. What wine should be served !
with wieners?
4. How should a coed address the
dean of women when bumping into I
her on Third and Mission at 3:30
a.m.?
5. What would you do if three I
bottles of hootch foiled out of the ;
car just as you were making that I
last-minute rush for the door be- j
fore the deadline and broke on the I
pavement?
(a) Put your hands on your hips \
and scream belligerently. |
"Who threw those bottles?"
(b) Wring your hands in anguish
and exclaim, "Oh, you've
spilled my perfume."
(c) Use your handkerchief to mop j
up the rivulets and wring it j
later in the seclusion of your !
room so you won't have to j
share it.
(d) Yell, "Drinks on the house."
(e) Smile politely and say, "Just J
don't drop me, honey, I'm i
fuller than they were any- j
how."
