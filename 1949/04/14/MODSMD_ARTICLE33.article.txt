# War Wives to Combat Homesickness
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 13
or three years is a long time away
from home. It gives a girl a chance
to think.
A group of English war wives—
they can hardly be called "brides"
r,ny longer—have had a long time to
do some thinking and, in some
cases, brooding.
They meet every week and they
hnve one thing in common—they all
rre more or less homesick. Some
who havo managed to make a visit
home are reconciled to settling down
in America. The others are longing
to get back, at least for a visit.
Mother confessor and guiding gen
ius of this group of war wives is
JA rs. Cccil Guinness, an English

woman who is happy making sure
other expatriates are happy, too.
Once of Broadstairs, Kent, IVfrs.
Guinness has been in the United
States 25 years.
During the war, Mrs. Guinness
served with the British War Re
lief in Now York. Later she worked
with war brides for the English
speaking Union and the Interna
tional Institute. When these organ
izations felt this phase of their
work was accompMshed, Mrs. Guin
ness decided to do it on her own.
Mrs. Guinness gathered together
all the war wives she could get in
touch with and made them welcome
at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y.. a
half-hour train ride from Manhat

tan. At time she had as many as
45 in her group, so the meetings
were transferred to the Mt. Vernon
YVVCA.
There her current crop of war
wives arc taking American citizen
ship classes, followed by a get-to
gether over the inevitable tea. "This
gives them a fine chance to grumble
together and get it out of their sys
tems." Mrs. Guinness says.
The group, supplemented by an
Estonian, a German, and an Kalian
war bride, and one each from Aus
tralia, New Zealand, and Canada,
made it clear over one of their
weekly cups of tea that they were
"generally speaking" quite happy.
