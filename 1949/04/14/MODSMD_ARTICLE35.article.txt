If I'm not mistaken, that picture (?) of yours truly is back in the paper
this, morning. Wait a minute, I'll look down and see .... Yep.
Now there is a real face for you. Notice the Regal features: the Haps
burg chin, the Hohenzollern mouth, the Bourbon Nose. Talk about a face

that only a mother could love. Come to think of it.
I didn't even have a mother's love because my brother
and I couldn't afford a mother. We were very poor.
But there was a great bond between my father and
me. The day I was born I can remember hearing him
say to the nurse: "Whadda ya say we fatten him up
and sell him for veal, kiddo?" He was so sentimental.
But enough of this reminiscing.

As I am finishing up this column, the radio beside
my desk is making with some recorded music. This is

as much of an excuse as I need to tell a story about one of America's
all-time popular song hits.
When the late A 1 Smith was governor cf New York State, a young com
poser named Cole Porter opened a Broadway musical entitled "The Gay
Divorcee. Governor Smith attended the opening night performance of
Porter's new musical. During the course of the show he heard a love song
which so impressed him that, after the show he was moved to write a
letter to Porter. In this letter he told the composer that one of the num
bers in "The Gay Divorcee" was the finest song he had ever heard on
a Broadway show. He further predicted that the American people would
bo singing and humming that song long after they had forgotten that
there was ever such a person as A 1 Smith.
Smith has been dead for more than a few years now. And although
there are many people who vividly remember him. it's a safe bet that
there are many more people who recognize the strains of the song he so
liked in "The Gay Divorcee."
The name of the song? "Night and Day."
