# India Eying Advance of Communism
## 
### 
NEW DELHI, India, April 13 (TP).
— India is looking warily to the
north and east, watching the ad
vances of Communism that may en
gulf all the rest of the Asian main
land.
As yet, she shows neither alarm
nor nervousness. India insists she
isn't mad at anybody. Her govern
ment, in power for less than two
years and still an interim adminis
tration because the new constitution
is not yet effective, has become the
most stable and secure in Asia.
The Indian government has dem
onstrated its opposition to Commu

nism. It has dealt swiftly and
sternly with Communist attempts
to create disorders and disruptions
which would weaken its authority.
While it pushes several socialistic
projects, it also has gone to some
lengths to encourage capitalism,
both Indian and foreign. It has
shown reluctance to cut all India's
connections with the British Com
monwealth.
But countering all such signs of
solidarity with the Western democ
racies are repeated statements from
the government that India has no
interest in joining either side in any
struggle between the East and West.
