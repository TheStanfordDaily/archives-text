Thursday Morning Special: Through the grace of friendly gods and the
Economics Department, Ralph Sala—itar middle distance swimmer—will
be eligible for Saturday's swim fest with the blue and golders from the
University of California. Wilho r without the ever-smiling Sala, the
Haynicitcs will dunk Cal. the big importance of having Ralph around will
be- a week from Saturday when the Indians hit the water against "the
greatest swimming team in USC history." This April 22 deal promises ,o
be the best dual meet in the Stanford tanks in some years. Sala will swim
against none other than Olympic games gishmrui Waliy Woolf, who is
g-o-o-d. After next Saturday and after beating Fullerton JC next Friday
the Indians will have won 39 consecutive dual meets. If, and I mean if-if-if.
the once thunderous Indians come through as they are capable of doing,
Stanfordites will be marking up No. 40 Sunday morning.
Salt tears and warm good-byes department:
Coach Chuck Taylor, who has been winning football games for nigh onto
two years nok, is losing the help of his two very excellent assistant coaches
—Dick Madigan and Crunch Crane. Dick is graduating from Biz School
and must go out to seek his fortune in the food products business. Crane,
and the end of this quarter, will have graduated from the Law School, and
will likewise have to go to work. In lieu of these two most worthy gen
tlemen, Taylor has secured two of last year's varsity to aid him in his
frosh coaching duties. The are guard Bob Rohrer and end Bob Ghilotti.
Looks like the frosh will continue winning football games. And here's
wishing all the luck in the world to Dick and Crunch.
Good-bye and good luck to Jean—the pretty girl who has been manipu
lating the SAC switchboard for some season now. She leaves at the end of
the month for her home in "Lon-guy-land," New York. Thanks, Jean,
lor lots of favors to me and a couple of thousand athletes. We'll miss you.
There has been some little discussion about football players who cut
spring practice in favor of other spring sports. The question is some
what clarified by no less an authority than grid coach Marchie Schwartz.
Marchie, speaking of diamondmen Bud Klein and Jini Castignoli, said:
"I m delighted that they are out for baseball—they're doing a lot of good
for themselves and for Stanford out here." Marchie went on to point out
that it is a Stanford policy to encourage all athletes to go out for as many
sports as possible. I—speaking in the first person—like this policy. Foot
ball is a great sport, but I don t think it rhould ever call for the sacrificing
of every other sport on campus, even in the critical minds of the fans.
Besides I don't recall that playing baseball ever hindered the autumn
efforts of one Lloyd MerrimaA.
Incidentally, there has been some talk that Bud Klein's rather tricky leg
—which gave him so much trouble last fall—wouldn't carry him another
football season. Bud, who should have some knowledge of the situation,
claims that it is in good shape now and should be raring to go by fall.
Everett Dean, affable Indian cage coach, who is now coaching the frosh
baseballers, was talking about next year's five. "In the center post it's
between Ralph Carver and Jim Ramstead right now. But we really need
more height." Dean went on to say that he would be glad to interview
"anyone who has to stoop to get into the door." Transfers from the Uni
versity of Kentucky, please note.
Textbook time: Football Rule Changes:
Every year there are umpteen or so football rule changes that the average
fan never seems to hear about until the end of the season when the people
who change rules are already changing the changes that were changed
fiom last year. Feeling that this is a sad situation, I dove fearlessly into
little books, asked pleading questions of backfield coach Ray Ilammett.
and did a quick and conscientious bit of jobbing from Dick Hyland in the
L.A. Times. The result was the following poop.
1. Substitution: Henceforth there can be no substitution while the clock
is going. There have been no rule changes designed to curtail the platoon
system. This one substitution change is meant to discourage coaching from
the bench, and the inserting of specialty men all the time. This way the
constant shuffling off of, say a kicker like Mike Durkett, would be dis
couraged. When the ball changes hands, however, substitutions can be
made.
2. Clipping is now considered clipping if it occurs below the waist. This
rule should encourage downfield blocking and make for less borderline
clipping penalties.
3. Any offensive player in a position to take a direct handoff from the
center is now ineligible to receive a forward pass. This applies to the
quarterback in the T-formatioij. It also knocks from Stanford's list of
plays tile one used in last year's UCLA game, where the ball was cen
tered through Dcvine's legs to Mitchell who boomed the ball over the line
tj Devine who had eased un-noticed up the middle.
4. A stricter ruling on illegal use of hands. The type of blocking that
pictures showed Northwestern using on that disputed Rose Bowl touch
down will no longer be tolerated.
5. There are now only two ways a legal forward pass can become incom
plete—by touching the grounds or going out of bounds. Prior to this rule
change, if the ball touched an ineligible receiver, or two eligible receivers
in succession, the pass was considered incomplete. Now. if this occurs, the
ball continues in play. Likewise in the passing department, the rules now
read, "If a legal forward pass becomes incomplete or is illegally touched
behind the passer's goal line, the ball is now returned to the spot of the
previous down. It used to be an automatic safety when the pass fell
incomplete behind the passers' goal line. The rule change is designed to
encourage passing from behind the goal line.
P. S. What is the matter with Rally Com? No track, no baseball, no
no nothin' rally. Wha Hoppin'? Do they really die after football season?
