# Victorious Stanford Nine Meets San Diego Today
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
San Diego State, best known in the athletic world as the home
of Olympic broad jump champion Willie Steele, will send Willie
and eight other gentlemen capable of doing tricks with a base
ball onto the Sunken Diamond this afternoon to mix it up with
Stanford's championship-bound Indians. Game time for this non
conferen«« contest is 3:15.

The travel-weary Staters, sur
rounded by bus tickets and rubbing
liniment, are in the midst of a 10-
game Easter week road trip, and
have played an estimated 72 innings
of ball since leaving their Monte
zuma Mesa home six days ago.
For the information of those who
like comparative score merry-go
rounds, COP has waxed all four of
the Northern California CIBA en
trants, including Stanford. Two
more games with COP were sched
uled last night.
The Aztecs have brought an even
half-dozen pitchers north with them,
so just who Coach Charlie Smith
will throw at the Indians is any
body's guess. Whoever it is may be
in for a rough afternoon with Stan
ford's newly-found "murderers'
row.''
Coach Harry Wolter will undoubt
edly use either Jack Heinen or
Frank Laßrum—the only two Card
starters that did not see action in
the Indians' 10 to 8 CIBA victory

over Santa Clara Tuesday night.
This would leave Dave Dahle. Dave
Stott, and Jim Claypool available
for Stanford's next CIBA tilt with
the University of California on Sat
urday.
With the power section of the
Card batting order beginning to rap
the ball like it should, the Indians
are going to be plenty tough to beat
from here on out.
Coach Harry Wolter's "murder
ers' row," composed of Klein, Cole,
Melton, Clegg, and Nava, has enough
left and right-handed power to
throw fear into the heart of any
opposing pitcher.
These five poled out 10 of Stan
ford's 12 hits against Santa Clara—
many of them of the extra-base
variety. Nava hit three for four-
Cole three for five; and Melton two
for four against the Broncs.
With the exception of Klein's leg
and Castignoli's- rib. the team is
once again in good physical shape.
Alter two weeks of injury-forced
makeshift lineups, all regulars are
back at their positions — most of
them ready to go at full speed.
Bud Klein, the sluging leftfielder,
has been bothered all year with a
deep charley horse that acts up
every time he cuts to the right. He
has trouble getting around in the
outfield, but his batting power will
keep him in there as long as he can
run at all.
With MacGraw now ineligible,
Jim Castignoli is now virtually the
Cards' last line of defense behind
the plate. With proper taping, the
big footballer will probably catch
?very game despite a troublesome
broken rib that promised to keep
nim out of action for at least two
weeks.
