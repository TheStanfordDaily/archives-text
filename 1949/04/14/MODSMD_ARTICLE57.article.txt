# McKee Elected Meet Captain
## 
### 
Downing McKee, top Stanford
hurdler, was elected captain of the
undefeated Indian team yesterday
for the San Jose State meet which
will be held at Stanford Stadium
this Saturday.
McKee has been a consistent per
former for the Cards for the past
two years, after transferring from
Bakersfield JC at the end of his
sophomore year.
The big hurdler hit 14.3 in the
high hurdles, his specialty last year,
and hopes to come close to that
mark this Saturday against the
Spartans. His only defeat this year
is at the hands of Craig Dixon of
UCLA, who broke the Stanford-
UCLA meet record in beating Mc-
Kee.
On the bad side of the ledger, hur
dler and broad jumper Bob Bryan,
younger brother of Gay Bryan, is in
the hospital with symptoms of ap
pendicitis. If the latter is the case.
Bryan will be lost to the team Tor
at least a month.
Besides Bryan, the team seems to
be in fairly good shape. Skip Kent.
Card high hurdler, should be back
in action this weekend, after a two
week layoff with a pulled muscle.
Merritt Van Sant, a 23-foot broad
jumper, is on the questionable list.
Van Sant re-hurt his pulled mus
cle last Saturday when he tried to
jump against UCLA. He may be
forced to the sidelines xintil the
Olympic Club or the USC meet.
This past weekend saw eight Coast
best marks fall by the wayside. The
220, 440, 880. low hurdles, shot put,
broad jump, pole vault, and javelin.
The Coast tracksters seem to be
improving every week. Stanford at
present holds best marks in six out
of the 13 events.
