## BASEBALL Undefeated Frosh Crush Sequoia 
### BILL MORLEY 
Did we say something about Se
quoia's strong pitching staff? Well,
to prove that all rumors are false,
unfounded, and completely mis
leading, the frosh baseballers com
pletely annihilated the high school
moundsmen to the tune of 16-5 at
the freshman diamond yesterday.
With Big Jim Walsh doing the
heavy hitting, the local team came
through with two big innings, scor
ing 5 runs in the fourth and a big
9 in the seventh to ice the ball game
for the Papooses.
Sequoia Grabs Lead
The game was not originally such
a romp, however, as Sequoia grab
bed a four-run lead in the second
inning.
After this initial outburst, Joe
Chez, who started as pitcher for
Stanford, tightened up and only al
lowed one more tally, when it did
not make any big difference.
The game was originally sched
uled for seven innings and Se
quoia's early bulge looked pretty
big—that is, until the fourth frame.
The Cherokees' starting hurler,
Tom Del Sarto, had chained the
Papoose sluggers up till then and
looked as though he might keep the
key indefinitely.
Cards Explode
However. Del Sarto suddenly
cracked. He got two men out but
walked two in the meantime.
At this juncture, Jim Walsh, who
had doubled in the second inning,
homered over the left field fence to
bring in three runs.
Jim's monstrous clout seemed to
pick up the whole team, especially
Chez who knocked in two more
runs before the inning was over to
give his team the lead, 5-4.
The contest, as is the custom with
high schools, was supposed to go
only seven innings but due to some
misunderstanding ended up by go
ing the full route.
9-Run Seventh
The frosh, having picked up a
run in the sixth, were leading 6-4
when the game was supposed to
end. They expressed their displeas
ure at longer working hours by ex
ploding with a 9-run seventh frame.
Of course five walks helped the
freshmen more than a little.
Joe Chez finished by giving up 8
hits, four of them in that bad second
inning. He gave five bases on balls
and struck out ten batters.
Jim Walsh was the hitting star of
the marathon, having a perfect day
at bat with 3 for 3. He was tactfully
walked on his last trip.

Joe Chez finished by giving up 8
hits, four of them in that bad second
inning. He gave five bases on balls
and struck out ten batters.
Jim Walsh was the hitting star of
the marathon, having a perfect day
at bat with 3 for 3. He was tactfully
walked on his last trip.
Sequoia 040-000-010— 5
Stanford 000-301-910—16
Batteries: Chez and Corzine.
Morris (7); Del Sarto, Cherokee
(7) and Poole.
Did we say something about Se
quoia's strong pitching staff? Well,
to prove that all rumors are false,
unfounded, and completely mis
leading, the frosh baseballers com
pletely annihilated the high school
moundsmen to the tune of 16-5 at
the freshman diamond yesterday.
With Big Jim Walsh doing the
heavy hitting, the local team came
through with two big innings, scor
ing 5 runs in the fourth and a big
9 in the seventh to ice the ball game
for the Papooses.
Sequoia Grabs Lead
The game was not originally such
a romp, however, as Sequoia grab
bed a four-run lead in the second
inning.
After this initial outburst, Joe
Chez, who started as pitcher for
Stanford, tightened up and only al
lowed one more tally, when it did
not make any big difference.
The game was originally sched
uled for seven innings and Se
quoia's early bulge looked pretty
big—that is, until the fourth frame.
The Cherokees' starting hurler,
Tom Del Sarto, had chained the
Papoose sluggers up till then and
looked as though he might keep the
key indefinitely.
Cards Explode
However. Del Sarto suddenly
cracked. He got two men out but
walked two in the meantime.
At this juncture, Jim Walsh, who
had doubled in the second inning,
homered over the left field fence to
bring in three runs.
Jim's monstrous clout seemed to
pick up the whole team, especially
Chez who knocked in two more
runs before the inning was over to
give his team the lead, 5-4.
The contest, as is the custom with
high schools, was supposed to go
only seven innings but due to some
misunderstanding ended up by go
ing the full route.
9-Run Seventh
The frosh, having picked up a
run in the sixth, were leading 6-4
when the game was supposed to
end. They expressed their displeas
ure at longer working hours by ex
ploding with a 9-run seventh frame.
Of course five walks helped the
freshmen more than a little.
