At present. Lake Lagunita is los
ing water at the rate of one mil
lion gallons a day. according to Carl

week. Maier said, the lake may be
gin dropping at its maximum seep
age rate of two million gallons.

the Junior Water Carnival, climax
of the Farm's spring aqua-activities,
a prolonged absence of rain could
mean a loss of some 40 million pre

lion in the lake at Carnival time, a
total not far above last year's all
year high.

main as they are, we can expect to
lose as much as one foot of water
every 10 days.

lion gallons full. Capacity is 118
million gallon?.
