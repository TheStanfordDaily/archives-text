# ROTC Drill Area Offers Unique Training Devices
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
When the Farm's advanced ROTC
students attend the various summer
training camps along the Coast next
July, they should find themselves
well-prepared to cope with the prac
tical problems they will encounter
there.
The credit for their sound prep
aration rests with the ROTC stu
dents themselves, and with Colonel
Basil Perry's diligent staff, which re
cently has supervised the installa
tion of numerous training' devices in
the ROTC drill area.
Foremost among the new training
aids is the terrain board, which was
completed late last year.
The board itself is constructed of
Wire screen, with miniature wooden
buildings, painted roads, and real
istic vegetation composed largely of
toothpicks. It is about 30 feet square
and is mounted about six feet above
the floor.
The field artillery students work
ing out the firing problems sit in
bleachers about 40 feet from the
board. Peering thro u g h field
glasses (which make the board seem
even more realistic), they relay their
calculations to other students, who
make the proper adjustments in the
"guns."
The guns are actually small glass
tubes mounted beneath the terrain
board which can be moved to any
point under the board in accordance
with the instructions of students
solving the firing problems. The
tubes are connected to a series of
bottles which contain chemicals.
When the order to fire is given, a
chemical reaction is set off which
produces a puff of smoke at the
point where the round would have
hit under actual conditions. By
making further calculations from the
location of their previous "shots."
the students are enabled to bring
their "guns ' to bear on the tarnet.
First Lt. Barnel Barco, adjutant
of the Stanford unit, says that the
Stanford terrain board is the best of
the numerous boards he has seen
on army posts throughout the na
tion.
The board has several advantages:
It is located indoors, enabling field
artillery students to carry on prac
tice under any weather conditions:
it is vastly cheaper than actual fir
ing. although almost as realistic;
and it enables the instructor to
mair ' â–  closer supervision over his
sty since the entire firing op
en is centralized within a 100
stjj oot area.
Tlj resent board represents a

great improvement over earlier j
models. The first board was put into
operation at Fort Sill, Okla.. in 1941. j
It was mounted only about two feet
above the ground, and students op- |
erating it were forced to crawl 1
around under it on their stomachs.
The smoke produced by chemical
reaction had not yet been developed,
and several students did nothing but
scurry around under the board,
dragging frantically on cigarettes to
produce the necessary smoke puffs.
Similar to the terrain board is the
Bishop practice range. Located out
doors. the Bishop range affords more !
realism than the terrain board, and j
makes firing conditions somewhat
mce complex. In this system, the
"guns" are miniature howitzers tir
ing one-inch steel balls propelled by |
compressed air. The effect of each j
round is relayed to the gunners by
ar. observation point, and the gun
ners make the corrective computa
tions for each round until the target
is finally hit.
The training facilities of the Air
Corps have also been expanded re
cently. Foremost among the train
ing devices are two cutaway air
craft engines which enable students
to understand the complete opera
tion of power plants and to carry on
maintenance and repair operations.
One of the engines is turned over
by an electric motor.
Another training device is a
large-scale mockup of a gyroscope
which is also operated by an elec
tric motor. Air Corps students also
receive practical instruction in the
maintenance and use of instruments
and controls from an F-51 fighter
located in the drill area.
