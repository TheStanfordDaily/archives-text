Do you draw.' paint? type? wash
windows? walk? talk? or just 101 l
in a chair? Fine! says Trudy Kan
ner. lIR personnel director. "Just
what we need! Drop in over at the
lIR . office some afternoon between
â– j and 5 and we 11 put you to work."
Many jobs in the various inter
national organizations represented
at the lIR office are vacant. Accord
ing to Miss Kanner, the activities
run all the way from making post
ers to helping with correspondence
I with foreign consuls and universi
ties. and only await the appearance
of some willing person to fill them.
In addition to the regular work,
extra jobs have been created by the
approaching model UN Assembly
conference planned for May. Per
sons will be needed to help gather
information, to carry on corre
spondence. and to contact speakers.
Those how working at the lIR
office emphasized that one needn't
be an international relations major
to "crack the circle." as the}' have
noticed so many people felt. Even
among the officers, they reported,
only a very few are "IR" majors.
The others are English, math. ait.
sociology, and "not yet sure" ma
jors. who are just interested in
helping with international work.
Many persons holding executive
positions in the student internation
al organization are seniors and
graduate students who will not be
returning next year. This will leave
many vacancies autumn quarter.
New officers will be elected by
those who have been working for
the lIR. Persons who start now may
be e iijible for election to some oi

these offices. which include presi
dent, vice-president, and personne,
director.
"These officers." says Vice-Presi
dent Marge Bacon, "represent all
Stantord students in their interna
tional activities. More students
should be here to elect them and to
help with their work."
lIR office hours are from 3 to C
every afternoon, but students may
do as much or as little work as
they can and whenever they car,
according to Miss Kanner. "Com
on over and see us," she says. "I'm
tired of seeing the same old faces;
show me some new ones."
