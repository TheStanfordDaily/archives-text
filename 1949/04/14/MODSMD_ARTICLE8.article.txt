# Excom Argues On Constitution
## 
### 
A constitution for a Hiilel Foun
dation on campus was approved,
and the proposed new ASSU Con
stitution was tentatively approved
at Excom meeting last night.
The Hillel constitution, whici'
will give the campus Jewish organ
ization a national affiliation, was
approved by a vote of 13 to 1. The
Foundation will take the place oi
the Brandeis Club.
All parts of the new Constitution,
except for the provisions regarding
representation on Excom, were ten
tatively approved with the under
standing that the Constitutional.
Committee may make further rec
ommendations and that the Consti
tution must again be approved in
its final form before it is submit
ted to the students at a general
election.
A stalemate was reached in th
discussion regarding provisions 02
Excom representation and, after ;
two-hour discussion, it was decide'
to postpone any decision for a weel
in order that living groups migh*
study and submit opinions on the
alternate plans.
Excom discussion developed twe
schools of thought on the represen
tation question â€” those who favor
representation completely on a liv
ing group basis, and those who want
it partly on a living group basis and
partly on an academic class basis
such as the Constitutional Commit
tee recommends.
Maryanne TefTt, Roble Excom
representative, read a letter from
the Roble Senate opposing the pro
posal as it now stands on the
grounds that lower division stu
dents, particularly freshmen, would
be underrepresented. One of the
main duties of an Excom member,
according to Maryanne, is to carry
news back to his constituents and
get their opinions. A girl represent
ing four large dorms could not do
this, she said.
Excom also approved recommen
dations that the Daily editor be
retained as an ex-officio member
of the Executive Committee; that
Honor Code cases be heard at a
joint session of Men's and Women's
Councils; that all living groups
must bank with the ASSU Students'
Organizations Fund; and that peti
tions for direct legislatoin by the
student body must earn,- the sig
natures of at least five per cent of
the student body.
Block "S" letters with superim
posed wings will be awarded Flying
Club members who participate in
three-fourths of the intercollegiate
flying meets.
Discussion 011 the possible termi
nation of NSA at Stanford was post
poned until the next meeting.
