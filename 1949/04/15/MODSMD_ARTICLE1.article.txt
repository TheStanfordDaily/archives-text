# Kidnappers Hit KA's, Russell; Get Goat, Rugs
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Kappa Alpha actives awoke
this morning from a peaceful
night of slumber only to dis
cover the loss of their entire
first-floor furnishings. The
sleepy-eyed brothers, after a
protracted search, found their
living room transplanted to the
front lawn of the Library.
Placed in realistic order were the
carpets, davenports, lamps, tables,
and chairs. The breakfast table was
set completely with Kappa Alpha
silverware, china, and glasse.-;.
Shoes Gone T<m>
In a prominent position was a
greeting card saying "Easter Greet
ings from the KA pledges."
But the traveling furniture was
not the only misfortune. The ac
tives' shoes had been pocketed by
the '"Frosh 12," who felt that the
upper-classmen also should cele
brate the week-old Barefoot Day.
However, lest their brothers miss
their morning engagements, the
shoes were obligingly returned.
By 9 a.m. the hard-working fra
ternity men had moved three truck
loads of furnishings back to the
front lawn of the residence at 562
Lasuen Street.
Smooth Operation
The pledges presumably entered
the house from 2 to 4 a.m. and
worked cautiously for two hours in
moving operations. No disturbance
was caused because the Kappa Al
phas' sleeping porch is fairly dis
tant from the first floor.
The Encinamen conducted the
movements in real fifth column
style. Friendship with the night
policeman was made earlier in the
evening, and the "law" agreed not
to call a halt.
Russell Has Troubles. Too
Not to be outdone by the frater
nity men, women in nearby Russell
House were having their own intra
house battles. Rivalry rose between
the junior and sophomore residents,
and in the process, the juniors kid
naped a goat from the front porch.
The animal had been the property
of one of the girls' distant relatives.
Yesterday afternoon, Russell
House was decorated with signs
"Remember the Lindberg Case" and
"Sold one $10 Goat."
Eager to participate, the still-un
settled KAs joined in the disturb
ance and helped one junior woman
escape from the sophomore residents
in the house.
