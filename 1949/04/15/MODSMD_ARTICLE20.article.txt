# '50 Float Deadline Set for April 23
## 
### 
Everything from Cleo's Barge to
Three Men in a Tub has been >
turned in as a theme for the Junior
Class Water Carnival float parade, !
according to Allen Bletz, co-chair- j
man of the Carnival. The deadline j
for signing up floats is April 23.
Floats which are so big and bulky i
that they cannot be propelled 'by J
paddling or pushing may use a mo- I
tor il they indicate it when signing
up their float.
The over-all Carnival will dis
play an Olympics theme with a i
pyre that will burn throughout the â– 
afternoon of the water carnival.
"Living groups, if they do not al- 1
ready have a flag, should make
one, said Bletz, '"so that their flag
can be raised if anyone in their liv- J
ing group wins an event."
