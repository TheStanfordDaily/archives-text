# Red Cross Gives Surf Tips
## 
### 
Mrs. Margaret Barr, chairman of
water safety for the Palo Alto Area
Red Cross, today released a list of
safety suggestions for Stanford stu
dents who do surf swimming.
Mrs. Barr stressed that even the
most experienced swimmers have
encountered difficulty at Rio del
Mar this year and that no one should
underestimate the need for caution.
Most California beaches do not have
life guards, she said, and it is every
individual's responsibility to protect
himself.
. Here are some safety rules to re- |
member:
1. Whenever trying to come
ashore, swim laterally and then play
the waves to get in.

2. Never try to swim up a wave;
swim down the slope of the wave.
3. Whenever a wave is going' to
break on you, submerge immedi
ately.
4. II the wind is strong and blow
ing from the sea, keep your body in
a horizontal position near the sur
lace of the water. If the wind is
blowing from the beach, keep your
body in a perpendicular position.
