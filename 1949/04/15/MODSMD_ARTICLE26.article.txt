## Swim Every Sunday 
### 
Last Sunday men from the Toyon-Crothers-Encina living area
tried to escape the heat by slipping into the closed Encina swim
ming pools. But every half-hour a watchman on duty unlocked
the gates and shooed potential swimmers away. A campus police
officer, in addition, kept driving around the area all day in order
to prevent trespassing around the pools.
Last summer—when there were fewer men living on campus
—the pools were open to Sunday swimmers. The desire of Farm
Boughs to use the pools this quarter every Sunday certainly is
210 less than it was during the summer quarter.
We recommend that the University employ one or two men
to take charge of the Encina pools each Sunday for the rest of
the quarter. Many men refuse to swim in Lake Lagunita because
of its muddy water, and the Encina pools are their only other
cutlet.
