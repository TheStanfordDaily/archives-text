To the Editor:
I went to my first Excom meeting last night. I was curious to see how
that body represented its nearly 8.000 constituents. The proposal I was
most interested in was the representation phase of the proposed consti
tution.
Those who drafted the constitution presented a thoughtful, logical, and
thoroughly democratic system of representation. Their idea is to give two
kinds of representation: one by the type of living residence, and one by
the class that we are in.
Everything seemed to be going on a high plane of careful consideration,
complimentary to the high intellect of Stanford students. Then, suddenly,
Excom was turned into a melee of blinded interests. One member, using
the adolescent technique of name-calling and tongue-lashing, sought her
private goal over that of the ASSU. She violated a democratic premise
you learn in Poly Sci I—by wanting arbitrarily to assign more repre
sentatives to one group than another.
I think that everyone in the whole student body deserves democratic
instead of arbitrary representation, for we all pay our fee. Yet, she
asserted that '"interested" groups—those who show more interest in
certain goings-on—should have more representatives than those of lis
who are oftentimes lax. I ask, just who is Excom to determine what group
has more "interest' than another? What are they going to use, an ap
plause meter?
I strenuously object to her theory because I think this only continues
to deprive me of my representation (originated in wartime) just because
I'm like the average Stanford student who doesn't sit on Exeom's coat
tails day and night.
The women should realize that the ratio exists on Wednesday nights
(Exeom's meeting night) as well as on the weekend. Give us back what
we lost during the women-inflated war days.
Think it over, Excom, you looked foolish last night and the slim margin
oi your vote of confidence to the constitution committee was gosh-awful
wishy-washy. "United, you know—."
