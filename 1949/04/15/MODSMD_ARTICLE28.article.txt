# Fundamentals of Representation
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We are fortunate to have had a sincere and hard-working Constitu
tional Committee who have attempted to use their technical knowledge
to incorporate the best wishes of the student body, other than their own
interests, in a clear and concise document.
They have proposed a system of Excom membership based on types of
living groups and classes, designated to achieve opportunity for numerical
equality in voting. Their system achieves this purpose. But does it achieve
the fundamental purpose of representation on the executive and legis
lative body?
A system of representation may be put to the following test of:
1. Adequacy of voting procedure.
2. Felt responsibility of Excom members for representative function.
3. Effectiveness of information channels between representatives and
constituents.
4. Effectiveness of opinion channels between constituents and Excom
members.
How does the system proposed by the committee achieve representation?
1. It affords opportunity for numerical equality in voting. But neither
Encina, nor Roble, nor Branner, as at present, vote for their area repre
sentative, since elections are held in the spring, and the freshmen don't
arrive until fall. The area vote is monopolized by Toyon and Lagunita.
2. Class representatives have constituents in every living area. The
committee claims that responsibility will be felt through improved and
intricate class organization, since it is not adequate at present. Isn't this
like buying a package without knowing its contents?
3. Area representatives would have to send information through twice
oi three times as many channels, i.e.. men's halls, through Encina, Toyon,
and Crothers house meetings. Class representatives would have to go
first to their class Excoms, each of which would send a delegate to each
area. Which, if any of these, give information to the area? Or, are class
Excoms simply to be groups privileged with a representative?
4. Opinions of students on important issues have little direct means of
reflection unless each Exeoin member is willing to spend time with each
individual who wishes to express an opinion, or unless each member will
hold weekly area and class meetings. We trust not at the same time!)
The system proposed by the committee affords opportunity for numer
ical opportunity in voting.
Once you have selected your Excom members, do they afford you the
kind of representation you want?
