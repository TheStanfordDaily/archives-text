To the Editor:
Does no one on campus question the special appropriation made Wednes
day niis'nt by Excom to the personal account of the student manager so
he can make an inspection tour of an eastern university? This is the same
student manager who is now paid SlOO a month. Is this the money the
student manager could not appropriate for debate, lIR, and others?

(Editor's Note: The money will come from The Daily Improvement
Fund, which has no relation to ASSIJ administrative or organizational
money. Thr student was authorized to spend up to $500 for his travel
expenses. For complete information, sec Page 1 of toda> Daily.)
