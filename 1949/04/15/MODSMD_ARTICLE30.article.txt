### Priscilla Claudius 
THE WAYS OF A MUD DAUBER
by George D. Shafcr (Stanford
University Press)
This is a rare type of book which,
although primarily intended for a
scientific treatise upon the character
and habits of a species of wasps, also
is written with a trace of humor
and a depth of understanding.
Shafcr's "creature people" are ob
viously his friends.
And he writes of them as his
friends. Although there is a great
deal of extremely technical matter,
such as the physical make-up of
wasp larvae and the enzyme, uri
case which Doctor Shafer discov
ered in the larvaes' digestive tracts,
there is also material which is less
objective and more lively for the
scientifically uninformed.
He tells of one female wasp with
whom he became very friendly dur
ing her fchree month life span. Out
of the bee house she was able to
recognize him and flew to his hand
where Dr. Shafer normally fed her
a drop of honey. This incident,
among others bears out Shafer's
contention that wasps definitely
have personality.
Unfortunately, this book fails to
explain two points of great interest
to Stanford students: (1) Why they
persist in stinging someone with no
apparent provocation; and (2) How
to keep them away from the Cellar.
