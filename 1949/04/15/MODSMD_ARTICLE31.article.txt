# New Travel Plan Offered
## 
### 
Two pay-as-you-go summer proj
ects have been announced by the
lIR and YWCA offices. The proj
ects are set up so that students who
must work in the summer will be
able to participate.
The students-in-industry projects
in various parts of the country give
students a chance to observe indus
trial problems at first hand. Through
sponsoring committees, they are
given full-time jobs to finance their
summer study. Student-planned
seminars, discussions, and social in
quiry trips help participants' 1 meet
leaders of management and labor.
The program also includes recrea
tion and field trips.
Students will be employed at
regular wages and live in coopera
tive houses to help keep room and
board costs at a minimum.
The other project is a citizenship
seminar of 90 students to be held
in Washington, D.C., this summer.
Its purpose will be to aid students
in understanding the democratic
process, and to give them a sense
of the individual's responsibility in
a democracy.
Students will spend the first week
in Washington attending Congres
sional hearings, observing the Sen
ate, House, and the Supreme Court,
and meeting informed Washington
ians. The remaining eight weeks
will be spent in government, jobs at
regular wages. Part of the time will
be given to seminars with outstand
ing leaders and to the inevitable
field trips.
The seminar director will 'help
students get jobs with government
agencies before they go to Wash
ington. The money earned will
cover the eost of the trip, and par
ticipants will get first-hand knowl
edge of the government.
Application blanks for any of the
summer projects may be obtained at
the lIR or YWCA offices, or from
Florence Ilfeld and Shirlcv Hill.
