RANDOM RAMBLINGS:
One of the University's accounting professors was holding forth in
class yesterday on the subject of the relation of stockholders to a cor
poration.
Sez he: "Now I want you to understand that the stockholders f )n not

wrw*«. ,>v/u \KJ Uiiwwmmiu llJcll UIU MULIiXIUIUUIS CIO Il<H
actually own the corporation. This is impossible, be
cause a corporation is an individual in the eyes of th<
law; and one individual cannot be owned by another."
Then, with the kno.wing smile of a well-trained hus
band. he added: "Unless the two individuals happen
to be married!"

Fred Steiner, one of KSU's better announcers, was
narrating a dramatic show on the campus station the
other night. As he came to a part in a script where
some police sirens were scheduled to come in. he
: * J C * l i .cc A. xiTi. i

read his line and waited for the sound effect. When it became apparent
that something was wrong with the siren effect, he quickly ad libbed in
a few lines, ending in another cue for the sirens. But still no sound effects.
Finally, with a warning l glance at the producer, he moved back up to
the microphone and extemporized: "Ah. I see the mounted police have
arrived!"

Ordinarily no Stanford athlete ever has the opportunity to win more
than three varsity letters in the same sport. There are. however, several
men in school who, because of wartime rules which allowed freshmen to
compete in varsity sports, will earn four letters in the same sport (e.g., bas
ketballer Gus Chavalas).
We were talking about this the other day, and someone asked what
award the school will make to these men when they earn that fourth letter.
How about the following suggestion contributed by one of my two friends?
For the first letter, a red block sweater; second year, a white block
sweater; third year, a monogrammed Stanford blanket: and for the fourth
year, a great big autographed picture of .... A 1 Masters.

If that beach party of yours breaks up by 8 p.m. this Sunday evening,
you might get near a radio and grab a few minutes of the new Dean
Martin-Jerry Lewis variety show on KNBC. It's an interesting show for
several reasons.
First, the new program represents a partial answer by the National
Broadcasting Company to the recent CBS "talent raids" on NBC personnel.
NBC executives are hoping' that the new Martin-Lewis show will bolster
their sagging Sunday evening lineup.
Second, the show itself has a freshness of youth. Lewis is only 23. and
Martin is not a great deal older. Martin, who is also being pushed'by
Capitol Records as a coming singing star, handles the vocals and "plays
straight" for Lewis' zany comedy. The result may prove interesting to
you. It did to me.

Ordinarily no Stanford athlete ever has the opportunity to win more
than three varsity letters in the same sport. There are. however, several
men in school who, because of wartime rules which allowed freshmen to
compete in varsity sports, will earn four letters in the same sport (e.g., bas
ketballer Gus Chavalas).
We were talking about this the other day, and someone asked what
award the school will make to these men when they earn that fourth letter.
How about the following suggestion contributed by one of my two friends?
For the first letter, a red block sweater; second year, a white block
sweater; third year, a monogrammed Stanford blanket: and for the fourth
year, a great big autographed picture of .... A 1 Masters.

If that beach party of yours breaks up by 8 p.m. this Sunday evening,
you might get near a radio and grab a few minutes of the new Dean
Martin-Jerry Lewis variety show on KNBC. It's an interesting show for
several reasons.
First, the new program represents a partial answer by the National
Broadcasting Company to the recent CBS "talent raids" on NBC personnel.
NBC executives are hoping' that the new Martin-Lewis show will bolster
their sagging Sunday evening lineup.
Second, the show itself has a freshness of youth. Lewis is only 23. and
Martin is not a great deal older. Martin, who is also being pushed'by
Capitol Records as a coming singing star, handles the vocals and "plays
straight" for Lewis' zany comedy. The result may prove interesting to
you. It did to me.

actually own the corporation. This is impossible, be
cause a corporation is an individual in the eyes of th<
law; and one individual cannot be owned by another."
Then, with the kno.wing smile of a well-trained hus
band. he added: "Unless the two individuals happen
to be married!"
