# Chaplain's Chat

### PAUL C. JOHNSTON. Chaplain 
Let me share three things with
our readers this week: one. a note
about Sunday night broadcasts; sec
ond, some more news about the
Conference on Campus Religion;
and third, final Holy Week an
nouncements.
Possibly many students are not
aware that the Inter-laith Commit
tee of the Memorial Church Com
mittee broadcasts over KSU each
Sunday night from 7:45 to 8 p.m.
The programs are of varied con
tent, and we believe, very much
worth listening to. Each Chaplain
has appeared recently a couple of
weeks ago Dr. Hugh Moran, who
for more than 25 years was on the
United Church Work Council at
Cornell University, spoke on re
ligious programs and practices on
the American campus; and there are
other such speakers arranged.
In addition, the Church Clubs de
scribe their work and plans, seria
tim. Next Sunday night Bill Loper,
chairman of Inter-faith, will tell of
the central aims of this fine organ
ization, and outline what it is seek
ing for Stanford. I suggest that you
dial 880 and hear him.
The Conference on Religion,
whose first of two sessions will con
vene on Saturday morning. April
30, 5) a.m., begins to look very good.
The meeting will be held at Cub
berley Auditorium rather than in
the Women's Clubhouse as first an
nounced. Interest in this activity is
keen, and the prospects are that at
least 200 students will be present.
They will be representative of the
various living groups, other campus

| elements, the curerntly organized
church groups, the YWCA, et cetera.
Mark Hatfield will chair the meet
ing, and full discussion of the needs
and desires of the students for a
more competent religious organiza
tion and work will be offered.
Let me repeat that any student of
| Stanford who cares to be present for
this unusual event is cordially in
vited to come. It will be. however,
a courtesy to the Church Committee
and the Chaplains if prior notice of
of intention to attend be registered
at the Church Ve.stry.
Holy Week finals: The three-hour
Good Friday service will be held at
the Church this afternoon. Special
bulletins chart the service in seven
major sections.
Mr. Minto will speak during the
first period, anil Dr. Johnston, duri
the last; with five neighborhood
! minister friends speaking during the
i other parts. Worshippers may come
j and go as they choose.
Easter Day ought to be a fine
l celebration. The most careful
minute-by-minute schedule for the
8:30 a.m. service in Frost Amphi
theater has been prepared by NBC,
the Kadio Workshop, and the
Church.
Features of the first 30-minute
112 national broadcast will include
President Sterling's greetings, the
University Choir of (50 voices, the
University Brass Choir of 40 pieces,
and a Choral Speaking - Group of
24 voices. Following that I am to
aive a brief sermon. At 11 a.m.
there will be a full Easter Service in
the Memorial Church.
Come early and claim your seats!
