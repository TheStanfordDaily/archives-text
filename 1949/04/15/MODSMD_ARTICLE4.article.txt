# Excom Approves Money For Study of Varitype
## 
### 
Excom approved Publication Council minutes Wednesday
night authorizing Student Manager John Pool up to $500 for
round-trip travel expenses to New Haven, Conn., to observe the
administrative details employed to print the Yale Daily News in
Varitype.
The money will be taken from The Daily Improvement Fund.

The fund has no relation to ASSU
administrative or organizational
funds in that it is Daily savings in
tended to be spent on plant im
provements.
Purpose of Pool's trip is to bring
out answers to such administrative
questions as:
Querie*
How is Yale Varitype labor em
ployed? Who manages press fi
nances? How? What is done with
the Varitype machine and the offset
press when the Daily News is not
being published? How have Yale
Daily News personnel handled ail of
their administrative work since they
began Varitype publication?
The student manager's trip will
climax a year-long study in which
he has compared the new process
with present methods of printing.
Pool will spend two or three days
in New Haven. He will be away
from the campus about five days.
Meanwhile, he has received com
plete contracts, estimates of a sam
ple Daily set in Varitype, and de
scriptive material from companies
dea.ing in Varitype machines. He
has discussed Varitype with repre
sentatives from the American Type
Founders and the Cozhead Corp,
If the new printing system is
adopted for The Daily. Pool said,
the company supplying the ma
chines will send a foreman to op
erate the new pljnt for three months
and to make all necessary adjust
ments without additional cost.
l T sed in Chicago
Varitype was first used commer
cially by Chicago papers during
their war a year ago with the In
ternational Typographical Union,
aince this inception, said Pool, it
has been "vastly improved."
Yale University first took up the
process in November of 1948. Now
operating under student manage

ment, as Stanford would do. it has
cut costs 30 per cent.
Pool declared:
"The advantages of the process
are that it's 30 to 50 per cent less
expensive than conventional print
ing and at the some time gives the
publication a magazine quality."
If The Daily were to switch to
Varitvpe, explained Pool, the ASSU
would become printers as well as
publishers. Now the ASSU hires out
the services of a printing firm. Us
ing Varitvpe, it would hire its own
personnel.
Pool added that the University
administration approves in principle
the change to Varitvpe.
