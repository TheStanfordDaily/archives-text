# 'Grimm' Slow, Acting Good
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
"The Return of Peter Grimm," if
a little slow for most audiences to
take, came to the Stanford stage last
night with an amazing amount of
sentiment and spark for a play
written for 1912.
Morgan Stock displayed a grand i
command of his part as the kindly
old Dutch bachelor. Frank King as
his friend and doctor joined him to
produce the most enjoyable parts !
of the play.
Hope Sterling, seen before in bit
parts, did particular justice to her j
role as the sweet and innocent
Katherine. The cast as a whole Jived |
up to their parts well, with the pos
sible exception of the minister's j
wife, who resorted to whipping
across the stage each time she was
insulted.
The simple plot allowed plenty of i
time to look over the setting, which j
was both quaint and intriguing. The '
family warmth of the living room. |
which offered the many attractions '
of h regular home, provided inter- !
esting material for thought when
the plot chugged along.
The mood of the play was tender
and amusing, like an old family j
joke. Perhaps it can best be dc- I
scribcd by the sccne in which the ;
doctor says that Peter is dead. The
little boy replied, "But he can't be. 1
I ve got the tickets to the circus." !
A few tickets are left for tonight
and tomorrow night at the Memo
rial Auditorium box office. The
price is 90 cents.
