# Haynie Predicts Another Tank Triumph Over Cal
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The man of confidence was beam
ing again yesterday.
Tom Haynie, still looking at the
world through his rose - colored
glasses despite the as yet uncertain
eligibility status of his ace tanker,
Ralph Sala, yesterday made another
of his characteristic modesty-lack
ing predictions concerning the Stan
ford-Cal swimming meet scheduled
for Berkeley Saturday afternoon.
"There's no doubt about it,"the
balding tank coach asserted. "We
should win our 38th victory in a
row Saturday."
USC Next Week
The weekend's outing, which the
Card swimmers consider a warm
up drill for the all-important meet
ing with USC's supermen here at
the Farm next Saturday, will find
the Indians at top strength—with
the possible exception, of course, of
the econ-grappling Sala.
Best race of the afternoon, ac
cording to the crystal-gazing Hay
nie, will be the 200-yai - d breast
stroke affair pitting Stanford's Don
Hester and Marsh Pearlman against
Bear flash Waldo Cook.
Hester should take it, but even
Haynie admits that it'll be close.
Another highlight of the meet
will be the sprint battles between
Cards Woody Hoogs and Harry
Borchers and Cal's top man, Don
Fisher. It'll be a dogfight between
the three in both the 50- and 100-
yard splashes, although Fisher has

racked up slightly better times than
his Farm opponents in previous
performances.
Fisher has done the 50 in 24 sec
onds flat, and the 100 in 54 flat.
Diving competition also promises
to be close, with Stanford's Jim
Bradshaw and Karl Herrmann tus
seling with Cal's Luchessi for top
honors.
And the Relay Teams
Jack Weeden, Wes Fry, and Hes
ter will carry the Card banner in
the 300-yard medley; Herb Stokely
and John Mowat are scheduled for
the 220 free-style; Jack and Don
Weeden will show their wares in
the 150-yard backstroke; Bill Mil
lard and Mowat will enter the 440;
and the 400 - yard freestyle relay
will find A 1 Horak, Chuck Kelly,
Ed Major, Rod Mead, and Warren
Cutting ready to make their big
splash.
As a preliminary to the Big Swim,
Ed Rudloff's freshman tankers will
take on the Cal yearlings.
Bruce Putnam and Bob Wycoff
are scheduled for starring roles in
this one. Putnam will race in the
220-yard freestyle and the 150-yard
backstroke, with Wycoff slated for
both sprint events.
Both boys are also expected to see
action in the four-man relay, where
they'll be joined by Phil Chapman
and Judd Blaney.

the Indians at top strength—with
the possible exception, of course, of
the econ-grappling Sala.
Best race of the afternoon, ac
cording to the crystal-gazing Hay
nie, will be the 200-yai - d breast
stroke affair pitting Stanford's Don
Hester and Marsh Pearlman against
Bear flash Waldo Cook.
Hester should take it, but even
Haynie admits that it'll be close.
Another highlight of the meet
will be the sprint battles between
Cards Woody Hoogs and Harry
Borchers and Cal's top man, Don
Fisher. It'll be a dogfight between
the three in both the 50- and 100-
yard splashes, although Fisher has

racked up slightly better times than
his Farm opponents in previous
performances.
Fisher has done the 50 in 24 sec
onds flat, and the 100 in 54 flat.
Diving competition also promises
to be close, with Stanford's Jim
Bradshaw and Karl Herrmann tus
seling with Cal's Luchessi for top
honors.
And the Relay Teams
Jack Weeden, Wes Fry, and Hes
ter will carry the Card banner in
the 300-yard medley; Herb Stokely
and John Mowat are scheduled for
the 220 free-style; Jack and Don
Weeden will show their wares in
the 150-yard backstroke; Bill Mil
lard and Mowat will enter the 440;
and the 400 - yard freestyle relay
will find A 1 Horak, Chuck Kelly,
Ed Major, Rod Mead, and Warren
Cutting ready to make their big
splash.
As a preliminary to the Big Swim,
Ed Rudloff's freshman tankers will
take on the Cal yearlings.
Bruce Putnam and Bob Wycoff
are scheduled for starring roles in
this one. Putnam will race in the
220-yard freestyle and the 150-yard
backstroke, with Wycoff slated for
both sprint events.
Both boys are also expected to see
action in the four-man relay, where
they'll be joined by Phil Chapman
and Judd Blaney.
The man of confidence was beam
ing again yesterday.
Tom Haynie, still looking at the
world through his rose - colored
glasses despite the as yet uncertain
eligibility status of his ace tanker,
Ralph Sala, yesterday made another
of his characteristic modesty-lack
ing predictions concerning the Stan
ford-Cal swimming meet scheduled
for Berkeley Saturday afternoon.
"There's no doubt about it,"the
balding tank coach asserted. "We
should win our 38th victory in a
row Saturday."
USC Next Week
The weekend's outing, which the

the econ-grappling Sala.
