# Baseballers Look For Win Over California
## 
### 
Stanford's hustling baseballers,
riding the crest of a four - game j
CIBA winning streak, will be out
after first place in the Conference
standings tomorrow afternoon when
the Indians tangle with California's
I Golden Bears on the Sunken Dia- j
j mond.
The Cards already hold one CIBA
decision over the faltering Berkley- |
jtes, and if all goes according to
' plan tomorrow, the Indians should
be riding at the top of the heap
with a season's record of four wins
and two losses.
Coach Harry Wolter will probably
start one of his pitching Daves—
Dahle or Stott. Stott has had the
most rest, but Dahle, who already
holds one win over Cal this season,
may get the starting nod.
Cal will undoubtedly send fire
balling Jackie Jensen to the mound t
| again. Golden Boy has started in !
every CIBA contest that the Bears
have played, but he hasn't finished
too many. The Bears were sched- |
uled for a CIBA contest with UCLA
at Berkeley yesterday, and if Jen- '
| sen went in that one then Clint
Evans will use either of his number
two men—Dave Anderson or Whim
py Jones.
The Stanford reserves had their
; day yesterday as the varsity stag- \
j gered through to a 10 to 7 win over i
invading San Diego State.
Fast balling Jack Heinen had the :
visitors cold, 10 to 2, going into the
i top half of the ninth, but when it

was all over five San Diego run
i had crossed the plate and the Card
were mighty glad to get out of i
with their scalp. For the secon
game in a row, fireman Jim Clay
pool was sent to the rescue afte
| Heinen's control blew sky high i
the eventful ninth.
The contest was played for th
| most part by the rookies. Captai
Bill Arce, holding down his regul?
i third base position, and sophomor
Jim Trabucco, playing in left fiel<
led the Cards at the plate—eac
with two for five and two runs bat
! ted in.
