# Netsters Blank Cal Poly, 11-0; Travel to Berkeley Tomorrow
## 
### 
After blanking Cal Poly, 11-0,
yesterday, the varsity will take on
the Cal tennis squad tomorrow on
the Berkeley courts. The frosh net
ters also play at Cal in the morn
ing.
The win over Poly was the sec
ond in a row for the varsity. With
Kirke Mechem's sore arm in good
shape once again, the Cal matches
look like a closey.
Never dropping a single set, the
varsity completely whitewashed the
Mustangs. In the day' feature Bob
Lewis scored a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
Bob Carlson. Brother Fred Lewis
had an easier time with Bob Red
den, winning 6-3, 6-0.
Other Indian victors in the sin
gles were Lucien Barbour, Errol
Lycette, Vince Schmeider, Bruce
Taft, John Huneke, and Phil Niel
sen. Two extra singles were played,
as both teams agreed to the addi
tional matches.
Mechem and Bob Forbes, loosen
ing up for the Cal clash, gave the
Mustang top tandem a tough time,
winning 6-1, 6-3. Barbour and Niel
son grabbed the second doubles, and
the third was called because of
lateness.

l As for the undefeated frosh, the
Cal match should be fairly easy.
For the past performance seekers,
Cal dropped an 8-1 decision to
Monterey High recently. The Pa- j
i pooses' third man, Tom Lewyn, has
taken the high school's top star in ,
j straight sets. Saturday's contest i
< shapes up like another lop - sided [
; win for the local netters.
