# Gunfire, Singing, Tears Proclaim Irish Republic

DUBLIN. The Republic of Ire
land, Monday, April 18 (AP) —
The thundering of cannon, jubi
lant singing in the streets, and
a few tears marked the birth to
day of the Free and Indepen
dent Republic of Ireland.
Promptly on the stroke of mid
night Irishmen formally celebrated
the regaining of independenee they
lost to Britain 780 years ago.
All the pomp and pageantry the
country could muster went imo the
proclamation that Ireland and its
2,500,000 population were no longer
a vaguely defined possession of the
British Empire.
But six of the Northern Counties
remain a part of the United King
dom. Even there the independence
spirit bubbled over.
Irish artillerymen wheeled Im
pounder cannon onto the O'Connell
Bridge and fired a 21-gun salute
from the spot where Irish blood
ran red in the rebellion that started
33 years ago.
As the camion fire and salutes of
the infantry rifles died away a tat
tered tri-color flag was raised slowly
to the top of the flagstaff on the
Dublin Post Office.
Tears streamed down the faces of
oldsters who saw the banner raised
once before 011 the same building—
on that 191G Easter Monday when a
"handful of desperate men" declared
Ireland to be a sovereign state and
in a short time proved their faith
with their lives.
Independence actually was as
sured last December when the Dail
(parliament) repealed the law al
lowing King George of England to
put his name on the credentials of
Irish diplomats.
The celebration was delayed, how

ever, until Easter Monday, the 33rd
anniversary of the Easter Monday
uprising in 1916.
That means Ireland will celebrate
its independence 011 a different date
each year—whenever Easter Mon
day falls.
There was a bitter note, however.
Eamon De Valera, veteran Irish
rebel and former premier, said his
Fianna Fail Party would not join in
the national celebrations.
De Valera takes the position there
should be no rejoicing as long as
the six Northern Counties are sep
arated from the rest of Ireland.
