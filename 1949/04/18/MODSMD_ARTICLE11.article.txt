AD GLIBS: A cute scene was
caught a couple days ago in the
chow hall. A gal was showing a guy
a stunt. She had him place his
hand fiat on the table, then stuck
matches between each of his fingers
and lighted them. After an appro
priate pause, she and her cohorts
burst out with, "Happy birthday to
you . . . etc."
Then, in the chow line there is a
sign which says "Pass through the
line quickly, please." Beneath it
some wag has inscribed, "Don't we
wish we could."
