## About That Varitype 
### 
Several students, University Press employees, and faculty
members spoke to us with raised eyebrows the other day.
"Do you realize what you are doing?" they asked, referring
to Publication Council's decision to investigate further the possi
bility of installing varitype equipment for The Daily.
This much we realize. Varitype offers a better product because
The Daily could be printed on better grade paper. Automatically
we would have better detailed photos. In addition, The Daily's
art variety \ftpuld be expanded to include drawings and pictures
that we cafinot have now because of high engraving costs. The
student manager will spend three or four hundred dollars of
Daily Improvement Fund money to go to Yale University at
New Haven, Conn. There he will check the technical and ad
ministrative angles—and difficulties—of varitype production.
He must see whether the process will affect prepared local,
regional and national display advertising The Daily publishes.
He must see how students participate in the actual mechanical
production of the Yale Daily News. What provision is made for
full-time labor employment when the Daily News is not being
pupblished? How are late stories rushed into print? If an error
is made, how costly is the process of changing the entire page?
Friday's front page news story said the administration ap
proved in principle the change to varitype. So do we. But we
can't present all the facts for Publications Council and Excom to
consider.
The few hundred dollars involved in the further investigation
cost is a wiser expense than our spending thousands of dollars
because the principle is good.
