## Excom Representation 
### 
To the Editor:
The problem before the Constitution Committee in setting up a system
of representation on Excom boils down to this—how to select 15 or 1G
people to speak for 8,000. Theie are dillerent groups, interests, and ele
ments in the student body. Excom needs some knowledge of all such
interests and groups to function properly, but certainly no one of them
should be given a chance to monopolize the ASSU. So the problem is one
of classification, of recognizing reasonable subdivisions in the student body.
A Stanford student can be classified in a number of ways: by age, by
sex, by living group, by type of living group, by activities! by home, bi
sections of the alphabet, by class, by religion, by m;ijor department, but
obviously not all of these are suitable voting subdivisions. One propo
sition before the Constitution Committee was that students be classified
by living group—that is. that each living group elect a representative u>
Excom. This might work if all living groups were the same size, but
they are not. Besides, the off-campus students —some 3.000 strong —have
no living groups at 511. Another defect in a pure living-group represen
tation plan is this—a member chosen from a small cohesive group and in
intimate contact with that group and no other would only be the agent
and delegate of that group.
This, in my opinion, is undesirable. Excom members should not be
representatives of any particular group or organization; each should
attempt to think in terms of the welfare and interests of the whole student
body. Bluntly, Excom members should vote in line with their own good
judgment and not as a particular organization instructs them. Besides,
the ASSU is not a federation of subordinate groups with layer on layer,
echelon on echelon, between students and Excom; every student is a
member of the Associated Students in his or her own right. He or she is
entitled to express an opion whether Toyon Council or Roble Senate
approve it or not.
After many hours of discussion, the Constitution Committee adopted
the plan presented in Art. 111, Sec. 3 of the proposed new constitution, a
plan which fits the facts of Stanford and which recognizes both local and
over-all interests. Feeling that any one basis of classification would be
inadequate, the Committee has recommended that the student body be
classified in two ways: by class in the University, and by, not living
groups, but types of living groups.
This set-up comes much closer to providing effective and equal repre
sentation than does the present jerry-built arrangement. That the off
campus district has only one member is balanced by the fact that each
off-campus student con vote in the election of a member on a class basis.
No longer will about 1,000 on-campus women elect four members and
some 2,000 Village residents elect two members—or some 3.000 off-campus
students two members. (To justify giving 1.000 women in campus resi
dences as many representatives as 5,000 other students, one would have to
assume that the contribution of the residents of Roble, Lagunita, etc., was
five times as. valuable and significant as that of Village and off-campus
residents—which I doubt.)
The letter in Friday's Daily from Misses Morgan. Radalj, Gavin, and
Hodges presents several objections to the committee's plan. In general,
they seem to visualize Excom members taking every issue back to some
other group, a house, a corridor, a class excom, or an area excom, and
bringing back the decision of that group to the ASSU Excom. I under
stand that the Excom members from Roble and Lagunita try to do this
at the present time. I gather from Friday's letter that this is advocated
as the ideal plan for the whole campus, and that the committee's proposal
is criticized fov not making this compulsory or at least easy. In my opinion,
the committee had no intention of encouraging any such continual trotting
back and forth from meeting to meeting.
In the first place, the whole student body, not a group of organiza
tions, is supposed to he represented on Excom. In the second place, Excom
members are presumed to be, if not smarter, at least not less intelligent
than the average student. They can and should think for themselves, and
riot let a class excom or a house or corridor meeting do it for them.
This custom of referring everything back to the group may be thought
desirable in Roble, Lagunita, and one of two other large halls or units.
But it is just not workable for many of the present Excom districts and
is certainly not the practice of all Excom members. I don't believe the
committee had any idea of imposing such a practice as an integral part
of their plan on the whole student body, and I do not think that any plan
based on this "Roble" theory of representation should be adopted. 1 don't
insist that the whole new constitution is pcrfect. but I heartily endorse the
committee's plan for double-barrelled Excom representation.

dences as many representatives as 5,000 other students, one would have to
assume that the contribution of the residents of Roble, Lagunita, etc., was
five times as. valuable and significant as that of Village and off-campus
residents—which I doubt.)
The letter in Friday's Daily from Misses Morgan. Radalj, Gavin, and
Hodges presents several objections to the committee's plan. In general,
they seem to visualize Excom members taking every issue back to some
other group, a house, a corridor, a class excom, or an area excom, and
bringing back the decision of that group to the ASSU Excom. I under
stand that the Excom members from Roble and Lagunita try to do this
at the present time. I gather from Friday's letter that this is advocated
as the ideal plan for the whole campus, and that the committee's proposal
is criticized fov not making this compulsory or at least easy. In my opinion,
the committee had no intention of encouraging any such continual trotting
back and forth from meeting to meeting.
In the first place, the whole student body, not a group of organiza
tions, is supposed to he represented on Excom. In the second place, Excom
members are presumed to be, if not smarter, at least not less intelligent
than the average student. They can and should think for themselves, and
riot let a class excom or a house or corridor meeting do it for them.
This custom of referring everything back to the group may be thought
desirable in Roble, Lagunita, and one of two other large halls or units.
But it is just not workable for many of the present Excom districts and
is certainly not the practice of all Excom members. I don't believe the
committee had any idea of imposing such a practice as an integral part
of their plan on the whole student body, and I do not think that any plan
based on this "Roble" theory of representation should be adopted. 1 don't
insist that the whole new constitution is pcrfect. but I heartily endorse the
committee's plan for double-barrelled Excom representation.

To the Editor:
The problem before the Constitution Committee in setting up a system
of representation on Excom boils down to this—how to select 15 or 1G
people to speak for 8,000. Theie are dillerent groups, interests, and ele
ments in the student body. Excom needs some knowledge of all such
interests and groups to function properly, but certainly no one of them
should be given a chance to monopolize the ASSU. So the problem is one
of classification, of recognizing reasonable subdivisions in the student body.
A Stanford student can be classified in a number of ways: by age, by
sex, by living group, by type of living group, by activities! by home, bi
sections of the alphabet, by class, by religion, by m;ijor department, but
obviously not all of these are suitable voting subdivisions. One propo
sition before the Constitution Committee was that students be classified
by living group—that is. that each living group elect a representative u>
Excom. This might work if all living groups were the same size, but
they are not. Besides, the off-campus students —some 3.000 strong —have
no living groups at 511. Another defect in a pure living-group represen
tation plan is this—a member chosen from a small cohesive group and in
intimate contact with that group and no other would only be the agent
and delegate of that group.
This, in my opinion, is undesirable. Excom members should not be
representatives of any particular group or organization; each should
attempt to think in terms of the welfare and interests of the whole student
body. Bluntly, Excom members should vote in line with their own good
judgment and not as a particular organization instructs them. Besides,
the ASSU is not a federation of subordinate groups with layer on layer,
echelon on echelon, between students and Excom; every student is a
member of the Associated Students in his or her own right. He or she is
entitled to express an opion whether Toyon Council or Roble Senate
approve it or not.
After many hours of discussion, the Constitution Committee adopted
the plan presented in Art. 111, Sec. 3 of the proposed new constitution, a
plan which fits the facts of Stanford and which recognizes both local and
over-all interests. Feeling that any one basis of classification would be
inadequate, the Committee has recommended that the student body be
classified in two ways: by class in the University, and by, not living
groups, but types of living groups.
This set-up comes much closer to providing effective and equal repre
sentation than does the present jerry-built arrangement. That the off
campus district has only one member is balanced by the fact that each
off-campus student con vote in the election of a member on a class basis.
No longer will about 1,000 on-campus women elect four members and
some 2,000 Village residents elect two members—or some 3.000 off-campus
students two members. (To justify giving 1.000 women in campus resi

obviously not all of these are suitable voting subdivisions. One propo
sition before the Constitution Committee was that students be classified
by living group—that is. that each living group elect a representative u>
Excom. This might work if all living groups were the same size, but
they are not. Besides, the off-campus students —some 3.000 strong —have
no living groups at 511. Another defect in a pure living-group represen
tation plan is this—a member chosen from a small cohesive group and in
intimate contact with that group and no other would only be the agent
and delegate of that group.
This, in my opinion, is undesirable. Excom members should not be
representatives of any particular group or organization; each should
attempt to think in terms of the welfare and interests of the whole student
body. Bluntly, Excom members should vote in line with their own good
judgment and not as a particular organization instructs them. Besides,
the ASSU is not a federation of subordinate groups with layer on layer,
echelon on echelon, between students and Excom; every student is a
member of the Associated Students in his or her own right. He or she is
entitled to express an opion whether Toyon Council or Roble Senate
approve it or not.
After many hours of discussion, the Constitution Committee adopted
the plan presented in Art. 111, Sec. 3 of the proposed new constitution, a
plan which fits the facts of Stanford and which recognizes both local and
over-all interests. Feeling that any one basis of classification would be
inadequate, the Committee has recommended that the student body be
classified in two ways: by class in the University, and by, not living
groups, but types of living groups.
This set-up comes much closer to providing effective and equal repre
sentation than does the present jerry-built arrangement. That the off
campus district has only one member is balanced by the fact that each
off-campus student con vote in the election of a member on a class basis.
No longer will about 1,000 on-campus women elect four members and
some 2,000 Village residents elect two members—or some 3.000 off-campus
students two members. (To justify giving 1.000 women in campus resi
dences as many representatives as 5,000 other students, one would have to
assume that the contribution of the residents of Roble, Lagunita, etc., was
five times as. valuable and significant as that of Village and off-campus
residents—which I doubt.)
The letter in Friday's Daily from Misses Morgan. Radalj, Gavin, and
Hodges presents several objections to the committee's plan. In general,
they seem to visualize Excom members taking every issue back to some
other group, a house, a corridor, a class excom, or an area excom, and
bringing back the decision of that group to the ASSU Excom. I under
stand that the Excom members from Roble and Lagunita try to do this
at the present time. I gather from Friday's letter that this is advocated
as the ideal plan for the whole campus, and that the committee's proposal
is criticized fov not making this compulsory or at least easy. In my opinion,
the committee had no intention of encouraging any such continual trotting
back and forth from meeting to meeting.
In the first place, the whole student body, not a group of organiza
tions, is supposed to he represented on Excom. In the second place, Excom
members are presumed to be, if not smarter, at least not less intelligent
than the average student. They can and should think for themselves, and
riot let a class excom or a house or corridor meeting do it for them.
This custom of referring everything back to the group may be thought
desirable in Roble, Lagunita, and one of two other large halls or units.
But it is just not workable for many of the present Excom districts and
is certainly not the practice of all Excom members. I don't believe the
committee had any idea of imposing such a practice as an integral part
of their plan on the whole student body, and I do not think that any plan
based on this "Roble" theory of representation should be adopted. 1 don't
insist that the whole new constitution is pcrfect. but I heartily endorse the
committee's plan for double-barrelled Excom representation.
