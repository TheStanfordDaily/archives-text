# ERP Plan Might Fail In Five Areas
## 
### DANIEL DE LUCE 
PARIS. APRIL 17 (/Pi.â€”The Eu
ropean Recovery Program risks
failure in five of the 19 areas which
it is trying to make self-supporting.
Presumably the program will be
continued to mid-1952 by the U.S.
Congress and will cost the Ameri
can treasury up to 17 billion dollars.
But its hopes for general Euro
pean self - sufficiency three years
from now are jeopardized in these
specific cases:
Western Germany, which is
counted as two areas: the French
zone and the U.S.-British bizone.
Greece, a victim of Communist
rebellion.
Austria, still occupied by four
foreign powers although orw paper a
"liberated nation."
The Free Territory of Trieste, a
helpless politico - economic freak
which was carved from the north
eastern extremity of Italy by the
Big Four in 194G to satisfy Russia
and Yugoslavia.
The European Recovery program
is controlled by the Economic Co
operation Administration, a zealous
American governmental agency with
a high proportion of practical busi
nessmen.
The ECA rlid not choose the areas
in which it would be obliged to
operate. American foreign policy, as
interpreted by the Congress and
State Department, marked them
out.
That's why China, a country not
even in Europe, was also dumped in
ECA's lap.
In all of Europe, Western Ger
many is the worst hornet's nest of
disputes between the United States
and her foremost allies, Britain and
France. The ECA, mixing in, has
already been stung.
ECA, because that is its mission,
views Western Germany as an eco
nomic problem. But it is one in
which political and military prob
lems inevitably overshadow any
thing economic.
