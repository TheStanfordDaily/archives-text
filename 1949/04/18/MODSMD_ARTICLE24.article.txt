## Bull Session 
### 
One of the girls I know and sometimes date around campus is Dum Dum
Davenport. Dum Dum lives in Casa Ratio and has two close close friends.
T. S. Lilicnthal and Moo Moo Monroe. Someday I hope to meet a girl
named Mary, again.
Fate brought Dum Dum and me together on a blind date, and at oncc
we found something in common. Both of us felt we had been stuck. 1
have a ready remedy for such situationsâ€”just by removing my glasses.
Dum Dum was transformed into a rather indefinite and not unpleasant
blur.
For all I knew, she might have been Linn Turner. Lana has gained
weight, you know. Dum Dum has a solution for these problems, too. She
parlayed a forged ID card and a five dollar bill (mine) into enough drinks
to render me more acceptable in her somew r hat dimmed eyes. For all she
knew, I might have been Peter Lorre.
At any rate, familiarity soon mellowed contempt into indifference, and
Dum Dum has been gind about fitting me into her date schedule.
In fact, it is possible that Dum Dum is even beginning to care a little
despite our widely varying backgrounds. This is democracy, I guess.
Her father is a rich and powerful manufacturer. In addition, he rents the
Hoover Tower binocular concession to Bill Dailey.
One day, I was telling Dum Dum several of the strange personnel poli
cies of a large manufacturing and distributing firm that employed me
for a while. The petty injustices, humorously related, were insignificant,
but Dum Dum has led a sheltered, somewhat idealistic life, and was a
little shocked. There was no reason, of course, but somehow she felt a
need to speak for her own.
"My Daddy," she said reaching over and patting my hand reassuringly,
"never exploited any workers."
