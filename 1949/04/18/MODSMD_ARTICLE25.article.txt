## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Oliver J. Carter, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Commit
tee of California, will speak this
evening at the Palo Alto Commu
nity Center at 8 o'clock.
At this free public meeting Car
ter's speech plus any well-conceived
questions from audience members
could very well give the spectator
a feeling or a growing awareness
for the truer political realities as
they exist in California.
Carter, 38-year-old state Demo
cratic leader, is a former state Sen
ator, a Stanford alumnus, a grad
uate of Hastings Law College, and
a former deputy district attorney of
Redding.
He specialized in forestry and fish
and game problems and in develop
ment of California's water resources
when he served in the state Legis
lature till 1944.
Carter accepted the chairmanship
of the Democratic State Central

Committee in 1948. In 1950 the
chairman is to come from Southern
California.
The forthcoming 1950 election al
ready has started the Democratic
party hopefuls to assume the stances
of lightning rods — hoping to he
struck by the political lightning.
Some observers believe that they
discern a rod - like repose when
Carter makes his social and public
appearances. In other words there
is a possibility that Carter is feel
ing out the political possibilities of
running for the Democratic choice
for gubernatorial candidate in the
next elections.
If this is true, he will be facing
the strengthening James Roosevelt
movement emanating from South
ern California.
Perhaps Carter will shed, directly
or indirectly, some light on the
forthcoming race which is over one
full year away but which is shaping
up already.
