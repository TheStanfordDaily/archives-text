# Horror, Comedy, Fear Gripped Students Is 1906 Earthquake Shattered Stanford
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
Dawn was just breaking over
ae East Bay hills on the morn
rig of April 18, 1906, as a
leepy and somewhat inebri
ted resident of the Chi Psi
xlge, clad in full dress suit, made
is w;iy to the second floor of the
esidence and flopped down on an
mpty bed. Suddenly, the whole
ouse shook violently and seemed
) give way, but the rough attrib
ted the feeling to his condition,
nd when all seemed righted once
lore, dozed off to sleep.
But throughout the campus, pan
r-stricken sleepers took the shak
\g and uproar for what it was—an
arthquake.
Within 47 seconds, sleepers were
irown from their beds, chimneys
>ppled, and floors caved in. Terror
lied the students sleeping in En
ina. Roble, and houses on the How.
,t Encina, the first shock brought
X) scantily clad men into the eorri
ors in a mad rush for safety, with
tiling bricks and plaster pouring
own upon them.
Chimney Falls
An ornamental chimney fell
irough the roof and carried the
lird floor through to the basement.
. student leaped from a fourth
oor window but went up instead
112 down, grasping the eaves so he
juld be on top when the building
il lapsed.
All over the campus, the bed
ound dove under the covers as
ricks assaulted their beds. Hardly
chimney was left standing.
When the rumbling and bouncing
?ased, the rush began for the out
de. One Robleite glanced across
er room to find that her roommate
ad disappeared, bed and all. Call
lg frantically, she was answered
om the parlor below where her
tommate, still in bed. had landed
hen the floor collapsed. Hanging
recariously above her was a huge
-anite stone.

Attention was soon shifted to En
cina, where four men had been car
ried to the basement by the chim
ney. Rescue operations began im
mediately, and two men were found
crouched beneath crossed timbers,
which had saved them from being
crushed. A thini student, delirious,
was extracted from the wreckage.
Digging on. rescuers came upon the
battered body of Junius R. Hanna.
08, of Bradford, Pa., one of the two
to die from the quake on the cam
pus.
Meanwhile. a human chain
stretched out a top-floor window to

rescue the student hanging from the ;
roof.
Outside the Chi Psi house, terror |
left the on'ookers, replaced by
amusement. The house had sunk so j
that the second story rested on the •
ground. At a second-story window
the well-dressed brother who had !
spent the previous evening cele- I
brating appeared and said to his
pajama-clad brethren, "What's up, (
fellows?"
They called to him to step out the .
window, and carefully the bewil- 1
dered Chi Psi eased himself to the ]
ground two feet below. Tho inci- !
dent relieved the tension-

One girl even deckled to take her
morning bath, and was amazed to
find the water already drawn. It
was not until later that she learned
it was the house's emergency drink
ing supply.
Rumors Spread
Rumors flew around the campus.
The first one, which circulated soon
after the temblor, said that Encina
had tumbled. Later, tales made the
rounds that Manhattan was under
water, Santa Barbara was destroyed
by a tidal wave, and Chicago was in
ruins.
Meanwhile, Stanford was the sub
ject of rumors on the outside. The
AP set the damage at $4,000,000 (it
was about half that), while an Oak
land paper said the University was
completely demolished. The an
nouncement sent friends and alum
ni rushing to the scene with aid.
Lunatic Scare
San Jose papers reported to the
campus that Agnew State Insane
Asylum had collapsed and 200 luna
tics were at large 15 miles from
Stanford.
The Roble girls were guarded
from possible "lunatics" by a ring
of men led by "Babe" Crawford, a
sturdy football hero. Slight tremors
were noticed between 15 p.m. and
midnight, but no severe shocks oc
curred.
A group of professors, bearing
hundreds of telegrams, traveled by
auto to Sacramento before they

found a telegraph station that would
take their messages. Even there,
the messages were sent by rail to
Reno, where the facilities were less
jammed.
The following day brought sun
shine and no further tremors. The
last of the fearful were forced to
move inside two days later when
it began to rain, and many had al
ready started for home.
