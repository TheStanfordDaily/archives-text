Moot Court is a program for
training in court practice. The con
testants go through all the proce
dures of a regular court of law,
writing and filing briefs and pre
senting oral arguments before a
bench of three judges.
Due to the outstanding success of
the student judges in the first
round, the bench for the semifinals
will for the first time also include
two students. Each case is to be
heard by two student judges and a

practicing attorney from the Bay
Area.
A!so for the first time. Moot Court
Board has drawn lip the problems
to be argued almost entirely inde
pendently of faculty supervision.
