# Frosh Sweep Three From Cat
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Continuing their year-long dom
i inance over rival Cal, the Stanford
freshmen again shut out the Cubs
in Saturday s battles. The Papooses
won the ball game, 6-4, white
washed the netters, 9-0, and hum
bled the Cub swimmers in their
own pool, 50-25.
In a game that could easily be
called a "comedy of errors," the
Cal frosh outmutfed the home team
G to 4. giving the local freshmen
the deciding margin. Everything
| from two runners on one base to
outfielders getting their cleats

caught in the turf, with all the
normal errors tossed in between,
unraveled on the freshman dia
-1 mond.
Assures Scries Win
The victpry did assure the Class
of 52 of tlie first series win over a
California freshman nine since 1!)38.

4-3 contet over the Cubs.

"Hambone" Hamilton looked good
on the mound. His blazing fast ball
that came down at a terrific angle
to the unusually small opponents
I baffled batters all morning iong.

fourth—Stanford went ahead with

i more Berkeley bungles to dri
i across two runs.
