# 'Whites' Down 'Reds' in Scrum
## 
### 
Maybe it was because of the 1941
white Rose Bow! jerseys that they
were wearing, or maybe it was due
to a greater amount of fight, ability,
and determination, but whatever
the cause, the "Whites" thoroughly
beat the "Reds" in Saturday's foot
ball scrimmage.
Made up for the most part of
freshmen, the first - string White
team piled up a 21 to 0 advantage
over the Reds, a team made up
mostly of last year's veteran play
ers.
While it makes little difference to
Stanfordites in general which team
won the intrasquad scrum, the
showing of the Whites came as a
surprise to most of the estimated
crowd of over 800.
Reds Unable to Move
The admittedly '"loaded" Reds
could not seem to get started but
the Whites, under the brilliant lead
ership of quarterback Gary Ker
koian, more than made up for the
ineptness of the Reds with a spar
kling aerial display.
Passes from Kerkorian to end
Bruce Van Alstyne and halfback
Harry Hugasian moved the ball
downfield at regular intervals and
twice these marches ended with
touchdown tosses to these two re
ceivers.
The third marker came by way
of Kerkorian's delayed 27 - yard
"keep it" that ended with the tal
ented quarterback lateraling to Hu
gasian. who went over to score.
Kerkorian kicked all three conver
sions.
While it was a predominantly
frosh team that started for the
Whites, it was the defensive work
of such upperclassmen as Mickey
Titus. Ken Peck. Holy Boruck, and
John Rosekrans that held the Red
team to but small ground gains.
