and the mile relay team of Ken
Payson, Wally McCamant, Frank
DaWson, and Nelson Judah.
Distanceman Barry, normally a
two-miler, filled in for Wooley in
the mile, winning in 4:43. Without
another lunger on the squad, the
frosh were forced to forfeit the t wo
rn i'e event, giving Stockton the
winning margin.
