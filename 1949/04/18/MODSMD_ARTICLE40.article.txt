# Hayniemen Nip Bears, 40-35
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team out
: splashed Cal's mermen, 40-35, at
| Berkeley Saturday, but the victory
I was one of the closest in the entire
I string of 38 consecutive wins which
J Tom Haynie's tankmen have now
i run up.
| Rapid Ralph Sala was declared
! eligible for varsity competition just
prior to the meet and displayed his
i appreciation by winning both the
I 220- and 440-yard freestyle events.
But honors for the outstanding
| nerformance of the day went to the !
Cards' Jack Weeden, who back
stroked the first 100 yards of the
300-yard medley relay in 1:01. 0 to
shave a full second oft' the existing
I pool record.
Indians Disqualified
Actually, the match wasn't as
close as the score would indicate. |
During the running of the 400 relay, j
the final event on the card, Indian
j anchor-man Woody Hoogs' plunge j
into the pool was declared prema- j
( ture by the judges; and although
Hoogs finished the event ahead of
Cal's Don Fisher, the race was
awarded to the Bears on a loul.
Fisher, incidentally, equaled Sala's ;
double - win effort by taking top
i honors in both the 50 and 100-yard
sprint affairs. His times of 24.2 and
1 55 flat, howeevr, were slower than :
his previous best efforts for the
1 events.
Jack Weeden won the 150-yard
! backstroke to become the only i
Stanford entry besides Sala to score i
a first place in individual compe
tition.
Hoogs, Hester Co-Captains
j After the Cal conquest, the mer
! men elected Woody Hoogs and Don i
Hester co-captains for the present
season.
This Friday the Hayniemen will ;
i be seen in action at the Encina pools '
against USC's wimming team which ;
has been called the greatest in Tro- j
jan history.
