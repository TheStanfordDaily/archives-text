# Card Nine Loses to Cal; Skids to Third in CIBA
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
The horsehiding Stanford Indians,
substantial of bat but weak of pitch,
are today looking around for a
chucker who can last more than five
innings. With half the season bo
hind them, the Cards have yet to
come up with a pitcher who is ca
pable of going the full nine-frame
route.
Lefty Dave Dahle. who turned the
trick against the University of Cali
fornia once this season, couldn't re
peat Saturday as the Cal batsmen
.-helled Dahle and his successor Jim
Claypool for 13 hits and a 9 to 5
decision.
The loss scuttled Card hopes for
their first baseball sweep over Cali
fornia in decades, and put the slip
ping Indians down into a tie for
third in the CIBA standings.
Cards Blow Up
Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford
nine spotted the Bears four runs in
the first inning, made it all back in
the second and third, but then blew
up in the last frames to hand the
Bears their first conference win in
the last four starts.
Slim right-hander Dave Ander
son, making his first CIBA start of
the season, went the full distance
and was credited with the win. An
derson gave up 11 hits, but scat
tered them well, and was seldom in
trouble after the third inning.
Dahle retired the first two men

to face him in the first inning, but
had plenty of trouble taking care of
the third one and it was five singles
and a walk later that the square
jawed left-hander stalked oft the
hill behind in the ball game 4 to 0.
Frisians Take Lead
The Cards tied it up and went
ahead 5 to 4 with rallies in the sec
ond and thi: J, but couldn't hold the
lead. The easy-throwing Anderson,
without bothering to put too much
on tiie ball, became more effective
as the game progressed, while his
teammates jumped on Dahle and
rangy Jim Claypool for two runs in
the filth, two more in the eighth,
and a final one in the ninth.
The Bears put it away for keeps
in the eighth on a combination of
base hits and physical and mental
Stanford errors.
Shortstop Don Monroe beat out a
bunt to the catcher and came home
on Tim Cronin's long double into
deep left center. Cronin legged it
to third as centerfielder Charlie
Cole pulled a juggling act and was
safe on a close play.
Cronin Walks Home
Third - sacker Bill Arce swung
into a heated argument with the
base umpire but forgot to call time,
so Cronin picked himself up and
walked home untouched.
Bob Nava, with a triple and a
single in four trips, and Dave Mel
ton, with a perfect four tor four,
paced the Card attack.
Melton's single in the eighth was
probably the longest one-base blow
ever hit in the Sunken Diamond.
The ball bounced off the top of the
leit field fence out by the ,T4>o-foot
mark and played perfectly into the
hands of left fielder Jim Howe, who
held Melton on first.
