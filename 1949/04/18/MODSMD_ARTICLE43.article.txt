# Thousands Hear Amphitheater Easter Service
## 
### 
A large number of students and
visitors crowded Frost Amphitheater
yesterday morning to attend one of
the most impressive Easter services
in Stanford history. Many of the lis
teners were not present in the out
door bowl, for the NBC radio net
work carried the music and worship
service to the radio audience
throughout the nation.
A feature of the half-hour broad
cast was the Easter message by Dr.
J. Wallace Sterling, president of
Stanford. He mentioned the chal
lenge to the individual "to measure
his accomplishments against his op
portunities and responsibilities."
He said that at this Easter season
there was a need for everyone to
do some stock-taking of the prob
lems caused by public turbulence
and differences in the national com
munity.

The program also included 120
musicians and speakers who pre
sented sacred anthems, readings,
and instrumental compositions.
The University Choir, under the
direction of Harold C. Schmidt,
sang two beautiful A Cappella an
thems and a Bach chorale accom
panied by the brass choir.
The latter group, composed of 40
members of the concert band, was
conducted by Julius Shuchat. They
provided the music for all the
hymns, musical interludes, and a
beautiful fanfare which opened the
radio program with a triumphant
flourish. The brass ensemble also
played a Gabrielli double-choir se
lection written especially for out
uuors,
Standing on the upper rim of the
amphitheater was the 30-voice verse
choir, trained by Helene Blattner.

The Easter story was told by the
choir and numerous soloists.
Visitors started filing into the
dew-covered amphitheater by 8 a.m.
carrying blankets and attired in col
orful Easter dresses and hats. When
the broadcast commenced half an
hour later, the sun was showing
over the green hillside and the stage
was set tor the beautiful service.
