# Two Found Guilty Of Indecency
## 
### 
Men's Council, in a special Fri
day meeting, found two students
guilty of indecent exposure. Coun
cil suspended one of the students
from the University for one quar
ter and sentenced the other to 50
hours of work at the Stanford Con
valescent Home.
Both students pleaded guilty to
charges of running along Stanford
residential streets last Wednesday
in what Council deemed tu be in
sufficient clothing. They testified
that their actions were prompted by
$25 bets.
One defendant's offense occurred
at 12:15 in the morning. He testi
fied that it was very dark, and that
he was to be warned of any cars
in order to avoid being illuminated
by headlights.
He said that he did know that
residences along the way had been
notified of the bet. and that he
took the chance believing that dark
ness would prevent his being seen
clearly if at all. He received a sen
tence of 50 hours' work at the
Convalescent Home.
The other defendant's oflense,
however, took place at 6:15 p.m.
"He could have had no doubts
that he could be seen clearly
by anyone in the vicinity," said
Bob Anderson. Council chairman.
"Therefore, the moral offense and
the possible injury to the reputation
of the University and its students
resulting from his action were more
evident."
It was on the basis of this differ
ence between the two offenses that
Council differentiated between the
penalties and suspended the second
defendant from the University for
one quarter.
"These cases were serious both
to society as moral offenses, and to
the interests of the University and
its students in maintaining their in
tegrity," Anderson continued.
"In order to determine the rela
tive severity of these offenses.
Council was guided by two criteria
â€”the extent of the injury to society,
and the extent of the injury to the
special interests of the University
and its students."
"There is no prescribed limit for
penalties under the present consti
tution," Anderson continued, "and
Council therefore must judge each
case by considering the particular
offense and the circumstances in
volved, and set some penalty within
the wide range up to and including
exDulsion from the University.
"The ASSU Constitution states,
"Students are expected to show both
within and without the University
such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for expulsion from
the University.'"
Anderson. Fred Cumminjrs, Bob
Setrakian. Jack Barnes, and How
ard Lewis were present.
