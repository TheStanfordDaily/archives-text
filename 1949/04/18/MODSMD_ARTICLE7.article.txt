GAY BRYAN, versatile Stanford
track man, put on one of greatest
individual track performances in
cinder history Saturday, when he
took four first places and another
second against San Jose State, to
personally score 23 points.
Led by Gay Bryan, who personally scored 23 points, Stan
ford's undefeated track team rolled up another big victory las:
Saturday when they crushed a game but outclassed San Jose
State squad 90 1 3 to 40 2 3, at Stanford Stadium.
Although Gay Bryan's performance was probably one of the

greatest individual achievements ir
track history, the rest of the squad
performed admirably, limiting tht.
Spartans to a mere three first places
in 15 events.
Four First Places
Bryan chalked up four first places,
the 100, the 220, the low hurdles,
and the broad jump, while placing
second to the Spartans' Mel Mar
tin in the high jump.
Left at the blocks in all thre
winning races, Bryan more thar
made up the difference with lii;
powerful, easy-going stride.
The day started off in grand style
for the Indians, when StanfordV
one-two shot put punch, Otis Chan
dler and Lou Davis, easily took
first and second places, respectively.
Chandler's 55 foot inch tos.-
and Davis' 54 foot 4Va inch throw,
marked the first time that two mei
from the same school threw over 54
feet in the same meet.
Spartan Woody Linn, better
known for his efforts in the discus,
grabbed the third spot in the shot
with a heave of 50 feet 9 inches.
Cards Lead From Start
From the first event on, the Cards
were never headed. Usually weak
in the track events, the Indians took
every single running contest from
the Staters.
Only Spartan wins in the high
jump, the pole vault, and the discus
prevented Coach Jack Weiershaus
er's cindermen from sweeping every
event.
Stanford's ace javelin thrower.
Bud Held, continued his record
breaking performances when he
heaved the stick 225 feet BV4 inches
for a new all-time Stanford record
Placing first in the high hurdles,
and second to Gay Bryan in the
lows, meet captain Downing McKee
showed excellent form in both races.
The 190-pound Card ace bested
teammate Skip Kent by a full three
ds in the highs, with a good win
ig time of 14.6.
