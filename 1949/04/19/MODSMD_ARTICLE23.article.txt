## 
### 
Veterans who were California
residents when they entered
the service are eligible for edu
cational aid from the California
Veterans Educational Program,
Robert L. Sanders, field repre
sentative for the program, said
yesterday.
Any California veteran who
served over !)0 days active duty be
tween Dec. 7, IIJ4I, and Jan. 1. 1!)47,
;nd received an honorable dis
charge, may receive up to $1,000
from the state to help further his
education. 1h is amount may be
used for tuition, books, supplies, and
lees together with a $40 monthly al
lowance.
Sanders emphasized the $1,000
limit to the benefits. He added that
it is usually to the veteran's interest
to use his federal aid, GI Bill, be
fore the state aid.
However, in special cases the vet
eran may be allowed to take the
state aid first if satisfactory expla
nation has been made to a field rep
resentative.
With some skimping the $1,000
can be stretched to cover three
quarters at Stanford. Almost 200
veterans are now benefiting from
this program here.
Application for a certificate of eli

gibility should be made as soon as )
possible, even if assistance is not
immediately desired.
Interested veterans may obtain
application blanks from Mis. Ghetta
Kelly in Temporary Building C,
room 40; or from Sanders at,2l2S)
Grove Street, Oakland.
