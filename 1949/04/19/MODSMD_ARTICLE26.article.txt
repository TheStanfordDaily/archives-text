jty without reference to teaching |

on probation of University of Wash- j
| ington professors and the firing of j
jan Oregon State College faculty ;
j member.
The committee declared that "the |
i only basis for punitive action in the
I college community should be clear
| proof of the deliberate actions of
] individuals in question . . . we de
| clare our strong belief that mere
| membership in an association or or- !
! ganization is no basis- for punitive |
| academic actions."
Richard Hcggic. NSA vice-presi- j
dent for student life, stated that "we |
recognize that Communism is a po- j
litical doctrine subversive of our i
| democratic institutions and specifi- !
J cally of free education, but we be- j
j lieve that the way to meet Com- :
1 inunism is not to allow fear and j
hysteria to dictate our actions, but |
rather to put our faith in the demo- j
cratic institutions which we wish ;
; to protect."
