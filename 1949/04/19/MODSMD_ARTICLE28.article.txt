## Not for Us...

A month ago, Stanford Purchasing Agent Philip G. Duffy, in
J935 the managing editor of The Daily, sent us a University of
Chicago clipsheet containing the story of their present athletic
program. We wrote Chicago Maroon Editor David Broder for
details of the system as the students viewed it.
We regard athletics as an integral part of university training—
as important as student government and academic studies. A
good sports program unifies the student body; boosts morale;
provides extracurricular activity; and brings student, adminis-
Iration, and alumni relations to a common fore.
Contemporary sports policies in universities have been healthy
—their emphasis has been strengthened, and participation has
been increased. Athletes having low scholarship has been
averted by some collegiate policies, such as Stanford's, by in
sisting on definite scholarship prerequisites.
We believe that the University c£ Chicago went too far to the
extreme in order to "maintain" academic standards. Students
End officials both claim that more student participation has been
made possible under Chicago's intramural program. In addition,
ihey say, the university still participates in intercollegiate sports,
and that their academic standards have not been lowered.
Frankly speaking, the Chicago program should remain unique
with that university —it is not for us. Here are our reasons from
a Western point of view:
1. Many Western universities already have strong intramural
sports programs managed by the students. In addition, the
Western universities participate in well-balanced conference
schedules.
2. Intercollegiate programs throughout the country instilled
ihe meaning of team spirit and support on the part of both ath
letes and non-participating students.
3. Scholastic levels at Stanford have not been lowered to allow
athletic men to enter the University. And, yet our teams have
been improving every year since the end of the war.
4. In addition to intramural and intercollegiate sports, Farm
men must take two years of physical education while they are
lower division students.
5. Key sport to the entire sports program of any university is
football. Chicago has dropped the game under their revised
Ethletic policy. In so doing, the school has disposed of the stu
dents' favorite conference game—a game that does the most to
unify all phases of school life.
