## Bull Session

There are many things in this country, such as hot dogs, cowboys, etc..
which over the years have come to be recognized as "American Insti
tutions." These items are not to be confused with such other things as
marriage, which is often called a fine institution. (But who wants to wind

up in on institution?)
What I'm talking about this morning are the things
which have come to be known as peculiar to America
and no other place. And if this list were brought up
to date, not even a Cal man would consider the list
to be complete without the addition of that latest
and flashiest part of American culture, the drive-in
restaurant.

I f. uess there are some fairly nice Drive-ins around
Stanford. My friends tell me that most of them have

some pretty good stulT. I understand they also serve food.
I stopped at a drive-in the othe night and tried to find something
tempting on the menu. The quail looked good, but she was wearing a wed
ding ring.

One of my favorite car-hops lost her job the other night. I was sorry to
see her fired because she was a good worker. Besides waiting on all the
cars, she was in charge of stomping on the grapes for the grape-ades. She
was fired because the boss caught her sitting' down on the job.

Another tiling that drive-in proprietors don't like is to have the cus
at night and have the drive-in send iood to you via taxi. I called up the
other night and asked them to have some wild duck sent out. They guy on
the phone said they didn't have any wild duck, but that they would be
happy to take a tame one and irritate it for me.
Some of those waitresses are very intelligent girls. I got one last week
who said she never had to ask the customers whether they wanted their
entrees cookd rare, medium, or well done. She claimed that she could
tell by looking at the diners which way they should have their food done.
She brought out my ham half-baked.

If you're planning to go to a drive-in soon, here are a few tips for you:
Never go with a fraternity brother. Every time I do. I end up by pick
ing up the check while he is picking up the waitress.
Never order soup or hash at a drive-in. If you order both, you probably
won't be able to tell them apart. The only difference is that the soup is a
little looser.

Ode to a Drive-In:
if the car-hops all wear slacks
Which fit them just like gunny sacks,
That's a drive-in.
If the Ford V-8 is fixed with "skirts,"
And loaded up with high school squirts.
That's a drive-in.
And if the Farm boy orders beer,
And tells the waitress, "Serve me, dear."
And then gets caught by 8.0. E.
Fer gosh sakes, bail me out, that's me!
