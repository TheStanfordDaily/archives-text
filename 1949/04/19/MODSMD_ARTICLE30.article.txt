(Editor's Note: The following
st«»rv on the sports program at the
University of Chicago is a con-
I den sat ion of five concurrent fea
tures printed in the Chicago Daily
News last December. See today's
editorial for Daily continent.)
j "What has happened to .sports at
the University of Chicago since
football got the boot in 1939?
"The general notion is that the
youngsters at the university nowa
days get little exercise other than
to lug the weighty works of Plato
: and Aristotle to and from class.
"IJist tile facts are otherwise:
There are more Maroon team;, tak
ing the field today than ever be
fore. and in more sports.
" 'Not more men out, not bigger
squads.' Director of Athletics T.
Nelson Metcalf emphasized, 'but
n ore teams in more sports.'
"A summary of sports shows Chi
cago strong in individual sports
(wrestling, gymnastics, fencing, etc.)
i and weak in those sports that rc
j quire big squads undergoing inten
j live training and long practice ses
! sions as a team.
"Sports, then, are not 'de-empha
: sized' at Chicago, but the nature of
the university, the prior claims of
1 elasswork and study, has resulted in
i excellence chiefly in individual
i sports.
"'Part of our problem in team
sports,' Metcalf admits, 'is finding
our own level of competition.'
"Football, of course, is gone. In
baseball and basketball, where play
! as a team is essential to success, the
Maroon is struggling with a prob
lem.
"The university,—in dropping out
of the Big Ten, freed itself from
! unbalanced competition for its
teams and gained complete flexi
bility in scheduling games.
( " 'Quite frankly,' Metcalf revealed,
| 'we try to schedule half of our
| games against teams our boys have
| a good chance of defeating and half
• against teams they'll have to go
i some to beat.'
! "What does the sports program at
I the University of Chicago today fi
nally add up to?
"Metcalf sums it up this way:
"it is simply reversing the situa
tion where the majority sit in the
stands and watch the few play, by
! making sports a means for all stu
dents to take part, to keep fit. and
to have fun.'
"The program attempts to provide,
in addition to major sports, the in
dividual student's own special in
terest, from acrobatics to yachting.
"This emphasis on participation by
all who are interested helps to ex
plain why, at a Maroon basketball
game, there are sometimes nearly as
many players on the bench and un
, the court as there are fans in the
J stands.
"When all is said and done, the
| sports program at the University of
Chicago is unique because the school
I is that way ,too.
"Junior varsity teams, playing
1 against high school competition, ex
ist because the college of the uni
versity admits students after two
i yea is of high school.
"Maroon teams, by and large, are
| strong in sports where the indi
i vidual, as an individual, counts be
cause the emphasis in the univer
sity classroom is on the individual
! development of the students.
"The university is an international
center of learning. Students from
around the world participate in
| Maroon sports.
"Sports at Chicago make no
! money, since their purpose is not to
j entertain spectators but to provide
1 recreation. At most sports contests
I at Chicago, no admission is charged.
" 'Our sports budget for men at
, the University,' says Metcalf, 'is
! $13(1,000 a year for instruction, scrv
i ice and equipment, supplies and ex
j ponscs."
