As the Students See It ... .
(Editor's Note: Early this quarter a letter was sent to the editor of
The Chicago Maroon at the University of Chicago. We wanted to know
what the student thought of the university's new athletic program. We
wrote that such a program would not fit Stanford's environment be
cause we maintain both an active intramural program and a well
rounded intercollegiate program. Following are excerpts from Maroon
Editor David Broder's letter.)

Dear Mr. Lokey:
I can't tell you how pleased I was by your letter asking for information
before you wrote an editorial. It is rare these days that editors, col
legiate or otherwise, take time to get the facts before they sound off.
First, some facts:
Chicago like most colleges, recognizes the value of a big intramural
program, and one has been set up. Chicago also recognizes that some
students are more at home on the intercollegiate level than on the intra
mural level. For that reason, they sponsor varsity and junior varsity teams
ii all major sports, except football.
Why not football?
First, you might be interested to know that Dr. Hutchins is on record
as favoring football—' when it can be played as Chicago plays any other
varsity sport—without subsidization.
But the Big Ten Conference, to which Chicago belonged for many years
permitted and encouraged various forms of subsidization of football. Dr.
Hutchins simply refused to lower the educational bars for some of the
hulking dolts willing alumni packed oil to the old alma mater.
When subsidization was discontinued, Chicago began to lose, and every
body became disgusted—including the Big Ten, who could not understand
our "peculiar attitude."
Today, the feeling against subsidization is such that Chicago cannot
even participate in some of the lesser football leagues in the Midwest.
Chicago's autumn quarter begins in the first week of October.
To schedule any other college, training of the squad would have to
begin at least a month earlier. The school will not put up the money ;o
house and feed the footballers for that month of training. Thus, no foot
ball team.
I do not. know how to evaluate the effect of the de-emphasis of varsity
sports and the removal of football, since I have never attended a college
that had a different policy.
The basketball team draws fair crowds (about 25 per cent of the enroll
ment), but I think, in general, there is little interest in varsity athletics
compared with what you might find at Northwestern or Michigan.
'I hat this has affected the "spirit" at Chicago is undeniable. But the im
portance of athletically-engendered "spirit" to a university is something
you'll have to evaluate for yourself. v
There is a small, but not too vocal, group of students who complain
about the absence of football on the campus. But you should remember
that three-fourths of Chicago's enrollment is on the graduate level. Most
of these students are serious about the intellectual pursuits and give
little time or thought to extracurricular activities.
You say that sports do not take more time than several of the big jobs
in campus publications, student governments, and so on. With this, 1
would agree, but at Chicago there is difficulty in even finding people to
take on jobs such as those you've mentioned.
Finally, the point about individual sports as compared with team sports.
As I've pointed out, Chicago has intercollegiate team sports in every
thing but football, so there is certainly no policy against team sports.
The fact that Chicago docs better in individual sports—fencing, tennis,
gymnastics—than it does in team sports like basketball or baseball, can
be traced to the relatively larger amount of time that is needed to coor
dinate team efforts—time that most students cannot afford to give to
athletics.
For example, the schedule of the center of this year's basketball team
allowed him to practice with the rest of the team only one day a week.
You can imagine what that did to the caliber of team play.
Chicago has made a real effort, I believe, to provide athletic oppor
tunities wherever students showed interest. Thus, two years ago. there
was a schedule of inter-dormitory play in tackle football, but when tew
boys came out to play, the plan was dropped.
Whether we have skimped on athletics or underrated its value is.some
thing you can decide better than I.
