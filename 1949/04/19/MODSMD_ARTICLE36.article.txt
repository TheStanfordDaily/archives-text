"The lake will not eo down!"
These words were beine muttered
by co-chairmen of the Junior Wa
ter Carnival Allen Bletz and Diane
Porter in defiance of the ten million
gallons lost last week. No changes
in the carnival plans have been
made and none are anticipated, they
said.
"The last day to .' inn up your float
idea for ihe parade will be Satur
day, said Dave Bertrand, float
chairman. Mimeographed instruc
tions for construction of floats will
be available Wednesday at the AS
SU office.
Information on events and signing
up for them, added Bletz, will be
released sometime this week. Miss
Porter stated 1 liat all living groups
should make some type of flag rep
resenting their living group so that
it may be hoisted in the event one
of their entries should win a con
test.
