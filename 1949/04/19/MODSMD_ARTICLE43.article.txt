NEW YORK. April 18 (/I I ).â€”The
major league baseball season pot
i off to an upset start today as the
| Philadelphia Phillies whipped the
National League champion Boston
Braves 4-0, and the Washington
Senators set clown the highly re
garded Philadelphia Athletics 3-2.
The Braves and Athletics had
i been established as big favorites to
win their season openers in the
only games on tap today. The re
maining inaugurals are set for to
morrow. The American League
j will see the world champion Cleve
land Indians oppose the Browns in
St. Louis, the Chicago White Sox
play in Detroit, the Boston Red Sox
in Philadelphia, and the Senators in
New York.
In the National it will be the
St. Louis Cardinals in Cincinnati,
j the Pittsburgh Pirates in Chicago,
j Hiid the New York Giants in Brook
| lyn. The Phils and Braves will en
i uage in the traditional Patriots' Day
doubleheader in Boston.
, The original estimated 280,000 at
tendance is due for a sharp drop
: since the weather man predicted
j cold and rainy weather throughout
I the two circuits.
A skimpy 9,195 crowd saw Lefty
Ken Heintzelman ruin Boston's first
National Leagut- flag-raising in 34
| years by pitching the Phils to a
< ,hutout triumph over the Braves in
j cold and wind-swept Braves Field.
To make matters worse lor the
Tribesmen, Johnny Sain, their 24-
j came winning ace of last year, was
the victim of Heintzelman's airtight
; pitching. It was only the fourth
j time the Phils had taken the meas
ure of Boston's star right-hander,
who owns 12 decisions over them.
The 33 - year - old Heintzelman,
who earned the opening day assign
ment by his fine showing in spring
training, limited the Braves to five
hits, three of them by sophomore
shortstop Alvin Dark.
