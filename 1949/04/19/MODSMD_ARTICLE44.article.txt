### 
It's do-or-die week for Stanford's
varsity swimmers, as they prepare I
for a Thursday outing against an
outstanding Fullerton JC tank squad 1
and the all-important Saturday !
meeting against USC'.s highly-touted
splashers.
Both matches are scheduled for
the Encina pools.
Confident Tom Haynie, tTie in
dominablc mentor of the Card tank [
corps, has predicted Stanford vic
tories in both meets; but almost in j
the same breath, Haynie admits that
every one ot his boys will have to :
swim over his head in order to 1
turn the trick against the powerful j
Trojans.
The Fullerton lads will lie led by
Jack Thomas, who has been clocked j
at 2:11).4 in the 220 free-style, and j
Ernie Polte. a breaststroker whose '
best time in the 200-yard breast- |
stroke is 2:28.0.
In addition, the Junior Collegians
boast an excellent four-man relay j
team which has done 3:43 in compe- j
tition this year.
The Trojans' big threat, of course,
will be Wally Wolf, who placed sec
ond in the 220 and fourth in the 440
in this year's National Intercolle
giate Meet.
Wolfe was also a member of the
U.S. 800-meter relay team which set
a world record for the event while '
winning the Olympic championship. |
'lhe Card squad is in top shape
with the exception of a few minor j
colds, and should be raring to go j
in their all-out effort this week.
