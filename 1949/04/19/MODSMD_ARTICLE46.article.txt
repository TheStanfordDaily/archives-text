# Midweek Musings...

### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Six out of eight. That's the soul
satisiying score racked up by Farm
athletes in last weekend's action
packed events.
But the sweetest part of the re
sults of our boys' Easter celebra
tions is the fact that live of said vic
tories were achieved at the expense
of clem dirty Golden Bears. Yessir,
we moidcred da bums; and there arc
some long faces in the shadow of the
Campanile this week.
Cal did manage to preserve some
pride lrom the weekend's ruins
when Clint Evans' nonchalant nine
clowned its way to 9 to 5 win over
at the Sunken Diamond, but the
baseballers' victory was more than
overshadowed by their varsity
losses in the swimming and tennis
festivals, and frosh defeats in swim
ming, tennis, and baseball.

Gay Should lie Hilarious
Needless to say, the lad who pro
vided most of the gaiety for Farm
fans was he of the meaningful
monicker, Gay Bryan. The unbe
lieveable one really put in a day's
work; and about the time he was
preparing lor that final broad jump,
he looked as though he should be
doing his leaping into a mattress
rather than into a sandpit.
He was tired, but doubtless well
satisfied with his afternoon's toil.
For Gay, personally, accounted for
more first placcs than the entire
San Jose team—and almost as many
points.
In fact, if Bryan had been per
forming for the Staters rather than
for Stanford, the Indians would have
won the meet by only three points
instead of 50.
That gives you some idea of the
importance of Gaylord to track
mentor Jack Weiershauser.

The Golden Boy
Stanford's crew of sideline jock
eys, many of whom attended Satur
day's Big Ball Game for the express
purpose of firing verbal barrages at
Jackie (he runs, he kicks, he passes,
lie pitches, he hits, and he makes
love) Jensen, were mightly disap
pointed when it was announced that
Dave Anderson would do the chuck
ing lor the Bears in place of their
headline hero.
Still, although Jensen spent most

i ot the afternoon in right field out
of hooting range of the stands, the
grandstand gagsters were not to be
completely denied.
Each of Jensen's appearances at
the plate signaled the unleashing oi
a shower of abusive witticisms.
Typical comment: Jackie isn't really
i iat—that bulge around the middle
j is where he carries his press clip
i phigs.
i The Golden Boy wasn't completely
oblivious of the jockeying, either.
In the seventh inning he grounded
out short to lirst lor the second out;
and rather than return to the Cal
dug-out, which would have entailed
: walking past the Stanford rooting
section, he chose to park himself on
: the grass along the right-field foul
! line to wait out the rest of the
| inning.
Two Records For Dave
Shortstop Dave Melton, whose
; over-the-fence belt against Santa
I Clara a few weeks back was the
| seventh such in Sunken Diamond
| history, almost turned the trick
again Saturday.
But because his eighth-inning
, blast tailed to clear the fence by
i about a loot. Dave can probably
; now claim the additional distinction
! of hitting the longest single in the
] history of the park. The blow, a
| good 370-footer if it had been al-
I lowed to drop naturally, bounced
! of! the boards into the waiting arms
: of the Cal left fielder, and Melton
was held to one base for his efforts.
All of which is a prime example
!of the part chance plays in such
I goings-on. Blasting Bob Nava polod
:an inside-the-park homer in the
second inning that couldn't compare
with Melton's smash for distance
but it certainly took the honors as
far as the scorebook was concerned.

The Bi<; Noise Is IVlulYlcd
One very noticeable aspect of
: Saturday's horsehide holocaust was
the lack of umpire-baiting on the
part ot Cal's usually-voluble back
, stop, Jim Fiscalini.
Last time the two teams met at
the Sunken Diamond, Jim was star
performer of a fifth-inning home
plate riot act during which the can
takerous catcher shoved the plate
ump all the way from home to first
, base. His umps, clearly taking a dim
view oi Fiscalini's histrionics, ban
; ished Jeering James irom the ball
game then and there.
Presumably, Fiscalini has since
come to the conclusion that silence
is golden.

The Bi<; Noise Is IVlulYlcd
One very noticeable aspect of
: Saturday's horsehide holocaust was
the lack of umpire-baiting on the
part ot Cal's usually-voluble back
, stop, Jim Fiscalini.
Last time the two teams met at
the Sunken Diamond, Jim was star
performer of a fifth-inning home
plate riot act during which the can
takerous catcher shoved the plate
ump all the way from home to first
, base. His umps, clearly taking a dim
view oi Fiscalini's histrionics, ban
; ished Jeering James irom the ball
game then and there.
Presumably, Fiscalini has since
come to the conclusion that silence
is golden.
Six out of eight. That's the soul
satisiying score racked up by Farm
athletes in last weekend's action
packed events.
But the sweetest part of the re
sults of our boys' Easter celebra
tions is the fact that live of said vic
tories were achieved at the expense
of clem dirty Golden Bears. Yessir,
we moidcred da bums; and there arc
some long faces in the shadow of the
Campanile this week.
Cal did manage to preserve some
pride lrom the weekend's ruins
when Clint Evans' nonchalant nine
clowned its way to 9 to 5 win over
at the Sunken Diamond, but the
baseballers' victory was more than
overshadowed by their varsity
losses in the swimming and tennis
festivals, and frosh defeats in swim
ming, tennis, and baseball.

Gay Should lie Hilarious
Needless to say, the lad who pro
vided most of the gaiety for Farm
fans was he of the meaningful
monicker, Gay Bryan. The unbe
lieveable one really put in a day's
work; and about the time he was
preparing lor that final broad jump,
he looked as though he should be
doing his leaping into a mattress
rather than into a sandpit.
He was tired, but doubtless well
satisfied with his afternoon's toil.
For Gay, personally, accounted for
more first placcs than the entire
San Jose team—and almost as many
points.
In fact, if Bryan had been per
forming for the Staters rather than
for Stanford, the Indians would have
won the meet by only three points
instead of 50.
That gives you some idea of the
importance of Gaylord to track
mentor Jack Weiershauser.

The Golden Boy
Stanford's crew of sideline jock
eys, many of whom attended Satur
day's Big Ball Game for the express
purpose of firing verbal barrages at
Jackie (he runs, he kicks, he passes,
lie pitches, he hits, and he makes
love) Jensen, were mightly disap
pointed when it was announced that
Dave Anderson would do the chuck
ing lor the Bears in place of their
headline hero.
Still, although Jensen spent most

i ot the afternoon in right field out
of hooting range of the stands, the
grandstand gagsters were not to be
completely denied.
Each of Jensen's appearances at
the plate signaled the unleashing oi
a shower of abusive witticisms.
Typical comment: Jackie isn't really
i iat—that bulge around the middle
j is where he carries his press clip
i phigs.
i The Golden Boy wasn't completely
oblivious of the jockeying, either.
In the seventh inning he grounded
out short to lirst lor the second out;
and rather than return to the Cal
dug-out, which would have entailed
: walking past the Stanford rooting
section, he chose to park himself on
: the grass along the right-field foul
! line to wait out the rest of the
| inning.
Two Records For Dave
Shortstop Dave Melton, whose
; over-the-fence belt against Santa
I Clara a few weeks back was the
| seventh such in Sunken Diamond
| history, almost turned the trick
again Saturday.
But because his eighth-inning
, blast tailed to clear the fence by

i ot the afternoon in right field out
of hooting range of the stands, the
grandstand gagsters were not to be
completely denied.
Each of Jensen's appearances at
the plate signaled the unleashing oi
a shower of abusive witticisms.
Typical comment: Jackie isn't really
i iat—that bulge around the middle
j is where he carries his press clip
i phigs.
i The Golden Boy wasn't completely
oblivious of the jockeying, either.
In the seventh inning he grounded
out short to lirst lor the second out;
and rather than return to the Cal
dug-out, which would have entailed
: walking past the Stanford rooting
section, he chose to park himself on
: the grass along the right-field foul
! line to wait out the rest of the
| inning.
Two Records For Dave
Shortstop Dave Melton, whose
; over-the-fence belt against Santa
I Clara a few weeks back was the
| seventh such in Sunken Diamond
| history, almost turned the trick
again Saturday.
But because his eighth-inning
, blast tailed to clear the fence by
i about a loot. Dave can probably
; now claim the additional distinction
! of hitting the longest single in the
] history of the park. The blow, a
| good 370-footer if it had been al-
I lowed to drop naturally, bounced
! of! the boards into the waiting arms
: of the Cal left fielder, and Melton
was held to one base for his efforts.
All of which is a prime example
!of the part chance plays in such
I goings-on. Blasting Bob Nava polod
:an inside-the-park homer in the
second inning that couldn't compare
with Melton's smash for distance
but it certainly took the honors as
far as the scorebook was concerned.

The Bi<; Noise Is IVlulYlcd
One very noticeable aspect of
: Saturday's horsehide holocaust was
the lack of umpire-baiting on the
part ot Cal's usually-voluble back
, stop, Jim Fiscalini.
Last time the two teams met at
the Sunken Diamond, Jim was star
performer of a fifth-inning home
plate riot act during which the can
takerous catcher shoved the plate
ump all the way from home to first
, base. His umps, clearly taking a dim
view oi Fiscalini's histrionics, ban
; ished Jeering James irom the ball
game then and there.
Presumably, Fiscalini has since
come to the conclusion that silence
is golden.
