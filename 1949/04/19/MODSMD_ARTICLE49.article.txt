Track and field this morning.
Roll out that Trojan Horse, men. And don't look now, but old El Troje
s in trouble.
While Stanford was pounding Little Punk San Jose State Saturday, *he
ace with the prison pallor was sneaking a look at mighty Troy down in
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Staggering slightly, USC's thinclads had to come from behind to tie
Michigan State's indoor champs in a meet that was well-planned, well
•xeeuted, and well-attended.
But the important part of the day was the following set of observations:
Troy Is Sinking
Factual Observation: USC in 1949 is not the Troy of old. The Trojans
ire strong only in the pole-vault, 880, and the sprints.
Reflected Observation: Dean Cromwell, retired prince of Trojan Track,
.vas plumb crazy in the head when he stated earlier that he was leaving
he best USC track team of all time. The Trojans have never been so
(hallow in spots, so pitiful in the distances, and so parthotic in the field.
Safety Observation: However, the Troys are still good enough to trounce
r.ost dual meet opponents, and are still rated the number one track squad
n the nation.
h'niotional Observation: But zounds, the time, place, and setting are per
( t:t for Stanford hi two weeks to rise up and smash the Figueroa Street
tomeos just where it hurts most.
Last Time Was 1933
And although it scares people to say it. Jack Weiershauser's men figure
0 cash in this trip out. And if they do,
1. It will be the first time since 193 l» that a Redshirted Indian track
team has downed USC.
2. It will be only the second time in 20 years (peace years) that Troy
lias lost a dual meet.
.'t. It will be a feat which even the likes of Clyde Jeffrey and Paul
.Moore were unable to perform.
I. It will be the greatest thing to happen to Stanford, athletically, since
the 1940 Hose Bowl win over Nebraska.
Of course, one million and six things could happen. USC has been
mown to come up with mystery men, to make fantastic switches, and
cme-through with unheard of improvements.
Not Impossible at All
But right now, based on comparative times and abilities, Stanford grabs
he gravy.
A 1 Lyons can win the mile, Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson can two-time
n the 440, Gay Bryan gets a second in the century, and Downing McKee
nd Dell pick up at least a fir.st and a third in the high hurdles.
Gay Bryan could get another second in the furlong. A 1 Lyons will be
jack with a second in the two-mile, and Gay Bryan win the broad jump.
Gay Bryan seconds again in the low hurdles, he takes the high jump,
)tis Chandler and Lew Davis double up in the shot, Steve McKee and
Chandler one-two in the discus, and Stanford wins the javelin.
Top that off with a win in the relay, and Stanford's score card reads
1 points. That's plenty. All you need is 6G. and the Tribe figures to have
hat salted away by the time the low hurdles are in.
So make way for the fall of Troy, nothing would suit Stanford any
ctter. The line to the band wagon forms to the left.
