# Indian Baseballers Clash With Red-Hot COP Today
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Still having a tough time winning
in thenr own league, Stanford's
ireescoring varsity baseballers will
try out somebody else's conference
this afternoon when they run up
against the red-hot College of the
Pucific nine.
'Ilie contest will be played on
the Sunken Diamond, with game
time set at .'5:15.
Stanford wi'l be out to avenge an
earlier defeat, suffered under the
lights at Oak Park in Stockton ear
lier this month, but the pitchless
Cards may be biting off more than
(hey can chew. COP's defending
CCAA champs have, among other
tilings this year, not been beaten
by a CIBA team.
The Tigers hold non-conference
wins over St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
Cal, and Stanford.
The Indians, on the other hand,

to plug the hole in the leaky c'ike.
Laßrum is a lanky right - hander
whose Sunday curve ball may be
I just the pitch to put the Cards back
on the victory trail. Fast bailer Hoi
nen is usually pretty effective when
j he can find the plate, which hasn't
been too- often of late.
Tiger Coach Hugh McWilliams
hasn't announced a starter, but the
logical choice is his right-handed
kid brother-in-law.
Lanky McWilliams was an all -
CCAA choice last year, and his siz
zling fastball and cracking curve
rate him as one of the best major
league prospects in the Bay Area.

earlier defeat, suffered under the

CCAA champs have, among other
tilings this year, not been beaten
by a CIBA team.
The Tigers hold non-conference
wins over St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
