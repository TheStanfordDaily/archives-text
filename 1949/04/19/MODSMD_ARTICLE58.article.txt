# BAT INVADES ROBLE
## 
### 
Roble girls were in a state of mild
confusion yesterday when a bat vio
lated the privacy of their boudoirs.
They reported the beast as having
a wingspread of about one foot and
a supercilious expression. It was
not allowed to remain in Roble be
cause of the danger to pincurls.
