# Democracy Is Being Sacrificed In Japan Says KSU Panel
## 
### 
Discussing the question of tie- i
mocracy in Japan, a panel of three :
graduate students cn last night's J
KSU broadcast of the Stanford (
Roundtable came to the conclusion
that the U.S. attempt to democra
tize Japan has fallen victim to the
cold war.
The group agreed that General
Mac Arthur had done a good job.
but that the cold war had forced
sidetracking of democratic reforms
originally planned in favor of a
policy of military preparedness.
Another point brought out bv the
discussion, which took place before j
an audience of about 40 persons in !
the Women's Clubhouse, was that I
Mac Arthur was generally well |
liked, despite a quite harsh civil i

program. A slight Communist gai
in power was attributed in part t
the failure of U.S. occupation t.
li\ e up to its earlier promises <
democratic reform.
