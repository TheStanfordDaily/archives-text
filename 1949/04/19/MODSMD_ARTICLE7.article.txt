# Lagunita Level Drops At Dangerous Rate
## 
### 
Water in Lake Lagunita is de
creasing at the rate of one and a
half million gallons a day. or at
the rate of one foot a week.
Yesterday the lake had a total
of 9!Â» million gallons. At the last
previous measurement, on Thurs
day, the lake contained 104.7 gal
lons.
According to Carl Maicr. assist
ant engineer, if Lake Lagunita re
cedes another two feet, the water
level mav he too low to allow the
presentation of the Water Car
nival. As the probability of suffi
cient rain is slight, the iake could
possibly reach this level in two
weeks.
