Sophomore slaves for sale!
This wv.s the slogan of the auc
tion held at Hurlburt House last
night to raise money to buy a house
canoe.
The Hurburt sophomores will
work for their feminine upperclass- '
men today from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.,
and they must do anything within
reason from serving them breakfast j
in bed to polishing their automo- j
bile.
The slaves were auctioned of! ;
with bids beginning at a dollar for
women without cars to a dollar and ;
a half for those with wheels.
Over $75 was raised. Jack Weed- ;
en. Hurlburt hasher, acted as auc- 1
tioneer.
One Rough, having heard in ad- !
vance of the auction, had one of the j
junior girLs buy him a date with a !
red-headed sophomore for tonight. '
It cost him S5.
Miss Genevieve McDufTee auc
tioned oft' Weeden to eight Hurlburt
women for $9.80. Although Weeden ,
refused to bring them breakfast in
bed, he has promised to take his :
owners to L'Omnue's tonight for J
at'ter-d ; r,eer re: rcsliments.
