# Varitype Will Facilitate Speed Printing Process

(Editor's note: This is the first i

offset printing as has been pro
posed for The Daily. Stories on
the subject will concern opera
tion, flexibility, and economy of
tlie method.)
A varityped newspaper printed on j
an offset press is one that has been l
typewritten (in any type style, such !
as The Daily's present Bodoni style), |
pasted up on a "dummy" (layout i
page), photographed, developed on I
a zinc page plate, and run off the I
presses.
The present flatbed system used j
by The Daily, however, involves :
more time, labor, materials.
Stories are set in lead slugs by
the linotype. The lead "lines" that
make lip a story are placed in a
metal frame called a '"form." When
these page forms are filled out, they j
are locked up and placed in the '
press. Usually some adjustments
are necessary before the press can
be started.
But before the form can be placed
in the press, photo engravings j
must be made, mat photos cast, !

headlines set by linotype, and en
gravings "built up" in order to be
"type high": that is. to be able to
come in contact with ink and paper
on the press.
Varitype and offset printing elim
inates all of the outmoded steps
listed above for the flatbed press.
Instead of spending money on en
gravings and mat castings, students
or employees would paste photos on
the master page dummy. Phototype
headlines would be pasted on the
dummy. These headlines are put
together from letters printed on
light cardboard squares.
When the page layouts are com
pleted, a technician photographs
them. Page negatives are assem
bled. spliced, ar.d placed on a sensi
tized zinc plate that is screened fine
enough to allow sharp, detailed pic
tures.
The negatives and plate are ex
posed under an arc light for a few
minutes, then removed. The zinc
plate is coveted with developing ink
and flushed with running water.
This leaves the developed plate
ready for the offset printing press.
Offset printing is a transferral
procedure. A press roller inks the
zinc plate. Another cylinder rolls
over the piate, picks up the im
pression, ana transfers it to the pa
pei as it passes through the press.
Speed on the offset press is faster
than the flatbed machine. The Uni
versity Press machine prints about
1.800 eight-page papers an hour; off
set presses turn out 2.000 copies per
hour.

A varityped newspaper printed on j
an offset press is one that has been l
typewritten (in any type style, such !
as The Daily's present Bodoni style), |
pasted up on a "dummy" (layout i
page), photographed, developed on I
a zinc page plate, and run off the I
presses.
The present flatbed system used j
by The Daily, however, involves :
more time, labor, materials.
Stories are set in lead slugs by
the linotype. The lead "lines" that
make lip a story are placed in a
metal frame called a '"form." When
these page forms are filled out, they j
are locked up and placed in the '
press. Usually some adjustments
are necessary before the press can
be started.
But before the form can be placed
in the press, photo engravings j
must be made, mat photos cast, !

headlines set by linotype, and en
gravings "built up" in order to be
"type high": that is. to be able to
come in contact with ink and paper
on the press.
Varitype and offset printing elim
inates all of the outmoded steps
listed above for the flatbed press.
Instead of spending money on en
gravings and mat castings, students
or employees would paste photos on
the master page dummy. Phototype
headlines would be pasted on the
dummy. These headlines are put
together from letters printed on
light cardboard squares.
When the page layouts are com
pleted, a technician photographs
them. Page negatives are assem
bled. spliced, ar.d placed on a sensi
tized zinc plate that is screened fine
enough to allow sharp, detailed pic
tures.
The negatives and plate are ex
posed under an arc light for a few
minutes, then removed. The zinc
plate is coveted with developing ink
and flushed with running water.
This leaves the developed plate
ready for the offset printing press.
Offset printing is a transferral
procedure. A press roller inks the
zinc plate. Another cylinder rolls
over the piate, picks up the im
pression, ana transfers it to the pa
pei as it passes through the press.
Speed on the offset press is faster
than the flatbed machine. The Uni
versity Press machine prints about
1.800 eight-page papers an hour; off
set presses turn out 2.000 copies per
hour.


TIIE D. S. J. COXHEAD VARITYPER shown above costs $2,500, but
it fulfills the same task that $15,000 linotype machines now in use ac
complish. Below is the American Type Founders camera used to
photograph page layouts.
