# Elliott Discusses Photographic Art
## 
### 
Harold Elliott, noted amateur pho
tographer, spoke yesterday after
noon on photographic methods. The
lecture was held in the Art Gallery,
where several of Elliott's prints are
on display. He explained the var
ious techniques employed in print
ing these pictures and showed the
original photographs to illustrate
the difference retouching makes.
Elliott said that the choice of pa
per employed in the printing and
the tone used make the difference
'n the finished print. He feels that
most amateur photographers make a
mistake in relying on fast exposures
and speed film. Elliott said lie has
always had most success with me
dium speed film and medium ex
posures. He prefers India tone pa
per for the richness it gives.
By using chemical reducers,
dodging, and diffusion, Elliott can
eliminate unwanted highlights, em
phasize dull areas, and even remove
such extraneous objects as unwant
ed telephone poles. Elliott told cam
era enthusiasts that they should not
hope to get more than a half-dozen
Rood prints out of a hundred nega
tives.
All of the prints on display have
been shown in international salons
of photography.
