## Men's Council and IFB 
### 
The inclusion, of a paragraph in the proposed new ASSU
Constitution which enumerates the judicial duties of the Inter
fraternity Board of Control has been interpreted by some as being
a curtailment of the powers of the Interfraternity Board. This
assumption is incorrect.
The paragraph was inserted by the ASSU Constitutional Com
mittee in order to clarify the judicial relationship which exists be
tween the Interfraternity Board and Men's Council.
All male students, whether members of fraternities or not, will
be'subject to the jurisdiction of Men's Council under the new
Constitution. The Interfraternity Board will hear all cases in
volving a fraternity or fraternities and such other cases involving
fraternity members as Men's Council may deem appropriate.
Frarternities, as such, will therefore be under the sole juris
diction of the Interfraternity Board, but this body will not hear
cases involving individual students unless Men's Council so
rules. Men's Council, by the same token, will have no judicial
power to enforce fraternity regulations but may judge any or all
members of a fraternity individually when violations of the dis
ciplinary regulations of the University or the ASSU are involved.
Under the undefined relationship which now exists, jurisdic
tion over a Fundamental Standard violator has at times gone to
the first judicial body to take action on the case.
The clarifying provision in the new Constitution will do away
with this dual-supreme court idea and should allow a more uni
form application of the Fundamental Standard.
