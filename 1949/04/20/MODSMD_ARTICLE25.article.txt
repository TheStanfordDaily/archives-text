## Bull Session 
### 
If you recall, last week this pillar of wisdom offered an introductory
course in the fundamentals of the game of bridge. Several of our readers,
after digesting the basic elements of the game, have written in (liar!) and
asked for further instructions. And so we continue with "How To Play

Bridge," or "What do you want to live to an old age
for; the Republicans will never get back in anyway!"
The Big Game .... (and rules for it)
1. When you have a poor hand, signal your partner
immediately by saying, "Who dealt this?"
2. Lead from your own hand or the dummy as con
venient; at least you won't be the only dummy there.
When disputes arise on minor points, quote the
rule book as if you had actually read it. If someone
else in the game has read the book, quote the rules
in French. You may not prove your point, but you're
sure as hell going to impress somebody.

4. Never hurry. Exasperate your opponents. They might let you win
just to get the painful thing over with.
5. When the dummy lays down his hand, try to determine which hand
holds the remaining important cards by leaning slightly to either side
and in a casual, abstract manner scrutinize your opponent's hand. This
is undoubtedly more effective than a haphazard finesse.
<>. If your partner asks you if you are familiar with Blackwood, lick
your lips and nod. (Everyone knows that Blackwood is a restaurant in
Paly.)
7. If you have a spade bid with the acc missing, bid one spade. If you
have the ace, bid "A" spade. This will inform your partner that you arc
holding the ace. If the opponents catch oh, they will kindly refrain from
saying anything, because doing that would hurt your feelings at having
your wonderful system discovered.
8. Claim all the honors .... you might get away with it, especially
if the people you are playing with are strangers.
9. During the course of the game, impress your opponents with some
thing like: "The last time I played against Culbertson, I set him three
straight time!" (Who besides you is going to know that you're referring
to Sam Culbertson, a bookie in San Mateo?)
10. Eat caramels or other adhesive candy during the game. It keeps the
cards from skidding.
11. If you have a poor partner, keep score yourself; you've got to have
some advantage.
12. Talk continuously about your classes or fashions. This will give
you great popularity and will also credit you with being a very clever con
versationalist.
13. making only a "little slam," curse softly to yourself and say just
loudly enough to be heard: "I don't know what wrong with my bridge
lately!" (This is a cinch to impress somebody. If the trouble with your
bridge continues, remove it from your mouth, and take it to your dentist
the first thing in the morning.)

5. When the dummy lays down his hand, try to determine which hand
holds the remaining important cards by leaning slightly to either side
and in a casual, abstract manner scrutinize your opponent's hand. This
is undoubtedly more effective than a haphazard finesse.
<>. If your partner asks you if you are familiar with Blackwood, lick
your lips and nod. (Everyone knows that Blackwood is a restaurant in
Paly.)
7. If you have a spade bid with the acc missing, bid one spade. If you
have the ace, bid "A" spade. This will inform your partner that you arc
holding the ace. If the opponents catch oh, they will kindly refrain from
saying anything, because doing that would hurt your feelings at having
your wonderful system discovered.
8. Claim all the honors .... you might get away with it, especially
if the people you are playing with are strangers.
9. During the course of the game, impress your opponents with some
thing like: "The last time I played against Culbertson, I set him three
straight time!" (Who besides you is going to know that you're referring
to Sam Culbertson, a bookie in San Mateo?)
10. Eat caramels or other adhesive candy during the game. It keeps the
cards from skidding.
11. If you have a poor partner, keep score yourself; you've got to have
some advantage.
12. Talk continuously about your classes or fashions. This will give
you great popularity and will also credit you with being a very clever con
versationalist.
13. making only a "little slam," curse softly to yourself and say just
loudly enough to be heard: "I don't know what wrong with my bridge
lately!" (This is a cinch to impress somebody. If the trouble with your
bridge continues, remove it from your mouth, and take it to your dentist
the first thing in the morning.)

If you recall, last week this pillar of wisdom offered an introductory
course in the fundamentals of the game of bridge. Several of our readers,
after digesting the basic elements of the game, have written in (liar!) and
asked for further instructions. And so we continue with "How To Play

Bridge," or "What do you want to live to an old age
for; the Republicans will never get back in anyway!"
The Big Game .... (and rules for it)
1. When you have a poor hand, signal your partner
immediately by saying, "Who dealt this?"
2. Lead from your own hand or the dummy as con
venient; at least you won't be the only dummy there.
When disputes arise on minor points, quote the
rule book as if you had actually read it. If someone
else in the game has read the book, quote the rules
in French. You may not prove your point, but you're
sure as hell going to impress somebody.

4. Never hurry. Exasperate your opponents. They might let you win
just to get the painful thing over with.
5. When the dummy lays down his hand, try to determine which hand
holds the remaining important cards by leaning slightly to either side
and in a casual, abstract manner scrutinize your opponent's hand. This
