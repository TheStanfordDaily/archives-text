Deadline on Excom's Action
To the Editor:
I should like to suggest an amendment to Article VII on Student Organ
izations, Section 1:
"Excom shall act upon the submitted constitutions of student organ
izations within a period of not more than six weeks."
1 think there are valid reasons for such an amendment since Excom
received the Young Progressives' constitution for consideration almost
three months ago, and no action has been taken, either pro or con.
