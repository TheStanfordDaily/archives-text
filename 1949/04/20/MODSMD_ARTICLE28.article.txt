# 1950 Big Year for Democrats
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Truman taught us a lesson which 1
should guide us into 1950, Oliver !
J. Carter, California Democratic j
Central Committee chairman, said j
Monday night before the Palo Alto- j
Stanford Democratic Council.
The man who helped engineer the !
Democratic victory in the Golden \
State last November said the lesson ;
was faith and belief in the Demo
cratic cause.
The 38-year-old state chairman
said, "1950 will be a year fraught
with more importance for this sfcite
and elsewhere, because 1950 is the
decennial census. California will be I
allocated 7 or 8 additional congress- I
men because of our growing popu
lation, making it the second or third
largest state representation in the
nation, depending on Pennsylvania's j
growth."
Speaking of the more local impli
cations. Carter said that it behooves j
the Democratic Party to make sure j
that at least one state legislative 1
chamber is Democratic to protect the '
party's rights in the state district
reapportionments. There may be j
four new legislators from the north j
and four from the south.
S.F. Reapportionment
"This is important for the San '
Francisco area. It is important that '
reapportionment be done by our
people. Such things as reappor- i
tionmcnt—which is basically impor- I
tant — determine whether housing,
civil rights, and other legislative 1
acts for the people will pass, for it
the reapportionment is conducive to |
Democratic increases in the state j
legislature we can pass this progres
sive legislation
The- State Democratic chairman
said, "Our mark is to capture the
constitutional offices in the state in ;
1950, every one of them. It's a big
job. 1 know we have a pretty pow
crlul Republican machine that has
successfully crossed party lines. But
the biggest blow at "cross-filing is
and will be an emphatic Democratic
victory in 1950."'
Carter made an important issue
of the need for a sharper delinea
tion in California politics between
the two parties. He contended that
Warren's support of cross-liling
and a two-party system, though
not immoral, "certainly is amoral." j
The former Stanford student said
that the political feud between the j
Republican governor and the Re
publican attorney general was an
"earthquake," but was only the her- 1
aid of more things to come. Carter
scored Warren's paradoxical support I
ol a "corrupt attorney general" in
1940 with the governor's 1949 state
ments. "The voters are seeing t lie
eliect of a long-range corrupt Re
publican administration."
Must Oust Republicans
The chairman made an appeal to j
50 members of the local Democratic
Council to realize that it will take '
a sustained hard drive to oust the I
local Republican state senator, state 1
asemblyman, and congressman.
This man, who was on the 1948
Democratic Convention's Platform i
Committee, just returned from
Washington. He said, "If you think
the ideals in the platform and ol
the Fair Deal are going to be de
leatcd -by those same commentators I
who wanted to see Harry Truman ;
lose anyway — you have another |
think coming."
He gave an example of how the I
Democratic Party can and probably
will function to effectuate its prom- i
ises: "In the recent fight in the !
House about California's needed aid j
in its water-supply problem, the
Democratic California delegation
was on the floor the whole time of
the debate. The majority of the
Democratic House voted down, one
after another, Republican attempts i
to kill the measure. While this was i
going on, Helen Gahagan Douglas '
turned to a Southern Democrat and i
asked, "How does it feel to be a
member of a political party?"
"That legislation wasn't supposed j
to have passed over the many blocks !
—but it did. So will most of the ■
rest of it!"
