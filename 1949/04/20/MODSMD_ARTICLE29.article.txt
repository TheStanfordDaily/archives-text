## Easter Service Complaint 
### 
To the Editor:
Today I heard two of the most secular Easter services that I have ever
heard. Neither captured the spirit of the risen Christ.
In the early morning service (8:30), the brass choir (a fancy name for it
band) played two unmelodious pieces, namely, "Sonata No. 2," by Pezel
and Sonata on the Bth Tone," Gabrieli. Both pieces, as far as I am con
cerned, were entirely unsuited for an Easter service. The choral reading
of the Scripture was childish—l thought I had left that in junior high
school.
Had only the two solo speakers spoken, that part of the service would
have been excellent, but some person wanted to get as many names as
possible on the program, so almost every phrase that was read by a solo
speaker was repeated by the leaders in something less than perfect unison.
The sermon was unlike any Easter sermon I am capable of remembering.
Instead of preaching a sermon, Dr. Johnston launched a tirade against
taxes, militarism, and Communism. There was little mention of Christ.
I, personally, felt as though Dr. Sterling's Easter greeting was better
suited, than Dr. Johnston's sermon, to be a sermon.
Ihe interruption of the program by the radio announcer was anything
but conducive to religious thought. Next year. I hope the University will
not be so commercially minded as to have the program broadcast, so as
to let those who want to enjoy an Easter service enjoy it.
The service in the chapel at 11 o'clock was a great improvement except
lor one thing—the sermon was even worse. In the seimon I learned that
our Chaplain disapproves of high taxes, militarism, swimming pools, cock
tail parties, etc. Where he could have presented a sermon about the glory
of Easter (which I do admit he touched slightly upon) or of Heaven or
God, he spent his time describing, the secular glories of such places as
Hollywood. Easter spirit was lacking in both of his sermons.
If the University hired Dr. Johnston as an exponent of the Republican
Party, I think they could have had the respect for the Church in not
placing him in the position of Chaplain. If Chaplain Johnston would stick
tj religion and use the intellect which is present in his sermons for fur
thering the idea of the Kingdom of God on earth, he would make me (if no
one else) a great deal happier.
But. enough of criticism. All the participants in both services worked
very hard to give a well-polished, if not Easter-like, performance. The
University Choir deserves a great deal of credit for working so hard to
prepare such wonderfully-sung anthems. I would say that what success
the services had was due to the chair and their accompanists, the Brass
Choir and Organist Nanney.
