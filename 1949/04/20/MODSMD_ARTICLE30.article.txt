To the Editor:
Last Wednesday, another Stanford student and I took two friends from
Oakland to a place called the Hilo, located between Menlo Park and
Redwood City. We ordered beers and the waitress took the order. But,
the bartender relused to serve us.
He said that those were the boss' orders. Reason given by him for the
refusal was that all four of us were too drunk.
In reality we had not had anything to drink at all (not even a coke).
The reason for his refusal, it became obvious to us, was that one of our
friends from Oakland was a Negro.
We called the county sheriff's olTice. Two men came from there after
an hour and a half. They refused to do anything and said that if the bar
tender said we were drunk, well, he had a right to think the way he
pleased. They did warn us, though, about the consequences of "disturbing
the peace,."
We left after that. Our fellow students can imagine what we must have
felt and gone through mentally. We have brought the matter before the
campus chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP). It has agreed to consider it in the immediate future.
