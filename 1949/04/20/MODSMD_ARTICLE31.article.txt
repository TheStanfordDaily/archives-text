# Chance of a Lifetime

### 
To the Editor:
This is an open letter to any and all Stanfordites who may be living
in a state of depression bordering on insanity because they feel that they
"aren't wanted."
I used to feel that way myself, but now I realize, as vice-president in
charge of getting people to work for the lIR. that everyone is wanted,
needed, and desired. Realizing this, I became a healthy, strapping girl
with a happy outlook on life.
However, this subiime situation is about to dissipate; I'm going to lose
all the pounds I've gained so far because no one seems to need to bo
wanted.
Men! Women! Kiddies! Do you want to stand by and watch a fellow
human being die slowly and miserably? You do? Good!!
Come over to the lIR Shack (M to F, 3-5, and unexpected hours) and
WATCH ME.
