# Misplaced Nine

### 
To the Editor:
Re your article April 18, 1949, "Frosh Sweep Three From Cal." stating
that the freshman baseball team defeated the California freshman nine
for the first time since 1938; we wish to inform you that there are at
least two of us old men here on the campus who participated in an 11-
inning, 1 to 0. win over the California freshmen in the first game and a
12 to 3 slaughter in the second game to win the series in 1941.
Two forgotten heroes.
