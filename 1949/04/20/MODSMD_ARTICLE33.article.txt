To the Editor:
Small things. A cigaiettc butt is only an inch or so long. Every morning
on the library steps, there are dozens of them.
Distribution of The Daily: A stone keeps the top copy from blowing
. . . . only sometimes it lets them escape to be scuffed into the bushes.
A noonday sun streams through an empty classroom; overhead four
great electric bulbs are burning.
Small things! And small gestures could make the difference. It's a small
flick of the wrist to put a cig;uctte into the sand tray. It's a flick of vour
finger to switch a light.
Or is it a big thing to conserve, to keep shipshape? Does it take a
European tragedy to abolish waste paper because there is no pulp for paper,
no lights burning because there is no current?
For educating people, do these things matter?
