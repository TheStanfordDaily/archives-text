## Cards Have Two Best Shot Putters Of Nation in Davis and Chandler 
### JOHN BREIER 
At any other school or at any other time, a fellow who can toss the shot
>ver 54 feet would be considered the outstanding athlete of the institution
md rate headlines in the neighboring newspapers. But when such a
ieldman competes on the same team as Gay Bryan and Otis Chandler, he
s apt to be overlooked.
Such is the case of Card shotputter Lew Davis. Lew is only the second
iest collegiate putter in the United States. He is topped only by team
nate Chandler.
Davis' put if 54 feet 4'■> inches in Saturday's meet was his all-time l>est
nd marked the first time in the history of the event that two men on
he same team hit over the 54-foot mark in the same meet.
While it is true that me.st of the Eastern and Midwestern shotputters
iave not competed in oudoor meets as yet, that fact does not belittle the
fTorts of either Davis or Chandler. Yale's Jim Fuchs has an indoor mark
112 s(j feet 3 :! ,4 inches. But indoor shotputting differs in many ways from
utdoor competition.
Indoor shotputting, - Ls done with a leather-covered ball that makes for
better grip. The event takes place on a wood floor and the putters
ear short spikes that give greater footing. West Coast weather allows
utters to practice outdoors when the other parts of the nation are still
:i the grip of cold weather. Thus, the West Coaster seldom if ever gets
i compete in the indoor meets. And it is track gospel that indoor marks
re inches better than the same putter's outdoor efforts.
Davis . Was H.S. and J.C. Clianip
But back to this fellow Lew Davis. Lew won the National Junior College
hampionship last year while competing with Menlo. His winning dis
ince of 50 feet 3 inches was consideraljly under his best 1948 mark of
1 feet 5 inches.
His championships don't stop there either. He won the National High
chool title with a 50-foot toss. (12-pound shot). Then he went on to place
-cond in the Army Pacific Olympics with a 48 foot 5 inch effort. This
'as in 1946. Then came Menlo, and after that Stanford.
Davis gave notice of becoming one of the nation's best with his JC
istances But in truth he was just getting started on an entirely new
yle of tossing. This is evident by his continued advancing marks that
irried on into this year.
He attracted the notice of the one and only Dink Templeton while at
[enlo. The good Dink quickly recognized several faults and set about
> correct them. This was in mid-season last year. He completed the
:ange-over and went on to win the Nationals.
He hit 53 feet 7 inches in the COP meet, dropped to 51 feet 11 inches
inst UCLA in the Southland, and then reached his all-time distance
last Saturday. There is no reason to believe that he, or Chandler, has
reached his limit. In any event, the two lads present the greatest one-two
punch that collegiate circles have ever seen.

While we're at it, let's take this time to mention an article by Temple
ton in the May issue of Sports Illustrated. The Dink has written a bit
about Chandler, quite a bit. In fact, it is a four and a half page spread
>n Otis, shotputting, weight lifting, and Dink's ideas about them all. It
is slated to hit the stands on Saturday.

And now we turn, as must we always, to football and spring practice.
Saturday's game scrimmage was attended by an overflow crowd that, I
think, was attracted by a couple of fellows named Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn.
At the start of spring practice, now two weeks along, those in the know
were gravely worried about three positions—quarterback, guard, and full
back.
I don't believe that Kerkorian is a spring flash. He seems to know what
he is doing and his passing takes a buck seat to but few on the Pacific Coast.
Horn is much better than he showed Saturday. He will come along. Then,
too, Tom Shaw may show the promise that he hinted in 1947. All in all,
though it is yet early, the quarterback situation seems to be good.
Fullback and guard are something else. Schwartz has changed end
ike Pelsinger to the guard spot in hopes of strengthening a position that
is only a few returning lettermen. Yesterday Fullback Russ Pomeroy
id tackle Chuck Hokanson found themselves switched also. But Schwartz
ill isn't satisfied. And he may be so right. Experience means ever so
uch when it somes to the infighting* in the line.
After Bill DeYoung, the one with the floating power, the fullback situa
>n is scrambled. Eric Southwood may well do. He runs well and hard,
itto for Jim Hayes. But from here it looks like DeYoung.
Thus far, this spring practice is the best I have seen in three years,
aybe it is because the positions are so open. Everyone is lighting. Even
me ot the old timers, men who have been around for three years, are
itting out like freshmen. It is a healthy situation and one that augurs
ell for next hill.
