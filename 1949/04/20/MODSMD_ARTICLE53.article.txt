# USC Threatens Farm's Aquatic Record Of Thirty-eight Consecutive Victories
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's varsity swim crew,
which has now swamped 38 consec
utive opponents beneath its impres
sive tidal wave of victory, Friday
must meet the most effective break
water on the Pacific Coast — Fred
Cady's power-laden USC Trojans.
Coach Cady will bring to the
Farm such outstanding stars as
Olympic champ Wally Wolf, back
stroke artist Bob King, breaststrok
er Harry Messenheimer, and dash
king Ace Burns, in Troy's great ef
fort to halt the rampaging Ked tire;
and Tom Haynie's win-loving out
fit will have to do a lot of swim
ming to ride the crest of victory
over the talented Troy tankers.
Greatest in History
Cady's outfit has been dubbed by
southern scribes as the greatest in
Trojan history, and a quick glance
at the record book tells why.
Wolf grabbed second-place hon
ors in the 220-yard freestyle event
in this year's National Collegiate
Championships, then threw in a
fourth place in the 440 for good
measure; King and Messenheimer
have scored some of the fastest
times on the coast in their special
ties, respectively, of the 150-yard
backstroke and 200 - yard breast
stroke; B"rns is at least as fast as
anyone Haynie can place in the

tank for the 50- and 100-yard sprint
affairs; and the SC medley relay
team of King, Messenheimer, and
Don Hughes has consistently broken
3 minutes — faster than Stanford's
best time this season.
So What?
Haynie hasn't let the record-book
dazzle him, however.
"It'll be mighty tough, but I think
we'll win," quoth dauntless Tom.
"Woody Hoogs and Harry Borchers
will give Burns a close tight, Hester
could lick Messenheimer, and Jack
Weeden stands an even chance of
beating King.
' As I see it. each school has a
top man in each event; and every
race should be a blanket finish."
Tomorrow afternoon, also at the
Encina pools, the Indian splashers
will run through a warmup match
against Fullerton J.C.
No Pushovers
The Fullerton lads can also boast
of some top-notch swimmers, and
the Cards can expect some tough
competition from the Junior Colle
gians.
Led by breaststroker Ernie Polte
and 220 specialist Jack Thomas,
Fullerton has amassed an impres
sive record this season; and Haynie
expects tomorrow's meet to be one
of the best on the Farm all year.
"In fact." Haynie continued, "the

two meets this week should be the
best swimming shows ever held at
Stanford—or at least since I've been
here. The spectators are sure to se?
some conference records broken."
Haynie's pre-meet predictions, in
cidentally, will be published in the
Swim-o-Scope in Friday's Daily.
This Swim-o-Scope will include
expected winners and times for eac'.i
event on the Friday program.

in this year's National Collegiate
Championships, then threw in a
fourth place in the 440 for good
measure; King and Messenheimer
have scored some of the fastest
times on the coast in their special
ties, respectively, of the 150-yard
backstroke and 200 - yard breast
stroke; B"rns is at least as fast as
anyone Haynie can place in the

tank for the 50- and 100-yard sprint
affairs; and the SC medley relay
team of King, Messenheimer, and
Don Hughes has consistently broken
3 minutes — faster than Stanford's
best time this season.
So What?
Haynie hasn't let the record-book
dazzle him, however.
"It'll be mighty tough, but I think
we'll win," quoth dauntless Tom.
"Woody Hoogs and Harry Borchers
will give Burns a close tight, Hester
could lick Messenheimer, and Jack
Weeden stands an even chance of
beating King.
' As I see it. each school has a
top man in each event; and every
race should be a blanket finish."
Tomorrow afternoon, also at the
Encina pools, the Indian splashers
will run through a warmup match
against Fullerton J.C.
No Pushovers
The Fullerton lads can also boast
of some top-notch swimmers, and
the Cards can expect some tough
competition from the Junior Colle
gians.
Led by breaststroker Ernie Polte
and 220 specialist Jack Thomas,
Fullerton has amassed an impres
sive record this season; and Haynie
expects tomorrow's meet to be one
of the best on the Farm all year.
"In fact." Haynie continued, "the

two meets this week should be the
best swimming shows ever held at
Stanford—or at least since I've been
here. The spectators are sure to se?
some conference records broken."
Haynie's pre-meet predictions, in
cidentally, will be published in the
Swim-o-Scope in Friday's Daily.
This Swim-o-Scope will include
expected winners and times for eac'.i
event on the Friday program.
Stanford's varsity swim crew,
which has now swamped 38 consec
utive opponents beneath its impres
sive tidal wave of victory, Friday
must meet the most effective break
water on the Pacific Coast — Fred
Cady's power-laden USC Trojans.
Coach Cady will bring to the
Farm such outstanding stars as
Olympic champ Wally Wolf, back
stroke artist Bob King, breaststrok
er Harry Messenheimer, and dash
king Ace Burns, in Troy's great ef
fort to halt the rampaging Ked tire;
and Tom Haynie's win-loving out
fit will have to do a lot of swim
ming to ride the crest of victory
over the talented Troy tankers.
Greatest in History
Cady's outfit has been dubbed by
southern scribes as the greatest in
Trojan history, and a quick glance
at the record book tells why.
