# New Music Goal Of Latins—Chase
## 
### 
Brazil, Venezuela, Panama, Co
lombia, Cuba — one pattern unites
the Latin American countries that
Gilbert Chase, South American mu
sic specialist, lectured on last night
on the Tuesday Evening Series.
Composers in lands south of the
border are all trying to develop a
new phase of Latin American mu
sic. They have become preoccupied
in trying to capture the rhythmic
vitality of their people, said Chase.
Three main phases have typified
South American music in the past.
The first phase was God or religion,
the second was love in the roman
tic era, and the third was national
ity taken from the local folklores.
