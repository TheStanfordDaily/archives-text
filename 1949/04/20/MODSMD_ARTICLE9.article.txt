NEW YORK, April 19 (AP). —Former President Herbert Hoo
ver tonight accused the armed forces of a "really gigantic"
waste of public money and suggested that "the soldier some
times has little appreciation of how hard it is to earn a dollar."
As a result, he told a radio audience, it costs every American

•family about $500 to support the
nation's armed forces. He did not
specify what period of time the $SCK
covered.
The former President said 800,OOt
civilians are employed by the
armed forces, and "that's one for
every two soldiers."
He said Congress' effort to con
solidate the armed forces was met
with "a coalition, not a consolida
tion. As a result, Hoover claimed,
duplicate shops, naval stations, air
poi ts, hospitals, and "a thousand
things still drain off tax moneys.
The former President accused the
armed forces of estimating "some
times twice what they need in the
hopes of getting half of it."
But, he said, he favors a propose
now in Congress to give more au
thority to the Secretary qf Defense
making him responsible only to the
President and Congress.
Hoover said his commission rec
ommended that joint chiefs of stall
tunction under the Defense Secre
| tary. A single chief of staff for al.
armed forces, he said, might give
"undue influence in the country anc
importance to one man."
Despite his criticisms, Hoover told
his audience that he did not think
the country was in any danger un
der the present military setup.
