# Excom Passes New Constitution
## Student Vote To Be Taken 
### 
Excom approved the proposed
new ASSU Constitution with one
opposing vote for submission to an
all-campus election. Sydney Mor
gan cast the only negative vote.
The question of representation on
Excom under the new document
was brought up by Miss Morgan.
She did not favor the system as it
now stands in the Constitution by
which areas are made larger, and
class representatives added.
Miss Morgan stated that she did
not feel that under such a system
Excom members would be able to
properly represent students.
President Gus Chavalas said that
class representation has been used
in the past and was found to be
feasible, led Norton added that
Excom representatives will still be
members of the student group, and
that they should represent the stu
dent body as a whole.
Art Herzog stated that he did not
believe that this plan detracts from

area representation, but Janice
Robertson said that she felt it meant
taking five members away from
areas where they could better rep
resent the students.
Maryanne Teftt reversed her stand
jf last wek, saying that as Roble
Excom member, she was now in
favor of the new system.
Vote on the representation issue
was eight to three in favor of the
system in the new Constitution.
Miss Morgan, Miss Roberson, and
Nancy Jones opposed; and Don Fix,
Herzog, Ralph Miller, Miss TefTt,
Hank Grandin, Mark Hatfield, Er
line Anderson, and Mike Murphy
were in favor.
Norton proposed, after a sugges
tion by Lou Lindsey. that a resolu
tion be passed which would take
.•are of the Honor Code, SAC, Fun
damental Standard, and other mat
ters which are not included in the
i new Constitution until such time
when Excom can pass by-laws con
! cerning them.
The motion was made and passed.
Greg Bemis asked Excom why the
' Dai'y editor should be the only ex
! officio member on Excom besides

the student manager under the new
new Constitution.
■ Bemis said he felt the Daily edi
( tor might be prejudiced and might
I influence Excom. Tom Elke added
; that he thought there should be no
; ex-officio members except the stu
j dent manager.
Chavalas replied that he thought
; the Daily editor was necessary in
order to carry back facts to the stu
i dent body and to work properly
with Excom. A motion was made to
j remove the Daily editor as an ex
■ officio member and was defeated,
1 five to three.
i The remainder of the Constitution
was passed without further debate.
| Hatfield, a member of the commit
i tee which wrote the document.
I pointed out changes that were ap
proved last week.
These changes included wording
iof the preamble to include the
Board of Trustees as a necessary
approving factor for the Constitu
tion, and inclusion of the Daily edi
tor as an ex-officio Excom member.
Intex-fraternity Board of Control
is now taken care of in a special
section which was reworded slight
ly to make it more clear.
