Numbers by Bach, Brahms, Schu
bert, and Cowell will highlight the
violin concert by Joseph Szigeti to
night. The program will begin at
8:1.) in the Memorial Auditorium.
Szigeti is often noted for his hos
pitality to modern works. Newest
of major contemporary works to be
featured by him is Prokofieff's
Violin Sonata in F Minor. The work
was given to Szigeti by the com
poser for its first performance in
America.
Other modern works the violinist
has popularized are Stravinsky's
"Divertimento" and Bartok's "Por
trait." The"Portrait" had been
neglected for 40 years when Szigeti
reintroduced it.
Szigeti, along with Kreisler and
Heii'etz, was nominated one of the
top violinists of the year by a na
tion-wide poll of critics. Another
poll chose his recording of the
Brahms Violin Concerto, made un
der Eugene Ormandy and the Phil
adelphia Symphony Orchestra, as
the best concerto recording of the
year.
The violinist made his American
debut in 1925 with the Philadelphia

Orchestra under Leopold Stokow
ski. Since then he has performed at
the Hollywood Bowl, the Lewisohn
Starium, the Robin Hood Dell, the
Ravinia Festival, and the San Fran
cisco Opera House.
