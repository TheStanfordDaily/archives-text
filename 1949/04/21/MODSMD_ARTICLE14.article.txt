# Streamlined Procedure Simplifies Registration
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Stanford is still using the basic system of registration which
was adopted by Orrin Leslie Elliott, the original registrar, but
within the last few years, the problem of traffic control and dis
tribution of students has resulted in certain beneficial changes.
The incieased emphasis on pre-reg has helped to ease the

Reg clay rush, and lias proved so
successful that a complete advanced
registration is hoped for in the next
few years.
In recent quarters there has been
difficulty in arranging a registra
tion tor physical education that was
satisfactory to both the students
and the staff. The PE staff was not
in iavor oi the system that was used
last quarter, incorporating PE with
the pre-reg procedure, but it was
satisfactory to the students. A new
system has been devised for sum
mer and autumn quarters.
In Lower Division there will be
no pre - enrollment in PE. Only
those students who are taking re
quired courses will indicate physi
cal education on their study cards.
The other students will sign up for
their specific PE courses after they
have handed in their registration
books on registration day.
Upper Division students and any
others taking physical education for
credit will pre-reg in the regular
way.
Another aid in relieving the con
gestion on registration day has been
the centralization of legging in the
Pavilion and Memorial Auditorium.
Previously students had to trek
to the old Administration Building
to get their books, over to the gyms
to sign up for gym classes, to the
Business School to pay their fees,
and then back again to the Admin
istration Building.
Dividing the students into alpha
betical groups has eliminated the
long lines which used to form on
registration day. Sophomores and
juniors remember the registration
days of the fall, 1946 and 1947. quar
ters, when the lines formed at mid
night and new students spent as
long as eight hours in line trying to
get seat cards.
