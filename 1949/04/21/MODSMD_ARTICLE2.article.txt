I have the time to answer all our
questions as it has been fiooded
with hundreds of requests for vari
type information. Also, the varitype
J manufacturer is not familiar with
the unique setup at Stanford."
"Here on The Daily," he contin
ued, "we are working on a part-
I time basis with part-student, part
professional help. Yale is the only

varitype process."
"We are not sure that we are even
going to install varitype at Stan
ford," Daily Business Manager Jim
Donald added, 'it depends on the
information that Pool obtains from
his trip. Since the outfit, including
the building, wiil cost between $G0 ( -
000 and $75,000, it seems like $360
is a small expense to get the facts
straight before making the large
expenditure."
