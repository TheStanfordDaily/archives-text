## Honor Code Justice 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils will sit as one body to handle
all Honor Code cases under the system incorporated in the pro
posed new ASSU Constitution.
At the moment, it is up to the Councils whether they sit as
one body or in joint session. Several reasons may be given for
this change:
First, and most important, are cases on record when men and i
women have been tried by their respective councils on identical
charges and received different penalties. The Committee feels
that with the Honor Code, there is no difference between men .
and women.
Secondly, the new system would help to make the Honor Code
as uniform as possible. With egual justice distributed to both
parties, the interpretation of the Honor Code by all concerned
will be equalized to a great extent.
And lastly, if the two councils were to work together on Honor
Code cases, they would be more likely to get together to consider ;
other judicial problems. Over the past 12 months, there has been
only one joint session of Men's and Women's Councils.
