# BILL DAILEY
## Bull Session 
### 
I was waiting a little time the other night crossing the names of mar
ried women out of an old address book, when a sickening voice came
'oozing out of the radio. After the first shock had subsided, I realized
that this voice couldn't possibly belong to anyone but that beloved dean

of Hollywood gossip columnists, deah old Louclla
Parsons.
Now there, for my money, is probably the funniest
program on the air today: "Louella Parsons' Holly
wood Gossip." The only thing that approaches her
show for sheer silliness (excluding this column), is
the subject about which she talks .... Hollywood,
the corn belt of the nation.
Hollywood is the only place in the world: Where
Artie Shaw could be considered for the leading role
in a new film called "A Letter To Six Wives." . . . .
where the movies have advanced in 30 years from

silent ones to talkies, and now are producing "smellies" .... where the
actors have as many ups and downs as a guy who gets an aisle seat at
the local flea house .... where Betty Grable takes out a million dollars
insurance on her legs (this is, of course, just "pin" money) ....
the novelists get the idea for their second book by watching the screen
version of their first.
Hollywood is the only place in the world: Where two stars who were
engaged decided to call the wedding' off when they couldn't agree which
of them was to get top billing on the wedding announcements . . . .
where the screen writers all get their ideas at the same place—from each
other .... where a well-known actress keeps track of the men who
want to marry her by putting their names on her wedding list . . . .
where Stan Kenton is liable to be arrested for contributing to the de
linquency of a minor key .... where an actress was asked if she was
unmarried, and she answed: "Yes . . . twice!" .... where the cynics
claim that the movies would be much better if they shot fewer films
and more actors.
Hollywood is the only place in the world: Where one ol the studios is
planning a new documentary about life in a prison. An ex-convict is
writing the script, but he is using his pen name—465962! .... where an
actress' secretary didn't keep the records straight, and now the star dis
covers she has been divorced two more times than she's been married.
Let's close the Session with a double bill listing which I saw (really!)
on a theater marquee about 10 years ago. According to the sign, the bill
at the show was ' Here Comes Cookie," with Paul Kelly in "Pursuit."
