## Football Tickets 
### 
To the Editor:
Pardon my out-of-season subject, but the sight of spring football practice j
brought it to mind.
A Letter to the Editor in the issue of Oct. 8, 1948, voiced the gripe that !
a married student couldn't get his wife in to see the football games with |
him unless she paid tuition to get a student body card or they both bought !
regular tickets at the full price.
The editor's comment about the letter quoted A 1 Masters assaying that
the subject could be placed on the agenda of PCC which was to meet
in the first week of January 112 19491.
My query is: Did A 1 Masters place the subject on the PCC agenda? i
What, if any, are the results? Why?
EARNEST E. IRVINE
(Editor's Note: A solution allowing married students to sit with their
wives was worked out by the Athletic Department toward the end of
last football season. Mr. Masters will bring up the matter of reduced
rates for wives at the PCC Meeting in Portland on June 12.)
