# Pork Barrel Threatens ERP
## 
### DANIEL DE LUCE 
PARIS, April 19 (/P) — American
administrators of the European Re
covery Program are in a constant
fight to save it from becoming a
pork barrel.
The pressure on them to subsidize
special interests on both sides of the
Atlantic is intense.
Their continental headquarters is
the elegant Palais de Talleyrand in
Paris. Some days they could use a
storm cellar to escape from lobby
ists.
Three factors have helped
strengthen the recovery plans of the
European Recovery Program:
1. The integrity of key officials in
the Economic Cooperation Adminis
tration, a U.S. governmental agency
which controls the ERP.
2. The watchdog attitude of Con
gress, which keeps ERP on a year
to-year basis.
I{. The sharing of planning and
impi e m entation responsibilities
among 19 European governmental
regimes, each on guard against ex
cessive demands bv the others.

The Economic Cooperation Ad
; ministration tugs on guide reins
in an effort to keep participant
I countries headed toward recovery.
ECA officials seem devoted to the
{ ideal of a sound economic integra
tion of Western Europe. Obviously
they hope Congress will let them
have three years more to try to fin -
i ish the job.
Yet when an angry senator de
clares it's silly to keep on giving
away American dollars to other
countries, his speech reinforces ECA
abroad, regardless of the effect in
Congress.
For ECA tells Europeans again
and again: "Get your continent in
order quickly. After 1952, gift dol
lars will be as scarce as the Dodo.
In fact, sooner, if you don't watch
| out."
A second guide rein of ECA is
the counter-part fund, a sum in its
1 own currency which an individual
country puts up to equal gift-aid
from ERP. The sum is derived from
the domestic sale at regular market
prices of supplies bought with ERP
• dollars.
