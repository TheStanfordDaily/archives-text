# Lag Water Hope Sinks
## 
### 
Suffering its greatest water loss of
the present season, Lake Lagunita
dropped two and one-half million
gallons yesterday and a similar
amount on Tuesday.
Assistant Engineer Carl Maier re
ported last night that the lake is
now 94 million gallons lull, some 24
million gallons below capacity.
At the present time, total rainfall
for the '48-'49 season amounts to
11.47 inches, 1.37 inches above last
year's total at this date.
However, Maier pointed out,
some 2.5 inches fell last year be
tween April 19 and the end of May,
bringing last year's total seasonal
figue to 12.49 inches.
Right now precipitation is not too
far above last year's total, and Cor
poration Yard officials feel that this
may be another dry year. There is
no speculation as to the probability
of additional seasonal rainfall.
Last year, 1.63 inches of concen
trated rainfall was necessary to
bring the lake up 20 million gallons
to its Highest filling point of 50 mil
lion gallons, less than half its ca
pacity.
At the present time, with a deficit
of 24 million, a minimum of 1.5
.inches of steady rain is necessary
for filling. Small, scattered rains, a
Corp Yard official said, would only
soak into the ground, making any
runoff into Searsville and thence
Lagunita impossible.
