# Peoples of Eastern Europe Must Revolt If Freedom Is To Be Recovered from Reds
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
For Western Europe, the price of
freedom is everyday watchfulness
and ever-improving defense. For
Eastern Europe, freedom is some
thing which must be bought back—
at the price of revolt.
Revolt is a two-syllable word easy
| to pronounce — but impossible to
| begin if people refuse to undertake
it. And should it be initiated, revolt
is useless and hopeless if the means
to carry it out nre insufficient.
People in Eastern Europe know
I that, and so far they have shown no
eagerness to revolt. Three main
I reasons are behind their refusal:
1. The West has too often incited \
them to revolt, and too many times I
deceived them at the critical mo- '
; ment.
2. A Western victory could put j
the Germans back into Eastern Eu
-1 rope.
3. It could also mean a return to
the regime of land feudalism and
huge estates.
Eastern Europe has convincing
arguments to back up its position.
Deception: Poles never miss the
opportunity of reminding Western- 1
ers of Poland's helplessness i
squeezed as she is between Russia i
and Germany. They also cite a
number of embarrassing dates: 1740.
1772. 1863. 1939. 1944. Did the friend- j
ly West ever succeed in saving |
them? And Poles conclude by re
peating their centuries-old saying |
which never sounds old-fashioned: '
"God is too high, and France is too j
far."
As for Czechs, they remember i
Munich and the betrayal of 1

1938. And did the West do more
for them last year? Yugoslavs can
tell how Mikhailovitch, the first
guerilla leader in Nazi-occupied Eu
rope, was jettisoned by the Allies in
favor of the Tito group, who eveti-

tually put him to
'jdeath.
J Secondly, there
.is the fact that
ifour years after
'the end of the
war the Germans
I have not been in
egrated into the
European com
il nunity. On the
| ontrary, they are
i blackmailing the

West by threatening to pass over to
Communism if their various de
mands are not met. Not only do
they loudly proclaim their will to
get back the territories taken over
by Poland, but they object to the
expulsion of the trouble-making Su
detens from Czechoslovakia.
Finally, in the matter of land re
form, Hungarian peasants who were
dominated for centuries by about
1.0(H) families of big landowners, are
not anxious to give up (he small
private parcels of land they have
recently acquired. The Poles feel
the same way.
Such are the odds with which a
Western-sponsored revolt of East
ern Europe is confronted. They are
heavy, but can be overcome.
Iu order to regain the confidence
it has lost, the Western democracies
should not call Eastern Europe to
a premature revolt which would be
easily crushed by the Communist

regimes, now firmly entrenched. For
the time being, the West should
profit by the present truce to build
up an organized underground net
work in Eastern Europe and to
smuggle in more arms to the poten
tial guerrillas behind the Iron Cut
tain.
Regarding Germany, we should
not encourage any nationalist feel
ings, even if they seem to be di
rected against the Russians, because
the true policy of the German na
tionalists has been to seek alliance
with Russia. While the West has
nothing to offer, Russia is the only
power with which Germany can
"make a deal." Great Germans such
as Frederick the Great and Bis
marck always abided by that rule,
whereas Wilhelm II and Hitler dis
regarded it, and consequently went
to their ruin.
To be sure, Germany cannot be
rubbed out of the map of Europe.
Its co-operation is needed, its re
covery is essential to put Western
Europe back on its feet. But the co
operation of Eastern Europe is at
least as important.
Finally, the Allies should not ap
pear to contest land reforms and
nationalizations. Above all, they
should not fumble away the new ad
vantages they are now gaining
through the unpopular Soviet policy
of transforming those new individual
holdings into collective kohkhozes.
Western propaganda could also ex
ploit with profit Russia's failure to
help Czechoslovakia carry out its
two-year plan, a failure which re
sulted in a severe economic depres
sion.

at the price of revolt.
Revolt is a two-syllable word easy
| to pronounce — but impossible to
| begin if people refuse to undertake
it. And should it be initiated, revolt
is useless and hopeless if the means
to carry it out nre insufficient.
People in Eastern Europe know
I that, and so far they have shown no
eagerness to revolt. Three main
I reasons are behind their refusal:
1. The West has too often incited \
them to revolt, and too many times I
deceived them at the critical mo- '
; ment.
2. A Western victory could put j
the Germans back into Eastern Eu
-1 rope.
3. It could also mean a return to
the regime of land feudalism and
huge estates.
Eastern Europe has convincing
arguments to back up its position.
Deception: Poles never miss the
opportunity of reminding Western- 1
ers of Poland's helplessness i
squeezed as she is between Russia i
and Germany. They also cite a
number of embarrassing dates: 1740.
1772. 1863. 1939. 1944. Did the friend- j
ly West ever succeed in saving |
them? And Poles conclude by re
peating their centuries-old saying |
which never sounds old-fashioned: '
"God is too high, and France is too j
far."
As for Czechs, they remember i
Munich and the betrayal of 1

1938. And did the West do more
for them last year? Yugoslavs can
tell how Mikhailovitch, the first
guerilla leader in Nazi-occupied Eu
rope, was jettisoned by the Allies in
favor of the Tito group, who eveti-

tually put him to
'jdeath.
J Secondly, there
.is the fact that
ifour years after
'the end of the
war the Germans
I have not been in
egrated into the
European com
il nunity. On the
| ontrary, they are
i blackmailing the

West by threatening to pass over to
Communism if their various de
mands are not met. Not only do
they loudly proclaim their will to
get back the territories taken over
by Poland, but they object to the
expulsion of the trouble-making Su
detens from Czechoslovakia.
Finally, in the matter of land re
form, Hungarian peasants who were
dominated for centuries by about
1.0(H) families of big landowners, are
not anxious to give up (he small
private parcels of land they have
recently acquired. The Poles feel
the same way.
Such are the odds with which a
Western-sponsored revolt of East
ern Europe is confronted. They are
heavy, but can be overcome.
Iu order to regain the confidence
it has lost, the Western democracies
should not call Eastern Europe to
a premature revolt which would be
easily crushed by the Communist

regimes, now firmly entrenched. For
the time being, the West should
profit by the present truce to build
up an organized underground net
work in Eastern Europe and to
smuggle in more arms to the poten
tial guerrillas behind the Iron Cut
tain.
Regarding Germany, we should
not encourage any nationalist feel
ings, even if they seem to be di
rected against the Russians, because
the true policy of the German na
tionalists has been to seek alliance
with Russia. While the West has
nothing to offer, Russia is the only
power with which Germany can
"make a deal." Great Germans such
as Frederick the Great and Bis
marck always abided by that rule,
whereas Wilhelm II and Hitler dis
regarded it, and consequently went
to their ruin.
To be sure, Germany cannot be
rubbed out of the map of Europe.
Its co-operation is needed, its re
covery is essential to put Western
Europe back on its feet. But the co
operation of Eastern Europe is at
least as important.
Finally, the Allies should not ap
pear to contest land reforms and
nationalizations. Above all, they
should not fumble away the new ad
vantages they are now gaining
through the unpopular Soviet policy
of transforming those new individual
holdings into collective kohkhozes.
Western propaganda could also ex
ploit with profit Russia's failure to
help Czechoslovakia carry out its
two-year plan, a failure which re
sulted in a severe economic depres
sion.

For Western Europe, the price of
freedom is everyday watchfulness
and ever-improving defense. For
Eastern Europe, freedom is some
thing which must be bought back—
at the price of revolt.
