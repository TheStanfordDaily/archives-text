(Editor's Note: This is the second of a series of articles on Varitype
offset printing. Today's article describes the flexibility oi" the method.)
Varitype-offset printing is a flexible process because editorial
and business personnel may use more variety in picture and
advertising display.
Take the case of news photos as an example:
Monday night a Daily photographer, Dave Rosenthal, snapped

: a picture of the trench digger that
Encina and Toyon men had driven
to Branner Hall. After the picture
j was developed, it was sent to Red
wood City to be made into an en
graving. The finished product was
I returned to The Daily Tuesday
night, and it appeared in Wednes
day's paper.
With the offset printing method,
however, the picture could have
i taken as late as 11:15 p.m. Monday,
| and it would have appeared in
: Tuesday's Daily. A drawing or
! glossy photo is sufficient for repro-
I duction in a daily newspaper. En-
I graving costs are eliminated.
Another example of offset print
j ing flexibility will appear in the
| special May 6 Daily Fashion Edition,
( which is now being printed in South
I San Francisco.
; A number of the Fashion Edition
I illustrations have bt'en improved by
I ink sketches. If engravings had to
1 be made of such line drawings, the
! cost of production would have been


THE OFFSET PRESS shown above prints papers at greater speeds than
flatbed presses, such as The Daily's. Seven thousand eight-page papers
could be printed in two and a half hours by the off>et method, four
hours bv the flatbed method.
i doubled over the expense of regu
i lar photo halftones.
Newspaper, magazine, and pam
phlet pictures may be cut out and
: printed by the offset process without
1 buying engravings. Such material i<
pasted on the page layout just like
i any glossy photo.
I Offset printing means art files of
paper instead of lead would be kept
jby Tlie Daily. One file drawer
| would hold the same of
i photographs and drawings that now
occupies an entire corner of The
Daily Shack.
