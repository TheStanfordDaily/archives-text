# Tartar Trackmen Seek Six Firsts
## 
### 
Hersche! Smith, coach of Comp
ton College track, said yesterday
that his Tartars have a good chance
of taking six first places Saturday
when they invade Stanford for a
triangular meet with the Indians
and the Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco.
The Tartar mentor feels that Fred
Thompson can win the 440, A 1 Mejia
the century, Billy Anderson the
high and low hurdles, Daryl Butts
the high jump, and that the mile
relay could go to Compton.
Compton defeated Mexico last
week in a dual meet held in Mex
ico City, after losing a previous
meet to USC's Trojans.
