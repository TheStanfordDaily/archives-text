# Mermen Host Fullerton In Final Pre-Troy Splash
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's Card swimmers
take to the Encina pools at 3 this
afternoon to splash it out with one
of the finest junior college tank
teams in the country, that of Ful
lerton JC.
Tomorrow afternoon, same place
and time, the all-conquering In
dians will meet USC's Southland
supermen in the match that the en
tire Pacific Coast has been await
ing.
Today's festivities will probably
take place without the contribu
tions of one of Stanford's top relay
J contenders, Woody Hoogs, who is
j suffering from bronchitis. However.
it is expected thai Hoogs will see
' action in tomorrow's battle of the
century.
The junior collegians will be led
j into action by two lads who, in all
probability, will become national
champions in their respective spe
cialties in the pending national JC
meet at the College of the Pacific.
Opposing Card ace Ralph Sala in
lhe 220 and 440 free-style events
will he Jack Thomas, who won both
i races in the recent Fullerton-UCLA
! affair.
The other headline performer for
the boys from the deep south is
j Ernie Polte, who likewise outsped
the best the Bruins had to offer in
his specialty, the 200-yard breast
stroke.
