## On The Bench 
### 
When, on the afternoon of April 30, the ever-mighty USC cinder squad
pays a visit to our trolley less little Farm, track fans will not only see a
meeting of the Coast's—and perhaps the nation's—two top track teams,
but also a clash of two of the most predominant systems of track coaching:
what is called the "Templeton" system, as opposed to the "Cromwell"
system. The former, used by our own Jack Weiershauser, has been de
scribed as "Work, work, work, and get in shape. Then work some more.
Push 'em from the start, and when they get tired, push 'em some more."
Jess Hill's Trojau team, however, is still following the formula of the
recently retired Dean Cromwell: "Get the material, tell 'em they're good,
and let nature take its course."
For the past umpteen and a half years, needless to point out. the Tro
jan-fellas have pretty consistently won track meets on Stanford's and
anybody else's oval. "Why," asked the guy playing the pinball machine
at Mora's, "don't we scrap the old Dink's system and make like SC?"
The reasons for this are many and, I think, good. First and foremost is
that the famed Cromwell system is dependent entirely on the USC pro
curement system—which Stanford doesn't have. Over GO former USC
athletes are in positions of responsibility in the coaching system of South
land high schools. To each and every worthy (i.e., good) prep trackster
in these schools, the Trojan alum beats the drum for Figueroa Tech.
And whether or not you San Franciscans or Washtngtonians like to admit
it or not. it is the biy, bad Southland that is the heart i'o the prep track
world. In short, USC has a tetter track "farm system" than anybody—
the Cleveland Indians included.
Another great stepping-stone to Trojan track victory is their grant
in-aid setup. Every school gives grants to a few of their more promising
athletes. Right now even Stanford has six men on the spike team who
own grants-in-aid. Please compare our six with El Trojan's thirty-two
(32, count 'em) who are gravying it via the grants. That is to say, a week
from Saturday, Stanford track fans will watch an average of three "aided"
Trojan tracksters in each running event.
Unless my shadowy mathematics fail me completely, this means that
—figuring USC tuition at $580 per year (which it is) —El Trojan is
kicking out a cool $18,5l»0 per year just to win track meets. And this is
just in the tuition column and doesn't attempt to add in the other little
"courtesies" that SC has somehow become noted for bestowing upon their
talented but seemingly under-privileged athletes.
Stanford, on the other hand, is the proud possessor of difficulties. Our
entrance requirements are such that it is estimated that only one out o!
every 1G high school athletes can get in. And that one must be sold on
the idea that he wants to expend $600 per year for tuition. The life of a
coach at Stanford is not a happy one—at least along procurement lines.
The Cromwell system, then, is not in my opinion one "of true coaching,
but one of eager enlistment of athletes of great ability. Aud. beJieve me s
it is darn hard to find a good substitute for ability. Two sterling examples
of what I mean will be seen up here next week. Bob Chambers holds
the National High School 880 record of 1:54.4 which, in case you don't
know, is slightly faster than lickety-splicketv. Pell-Mel Patton, of Time
Magazine cover fame, ran about 21.9 in the 220 and was blasting the
blazes out of 10-flat in the century in his happy high school days. Give
me material like that, and I could coach at USC and win track meets.
Dink Templeton in the '30s and now "Slave-drivin'" Jack Weier
shauser saw only too clearly that the much-talked-about-but-never-seen
Stanford Board of Trustees would collectively die of horror if anyone
tried to inaugurate any of the simple, but costly, procurement procedures
that have proved so successful at the southern school.
Thus, their work became one of getting the guys in shape before the
season started, and then spend the week days of the season coaching them
on the technical matters. And, considering they were —and are—dealing
with men who for the most part are worse than "good" in high school, this
has proved quite a job.
But it is a job that should give some satisfaction to these two worthy
gentlemen. For although the cinder path victories over SC have been
few and far between, the "Templeton" system has made fine contenders
out of men who were not so beforehand. A good example of this is miler
Al Lyons, who has piled up 25 points for Stanford running the distances
in the last three meets. Al came to Stanford as an eager kid from Idaho
who ran a darn slow mile compared with college or even Southland prep
four-lapmen. Through the "slave-driving" system of Coach Weiershauser
Lyons has taken 25 seconds off his high school mile time. It shows per
sistence on Lyons' part, but it also shows mighty fine coaching on some
body's part. And I doubt that USC, with all their track might, can poini
out anything comparable to it.
In my opinion. Cromwell and USC have simply cashed in on those
things that God and the Trojan Farm System have furnished them.
This column is not meant to be a preliminary apology for Stanford';
track and field loss to USC next week. No apology is necessary becaust
Stanford is going to beat the ever-mighty El Trojan next week. And—
piease note, Southland sports aplribes—the Indian team that will beat SC
will not be composed of greats, but largely of men who have
the desire to compete, know that they must improve, and have the coach
ing to let them improve.
There will be mighty good party-time on the old Ixdand Stanford
Junior Farm on the night of April 30.
