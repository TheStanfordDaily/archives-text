# Sad Sam, the Bench Jockey's Delight, To Make Farm Appearance Saturday
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Elevator Sam Barry, the bench
j jockey's pride and joy, will briny
| his Trojan baseballers to the Sunken
Diamond Saturday in the first
Tribe-Troy get-together of the cur
rent CIBA race.
USC's defending NCAA cham
pions, although lacking the strong
j armed Wally Hood, who carried
them to the collegiate title at Kala
| mazoo last summer, will neverthe
j less bring with them the best de
fensive record in the CIBA.
I A victory is a must for Harry YVol
: ter's men this week, but to make
j things tougher, Sam Barry's boys
| are in the same boat. Both squads
have had pennant aspirations, but
| are sitting slightly off the pace at
I the present time.
Harder and Oftener
j The Cards, who have been win
! ning mainly because they can hit

the ball harder and oftener than
their opponents, may have to
change their ways if they're going
to get by the defensive-minded
Trojans.
If the records mean anything,
Troy's pitching staff is the best in
the CIBA. The Figueroa mounds
men have given up 4, 5, 4, and 8
runs while breaking even in four
games.
Don Pender, a rubber-armed left
hander who couldn't make the var
sity at Manual Arts High School in
Eos Angeles, is the present ace of
the staff, but will probably be
wasted against Santa Clara Friday
night.
Might Be Sloppy
Thus, one of Barry's weak right
handers will get the nod against
Stanford. Either Jack "Sloppy"
Schlarb, Maynard Horst. or Dick
Fielder will fill that bill.
Elsewhere, Sad Sam has come up
with a pretty well-balanced club.
His keystone combo of Jim Bride
weser (shortstop) and Art Mazma
nian (second) is the fanciest duet in
the loop.
A quick run-down on the Troys,

judging from their first four CIBA
efforts, stacks up as follows:
The Spark
Jim Brideweser at short is the
spark of the club. He hits, fields,
and turns in a top effort every time
out. His running mate, Mazmaniaii
is well-known to Card fans, as last
year he spent three innings heat
edly discussing Trojan spirit with
the third-base bench jockeys.
On first base is Rudy llegalado, a
converted third-sacker who still
looks like a third-sacker. His hit
ting leaves nothing, to be desired.

; however, and Rudy is currently
| league's hottest willow-wielder, with
I a .500 average for IS trips to the
i plate.
At third. Hank Cedillo-, who has
played every position on the team,
is filling in. CediUos boasts a rifle -
arm, but his wood doesn't do much,
damage.
I Troy's best suit is in the outfie'. i

and i'ootbaher Jay Kound.v supply
