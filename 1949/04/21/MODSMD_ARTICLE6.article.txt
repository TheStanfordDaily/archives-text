# Living Units Will Stage Mock General Assembly
## 
### 
Plans are now being made for a
Model General Assembly of the
United Nations to be held at Stan
ford May 27.
The purpose of the model assem
bly, explained B. J. Denning, chair
man of Conference Committee of
the lIR, "is to illustrate some of
the basic problems that the General
Assembly faces in its daily sessions
in trying to achieve international
cooperation."
Each living group will send a
delegation to the assembly as if it
were a member of the United Na
tions. There will be four delegates
for each country, but larger living
groups may represent more thaÂ«
one country.
Living groups will sign up with
the Conference Committee to repre
sent a member of the UN in order
of preference. They will be given
their first choice of a country as far
as possible.
It is the responsibility of the indi
vidual houses for their delegation to
learn the attitude of the country
they are representing and to be able
to express the views of their par
ticular country at the assembly.
Delegations will be chosen by mem
bers of the living groups.
Foreign students will help as ad
visors to the delegates, while off
campus students will also send a
delegation. The conference com
mittee is inviting San Francisco con
suls as guests of their particular
delegations.
Anyone who is interested in
working with the Conference Com
mittee on this Model Assembly
should contact B. J. Denning at the
lIR Office, o: 15 to 5, Monday and
Friday, or 3:15 to 4, Tuesday and
Friday.
