A Stanford graduate, Dr. Isabel
M. Morgan, has been credited with
an important step in the fife'ht against
infantile paralysis. ,
In experiments financed by the
March of Dimes, Dr. Morgan and
her associates at Johns Hopkins
University have made far-reaching
discoveries which raise hopes for a
vaccine against polio.
The National Institute for Infan
tile Paralysis announced this week
that the experimentation has ad
vanced significantly beyond a re
port last summer which produced a
complete immunity in a high per
centage of rhesus monkeys.
