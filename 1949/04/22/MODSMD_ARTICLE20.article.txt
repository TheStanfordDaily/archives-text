## 
### 
If lauehs can bo converted to
points, Stanford swimmers will
swamp SC this afternoon. Last
night's swimming rally, sparked by
the inexhaustible wit of MC Dean
Borba, was a slightly hilarious af
fair.
Following a mock water polo
game and exhibition diving, clown
diving. "Sue Ray's Dance," and
clown swimming kept a large crowd
at the Encina Pool roaring for an
hour and a half.
Tom Elke foiled predictions by
making an appearance to put the
finishing touches on a riotous affair.
