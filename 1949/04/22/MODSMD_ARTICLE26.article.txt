## The
						Students Lose 
### 
Three weeks ago the ASSU student body president told
Excom that the University's Committee on Public Exercises was
not in favor of dismissing 11 o'clock classes May 10 for an elec
tion assembly.
In recent years the 11 a.m. time has been a customary one for
students to meet in the Memorial Auditorium to hear speeches
from candidates running for the top ASSU offices.
Thje committee suggested that the assembly be held at 1 p.m.
because tWe would be less loss of class time than at 11. A suc
eessjul assembly could be held in the afternoon, the members
believed..
During the March 30 Excom meeting, the students discussed
the problem. The group unanimously felt that the election pro
gram should be held at the 11 a.m. time because:
1. ,The time would be more convenient for the student body;
2. Instructors would not be set back by the loss of only one
hour's class time;
3. Since election assemblies usually last more than an hour,
the 11 a.m. scheduling would cut into the lunch hour when few
classes are held.
This week the Election Board chairman attended the Com
mittee on Public Exercises meeting. He relayed Excom's (hence,
lhe students') feelings about the assembly's programming.
A discussion followed, and it ended when the Committee
stood on its earlier recommendation that the assembly be held
in the afternoon when fewer classes would be affected.
The stubborn action of the Committee leaves a distasteful
opinion for the student body to digest.
We presented reasons why the morning hour was preferred.
But the Committee had already made up its mind three weeks
ago, and the reasons given by the Election Board chairman this
week were discarded.
