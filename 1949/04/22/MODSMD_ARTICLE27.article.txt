## Bull Session 
### 
Well let's face it: That time is here again. And don't pretend like
you don t know what I'm talking about. You know I mean midterms.
In case you re wondering, the word "midterm" comes from the Latin
and means: "Open up the guest room, mother, I may be home sooner

than you expected!"
Midterms really take a lot of concentrated thought.
I always say a fellow has never learned how to think
until he has taken a few midterms. And then it's too
late.
I've been studying so much lately that I'm getting
round-shouldered. My roommate has the same trouble,
but from a different cause. He's pinned to a short
girl. Speaking of girls, I'm flunking one course be
cause I spend every lecture period staring at the
girl next to me. Her face is her fortune. It runs

into a nice little figure, too.
I'm afraid my early-quarter night life is beginning to catch up with
me. Believe me, those beer-trains are really habit-forming. Last night
I was thrown out of the Library for studying under the table.
I'm a little worried about my midterm in Music I. The rest of the class
has been studying Beethoven's Fifth. Most of my work has been done
with Hiram Walker's fifth. Concerning Beethoven, we're supposed to have
a working knowledge of the score. I don't even know which team is
winning. I decided the other day that I've got to get a little more out
of the lectures. I even tried lo sit down in front, but I discovered I don't
bend that way. I think my music prof is studying numerology on the
side. He's sure £,ot my number.
My grades at Stanford have never been good because I got off on the
wrong foot with the registrar on my first day here. He objected to my
having my transcript printed on a toothbrush, and he wouldn't believe
that I transferred from Colgate.
I think my Poly Sci prof is also "out to get me." He's mad because
I bought a second-hand copy of his text book. How was I to know he
didn't mean my old man when he asked who is the speaker of the House?
When I finish that course, it will be a tossup as to whether I've had it
or vice versa.
The instructor is also peeved at me because I put one over on him
last week. I missed a pop quiz, and he told me he would give me three
days in which to make it up. I chose Thanksgiving, Christmas and New
Years.
But I'm not the only student who is having trouble with midterms.
One of the medical students in the house is studying for a test covering
the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs. It's not exactly a test; it's more of
ar. organ recital.

I think my Poly Sci prof is also "out to get me." He's mad because
I bought a second-hand copy of his text book. How was I to know he
didn't mean my old man when he asked who is the speaker of the House?
When I finish that course, it will be a tossup as to whether I've had it
or vice versa.
The instructor is also peeved at me because I put one over on him
last week. I missed a pop quiz, and he told me he would give me three
days in which to make it up. I chose Thanksgiving, Christmas and New
Years.
But I'm not the only student who is having trouble with midterms.
One of the medical students in the house is studying for a test covering
the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs. It's not exactly a test; it's more of
ar. organ recital.

Well let's face it: That time is here again. And don't pretend like
you don t know what I'm talking about. You know I mean midterms.
In case you re wondering, the word "midterm" comes from the Latin
and means: "Open up the guest room, mother, I may be home sooner

than you expected!"
Midterms really take a lot of concentrated thought.
I always say a fellow has never learned how to think
until he has taken a few midterms. And then it's too
late.
I've been studying so much lately that I'm getting
round-shouldered. My roommate has the same trouble,
but from a different cause. He's pinned to a short
girl. Speaking of girls, I'm flunking one course be
cause I spend every lecture period staring at the
girl next to me. Her face is her fortune. It runs

into a nice little figure, too.
I'm afraid my early-quarter night life is beginning to catch up with
me. Believe me, those beer-trains are really habit-forming. Last night
I was thrown out of the Library for studying under the table.
I'm a little worried about my midterm in Music I. The rest of the class
has been studying Beethoven's Fifth. Most of my work has been done
with Hiram Walker's fifth. Concerning Beethoven, we're supposed to have
a working knowledge of the score. I don't even know which team is
winning. I decided the other day that I've got to get a little more out
of the lectures. I even tried lo sit down in front, but I discovered I don't
bend that way. I think my music prof is studying numerology on the
side. He's sure £,ot my number.
My grades at Stanford have never been good because I got off on the
wrong foot with the registrar on my first day here. He objected to my
having my transcript printed on a toothbrush, and he wouldn't believe
that I transferred from Colgate.
