# Carnival Is Still May 7
## 
### 
The junior-sponsored Water Car
nival will still be he!d May 7.
Contrary to rumors that the Big
Weekend Water Carnival would be
moved up to April 29 because of the
loss of water in Lake Lagunita,
Mort White, junior class president,
announced that the event will take
place as originally scheduled.
White's statement was supported
by a report issued yesterday by As
sistant Engineer Carl Maier. Maier
said that the lake will be at a level
of spring '47 by May 7, and will not
be officially closed by that time.
''The lake will be shallow at the
edges, but there will be enough wa
ter to allow the carnival to take
place," Maier said.
The amount of seepage will not
increase, Maier continued, because
as the level drops there is less pres
sure and less land surface through
which the water may seep. Al
though very little water is coming
from Searsville at present, it is full
and rainfall may send additional
water to Lake Lagunita.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said the
lake would not be closed for health
reasons by May 7. The water will
remain relatively fresh until the
middle of May, at which time it
will be let out for irrigation pur
poses.
Information sheets about float
construction are available at the
ASSU office. Water Carnival chair
man Allen B'etz said. Saturday will
be the last day on which living
groups may sign up their float
themes.
