# Sunday Eve Show Is Award Winner
## 
### 
The Academy award - winning
picture of its year, "The Private
Life of Henry VIII," will be shown
on the Sunday Evening Movies this
week.
Charles Laughton takes the role
of the good king who is consistently
charmed by a pretty face. Merle
Oberon and Binnie Barnes enact his
most sexy and faithless wives, while
Elsa Lancaster steals the show as
his "ugly" wife from Germany.
Funniest scene is the bridal night
of Laughton and Elsa Lancaster.
Another chapter of "Crimson
Ghost" and a cartoon, "Rabbit
Punch" will also play.
