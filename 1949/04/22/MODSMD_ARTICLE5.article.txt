# FCC Proposal May Force KSU to Quit
## 
### MARY HILL 
'"KSU and other college radio sta
tions may be off the air by next
fall if they are forced to comply
with all standards of commercial
stations," said Bill Kane, KSU sta
tion manager.
The Federal Communications
Commission last week proposed
placing college "carrier current"
stations, such as KSU, under the
same regulations as commercial
broadcast stations. At present, sta
tions such as KSU are not licensed
or registered and may broadcast if
they do not interfere with any li
censed stations and if they do not
radiate beyond a few hundred feet.
The new regulations would con
cern time of broadcast, fequency al
locations, commercial practices, and
standards of timing and quality.
Alternatives Proposed
Several alternatives under the
proposed new regulations are:
1. Place campus stations in the
non-commercial FM bracket.
2. Ban campus stations entirely.
Place campus stations under
general broadcast rules.
4. Leave campus stations under
present low-power rules.
"Some change is necessary," stat
ed KSU Chief Engineer Frank La-
Fetra. "Under present regulations,

George Abraham, the national
chairman of the Intercollegiate
Broadcasting System, will discuss
the new college radio regulations
proposed by the Federal Commu
nications Commission at the West
ern IBS Conference here tomor
row. Abraham has iust come from
Washington, D.C., where he has
been in close touch with the FCC.

KSU must maintain almost four
miles of antenna line. This is a
difficult job." If KSU were placed
under general bioadcasU-rules, ei
ther the rules would have to be re
laxed or the station could not con
tinue operation.
'Carrier Current' Operation
The "carrier current" or "wired
wireless" station does not broadcast
from one transmitter as regular
commercial stations do. The station
can be heard only within a little
under 200 feet of the wires which
have been strung on campus.
'"We would prefer to broadcast
under low-power direct radiation,"
continued LaFetra. "In other words,
we would only broadcast from one
transmitter instead of four trans
mitters as now." KSU would then
be able to reach all students. Only
students living in houses specially
wired for KSU can now hear the
station.
The Commission invites reaction
from commercial broadcasters, ed
ucational institutions, and college
stations giving then views on the
worth of campus stations to the in
dustry. Deadline lor industry re
sponse is June 1.
Survey Planned
KSU will conduct a Hooper-type
survey this quarter to determine
campus interest. If the FCC finds
little campus interest, they may feel
justified in abolishing low - power
campus stations. Attempts now are
being made to gain statements from
commercial stations and educators
on the educational value of campus
radio.
The Intercollegiate Broadcasting
System has been charged by the
Commission to prepare a case for
college radio. IBS will try to hold
public hearings after June 1.
