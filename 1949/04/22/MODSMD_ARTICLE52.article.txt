## 
### 
Beach clothes of any description
will be the appropriate dress at En
cina Hall's "Big Swim" dance on
April 30.
The class of '52 will dance to the
music of Hal Mead, his band, and
his vocal group, The Three Jays,
from 9 to 1 in the Encina Lounge.
Added entertainment will be pro
vided during intermission by both
professional and campus perform
ers.
Tickets are being sold by Encina
social chairmen at $1.20 a couple.
Ed Brennan, publicity chairman,
suggests that couples go Dutch and
"get their money's worth out of the
affair," which is already being sub
sidized by profits from previous
dances.
