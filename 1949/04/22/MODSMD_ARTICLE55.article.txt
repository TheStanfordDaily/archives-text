# San Mateo Trips Frosh Horsehiders
## 
### 
The tumble had to come, and it
finaMy did—in the form of a 7-3
shellacking which the Stanford
freshman baseballers absorbed at
the hands of an explosive San Ma
teo JC outfit yesterday at the locals'
diamond.
San Mateo iced the game in the
first inning with a 4-hit 4-run out
burst. This show of power included
two triples and a double.
Rog Osenbaugh, starting Card
chucker, yielded three more tallies
in the second and another in the
sixth to complete the JC scoring. It
must be said for Rog, however, that
he stuck it out for the route and
improved so much as the game pro
gressed that he was untouchable at
the finish.
The Papooses made a belated at
tempt to get back in the contest in
the eighth inning. But after two
runs were in with the bases loaded,
an untimely double play ended the
rally.
The game frosh tried again in the
ninth but could do no better than
one run to end the contest.
Osenbaugh. despite the numerous
runners on the basepaths, chalked
up 15 strikeouts—a creditable per
formance in any league.
