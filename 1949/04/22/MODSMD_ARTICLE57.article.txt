# Card Cindermen Face Compton, Olympic Club
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Coach Jack Weiershauser s undefeated Indian cindermen
clash with the up-and-coming Compton College Tartars, probably
the strongest junior college track team in the country, and the
San Francisco Olympic Club in a triangular meet at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon. The field events start at 1:45, and
the mile at 2. I —

The meet was originally sched
uled to be a regular dual contest
with the Olympic Club, but the
Compton Tartars challenged Stan
i tord to a meet, and since the Indian
schedule was already full, they
asked the Tartars to compete in a
triangular meet with the Olympic-
Club.
Since Compton is tops in the run
ning events, where the Olympic
| Club is the weakest, the Card track
oters may have to perform in top
style to beat the rampaging Tartars.
; The strong Compton team scored 55
points off USC only two weeks ago,

indicating that they have plenty of
strength and depth.
Indian Aces Get Tests
Some of the best duels of the year
are anticipated tomorrow, when un
defeated Indians Bud Held, captain
Larry Hoff. and Gay Bryan will get
their stiffest tests ol the year.
Held, who broke the all - time
Stanford mark in the javelin last
week, will meet the Olympic Club's
Martin Biles, who also has been
credited with a heave of over 225
leet this year.
Meet captain Larry Hoff. who is
undefeated in the 440. will receive
plenty of trouble from Compton's
T red Thompson. Thompson, the
Tartars' best quarter-miler in many
years, won the SC meet in the fast
time of 48.4 seconds. Pitch John
son and Cass Bly of the Cards won't
be far behind the two leaders, and
could upset the favorites.
Bryan Faces Tough One
Iron-man Gay Bryan will get a
sample of what is in store for him
against USC when he competes to
morrow. His toughest test probably
will be in the low hurdles, where he
will meet Bill Anderson, who has
hurdled the barriers in 23.1. USC's
Ronnie Frazer has done just as well
as Anderson, and if Gay has the
stuff to win this race, the Stanford
stock in the USC meet will take
a sudden rise.
Bryan also will compete against
two top - flight high jumpers in
Compton's Daryl Butts and Rich
ard Gragson, both of whom have
cleared 6 ft. 5 in.
The Stanford ace will be pressed
again in the sprints, even though
Compton's star Bill Fell will not run
tomorrow. Albert Mejia and Bol:
Smith have both run 9.8 in the
century.
Anderson Has Fast Time
Veteran Downing McKee ma>
have to hit 14.2 to beat Compton'.'
Billy Anderson in the high hurdles
The Tartar flash has been credited
with a fast 14.1 recently, but may
be slowed down on the wind-blowr
Stanford oval.
The Olympic Club's national dis
cus champ, Fortune Gordien, wil.
be worth the price of admission
Gordien threw the platter 173 ft
9 in. aaginst San Jose State a couple
of weeks ago, which is only sevei
feet short of the world's record.
Compton also has an excellent
discus man, Sim Iness, former team
mate of Bob Mathias at Tulare
Iness has been regularly throwing
in the high 150's, and could be
ready to unload tomorrow. Hug!"
Mumby of the Olympic Club will
provide stiff competition to Stan
ford's plattermen Steve McKee and
Otis Chandler.
lioluhar Favored
Former Stanford trackman A 1 Hu
lubar of the Olympic Club will hi
favored to grab the half-mile event
trailed by Indians George Mooer>
and Drew Terramorse. Holubar w.u
declared ineligible at the beginning
of the season, and since then has
been wearing the Olympic CI u i
banners. He is capable of I:*> 4 to
morrow.
Card distance man A 1 Lyons \vi.
be pressed heavily by Compton'
Jerome Walters, who has a bes
mark in the 4:23'5. The Comptoi
miler ran second to USC s Bel
Chambers two Saturdays ago. Tin

Lyons, unless the Olympic Club';
Bill Coughlin or Stanford's Joh
Rael shows sudden improvement.
Chandler in a Warm-up
It will be merely a warm-up toi
shot putters Otis Chandler and
Davis when they compete tomor

this event, and wili fight it out witi

broad jumper, will return to ac

FRED FANK, steady Stanford
broad jumper, will return to ac
tion tomorrow in the triangular
track meet with Compton College
and the Olympic Club, after a few
weeks' layoff with a bad knee.
Coach Jack Weiershauser s undefeated Indian cindermen
clash with the up-and-coming Compton College Tartars, probably
the strongest junior college track team in the country, and the
San Francisco Olympic Club in a triangular meet at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon. The field events start at 1:45, and
the mile at 2. I —

The meet was originally sched
uled to be a regular dual contest
with the Olympic Club, but the
Compton Tartars challenged Stan
i tord to a meet, and since the Indian
schedule was already full, they
asked the Tartars to compete in a
triangular meet with the Olympic-
Club.
Since Compton is tops in the run
ning events, where the Olympic
| Club is the weakest, the Card track
oters may have to perform in top
style to beat the rampaging Tartars.
; The strong Compton team scored 55
points off USC only two weeks ago,

indicating that they have plenty of
strength and depth.
Indian Aces Get Tests
Some of the best duels of the year
are anticipated tomorrow, when un
defeated Indians Bud Held, captain
Larry Hoff. and Gay Bryan will get
their stiffest tests ol the year.
Held, who broke the all - time
Stanford mark in the javelin last
week, will meet the Olympic Club's
Martin Biles, who also has been
credited with a heave of over 225
leet this year.
Meet captain Larry Hoff. who is
undefeated in the 440. will receive
plenty of trouble from Compton's
T red Thompson. Thompson, the
Tartars' best quarter-miler in many
years, won the SC meet in the fast
time of 48.4 seconds. Pitch John
son and Cass Bly of the Cards won't
be far behind the two leaders, and
could upset the favorites.
Bryan Faces Tough One
Iron-man Gay Bryan will get a
sample of what is in store for him
against USC when he competes to
morrow. His toughest test probably
will be in the low hurdles, where he
will meet Bill Anderson, who has
hurdled the barriers in 23.1. USC's
Ronnie Frazer has done just as well
as Anderson, and if Gay has the
stuff to win this race, the Stanford
stock in the USC meet will take
a sudden rise.
Bryan also will compete against

broad jumper, will return to ac
tion tomorrow in the triangular
track meet with Compton College
and the Olympic Club, after a few
weeks' layoff with a bad knee.
Coach Jack Weiershauser s undefeated Indian cindermen
clash with the up-and-coming Compton College Tartars, probably
the strongest junior college track team in the country, and the
San Francisco Olympic Club in a triangular meet at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow afternoon. The field events start at 1:45, and
the mile at 2. I —

The meet was originally sched
uled to be a regular dual contest
with the Olympic Club, but the
Compton Tartars challenged Stan
i tord to a meet, and since the Indian
schedule was already full, they
asked the Tartars to compete in a
triangular meet with the Olympic-
Club.
Since Compton is tops in the run
ning events, where the Olympic
| Club is the weakest, the Card track
oters may have to perform in top
style to beat the rampaging Tartars.
; The strong Compton team scored 55
points off USC only two weeks ago,

indicating that they have plenty of
strength and depth.
Indian Aces Get Tests
Some of the best duels of the year
are anticipated tomorrow, when un
defeated Indians Bud Held, captain
Larry Hoff. and Gay Bryan will get
their stiffest tests ol the year.
Held, who broke the all - time
Stanford mark in the javelin last
week, will meet the Olympic Club's
Martin Biles, who also has been
credited with a heave of over 225
leet this year.
Meet captain Larry Hoff. who is
undefeated in the 440. will receive
plenty of trouble from Compton's
T red Thompson. Thompson, the
Tartars' best quarter-miler in many
years, won the SC meet in the fast
time of 48.4 seconds. Pitch John
son and Cass Bly of the Cards won't
be far behind the two leaders, and
could upset the favorites.
Bryan Faces Tough One
Iron-man Gay Bryan will get a
sample of what is in store for him
against USC when he competes to
morrow. His toughest test probably
will be in the low hurdles, where he
will meet Bill Anderson, who has
hurdled the barriers in 23.1. USC's
Ronnie Frazer has done just as well
as Anderson, and if Gay has the
stuff to win this race, the Stanford
stock in the USC meet will take
a sudden rise.
Bryan also will compete against
two top - flight high jumpers in
Compton's Daryl Butts and Rich
ard Gragson, both of whom have
cleared 6 ft. 5 in.
The Stanford ace will be pressed
again in the sprints, even though
Compton's star Bill Fell will not run
tomorrow. Albert Mejia and Bol:
Smith have both run 9.8 in the
century.
Anderson Has Fast Time
Veteran Downing McKee ma>
have to hit 14.2 to beat Compton'.'
Billy Anderson in the high hurdles
The Tartar flash has been credited
with a fast 14.1 recently, but may
be slowed down on the wind-blowr
Stanford oval.
The Olympic Club's national dis
cus champ, Fortune Gordien, wil.
be worth the price of admission
Gordien threw the platter 173 ft
9 in. aaginst San Jose State a couple
of weeks ago, which is only sevei
feet short of the world's record.
Compton also has an excellent
discus man, Sim Iness, former team
mate of Bob Mathias at Tulare
Iness has been regularly throwing
in the high 150's, and could be
ready to unload tomorrow. Hug!"
Mumby of the Olympic Club will
provide stiff competition to Stan
ford's plattermen Steve McKee and
Otis Chandler.
lioluhar Favored
Former Stanford trackman A 1 Hu
lubar of the Olympic Club will hi
favored to grab the half-mile event
trailed by Indians George Mooer>
and Drew Terramorse. Holubar w.u
declared ineligible at the beginning
of the season, and since then has
been wearing the Olympic CI u i
banners. He is capable of I:*> 4 to
morrow.
Card distance man A 1 Lyons \vi.
be pressed heavily by Compton'
Jerome Walters, who has a bes
mark in the 4:23'5. The Comptoi
miler ran second to USC s Bel
Chambers two Saturdays ago. Tin
two - mile looks like a breeze toi
Lyons, unless the Olympic Club';
Bill Coughlin or Stanford's Joh
Rael shows sudden improvement.
Chandler in a Warm-up
It will be merely a warm-up toi
shot putters Otis Chandler and
Davis when they compete tomor
row. Olympic Club's Fortune Gor
dien will probably double up '•
this event, and wili fight it out witi
the Cards' Norm Noursc for thirc
and fourth places,


FRED FANK, steady Stanford
broad jumper, will return to ac
tion tomorrow in the triangular
track meet with Compton College
and the Olympic Club, after a few
weeks' layoff with a bad knee.
