# Trojan, Stanford Nines Clash in Crucial Game
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's baseball Indians, working on a 3-3 CIBA record,
vill settle down this weekend to do battle with the powerful
JSC Trojans.
Sam Barry's defending champions will stop in San Jose to
light to face Santa Clara, and then will invade the Sunken Dia-

nond at 3:15 tomorrow to hook up
vith the Cards.
Both Trojans and Indians are
ieadlocked in thii'd place in league ;
landings, each club boasting a .500
ecord. Troy earned its 2-2 status
jy dumping UCLA twice after drop- |
)ing a pair to Santa Clara.
Stanford, still hoping to reach the !
op of the collegiate peak, will shoot J
he works tomorrow in an effort to
vin its fourth.
Stott on the Mound
Lanky Dave Stott will get the
>pening nod on the hill. It will be !
lis first league start since his Cali- j
ornia win several weeks ago.
Troy will use its number one !
lurler, southpaw Don Pander,
igainst Santa Clara tonight, so that
neans Trojan number two boy Jack j
jchlarb will get the Stanford as- j
ignment.
Schlarb is a fastballer with stuff. ;
>ut his wild streaks make him un- j
iredictable.
Stanford will rely mainly on its
litting, just as it has done in every
;ame so far this season.
Expected to lead the attack, is
Masting Bob Nava, a handy sticker
o have against, the Trojans. Last
eason, Nava almost salvaged one
JSC game single-handedly when
ie rammed out a homer, a double,
nd a single in three trips to drive
a five runs.
But the Trojans went on to win
hat one and also to sweep the !
hree-game series.
But tomorrow marks the first 1949 i
leeting between the two clubs, and !
he Tribe will be out to make a j
ew changes.
Indians Strong in Hitting
The Indians are much stronger i
/ith the wood, and better defen- ;
ive'.v than a year ago, but still must J
/orry about their pitching.
Wolter's shabby mound corps has
0 far kept Stanford from the top '
pot in the pennant race, but Dave
Itott could start things rolling the
ther way.
Stott is not a spectacular chucker,
•ut he combines a good head with
its of determination to trap most
pposing batsmen. Ready to back
im up are Jim Claypool, who saved
he last Santa Clara game, and
,efty Dave Dahle.
Highlighting this first Tribe-Troy
et-together of the season will be
he appearance of USC's batting
ing, Rudolph Valentino Regalado,
home-run artist who handles the
litial sack. Valentino Regalado
las pumped out three home runs
1 four games.
Other Trojans who bear watching
re Jim Brideweser, all - league
hortstop; Art Mazmanian, fast
alking second - sacker, and Bill
Iharman, basketba'.ling rightfielder.

In other CIBA games this week,
JSC tackles Santa Clara tonight
nd California meets St. Mary's to
morrow.
Stanford's baseball Indians, working on a 3-3 CIBA record,
vill settle down this weekend to do battle with the powerful
JSC Trojans.
Sam Barry's defending champions will stop in San Jose to
light to face Santa Clara, and then will invade the Sunken Dia-

nond at 3:15 tomorrow to hook up
vith the Cards.
Both Trojans and Indians are
ieadlocked in thii'd place in league ;
landings, each club boasting a .500
ecord. Troy earned its 2-2 status
jy dumping UCLA twice after drop- |
)ing a pair to Santa Clara.
Stanford, still hoping to reach the !
op of the collegiate peak, will shoot J
he works tomorrow in an effort to
vin its fourth.
Stott on the Mound
Lanky Dave Stott will get the
>pening nod on the hill. It will be !
lis first league start since his Cali- j
ornia win several weeks ago.
Troy will use its number one !
lurler, southpaw Don Pander,
igainst Santa Clara tonight, so that
neans Trojan number two boy Jack j
jchlarb will get the Stanford as- j
ignment.
Schlarb is a fastballer with stuff. ;
>ut his wild streaks make him un- j
iredictable.
Stanford will rely mainly on its
litting, just as it has done in every
;ame so far this season.
Expected to lead the attack, is
Masting Bob Nava, a handy sticker
o have against, the Trojans. Last
eason, Nava almost salvaged one
JSC game single-handedly when
ie rammed out a homer, a double,
nd a single in three trips to drive
a five runs.
But the Trojans went on to win
hat one and also to sweep the !
hree-game series.
But tomorrow marks the first 1949 i
leeting between the two clubs, and !
he Tribe will be out to make a j
ew changes.
Indians Strong in Hitting
The Indians are much stronger i
/ith the wood, and better defen- ;
ive'.v than a year ago, but still must J
/orry about their pitching.
Wolter's shabby mound corps has
0 far kept Stanford from the top '
pot in the pennant race, but Dave
Itott could start things rolling the
ther way.
Stott is not a spectacular chucker,
•ut he combines a good head with
its of determination to trap most
pposing batsmen. Ready to back
im up are Jim Claypool, who saved
he last Santa Clara game, and
,efty Dave Dahle.
Highlighting this first Tribe-Troy
et-together of the season will be
he appearance of USC's batting
ing, Rudolph Valentino Regalado,
home-run artist who handles the
litial sack. Valentino Regalado
las pumped out three home runs
1 four games.
Other Trojans who bear watching
re Jim Brideweser, all - league
hortstop; Art Mazmanian, fast
alking second - sacker, and Bill
Iharman, basketba'.ling rightfielder.
