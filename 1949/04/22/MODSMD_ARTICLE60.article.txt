# Tankmen Drown Fullerton JC, 39-36
## 
### 
Stanford's ace varsity swimming
team prepped for their crucial
match against Southern California
this afternoon with a 30-36 victory
over Fullerton JC at the Encina
Pool yesterday.
Fullerton,' last year's junior col
lege champs, proved surprisingly
strong, but the score was as close
as it was only because Coach Hay
nie decided to rest his stating relay
team going into that event.
The meet was clinched before the
relay was run off, so it did not make
! any difference when the second
| stringers lost the race and allowed
the score to end up so neighborly.
