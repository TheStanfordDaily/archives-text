# Dynamic Trojan-Indian Swimfest on Today Meet the Coaches
## 
### 
Meet the brains behind the brawn in this afternoon's crucial tankfest
at the Encina pools:
TOM' HAYNIE, personable Indian mentor, is definitely not the Doubt
ing Tom of allegorical fame. The balding Haynie has never failed to pre
dict a Card victory in his pre-meet interviews; and perhaps the over
whelming confidence of their coach has something to do with the Stan
ford crew's impressive 39-meet win streak.
Tom, who has been tutoring Farm mermen since 1946, was a two-time
intercollegiate 220 and 440 champ back in 1937 and 1938, and, in fact,
still holds the national 220 record of 2:09.7.
Although the top middle-distance men in the country have been shoot
ing at Haynie's mark with no success for more than 11 years now, Tom
feels certain that the record will be broken this year.
And who is going to do it?
"That's easy," says the former University of Michigan great, "either
Ralph Sala or VVally Wolf is sure to do it this year."
Which may, or may not, have been a final plug for today's meet—
which, needless to say, will be featured by the 220 and 440 races between
Sala and Wolf.
FRED CADY, he of the drooping eyelids and handle-bar mustache, is
probably best known for the diving champs he has turned out during his
21-year reign at the Southland school.
Among his former springboard pupils, Cady numbers such outstand
ing performers as Marjcrie Gestring (who later attended Stanford).
Georgia Coleman, Mickey Riley, and many more. As a matter of fact,
Fred has produced more national diving champs than any other coach in
our fair land.
Cady will probably be found this afternoon at his favorite perch in the
last row of the gallery, from which vantage point he views all his team's
meets.
He won't be hard to spot. Just look for a bald head and a set of three
quarter-closed eyelids situated atop a long, black mustache being twirled
at a furious pace, and that'll be Fred Cady—the Mr. Swim of Southern
California.


TOM HAYNIE, popular swim
ming mentor, will be very much
in evidence this afternoon as his
Iwiys go after the loaded Trojans.
Ilaynie isn't too frightened of the
L'SC reputation, however, and has
tabbed Stanford for a one-point
victory.

whelming confidence of their coach has something to do with the Stan
ford crew's impressive 39-meet win streak.
Tom, who has been tutoring Farm mermen since 1946, was a two-time
intercollegiate 220 and 440 champ back in 1937 and 1938, and, in fact,
still holds the national 220 record of 2:09.7.
Although the top middle-distance men in the country have been shoot
ing at Haynie's mark with no success for more than 11 years now, Tom
feels certain that the record will be broken this year.
And who is going to do it?
"That's easy," says the former University of Michigan great, "either
Ralph Sala or VVally Wolf is sure to do it this year."
Which may, or may not, have been a final plug for today's meet—
which, needless to say, will be featured by the 220 and 440 races between
Sala and Wolf.
FRED CADY, he of the drooping eyelids and handle-bar mustache, is
probably best known for the diving champs he has turned out during his
21-year reign at the Southland school.
Among his former springboard pupils, Cady numbers such outstand
ing performers as Marjcrie Gestring (who later attended Stanford).
Georgia Coleman, Mickey Riley, and many more. As a matter of fact,
Fred has produced more national diving champs than any other coach in
our fair land.
Cady will probably be found this afternoon at his favorite perch in the
last row of the gallery, from which vantage point he views all his team's
meets.
He won't be hard to spot. Just look for a bald head and a set of three
quarter-closed eyelids situated atop a long, black mustache being twirled
at a furious pace, and that'll be Fred Cady—the Mr. Swim of Southern
California.


TOM HAYNIE, popular swim
ming mentor, will be very much
in evidence this afternoon as his
Iwiys go after the loaded Trojans.
Ilaynie isn't too frightened of the
L'SC reputation, however, and has
tabbed Stanford for a one-point
victory.
