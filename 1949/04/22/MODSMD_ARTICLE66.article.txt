# New Banking System Will Safeguard Funds
## 
### 
Reasons why it will be obligatory
under the new Constitution for all
campus groups to bank through the
ASSU were explained yesterday by
Mark Hatfield, Constitution com
mittee member.
As the situation stands now, Hat
field said, banking with the general
fund is voluntary. Under the new
system, all campus organizations
except fraternities and eating clubs
must go through the ASSU.
Hatfield said there were two rea
sons why the Constitution commit
tee put this into the new document.
The first is that many groups have
in the past contracted debts which
they did not pay. This, he said, re
flects on the University and on oth
er campus organizations.
The other reason is that the AS
SU in this way provides a service
for students in that it protects them
from mismanagement of their funds.
The student manager will have
the power to deny requests for
funds only if there are insufficient
funds or if the group does not pre
sent proper receipts.
The student manager will defi
nitely not have control in any way
over the manner in which money is
expended, Hatfield emphasized. "If
Roble wants to buy a Pekinese dog.
no one can stop them if they have
the money," he said.
If the student manager should as
sume such authority, organizations
would have recourse to the Univer
sity financial manager, Excom, or
the president of the University.
