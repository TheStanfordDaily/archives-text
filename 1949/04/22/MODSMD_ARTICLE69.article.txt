Some cold fish are in for a hot
time at the hands of Dr. John Field,
Stanford professor of physiology.
Dr. Field has been doing research
on the Arctic Cod and other fish
and cold-blooded animals. The cod
are to be dropped into water the
temperature of the ocean off the
California coast.
To an Arctic Cod that's hot water.
The shock will probably cause a
fatal heat stroke in the fish. Fur
ther experiments by tempering the
water slowly may enable the fish
to survive.
The small effect of cold on the
metabolism of the cod enables it to
live in water several degrees below
freezing but will kill it in warmer
climes.
