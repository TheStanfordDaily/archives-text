# Leave Plan Discussed
## 
### 
AWS advisory board held a spe
cial meeting yesterday in line with
the new proposed late leaves now
under consideration. Because the
extra late leaves would offer in
creased leniency, it was felt that the
demerit system should be revised
slightly. The tightening-up policy,
announced by Nancy McDermoth,
AWS vice-president, includes the
following provisions:
1. Freshmen through seniors will
all be allowed the same number
of demerits, instead of the present
plan whereby the number ranges
from three to five. It is believed
that this will help avoid needless
confusion.
2. All women students will be
permitted only three demerits, to be
retroactive.
3. Bonus minutes will be abol
ished. As it now operates, the bonus
prevents the demerit system from
functioning effectively.
4. Demerits will continue to be
given for the same offenses as under
the present system.
The plan will go before AWS
cabinet Tuesday afternoon and will
be presented before ASSU Wed
nesday night. If passed, the provi
sions will be voted on by women's
living groups a week from Thurs
day.
