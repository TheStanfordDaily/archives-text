# Girls Await Residence Drawings Next Week
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
"Where are we going to live next
year?" will be the question most
undergraduate women want an
swered when they apply for a room
reservation during the week of May
The great variety of Stanford res
idences makes the quest more in
teresting and provides every girl
with the opportunity of living in
more than one type of house. Wom
en who wish to change their living
group (all girls in Roble are subject
to change) will fill out a residence
choice card, which will soon be
available in each house, indicating
their choice by number. Every girl
should put down at the very least
10 houses, and she is urged to
choose 15 to make the placements
less difficult.
Room assignments are deter
mined by the class of the girl and
the number she has drawn. Sen
iors are given first preference, then
juniors, and then sophomores (this
quarter, unlike other quarterly
drawings, every residence has va
cancies and a certain percentage of
all vacancies in each residence are
reserved for sophomores).
Thursday, May 12, on the lower
floor of the Women's Clubhouse, all

| students moving will draw num
j bers. Two girls may draw together
lor one number, but Housing Com
mittee explained that if only one
| vacancy was available the two
I drawing together would be given
; their next choice. Lowest numbers J
drawn will be given first prefer
ence.
Upper Division students remain
j ing in the drawing will be placed |
I May 14 - 16, and Lower Division
women will be placed on May 17.
i (Students are classified by their
units at the end of spring quarter:
senior, 130 or more; junior, 85-130;
sophomore, 40 or more.)
The actual assignment of rooms
is done by Mis;? Doyle's office and
l a subcommittee of Housing.
Housing Committee is planning a
| panel for freshman women in which
each type of living group will be
represented: one for the Lasuen
group (nine Row houses, where
girls' activities are centered in in
dividual houses); Union and Union
Units (six individual living groups
centered under # one big division,
Union); Lagunita, (combination of
individual houses connected under
one roof); and Branner (dormitory
system). Applicants for Casa Espa
nola will not draw, but will be cho
sen by the department.
Students have had an opportunity â€¢
to investigate the various residences
by means of open houses which
have been held this quarter and
last.
