# Frosh to Present First Quad Dance
## 
### 
The freshman class will score an
other "first' Friday night when the
class of '52 presents a free all
campus street dance. "The Streets of
Laredo. First of its kind ever tried
at Stanford, the dance will be held
directly in front of Memorial Court,
with the Quad and Memorial

Church as a backdrop.
'"Freshman Excom decided that
Stanford needed a new type of
campus dance—something different
than a Women's or Men's Gym affair
—so we chose this idea," explained
Jack White, frosh class president.
