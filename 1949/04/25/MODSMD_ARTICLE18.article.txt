### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, April 25 (AP) — Communist armies
walked into undefended Nanking yesterday and today snapped
shut a trap on 300,000 Nationalist soldiers between Shanghai and
Hangchow.
Red troops, rushing southward after their crossing of the

♦ Yangtze, bypassed Shanghai and
I captured Kashing, vital rail junc
j tion city, in a slash toward the sea.
At Kashing, 53 miles southwest of
' this largest Asian city, the Commu
nists cut the last rail escape route
1 for retreating government troops
pulling back on the big seaport ot
Hangchow, 100 miles southwest ui
; Shanghai.
The Reds were said to have fiOO.-
000 men in the gigantic operation.
The only report of Nationalist of
; fensive action was the strafing ot
i Nanking's inner airfield yesterday by
! three government planes. The Red's
said the planes overshot their mark
! and machine-gunned streets in the
capital, wounding several civilians.
The Communist radio announced
that Taiyuan, the so-called "Pitts
burg of China," was taken by storm
in a five-hour battle Sunday and
that all the 150,000 Nationalist de
fenders were wiped out.
An American aviator who flew
| over Taiyuan confirmed that the
j whole city was a smoking ruin.
Government opposition, however,
was almost non-existent, and
Shanghai listlessly awaited the Red
entry.
Government commanders reiter
ated that they will defend Shanghai
; to the last.
The streets were jammed all Sun
day with trucks, cars, rickshaws,
j pedicabs, and porters moving |>os
sessions to downtown warehouses,
• where they presumably would be
: safer.
Gen. Tang En-Po, defense com
j mander. was reported to have three
i armies around Shanghai, four ar
mies scattered west for 100 miles,
three more retreating southwest of
Nanking. (This would total about
300,000 men.)
Shanghai, behind its optimistical
( ly-built 35-mile wooden fence, was
not expected to become a battlefield
unless Tang should try to evacuate
his troops by sea. To prevent this,
the Reds could block the
River's narrow channel and attack
Woosung Fort, guarding the Whang -
po's confluence with the Yangtze
Estuary.

The only report of Nationalist of
; fensive action was the strafing ot
i Nanking's inner airfield yesterday by
! three government planes. The Red's
said the planes overshot their mark
! and machine-gunned streets in the
capital, wounding several civilians.
The Communist radio announced
that Taiyuan, the so-called "Pitts
burg of China," was taken by storm
in a five-hour battle Sunday and
that all the 150,000 Nationalist de
fenders were wiped out.
An American aviator who flew
| over Taiyuan confirmed that the
j whole city was a smoking ruin.
Government opposition, however,
was almost non-existent, and
Shanghai listlessly awaited the Red
entry.
Government commanders reiter
ated that they will defend Shanghai
; to the last.
The streets were jammed all Sun
day with trucks, cars, rickshaws,
j pedicabs, and porters moving |>os
sessions to downtown warehouses,
• where they presumably would be
: safer.
Gen. Tang En-Po, defense com
j mander. was reported to have three
i armies around Shanghai, four ar
mies scattered west for 100 miles,
three more retreating southwest of
Nanking. (This would total about
300,000 men.)
Shanghai, behind its optimistical
( ly-built 35-mile wooden fence, was
not expected to become a battlefield
unless Tang should try to evacuate
his troops by sea. To prevent this,
the Reds could block the
River's narrow channel and attack
Woosung Fort, guarding the Whang -
po's confluence with the Yangtze
Estuary.
