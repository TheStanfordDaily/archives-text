# Farm to Debate With USF Today
## 
### 
Stanford will participate in a
home-and-home debate with Uni
versity of San Francisco this eve
ning at 8. The debate here will be
he'd in Cubberley Auditorium.
Stanford's team of Arnold Klink
and Salvatort Bassio will argue the
affirmative side of the question
"Resolved, that President Truman's
civil rights program in so far as it
applies to Negroes should be adopt
ed."
The team traveling to San Fran
cisco will be Dave Leavitt and John
Morrow. They will uphold the neg
ative.
A telegram received yesterday
from West Point said that the team
from Stanford, composed of Ron
ald Klein and Forden Athearn, had
won three of eight debates in the
national tourney.
The tournament, won by Univer
sity of Alabama, was held at West
Point and 35 teams had entered.
Klein placed eleventh in the in
dividual speakers' rating, and as a
team Stanford rated higher than
the top two teams. This paradox is
similar to past years when West
Coast teams have always placed
low. The Stanford record was bet
ter than any other West Coast
team.
