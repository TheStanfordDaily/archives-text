## Adviser System 
### 
For the most part, Stanford freshmen are fortunate in getting
excellent guidance and help in the many problems which face
the first year student. However, one outstanding fault mars the
program designed to aid freshmen with their scholastic prob
lems. This fault is the inadequate lower division adviser system.
Too many students have too much trouble in too similar a
pattern to make this inadequacy just a myth or a coincidence.
One frosh complains that he was allowed to take a top-heavy
schedule; another gripes after being advised to take a course he
wasn't prepared for, while still another has his entire four-year
program stymied because of poor advice.
It is our opinion that one of the main reasons for the ineffective
guidance is this overlooked fact â€” no matter how well ajusted
socialjy a student may be, he knows next to nothing of the aca
demic requirements and situations which face him at Stanford.
It is aji entjrely new process to him.
In.this situation lower division advisers, no matter how sincere
or willing help they may be, cannot operate to the student's
best interests.
Abdut 75 faculty members, all volunteers, make up the ranks of
the advisers. Each of them is assigned approximately 35 fresh
men and sophomores. Only a limited amount of time is allotted
lor student-adviser conferences, with the result that advice is on
an informal and hurried basis which is often harmful.
Indeed, the whole problem boils down to the fact that advisers
do ncft know their charges well enough, are not given time to
learn them, and consequently can give only meager
help.
It has been suggested that students talk with their advisers
during the middle of the quarter and thus avoid the pre-reg
rush. Another possible solution is for registration officials to
allow more time during the pre-reg period.
We suggest that Stanford officials consider doubling the num
ber of RA's and sponsors. These graduate and senior students
have the express job of getting to know the freshmen in their
respective dorms. Being students themselves, they understand
student problems. Finally, they can take time to talk things over
carefully, and then give valuable advice on study list and major
field problems.
