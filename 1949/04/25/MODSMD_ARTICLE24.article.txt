Another sunny Sunday has gone by, another day of frustration
has passed for would-be Encina pools swimmers. The only men's
pool on campus still remains closed on Sunday.
Athletic Department has yet to decide exactly how it stands
on the issue. Meanwhile, a large group of Encina frosh, Toyon
men, and other Stanfordites who lack the desire to brave Lagu
nita's muddy waters and the transportation so necessary to dip
in the surf at Rio del Mar are left without any Sunday swimming
facilities.
One ray of hope, though. Athletic Department says the matter
should be decided one way or the other by next Sunday. We
hope the news is good, and that Encina pool will start to operate
on an all-week basis.
