To Editor:
Now that the freshmen dues drive has been completed and $3,000 rung
up on the class register, I would like to thank all those who helped make
this possible. The remarkable percentage of students contributing—Bs
per cent—in convincing testimony of the growing pride and interest of
Farm students in their own classes.
During the war years class activities were practically non-existent,
but now the .strong class traditions which once prevailed are regaining
their pie-War vigor. The response of the class of '52 echoes this new
vitality, and I -feel certain that in the coming years the importance of the
class unit will grow and bring to the studuent an even greated number
of activities. With this solid financial foundation and the strong class
.spirit which has already been shown, the success of '52 at Stanford will
be guaranteed.
