## Bull Session 
### 
By now, the class of '52 is in the swing of things to their collective necks,
so it is only fitting that at this point we veterans of the Stanford cold war
pass on to the class of '53 a few of the choice bits of information that \vc
have culled .... take note, bitty people, you have a lot to learn.

There are things you should bring with you when
you come Fellows, bring one T-shirt, one pair
Levis, and your older brother's ID. Girls, don't bring
anything .... with the ratio the way it is, you can
get anything you want right here. You might also
bring with you a small donation for the FTBASIFOE
OIGWIPBTHW â€” the "Fund to build a statue in front
of Encina of Ignatz Gorp who invented paper bags
that hold water."
You'll learn lots of stuff here, too .... for instance,
other things besides the population of Milpitas

Rossotti was not a painter of the Renaissance, on second thought, who
was the painter of the Renaissance? What color did he paint it? Where
is it now?
The opportunities here will amaze you Can you explain yells
with your mouth stretched to a width of more than 18 inches? You can
be a cheerleader. Do you enjoy camping out and living the life of the
road? You can get a room at the Village. Are you a Mongolian idiot?
You can write Bull Session. Can you play a guitar or a uke? So can
everybody else.
And remember you're coming to a distinguished school. Among Farm
graduates of fame are Boris Shmoris ('92) fashion designer, inventor of
the common form, the Russian New Look; Julius Shmulius, ('76) writer
of such famous best-sellers as "1.001 Ways to Strangle Women," "The True
Position of the Aardvark in Modern Economics," and"The Sexual Ab
normalities of the Bobbsey Twins." Not to mention Felix Shmelix,
composer of Sing To Mc in the Moonlight of Storkenbattenfellerspanken's
Creamy-White Sandwich Bread," and other famous radio arias. Other
graduates arc Horace Tocatta, Hepzibah Schnurb, and Rhonda Bout who
have done nothing at all except lives in caves and chew on sheep bones.
So now you know, little people of the future, you have been informed,
you have been told, you have had it. You have the material to go far
beyond the class of '52 ... . but let's see you try and do it.


Wha Hoppin?
