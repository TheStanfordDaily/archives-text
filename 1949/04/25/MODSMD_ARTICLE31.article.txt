# Phi Kaps Miss Door
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Phi Kappa Sigma house has been
minus its front door since Friday
morning. The brothers don't like it.
The house feels and sounds like a
radio mystery mansion with the
cold night wind swirling up the
.stair wells and along the corridors.
The large heavy green door dis
appeared about -3:30 Friday morn
rjng. A phantom crew that consum
mated the dehinging took one min
ute to dislodge the pins after a pre
liminary engineering appraisal of
the easy task. (No, it wasn't the en
gineering school.)
As the crew started to depart, a
hinge pin was dropped. Tin; result
ant clatter aroused some of the
snoozers upstairs.
Hurriedly a four-man crew raced
down tlie street with the huge door.
Bumping into a campus policeman,
the crew embarrassedly admitted
what they were doing. The law had
a sense of humor that morning and
let them go.
If the cold and surmising Phi Kap
brothers still want their door back
—there is conjecture about the pos
sibility of finding the door entered
in the forthcoming Junior Water
Carnival—it would be recognizable
as the flat-top with the doorknob.
There are also rumors that the
door may be found somewhere in
Roble!
