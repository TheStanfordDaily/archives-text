# Delta Chi House To Hold Red Ball
## 
### 
Subversive elements, whose un
dercover activities on campus have
been more and more in evidence
during the past week, will openly
hold a meeting Saturday night.
The meeting will be thinly dis
guised as an all-campus dance, the
Red Ball, and will be held at the
Delta Chi Kremlin, 586 Mayfield.
Latest word from Men's Council
counter-espionage agents has it that
all students are invited and that
dancing will be from 9 to 1 to the
music of Bob Anderson and his Bol
shevik band.
"Come as your favorite peasant,
worker, subversive agent, or Marx
ian."' sneered Hamilton De Jong,
Delta Chi commissar.
The Red Ball four-hour plan in
cludes bountiful refreshments and
entertainment.
KSU's infamous Stanford Sadie
will deliver an intermission mes
sage pertaining to certain Commu
nistic principles involving love. She
will be closely guarded against cap
italist interests that have often
sought to learn her identiy.
