# College Radio To Be on Trial
## 
### 
College radio must prove its edu
cational value to the Federal Com
munications Commission to justify
continued existence, said George
Abraham, national chairman of the
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System,
at the IBS Regional Conference Sat
urday.
Stations are preparing cases to
be submitted to the FCC by June 1.
If the commission feels that college
radio does not provide valuable ed
ucational services to the commu
nity, the school, and the radio in
dustry, the commission may feel
justified in discontinuing or further
restricting operation of college sta
tions.
If the commission favors continu
ance of college radio, IBS will at
tempt to hold hearings on technical
matters after June 1.
Carrier current stations were felt
to have greater educational value
than non-commercial FM stations.
"We are taking the position that
carrier current stations," said IBS
Regional Representative Steve Phil
lips. "offer greater opportunities for
student paticipation and for original
research." College radio serves as
a training ground for the radio in
dustry and as a means to further
audience interest through participa
tion. Campus stations also provide
supplementary work which cannot
be effectively included in the cur
riculum.
The Federal Communications
Commission has proposed placing
carrier current stations, such as
KSU, under commercial broadcast
regulations. Most college stations
would not be able to operate under
these rules.
Alternatives such as FM or non
commercial operation would place
the full operation expense on the
university, which would automati
cally discontinue some stations.
Standard broadcast regulations
would place additional responsibil
ity on a college station. Licensed
engineers, certain time allocations,
and certified equipment are some
of the requirements.
IBS has recommended that a spe
cific provision in the FCC rules be
made for campus radio stations to
provide for special problems con
cerning college stations alone.
