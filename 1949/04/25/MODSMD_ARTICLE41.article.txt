# Girls Lift Anchor To Aid Coxswains
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Stroke! Stroke! It's not the voice
of a coxswain bellowing orders up
in the Rally Com office in the
Union, but stroke after stroke on a
typewriter as the women's auxiliary
crew goes to work.
The crew braves the Bay at dawn.
The crew auxiliary contributes af
ternoons to planning the races down
to the last detail. A crew regatta
involves more than the physical
work of men rowing their shells.
In order to have the race run
smoothly, long hours of mental
work are involved.
For this reason, the crew auxiliary
was recently formed. It now con
sists of 13 girls, but it is hoped that
the full organization will contain
four representatives from each
class. The auxiliary is not just a
group of mascots, but an adminis
trative group which takes care of
behind-the-scenes preparation—the
correspondence and publicity — for
each race.
For example, extensive pians are
now being formulated for the re
gatta with Cal, scheduled for May
7. The girls have already sent out
letters inviting to the race many
prominent people, including Gover
nor Warren. They have contacted a
radio station and arranged lor
broadcasting facilities, and are even
working to have the race televised
and photographed, by movie cam
eras.
The auxiliary is spending many

hours clown at the printer's work
ing on a new idea: an illustrated
program telling about the schools
racing, their coaches, and important
events in crew history. Still more
paper work is involved. Hundreds
of copies of notices to small craft in.
the area of the race will have to be
distributed. Contacts with the Navy
have already been established.
Several thousand spectators are
expected at the regatta, and thi*
calls for efficient traffic direction.
