# Stanford CIBA Hopes Tumble; Double Plays Cut Card Rallies
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
Sad Sam Barry's Figueroa hire
lings vaulted into first place in the
CIBA standings at the expense of
Stanford's slipping Indians by a
score of 9-7 Saturday at the Stan
lord diamond.
Southern Cal and Stanford both 1
reached base safely on the same
number of hits, but Trojan power
and infield defense strength were
the margin.
Doing the best in a losing cause
was first baseman Dick Clegg, who
whacked out a double and three
singles in five times at bat.
A deciding factor in the tight con- ,
test was the deadly double play
combination of the Trojan co-cap
tains, shortstop Jim Brideweiser
and second baseman Art Mazma
nian. reputed to be one of the finest
in college ranks.
Brideweiser to Mazmanian to Re
galdo turned up no less than three
times as the DP snuffer to promis
ing Indian rallies.
The main damage was done in the
bottom of the seventh when a Stan- '
ford "big innning" was just yetting i
started. Three runs were already in
and the chances looked excellent
that the Woltermen would tie the
score.
Then pfft; the baseball side of
USC's athletic empire had com
pleted their second double play (the
the third one ended the game in the
ninth) to give SC its seventh
straight victory over assorted Car
dinal athletes this year.
Stanford pitching came too late—
to be more specific, when Dave
Dahle entered the game in the
eighth inning. Dave (hero of tha
first Cal game) Dahle set down the
six men to face him in order, strik
ing out three of them in his rather
futile stint.
Captain Bill Arce broke pleasant
ly out of his year-long slump by
batting out two hits and driving in
a run.
Dave Stott started on the mound

I for (he Indians. He ran into trouble
right of! in the first inning and was
i shaky until relieved,
