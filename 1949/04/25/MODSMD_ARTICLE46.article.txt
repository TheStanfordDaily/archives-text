Last-Minute Kerkorian to McColl Pass Wins Game .... Ramstead

Victory .... Nationals Next For Wycoff .... Hurdler Storum Cracks
Another Record.
These headlines are not from any sports sheet this year. And they may
not be from next year's. But glancing over the shoulder of the man who
tabs the future, you can't help seeing these news items. These are the
headlines and stories that will imbue the Big Red '52 in the hearts of
sports l'ans everywhere. That will record the cardinal numeral as a trade
mark ot winning Stanford teams, of a top-notch year in Farm history.
But why go out on a limb and predict these things? Take a look at
the past record and see for yourself.

In football, the big guns were Bill McColl, a fair-to
middling pass receiver and kicker; a couple of fancy,
heady, QB's, Gary Kerkorian and Dick Horn; Harry
Hugasion and Eric Southwood, backs that would make
any coach happy; and a line that was plenty rough,
with stellar guards Jesse Cone and Owen Powell in line
lor some heavy varsity duty next season.
The record speaks for itself — five wins, no defeats;
points to 20 for the combined opponents. An aver
age score of 27 to 6.

Two Jims, Ramstead and Walsh, could and should break into the

varsity line-up when the Indian five takes the Pavilion
floor next year. The former is really smooth under
the boards and a great shot-maker; Walsh plays a fast,
charging game that is untouchable lor fight, scoring,
and winning.
The Frosh five lost only a single game to Lowell of
San Francisco, discounting the scrums with the local
Braves. Included in their victory belt were four lop-

Matu victories over Cal. With support from such comers as Iverson, Davis,
Andrews, and Garver, more season totals can read like that one.
A hotbed of developing talent is the Frosh Diamond. Walsh shines here

again. A tremendous slugger and clever fielder, Jim
is fitting in well at first base. Frank Hamilton, a real
major league prospect, blazes across a hopping fast ball
that has confused batters constantly.
Losing their first game in nine starts only the other
day.the nine lias other promising diamond greats in
Tony Stellar, Dick Corzine, Dan Sullivan, and Larry
Peterson, who have all helped put away Cal twice to
cinch the first series title since '38.

Over in the Encina pools, there's a rising sprint star who bears the
monicker Bob WycofT — no relation to the Wykoff of cinder fame. Bob's

bests, so far, as :23.8 in the fifty and:54.1 in the century,
a good start on Bob Anderson's records.
Coach Haynie can count on some others, too. Bruce
Putnam, all-around eventer; Puss LaTelle, breast
stroker; and Stan Chapman, another freestyler, all can
make the inner-swim circle.
Racing around Angel 1 Field with easy, loose strides,
a pair of top-line football ends steal the track show.
Bill Storum, ace hurdler, will help maintain the In-

ciian supremacy in the barriers, while Wilb Taylor handles the sprint
chores and broad jump capably. Chuck Hokanson, 47-foot shotputter;
distancemen Herb Cohen and John Wooley add a lot of power and points.
Summing up the year's work, the fighting Freshmen have already
•won 32 tests, dropping only four. A fair record for any collection of ath
letes. But look at it from another angle. The men of '52 have now scored
nine victories over their rivals from across the Bay and lost not a single
contest. Cal can expect more of the same, this year and rtext.
The idea that comes to mind is that things around the Farm are looking
brighter, athletically speaking. It looks like Stanford will rise to her
former perch, as monarch of West Coast sporting activities. Like their
lormer counterparts, the Vow Boys and the Wow Boys, the rising '"Now
Boys" mean business in The Sporting Line.

These headlines are not from any sports sheet this year. And they may
not be from next year's. But glancing over the shoulder of the man who
tabs the future, you can't help seeing these news items. These are the
headlines and stories that will imbue the Big Red '52 in the hearts of
sports l'ans everywhere. That will record the cardinal numeral as a trade
mark ot winning Stanford teams, of a top-notch year in Farm history.
But why go out on a limb and predict these things? Take a look at
the past record and see for yourself.

In football, the big guns were Bill McColl, a fair-to
middling pass receiver and kicker; a couple of fancy,
heady, QB's, Gary Kerkorian and Dick Horn; Harry
Hugasion and Eric Southwood, backs that would make
any coach happy; and a line that was plenty rough,
with stellar guards Jesse Cone and Owen Powell in line
lor some heavy varsity duty next season.
The record speaks for itself — five wins, no defeats;
points to 20 for the combined opponents. An aver
age score of 27 to 6.

Two Jims, Ramstead and Walsh, could and should break into the

varsity line-up when the Indian five takes the Pavilion
floor next year. The former is really smooth under
the boards and a great shot-maker; Walsh plays a fast,
charging game that is untouchable lor fight, scoring,
and winning.
The Frosh five lost only a single game to Lowell of
San Francisco, discounting the scrums with the local
Braves. Included in their victory belt were four lop-

Matu victories over Cal. With support from such comers as Iverson, Davis,
Andrews, and Garver, more season totals can read like that one.
A hotbed of developing talent is the Frosh Diamond. Walsh shines here

again. A tremendous slugger and clever fielder, Jim
is fitting in well at first base. Frank Hamilton, a real
major league prospect, blazes across a hopping fast ball
that has confused batters constantly.
Losing their first game in nine starts only the other
day.the nine lias other promising diamond greats in
Tony Stellar, Dick Corzine, Dan Sullivan, and Larry
Peterson, who have all helped put away Cal twice to
cinch the first series title since '38.

Over in the Encina pools, there's a rising sprint star who bears the
monicker Bob WycofT — no relation to the Wykoff of cinder fame. Bob's

bests, so far, as :23.8 in the fifty and:54.1 in the century,
a good start on Bob Anderson's records.
Coach Haynie can count on some others, too. Bruce
Putnam, all-around eventer; Puss LaTelle, breast
stroker; and Stan Chapman, another freestyler, all can
make the inner-swim circle.
Racing around Angel 1 Field with easy, loose strides,
a pair of top-line football ends steal the track show.
Bill Storum, ace hurdler, will help maintain the In-

ciian supremacy in the barriers, while Wilb Taylor handles the sprint
chores and broad jump capably. Chuck Hokanson, 47-foot shotputter;
distancemen Herb Cohen and John Wooley add a lot of power and points.
Summing up the year's work, the fighting Freshmen have already
•won 32 tests, dropping only four. A fair record for any collection of ath
letes. But look at it from another angle. The men of '52 have now scored
nine victories over their rivals from across the Bay and lost not a single
contest. Cal can expect more of the same, this year and rtext.
