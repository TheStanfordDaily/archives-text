The athletes of '52 had another of those-sweep afternoons last Saturday that Stanford has be
come so used to since Chuck Taylor's great gridiron machine ended the fall quarter with an un
defeated season, climaxed with a 30 to 0 burial of Berkeley.
Santa Clara felt the main force of frosh might, tasting defeat twice—a 9 to 0 shutout in tennis
and the short end of a 6 to 2 final baseball score. The other yearling victory was at the expense
of Lincoln High School of San Francisco, in which the frosh golfers topped the Lincoln linksters
by a 21 to 6 count.
