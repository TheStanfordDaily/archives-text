Coach Everett Dean's frosh horse
hiders took the measure of Santa
; Clara, 6-2, at the freshman diamond
I Saturday morning. The Cards led
all the way. as steady pitching and
' power hitting in the clutches proved
the difference in victory.
Stanford took the field apparently
1 determined to make up lor a woe
i iu I performance against San Mateo
earlier in the week. In that contest
' the JC's hung the first defeat on the
Little Tribesmen in eight starts. In
| the Santa Clara game, the yearlings
displayed little of the faulty glove
i work and sleepy baserunning which
i so characterized the San Mateo af
j fair.
As usual, Frank Hamilton was the
I master of the situation from his po
sition on the mound. The tall left
hander with the blinding smoke
ball kept the baby Broncos at bay
throughout the game and would
have had a shutout but for a ques
tionable line drive over third base
I which drove in the Broncs' only two
I tallies.
The Deanmen started right out in
i the first two innings to insure their
! eighth win of the campaign. Ned
i Hutchinson scored a run in the first
I frame and drove in another in the
I second.
Dick Corzine homered in the Card
half of the sixth with Larry Peter
son on base to drive in two more
runs, and Corzine and Dan Sullivan
crossed the plate in the eighth in
j nint* to complete the scoring.
