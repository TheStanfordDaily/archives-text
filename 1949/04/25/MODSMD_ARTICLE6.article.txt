# Spring Sing Signups Asked By Rally Com
## 
### 
Signups for the ninth annual
Spring Sing begin today in the AS
SU office. Living groups are urged
by chairmen Craig Stolle and Lynne
Powell to sign up early in order to
avoid disappointment, as no dupli
cation of songs will be permitted.
The deadline for entry registration
is 5 p.m. next Monday.
The Sing, under the direction of
Rally Com since the war, has won
a popular place among the top
events of the year. It will be held
June 3 in the Frost Amphitheater.
A mixed division has been added
this year to the customary men's,
women's, and novelty groups. In
audition there will be an over-all
sweepstakes trophy for the best en
try in the Spring Sing.
Entry rules are as follows: ..
1. All groups must pay a Si.so
entry fee when they sign up.
2. Groups must have a mini
mum of 20 people, with the ex
ception of the novelty groups
which may be of any size.
3. The contest is open to under
graduate, graduate, and faculty
groups.
4. No more than three living
groups may enter as one contest
ant; each entry may be composed
of men, women, or mixed groups.
5. One song or a medley of not
more than three songs may he
used; however, the medley should
not exceed the tune of one song.
ti. No freshmen may take part
in any entry except that from the
house in which they live.
Judging of the groups will be
based as usual upon tone, tech
nique. interpretation, and presenta
tion.
Last year the Med School cap

second time); Lagunita. the wom
ens: and "Four Kernels of Corn,"
the novelty division.
