# New Plane Design Is Lecture Topic
## 
### 
Robert M. Jones of Moffett Field
will speak on supersonic designing
at 8 p.m. tomorrow in room 268,
Engineering corner.
Mr. Jones's topic will be "Aero
dynamics of Swept Wings and High
Speed Transport Design." The lec
ture, which has been previously
presented before the National Acad
emy of Sciences, tells the reasons
for swept-back wings and applies
these concepts to show that flight
at moderate supersonic speeds is
economically feasible.
This lecture, which is open to the
public, is one of a series on current
scientific research.
