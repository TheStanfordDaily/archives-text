# Brutal 'Paisan' Rated As Years Best Italian Film
## 
### AL BERRY 
"Paisan." which is currently light- j
ing up the Varsity's often dim t
screen, is probably not the best mo
tion picture of last year. It is un
questionably the most brutal.
Director Rossellini, who isn't I
prone to making bad pictures, has,
in "Paisan," his best effort to date. !
"Paisan," however, is not a pretty !
motion picture. It is often cruel, !
sometimes funny, and once dull, but j
it is never forgettable. In short, |
here is a motion picture well worth j
seeing.
The plot consists of a series of to- j
tally unrelated incidents that could
have taken place after the Ameri
can Fifth Army landed in Sicily and
Italy in the spring of 1943. There is j
a brief stop in Sicily, then to Naples, !
and after that to Rome, Florence, !
and the Po Valley.
The most difficult and the most
brilliant thing that the Italians have ;
managed to do with this picture is ;
to put War on the screen —a trick j
which has often been tried but not i
half so well done since "All Quiet ;
on the Western Front." In "Paisan"
you will see no carefully grimed
hero crawling through the mud to
save the white clean nurse. No
glory., no bands, no medals, no
cheers will be found describing war
in this picture. "Paisan" is .frill of
dirty, hungry, inconsiderate, and
badly frightened people who are
placed in the rubble of a Europe
that seemed to be dying in 1943.
The acting in this Hick does not
pretend to be outstanding, nor is it.
But the script, the quickness of di
rection, and the intelligent camera
work more than make up for this
deficiency. And another nice touch
is the way the language problem is
handled. Since there were three
nationalities involved — American.
Italian, and German — the picture,
with typical simplicity, uses all
three languages: the Americans
speak English; Italians. Italian; and
Germans, German. The manage
ment of the Varsity Theater has
thoughtfully provided subtitles for
those parts spoken in a tongue oth
er than Brooklynese.
All in all, "Paisan"' borders on

being one of the tru!y great motion
pictures. When simplicity and bru
talness are well mixed in a picture,
the effect is likely to be staggering.
Go see "Paisan" and be prepared to
stagger home. This picture is good
I enough to be shown at the Guild.
