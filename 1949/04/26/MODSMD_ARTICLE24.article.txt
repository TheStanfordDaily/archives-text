## Summer Government 
### 
The proposed ASSU Constitution states that spring quarter Ex
com shall provide an interim government for summer quarter by
by-laws. The by-laws shall set forth the organizational structure,
powers, duties, and responsibilities under which the govern
ment shall operate.
Formerly, spring Excom appointed the student officers and
members of Excom for summer quarter. They served with full
powers of any Excom rather than the one that appointed them.
Under the present Constitution, the newly-elected Excom takes
over at the end of spring quarter and the summer one acts in
its place. The new Excom is installed fall quarter under the
proposed Constitution.
Under the new Constitution, a separate government with ex
plicit powers and authority will be created in a by-law. These
powers will be supplemented with special clauses providing for
emergency actions the summer government might have to take.
In the past, spring Excom has passed resolutions that the sum
mer Excom is only to deal with the matters pertaining to sum
mer government. However, under the present Constitution,
summer Excom had full powers and could disregard the reso
lution. It also left that group confused as to what power it was
supposed to exercise.
The proposed Constitution also permits Excom to set up dif
ferent systems of organization each summer quarter in light of
the conditions existing at the time. The powers and form of the
summer government in by-laws can be created by a three-fourths
vote of Excom while an amendment to the Constitution takes an
all-campus vote.
The judicial system will remain the same during the summer
quarter as under the former Constitution, for the judiciary must
be a continuing body.
The main change, therefore, is that the summer student gov
ernment will no longer be the agent of the newly-elected Ex
com, but a distinct and separate body, regulated by by-law
passed by spring Excom.
