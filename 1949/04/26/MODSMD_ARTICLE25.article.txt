# Editor's Notebook

Yesterday's Freshman Edition of The Daily was a product of
Daily frosh staff members. While the members did very well
in getting the paper out, the Old Faces on the paper managed
to slip in a few false stories and sentences.
The major story—on "revised" demerit system rules—that
slipped by the freshmen appeared on page one. An engagement
notice on page eight was wrong.
On the credit side, however, we take our hats off to the 21
frosh representing the Class of '52 for the other news, feature,
and editorial coverage for the edition.

"He ought to grow up," was a typical comment made by stu
dents as they left their class in the Memorial Auditorium yester
day morning. The same professor had done it again—asked
two students 10 and 15 minutes late to class to "please leave."
Neither student had made any noise when they entered and sat
down in the rear of the auditorium.
We can understand such action being done in rooms similar
to 214 in the History building where students would enter in
front of the entire class. In the Memorial Auditorium, however,
this professor has broken the continuity of his well-organized
lectures in order to deal with late-comers.

The Stay-Awhile social hour starts again tonight from 9 to
10 in the Women's Clubhouse. During the spring quarter, the
socials will be held every Tuesday evening. As usual, free
dancing, entertainment, and refreshments will be available to
all men and women.
The mid-week socials are designed to break up a week of
study with a brief period of relaxation.
A Boathouse fire last week did only a few dollars worth of
damage to the west roof of the structure. But the incident illus
trates how dangerous cigarettes can become when they fall be
tween the floorboards of the roof.
With warmer weather coming up, we advise that you carefully
put out cigarettes lest we be without a Boathouse as well as a
lake next month.
