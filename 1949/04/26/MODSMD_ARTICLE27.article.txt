# No Decision Yet On Stern Rooms
## 
### 
The controversial question of
who will get rooms in Stern Hall
next fall is still an unsettled matter
as far as University officials and the
ASSU Housing Committee are con
cerned.
Dan Stone, chairman of the com
mittee, said yesterday that the pro
portion of freshmen and non-fresh
men in Stern will depend on how
many frosh men the University de
cides to admit. The present capacity
of Encina, around 55)0 residents, will
be maintained.
Stern Hall will be able to accom
modate approximately 228 residents.
