# Class Representation to Student Government Dropped in 1945 After 55 Years of Operation

"Die Luft der Freiheit Weht"â€”
j The Wind of Freedom Blows.
This was the motto that in 1891
i welcomed the 559 students to the
new Leland Stanford Junior Uni
i versity. This was also the motto that
was to determine the spirit of stu
i dent self-government and its im
; portant foundation, the constitution.
The first president of the Univer
! sity, Dr. David Starr Jordan, made
the initial interpretation of the mot
! to when he said, "Persons fit to be
I in college arc fit to look after their
j own affairs," It didn't take the stu
; dents long to turn these words into
I definite action, for by the end of
\ 1891 the first student body election
! was held and the basis for the con
stitution laid.
Then, in 1892, the first official con
stitution was drawn up, mainly
1 through the efforts of Henry David
son Sheldon, a history student who
later became the dean of education
: at the University of Oregon. Liberal
as the ideals of the Farm were, the
j beginning did not offer t he freedom
' that we now take for granted. The
j students had no voice in discipline
and were only allowed to discuss
! problems without the power of act
j ing on them.
The controlling 1 power was in the
hands of the Faculty Committee of
Student Affairs, but there was lit
j tie concern on the part of the stu
i dents. The relationship that existed
| between the professors on the stu
j dents was one of greatest friendship.
By 1896, there was in existence
i not one constitution but seven; one

each for the Associated Students,
the Daily Palo Alto; the Sequoia;
the Students' Guild, forerunner of
the Health Service; the Glee Club;
the Mandolin Club; and the Or
chestra. Representation to Excom
was determined by classes, not by
living groups.
Old villain Liquor made his en
trance into the extra and not-so
cxtra-curricular activities of the
students in the early twentieth cen
tury. The disciplinary tactics of the
Faculty's Student Affairs Committee
consequently, became more harsh,
and the students moved into action
in 1908, staging a historic parade as
a demonstration against the stern
control they were being subjected to.
The big year for student self
control was 1909, for it was then
that Dr. Jordan established the
University Conference. The consti
tution of this body enabled stu
dents to handle matters of discipli
nary nature and to generally extend
the scope of their control.
In 1911, breaking the traditions of
democratic history, the"women were
the first to have an actual judicial
council, which was the Women's
Council of today. They were fol
lowed a year later by the forerun
ner of today's Men's Council.
During the first World War the
faculty returned to the control of
student affairs, but in 1919 once
aeain the roughs held the reins. At
this time elections to the major
body, the Student Council (the Ex
com) were still decided on the basis
of class representation.

The trend of constitutional
changes during the '20's was the
incorporation of various other sep
arate constitutions and the extension
of powers and duties.
The students, asserting their ideas
of democracy in 1932, voted down a
recommendation to have members
of Men sand Women's Council ap
pointed instead of elected.
The coeds bared their feminine
fangs in 1939 and demanded that an
amendment be made to the consti
tution assuring them of a graduate
representation on Excom. A vote
was taken and a majority decided
in favor of the women.
The change would have been made
except for an alert and angered
Theta Xi member. This determined
fraternity man discovered that a
mistake had been made in the latest
printing of the constitution and that
not only a majority, but a two
thirds vote was necessary for an
amendment. The rumor that this
Theta Xi man never had another
date at Stanford has not been sub
stantiated.
Once again a world war caused a
setback in progress, and the consti
tution was set aside for the duration.
In 1945, after 55 years of class
representation to student govern
ment. the change to our present sys
tem of living-group and area rep
resentation was made. At that time
the change was a tongue-in-cheek
matter, and the Stanford handbook
stated that it was temporary and
that class representation would re
turn.
