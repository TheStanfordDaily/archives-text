# Delta Chi Invites Campus to Dance
## 
### 
Campus subversive elements have
issued a formal call to all students
to join the party Saturday night at
the Delta Chi Kremlin, 586 May-
Held.
"This will mark an end to capital
ist exploitation . . . the common
man will dance." gloated Bobski
Baersonovovitch. (Bobski is sus
pected of having liberal sympathies,
and is reported to be an agent of
Moscow disguised as the Delta Chi
social chairman.)
Tentative investigations, conduct
ed by an intrepid Daily reporter
who disappeared under mysetrious
circumstances last night, reveal that
dancing will be from 9 to 1 to the
music of Bob Anderson and his
Bolshevik band.
John Bodnarski, Delta Chi com
missar of decorations, advises those
who wish to join the party to come
as themselves, so long as they are
common laborers, peasants, subver
sive agents, Red soldiers, or other
wise Marxian.
The Red Ball four - hour plan
promises bountiful refreshments and
entertainment for all who dare pass
through the Iron Curtain.
