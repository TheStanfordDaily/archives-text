### JOHN HALL 
Jack Weiershauser's Stanford Indians versus
Jtss- Hill's USC Trojans
Saturday,
In Stanford Stadium.
That's the bill for the best dual track meet of the year, as Stanford,
with its best cinder squad in recent history, meets Troy, still the champ,
with all the chips on the table.
Two weeks ago. the Tribe looked like a two-length winner, but as of last
Saturday, things narrowed down to a bloody toss-up.
Right on schedule, the Southerners have been coming along rapidly,
and they appear ready for peak efforts against Stanford.
Already, Trojan Bill Bayless has increased his discus mark over 11 feet
since the Michigan State meet. Old A 1 Lawrence has bounced back into
shape with a 23.5 winning time in the lows, and a promise to hit 14.5
i'i the highs against the Indians. And Troy is on the move.
Trojans Regain Power
Besides these two prominent improvements, the entire Trojan squad
has begun to reach the boiling point. The S4 1 •» to 4(j' .j win over California
proves as much.
So Saturday's natural is going to come down to the wire a lot closer
that the Row predicted last week. You just can't depend on those Trojans
to stand pat on anything.
Most mysterious questions at hand include:
How many and which events will SC's Bob Chambers enter? He won
the BSO, seconded the 4-10. and ran a leg of the relay against California,
and rumor has it that he'll try the same against Stanford. Except that
Jess Hill might switch him to the mile at the last moment.
How fast can Lawrence, once a 14.2 man, get over the tall timbers?
If he is in top form, needed points will be dying fast.
Look Out For Mystery Men
Can Jack Barnes get back up to his best 6-G effort in the high jump 9
Will Bill Bayless win the discus? And how many "unheard-ofs" will SC
dig out of Jess Hill's hat?
All these questions will need to he answered before one can accur
ately tab the winner.
To make matters worse, both Jack Weiershauser and Jess Hill are ex
pected to jockey around with their respective entries, searching minutely
for each fraction of a point.
Deciding factors will be the spots where both squads are relatively
weak, such as the two-mile, and the show places in the broad jump, 220,
and mile.
Still, with all the ballots in, it looks like Stanford can come home in
front. But it will take an afternoon of inspirational running and consistent
field work.
One thing sure, it'll be a long time before Stanford gets another chance
as good as this one to take El Troje. Troy has bumped and dumped and
junked Stanford since 1833.
And it's time to do something about it.
