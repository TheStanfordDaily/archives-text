# Student Officials and Excom Favor New Propositions on Representation
## 
### 
The new ASSU Constitution will
j go to the voters tomorrow, John
j Marin, Election Board chairman,
! stated yesterday.
The principal change in the new
! Constitution is in regard to Excom
j representation, Constitution com-
I niitee member Mark Hatfield said.

In the new plan there will be one j
representative from each of these j
groups:
Women's Row, Union Unit. Worn- j

en's Halls, Men's Row, Men's Halls,
Village, and off-campus.
In addition, there will be repre
sentatives from each of the five
classes.
In regard to this new system, Syd
ney Morgan, Excom representative
from Lagunita, said that she believes
it will arouse less interest in stu
dent government, because it be
comes less accessible to students.
Miss Morgan added the compro
mise destroys the benefits of both
class and area representation. "It
is better to elect people whom you
know to office, and under this sys
tem. it will be more difficult.
"Personally, I am not going to vote
for the Constitution because of the
representation section," Miss Mor
gan concluded.
"The Executive Committee recom
mends the adoption of this pro
posed Constitution. It's a great im
provement over the old one. and will
give student government the well
organized document that it has
needed." ASSU President Gus Cha
valas stated.
The finished product is a work
able, simplified, and well-co-ordi
nated constitution which is based
on consistent policy, Chavalas
added.
Gigi Marion, AWS president, said
that she believes the representation
section is the "most equitable and
logical proposal" which was made.
"Let's give class representation a
try," she stated.
"It's a compromise measure," Ted
LeVino, Inter-Fraternity Council
president, said in regard to repre
sentation. As far as fraternity men,
or any other living group is con

cerned, they will probably be as well
represented under the new system
as they are now under the area
plan, he suid.
Additional changes have been
made in the new Constitution, Hat
field said. All campus organizations
and living groups (except frater
nities and eating clubs) will be re
quired to bank with the Students'
Organizations Fund.
The Stanford Daily editor and the
student manager will be the only
ex-oflicio members of Excom undet
the new Constitution, instead ol
there being six as present.
The Intei fraternity Board of Con
trol has been given control in all
cases involving fraternities as a

whole, although Men's Council will
still hear cases involving individual
members.
Excom will provide for summer
quarter government and it will be
an entity in itself. Formerly, Sum
mer Excom merely acted as ageni
of the Excom for the following year.
