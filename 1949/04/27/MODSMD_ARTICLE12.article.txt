# Schwabacher Song Recital Well Received
## 
### BETTE BURT 
James Schwabacher, tenor, pre
sented a musical recital last night,
accompanied by Edwin McDonell at
the piano. '"Jimmy is well known
to the campus and sang before a
very receptive audience. He pre
sented a well-rounded program of
English, French, and American
songs.
The program began with a med
ley of "Three Bible Songs" by An
tonin Dvorak. Mr. Schwabacher
was very expressive and sang in the
vein of the words. This was espe
cially noted in his joyful attitude in
singing "Sing Ye a Joyful Song."
The second section of the program
was devoted to French songs. "La
Caravane" by Ernest Chausson was
a very stirring, very 'Trench" piece.
The lyrics are from a poem about
"the human caravan on Earth's des
ert"—rather , morbid and pessimistic
in tone. The music follows the
words of the text: very dissonant,
sad, excited, and ending very slowly
and sadly on the last line, "Lie
down and sleep, breathless voya
ger."
Two short, striking pieces by
Francis Poulenc were rendered by
Mr. Schwabacher—"l9o4" and "Le
Dromadaire" from "Le Bestiaire."
He related the poems first, and then
sang them in French. The music
constantly changed and the endings
seemed almost irrelevant.
The entire program was very
good and the numbers were very
well selected, varying from sad.
moody pieecs to joyful love songs.
