Today when you vote on the proposed ASSU Constitution,
we hope that you will consider the document in the light of
"Will it strengthen student government at Stanford?"
Comparing the proposed constitution with the one now in
use, we maintain that the new document is superior to the old
constitution in every article because:
1. Living area representation has been strengthened to in
clude residences and classes. With such a system Excom mem
bers can represent their living groups, and they can also think
and act in terms of the welfare and interests of the whole stu
dent body. Student interests will be doubly represented—by
residence and by class.
2. Joint council meetings will be held by Men's and Wom
en's Councils on Honor Code cases regardless of the sex of a
student. Purpose of this constructive change is to provide of
fenders with equitable judgment. The tendency of one council
to be harsher or more lenient than the other would disappear
when both councils sat in on the cases.
3. Excom has wide discretion to act on student body busi
ness, but it may be checked by the students through the use
of new, broad powers of the recall, initiative, and referendum.
Under the old Constitution students could attempt to check
Excom through constitutional amendment or by-law when a
petition was presented.
4. Summer government has been set up as a separate body
from the previous or following Excoms. Instead, the summer
Excom would operate on the basis of by-law regulations.
5. The position of Men's Council in relation to the Inter
fraternity Board of Control has been defined in the new constitu
tion. While the Board would handle all cases involving frater
nity houses as a whole, Men's Council would deal with individ
uals. Rushing and pledging rules are set and enforced by the
Board of Control.
The present constitution is ambiguous and outmoded. The
proposed constitution is concrete and easy to understand. Wher
ever it differs from the existing document, student government
will be improved and strengthened.
The proposed constitution has been simplified by transferring
such sections as the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard to
the by-laws. Those sections of the old constitution not included
in the new document will continue to be followed until new by
laws are approved by Excom.
In viewing the proposed constitution when you vote today,
appraise the entire document in the light of the welfare of the
students as a whole. Do not condemn the work for personal
displeasure over one section, but decide whether the section
is equitable for all students in the ASSU.

of new, broad powers of the recall, initiative, and referendum.
Under the old Constitution students could attempt to check
Excom through constitutional amendment or by-law when a
petition was presented.
4. Summer government has been set up as a separate body
from the previous or following Excoms. Instead, the summer
Excom would operate on the basis of by-law regulations.
5. The position of Men's Council in relation to the Inter
fraternity Board of Control has been defined in the new constitu
tion. While the Board would handle all cases involving frater
nity houses as a whole, Men's Council would deal with individ
uals. Rushing and pledging rules are set and enforced by the
Board of Control.
The present constitution is ambiguous and outmoded. The
proposed constitution is concrete and easy to understand. Wher
ever it differs from the existing document, student government
will be improved and strengthened.
The proposed constitution has been simplified by transferring
such sections as the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard to
the by-laws. Those sections of the old constitution not included
in the new document will continue to be followed until new by
laws are approved by Excom.
In viewing the proposed constitution when you vote today,
appraise the entire document in the light of the welfare of the
students as a whole. Do not condemn the work for personal
displeasure over one section, but decide whether the section
is equitable for all students in the ASSU.
