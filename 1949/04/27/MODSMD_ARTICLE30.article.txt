## 
### 
It's rebate time again at the
Bookstore! "All Bookstore receipts
will be due May 2," Mrs. Helena T.
Bouehou, director of the Stanford
Bookstore, has announced.
She reminds everyone that the
procedure will be the same as it has
been in the past, and that the ab
solute deadline for returning tick
ets will be May 15.
Students should first the
special Stanford Bookstore Profit-
Sharing Envelope from the Book
store. They then must list each re
ceipt as to date and amount in the
columns provided, and total them
before presenting the envelope at
the Bookstore. Receipts are non
transferable and must be signed
and presented by the actual pur
chaser to be honored. The enclosed
receipts must tally with the listings
on the envelope.
Mrs. Bouehou stated that it was
necessary to make May 15 the ab
solute deadline so that the auditors
could cheek the receipts and deter
mine the percentage of return in
order that the students may receive
their cash dividends on or before
June 10.
As before, students leaving the
University may deposit the enve
lopes with the Bookstore and checks
will be mailed to them if self-ad
dressed envelopes are left for that
purpose.
Last year, with approximately 50
per cent of the purchasing students
turning in receipts, the rebate value
made was worth 20 per cent of the
total.
Students are reminded of the
SIRO box next to the side entrance
of the Bookstore where they may
drop their cash register receipts.
Rebates from this source go to the
SIRO group and aid in Stanford's
foreign relief program. Rebate funds
also go toward the financing of the
Stanford Bookstore Scholarship.
Since the Bookstore's fiscal year
runs from May 1 to May 1, the re
ceipts given for purchases after May
1 will be of a different color. They
will be applicable to next year's to
tal only and will not be accepted
this year.
