## Excom Representation 
### 
To the Editor:
The discussion of the proposed ASSU Constitution which is being' voted
on today has brought out two major points of debate. First, the vote now
must be a complete yes or a complete no rather than a point-by-point
expression of opinion. The Constitution itself makes amendment most
difficult and consequently any provisions which do not prove practicable
will be nearly impossible to change.
Excom representation is the provision of the Constitution which has
brought about most debate.
Ted Norton, in his letter to The Daily last week, contended that Excom
members should vote in accordance with "their own good judgment," and
thereby minimize the necessity for a plan of Excom representation that
would have for its primary consideration the best means whereby students
could make their opinions known to their Excom representatives. This
would remove the greatest argument against the plan of Excom repre
sentation proposed in the new Constitution.
We answer that Excom, at least on major issues, should represent the
will of the students rather than that of the Excom members alone. Failure
tc do so on one or two past occasions has aroused a great deal of justi
fiable resentment.
Therefore, we maintain that any acceptable plan of Excom represen
tation should insure, in so far as is possible, the opportunity of students
to make their opinions known to their representatives.
Living area representation can best accomplish this through the medium
of house meetings and dinner announcements. Class representation cannot
compete on this basis. (There would seem to be no more justification for
representation by class than for representation at large.)
The problem of representing ofT-campus students will be present under
any system. Wouldn't it be better to have them fairly represented as a
group rather than, • nominally, as portions of University classes? (Dean
Kimpton, in last month's Alumni Review states that 47 per cent of the
student body is living off-campus. It hardly seems that the best solution
has been arrived at when one representative is to serve 47 per cent of
the student body. The on-campus representatives each will serve 8.8 per
cent of the student body.)
If numerical apportionment is unfair under the old plan of living' area
representation, why not revise the plan rather than dispense with it alto
gether?
We urge readers of this letter to consider these points carefully before
voting on the Constitution today. It is regrettable that this Constitution,
which shows a great deal of work, should stand or fall on the basis of
one section. But this issue of student representation is so vital to our
entire system of student government, that, on the basis of it. we urge that
the Constitution be rejeced in today's election.

any system. Wouldn't it be better to have them fairly represented as a
group rather than, • nominally, as portions of University classes? (Dean
Kimpton, in last month's Alumni Review states that 47 per cent of the
student body is living off-campus. It hardly seems that the best solution
has been arrived at when one representative is to serve 47 per cent of
the student body. The on-campus representatives each will serve 8.8 per
cent of the student body.)
If numerical apportionment is unfair under the old plan of living' area
representation, why not revise the plan rather than dispense with it alto
gether?
We urge readers of this letter to consider these points carefully before
voting on the Constitution today. It is regrettable that this Constitution,
which shows a great deal of work, should stand or fall on the basis of
one section. But this issue of student representation is so vital to our
entire system of student government, that, on the basis of it. we urge that
the Constitution be rejeced in today's election.

To the Editor:
The discussion of the proposed ASSU Constitution which is being' voted
on today has brought out two major points of debate. First, the vote now
must be a complete yes or a complete no rather than a point-by-point
expression of opinion. The Constitution itself makes amendment most
difficult and consequently any provisions which do not prove practicable
will be nearly impossible to change.
Excom representation is the provision of the Constitution which has
brought about most debate.
Ted Norton, in his letter to The Daily last week, contended that Excom
members should vote in accordance with "their own good judgment," and
thereby minimize the necessity for a plan of Excom representation that
would have for its primary consideration the best means whereby students
could make their opinions known to their Excom representatives. This
would remove the greatest argument against the plan of Excom repre
sentation proposed in the new Constitution.
We answer that Excom, at least on major issues, should represent the
will of the students rather than that of the Excom members alone. Failure
tc do so on one or two past occasions has aroused a great deal of justi
fiable resentment.
Therefore, we maintain that any acceptable plan of Excom represen
tation should insure, in so far as is possible, the opportunity of students
to make their opinions known to their representatives.
Living area representation can best accomplish this through the medium
of house meetings and dinner announcements. Class representation cannot
compete on this basis. (There would seem to be no more justification for
representation by class than for representation at large.)
The problem of representing ofT-campus students will be present under
any system. Wouldn't it be better to have them fairly represented as a
group rather than, • nominally, as portions of University classes? (Dean
Kimpton, in last month's Alumni Review states that 47 per cent of the
student body is living off-campus. It hardly seems that the best solution
has been arrived at when one representative is to serve 47 per cent of
the student body. The on-campus representatives each will serve 8.8 per
cent of the student body.)
