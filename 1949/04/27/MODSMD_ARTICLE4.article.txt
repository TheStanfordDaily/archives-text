# Letter to the Student Body
## 
### 
For a number of years, the efficiency of student government has been
hampered by a complex and burdensome Constitution. Rather than try
ing to continue working with the present Constitution, it was suggested
last fall that a new one be written.
I don't believe that it is necessary to elaborate on the amount of time
spent by the committee interviewing students, talking with group*, hold
ing open hearings, and doing research. After two quarters' work, the
finished product is a workable, simplified, and well-coordinated Con
stitution which is based on a consistent policy. The loose ends of the
old plan have been tied, and the by-laws will take care of the many
sections which formerly cluttered the Constitution.
There have been some mechanical changes, but the principles are
basically the same. The Executive Committee recommends the adoption
of the proposed Constitution. It's a great improvement over the old one.
and it will give student government the well-organized document that
it has needed.
