In the Autumn Quarter 1948, Excom appointed a couimittee to study and make revisions on the
Constitution of the A.S.S.U. This committee reviewed the present Constitution and came to the con
clusion that it would he necessary to rewrite and recommend an entirely new Constitution, in order to
resolve inconsistencies and duplications.
I lie committee held meetings among themselves, interviewed numerous students, faculty, and Ad
ministration leaders, conducted open hearings, and studied numerous issues, problems, and conflicts,
in order to write this attached Constitution.
