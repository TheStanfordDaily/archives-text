# Thru Breier's Pipe
## Have YOU Doped the Track Meet? 
### JOHN BREIER 
Everyone is doping the track meet. Coaches, sportswriters, trackmen,
ROTC personnel, students, and the men and women on the streets have
taken pens in hand to figure just who will win the Stanford-USC track
meet.
From here it looks to be just too close. Most of the dope sheets will be
wrong for the simple reason that Coaches Weiershauser and Hill will be
.shifting entries in the various events right up to meet time.
But writers are not far uft' when they describe the affair as the best, or
near-best dual meet in the nation. For not only will Olympians Mel
Patton and Bob Chambers be competing for the Trojans, but in Stanford
the fans will be watching the best field squad in college circles.
As a team, the Farm fieldmen could win any dual meet in the country
and probably score enough points to take the title in NCAA competition.
Let's look at the record.
field's Javelin Mark Is Best of Year
In Bud Held the Cards have the best javelin tosser of the year. Add
another three feet to his toss of 231 feet 51 â€¢> inches and he would rank
as third-best among the all-time American spear throwers. As it is, he
leads the pack, college or club, for this season's work.
The work of Chandler and Davis doesn't have to be gone over here.
It is sufficient to say that one or the other would place first in just about
every dual meet. The other should be second.
Off his marks thus fur this year. Gay Bryan would score in two events.
His 25-foot -Hj-inch leap is the best broad jump mark recorded in the
nation this year. His best effort in the high jump, 6 feet 5 inches, should
be good enough to win or place in most dual meets.
In the discus the Farm tossers are fair. But Steve McKee and Chandler
could score in most meets. McKee can hit around 150 feet and Chandler
isn t too far back at 14G leet. Neither mark is tops, but few teams have
two men throwing so well.
It is in the pole vault that Stanford would drop points. However. Weier
shauser has three men that at one time or another have cleared 13 feet.
This mark is not high as modern pole vaulting goes. The Cards could
pick up a third here against most of the teams that would be entered in
this fictional dual field meet.
Cards' All-Around Strength Would Win
It is true that there have been better collegiate marks posted in four
out of the six field events. But no other school could enter a team so strong
in all events.
And the credit must go to one man. Two years ago Bud Held had never
thrown a javelin, but under Weieishauser he has progressed until he is
one of the best of all-time Americans. Chandler learned to put the shot
under Black Jack, and so on down the line.
And the strange part of the whole thing is that Weiershauser, the man
who puts out great field teams, was known in collegiate days for his
sprint records. Some of his marks still stand. Part of the answer, of
course, is material. But a much larger portion is in the coaching.
All of which makes for a thrilling meet come Saturday. The final
result, either way, may well be decided by the "come through" perform
ances of seme of the lesser-known men.
Seldom has student interest been so high. And it is rightly so, for' the
chance to beat SC in track comes but once in a decade, or so it has been
witli Stanford. This may be the turning point.
