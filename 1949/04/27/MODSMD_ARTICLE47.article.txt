## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR

and co-captains Mel Patton and Bill
Bayless of USC will lead their re
spective teams to the mighty clash

Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Much of Stanford's hopes for vic
tory will rest on Bryan's shoulders.

ford ace has been in top form, scor
ing 18 points against UCLA, 23 |
points against San Jose State, and
20 points last Saturday against the |
Olympic Club and Compton Col- 1
lege.
Of course, the going will be tough
when Bryan clashes with USC this
Saturday, but "iron man" Bryan is ;
just the person who could come !
through and win the meet for the ,
Cards.
Patton Is Known
Everyone knows the greatness of j
USC's star sprinter and co-captain
for the Stanford meet, Mel Patton.
Although Patton has already

achieved the greatest honors a track
man can hold, namely holding a
world's record and being an Olym
pic winner, "Pell-Mell" decided to
compete again for his alma mater
this year to help them keep their
top national ranking.
Patton was pressed in his first
meet ol the year against Michigan
State in the Los Angeles Coliseum,
but clearly showed his superiority
last Saturday against Cal when he
won the 100 and the 220 handily. His
century time in the Bear contest
was :09.6, and he romped the fur
long in :20.9.
Bayless Has Big Job
For several years, co-captain Bill
Bayless has led a healthy crop of
Trojan weightmen. Bayless edged
Stanford's Otis Chandler last year
in the PCC meet when he heaved
the shot 53 ft. 8 7 * in.
