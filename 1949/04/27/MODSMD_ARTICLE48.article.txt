# Stanford Nine Hosts Gaels
## 
### 
St. Mary's timid Gaels will make
their first local appearance of the
season this afternoon when Johnny
Vergez and his last-place nine in
vade the Sunken Diamond to bat
tle Stanford. First pitch is set for ,
3:15.
Lefty Dave Dahle will take the |
hill for Stanford in an attempt to
toss the Cards to their fourth league 1
win. Dahle looked great in his two- !
inning stint against USC last Sat
urday, and figures to treat the Gaels |
in the same manner.
Troubled with mid-game ineffec- !
tiveness, Dahle has managed to flip
only two winning efforts this sea- '

son, and yet at times he is one of
the fanciest flingers in the CIBA.
Pitching woe has canceled out
Stanford's heavy hitting all season,
as the Cards have scored enough
runs and collected enough bingles
to be leading the loop, but instead
they possess a mediocre 3-4 record.
St. Mary's will be out after its
second win today, the Gaels' other
success being a 1-0 eke-out over
UCLA.
Both St: Mary's and Stanford
dropped their last CIBA contest, the
Indians blowing a 9-7 nod to USC.
and the Gaels being blanked by
Ca'ifornia, 3-0.
