# Campus Police Nab Cagey, But Apologetic, 'Carillonneur'
## 
### 
Stanford police caught the stu
dent carillonneur just before mid
night Monday as he tried to escape
from the Hoover Library.
Monday was the third time in a
week that the man had entered the
Library to ting the bells from the
keyboard 240 feet up in the tower.
Campus Chief of Police Gordy
Davis said two night patrolmen. Sgt.
Jess Headley and John B. McKeon,
plus a dormitory watchman, G. W.
Jensen, guarded the front and rear
entrances to the Libe. One of the
men entered the building and
caught the student.
Davis said he did not know how
the man was able to reach the ca
rillon keyboard on the 14th floor of
the structure. "Someone may have
coached him," Davis surmised. "We
think he played the carillon in order
to carry out a bet."
The intruder apparently did not
tamper with any other equipment
or books in the building, Davis said.
"We will have to find out how he
was able to get in and out of the
building so that we can prevent re
peat performances in the future," he
added.
