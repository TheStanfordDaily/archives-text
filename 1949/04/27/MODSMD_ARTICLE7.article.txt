# Sixteen Roughs Eye Top ASSU Position
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
Nominations for spring quarter
elections begin tomorrow, and cam
pus interest in politics is already
beginning to rise again. More than
the usual number have already
committed themselves to run for the
top student office, that of ASSU
president.
Topping the list is Hank Rosin,
Encina sponsor and past president
of the Class of '50. Although Rosin
will not say definitely that he is
running, bull sessions have it that
he will be a strong candidate.
Rosin, if he runs, will probably
be supported by Encina and the
eating clubs (he is a member of El
Toro) as well as by members of hLs
class, in which he has been very
active for the past three years.
Skip Athearn, also a junior and
a veteran debater, has been men
tioned by some of the other candi
dates as a possibility. Athearn, a
member of Theta Xi, is out of town
debating at present, so it was im
possible to get a statement from
him.
I>< m Fix. Lower Row Excom rep
resentative and football player, has
thrown his hat into the ring by
definitely announcing that he will
run. Fix is a member of Theta Chi.
Also from the Row is ATO Down
in? McKee, who is best known as

Stanford's most valuable hurdler.
McKee's fraternity brothers say he
will be a candidate.
Trackster Gay Bryan. SAE. who
was being talked up by friends, J
says that lie will not be a candidate. !
Among those who have also de- i
nied being interested in the presi
dency is Tom Armstrong, Village 1
Excom representative. This leaves i
the Village without a candidate, if
Armstrong means what he says; al- !
though it is too soon, of course, to
say that no one will run from that
large body of students.
Daily Sports Editor John Hall,
Delta Tau Delta, has announced that
he will be a candidate.
Mark llatiield. although friends
tried to start a move to "draft" him,
says he will not run as he has ac
cepted a teaching position for next \
year.
Theta Delta Chi brothers of Ted
LeVino, who has been Interfrater- ;
nity president tiiis year, say that he !
also will not be a candidate.
From off campus, the largest
group of Farm students, the names
of Art Herzog and George Velliotes
have been mentioned as probable
nominees. Herzog is a member of
Excom. and Velliotes is best known
as a Daily Bull Sessioner.
Gordon Ness, a potentially strong
candidate living off campus this
year, states that the Campus Auto

Club is keeping him too busy to
run.
Two more Encina sponsors, Bob
Armstrong and Pat De Young, com
plete the list of those who have
been mentioned most often as can
didates. Armstrong, a Kappa Al
pha, has not stated whether he will
run or not and De Young, who is a
Zete, declines to say.
T iji brothers of footballer Emery
Mitchell say that he also is "think
ing seriously" of announcing his
candidacy.
Frank Wolff, last year's runner
up, who has been chairman of the
Foreign Students Committee this
year, will not be a nominee, friends
say.
So far, then, the Row and Encina
seem to be well represented with
candidates while the Village and
Toyon have not put forth anyone.
Although Stanford students have
never voted as members of dis
tricts, and the presidency has often
changed hands between Row and
hall, many campus politicos believe
the election is decided by the wom
en. who turn out at the polls in
numbers which defy the ratio.
Speculation at this point as to
who will win is difficult, but one
thing seems certain. Next, year's
nresident will be the man who can
convince the whole campus that he
will represent them all, if past years
are any indication.
