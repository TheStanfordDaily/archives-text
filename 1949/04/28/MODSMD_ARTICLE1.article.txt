# Excom Tables NSA For Another Week
## 
### 
Excom decided last night to postpone its decision for another
week on whether or not the ASSU should continue its affiliation
with the National Students' Association next year.
Following a two-hour debate on the issue, the motion to table
the proposal until next Wednesday was carried without opposi-

tion, in order that Excom repre
sentatives might carry the question
back to then constituents.
It was generally conceded by Ex
com that the NSA has little to offer
the ASSU on a local scale, inasmuch
as most of its campus functions are
being carried out by student or
ganizations already in existence at
Stanford. It was therefore ques
toned whether or not the few ad
vantages of national representation
are worth the $D7G a year member
ship dues.
John Motheral and Mark Hatfield
spoke against continuing member
ship in the NSA, while. Erskine
Chi'ders, regional NSA chairman
and member of the national com
mittee, defended it.
Motheral disclosed the results of
an opinion poll taken during the
past two weeks which revealed that

72 per cent of the student body is
against continuing membership in
the national organizaton another
year.
Many of those interviewed gave
their dislike of national political
representation of the entire student
body by any organization as reason
fur opposing continued membership
in NSA.
Erskine Childers admitted that
the difficulty of obtaining student
opinion as a basis for voting at re
giona] meetings litis been one of the
weaknesses of the program at Stan
ford.
Excom member Mark Hatfield
summed up vvth the remark that
"As it stands now NSA is being run
by people who don't represent stu
dents. but who represent only their
own views.
In other business last night Ex
com heard reports from the Foreign
Scholarships Program and the Stu
dent Health Committee.
The vote on the new constitution
was approved, and Ed Wells was
appointed student manager for the
summer quarter.
