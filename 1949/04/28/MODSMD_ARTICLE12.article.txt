## 
### 
Rally Com wishes to remind all
groups interested in participating
in the Spring Sing to sign up at the
ASSU office as soon as possible. En
tries may be registered not later
than 5 p.m. Monday.
A mixed division has been added
tliis year to the traditional men's,
women's, and novelty groups, mak
ing' possible the selection of songs
of greater tone range than those
available to male or female voices
alone.
This year, too, for the first time a
trophy will be awarded to the best
group in the entire Spring Sing,
such group being excluded from its
division award.
