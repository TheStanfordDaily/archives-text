# Woe Are the Phi Sig Actives: The Pledges Got Their Pants
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
"I see London, I see France. I
see the Phi Sigs without their
pants."
That might well be the by-word
of Phi Sigma Kappa pledges who
absconded with almost all of the
brothers' trousers at 3:40 yesterday <
morning and left in their place sun
dry burlap bags, labeled "Phi Sig
ma Kappa Active."
According to an unnamed pledge
who talked with The Daily yester
day, the pledges journeyed from Eti
cina Hall to the fraternity house at
3:20 a.m. Since a brother, John Ull
man, was still studying, the plotting
pledges were forced to wait until
3:40 before they entered the house, I
"borrowed" every pair of slacks, i
levis, suit and tux pants that they
could find, and vanished unobserved
into the night.
'"They were very thorough," com
plained active Don Paisley. "But
they slipped up in a few rooms."
Thanks to these slip-ups, some of
the actives had breeches to climb
into when the alarm was sounded
yesterday morning. At 5:30, said
Paisley, active Norm Miller burst
onto the sleeping porches shouting: I
"Everything's gone! The pledges
took everything!"
Digging into old trunks and boxes I
for a few garments overlooked by j

the culprits, a posse of actives de
scended upon Encina and rounder
up five of the guilty pledges.
These pledges, reported active
John Ulhnan, were "taken for r
long walk." and were made to ex
change their pants for the gunny
sacks."
"They must have been planning
it for weeks," said Paisley. Another
pantless active, Sal Coletto. pointed
out that each pledge had been as
signed to a separate room.
A pledge revealed that the job
was pulled in only 15 minutes.
Earlier in the evening Ed Leon,
work chairman, walked in on a
confab the pledges were holding
in an Encina room and was prompt
ly tied up. He was released afte:
the deed was accomplished.
Yesterday evening the clothing
was still missing. Self-satisfied
pledges announced to The Daih
that it was safely stored in a house
oft' campus and would be returned
today in front of the Post Office.
