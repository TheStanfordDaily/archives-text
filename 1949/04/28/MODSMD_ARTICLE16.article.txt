# Touring Farm Debaters Outtalk Princeton Team
## 
### 
Ronald Klein and Skip Athearn, Stanford debaters touring
various eastern colleges, defeated the Princeton varsity debate
team Tuesday night at Whig Hall on the Princeton campus. Whig
Hall is the home of the Princeton Whig Cloisophic Society, the
oldest debate organization in the nation.
According to a wire received yesterday by the Stanford de-

' ;ite coach, Professor James Gordon
Emerson, the Farm pair took the
affirmative on the subject of federal
aid to education. Last night Klein
and Athearn were scheduled to de
bate Georgetown University.
An explanation of the Intercol
legiate Tournament at West Point
last weekend stated that Klein fin
ished in 11th place in the individual
standings out of (il> competitors from
nil over the United States.
The combined individual standings
of tlu- two Stanford debaters were
higher than those of the winners
from Alabama, even though the
Stanfordites won only three out of
tight debates, while the victors won
seven out of eight.
This can be explained by the fact
that all the debates were very close,
and strategy often swung the de
bate victory, while the individual
ratings are based on clarity of pre
sentation, analysis, and ability in ex
temporaneous speaking.
In the tournament Stanford de
feated De Pauw, University of Chi
cago, and George Washington Uni
versity. They lost to Navy, Ottawa
(Kansas), Montana, Notre Dame,
and Southwestern State College
(Texas).
Miller McClintock. who was Stan
ford debate coach prior to 1921, and
who is now president of the Mutual
Broadcasting Company, coached the
Stanford debaters for three days be
fore the tournament. He was also
one ot the judges for the tourna
ment.
