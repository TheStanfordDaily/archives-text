Twice in recent editorials we criticized a University professor

by an unidentified and immature youth destroyed any construc
tive points our writing meant to convey.

The student's action was not amusing; it was not constructive.
It prematurely ended an excellent lecture being presented by
»one of the most qualified men in the field.
Joe College activities have their time and place, and good taste
requires that they be kept out of the classrooms.
