## Is the Red Dance Legal? 
### 
To the Editor:
I was not much surprised when I found on campus the other day a
mimeographed slip reading "A redistribution of wealth is coming—the
Common Man will dance on April 30." It could have been the Young
Communist League of Menlo Park, Mayfield, and Milpitas again—or the
underground forces devoted to keeping John Pool at Yale, now that he's
back there. However, now that the Hammer and Sickle are flaunted from
every bulletin board it dawns on me that this is all a gag. a publicity
device for a dance to be given by one of the local tongs Saturday. And
this poses an interesting question.
For example, Dr. Sterling has stated that he doubts that a good card
holding party-member Communist can be a good teacher. But "da prex"
also said that it was necessary to study Communism. It is pretty clear,
100, that any student organization that took its Communism seriously
would have a slim chance of getting any kind of official approval. Now
we have the Delta Chi's who want to laugh at Communism. As they say
in the Law School, where do you draw the line?
Consider the effect on an elderly, well-heeled Republican alumnus of
a huge Hammer and Sickle on the front wall of the Union. Who knows,
he might turn his financial affections to one of those state institutions
which Jack Tenney has so carefully purged. And, remember this: the
University must be non-partisan. Is it "partisan political action" to make
fun of partisan political action?
The usual answer to this sort of question would be for Excom to appoint
a committee. This is probably a good idea in this case. too. One more
committee would never be noticed, and no known ASSU committee could
possibly hold a meeting and report before the dance comes of! Saturday
night.
