chairmen or VAC members on the
ball to drop notices of your doings
in the box provided in the VAC
office at the Village center.

Paul Lcntz, of the Village co
weds, woke up everyone in his old
dorm the other morning at 1 o'clock

yelled. "It's half grown already."

American squares: The folk danc
ing under caller Bill Barnhart is in
full swing every Friday evening in
the Village auditorium. Beginners
have the floor from 7:30 to 9, and
the advanced do-si-do-ers take over
after that until 10:30. Everyone is
welcomed.
Paul IvaufTnian at the Village is a
physical culture enthusiast. But he
carries it further than a lot of them.
He has moved his bed out of his
room, lie sleeps in a sleeping bag
on the floor. He eats no desserts
but takes three salads each meal.
Every evening he runs one or two
miles around the Village. That's
supposed to make you live to be an
old man.
