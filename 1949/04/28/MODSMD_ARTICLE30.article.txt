# East, West Wrangle For Control of Austria

### JOHN HUSH 
(Editor's Note: The following
story is based on an interview
with Josef Wiesingcr, graduate
political science student from
Lin/, Austria. lie has tried to
analyze Austria's position here
from as objective a viewpoint as
possible, reflecting what lie feels
to he the general feeling of the
people and leaders of that coun
try.)

While the great powers wrangle
over big Germany to the north and
the west, there is quite a drama
heing enacted in the small state of
Austria, nestled between the Red
bloc to the cast and south and the
Atlantic Alliance powers to the
west. Although Austria is neither
great in area nor in controversty,
she is important to watch in observ
ing the overall game of internation
al politics.
The reasons for this are several,
two of which are worthy of par
ticular note.
I'irst. Austria is historically the
farthest eastern frontier of the
Western world. She has been the
battleground for great clashes be
tween the Slavic and the Mongol
peoples from the East and the Euro
pean civilization on the West.
Bridgehead to West
At present, this nation would
serve as a most valuable bridgehead
for Communist expansion into Italy,
Switzerland, and Bavaria. It would
be quite foolish to underestimate
tlie importance of this situation. II
the Iron Curtain countries decide to
move into these areas, they will most
certainly go through Austria.
In the rarefied atmosphere of our
position across two continents >*ind
an ocean, it is easy to fall into such
and illusion. We hear little but
good news from Vienna; it is cor
rectly reported that Russian and
Western troops get along in quite
admirable fashion there.
On the other hand, it must be re
membered that Russia does not con
sider it vital to lior interests to make
a big fuss in Austria. Although the
reduction of troops in all the zones
has been accomplished on a more or
less equal basis, the Communists,
(and the Austrians. much to their
dismay) also realize that they are
much closer geographically, and
thus more dangerous militarily than
is the United States.
Atlantic Pact 'lest
Second, Austria can be interpreted
as a sounding-board for the political
results of the newly-signed Atlantic
Pact. There have been wrought sii>-
nificant changes in the feeling of
the people toward their heretofore
almost helpless position.
Directly following the surrender
ol Fortress Europe, the Austrians
feared greatly an American return
to isolationism. They remembered

the results of our staying out of the
postwar peace machinery after
World War I, and they did not want
a repeat performance.
At the outset, Austria hoped and
expected that the occupation would
be short. But at that time they did
not foresee the extent to which Red
aggrandizement would be carried.
Now, they look upon it with mixed
emotions: both of resentment, and
oi relief. They had hoped that Aus
tria would be left free to rebuild
herself democratically. But with tho
ever-increasing pressure from the
East, they realized that perhaps the
presence of American troops would
turn out to be a blessing.
Needs American Support
At this time, the Atlantic Pact
protects Austria only because West
ern occupation troops are there. 11
we should pull out, even with the
Russians following suit, she would
be placed in an extremely perilous
spot.
The signing of the pact has so far
had this effect: it has dispelled much
of the apathetic feeling towards
political and economic reconstruc
tion that was created by the occu
pation. If the American troops
should leave Austria in the next six
months, Austria probably would at
tempt to become a signatory to the
pact. This, however, would depend
on the outcome of the November
elections in that country.

In the rarefied atmosphere of our
position across two continents >*ind
an ocean, it is easy to fall into such
and illusion. We hear little but
good news from Vienna; it is cor
rectly reported that Russian and
Western troops get along in quite
admirable fashion there.
On the other hand, it must be re
membered that Russia does not con
sider it vital to lior interests to make
a big fuss in Austria. Although the
reduction of troops in all the zones

Atlantic Pact 'lest
Second, Austria can be interpreted
as a sounding-board for the political
results of the newly-signed Atlantic
Pact. There have been wrought sii>-
nificant changes in the feeling of
the people toward their heretofore
almost helpless position.
Directly following the surrender
ol Fortress Europe, the Austrians
feared greatly an American return
to isolationism. They remembered

the results of our staying out of the
postwar peace machinery after
World War I, and they did not want
a repeat performance.
At the outset, Austria hoped and
expected that the occupation would
be short. But at that time they did
not foresee the extent to which Red
aggrandizement would be carried.
Now, they look upon it with mixed
emotions: both of resentment, and
oi relief. They had hoped that Aus
tria would be left free to rebuild
herself democratically. But with tho
ever-increasing pressure from the
East, they realized that perhaps the
presence of American troops would
turn out to be a blessing.
Needs American Support
At this time, the Atlantic Pact
protects Austria only because West
ern occupation troops are there. 11
we should pull out, even with the
Russians following suit, she would
be placed in an extremely perilous
spot.
The signing of the pact has so far
had this effect: it has dispelled much
of the apathetic feeling towards
political and economic reconstruc
tion that was created by the occu
pation. If the American troops
should leave Austria in the next six
months, Austria probably would at
tempt to become a signatory to the
pact. This, however, would depend
on the outcome of the November
elections in that country.
