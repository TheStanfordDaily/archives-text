# Stanford Players Make a Hit In 'Petrified Forest' Staging
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The curtain in the Little Theater
rang down last night on one of the
most enjoyble plays the Stanford
Players have produced this yearâ€”
"The Petrified Forest."
Supported by an outstanding cast,
Ann Guilbert performed her lead
ing part as the not -so - innocent
young thing with great naturalness
and ease. Director Paul Hostetler is
to be commended for making excel
lent choices in casting.
Plaudits for brilliant perform
ances go to the leading male actor,

John Fever, the disheartened poet;
and to supporting actors Bertram
Brauer, the 'reminiscing grandfa
ther, and James Haran, the self
centered football hero.
Robert Sherwood's drama of the
'thirties portrayed the post-dcpres
sion disillusioned attitude along
with topics of the day such as the
Dillinger rage. The whole was
spiced with side remarks on the
American Legion and hero egotism,
and colored by a curious, affable
grandfather. Yet the production was
much more than a picture of a pe
riod in American life. It entertain
ingly presented a philosophy of life
in everyday terms.
Harold Niven, in designing a
shabby, desolate restaurant - gas
station, achieved interest and real
ism by such items as an old wall
box telephone, outdated cash regis
ter. and NRA and patriotism signs.
Sound effects were a little crude,
but this only served to add to the
mirth of an audience who still re
membered the protesting sounds of
the old cars.
"The Petrified Forest" will be
given at 8:15 tonight, tomorrow, and
Saturday night. Tickets returned to
the box office may be purchased
just before curtain time at the door.
