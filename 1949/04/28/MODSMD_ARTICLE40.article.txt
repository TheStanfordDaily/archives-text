Women's Clubhouse, between 3:15
and 5 p.m. Application blanks may
be filled out at the time of the

The coming school year will mark
the 25th for women sponsoring.
Sponsors for freshman women were
first appointed under Dean Mary
Yost in 1924. At that time, all
freshman women and independents
lived at Roble, where the independ
ents gave the new women a helping
hand.
The sorority women, seeking an
opportunity to get to know the
freshmen, asked Miss Yost if they
could act as advisers at Roble. Thus
the sponsor system was created, and
the sorority women were allowed
two - quarter leaves from their
houses for the purpose.
Later, junior and senior sponsors
were provided for each corridor.
The sponsors run the hall the first
i quarter, then gradually turn the
dormitory government over to the
residents during the winter quarter.
There are sponsors in all Univar
! sity residences where there are
. freshman women.
