# Temperature Rises For Trojan Clash
## Card Cindermen Prep for Big Battle with Trojan Champs 
### 
The tension is mounting hourly. With the colossal Stanford-
CSC track meet only the day alter tomorrow, everyone is anxious
ly waiting for the great tussle.
With wind roaring down the runway, Stanford's final major
■■•orkout of the week was held yesterday in Stanford Stadium,

under the close supervision of Coac 1 -
Jack Weiershau ier.
Tlie seasoned Indian athletes per
formed in guod mid-week style,
i lost workouts being at a pace
(hree-quarters distance.
Everyone "Dopes" Vecl
Meanwhile, armchair athletes all
over the Pacific Coast were trying
"dope out" the Tndian - Trojan
rliel. A surprise second here, and
c.ose third there could change the
complexion of the entire meet.
Little is known about the Troians'
final workouts. The men of Troy
have been unusually quiet about
their best performances this year,
for instance, not a single time trial
in the all-important mile event has
been reported all season, except for
Bob Chambers'- winning four - lap
mark of 4:22.8 in the Compton meet.
Just what do the Trojans have in
this event? Chambers probably will
be kept busy running the quarter,
the half, and the relay, and may
have to bypass the four-lap event.

Who will oppose Stanford's A 1
Lyons?
Mitchell in i:2l
USC's Bobby Mitchell reportedly
ran a 4:21 mile against Michigan
State two weeks ago. The Michigan
State trio easily swept the event, so
Mitchell's effort was overlooked.
There may be some other Trojan
sleepers in the distance events that
could upset the dope. John Cherry,
a miler and two-miler, could be
ready for his best efforts of the
season. SC's Will Bailie is report
. edly in the 4:2o's, and could be
ready to cut loose this Saturday.
The ability of Norm Stocks,
| Southern Cal sophomore, in both
the quarter-mile and the relay, is
still in doubt. The Trojan ace led
his teammates to a sweep in the 440
last Saturday against Cal, but the
time was a comparatively slow
: 19.7.
"One-Two" 110 Punch
Of course. Inidans Larry Hoff and
Pitch Johnson will be favored to
beat the fast-footed Stocks. How

ever, the Card "one-two" punch,
Hoff and Johnson, vyill probably also
have run to against Bob Chambers
and Wells DeLoach, both dangerous
men.
Another big question mark is
Troy's A 1 Lawrence. Lawrence has
some great times to his credit,
most of which, however, were made
a few years a.yo.
11 Dick Atllesley fades for Troy
in the high hurdles, it's up to Law
rence to prevent a clean sweep for
Stanford.
Lawrence's ability in the lows is
also in doubt. It is true that the
Decathlon prospect came through to
win ihe event last week against Cal.
but before the Bear contest, Law
rence was strictly a place or show
man.
Low Ilurdles in Doubt
Whether "iron-man" Gay Bryan
ol the Cards can break USC's mo
nopoly in the low barriers is an

other question. Along with Law
rence. is Troy's veteran Ronnie Fra
zier. whom Bryan defeated easily
last year in the Coliseum. Both men
are in the low 23V.
Probably the most undecided of
all the events is the discus. Until
last Saturday, it seemed a sure one
two event for the Indians. However,
co-captain Bill Bayless upset the
dope by heaving the discus 147 feet
last Saturday after a previous best
I toss of only 139 feet.
Ibis tremendous effort by Bayless
put him in the favorite's role to
cop the discus this week, but Cards
Otis Chandler and Steve McKee
have different ideas. McKee threw
over ].10 feet last year in the Trojan
encounter. Chandler has been steady
.ill year around 145 feet, and could
easily edge Bayless.
Whatever the case may be, the
meet will probably be close enough
lo be decided on the relay.


GAY BRYAN. Stanford's leading hope to take Troy next Saturday, is
shown here nipping Compton's Bill Fell in their 220 duel last week.
Galloping Gay may he entered in as many as six events Saturday, as
he plans to take part in the 100, 220, low hurdles, high jump, and broad
jump. If things get too close, lie may run a leg of the relay.
