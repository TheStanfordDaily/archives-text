# Green Tribesmen Lose Fairway Meet
## 
### 
The San Jose State golf team
made it three in a row over Stan
lord s golfers yesterday afternoon,
as the Spartans won a hotly dis
puted 14 1 to victory.
Ihe inexperienced Indians gave
the national champions a whale of
a battle, and although none of the
medal scores were especially good
the Cardinal divoters played steady
golf. Given a lew breaks in the
right places, Stanford would have
won.
Bob Crozier returned to action
yesterday, but he still showed the
efleets of a bruised foot that he in
curred in a volleyball game last
Friday night. Crozier played the
number six position.
The Indians got oIY to a bad start
on the first hole, when Ross Smith's
sizzling approach shot hit Ernie
Kellberg's caddie, who was holding
the pin. The ball dropped two feet
from the pin. and Smith holed ovil
to halve the hole. The hole was
protested, however.
The frosh easily defeated Menlo
JC for the second time, 26-1.
