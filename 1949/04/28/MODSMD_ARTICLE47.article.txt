# Phi Sigs Trounce AKL Softballers
## 
### 
Phi Sigma Kappa's softballers
blasted the AKL dianiondmen 15-2
yesterday afternoon in a mural slug
ging carnival featured by the twirl
ing and hitting of Phi Sig Bob
Cook.
Cook hurled hitless ball until the
final inning, when the AKL lads
combined their only two base
knocks of the ball game with an
inopportune Phi Sig error to tally
their brace of runs.
Syl Co!etto and Jerry Schulte
provided Cook with some sterling
infield support, while Max Money's
work in the outer gardens high
lighted the losers' play.
In mural volleyball games played
yesterday, Crothers II whipped El
Toro; Encina 2E downed their dor
mates from the basement; the Dekes
won over SAE II; Phi Delt's Trojans
took the measure of the Dekelets;
SAE 111 evened the count for their
house by walloping the Theta Chi
Blues; and Village 312 nipped Vil
lage 212.
