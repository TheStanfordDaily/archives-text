# El Troje Always Tough But Tribe Always Trying
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Once upon a time in A.D.
1933, a bunch of Indians who
were tired of being down
trodden by their Trojan op
pressors, rose up and did a
strange and miraculous thing.
Those Indians, 1933 miracle vin
tage. put together enough bows and
arrows to whip the mechanical
monsters from the Southern King
: dom. G7-63, in a contest called a
i track meet.
But the joy of victory was not
: long in existence.
In that very same year, Cromwell
| the Great lashed his Trojan horde
; into a wild frenzy, and the thick
| sku'led but fast-footed barbarians
slapped the Tribe right back into
j servitude and bondage. 72-59.
Stanford King Till 192G
Since that date, King Troy, wear
| ing a twisted smile and a cashmere
i sweater, has been a merciless slave
; driver, and in the annual contest
j between master and slave he has
clear'y proven his superiority.
Yet what few historians realize is
that Stanford, once a glorious and
powerful tribe in its own right, de
feated the Trojans the first 22 times
they met, a record which still stands
as the longest win streak of the In
dian-Trojan wars.
Stanford also holds an edge in
j total victories, having won 2(3 meets
| to USC's 17. Those statistics, how
j ever, were established long !>efore
j the era of the paycheck and the free
I ride.
Finally, in 192G, the Indians were
j conquered for the first time, and the
| reign ot Troy was on.
But history has a strrnae way
jof reverting back. Stanford, once
again in this modern day of 1949.
j has mustered enough power to
threaten the Trojans.
Trojans Uncanny in Clutch
But one must be cautious in deal
j ing with the mechanical men from
I Troy. Bitter experiences in the past
I show that Cromwellian Culture has

no knowledge of the word defeat.
These primitive Figueroa foot
specialists, manufactured in a fancy
speed factory at Bovard Field, get
uncanny in the clutch, issue forth a
fienaish cry of "Fight on." and then
proceed to wolfishly devour any
lambs who wander too far off the
beaten path.
Once in 1940 this type of thing
occurred. Stanford had built itself
another strong track empire and ap
peared ready to overthrow SC. And
that 1940 outfit was probably good
enough to deserve the title of being
Stanford's greatest track squad.
Daily sports scribes in those days
went whole - hog. They cheered
through early season Card landslide
wins, and then picked the Indians
to bash the Trojans, (59-1)2.
Iroy Does It A sain
Men such as miler Paul Moore,
sprinter Clyde Jeffrey, and weight
man Stan Anderson would turn the
trick, they said.
But when the dust had cleared,
the mechanical men from Trojan
town had gobbled up all the ques
tionable places to win the meet, 71
to 58.
Stanford gained a little revenge
that year by nosing Troy in the
Fresno Relays, but the fact re
mained that USC was king of the
Dual Meet contestants, and that the
Trojans were very much opposed to
giving up the honor. They still are.
However, in 1949, the year of the
golden gams of Gay Bryan, a new
story may be unfolding.
The mechanical men have be
come a little rusty, and it's tirr*»
they were taken apart and put back
together again.
So ro:l out that great big Tro'an
horse: the sawdust pits need filling.

Ever since he was an undergraduate
at ilu- University of Chicago, Charles
H. Percy bus been a young business
man in a hurry. To work his way!
through college (his banker father ha i
gone broke in the depression). Chuck:
Percy ran a wholesale business supply
ing the university's fraternities witlt
food. coal, furniture and linen. He als<>
held two other jobs, and captained tlm
rough, tough water polo team. In tho
summer vacation of 11)37 he took a job
at Si: a week in Chicago's Belt &
Howell Co. (cameras). For the next
111 j years he was in & out of Bel! <&
Howell, but was seldom out of thrt
mind of its president, Joe 11. McXabb,
It was McNabb who persuadeJ
Chuck Percy to work for Bell & Howell
on weekends and vacations, and giv<r
him a full-time job When he graduate!
from Chicago in 1941. He was put in
charge of a new department to handle
defense contracts. The contracts rolled
in so fast that six months later, whert
Percy was 21, he v,as in charge of thf;
major part of Bell & Howell's business
Just before he joined the Xavy ji 1
seaman. McXabb made him assistant,
secretary and a company director.
New Theme. Stationed on the West
Coast. Percy spent his spare timj
studying West Coast industries and
the causes of strikes. His reports sd
impressed McXabb that when Chuck
Percy was discharged (as lieutenant),
he became Bell & Howell's industrial,
relations and personnel director.

Once upon a time in A.D.
1933, a bunch of Indians who
were tired of being down
trodden by their Trojan op
pressors, rose up and did a
strange and miraculous thing.
Those Indians, 1933 miracle vin
tage. put together enough bows and
arrows to whip the mechanical
monsters from the Southern King
: dom. G7-63, in a contest called a
i track meet.
But the joy of victory was not
: long in existence.
In that very same year, Cromwell
| the Great lashed his Trojan horde
; into a wild frenzy, and the thick
| sku'led but fast-footed barbarians
slapped the Tribe right back into
j servitude and bondage. 72-59.
Stanford King Till 192G
Since that date, King Troy, wear
| ing a twisted smile and a cashmere
i sweater, has been a merciless slave
; driver, and in the annual contest
j between master and slave he has
clear'y proven his superiority.
Yet what few historians realize is
that Stanford, once a glorious and
powerful tribe in its own right, de
feated the Trojans the first 22 times
they met, a record which still stands
as the longest win streak of the In
dian-Trojan wars.
Stanford also holds an edge in
j total victories, having won 2(3 meets
| to USC's 17. Those statistics, how
j ever, were established long !>efore
j the era of the paycheck and the free
I ride.
Finally, in 192G, the Indians were
j conquered for the first time, and the
| reign ot Troy was on.
But history has a strrnae way
jof reverting back. Stanford, once
again in this modern day of 1949.
j has mustered enough power to
threaten the Trojans.
Trojans Uncanny in Clutch
But one must be cautious in deal
j ing with the mechanical men from
I Troy. Bitter experiences in the past
I show that Cromwellian Culture has

no knowledge of the word defeat.
These primitive Figueroa foot
specialists, manufactured in a fancy
speed factory at Bovard Field, get
uncanny in the clutch, issue forth a
fienaish cry of "Fight on." and then
proceed to wolfishly devour any
lambs who wander too far off the
beaten path.
Once in 1940 this type of thing
occurred. Stanford had built itself
another strong track empire and ap
peared ready to overthrow SC. And
that 1940 outfit was probably good
enough to deserve the title of being
Stanford's greatest track squad.
Daily sports scribes in those days
went whole - hog. They cheered
through early season Card landslide
wins, and then picked the Indians
to bash the Trojans, (59-1)2.
Iroy Does It A sain
Men such as miler Paul Moore,
sprinter Clyde Jeffrey, and weight
man Stan Anderson would turn the
trick, they said.
But when the dust had cleared,
the mechanical men from Trojan
town had gobbled up all the ques
tionable places to win the meet, 71
to 58.
Stanford gained a little revenge
that year by nosing Troy in the
Fresno Relays, but the fact re
mained that USC was king of the
Dual Meet contestants, and that the
Trojans were very much opposed to
giving up the honor. They still are.
However, in 1949, the year of the

Once upon a time in A.D.
1933, a bunch of Indians who
were tired of being down
trodden by their Trojan op
pressors, rose up and did a
strange and miraculous thing.
Those Indians, 1933 miracle vin
tage. put together enough bows and
arrows to whip the mechanical
monsters from the Southern King
: dom. G7-63, in a contest called a
i track meet.
But the joy of victory was not
: long in existence.
In that very same year, Cromwell
| the Great lashed his Trojan horde
; into a wild frenzy, and the thick
| sku'led but fast-footed barbarians
slapped the Tribe right back into
j servitude and bondage. 72-59.
Stanford King Till 192G
Since that date, King Troy, wear
| ing a twisted smile and a cashmere
i sweater, has been a merciless slave
; driver, and in the annual contest
j between master and slave he has
clear'y proven his superiority.
Yet what few historians realize is
that Stanford, once a glorious and
powerful tribe in its own right, de
feated the Trojans the first 22 times
they met, a record which still stands
as the longest win streak of the In
dian-Trojan wars.
Stanford also holds an edge in
j total victories, having won 2(3 meets
| to USC's 17. Those statistics, how
j ever, were established long !>efore
j the era of the paycheck and the free
I ride.
Finally, in 192G, the Indians were
j conquered for the first time, and the
| reign ot Troy was on.
But history has a strrnae way
jof reverting back. Stanford, once
again in this modern day of 1949.
j has mustered enough power to
threaten the Trojans.
Trojans Uncanny in Clutch
But one must be cautious in deal
j ing with the mechanical men from
I Troy. Bitter experiences in the past
I show that Cromwellian Culture has

no knowledge of the word defeat.
These primitive Figueroa foot
specialists, manufactured in a fancy
speed factory at Bovard Field, get
uncanny in the clutch, issue forth a
fienaish cry of "Fight on." and then
proceed to wolfishly devour any
lambs who wander too far off the
beaten path.
Once in 1940 this type of thing
occurred. Stanford had built itself
another strong track empire and ap
peared ready to overthrow SC. And
that 1940 outfit was probably good
enough to deserve the title of being
Stanford's greatest track squad.
Daily sports scribes in those days
went whole - hog. They cheered
through early season Card landslide
wins, and then picked the Indians
to bash the Trojans, (59-1)2.
Iroy Does It A sain
Men such as miler Paul Moore,
sprinter Clyde Jeffrey, and weight
man Stan Anderson would turn the
trick, they said.
But when the dust had cleared,
the mechanical men from Trojan
town had gobbled up all the ques
tionable places to win the meet, 71
to 58.
Stanford gained a little revenge
that year by nosing Troy in the
Fresno Relays, but the fact re
mained that USC was king of the
Dual Meet contestants, and that the
Trojans were very much opposed to
giving up the honor. They still are.
However, in 1949, the year of the
golden gams of Gay Bryan, a new
story may be unfolding.
The mechanical men have be
come a little rusty, and it's tirr*»
they were taken apart and put back
together again.
So ro:l out that great big Tro'an
horse: the sawdust pits need filling.
