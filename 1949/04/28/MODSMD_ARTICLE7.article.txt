# Dahle Misses No-Hitter on Last Out As Card Nine Mauls Hapless Moragans 8-0
## 
### JOHN HALL Daily Sports Editor 
Lefty Dave Dahle came within one out of a no-hit
! game yesterday as Stanford pounded out an 8 to C
! CIBA win over St. Mary's on the Sunken Diamond
Dahle was robbed of a perfect game when, with
! two down in the ninth on strikeouts, Gael Bill Dennehc
j singled sharply to left to mar the slate.
The small crowd at the Sunken Diamond was awec
! into absolute silence as Dahle took the mound for
j the ninth inning.
He struck out the first batter on four pitches. Ther
I Don Benjamin, pinch hitting for the pitcher, grounded
sharply between second and first, but Ray Winter
i halter got to it only to bobble the ball for an error.
Dahle went back to work and struck out the nex*.
| batter. But then, with a no-hitter in his hip pocket,
' Dennehe stepped in with his hit to left. The blow
■ went for naught when Dahle retired the side and
! ended the game with his third strikeout of the inning.
His one-hitter was the best job turned in by a CIBA
chucker this season, and it also marked the first time
i a Stanford hurler has gone the distance sincc Dahle
j himself last turned the trick in 12 to 3 victory against
California over a month ago.
Dahle had the game in complete control at all times,
and had the Gaels eating out of his hand as he whiffed
13 and allowed only one man to reach second base.
Another Dave, shortstop Melton, collected three
| bingles in four times at bat to lead the Cards' 10-hit
barrage.
It was Melton's single in the fourth inning that
i started the Cards on their way.
St. Mary's hurler. Jack Rial, hadn't been touched
for three innings, hut a walk to Charley Cole, and
j Melton s safety, followed by Dick Clegg's long triple.
I racked up two runs in the fourth.
The Indians followed up with three runs apiece in
the sixth and seventh cantos to ice the contest.
Dave Dahle was quickly surrounded by his team
mates after he struck out the final opposing batsman
The left-handed fast-ball specialist also came close

►to a no-hitter last season when he
set UCLA down with a single blow
But that game was ruined as early
as the fouith inning when Moose
Meyers scratched out an infield hit
Yesterday's win moved the Cards
back into the .500 bracket in the
loop standings with a league record
of 4 and 4. They meet UCLA next
Saturday in the Sunken Diamond
for their ninth CIBA game.

Dahle had the game in complete control at all times,

I racked up two runs in the fourth.
