### 
There's going to be an
"atomic" explosion in the Union
Court tonight. The time is 7:30
â€”the reason is the SC track and
UCLA baseball rally.
The Stanford track team has
hungered for 1G years for a victory
over the men from Troy, and to- !
night's rally is on the eve of the
dual meet that may end the famine, j
On hand to set oft the "explosion"
will be "Dink"' Templeton, nationally
known track coach, who will give
his authoritative, last-minute prog- '
nostications on the outcome of the j
meet. Templeton, who coached the j
Farm's cinder squads for 15) years, |
is now head coach at the San Fran- i
cisco Olympic Club and a leading
sports analyst.
Sharing the spotlight with the
tracksters at tonight's rally will be i
Harry Wolter and his Stanford base
ball team, who take on the UCLA
Bruins on the Sunken Diamond to- j
morow. Wolter, who is retiring this |
year after more than 20 years as '
the Indians' head coach, will be i
one of the honored guests at the
rally.
