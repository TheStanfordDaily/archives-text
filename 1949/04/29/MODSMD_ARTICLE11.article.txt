# Women Catch 'Carillionneur' High in Tower
## 
### 
Twenty-four women meeting on
the 12th floor of Hoover Tower at
11:45 Monday night to pick Cap and
Gown candidates added a new slant
to the story of the student "caril
lonneur." He was apprehended by
police after trying his talents on
the bells.
Earlier, the police and a night
watchman were given credit for the
japture, but the victim said he was
trapped by the women. Police Chief
Gordy Davis had said he under
stood that it was a "special group"
that was in the tower.
The student was turned over to
the police on the 12th floor. Cap
and Gown members meet in the
Libe's tower each year to carry out
a tradition.
Monday night was the student's
third "concert" on the bells. He en
tered the keyboard room by break
ing the hasp on the door and left an
apologetic note and 45 cents to re
pair the damage when he left. His
method of entrance into the "bur
glar - proof" library has been de
scribed to the police, the student
said.
While the police were questioning
the student, a burglar escaped cap
ture at the Phi Delta Theta house
alter being spotted by members of
the fraternity.
