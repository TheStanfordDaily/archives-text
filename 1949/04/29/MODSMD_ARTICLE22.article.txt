The idea for these conferences
was conceived by the present
Church Committee as a "means for
getting' a representative gallery of
Stanford students to discuss the kind
of religious program they want, and
to make suggestions as to the best
method of carrying out their
wishes," according to Associate
Chaplain Robert M. Minto.
The Church Committee felt that it
has not represented the students
adequately in the field of campus
religious activity and decided to
sponsor these two Saturday morning
conferences, the first to be held to
morrow and the second on May 14.

the Chaplains' Conference.
The final item will be the election
cf a nominating' committee which
will present a slate for members ol
a Council of Religious Activities, to
be voted on at the second confer
ence meeting. Some delegates have
suggested the possibility of forming
a Stanford Religious Association for
which the Council of Religious Ac
tivities will be an Executive Com
mittee.

should contact the Chaplain's or the
Church Office before the meetings.
