# Debaters Defeat U. of Georgetown
## 
### 
Stanford's team of touring de
baters, Ronald Klein and Skip
Athearn, added Georgetown Uni
versity to their list of victims
Wednesday night in a debate held
at Mount Vernon College for
Women. The topic debated was fed
eral aid to education.
Stanford debate coach, James G.
Emerson, was particularly pleased
with this latest victory. The audi
ence decision went to Stanford by
a margin of more than 2 to 1, de
spite the fact the Stanford team up
held the affirmative on the subject.
The audience was made up mostly
of Southerners, who are opposed to
federal aid to education in principle.
The Georgetown University team
had recently returned from a suc
cessful tour of the South debating
oh the same subject.
Participating in the West Point
national debate tournament as a
judge was Miller McClintock, for
mer Stanford debate coach. By the
rules of the West Point tournament,
Coach Emerson could not serve as
a judge of debates in which his men
were taking part. Emerson invited
McClintock to represent him there
as a judge.
