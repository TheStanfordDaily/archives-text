## Amendment Proposed 
### 
To the Editor:
The new Constitution has been adopted, and on the whole it is an ex
cellent document. Since it was impossible for the students to disapprove
of only one section of the Constitution at the election, any concerted attack
on one provision could have defeated the entire Constitution. But now
it is possible to subject portions of the new Constitution to close scrutiny
without endangering the entire charter.
The narrow margin by which the Constitution was ratified indicated
that there was much opposition to portions of it. Much of this hostility
was directed against the proposal for selecting Executive Committee rep
resentatives. Many people signed a petition requesting a vote on this
section alone. A group of students including some members of Excom
met yesterday afternoon to draft a substitute system. It was not entirely
agreeable to anyone, but that seems to me to be a recommendation of
its fairness.
The system provided gives women four out of 14 representatives, which
is close to their numerical proportion of the total student body; it gives
off-campus students, including the Village, six of the 14â€”another close
approximation ol the percentage of this body. It gives the freshman class
dorms a total of two representatives, which is desirable from the average
number of the people in those areas.
But most important it provides that people can vote for candidates with
whom they are more likely to be acquainted, and who can be easily con
tacted and held responsible for their votes. This should help to obtain
better representatives and insure that all those elected will have close
contact with student opinion.
We hope that the proposed change, when sufficient signatures have been
obtained, will provide the student body with an opportunity to express
its opinion on this specific provision.
