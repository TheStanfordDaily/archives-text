Do you want your movies?
This quarter, so far, the Sunday Movies have run oil fairly smoothly.
The audience has seemed to approve of the pictures, but the best are
the "Things To Come," "Drums," "Four Feathers," and an Eddie Cantor
picture. These pictures, along with the cartoon "Crimson Ghost" and
some<color cartoons, should be worth seeing — if they are shown.
In the past few weeks the audiences have shown good spirit. The cheer
ing section is coming along fine, but could use more backing. That horn
has been chiming in at the right time (thanks, Al) along with a few
spicy remarks, and has added to the whole performance.
That is the spirit ol the thing! But tricks like throwing firecrackers
which might put someone's eye out. and carrying water guns with which
you bathe the people below the balcony are unnecessary.
Not only are these things injurious to others, but most people have
already had their showers for the day. We will continue to show Sunday
Movies as long as the conduct is not destructive of or threatens the prop
erty of others. So, toot your horns, ring your bells, and yell like hell,
but save the water for the squirts, please!
