A touch of Fitch's, a bit of Prell, mix together and, well ....

the bugs.

Phi Delts, Phi Psis, and Phi Sigs — soap.
Fijis — Prell, castile, and Fitch's. Alpha Sigs — Prell. AKL — liquid,
three creams, and a soap.
Phi Kaps — "Whatever my roommate uses. About seven or eight use
cream, and only one uses liquid."
Alpha Delt — Cream and liquid.

you use?" "Palmolive."
Betas — Wildroot, soap.
Theta Chis and Theta Delts — liquid.
Theta Xis — cream.
Delta Chi — liquid, Drene, Prell, Fitch. "We like any kind up here."
Dekes — "I use Halo. My hair is very wavy and I find it does so much
for it, if you'll pardon the expression."

Sigma Nu — cream and Lipton's.
Chi Psi — liquid, Prell, soap.
Sigma Chi — "Is this Sue Inskeep?"
