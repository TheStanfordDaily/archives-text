The Austrian people are now a
pood deal more sympathetic to the
Western occupation than they were
several months ago. They under
stand what the points of disagree
ment are between the Western
Powers and the USSR, and they
realize that they have much at
stake in the outcome of the wrang
ling.
The two points that most directly
affect that nation are these:
First, the problem of German
property. A sizeable part of the in
vestments in the Austrian industries
since 1938 have been German. The
Russians want control of her steel,
oil, and Danube shipping industries,
their demands being made under the
guise of reparation. To take these
out of Austrian hands would be to
set the country back economically
for an indefinite time.
Since Versailles, Austria has been
almost totally dependent on her in
dustries for existence. When the
dual monarchy was split and the
pieces east to the winds, she was de
prived of the larger part of her agri
cultural hinterland.
With the Communist control of
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Po
land. the situation has become far
worse, as those countries drive a
hard bargain in trading food for in
dustrial products.
Second, the Austrians arc quite
in sympathy with the Western re
sistance of Communist proselyting.
They have always considered them
selves Westerners, from an ethnic
standpoint, and now from an in
creasingly important religious one.
They have long regarded the Slavs
as Easterners, and the wholesale
conversion of that race to Commu
nism has increased the tension. Also,
overwhelmingly Catholic Austria
can have little patience with Marxist
philosophy. Proof of this is seen in
the fact that there are but two Com
munists in the present Nationalist
(parliament).
Although Austria is somewhat in
the same position as Finland, in thai
she has to be most careful about
her international dealings, it is felt
that she should take a definite stand,
a privilege denied to that northern
state. The very fact of the Atlantic
Pact indicates to her that this would
be approved by the West.
The biggest hope of Austria is that
America will continue to back her.
They know that reluctance might
lead to another Czechoslovakia.

almost totally dependent on her in
dustries for existence. When the
dual monarchy was split and the
pieces east to the winds, she was de
prived of the larger part of her agri
cultural hinterland.
With the Communist control of
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Po
land. the situation has become far
worse, as those countries drive a
hard bargain in trading food for in
dustrial products.
Second, the Austrians arc quite
in sympathy with the Western re
sistance of Communist proselyting.
They have always considered them
selves Westerners, from an ethnic
standpoint, and now from an in
creasingly important religious one.
They have long regarded the Slavs
as Easterners, and the wholesale
conversion of that race to Commu
nism has increased the tension. Also,
overwhelmingly Catholic Austria
can have little patience with Marxist
philosophy. Proof of this is seen in
the fact that there are but two Com
munists in the present Nationalist
(parliament).
Although Austria is somewhat in
the same position as Finland, in thai
she has to be most careful about
her international dealings, it is felt
that she should take a definite stand,
a privilege denied to that northern
state. The very fact of the Atlantic
Pact indicates to her that this would
be approved by the West.
The biggest hope of Austria is that
America will continue to back her.
They know that reluctance might
lead to another Czechoslovakia.
