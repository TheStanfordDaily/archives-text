# Chaplain's Chat
## 
### ROBERT M. MINTO 
Tomorrow the confcrence on re
ligion here will get under way for
its first session in Cubberley Ilall.
A widely representative group of
students will meet to consider the
type of student religious activity
they would like to see here.
Out of their discussions should
come much helpful material for stu
dent religious organizations to work
on. Mark Hatfield will act as the
chairman of the conference, and
members of the Church Committee
and the Interfnith Committee have
made preparations that ought to
ensure an interesting and useful
session.
The second session of the confer
ence will be held two weeks later
on May 14.
Dr. Johnston will return for to
morrow's meeting from the Univer
sity of Michigan where he has been
attending the annual conference of
university and college chaplains.
From his contacts there, he will
bring information .on religious pro
grams on other campuses which
again will be valuable for these dis
cussions. This chaplains' association
is something' new. its first meeting
being held last year at Yale.
It represents a new concern on the
part of those interested with reli
gion in higher education to do more

! effective work and to share infor
mation and experience from differ
: ent colleges and universities.
This development also reflects a
! new interest in understanding the
relation of religion and learning, an
interest which has been raised in
; the universities in this country and
elsewhere.
Beginning in Europe immediately
following the war. this movement
has brought together faculty and
students in study find discussion of
the nature of the university from
the Christian point of view.
Much of the inspiration of these
' studies has come through the
World Student Christian Federa
| tion, an international religious or
ganization with which Stanford Avill
have some contact this Sunday when
i one of its secretaries, Dr. T. Z. Koo
; will preach in the Memorial Church.
Dr. Koo is an outstanding Chinese
Christian leader who has been for
the past 14 years engaged in this
world-wide student work. He not
only will preach on Sunday morning,
but also at a special vesper service
on Sunday night.
At 4 p.m. he will meet with a
student seminar in the vestry when
he will discuss the work of World
Student Christian Federation.
