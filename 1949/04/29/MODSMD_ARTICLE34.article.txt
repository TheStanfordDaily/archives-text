# Gov. Earl Warren May Win in 50; State Democratic Forces Jockeying
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Both of our major political par
tics face a quandary in California—
whom will they run for Governor
in 1950?
The governorship of California
in 1950 conceivably can be a beauti
ful catapult into the White House
in 1952.
The Democrats are already wit
nessing a back-of-the-scenes jot-k
eying of various forces and person
alities tor control of the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination — James
Roosevelt, Oliver J. Carter, George
Kill ion; and others for the Senate
race.
The Republicans, however, worry
about a slightly different puzzle.
Earl Warren will run again. lie
likes the job; he may try for the
presidency in '52. If he loses the
governorship race in '50, his politi
cal career might be deemed passe.
So, Warren feels he MUST run and
win in "50.
Some of the more conservative
Republicans cannot stomach War
ren ordinarily, because, though he
calls himself "Republican," he often
legislates too far to the left to suit
California's more staid GOPers. He
and they in the legislature have
clashed too often for comfort.
The younger and more liberal

Republicans along with Warren,
on the whole, though they are in the
minority.
Though the conservative majority
of the Golden State's Republicans
might wish to clitch Warren in

they know they cannot. Why? Be
cause they might, not be able to win
with anyone else. After all. Califor
nia's major voting population is
registered Democratic; the influx of
out-of-staters is also predominantly
Democratic.
Warren is liberal enough to catch
the support of the "leftish Republi
cans.' the conservative Democrats
if Roosevelt runs, many of the inde
pendents, and—since Warren would
sti'l be the more conservative of the
two if James Roosevelt opposed him
in 50 — the staid GOP majority
would of course prefer Earl Warren.
Thus, by grace of his appeal to
the wide central current of political
votes and California's cross - filing
system. Warren is assured of an ex
cellent chance of being re-elected
in 1950.
Some Democrats in this state
realize the probabilities and that is
why some gubernatorial aspirants
may bide their time for a later elec
tion after Warren has left the field.
These hopefuls may accept lesser
party roles for the attendant pub
licity and let Carter or Roosevelt
take the kiss (if death by opposing
Warren. However, neither of the
Democratic hopefuls is smart
enough to either win or uive War
ren a very rough time of it.


GOV. EARL WARREN probably
will run again in 1050 and Ihen
fry for the Presidency in 1052,
writer savs.
