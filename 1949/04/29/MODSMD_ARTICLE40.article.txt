# Yearling Thinclads Favored Over SJS
## 
### 
Out to polish up their style for j
the big clash with the Cal frosh, j
Stanford's first - year cindermen I
meet the yearling aggregation from j
San Jose State today. The teams are
scheduled to meet on Angell Field
at 3:30 p.m.
The frosh should have no trouble i

with the San Jose team except in
| cne sprints. Eisenberg and Buckston
! of San Jose can click off the century
I well under :10.0, ar.o* do the 220 in
less than :21.5. Unless the wind
slows down these lighter boys, tne
heavier Wilbur Taylor of the frosh
i will have his work cut out for him.
