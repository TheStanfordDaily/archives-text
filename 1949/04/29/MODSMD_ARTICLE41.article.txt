# Indians Seek End To Trojan Reign
## Relaymen Anchor Strong Card Tracksters in Tossup Troy Meet 
### JOHN HALL 
History is in the making tomorrow when two of the nation's
greatest track sguads square off in a do-or-die dual meet battle
that is expected to came right down to the final event on the
program before a victor is crowned.
Stanford, determined to jump Troy for the first time since 1933,

"and Southern California, long the
champion in world einder circles,
will match swift and heft in a bat
tle which promises to outshine ail
previous contests between the two
foes.
And toss-up is the word for it.
All the experts agree that it will
be a wide-open free-for-all with
each team fighting desperately for
that 66th point.
Both squads have a few sure
points—USC with Mel Patton in the
sprints, a fancy 880 trio, and high
flying pole-vaulters, while the Tribe
rates healthy edges in the javelin.
| shot, and broad jump — but from
there, there things get mixed up but
good.
Those who know, namely Jack
Weiershauser and Jess Hill, say that
the meet will be decided by the re
lay-
If such a thing happens, and all
odds point to it, then Stanford is
ready to produce its best effort of
the season.
Anchored by undefeated Larry
Hoff, the relay team will also con
sist of Cass Bly, Pilch Johnson, and
Rupe Andrews. Those four gentle
men will probably find that the
i whole meet has been dumped right
i in their laps.
And against Troy, who has turned
in a 3:17-flat compared to Stanford's
3:17.4, the Card baton-luggers will
have to hurry. To get to that tape
first, this is how they will try it:
(1) Pitch Johnson leads off with
a 48.3.
(2) Rupe Andrews turns in a
18.7.
(3) ('ass Bly follows with a
18.4.
(4) I.arrv HofT finishes in 47,51.
HofT will probably be dueling with
Bob Chambers, and will have to go
all out to top off a predicted 3:13.3
1 effort.
That should be good for the 66th
point, and the meet, and a nice big
smile in Coach Jack's now-worried
countenance.
