### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Pie-Troy track fever has been
mounting on the campus at a dizzy
pace all week; kut the lads who'll
he making the all-out effort to de
throne King Trojan in the Stadium
Saturday remain cool and confident
on the eve of the big meet.
Confident but not cocky. From
Coach Jack on down, the boys all
express the same opinion—we can
win this one, but it's going to be
mighty, mighty close.
Iron-man Gay Bryan, whose mus
culnr frame will be squarely in the
spotlight at the Saturday show, key
noted the team's comments.
"This much I'm sure of: there
won't be anyone leaving the Stadium
before the final relay event. That
should be the clincher, the way it
•stacks up now."
Otis Chandler, the Blond Bomb
jr who is slated to win the shot put
Saturday by a large margin, echoed
he sentiments of teammate Gay.
'We might win it sooner, but most
likely the relay will decide it."
Ace distance man A 1 Lyons
lodded in agreement, adding the
opinion that "we've been pointing
or this one for a long time, and
.ve'ie not going to let down now."
Lyons and Jose Rael will carry
he Stanford hopes in the distance
uns, which are key events in the
ndians' Troy-tumbling aspirations.
Tose, who has been right behind A 1
m the track all year, seconded
_yons again this time.
"This could be the meet Stanford
las keen waiting for since 1933. But
n any event, there won't be a win
der until the last race has been run."
Number one of the Cards' potent
me-two punch in the quarter, Larry
ioff, had this to say concerning
rhambers: "I hope he runs in the
140. Pitch Johnson and I could con
•eivably both beat him in the quar
er; and he wouldn't be in top shape
or the half."
Hoft', too, thought the meet would
je decided by the relay.
Hurdler Downing McKee sounded
more optimistic note than his
xtra-cautious mates.
"All the campus dopesters have
jeen predicting a one or two-point
ictory for us. The victory part is
.11 right; but I think we'll take it
:y a wider margin than the dope
ters have figured."


AL LYONS
. . . no letdovni now."

Pie-Troy track fever has been
mounting on the campus at a dizzy
pace all week; kut the lads who'll
he making the all-out effort to de
throne King Trojan in the Stadium
Saturday remain cool and confident
on the eve of the big meet.
Confident but not cocky. From
Coach Jack on down, the boys all
express the same opinion—we can
win this one, but it's going to be
mighty, mighty close.
Iron-man Gay Bryan, whose mus
culnr frame will be squarely in the
spotlight at the Saturday show, key
noted the team's comments.
"This much I'm sure of: there
won't be anyone leaving the Stadium
before the final relay event. That
should be the clincher, the way it
•stacks up now."
Otis Chandler, the Blond Bomb
jr who is slated to win the shot put
Saturday by a large margin, echoed
he sentiments of teammate Gay.
'We might win it sooner, but most
likely the relay will decide it."
Ace distance man A 1 Lyons
lodded in agreement, adding the
opinion that "we've been pointing
or this one for a long time, and
.ve'ie not going to let down now."
Lyons and Jose Rael will carry
he Stanford hopes in the distance
uns, which are key events in the
ndians' Troy-tumbling aspirations.
Tose, who has been right behind A 1
m the track all year, seconded
_yons again this time.
"This could be the meet Stanford
las keen waiting for since 1933. But
n any event, there won't be a win
der until the last race has been run."
Number one of the Cards' potent
me-two punch in the quarter, Larry
ioff, had this to say concerning
rhambers: "I hope he runs in the
140. Pitch Johnson and I could con
•eivably both beat him in the quar
er; and he wouldn't be in top shape
or the half."
Hoft', too, thought the meet would
je decided by the relay.
Hurdler Downing McKee sounded
more optimistic note than his
xtra-cautious mates.
"All the campus dopesters have
jeen predicting a one or two-point
ictory for us. The victory part is
.11 right; but I think we'll take it
:y a wider margin than the dope
ters have figured."
