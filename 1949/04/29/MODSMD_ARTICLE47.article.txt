# Woltermen Seek Revenge Against Burly Westwood Nine Tomorrow

### 
Harry Wolter's baseball men will
; be alter their filth CIBA win to-
I morrow when they hook up with
UCLA's Bruins on the Sunken Dia
mond at 3:15.
Taking a back seat to the bit*
USC - Stanford track festival, the
horsehiders will nevertheless have
I at it in the best of tradition imme
! diately following the meet.
Dave Stott, Stanford's easy-going
i number two flinger, will probably

Baseball Coach Harry Wolter
will be honored tonight at the
olnt rally to be held in Union
Court for the track and baseball
squads. Rally starting time is set
for 7:30 p.m.

I get the opening call against the |
| Bruins, although Frank La√ürum
might be a last-minute choice.
Neither hurler has gone the dis
i tance this season, although Stott
j was credited with a win over Santa
| Clara.
The Bruins, who left Los Angeles j
| last night on the Lark, will invade
Washington Park in San Jose to- i
night for an important clash with j
the Santa Clara Bronocs.
Figuring that the Bronco game I
should sap some Bruin strength as
; well as use up Lefty Bob Andrews, I
1 Stanford picks up a slight advan- '

tage for tomorrow's struggle.
Left-handers have been poison to
the Cards all season, and Andrews'
absence tomorrow won't be minded
at all.
However, athletic George Stanich,
a pretty fair country chucker in his
own right, will carry the Bruin
banner. Stanich is just now round
ing into top shape, and should be
ready to do a lot of damage.
Boasting a two-game advantage
over Stanford, the Bruins will be
looking for a clean sweep of the
series, their first two wins occurring
in Los Angeles during the first
week of the season.
Since that time, Stanford has
come a long way. especially in the

warclub department.
Tomorrow the Indians will be out
to prove that they still rate a chance
in the loop chase.
II they biff the Westwooders,
things will be looking rosy, and the
Cards will be sitting pretty with a
5-4 league record.
it they drop the duel, hopes will
be sinking faster than Lake Lagu
nita.
Most dope ters say that the win
ning CIBA team this season will
drop as many as five games, but
that gives Stanford little leeway, as
the Tribe has already blown two to
UCLA and lost singles to USC and
California.
