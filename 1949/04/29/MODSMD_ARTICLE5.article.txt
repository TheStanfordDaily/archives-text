Plans for a constitutional amend
j ment to change the area-class repre
| scntation system were drawn up
| yesterday in answer to a petition
j signed by 845 students calling for a
separate vote on Section 111 of the
new ASSU Constitution.
Four Excom members met with
, six other students yesterday to dis-
I cuss possible alternatives to the new
representation. The petition showed

! ions on the Excom membership sec
j tion as separate from the rest of the
\ Constitution.
If the current petition seeking a change in the Excom repre

Plans for a constitutional amend
j ment to change the area-class repre
| scntation system were drawn up
| yesterday in answer to a petition
j signed by 845 students calling for a
separate vote on Section 111 of the
new ASSU Constitution.
Four Excom members met with
, six other students yesterday to dis-
I cuss possible alternatives to the new
representation. The petition showed
that many wished to express opin
! ions on the Excom membership sec
j tion as separate from the rest of the
\ Constitution.
If the current petition seeking a change in the Excom repre
sentation clauses of the new ASSU Constitution is submitted to
Excom by the first of next week, and approved by that body, the
offices will probably be withdrawn from the scheduled spring
election.
The petition provides for two off-campus representatives and

one graduate member elected at'
large. The text is as follows:
ART. 111. SECT. :i—MEMBERSHIP

Vice-President, the Executive Com
mitter shall be composed of the fol
lowing members:
