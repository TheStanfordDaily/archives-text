# Petition Hits Representation
## 
### 
Plans for a constitutional amend
j ment to change the area-class repre
| scntation system were drawn up
| yesterday in answer to a petition
j signed by 845 students calling for a
separate vote on Section 111 of the
new ASSU Constitution.
Four Excom members met with
, six other students yesterday to dis-
I cuss possible alternatives to the new
representation. The petition showed
that many wished to express opin
! ions on the Excom membership sec
j tion as separate from the rest of the
\ Constitution.
