awaited dual meet to be held tomorrow afternoon in spacious
Stanford Stadium. The field events are slated to start at 1:30 p.m..
and the mile will begin promptly at 2.
People from near and far will trek to the SO,OOO-seat stadium

-o watch one of the greatest track
duals in recent years.
Coach Jack Weiershauser of the
Indians and Coach Jesse Hil! of the
Trojans, both former great com
petitors for their respective schools,
will be ready to unleash their track
forces to the fullest extent for th
cinder crucial.

Troy. Both Patton and Bob Cham
bers, USC middle distance runner
represented the United States at thi
Olympic games last year.
Cards Have 'Greats*
Tor Stanford the list is just
great. Captain Gay Bryan of the
Indians will be ably supported b>
champions Bud Held, Otis Chan-

dler, Larry Hoff. A 1 Lyons, and
many others. Both Held and Chan
dler hold the best outdoor marks in
the United States this year, in the
iavelin and shot put respective!}
The competition should be terrific
in almost every event.
In many ways, the contest will
be a '"batt'e of the coaches," since
they alone will decide which man
will run in what race in order to
get the most possible points.
IVack enthusiasts all over the
country have been trying to "dope
out" the all-important meet. From,
here, it looks like a toss-up, with
the relay > probably deciding the
outcome of the great contest.
Bryan in Big Test
This meet will be the supreme
test lor Stanford's versatile, five
event man, Gay Bryan. Just how
much Bryan can stand under great
pressure, is the question everyone
is asking.
Only one event, the broad jump.
i seems a cinch for Bryan to win. In
the sprints, he must not only battle
USC's Mel Patton and George Pas
i quali, but the ever-present Stadium
I wind.
In the low hurdles, probably his
toughest event of the day, Bryan
must run against Ronnie Frazier
and Ai .Lawrence, tv/o tough cin
j dermen in the low barriers, both of
| whom will be fairly fresh.
In the high jump, Bryan must en
' counter Troy's Jack Barnes, who
leaped 6 ft. (> in. as a frosh last year.
All in al! it will be a mighty stren
' uous afternoon for the Stanford
captain.
To keep Stanford in the running,
| best efforts from every member of
i the team must be given. Al Lyons,
sturdy distance runner, will receive
I his stiffest strength test of the year
,in the mile and two-mile. Lyons
hopes to add 10 important points to
| the Card cause.
Veterans Larry HofF and Pitch
j lohnson will be ready for all chal
i lengers in the quarter-mile. South
i ern California's Norm Stocks, Wells
j DeLoach, and maybe Bob Chambers
j will give the Card duo plenty of
competition in the 440 event, and
! it could develop into the best race
! oi the day.
1 Other crucial events include the
discus (Chandler and McKee vs.
Bayless), the high hurdles (McKee.
Russell and Kent vs. Attlesy and
j Lawrence), the two - mile (Lyons
| and Rael vs. Cherry and Mitchell)
j and, of Course, the deciding relay.

I wind.
In the low hurdles, probably his
toughest event of the day, Bryan
must run against Ronnie Frazier
and Ai .Lawrence, tv/o tough cin
j dermen in the low barriers, both of

In the high jump, Bryan must en
' counter Troy's Jack Barnes, who
leaped 6 ft. (> in. as a frosh last year.
All in al! it will be a mighty stren
' uous afternoon for the Stanford
captain.
To keep Stanford in the running,

I his stiffest strength test of the year
,in the mile and two-mile. Lyons
hopes to add 10 important points to
| the Card cause.
Veterans Larry HofF and Pitch
j lohnson will be ready for all chal
i lengers in the quarter-mile. South

Cards Have 'Greats*
Tor Stanford the list is just
great. Captain Gay Bryan of the

champions Bud Held, Otis Chan-

dler, Larry Hoff. A 1 Lyons, and
many others. Both Held and Chan
dler hold the best outdoor marks in

be a '"batt'e of the coaches," since
they alone will decide which man
will run in what race in order to
get the most possible points.
IVack enthusiasts all over the
