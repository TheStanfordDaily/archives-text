# Same Old Story-â€”SC Still King
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Despite a tremendous 18-point
effort by Captain Gay Bryan,
the Stanford Varsity tracksters
bowed to an all-powerful USC
squad, 721.6 to 58 5 6, before
over 12,000 people in Stanford
Stadium last Saturday.
Defeat came to the Indians by the
narrowest of margins in certain key
races. Alter Troy's Bob Pruitt had
forced Stanford's Al Lyons to run
a 4:18 mile, USC's Bob Chambers
registered the first upset of the day,
when he bested Larry Half by one
foot in the 440 race.
It was the same Chambers who
came from behind in the mile relay
to anchor his team to victory, in
one of the most thrilling races in
Stanford Stadium history.
Heroic in Defeat
However, the Indians were heroic
in defeat. Many Farm athletes reg
istered "best-ever" performances to
keep the Indians in the contest to
the very end.
Steve McKee. in his last season
for the Cards, heaved the discus a
full 151 ft. 2 in. to grab that all
important first place from Bill Bay
less of USC, who threw the platter
149 feet himself.
Don Campbell was another Indian
who almost turned the tide. Camp
bell came through with a totally

unexpected 13-foot 6-inch vault to
t;ive Stanford a surprise 11/3 points
in a three-way tie for second place
in the pole vault.
( Mooers Places in 880
George Mooers, Stanford 880 man,
ran way over his head in the half
mile event, which was supposed to
be a clean sweep for the Trojans.
Mooers just missed second place,
! adding another point to the Stanford
I cause.
Downing McKee came from be
hind in the high hurdles to nip
USC's Dick Attlesy at the tape. Jose
; Rael courageously fought it out in
the two-mile, taking second in the
: good time of 9:44.6.
And, of course. Captain Gay Bryan
performed superbly for the Indian
cause, as he added 18 points to his
team's total.
After being forced to 6 feet 5 inches
in the high jump by Troy's Jack
Barnes, Bryan ran a good second to
Mel Patton in both sprints, took an
ever-so-close second in the low
hurdles, and then won the broad
jump at 24 feet I inch, after the
! rest of the meet was over.
In the all-important low hurdles
race, which was the Cards' last
i chance for victory, Gay Bryan was
literally left at the blocks by a last
] Sun.
The short, sad story is as follows:
Alter recalling the runners in the
low hurdles in a false start. Bryan

decided to shift the position of his
blocks.
While he was doing this, the
starter gave a fast ready, set, go,
and the race was on. Bryan rallied
and gained near the end of the race,
but it wasn't quite enough to catch
the flying Ronnie Frazier, who won
the race by a small foot.
Chandler, Davis Again
Stanford's "cinch" first and second
places came through as expected.
Otis Chandler and Lew Davis again
both hit over 54 feet in the shot put,
and Chandler heaved a respectable
145 foot a 4 inch toss for third place
in the discus.
Bud Held, NCAA champ, easily
won the javelin at 216 feet IOMi
inches, and fouled at over 226 feet.
But the toughie in this event was
Karl Henning's 190-foot
toss on his last throw, that edged
Stanford's Mike Durket for third
place in the javelin event.
Besides Gay Bryan's win the
broad jump, and tie for first in the
high jump, the Indians picked up
another IVj points in these two
events which were totally unex
pected.
Fred Fank forgot about his bad
knee and grabbed third place in
the broad jump, while Dave Dunlap
equalled his best ever in the high
jump tying for third at 6 feet.
Mile Thrilling
The mile, to many people in the
Stadium, was the most thrilling face

of the day. An unexpected entry,
! Bob Pruitt. kept showing' amazing
strength in the mile event, when
he matched Card A 1 Lyons stride
for stride. The sturdy Trojan kej:t
pushing Lyons throughout the raco,
and the Card ace couldn't shake him
j loose.
Then, to the amazement of every
| one, Pruitt passed Lyons on the final
turn of the last lap. But Lyons was
not through. Gathering every last
I ounce of strength, he lunged past
i the speeding Pruitt to beat him by
a yard at the tape.
The time of 4:18 was two seconds
faster than the Card ace had eve
i done before, and it had its effect,
' in the two-mile, in which Lyon.*
placed third.
Lyons, who is undefeated in the
mile this season, will receive a stiff
test next Saturday when he meets
I Cai's ace, Kaare Vefling.
Vefling has been credited with a
| 4:15 mile already this season, as
! well as a spectacular 9:33 two-mile.
The strong Bear distance corpc,
| which swept both the mile and th?
two-mile again USC last weekend,
will give A 1 Lyons and Jose Rae'
I quite a battle in the annual Bi
Meet, held at Edwards Field i
-1 Berkeley this year.
