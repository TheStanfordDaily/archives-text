# NSA Subject Of Student Controversy
## 
### 
Stanford membership in the Na
tional Student Association will be
discussed Wednesday night at Ex
com meeting.
In answer to the question "Should
Stanford continue its membership
in NSA?" Erskine Childers, a re
gional chairman, said that he be
lieves it is essential that Stanford
stay in NSA.
"What Stanford gets out of NSA
is exactly what the student body
as a whole, and the student govern
ment in particular, wish to get out
of it. NSA . . . requires the active
and constant attention of the stu
dent government," Childers stated.
The value of NSA on a campus
can never fully be realized if it is
attempted only by a small student
committee, he added. "It can only
harm Stanford if someone suddenly
has to explain why ASSU has with
drawn from an organization which
is growing and is Increasingly re
spected, and is now the only stu
dent organization in the United
States with membership in the Na
tional Education Association and
the American Council on Educa
tion."
The means to represent student
opinion are present in NSA: it is
up to Stanford to make use of them,
Childers concluded.
Acting NSA Chairman Tom Arm
strong stated, "NSA is the only
non-partisan national medium for
student opinion. If NSA has some
kinks in it, let's iron out the kinks
instead of tossing out NSA."
Mark Hatfield, graduate repre
sentative on Excom, stated, how
ever, that he believes NSA has be
come merely a sounding board for
the personal opinions of its officials
instead of representing student at
titudes.
"Until interest is shown by the
students themselves and a method
to obtain student opinions is found,
belonging to NSA is using student
body money and thus depriving
other worthwhile organizations on
our campus of greater accomplish
ments."
