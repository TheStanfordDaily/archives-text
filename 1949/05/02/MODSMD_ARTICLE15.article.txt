# Committee To Study Religion At Stanford
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Twelve members of a provisional 1
committee, organized to study the '
religious problems peculiar to Stan- !
:ord and to submit equitable recom
.nendations for their solution, were
v'ected at an all-campus religious
conference held at the Rubber ley
Auditorium Saturday morning.
Ine conference was student-con- j
ducted under the general chairman- j
ship of Mark Hatfield. It was at- |
Tended by approximately 90 Stan
ford students who gathered to par- j
ticipate in a discussion of ways and I
means in which they might enrich |
their own religious development j
and bring a concrete religious pro- |
gram to the students of the Uni- 1
versity as a whole.
Council Needed
It was agreed at the meeting that !
a student religious council of some i
type is needed in order that exist- j
facilities might be put lo better j
use. and that a more adequate pro- i
gram be provided.
Chairman Hatfield reiterated this
idea in his keynote address, stating
that the Church Committee and the
Interfaith Council did not feel that
they were representative enough of
the entire student body, whom they
theoretically represented.
The provisional committee, as [
proposed by delegate Janice Hood, j
will plan, promote, and direct stu- j
dent religious activities. An investi- '
gation will also be made of the fea
sibility of establishing a perminent :
Stanford Religious Association in
fall quarter.
Membership of the provisional
committee will be expanded to 30
before the first meeting.
