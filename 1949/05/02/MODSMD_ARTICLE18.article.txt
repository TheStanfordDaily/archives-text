## Buildings Policy

Several stories appear on this page concerning the structural
design of roofs on future Stanford buildings. During the past
eight months alumni and officers within the Alumni Association
have been criticizing the flat-roofed design proposed for several
buildings.
We feel it only fair to present both sides of the issue because
a number of misconceptions have developed over Crothers and
Stern Halls as well as the entire building program.
Contrary to what has been said in alumni letters, the Crothers
reof style was not changed after the hall's construction once
began. Judge Crothers requested the tile roof, and his prefer
ence was adopted by the Board of Trustees in construction plans.
Secondly, the Board of Trustees was given full authority to
decide the location and style of Lucie Stern Hall. Only after
much time in research did the Board decide the style of the new
dorm. They found that the flat-topped hall offered more advan
tages than a tile-roofed structure presented. Construction costs
would be lower, more students could be housed, and the flat
roof design, they decided, best fit general building plans.
On the other hand, would the Board have done better to
spend up to 530,000 more for a tile-roofed dorm housing six or
eight fewer men in order to maintain a consistent architectural
style on campus?
Eight basic variations that seem to blend satisfactorily exist
in Stanford buildings. This does not include 22 other buildings
•unclassified in style. Will the more radical flat-roof designs in
future Farm architecture harmonize with existing styles?
Stanford's Board of Trustees recently adopted the following
resolution concerning future Farm architecture:
"That construction at Stanford shall harmonize as far as possi
ble with the general architectural effect of the original Stanford
buildings, consideration being given to costs, availability of
materials, structural and architectural advances, and the par
ticular purposes to be served."
The policy statement followed a report presented on March 17
to the group by the Committee on Buildings and Grounds of the
Board.
A portion of the report's text follows:
. . . Your committee recognizes the traditional appeal of
the sandstone buildings with the red-tiled roof, and believes that
any future building should, so far as possible, blend and har
monize with the original buildings to form a pleasing whole.
Rigid adherence to the original style, however, is not necessary
to harmony nor will it always produce the most desirable con
struction for educational purposes.
"The basic consideration in a building program must be the
provision of the facilities for carrying on effectively the Uni
versity's functions of education and research.
"A building program should not be inflexible. It must keep
pace with advances in the University's teaching and research,
and with the development of its program of student life and
activities.
Over the years, moreover, building plans of the University
Will inevitably vary with the availability of materials and with
structural and architectural developments. And the history of its
architecture will thus naturally and properly reflect the history
of the community and nation of which it is a part."

roof design, they decided, best fit general building plans.
On the other hand, would the Board have done better to
spend up to 530,000 more for a tile-roofed dorm housing six or
eight fewer men in order to maintain a consistent architectural
style on campus?
Eight basic variations that seem to blend satisfactorily exist
in Stanford buildings. This does not include 22 other buildings
•unclassified in style. Will the more radical flat-roof designs in
future Farm architecture harmonize with existing styles?
Stanford's Board of Trustees recently adopted the following
resolution concerning future Farm architecture:
"That construction at Stanford shall harmonize as far as possi
ble with the general architectural effect of the original Stanford
buildings, consideration being given to costs, availability of
materials, structural and architectural advances, and the par
ticular purposes to be served."
The policy statement followed a report presented on March 17
to the group by the Committee on Buildings and Grounds of the
Board.
A portion of the report's text follows:
. . . Your committee recognizes the traditional appeal of
the sandstone buildings with the red-tiled roof, and believes that
any future building should, so far as possible, blend and har
monize with the original buildings to form a pleasing whole.
Rigid adherence to the original style, however, is not necessary
to harmony nor will it always produce the most desirable con
struction for educational purposes.
"The basic consideration in a building program must be the
provision of the facilities for carrying on effectively the Uni
versity's functions of education and research.
"A building program should not be inflexible. It must keep
pace with advances in the University's teaching and research,
and with the development of its program of student life and
activities.
Over the years, moreover, building plans of the University
Will inevitably vary with the availability of materials and with
structural and architectural developments. And the history of its
architecture will thus naturally and properly reflect the history
of the community and nation of which it is a part."
Several stories appear on this page concerning the structural
design of roofs on future Stanford buildings. During the past
eight months alumni and officers within the Alumni Association
have been criticizing the flat-roofed design proposed for several
buildings.
We feel it only fair to present both sides of the issue because
a number of misconceptions have developed over Crothers and
Stern Halls as well as the entire building program.
Contrary to what has been said in alumni letters, the Crothers
reof style was not changed after the hall's construction once
began. Judge Crothers requested the tile roof, and his prefer
ence was adopted by the Board of Trustees in construction plans.
Secondly, the Board of Trustees was given full authority to
decide the location and style of Lucie Stern Hall. Only after
much time in research did the Board decide the style of the new
dorm. They found that the flat-topped hall offered more advan
tages than a tile-roofed structure presented. Construction costs
would be lower, more students could be housed, and the flat
roof design, they decided, best fit general building plans.
