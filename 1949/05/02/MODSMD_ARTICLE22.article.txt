The 104 buildings now used by the University on the campus represent
eight distinct architectural styles. In addition, there are 22 buildings un
classified or having no architectural style.
The strongest thread connecting the newest building undertaken with
(he earliest one completed is, of course, the human use for which they
both were intended.
The Founding Grant of the University defined one of the principal pur
poses of Stanford University as the qualifying of students for "direct use
fulness in life."
In 1886, Frederick Olmsted, landscape architect, reported to Senator
Stanford his progress. Part of his report stated:
"The physical University must not be ostentatiously costly, and it must
be unobtrusively incidental to a means of a manifestly useful purpose."
That belief, expressed in 1886, is the theory governing the building pro
gram going forward here today.

The 104 buildings now used by the University on the campus represent
eight distinct architectural styles. In addition, there are 22 buildings un
classified or having no architectural style.
The strongest thread connecting the newest building undertaken with
(he earliest one completed is, of course, the human use for which they
both were intended.
The Founding Grant of the University defined one of the principal pur
poses of Stanford University as the qualifying of students for "direct use
fulness in life."
In 1886, Frederick Olmsted, landscape architect, reported to Senator
Stanford his progress. Part of his report stated:
"The physical University must not be ostentatiously costly, and it must
be unobtrusively incidental to a means of a manifestly useful purpose."
That belief, expressed in 1886, is the theory governing the building pro
gram going forward here today.
