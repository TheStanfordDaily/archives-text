# Roof Issue Background
## 
### 
Last May the application of llat
roofed architecture to Stanford was
first unveiled in an Art Gallery ex
hibit, "Stanford Builds." Because
the exhibit did not open until near
the end of the spring quarter, few
students and alumni realized that a
major building (Lucie Stern Hall)
involving a radical departure in
Stanford architecture was contem
plated.
A write-up of the exhibit did not
appear until the July 1948 Alumni
Review was printed. In the mean
time, at its meeting June 17, 1948,
the Board of Trustees let the con
tract for construction of Stern Hall,
following the flat - roofed design,
and ground was broken a few days
later.
During the summer, work was
begun on the linear accelerator lab
oratory building behind abandoned
Sequoia Hall. This also is a flat
roofed building, but because of its
functional nature and remoteness
from other buildings, alumni aimed
their protests at Stern Hall.
"Aunt Lucie" had provided mon
ey for the University to build a
men's dormitory. Design and loca
tion of the new building was left to
the discretion of the Board of Trus
tees.
Paul C. Edwards, president of the
Board of Trustees, wrote to William
S. Kellogg, president of the Alumni
Association, concerning the flat
roofed buildings.
"It is too late to modify plans for
the two buildings now under con
struction, Stern Hall and the linear
accelerator laboratory.
"It may not he possible to
change the design of the projected
Music Listening Building due to
the preference of the donors for
the plans that were submitted to
them.
"But for all future structures it
would, of course, be possible to
adopt some definite basic archi
tectural types more in conform
ity with the original Stanford
buildings," Edwards said.
A January meeting of the Alum
ni Association Executive Board
brought out this opinion, as report
ed in the Alumni Review:
"Modern developments in heat
ing. lighting, functional room ar
rangement, as well as the adminis
tration's wise policy of small living
units grouped around a central
kitchen, can be worked out success
fully without sacrificing the tradi
tional Stanford exterior. Crothers
Hall and Lagunita Court are exam
ples of this combination."
The first formal expression of
student opinion on the architectural
change exemplified by Stern Hall
came in a report from Excom's Un
ion Planning Committee.
"We hope to see it designed
along traditional Stanford lines,
red-tile roofs and all," Chairman
Ted Norton declared.
