Tear off the antiquated red-tile roofs from the pres- '

Flat Roof Style
.... Give us back the trolley that went to Paly.

good time. Let us have the gaslight; the warm flicker
of flame is truly beautiful.
. . If we can afford tiled roofs on our campus,
we are staging a romantic revival that will make
Stanford famous—for everything but progress.
.... the Quadrangle is nothing more than very
mediocre architecture set on an inefficient plan con
trolled by the sloped, tile roofs.
.... Those long arcades that lead to very badly
lit classrooms, spread all over immense areas, don't
add one iota to scholarship. Seventy-five percent of
the .students at Stanford come from schools that have
better working facilities than Stanford has.
.... the original cost of tile, the cost of the struc
ture to hold the additional weight of the tile, and the
maintenance of the roof is higher than for a compo
sition roof.
.... Stern Hall is the first courageous move to
release the Stanford plan from its shackles. It may
be the first academic or dormitory building on the
campus that is architecturally notable.

.... What manner of alumnus is it who calls our
Planning Board fools, and the architect chosen by
them an egotist and a charlatan?
.... Let me point out. without hope of being un
derstood, that contemporary architecture ("modernis
tic is tlie cliche of small minds) is not a fad—not a
style, any more than "Greek" was a style, or "Ro
man" or "Gothic."
.... The Curtis "Condor' was a wonderful air
plane in its day. It was an honest expression of the
materials and techniques available at that time mar
shalled to achieve the function for which the plane
was designed, as that function was understood then.
But no aernonautical engineer today would think of
aping the form of the "Condor." Observe the B-45.
I f has an altogether different form—not because the
"designer's .... egotism led him to see no value in
anything done by others before him," but because the
function itself bar; now changed and because the ma
terials and techniques ol aircraft construction have
been developed anil augmented to a point where new
forms arc mandatory.
In architecture, no less than in aeronautical engi
neering, there has been the same growth and change
both in concept of function and in materials and tech
niques.
.... Can any alumnus be sincrre in wishing to
condemn our University to a second-rate standing by
handicapping it with inadequate and outmoded facil
ities when other universities all around us are bring
ing their facilities up to date by intelligent design in
their expansion programs?
. ... The original Quad was an inflexible and
frozen block for all its charm and beauty. It has stood
quite aloof from the demands of our changing times.
Not the least of the virtues of contemporary archi
tecture is its cognizance of the inevitability of changing
needs and its almost infinite adaptability to this eternal
flux by additions and alterations.
