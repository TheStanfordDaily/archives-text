son.
Stanford s baseball team took another nose-dive Saturday, as
UCLA notched a 7 to 6 CIBA victory on the Sunken Diamond.
It was the first time in history that the Bruins had swept a
three-game series from the Cards, and the loss dropped the
Indians deep into the second division, with a 4-5 season record.

Stanford the ballgame, as the Tribe
batters left 17 men on base, which
adds up to about two men lclt
stranded each inning.
The winners jumped of! to a 3 to
0 lead in the first four innings,
1 knocking starter Jack Heinen out of
| the box.
Heinen was succeeded by Jim
I Claypool, who in turn gave way to
Lelty Dave Dahle in the ninth.
Claypool served up a homerun
pitch to Gene Moody, who lined the
ball directly over the 355-foot
marker on the right field barrier,

the only other one being hit by
Kenny Washington, also of UCLA, in
1937.
George Stanich was the winning
pitcher, but the Olympic star had to
be relieved in the seventh when his
control left him.
Leading Stanford's 12-hit attack
were Charlie Cole, Dick Clegg, and
Ray Winterhaltcr. Ray picked up a
trio of singles, while Cole and Clegg
hit safely twice.
Singles by Dave Dahle, Wintei -
halter, and Cole produced two runs
in the ninth, but the Stanford rally
fell one short of tying the game.
