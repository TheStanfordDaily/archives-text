## Brother, How Close Can You Come? 
### BOD BERNSTEIN 
The 1949 Troy meet is now history—and what's that old line about
history repeating itself?
Our only hope is that Stanford doesn't have to wait another 16 years
for the golden opportunity.
Fourteen points sounds like a pretty decisive margin; but even a casual
analysis of the results reveals how close we really came.
As a matter ol fact, Stanfoid came within one foot of dumping the Tro
jans from their throne. Here's how it figures:
Gay Bryan lost the low hurdles by approximately six inches. Larry
Hoft was nosed out by Chambers by about the same amount in the anchor
lap of the relay. If the Cards had taken those two firsts, Stanfoid would
have won the, meet, 65 5 6 to (55 1/6.
Six inches plus six inches makes one loot. And that short one foot makes
the 112 igueroa footmen Pacific Coach track champions for 1949.
* * *
Who, Indeed
We've overheard quite a few fans wondering whether an individual ever
scored 18 points against the Trojans in a dual meet before Galloping Gay
turned the trick Saturday. Probably not.
Gaylord the Great will very likely become one of the Fables of the Farm
in the years to come.
F'rinstance:
Who but Gay could have kept an estimated 7,000 fans glued to their
seats watching one final broad jump when the meet was already lost
anyway?
And who but Gay could have won that broad jump with a tremendous
last leap after having worn himselt out with three solid hours of grueling
competition in five different events?
Nobody, that's who.
* * *
Now Hear This
Gay was pretty downhearted about losing that first place in the low
hurdles. "If I could have won that," he commented, "I know the relay
team could have won. When I lost, it naturally look some of the fight out
ol the boys."
There's one for the books: Gay Bryan accepting the responsibility for
Stanford's defeat.

Personable Tom Haynie, whose Card swimming teams have lost but
one dual meet during' his four-year reign as tank mentor, was dealt a
smashing blow Friday right where it hurts most.
Haynie announced Saturday that his number one performer and one
of the top free-stylers in the country, Rapid Ralph Sala, will be out of
competition for the remainder of the season. Ralph's valuable right arm
was rendered useless lor at least three weeks by its inopportune plunge
through a plate glass window during a bit of campus horseplay Friday
night.
The Card tankers shouldn t have much difficulty winning the two dual
meets still on the '49 schedule; but those high hopes for the PCC tourney
later this month have been rocked hard by Sala's injury.
Add coincidences: Sala was hurt during a water fight at his fraternity
house. Guess he just can't keep away from water.

We've overheard quite a few fans wondering whether an individual ever
scored 18 points against the Trojans in a dual meet before Galloping Gay
turned the trick Saturday. Probably not.
Gaylord the Great will very likely become one of the Fables of the Farm
in the years to come.
F'rinstance:
Who but Gay could have kept an estimated 7,000 fans glued to their
seats watching one final broad jump when the meet was already lost
anyway?
And who but Gay could have won that broad jump with a tremendous
last leap after having worn himselt out with three solid hours of grueling
competition in five different events?
Nobody, that's who.

Now Hear This
Gay was pretty downhearted about losing that first place in the low
hurdles. "If I could have won that," he commented, "I know the relay
team could have won. When I lost, it naturally look some of the fight out
ol the boys."
There's one for the books: Gay Bryan accepting the responsibility for
Stanford's defeat.

Personable Tom Haynie, whose Card swimming teams have lost but
one dual meet during' his four-year reign as tank mentor, was dealt a
smashing blow Friday right where it hurts most.
Haynie announced Saturday that his number one performer and one
of the top free-stylers in the country, Rapid Ralph Sala, will be out of
competition for the remainder of the season. Ralph's valuable right arm
was rendered useless lor at least three weeks by its inopportune plunge
through a plate glass window during a bit of campus horseplay Friday
night.
The Card tankers shouldn t have much difficulty winning the two dual
meets still on the '49 schedule; but those high hopes for the PCC tourney
later this month have been rocked hard by Sala's injury.
Add coincidences: Sala was hurt during a water fight at his fraternity
house. Guess he just can't keep away from water.
The 1949 Troy meet is now history—and what's that old line about
history repeating itself?
Our only hope is that Stanford doesn't have to wait another 16 years
for the golden opportunity.
Fourteen points sounds like a pretty decisive margin; but even a casual
analysis of the results reveals how close we really came.
As a matter ol fact, Stanfoid came within one foot of dumping the Tro
jans from their throne. Here's how it figures:
Gay Bryan lost the low hurdles by approximately six inches. Larry
Hoft was nosed out by Chambers by about the same amount in the anchor
lap of the relay. If the Cards had taken those two firsts, Stanfoid would
have won the, meet, 65 5 6 to (55 1/6.
Six inches plus six inches makes one loot. And that short one foot makes
the 112 igueroa footmen Pacific Coach track champions for 1949.
