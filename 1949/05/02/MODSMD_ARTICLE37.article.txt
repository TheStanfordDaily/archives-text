## SCRIMMAGE Whites Edge Reds 33-26 
### 
Thoughts that Stanford might have
a pretty fair football team come fal!
are just a little bit stronger in the
minds of some 1,200 persons who
attended the second spring game
Saturday.
They saw a White team nose out an
improved Red squad in the fourth
quarter by a 3U to 2U count. But
what was more important, they saw
flashes of brilliance in the perform
ances of three or four individuals, as
well as good team play.
Frosh quarterbacks Gary Kerko
rian and Dick Horn combined their
efforts to participate in three White
touchdowns. Each went over on
quarterback sneaks, and Kerkorian
hit Bill McColl with a 17-yard end
zone pass for a marker.
Both lads handled their offensive
duties well, with Horn once again
showing the ability that made him a
top-notch prep star.
But all other efforts of the day
were overshadowed by the perform
ance of Holbrook Boruck. Operating
from the White left half spot, Boruck
gave notice to one and all that he
must be counted in any of Coach
Marchie Schwartz's plans for next
season.
He went over his own right tackle
from six yards out for a score after
running a iourth down and eight
yards to go play 26 yards.
Alternating as lie was with frosh
flash Harry Hugasian, Boruck gave
the Red line no rest on quick opener
and counter plays.
Hugasian scored the other White
touchdown early in the game when
he intercepted Tom Shaw's intended
pass to Ken Ptose and went 35 yards
to score.
But the Whites were hard pressed
to win and did so only by a last
quarter score. The Reds, quarter
backed by Tom Shaw and Aubrey
Devine. sent their three B's, Dick
Broome, Boyd Benson, and John
Banks, across the goal line for scores.
Banks tallied on a 30-yard Devine
pass that he gathered in and romped
46 yards to score standing up. Half
backs Benson and Broome and full
back Bill DeYoung scored on run
ning plays. Broome and DeYoung
went 30 and 38 yards respectively for
their touchdowns.
A shortage of ends caused Bruce
Van Alstyne and Bill McColl to play
the whole game for the Whites, but
both men turned in outstanding per
formances both on offense and de
fense.
