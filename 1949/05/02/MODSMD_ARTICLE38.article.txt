# Card Mermen Swamp OC
## 
### 
It was a rough weekend for Farm
sports, but the old faithfuls of Stan
ford athletic circles, Tom Haynie
and his we - hate -to - lose varsity
swimmers saved the Big "S" from
a total shutout by out-splashing the
Olympic Club tankmen by a tidy 47
to 28 at the Encina Pools Saturday
morning.
They did it without the services
of their ace freestyler, Ralph Sala—
which is just the way they're going
to have to do it from here on out
for the rest of the year.
Sala was sidelined for the season
by an arm injury incurred Friday
afternoon.
Against the Olympic Club, the
Indians notched firsts in six of the
nine events and were never seri
ously threatened by the city lads.
Harry Borchers led the Card
point - makers by tying Woody
Hoogs for top honors in the 50-yard
sprint and winning the 100 - yard
event.
John Mowat captured the 220
freestyle, and Jack Weeden the 150-
yard backstroke, to round out the
list of Stanford victors in the indi
vidual events.
The locals' real superiority, how
ever, was in the relays, where they
garnered 12 big points to the in
vaders' none.
Jack Weeden, Marsh Pearlman,
and Warren Cutting captured the
300 medley, while Kelly, Cutting.
Mowat, and Hoogs were victors in
the four-man affair.
The Stanford freshmen made it
a perfect day for the tankers by
dunking the Olympic Club reserves
5§ to 19. Don Putnam won the 220
and backstroke events. Bob Wycoff
sprinted the 50 in 23.6 seconds,
and Russ La Telle captured breast

It was a rough weekend for Farm
sports, but the old faithfuls of Stan
ford athletic circles, Tom Haynie
and his we - hate -to - lose varsity
swimmers saved the Big "S" from
a total shutout by out-splashing the
Olympic Club tankmen by a tidy 47
to 28 at the Encina Pools Saturday
morning.
They did it without the services
of their ace freestyler, Ralph Sala—
which is just the way they're going
to have to do it from here on out
for the rest of the year.
Sala was sidelined for the season
by an arm injury incurred Friday
afternoon.
Against the Olympic Club, the
Indians notched firsts in six of the
nine events and were never seri
ously threatened by the city lads.
Harry Borchers led the Card
point - makers by tying Woody
Hoogs for top honors in the 50-yard
sprint and winning the 100 - yard
event.
John Mowat captured the 220
freestyle, and Jack Weeden the 150-
yard backstroke, to round out the
list of Stanford victors in the indi
vidual events.
