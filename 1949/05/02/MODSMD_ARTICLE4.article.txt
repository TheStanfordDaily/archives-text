(Editor's Note: Arguments for and against the proposed amendment
to the ASSU Constitution to change the Excom representation system
Have been presented l>y the Constitutional Revisions Committee for the
present system, and by Dick Kelton. for the proposed new system.)

believe that the amendment will
produce a more desirable system,
it is reasonable to give the more
desirable system the trial run. The
determinant question is not which
system exists, but which system you
prefer. That and that alone should
determine your vote.

Amendment ot the ASSU Con- I
stitution is under consideration. In ,
speaking to other students about the
proposed change. I encountered
varied and thoughtful questions.
A frequent question was: Why is
the area representation system pref
erable to a combination of class and :
area representation? My answer
would be: In a school as large as I
hours it is difficult, at best, to know
and keep in contact with a repre
sentative. When an election occurs !
the smaller the districts are. the :
more likelihood there is that any
one student would know the candi
dates.
The class system enlarges the dis
tricts in two ways. First, the classes
themselves are larger than the liv
ing group units as proposed. Sec
ondly. because the constitution has
class representation, it has had to
combine living groups into larger
unts than the amendment would
provide.
In addition when class represen
tative's are elected, there is no way
of knowing where they will reside.
Some living areas will have double
or tiiple or even greater represen
tation.
Finally one hears the question:
We have approved the constitution:
why not give the election system a
trial'.' It seems to me that it was
the constitution in general and not
the election system in particular
which was approved. It students
