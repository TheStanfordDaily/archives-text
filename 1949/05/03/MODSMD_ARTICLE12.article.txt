# Twenty Sponsors Needed For Men's Halls Next Year
## 
### 
About 20 sponsors will be needed
for freshmen men's halls next year,
said Mark Hatfield, member of the
ASSU sponsor-choosing committee.
Hatfield guessed that the commit
tee would have about 200 appli
cants. For that reason, he said, it
was going to be extremely difficult
to choose the 20 most qualified.
"We want them to know that this
is not just a place for a room," he
advised. He said it is the men
merely looking for a room that the
committee must weed out.
Job Takes Time
Hatfield emphasized that the job
takes time and work. Men who
have a heavy academic or extra
curricular program are advised
against applying for the job.
Some present sponsors will re
apply, Hatfield said. But "as far
as the committee is concerned every
man is in the same barrel." MeÂ«
who are sponsors now will have no
advantage, although their experience
must naturally be weighed.
Past experience is not essential.
Orient Fre-wimen
Outlining sponsors' duties, Hat
field said that the sponsor must
orient the freshman, aiding him in
adjusting to campus life and activi
ties.
During the first quarter, sponsors
run the Encina government. Winter
quarter, the government is half stu
dents and half sponsors. Freshmen
take the reins themselves during
spring quarter.
Get Free Reni
Sponsors, who must te upper di
vision or graduate students, receive
free rent and a choice of rooms.
They are given the job for the school
year, and may mav have One or

two roommates, who pay the regular
rent.
At present, there are 13 sponsor
#in Enema. It is still not known how
many will be needed for Stern Hah
The committee is composed o:
Don Fix, Sam Brenner, and Hatrielci
Applications for men's sponsoring
are now available in the ASSU Of
fice, and must be turned in by 4
o'clock Friday. The sponsor-choos
ing committee will advise each ap
plicant of the time and place of his
i interview.
