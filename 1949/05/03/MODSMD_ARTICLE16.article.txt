# Guilty .... or Not Guilty

Baseball is a democratic game in
which everybody is equal â€” espe
cially of you're a fan and the cops
think you have the ball.
That's what Dr. Claude A. Buss,
professor of Tar Eastern history,
writer, and one-time head of a U.S.
mission to the Philippines, found
out Saturday afternoon when a foul
ball landed in the stands near him
at the UCLA game.
Maybe it was his bright maroon
sport shirt that attracted them, for
three stands attendants, two uni
| formed police, and an athletic de
partment official descended on Dr.
Buss and proceeded to frisk him for

the missing ball, despite his vigor
ous protests of innocence.
P.S. They didn't find it.
