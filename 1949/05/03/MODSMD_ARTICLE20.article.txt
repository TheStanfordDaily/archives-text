## Three Events 
### 
Three events concerning student government will unfold this
week. Two of the events—NSA and the proposed Constitutional
amendment on representation—are so controversial that the third
event —spring elections—may come as an anti-climax.
Yesterday's and today's Dailies carry front-page articles by
two students on the representation question. Each student pre
sents his side of the issue, and we hope that every voter will
study their arguments before voting today.
The NSA issue will be a difficult one for Excom to decide to
morrow night. While NSA has not been successful at Stanford
this year, the organization is still young and undergoing local
and national growing pains. Excom must vote on the NSA ques
tion with two points in mind:
1. Will NSA mature into a more constructive, beneficial organ
ization for its members?
2. Will Stanford students contribute to and profit from NSA
once the project is overhauled on a local level?
Meanwhile, spring political activity will commence this week
with the primary elections Thursday. On the final elections day
next week The Daily will carry 50-word statements by the major
office candidates.
Combining all three events together, Farm men and women
will be taking the most active interest in student government
since last year's close ASSU and class elections.
