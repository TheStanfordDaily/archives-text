# Letters to the Editor
## For Amendment 
### 
To the Editor:
I urge all who plan to vote 'no" on the proposed plan of Excom repre
sentation to weigh carefully, before doing so, Mr. Kelton's letter to The
Daily, as well as a letter in last Tuesday's Daily, written by four people
including myself.
The plan of representation under the new Constitution is very inade
quate and does not have the numerical equality or representative advan
tages that the Constitutional Revision Committee claims for it. The follow
ing is an answer to this committee's article in yesterday's Daily.
Class representation is representation in name only. Furthermore, it is
possible that concerted electioneering on the part of one politically
interested living area might secure the election of the majority of class
Excom members from people in that area, thus giving it an unfair bal
ance of power iii Excom.
As for numerical equality, the plan under the new Constitution fails
again. Representation for off-campus students is unjustly small.
We have a chance today to correct one of the most undesirable parts
of this new Constitution. However, a two-thirds vote will be required to
do so. Therefore, 1 hope that everybody will make an effort to vote today,
and to vote "YES" on the representation amendment.
