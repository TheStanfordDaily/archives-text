# More Ticket Booths
## 
### 
To the Editor:
That the Stanford Athletic Department can't arrange to have more
than a few sets of ticket booths open for the convenience of its customers
when expecting the biggest track meet crowd in 20 years certainly disgusts
me.
In addition to having to pay an outrageous price for a track meet,
nearly half the spectators at the Stanford-USC meet missed the first four
or five events because of this discourtesy. Others simply turned around
and went home.
Having more booths open not only would have given everyone a chance
to get in at least in time for the mile, but also would have allowed a few
more boys to earn some spending money and all the ticket crew to see
more of the meet.
This was just one of the penny-wise policies that have built up a feeling
of extreme bitterness in thousands of fans who have attended athletic
events at Stanford. So many people have been burned so often at Stan
ford Stadium, that about all they go there for any more is to find fault
and root for the visiting team.
If the athletic department would stop acting like a wartime butcher,
probably two or three times as many Peninsula people would attend regu
larly as do now. And after all, these local fans make up the bulk of the
long-run paid attendance.
It seems to me that getting this situation squared away would be the
most convincing evidence Stanford could offer to prove it really means
to carry out its announced policy of closer cooperation with the people
of Palo Alto and other nearby cities.
Many Stanlord sports events provide very desirable entertainment to
sell. Why make them so inaccessible? The newspapers tell us it's more
and more a buyer's market every day.
