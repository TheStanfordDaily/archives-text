## Bull Session 
### 
Hang on to your hat. clad, here we go again
Several readers have written in to tell the editors that my columns
for last week were the most enjoyable ones I've done all year. Consid
ring that I didn't write at all last week, I shall ignore these "compliments"

and proceed with the Tuesday morning roundup.
For anyone who is interested, the absence from
Bull Session last week was caused by three midterms
and four performances of a play at the Little Theater.
The production was "The Petrified Forest," but I had
a very small part. I played a shrub.
After the play closed Saturday night, a San Fran
cisco producer came backstage and asked me if I
would like to play "Othello" for him. At least that's
what I thought he said. 1 found out Sunday that he
was from Finocchio's and wanted me to play "Oh.
fellow!"

My parents came down from Oakland on Thursday night to see the
show. They were going to bring my brother with them, but the police
have just put him in jail because of his fiat feet. They found his feet in
the neighbor's flat.

Random Harvest (or "Harvested at Random")
Several members of the varsity baseball team have been griping for
the past few weeks because of the red tape which the players must go
through to get into the Sunken Diamond for their pre-game warm-ups.
It seems that wearing a uniform isn't sufficient proof of their identity as
ballplayers. In addition to this, before they are admitted to the park they
must give their names to the gateman, who checks them off his list.
Four of the diamond men became a little tired of this procedure last
Saturday afternoon and decided they would irritate the gateman just a
mite. They waltzed up to the gate and rattled off their names as follows:
"Stan Musial," ' Joe DiMaggio," "Bob Feller," and "Lou Gehrig." To
their amazement, instead of getting mad. the gateman nodded his head,
made a few checks on his list, and said, "Okay, boys, you're all right . . . .
go ahead!"
# * *
As long as I started today's essay with "The Petrified Forest" as the
subject. I might as well end with a chuckle about the show.
If you're familiar with the story, you'll recall that the leading player is
shot to death by a gangster in the final minute of the last act. The entire
play hinges on the successful completion of this shooting. And. as with all
such stage deaths, the shooting was to be done with blank cartridges.
All went well with the blanks last Wednesday, the opening night. But
Thursday night the pistol became stubborn. The moment for the shooting
arrived; Hal Todd, the gangster, pulled the trigger, but nothing hap
pened. He pulled it again, and still no shot. Finally, on his third try. the
shell exploded, and the action went on to its normal conclusion.
Standing offstage while Hal was getting nothing but clicks from the
pistol, of course the only thing 1 could think of was "What the heck is he
going to do if that gun doesn't go off?"
Luckily it did go off. but I still haven't figured out what he would have
done if it hadn't. The best thought I've had so far is from a story in an old
Chappie where practically the same thing happened. The gangster in that
story threw down his gun, brushed his hand over the hero's face, and
said, "Ah, ha .... now I keel you wecth my poison ring!"

ballplayers. In addition to this, before they are admitted to the park they
must give their names to the gateman, who checks them off his list.
Four of the diamond men became a little tired of this procedure last
Saturday afternoon and decided they would irritate the gateman just a
mite. They waltzed up to the gate and rattled off their names as follows:
"Stan Musial," ' Joe DiMaggio," "Bob Feller," and "Lou Gehrig." To
their amazement, instead of getting mad. the gateman nodded his head,
made a few checks on his list, and said, "Okay, boys, you're all right . . . .
go ahead!"

As long as I started today's essay with "The Petrified Forest" as the
subject. I might as well end with a chuckle about the show.
If you're familiar with the story, you'll recall that the leading player is
shot to death by a gangster in the final minute of the last act. The entire
play hinges on the successful completion of this shooting. And. as with all
such stage deaths, the shooting was to be done with blank cartridges.
All went well with the blanks last Wednesday, the opening night. But
Thursday night the pistol became stubborn. The moment for the shooting
arrived; Hal Todd, the gangster, pulled the trigger, but nothing hap
pened. He pulled it again, and still no shot. Finally, on his third try. the
shell exploded, and the action went on to its normal conclusion.
Standing offstage while Hal was getting nothing but clicks from the
pistol, of course the only thing 1 could think of was "What the heck is he
going to do if that gun doesn't go off?"
Luckily it did go off. but I still haven't figured out what he would have
done if it hadn't. The best thought I've had so far is from a story in an old
Chappie where practically the same thing happened. The gangster in that
story threw down his gun, brushed his hand over the hero's face, and
said, "Ah, ha .... now I keel you wecth my poison ring!"

Hang on to your hat. clad, here we go again
Several readers have written in to tell the editors that my columns
for last week were the most enjoyable ones I've done all year. Consid
ring that I didn't write at all last week, I shall ignore these "compliments"

and proceed with the Tuesday morning roundup.
For anyone who is interested, the absence from
Bull Session last week was caused by three midterms
and four performances of a play at the Little Theater.
The production was "The Petrified Forest," but I had
a very small part. I played a shrub.
After the play closed Saturday night, a San Fran
cisco producer came backstage and asked me if I
would like to play "Othello" for him. At least that's
what I thought he said. 1 found out Sunday that he
was from Finocchio's and wanted me to play "Oh.
fellow!"

My parents came down from Oakland on Thursday night to see the
show. They were going to bring my brother with them, but the police
have just put him in jail because of his fiat feet. They found his feet in
the neighbor's flat.

Random Harvest (or "Harvested at Random")
Several members of the varsity baseball team have been griping for
the past few weeks because of the red tape which the players must go
through to get into the Sunken Diamond for their pre-game warm-ups.
It seems that wearing a uniform isn't sufficient proof of their identity as
ballplayers. In addition to this, before they are admitted to the park they
must give their names to the gateman, who checks them off his list.
