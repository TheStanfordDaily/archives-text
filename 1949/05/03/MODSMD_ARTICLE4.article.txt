# Epidemic Hits 51 Roble Girls
## 
### 
The cause of the sudden epidemic
which seems to have hit the Stan
ford campus early Sunday morning
is unknown to the Health Service
and the Public Health Department
of Stanford University.
Outbreaks first appeared in Roble
Hall about 3 Sunday morning. Since
then, cases have been reported along
the Row and in Palo Alto. The ma
jority of the cases are in Roble,
however, numbering 51 at noon yes
terday.
Symptoms are nausea and diar
rhea. sometimes accompanied by a
sore throat and slight pains. The
upset is not serious, only a little
uncomfortable. It occurs very sud
denly, sometimes in a matter of
minutes, and goes away just as sud
denlyâ€”usually lasting only 48 hours.
When the first cases were reported
to the Health Service, it was thought
that it was a case of food poisoning.
The Public Health Department on
campus started investigating and
found that the patients had eaten
no food in common. It was then
suggested that it could be caused by
the chemical spray on the lettuce,
but many of the patients liad not
eaten lettuce recently.
