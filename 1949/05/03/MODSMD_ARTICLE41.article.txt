# Stanford Crew Will Face World Champion Bears
## 
### JOHN HALL Daily Sports Editor 
Crew, lon« the orphan of Stanford's athletic program, will step into
the spotlight in a big way this weekend, when Stanford meets California
rr the first regattta ever to he held on the home waters.
Varsity, junior varsity, and frosh shells will all take part in the star
studded program which promises to attract at least 10,000 fans to the
South Bay course.
The appearance of Cal's shell alone should bring out a good portion
of the area's sport-minded, as the Bear oarsmen represent the very finest
in crew year-in and year-out.
Golden Bears Always Good
Ky Ebright's Golden Bears took first places in the 1938. '32, and '48
Olympic Games, and Ebright has coached more Poughkeepsie winners
than any other living crew coach.
The Bears have loat only two men from last season's world championship
eight, and are still rated as the top crew in the nation.
However, Stanford is not too awed by all of the Golden Bear advance
notices.
Lou Lindsey. Indian tub-thumper, says that Stanford's shells will stick
right with the Bears in each of the three races, and that a varsity win
ts not at all impossible.
Working with a veteran squad of oarsmen, including every man from
last year's eight which defeated USC. UCLA, San Diego State, and ihen
•a"as edged by California, Stanford's coach Commander Ace Clark has
whipped together a very capable outfit.
Spectators Get Good Break
At any rate, a great show is in the offing, and for once, the spectators
we getting a very good break.
Those planning this first Palo Alto Harbor Regatta have tried to work
«at a program based on every consideration for the spectators. To watch
the race there will be plenty ol room, easily accessible, and with no ob
structions to the view.
The City of Palo Alto has prepared a parking area next to the finish
line of the race which will accommodate over a thousand cars. Additional
tars will be able to park at the Palo Alto Ail - port and the Yacht Harbor,
which are four blocks from the finish line.
To help those unacquainted with crew, there will be a free, 12-page
picture program, including rosters of all the crews, a history of Cal-
Stanford rowing, and information on the judges, coaches, and participants
in the program.

Realizing that many persons will be heading for Berkeley to witness
the annual Stanford-California Big Track Meet, the regatta officials have
»,et the varsity starting time up to 10 a.m., so that there will be plenty
t)i time to watch the race, have lunch, and then start for Berkeley in
lime to see the Big Meet.
The frosh race will get under way at 9 a.m., with the junior varsities
getting together shortly afterwards at 9:30.
Admission to the whole works is free.
Crew, lon« the orphan of Stanford's athletic program, will step into
the spotlight in a big way this weekend, when Stanford meets California
rr the first regattta ever to he held on the home waters.
Varsity, junior varsity, and frosh shells will all take part in the star
studded program which promises to attract at least 10,000 fans to the
South Bay course.
The appearance of Cal's shell alone should bring out a good portion
of the area's sport-minded, as the Bear oarsmen represent the very finest
in crew year-in and year-out.
Golden Bears Always Good
Ky Ebright's Golden Bears took first places in the 1938. '32, and '48
Olympic Games, and Ebright has coached more Poughkeepsie winners
than any other living crew coach.
The Bears have loat only two men from last season's world championship
eight, and are still rated as the top crew in the nation.
However, Stanford is not too awed by all of the Golden Bear advance
notices.
Lou Lindsey. Indian tub-thumper, says that Stanford's shells will stick
right with the Bears in each of the three races, and that a varsity win
ts not at all impossible.
Working with a veteran squad of oarsmen, including every man from
last year's eight which defeated USC. UCLA, San Diego State, and ihen
•a"as edged by California, Stanford's coach Commander Ace Clark has
whipped together a very capable outfit.
Spectators Get Good Break
At any rate, a great show is in the offing, and for once, the spectators
we getting a very good break.
Those planning this first Palo Alto Harbor Regatta have tried to work
«at a program based on every consideration for the spectators. To watch
the race there will be plenty ol room, easily accessible, and with no ob
structions to the view.
The City of Palo Alto has prepared a parking area next to the finish
line of the race which will accommodate over a thousand cars. Additional
tars will be able to park at the Palo Alto Ail - port and the Yacht Harbor,
which are four blocks from the finish line.
To help those unacquainted with crew, there will be a free, 12-page
picture program, including rosters of all the crews, a history of Cal-
Stanford rowing, and information on the judges, coaches, and participants
in the program.
Public Address Keeps You Posted
There will also be a public address system connected with ship-to-shore
shortwave radio which will broadcast a complete description of all three
races.
