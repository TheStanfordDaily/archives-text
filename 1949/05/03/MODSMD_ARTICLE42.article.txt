# Boruck Stars As Gridsters Near 30 Mark
## 
### 
The footballers took a day off
from their spring drills yesterday
md the extra time might well have
been spent by Coach Schwartz con
templating what to do with his left
halfbacks.
As of Saturday's scrimmage Farm
football fans know what the coach
ing staff has known for somt time;
i.e., that in Harry liugasian and
Holy Boruck the Cards have two
very fine left halfbacks.
The first thought that appears to
most fans is to switch one of them
to right half. But Schwartz has no
less a player than Bob White oper
ating from that position. So Boruck
and Hugarsian will continue to al
ternate at left half, a situation that
would make few coaches cry.
Boruck is no stranger to Farm
athletics. He was on hand last fall
for practices but was ineligible to
compete. He had just transferred
from Yuba Junior College. So Holy
spent the afternoons making like
the star halfback of the team that
Stanford was to play the next week
â€”and doing a good job of it.
Rugby time came and Boruck
found himself playing on the first
string. His fast, hard, but shifty
running made him one of Coach
Chuck Taylor's better backs.
His rugby experience is showing
to full advantage during these
spring drills. He is one of the
hardest runners on the team. If
Schwartz were forced to name a
starting left half today he would
probably choose this 190-pounder.
But the problem of choosing a
left half does not stop yith the abil
ities of Boruch and Hugasian. Var
sity lettermen Boyd Benson, Rupe
Andrews, and Dave Field are yet to
be heard from. Benson is also look
ing good in the practices. He got
off to several long runs on Saturday
last.
Andrews and Field have given up
football for the spring to give their
full efforts to track. Field, in par
ticular. can be expected to put up a
good fight for the position, on de
fense at legist, come September.
