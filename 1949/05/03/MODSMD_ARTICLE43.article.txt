# Favored Card Trackmen Go After Bears Saturday
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
With the 1949 USC meet down in history, all eyes are shifted
to Berkeley for this Saturday's annual Big Meet with California
at the Bears' Edwards Field.
1 he Cards are out for their first victory over Cal since the war,

| but it will not be an easy win by
! any means. The USC-Cal meet
score of 84'•> to 46*2 fools everyone,
and the Cards will definitely have
i to push all the way to beat their
J Berkeley rivals.
The Trojan horde swept both the
440 and 880, and took a big 8':;
points in the pole vault against the
Bears. The Indians will have a
tough time sweeping these events.
The Cal distance crew, six strong,
will be tough to break. These six
: men took 18 out of 18 points in the
1 mile and the two-mile against the
j Trojans. Al Lyons, credited with a
4:18 mile last week against Troy,
will have to fight for second spot in
the mile.
The Stanford shotput trio. Otis
Chandler, Lew Davis, and Norm
| Nourse, will be favored to sweep
their event. There Ls also a strong
possibility that the Indians could
sweep the quarter mile, if Cass Bly
can run anywhere near his 48.1 re
lay Jap last Saturday.
In a list ol the country's best times
(published before last weekend's
meets), Stanford men placed high in
the country in many events.
The Farm s three outstanding field
men—Gay Bryan, Otis Chandler,
and Bud Held—are leading the
country so far this year in their re
spective events—the broad jump,
the shot put. and the javelin.
Other Card cindermen who are
high in the country: Lew Davis,
fourth in the shotput (behind Chan-
Hofl, fifth in the 440. Pitch Johnsan,
seventh in the 440, Gay Bryan, sev
enth in the 220, Gay Bryan, eighth
in the high jump, and Bob Bryan,
ninth in the low hurdles.
It would seem that the Cards have
quite a bit of strength for a national
meet. In addition, last Saturday's
efforts against the Trojans would
place Al Lyons, fifth in the mile, the
mile relay team third in the country
(behind New York University and
Southern California), and Downing
McKee, sixth in the high hurdles.
Fresno on May 14
The Stanford team will get its
first chance to demonstrate its team
strength, when they compete in the
annual Fresno Relays on May 14.
(he week after the Big Meet. Ol
course, the four men to beat again
will be the Trojans.
Incidentally, the Stanford relay
men will get another crack at the
Troy team at the Fresno Relays.
On the fast track, which Mel Pat
ton ran his famous 9.3 century,
there's no telling how fast the time
will be. The two crack relay teams
will also meet in the Coliseum Re
lays on May 20. in the PCC Meet
on May 28 (in Seattle), and in the
NCAA Meet on June 18 in Los An
geles.
The big question now is whether
Gay Bryan will run on the mile
relay team, in the different relay
meets. Bryan is capable of a very
last lap, although he never has keen
officially timed.
We imagine that Bryan will be
kept busy enough in his '"usual" five
events in the Big Meet next Satur
day. and will not have time to run
the relay.


COACH JACK WEIERSHAUSER.
inspirational Indian track mentor,
is seeking his first victory over
California since before the war,
when the Cards meet the Bears
on Edwards Field this Saturday.
