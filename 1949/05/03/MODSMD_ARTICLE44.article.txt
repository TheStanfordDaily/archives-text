Theta Chi Red. in the first of the
intermyral playoffs, thumped a
seemingly listless El Tigre "nine, 5
to 2, yesterday on the intramural
field. The winning pitcher was
boxer Willie Altus, who clicked for
his sixth straight victory of the sea
son. Outstanding man for the Big
Red was Bob Aimes who managed
to get all over the field from the
short-stop spot.
The Rt'ds play their next game in
the race for the intramural pennant
Thursday against a powerful Sigma
Chi nine.
