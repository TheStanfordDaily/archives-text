## The
						Front Row 
### 
Everv so often you learn something. Such as not to pick against a USC
track squad.
To do so is moronic, stupid, and just plain foolish, because Tom Troy
has got all the angles pegged, and when it comes time for action, he just
presses a lew buttons and that's it. Except that this time out. he had 10
press a few more buttons.
But seeing as how all the ifs and whys and wherefores of Stanford's
defeat have been dragged down to the danger point, I'll let you off this
morning with a casual mention that it was nice to see Don Campbell come
through in the pole-vault, to see Dave Dun lap grab that third in the
high jump, to see Steve McKee take the discus, and to watch A 1 Lyons
put his whole heart into winning the mile.
The rest of the meet figured.
What About the Meet?
At yet, predictions lor the Big Meet this.Saturday are still being double
checked, but it would seem, but don't get .too excited, tliat Stanford will
have more luck against the Bears than it did against the Trojans.
And it has been just about as long since Stanford downed Cal, the last
time dating back to 1940.
So far, Coach Jack Weiershauser's tab that A 1 Lyons will nip Kaare
Vefting in the mile sets the pace for optimism, although Lyons is getting
better every week and has already displayed a great heart, one factor
needed in the makeup of any winning miler.
If it hadn t been for USC, I would have been certain that Stanford
would defeat California in the 1949 Big Meet.
Rally Com, that organization, failed again to put on a successful rally
last Friday.
This time it seemed as if they couldn't go wrong. A rally for the track
team on the eve of hs big meet with USC seemed a natural.
In Dink Teinpleton. Jack Weiersharuser, and Gay Bryan, the so-called
Rally Committee boasted three of the best speakers to be featured at a
Stanford rally in the post three years.
In Dean Borba, the boys and ftirls with the white sweaters, easily owned
the best master of ceremonies that money could have bought.
But they messed up the whole works with the introduction of a bunch
of bungling try-outees for cheer-leader jobs, who added about as much
punch as the drinks at Dinah's.
They Played Drop the Hankie
While people were trying to get a little track talk, these clowns were
leading yells by dropping handkerchiefs, tumbling, and tossing post
toasties (pep) to the crowd.
Some day, let us pray, someone in Rally Com will plan an intelligent,
entertaining, and capable show, one that will be to the point, and will
allow those present to get into the spirit of things without tying up over
the antics of several screw-ball cheer-leaders.
Quick Ones:
After dropping their first clean-swept series in history to UCLA last
Saturday, Stanford s l»asebal!ers were pointing toward their first series
win over California.
Farm horsehiders figure that such a win over California will make
some kind of a success out of the '49 season.
CIBA. to clear up a long-standing mystery, stands for California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association.
Add Crew:
One of the most entertaining events on the Spring Sports schedule will
take place this weekend when California's Olympic champion crew will
invade Palo Alto Harbor to meet Stanford in the first regatta ever to be
held on the local course. It should prove to be worth seeing.
