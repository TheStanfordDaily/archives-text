# Papoose Spikemen End Season at Cal
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Putting in their final practice
licks, the Indian frosh track squad
winds up its successful season with
the "Little Big Meet" against the
Cal Cubs next Saturday at Cal.
With only one loss to Stockton, a
G7-64 thriller, marring their record,
the Papooses rate as solid favorites
over their rivals from across the
Bay. Best competition should be in
the mile, 880, broad jump, and two
mile.
Biggest Bear threat for a blue
ribbon is sensational Lew Olive. A
distanceman from "ol" Kentuck,"
Olive has best times of 4:2G.(5 in
the mile and 2:00.5 In the 880.
Woo'ey Must St nun
Stanford's John Woolev, who dkl
a 4:29 in high school, will have to
lower his season's best to capture
tlie mile. Woolev and Herb Cohen
are both crowding 2:01 in the half
lor the Indians.
Other Cal stars are Kent Stain
field and Dick Hare, a pair of 22
feet or better broad jumpers. Wil
bur Taylor, who looks good for a
double win in the sprints, will have
to get off some good leaps to out
jump the Cal kids. Taylor's times
for the dashes are :10 flat and:21.8.
Flashy Bob Barry, frosh two-mil
er, will get some rough competition
from Juette, as both are running in
the low 10:20's.
The 440 foursome of Wally Mc-
Camant, Ken Payson, Nelson Ju
dah, and Stan Dawson, who also
handle the relay chores, could con
ceivably sweep the quarter. Always
beating each other for first places,
the cne-lappers are all around 52.
McCamant, former Portland city
champ, has the top time with a
:50.9 to his credit.
In the hurdles things look fairly
secure for the Papooses. Bill Sto
rum, who runs both the higlis and
lows in :15 and:25 respectively, is

well supported by teammates Paul
Warner and Jim Pollock, both ini
; proving' weekly.

j man, is firstest with the mostest ui

the steel ball over 47 leet consist
ently, and last week he topped
J Frank Bradley in the pJatter toso
, Bradley hit 135 ft., while Hokar.-

In the remaining fiekl events,
j both schools appear weak. If foot
| bailer Rod Lippold throws the jav

j first. Other spear artists are Da:i
t Evans, Chuck Moody, and Chuck
Tulin. Dick Horn, another pigskk?

Tom Rickords at 12 it. for support.

Putting in their final practice
licks, the Indian frosh track squad
winds up its successful season with
the "Little Big Meet" against the
Cal Cubs next Saturday at Cal.
With only one loss to Stockton, a
G7-64 thriller, marring their record,
the Papooses rate as solid favorites
over their rivals from across the
Bay. Best competition should be in
the mile, 880, broad jump, and two
mile.
Biggest Bear threat for a blue
ribbon is sensational Lew Olive. A
distanceman from "ol" Kentuck,"
Olive has best times of 4:2G.(5 in
the mile and 2:00.5 In the 880.
Woo'ey Must St nun
Stanford's John Woolev, who dkl
a 4:29 in high school, will have to
lower his season's best to capture
tlie mile. Woolev and Herb Cohen
are both crowding 2:01 in the half
lor the Indians.
Other Cal stars are Kent Stain
field and Dick Hare, a pair of 22
feet or better broad jumpers. Wil
bur Taylor, who looks good for a
double win in the sprints, will have
to get off some good leaps to out
jump the Cal kids. Taylor's times
for the dashes are :10 flat and:21.8.
Flashy Bob Barry, frosh two-mil
er, will get some rough competition
from Juette, as both are running in
the low 10:20's.
The 440 foursome of Wally Mc-
Camant, Ken Payson, Nelson Ju
dah, and Stan Dawson, who also
handle the relay chores, could con
ceivably sweep the quarter. Always
beating each other for first places,
the cne-lappers are all around 52.
McCamant, former Portland city
champ, has the top time with a
:50.9 to his credit.
In the hurdles things look fairly
secure for the Papooses. Bill Sto
rum, who runs both the higlis and
lows in :15 and:25 respectively, is

well supported by teammates Paul
Warner and Jim Pollock, both ini
; proving' weekly.
