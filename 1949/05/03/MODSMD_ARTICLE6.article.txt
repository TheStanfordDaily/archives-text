# Amendment To Face Test In Campus Election Today
## 
### THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION COMMITTEE DICK KELTON 
(Editor's Note: Arguments for an against the proposed amendment
to the ASSU Constitution to change the Excom representation system
have been presented by the Constitutional Revisions Committee for the
present system, and l»y Dick Kelton, for the proposed new system.)

We urge that you vote NO today
in the special election.
The area system of representa
tion which was in effect from 1945
until the passage of the new Con
stitution and its sequel, the system
to be voted on today, were inves
tigated by the Constitutional Re
vision Comniitee and found to have
many disadvantages. Some of the
more important are:
1. The system is completely in
flexible in that each change in the
distribution of students in the var
ious areas by virtue of a change in
the size of the student body or the
addition of new living quarters un
balances the system and will re
quire an amendment to the Con
stitution, a procedure which is cost
ly and can be badly abused.
(■roup Interest
2. The system is strictly arbitrary
since the areas must be determined
on the unsubstantial basis of "group
interest" and there can be na uni
form basis upon which to judge this
intangible factor. As evidenced by
today's election, any special '"inter
est group" may attempt to adjudge
this qualitative factor for its own
benefit by petitioning to amend the
Constitution today, tomorrow, next
week, ad infinitum.
3. The system penalizes the fresh
man class since it makes it impos
sible for its members to vote or run
for an Executive Committee posi
tion since they do not know in
which area they will live the fol
lowing year.
Old System Unfair
4. The system is undemocratic in
that there is no numerical equality
among the areas. Thus Roble has
one representative for about 260
students while Encina has one for
about 550 students, and off-campus
has two representatives for about
3,700 students. The class system of
representation which served Stan
ford well for 55 years provided for
a justifiable and flexible numerical
system of representation, but failed
to guarantee any distribution of
representatives throughout the dif
ferent sections of the campus.
The system of representation now
in effect in the new Constitution
combines these two other systems
in such a manner as to eliminate
their disadvantages and yet main
tain their advantages. Vote NO to
day and retain this democratic sys
tem.

I was talking to a friend and he
asked me if I believed that the sys
tem proposed by the amendment
was entirely satisfactory. I would
be the first person to admit that the
proposed system is not foolproof,
but the amendment is nol compet
ing with perfection.
I hope no one will vote against
the amendment merely because it
fails to reach perfection, because a
"No" vote for the amendment is a
"Yes" vote lor the present system,
which also has its faults. Compare
the two proposals, and remember
whichever way you vote you are
making a choice between the two
systems.
Unequal Representation
In yesterday's Daily the Consti
tutional Committee's main argu
ment for the present system was
that it gave equality of voting. Yet
they have assigned one Excom
member each to: Union Unit with
192 residents, Women's Row with
299 residents, the Village with 1,142
residents, each class with over 1,000
members, and off-campus with 3,744
students. Nuff said?
Under the change indicated by
the amendment the Village would
have three instead of one represen
tative, the Men's Row would have
two instead of one representative,
the women's residences would have
four instead of three representa
tives, the freshman class would
have two (Encina and Roble) in
stead of one representative, and off
campus. including the Village,
would have five instead of two rep
resentatives.
Everyone Chains
Every segment of the student
body gains by voting for the amend
ment. yet, since class representa
tives are eliminated, the total num
ber of members on Excom would
be increased by only two.
I'm sure that I am expressing the
opinion of the overwhelming ma
jority of the student body when I
extend my thanks to the Constitu
tional Committee for their efforts.
All the campus agrees that on the
whole the new Constitution is a
vast improvement over the old one,
and I hope that the members of the
Committee will realize that our ob
jection is to but a small portion of
their work, while our support and
thanks are for the greatest part of
the document they produced.
Just a final word before you vote.
Your opinion is as good as anyone
else's. Don't let your choice depend
on some other person's unsubstan
tiated opinion. Think for yourself,
then vote, and DO vote.
