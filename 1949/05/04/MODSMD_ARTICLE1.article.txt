## Drama Fulfills Man's Quest 
### BARBARA METZGER 
Man's faith in the universe is ex
emplified in the theater.
This is what Maurice Browne, I
British dramatist, told his audience i
last night at the Tuesday Evening j
Series. His voice was throaty but
soft, and he spoke with the convic
tion of a man who loves and be
lieves in his work.
''Everything that we find in life j
and every kind of person from Cali
ban to Prospero. Shakespeare has
given to us in his plays." Browne
explained that appreciation for the
arts is more than sensory percep- ;
tion; it is a spiritual apperception.
Ine theater exemplifies the spiri
tual need of the soul for something
other than ourselves. Browne claims '
that it is not an accident that both '
the theater and religion fulfill his
quest.
Tragedy's basic tale is always the i
same. The hero rises to a position I
of honor and then falls; but the ex
traordinary thing is that the higher
he has risen and the greater the :
fall, the more we rejoice. The same
thing happens in religion, he added.
The hero rose to a position among j
his followers and then was cruci
fied. Therein lay our salvation.
"This spiritual experience that !
man sees in a great play is what i
keeps people in the theater." j
Browne concluded with a quotation ;
from Euripides: "Whoever can know ,
as the long days go that life is hap- I
piness has found his heaven."
