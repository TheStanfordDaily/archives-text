### 
Stanford's student carillonneur
appeared before Men's Council yes
terday and pleaded guilty. He was
sentenced to five hours of work at
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
The student was apprehended by
police just before midnight last
Monday as he tried to escape from
the Hoover Library after playing the
caril'vm. On two other occasions
the student had entered the library
before closing time and remained to
play the bolls from the keyboard.
240 feet up in 'the tower, once at
5:45 and again at 9:45.
The only damage to the Library
was a broken hasp on the carillon
keyboard room lock. The student
left 45 cents to pay for a new hasp.
Council felt that the carillon-play
ing was merely a prank carried out
without any intent to do damage,
and therefore merited only a light
penalty.
Present at Council meeting were
Bob Anderson, chairman; Jack
Barnes, Bob Setrakian, and Howard
Lewis.
