# New Twins Solve Housing Problem
## 
### 
Twin girls turned out to be a twin
blessing to Willard R. Tate, 24-year
old Navy veteran who plans to en
ter Stanford next fall.
Tate, an electrical engineering
graduate from Utah, and his wife
and child were stymied about find
ing a place in which to live here.
They had applied for a Village
apartment, but wore far down on
the waiting list.
Then on April 15, Mrs. Tate had
twin girls. You wouldn't think this
would solve their housing problem,

but that is just what it did. The
couple, who live in San Diego, have
just been notified that they now
have plenty of points to get their
apartment in September.
