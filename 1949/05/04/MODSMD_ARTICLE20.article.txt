# Vivid Paintings Stand Out In Exhibit at Art Gallery
## 
### JAN HANSEN 
There's a new show at the Art Gallery, and this time it's a
good one. All the pieces in the show are the work of members
of the art faculty at San Jose State College. In addition to paint
:ngs in various media, there are pieces of sculpture, ceramics,
;'ewelry, and textiles on display.
Robert Coleman did two of the best paintings. These are both

oils and very similar to each other
in subject matter and general treat
ment. The better of the two is a
large still life of flowers in a glow
ing ruby vase. The coloring is bril
liant and the composition excellent.
Coleman has done the painting in
flat abstract design.
His other oil is another still life
of flowers and artichokes. There is
the same flat abstract design, car
vied a little further, and the same
vivid coloring. The composition is
again good, and the brush technique
free. Both the paintings have an
Oriental quality in their design
which faintly resembles the style of
Matisse.
Reserved Style
J. W. McCullough's paintings don't
have the eye-catching brilliance of
Coleman's, but his style and more
subdued use of color are excellent.
His best is an oil of an old white
church. There is good handling of
color values here; the picture glows.
The composition is also very well
done.
McCullough has a very distinctive
style which is apparent in all his
work. "Backs Against the Wall"
captures a mood well. It is done
in guache (opaque water color tech
nique) in a free, sketchy style. The
tone of the picture is somber—the
drab grey fronts of tenements —but
there is a feeling of life glowing be
neath the surface. He achieves this
effect with a sparse use of a bright,
color .... the red sweater of a
Negro girl .... the warm glow
of light through a window shade.
"Gear" is a semi-abstract compo
sition with the same color treat
ment—predominantly subdued with
small bright areas.
Theodore Johnson has an oil of a
clown in the show that is quite well
done. The composition is well
worked out and the color is glowing,
almost a little too bright. He also
has a very nice water color of
breakers in the show. It was done
with wet paper technique which
gives the picture a nice liquid feel
ing of swirling water and spray.
Sculpture and Ceramics
The sculpture group is not as dis
tinctive as the paintings. The fat
lady by Gates shows good use of
the grain of the wood.
There are a few nice pieces in the
ceramics collection. The best is a
mottled brown and white pitcher by
Lovera. He also did a beautifully
modeled bowl in the same material.
The jewelry exhibit is the work
of Robert Coleman. There are only
a few pieces shown but they are
unusual and nicely done. Coleman
works in abstract designs in silver
with some jade.
The textiles, by Gladys Vogelma,
are nice, but not unusual. The most
interesting pieces are one pastel
plaid shot with gold thread and a
heavy dark green plaid in green,
blue, and gold.
Although in general the rest of
the exhibit doesn't come up to the
paintings, the entire show is very
good, and is a great deal better
than the previous exhibit.

mottled brown and white pitcher by
Lovera. He also did a beautifully
modeled bowl in the same material.
The jewelry exhibit is the work
of Robert Coleman. There are only
a few pieces shown but they are
unusual and nicely done. Coleman
works in abstract designs in silver
with some jade.
The textiles, by Gladys Vogelma,
are nice, but not unusual. The most
interesting pieces are one pastel
plaid shot with gold thread and a
heavy dark green plaid in green,
blue, and gold.
Although in general the rest of
the exhibit doesn't come up to the
paintings, the entire show is very
good, and is a great deal better
than the previous exhibit.
There's a new show at the Art Gallery, and this time it's a
good one. All the pieces in the show are the work of members
of the art faculty at San Jose State College. In addition to paint
:ngs in various media, there are pieces of sculpture, ceramics,
;'ewelry, and textiles on display.
Robert Coleman did two of the best paintings. These are both

oils and very similar to each other
in subject matter and general treat
ment. The better of the two is a
large still life of flowers in a glow
ing ruby vase. The coloring is bril
liant and the composition excellent.
Coleman has done the painting in
flat abstract design.
His other oil is another still life
of flowers and artichokes. There is
the same flat abstract design, car
vied a little further, and the same
vivid coloring. The composition is
again good, and the brush technique
free. Both the paintings have an
Oriental quality in their design
which faintly resembles the style of
Matisse.
Reserved Style
J. W. McCullough's paintings don't
have the eye-catching brilliance of
Coleman's, but his style and more
subdued use of color are excellent.
His best is an oil of an old white
church. There is good handling of
color values here; the picture glows.
The composition is also very well
done.
McCullough has a very distinctive
style which is apparent in all his
work. "Backs Against the Wall"
captures a mood well. It is done
in guache (opaque water color tech
nique) in a free, sketchy style. The
tone of the picture is somber—the
drab grey fronts of tenements —but
there is a feeling of life glowing be
neath the surface. He achieves this
effect with a sparse use of a bright,
color .... the red sweater of a
Negro girl .... the warm glow
of light through a window shade.
"Gear" is a semi-abstract compo
sition with the same color treat
ment—predominantly subdued with
small bright areas.
Theodore Johnson has an oil of a
clown in the show that is quite well
done. The composition is well
worked out and the color is glowing,
almost a little too bright. He also
has a very nice water color of
breakers in the show. It was done
with wet paper technique which
gives the picture a nice liquid feel
ing of swirling water and spray.
Sculpture and Ceramics
The sculpture group is not as dis
tinctive as the paintings. The fat
lady by Gates shows good use of
the grain of the wood.
There are a few nice pieces in the
ceramics collection. The best is a
mottled brown and white pitcher by
Lovera. He also did a beautifully
