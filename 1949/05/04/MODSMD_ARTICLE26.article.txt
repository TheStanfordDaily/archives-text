# SIRO Ships Texts, Novels Overseas
## 
### 
SIRO is starting shipments of j
books to a dozen European and Asi
atic universities, including those i
represented by Stanford's foreign 1
scholarship students.
Since the University of Finland 1
and others have sent word that
they are interested in reading some
of the best-sellers in America dur
ing the past few years, such books :
as "Gentlemen's Agreement," "The
Big Fisherman." "The Keys of the
Kingdom," and "All the King's
Men" are being sent as well as
school books.
The project will continue through
summer quarter, so some student
who plans to be on campus this
summer will be needed to take
charge of the program, says Pat
Terry, SIRO co-chairman. Anyone
who is interested in the project, es- ;
pecially during the summer, is ]
asked to contact the lIR office.
