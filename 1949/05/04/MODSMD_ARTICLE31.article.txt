# Housing Preferential System
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We protest the decision of the Housing Committee' in allocating 25 per
cent of the vacancies in Toyon and Stern to the present freshman class.
Admission of Encina men to Toyon and Stern will increase the number
of years that many men must remain off-campus.
It would seem that the men in the eight undergraduate Village houses
should definitely be given preference over present Encinn frosh in respect
tc housing on campus. Our solution:
Allocation of campus vacancies should be apportioned on a basis of
cjuurters spent off-campus.
