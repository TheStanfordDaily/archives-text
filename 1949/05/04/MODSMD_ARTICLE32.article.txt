# Encina Water Bagging
## 
### 
To the Editor:
This is an open letter to all Encina students on the subject of water
bagging. It is written because of the thorough soaking which my husband
and I received on our way home from the Stanford-SC track meet Satur
day afternoon.
Now, ordinarily, we arc willing lo go along with college-boy "pranks."
'A*e are both Stanford students of a few years back, and we have seen
plenty of waterbagging. We realize that to drive by Encina in an open
convertible is to court disaster, and we are ready to take our chances.
But Saturday we hud with us not only our two young children, but also
a friend, the wife of the Stanford team trainer, and her two-year-old
son. We were bombarded as we drove past Encina, and we were all
showered. My 10-month-old daughter narrowly missed possible serious
injury by a direct hit, and she was frightened to the point of terror.
Stanford prides itself on its fair play in the field of sports, but it cannot
be proud of Stanford "men" who completely disregard the safety and well
being of babies and young children, to say nothing of adults, with their
idea of "sport."
If Stanford students haven t learned ordinary common sense and
decency by the time they come to college, then all the Western Civ and
English and whatnot they learn there won't help them when they graduate,
it seems fair enough to ask that waterbagging, if it must continue, bo
confined to students only, at times when the roads are not crowded with
cars, since otherwise there is bound to be a serious accident some day.
We, and many others, are proud of Stanford and its students, but our
pride turns to disappointment and disgust when such incidents occur.
