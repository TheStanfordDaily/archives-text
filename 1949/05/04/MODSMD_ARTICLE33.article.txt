# Shanghai Will Be Problem for Reds
## 
### 
In Shanghai the Chinese Commu
nists will find their biggest prize—
and probably their biggest problem.
Normally the city is the world's [
third greatest port. At times only !
New York and London have out
ranked it in size and volume of
shipping.
No other port anywhere normally '
handles such a large proportion of '
its country's foreign and domestic
commerce.
This cosmopolis on the Yangtze
Delta also is the dwelling place of
more than 5,000,000 people whose
way of life is about as far from
Communism as it's possible to get. !
Some 10,000 of these are foreigners, j
Shanghai is synonymous with
profit-taking and no-holds-barred
commercial competition. Great !

wealth exists side by side with deep
poverty and squalor. If the police
don't shoo them away, paupers die
every night in cold weather on the
steps of business houses repre
senting some of the greatest for
tunes in the world.
The city's international character
—still real in a faded way although
the old legal basis is gone — has
slowed down the solution of prob
lems that express themselves in
Shanghai's myriad contrasts.
—Sleek motorcars jostle the man
powered rickshas and pedicabs in
the choking traffic.
—"Skyscrapers" 18 stories high
tower over the simple life in a fam
ily sampan.
—Teletypes and calculating ma

ragged mass of people still largely |

Built by foreign and Chinese
capitalism, Shanghai portrays both i
the evils of exploitation and the '
magic potential of invested capital i
to improve the lives of men. The
Reds and others have made much ol i
the way it has done the job un- '
evenly in Shanghai.
Given a chance, Shanghai always ;
bounces back from war and depres- |
sion. What the Reds do with the
human motives behind such things ;
as the uncontrollable black market
which has dominated Shanghai's !
commerce for a decade can affect the ,
course of world history.
Shanghai got going a century ago !
when a Manchu joke on the for
eigner backfired.
China—or rather the Manchu gov
ernment—had just lost the opium j
war with England. The Treaty of
Nanking which ended this war in
1842 named Shanghai as one of five 1
treaty ports where foreigners could j
live and trade.

Shanghai got going a century ago !
when a Manchu joke on the for
eigner backfired.
China—or rather the Manchu gov
ernment—had just lost the opium j
war with England. The Treaty of
Nanking which ended this war in
1842 named Shanghai as one of five 1
treaty ports where foreigners could j
live and trade.
In Shanghai the Chinese Commu
nists will find their biggest prize—
and probably their biggest problem.
Normally the city is the world's [
third greatest port. At times only !
New York and London have out
ranked it in size and volume of
shipping.
No other port anywhere normally '
handles such a large proportion of '
its country's foreign and domestic
commerce.
This cosmopolis on the Yangtze
Delta also is the dwelling place of
more than 5,000,000 people whose
way of life is about as far from
Communism as it's possible to get. !
Some 10,000 of these are foreigners, j
Shanghai is synonymous with
profit-taking and no-holds-barred
commercial competition. Great !

wealth exists side by side with deep
poverty and squalor. If the police
don't shoo them away, paupers die
every night in cold weather on the
steps of business houses repre
senting some of the greatest for
tunes in the world.
The city's international character
—still real in a faded way although
the old legal basis is gone — has
slowed down the solution of prob
lems that express themselves in
Shanghai's myriad contrasts.
—Sleek motorcars jostle the man
powered rickshas and pedicabs in
the choking traffic.
—"Skyscrapers" 18 stories high
tower over the simple life in a fam
ily sampan.
—Teletypes and calculating ma
chines click away in the midst of a

ragged mass of people still largely |
unable to read.
Built by foreign and Chinese
capitalism, Shanghai portrays both i
the evils of exploitation and the '
magic potential of invested capital i
to improve the lives of men. The
Reds and others have made much ol i
the way it has done the job un- '
evenly in Shanghai.
Given a chance, Shanghai always ;
bounces back from war and depres- |
sion. What the Reds do with the
human motives behind such things ;
as the uncontrollable black market
which has dominated Shanghai's !
commerce for a decade can affect the ,
course of world history.
