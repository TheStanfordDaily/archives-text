### Priscilla Claudius 
rr WON'T BE FLOWERS by Eliza
beth Berridge (Simon and Schu
ster)

"This might happen any day
So be careful what you say or do
Be clean, be tidy, oil the lock
Trim the garden, wind the clock
Remember the two."
That is the essence of Life, the
staid, disciplined, cheerless routine
of the Bank of England. Three girls
begin work there on the same day;
the book is their storyâ€”three dis
similar people brought together by
the common bonds of boredom, rest
lessness, and disillusionment.
Already dissatisfied with their
solid, middle-class life, they lose !
even the unwilling relationship j
when the war comes. They are
morally, i! not actually cast adrift.
The fust one to leave is Helen. At
19, she is a brittle, ambitious wom
an. She first becomes the mistress j
of a cynical Hungarian refugee,
Egon. When Egon outlives his use- !
fulness, Helen proceeds to a more 1
influential rake who gives her the j
chance in radio which she has been ;
after.
The other two girls, Fiona and J
Laura, stay on at the Bank. When
their office is moved to the country '
during the war, they move with it. <
Eventually Laura marries a Welsh ;
schoolmaster. Fiona escapes the
postwar austerity by fleeing to j
America.
It Won't Be Flowers is centered .
on a women's world. The Bank, an
old institution, scrupulously keeps
the women employees set apart from I
any contact with men. To the older
women, the Bank is a safe, secure
haven. To the young gals, it is a
terrible threat to their individuality.
Out of their struggle to escape its
deadly routine, which is a symbol of
English middle-class staleness, Eliz
abeth Berridge has skillfully por
trayed the bewildering change the
war made on that class.
All in all, this is a book which j
will most generally appeal to women
readers. Although, apart from the
plot, it presents an enlightening pic
ture of the revolution in English
life in the last decade.
