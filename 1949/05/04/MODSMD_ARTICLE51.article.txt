## Lippy Cleared By Chandler

CINCINNATI, May 3 (/P).—Com
missioner A. B. (Happy) Chandler
gave Leo Durocher a clean bill of
health today and demanded every
baseball club in the country take
immediate measures to protect its
players from the abuse of fans.
In less than two hours, Chandler
found there was not sufficient evi
dence to indicate the New York
Giants' manager had "deliberately
assaulted" Fred Boysen, a fan of
Puerto Rican descent, after a game
at the Polo Grounds last Thursday.
"Under the circumstances, the
suspension against Durocher is lift
ed immediately and Durocher will
rejoin his team on Wednesday. May

4." Chandler announced as movie
and still cameras preserved the
happy scene for baseball posterity.
I'ne commissioner took a belt
both at club owners who have not
properly policed their parks and at
fans who have abused the athletes.
"There is ample evidence," he
said, "that the Polo Grounds was
not properly policed on the after
noon of April 28, or Fred Boysen
would not have been permitted to
move about in the box seat section,
for which he had no ticket, and to
hurl insulting language, which he
directed at Durocher principally,
and wovdd not have been on the
field at the conclusion of the game.
"Fair play demands that vicious
name-calling by fans, in the direc
tion of players, be not indulged in.
Ball players have a right to protec
tion from unwarranted abuse."
President Horace Stoneham of the
Giants, beaming at the quick ac
quittal of his peppery little man
ager, promised the situation would
be rectified immediately at the Polo
Grounds.
In New York, Benjamin H. Cha
sin, attorney for Boysen, upon be
ing informed that Durocher had
been cleared, said:
"That's good."
He declared, however, that he
will proceed with the procecution of
Durocher on a simple assault charge.
The reinstatement, he continued,
will have no legal bearing on the
law case.
