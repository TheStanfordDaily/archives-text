Ihe saddest are these: *It might have been!*
Emei y Mitchell will not play football next fall, either as a quarterbac
01 lull back. Ilis decision, and I think it is a very wise one, came aftc
the team doctors told him that if he injured his knee again it would b
doubtiul that he could walk without a limp. So he is going to lay out
year to let the leg fully heal. He may play in 1950, but I rather doubt it.
It is thus that we close the cover on a book that wo had only begun i
read. I personally feel that only the table of contents has been reveale<
We wei e given just a hint oi the story that was to come, and then th
book was closed and taken away.
And that story was a tale of great things to come. Mitchell, as Lloy
Merriman before him, gave promise of becoming an all-time Coast loot
ball great. Neither played more than a year for Stanford. Both wei
fullbacks and neither had the chance to show what he could do again:
California. Injuries took their toll in both cases.
Mitch is a competitor of the first grade. He is, or was, a footba
player's player. He was rough and tough. He liked the game. He It
the team in total yardage last year, though he played but seven game
He ranked 14th in the Conference with only seven games, compared to J
lor the other leaders.
He led the team in the times-carried-ball department when he was ii
jured in the opening minutes of the Army game. He amassed a total <
532 yards gained, 222 of these through passes. And he didn't throw
pass until the fourth game of the season.
So it is that Coach Marchmont Schwartz has lost the Coast's best ful
back in two out of the four years since the war. I said last year, and wi
repeat here, that if I had my choice between Mitchell and j. Jensen as
ballplayer, I would take Mitchell.
How would you like a combination of Gary Kerkorian, Holy Boruc
Bob White, and Mitchell in the 1949 Stanford backfield? But for oi
play in the Army game, Schwartz might well have expected to u
this combo next year.
It won't come about, but I like to mull over the possibilities of such
foursome. Kerkorian and Mitchell for passing. Mitchell and White 112
blocking, and .... oh well, you go on from there.
Mitchell s replacement, as it looks now, will come in the person
either Bill DeYoung or Eric Southwood. Both give promise of becomii
good fullbacks. Neither approach Mitch at this stage of the game. A '
formation fullback must be fast and he must be able to block—but go<
It is helplul if he can pass as did Em.

fessional baseball contract. The Golden Boy is always pood for a laui

on the Farm when he did so. but it worked out well for him.

Ihe saddest are these: *It might have been!*
Emei y Mitchell will not play football next fall, either as a quarterbac
01 lull back. Ilis decision, and I think it is a very wise one, came aftc
the team doctors told him that if he injured his knee again it would b
doubtiul that he could walk without a limp. So he is going to lay out
year to let the leg fully heal. He may play in 1950, but I rather doubt it.
It is thus that we close the cover on a book that wo had only begun i
read. I personally feel that only the table of contents has been reveale<
We wei e given just a hint oi the story that was to come, and then th
book was closed and taken away.
And that story was a tale of great things to come. Mitchell, as Lloy
Merriman before him, gave promise of becoming an all-time Coast loot
ball great. Neither played more than a year for Stanford. Both wei
fullbacks and neither had the chance to show what he could do again:
California. Injuries took their toll in both cases.
Mitch is a competitor of the first grade. He is, or was, a footba
player's player. He was rough and tough. He liked the game. He It
the team in total yardage last year, though he played but seven game
He ranked 14th in the Conference with only seven games, compared to J
lor the other leaders.
He led the team in the times-carried-ball department when he was ii
jured in the opening minutes of the Army game. He amassed a total <
532 yards gained, 222 of these through passes. And he didn't throw
pass until the fourth game of the season.
So it is that Coach Marchmont Schwartz has lost the Coast's best ful
back in two out of the four years since the war. I said last year, and wi
repeat here, that if I had my choice between Mitchell and j. Jensen as
ballplayer, I would take Mitchell.
How would you like a combination of Gary Kerkorian, Holy Boruc
Bob White, and Mitchell in the 1949 Stanford backfield? But for oi
play in the Army game, Schwartz might well have expected to u
this combo next year.
It won't come about, but I like to mull over the possibilities of such
foursome. Kerkorian and Mitchell for passing. Mitchell and White 112
blocking, and .... oh well, you go on from there.
Mitchell s replacement, as it looks now, will come in the person
either Bill DeYoung or Eric Southwood. Both give promise of becomii
good fullbacks. Neither approach Mitch at this stage of the game. A '
formation fullback must be fast and he must be able to block—but go<
It is helplul if he can pass as did Em.
