# Farm Swimmers Eye PCC Title Host UCLA Bruins Saturday
## 
### 
Stanlord's once - defeated varsity
tankmen, still casting hopeful
glances at the PCC title despite the
recent loss of Ralph Sala, entertain
Brud Cleaveland's UCLA Bruins at
the Encina pools Saturday at 2:30 in
their semifinal dual meet of the sea
son.
The Westwooders are three-time
losers in this year's tank wars and
do not figure to seriously threaten
Tom Haynie's splash artists in more
than two or three of the afternoon's
events.
Jack Nelson is the Bruins' strong
est potential point-getter. Nelson,
the fastest 100-yard dashman in the
history of the southern school, could
possibly take top honors in that
event. He'll have to lick the Cards'
Harry Borchers and Woody Hoogs
to do it. though; and that's no easy
task.
Tuffli Is Tough
Breaststroker Gil Tuffli. another
all-time record breaker as far as
UCLA is concerned, stands an even
chance of winning his specialty from
Don Hester and Marsh Pearlman of

the Indians.
Even though Sala will be dr
docked for the 220 and 440 rac
the Stanford trio of John Mow;
Hub Stokely, and Bill Mil la
should have the situation prel
well in hand in those two events.
As usual for the locals, Jack a
Don Weeden will handle the bac
stroke chores, while Jim Bradsh;
will be on the board.
Jack Weeden, Pcarlman, a
Warren Cutting will do the hom
for the Indians in the curtain-ra
ing medley relap; but braintrusl
Tom Haynie will not pick his fou
man relay team until just befc
post-time. Haynie's entries in tl
event will depend upon the m<
score at race time.
Haynie Predicts
The Card mentor made his usi
pre-meet prediction of a Stanfc
victory; and there seems to be lit
chance of a Bruin upset Saturd;
Haynie also emphasized that
squad is definitely not out of t
picture for the pending PCC me
although Sala's arm injury 1.
weekend naturally has dimmed t
outlook.
''In any event." said Haynie. '*t
conference meet wil! be a two-te;
affair between Stanford and
The Trojans have most of the fir
sewed up. but we have more de(
and could win it on seconds a
thirds."
