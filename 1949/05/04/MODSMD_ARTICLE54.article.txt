# MYSTERIOUS LITTLE MAN POPS UP ALL OVER TOWN
## 
### 
* PALO ALTO. Mav 4—
Detectives can't explain the mys
tery of a little man dressed in
red, with lather all over his face,
who has been popping up in local
bathrooms while men are shav
ing. He hands the shaver a Pal
Hollow Ground Razor Blade, and
disappears. He does 110 harm; in
fact, the men report that Pal is
the best blade they've ever used;
Yesterday he showed up in this
office and left a note reading:
"Pal Hollow Ground is the slick
est, quickest blade going. They're
in all good stores — you still get
4 for lOC, 10 for 25<*, 21 for 49*,
44 for 98< 4 — Double or Single
Edge." Strange case isn't it?
