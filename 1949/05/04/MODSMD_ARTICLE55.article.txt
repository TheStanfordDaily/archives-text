# Trojans Favored to Win Pennant in Stretch Drive But Stanford Is Still in the Running
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Consensus of opinion has it that USC's baseball Trojans are
/o-to-one favorites to gallop through the stretch during the next
/o weeks and grab their second straight CIBA pennant.
At least that's the way it looks right now as Sam Barry's
.ssy champs lead the way into the final few games of the season.

Stanford, once rated a definite
on tender for the loop crown,
uftVred a severe setback last
weekend when UCLA's hot and
old Bruins turned up warm at
ie Sunken Diamond to romp off
.-itli their first series sweep in
ivto ry.
Other challengers for Troy's well
ting baseball crown have also
en staggering of late as Santa
tra and UCLA both blew games
■ t week to the cellar-dwelling St.
try's Gaels.

USC has jumped to the top of the

ir clouting.
dthough a few of the batsmen,

Cole picked up two hits against
UCLA last Saturday to perk up his
average to .30G.
But liitting isn't the big problem
confronting Harry Wolter. Instead,

more failures than successes.

tossed a few bad ones himself, Stan
