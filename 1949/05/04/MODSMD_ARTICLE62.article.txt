# Gay Bryan Elected Permanent Track Captain by Teammates
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Gay Bryan, Indian ironmun of the
cinderpaths, was elected 1949 team
captain by his fellow tracksters at
a pre-Big Meet meeting of the team
held yesterday.
Bryan, who is 22 years old and
hails from Orange, California, is
competing in his last year in track
for the Indians, although he has one
more year of eligibility in basketball.
Too much cannot be said for the
versatile Bryan, who has been a
great leader to the Card team all
season long.
In a short, inspiring message to
the team, alter being elected perma
nent captain, Bryan stated, "if
everyone gets out there next Sat
urday and does his best, I'm sure
we can bring home a victory over
Cal."
Five For Five
Bryan himself has another tre
mendous job to do this weekend,
and could conceivably win all five
of the events that he is entered in.
The big question seems to be
whether Donnie Anderson and Ro
land Maples, the two top California
sprinters, will be in good shape to
give Bryan a tough race in the Big
Meet at Berkeley next Saturday.
Anderson, who was credited with
a fast :09.6 in the century last year,
has been bothered all season with a
bad leg. Maples, who ran in the
Big Meet Relays in Stanford Sta
dium last Mar. 26, has been side
lined for quite some time.
Both of these boys will probably
run against Bryan in the 100 and
220. but whether they will be cap
able ot a top performance or not
remains to be seen.
Barnes To Be Missing
There will be no Jack Barnes to
force Gay Bryan to great heights in '
the high jump, although the Bears' !
Walt Briant is capable of 6 feet
3 inches.
In the broad jump, the Bears are i
a little stronger, but will have to be
hot to beat Bryan. Ben Corlett of ,
the Bears recently broke the Cal-
Michigan dual meet record when he
leaped 24 feet 4 n 4 inches. Jack !
Norberg of Cal also has jumped over [
24 feet.
The low hurdles probably will be j
the easiest for the ironman to win. j
even though it is the last of five '

events for Bryan. Cal has shown
wry little in this event all year,
letting both UCLA and USC sweep
the lows in their dual meets.
Sweep Is Passible
With Downing McKee, Dell Rus
sell, and Bob Bryan supporting Gay,
the Cards could also sweep the race.
The Cards will be seeking their
first Big Meet win since before th „•
war when they tangle with the Bear<
this SatuYday. One can rest assured
that Cal will not give up without
a tough fight.
A great idea, which was initiated
last year, that of running the frosh
and varsity events one right after
the ether, will also be continued this
year. This plan will not only give
everyone a chance to see the ma
terial coming up for next year's
varsities, but it will also provide
some thrilling races, as witnessed
last year in the Big Meet at Stan
ford Stadium.
Coach Ray Dean's frosh cinder
men, although then in most events,
hope to bring back the first little
Big Meet victory since 1941.
One of the greatest races of the
year is anticipated when John
Wooley of the Indians' frosh clashes
with Lew Olive oi the Bear year
lings in the mile event. Olive has
been consistently running in the
hiyh 4:2o's all season, while Wooley.
a great competitor, won the state
meet in 4:29 last year.


SHOWN AS HE compete in one of his five events Ls Gay Bryan. The
Gay lord s top mark of # feet 5 inches in the hijjh jump ranks him among
the 10 top jumpers in the nation. His 25-loot 4 :j 4- inch broad jump mark
is the best record in the nation this year.
