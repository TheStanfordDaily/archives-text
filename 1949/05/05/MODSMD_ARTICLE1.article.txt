# NSA Remains By Unanimous Excom Vote
## 
### 
Continued membership in the Na
tional Student Association was un
animously passed by Excom at last
night's meeting.
A motion was also made and
passed to delegate to the local NSA
the task of finding methods of for
mulating and representing student
opinion on national issues on which
the national NSA takes a stand.
Erskine Childers. regional NSA
chairman, stated that Stanford
should be represented at the re
gional convention on such issues as
academic freedom and federal aid to
education.
Excom felt, however, they were
not qualified to speak for the stu
dent body as a whole and that a
letter should be sent to the confer
ence stating that Stanford did not
wish to be quoted on these issues '
at this time.
Action Needed
Mark Hatfield, Excom represen- j
tative, stated that in voting for con
tinued membership in NSA, he feels |
that definite action should be taken j
to guarantee that the local chapter
will become an effective campus or
ganization.
Hatfield also pointed out that care
should be taken that opinions given
by NSA on the part of the students â– 
should not conflict with those al- I
ready given by the administration, j
such as Dr. Sterling's views on aca- ;
demic freedom.
Excom also approved the report j
of the Housing Committee, but
made one change as to the ratio of
freshmen getting into University j
dormitories.
Under the new system, all mem
bers of the class of 1952, now living
at the Village, would automatically j
get a place in either Stern or Toyon
before any Encina frosh were al- j
lotted rooms.
Number Limited
The number of Encina freshmen
getting into Stern and Toyon would j
depend on the total number of va
cancies in the buildings. Under the
housing report, all frosh combined '
would get 25 per cent of the free I
rooms.
Fifty-five per cent of the vacan- j
cies will go to Village and off-cam- I
pus students, and 20 per cent to the I
eating clubs.
John Pool gave a brief report of |
his trip to Yale to study the vari
type method of printing.
"I still feel that it is a great idea j
in principle," he said, "but Yale is !
having a rough time with admin
istration. My enthusiasm is tem- <
pered after seeing the trouble Yale
is having."
"The main problem is whether or
not the ASSU will go into the print
ing business as a sideline," he con- j
tinued.
