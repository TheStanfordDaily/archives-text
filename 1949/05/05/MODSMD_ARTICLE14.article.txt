# Dr. Rathbun Leads Religious Session
## 
### 
Dr. Harry J. Kathbun, member of
the Law School faculty, led a group
discussion on "The Critical Study
of Jesus" at the Village Clubhouse
last Thursday evening.
The group, consisting of 25 people
of various religious backgrounds,
generally agreed that the purpose
of most religions is the attainment
of the best possible adjustment ol
man to his universe.
Dr. Rathbun advanced the theory
that even science observed the
principle that there is order to the
universe. "This," he stated, "shows
the basic humility of men of sci
ence."
