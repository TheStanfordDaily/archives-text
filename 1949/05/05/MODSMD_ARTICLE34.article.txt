## Honor' by Proctoring 
### 
Every time a non-Stanford student describes the proctoring
system in his school we can't help crowing about our Honor
Code. During spring vacation a former Stanford student de
scribed to us examination conditions at his school.
"I can't concentrate when I take a test because students all
around me ask each other guestions about the test when the
proctors are not looking. If you're caught talking during a test,
howevei, it is an automatic flunk in the exam.
"The proctor system is worse than a high school system.
They (the proctors) assume that everyone is going to try to cheat.
In fact, some of the students talk among themselves about cheat
ing. I can hardly stand the environment and now wish I were
back in Stanford. I'd give anything for that honor system.
"When an examination in one of my classes is scheduled,
students occupy the back seats first because they can get away
with copying their notes easier."
