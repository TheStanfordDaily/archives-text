## Fundamental Building Issue 
### 
To the Editor:
Your Architecture Questionnaire is an excellent idea and certainly a
timely one. As far as the roof question itself is concerned, the major issues
involved should be not whether flat roofs are consistent with the present
conglomerate architecture, but whether the modern style enables the
University to house more students under the best of living conditions at
the lowest feasible cost. After all, a university is primarily an educational
institution, not a city park.
