# Alumni Version of Building History
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Like many another alum, I got completely confused by all this Farm
Buildngi Style stuff in the Review, and quietly went back to my own
readings of the beginning of Stanford, written at the time the first build
ing was done, and my own memories. Now you have it in The Daily. In
case you'd like that highly simple alumni version, heer it is:
The original Quad buildings were designed by a man named Coolidge.
He had been an associate of Richardson's in Boston, but Richardson died
before the Quad was designed. Coolidge, according to contemporary (his)
accounts, visited the California Missions, and drew his inspiration and
plans from them. The Quad is thus "California-Spanish" from the very
beginning. The later buildings adopted the Spanish-California spirit to
their own needs.
Tilings like Woodpecker Lodge (the old Women's Gym) and the Fire
house just rose up because they were needed quick and their "style" was
cheap and appropriate. The Anatomy and Bacty buildings were part of
the Museum connected by arcades that fell down in the earthquake.
I don't know what "transitional" is except a wastebasket-word. All the
buildings put under it managed to be "functional" (appropriate to their
purpose?) and yet keep the family look in color, roofing, grace, light and
shadow, airiness, and a peaceful harmony with the rest of the lovely
picture which is your inheritance. Too bad if those unique qualities arc
transitory.
If anybody younger and brighter can tell me what this sentence means,
"The strongest thread connecting the newest building undertaken with
the earliest one completed is, of course, the human use for which they
were intended," I would be grateful. Doesn't it, as said, cover our Quon
sets of Temporary Buildings?
Most alumni I know do not consider Stern Hall "unobtrusively inci
dental," whether they are Flat-tops or Tile-tops. Nor do they feel
Crothers Hall is "astentatiously costly" because of its lovely warm glowing
roof-harmony with the rest of the campus. So, you all think what you like.
