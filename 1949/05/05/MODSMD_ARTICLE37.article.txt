# Demos Work On 50 Plans

### CARL F. STOVER 
' Objective 1950" was the keynote
which guided California's Young
Democrats in a three-day confer
ence at Fresno last weekend.
Sponsored by the Young Demo
crats of Fresno County, the con
ference adopted a program which
made unity, cooperation and victory
the primary goals of "Young De
mocracy" in California.
The Fresno Conference climaxed
a year's efforts on the part of the
state's clubs to remove the control
of the Young Democrats' charter
from the hands of the present con
servative group of state officers.
Charges against this group in
cluded failure to provide charters
for qualifying organizations, active
opposition to the State and Na
tional Democratic Party platforms,
and neglect of constitutional duties.
A steering committee was elected
by the conference to negotiate with
the present officers in procuring the
immediate chartering of all quali

fying clubs and in calling an official
convention for the summer.
An additional purpose of the con
ference was the preparation of the
group for positive action in 1950.
Panels and discussions were held
on "Precinct Work," "Agriculture
and Labor," the ever-present prob
lem of "Money and Work," and ob
taining "Representative Participa
tion in Young Democratic Clubs."
The conference pledged its sup
port to President Truman's "Fair-
Deal" program and to the imple
mentation of the National and State
Democratic platforms.
Measures specifically emphasized
included the establishment of a
Fair Employment Practices Com
mission. the elimination of segrega
tion and discrimination in the Cali
fornia National Guard, the continu
ance of child-care centers, a mini
mum wage of 75 cents, and the pro
hibition of discrimination in the un
derwriting oi automobile insurance.
