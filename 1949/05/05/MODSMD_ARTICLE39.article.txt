POETS OF THE PACIFIC, edited l>>
Yvor Winters (Stanford Univer
sity Press)
It was a most encouraging expe
rience to read the second series of
POETS OF THE PACIFIC, recently
published. The book, a compilation
of the better poetry produced by
Stanford students and alumnae,
promises, if nothing else, that the
art of composing real poetry should
be admirably continued by the 12
young men and women whose work
is published in this book.
Only one poet of the 12 even par
tially resorted to the use of blank
verse to convey her impressions and
thoughts. Probably the most tech
nically perfect poem, in my personal
opinion, was a sonnet by Melanie
Hyman, a Stanford undergraduate
who shows great promise as a
poetess.
The other Stanford students rep
resented in this volume are, Rich
ard Arnold, Edgar Bowers, Colgate
Dorr, and Wesley Trimpi. Of these,
Colgate Dorr's work should deserve
particular attention.
In compiling this series. Dr. Win
ters has given the contributing poets
freedom of choice in the poetry they
presented, often allowing the inclu
sion of a work which Dr. Winters,
personally, was not in sympathy.
The result has been encouraging.
By allowing the young poets to pre
sent what they felt was their best
poetry, the editor has given the
reader the advantage of seeing,
somewhat, the young artists' own
conception of poetic subject matter
and style.
Of the two books of student writ
ing, this, and the recently published
STANFORD SHORT ' STORIES,
POETS OF THE PACIFIC, pre
sents a wider variety of style, and
a much greater degree of origin
ality. One does not receive the im
pression that any particular de
mands have been made upon the
writers' style.
This is. unfortunately, not true in
the case of STANFORD SHORT
STORIES. While the subject mat
ter is original and varied, the style
of writing is almost monotonously
similar.
Dr. Winters has apparently en
couraged and very successfully pre
pared the young poets in writing
poetry; he has quite obviously re
frained from imposing his own per
sonal style upon his students. And
POETS OF THE PACIFIC is a bet
ter book, because of this restrained
guidance.
