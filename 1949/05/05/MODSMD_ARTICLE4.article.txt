# Alpha Sig Pledges Steal Front Door
## 
### 
Nine noisy Alpha Sigha Phi j
pledges raided their fraternity house
at 534 Salvatierra Street early yes- !
terday morning, making off with
the front door, a tube from the
living room radio, and the dinner.
gong.
And they might have gotten away J
with more if the freshmen hadn't
created such a clamor while tying I
one of the upstairs doors to lock it
from the outside.
Fortunately for the actives, a j
brother who was sleeping in the j
room awoke and spread the alarm, i
Nine pledges suddenly became very I
noisy aj they took off for the near- J
est exit.
After removing the heavy front
door, their first operation upon
sneaking into the house, the pledges
stealthily inserted in its place an
ancient outhouse door. Hastily in- ;
scribed on the face of the boards 1
were the words:
''The Alpha Sig actives we do ab
hor; therefore we leave them this ;
brand new door. (Signed) The
3oys."
Glowering with vengeance, the ;
brothers reported late last night
that five of the miscreants are under
?'ose surveillance. Their only com
ment: "The loot must be returned." ;
At last word, however, the five
have steadfastly refused to give out I
any information.
Alpha Sigs announce that; they
now have an open house! Pledges
nromise there will be a door prize j
for the actives Saturday morning.
