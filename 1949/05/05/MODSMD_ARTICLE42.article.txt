# Caucuses, Rallies Mark Farm Election History

### CHUCK SCARLOTT 
Next Wednesday, Stanford men
and women will cast their votes
for the final selection of principal
student body leaders for the coming
year. It will be the 58th time Stan
ford students have exercised the
privilege.
Have you ever wondered what
sort of a history lay behind you as
you drop your ballot into one of
the many boxes scattered about the
campus? It is a colorful one, in
creasingly marked by eruptions of
ASSU's once serene political land
scape.
Before the turn of the century
plenty of time was found on one day
each April from 11:30 a.m. to 2
p.m. to elect campus officers from
a list of candidates nominated at an
all-campus meeting in the Chapel
a few days previously.
In those days, the ASSU con
trolled the Daily Palo Alto (now the
Stanford Daily), the Sequoia, and
managers of the major sports. Va
cancies in these places were filled
by vote of the entire student body.
Electioneering was minimized.
Student self-government, as yet in
its infancy, was not very vocal by
modern standards. Formal speeches
by presidential candidates before a
gathering of students at all-campus
assemblies were unknown until
1937.
As enrollment increased and of
fices became more numerous, the
nominating system was formalized
by the requirement of written nom
inations signed by eight. Since 1915,
15 names have been required.
Among the first of the all-campus
controversies to be settled by stu
dent vote was continuance of the
Big-Game bonfire. Opposition to
the bonfire reached a peak in 1929,
but was decisively squelched that
year by popular vote. 1 ,
As years merged into decades and
decades into more than half a cen
tury. the ballot has kept pace with
the steadily rising enrollment. In
1931, only one name, Bob Brown,
was put un for ASSU president. By
contrast, the number of candidates
reached an all-time high last year
and this year, when, in the primary,
the voter found 11 candidates for
president.
The preferential voting method,
which had been in operation for sev
eral years following displacement of
the original plurality system, was
put to the test of a general vote
in 1935 and upheld, although only
10 per cent of the student body
voted.
The greatest innovation of recent
years came in 1945, when Excom
representation was switched from a
class to a living group basis.
Political maneuvering, previously
limited to isolated cases, burst forth
in full bloom on the campus in
1934. That year marked tho begin
ning of a split between How and

Hall men that was to remain the
basis of Stanford politics until the
war swept such matters from the
college scene.
During those eight years student
democracy was a prey of the cau
cus system. Each spring Row and
Hall men held mass meetings to
determine a slate of candidates
deemed most assured of victory over
their opponents.
On the whole, fraternities had the
better time of it, electing the presi
dent and a majority of officers in
every year but 1934 and 1941—the
first and last years of the cleavage.
In 1942 the time lapse between
nomination and election was short
ened to one day in an effort to dis
courage "deals," and the halls fol
lowed the example of the Row in
throwing over the caucus.
The war curtailed the activities
of student government and led to
the setting aside in '43 of the regu
lar constitution and the temporary
substitution of rule by Excom. The
election rules drawn up by that
body for the first time permitted
women to run for ASSU president.
Endorsement of the new provision
was promptly rendered by the stu
dent body when Janet McClanahan
was elected first woman president.
The experiment was repeated the
next year. In 1944, for the first and
only time in history, women out
numbered men on the Farm.
As the nation returned to "nor
mal," increased competition for of
fices in 1947 brought about the
adoption of a primary election to
ease the burden on the preferential
system, which functioned very
poorly when applied to more than
four candidates per office. That year,
the ISC (Internation Survey Com
mittee) held the political spotlight
drawing major campaign statements
from presidential nominees.
Last year's elections will be re
membered for the colorful eam
pagining of Frank Wolff on a plat
form pledging faith in the common
man. Wolff was defeated by Cha
valas on a second re-chcck of the
third preferential count, 2,1(H) to
2,155, after leading by 500 votes in
the first two counts. This effect of
the preferential system was thor
oughly disillusioning to some,
equally reassuring to others. Un
questionably encouraging was the
record turnout of 58 per cent of the
student body to vote.

Big-Game bonfire. Opposition to
the bonfire reached a peak in 1929,
but was decisively squelched that
year by popular vote. 1 ,
As years merged into decades and
decades into more than half a cen
tury. the ballot has kept pace with
the steadily rising enrollment. In
1931, only one name, Bob Brown,
was put un for ASSU president. By
contrast, the number of candidates
reached an all-time high last year
and this year, when, in the primary,
the voter found 11 candidates for
president.
The preferential voting method,
which had been in operation for sev
eral years following displacement of
the original plurality system, was
put to the test of a general vote
in 1935 and upheld, although only
10 per cent of the student body
voted.
The greatest innovation of recent
years came in 1945, when Excom
representation was switched from a
class to a living group basis.
Political maneuvering, previously
limited to isolated cases, burst forth
in full bloom on the campus in
1934. That year marked tho begin
ning of a split between How and

Hall men that was to remain the
basis of Stanford politics until the
war swept such matters from the
college scene.
During those eight years student
democracy was a prey of the cau
cus system. Each spring Row and
Hall men held mass meetings to
determine a slate of candidates
deemed most assured of victory over
their opponents.
On the whole, fraternities had the
better time of it, electing the presi
dent and a majority of officers in
every year but 1934 and 1941—the
first and last years of the cleavage.
In 1942 the time lapse between
nomination and election was short
ened to one day in an effort to dis
courage "deals," and the halls fol
lowed the example of the Row in
throwing over the caucus.
The war curtailed the activities
of student government and led to
the setting aside in '43 of the regu
lar constitution and the temporary
substitution of rule by Excom. The
election rules drawn up by that
body for the first time permitted
women to run for ASSU president.
Endorsement of the new provision
was promptly rendered by the stu
dent body when Janet McClanahan
was elected first woman president.
The experiment was repeated the
next year. In 1944, for the first and
only time in history, women out
numbered men on the Farm.
As the nation returned to "nor
mal," increased competition for of
fices in 1947 brought about the
adoption of a primary election to
ease the burden on the preferential
system, which functioned very
poorly when applied to more than
four candidates per office. That year,
the ISC (Internation Survey Com
mittee) held the political spotlight
drawing major campaign statements
from presidential nominees.
Last year's elections will be re
membered for the colorful eam
pagining of Frank Wolff on a plat
form pledging faith in the common
man. Wolff was defeated by Cha
valas on a second re-chcck of the
third preferential count, 2,1(H) to
2,155, after leading by 500 votes in
the first two counts. This effect of
the preferential system was thor
oughly disillusioning to some,
equally reassuring to others. Un
questionably encouraging was the
record turnout of 58 per cent of the
student body to vote.
Next Wednesday, Stanford men
and women will cast their votes
for the final selection of principal
student body leaders for the coming
year. It will be the 58th time Stan

Have you ever wondered what
sort of a history lay behind you as
you drop your ballot into one of
the many boxes scattered about the
campus? It is a colorful one, in
creasingly marked by eruptions of
ASSU's once serene political land
scape.
Before the turn of the century
plenty of time was found on one day
each April from 11:30 a.m. to 2
p.m. to elect campus officers from
a list of candidates nominated at an
all-campus meeting in the Chapel
a few days previously.
In those days, the ASSU con
trolled the Daily Palo Alto (now the
Stanford Daily), the Sequoia, and
managers of the major sports. Va
cancies in these places were filled
by vote of the entire student body.
Electioneering was minimized.
Student self-government, as yet in
its infancy, was not very vocal by
modern standards. Formal speeches
by presidential candidates before a
gathering of students at all-campus
assemblies were unknown until
1937.
As enrollment increased and of
fices became more numerous, the
nominating system was formalized
by the requirement of written nom
inations signed by eight. Since 1915,
15 names have been required.

every year but 1934 and 1941—the
first and last years of the cleavage.
In 1942 the time lapse between
nomination and election was short
ened to one day in an effort to dis
courage "deals," and the halls fol
lowed the example of the Row in
throwing over the caucus.
The war curtailed the activities
of student government and led to
the setting aside in '43 of the regu
lar constitution and the temporary
substitution of rule by Excom. The
election rules drawn up by that
body for the first time permitted
women to run for ASSU president.
Endorsement of the new provision
was promptly rendered by the stu
dent body when Janet McClanahan
was elected first woman president.
The experiment was repeated the
next year. In 1944, for the first and
only time in history, women out
numbered men on the Farm.
As the nation returned to "nor
mal," increased competition for of
fices in 1947 brought about the
adoption of a primary election to
ease the burden on the preferential
system, which functioned very
poorly when applied to more than
four candidates per office. That year,
the ISC (Internation Survey Com
mittee) held the political spotlight
drawing major campaign statements
from presidential nominees.
Last year's elections will be re
membered for the colorful eam
pagining of Frank Wolff on a plat
form pledging faith in the common
man. Wolff was defeated by Cha
valas on a second re-chcck of the
third preferential count, 2,1(H) to
2,155, after leading by 500 votes in
the first two counts. This effect of
the preferential system was thor
oughly disillusioning to some,
equally reassuring to others. Un
questionably encouraging was the
record turnout of 58 per cent of the
student body to vote.
Next Wednesday, Stanford men
and women will cast their votes
for the final selection of principal
student body leaders for the coming
year. It will be the 58th time Stan
ford students have exercised the
privilege.
Have you ever wondered what
sort of a history lay behind you as
you drop your ballot into one of
the many boxes scattered about the
campus? It is a colorful one, in
creasingly marked by eruptions of
ASSU's once serene political land
scape.
Before the turn of the century
plenty of time was found on one day
each April from 11:30 a.m. to 2
p.m. to elect campus officers from
a list of candidates nominated at an
all-campus meeting in the Chapel
a few days previously.
In those days, the ASSU con
trolled the Daily Palo Alto (now the
Stanford Daily), the Sequoia, and
managers of the major sports. Va
cancies in these places were filled
by vote of the entire student body.
Electioneering was minimized.
Student self-government, as yet in
its infancy, was not very vocal by
modern standards. Formal speeches
by presidential candidates before a
gathering of students at all-campus
assemblies were unknown until
1937.
As enrollment increased and of
fices became more numerous, the
nominating system was formalized
by the requirement of written nom
inations signed by eight. Since 1915,
15 names have been required.
Among the first of the all-campus
controversies to be settled by stu
dent vote was continuance of the
Big-Game bonfire. Opposition to
the bonfire reached a peak in 1929,
but was decisively squelched that
year by popular vote. 1 ,
As years merged into decades and
decades into more than half a cen
tury. the ballot has kept pace with
the steadily rising enrollment. In
1931, only one name, Bob Brown,
was put un for ASSU president. By
contrast, the number of candidates
reached an all-time high last year
and this year, when, in the primary,
the voter found 11 candidates for
president.
The preferential voting method,
which had been in operation for sev
eral years following displacement of
the original plurality system, was
put to the test of a general vote
in 1935 and upheld, although only
10 per cent of the student body
voted.
The greatest innovation of recent
years came in 1945, when Excom
representation was switched from a
class to a living group basis.
Political maneuvering, previously
limited to isolated cases, burst forth
in full bloom on the campus in
1934. That year marked tho begin
ning of a split between How and

Hall men that was to remain the
basis of Stanford politics until the
war swept such matters from the
college scene.
During those eight years student
democracy was a prey of the cau
cus system. Each spring Row and
Hall men held mass meetings to
determine a slate of candidates
deemed most assured of victory over
their opponents.
On the whole, fraternities had the
better time of it, electing the presi
dent and a majority of officers in
every year but 1934 and 1941—the
first and last years of the cleavage.
