There IS going to be a Water
Carnivalâ€”for *'.ic past month junior
class exco.n members have been
muttering this phrase in defiance
of tbj dropping lake.
T .n order tfr check on the water
seepage, Mort White, class presi
dent. surveyed the bottom of the
lake in a home-made diving hel
met. He reported that he found the
Jake bottom muddy and damp, but
with sufficient water for holding the
carnival events.
"Even the lake is co-operating to
make the carnival a success," White
said. I lis words reassured dubious
juniors who had been working on
a subversive campaign to have ev
eryone "spit in the lake for the
juniors' sake."
"If all else failed, we had planned
to seat the audience in bleachers in
the middle of the lake to raise the
water level," Diane Porter, co
chairman, said. "However, this is
no longer necessary and the Carni
val will take place as originally
scheduled at 1:30 Saturday after
noon."
The float parade on "The History
of Water Transportation will begin
the Carnival. Float entries must be
finished and at the lake by noon
Saturday. Work on the floats may

be done on the shore at the left of
the boathouse.
Prizes will be awarded to the
best all-around floats, to the win
ners of the various men's and wom
en's events, and to the living group
with the highest score. The order
of the floats will be announced to
morrow.
Judges are Shelton Beatty, Men's
Counselor; Donald Winbigler. Reg
istrar; and Bob Anderson, swim
ming star.
Living groups must turn in the
event sheets by 2:30 tomorrow in
the ballot box at the Post Office if
they desire to participate in the
events planned.


MORT WHITE, Junior Class president, submerges
to the bottom of Lag to investigate the condi
tion of the lake for the Water Carnival Saturday.

He reported the lake hed as being "muddy but
damp."
