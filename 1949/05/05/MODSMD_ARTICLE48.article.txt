# Indians, Bears Set Stage for Fifty-fourth Big Meet; Last Victory Was in 1940
## 
### JOHN HALL 
It's been nine sad years since
Stanford last turned back a
Golden Bear track squad, but
Saturday in the 54th Big Meet,
hings should be different.
At long last, the Cards look ready,
'.•rilling, and able to ruin the gal
loping Bear.
Stanford s hist victory over Cali
fornia was in 1940 when the
Cards romped to an 80' '•> to
Big Meet win.
Those were the days when Clyde
Jeffrey was being called the world's
astest human, and Paul Moore was
<;ing of the Coast's milers.
Tliat was also the year that the
Card mile relay team licked every
one in sight and later set a world
record at 3:12.9.
Bears Win Six Straight
But since 1940, Cal has come
forth with a consistent array of
talent, such as Graver Klemmer,
Guinn Smith, and Hal Davis, and
those men rave had all their own
way in leading the Bears to six
straight successes.
Six straight for the Bears puts
them in a position to tie up the Big
Meet series, as a Berkeley win make

it a 2(5-26 deadlock in the 54-meet
1 relationship. Two meets have ended
| in ties.
A statistical glimpse at past rec-
I ords shows that Stanford owns the
| widest and closest victory margins.
In 1031, the Indians thundered past
Cal, 101 1/5 to 29 4/5.
i Before that in 1913, Stanford
squeezed past the Bears til 1/5 to
G0 4 / 5.
Meet Records in Danger
Outsanding Big Meet records in
clude Clyde Jeffrey's 20.8 in the 220,
Jack Weiershauser's 23.2 in the low
hurdles, and Cal's Dick Peters' 4:11.5
| in the mile.
Several other records will go to
the chopping block Saturday, as
five Stanford men have come up
in a position to do some damage.
Downing McKee, who hit 14.4 in
the highs against USC last week,
, could well eclipse the present 14.4
! record, set by Indian Darrel Kreitz
j iust last season.
Strong-armed Bud Held needs
I only a good day to erase Martin
' Bile's 1941 javelin standard of 222
feet 10 inches. Held has tossed the
j spear over 231 already this season.
I Both Otis Chandler and Lew Davis
I seem sure to break the shot mark.

held by Stanford's John Lyman at
54 loot 1 inch since 1934. Chandler
and Davis have consistently flipped
the 16 pounds over this distance.
Anyway, Saturday is the day. It's
the 54th running of the Stanford-
California Big Meet.
