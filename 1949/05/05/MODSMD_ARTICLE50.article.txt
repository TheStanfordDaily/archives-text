Spring weather and green foot
hills bring out the rustic nature
of Farm Dwellers. Idyllic peas
ants appear everywhere. The
farmerettes may lack the old
milk bucket and the telltale hay,
but proper costumes they do
have.
Their skirts are full and of
either pleated or gathered cot
ton. They are light or dark, cal
ico prints or stripes, flowered
prints or plain colors. They are
featured at the Clothes Closet,
well priced from $4.95 to $12.95.
In their choice of blouse the
peasants seek still wider variety.
The blouse may be simple and
fitted, with a boat neckline and
tiny puffed sleeves, in plain col
ored cotton. It may be full, with
loose sleeves and a square neck
trimmed in lots of fine lace. Our
farmerette may prefer a white
blouse with either a draw string
neck or an elastic neck that can
be pulled off the shoulders. She
may prefer eyelet or batiste
trimmed with simple hemstitch
ing or cotton trimmed in eyelet
and lace. Whatever she wants,
she knows the Clothes Closet has
it at the wonderful price of from
53.95 to $4.95.
For those special times when
the day says "cotton" and the
occasion says "hat," our maid
chooses an adjustable, white,
crownless bonnet in linen-finish
cotton which prettily shades the
eyes and frames the face, $2.95.
Where will she find it? The
Clothes Closet, of course! Why
don't you pay us a visit today
. . . we're at 520 Ramona just
off University.
