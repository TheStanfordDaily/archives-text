Stanford's Track Team
This Saturday one of the best track teams in Stanford history will he
making the big parade to Berkeley. They are a team that was hurt and
stung by then first defeat of the season last week. This column is not
going to discuss the questionable tactics or the whats and wherefores
of that meet. I don't think that the better team won. but to say more
than that would sound like crying. But I was too close to crying last
Satuiday to want to try it again. That meet is over. We lost it. O.K.
This week we meet California, and this week we will not lose.
All of which brings us to my special, gold-plated predictions of the
Big Meet.
Fist ot all, I think that Gay Bryan will make 25 points against the Bears.
Bryan, it becomes more and more apparent, is one of the finest athletes
in Stanford, Conference, or track history. Cal will make an all-out effort
to keep him from making the sweep, but Bryan is too great a com
petitor to be stopped by what Cal has to offer.
My second prediction is that Al Lyons, who put in one of the greatest
efforts of the USC meet by cutting two seconds off his best mile' time
to win, will pull the top come-through effort of the year and beat Cali
fornia's vaunted Kaare Veiling in the mile. Lyons will stay within five
yards of Vefling the whole way—including Veiling's murderous third lap
—and when the showdown comes in the last 100 yards, I think Lyons
will have enough heart and guts to out-kick the Bear miler to the tape.
California's Football Team
A week or so ago a series of articles by Mr. Bill Leiser. who wrote his
last great sports article immediately after the 1947 Big Game, appeared
in the San Francisco Chronicle (also a morning newspaper). In these
articles, Mr. Leiser tabbed California (the U of)—with the grace of
friendly gods and Jackie Jensen—to go to the Rose Bowl next year. I
would, at this time, like to disagree with Mr. Leiser, who I think is one
of the Coast's top football experts—in spite of his picking Nevada as the
best team on the Coast last October.
There aren't very many good men from last year's Rose Bowl team
returning to Berkeley next season. Cal's best end. Van Deren. both of
their first string tackles, Frasctto and Turner, and their best lineman,
guard Jon Baker (now with the LA Rams) will be among those absent
when comes kick-off time for the 51st Big Game. And now that Eriekson
is being graduated, just who is going to play quarterback for the touted
Golden Bears? They won't be getting a great deal of help from their
frosh, il the 30-0 Stanford Freshman game of last year is any indication,
from where I sit on the bench, the best three quarterback prospects at
Cal are Oskic, Pappy and Boh Celeri—in that order.
With these men gone, and the replacement department being short of
supplies, I don t see how even the fabulous Golden Boy can win many
ball games for Cal next autumn.
And what about Golden Boy? I think that by now it is pretty well
established (the "Chron" printed it yesteday, the LA Times a week ago
yesterday) that Jackie Jensen, who—incidentally—has never set foot in
a Stanford end zone, will likewise be watching the 51st Big Game from
a crowded seat in the rooting section. Jensen has been publicly in loco for
some time, and has been semi-publicly offered some very cushy pro
baseball offers to play this summer. The romance, the baseball, and a
very natural urge to quit while he's winning, add up to a good argu
ment why he and Zoe Ann should be well on the way toward raising a
tribe of blond super-athletes by next fell—with the friendly support of
the professional horsehide people.
The Bears, moreover, do not have a set-up schedule like they have
had the last two years. Among their rivals next year will be Santa Clara,
UCLA. Oregon, USC. Washington, and Stanford. I may be selling the
Blue and Golders short, but I don't think that California—with or without'
Jackie Jensen—will beat any of these teams.
The conference will be too strong next year, and California with their
22,000 students, and with either Jensen or his very snappy replacement,
Pete Schabarum, will not be strong enough.
Nobody's Crewmen
Carrying the Stanford colors, a bunch of hard-working crewmen will
put on their big show Saturday, in an effort to beat Cal's Olympic cham
pionship crew. They've got no business winning. The Cal crew is very
good. Everybody knows this fact, except the fellows in the red rowing
jackets, who will be out after a Poughkeepsie invitation, a touch of glory
for themselves, and a large, buch-needed boost to Stanford athletics.
But they think that they are going to win, and any Stanford team with
that idea in mind can be pretty dangerous—even to Olympic champions.
Good luck, crew.
