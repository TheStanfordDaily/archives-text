# Relay Quartet To Try Comeback Saturday
## Could Break 3:14 Against Bears Bly, Andrews, Johnson, and Hoff Best Relay Combination Since Pre-War Days 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Boasting the best mile relay team
since before the war. four Indian
stalwarts, Cass Bly, Rupe Andrews,
Pitch Johnson, and Larry HolY, may
go through the rest of the 1949 sea
son undefeated.
't he mile relay team will be high
ly favored to romp over the Bear
team in the Big Meet at Berkeley
this Saturday. The Cards have al
ready scored a decisive win over
the Bears in the Cal-Stanford Re
lays last March 215.
However, in the following weeks
the going may get tougher. The
Indian four-man team will get sev
eral cracks at the Trojan combo,
who edged the locals by a slim
margin last Saturday in the good
time of 3:15.7.
Revenge at Fresno
The first chance for sweet re
venge will be in the colorful Fresno
Relays, which will be held at spa
cious Radcliff Stadium in Tresno on

May 14, the Saturday after the Cal
meet.
Then come the equally good Col
iseum Relays in Los Angeles on the
following Friday night. May 20. The
"hometown" boys will be all out for
a big Trojan win, but Stanford has
the goods to upset the Troy apple
cart here again.
Since there are no relays in the
NCAA. Stanford's last relay contest
with the Trojans will be in the PCC
meet in Seatt'e. There is great re
lay rivalry ahead, but the Cards
are aiming for the top.
Individually, the Stanford team
is tops. If every man ran his best
race on the same day, the team
could run 3:12.6. This is three
tenths of a second below the Big
Meet record of 3:12.9. set by the
Stantord team of Charles Shaw,
Ernie Clark. Craig Williamson, and
Clyde Jeffrey in 1940.
Bly Adds Spark
Cass Bly. the sophomore flash.

ran an unofficial 48.1 lap against the
Trojans last week. B'.y has given j
the team an added spark this year, I
and has possibilities of becoming a
really great runner.
Rupe Andrews has the fine com
petitive spirit that carries him to
great heights, as witnessed last
week against Troy. Rupe could eas
ily be pushed to a 48.5 lap in the
relay.
Pitch Johnson, although rot at
his best last weekend, is capable of
a 48.3 relay lap. Johnson nearly
won the quarter mile at UCLA, and
his time was an unofficial 48.5. He!
also ran an excellent relay lap down
on the Westwood oval.
Last, but not least, is veteran
Larry Hoff. HofT ran a sensational
47.7 last year behind Herb Mc-
Kenley at the same Edwards Field.
He could do it again. Add the four
times together, and the result is a
mildly colossal 3:12.6.
It could be done!
