Everett Dean's big, vaunted frosh
baseball team took on some poor
little fuzzy-cheeked boys from Lin
coln High of San Jose and the re
sults were not startling; the year
lings buried "the nine young men"
so deep that at the end of six in
nings the score was 15-0 and the I
coaches decided to call the game.
Stanford's sluggers started right
off in the first frame with four runs !
to lock up the content. They man- j
aged to cross the plate in £very in
ning thereafter except the third.
(The game was scheduled for seven
innings.)
The Card extra-base clouting was <
highlighted by two home runs and j
a triple against Lincoln's hapless
mound corps. Hal! Skillman's four- ,
master was an infield hopper which '
no Lincolnite could touch until Hal '
had rounded the bases.
