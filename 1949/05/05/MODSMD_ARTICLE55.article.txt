# Spring Grid Nears Climax
## 
### 
With but six days of practice re
maining before their Big Spring
Game, the Stanford footba'l team is
putting finishing touches on what
has been termed "a very successful
season" by coaches and onJookers
alike.
The gridders will forego their
usual Saturday morning scrimmage
this week in order that they may
get in four practices next week be
fore the intra-sqxiad game. That
tilt will be held in the Stadium on
Friday, May 13, and will be the
thirtieth day of practice.
Coach March ie Schwartz gave
"ease up" orders yesterday after
Tuesday's rough, hour-long scrim
mage. The squad worked on new
passing patterns and ran dummy
signal drills.
Earlier in the week the coaching
stafl was concerned over the con
dition of tackle Gordon White, who
had been sidelined the vÂ»eek before
with a back injury.
But latest reports have it that the
big mainstay of the 1948 line will
be back in uniform next week in
time to participate in the final game.
Meanwhile the tackle ranks took
on a new man in the person of Hal
Walker, who played on the junior
varsity last year. The big fellow
filled in for Gordy White last week
and the coaching staff was pleased
with his work.
Freshman Dick Lucas has also
been elevated to varsity rank. He
did not play football last fall but
turned out for the frosh football
squad instead.
