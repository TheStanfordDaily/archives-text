Joseph H. Axelrod. 31. was one oii
the lirst New Knglanders to luve a
telephone in his automobile. 1 le needed
it. As boss of six textile mills in four
cities in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, plump, hustling Joe Axelrod
made the rounds every day.and he
liked to keep in touch. Last week, Joe

Axelrod added a litth city (Provi
dence ) to his tour, a seventh plant
(the Damar Wool Combing Co.) to
his holdings. Even for a young man
who likes to keep moving. Axelrod had
moved far. In i)}_• years he had par
layed $5,500 into an integrated textile
empire worth Si 6 million.
Joe started to work in 1935. when
he was just out of the University o;
Pennsylvania. To his S5OO savings, his
father. James, a textile jobber, added
55.000. With the money, they formed
Airedale Worsted Mills. Inc. with Joe
as president, 'l'hev rented a loft in a
Woonsocket (R. 1.) mill, bought some
secondhand machinery, hired two
workers and started weaving worsted
fabrics.
The Team. Joe made the goods: hi<
father sold them. Selling was no trick
when war came; the trick was produc
tion. Joe turned it by picking up the
newest textile machines, applying th
newest techniques, and plowing all
profits back into more plants. Joe's
aim was integration—enough plants to
handle wool virtually from the sheep's
back to finished cloth. In it) - Aire
dale Worsted Mills. Inc. was health\
enough to take over Woonsocket
Bernon. In the next three years the
Axelrods wove the Jeffrey Finishing
Co., Woonsocket's Lippitt Worsted
Mills and Dorlexa Dyeing & Finish
ing Co. and I'awt ticket's Crown
Manufacturing Co. into their em
pire. Last spring they got control of
New Bedford's old, tamed V'amsiitta
Mills (sheetings broadcloth-, spe
cially fabrics). Joe and his dad. who
is treasurer, now have 3.150 men &
women (including Wamsutta > work
ing for them, and with last week's
buy, they reached Joe's goal of in-

tegrution.
