Here's the Story of
JI X- MAYATEX FABRICS
"* <Handwoven, Colorfast)
tourist in Guatemala once commissioned
TJtTvJ """ * ,n ' n^'an weave material for a skirt-. She
g.ivc definite instructions to the weaver as to
color and design. At the promised time, she
went to pick up the material. It was beautiful!
However, half way through the piece the design changed, and there
was a beautiful new lilt to the color.
"I like this," she said, "but why the change in pattern?"
"Senorita," the Indian replied, "I started just as you requested;
but, half way through, I heard the song of a bird. It changed my
mood and conquered my fingers Who can deny the song
of a bird?"
And so it is with Mavatcx Fabrics! Seldom are there more than
one or two pattern or color designs alike. They. too. change with
the mood of the artist.
