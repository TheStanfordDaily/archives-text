# Cat-Card Regatta Here Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity crew, sharp and ready to roll, will take on
California's champion Bears tomorrow morning at 10:05 on the
home course in the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
It will mark the first time in history that the Cal-Stanford
Regatta has been held at Palo Alto, and the local officials have

• gone all out to put on a spectacular
; show.
Starting with the JV race at 8:55
a.m.. the regatta will be run off
rapidly and smoothly. The frosh
j eights will take the water at 9:30,
• and die varsity shells will take the
j spotlight 35 minutes later.
Warren May Witness
| All eyes, including those of the
| two university presidents, and pos
j siblv Gov. Earl Warren, will be on
! the Stanford varsity as it tries a
: race against the odds to defeat the
j heavily-favored defending Olympic
j champions.
j Indian cliances were dropping fast
! yesterday when it was learned that
Coxswain Johnny Dee will be out
| with the mumps, but the Cards are
! hoping to surprise anyway.
Stanford hasn't beaten California
since 1917 when the Indians were
i second and California was third in
! a three-way regatta with Wash ing
| ton.
But the Stanford eight has :>everal
j factors in its favor this year which
j might prove enough to turn back
; the Bears.
| Coach Ace Clark has all his men
; back from his '48 outfit which lost
| only to Cal and broke the then
existing Oakland Estuary record in
! finishing second.
No Practice Run
The Cards also have the advan
; tage of rowing on home waters. The
Bears have never rowed on the Palo
; Alto course, and according to their
coach. Ky Ebright, they will not
j take even a practice run.
However, Ebright and his cox
j swains were down recently to look
: over the course, so that the shell
: skippers will at least be familiar
with the layout.
Stanford adds still another advan
tage in view of the fact that it is
i the opening event of the season for
| both schools, and the Bears are usu
! ally slow staiters.
However, overshadowing all the
good breaks, is the unfortunate loss
! of Coxswain Johnny Dee. and the
Card oarsmen will te at a great
I disadvantage without the services of
their regular skipper.
Lost Two
( Besides that, the Bears have as
• many as six rowers and the cox
' swain back from their 1948 Olympic
champion crew, losing only two men
through graduation.
Ace Clark will base his hopes for
victory on Jay Niblo at stroke, Norm
j Swanson (7>, Ray Atkinson (6),
Jim Brannaman (5), Doug Lilly (4),
