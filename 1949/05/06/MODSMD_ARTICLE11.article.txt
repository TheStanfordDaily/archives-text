## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's varsity crew, sharp and ready to roll, will take on
California's champion Bears tomorrow morning at 10:05 on the
home course in the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
It will mark the first time in history that the Cal-Stanford
Regatta has been held at Palo Alto, and the local officials have

• gone all out to put on a spectacular
; show.
Starting with the JV race at 8:55
a.m.. the regatta will be run off
rapidly and smoothly. The frosh
j eights will take the water at 9:30,
• and die varsity shells will take the
j spotlight 35 minutes later.
Warren May Witness
| All eyes, including those of the
| two university presidents, and pos
j siblv Gov. Earl Warren, will be on
! the Stanford varsity as it tries a
: race against the odds to defeat the
j heavily-favored defending Olympic
j champions.
j Indian cliances were dropping fast
! yesterday when it was learned that
Coxswain Johnny Dee will be out
| with the mumps, but the Cards are
! hoping to surprise anyway.
Stanford hasn't beaten California
since 1917 when the Indians were
i second and California was third in
! a three-way regatta with Wash ing
| ton.
But the Stanford eight has :>everal
j factors in its favor this year which
j might prove enough to turn back
; the Bears.
| Coach Ace Clark has all his men
; back from his '48 outfit which lost
| only to Cal and broke the then
existing Oakland Estuary record in
! finishing second.
No Practice Run
The Cards also have the advan
; tage of rowing on home waters. The
Bears have never rowed on the Palo
; Alto course, and according to their
coach. Ky Ebright, they will not
j take even a practice run.
However, Ebright and his cox
j swains were down recently to look
: over the course, so that the shell
: skippers will at least be familiar
with the layout.
Stanford adds still another advan
tage in view of the fact that it is
i the opening event of the season for
| both schools, and the Bears are usu
! ally slow staiters.
However, overshadowing all the
good breaks, is the unfortunate loss
! of Coxswain Johnny Dee. and the
Card oarsmen will te at a great
I disadvantage without the services of
their regular skipper.
Lost Two
( Besides that, the Bears have as
• many as six rowers and the cox
' swain back from their 1948 Olympic
champion crew, losing only two men
through graduation.
Ace Clark will base his hopes for
victory on Jay Niblo at stroke, Norm
j Swanson (7>, Ray Atkinson (6),
Jim Brannaman (5), Doug Lilly (4),
"W"
Andy Arnosti (3), Ray Haley (2),
and Jim Lc-nhart (bow).
Don McKenzie will probably take !
over the important coxswain job in
place of the ailing Dee.
Varsity Improving
Two weeks ago the varsity was
having a tough time edging the JVs,
but this week the first shell was ;
pulling out to three and four
lengths wins over the JVs.
This offers a clue as to the vac

sity's improvement and should make-
Stanford a solid contender against
California.
For those planning to watch the
races, the City of Palo Alto ha.s pre
pared a parking area next to the
finish line which will accommodate
over 1,000 cars.
To get there by auto, Stanford
students can drive out Em
barcadero, past Buyshoro, and follow
the signs.

Varsity Improving
Two weeks ago the varsity was
having a tough time edging the JVs,
but this week the first shell was ;
pulling out to three and four
lengths wins over the JVs.
This offers a clue as to the vac

sity's improvement and should make-
Stanford a solid contender against
California.
For those planning to watch the
races, the City of Palo Alto ha.s pre
pared a parking area next to the
finish line which will accommodate
over 1,000 cars.
To get there by auto, Stanford
students can drive out Em
barcadero, past Buyshoro, and follow
the signs.
Admission Ls free.


THE VARSITY EIGHT
"Three and four length uiiiN."
Stanford's varsity crew, sharp and ready to roll, will take on
California's champion Bears tomorrow morning at 10:05 on the
home course in the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
It will mark the first time in history that the Cal-Stanford
Regatta has been held at Palo Alto, and the local officials have

• gone all out to put on a spectacular
; show.
Starting with the JV race at 8:55
a.m.. the regatta will be run off
rapidly and smoothly. The frosh
j eights will take the water at 9:30,
• and die varsity shells will take the
j spotlight 35 minutes later.

j Indian cliances were dropping fast

Coxswain Johnny Dee will be out
