# Past Water Carnivals Had Men's Beauty Contests, Fireworks

### MARGIE COYKENDALL 
During many other years Stan
iord students have worried about
the lack of water in Lake Lagunita
lot a water carnival. Last year and
the year before there was not
enough, but this isn't half as bad
as in the early 'thirties, when there
wasn't any water for a five-year

stretch. Other years scattered
throughout Stanford's history have
also been dry.
The first water carnival was held
on the first Junior Day in the early
spi ing of 1894. just three years after
the founding of the University. It
was not called a "water carnival,"
however, but an "aquatic sports

program." Many of the pirns failed
to materialize, and only a boat race
and a few exhibitions of diving
were teatured.
Formerly Ball Game
The next year, and on successive
Junior Days until 1907, a baseball
game look the place of the aquatic
sports program. Swimming, boating,
and novelty races were held in 1907.
High'ight of that affair was an in
terclass boat race, which served as
a precedent for many successive

years. Prizes, as in all succeeding
years, were given to the winners.
Big pirns were made by the class
of '17 for the 1916 Junior Week.
During this week two water events
took place at the lake—one at night
and the other during the day. The
evening program consisted of fire
works and musical numbers per
formed by the band and glee club,
which v.-ere on floating barees on
the lake. The usual races and con
tests made up the day's program.
In 1922 the juniors for the first
time started to call the show a "wa

ter carnival." which has stuck ever
since.
Nightie Race Censored
The following year and in other
years in the twenties an invitational
cross-lake swim race, entered by
visiting celebrities, was among the
events. The juniors p.'anned to have
a bathing suit parade and a wom
en s "nightie race," copied from
Northwestern University; but much
to the students' disgust, University
authorities tabooed the two events.
However, many years later, in
1939, the students got their wpv
and a men's bathing beauty contest
and women's nightgown race were
held. A water polo game, comic
diving act, end log-rolling contest
took place at the men's pool because
the lake was dry.
1924—Floats Begin
Another "first" was in 1924 when
a float parade was ac'ded to the
urogram. That year the carnival
was at night and fireworks, musical
numbers, and aqua-planing behind
power boats were other events.
During the dry years, in the early
'thirties, diving exhibitions, relays.

novelty events, nid races took place
at the men's poel and the new wom
en's pool. When water did comt
back in 1935. a "Royal Pair," elected
king and queen, led a procession o:
decorated canoes around the lake
before the program began.
V-E Announcement
During the dry years in the early
the carnival was not held, but r
was held in April. 1945. At the end
of the l day, after the float parade
and contest were finished, an an
nouncement came over the loud
speaker that Germany had sur
rendered..
The lake was suddenly filled with
"oyous students who dived in wit!'
their clothes on; the shore was lint,
with students 'aughing. cry inc. and
hugging each other. Although the
news was several days premature
it rendered the 1945 carnival unfor
gettable.

to the students' disgust, University
authorities tabooed the two events.
However, many years later, in
1939, the students got their wpv
and a men's bathing beauty contest
and women's nightgown race were
held. A water polo game, comic
diving act, end log-rolling contest
took place at the men's pool because
the lake was dry.
1924—Floats Begin
Another "first" was in 1924 when
a float parade was ac'ded to the

V-E Announcement
During the dry years in the early
the carnival was not held, but r
was held in April. 1945. At the end
of the l day, after the float parade
and contest were finished, an an
nouncement came over the loud
speaker that Germany had sur
rendered..
The lake was suddenly filled with
"oyous students who dived in wit!'
their clothes on; the shore was lint,
with students 'aughing. cry inc. and
hugging each other. Although the
news was several days premature
it rendered the 1945 carnival unfor
gettable.

During many other years Stan
iord students have worried about
the lack of water in Lake Lagunita
lot a water carnival. Last year and
the year before there was not
enough, but this isn't half as bad
as in the early 'thirties, when there
wasn't any water for a five-year

stretch. Other years scattered
throughout Stanford's history have
also been dry.
The first water carnival was held
on the first Junior Day in the early
spi ing of 1894. just three years after
the founding of the University. It
was not called a "water carnival,"
however, but an "aquatic sports

program." Many of the pirns failed
to materialize, and only a boat race
and a few exhibitions of diving
were teatured.
Formerly Ball Game
The next year, and on successive
Junior Days until 1907, a baseball
game look the place of the aquatic
sports program. Swimming, boating,
and novelty races were held in 1907.
High'ight of that affair was an in
terclass boat race, which served as
a precedent for many successive

years. Prizes, as in all succeeding
years, were given to the winners.
Big pirns were made by the class
of '17 for the 1916 Junior Week.
During this week two water events
took place at the lake—one at night
and the other during the day. The
evening program consisted of fire
works and musical numbers per
formed by the band and glee club,
which v.-ere on floating barees on
the lake. The usual races and con
tests made up the day's program.
In 1922 the juniors for the first
time started to call the show a "wa

ter carnival." which has stuck ever
since.
Nightie Race Censored
The following year and in other
years in the twenties an invitational
cross-lake swim race, entered by
visiting celebrities, was among the
events. The juniors p.'anned to have
a bathing suit parade and a wom
