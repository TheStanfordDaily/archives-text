## Give Us the Facts 
### 
In these days of high prices we expect the cost of education
lo follow the general cost of living curve. Our cheap money
pays for tuition, board and room, and class supplies, and because
the expense is high we v/ant to know how that money is used.
This is true particularly in the case of board and room. For
several years we have been told that the University is losing
money. Comparing income against expenditures, that statement,
basically, is true. Some phases of University operations lose
money each year; others break even. A few, however, show a
profit.
The board and room category is a typical example of all three
parts of the above statement. Women's Row houses go in the
ued every year. In the case of Toyon, on the other hand, the
men have good reason to suspect that four-figured profits are
made annally. There is an interesting comparison of board and
tcoin costs between fraternities and University-operated halls.
Fraternity room bills average five or six dollars under the
average Toyon rent costs, but Men's Row houses are separate
small units. They cost more to operate than a single, large unit
such as Toyon Hall.
Food costs in University-operated dining halls are $150 per
â€¢quarter. Fraternity board expenses average 5139.50 for the same
number of meals per quarter. Only two houses have higher
board bills than the $150 University food price. The SlO differ
ence between the two dining facilities is a difficult one to explain,
especially in the case of the Encina Commons where the eco
nomical cafeteria method is used to feed many hundreds of men.
If the University is realizing a profit from Toyon room rents
end from Encina food costs, we may safely state that the profit
is wiped out by the monetary loss in maintaining Women's Row
houses and in the extra labor used in producing women's meals.
We must consider one point before we criticize the University
for discriminating against Encina diners and Toyon residents:
Board and room costs, like our tuition expense, are paid out
from the same pot. Some students get better food and housing
than others. In the case of tuition, some academic departments
cost mere than others to conduct, yet we all pay the same tui
tion price of $200. More tuition money is spent on engineering
majors than on English majors.
Encina food often is not as fancy as Lagunita's, but the stu
dents pay a median cost to avoid extremes.
Although administration officials have been more cooperative
in recent months in informing student leaders about University
costs, these same officials still dodge the real issue of profits
and losses concerning rooms and meals. The students should be
given the complete facts in these cases. In that way, only, can
Farm men and women begin to dispose of their suspicion of
the University's awkward handling of student fees.
