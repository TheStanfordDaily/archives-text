## Bull Session 
### 
Well, stuff my ballot box, if it isn't time for student body elections!
When the nominations opened for the coming elections, several campus
groups said they would like to see me run .... out of town.
The race for student body president should be very interesting this

time. One of the candidates came up to our house to
talk to us the other night, but I had a little t'\Â»uble
trying to figure out what he was talking about. He
didn't say.
But all of the colleges are thinking about politics
these days. Even the university newswriting textbooks
are becoming politically-minded. Nowadays instead
of using "man bites dog" as an example of news, they
are using "bull throws congressman."
And you've got to watch out for this political double
talk. A lot of candidates will tell you that they came
into life as a barefooted boy. So what! Not many of

us were born with shoes on!
Did you know that if a politician dies in the U.S. Congress during the
day, the undertakers have to wait until the end of the day to take the
body away? With the great inactivity there, if they try to pick out the
man who is dead betore then, the chances are they'll get the wrong man.
I understand that the biggest question in the Democratic Party today
is whether they would rather have a working majority or a majority
working.
A leading psychiatrist once wrote that it is possible to tell a person's
political tendencies bv the way he drives an automobile. Remind me
never to go riding with a "middle-of-the-road" Republican.
