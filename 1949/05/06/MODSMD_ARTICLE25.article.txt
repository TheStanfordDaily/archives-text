# Headache? Just Stop Worrying
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 5 (.*!») — \ lot of
headaches can be cured by forget
ting your worries.
This is the conclusion of a Colum
bia University headache study made
on 531 men and women, young and
old.
These sufferers were given three
kinds of treatment. One made use
of drugs supposed to help headaches,
another make-believe drugs. The
third was for doctors to spend some
time talking to the patients about
their worries.
In the first two treatments, the
make-believe potions worked almost
as well as medicines designed spe
cially for aching heads. The patients
never knew what kind of drugs they
were taking.
The best results came from com
bining drugs with conversation
about worries. This conversation is
called psycho-therapy. Its purpose
is to discover mental and emotional
conflicts. Frequently the sufferer
does not realize he has these con
flicts and is likely to get better when
he learns about them.
But merely knowing them is not
always enough. He often needs
faith in his doctor to make this
knowledge work. Sometimes the
relief depends on how often the doc
tor sees him.
The study was made on two wide
spread kinds of headaches, those
coming after physical injuries and
those said to be psychogenic, be
cause they come mostly from mental
or emotional tension which goes
hand in hand with some physical
illness.
The study was made by Drs. Ar
nold P. Friedman, Charles Brenner,
and Sidney Carter of Columbia's
College of Physicians and Surgeons
and the Headache Clinic at Monte
fiore Hospital.
