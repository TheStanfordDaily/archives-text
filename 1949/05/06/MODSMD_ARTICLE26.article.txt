The College of Cooperative Set
! tlements, the institution of higher
| learning maintained by the coop
erative settlements in Israel, an
j nounces a special Summer Institute
for visiting American students dur
ing July and August, 1949.
The program includes lectures in
j English, visits to cooperative settle
! ments, and some participation in
j the life of the settlements.
The lectures will cover the social
structure of the settlements, the co
operative forms of production used
in them, and the systems of educa
tion and of the children's villages.
Special attention will be given to
problems of the cooperative devel
opment of unindustrialized areas, the
integration of the highly variegated
large immigration into the life ot
j the country, and the relationship of
j (he voluntary system of the coop
i eratives to the new state apparatus.
The productional, administrative
and social problems which are being
met today by the cooperative set
tlements throw considerable light
upon the incipient problems of this
! nature over large areas of the world.
This Institute will serve not only

ment ot modern Palestine, but also
