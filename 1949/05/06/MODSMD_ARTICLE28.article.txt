# Chaplain's Chat

### PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
The annual National Chaplains'
Conference met for three days, a
week ago, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
It \Vas my privilege to be there, and
to be introduced to the 200 or more
men in attendance who are doing
on many campuses the same sort of
job to which Mr. Minto and I were
called here.
Colleges and universities all over
the United States were represented.
For reasons of efficiency, and that
the group may not grow too large,
membership is limited to those who
are directly employed by univer
sity administrations, and does not
include the much larger body of
those who are in religious work in
behalf of churches, denominations,
and the like.
I am writing this week of the con
ference in order to report how stim
ulating it was, and to say that the
gathering had before it multiplied
the evidence of the mounting in
terest and concern all over the
country for strong religious pro
grams. The number of regularly
appointed chaplains is rapidly grow
ing, and Departments of Religion
ate being established in many insti
tutions.
This fact reflects a confession that
religion—both as an educational dis
cipline and as a philosophy of life,
personal and social—has been pretty
much neglected on our campuses in
recent years.
But that day is over. We are re
turning to the sound good sense once
expressed by President William
Rainey Harper of the University of
Chicago when he stood before the

entering freshmen during "orienta
tion week." Said he:
"Young gentlemen, you have come
here in hope of furthering your edu
cation. If you are to do this it
would be well for you to have some
idea of what an educated human be
ing is. Then you will know what
to aim at here, what this institu
tion exists to assist you to become.
"An educated man is a man who,
by the time he is 25 years old, has a
clear theory, formed in the light of
human experience down the ages,
of what constitutes a satisfying life,
a significant life; and who by the
age of 30 has a moral philosophy
consonant with racial experience.
"If a man reaches these ages
without having arrived at such a
theory, such a philosophy, then no
matter how many facts he has
learned or how many processes he
has mastered, that man is an ig
noramus and a fool, unhappy, prob
ably dangerous. That is all. Good
afternoon."
We, here at Stanford, are on our
way to making it impossible for a
person to end up with only facts
and techniques, and without such a
unifying and basic moral philosophy.
Or, at least, the offerings both of
religious knowledge and of its appli
cations will not be lacking as the
full program originating under the
church and the chaplains is added
to what already exists in the cur
riculum and campus life.
Last Saturday's student confer
ence on religion was one good move
in the right direction, as will be its
second section on May 14. There
are other major creations coming,
as I will be happy to reveal as
time goes on.
