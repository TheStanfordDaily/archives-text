# French Diplomat Speaks on Policy
## 
### 
Jean de Lagarde. French consul
general in S»in Francisco, spoke on j
"The Evolution of French Foreign
Policies" in a program sponsored
by the Romanic languages depart- •
rnent recently.
Mr. de Lagarde outlined the pre
vious foreign policy of France, lie
■fold of the hesitancy between poli- ;
oies of collective security, exem
plified by the League of Nations, |
rnd the tradition of alliances.
In spite of the fact that France j
suffered more during World War 11, I
rhere doesn't seem to be as much 1
hatred against the Germans as there
was during the First World War, j
he said. This seems to indicate that ;
there may be hope for a federation
of states. Lagarde thought.
The Pact of Brussels in 1948 was j
a step on the way to a federation.
Another beginning to a federal state
js the economic co-operation of the
"9 nations due to the Marshal 1 . Plan. !
Mr. de Lagarde concluded by say
ing that many difficulties remain to
be straightened out before a federa
tion of states of western Europe can
be built.
