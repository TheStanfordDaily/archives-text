## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
"Hell's broke loose in Woodpecker Lodae" and
'"There's the devil to pay for around here" is the lingo
being thrown around in and out of rehearsal by par
ticipants in tlie opera "Shvanda."
Terms are snatches trom the Hell scene of this
colorful, gay, and happy Czech folk opera. Shvanda's
wanderings as the bagpiper lake him on a fairyland

journey of the Ice Queen's Palace, his native country,
and a picturesque Hell.
Jaromir Weinberger's story is based on the old
Czcch legend oi the bagpiper who played such beau
tiful music that he disrupted Hell and caused a revolt
ot the angels in Heaven, so that he was condemned
to live forever in the hearts of Czech musicians.
