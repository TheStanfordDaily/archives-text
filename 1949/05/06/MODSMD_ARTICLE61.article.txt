## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team meets tlv»
big, bad Bruins from UCLA today
at 1:30 on the Farm courts in the
second encounter of the season.
In their earlier meeting this year
the Indians were swept off the
courts by Flam. Garrett, and com
pany; and unless the men from the
Southland have been spending their
afternoons at the beach instead of
on the courts, the prospect for a
Stanford victory is slight.
Saturday the Cards take on gen
t'er playmates when they meet San
Francisco Slate at the Stanford
courts at 1:30.
Bob Lewis will draw the tough
est assignment as the first singles
player when he runs into the
Bruins' star performer, Herb Flam.
Flam is probably the greatest ten
nis player to attend the Westwooc
institution.
In the second singles Kirke Me
chcm or Errol Lycette will meet
Gene Garrett. Lycette has chal
lenged 'Mechem for the dubious
honor of meeting Garrett. Il" Gar
rett is his usual potent self, h?
should score a victory over either
Stanford man.
