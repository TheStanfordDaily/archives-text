# Haynie's Splashers Tabbed To Throttle Westwood Mermen
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's once-beaten Stan
i ford tank crew will host the UCLA
Bruins at the Encinu pools tomor
| row afternoon in its next-to-the
| last local appearance of the year.
| Splash-off time has been set for 2:30.
The Westwooders, while their
chances for an upset win over the
Cards remain slight, will be repre
sented by at least three outstanding
individual stars who figure to claim
a healthy share of Saturday's points.
Sprinter Jack Nelson rates an
! even chance of winning his 100-yard
[ specialty against Stanford's Harry
Borchers and Woody Hoogs. al

though either Borchers or
should cop the 50-yard dash event.
Also rated a toss-up on the dope
sheet is the 220-yard breaststroke,
in which the Cards' Don Hester and
Marsh Pearlman will meet Bruin
Gil Tuffii. This one should be a
closie between Hester and Tuffii for
top honors.
The Southerners' ace back-pad
dler. Bill McGray, although he holds
the all-time UCLA record for the
150-yard backstioke, should not fin
ish better than second to Stanford's
Jack Weeden. il past performances
are anv criterion.
