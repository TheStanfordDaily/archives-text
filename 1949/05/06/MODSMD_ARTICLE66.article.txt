# Card Cindermen Favored In 54th Annual Big Meet
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Seeking their first Big Meet vic
tory since 15)40, Coach Jack Weier
shauKer's powerful Indian track
steis will meet Brutus Hamilton's
injury-ridden Bears in the 54th ;in
nual Big Meet to be held at Ed
wards Field in Berkeley.
The little Big Meet, Stanford frosh
vs. Cal frosh, will be run concur
rently with the varsity meet, as ini
tiated last year. The varsity field
events will start at 1:30. the var
sity mile at 2, and the frosh field
events at 1 o'clock.
The Bears themselves have had a
fairly successful season, losing only
one meet—to the USC Trojans, 84'i;
to 46 1 2, in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Two Closies
Cal wins include an ever-so-closa
victory over their Westwood cou
sins, 67 J /'j to t53 J j, in a meet that
was decided by the mile relay.
The Bears also won another closie
from Michigan, 67 to 65, back in
Ann Arbor a week ago.
The closeness of the meet partly
depends on the condition of Dick
Cotton, Roland Maples, Donnie An
derson, and the other Bears who
have been sidelined for most of the
season.
No matter what the final out
come may be, there are bound to
be some thrilling races.
A 1 Lyons, Card miler who is un
defeated this season, will clash with
the Bears' Kaare Vefling, a steady
runner with a killing third lap.
Lyons ran an excellent 4:18 against
the Trojans last weekend, while
Vefling holds the Pacific Coast rec
ord so far this year at 4:15.7.
Bryan Could Score 2.t
Gay Bryan, who is captain of the
Stanford team, may find the sprints
rough going when he meets Cal'-.
Jack Norberg in the 100. and Roland
Maples in the 220.
Bryan's broad jump competition
will also be good, since Bears Jack
Norberg and Ben Corlett have both
jumped over 24 feet.
However, it is quite possible that
the Card ace could grab 25 points in
the Big Meet, which would be a
new record.
The pole vault should be anothei
thriller. Bill Paddock, although
bothered by sore ankles, may give
Cards' Don Campbell a tough after
noon. Both men have lo feet 6
inches as their best jump.
Cal's strong events will be the
two-mile and the 880. The Berke
leyites swept the two-mile from
(JSC, and showed top strength in
the half mile in the Cal-Stanford
Relays on Mar. 26.
Stanford will dominate shot put
and the low hurdles, both possible
sweeps. The Indians may also place
one-two in the discus, the 440. and
the 220.

Jack Norberg in the 100. and Roland
Maples in the 220.
Bryan's broad jump competition
will also be good, since Bears Jack
Norberg and Ben Corlett have both
jumped over 24 feet.
However, it is quite possible that
the Card ace could grab 25 points in
the Big Meet, which would be a
new record.
The pole vault should be anothei
thriller. Bill Paddock, although
bothered by sore ankles, may give
Cards' Don Campbell a tough after
noon. Both men have lo feet 6
inches as their best jump.
Cal's strong events will be the
two-mile and the 880. The Berke
leyites swept the two-mile from
(JSC, and showed top strength in
the half mile in the Cal-Stanford
Relays on Mar. 26.
Stanford will dominate shot put
and the low hurdles, both possible
sweeps. The Indians may also place
one-two in the discus, the 440. and
the 220.
Seeking their first Big Meet vic
tory since 15)40, Coach Jack Weier
shauKer's powerful Indian track
steis will meet Brutus Hamilton's
injury-ridden Bears in the 54th ;in
nual Big Meet to be held at Ed
wards Field in Berkeley.
The little Big Meet, Stanford frosh
vs. Cal frosh, will be run concur
rently with the varsity meet, as ini
tiated last year. The varsity field
events will start at 1:30. the var
sity mile at 2, and the frosh field
events at 1 o'clock.
The Bears themselves have had a
fairly successful season, losing only
one meet—to the USC Trojans, 84'i;
to 46 1 2, in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Two Closies
Cal wins include an ever-so-closa
victory over their Westwood cou
sins, 67 J /'j to t53 J j, in a meet that
was decided by the mile relay.
The Bears also won another closie
from Michigan, 67 to 65, back in
Ann Arbor a week ago.
The closeness of the meet partly
depends on the condition of Dick
Cotton, Roland Maples, Donnie An
derson, and the other Bears who
have been sidelined for most of the
season.
No matter what the final out
come may be, there are bound to
be some thrilling races.
A 1 Lyons, Card miler who is un
defeated this season, will clash with
the Bears' Kaare Vefling, a steady
runner with a killing third lap.
Lyons ran an excellent 4:18 against
the Trojans last weekend, while
Vefling holds the Pacific Coast rec
ord so far this year at 4:15.7.
Bryan Could Score 2.t
Gay Bryan, who is captain of the
Stanford team, may find the sprints
rough going when he meets Cal'-.
