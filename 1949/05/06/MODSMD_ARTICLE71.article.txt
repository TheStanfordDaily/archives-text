# From the Cactus Garden to Frenchman's Road, Stanford Nature Lovers Explore the Farm
## Frost Is Favored Spot of Couples 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Everyone can identify Stan
ford's Palm Drive. Many have
heard of, seen, or had expe
rience with the romantic Cactus
gardens and the paths of Lake
Lagunita.
But how many can tell the story
of Governor's Lane, Cedro Cottage,
and the countless other by-ways
around the Farm?
Especially in the spring, when so
cial activities center outdoors, is the
beauty of Stanford's secluded nooks
and paths evident. Many of the
trails which now serve only hikers'
feet were formerly the main by
roads of the Farm's early students.
Governor's Lane
Most popular of these was Gov
ernor's Lane. On this narrow, dirt
road lined with tall eucalyptus trees,
Senator Stanford took daily drives

in his carriage from hi.s home (now |
the Convalescent Home) to the stock
farm and the Big Red Barn.
White fence posts now block the ,
road entrance, but several hundred
yards down the rutty trail where ;
the road bends and the lake back
washes, there is a bullet-ridden
"slow" sign. It has barely survived
the target practice of Stanford's
future "class of '70."
Along Governor's Lane as it
wound into the meadows west of j
the Cactus Garden years ago was !
the old winery, now a dairy, which j
has changed its character signifi- i
cantly.
Frenchman's Dream
The mystery of Frenchman's Road, j
built by Peter Coutts, who lived
near Ryan Laboratory from 1874-82. j
is one of the fondest memories of I
old-timers.
Guy Miller, Palo Alto and Stan
ford historian, tells of the French
man's desires to build a huge castle- j
mansion on Mystery Hill overlook
ing the east part of Mayfield Road.
The road leading to the hill's sum- !
mit is still discernable, but the ;

; dreamed-of mansion never took
form.
Instead Coutts built an artificial
; lake. Hidden in the weeds near
Frenchman's Road are remnants of
the lake's stone embankments.
Mrs. S lias Her Say
The lumber business can be cred
| ited for popularizing Searsville Road
| which runs west of the Carnegie
Laboratory. Over this road, past the
i adobe rancho of the early Spanish
i landowners, the lumber wagons
I rolled. But the noise frightened
j Mrs. Stanford's prize livestock, and
j the "first lady" called a halt, and
traffic switched to a new road.
The same thing happened in 1901
when Ray Lyman Wilbur drove his
first Autocar over the bumpy stock
! farm roads. The result was a detour
for Mr. Wilbur's car and peace and
quiet for the Stanford stallions.
Cedro Cottage Ghosts
One of the strangest of legend,-;
j deals with with a small nook near
the golf course. A path runs over a
! a ickety wooden bridge on the golf
S course near Cedro Cottage. People
: used to think the little house was

haunted.
Sam McDonald, who was a night
watchman for the stock farm then,
knew the secret of the ghosts and
he agreed to live there. Now he ex
plains that the only ghosts that ever
haunted Cedro Cottage were col
lege couples crawling around in the
cypress hedges.
No one can speak of spring on the
Farm without mentioning the fam
ous Cactus Gardens. Here ro
mances and cactus plants sprouted
together in the early days. Boys
scratched sweethearts' initials in the
cactus plants. Girls were enthralled
by the moonlit pathways. Things
have changed now.
Cops vs. Love
In 1932, when patrolmen started
j shooing parked students from the
! Gardens, an irate Daily editorial
; said "Automobiles patrol the Gar
dens, filled with irate officials, ruth
lessly ordering out any parked cars
with the curt, unaesthetic phrase,
'No parkin' in here, Buddy.' What
dreams, what romances have been
i shattered by that rude remark."
But police still discourage noc

turnal adventures in the Cactus
Gardens because of several rob
beries. One night-patrolman reports
a great popularity for the Searsville
Road which he accepts as "free
parking."
Campus lovers have changed their
wanderings, though. They have be
queathed the Cactus Gardens to Palo
Alto High students and have taken
over the grassy slopes of Frost Am
phitheater. Pathways winding'
among the 40 kinds of trees, moon
light shining on tho peach blossoms
outside the bowl, or the full cres
cent showing through the billowing
clouds from the steam plant, give
the amphitheater an atmosphere all
its own. (Watch out for snails,
though!)
The Shores of Lake I<ag
If your girl likes rippling water
better than dewey hillsides, the
paths of Lake Lagunita beckon.
Many moonlight strollers walk
around the west side of the lake and
then down the slopes to cross a
trickling stream near Governor's
Lane.
Here, the wind in the eucalyptus
branches and the smell of meadow
flowers greet many hikers by day
or And near Portola Road
"Where rolling' foothills rise," there
are numerous secluded picnic spots.
All these by-ways and many more
which the student alone can find,
must have been what some son
writer meant when he said:
"When your heart sings a song as
you stroll along.
That's Stanford in spring.
When the flowers show their blos
soms
And the birds begin to sing.
When a tender refrain haunts Gov
ernor's Lane,
That's Stanford in spring.''
