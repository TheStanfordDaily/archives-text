# Stanford Unit Combats Polio
## 
### BOB RIGNEY 
Warm weather brings not only
sunburn and spring fever, but an
increase in a more grim disease as
wellâ€”poliomyelitis.
To help combat this disease, there
has been set up at Stanford, as well
as Harvard and Northwestern uni
versities, a Polio Unit, financed by
a grant from the National Founda
tion for Infantile Paralysis.
The primary function of this Polio
Unit is to send a team of teaching
personnel trained in the latest
methods of poliomyelitis treatment
to an epidemic area in order to aid
1 the medical personnel of that area
Although the West Coast is the
general area of operation of the
Stanford Unit, it can be called into
action in any part of the United
States at any time of the year if
needed, at the request of the County
Medical Association and the De
| partment of Public Health.
Equipment
This team is made up of a physi
cian, two physical therapists, and an
orthopedic nurse. Also a social
service worker, a pediatrician, and
other specialists may be called if
needed. Dr. Northway, assistant
dean of the Medical School and
medical director of Physical Therapy
at Stanford, is the physician in
charge of the unit. All equipment
used is supplied by the area asking
I for help.
The Polio Unit is extremely valu
able for smaller cities and rural
areas where there has been little
experience in handling this disease
Patients in epidemics in California
j since the founding of this unit three
! years ago have been treated in the
larger cities where there have been
adequate facilities.
Therapi *> t Workers
Members of this team teach in the
Division of Physical Therapy at
Stanford. Although this department
; was founded in 1941, it has already
graduated over 000 students.
In conjunction with it is a small
i clinic set up in Stanford Village
| where treatment is available for a
; number of different conditions, in -
