# Huck Finn Complex Hits Oldsters, Young Ones
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — This is the time of year people get
the Huck Finn complex and start floating down the Mississippi
River.
They travel in canoes and outboard motorboats, on home made
cabin rafts, and on contraptions of wood and tarpaper that couldn't

rightly be called anything.
Most of the travelers are youths
looking for adventure in the fashion
of Mark Twain's hero, Huckleberry
Finn, whose river trip on a raft
made a classic of American Litera
ture.
But there is no discrimination as
to age or sex in the annual spring
summer trek. Last year, for in
stance, a paii* of comely Chicago
girls, Margaret Carpenter and Mary
Kuhn, paddled down to New Or
leans in a canoe.
Fathers and sons, married couples,
men who missed adventure in youtii
and seek it in middle age, find thrills
and fun fighting currents and eddies
on the big stream.
Soldiers Become Seaborne
Last season three soldiers came
from Columbus, Ohio, via the Ohio
and Mississippi, in rowboats made
of airplane gasoline tanks.
Carl Madrid came from Chicago
via various streams on something
that looked like a raft, but not ex
actly like any other raft.
Four boys from Bowling Green,
Kentucky, floated down on a house

boat they had made out of $73
worth of materials.
There's no telling how many peo
ple try the trip every year, and
find the current or the wash of
bigger craft too perilous. There's no
telling how many complete the trip
j either because they may come
ashore here at any one of several
! score places without attracting par
j ticular notice.
They Don't Float Back
Most of the voyagers sell their
boats, if they can be sold, and head
home in more conventional manner,
by train or bus or hitch-hiking.
Some go on looking for more
{ thrills. A few continue down the
river into the Gulf of Mexico, hoping
' to make Mexico, Florida or a Carib
bean island.
The time it takes for the trip
varies greatly. Phil Harrison and
John Oberly of Grand Rapids, each
lf> years old, said they covered 2,500
miles on the Mississippi and its
tributaries in 31 days in a canoe.
That's good representative time.
Night Calls a Halt
Most of the adventurers travel
only by days, camping on the levees
or going into towns for the night.
The river is rough enough in the
sunlight, and much too much for
the average frail boat in darkness.
Time was when plenty of produce
came to New Orleans in this man
ner, on cheap flatboats which could
be abandoned or sold here because
there was no ways to get them back
up the river.
Probably the best-known man to
make such a trip was a Kentuckian
who moved to Illinois, name of
Abraham Lincoln.


AN ESKIMOS DREAM — Fur
clad Laura Elliot, exchange siren
from the igloo country, comes
south to view the Farm. She's
guaranteed to raise temperatures
in every eight o'clock class.

Four boys from Bowling Green,
Kentucky, floated down on a house

boat they had made out of $73
worth of materials.
There's no telling how many peo
ple try the trip every year, and
find the current or the wash of
bigger craft too perilous. There's no
telling how many complete the trip
j either because they may come
ashore here at any one of several

j ticular notice.
They Don't Float Back
Most of the voyagers sell their
boats, if they can be sold, and head
home in more conventional manner,
by train or bus or hitch-hiking.
Some go on looking for more
{ thrills. A few continue down the
river into the Gulf of Mexico, hoping
' to make Mexico, Florida or a Carib
bean island.
The time it takes for the trip
varies greatly. Phil Harrison and
John Oberly of Grand Rapids, each
lf> years old, said they covered 2,500
miles on the Mississippi and its
tributaries in 31 days in a canoe.
That's good representative time.
Night Calls a Halt
Most of the adventurers travel
only by days, camping on the levees
or going into towns for the night.
The river is rough enough in the
sunlight, and much too much for
the average frail boat in darkness.
Time was when plenty of produce
came to New Orleans in this man
ner, on cheap flatboats which could
be abandoned or sold here because
there was no ways to get them back
up the river.
Probably the best-known man to
make such a trip was a Kentuckian
who moved to Illinois, name of
Abraham Lincoln.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — This is the time of year people get
the Huck Finn complex and start floating down the Mississippi
River.
They travel in canoes and outboard motorboats, on home made
cabin rafts, and on contraptions of wood and tarpaper that couldn't

rightly be called anything.
Most of the travelers are youths
looking for adventure in the fashion
of Mark Twain's hero, Huckleberry
Finn, whose river trip on a raft
made a classic of American Litera
ture.
But there is no discrimination as
to age or sex in the annual spring
summer trek. Last year, for in

Fathers and sons, married couples,
men who missed adventure in youtii
and seek it in middle age, find thrills
and fun fighting currents and eddies
on the big stream.
Soldiers Become Seaborne
Last season three soldiers came
from Columbus, Ohio, via the Ohio
and Mississippi, in rowboats made
of airplane gasoline tanks.
Carl Madrid came from Chicago
