# Improvements Are Planned For Sunday Movie Equipment
## 
### 
Two thousand dollars was voted by Excom recently for
making improvements in Sunday Movie equipment. The money
is being drawn from the Sunday Movie fund, earned by the
weekly showing of commercial films in Memorial Auditorium.
The present system is obsolete, says Oley Killingsworth, as-

sistant engineer at the Corporation
■ Yard who is in charge of the proj
ect. With new and rebuilt equip
ment, patrons of the movies will
watch pictures that are larger,
1 clearer, and free from flickers, and
will listen over an improved sound
system, he adds.
Changes will include new lenses
to make a larger picture on the
screen, new lamp houses for a
stronger, sharper picture, new "rib
; bon-type" resistors to prevent flick -
i ering, and rebuilt amplifiers for im
' proved hearing.
The lenses on order, says Ki 1 —
j lingsworth, will increase the width
of the pictures by four feet. Memo
| rial Auditorium calls for a picture
width of 25 feet. However, Sunday
: Movie projectors now cast a picture
width of only 19 feet, two small for
j good vision throughout the hall.
Over $1,000 will be spent for new,
j high - intensity carbon - arc lamp
j houses, creating a much stronger,
j clearer picture.
The sound system will be im
proved by rebuilt amplifiers. The
j present system was intended for 16-
! mm. films, not 35-mm. movies.
The engineer said that work will
j be started when the apparatus ar
! rives, and as soon as a day can be
I found when the work will not dis
! turb ordinary functions of the au
| ditorium.
The movie sound set-up is sepa
rate from the public address sys
tem. The Sunday Movies require
six speakers placed behind the
screen, using their own amplifiers.
