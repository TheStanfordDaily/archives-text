# Farm Psychology Department Offers New, Painless Tests
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
Notice the happy, smiling student. He has a test today, but
is he worried? No, for his test will probably consist of some
thing as difficult as throwing darts or looking at cartoons.
Unbelievable as it sounds, there are examinations on the
Farm that require no studying. These are the tests taken by

Psychology 51 students acting as
"Guinea pigs" for lab experiments.
Every quarter students must
fcerve a specified number of hours
as research subjects. The arrange
ment has a two-fold purpose; it
enables students to participate in
laboratory work, and at the same
time furnishes subjects for the ex
periments being conducted by fac
ulty and graduate students.
Method in Their Madness
When a student reports for his
lab he may find himself doing any
thing from weight-lifting to memo
rizing lists of nonsense syllables.
Usually the subject has no idea of
the purpose for which he is being
tested.
It may seem meaningless to be

asked to estimate the accuracy of
his aim, and then throw darts at a
target, but requests like this con
tribute information to a ffarefully
planned experiment on the level of
aspiration, and the actions of the un
aware student will one day be part
of a record in a Master's thesis.
It's A Dog's Life
Psych 51 students during winter
and spring quarters of 1948 spent
their hours looking at a pictuie
story of a dog named Blacky, and
interpreting the events in each pic
ture. The students would have been
amazed to learn that they were con
tributing to a study of the psycho
analytical theory of psychosexual
development.
