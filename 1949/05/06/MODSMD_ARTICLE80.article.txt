(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of articles on the history
of Stanford buildings.)
Behind the construction of the buildings of Stanford Univer
sity lies a history full of pride and adventure, disaster and re
birth, humor, seriousness, and perhaps foremost, a memory.
Leland Stanford Junior University is a living memorial, built
by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford following the death of their

son, Leland Junior, who died while
the Stanford family was traveling
abroad in 1884.
Palo Alto Farm, 9,000-acre home
estate of the Senator, was chosen
for the site. Fifteen hundred acres
were set aside for the campus
proper, and on May 14, 1887, the
birthday of the deceased son, a
X'ough 2x2x3-foot sandstone block,
quarried from a nearby hill, was set
down in a cleared wheatfield.
The block was the first stone of
the Inner Quad, and can now be
seen at the northeast corner of
Mathematics Building (50.
Buff Sandstone
After four years, twelve one-
building of the Inner Quad
were completed. All were con
st ructed of buff sandstone blocks,
thick enough to defy possible
storms and earthquakes. Also com
pleted by 1891 were the Museum
and two dormitories, Ruble and En
cina.
The Museum, a special memorial j
to young Leland, was an architect's
copy of the museum at Athens, and [
was the first structure in the world
to be constructed by the "Ransome |
Process,'' using reinforced concrete. '
Two wings were added later, and by j
1905, the building housed one of ,
the biggest college museums in the I
country.
Both Roble and Encina had been
planned to look alike, but the plans
were changed when women were i
allowed to register to attend the
first classes and something had to j
be done to house them. In July,
1891, Mrs. Stanford called for a
drastic revision on Roble (now Se
quoia). The building was replanned
one-third the original size, to be
made from reinforced concrete, us
ing the sandstone chippings from
Encina and the Quad.
Encina Serves AH
The structure was rushed to com- ;
pletion in three months, but the
women had to eat at Encina first
because the dining facilities were
unfinished.
Encina was modeled on a large i
scale after a hotel at Silva Plena in
the Swiss Engadine, where the Stan
fords once spent a holiday. In 1898
the kitchen was removed and the
"Bull Pen" converted into a lounge.
After going through opening cere
monies on Oct. 1, 1891. the stu
dents moved into the dorms. They
found their rooms well equipped
with furniture. Blankets made from
the wool of the Senator's sheep, j
white for the women and red for i
the men, were on the beds. Each
student was given a Bible by Mrs. j
Stanford.
Financial Troubles
Work continued on the campus,
and by the turn of the century, 14
buildings were completed on the
Outer Quad. The building went on
during trying times, carried on by
Mrs. Stanford after the Senator died !
in 1893, on the eve of a financial
panic.
In 1900, the Thomas YVelton Stan
ford Library, now the Law School
Building, was built, using funds
from the Senator's brother in Aus- I
tralia. The Assembly Hall to the
left was built as a lecture and dra- ■
matics hall, and was used for that
purpose until 1937.
Dividing the two sections on the
front of the Outer Quad was the
huge, $GB,OOO Memorial Arch. Top
ping the 100-foot structure was a
frieze representing' the march of
civilization across the American con
tinent.

Leland Stanford Junior University is a living memorial, built
by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford following the death of their

son, Leland Junior, who died while
the Stanford family was traveling
abroad in 1884.
Palo Alto Farm, 9,000-acre home
estate of the Senator, was chosen
for the site. Fifteen hundred acres
were set aside for the campus
proper, and on May 14, 1887, the
birthday of the deceased son, a
X'ough 2x2x3-foot sandstone block,
quarried from a nearby hill, was set
down in a cleared wheatfield.
The block was the first stone of
the Inner Quad, and can now be
seen at the northeast corner of
Mathematics Building (50.
Buff Sandstone
After four years, twelve one-
building of the Inner Quad
were completed. All were con
st ructed of buff sandstone blocks,
thick enough to defy possible
storms and earthquakes. Also com
pleted by 1891 were the Museum
and two dormitories, Ruble and En
cina.
The Museum, a special memorial j
to young Leland, was an architect's
copy of the museum at Athens, and [
was the first structure in the world
to be constructed by the "Ransome |
Process,'' using reinforced concrete. '
Two wings were added later, and by j
1905, the building housed one of ,
the biggest college museums in the I
country.
Both Roble and Encina had been
planned to look alike, but the plans
were changed when women were i
allowed to register to attend the
first classes and something had to j
be done to house them. In July,
1891, Mrs. Stanford called for a
drastic revision on Roble (now Se
quoia). The building was replanned
one-third the original size, to be
made from reinforced concrete, us
ing the sandstone chippings from
Encina and the Quad.
Encina Serves AH
The structure was rushed to com- ;
pletion in three months, but the
women had to eat at Encina first
because the dining facilities were
unfinished.
Encina was modeled on a large i
scale after a hotel at Silva Plena in
the Swiss Engadine, where the Stan
fords once spent a holiday. In 1898
the kitchen was removed and the
"Bull Pen" converted into a lounge.
After going through opening cere
monies on Oct. 1, 1891. the stu
dents moved into the dorms. They
found their rooms well equipped
with furniture. Blankets made from
the wool of the Senator's sheep, j
white for the women and red for i
the men, were on the beds. Each
student was given a Bible by Mrs. j
Stanford.
Financial Troubles
Work continued on the campus,
and by the turn of the century, 14
buildings were completed on the
Outer Quad. The building went on
during trying times, carried on by
Mrs. Stanford after the Senator died !
in 1893, on the eve of a financial
panic.
In 1900, the Thomas YVelton Stan
ford Library, now the Law School
Building, was built, using funds
from the Senator's brother in Aus- I
tralia. The Assembly Hall to the
left was built as a lecture and dra- ■
matics hall, and was used for that
purpose until 1937.
Dividing the two sections on the
front of the Outer Quad was the
huge, $GB,OOO Memorial Arch. Top
ping the 100-foot structure was a
frieze representing' the march of
civilization across the American con
tinent.
