## 
### BOB BATLIN 
A lag in the beverage business
recently necessitated the discon
tinuance of one of the largest schol
arship programs in the nation, spon
sored by the Pepsi-Cola Company.
Although no new awards will be
made, students already profiting
from the scholarships will continue
to receive the benefits, according to
Professor John Stalnaker, represen
tative of the scholarships for this
area.
Prof essor Stalnaker said the com
pany was reluctant to discontinue
its support of needy students, but
the $500,000 it spends annually for

the program became too large a
financial load to bear.
However, 489 men and women
who would probably have been un
able to secure any higher educa
tion have already been helped
through college. These students re
ceived their entire tuition for four
years, plus $25 a month for expenses
and additional lunds for traveling
expenses.
At present, 23 Stanford students
are receiving the benefits of the
awards, second only to Harvard in
the number of Pepsi-Cola scholars
attending a single university.
