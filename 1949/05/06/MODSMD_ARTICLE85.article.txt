# Vets Must Check Insurance Policies
## 
### 
Stanford veterans are advised by
the Veterans Administration to give
their National Service Life Insur
ance policies periodic "three - way j
checks" to make certain that their i
policies are consistent with their
needs.
The check should cover benefi-j
ciaries, how proceeds are to be paid ;
to beneficiaries, and amount and

type of insurance.
Many veterans fail to name new
beneficiaries when they marry or
when a designated beneficiary dies,
the VA said.
Changes in family status or far
ily income often require a veteran
to change the method of NSLI set
tlement.
