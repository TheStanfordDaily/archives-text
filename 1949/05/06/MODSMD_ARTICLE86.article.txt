From full to slim, from long to short and
back again—this summarizes the fashions of
the past 100 years and will probably be true
of the next century.
However, although skirt lengths and waist
lines move up and down, fundamental changes
are actually very few and are primarily evi
dences of the independence of women.
HERE'S HOW these trends have manifested
themselves through a century. One hundred
years ago, women's fashions were character
ized by high waists and full skirts. These
skirts, braced by crinoline petticoats, were
drawn back around the bottom like a curtain
with the top petticoat showing.
Loose Garbaldi" blouses were tied very
high accentuating long, sloping shoulders
and low necklines.
WHEN WOMEN became more athletic in
the 1860's, the crinoline was bunched in back
in a bustle, giving a slimmer look. Huge
sleeves, capes, and large hats helped make
milady rather top-heavy looking.
In the Nineties, about the time Stanford was
founded, skirts were flared below an infini
tesimal waist. The hour-glass look has super
seded the "mushroom style." Leg o'Mutton
sleeves on starched shirtwaists were all the
vogue. This was the class costume of the
Roble belles those first few years.
WHEN IN 1905 the women decided to be
politically independent, their closets showed
a corresponding change. Long slim skirts
worn with long cutaway jackets and mannish

shirtwaists enhanced their masculine appear
ance.
World War I brought a raising of the hem
and necklines. Members of the "Five Hun
dred" now showed dainty high-laced boots
and spats below their skirts. Full skirts, middy
blouses, and short hair also characterized
war-time attire.
The dapper flapper girl was gueen on the
Farm after the Armistice, with her sack-like
dress with a sash at the hip line and with an
inverted kettle hat atop her shingled hair.
HIGH NECKLINES and long sleeves helped
to make her look even more like a real war
veteran. At this time the use of makeup was
sanctioned as were high heels and silk stock
ings for everyday wear.
In 1930 a new, more feminine silhouette
took precedence over the flappers. Skirts
dropped with stock market reports, became
fuller, and the waistline returned to its normal
position.
Skirts went up again during World War II
owing to the scarcity of material. The foot
ball hero look was popular with broad shoul
ders and slim hips.
THE "NEW LOOK" was heralded in Paris
in 1946 with swooping skirts, cut-to-the-waist
necklines and very short hair. It made its
debut on the Farm in 1947 when freshman
women appeared in skirts down to their an
kles.
Now in 1949, skirts are slowly rising and the
cycle begins again. In a year or two, perhaps,
necklines again will be high, skirt hems just
below the knees, and long hair in vogue.

Old lashioned nighties have I

McGHEE looks pert in the
modern version — a tommy
coat from /. C. PENNEY'S.
Jersey with an eyelet trim.
From full to slim, from long to short and
back again—this summarizes the fashions of
the past 100 years and will probably be true
of the next century.
However, although skirt lengths and waist
lines move up and down, fundamental changes
are actually very few and are primarily evi
dences of the independence of women.
HERE'S HOW these trends have manifested
themselves through a century. One hundred
years ago, women's fashions were character
ized by high waists and full skirts. These
skirts, braced by crinoline petticoats, were
drawn back around the bottom like a curtain
with the top petticoat showing.
Loose Garbaldi" blouses were tied very
high accentuating long, sloping shoulders
and low necklines.
WHEN WOMEN became more athletic in
the 1860's, the crinoline was bunched in back
in a bustle, giving a slimmer look. Huge
sleeves, capes, and large hats helped make
milady rather top-heavy looking.
In the Nineties, about the time Stanford was
founded, skirts were flared below an infini
tesimal waist. The hour-glass look has super
seded the "mushroom style." Leg o'Mutton
sleeves on starched shirtwaists were all the
vogue. This was the class costume of the
Roble belles those first few years.
WHEN IN 1905 the women decided to be
politically independent, their closets showed
a corresponding change. Long slim skirts
worn with long cutaway jackets and mannish

shirtwaists enhanced their masculine appear
ance.
World War I brought a raising of the hem
and necklines. Members of the "Five Hun
dred" now showed dainty high-laced boots
and spats below their skirts. Full skirts, middy
blouses, and short hair also characterized
war-time attire.
The dapper flapper girl was gueen on the
Farm after the Armistice, with her sack-like
dress with a sash at the hip line and with an
inverted kettle hat atop her shingled hair.
HIGH NECKLINES and long sleeves helped
to make her look even more like a real war
veteran. At this time the use of makeup was
sanctioned as were high heels and silk stock
ings for everyday wear.
In 1930 a new, more feminine silhouette
took precedence over the flappers. Skirts
dropped with stock market reports, became
fuller, and the waistline returned to its normal
position.
Skirts went up again during World War II
owing to the scarcity of material. The foot
ball hero look was popular with broad shoul
ders and slim hips.
THE "NEW LOOK" was heralded in Paris
in 1946 with swooping skirts, cut-to-the-waist
necklines and very short hair. It made its
debut on the Farm in 1947 when freshman
women appeared in skirts down to their an
kles.
Now in 1949, skirts are slowly rising and the
cycle begins again. In a year or two, perhaps,
necklines again will be high, skirt hems just
below the knees, and long hair in vogue.
