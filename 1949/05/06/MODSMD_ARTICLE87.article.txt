# When The Girls Take off Their Galoshes

Some problems dealing with figures reguire
slide rules and in other problems the rules
slide to one reguirement—scantiness.
One designer of play clothes explained his
theory of bathing suit like this:
"A swim suit is not draped on the body—it's
an engineering proposition."
LAST YEAR'S attempt to make swim suits
beruffled and beskirted did not meet with suc
cess. Women—especially at Stanford—want
"sunnable" and "swimmable" suits. There
fore, most popular suit models are strapless
one-piecers.
Midriffs have not been neglected, however.
One design entitled "Black Magic" is fash-

ioned entirely without vertical seams to per
fect the fit.
TO ACCOMPANY the scantiness of the new
suits will go beach coats and capes in gay
contrasting colors or prints. Some are the
perennial terry cloth, and some of washable
pigue — just right to protect the Stanford
maiden from the Rio del Mar sun.
An inspiration from the seven seas has pro
vided sail-cloth trousers and skirts, which have
been "reefed in" with international signal code
swim suits, carrying such messages as "Send
me a line," or "Reguire pilot" in colored flags.
For spring weekend picnics in the Stanford
hills, pastel denim outfits even carry out the
"bare and beautiful" motif.
PEDAL PUSHERS with halters to match,
skirts with camisoles and straight shorts are
some of the more popular models. Patch
pockets in eyelet embroidery set these outfits
off.
Three-piece convertibles styled of table
linens have a triple call—the beach, picnics,
and for classroom. Heavier than handkerchief
linen and guite crease resistant, these shorts
blouse-skirt companions are timeless favorites.
Another variation for transition from beach
cover-to-uncover is a long-sleeved jersey pull
over blouse to top brief shorts and halter.
BARE TO THE TOES-even foot coverings
have a minimum of material this year. Thonged
sandals with heavy leather soles in multi
colors can be worn with anything from bathing
suits to cottons.
Another casual bag for beach use that sheds
water like a duck is made of cork, with strap
handles of calfskin.
There're no ups and downs for CAROLYN COMAFORD who wears a
cool beige and yellow sunback with matching stole from BRYANT'S.
Center, quite a match for any tennis date, is CAROL CLAYTOR in corded
cotton gabardine shorts and gay striped T shirt. All set off by a jaunty
red bib cap from ]. C. PENNEY'S. It's no chore to rake the lawn, says
ENID HOLT, below, wearing blue cotton pedal pushers from YOUNG
COLONY. Her wide-collared checked Riviera blouse is definitely right
for gardening days.



SARA LEE CANFIELD will be
sliding high in her blue and
white sunback. This rayon tie
silk from LUNDIN-McBRIDE
has a tailored jacket with
large pearl buttons. Another
"topper" is JEAN NORD
STROM in grey whipcord
frontier pants, man-tailored
blouse, and corduroy weskit
from ROOS BROS.
