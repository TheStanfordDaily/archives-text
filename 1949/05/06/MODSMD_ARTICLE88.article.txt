# What, No Jop? Femmes Caught in Clip Craze
## 
### CARYL HARMS 
Spring at Stanford has always brought an
epidemic of clipped tresses. This year, aided
by the dictates of fashion, about seventy-five
per cent of the campus coeds are becoming
light-headed.
MEN DON'T LIKE short hair, the surveys
show, but masculine protests mean little when
women begin clipping at a merry pace.
The short coiffure is not flattering to every
woman; but, most disgruntled roughs who
moan over the skinned effect should be grate
ful for modern variety provided by the bar
bershop guorum.
STANFORD MALES of the last century
weren't so lucky. Old photographs show doz
ens of Indian maids trimmed and marcelled
exactly alike. Especially in the flapper era, the
bob and front wave were absolute monarchs
of fashion.
Hair styles were brief, if not quite so iden
tical, when Stanford beyan, too. Most of the
1894 damsels preferred an electrified look
that featured short, frizzy curls all around.
At the turn of the century, long tresses were
the thing, tied back with a huge bow—a defi
nite part of the tandem bicycle and bloomer
girl age.
WHILE FLAPPER bobs have been initiated
recently, no one has yet returned to the popu
lar coiffure of the Twenties. A few short
strands of hair barely covering the ears, with
the rest of the locks gathered into a peak on
the top of the head.
Men of today would like styles of eight or
ten years ago best. Then, the coeds wore
their long tresses in a simple hair-do that is
still popular with the more conservative ele
ment in Stanford's female population.
But whatever the reason—fashion, conven
ience, or summer—and whatever style she
chooses, the Stanford femme seems deter
mined on short hair. Whacked off by a scis
sors-mad roommate, or carefully shaped by
Pierre, her locks are falling.
