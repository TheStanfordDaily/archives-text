# Spring Cotton Promenade
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
It's "ladies in the center" for the square
dance of Stanford spring cottons. And this
season the Stanford "ladies" take more than a
fashionable turn around Quad in swirling cot
ton skirts and folk dance dresses.
Cotton creations inspired by old Dutch and
English folk costumes are taking the prome
nade lead. The Dutch version utilizes a low
cut white front piece nestled into the deep
oval neckline of a bright-bodiced, full-skirted
cotton.
THE ENGLISH STYLE adds wide strips of
material over each shoulder which are nipped
in as they join the ever-popular dirndl. This
semi-jumper is worn both with Gibson girl
and high-necked peasant blouses.
Men will circle 'round the gal attired in this
year's striking bolero and sun dress separates.
Strapless sun dresses with matching stole or
low square-necked and open-midriff dresses
banded with pique will find their way to class
or to the Boathouse.
The summer shirtmaker with cap sleeves,
small turn-over collar, and buttoned down the
front bodice is back on campus this year with

emphasis upon the peplum effect and deep
ened yoke. Styling is achieved by addition of
quilting, merry-go-round cording, or contrasts
of vertical and horizontal stripes.
TWO NEW MATERIALS varying the shirt
front bodice, is back on campus this year with
quilting, merry-go-round cording, or contrasts
maker are the iridescent and Resloom proc
esses. Dates will swing with partners garbed
in shocking, shimmering dresses of electric
blue or violet which give a "now-you-see-it—
now-you-don't" effect. The Resloom non
wrinkling process used for many patterns is a
great convenience for the busy coed.
HARNESSED TO ONE side of many of the
flared cotton skirts are the large lasso pock
ets in contrasting colors or piping. Great
patch and slash pockets also add diversion to
many of the tailored casuals.
Necklines on these Quad cottons look wide
and cool, sleeves are almost non-existent and
there are sashes galore.
When the caller begins his square dance
rounds, there'll be a Stanford gal in cotton
bowing to her neighbor.




Swing those cottons round and round. MAXIMINA RAEL and BETTY KLOPSCH
swirl, left, in the square dance. Moxy's tiered cotton moon-star print is from
ROOS BROS. Betty's green checked cotton with the swirling skirt is from PHELPS
TERKEL. A four yard fortune has BARBARA JUDSON, above, in a red, two-pieced
peasant ensemble from LOIS FOWLER. For that spring study session on the
Libe Lawn, JANEY ROHRER wears a gray chambray cotton with a pert collar from
BRYANT'S.

HENSHAW is really sunning in Union Court patio in a rosebud
print peasant skirt with scalloped hemline. Her white rayon
blouse gathered daintily with black ribbon. SUE BERRY'S. '


Good for firechasing or siren blowing, this casual cotton from
YOUNG COLONY worn by BETTY COLKETT has a diagonal
striped skirt and nipped-in corded waistline. Framed in tradi-

tional sandstone, JOAN LIPPMAN wears a simple navy
butcher linen with a softly gathered skirt with lime V accents.

Good for firechasing or siren blowing, this casual cotton from
YOUNG COLONY worn by BETTY COLKETT has a diagonal
striped skirt and nipped-in corded waistline. Framed in tradi-

tional sandstone, JOAN LIPPMAN wears a simple navy
butcher linen with a softly gathered skirt with lime V accents.
From SUE BERRY'S. Looks like a tropical setting, but TOMMY
It's "ladies in the center" for the square
dance of Stanford spring cottons. And this
season the Stanford "ladies" take more than a
fashionable turn around Quad in swirling cot
ton skirts and folk dance dresses.
Cotton creations inspired by old Dutch and
English folk costumes are taking the prome
nade lead. The Dutch version utilizes a low
cut white front piece nestled into the deep
oval neckline of a bright-bodiced, full-skirted
cotton.
THE ENGLISH STYLE adds wide strips of
material over each shoulder which are nipped
in as they join the ever-popular dirndl. This
semi-jumper is worn both with Gibson girl
and high-necked peasant blouses.
Men will circle 'round the gal attired in this
year's striking bolero and sun dress separates.
Strapless sun dresses with matching stole or
low square-necked and open-midriff dresses
banded with pique will find their way to class
or to the Boathouse.
The summer shirtmaker with cap sleeves,
small turn-over collar, and buttoned down the
front bodice is back on campus this year with

emphasis upon the peplum effect and deep
ened yoke. Styling is achieved by addition of
quilting, merry-go-round cording, or contrasts
of vertical and horizontal stripes.
TWO NEW MATERIALS varying the shirt
front bodice, is back on campus this year with
quilting, merry-go-round cording, or contrasts
maker are the iridescent and Resloom proc
esses. Dates will swing with partners garbed
in shocking, shimmering dresses of electric
blue or violet which give a "now-you-see-it—
now-you-don't" effect. The Resloom non
wrinkling process used for many patterns is a
great convenience for the busy coed.
HARNESSED TO ONE side of many of the
flared cotton skirts are the large lasso pock
ets in contrasting colors or piping. Great
patch and slash pockets also add diversion to
many of the tailored casuals.
Necklines on these Quad cottons look wide
and cool, sleeves are almost non-existent and
there are sashes galore.
When the caller begins his square dance
rounds, there'll be a Stanford gal in cotton
bowing to her neighbor.




Swing those cottons round and round. MAXIMINA RAEL and BETTY KLOPSCH
swirl, left, in the square dance. Moxy's tiered cotton moon-star print is from
ROOS BROS. Betty's green checked cotton with the swirling skirt is from PHELPS
TERKEL. A four yard fortune has BARBARA JUDSON, above, in a red, two-pieced
peasant ensemble from LOIS FOWLER. For that spring study session on the
Libe Lawn, JANEY ROHRER wears a gray chambray cotton with a pert collar from
BRYANT'S.

HENSHAW is really sunning in Union Court patio in a rosebud
print peasant skirt with scalloped hemline. Her white rayon
blouse gathered daintily with black ribbon. SUE BERRY'S. '
