It's check and double check for spring suits
that are City-bound.
The short jacket and full skirt are still on
the season schedule as are the more sporty
belted-in coat and straight skirt. Tiny hounds
tooth checks in light woolens take the Stan
ford spotlight, along with the new double
collar.
FARM MAIDENS will find buttons, buttons,
and more buttons adorning all of this season's
fashions. Fancy, plain, fabric buttons decorate
the skirt panels and coat backs.
The perennial knit suit comes forth this sea
son in a variety of new colors, accenting pastel
shades. On the Farm, knits are all-day com
panions from morning shopping in San Fran
cisco to dinner date at Vanessi's.
Suits are teamed up with matching or con
trasting coats. If the suit is plaid or checked,
the coat may be plain with matching lining of
taffeta or other eye-catching fabrics.
HORSE-BLANKET plaids cover more than
horses this year. These bright plaids are found
in tailored coats fashioned after men's great
coats. Coats swing high, wide, and handsome
or are smooth-fitting like the princess mode of
a few years past.
One tricky smart-shopper this season is a
navy blue gabardine suit. Its jacket is bulk
(straight-hanging or belted) above a string
bean skirt. Just right with white touches at
the neck and cuff.
TRICKS, HIGH COLORS and strangs cuts
are not in high fashion now. Quiet quality
in a durable fabric is the wearer's goal—and
fashionable, too.
Fashions for this spring seem to have
two completely opposite views—bright col
ors, loud plaids, free-swinging coats that give
casual air vs. tiny checks, navy blue, and
princess styles which provide an aura of femi
ninity.
THE TRIM COAT-DRESS, fashioned from
rich taffeta, novelty wool, or light silk fabric






Caught counter shopping at Gump's is JANE HAMMOND
in a spring outfit from JOSEPH MAGNIN'S. Her dress, a
smart navy cotton with a new plunging neckline and
wide cuffed sleeves. Her coat, a voguish red shorty with
sloping shoulders. And her hat, a navy cloche with a
white brim. Fisherman's Wharf is a favorite Stanford
stopping off place. ANN HINSDALE has a right feeling
about her full skirted Mexican print from LIVINGSTON'S.
A natural straw hat and matching straw bag complete
the picture. Lunching on Maiden's Lane is ROBIN
MOSHER in a pale green one piece knit dress from
CAROLYN KELSEY'S.


They're on their way via San Francisco's famous cable car. Glen
plaids go well anywhere. Especially this softly tailored CAROLYN
KELSEY suit worn by NANCY LURITZEN, iar left. Self-covered but
tons and a clover-leaf neckline distinguish the jacket. JOANNE
HARPER is ready for a busy day in the City with her gabardine suit
from JOSEPH MAGNIN. Her white jacket with contrasting buttons
and rolled collar set off the well-tailored gored brown skirt. A brown

Caught counter shopping at Gump's is JANE HAMMOND
in a spring outfit from JOSEPH MAGNIN'S. Her dress, a
smart navy cotton with a new plunging neckline and
wide cuffed sleeves. Her coat, a voguish red shorty with
sloping shoulders. And her hat, a navy cloche with a
white brim. Fisherman's Wharf is a favorite Stanford
stopping off place. ANN HINSDALE has a right feeling
about her full skirted Mexican print from LIVINGSTON'S.
A natural straw hat and matching straw bag complete
the picture. Lunching on Maiden's Lane is ROBIN
MOSHER in a pale green one piece knit dress from
CAROLYN KELSEY'S.


They're on their way via San Francisco's famous cable car. Glen
plaids go well anywhere. Especially this softly tailored CAROLYN
KELSEY suit worn by NANCY LURITZEN, iar left. Self-covered but
tons and a clover-leaf neckline distinguish the jacket. JOANNE
HARPER is ready for a busy day in the City with her gabardine suit
from JOSEPH MAGNIN. Her white jacket with contrasting buttons
and rolled collar set off the well-tailored gored brown skirt. A brown

It's check and double check for spring suits
that are City-bound.
The short jacket and full skirt are still on
the season schedule as are the more sporty
belted-in coat and straight skirt. Tiny hounds
tooth checks in light woolens take the Stan
ford spotlight, along with the new double
collar.
FARM MAIDENS will find buttons, buttons,
and more buttons adorning all of this season's
fashions. Fancy, plain, fabric buttons decorate
the skirt panels and coat backs.
The perennial knit suit comes forth this sea
son in a variety of new colors, accenting pastel
shades. On the Farm, knits are all-day com
panions from morning shopping in San Fran
cisco to dinner date at Vanessi's.
Suits are teamed up with matching or con
trasting coats. If the suit is plaid or checked,
the coat may be plain with matching lining of
taffeta or other eye-catching fabrics.
HORSE-BLANKET plaids cover more than
horses this year. These bright plaids are found
in tailored coats fashioned after men's great
coats. Coats swing high, wide, and handsome
or are smooth-fitting like the princess mode of
a few years past.
One tricky smart-shopper this season is a
navy blue gabardine suit. Its jacket is bulk
(straight-hanging or belted) above a string
bean skirt. Just right with white touches at
the neck and cuff.
TRICKS, HIGH COLORS and strangs cuts
are not in high fashion now. Quiet quality
in a durable fabric is the wearer's goal—and
fashionable, too.
Fashions for this spring seem to have
two completely opposite views—bright col
ors, loud plaids, free-swinging coats that give
casual air vs. tiny checks, navy blue, and
princess styles which provide an aura of femi
ninity.
