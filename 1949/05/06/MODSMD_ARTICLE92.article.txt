Next to nothing—that's what coeds' hats will
be this spring. The pert short coiffures which
have hit the campus call for these small off
the-face chapeaux.
Simple, trim, and uncluttered is the word.
Fashion requirements for the 1949 spring bon
net are natural or pale banana yellow straws
with a touch of velvet, a feather, or a small
cluster of flowers. The small, head-hugging
cloches continues as the hat for casual and
suit wear.
HAT DESIGNERS say, "It's not what you
wear, but how you wear it." The cleverly
curled or small rolled brims can be manipu
lated to fit the individual face.
Small round crowns, telescope crowns and
high flower pot shapes add simple variation.
More shape variations can be found in the gay
vicornes, tricornes, turbans, early American
bonnets, and side-slanted sailor hats.
A NEW HATTIE CARNEGIE creation is the
wig hat. It is made of shiny straw which looks
like floss of hair and is twisted on top of the
head. This daring number reportedly would
be made in colors to match the wearer's own
coiffure.
