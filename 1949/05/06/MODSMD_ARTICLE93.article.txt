# Prints on Your Mind?
## Forty-Niner Patterns Are Versatile 
### MARGE SAMPSON 
Polka dots and sheer materials
highlight the summer print season
this year. Stanfordites are blossom
ing out in demure organdy, gay
tulle, and all the other spring-like
materials.
Gone are the strictly tailored sum
mer dresses, and in comes the lightly
feminine charm of wispy organdy.
BUT IT ISN'T the season for the
pastel shades as in past years—these
lighter hues have given way to the
now-popular dark prints. Rich, darkly
muted colors in neat, tiny patterns
are twice as important as ever before.
Golds, dark greens, navy, brown and

black, and contrasted with red,
should top the wardrobe list this
season.
And to frame the face, with a plain
color, a white pique yoke will set off
a tan to perfection.
Two-piecers are so wonderfully
versatile—skirts and tops can be
worn together or can go their own
separate ways just as well. Tops in
a contrasting color will offset the ef
fect of the skirt.
ON THE DRESSIER side are full,
organdy skirts, either very low cut,
or strapless. The most popular or
gandy is the dark background with
the irregular white polka dots. The
print fashions of the 1939 era seem to
be coming to the fore.
Soft crepes are back, ditto lovely
chiffons, and prints are being
planned on geometric motifs. As for
silhouette both slim and flared skirts
are in vogue, but slender waist styles
are a must in collegiate styles.
NEW SHOWINGS of light summer
prints and fabrics by Los Angeles
designers featured a new series of
colors—ice cream colors, which in
cluded banana, strawberry, pistachio,
and caramel cream. In the prints,
flowered designs were less promi
nent than in previous years.
Even prints, but especially suits,
have become sophisticated. With
the loss of prominence of pastel
shades has come a more seductive
flare to spring clothes.
ONE DESIGNER has produced
cottons styled like silks to highlight
silken elegance. Frequent print,
check or stripes with plain in striking
combination give the line a custom
look.
A scoop-necked, checked gingham
in maize and black has a slim skirt
draped back to a huge gingham bow
and back of one hip.
Criss-cross, a dress of forest green
cotton taffeta, has insets of red and
white print set into the skirt's side
seams to repeat collar and pocket
trim.
For a last bit of advice, experts
suggest that women choose their
prints carefully for their simple, but
feminine charm, and that colors be
selected to set off the figure.

Summer swirls in black on dark
qreen background, is the silk
print chosen by pensive MAUI

side flare soltens the tailored

Polka dots and sheer materials
highlight the summer print season
this year. Stanfordites are blossom
ing out in demure organdy, gay
tulle, and all the other spring-like
materials.
Gone are the strictly tailored sum
mer dresses, and in comes the lightly
feminine charm of wispy organdy.
BUT IT ISN'T the season for the
pastel shades as in past years—these
lighter hues have given way to the
now-popular dark prints. Rich, darkly
muted colors in neat, tiny patterns
are twice as important as ever before.
Golds, dark greens, navy, brown and

black, and contrasted with red,
should top the wardrobe list this
season.
And to frame the face, with a plain
color, a white pique yoke will set off
a tan to perfection.
Two-piecers are so wonderfully
versatile—skirts and tops can be
worn together or can go their own
separate ways just as well. Tops in
a contrasting color will offset the ef
fect of the skirt.
ON THE DRESSIER side are full,
organdy skirts, either very low cut,
or strapless. The most popular or
gandy is the dark background with
the irregular white polka dots. The
print fashions of the 1939 era seem to
be coming to the fore.
Soft crepes are back, ditto lovely
chiffons, and prints are being
planned on geometric motifs. As for
silhouette both slim and flared skirts
are in vogue, but slender waist styles
are a must in collegiate styles.
NEW SHOWINGS of light summer
prints and fabrics by Los Angeles
designers featured a new series of
colors—ice cream colors, which in
cluded banana, strawberry, pistachio,
and caramel cream. In the prints,
flowered designs were less promi
nent than in previous years.
Even prints, but especially suits,
have become sophisticated. With
the loss of prominence of pastel
shades has come a more seductive
flare to spring clothes.
ONE DESIGNER has produced
cottons styled like silks to highlight
silken elegance. Frequent print,
check or stripes with plain in striking
combination give the line a custom
look.
A scoop-necked, checked gingham
in maize and black has a slim skirt
draped back to a huge gingham bow
and back of one hip.
Criss-cross, a dress of forest green
cotton taffeta, has insets of red and
white print set into the skirt's side
seams to repeat collar and pocket
trim.
For a last bit of advice, experts
suggest that women choose their
prints carefully for their simple, but
feminine charm, and that colors be
selected to set off the figure.
