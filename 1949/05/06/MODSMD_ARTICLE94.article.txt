Femininity attained through simplicity key
notes evening fashions for the Stanford belle
this spring. Fashion experts advise the Stan
ford women to let the simple, soft lines of
summer fabrics emphasize their natural
charm.
Yards of dainty cotton organdy and eyelet
gathered to a fitted strapless bodice set the
basic pattern. For variations, classic off-the
shoulder necklines top the bodice. Necklines
are outlined with a plain cuff or are faced—
perfectly plain, with scallops, or in a sweet
heart neckline.
BILLOWING SKIRTS make the most of the
lovely spring sheers—printed, plain, or em
broidered organdy, dotted swiss, marquisette,
and even some soft chiffon.
Bustling taffeta will be heard on the dance
floor this spring, too. Many of the sheer for
mals have matching or complimentary colored
petticoats.
Pastel colors follow the dainty feminine
trends, although many of the striking new
formals—the eyelets, laces, chiffons, and even
some of the organdies—are deep shades of
peach, rose, or green.
FABRICS SUCH AS waxed mousseline
shading from mauve to gold and line print
chiffons in pastels make the new evening
gowns more spectacular.


Through the looking glass there's SKIPPY BRAND in a black
and white fantasy. She wears a strapless cotton taffeta formal
with tiered skirt from WALSTER'S.


Sophisticated from tan to toe KATIE ORME in a smooth se
quined evening dress. The full skirt is of pale pink net with
a pale blue underskirt. From REPEAT PERFORMANCE.
