# After Five: Date-wise Stanfordites Choose Feminine Dresses
## 
### MARGIE COYKENDALL 
When a Stanford maiden goes dancing
"down the highway" or to the City for a
Saturday night special, her best dressy dress
has a whirl.
But this spring her skirts no longer flare out
extremely full from the waist nor will her hips
be padded. Instead, she will have a delicate
feminine look with moderately-rounded shoul
der, soft draped effects, with a well-defined
waist line.
AND HER DRESSES are getting shorter.
Although designers are varying their crea
tions from nine to thirteen inches from the
floor, fourteen inches is popular for daytime
and twelve for more dressy gowns. Formal
lengths are varied.
New spring colors are not the once sugar
sweet Easter tones, but are striking and gay.
Navy is especially popular and is often seen
combined with bright red or polka dot ma
terial. Vivid shades are emerald green, pea
cock blue, brick red, gold, cocoa, purple, and

royal. Unusual combinations—deep violet
with light Persian green, pale agua against a
changeable fabric of violet and green—are
found in newer date dresses.
FILMY SHEER FABRICS enhance the femi
ninity of the Farm femme. Rustles of imported
silk and taffeta faille for dancing dresses will
add glamor to the evening. For those "after
five" appointments, shantung, linen, sheer
spun rayon, eyelet and ribbon faille will trans
form her into a dream date.
To add a crisp look to plain colored dresses,
collars of white pigue and organdy are often
used with buttons, bright sashes and belts for
a decorative effect.
A SPRING "NEW LOOKER" is the "Renais
sance sleeve." This sleeve has drapery from
the deep armhole to the elbow and fits tightly
from elbow to wrist giving softness above the
belt. Short and long, three-guarter and almost
elbow-length sleeves are also stylish.
Changeable as spring weather are the new
jackets and boleros, used with any outfit from

simple wash dresses to elaborate evening
gowns. Fly-away boleros are posed over
frocks with slightly flared skirts; fitted boleros
are added to slim-skirted dresses; box or hip
bone-length jackets are combined with small
capes for narrow skirts.
MANY DRESSES HAVE short jackets which
when removed reveal bodices in contrasting
fabrics. Designers use brief boleros and wraps
above skirts or tiered effects trimmed with
lace or taffeta edges or more formal dresses.
Sculptured princess lines which flatter the
figure have returned. Combined with the
Empire silhouette, this style is the majesty
of simplicity, using no buttons, belts or bows.
STANFORD COEDS PAY little attention to
fashion demands for a "silhouette," so will
fall easily into laissez-faire attitude of this
spring's soft creations. One may choose slim
or medium-full skirted outline, but the waist is
small, even though unstrangled. Often it is
sashed, sometimes fully belted.



LYNN WARD is all ready for the big night at LONGBARN in
her silk faille cocktail dress from JOSEPH MAGNIN. Special
with slit pockets, covered buttons, and sloped V neckline.

Demure KATHIE MOORE is sure to look smart in her YOUNG
COLONY cotton formal with eyelet trim on the neckline and
a peplum effect. Alluring that's ELLEN FAIRFIELD in her


black lace dress from LUNDIN McBRIDE. This cocktail dress
has a rustling black skirt with wide black lace inserts. Her
black lace blouse top over faille has a boat neckline.
