# Roughs Remain Reactionary

### JIM HAGGART 
Coming of spring to the Farm may have
numerous implications to style - conscious
Stanford femmes, but the same cannot be said
of the typical rough.
With the advent of warm April days he does
shed his left-over GI jacket, but his emerging
attire is almost the same in May as it is in
December.
THE CRY OF the "Bold Look" remains un
heeded by the average rough, who is much
more interested in economy and utility in his
spring wear.
"Casual" seems to be the key word on cam
pus with Levis, washed-out cords, and khaki

pants continuing to dominate. However, more
is being seen of pre-war flannel slacks, espe
cially in grays.
Sweaters remain popular, despite the high
cost of cleaning bills. Cashmeres, at $25 a
throw, are rare but nevertheless stylish. Even
though Esguire has ballyhooed the crew neck,
the V-neck pullover is still prevalent.
Southern California collegiate fashion
sharks predicted brighter and gaudier sport
shirts for this year—with the accent on yel
lows. Prints, stripes, and plain colors will be
egually acceptable in either lonq or short
sleeved styles.
ARGYLES ARE STILL in fashion, with the
trend toward larger diamonds. Cotton models
have proved more practical for Stanford spring
wear.
For date wear, fashion designers have as
yet devised no revolutionary reply to plunging
necklines and tent-like skirts, a return to yes
terday's fashions is apparent with the return
of pleated and belted backs in sport coats.
THE ECONOMY-MINDED rough can still
be abreast of the latest fashion by assembling
a versatile wardrobe of several sport jackets
and harmonizing neutral slacks. Corduroy
sport jackets with innumerable patch pockets
are the masculine "buy" of the season.
About the only concession to the "new look"
is the rough's adoption of the wide and stubby
collared shirt which adapts itself easily to a
bulky Windsor knot.
