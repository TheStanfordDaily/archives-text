# Hasher's Lament
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
Woman is a problem
As baffling as can be;
Ever since the ape-man,
Man's been up a tree.
For years he has been searching
To see what makes her tick;
But either he adores her,
Or else she makes him sick.
As for the Indian coed,
The Stanford Roughs have stated;
"How can we get to know her,
When she is always dated?"
What! Understand the Farm girls-
And yet, it has been done;
For men who know the women best
Are hashers, two to one.
A Roble bus-boy comments,
"The gals look fine at first;
But as the quarter moves along,
They all get worse and worse.
And by the time it's dead-week,
The coeds are a sight;
That's when I'm really grateful
For meals by candlelight."
Another Stanford hasher,
When asked to speak his part
Said, "Those engaged to Roth girls
Should take these words to heart.
After you have wed her,
And it's too late to shirk,
Sleep late in the morning
'Til she has gone to work."
Another student hasher
From Cubberley, confesses:
"The gals look good at dinner time;
At breakfast, they are messes."
"But are you disillusioned?"
We asked this forlorn mister.
"Heck no," he said, "I'm used to it,
I've got a little sister."
Yet though the hashers all agree,
That breakfast is a sight;
They still call up the girls they serve,
For dates on Saturday night.
Said they, "Though we complain at times,
There's no cause for alarm;
For you can bet we're mighty glad
There're coeds on the Farm."
