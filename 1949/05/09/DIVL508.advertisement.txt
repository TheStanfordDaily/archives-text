Wha Hoppin'
Perhaps you are wondering why I am a WRITE-IN
candidate for ASSU Vice-president after having de
clined last week. I sincerely wanted the office all
along, but Tuesday I declined knowing I was unable at
the time to prepare for the primaries. Fewer obliga
tions plus the fact that I would have qualified for the
final elections gives me the opportunity to run as a
WRITE-IN candidate for ASSU Vice-president.
