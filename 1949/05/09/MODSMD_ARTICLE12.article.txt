Wham! Pow! Urrrk! Da' Chap
pies has done it again! Th' giants
of the comic magazine field labored
and brought forth the "Crash Com
ics" issue which will hit both read
er and newsstand on Wednesday.
Says Editor Gil Wheat: "We of
the Chaparral recognize that the
average issue contains numerous
words of more than one syllable.
There have been complaints from
students which have led us to be
lieve that simplification of the
printed text will enable the major
ity- of the student body to more com
pletely understand the rotten sheet.
For this reason, we're gonna' sub
stitute pitcha'sâ€”funny pitcha's of
a highly amusin' type."
Trot down to the familiar booths
next Wednesday and plunk down
your two-bits! You will bo reward
ed with a series of jollies which will
make life between parties more
bearable.
