# 'The Happy Bride' Sets New Low for Pictures
## 
### AL BERRY 
"The Happy Bride," which is cur
rently being displayed with the
Guild Theater's "all - Soviet pro
gram," is not a good motion pic
ture. It is not entertaining. It is
not worth seeing.
With the exception of some un
usual color technique, and some
even more unusual political phi
losophy, "The Bride"—happy or not
—is exactly one hour and 12 min
utes of boredom, familiar plot, and
remarkably bad acting.
The plot takes place in Moscow
in 1814, just after the Russians have
single-handedly smashed Napoleon.
All the Russian troops are getting
married, but our hero—a lieutenant
—is not interested in getting mar
ried, because he is in love with the
collective city of Moscow. Then our
hero, who looks like a third-rate
Spanish gigolo, meets the lovely
leading lady, who possesses all the
charm and grace of a mature sow.
They fall in love, presumably be
cause of their common love of the
city. The heroine is about to in
herit a great deal of money IF she
marries a man whose initials are
A. F. If she does not marry said
man all her inheritance must go to

the city of Moscow. The hero's ini
tials are A. P.
Obviously the picture might have
some interest to Americans because
of its philnsonhical content. But it
is so poorly done —acting, scripting,
curecung, etcmg—that the audience
is collectively waiting with eager
anticipation for the news reel to
start.
"Triumph of Youth"
The Guild's "all-Soviet program"
does have one very definite saving
grace, however. That is a 40-min
ute "short" called "Triumph of
Youth." which is a color record of
the 1947 Soviet "Olympic Games"
held in Moscow.
Men. women, and children from
all over Russia took part in these
"games," which consisted of mass
calisthenics that were really mass—
thousands at a time. While the
short was excellent, and the spec
tacle sometimes breathtaking, it was
at the same time slightly sickening.
Those who remember the news
reels of the German Youth Show in
Nuremberg in the 1930's will have
the feeling of having seen this "Tri
umph of Youth" before.
Everything is the same—the mass
show of regimented strength, the
little kids crying frenzied allegiance
to the leader, the muscular brown
bodies twisting in beautiful yet hor
rifying unison to portray the glory
and power of the state. Only the
color of the flags and the faces of
the leaders are different. This short,
in itself, is quite an experience.
