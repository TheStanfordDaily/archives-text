## Late Leave Plan 
### 
Tonight on-campus women will vote on a new late leave dis
tribution plan. Just what does the plan mean? First, women will
have more late leaves. Second, they will have more freedom
to choose when to take their late leaves. Third, late leaves will
increase in proportion to class standing.
The AWS Cabinet has devised a good plan. Not only will j
women get more late leaves, but they can judge for themselves
Â«.vhen to take these late leaves.
Included in the plan is a clause restricting the number of late
leaves first guarter freshman women may take each week. Al
though this clause seems to conflict with the over-all plan, it is
justified. University life, both academic and social, is often con- ;
fusing and strange to entering freshman women. This regulation
will guide freshman women in the apportionment of their time.
We compliment the AWS Cabinet and the AWS Social Regu
lations Committee on presenting Stanford women a plan that
seems to be workable and easy to understand.
