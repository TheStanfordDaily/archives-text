## 'Mouldie' Music 
### 
To the Editor:
There's a new kind of battle now going on in a certain room over in
Encina.
It is between two members of an aggregation known as "The Mouldies."
These same two inmates of aforementioned cell were the nucleus. Let's
call them Moukiie No. 1 and Mouldie No. 2. The group i»rew by accretion,
until now it includes a number of the more unsavory characters on cam
pus. Roughly speaking, they could, one and all, qualify without effort as
Stanford "Roughs."
It seems that one day last week, Mouldie No. 2 bought himself a ukc
lele. The romance of "Stanford in the Spring" was doing things to his
xed corpuscles. He was determined to do his lovemaking in traditional
tityle— to the tune of a "uke."
Next day, Mouldie No. 2 turns up with a guitar! The motive in this
case is open to conjecture.
There they are, each in his cell corner, sitting and strumming. If you
should pass that way and hear what sounds like someone committing may
hem on "Holiday for Strings," don't walk—run to the nearest exit. The
furious noises are being made by those two strum-bums, strumming
rnadly away at each other.
Murder would seem to be the only logical conclusion. I'm just wonder
ing if the jury's verdict will read "self-defense" or "temporary derange
ment due to string-madness?"
