# Irregular Off-Campus Enthusiasm

To the Editor:
Duiing the recent constitutional elections, a great many gripes were
heard from off-campus students concerning their Excom representation. In
view ol the fact that they comprise about one-half of the student body
i umerically, they wondered why their representation was cut to one
Member.
In last Thursday's primary election, a primary was held for the position
of Off-Campus Excom. The one position held on Excom by off-campus
students should now be far more important than ever before. Certainly,
the off-campus vote should have been large.
Less than 10 per cent of off-campus students voted for their repre
sentative.
