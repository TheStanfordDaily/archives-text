# LA's Old Game

### 
To the Editor:
I noticed an AP report in Tuesday's paper that Stella Walsh, running
in the Coliseum Relays, was the winner of the broad jump at the 1932
Olympics.
I was a sports technical at these Olympics, and I know that there was
no women's broad jump. I.s this just another Los Angeles publicity stunt?
