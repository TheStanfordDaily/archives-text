(Editor's Note: The following
statement on Stanford's Institute
of International Relations was
made by Milton S. Eisenhower,
chairman of the U.S. National
Commission for UNESCO.)
The crucial problem facing man
kind today is the problem of making
peace—a peace which is not merely
a temporary truce between armed
antagonists, but a just, permanent,
and creative world order.
As I see it a genuine and perma
nent peace has three requirements:
1. Understanding — the peoples of
•he world must learn to know one
another, to understand each other's
problems, cultures, and laws.
2. Economic and Social Arrange
ments— economic and social justice
is certainly indispensable to a just
and creative world order.
3. Force — no international organ
ization can keep the peace unless it
has sufficient force to impose its
laws upon those who would wilfully
break them?
Of these three conditions of peace,
understanding is prior. Without it,
we cannot make the social and eco
nomic arrangements which are re
quired, and we could certainly not
revise the United Nations Charter
to give the UN the limited coercive
force which it must have. In other
words, we need education for
world citizenship.
And I know of no student body
which is doing more to educate
itself for world citizenship than
the student body of Stanford Uni
versity. Through the Institute of
International Relations, Stanford
students are doing a job which
might well be imitated bv other
schools throughout the land. Per
sonally. and as chairman of the
U.S. National Commission for
UNESCO. I offer to Stanford my
heartiest congratulations.
