## Bull Session 
### 
One ol (he topics which Bull Scssioners of past years have worked
over and over and over is the subject of Cellar coffee. (Example: Wayne
Sargents explanation ol making Cellar coffee:" "The Cellar makes its
coffee by having a small boy swim up the Sacramento River with one
coffee bean between his teeth!")
When I started "Bulling" in print instead of orally, 1 vowed that Cellar
coffee would be one subject about which I would never write. You may
now consider the following a retraction of that vow.
Gawd, but that coffee is lousy!
Something has got to be done about this. 1 don't know exactly what,
but something. Perhaps we could buy them a new bean or two. Or bet
ter still, maybe 1 could persuade Ted Norton to write a crusading "Letter
to the Editor," ripping Cellar coffee to shreds. (Heh, heh!)
But, alas, perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree. Maybe I am the only
one who thinks the coffee is no good. Perhaps you think it is great stuff
and wish I would make with more funny gags instead of writing about
coffee.
But. if you agree with me on the dubious quality of Cellar coffee, why
don't we make a little contest of it? Why don't you drop me a line here
at The Daily Shack finishing the following sentence in a million words
or less:
"I don't like Cellar coffee because—
It's a good chance for some of you campus wits to get your answers in
print, and it might be a lot of fun for everyone. I'll think of a prize of
some kind for the best entry and announce it later in the week. How
about it'.' "J don't like Cellar coffee because—:" Let's hear from you!

Last Week's Number One Quip:
The place: L'Ommie's . . . .the time—a half-hour after a formal dance
at our fraternity. I enter the bar; Frank Wolff sees me, sidles over, and
gives with:
"I understand you boys had a big dance at*your house tonight. Tell
me, which girl did you elect as the 'Sweetheart of Sigmund Freud'?"

Stanford's free health service plan is a wonderful thing. Perhaps the
best testimony to it is the fact that the students take it completely for
granted. Truly it's a fine plan, but. (gag) every once in a while the doc
tors prove that they too are only human and are quite capable of making
mistakes in diagnosis.
One of the local coeds stopped me on Quad the other day and gave
me a list of choice "diagnoses" that the health service had rendered for
friends of hers during the past months.
1. A girl spilled acid on her hand .... Diagnosis: Scabies.
2. Another girl caught a cold .... Diagnosis: Measles. She was put in
the isolation ward with eight girls who had measles and released the next
day. Ten days later she came down with the measles.
:i A fellow had a stomach ache .... Diagnosis: Sinus trouble. Three
hours later he had his appendix removed.
4. Another girl was hothered by constant headaches .... Diagnosis:
Homesickness. (Her home is two miles from Stanford.)
