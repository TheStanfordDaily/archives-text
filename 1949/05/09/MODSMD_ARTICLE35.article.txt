# Dutch Strengthen Indonesian Ties
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
In almost every Dutch classroom
you will find brown-faced, black- '
eyed children of mixed Dutch-Indo- ,
nesian origin. These thousands of 1

children, all over
Holland, are a liv
ing proof of the
solid ties between
the peoples (if the
Netherlands and
Indonesia.
There was a
time when the
Dutch Indies were
merely a colony.
No honest Dutch-

man will deny the Dutch East Indies
have in past times been a source
of wealth to the "motherland." On
the other hand, {he peoples of Indo
nesia have equally profited from
Dutch enterprise, medicine, and ad
ministration.
Dutch doctors dedicated their
lives to an unending battle against
tropical diseases. Dutch engineers
built waterworks, railroads, cities,
and factories. Dutch scicnti- 4 s had
their share in bettering the crops.
Dutch teachers brought knowledge
to thousands of analphabetic Indo
nesians.
What is not generally recognized
is that the Dutch did not simply act
as "colonials." They came to love
the land and the peoples of the im
mense archipelago l'or which they
were responsible.
To thousands of young and enter
prising Dutchmen, Indonesia be
came a second fatherland. They did
not go to Indonesia just to work
hard, gather wealth, and return to
the motherland in the shortest pi s
sible time (as their fathers had
done), but in growing numbers they
preferred to stay among the peace
ful and friendly population.
And as the number of young Indo
nesians who matriculated to the uni
versities of Holland steadily in
creased, so did the number of young
Dutchmen who married beautifvl.
intelligent young women of pure
Indonesion origin.
This explains the ever-increasing
numbei ui Duteh-InduncMi n chil

dren in Dutch classrooms. Treated
in exactly the same manner as chil
dren of purely Dutch birth, I hey feel
perfectly happy in Holland where
there has never been—and there
never will be—such a thing as race
discrimination.
All this means-there is a big. fun
damental difference in the relation
ship between Holland and Indonesia
than that which usually exists be
tween a "colonial nation" and its
colonies. The colonial spirit was
buried in Holland many years ago.
A better thing took its place—an
intricate pattern of social, cultural,
and economic relations, woven of
thousands of visible and invisible
ties which more and more linked
the two countries. There is hardly
a Dutchman who is not, some way
or other, connected with Indonesia.
However, the Dutch being a mod
ern, thoroughly democratic and pro
gressive-thinking nation, realized
all they had achieved in Indonesia
was not enough. They realized this
long before the Security Council ex
isted. Most Dutchmen strongly felt
they had a new task and a new duty
in Indonesia—to wipe out the last
traces which colonialism had left.
Long before the beginning of
World War 11, the relationship be
tween Indonesia and the Nether
lands became a matter of serious

consideration. The Indonesian intel
lectuals wanted more, and ultimately
complete political freedom.
The leading Dutch intellectuals
considei'ed this tendency justified
and inevitable, and they started
i studying the possibilities to give
shape to a new form of relationship
i between the Dutch and Indonesian
I friends.

not been the case, the new rela
