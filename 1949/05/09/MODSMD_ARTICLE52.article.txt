California—wire to wire.
The Olympic champion Golden
[ Bears from Berkeley rowed true to
; form last Saturday to sweep all
three races from Stanford in the
j first running of the Palo Alto Re
gatta.
Stanford's varsity shell, stag
j gered by the last - minute loss ot
| coxswain Johnny Dee, was never
I in the race, although the Cards
I made a game light of it and made
■ certain that there would be no Cali
j tornia run-away.
But the smooth - working Bears,
j rowing an easy 31 -stroke, opened
| two lengths on Stanford soon after
I the start, and then went on to hold
; that lead in spite of desperate In
i dian efforts in the last 500 yards.
Preceding the varsity run, Stan
lord JV's had dropped a four-length
battle to the Bears, and the Card
; frosh had lost a two-length fight.
California demonstrated great
| ability in getting off fast to an early
I lead, maintaining a regular stroke
I throughout the race, and then
breezing home in the final drive.
Next week the Olympic cham
pions meet Washington in an oar
battle that is expected to become
one of the most dynamic crew races
| of the year.
Last season. Washington defeated
California twice, both in their an
nual dual race and at the Pough
keepsie Regatta. But the Bears up
set the Huskies in the Olympic
trials and went on from there to be
come world champs.
Stanford also has another race
next week, as the Cards will invade
the Southland to match strokes
with USC.
, The Palo Alto course, although
j brand new to the Bears, didn't seem
to offer much trouble. The local
waterway seemed to go over very
well with the crowd who lined the
i banks for about 200 yards, and has
definite possibilities of becoming a
I site for regular regattas.
