# Card Nine Edges Bears To Break 17-Year Jinx
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Lefty Dave Dahle, although hampered by loose umpiring and
a determined bunch of Cal ballplayers, helped the Stanford var
sity to its first series win over California since "way back in
1932."
The final score of the game played in Edwards Field was 3 to 1.

Scattering nine hits and allowing
only one run, the Indian (linger was
complete master of the game. Even
better in the tight spots with men
on base, Dahle struck out nine
Bears.
Almost as effective was the "fu
ture pro star" Jackie Jensen. The
Golden Boy was tapped for 11 bin
gles. but the Indians bunched up
three hits in three different frames
to rack up the runs.
As for the umpiring, things could
not have been worse. The plate ump
was griped from the beginning, as
he sent two Cards out of the game.
Obviously poor decisions were made
against both nines, but tossing out
the third base coach for arguing in
the first inning and later Charlie
Cole for antics in the box hurt the
Indian cause.

Opening the game in grand style.
Charlie Cole smashed a hard-hit
blast through the second baseman.
The centerfielder bungled the ball
and Cole kept running, heading for
third. .There was a poor throw, and
with some smart coaching, Cole
scored.
Dick Clegg, who topped the plate
woi'k for both clubs with a fancy
three for four, and Dave Melton fol
lowed with hits in the initial in
ning, but the rally was choked on
a hotly disputed trapped ball in
centerfield.
In the fifth Cal collected its only
run. A hit by Hal Davies, a sacri
fice by Babe Danielson, and a smash
to center by Don Dodson accounted
for (he Bear tally.
Klein Collects Triple
Bud Klein connected with the best
hit ball of the game in the sixth.
The ball went all the way to the
fence, and Klein slid into third base
safely. Then John Schaefer, who
replaced Cole in center, dropped a
single into short left, scoring Klein.
Adding insurance in the next
frame, Arme was walked, Castagnoli
sacrificed, Dahle struck out, and
then Winterhalter slammed a single
to score Arce.
In a last vain attempt to get back
into the game, Cal started a ninth
inning rally. Jerry Silverstein and
Danielson got on base with singles,
but with two away Dahle made
Dodson hit an easy blooper in the
infield to end the rally and the
game.
Dahle, who was the winner over
Cal in an early contest and was
starting pitcher in the second Bear
tiff, was carried off the diamond by
his happy teammates.
The victory gave the Cards an
even .500 record in loop play, only
three games off the leading USC
Trojans. Tomorrow the Indians
meet Santa Clara, who remains a
half game ahead. Two games are
scheduled with the Trojans over the
weekend in Los Angeles.

DICK CLEGG, Indian first-base
man, raised his batting average to
40i> Saturday afternoon as he
hit three for four to lead Stanford
to a 3-1 victory over California.
Lefty Dave Dahle, although hampered by loose umpiring and
a determined bunch of Cal ballplayers, helped the Stanford var
sity to its first series win over California since "way back in
1932."
The final score of the game played in Edwards Field was 3 to 1.

Scattering nine hits and allowing
only one run, the Indian (linger was
complete master of the game. Even
better in the tight spots with men
on base, Dahle struck out nine
Bears.
Almost as effective was the "fu
ture pro star" Jackie Jensen. The
Golden Boy was tapped for 11 bin
gles. but the Indians bunched up
three hits in three different frames
to rack up the runs.
As for the umpiring, things could
not have been worse. The plate ump
was griped from the beginning, as
he sent two Cards out of the game.
Obviously poor decisions were made
against both nines, but tossing out
the third base coach for arguing in
the first inning and later Charlie
Cole for antics in the box hurt the
Indian cause.
CHigg Tops Stickers
Opening the game in grand style.
Charlie Cole smashed a hard-hit
blast through the second baseman.
The centerfielder bungled the ball
and Cole kept running, heading for
third. .There was a poor throw, and
with some smart coaching, Cole
scored.
Dick Clegg, who topped the plate
woi'k for both clubs with a fancy
three for four, and Dave Melton fol
lowed with hits in the initial in
ning, but the rally was choked on
a hotly disputed trapped ball in
centerfield.
In the fifth Cal collected its only
run. A hit by Hal Davies, a sacri
fice by Babe Danielson, and a smash
to center by Don Dodson accounted
for (he Bear tally.
Klein Collects Triple
Bud Klein connected with the best
hit ball of the game in the sixth.
The ball went all the way to the
fence, and Klein slid into third base
safely. Then John Schaefer, who
replaced Cole in center, dropped a
single into short left, scoring Klein.
Adding insurance in the next
frame, Arme was walked, Castagnoli
sacrificed, Dahle struck out, and
then Winterhalter slammed a single
to score Arce.
In a last vain attempt to get back
into the game, Cal started a ninth
inning rally. Jerry Silverstein and
Danielson got on base with singles,
but with two away Dahle made
Dodson hit an easy blooper in the
infield to end the rally and the
game.
Dahle, who was the winner over
Cal in an early contest and was
starting pitcher in the second Bear
tiff, was carried off the diamond by
his happy teammates.
The victory gave the Cards an
even .500 record in loop play, only
three games off the leading USC
Trojans. Tomorrow the Indians
meet Santa Clara, who remains a
half game ahead. Two games are
scheduled with the Trojans over the
weekend in Los Angeles.

scored.
Dick Clegg, who topped the plate
woi'k for both clubs with a fancy
three for four, and Dave Melton fol
lowed with hits in the initial in
ning, but the rally was choked on
a hotly disputed trapped ball in
centerfield.
In the fifth Cal collected its only
run. A hit by Hal Davies, a sacri
fice by Babe Danielson, and a smash
to center by Don Dodson accounted
for (he Bear tally.
Klein Collects Triple
Bud Klein connected with the best
hit ball of the game in the sixth.
The ball went all the way to the
fence, and Klein slid into third base
safely. Then John Schaefer, who
replaced Cole in center, dropped a
single into short left, scoring Klein.
Adding insurance in the next
frame, Arme was walked, Castagnoli
sacrificed, Dahle struck out, and
then Winterhalter slammed a single
to score Arce.
In a last vain attempt to get back
into the game, Cal started a ninth
inning rally. Jerry Silverstein and
Danielson got on base with singles,
but with two away Dahle made
Dodson hit an easy blooper in the
infield to end the rally and the
game.
Dahle, who was the winner over
Cal in an early contest and was
starting pitcher in the second Bear
tiff, was carried off the diamond by
his happy teammates.
The victory gave the Cards an
even .500 record in loop play, only
three games off the leading USC
Trojans. Tomorrow the Indians
meet Santa Clara, who remains a
half game ahead. Two games are
scheduled with the Trojans over the
weekend in Los Angeles.

DICK CLEGG, Indian first-base
man, raised his batting average to
40i> Saturday afternoon as he
hit three for four to lead Stanford
to a 3-1 victory over California.
Lefty Dave Dahle, although hampered by loose umpiring and
a determined bunch of Cal ballplayers, helped the Stanford var
sity to its first series win over California since "way back in
1932."
The final score of the game played in Edwards Field was 3 to 1.

Scattering nine hits and allowing
only one run, the Indian (linger was
complete master of the game. Even
better in the tight spots with men
on base, Dahle struck out nine
Bears.
Almost as effective was the "fu
ture pro star" Jackie Jensen. The
Golden Boy was tapped for 11 bin
gles. but the Indians bunched up
three hits in three different frames
to rack up the runs.
As for the umpiring, things could
not have been worse. The plate ump
was griped from the beginning, as
he sent two Cards out of the game.
Obviously poor decisions were made
against both nines, but tossing out
the third base coach for arguing in
the first inning and later Charlie
Cole for antics in the box hurt the
Indian cause.
CHigg Tops Stickers
Opening the game in grand style.
Charlie Cole smashed a hard-hit
blast through the second baseman.
The centerfielder bungled the ball
and Cole kept running, heading for
third. .There was a poor throw, and
with some smart coaching, Cole
scored.
