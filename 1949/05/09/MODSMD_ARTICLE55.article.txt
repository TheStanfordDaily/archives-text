# Varsity End Positions Appear Strong For 1949 Stanford Football Eleven
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
(Hie following is the first of a !
series of articles on the personnel |
that is expected to make up the j
Stanford varsity football team |
next fall.)

The 1949 Stanford football team j
will have at least four good ends i
and two that may well rate the ulti- j
mate in adjectives—great.
Gone will bo Gene Martin, whom j
I have long felt to be the best pass- !
catching end on the Coast, and Bob j
Ghilotti. But their loss should be
more than offset by the play of
three or four frosh prospects.
With this wealth of material in !
mind, Coach Marchie Schwartz I
plans to alternate sets of ends for i
offense and defense. This should '
make for much stronger end play, j
for the quality of the players will j
not drop with the substitutions.
Rose Is Leading Prospect
Ken Ruse will probably turn out |
to be the mainstay of the strong
corps of ends. I tab him number -
one. His greatest value is as an of- j
tensive blocker but he take's a back 1
seat to but few in catching passes, j
He is a good defensive man but
will be spelled when Stanford does
not have the ball. Should make i
All-Coast at least.
Bruce Van Alstyne is the most !
improved man on the squad. He is J
(5 ft. 3 in. and tops 200 pounds and
is last. A'l of which makes him a j
hard man to stop when he goes out

after passes. His catching has been
the talk of the season. He shines on
offense but has developed on de
fense too. Will play a lot of ball.
Bill McColl has almost lived up
to the overdone praise that pre
ceded him to Stanford. It's hard to
live up to that kind of talk btft Big
Bill is good. He has a lot to learn
on defense but is shaping up as a
varsity offensive end. He catches
the hard ones and blocks well. His
star is on the rise and three years
from now should see him getting
serious consideration as an All-
American.
Laakso on Defense
A! Laakso averaged close to 55
minutes a game Inst year and
looked very good while doing so.

But those clays are past. Barring a
plague of injuries such as that
which hit the end ,staff before the
UCLA game last year, A 1 will see
most of his action on defense. H"
has proven his worth, but should
look even better after resting while
the team is on offense.
Freshman Jack Rye is in very
good company but should make the
team easily, if for his defensive
abilities alone. He may be playing
first string defense. He is big but
handles himself well. Watch him in
years to come.
Don En berg is not in school this
quarter but will return to the grid
wars come fall. He is one of the
lightest men on the line but don'fc
let that fool you. He lettered last
year and will fit in very well on the
defensive side of the ledger.
There Are More Too
To this point I have covered six
ends—more talent than most squads
can boast of—but the tale is not yet
completed. Fans and coaches aliks
will worry out the end positions as
the season "rows. Not mentioned
above are Wilbur Taylor, frosh das'r
man; Bill Storum, a'so out for
track; Dan IMervin, sidelined by in
juries; Bob Scott, out for track; Bud
Stivison, who may surprise, and
others.
Missing spring practice will have
hurt some of these men, for it wil 112
be hard to crack the team in this
position. Real quality will show
through, and maybe one or two
will make the traveling squad oft
their showings in the pre - season
practice after Sept,. 1.
(Tomorrow: tackles and centers)


Big, rangy KEN ROSE appears to
he the best of the finest group of
ends to wear the Red of Stanford
in many years. Many tab him as
sure-fire All-Coast material.
