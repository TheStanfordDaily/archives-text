# Administration Rules Against ASSU Printing
## 
### 
The ASSU cannot go into the
commercial printing business, said
Student Manager John Pool yester
day.
This decision was reached, he
said, alter conferences with the
President's office. Dean Lawrence
A. Kimpton, and the director of the
Stanford Press.
Pool did not say whether or not
the new varitype printing system
would be installed for The Stanford
D.ii'y.
His announcement settled only
one of the questions raised over
two weeks ago when he left for
New Haven. Conn., to see how the
Yale Daily News manages its stu
dent-owned varitype machine and
offset press.
At that time, depending on the
results of his trip, it was thought
that The Daily might switch to
varitype. In that case it was said
that the ASSU would buy its own
equipment, becoming printers as
well as publishers.
This latter proposition has been
ruled out by Pool's announcement.
If The Daily should switch to
varitype, Pool said, the administra
tion is considering the use of ex
isting press buildings rather than
the erection of new ones.
