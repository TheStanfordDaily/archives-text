(Lditer's note: This is the sec
ond of a series of articles on the
history of Stanford buildings.)
In memory of her husband, Mrs.
Stanford built the million - dollar
Memorial Church, opened in 1903.
The building was decorated with
the finest mosaic and stained glass
that Jane Lathrop Stanford could
secure.
The baroque structure was built
in the form of a cross, topped by a
bell tower stretching 190 feet high.
Here, bells announced the hours
with a tone corresponding to the
chimes of Westminster Abbey.
These bells are now housed in a
tower behind the church.
On the facade of the church was
n huge mosaic scene of the Ser
mon on the Mount; and inside,
around the white marble altar, were
statues of the Holy Family and the
Twelve Apostles. At the rear ap
peared the only mosaic reproduc
tion allowed by the Vatican of Ros
selli's original "The Last Supper"
in the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
A total of StiOO.OOO was spent on
interior decoration. The stained
glass windows were designed by
the master painters of Europe and
made in the shops of J. and R. Lamb

n New York. The mosaics came
Jrom the studios of A. Salviatti in
Venice.
Two other mosaics on the facade,
representing ' Peace - ' and "Plenty,"
were replaced in 1904 when the
scene of the '"Sermon" was extend
ed down the sides.
In 1900 the Chem Building was
built, followed by a gymnasium and
a new library. The new gym re
placed an antiquated frame build
ing built behind Encina in the early
'nineties. The largest in the coun
try, it was surpassed only by the
famous Berlin Gymnasium.
In this extravagant structure
were luxurious equipment and
rooms, including a banquet hall,
kitchen, and ballroom. Two stories
high, it facet! Hhe Museum from the
other side of Palm Drive, and re
sembled its partner on the fagade.
The new library was situated just
west of the present Memorial Au
ditorium, in a position opposite the
Chem Building. Costing $600,000,
ihe structure had a steel frame and
glass dome, 141 feet high. Inside
were white marble stairways, solid
oak floors, tile corridors, and space
for 100,000 volumes. The building
was never used. t
Mrs. Stanford dieJ in Hawaii on
Feb. 28, 1303, and was thus spared

from seeing her beloved creatio
rocked by a great disaster.
