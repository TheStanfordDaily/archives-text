'"All right, men—up in the trucks.
Tie these blindfolds around your
eyes, and sit tight.
''One more thing — when I say
duck, hit the deck 'cause there'll be
a tree above your heads."
We were off for the mid-term. It
wasn't the ordinary class-room blue
book exam; it was a practical mid
term in map-reading for ROTC 3.
Rolling wheels, blowing dust, and
screeching brakes were all we could
feel or hear. Twelve of us were
hunched together and when the
driver yelled "Duck," we ducked.
One curve and a steep grade later
the cab door slammed, and we
tossed aside our eye shades.
Before us lay a gravel road, a
stone quarry, and a grassy ridge.
Above us was Captain Hutchison,
who teaches the course. "'On the
double, men," he shouted as we
panted up the hill.
"This is poisyn-oak. It won't be

| on your maps, though," he joked.
No one felt like joking. '"Here are
! compasses, rulers, and maps—all
| you need," the captain said. We
wished he was right.
"They'll start blasting in 4he
quarry in 15 minutes—battle condi
tions. you know!"
Stretching across the - valley were
orchards, hills, roads, and meadows.
In the distance were the Bay and
Moffett Field. The maps showed
only blotches of green, black, and
brown. Moflett Field was newer
than the map; and the near-by
quarry and road were not shown.
1 looked for landmarks —all I saw
were rocks and gopher holes. I
scribbled a few words on my work
sheet and said a prayer.
"Time's up," barked the instruc
tor. Down the hill we slid; into the
truck we climbed; and sped home
{ to complete last week's mid-term
examinations.
