SHANGHAI, May 10 —Commu-
nist armies drove twin spearheads
deeper into South China today. One
was pointed southwest at Nang
chans, the other southeast toward
Fukien province on the coast.
The Shanghai garrison command
admitted the Reds were pushing
ahead with both drives which are

through Kiangsi and Chekianu
provinces. But it stiil gave no de
tails.
Communist jabs toward Shang
hai continued—but they still lookec'
like a sideshow to the Reds' main
military movement along an irreg
ular front extending from Hang
chow on the east coast to Lake Po
yang in the west.
