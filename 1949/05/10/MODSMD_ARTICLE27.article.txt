For the student. who wants to
help out. but has only a few hours

"The students have kept a steady
stream of contributions coming into
the office, but we need somebody |
to help us send them on out of the
office to Europe." says Ginsberg.
Students interested in doing SIRO
work this summer or in helping ;
pack are asked to stop in at the
lIR office between 3 and 5 any day

Books, books, and more books!
"Best sellers for Europe" might be
the SIRO slogan this month, ac
cording to Pat Terry, SIRO co
chairman. For the past two months
Stanford students, through SIRO.
have sent an average of five boxes a
month, mostly shoes and clothing,
to people all over the world. Now
they are to concentrate on books.
Students in universities and
schools have asked for many of the
best sellers of recent years, includ
ing such books as "The Keys of the
Kingdom," "The Big Fisherman,"
"Gentlemen's Agreement," "Tomor
row Will Be Better," and "All the
King's Men." "For that reason,"
says Miss Terry, "we especially
want students to contribute current
novels or non-fiction best sellers, as
well as other books."
Books may be left at the lIR of
fice any day between 3 and 5 p.m.
or in any of the SIRO boxes sta
tioned around campus.
