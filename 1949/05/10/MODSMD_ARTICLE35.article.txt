Orphans." "Underdogs." Those are typical labels that have
been tagged to the Stanford Crew Association in recent years.
Saturday the "Orphans" gave California's Olympic champions
a good race at the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
Although we lost to a better team, the Farm crewmen have
improved so much over last year that they will be a strong
crew in this year's Poughkeepsie Regatta.
Crewmen have two goals they hope to achieve in future years. '
The first one is to beat the Cal outfit; that will come next year,
because the same Stanford varsity group will return while Cal
will have a new squad.
The second goal will be a more difficult one to reach—financial
recognition to the University. A few days before Saturday's race,
a Farm official said he hoped crew would be eliminated from the
iocal sports scene.
Such an attitude is, indeed, a negative one. Although the Uni
versity cannot give much financial aid to the association at pres
ent, Farm officials should be formulating future plans on how
Stanford can give material support to the men.
Crew is an expensive sport. Its 100 active supporters on cam- i
pus can raise enough funds to keep the activity alive. An active
crew program in the future, however, will be determined by
3"»ow much backing the University—the SAC in particular—will
give the association.
