Mis* X: I m going to give the students lots of formal dances.
Campaign manager: I think it would be a good idea if you told some

Miss X; All right. If the dance is formal, wear tails. If it is informal,
cut off one tail!
!> * ♦
Miss Y: I believe in giving the men a chance to work on the social com
mittees. Last year I had eight boys on my committee.
Campaign manager: All told?
Miss Y: No, one kept his mouth shut!
