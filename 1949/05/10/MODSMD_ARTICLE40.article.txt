# Red Ink Troubles Keep Coast to Coast Television Three or Four Years Away
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 8 (A') —Because
its more a matter of money than
engineering, coast-to-coast televi
sion still appears to be three to four
years away.
Tlie simple fact is, nobody has
placed an order with the Ecll Tele
phone System for a cross-country
link. Likewise there are a number
of areas now having television sta
tions where no orders have been
placed for network connections—
and some of them are on existing co
axial cable routes.
Not a single television station has
yet pulled out of the red ink column,
and many telecasters are waiting
until they can see light financially
before ordering expensive network
service. Thus the financial progress
of television broadcasting will de
termine the speed of network ex
pansion to a large degree.
The layman often thinks of tele
vision in terms of co-axial cable
which is one of two means—along
with microwave radio relay towers —
of carrying television programs long

distances. However, the co-axial
cable is even more a heavy duty
, electronic highway for carrying tre
mendous loads of long distance tele
phone calls. And here is a fact you
may not know:
New York and Los Angeles al
ready are connected by co-axial ca
-1 ble. But it's equipped for television
j only as far as St. Louis. The re
mainder is so heavily loaded with
; telephone traffic it may never be
i equipped for television, and the
! video link to the West Coast likely
will be by radio over a different
j route.
And although they aren't official,
the following other facts can be
added:
1. While the networks have indi
| cated they will be unable to pay for
coast-to-coast television within the
next three years, the radio relay link
westward from St. Louis may be
required anyway to handle increased
telephone traffic between the coasts.
Thus the television network may
| ride into the West Coast on the

coat-tails of long-di.stancc telephone
traffic.
2. A radio relay link from Chicago
to Des Moines has been announced
as the next westward extension of
the network—due to be ready in
late 1950 — and surveys are being
made for pushing this on tq Omaha.
From there, the main network route
probably will be by way of Denver.
Salt Lake City, and either San Fran
cisco or Los Angeles — but mote
likely to San Francisco. The new
radio relay route between Los An
geles and San Francisco now is ex
pected to be ready in time for the
Rose Bowl Game next New Year's
Day.
Bell officials point out it's next to
impossible to forecast network ex
tensions more than a year ahead on
anything like a timetable basis.
First, there has to be a demand
for the service. Then construction
plans have to be fitted in with the
telephone expansion program of
each area, for telephone service still
has precedence.
