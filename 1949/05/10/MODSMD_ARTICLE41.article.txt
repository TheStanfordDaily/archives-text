### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
Tlie "RepubJik Indonesia" was
proclaimed in August 1945 by the
Japanese war criminal General
Terauchi, who appointed Sukarno
president and Mohammed Hatta
vice-president. Who were these
men? What is their background?
Both Sukarno and Hatta were
leaders of the relatively small group
of Indonesians who out of their own
free will co-operated with the Japa
nese invaders during the war.
Sukarno must not only be held
responsible for the betrayal of the
Indonesian dream of independence
(which is not the same thing as
"belonging to the Greater-Asia-
Sphere of Japan"), but for a lot of
Japanese measures in occupied In
donesia as well. He shares respon
sibility for the deportation of thou
sands of Indonesian slave-laborers,
many of whom died from maltreat
ment by the Japanese.
Both Sukarno and Hatta re
peatedly showed their vehement
anti-democratic feelings and made
no secret of their pathological
hatred of America during the war
in the Pacific.
In numerous speeches and radio
broadcasts to the Indonesian people,
Sukarno made an ardent appeal for
co-operation with the Japanese and
expressed the hope that the Japa
nese forces would succeed in "iron
ing out America and destroying
England. Furthermore, Sukarno was
a big help in organizing Japanese
armed "republican forces" whose re
mainders are now engaged in guer

rilla warfare against the Dutch
troops.
In Sukarno's "republic," there
never have been free elections, and
his presidency is not based on the

will of the people
but on the will of
the Tenno. In its
methods of politi
cal terrorism the
"republic" does
not differ much
much fro m any
Fascist or Com
munist state.
Communist in
fluences amo n g

Sukarno's "republicans" are also
strong. The republic made a good
show recently of wiping out one
brand of Communism (the Madiun
rebels) .... with the aid of an
other brand, which could he called
tlie "Tan-Malakka-brand."
Does this make the republic "a
bulwark against Communism?*'
Dutch experts in Indonesian mat
ters can only shrug their shoulders.
They know Sukarno's "anti-Com
munism" is only meant for easy con
sumption by the public opinion in
the United States.
When, after endless negotiations,
the Dutch finally went into action in
December 1948. they did so because
they had (he absolute conviction thi;-
was the only way left.
In the opinion of the overwhelm
ing majority of the people of the
Netherlands (with only the excep
tion of the Communists and left
wing Socialists), the action was fully

.justified, considering the manifest
incompetence or unwillingness of
the republic to put an end to its
continuous and deliberate violation
of the Renville agreement.
It was high time indeed to react
against the hundreds of cases of
murder, political terrorism, arson,
rape,without forgetting the syste
matic and unbelievably cruel perse
cutions of the Indonesian Chinese,
the economic chaos, administrative
incompetence, backward sanitation,
disease and hunger, which had lasted
for years already, since 19-12.
At the present moment, the large
majority ot the Dutch people still
think the launching of the police
action in December 1948 was justi
fied. They strongly feel the "re
public" has until now maliciously
sabotaged the erection of the Indo
nesian Federation.
Although the "republic" only rep
resents one-third of Indonesia—in
population as well as in area—its
real purpose has been to dominate
the whole of the immense territory
of the multi-peopled Indonesian
archipelago for which the Dutch arc
responsible.
The people of the Netherlands are
still prepared to give freedom to In
donesia and to realize a kind of fed
eration between the two countries —
but they do not want to leave the
archipelago (not even the island o!
Java) under the republican terror.

Tlie "RepubJik Indonesia" was
proclaimed in August 1945 by the
Japanese war criminal General
Terauchi, who appointed Sukarno
president and Mohammed Hatta
vice-president. Who were these
men? What is their background?
Both Sukarno and Hatta were
leaders of the relatively small group
of Indonesians who out of their own
free will co-operated with the Japa
nese invaders during the war.
Sukarno must not only be held
responsible for the betrayal of the
Indonesian dream of independence
(which is not the same thing as
"belonging to the Greater-Asia-
Sphere of Japan"), but for a lot of
Japanese measures in occupied In
donesia as well. He shares respon
sibility for the deportation of thou
sands of Indonesian slave-laborers,
many of whom died from maltreat
ment by the Japanese.
Both Sukarno and Hatta re
peatedly showed their vehement
anti-democratic feelings and made
no secret of their pathological
hatred of America during the war
in the Pacific.
In numerous speeches and radio
broadcasts to the Indonesian people,
Sukarno made an ardent appeal for
co-operation with the Japanese and
expressed the hope that the Japa
nese forces would succeed in "iron
ing out America and destroying
England. Furthermore, Sukarno was
a big help in organizing Japanese
armed "republican forces" whose re
mainders are now engaged in guer

rilla warfare against the Dutch
troops.
In Sukarno's "republic," there
never have been free elections, and
his presidency is not based on the

will of the people
but on the will of
the Tenno. In its
methods of politi
cal terrorism the
"republic" does
not differ much
much fro m any
Fascist or Com
munist state.

Sukarno's "republicans" are also
strong. The republic made a good
show recently of wiping out one
brand of Communism (the Madiun
rebels) .... with the aid of an
other brand, which could he called
tlie "Tan-Malakka-brand."
Does this make the republic "a
bulwark against Communism?*'
Dutch experts in Indonesian mat
ters can only shrug their shoulders.
They know Sukarno's "anti-Com
munism" is only meant for easy con
sumption by the public opinion in
the United States.
When, after endless negotiations,
the Dutch finally went into action in
December 1948. they did so because
they had (he absolute conviction thi;-
was the only way left.
In the opinion of the overwhelm
ing majority of the people of the
Netherlands (with only the excep
tion of the Communists and left
wing Socialists), the action was fully

.justified, considering the manifest
incompetence or unwillingness of
the republic to put an end to its
continuous and deliberate violation
of the Renville agreement.
It was high time indeed to react
against the hundreds of cases of
murder, political terrorism, arson,
rape,without forgetting the syste
matic and unbelievably cruel perse
cutions of the Indonesian Chinese,
the economic chaos, administrative
incompetence, backward sanitation,
