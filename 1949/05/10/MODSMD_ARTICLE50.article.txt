# Speedsters Prep for Fresno Go
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
With the Big Meet formally clos
ing Stanford's dual meet track sea
son, all eyes are focused on the
post - season relays, conference j
meets, and national contests, which j
follow in the next few weeks.
The world-famous Fresno Relays, I
'"where world records are broken," |
will be held next Saturday at Rad- j
cliff Stadium in the Raisin City. :
Stanford will send down a 26-man j
team, which will rate high among !
the many college squads entered in j
the meet.
Trojans Tops
Chief opponent this year will I
again be Jess Hill's Trojans. With i
Mel Patton a sure winner in the j
jpen 100, and anchoring both sprint i
relays, Troy will be the team to '
oeat.
But with Bud Held first in the ;
avelin, Gay Bryan winning the
broad jump, and Lew Davis and ;
Otis Chandler one-two in the shot, i
;he Indians certainly cannot be
counted out.
Because of the Big Meet last Sat
urday, it was decided to call of!
yesterday's practice, but the squad
will turn out in full force today. 1
After hurting his knee on the
final barrier in the low hurdles last
Saturday, it was feared that high
hurdler Downing McKee might be j
through for the season, but it was
learned yesterday that McKee will

be ready to go again next Saturday i
at Fresno.
Dixon in Highs
McKee, who equaled his best-ever j
mark of 14.3 seconds in winning |
the highs last Saturday, will find j
some stiff competition at Fresno, in- j
eluding the Bruins' Craig Dixon, â€¢
Troy's Dick Attelsy, and the Bears' >
Walt Briant.
The big hurdler placed second to j
teammate Darrell Kreitz in the Re
lays last year, after Dixon tripped !
on the last hurdle.
The feature race again will be the j
mile relay. The Indians will be all
out to avenge their defeat at the

hands of. the Trojans. Stanford's
four-man team is still undecided.
A match race between the regu
lar members of the relay (Cass B!y,
Rupe Andrews, Pitch Johnson, and
Larry Hoff), and five-eventer Gay
Bryan in a quarter-mile will take
place tomorrow to help decide
which four out of the five men will
compose the Card team. It should
be quite a race.
Stanford's Jose Rael, who was in
much too fast company in the two
mile last Saturday, will try his luck
in the 5.000 meters (slightly less
than three miles) at the Relays. Last
year's winner, Francis Vierra of
Fresno State, will undoubtedly en
ter this year, and will reign as the
pre-meet favorite.


KUPE ANDREWS
