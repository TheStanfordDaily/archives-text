### JOHN HALL 
Gives this morning with a success story, otherwise entitled, the full re
port on The California Caper.
This stufT really needs some soft background music and a few well
placed sighs from a curvy blonde, but minus the trimmings; here we go
anyway.
For the first time in a 10-year stretch. Stanford's win program against
the Golden Bear turned out to be as well-rounded as a 90-cent dinner
at Carlun's.
In rapid-fire order. Tribe athletes have waxed hot with wins in Track,
their first cinder verdict of virtue since 1940; in Basketball, their second
four-game sweep in history; in Baseball, their first series nod since 1932;
and in Swimming, as usual.
Add to this a set of smooth yearling efforts, including wins in all the
main goes, such as football, basketball, track, baseball, swimming, and
tennis, and you get an idea of just how successful the 1948-49 Cnl-
Stanford relationship has been.
Only serious defect to the slate was the 7-6 Big Game mistake, but
Cal's win was about as flat as the new roofs over Stern Hall, all of which
serves notice that Stanlord is back in step, and is ready to cope with
California just as it did before the war.
Long live the Indian, the Golden Bear is dead.
Baseball Road l*s Uphill
Tonight Stanford's climbing horsehide club, still mathematical con
tenders tor CIBA honors, will meet a severe test at the hands of Santa
Clara under the arcs at Washington Park in San Jose.
The Tribe diamond specialists need five straight wins to overtake USC,
and this one over the Broncos is a must.
Down in the San Jose ball park, after knocking off Santa Clara two
straight already, Stanford will be fighting the percentages.
But that's nothing compared to what the Cards will be up agairtpt when
they invade Los Angeles this weekend to face the league-leading USC
Trojans in a two-game series.
At this point, it doesn't look as if the Cards will be able to survive.
Pitching is probably the main setback, as Dave Dahle who clipped Cali
fornia last Saturday, will be able to work only one of the three games.
Harry Wolter could make good use of the services of Everett Dean's
frosh ace. Lefty Frank Hamilton, during the next two weeks. Hamilton
already has shown more polish than most of the varsity CIBA hurlers
this season.
Patton-Medicine Helps Troy
About the time Halley's Comet decides to make a second showing, or
when Dick Tracy runs out of crooks, somebody might equal Mel Patton's
tremendous showing in the sprints down in Westwood last weekend.
Pell-Mel, who was supposed to quit this season but decided to fight on
lor old SC, set the track world on its ear last Saturday by turning in the
two fastest sprints ever recorded.
ilis :09.1 in the century was called unofficial because of the six-mile
breeze, but his :20.2 tour of the furlong was perfect, and gives him a dual
set of world records, seeing as how he already owns the:09.3 standard
set at Fresno last year.
Mel must be glad he didn't quit. So must Jess Hill and the whole Tro
jan following. His presence will probably be sufficient to give USC an
other national title this year.
Maybe, Just Maybe
Quite a few Farm enthusiasts would be pleased if the following state
ments turned out to be true:
llupe Andrews, member of the mile relay team: "USC's relay team
isn't going to beat us again this season."
Bill Aree, baseball captain: "If we could get into a play-off with those
Trojans, we'd take them."
