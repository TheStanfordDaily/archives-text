# BASEBALL TONIGHT

### 
Stanford vs. Santa Clara
Washington Park, San Jose
8:15

laven't kissed the CIBA bunting
joodbye yet.
Tonight's "crucial" will probably
ind rangy Jim Claypool going to
he hill for the Cards to oppose
?anta Clara's quick lefthander, Hal
Toso.
Claypool has pitched a couple of
;ames in the bull pen in recent
vctks, and is the logical choice to
io against the Broncos. The rangy
ophomore turned in a masterful re
ief stint the last time the two teams
vent at it under the lights, and if
te has some more of the same kind
>112 stuff in his arm tonight the Cards
shouldn't have too much trouble
vith the skidding Broncs.
It's strictly guesswork that Santa

Tara will throw luto, but we'll be
urprised if he doesn't go. The In
ians haven't beaten a good left
ander this year, and Washington
ark, where a good fly ball to right
ill usually go for four bases, -s
cfinitely a southpaw's ball park.
Santa Clara, like Stanford, has
ad its troubles this spring. The
•rones started out the season like
house afire but seem to on the
dds now, and hit a new low last
eek in dropping two games in a
nv to the cellar-dwelling St. Mary's
raels.
Their infield is second in the
'ague only to USC's flashy combo,
ut aside from Toso, pitching is be
iw par.
But most of all, the Broncs' boom
ooni boys, Kelly and Renna, have
een having bat trouble of late,
herein lies the main reason behind
;»nta Clara's late season slump.
