## SOFTBALL Village, Reds Win Playoffs 
### 
Theta Chi's rampaging Reds and
a never-say-die Village 314 nine
yesterday cleared two more big
hurdles in the rocky path leading
to the all-University softball crown.
The Reds entered the finals by
doing what no other term had done
before this seasonâ€”scoring against
Delta Tau Delta chucker Gus Cha
valas. They did it four times on 11
hits to hand fireballer Willie Altus
his eighth consecutive victory by a
4 to 2 tally.
The lads from 314, in the mean
while. were forced to come from be
hind to sock Phi Kappa Sigma with
a five-run fifth inning which ad
vanced the Villagers to the tourna
ment semi-finals.
Altus allowed but four stingy hits
in his taming of the Phi Kaps. al
though three errors by his team
mates. had him in trouble more
than once.
Larry Fink and Bob Ames, both
performers on last year's Frosh
baseball team, led the Red pounders
at the plate. Fink's two-run double
in the first handing the Lower Row
nine a lead it never lost.
The Delts put two men on base in
a last-inning desperation rally, but
John Hail flew out to left field to
quench their championship hopes.
The Phi Kaps grabbed an early
3 to 0 lead in their losing battle
against Village 314, as Johnson. Mc-
Gillis, and White crossed the platter
in the second.
That was all the scoring until the
fifth when 314 staged its game
winning comeback. Singles by Gene
Hoo and Bob Parkhill, who between
them managed to knock in five of
the victors' total of six runs, were
the big blows in this frame.
Parkhill's second single in the
seventh added the final, unneeded
tally for the boys from Menlo.
Village 314 will meet ATO Thurs
day afternoon in a semi-final match,
the victor gaining the privilege of
battling the Theta Chi Reds in the
championship fray.
Tlie title contest will probably be
held next Monday.
