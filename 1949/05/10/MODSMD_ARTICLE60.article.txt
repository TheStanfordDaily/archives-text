# Farm's First String Tackles, Centers Could Rank with Best on Coast in '49
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
(The following article is the |
second of a series on the person- j
nel that is expected to make up j
the Stanford varsity football team i
next fall.)

It is an old football axiom that a i
team is only as strong offensively as i
its tackles. The saying goes on to j
state that a team is only as strong j
as its tackles and linebackers while j
on defense.
The 1949 Stanford team will have j
men of proven quality as starters j
in both positions. Whether these [
men are on a par with, or better
than, their counterparts on other
Coast teams is a point of argument. |
Only actual playing time against the j
other players can tell the truth.
In Gordon White the Cards have
a man who was chosen second- j
string All-Coast tackle by both the
coaches' and the Associated Press
polls. The first named is a good
enough recommendation for me.
Gordy earned these honors while
but a sophomore. There is no rea
son not to believe that he will make j
the first team next year. White is
one of the few men on the squad |
who will see a lot of action on both I
offense and defense. He is that i
good. He covers ground well on j
defense and recovers quickly.
A 1 Ran will probably be the J
lightest first - string tackle on the
Coast at about 190 pounds playing
weight. But Gub-Gub is the other j

Stanford's Block "S" Society
will hold an important meeting
tomorrow night at 7:)]0 in Dinah's
Shack.
Business of the evening will lie
the election of officers for the
coming year.

of the Stanford - California track
meet will be featured.

half of what should be the best
brace of tackles on the field any day i
that Stanford plays. He shines best
while carrying out blocking assign
ments and leading plays. These two
veterans should bolster an other
wise doubt!u! center line.

But after Rau and White the
tackle situation is uncertain. Lee
Daly, up from the frosh, and Hal
Walker fire pretty even behind
White. Daly weighs in at about 220
and can handle himself well. He
played first string on Chuck Tay
lor's i'rosh team last year. The ex
perience he gains next year should
prove valuable in 1950.

Hal Walker is up from the junior
varsity and is a living example of
what hard work does for a ball
player. He will fit in very well here

with experience. He has improved
immensely this spring. Could be
the surprise of the year.
Wes Pmilson earned his spurs in
the Army game last year when
others were sidelined. Since then
he has taken up rugby and the ben
efit gained there has shown up dur
ing the last month. He is rough and
likes the game. A very good defen
sive man. He will play a lot of ball.
Bruce Mikesell should see action
on defense. He is big (225) but
needs a lot of coaching. He too has
improved with the spring practice.
Ed Taylor may show up here also
but he has been injured too much
in the last two years to be counted
upon. Don Lucas is a newly made
over guard who should also help.
The center position rates a toss
up between Dick Abraham and Jim
Castagiioli, with Abraham getting
the nod at this time. Abraham is
much the faster of the two and a
slightly better blocker. Cas looked
very good as a linebacker in the
closing games last year. In any
event, both lads wi'.l play defense
as both are fine linebackers. Mark
the offensive assignment open for
now.
Gordon Rice, a Santa Clara trans
fer, fits in next as a linebacker.
Jack Barnes may come through as
could Jack Hosekrans, who was the
best Card on the field in the 194S
San Jose game. Abraham gets the
nod for the center job on kicking
situations.
All in all, both positions look to
be strong in the first rank. Inex
perience shows through after that
and injuries could sidetrack the
Machine at any time. My persona!
opinion is that Daly and Poulson
will come through with flying col
ors. Both like the game which is
very important.
For once the tackle position may
receive aid from the junior colleges.
Two men are tabbed for red and
white uniforms after they register
in September. They should be on
i hand on Sept. 1. If they show up
I and prove to be all that the rave
notices claim them to be. the tackle
spot can be removed from the
doubtful class.

Walker fire pretty even behind

played first string on Chuck Tay

Bruce Mikesell should see action
on defense. He is big (225) but
needs a lot of coaching. He too has
improved with the spring practice.

immensely this spring. Could be
the surprise of the year.
Wes Pmilson earned his spurs in
the Army game last year when
others were sidelined. Since then
he has taken up rugby and the ben
efit gained there has shown up dur
ing the last month. He is rough and
likes the game. A very good defen
sive man. He will play a lot of ball.
Bruce Mikesell should see action
on defense. He is big (225) but
needs a lot of coaching. He too has
improved with the spring practice.
Ed Taylor may show up here also
but he has been injured too much
in the last two years to be counted
upon. Don Lucas is a newly made
over guard who should also help.
The center position rates a toss
up between Dick Abraham and Jim
Castagiioli, with Abraham getting
the nod at this time. Abraham is
much the faster of the two and a
slightly better blocker. Cas looked
very good as a linebacker in the
closing games last year. In any
event, both lads wi'.l play defense
as both are fine linebackers. Mark
the offensive assignment open for
now.
Gordon Rice, a Santa Clara trans
fer, fits in next as a linebacker.
Jack Barnes may come through as
could Jack Hosekrans, who was the
best Card on the field in the 194S
San Jose game. Abraham gets the
nod for the center job on kicking
situations.
All in all, both positions look to
be strong in the first rank. Inex
perience shows through after that
and injuries could sidetrack the
Machine at any time. My persona!
opinion is that Daly and Poulson
will come through with flying col
ors. Both like the game which is
very important.
For once the tackle position may
receive aid from the junior colleges.
Two men are tabbed for red and
white uniforms after they register
in September. They should be on
i hand on Sept. 1. If they show up
I and prove to be all that the rave
notices claim them to be. the tackle
spot can be removed from the
doubtful class.
(Tomorrow, guards)
