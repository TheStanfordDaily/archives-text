## Faulty Methods 
### 
Several weaknesses in campaigning and election principles
have continued through recent student body elections.
The first one has occurred because of the lack of cooperation
between election board and the administration. Too many offices
are based on class year and living group, and too many students ,
lie about their class year and residence in order to vote for
friends in other districts. The University was asked last year
to print student body cards with spaces to allow for class year
and living group data.
The procedure could be done before registration books are
turned in. Clerks would stamp student body cards in the mar
gin or over the smaller print. Such a method would prevent
' switch voting" during the elections.
The second weakness in the election system here is a tech
r-ical one. Offices that the voter cannot mark should be crossed
cut with a heavy red crayonâ€”not with a lead pencil.
Another weak point in the election system exists because
candidates refuse to follow Election Board rules. Too many
campaign posters are tacked and pasted on University buildings.
The violations have been so numerous that election posters may
be outlawed in the future if policing does not stop violations.
