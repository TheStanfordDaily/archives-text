To the Editor:
At the election assembly yesterday, a large number of mimeographed
statements were passed out. These statements included an explanation of
the preferential system, and a list of candidates running for ASSU offices.
This form was passed out under the heading of the "Better Campus
Government Bureau." Some of the candidates' names were in heavy print
and underlined in such a manner as to indicate preference. Some of the
candidates had no knowledge of the preferences.
This letter is to notify the student body that the statement is NOT an
official form put out by the ASSU or by the Election Braid. It is a cam
paign tactic written and published by a certain student group to elect
candidates whom this group favors.
Choose your own student officers. Don't let a decidedly partial group
do it for you.
