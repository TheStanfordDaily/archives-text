# Better Judgment Needed

To the Editor:
Jim van Gindertael has been writing utterly stupid, immature articles
on European politics long enough. In yesterday's Daily, in apoligizing for
Dutch imperialism in Indonesia, he reached a new low.
That article is so completely inaccurate that it does not merit a factual
lefutation. My only wish is that 'Ihe Daily editor would use better judg
ment in selecting articles.

but he has the same right to speak as professional columnists do in their
own articles.)
