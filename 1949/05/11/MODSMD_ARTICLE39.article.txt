STANFORD SHORT STORIES
(Stanford University Press) edited
by Wallace Stegner.
On the whole, this book will
prove to be a disappointment to
most readers. The modern concep
tion of the short story is certainly j
far different from what it has been i
in the past.
This book reflects the "New
Trend." Where the original meaning
of the term "short story" was self- j
explanatory once, today it requires |
a new definition.
Many of the stories in this year's j
edition are simply not stories. They
more nearly resemble single inci- :
dents in a psychological case study. '
In fact, a great number of the stories i
may be summed up in this way:
One character meets another per
son, or experiences such a psycho
logically significant act as stubbing ;
his toe. From there the author pro
ceeds to a full psychological analysis 1
of the character's emotions, the pow- i
erful stream of thoughts which the
simple incident has provoked, and a !
careful study of the emotional con- â– 
flict which stirs the character
deeply, but which leaves the reader
absolutely cold.
That is, the old-fashioned student |
of literature has not yet learned that,
in contemporary literature, it is not j
necessary that the author include
anything resembling action in his
stories.
Many people must come to realize
that such writers as Edgar Allan
Poe, Ambrose Bierce, O. Henry,
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and Bret 1
Harte are etTete, superficial and
psychologically uninformed. Pseudo
psychology is THE thing today, ap
parently.
However, probably as a sop to the
literarily uninformed, Wallace Steg
ner has included a few stories j
which resemble the type with which
people are familiar.
Appearing as an occasional oasis in j
this psychological desert are a few I
excellent, but old-fashioned short
stories such as, "The Wedding War- ;
riors," "Behold, A Pale Horse," and
"The Bounds of Brotherhood." Also,
there is an interesting selection, ;
"The Iron Stag."
Thus, there are actually two dis
tinct parts to this book, the few short
stories, and the group of stereotyped,
mental mumbo-jumbo. And you are !
welcome to it.
