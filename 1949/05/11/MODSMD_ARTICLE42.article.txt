Probably only Columbia Univer
sity can boast of an "official' baby
sitter. A mass infanteria is set up
in the northeast corner of the cam
pus, where a mammoth bronze
statue of the great God Pan watches
carefully over the noisy faculty chil
dren who play at his feet.

Vote for One: A candidate at Chico
State has added a different twist to
the vote-promotion game. She sup
plies soap for all students taking
showers in the college gym. A
clean-up campaign, no less.

Stanford isn't the only one suffer
ing from tuition difficulties. Wash
ington State is showing a similar
western inflationary trend by raising
its tuition from $10 to $20 per se
mester.

An architect's dream may very
soon be the realization of the Uni
versity of Washington, where a three
million dollar project would set up
additional wings to their student
Union.
Future Washingtonians may enjoy
new dining rooms, lounges, a tele
phone center, a 900-couple ballroom,
music rooms, and guest rooms—all
part of the new union.

Male Subtlety—an outraged San

, Francisco Foghorn reader advises
! drastic action against a group of
1 feminine java sippers who have
lorced the masculine contingent to
j stand in the university coffee shop.
"Don't let a woman beat you to
a stool, his letter warned. "If
necessary, knock her down." His last
word was, "Watch out for female
tea drinkers. They are radicals, and
might become dangerous."
Strict case of Cellaritus.

Russia walked out of a United Na
tions Assembly meeting again upon
the charges that the "meeting had
taken a capitalistic form."
But this was not the regular UN
session. University of Kansas stu
dents representing 26 nations held a
mock convention. The Russian rep
resentative "vetoed" both world dis
armament and control of the atom.

Michigan Staters, however, don't
believe in mock action. Recently.
j 125 demonstrators from the univer
sity swarmed into the state executive
office to demand passage of four
bills before the legislature.
The students had picketed the
capitnl building demanding that they
wanted "jobs, not guns." The gov
ernor dismissed the crowd, saying
that their lobbying would be more
eflective if it was less spectacular.
