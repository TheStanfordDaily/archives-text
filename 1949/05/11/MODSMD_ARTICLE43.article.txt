# U.N. Action Evokes Dutch Bitterness
## 
### JAN VAN GINDERTAEL 
No change has taken place in the
genuine goodwill of the Netherlands
people toward Indonesia as a whole.
This goodwill is still the prevailing
force behind the actions of the
Netherlands government and the
thoughts ol the Netherlands popula
tion.
Everybody has a right to criticize
the actions of the Netherlands gov
ernment, but nobody has a right to
doubt the sincerity of the motives
which make out the guiding force
behind these actions. You have a
right to say that the Dutch did it
all wrong— though the Dutch think
it will be hard to find anywhere in
the world so many goodwilling Indo
nesian experts as in Holland—but
you do not have a right to say that
the Dutch want to restore colonial
ism in Indonesia.
You do not have a right to this
because it is utterly untrue. If you
could read the hearts and minds of
the people of the Netherlands you
would understand how terribly un
just you would treat the Dutch na
tion by taking it for granted— as the
propagandists of the "Republik In
donesia" want you to believe—that
the Netherlands' ultimate end is the
restoration of colonialism.

To the people of the Netherlands,
the Soviet-instigated backing of the
"Republik Indonesia" by the Se
curity Council is not only an injus
tive toward the millions fo freedom
loving Indonesians who sincerely
hoped the Dutch police action would
free them once and for all from the
political terror of this Japanese crea
tion, but it is also a slap in the face
of every real democrat outside Indo
nesia. If Sukarno is a democrat,
then the hanging of To jo was one of
the worst crimes in history.
The Dutch people are at a loss to
understand why the Security Coun
cil is continuing part of the life
work of Tojo and why it keeps
forcing two Quislings like Sukarno
and Hatta upon them.
The Dutch are not convinced these
are the men in whose hands the fu
ture of a truly free and democratic
Indonesia is safe. Neither do they
believe these are the men to put a
stop to Communist menace in Asia.
On the contrary.
Maybe this is also the reason why
they fail to appreciate the attitude
of those former allies who do not
shrug from letting their official rep
resentatives at the Security Council
declare that the Dutch action in In
donesia should be compared with

Hitler's action in Europe.
This remark sent a shock of indig
nation and contempt through the
little country which lost 1500.001) of
its civilian population in the claws
of the Nazis. This also applies to
the highly-regrettable campaign,
waged by certain American reli
gious communities, which — misled
by deliberate and malicious misin
formation—raised a fund for aid to
the "oppressed Indonesian churches,
victims of Dutch militarism."
Remarks of this kind only tend to
unite the Dutch nation stronger than
ever and to fill the hearts and minds
ol the people of the Netherlands
with the grim determination to ful
fill their task in Indonesia, whatever
the outside world may say.
Maybe it also explains why, in
Holland, several old friends ~of
American democracy have, in a
moment of shocked feelings, sent
back to the America the decorations
with which they were rewarded for
helping and hiding from the enemy
countless stranded American airmen.
Let us hope there will be a day
when they will ask for their decora
tions to be sent back to them. It will
be the day when they have regained
faith in American justice and lead
ership of a better world.

behind these actions. You have a
right to say that the Dutch did it
all wrong— though the Dutch think
it will be hard to find anywhere in
the world so many goodwilling Indo
nesian experts as in Holland—but
you do not have a right to say that
the Dutch want to restore colonial
ism in Indonesia.
You do not have a right to this
because it is utterly untrue. If you
could read the hearts and minds of
the people of the Netherlands you
would understand how terribly un
just you would treat the Dutch na
tion by taking it for granted— as the
propagandists of the "Republik In
donesia" want you to believe—that
the Netherlands' ultimate end is the
restoration of colonialism.

To the people of the Netherlands,
the Soviet-instigated backing of the
"Republik Indonesia" by the Se
curity Council is not only an injus
tive toward the millions fo freedom
loving Indonesians who sincerely
hoped the Dutch police action would
free them once and for all from the
political terror of this Japanese crea
tion, but it is also a slap in the face
of every real democrat outside Indo
nesia. If Sukarno is a democrat,
then the hanging of To jo was one of
the worst crimes in history.
The Dutch people are at a loss to
understand why the Security Coun
cil is continuing part of the life
work of Tojo and why it keeps
forcing two Quislings like Sukarno
and Hatta upon them.
The Dutch are not convinced these
are the men in whose hands the fu
ture of a truly free and democratic
Indonesia is safe. Neither do they
believe these are the men to put a
stop to Communist menace in Asia.
On the contrary.
Maybe this is also the reason why
they fail to appreciate the attitude
of those former allies who do not
shrug from letting their official rep
resentatives at the Security Council
declare that the Dutch action in In
donesia should be compared with

Hitler's action in Europe.
This remark sent a shock of indig
nation and contempt through the
little country which lost 1500.001) of
its civilian population in the claws
of the Nazis. This also applies to
the highly-regrettable campaign,
waged by certain American reli
gious communities, which — misled
by deliberate and malicious misin
formation—raised a fund for aid to
the "oppressed Indonesian churches,
victims of Dutch militarism."
Remarks of this kind only tend to
unite the Dutch nation stronger than
ever and to fill the hearts and minds
ol the people of the Netherlands
with the grim determination to ful
fill their task in Indonesia, whatever
the outside world may say.
Maybe it also explains why, in
Holland, several old friends ~of
American democracy have, in a
moment of shocked feelings, sent
back to the America the decorations
with which they were rewarded for
helping and hiding from the enemy
countless stranded American airmen.
Let us hope there will be a day
when they will ask for their decora
tions to be sent back to them. It will
be the day when they have regained
faith in American justice and lead
ership of a better world.
No change has taken place in the
genuine goodwill of the Netherlands
people toward Indonesia as a whole.
This goodwill is still the prevailing
force behind the actions of the
Netherlands government and the
thoughts ol the Netherlands popula
tion.
Everybody has a right to criticize
the actions of the Netherlands gov
ernment, but nobody has a right to
doubt the sincerity of the motives
which make out the guiding force
behind these actions. You have a
right to say that the Dutch did it
