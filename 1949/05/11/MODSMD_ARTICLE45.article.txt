# Stanford Con Home Helps Bay Area Children
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
is maintained in part by donations
from the Stanford students, the
Menlo Circus Club, the San Fran
cisco Community Chest, the Elks
Club, the Rotary Club, and various
women's auxiliaries on the Penin
sula.
The purpose of the home is to
provide nursing care, medical serv
ices. and instruction for convales
cent children in the Bay Area who
cannot get the same treatment at
home.
Operation costs run about SI-800
per bed per year. The ASSU gives
$7,200 per year in its capacity as
donor for four beds. Income from
endowment also aids in keeping the
Home going.
Applicants are screened by the
Home's social worker in co-opera
tion with the children's parents. The
child's application is then exam
ined by the medical director, who
must pass on it before the candidate
is placed on the waiting list.
The majority of the patients are
recovering from rheumatic fever,
and stay at the Home about eight
months. Usually they are not al
lowed to remain there for more

than one year.
Eighty children, 40 boys and 40
girls, can be eared for at one time.
They are of all races and creeds.
The Con Home comprises four
units. The Stanford Unit, formerly
the summer home of Senator and
Mrs. Stanford, was made the first
unit of the Home in 1919. It is now
the central office.
Boys are housed in the McLaugh
lin Bed Unit, which was donated by
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker in 192.').
There are 20 beds in the boys'
wards, with room for seven in the
admission ward.
The Babcock Bed Unit for girls
is of the same size and design as the
McLaughlin Unit. It was built in
1928 from the estate of Mrs. Henry
Babcock.
Runabouts, who are children al
most well enough to return home,
live in the Ladies' Auxiliary Unit
which was built in 1929. Thirty are
cared for there.
