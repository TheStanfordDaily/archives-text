# Chappie to Revive Neglected Comics
## 
### 
Recent surveys conducted by the
American Society for the Pushing
of Progressive Education reveal that
the comic strip has been neglected
as a medium lor education. The
erudite editors of the Chappie, see
ing the sad neglect, have turned out
a comic book issue for the edifica
tion and enlightenment of Stanford
students.
"Get yours today." says Samuel
Grumy, janitor and connoisseur at
Roble. There is a limited number
on sale (only 500.000 copies).
