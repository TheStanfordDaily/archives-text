# Encina False Alarm
## 
### 
Smoke curling from a tunnel
under the west end of Encina Com
mons was the cause of a call to the
fire department last night. Respond
ing to the call, they found a small
leak in a steam line the cause of
the "smoke."
The live steam passing through
fresh sawdust packing on the pipe
was responsible for the smell.
