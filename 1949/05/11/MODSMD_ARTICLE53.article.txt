Frankie Albert, one of Stanford's and the nation's all-time iootball great;
it-' the subject of this bit this morning and quite a subject he is.
Frankie, with Clark Shaughnessy and 10 other guys, is only the ma
responsible for the present-day trend of college football. It has oft bee
debated whether "Albert made the T-formation" or did the "T-formatio
make Albert?" But the fact of the matter is that both have come alon
handsomely since 1940.
Albert is 29 years old now but is still one of the best quarterbacks i
the business. He is here on the Farm lor the spring practice only and wi
return to the San Francisco '49ers for next season.
Most fans know of his history, but a brief rundown here would not I:
out of place. Albert played for Stanford in 1939, '40. and '41. He mad
most Ail-American teams during the last two years. He joined the nav
after graduation and was sent to St. Mary's Pre-Flight where he playe
football with such as Bobby Grayson and Vic Bottari.
It came as a surprise to most fans when a Stanford team under Marchi
Schwartz, in his first year as head coach, beat the highly-rated sailors b
a 28 to 14 count. A l'ellow by the name of Ray Hanmiett sparked th
Cards at quarterback that day. Albert speaks of the game as, "That w;
the one where we had all the names and Stanford had all the touchdowns
The boy-faced Frankie then took a 16-month tour on one of Mr. Ka
ser's baby-carriers. After being discharged in November of 1945, 1
signed to play the remainder of the season with the Los Angeles Bui
dogs. He then signed with the San Francisco club in 1946 when the A 1
America Conference was just getting under way.
Frankie had a few shaky days that first year and some fans hollert
long and hard that he was a smart-aleck kid who thought he was ju
too good.
Frankie shrugs ofT the fickleness of the fans with. "I guess I just h;
more bad days than good ones that year." I was one of the many Stai
lordites who trekked to Kezai each Sunday to watch the great Frank
play. It was about that time that the realization hit me that you just car
win with the fans.
Frankie was "Prince Frankie" when he was winning and "a lousy bun
when he lost. But times have changed now and if you are so unfortuna
as to cast a hint that you think Frankie might have been a little k
wrong on a play, some guy will turn around and berate you with, "Wha
stmatter ? Don t you know that he called that play just to confuse t
other team?"
Albert's play-calling has long been a challenge to his opponents,
one game, against the LA. Dons in 1947, he called the same pass play s
times in a row. He missed the first two times and then eonrtficted wi
four straight to John Strzykalski. Then he hit Alan Beals on the sar
play for a touchdown.
The well-liked Albert opines that there is really very little differem
between college and pro football. "The pros perfect the plays, that's a
They can spend a lot more time on them than can the college boys . .
and the outside interests are not there, either," he adds. Prince Frank
goes on to say that he has "five times as much fun calling plays in p
ball. "The tools are much better," he grinned.
When asked to pick the outstanding players that he has played wi
or against, Albert came up with Bob Reinhard of California and the L.
Dons as a lineman and Spec Sanders as the best back. Reinhard is o
of the few Cal men who has ever made good in pro ball.
