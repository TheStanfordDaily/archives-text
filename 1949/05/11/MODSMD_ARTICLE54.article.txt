(The following is the third of I

arsity football team next fall.)
By JOHN BRFIER
Since the close of the last foot
tll season it has been no secret on
e Farm that the search for guards
as on. Coaches scanned the roster
ondering if this tackle or that end
•uld lit in as a guard. Men were
ifted. tried, and discarded and the
arch goes on.
Missing next fall will be three
urths of the 1948 guard staff—Jack
cKittrick. Bob Rohrer, and Ted
ljenwall. Only Don Fix remains
what was a none too strong l'our
ine.
Fix, a proven veteran, rates the
imber one spot this spring and
11 probably get the nod on Sept.
He is a steady, dependable
lyer who occasionally rises to
illiant heights.
After the sturdy Dayton, Wash-
Jton, lad the spot is uncertain to
v the least. My nomination, and
obably that of the coaching staff,
es to Hart C'm»k, a 19-year-old
terman. "Cap" is a hustling, fol
v - the - ball type of player who
/es the game. He and end A 1
akso are the best ballhawks of
? team. He is light, 178 pounds,
t is a terrific driver.
Chuck Hokansun. one of the
ide-overs, is looking very good
the guard spot. He was a first
ing frosh tackle, and is built on
- lines ol a baby tank. He and
sn August are definite first-string
eats. August missed a letter last
ar by the narrowest of margins.
I has improved this spring and
II give one and all a good battle.
? e.-;-:e Cone is the digger type of
aid that is hard to moveout when
is on defense. On a good day
looks to be top flight. He is lack
in experience but what guard,
th the exception of Fix, isn't? I
e his style. Watch him.
Vlike Pelsinger. a made-over end:
ck Lucas, a frosh who is out lor
' first time; and Bernie Tokarz.
other freshman, are all about

equal at left guard. Pelsinger is
new to the position and hasn't had
much of an opportunity to show his
stuff. Same with Lucas, from whom
great things are expected. Tokarz
may do.
Other right guards — the terms
right and left have little meaning at
this stage of the game—stack up
quite well. Russ Pome my is trying
his hand at tbe position after a spell
at fullback. The big fellow, with
only 18 or 20 practices behind him,
looks as if he will fit in well for
relief duty. He has a lot to learn
yet bul is very willing.
Owen Powell, Joe Jacob, and
Harry Dahlberg are to be consid
ered. Powell is the best of the
three and will see varsity action.
Jacob has been injured and has yet
to make his place. Dahlberg, a real
iwwiie, may make the team on
hustle and fight alone. He is a good
defensive man.
Pomeroy, Cook, and Pelsinser
will all fit in as middle l'ne back
ers when the Cards eo into a five

man defensive line. Pomeroy is last
for all his 205 pounds, and should
round into form come September.
The guard spot is made up lor the
most part of inexperienced men. If
they weather the 194!) storm, Coach
Marchie Schwartz will have a fine
bunch of juniors and seniors with
which to build up the 1950 squad.
One reason the guard position has
remained open is because of the
competition that these 12 men have
shown. In all likelihood the starting
guards will not be chosen until the
week before the San Jose State
game.

Veteran Card guard

By JOHN BRFIER
Since the close of the last foot
tll season it has been no secret on
e Farm that the search for guards
as on. Coaches scanned the roster
ondering if this tackle or that end
•uld lit in as a guard. Men were
ifted. tried, and discarded and the
arch goes on.
Missing next fall will be three
urths of the 1948 guard staff—Jack
cKittrick. Bob Rohrer, and Ted
ljenwall. Only Don Fix remains
what was a none too strong l'our
ine.
Fix, a proven veteran, rates the
imber one spot this spring and
11 probably get the nod on Sept.
He is a steady, dependable
lyer who occasionally rises to
illiant heights.
After the sturdy Dayton, Wash-
Jton, lad the spot is uncertain to
v the least. My nomination, and
obably that of the coaching staff,
es to Hart C'm»k, a 19-year-old
terman. "Cap" is a hustling, fol
v - the - ball type of player who
/es the game. He and end A 1
akso are the best ballhawks of
? team. He is light, 178 pounds,
t is a terrific driver.
Chuck Hokansun. one of the
ide-overs, is looking very good
the guard spot. He was a first
ing frosh tackle, and is built on
- lines ol a baby tank. He and
sn August are definite first-string
eats. August missed a letter last
ar by the narrowest of margins.
I has improved this spring and
II give one and all a good battle.
? e.-;-:e Cone is the digger type of
aid that is hard to moveout when
is on defense. On a good day
looks to be top flight. He is lack
in experience but what guard,
th the exception of Fix, isn't? I
e his style. Watch him.
Vlike Pelsinger. a made-over end:
ck Lucas, a frosh who is out lor
' first time; and Bernie Tokarz.
other freshman, are all about

equal at left guard. Pelsinger is
new to the position and hasn't had
much of an opportunity to show his
stuff. Same with Lucas, from whom
great things are expected. Tokarz
may do.
Other right guards — the terms
right and left have little meaning at
this stage of the game—stack up
quite well. Russ Pome my is trying
his hand at tbe position after a spell
at fullback. The big fellow, with
only 18 or 20 practices behind him,
looks as if he will fit in well for
relief duty. He has a lot to learn
yet bul is very willing.
Owen Powell, Joe Jacob, and
Harry Dahlberg are to be consid
ered. Powell is the best of the
three and will see varsity action.
Jacob has been injured and has yet
to make his place. Dahlberg, a real
iwwiie, may make the team on
hustle and fight alone. He is a good
defensive man.
Pomeroy, Cook, and Pelsinser
will all fit in as middle l'ne back
ers when the Cards eo into a five

man defensive line. Pomeroy is last
for all his 205 pounds, and should
round into form come September.
The guard spot is made up lor the
most part of inexperienced men. If
they weather the 194!) storm, Coach
Marchie Schwartz will have a fine
