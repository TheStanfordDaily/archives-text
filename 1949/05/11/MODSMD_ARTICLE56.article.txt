# Frosh Nine to Host San Jose State Yearlings Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 Stan-- 1
ford's frosh baseball team will at
tempt to pull out ol a recent slump
in which the team has been one
run short in two out of the last
three games, including a tight 3-2
battle with Cal.
The Papooses' opponent Thursday
is the San Jose State frosh. SJS has
already beaten the local freshmen
once this season —a confusing 5-4
time-limit victory which was actu
ally p'ayed 10 minutes beyond the
deadline.
Despite the abbreviated length of
the iirst meeting, the JC's have
proved themselves a team with
which the Cardlings will have to
struggle to push under this time.
Last time the state school boys
beat Everett Dean's ace left-hander
Frank Hamilton but they only got
four hits.
Coach Dean will probably throw
Hamilton at the gold and white
team again in hopes that this time
the opposition will get less runs
than hits.
Leading the Card hitters to the
plate will be Dangerous Dan Sulli
van who is hitting at a stupendous
.455 clip. His 15 hits include one
double, two triples, and one home
run.
Batting averages of players in
ten games.
