## 
### 
The Stanford Eye Bank supplied
corneal material for 24 eye graft
operations during its second year
of operation. Dr. Loren R. Chan
dler, dean of the University's med
ical school, reported yesterday.
Hospitals in San Francisco were
the major source of the corneas,
but eyes were also supplied from
Oakland, San Jose, Auburn, Burlin
game. Redwood City, Stockton.
Tulare, and San Diego.
Most of the operations were per
formed in San Francisco. In line

with the Eye Bank's policy of sup
plying corneal material to other
areas when there are no patients
requiring the operation locally, two
eyes were sent to Tulare and one to
Los Angeles for use in transplant
operations there.
In its first year of operation the
Eye Bank provided 33 corneas for
eye graft operations.
The humanitarian mission of the
non-profit, public service Eye Bank
is to act as a collection and clearing
agency for human eyes, the corneas
of which can be transplanted to the
eyes of individuals who are blind
from corneal defects.
All competent Pacific Coast eye
surgeons qualified ta perform the
eye graft operation are eligible to
use the services of the Eye Bank,
which operates without cost to ei
ther patient or surgeon except for a
small service fee.
