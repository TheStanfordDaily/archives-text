# Wallace Accuses Groups Of Leading U.S. to War
## 
### MARGE SAMPSON 
Five groups are leading the United States into war with Rus-'
sia: members of the Catholic hierarchy, United States news
papers, certain expropriated groups in this country, Tory leaders i
in England, and some leaders of military-affiliated businesses in
the United States.
Henry Wallace made this statement yesterday at a press con- |

ftrence for nine representatives of*
Bay Area college newspapers.
I nintcntional Pushing
He said he thought members of j
these groups were not intentionally
pushing this country into war with
Russia, but were following policies
that could not help but lead the
I nited States into war.
Wallace is on tour with H. Lester |
Hutchinson, Labor member of the
British House of Commons, and Mi
ehele Giua, Left-Socialist member
i the Italian Senate. The purpose
of the nationwide forum is to decide
"How we can bridge the dangerous
ly widening gap between East and
West."
World Trade
In speaking against the North At
lantic Pact, Wallace said that the
agreement would weaken world
trade. He said there should be a
world trade commission to co-ordi
nate the capitalistic and Communist
economies.
Hutchinson said England is suf
fering economically because of the
present military and political divi
sions in the world today. He said
Russia and England each producc
what the other needs, and the pres
ent political situation is hurting
both countries.
Italian Trade
Italian Senator Giua said political
tension had hurt the international
trade of Italy. The American Con
trol Commission of ERP prevented
the export of trucks to Czechoslo
vakia and Poland for fear that they
might be used for war purposes.
Giua said the countries also needed
the trucks for rebuilding of the two
countries. He wanted to know who
is to say what is for war and what
for peace.
Giua also said the political activ
ities of the Vatican are leading to
.11 anti-clerical movement in Italy.
He said the Catholic clergy are
pushing fascist officials into high po
litical and educational offices in
Italy. These officials are encourag
ing production of war materials and
retooling for war. "Once a fascist,
always a fascistâ€”and a fascist is al
ways thinking of war," said Giua.
British Opinion
Hutchinson, in answer to a ques
tion on how the British public would
feel about admitting Spain to the
North Atlantic Pact, said Franco is
a fascist war criminal in British eyes
and they would not stand for Spain
signing the pact.
Giua said letting Spain sign the
pact would be an offense to demo
cratic tradition. He said Spain's
signing would "leave a fascist poi
son in Spain and in Europe, and
would be a danger to the peace of
the world."
