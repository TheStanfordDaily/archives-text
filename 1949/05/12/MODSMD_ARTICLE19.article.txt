## Program Undermined

The value of any election assembly is to acquaint the voters
with as many of the candidates as possible. Tuesday afternoon
the ASSU held its annual election assembly—at 1 p.m.
In the past this program has been scheduled at 11 a.m., a more
convenient time for most students. Although the University's
Committee on Public Exercises chairman favored the morning
fcour, short-sighted committee members complained that the
lost hour could not be made up. Their complaint took the form
of a pre-arranged decision when the Election Board chairman
ssked the committee to cancel Tuesday's 11 o'clock classes.
The results of the assembly were as expected. Memorial Audi
torium was not filled, and when the program ran overtime as
usual, some students had to leave in order to get to their 2 o'clock
classes. The late hour undermined the full success of the pro
gram.
Students ask for very few open hours. But when such a request
is made of the committee, its members should consider the pur
pose of the program in relation to student government as com
pared to only one hour of class time. Most professors can make
i:p that lost hour, but many students this week had no other
way to compare all of the ASSU candidates during a single hour.
