## Van Gindertael's Articles Untimely, Copied 
### 
To t.he Editor:
Lake my friends from Asia, I sincerely regret the publication of van
Gindertael's articles on the Republic of Indonesia. Even though most of
the facts van Gindertael mentions about Indonesia and the attitude of
the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia are correct, it seems inopportune
to publish those facts in such a provocative way, at a time when the gov
ernment of the Netherlands and the Security Council Committee on Indo
nesia are doing everything in their power to assure good relations with
the Republic of Indonesia.
Last week the government of the Republic of Indonesia was restored to
its capital and an agreement was reached between the government of the
Netherlands and that of the Republic, of which the Netherlands hope it
will mark the beginning of a new period of cooperation.
Van Gindertael did not know these facts, which a simple reading of
newspapers could have taught him.
The articles of van Gindertael were a copy, almost word for word
exact, of an article published in the Dutch magazine "Oils Vrije Neder
and —in hnglish—on March 5, l!)4f). Vol. 8, No. .'Mi. It surprised me
:hat van Gindertael did not mention that. This magazine does not rep
resent at all the opinion of the Dutch government.
I understand the considerable pain and regret these articles have
caused my friends from Asia, and wish to express the hope that the arti
cles will not cause any hard feelings toward my country on their part.
Jt is necessary that we try to understand each other, even though we
have different standpoints, and name-calling, like in these articles, does
not do us any good.
