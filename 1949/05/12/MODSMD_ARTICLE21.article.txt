# Dutch Interests Questioned

To the Editor:
The time spent by this writer in Southeast Asia, while considerable,
certainly does not qualify him as a political expert. However, one state
ment by Jan van Gindertacl, Stanford's foremost Dutch apologist, cries
for refutation, expeit or not.
He states, ''The Dutch are not convinced these are the men in whose
hands the future of a truly free and democratic Indonesia is safe
I submit that Dutch convictions are highly irrelevant in this case. The
Indonesian question is properly a problem for the Indonesians and the
United Nations. Hie Dutch have little legal (and no moral) interest in
the politics of Asia, beyond this interest as a member of the United Na
tions, and certainly no more interest than has say, Peru.
I should like to hear Mr. Van Gindertael's justification for unilateral
intervention by the Dutch in Indonesian politics.
