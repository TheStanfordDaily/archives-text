### 
Collections of toys for the chil
dren at the Stanford Convalescent
Home will begin today in all living
qroups. Julie Pettitt, chairman of
Toys, said yesterday. Each person
is asked to give one toy.
Toys can be either old or new,
but must be in good' condition.
They must also be small, for they
will be used by young children on
their beds.
Trucks will come by the resi
dences Wednesday afternoon to
pick up the toys and will take them
to the Con Home. The children's
old toys will be painted at the Home
Wednesday as part of Con Home
Labor Day.
