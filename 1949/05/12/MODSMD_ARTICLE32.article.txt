# Foreign Scholarship Com To Name Winners Soon
## 
### 
Names ot next year's foreign
scholarship students* should be
known by next week, Frank Wolff,
chairman of (he foreign scholarship
committee, announced yesterday.
With the encouragement of a
$5,O(Mt grant from Excom anil an
additional $250 from the class of
48, as well as that of the participat
ing students, the commitee has
gone ahead with its plans for bring
ing a maximum of six students from
abroad for study at Stanford next
year.
'We feel, stated Wolff, "that the
program has worked very well, that
although because it was new there
were difficulties which arose, it has
definitely proven successful." Proof
ot the success ol the program, or of
its value in the eyes of the students,
is shown, he said, by the fact that
not only have the seven scholarship
students directly expressed their
approval, but the living groups who
participated this year are the same
ones requesting to participate next
year.
Excom Cut Foreign Grant
Wolff said that the cutting of the
Excom grant from this year's $9,000
to $5,000 for next year made it im
possible to bring over seven stu
dents as was done in this initial
program. However, he stated, with
the aid pledged by the American
Military Government paying the
transportation of any Austrian or
German students, and with almost
certain assistance under the Full
bright Act, neither of which was
used this year, the committee be
lieves it will be able to meet the
needs of five or possibly six stu
dents.
Applications were sent abroad as
early as February. Students from
each nation made application
through governments, international
educational organizations, universi
ties, and individuals. At Stanford,
â€¢he applications were first reviewed
by the administration and then
passed on to the foreign scholarship
committee. The committee then
screened the remaining applica
tions, looking for persons of all
round excellence, both scholastically
and socially. Final selections were
made by the living groups where
the students were to live.
Publicity Pamphlet Ready
Wolff says that the committee
hopes to make the many unaccept
able though very fine applications
available to other universities in
itiating similar programs.
The administration has recently
appropriated $200 toward issuing a
pamphlet publicizing Stanford's part
in initiating this new program. It is
now printed and will soon be issued
under the joint auspices of the stu
dent body and the administration.
Displaced Student Plan
An entirely separate project of
the foreign scholarship committee
recently received a unanimous vote
of confidence from Excom. This is
their proposed plan to bring a dis
placed person to the United States,
for his first year to Stanford, to help
him start, as they term it. a "new
life."
The plan includes bringing the
person to Stanford for one year's
study, during which time he could
become acquainted with America
and the opportunities here. After
this time, he would be helped in
securing full - time employment or
employment to help him work his
way through college. In any case,
his stay here would be permanent
as an American citizen.
Although Excom made no specific
monetary appropriation when it ap
proved the project. Wolff says the
matter is to be brought up soon.
Some support will come from WS
SF. which will pay the student's
transportation, and from SIRO.
which has agreed to pay half the
tuition.
