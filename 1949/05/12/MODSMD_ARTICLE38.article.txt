# Vets Must Cancel Non-wanted Leaves
## 
### 
Veterans who do not wish to take
15 days leave at the end of spring
quarter should request cancellation
of leave within the next five days.
Leave is automatically granted at
the end of this quarter unless re
quest is made in writing that it not
be granted.
Regular subsistence allowance is
paid during the leave period, and
entitlement will be charged even
though the veteran is no longer in
school.
Requests should be sent to the
VA Regional Office, 49 Fourth
Street, San Francisco.
