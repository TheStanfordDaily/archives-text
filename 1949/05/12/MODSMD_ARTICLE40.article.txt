# Lunts' Show Charms S.F.
## 
### DIXIE BOOTH 
Two of the most charming figures
in the theater today are currently
appearing at the Geary in Sail
Francisco.
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontannc
have returned to the West Coast in
a new drawing room comedy by S.
N. Behrman, "I Know My Love,"
which they plan to open on Broad
way next fall.
The Lunts, so completely familiar
with the theater and with each oth
er, have found in "1 Know My
Love" a vehicle which is extraordi
narily well suited to their talents, if
not unduly distinguished otherwise.
The play moves in correct Boston
society from 1888 to 1939, and puts
the Lunts in delightful character
from an impetuous courtship to a
comfortably senile golden wedding
anniversary. The immaculate Bos
tonian Tom Chandler is portrayed
with forthright good humor by Mr.
Lunt; Emily, his wife, is given vital,
clear wit and enormous femininity
by the poised Miss Fontanne.
Always magnificently at ease on
the stage, the Lunts frequently cur
ry on a separate conversation be
tween themselves while to all ap
pearances they are engaging in en
ticingly bright repartee. They will
celebrate their 25th year of lively
co-starring next October.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Lunt are fond
of California, and agree that San
Francisco audiences compare most
favorably with those in New York.
In iact, they are firmly convinced
that a play which goes over well in
San Francisco will be good any
where.
''I Know My Love" will be pre
sented through Saturday.
