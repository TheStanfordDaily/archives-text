# ATO, Village Nines in Mural Playoff
## 
### 
Softball at its best will be dis
played this afternoon when Village
314's big bats go into action against
the Battling Bradshaws, otherwise
known as Alpha Tau Omega.
First pitch is set for 4:30 on Dia
mond two with both clubs being
ready to have at it with all they've
got in the all-important intramural
semi-finals for the University
championship.
The victor will go on to meet
Theta Chi's high-flying Reds in the
finals which will be held Monday
on the same diamond at the same
time.

Village 314, a heavy-hitting come
through outfit, whisked itself into
the semi-finals by dint of a flashy
6 to 3 victory over Phi Kappa Sigma
last Monday.
The Villagers will be out to offer
more of the same this afternoon, but
in locking horns with powerful ATO,

they will be getting into hot water.
Led by the rootin'-tootin' two-gun
Jack Bradshaw, the classiest soft
ball twirler in the area, ATO's
Laughing Boys have brushed aside
all opposition, and have placed their
sights directly on the hotly-sought
mural pennant.
Helping brother Jack along the

championship trail will be two other
Bradshaws, catcher Dick and center
fielder Dwight.
Last season this talented trio
sparked the Laughing Boys into the
final struggle before a pesky Fire
house nine rose up to snatch the
flag right out from under their noses,
3 to 2 in a 17-inning marathon.
It has been said that all the ATOs
need to do to win is to set Brad
shaw on the mound with a catcher to
toss back his slants. The rest of the
boys can set up a card game or
stroll off to pick daisies.
However, the ATOs don't expect to
play it that casually, and what with
the best defensive outfield in the
league, featuring Don Richardson in
left, Dwight Bradshaw in center,
and cool Clayton Neal in right,
they'll be on the job to handle any
freaks that come their way.
Village 314 will base its attack on
the salvo-sticks of Gene Hoo and
Bob Parkhill, the two men who
ruined the Phi Kaps with timely
blasts last time out.

SOFTBALL TODAY
ATO vs. Village 314
Diamond 2, Mural Field
4:30 p.m.
Softball at its best will be dis
played this afternoon when Village
314's big bats go into action against
the Battling Bradshaws, otherwise
known as Alpha Tau Omega.
First pitch is set for 4:30 on Dia
mond two with both clubs being
ready to have at it with all they've
got in the all-important intramural
semi-finals for the University
championship.
The victor will go on to meet
Theta Chi's high-flying Reds in the
finals which will be held Monday
on the same diamond at the same
time.

Village 314, a heavy-hitting come
through outfit, whisked itself into
the semi-finals by dint of a flashy
6 to 3 victory over Phi Kappa Sigma
last Monday.
The Villagers will be out to offer
more of the same this afternoon, but
in locking horns with powerful ATO,

they will be getting into hot water.
Led by the rootin'-tootin' two-gun
Jack Bradshaw, the classiest soft
ball twirler in the area, ATO's
Laughing Boys have brushed aside
all opposition, and have placed their
sights directly on the hotly-sought
mural pennant.
Helping brother Jack along the

championship trail will be two other
Bradshaws, catcher Dick and center
fielder Dwight.
Last season this talented trio
sparked the Laughing Boys into the
final struggle before a pesky Fire
house nine rose up to snatch the
flag right out from under their noses,
3 to 2 in a 17-inning marathon.
It has been said that all the ATOs
need to do to win is to set Brad
shaw on the mound with a catcher to
toss back his slants. The rest of the
boys can set up a card game or
stroll off to pick daisies.
However, the ATOs don't expect to
play it that casually, and what with
the best defensive outfield in the
league, featuring Don Richardson in
left, Dwight Bradshaw in center,
and cool Clayton Neal in right,
they'll be on the job to handle any
freaks that come their way.
Village 314 will base its attack on
the salvo-sticks of Gene Hoo and
Bob Parkhill, the two men who
ruined the Phi Kaps with timely
blasts last time out.
