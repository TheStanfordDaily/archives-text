The crew situation around this school stinks.
A San Francisco newspaper last week referred to this situation as "the
cold war'' between the Stanford crew and the Athletic Department. The
rugged part of it is that "cold war" is an excellent description of the
struggle. Our "poor orphan crew" has gained for itself reams of copy
on the intensity of their fight, the fortitude of their members, and the
nastiness of the Athletic Department in its presumed attempt to throttle
the crewmen.
I like crew. I think it's a great sport, and no one has more respect for
the gang that gets up at dawn every day to pull an oar on that stinking
cesspool that they must row in. But the Athletic Department and its
officials, 1 think, have been the victims of some very bad, some very inac
curate, and some very wrong newspaper publicity. Therefore, this morn
ing, I would like to put down a bit of the administration's side of this
situation.
Dimes, Dollars, and Crew
The one, the only, thing that is stopping crew from getting financial sup
port from the SAC is money. It's a nasty little item, but the SAC simply
does not have it to give to the crew, no matter how much they deserve it
or no matter how much they agitate for it.
The University of California, which our crew would have its big com
petition against, spends over $35,000 per year for its crew. The U of
Washington, which we would also like to compete against, spends nearly
$40,000 per year for crew. To make things even more pessimistic, Yale—a
school which is more similar to Stanford in many ways than are the
other two—spends the staggering figure of $90,000 per year for its crew!
The SAC, now, is on a budget (an undisclosed sum) doled out yearly
to them from the Board of Trustees via the President's office. And while
the crew says that it can get along nicely with $10,000 per year, the
budget that Masters & Co. get to work with simply will not allow that
extra ten-grand expenditure.
In short, if Lew Linsey—No. 1 crew tub-thumper—were sitting at Mr.
Masters' desk, he could not give crew the necessary money without dan
gerously hampering or destroying some of the sports already in circulation
—golf, tennis, rugby, soccer, or even baseball.
In answer to this, crew coach "Ace" Clark—who had very carefully
and very commendably stayed out of the "cold war" and the dirty poli
tics accompanying it—says, "There is no mathematical proportion between
the quality of the crew and the amount of money spent on it." And be
points to Yale's poor crew as an example. Commander Clark figures that
our crew can get along fine on that $10,000 a year. This would enable
them to hire two coaches, travel to Washington, keep up repairs, and
send crews to Poughkeepsie.
But the fact remains—no matter how great our crewers are—that two
and two Still make four and that $10,000 is still $10,000. And the SAC is
taking a publicity beating on a subject over which it has no controL
Coach Clark, who is not one of the publicity hounds, is the first to admit
this. "Except for overestimating the cost of crew," he said, 'T feel that
Mr. Masters has made a sincere survey of the situation and feels that'
crew won't fit into the budget. Then there is something violently the
matter with the budget."
Contrary to the printed opinion of most Bay Area newspapers and even
more students, the budget is something that the much eursed-at SAC
has no control over.
The ' Cold Wa' Must Co
There is in this column one very big and very definite point I want to
bring out. The "cold war" between the two different factions has created a
situation which, at best, is unhealthy. The crew, right now, enjoys a posi
tion equal with the ski team and the polo team—they are given their Circle
S letters, but no financial aid. The crewmen feel —with some
that they are deserving of financial aid. The SAC sympathizes but
not have enough budget to give them said aid. Now the big blast is on.
The result is that the Athletic Department—and hence Stanford itself—
is getting some bad and very unuseful publicity.
I feel that the whole problem should be, and must be, solved. And
it can be solved by mediation and compromise. The crew will, I think,
settle for less money than it now asks for. But the crew will never give
up its demands for a stable eight here at Stanford. The crewmen have
shown no tendency to give up yet, and I don't think they will.
Thus, I would like to suggest that representatives of the SAC and the
crew sit around a table with Dr. Sterling and thrash this thing out once
and for all. The "cold war" stuff makes good newspaper copy, but it cer
tainly isn't helping Stanford to recruit major athletes or to fight up to
the spot she held in the athletic world prior to the great war.

this. "Except for overestimating the cost of crew," he said, 'T feel that

has no control over.
The ' Cold Wa' Must Co
There is in this column one very big and very definite point I want to
bring out. The "cold war" between the two different factions has created a
situation which, at best, is unhealthy. The crew, right now, enjoys a posi
tion equal with the ski team and the polo team—they are given their Circle
S letters, but no financial aid. The crewmen feel —with some
that they are deserving of financial aid. The SAC sympathizes but
not have enough budget to give them said aid. Now the big blast is on.
The result is that the Athletic Department—and hence Stanford itself—
is getting some bad and very unuseful publicity.
I feel that the whole problem should be, and must be, solved. And
it can be solved by mediation and compromise. The crew will, I think,
settle for less money than it now asks for. But the crew will never give
up its demands for a stable eight here at Stanford. The crewmen have
shown no tendency to give up yet, and I don't think they will.
Thus, I would like to suggest that representatives of the SAC and the
crew sit around a table with Dr. Sterling and thrash this thing out once
and for all. The "cold war" stuff makes good newspaper copy, but it cer
tainly isn't helping Stanford to recruit major athletes or to fight up to
the spot she held in the athletic world prior to the great war.
The crew situation around this school stinks.
A San Francisco newspaper last week referred to this situation as "the
cold war'' between the Stanford crew and the Athletic Department. The
rugged part of it is that "cold war" is an excellent description of the
struggle. Our "poor orphan crew" has gained for itself reams of copy
on the intensity of their fight, the fortitude of their members, and the
nastiness of the Athletic Department in its presumed attempt to throttle
the crewmen.
I like crew. I think it's a great sport, and no one has more respect for
the gang that gets up at dawn every day to pull an oar on that stinking
cesspool that they must row in. But the Athletic Department and its
officials, 1 think, have been the victims of some very bad, some very inac
curate, and some very wrong newspaper publicity. Therefore, this morn
ing, I would like to put down a bit of the administration's side of this
situation.
Dimes, Dollars, and Crew
The one, the only, thing that is stopping crew from getting financial sup
port from the SAC is money. It's a nasty little item, but the SAC simply
does not have it to give to the crew, no matter how much they deserve it
or no matter how much they agitate for it.
The University of California, which our crew would have its big com
petition against, spends over $35,000 per year for its crew. The U of
Washington, which we would also like to compete against, spends nearly
$40,000 per year for crew. To make things even more pessimistic, Yale—a
school which is more similar to Stanford in many ways than are the
other two—spends the staggering figure of $90,000 per year for its crew!
The SAC, now, is on a budget (an undisclosed sum) doled out yearly
to them from the Board of Trustees via the President's office. And while
the crew says that it can get along nicely with $10,000 per year, the
budget that Masters & Co. get to work with simply will not allow that
extra ten-grand expenditure.
In short, if Lew Linsey—No. 1 crew tub-thumper—were sitting at Mr.
Masters' desk, he could not give crew the necessary money without dan
gerously hampering or destroying some of the sports already in circulation
—golf, tennis, rugby, soccer, or even baseball.
In answer to this, crew coach "Ace" Clark—who had very carefully
and very commendably stayed out of the "cold war" and the dirty poli
tics accompanying it—says, "There is no mathematical proportion between
the quality of the crew and the amount of money spent on it." And be
points to Yale's poor crew as an example. Commander Clark figures that
our crew can get along fine on that $10,000 a year. This would enable
them to hire two coaches, travel to Washington, keep up repairs, and
send crews to Poughkeepsie.

Dimes, Dollars, and Crew
The one, the only, thing that is stopping crew from getting financial sup
port from the SAC is money. It's a nasty little item, but the SAC simply
does not have it to give to the crew, no matter how much they deserve it
or no matter how much they agitate for it.
The University of California, which our crew would have its big com
petition against, spends over $35,000 per year for its crew. The U of
Washington, which we would also like to compete against, spends nearly
$40,000 per year for crew. To make things even more pessimistic, Yale—a
school which is more similar to Stanford in many ways than are the
other two—spends the staggering figure of $90,000 per year for its crew!
The SAC, now, is on a budget (an undisclosed sum) doled out yearly
to them from the Board of Trustees via the President's office. And while
the crew says that it can get along nicely with $10,000 per year, the
budget that Masters & Co. get to work with simply will not allow that
extra ten-grand expenditure.
In short, if Lew Linsey—No. 1 crew tub-thumper—were sitting at Mr.
Masters' desk, he could not give crew the necessary money without dan
gerously hampering or destroying some of the sports already in circulation
—golf, tennis, rugby, soccer, or even baseball.
In answer to this, crew coach "Ace" Clark—who had very carefully
and very commendably stayed out of the "cold war" and the dirty poli
tics accompanying it—says, "There is no mathematical proportion between
the quality of the crew and the amount of money spent on it." And be
points to Yale's poor crew as an example. Commander Clark figures that
our crew can get along fine on that $10,000 a year. This would enable
them to hire two coaches, travel to Washington, keep up repairs, and
send crews to Poughkeepsie.
But the fact remains—no matter how great our crewers are—that two
and two Still make four and that $10,000 is still $10,000. And the SAC is
taking a publicity beating on a subject over which it has no controL
Coach Clark, who is not one of the publicity hounds, is the first to admit
this. "Except for overestimating the cost of crew," he said, 'T feel that
Mr. Masters has made a sincere survey of the situation and feels that'
crew won't fit into the budget. Then there is something violently the
matter with the budget."
Contrary to the printed opinion of most Bay Area newspapers and even
more students, the budget is something that the much eursed-at SAC
has no control over.
The ' Cold Wa' Must Co
There is in this column one very big and very definite point I want to
bring out. The "cold war" between the two different factions has created a
situation which, at best, is unhealthy. The crew, right now, enjoys a posi
tion equal with the ski team and the polo team—they are given their Circle
S letters, but no financial aid. The crewmen feel —with some
that they are deserving of financial aid. The SAC sympathizes but
not have enough budget to give them said aid. Now the big blast is on.
The result is that the Athletic Department—and hence Stanford itself—
is getting some bad and very unuseful publicity.
I feel that the whole problem should be, and must be, solved. And
it can be solved by mediation and compromise. The crew will, I think,
settle for less money than it now asks for. But the crew will never give
up its demands for a stable eight here at Stanford. The crewmen have
shown no tendency to give up yet, and I don't think they will.
Thus, I would like to suggest that representatives of the SAC and the
crew sit around a table with Dr. Sterling and thrash this thing out once
and for all. The "cold war" stuff makes good newspaper copy, but it cer
tainly isn't helping Stanford to recruit major athletes or to fight up to
the spot she held in the athletic world prior to the great war.
