# Farm Has Strong Halfback Squadron for '49 Season
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
If spring practice showings are
any indication of what is to come,
the 1949 Big Red Machine will be
well geared with right and left half
backs. That in itself is no promise of
greatness, for the '46, '47, and '4B
squads had their share of good backs
and those seasons were not spec
tacular successes.
But in nine top -men out for
the positions at this time, Coach
Marchie Schwartz has a more. well
rounded group as well as a few indi
vidual stars. He should get more
blocking per man from these boys
''than in years past.
Back and leading the righ halves
is Bob White. Roamin' Robert hasn't
shown to his best this spring be
cause of injuries but a 5.5 yards
per-carry average of last year does
most of his arguing for him.
He is not the fastest of the group
or the most shifty, but he does his
playing when the chips are down
He gets my nod for starting half.
Close behind and probably ahead
of White on defense is Ken Peck.
Ken is a letterman of the 1947 team
but lost a round with the grades and
did not play last year. He is one
of the fastest men on the squad,
certainly one of the quickest react
ing. He is tops on defense and a
fair blocker. Schwartz might even
team Peck and White for defensive
duties.
Next in line come Mickey Titus
and John Banks. Titus is just now
looking like the ball player he was
in 1946. He is one of the few back
fieid men who will see action as a
linebacker .... a task he does bet
ter than just well. Mickey may well
do as a blocking back in a combi
nation of backfield fast men that
Schwartz can and may use.
Johnny Banks has been one of the
surprises of the spring practices. He
is fast, blocks well but is in very
good company. Should fit in some
where. Charles Brazel is the fresh
man contribution to the spot and
may end up much higher than now
placed. He was once a fullback and
may be shifted back to that posi
tion to make use of his driving
power. Watch this 18-year-old in
time to come.
; The left half position, while boast
ing but one returning letterman, is
thought by many to be the strongest
spot on the team. Chief contender
at this time is Holbrook Boruek, a
hard-running, good blocking, never
say-die transfer from Yuba Junior
College. Holy may make football
history before he is through. His
greatest block to landing among the
leading ground-gainers of the Con
ference is a guy by the name or
Harry Hugasian.
Harry is just good enough to beat

j Boruck out. Between the two of
I them they will make up one of the
i best one-two punches that the Coast
i fans have seen in years. Harry has
! played a bit of everything in his
young college career. Last year he
wound up playing quarterback for
Chuck Taylor's frosh.
Hugasian is a swivel-hipped run
| ner who loves the open-field stuff,
: and is a good blocker to boot. He is
: the closest thing to a breakaway
j threat on the team. He passes well
I and will be used to do just that. He
may turn up at safety when on de
fense. Next to Peck he is the best
defensive man on the squad. I look
I for great things from our Mad Ar
| menian.
Third on this list only because of
men such as Boruck and Hugasian
: is Boyd Benson. Boyd is the smallest
j man on the squad but not the fastest.
: He makes up for this by hours of
individual practice on perfecting his
plays. He shines on the quick open
ers and excels at open-field running.
He is a good pass catcher.
Dick Broome followed Bob White
from Glendale and, while he prob
ably will, not be the immediate flash
that White was, is good enough to
make the team on his first time out.
He runs well and is a better-than
average blocker. The last quality
may make him.
Not out for spring practice are
j Rupe Andrews and Dave Field. An
! Drews will do as a break-away
I threat but he will have to improve
\on the other jobs before he can
| crack the left half spot. He will
I get that chance from Sept. 1 to
the San Jose State game.
David Field is another case of a
: little man who makes good on de
! fense. He uses his 160 pounds to
best advantage and will make the
j team as a defensive halfback if for
! no other reason. He is a far better -
i than-average runner for that mat
; ter. Injuries hurt his play last year.
All in all the halfback positions
: are strong. The Cards will miss A1
Turriziani who will graduate. Jim
1 Nafziger will also be numbered
: among the missing as he intends to
transfer to the University of Ari
zona at the end of the year.
