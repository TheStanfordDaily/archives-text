# Bryan Wins 440 Trial To Place on Relay Team
## 
### 
Before the largest midweek track
crowd seen at Stanford's Angell
Field in many years, Captain Gay
Bryan romped to a two-yard vic
tory in 48.5 seconds over team
mates Pitch Johnson, Larry Hoff,
Cass Bly, and Rupe Andrews in a
hotly contested quarter - mile race
held yesterday afternoon.
Bryan dashed out of the blocks at
a tremendous pace, and led by a
full 10 yards at the 220 mark, where
he was clocked at a phenomenal
21.8.
However, with the wind bearing"
down against him on the final
straightaway,. Bryan eased up, and
coasted to a two-yard victory.
Pitch Johnson finished very fast
to nip teammate Larry Hoff at the
tape in 48.8, and sophomore Cass
Bly grabbed the fourth spot in 49.2.
Rupe Andrews, the fifth man, will
confine his Fresno Relays efforts to
both of the sprint relay events.
The four - man team of Bryan,
Johnson, Hoff, and Bly ran the
equivalent of a 3:13.6 in a normal
mile relay contest. Figuring the
three running starts in the relay at
six-tenths of a second apiece, and
subtracting this total from the
tracksters' efforts yesterday, the
sensational figure of 3:13.6 can be
obtained.
Incidentally, USC's best time of
the year is 3:15.7, made in the
Stanford meet. The Indian team
was a foot behind the Trojans then,
but things may be different when

the two teams compete in the Fres
no -Relays next Saturday. It will be
a race worth watching.
Cass Ely, the sophomore flash, !
will probably run the first lap of
the mile relay, as well as the med
ley. i
Though not figured to win their |
event, Stanford's medley relay team, j
composed of Ely in the quarter,
George Mooers in the half - mile.
Drew Terramorse in the three- I
quarters, and A1 Lyons in the mile,
wifl be right in there pitching.
Cal and USC, with their strong
half-milers and milers, are co-fa
vorites to cop the medley race at
Fresno.
