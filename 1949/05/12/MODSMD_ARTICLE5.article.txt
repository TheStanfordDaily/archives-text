# Excom Forbids Future Use Of Campaign Signs
## Spring Election 'Unsatisfactory' 
### 
A motion prohibiting tha use
of campaign posters in future
campus elections was unani
mously approved by Excom
last night.
The action came as the after
math of yesterday's ASSU final
elections, which Excom mem
bers described as having been
"totally unsatisfactory."
The Executive Committee also
passed the following measures with
regard to yesterdays and all future
elections:
1. Because many students evi
dently voted outside of their proper
class or voting district yesterday,
Excom recommended that the reg
istration books be checked and that
the names of all violators be re
ferred to Men's or Women's Coun
cils.
2. A recommendation will be sent
; to the Dean of Students that stu
dent body cards be stamped with
I class number and living group clas
! sification starting fall quarter.
.1. The names of the 3ti candidates
| who did not turn in their statements
of campaign expenditures will be
1 turned over to the Councils of Stu
dent Control for action.
Administration Protests
The motion to prohibit campaign
posters in future elections was made
after ASSU President Gus Chavalas
and Student Manager John Poo!
; disclosed that there have been many
; administration and alumni protests
1 against the indiscriminate posting of
campaign signs during the spring
elections.
"Student police have been de
stroying signs posted in unauthor
ized spots," Pool said. "But the can
didates have persisted in putting
them up as fast as we can tear
; them down."
Regulations Fail â€¢
"Mere regulations restricting the
! posting of signs to ASSU bulletin
I boards are apparently not enough."
j Pool concluded.
Gus Chavalas said that the post
j ers alone have actually contributed
little to election interest. The per
centage of participation yesterday
was no higher than the average vot
ing percentage in prewar elections
[ in which posters were not allowed.
Women's Row Representative Jan
i Robertson recommended that post
! ers be abolished altogether on the
basis that the time required to make
i them might be spent more profi
tably in actually meeting the voters.
Not Useful
It was generally agreed that cam
j paign posters are constructively
| useful oniy for listing a candidate's
i qualifications for office. The same
results might be accomplished by a
large, centrally located blackboard
that would lLst the names and qual
ifications of all candidates for office,
j Excom recommended that Eleo
i tion Board investigate the possibil
ity of constructing such a black-
I board for the next elections.
In other business last night. Ex
! com stood by its previous decision
j piving Toyon housing priority to
Village freshmen over those fresh
men who had spent their first year
on campus.
A motion that no student who has
been convicted of an Honor Code
violation shall be eligible to ho'd a
student office was tabled.
