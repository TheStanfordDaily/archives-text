# Show's Directing Given High Praise
## 
### SHIRLEY ANNE ELLSWORTH 
Snappy, catchy musical numbers 1
: »nd the master directing of Al- 1
len Fletcher raised "Baby - face
O'Flynn" above the ranks of just
mother musical.
The music was by far the best
""art ot the show, with the exception
: ul several badly Hatted notes. The
j plot, however, was more than a
iiitle weak, especially in the second
i act.
Fletcher's directing was apparent
throughout the show. Music and
dancing were so closely integrated
with acting that the result was a
I smoothly blended unit.
Bud Irving turned in a lively and
! convincing performance as "Baby
j face," the lead. His personality and
! enthusiasm carried the show in
| scenes that might otherwise have
i dragged.
It was obvious that most of the
singers were not picked for their
; acting ability, and vice versa. Sev
eral of the love ballads lacked any
punch.
The fast - moving pace of the
j crowd scenes, the colorful costumes,
; the elaborate scenery, and the lively
' f'mes added up to an outstanding
j Spring Show.
Hal Todd as Parson Potter and
Dou9f Rtreseff tts Mnym-- McCjtM
turned in their usual fine perform
ances. Paula Blanchard as Sadie
■ O'Flynn was very much in charac
ter.
The most outstanding scene in the
! show was "The Church Box Social,"
i particularly the number "A Bash
! ful Boy," a duet bv George Eclc-
I stein and Irving. The Gracie and
i Wally dance and song number was
very cleverly done.
