# Class of '99 Holds Its 50th Reunion
## 
### 
Stanford graduates of the Class
of '99 — the smallest ever to enter
Stanford—will hold their 50th re
union on the campus this weekend.
Some 30 of the 129 surviving
members of the class will attend the
17th Annual Stanford Alumni Con
ference Saturday and then remain
over for a reunion program Sunday,
highlighted by a class luncheon at
the Stanford Union.
Alumni Director Jack W. Shoup
was astonished to find that there
were 129 survivors of a class which
had originally numbered only 110
students. The answer to what
seemed a mathematical impossibil
ity was found to lie in the fact that
the class had had an extremely low
mortality loss, and that it had
gained many members from gradu
ates who chose affiliation wiih the
Class of *913 rather than with '98
or '00.
