## Excom Takes Action 
### 
Excom was fighting mad Wednesday night. Within a 10-
minute period the following facts were released concerning the
spring election:
1. Campaign posters were flying all over the countryside, and
every rule in the books concerning their restriction had been
broken.
2. Several candidates tore down their opponents' posters when
ever possible.
3. Voters jumped their class year and residence districts to
vote for "favored" candidates.
4. At least 30 candidates did not turn in their campaign ex
pense accounts.
The blame for the election week misbehavior falls directly on
the voters and on the candidates. When Election Board reported
the above four points to Excom, the group moved to take im
mediate action to show that ASSU rules mean exactly what
they say.
Campaign posters were banned by a unanimous vote. Instead,
next year's Election Board will have the power to set up a Central
ASSU bulletin board listing offices, candidates, and miscella
neous data.
Thirty candidates who did not file their expenses with the
Election Board will have to explain their failure to Men's and
Women's Councils.
An unestimated number of students who "switch voted" will
appear before their respective councils. In some of the more
flagrant violations, graduate and upper division students voted
for lower division Excom candidates.
Excom took a constructive step to prevent similar violations
next year. A recommendation will be sent to the Dean of StLidents
reguesting class year and living group identification to be added
to the student body cards. We hope that the University will
agree with Excom opinion, because the card change will prevent
future dishonest voting.
One motion proposed to Excom was tabled. If passed, the pro
posed by-law would exclude from holding an elective ASSU of
fice any student who has been convicted of an Honor Code
violation or who has been convicted of misusing his ASSU of
fice. The tabling action was a wise move because the nature of
the by-law is too serious to be discussed and passed or turned
down in one evening.
We compliment Election Board for doing a good job this guar
ter in managing the four elections. We are sorry that the stu
dents and voters did not co-operate with the Board.
