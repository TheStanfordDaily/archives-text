People are sure odd. If you tell a man there are 279,678.953,342 stars
in the universe he'll believe you—but if a sign says '"Fresh Paint" he has
to make a personal investigation.
There was a busy hallway in the Village recently that was being re
painted. "Fresh Paint" signs hung all along the route —and in the corner
of each sign was a dab of paint labeled "test here." But Stanford students
are hard to convince, it seems. One culprit pointed out, "The paint dries
faster on tfie signs than on the walls."
One of the signs turned up a short time later with the "P" crossed out
of the word "paint" and a smudgy piece of art work added so that the
sign then read "wet ain't it?"
Signs on the highway are generally disregarded, too. There's one I've
never been able to prove, though—yet, at least. It says "Drive like hell,
and you'll get there."
Another one reads "Slow down before you become a statistic."
Some of those signs really do some good, though. Take the one near Port
land, Ore., which reads "Drive carefully and avoid accidents." Mr. and
Mrs. Roger Clark were saved from a plunge over a 50-foot embankment
when their car struck it.
In Connecticut again there was a little to-do over a couple of signs a
city official wanted moved or changed somehow. One read "Bristol
Hospital" .... and right beside it was a street sign reading "Dead End."
Hardly the best advertising.
During the war the cafes were the scenes of some of the most novel
whits of wit. One had posted "Courteous and efficient self-service." The
help situation was bad, but so was the food situation. You had to go to a
rodeo to see your steaks. In fact, one advertised thus: "Rodeo today—see
live steaks in action."
If you did manage to find someplace with a few spare steaks, and they
were generally spare, you were liable to see a sign something like this:
"If the steak is too tough for you, get out. This is no place for weaklings."
Even hot dogs were hard to get. One frankfurter stand that managed to
keep a supply on hand, advertised with the sign "Franks for the memory."
One gets a little nostalgic looking back to the prices of yesteryear. In
Seattle, in my native Washington, I saw a sign not long ago in the window
of the "OK Waffle Shop," down by the waterfront, which had this menu
on it: Plain steak. . , ,22c; bacon and eggs... ,20c; three friend eggs... .15c;
two fried eggs (side order)... ,sc.
No. I wasn't dreaming. There was another sign on the place reading
' For Sale. The place hadn't been doing business since the '30s.
Most of these eateries are leery about cashing checks. But most of them
are very polite about it. They say it genteelly—"We have an agreement
with the bank. They don't serve food and we don't cash checks . . . ." or
"If you are over 80 years old and accompanied by your parents, we will
give you credit."
The perversity of mankind is what keeps sign painters in business. There
is a partially disabled vet in Chicago cleaning up selling signs house-to
house which read—"No Agents," "Peddlers Keep Out." etc.
Queen Elizabeth of England stated it in a little stronger language. During
the Black Plague epidemic she had created a gallows outside her castle to
wain people away. They say a word to the wise is soon enough.
Or like the farmer put on the fence surrounding his fruit orchard—
"God help those who help themselves." The same idea is read in the sign
in a Delaware chemical plant. It says "If you insist on smoking, please
tell us where to send the ashes."
