# Chaplain's Chat

### PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
Tomorrow morning, beginning at
9 in the Women's Clubhouse audi
torium, the second section of the
campus Conference on Religion will
be held.
Extending and completing the
work done in the first section held
on April 30, this meeting will en
courage further discussion on Stan
ford religious needs and the possi
bility of creating some type of visi
ble organization to meet these needs.
Delegates will elect 18 persons, to
be added to the 12 who were named
last time, to form an exploratory
Committee of 30.
To this committee will be as
signed for study the results of the
discussions and the suggestions. It
is hoped that by the autumn quar
ter there can be a report made to
a similar convocation, with pro
posals by the committee.
A great deal of welcome interest
has been shown by Stanford stu
dents in this matter. A considerable
difference of opinion as to the form
such a religious organization should
take has been expressed—which is
altogether a wholesome situation.
The exploratory committee will
have the advantage of these opin
ions as it begins its study, though
it will not be, of course, bound by
any of them. If the study is to be
useful and constructive, the com
mittee must have utter freedom for
investigation and for its ultimate
proposals.
Let me repeat in this place what
has been said so many times, but
may need to be said again. For one
thing, the basic intent of calling
such a Conference on Religion is
that Stanford students may have a
chance to take the ball and carry it.
For the other, the particular form
that any proposed religious organ
ization may assume is rather im
material.
The main thing is to create some
kind of organization which will be
come visible; where Stanfordites
may identify themselves with an
ongoing program and feel that they
are specifically useful in the promo
tion and the conduct of religious ex
periences in this University.
The question has been asked if
membership in any such religious
organization would be in any sense
exclusive, or whether it would be
both actually as well as theoretically
inclusive.
I may not chart the future in this
particular, of course, but my answer
is that 1 hope we may have such
an association as will include every
one on this campus who desires to
identify himself with the work of
religion. The proposed name is
"Stanford Religious Association,"
for instance, rather than "Stanford
Christian Association."
If you are concerned at all about
this entire question, you are invited
to bo present tomorrow moining and
share in the Conference discussions.

take has been expressed—which is
altogether a wholesome situation.
The exploratory committee will
have the advantage of these opin
ions as it begins its study, though
it will not be, of course, bound by
any of them. If the study is to be
useful and constructive, the com
mittee must have utter freedom for
investigation and for its ultimate
proposals.
Let me repeat in this place what
has been said so many times, but
may need to be said again. For one
thing, the basic intent of calling
such a Conference on Religion is
that Stanford students may have a
chance to take the ball and carry it.
For the other, the particular form
that any proposed religious organ
ization may assume is rather im
material.
The main thing is to create some
kind of organization which will be
come visible; where Stanfordites
may identify themselves with an
ongoing program and feel that they
are specifically useful in the promo
tion and the conduct of religious ex
periences in this University.
The question has been asked if
membership in any such religious
organization would be in any sense
exclusive, or whether it would be
both actually as well as theoretically
inclusive.
I may not chart the future in this
particular, of course, but my answer
is that 1 hope we may have such
an association as will include every
one on this campus who desires to
identify himself with the work of
religion. The proposed name is
"Stanford Religious Association,"
for instance, rather than "Stanford
Christian Association."
If you are concerned at all about
this entire question, you are invited
to bo present tomorrow moining and
share in the Conference discussions.
Tomorrow morning, beginning at
9 in the Women's Clubhouse audi
torium, the second section of the
campus Conference on Religion will
be held.
Extending and completing the
work done in the first section held
on April 30, this meeting will en
courage further discussion on Stan
ford religious needs and the possi
bility of creating some type of visi
ble organization to meet these needs.
Delegates will elect 18 persons, to
be added to the 12 who were named
last time, to form an exploratory
Committee of 30.
To this committee will be as
signed for study the results of the
discussions and the suggestions. It
is hoped that by the autumn quar
ter there can be a report made to
a similar convocation, with pro
posals by the committee.
A great deal of welcome interest
has been shown by Stanford stu
dents in this matter. A considerable
difference of opinion as to the form
such a religious organization should
take has been expressed—which is
altogether a wholesome situation.
