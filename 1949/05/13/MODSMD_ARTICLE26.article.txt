Harvard Crimson sportscribe
Donald Carswell noted in his col
umn, "The Sporting Scene," some
Farm-warming comments by Art
Valpey, Harvard football mentor.
Seems Mr. Valpey classifies Army,
Cornell, and Stanford among the
"top 15 teams in the nation" for the
coming season, and dourly stated
that if Harvard could earn a 50-50
record in its first four games Stan
ford, Columbia, Cornell, and Army)
the Crimson would be a "definite
power in the East."

The Harvard Crimson reports that
a bill to eliminate the "teaching of
atheistic Communism" in Massachu
setts schools and colleges was ap
proved by the House of Represen
tatives of the General Court of Mas
sachusetts.
Originally, (he bill proposed to de
prive any educational institution in
Massachusetts of its tax exemption
if it employed an advocate of "athe
istic Communism" on its faculty.
The revised bill provides for a $1500
fine and one year in jail for any
teacher found guilty of advocating
Communism.
