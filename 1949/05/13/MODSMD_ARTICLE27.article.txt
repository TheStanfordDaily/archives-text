## 'Constructive View' 
### 
To the Editor:
In his reply to Stanford students who have criticized his articles on
Indonesia, Mr. van Gindertael has thrown out a "challenge to give a
"constructive view" of Indonesian events. From the tone of his articles
and his challenge, it would appear that he believes his view to be con
structive."
His view, in my opinion, has been the opposite of constructive. As the
result of his highly emotional and dogmatic approach to a problem which
involves deep feelings on both sides, he has succeeded in stirring up
resentment and antagonism.
To resort to accusations of a generalized nature on serious issues that
are presently trying to be thrashed out, does not contribute to theii
understanding.
Certainly a more objective, rational approach on the part of both sides
(for there are Asian "van Gindertaels" as well) would lead to a fairer
estimate of each other's position.
The Indonesian record has not been pure white. But neither has the
Dutch record and van Gindertael has succumbed to the failing of those
columnists who take the position that the other side is entirely to blame
and then turns to calumny in the attempt to prove his point.
At this very critical juncture in the relationships of the West with
Southeast Asia, this type of approach is indeed regrettable.
