There is something quite remarkable about the letters to The Daily
criticizing Jan van Gindertael's articles on Indonesia. They call his articles
all sorts of names, such as "immature," "completely inaccurate, "delib
erate distortions," and "maliciously false propaganda."' Yet Mr. Ginder
tael's critics have not furnished a single example of what they mean.
They have not supplied a bit of evidence to support their charges.
The question is, are the statements in these articles correct or are they
not? If they are not, would it be so difficult to show just where they are
wrong?
Mr. Gindertael is a highly competent—and accurate—interpreter ot
world affairs. I hope that The Daily will continue to feature him as a
columnist.
