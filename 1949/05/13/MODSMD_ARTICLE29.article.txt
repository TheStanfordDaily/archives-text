To the Editor:
This is my answer to Bob Van Dijl's letter.
I readily admit I am a regular reader of "Ons Vrije Nederland." the
magazine he refers to. I have read the issue in question, which contained
a very good presentation of the Indonesian problem.
I quite agree that I have been much influenced by that issue and that
I tried to follow the article of "Ons Vrije Nederland" as closely as possible
in order to bring out a genuine Dutch viewpoint.
However, as I made quite a few alterations in that article, it was im
possible to quote "Ons Vrije Nederland." Moreover, I wanted to have
the article published under my own responsibility and to make cleat
that the views represented could not engage anybody but me.
I am very sorry for the trouble and confusion this raising of the Indo
nesian problem seems to have caused.
