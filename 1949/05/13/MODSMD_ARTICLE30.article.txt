Let's give the women tennis players a break!
There are about a half-dozen lower division women at Stanford who
are top-notch tennis players. In order to fulfill their lower division P.E
requirement they have to play for two hours a week on the girls' court.-
Since all of them are not in the same class, they receive absolutely no
competition. Because they spend most of their time playing girls worst
than they their ability deteriorates.
There are many male players who may not be good enough to make the
varsity but would nevertheless enjoy playing with these girls. Even the
varsity players (I being one. can speak for myself) would greatly prefei
playing a girl than a man who is considerably worse than he.
It was proposed to the Women's Athletic Department that these girls
tnipjnt be able to get P.E. credit for playing on the varsity courts. This
proposal was vehemently rejected—why. I cannot understand.
Let's give the girls a break and allow them P.E. credit for practicing
with the fellows. One thing is certain—they will never improve if they
play only among themselves.
