# Room Applications For Stern, Toyon Set New Record
## 
### 
Between 600 and 700 men applied
for room vacancies in Toyon and j
Stern Halls this week, registration j
officials estimated yesterday. This s
number represents the highest total |
ever to apply for vacancies at one j
time.
The room drawing will be held !
sometime next week, according to
men's housing committee chairman :
Dan Stone. Notification of successful
applicants will be withheld until late
in the quarter when the number of
incoming freshmen will be known.
There will be between 115 and 150
vacancies available in Toyon. The
number of rooms available in Stern
Hall is unknown, but is expected to â€¢
he a low number.
After registration officials had .
checked through some 400 applica
tion by yesterday morning, they re
ported that not one student had in
dicated a preference for Toyon over j
Stern. Stone pointed out that this |
preference check would make no
difference in case few or no rooms !
were available in Stern.
"The applicant high on the list will
still have priority, regardless of his j
preference check," he explained.
