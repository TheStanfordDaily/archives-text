# Sick and Destitute Children Given Hope by 1917 Chaplain
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
In the summer of 1917, just three months after the United States
declared war on Germany, the Reverend Charles D. Gardner,
then University chaplain, trained his guns on another enemy,
the sickness and poverty of Bay Area children.
With the generous help of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, Mrs. Bailey

'Willis, and other members of the
Stanford Family, the good "Padre"
Gardner organized the very first
session of what was two years later
known as the Stanford Convalescent
Home.
That memorable summer, 50 un
derprivileged San Francisco young
sters, most of them pale and under
nourished, were led from their
dreary, cooped-up hospital wards to
a new type of environment "down
on the Farm."
Isolation Hospital
The Stanford Isolation Hospital, in
; those days vacated during the sum
' mer, was their two-month summer
I home.
j As set up by Rev. Gardner and
his co-workers, it was a place where
I children who had officially been
| "cured" by the overworked city
| clinics came and. through the media
;of plenty of sunshine, recreation,
I and good food, regained their for
mer mental and physical strength.
To this day, that idea of recu
peration through a healthful con
valescence is the main purpose of
| the Convalescent Home program.
Until 1919. the home existed as a
| summer camp, with the 1918 group
| housed at the foot of Cooksey Lane,
j now the Phi Sigma Kappa frater
| nity house.
Official Title
' In 1919 it received the official title,
j "Stanford Convalescent Home."
Then in 1920, thanks again to the
Hopkinses, Senator Stanford's old
mansion just north of the Cactus
Gardens and bordering on the bank.-;
of San Francisquito Creek, was do
nated as the permanent site of the
Home. The mansion still stands,
now surrounded by three additional
units built during the intervening
1 years.
In an article in the "Stanford Il
lustrated Review" for May, 1920,
"Padre"' Gardner recalls the kids'
impressions when first shown their
new home:
Children's Impressions
"They found the floors were lovely
for sliding .... and .... in two
minutes were outside playing drop
the handkerchief on Leland Stan
ford's former playground . . . ."
With the permanent establishment
j of the Home, chief founder Gardner
! assumed the all-important job of
| President of the Board of Directors
of the Home, remaining in this ca
pacity until 19:46, when- Mrs. Ira D.
Lilliek replaced him. Mrs. Ruth At
wood was appointed director of the
Home that year and still holds that
! position.
