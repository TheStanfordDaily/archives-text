### ANN BUTCHER 
Tomorrow is Leland Stanford
Junior's birthday.
Leland Stanford Jr. was born on
May 14. 18(58, at the Stanford home
in Sacramento. He was very happy
as a boy. light-hearted and full of
fun. He was always interested in
whet was going on around him, and
took pleasure in being with people
and acquiring knowledge from
them, although he always relied on
his own judgment too, and had his
own ideas about things.
Leland was a born railroad man.
At a very early age he acquired an
interest in mechanics. His favorite
toys were miniature steam engines,
locomotives, and telegraph sets.
While traveling in the East with
his parents at the age of eight, he
visited the Centennial Exposition
there and saw all the machinery ex
hibitions. By the time he was 12
he knew all about the railroad
business. He designed locomotives
with improvements and learned the
fundamentals of the business in
cluding such things as the laying
of tracks.
Happ> Summer
While in the East in 187(>. Mrs.
Stanford decided that she and Lc
'and would spend the summer at a
coastal town in Maine. She later
said that this was one of ihe hap
piest summers of Lekind's life. He
grew tall and very tan. spending
most of his time on the beach. He
loved the sea and soon learned all
about ships from the fishermen
who lived there.
Soon after their return home the
Stanfords purchased the Gordon
estate and used the house on it for
their summer home. Mr. Stanford
named it Palo Alto, and it was
here that they all found many hours
of happiness and soon grew to call
this place their home. Leland liked
the outdoors, and would ride horse
hack over the fields all day lornr.
He loved picnics and hikes and
scent much time pursuing these
pleasures.
Leland was a pood student. Hi*
had a good memory, and spoke
French and German Huentlv. and
studied Latin and Greek. History
and mathematics were his favorite

subjects. In 1879. the Stanfords took
him on an extensive two-year trip
in Europe, and it was on this trip
that he gathered many items lor
his collection of antiques.
He had always been interested in
collecting rare and unusual an
tiques. and three rooms on the top
floor of the Stanford home in San
Francisco housed his collection. He
wanted to make the collection of
antiques his business, and spent
much time in the museums of Eu
rope and talking with professional
collectors.
Selects Harvard
By tHo fall of 1882 Leland had ad
vanced sufficiently in his studies to
enter a university, and Senator
Stanford wished him to consider
Harvard, so the family leased a
house in New York and moved
there. But in the following spring
Senator Stanford's health became
very poor, and the doctors ordered
him to go to Europe. The Stanfords
abandoned plans for Leland's en
trance in Harvard and went again
to Europe. In November of 1883
they started from Paris for Con
stantinople, and after spending
Christmas in Vienna, went on to
Turkey.
Leland enjoyed this trip even
more than he had the last one, and
made a collection of antique glass
that was extremely valuable. After
leaving Constantinople they went
on to Athens, arriving there in tlie
middle of January. Leland. despite
the weather, took in all the sights
of Athens, and often waded knee
deep in snow to visit places of in
terest.
On the trip to Rome from Athens,
I.eland became ill and was taken to
Florence, where it was hoped he
would improve. But he had con
tracted a hiyh fever, later diag
nosed as typhoid, and despite com
bined efforts of doctors called from
Paris and Rome, Leland died in
Florence on March 13, 1884. at the
age of 15.
As a result of his untimely death,
our University was founded as a
living tribute to this well-loved and
versatile boy. It is fitting that this
memorial should further the studies
that he so loved.


TOMORROW WILL BE the 81st anniversary of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
whose death brought ahout the building of Stanford University in his
memory. Young Leland was an ardent collector of museum relics, and
had his own museum on the top door of the Stanfords' Not) Hill home.
A special memorial to him is the University Museum, into which his
collection was moved.

Leland was a born railroad man.
At a very early age he acquired an
interest in mechanics. His favorite
toys were miniature steam engines,
locomotives, and telegraph sets.
While traveling in the East with
his parents at the age of eight, he
visited the Centennial Exposition
there and saw all the machinery ex
hibitions. By the time he was 12
he knew all about the railroad
business. He designed locomotives
with improvements and learned the
fundamentals of the business in
cluding such things as the laying
of tracks.
Happ> Summer
While in the East in 187(>. Mrs.
Stanford decided that she and Lc
'and would spend the summer at a
coastal town in Maine. She later
said that this was one of ihe hap
piest summers of Lekind's life. He
grew tall and very tan. spending
most of his time on the beach. He
loved the sea and soon learned all
about ships from the fishermen
who lived there.
Soon after their return home the
Stanfords purchased the Gordon
estate and used the house on it for
their summer home. Mr. Stanford
named it Palo Alto, and it was
here that they all found many hours
of happiness and soon grew to call
this place their home. Leland liked
the outdoors, and would ride horse
hack over the fields all day lornr.
He loved picnics and hikes and
scent much time pursuing these
pleasures.
Leland was a pood student. Hi*
had a good memory, and spoke
French and German Huentlv. and
studied Latin and Greek. History
and mathematics were his favorite

subjects. In 1879. the Stanfords took
him on an extensive two-year trip
in Europe, and it was on this trip
that he gathered many items lor
his collection of antiques.
He had always been interested in
collecting rare and unusual an
tiques. and three rooms on the top
floor of the Stanford home in San
Francisco housed his collection. He
wanted to make the collection of
antiques his business, and spent
much time in the museums of Eu
rope and talking with professional
collectors.
Selects Harvard
By tHo fall of 1882 Leland had ad
vanced sufficiently in his studies to
enter a university, and Senator
Stanford wished him to consider
Harvard, so the family leased a
house in New York and moved
there. But in the following spring
Senator Stanford's health became
very poor, and the doctors ordered
him to go to Europe. The Stanfords
abandoned plans for Leland's en
trance in Harvard and went again
to Europe. In November of 1883
they started from Paris for Con
stantinople, and after spending
Christmas in Vienna, went on to
Turkey.
Leland enjoyed this trip even
more than he had the last one, and
made a collection of antique glass
that was extremely valuable. After
leaving Constantinople they went
on to Athens, arriving there in tlie
middle of January. Leland. despite
the weather, took in all the sights
of Athens, and often waded knee
deep in snow to visit places of in
terest.
On the trip to Rome from Athens,
I.eland became ill and was taken to
Florence, where it was hoped he
would improve. But he had con
tracted a hiyh fever, later diag
nosed as typhoid, and despite com
bined efforts of doctors called from
Paris and Rome, Leland died in
Florence on March 13, 1884. at the
age of 15.
As a result of his untimely death,
our University was founded as a
living tribute to this well-loved and
versatile boy. It is fitting that this
memorial should further the studies
that he so loved.


TOMORROW WILL BE the 81st anniversary of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
whose death brought ahout the building of Stanford University in his
memory. Young Leland was an ardent collector of museum relics, and
had his own museum on the top door of the Stanfords' Not) Hill home.
A special memorial to him is the University Museum, into which his
collection was moved.
