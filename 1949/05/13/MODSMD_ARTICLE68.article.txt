# Kerkorian, Horn Lead Quarterback Candidates
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
The Stanford, or Shaughnessy,
version of the T formation is built
around, and succeeds or fails with,
one man—the quarterback. Without
a good quarterback the T is just an
other system. Stanford fans know
this from bitter experience.
Last year about this time Farm
fans were high on the quarterbacks.
But when it came to game condi
tions the goods were not delivered
and the T became just another sys
tem. Gone was the threat of a pass
ing attack and with it went a goodly
portion of the value of the T.
In spite of the experience of a
year ago. football filberts have un
tied the knot from the bag of com
pliments and have distributed the
contents lavishly on the shoulders
of freshmen Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn.
Kerkorian may be just the man
to wear the garland. He has been
far and away the best quarterback
of the spring practices. He is calm
under fire, calls a good play se

quence, handles the ball well. and.
what is most important, can throw
the ball—but good.
It is a heavy responsibility that
has been laid on this 19-year-old
lad. But coaches and fans alike have
taken to his style and manner. He
throws the short ones with great
accuracy and falls just a little be
low this on the long ones. The re
ceivers like the "feel" of the ball
and can hold on to it.
Dick Horn is good enough to give
even the likes of Kerkorian trouble.
Dick's main trouble is a lack of
confidence totally out of keeping
with his abilities. He rates but
slightly behind his teammate in
most departments but falls far be
hind in self-confidence — a factor
that shows through in his play. He
will develop and be in there for top
honors.
Tom Shaw is not out of the race
in my way of thinking. He topped
a weak passing staff last year with
a 44 per cent average, completing 24
out of 54 passes. Shaw lias im
proved greatly in the last month
and may surprise one and all come
football season.
Aubrey Devine is still the best
play caller of the group. However,
he cannot hit his receivers with any
consistency and will lose out on that
account.. But then that was the
prevailing opinion one year ago this
date. Aub still played a lot of ball.
Rating only slightly behind the
quarterback as the most important
man in the T formation is the full
back. The full must be fast and
should be the best blocker in the
backfield. He doesn't have to be big
but in this case the leading con
tenders for the starting berth are
rather big men.
Kill De Young has developed into
one of the hardest runners on the
squad. He is fast but has earned the
name of Bill the Bull for his line
bucking abilities.
De Young played behind Mitchell
for a greater part of the 1948 sea
son. He ended up sixth on the
squad in ball - carrying trips, but
topped one and all with a fat (i.4
yards per carry in 28 plays. This
speedy big man has what it takes
and rates the number one spot at
this time. My guess is that he will
keep the honor and show up very
well next year.
Second string in a position that is
not too deep is Eric Soutinvood.
Southwood is one of the best run
ning backs out but has far to go to
reach the level of Stanford full
backs in years past.

ing attack and with it went a goodly
portion of the value of the T.
In spite of the experience of a
year ago. football filberts have un
tied the knot from the bag of com
pliments and have distributed the
contents lavishly on the shoulders
of freshmen Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn.
Kerkorian may be just the man
to wear the garland. He has been
far and away the best quarterback
of the spring practices. He is calm
under fire, calls a good play se

quence, handles the ball well. and.
what is most important, can throw
the ball—but good.
It is a heavy responsibility that
has been laid on this 19-year-old
lad. But coaches and fans alike have
taken to his style and manner. He
throws the short ones with great
accuracy and falls just a little be
low this on the long ones. The re
ceivers like the "feel" of the ball
and can hold on to it.
Dick Horn is good enough to give
even the likes of Kerkorian trouble.
Dick's main trouble is a lack of
confidence totally out of keeping
with his abilities. He rates but
slightly behind his teammate in
most departments but falls far be
hind in self-confidence — a factor
that shows through in his play. He
will develop and be in there for top
honors.
Tom Shaw is not out of the race
in my way of thinking. He topped
a weak passing staff last year with
a 44 per cent average, completing 24
out of 54 passes. Shaw lias im
proved greatly in the last month
and may surprise one and all come
football season.
Aubrey Devine is still the best
play caller of the group. However,
he cannot hit his receivers with any
consistency and will lose out on that
account.. But then that was the
prevailing opinion one year ago this
date. Aub still played a lot of ball.
Rating only slightly behind the
quarterback as the most important
man in the T formation is the full
back. The full must be fast and
should be the best blocker in the
backfield. He doesn't have to be big
but in this case the leading con
tenders for the starting berth are
rather big men.
Kill De Young has developed into
one of the hardest runners on the
squad. He is fast but has earned the
name of Bill the Bull for his line
bucking abilities.
De Young played behind Mitchell
for a greater part of the 1948 sea
son. He ended up sixth on the
squad in ball - carrying trips, but
topped one and all with a fat (i.4
yards per carry in 28 plays. This
speedy big man has what it takes
and rates the number one spot at
this time. My guess is that he will
keep the honor and show up very
well next year.
Second string in a position that is
not too deep is Eric Soutinvood.
Southwood is one of the best run
ning backs out but has far to go to
reach the level of Stanford full
backs in years past.
The Stanford, or Shaughnessy,
version of the T formation is built
around, and succeeds or fails with,
one man—the quarterback. Without
a good quarterback the T is just an
other system. Stanford fans know
this from bitter experience.
Last year about this time Farm
fans were high on the quarterbacks.
But when it came to game condi
tions the goods were not delivered
and the T became just another sys
tem. Gone was the threat of a pass
ing attack and with it went a goodly
portion of the value of the T.
