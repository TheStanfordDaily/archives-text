# Footballers Finish Season Today
## Cards Hold Spring Game In Stadium 
### 
Twenty-nine days of toil and ef
fort will come to a climax this af
ternoon at 3:3U in the Stadium when
the Stanford football team holds its
annual Spring Game, Admission is
free.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has
shifted the Reds and Whites about
so that the starting teams of the
past two games are hardly recog
nizable. But enough of the same
personnel are still on the same
teams to cause the Reds to seek re
venge for the previous beatings and
to urge the Whites on to make a
clean sweep of the series. The
Whites won the fust encounters, 21
to 0 rind 33 to 2G.
The most important change of the
day involves the shifting of quar
terback Gary Kerkorian from the
White to the Red team. With him
goes left halfback Harry Hugasian.
But the Whites gained line
strength with the addition of for
mer Reds Don Fix. veteran guard,
and center Dick Abraham. These
men teamed with Jesse Cone, Wes
Poulson. Don Lucas, Bruce Van Al
styne. and Bill McColl give the
Whites a slight line advantage.
The Reds will counter with a
four - letterman line composed of
veterans A! Laakso and Ken Rose
at ends. A 1 Rau at tackle, and Hart
Cook at guard. Guard Tom August,
tackle Hal Walker, and center Gor
don Rice round out the Red front
wall.
It is in the Red backfield that the

issue may well be decided. In ad
dition to fresh aces Kerkorian an:.
Huuasian, the Reds wil lhave the
services of veterans Bob White and
Bill De Young. Back of these start
ers are such able performers a?
Mickey Titus. Holy Boruck. Jim
Hayes, and John Banks.
The White backfield will start off
with Dick Horn, Ken Peck. Boyd
Benson, and Eric Southwood ano
will have as reserves Charles Bra
zel, Bob Altick. Dick Broome, arid
Tom Shaw.

into a battle featuring Kerkorian'?
passes to Rose ancl Hugasian and
De Young's running for the Red
against Horn's tosses to McColl anc
Van Alstj ne. Benson's quick open
ers, and Peck's running for the
