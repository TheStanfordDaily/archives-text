(Editor's Note: This is the third

l ford buildings.)
The famous San Andreas Fault
1 passes through the Portola Valley,
! 412 miles southeast of the Univer
| sity, and runs for 600 miles up and
| down the Coast. Branching off is
the Hermit Fault, from which in
turn branches the Stanford Fault.
1 'Ilie latter runs beneath the Golf
j Course road and directly in front of
the President's home on San Juan
Hill.
At 5:13 on the morning of April
18, 1906, the earth moved along the
San Andreas Fault, and two severe
tremors .-hook $2,800,000 worth of
sandstone and equipment loose on
the Stanford campus.
When the dust from the 47-second
shock settled around the Quad, wit
nesses could not pick out the tow
| ering spire of Memorial Church, nor
the 110-foot chimney of the power
house. The spire of the church had
crashed down through the elegant
building, luckily missing the expen
, sive organ, the inner mosaics, and
! much of the stained glass windows.
Caught and crushed to death be
i neath the power house chimney, lo
cated behind the southeast corner
I of the Quad, was Otto Gerdis, a

young fireman, who had returned
to the boiler room to shut off the
power, lest tire break out.
Encina Death
Over at Encina, Junius E. Hanna
was killed when his room was car
ried to the basement by a falling
chimney. The south walls of both
wings of the hall also collapsed, ad
ding to the damage. At Roble, chim
neys also fell through the roof, but
damage was not so serious. How
ever, the impact of falling bricks
drove the legs of a piano through
the floor.
Elsewhere on the campus, whole
buildings were rendered useless.
The library walls collapsed com
pletely, leaving only the steel
frame and glass dome. The luxur
ious gymnasium was ruined beyond
practical repair; the front wall of
the chemistry building fell out; the
facade of Memorial Church, bearing
the Sermon on the Mount, fell down;
Memorial Arch was cracked down
both sides and had to be demolished;
the new wings of the Museum crum
bled, never to be replaced. In this
last destruction, many valuable col
lections were destroyed.
Inner Quad Damage
On the Inner Quad, the thick
sandstone buildings withstood the
shock, as did the Outer Quad, ex

cept for corner buildings and the
arcade, which were damaged. The
archway between the Geology and
Engineering Corners was completely
destroyed, and never replaced.
The Mausoleum, buiial place of
the Stanford family, was undamaged.
The marble canopy over the nearby
Angel of Crief, collapsed and one
wing was partially broken. The
angel, weeping among the debris,
presented a grim scene of tragedy.
Later, a souvenir hunter, one of
the many who descended upon the
University, broke a finger off the
statue, and it had to be entirely re
placed.
Row Damage
The Chi Psi House, thrown 10
feet off its foundations, was the
most serious damage on the Row.
The highest sentimental loss was re
ported by the SAEs, who lost a col
lection of steins valued at $200.
In San Francisco, the Nob Hill es
tate of the Stanfords' withstood the
earthquake, but was lost in the fire
that followed. The 1907 Quad was
destroyed on the presses of the H. S.
Crocker Co. in San Francisco. On
the Farm, the ranch home of the
Stanfords was badly damaged, but
later repaired. It is now the Con
valescent Home.

Caught and crushed to death be
i neath the power house chimney, lo
cated behind the southeast corner
I of the Quad, was Otto Gerdis, a

young fireman, who had returned
to the boiler room to shut off the
power, lest tire break out.
Encina Death
Over at Encina, Junius E. Hanna
was killed when his room was car
ried to the basement by a falling
chimney. The south walls of both
wings of the hall also collapsed, ad
ding to the damage. At Roble, chim
neys also fell through the roof, but
damage was not so serious. How
ever, the impact of falling bricks
drove the legs of a piano through
the floor.
Elsewhere on the campus, whole
buildings were rendered useless.
The library walls collapsed com
pletely, leaving only the steel
frame and glass dome. The luxur
ious gymnasium was ruined beyond
practical repair; the front wall of
the chemistry building fell out; the
facade of Memorial Church, bearing
the Sermon on the Mount, fell down;
Memorial Arch was cracked down
both sides and had to be demolished;
the new wings of the Museum crum
bled, never to be replaced. In this
last destruction, many valuable col
lections were destroyed.
Inner Quad Damage
On the Inner Quad, the thick
sandstone buildings withstood the
shock, as did the Outer Quad, ex

cept for corner buildings and the
arcade, which were damaged. The
archway between the Geology and
Engineering Corners was completely
destroyed, and never replaced.
The Mausoleum, buiial place of
the Stanford family, was undamaged.
The marble canopy over the nearby
Angel of Crief, collapsed and one
wing was partially broken. The
angel, weeping among the debris,
presented a grim scene of tragedy.
Later, a souvenir hunter, one of
the many who descended upon the
University, broke a finger off the
statue, and it had to be entirely re
placed.
Row Damage
The Chi Psi House, thrown 10
feet off its foundations, was the
most serious damage on the Row.
The highest sentimental loss was re
ported by the SAEs, who lost a col
lection of steins valued at $200.
In San Francisco, the Nob Hill es
tate of the Stanfords' withstood the
earthquake, but was lost in the fire
that followed. The 1907 Quad was
destroyed on the presses of the H. S.
Crocker Co. in San Francisco. On
the Farm, the ranch home of the
Stanfords was badly damaged, but
later repaired. It is now the Con
valescent Home.
