In the feature race of the evening, j
the mile relay, Stanford will send i
a team composed of Cass Bly. Larry
Hot!, Pitch Johnson, and Gay Bryan j
into the four-lap relay. On Fresno's j
fast track, there's no telling how
fast the four-man team could run.
Chief opponent again will be the
USC Trojans, who edged them in
the dual meet.
Besides anchoring the mile relay ;
team, Captain Gay Bryan will en
ter the high jump, the broad jump,
and will anchor the 880-yard relay.

ter event, with "Pell-MeU" Patton

SÂ»p]iumur.es in Medley

1320 respectively in the medley re
lay, with junior A 1 Lyons finishing
up with the mile.
In the field events, Stanford's
red-hot shot putters, Lew Davis and
Otis Chandler, will probably place

pends on the condition of LAAC's
ace Moose Thompson, Olympic win

shot.

discus; Don Campbell in the pole
vault, and Merritt Van Sant in the

OTIS CHANDLER: He with the
Shoulders will be out to break a
Fresno Relays record with 14>
pounds of steel ball. The big
question is, will it be he or Lew?
