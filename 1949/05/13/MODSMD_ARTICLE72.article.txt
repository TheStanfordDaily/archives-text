## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
Coach Bud Finger's golf team will compete in its last dual meet of the
season tomorrow morning when the Indians meet the California golf team
on the Stanford course at 9.
The Bears, coached by A 1 Sais. have a very impressive record this year.
They have won 14 matches, lost one and tied one. That loss was to UCLA
last week, 16 to 11. +

Sais will use Don Schwab, Bob
McPherson. Leo Evart, Sandy Mun
ro, Frank Minch, and Bob Hanna in
that order in hopes of repeating
California's earlier win over the In
dians. Schwab has averaged 72,5
strokes for 21 rounds of collegiate
play this year.
Bud Moe will play the No. 1 posi
tion for Stanford tomorrow, and will
be followed by Ernie Kellberg, Bob
Crozier, Jack Wallace, Cully In
gram. and Ralph Mills or Lynn Mil
ler. With the advantage fo playing
on their home course, Stanford
should battle the Bears right down
to the wire.
The undefeated Stanford freshman
team will play its toughest match of
the year against City College of San
Francisco following the varsity
match. CCSF has lost only one
match this year.

The frosh will be handicapped by
, the loss of their No. 1 man, Dick
McElyea, tomorrow. McElyea had
his appendix removed last Monday,
and is now resting in Palo Alto Hos
i pital.
Keith Beekman will move up to
the top position for this match, and
will be followed by Duffy Blabon,
Jack Sweeting, Bob Teits worth,
Chuck Stark, and probably Paul
Palmquist in the sixth spot.
