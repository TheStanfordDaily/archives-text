# Favored Farm Tennis Team Hits Spartans
## 
### WIN DANSTON 
Tennis fans will get another
chance to see the Stanford squad in
action today when the Indians tangle
with San Jose State on the home
courts at 1:30.
Coach Elwyn Bugge would not
commit himself on the outcome of
today's matches but he did indicate
that the Cards have an excellent
chance of downing the Spartans. He
revealed that he may shift the
starting lineup of the team, and he
would not do this if he were ex
pecting the tough kind of opposition
the Indians have been running into.
The regular lineup for the netters
is Bob Lewis, Kirke Mechem. Errol
Lycette, Fred Lewis, Lucien Bar
bour, and Vince Schmeider in the
singles. Coach Bugge said that he
may give some of these men a rest
and use Bruce Tal't, Dick White,
John Huneke, Phil Neilson. and
Kenneth Vosti to fill in for them.
San Jose is not the terror of the
Coast tennis squads. The Spartans
occupy the same position as Santa
Clara, an independent that can be
had by any of the PCC teams of
ordinary strength.
Although the Cards have not had
a whale of a season, they did all
right until they came to the powers
from the Southland. USC and
UCLA, and tough COP. So if the
Indians play tennis at all they should
send the Spartans back along Bay
shore a much sadder group than
when they headed tor the Farm.
