# Cards Get Last Shot At SC League Leaders
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's second division base
ballers will step up in class today
when they take their last whacks
at the league-leading USC Trojans.
Having departed yesterday on the
Noon Daylight, Harry Wolter's boys
will be in Los Angeles for a two
game series, and plan to stay just
long enough to give the Bovard
Bombers a run for their money.
The main purpose of the southern
junket is to offer a helping hand to
UCLA and Santa Clara, who have
chances to overtake Troy but can't
do it by themselves.
Stanford already waved a polite
goodbye to the CIBA race last
Tuesday night when the Cards
walked into a Santa Clara bat spree
and didn't find their way out of
the storm until 13 enemy runs had
crossed the Washington Park plat
ter and last hopes for pennant glory
had flown the coop.
The 13-7 loss to Santa Clara de
stroyed Stanford's last mathemati
cal chance of catching Troy, drop
ped the Cards deeper into fourth
place, and gave them a season rec
ord of 5 wins and (i losses.
The battle of the left-handed aces
will be on tap for this afternoon's
bill-of-fare with Lefty Dave Dahle
of the Cards matching slants with
Trojan Don Pender.
Both southpaws represent the
classiest that the CIBA has to offei

in pitching prowess. Dahle owns a
neat 4-1 league record, while Pen
der has done him one better at 5-1.
Troy is in the midst of a red-hot
win streak, the latest being an easy
toppling of San Francisco's Dons
which carried the string to 17 with

out a loss.
The weekend series will also fea
ture a battle between the league's 1
two best defensive ballclubs. Stan- ;
ford, with only IS errors in 11

i ranks tops in the double-play divi
j sion.
Jim Brideweser and Art Maxma-
I ?aines, is best in that department;
| USC, with the smoothest keystone
! combo the CIBA has ever seen,

nian have turned in 17 twin kill
ings in 10 games, which has helped
the Trojan chuckers out of more
than a few tight innings.
Tomorrow the boys will have at it
all over again, except that two new
hur'.ers, probably Indian Jack Hei
nan and Tro ; an Jack Schlarb, will
be on the hill.
Traveling south with Stanford is
Jackie Jensen's team, the Califor
nia Bears, who will face UCLA in a
two-game series on the other side
of town.


BILL ARCE. captain of the Big
Red nine, will attempt to pick up
his sagging" hatting average this
week as the Cards go after El
Trojan. Whether he hits or not,
Arcc's good fielding will contrib
ute greatly to a Cardinal victory.
