# Con Home Drives Mix Fun, Funds

An insignificant birth, a phe
i nomenal growth, and a healthy
| manhood, identify the annual
: Con Home drive.
In 1923 the Con Home drive
j began. It stole into the public eye
merely as a part of a combined drive
I —some of the money going toward
a fellowship, some to the Con Home
By 1937, the appeal glittered with
activity. It drew in money from a
Masque Ball, an air show, a swim
ming extravaganza, a theater bene
fit, the Junior Water Carnival, Bear.
Day, the Strawberry Brunch, golf
and ping-pong tournaments, the.
; Sophomore Carnival, a debate, a
basketball game, and the direct ap
peal to students, local residents, ano.
Palo Alto merchants.
Record Broken in 1947
In 1925 the drive netted $1,000
But in 19-17 a record-breaking $9,000
poured in to help care for the 80
afflicted children.
Mottoes like "Stanford's Own,"
"Stanford's one opportunity for
service to the Community," shouted
to students that the Con Home was
the only charity maintained by the
University, and that it was unique—
that no other university aided ir.
supporting a similar charity in close
connection with it.
Stanford students have always
played a large role in keeping the
Home going. As early as 1929, Stan
! ford collections brought in 10 pei
cents of the year's total maintenance
King-Queen Contests
For several years Stanford's drive
reached a glorious climax in a
Masque Ball and king-queen con
: test. Balloting was held for kins;
: and queen, all proceeds going to
j the drive. The campus was traits -
j formed into a three-ring circus, as
skywriting, kidnaping, and an ele
j phant all figured in the desperate
| attempt of factions to sweep the
I election.
By 1936 the contest pushed aside
all other contributions to pour $4,000
into the coflers. half of the tutai
amount collected and more than
three times as much money donated
by all fraternities, sororities, and
! men's and women's halls put to
j gether.
In the same year, however, tin-
S money-maker was abolished as
j being undemocratic.
