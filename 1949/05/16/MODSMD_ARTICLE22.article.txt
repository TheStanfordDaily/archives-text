# Survey Expert Analyzes Election

Truman captured the Presidency
in the last election for two main
reasons, said Dr. Angus Campbell,
director of the Survey Research
Center at the University of Michi
gan Friday in Cubberley Audito
rium.
Campbell reported that though
the public was divided evenly a
month before the election;
1. At the last minute more voters
switched from Dewey to Truman
than vice versa.
2. Most of those who were un
decided a month before voted for
Truman.
Campbell based his statements on
two surveys the Research Center
conducted last fall, one before the
election and one following it.
The first, in October, found the
sample voting population split 50-50
between the two parties. This re
sult disagreed with most other pub
lic opinion polls, which heralded a
Dewey majority. In November, after
the election, the center held a sec
ond survey to find out why the 50-
50 split, had shifted to a Truman
majority.
Questioning 94 per cent of the
same people interviewed earlier,
the center singled out the two rea
sons stated above. Also, it discov
ered that while 80 per cent of Dew
ey's supporters had made up their
minds in July. Truman's vote was
not cinched until the last two
weeks. This last-minute scurry to
Truman, from the Dewey ranks and
the undecided, Campbell termed
"substantial and apparently criti
cal."
