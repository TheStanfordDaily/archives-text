## On Trial: U.S. Women 
### 
Several months ago Foreign correspondent Leland Stowe said in an
Esquire magazine article that the American woman "is neither all she
thinks she is nor much that American men assume she is."
"Stowe concedes that the American woman is the world's best-looking
and most modern-thinking woman, possessed of intelligence, indepen
dence, and more wealth than the women of any other land,'' a Isiorth
American Newspaper Alliance writer reported in his story "American
Women vs. European Women."
If women in this country have such favorable attributes, why don't for
eign men come seeking them like the Holy Grail? Why can't American
women hold onto the tens of thousands of American men who married
women living overseas?
Stowe's answer to the questions are not flattering. The Alliance re
pcrter summarized:
"Among other things. Stowe says, American women have been accused
of being the most spoiled, self-centered, aggressive, disinterested in men
and home-making, expensive, restless, rude, conversation-hogging, un
feminine, individuality-lacking, unhappy, and dissatisfied women in the
world.''
Applied to the average American woman we cannot'see the truth in
most of the above accusations. An exception, however—disinterested in
hcme-making—is true for too many American women.
Why? Several reasons appear. Many girls planning to attend secondary
nnd university level schools overlook the importance of learning early
housekeeping from their mothers. Other girls who do learn the basic
home-making fundamentals regard them as monotonous jobs. Young
women planning to embark on a career tend to completely overlook do
mestic training. They fail to realize that once marriage occurs the hus
band must earn a living for the family and the wife must look after the
house, children, and husband.
The Alliance writer interviewed a war bride, a bachelor, and a marriage
counsellor concerning the statements made by Stowe about American
women.
The French war bride, now living in Pennsylvania, said:
"American women have more of the things that make life easy for a
woman*—refrigerators and washing machines and vacuum cleaners. In
stead, they always seem to want more and more. Perhaps that is why
the United States keeps making progress—because its women want change.
But it always meims that American women always seem discontented.
"The American woman's point of view of marriage is entirely different
from the French woman's.
"Take the matter of marriage. I believe we are more serious about it.
From the time we are little girls we are impressed with the idea that our
most important duty is to look after our husband and our children. The
average French, woman is a better cook and housekeeper, a gayer conver
sationalist, and has the ability to make the most of her attractions."
A 30-year-old bachelor who spent four years in Europe said:
"European women are skilled housekeepers. And European women are
grateful for kindnesses. If you bring a French girl a 10-franc rose, she'll
be more enthusiastic about it than an American girl who has just received
a five-pound box of chocolates.
"The European wife always tries to make her husband as happy as
possible—she wants to complement his lile, not to dominate it."
A Philadelphia woman who has been an executive director of a mar
riage council for 12 years, told the Alliance reporter:
"American men shouldn't complain too loudly. They have allowed false
ideas to take hold.
"Influenced by the movies, (he American woman often visualizes the
lole of wife merely as being a beautiful girl in a starchy apron. All too
oiten she doesn't begin to realize how much money, time, and purpose
fulness are required for a happy marriage.
"Conditions in Europe are not too pleasant these days, and an American
man represents escape, security, and comfort. To achieve these goals,
a European girl may flatter and make a god of an American suitor. Of
course, American men like that.
"Many women in America today are confused by the ideals held up
before them. They're exhorted to please men by being eternally young
and beautiful. They're urged to buy more labor-saving devices so that
they will be happy and satisfied. All this distracts them from establish
ing a value lor themselves as useful, creative members of society."
