# BOB SEDERHOLM
## Bull Session 
### 
Over a cup of coffee in the Cellar the other day. I was telling my some
times girl friend, Dum Dum Davenport, about a very fine, very frenetic,
very esoteric Negro trumpet player I had heard during spring vacation.
' Don t call him a Negro, interrupted Dum Dum, "somehow it implies
a difference and hence discrimination."
Through sociology, biology, anthropology, psychology, and various mod
ern novels, Dum Dum has developed her tolerances to an overwhelming
degree.
"All right. All right. As I was saying "
"Hi ya. Bob!"
'"Hi. Phil, how's the boy? Long time no see," I replied in my witty and
original fashion.
"Who was that?" asked Dum Dum.
"A friend of mine. We played frosh tennis together."
"He's a Zeta Zeta, isn't he?"
"Why, yes."
"Hmmn. All Zeta Zetas arc jerks."
"Don't be silly. Dum Dum. Phil isn't a jerk. Besides, you can't classify
a whole house that way."
"All Beta Betas are wolves."
"Come, come, Dum Dum, you don't even know any Betas. What on
earth do they tell you girls during orientation, anyway?"
"All Alpha Alphas . . . ."
"Dum Dum!"
"Don't shout at me you super-introverted Toyon grind-boy!"
Grind-boy. Saturday night 1 was a boor and a brute, a maligner of
Women's Council, and a threat to the Fundamental Standard. Now, I'm
a grind-boy."
"Precisely."
"Dum Dum. Please. You just can't go around classifying people ac
cording to living groups. This is a highly individualistic institution con
taining students in a wide range of sizes, shapes, ages, and liquor capac
ities. You know very well people can only be judged as individuals."
"All Alpha Alphas arc rowdies."
"Very well. All Stanford women .... Dum Dum! Come back, come
back, the check, you forgot the check, hey!"
