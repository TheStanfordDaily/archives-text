### 
The latest developments in the
fields of science and humanities were
presented Saturday at the 17th An
nual Alumni Conference.
Despite the rainy weather, nearly
1,000 people turned out for the day
long program featuring a student
panel, a box luncheon, two class
room sessions, and an informal bar
becue and reception for the Ster
lings.
Here are some of the highlights
of what the audience learned from
16 faculty members:
1. The United States is now in the
midst of a business recession. But
a prolonged depression is not in
prospect—if we support a govern
ment policy that encourages indus
try rather than hampers it. —David
E. Faville, professor of marketing in
the business school.
2. China is the greatest casualty
of the cold war. But in the long
run all the cards are in our favor—
all we need is wisdom and patience.
—Dr. Claude A. Buss, history pro
fessor.
The melting of the Antarctic
icecap may inundate San Francisco,
New York, Los Angeles, and other
coastal cities—lo.ooo years from now.
—Dr. Arthur D. Howard, geologist
who took part in the U.S. Navy ex
pedition to the Antarctic in 1946-47.
4. Tomorrow the measurement of
time standards will probably be
based upon the time it takes a
molecule to turn around. It will be
done with microwaves in any jew
elry shop. —Dr. Edward L. Ginzton,
professor of physics who is playing
a key role in the development of the
electron linear accelerator here at
Stanford.
5. Meteors so tiny they are only
specks of cosmic dust may be the
clue to unraveling mysteries of the
ionosphere. Dr. Oswald Garrison
Villard, Jr., a young electrical en

These lectures were heard by the
alumni in two classroom sessions in
