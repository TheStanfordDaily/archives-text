# Indonesian Problem

To the Editor:
I should like to confess that I was not surprised when I read the brief
article written by Mr. Van Gindertael about the Indonesian problem. Im
perialism—that is, establishing the happiness of some societies on the un
happiness of some others—is not a new idea.
History is the witness of the destruction of many things like freedom
and independence which are so important for all of us. In my own country,
the last 250 years of which was spent in defending her freedom and inde
pendence, I learnt that these things were as precious as principles of
humanitarianism.
1 do not know what is taught in Holland. What 1 do know is that these
things are treasured by the Americans too. and they feel proud of re
peating many sayings of Jefferson and Lincoln concerning equality, free
dom and independence.
I do not want to go into a detailed discussion here. Voltaire said:
"I grew old discussing things, only at the end of my life did I sec that
the reasons behind discussions were misunderstandings as to the meaning
of words."
Perhaps by promising a democratic society under a Dutch occupation
for the Indonesia of the future Mr. Van Gindertael means one kind of
happiness for the countries who are under occupation. But I will not
wish this kind of happiness to any human society whether it is Dutch,
Belgian. French, Italian, or English; in other words, to any of these im
perialist countries.
