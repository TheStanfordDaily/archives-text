# Communist Trials
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I have received a letter signed by five members of the faculty (one a
professor emeritus) asking me to sign it also, in protesting against the
Communist trials in Washington.
On telephoning Professor Weymouth, to whom the return envelope is
addressed, he tells me that the letter was written by students that he
merely allowed his name to be used. etc.
The pattern is familiar these days, so I am writing to know:
1. What other faculty members received this letter;
2. Who the students are that started it;
Who is paying the postage bill to send it to "all the members of the
Stanford faculty."
We should all be willing 1o stand up and be counted on this matter, so
may I suggest that if local Communists want to protest (and that is their
privilege) they should come right out and say, "We Commies protest the
way our buddies are being treated."
I am also wondering whether the same hand is at work that slipped
a four-page Communist supplement into copies of The Daily, at least in
some of those piled up at the Engineering Corner!
