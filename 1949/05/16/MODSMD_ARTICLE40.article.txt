"I'm a genius."
Lynn Belvedere makes this claim
again in "Mr. Belvedere Goes to
College," now playing at the Stan
ford; but even Clifton Webb's dead
pan expression didn't bring more
than a mild titter from the audience.
In fact, nothing in "Mr. Belve
dere Goes to College" is as funny
as "Sitting Pretty"; still when

Webb hogs the
screen it's plenty
amusing. When
he pole - vaults
the frosh to a
fro s h - soph
championship, or
when he plays

boogie at a soro
rity house, the picture reaches a
humorous level that "Sitting Pret
ty" maintained for an hour.
When Welib leaves the screen to
the destructive talents of Shirley
Temple and dimply Tom Drake the
film sinks to the bottom of a syrupy
sea. They share an unpalatable col
lege reporter-college editor romance
which is not made more credible by
a possessive mother and an infant
son.
Whenever Hollywood finds a good

thine; it hangs on like a hungry
bul'dog. "Lassie Come Home" wat
ail expert flick; now Lassie (a psy
chopathic war hero in his last pic
ture) smiles toothily from all the
billboards. "Sitting Pretty" wa:-
original and delightful ."Mr. Belve
dere Goes to College" is amusing and
a good afternoon's entertainment.
"Mr. Belvedere in (he Lower An
tipodes"-let's hope Hollywood let
go before an original idea comes to
a sad, untimely end.
