# ATO and Village To Replay Inning
## 
### 
Is it ATO or Village 314 versus
Theta Chi in the finals of Chuck
Taylor's mural Softball play?
That question will be determined
today when the ATO's and the Vil
lagers hook up in a protest replay
of the last inning of their recent
game in which the fraternity men
stole the nod, 2 to 1.
All the commotion started when
first-baseman Brown of the Villag
ers over-ran second base and was
tagged out to end the ball game.
That was fine with everybody, ex
cept that the Villagers dug out the
rule book, discovered that Brown
could legally zip by the sliding base,
and then filed their protest, which
was eventually held valid.
In the event the game is tied up
and goes extra innings, the Theta
Chi contest will be played tomor
row. But all the odds point to a
final seven-inning thriller on tap
this afternoon between the battling
Bradshaws and the patient Theta
Chi's.
