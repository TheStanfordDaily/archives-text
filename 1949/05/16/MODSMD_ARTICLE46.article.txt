Although USC edged the Stanford tracksters by a single point
in the total score of the Fresno Relays last Saturday, the Indian
mile relay team, composed of Cass Bly, Pitch Johnson, Larry
Hoff, and Gay Bryan, established itself as the best in the nation
when it won the feature relay race of the evening in 3:14.9.

The addition of Captain Gay
Bryan as anchor man gave an added
spark to the Stanford mile relay
team which gained sweet revenge
on the Trojans. USC had previously
