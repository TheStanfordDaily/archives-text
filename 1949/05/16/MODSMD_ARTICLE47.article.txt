# Indian Crewmen Wallop USC Eight
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity crewmen defi
nitely stamped themselves as Pough
keepsie hopefuls Saturday after
noon, when they stroked their way
to a three and one-half length vic
tory over the Un*/ersity of South
ern California over the Long Beach
Marine Stadium course.
This win, coupled with Califor
nia's thrilling eight-foot win over
the defending Poughkeepsie cham
pions from Washington, showed that
the Indians would definitely put up
a good battle at Poughkeepsie. Last
week the Bears edged Stanford in a
very good race.
The Stanford shell was clocked in
6 minutes 55 seconds for the 2,000-
meter course. The race was close
for the first 500 meters, but the In
dians drew clear to a two-length
lead by the halfway mark and in
creased it steadily.
The Stanford junior varsity came
through with a tremendous seven
length victory in its race, and was
timed in 7:05, which was better than
the USC varsity. The freshman
crew did not make the trip.
