### PHIL STEINMETZ

on top in their battle with the
weather and the California golf

the Indians off to a roaring start as
they piled up an 8-1 lead. Bob
Crozier and Jack Wallace added 4%
more points, which made the score

some came in.
£ully Ingram and Ralph Mills
added the last 4V| points when Mills
won all three singles points from
Frank Minch. Mills was low medal
player with a 74,
California's Bob Hanna had an
extremely hot putter for this match.
He one-putted each of the first six
holes, and added three more one
putt greens along the way. Mills
had one of the best shots of the
match when he dropped his 125-
yard approach one foot short of the
18th cup, and Jack Wallace had the
most sensational putt a 35-footer
on the 15th green. Results:
