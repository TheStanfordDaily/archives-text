# Stanford Ball Chili Drops Pair to Troy
## 
### 
I'he power-laden USC Trojans got
very effective pitching from south
paw Don Pender and right-hander
Jack Schlarb over the weekend and
turned their performances into 4-2
and 4-1 victories over the Stanford
nine.
Dave Dahle in the Friday game,
and Jim Claypool and Frank La-
Brum on Saturday, turned in cred
itable pitching efforts for Stanford,
but the Indians managed to get only
11 hits in the two games.
