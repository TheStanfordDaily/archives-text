# Students Uncover Discrepancies In Trojan Presidential Election
## 
### 
Four thousand University of
: Southern California students have
signed petitions challenging the va
lidity of last week's presidential
election at USC. Only 1.800 signa
j tures are needed on a petition to
i put a question up to student body
vote.
The school's stormy election of
fraternity man Ed Vierheilig was
climaxed Wednesday afternoon by
j Senator -at - Large Omar Kureishi
I when he issued charges of fraud in
1 the ASSC elections after evidence
j of election irregularities was un
j covered.
Punched election registration
; cards were taken from the univer
sity vault by Election Commissioner
■ Bill McGurty. cut in half by a ma-
I chine cutter, and thrown in a trash
I bin behind the Student Union. They
! we.e found in the bin by a Daily
Troian reporter. Earlier. McGurty
| had promised not to destroy the
cards.
The cards were the only check to
earlier fraud charges made by USC
student leaders. It was the count
ing of these cards that first showed
up the discrepancy between the
number of ballots cast and the
number of cards that had been
i punched.
| Independent students wanted the
cards to check - claims that some
were pi inched fraudulently to ac
count for "sHifTod" ballots counted
l in ' •-t week s election.

editorial, said Thursday:
"For our part, there is no doubt.
We maintain that fraud was never
so apparent — never so blatantly
foisted on an unsuspecting elector
ate—never so casually passed otf by
a group of persons who call them
selves "representatives' of the stu
dent body."
The editorial listed the names of
the school's 21 student senators who
voted to approve "a fraudulent
e'ection." Losing presidential can
didate Bub Padgett and Kureishi
were defended for their integrity
and for not opposing an investiga
tion of election fraud charges.
Students, meanwhile, sent their
opinions to the Trojan's "Letters to
the Editor" column. One writer said
he would urge the removal of ail
social fraternities and sororities, the
cancellation of student rights and
politics, and the discredit of the
present members of the ASSC Sen
ate as a group and as individuals.
Another writer labeled the Daily
Trojan, as a "rabble-rouser."
And a third letter—from a frater
nity man—stated that USC frater
nity men are "sowing the reeds of
their own destruction" by "advanc
ing under a completely faLu? as
sumption: that in order *. i survive,
they must control eve.y phase of
student activity and government."
