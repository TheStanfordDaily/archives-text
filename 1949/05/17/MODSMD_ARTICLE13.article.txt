# Students Find Loud Speaker Electioneering Effective
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
For the past week, music has
tickled the eardrums of Cellar cus
tomers, Nitery-goers, and passers
by wending their way from Engi
neering corner to the Post Office.
Farm students have been thus
bombarded because an ASSU elec
tion candidate and a forthcoming
dance have used a public address
system to sell their wares. Between
numbers listeners were advised to
vote or buy.
When the milling crowd at Stan
ford Union were asked, "Do you
think this musical advertisement is
more effective than other forms,
such as signs?" 41 out of 45 an
swered with a resounding "yes!"
'"It has a good psychological ef
fect," said one lawn-lounger, "I sel
dom read signs," said another. Com
ments like "It gets your attention
better," or "You certainly can't es
cape it," were far in the majority.
Most of the crowd found the
audio campaigns pleasant as well as
effective. "I digest my food better
to music," munched one girl. Many
said, ' Let's have it every day,"and
"It cheers things up."
However, not all the 41 who la
beled it good advertising were cap
tured by the music's charms. These
dissenters, in the minority, com
plained, "It's too loud." "It's annoy
ing—gets on my nerves." "I get

tired of the guy talking all the i
time."
Said one girl, "I work at Cubber- j
ley Libe. I hear it all the time, i
It's irritating."
But many of the critical admitted
they would approve the idea in a j
diluted form. They suggested the
loudspeaker be used only during
the lunch hour and that the volume
be turned down.
Many others voted for music with
their lunch all the time, accompa- j
nied by advertisement or not.
Records and the P A. system have
been supplied by Encina resident
George Bahrs. Monday and Tues
day he rented the system to Hank
Rosin's presidential campaign. For j
the rest of the week, George and !
his assistants sat at the microphone '
plugging the Branner Formal.
"I'm willing to supply the sys
tem any time someone wants to ad- j
vertise." he said.
