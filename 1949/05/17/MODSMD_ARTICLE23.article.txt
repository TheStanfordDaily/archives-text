### Better Razor Blade 
PALO ALTO, May 17—
Plenty of men swear at their
razor blades, but here's a man
who swears by his!
When reporters called on Joe Mul
doon, they found him whistling
in the bathroom. "Boys," he said,
"just tell my public I'm razor
blade happy. After years of trial
and error, mostly error, I finally
found my blade — just a 'feather
touch' and'so long whiskers! Why,
shaving with Phl Hollow Ground
is as easy as flicking the top off
lemon meringue pie."
Mr. M forgot to say that Pal
Hollow Ground still gives you 4
for lOC (or 10 for 25<\ 21 for 49(>,
44 for 080. He uses Double Edg«.
Single Edge cost the same. —•
