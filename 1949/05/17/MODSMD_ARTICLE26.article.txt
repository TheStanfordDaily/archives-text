### 
Three hundred and twenty-five
volumes on ships and ship model
ing have been added to the Hop
kins Transportation Library, Dr.
Raynard C. Swank, director of Uni
versity libraries, announced last
week.
The unusual gift was presented
by Parker Elliott, who for many
years conducted a hobby depart
ment at the Emporium in San Fran
cisco.
Dr. Swank appraised the collec
tion, which ranges from model ship
blueprints to pirate tales, as a valu
able addition to the Hopkins Li
rary, which already rates as one of
the West's outstanding centers of
information on all phases of trans
portation.
