## Turn Out and Collect 
### 
Last night an off-campus solicitation dinner was held down the
highway for students. The purpose of the annual meeting is to
organize students to collect Convalescent Home donations from
lhe Palo Alto area.
Cardinals' Con Home Committee had expected at least 100
men and women to volunteer for the drive. But only 11 couples
appeared at the dinner. At least 50 couples are needed to can
vass the area.
Since the heart of the drive depends on student solicitors, the
committee will orient collectors tonight at 7 in the Cardinals'
office on the third floor of the Old Union.
Stanford students support five beds (at 51,500 each) at the
Home each year. Let's support this Farm project by pitching in
and helping the committee collect local donations.
