# Hashing Policy
## 
### 
A letter to The Daily today concerns an important factor of
student livelihood—hashing. The seven writers question the
consistency of the University's policy in hiring student dining
help.
The same question has come to our attention orally many
limes so far this year. Concrete examples have been presented
to us of instances where students not in great need were given
hashing positions over more needy men and women. While
such a policy deviation was not intentional in most cases, it has
occurred often enough to warrant public review.
Tomorrow we will present in this column a plan for centraliza
tion of hashing employment. In return we hope that you—hash
ers especially—will respond with suggestions or criticism of the
plan.
