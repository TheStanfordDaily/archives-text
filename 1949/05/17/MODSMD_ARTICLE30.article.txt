THIS IS FOR POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENTS:
Two German fishermen, were trying their luck on opposite banks of
the River Spree. (The river has a right bank and a left bank .... very
significant; remember these facts, for there will be a short five-minute
quiz at the end of breakfast.) The angler on the American-zone bank
(the right hank) was pulling in fish after fish, but the man on the Russian
zone bank (the left bank) was not getting a nibble. The latter finally
yelled in irritation, "Gott! How do you manage to catch so many while
I get none?"
"Very simple," replied the fisherman on the American bank. "Over
here the fish aren't afraid to open their mouths."

THIS IS FOR SOCIOLOGY MAJORS:
The conscientious father was dispensing advice to his son, who was
.about to be married.
"Co-operation is the* foundation of successful marriage," said the old
man. "You must do things together. If your wife wants to go for a
walk, go for a walk with her. If she wants to go to the movies, go to the
movies with her. If she wants to do the dishes, do the dishes with her."
"And," demanded the son, "what if she wants to mop the floor?"
