Hashing for Fun
To the Editor:
We heartily approve of the University's policy of permitting students to
earn a portion of their expenses while attending Stanford by jobs such
as hashing.
However, it has come to our attention recently that a newly-hired hasher
at one of the larger women's residences has taken the position merely for
the fun of it.
While we feel it very commendable that she should find pleasure in
such a practical manner, we wonder, as we see her driving around cam
pus in her 1948 convertible, we wonder just how it fits in with the Uni
versity's overall plan, particularly since we know of several other cases in
which individuals who will be unable to return to school unless they
can earn part of their expenses have been refused similar positions on
the grounds of insufficient need.
Without knowing all of the ramifications we are not condemning, but
we are questioning the consistency of such actions.
