700 CHINESE PROVERBS trans

Although the proverbs form an
: important part of Chinese thought,
| and reflect the philosophy of a race
i of people long accustomed to hard
ship, few of these proverbs have \
; ever been written down in Chinese.
Thus, with the exception of the say- I
| ings of Confucius, not included in i
| this volume, many of the proverbs
j arising in generally illiterate com- I
munities are now published in this
book for the first time.
As Henry Hart has written, these
proverbs not only reflect the phi
losophy of these people, but also
their interests. In this respect it is I
interesting to note that there are !
many proverbs on the subject of j
personal eflort; yet there are very '
; few on the subject of co-operation, j
These differences give the reader !
i some small insight into Oriental
thought. Actually, many of these
sayings convey more meaning and i
reveal more about human nature j
; than a carload of psychological nov
els.
Also they represent the epitome of
1 epigramatic statement. A few words
! suggest very much. As to their ;
practical value to the reader, they
could serve well as the opening of
an after-dinner speech, a use to
which I am sure the editor of The
| Daily will surely put them.
Among the most pithy sayings are:
"If you don't stop at one, then
I don't stop at two."
"To one who waits, a moment
seems a year."
"The conquerors are kings; the
• defeated are bandits."
"He who rides the tiger finds it
difficult to dismount."
"A man without a smiling face
should not open shop."
"If you do not ask their help, all
men are good natured."
"Spring is as changeable as a j
stepmother's face." 1
