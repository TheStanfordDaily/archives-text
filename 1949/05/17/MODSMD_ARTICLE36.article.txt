## Dutch Conquer Indonesian Islands in 1906 After 200-Year Struggle with Native Princes 
### 
The Dutch East India Company
went to Indonesia in the early 17th
century. The Indonesian Islands at
that time were divided among vari
ous princes. "The Dutch shrewdly
and patiently played one rival prince
against another, fomented disrup
tion, put \ip pretenders to thrones,
and shifted sides to suit their con
venience." (Goshal, K., People in
Colonies.)
"At no time during their colonial
expansion in the Indies did the
Dutch face anything approximating
a united front of native states allied
against them." (Kennedy, R., The
Ageless Indies.)
Even so the Dutch were not able
to conquer the whole archipelago
until the beginning of the 20th cen
tury. In 1825, for instance, there
was a revolt in Djokjakarta which
lasted five years. Atjehnese on the
northern tip of Sumatra fought a
long and bloody battle against the
Dutch from 1873 to 1908. In Bali
the Dutch had to send expedition
after expedition from 1846 to 190(5
before the Balinese princes capitu
lated. All in all there were 33 re
volts during the 19th century.
Thus the little kingdom of the
Netherlands, with nine million peo
ple living in an area of less than
13.000 square miles, became the
ruler of Indonesia with seventy mil
lion people living in an area of more
than 700.000 square miles.
Why was Indonesia such a coveted
colony? "From 1000 to 1800 the
Dutch East India Company paid re
corded dividends at the rate of 18
per cent a year and reaped a golden
harvest of hundreds of millions of
guilders besides in unreported plun
der." (Isaacs. 11.. No Peace for Asia.)
The company was instrumental in
the destruction of native Javanese

and Suinatran commerce, shipping,
and shipbuilding, and forced agri
cultural occupations on the popula
tion.
In the early 19th century the
Dutch government introduced into
Indonesia the well-known "culture"
system, compelling the Javanese to
set aside a portion of their land and
cultivate it as directed by the Dutch
government. The principal crops:
coffee, sugar, and indigo, were grown
for export, and this resulted in wide
spread famines which reduced the
population in some areas of Java by
one-half.
Between 1831 and .1877 the East
Indian administrative profits totalled
1.000.000.000 guilders.
By the end of the 19th century the
culture system gave way to the free
economy system which established
monopolies, including spirits, gam
bling, opium, and tobacco. In order
to pay a poll tax levied at this time,
the poor Indonesians were forced to
work as underpaid laborers on
Dutch-owned plantations.
The 20th century saw the begin
ning of foreign investments in Indo
nesia which by 1941 amounted to
$2,000,000,000 and of which three
fourths were Dutch. Of the agricul
tural exports 69.3 per cent were pro
duced on exclusively Dutch-owned
farms. In 1938. Dutch plantations
supplied 99.4 per cent of the ex
ported sugar and 81.9 per cent of the
exported tea. Before the Japanese
invasion the Netherlands made
about $1 r>0.000.000 per annum from
Indonesia. This is no small return
for a few Dutch corporations.
Hence the statement of the Dutch
historian. A. Cabaton, that, "In the
possession of her splendid Indian
Empire, she (Holland) feels on a

level with move powerful states . ,
. . The Low Countries .... would
shed the blood of their last soldier
rather than abandon the Indies."
Alter nearly 300 years of colonial
rule the living conditions of the
Indonesian people were not flatter
ing to the Dutch. The average in
come of an Indonesian was $15 per
year before the war. His normal
diet consisted of a bowl of rice fla
vored with a spoonful of fish twice
a day. At the same time the plan
tation managers received large sal
aries and "lived lree of rent in
charming houses set in spacious
grounds." In this respect, the na
lion distribution of income in Indo
nesia is worth examining.
In 1936 the Europeans in the In
dies comprising 0.5 per cent of the
population received <55 per cent of
the total income, while 97 5 per
cent of the Indonesians got 20 per
cent. (Readers may look up these
facts in J. S. Furnivall, Netherlands
India.) From these facts one can
conclude that despite individual ex
ceptions. philanthropy was hardly
the motive for the Dutch stay in
Indonesia.
Although Indonesia is rich in na
tural industrial resources, the peo
ple are overwhelmingly agricultural.
Industry is practically non-existent.
In 19.39 the factories employed only
300.000 workers. Regarding educa
tion, 93 per cent of the adult popu
lation was illiterate before the last
war.
A Dutch commission in 1928 ad
mitted "that at the rate they were
going, it would take 1(57 years to
net all the eligible children of the
country into primary schools."

a day. At the same time the plan
tation managers received large sal
aries and "lived lree of rent in
charming houses set in spacious
grounds." In this respect, the na
lion distribution of income in Indo
nesia is worth examining.
In 1936 the Europeans in the In
dies comprising 0.5 per cent of the
population received <55 per cent of
the total income, while 97 5 per
cent of the Indonesians got 20 per
cent. (Readers may look up these
facts in J. S. Furnivall, Netherlands
India.) From these facts one can
conclude that despite individual ex
ceptions. philanthropy was hardly
the motive for the Dutch stay in
Indonesia.
Although Indonesia is rich in na
tural industrial resources, the peo
ple are overwhelmingly agricultural.
Industry is practically non-existent.
In 19.39 the factories employed only
300.000 workers. Regarding educa
tion, 93 per cent of the adult popu
lation was illiterate before the last
war.
A Dutch commission in 1928 ad
mitted "that at the rate they were
going, it would take 1(57 years to
net all the eligible children of the
country into primary schools."

The Dutch East India Company
went to Indonesia in the early 17th
century. The Indonesian Islands at
that time were divided among vari
ous princes. "The Dutch shrewdly
and patiently played one rival prince
against another, fomented disrup
tion, put \ip pretenders to thrones,
and shifted sides to suit their con
venience." (Goshal, K., People in
Colonies.)
"At no time during their colonial
expansion in the Indies did the
Dutch face anything approximating
a united front of native states allied
against them." (Kennedy, R., The
Ageless Indies.)
Even so the Dutch were not able
to conquer the whole archipelago
until the beginning of the 20th cen
tury. In 1825, for instance, there
was a revolt in Djokjakarta which
lasted five years. Atjehnese on the
northern tip of Sumatra fought a
long and bloody battle against the
Dutch from 1873 to 1908. In Bali
the Dutch had to send expedition
after expedition from 1846 to 190(5
before the Balinese princes capitu
lated. All in all there were 33 re
volts during the 19th century.
Thus the little kingdom of the
Netherlands, with nine million peo
ple living in an area of less than
13.000 square miles, became the
ruler of Indonesia with seventy mil
lion people living in an area of more
than 700.000 square miles.
Why was Indonesia such a coveted
colony? "From 1000 to 1800 the
Dutch East India Company paid re
corded dividends at the rate of 18
per cent a year and reaped a golden
harvest of hundreds of millions of
guilders besides in unreported plun
der." (Isaacs. 11.. No Peace for Asia.)
The company was instrumental in
the destruction of native Javanese

and Suinatran commerce, shipping,
and shipbuilding, and forced agri
cultural occupations on the popula
tion.
In the early 19th century the
Dutch government introduced into
Indonesia the well-known "culture"
system, compelling the Javanese to
set aside a portion of their land and
cultivate it as directed by the Dutch
government. The principal crops:
coffee, sugar, and indigo, were grown
for export, and this resulted in wide
spread famines which reduced the
population in some areas of Java by
one-half.
Between 1831 and .1877 the East
Indian administrative profits totalled
1.000.000.000 guilders.
By the end of the 19th century the
culture system gave way to the free
economy system which established
monopolies, including spirits, gam
bling, opium, and tobacco. In order
to pay a poll tax levied at this time,
the poor Indonesians were forced to
work as underpaid laborers on
Dutch-owned plantations.
The 20th century saw the begin
ning of foreign investments in Indo
nesia which by 1941 amounted to
$2,000,000,000 and of which three
fourths were Dutch. Of the agricul
tural exports 69.3 per cent were pro
duced on exclusively Dutch-owned
farms. In 1938. Dutch plantations
supplied 99.4 per cent of the ex
ported sugar and 81.9 per cent of the
exported tea. Before the Japanese
invasion the Netherlands made
about $1 r>0.000.000 per annum from
Indonesia. This is no small return
for a few Dutch corporations.
Hence the statement of the Dutch
historian. A. Cabaton, that, "In the
possession of her splendid Indian
Empire, she (Holland) feels on a

level with move powerful states . ,
. . The Low Countries .... would
shed the blood of their last soldier
rather than abandon the Indies."
Alter nearly 300 years of colonial
rule the living conditions of the
Indonesian people were not flatter
ing to the Dutch. The average in
come of an Indonesian was $15 per
year before the war. His normal
diet consisted of a bowl of rice fla
vored with a spoonful of fish twice
a day. At the same time the plan

The 20th century saw the begin
ning of foreign investments in Indo
nesia which by 1941 amounted to
$2,000,000,000 and of which three
fourths were Dutch. Of the agricul
tural exports 69.3 per cent were pro
duced on exclusively Dutch-owned
farms. In 1938. Dutch plantations
supplied 99.4 per cent of the ex
ported sugar and 81.9 per cent of the
exported tea. Before the Japanese
invasion the Netherlands made
about $1 r>0.000.000 per annum from
Indonesia. This is no small return
for a few Dutch corporations.
Hence the statement of the Dutch
historian. A. Cabaton, that, "In the
possession of her splendid Indian
Empire, she (Holland) feels on a

level with move powerful states . ,
. . The Low Countries .... would
shed the blood of their last soldier
rather than abandon the Indies."
Alter nearly 300 years of colonial
rule the living conditions of the
Indonesian people were not flatter
ing to the Dutch. The average in
come of an Indonesian was $15 per
year before the war. His normal
diet consisted of a bowl of rice fla
vored with a spoonful of fish twice
a day. At the same time the plan
tation managers received large sal
aries and "lived lree of rent in
charming houses set in spacious
grounds." In this respect, the na
lion distribution of income in Indo
nesia is worth examining.
In 1936 the Europeans in the In
dies comprising 0.5 per cent of the
population received <55 per cent of
the total income, while 97 5 per
cent of the Indonesians got 20 per
cent. (Readers may look up these
facts in J. S. Furnivall, Netherlands
India.) From these facts one can
conclude that despite individual ex
ceptions. philanthropy was hardly
the motive for the Dutch stay in
Indonesia.
Although Indonesia is rich in na
tural industrial resources, the peo
ple are overwhelmingly agricultural.
Industry is practically non-existent.
In 19.39 the factories employed only
300.000 workers. Regarding educa
tion, 93 per cent of the adult popu
lation was illiterate before the last
war.
A Dutch commission in 1928 ad
mitted "that at the rate they were
going, it would take 1(57 years to
net all the eligible children of the
country into primary schools."
(Isaacs, op cit.)

The Dutch East India Company
went to Indonesia in the early 17th
century. The Indonesian Islands at
that time were divided among vari
ous princes. "The Dutch shrewdly
and patiently played one rival prince
against another, fomented disrup
tion, put \ip pretenders to thrones,
and shifted sides to suit their con
venience." (Goshal, K., People in
Colonies.)
"At no time during their colonial
expansion in the Indies did the
Dutch face anything approximating
a united front of native states allied
against them." (Kennedy, R., The
Ageless Indies.)
Even so the Dutch were not able
to conquer the whole archipelago
until the beginning of the 20th cen
tury. In 1825, for instance, there
was a revolt in Djokjakarta which
lasted five years. Atjehnese on the
northern tip of Sumatra fought a
long and bloody battle against the
Dutch from 1873 to 1908. In Bali
the Dutch had to send expedition
after expedition from 1846 to 190(5
before the Balinese princes capitu
lated. All in all there were 33 re
volts during the 19th century.
Thus the little kingdom of the
Netherlands, with nine million peo
ple living in an area of less than
13.000 square miles, became the
ruler of Indonesia with seventy mil
lion people living in an area of more
than 700.000 square miles.
Why was Indonesia such a coveted
colony? "From 1000 to 1800 the
Dutch East India Company paid re
corded dividends at the rate of 18
per cent a year and reaped a golden
harvest of hundreds of millions of
guilders besides in unreported plun
der." (Isaacs. 11.. No Peace for Asia.)
The company was instrumental in
the destruction of native Javanese

and Suinatran commerce, shipping,
and shipbuilding, and forced agri
cultural occupations on the popula
tion.
In the early 19th century the
Dutch government introduced into
Indonesia the well-known "culture"
system, compelling the Javanese to
set aside a portion of their land and
cultivate it as directed by the Dutch
government. The principal crops:
coffee, sugar, and indigo, were grown
for export, and this resulted in wide
spread famines which reduced the
population in some areas of Java by
one-half.
Between 1831 and .1877 the East
Indian administrative profits totalled
1.000.000.000 guilders.
By the end of the 19th century the
culture system gave way to the free
economy system which established
monopolies, including spirits, gam
bling, opium, and tobacco. In order
to pay a poll tax levied at this time,
the poor Indonesians were forced to
work as underpaid laborers on
Dutch-owned plantations.
