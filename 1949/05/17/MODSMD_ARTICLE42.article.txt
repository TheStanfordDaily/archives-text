# Village Smoke Signals

Harvey has gone out into the cold
world to tend for himself. Most
people might think Harvey is nuts.
He was living on the second floor
of the girls' dorm at the Village . . .
but then. Harvey was a rabbit. It
seemed Harvey developed an over
fondness for thesis notes belonging :
to Jean Tremblay. This was a mis- ,
take; he has been disowned. That i
is why Harvey is now on his own. ,

Nine Village groups were on the
social calendar for beach parties
last Saturday. The weather scared j
several of them out. but Dorms 117, i
314. 123 (women's dorm), and sev
eral others braved the elements and !
had very successful affairs. Largest
was the 314 one with 45 people
present. Resident Assistant Paul i
Ganatal was the steak chef. He j
wasn't bad, but the garlic he had i
found afield somewhere didn't go !
over so well with the couples pres- j
ent.

The women's dorm is also plan
ning its annual party at the Adobe
Creek Lodge this weekend. Steak
suppers will highlight the day . . .
the women picking up the checks. |
Now there is an idea that should I
become more popular.
