BERKELEY, May 16 MP) — The
captain of California's boxing team
was knocked out today by an All-
Ameriean football guard—with a
12-pound shot.
Rod Franz, the All-America guard
of last year's Bear gridiron squad,
was heaving the shot between
classes at Edwards Field. It struck
Rod Lamke in the head. The un
conscious boxer was taken to
Cowell Hospital to be treated for
concussion and scalp cuts.
