# Stanford to Send Nine to LA Meet
## 
### 
Coach Jack Weiershauser's varsity
tricksters, who lost by a single point
in the Fresno Relays last weekend,
will send a nine-man team to com
pete in the equally famous Coliseum
Relays in Los Angeles Friday night.
Boasting the best mile relay team
in the nation, the Stanford team,
composed of Cass Bly, Pitch John
son, Larry Hoff, and Gay Bryan, will
again try to lower their time of
3:14.9 on the Coliseum track.
Chief opposition will again come
from the USC team. The Indian-
Trojan mile relay rivalry is now one
victory apiece, and Troy will be all
out to forge ahead in the series.
The two teams will again meet the
following day at the California Re
lays in Modesto.
The other five men making the
trip to the Coliseum Relays are Otis
Chandler and Lew Davis in the shot
put. Downing McKee in the high
hurdles, Steve McKee in the dis
cus, and Rupe Andrews as an al
ternate in the mile relay.
Captain Gay Bryan will also com
pete in the broad and high jumps,
and Chandler will double up in the
discus.
