### 
Still nursing theix* wounds from
a disastrous trip to USC, the Stan
ford baseball team invades St. j
Mary's this afternoon to open the
final week of CIBA play. A win over
the lowly Moragans would assure
the Indians of at least a tie for
fourth place in the final league
standings.
Either Dave Stott (1-2) or Jack
Heinen (0-2) will toe the rubber for
Harry Wolter's crew. The Indians
will face the offerings of either Jack
Rial (2-2) or Carroll Canfield (1-5).
In their first outing against St. |
Mary's, Stanford pounded out an
8 to 0 win over Jack Rial. In that
first game St. Mary's was able to
pick up one base hit off Dave Dahle.
Either shortstop Dave Melton or j
first baseman Dick Clegg can cop j
the CIBA batting crown by coming

through with enough base blows
against the Gaels. Melton is tied up
in third place with Bill Renna of
Santa Clara with a .396 batting av
erage, only four points behind
leaders Bob O'Dell of Cal and Skip
Rowland of UCLA.

| the team batting title by pounding
the Gael pitchers. Stanford holds
; down the second spot in team stand
ings, with a .286 average, just six
