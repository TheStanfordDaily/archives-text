The Stanford baseball just finished
doing what every other Farm ath
letic squad has done this year.
It lost to USC's terrible Trojans,
to whom it is supposed to be all
right to lose because they don't
have high grade standards and are
known to take care of their boys.
It is also okay to lose to USC be
cause most ot the Trojan athletes
are developed before they get to
college and therefore don't accom
plish much when they beat a bunch
of boys who never had any talent
except that which they developed
between exams and lab experi
ments.
Or so goes the long list of ex
cuses which more than a few In
dian boosters have been muttering
during the Trojan dry year of 1949.
Why Does USC Win?
But for a change, let's try to look
at the situation from a San Luis
Obispo point of view, otherwise
known as an unbiased evaluation.
Trojan wins are not actually bought
on a cash and carry basis.
Partly, it's the Trojan farm sys
tem. Partly, it is their method of
making things easier for the well
coordinated boys who decide to
grace ther gymnasia.
But mostly, it's the members of
USC's coaching staff, an intelligent
and hard-working bunch who like
to win. who are responsible for the
frequent Trojan successes.
Take a concrete example of a case
in which Trojan coaching lias helped
produce a winner.
I'm referring to Donald Pender,
ace hurler on Troy's baseball team
which has now won 19 straight
baseball games, with Lefty Pender
being responsible for eight of them.
Pender Was a (iook
When Pender started to choose
his college, he wasn't noticed even
by San Jose State, a school which
has feelers out for every second
rate athlete in the business.
The reason behind the brush was
simple enough. In high school at
Manual Arts, a stones-throw from
Bovard Field, Fender was a bum. a
real gook who barely earned him
self a suit.
His main duty was to toss-up
batting practice pitches, and he had
a hard time doing that. But like
| all guys with the baseball-bug, he
was determined to make good, and
for no reason at all except that he
liked the place, he enrolled at that
villain-villa, USC.
Now here's where the punch-line
comes in. When the bum went out
for ball, there were enough coaches
around so that even a scatter-arm
like Pender was given some time.
Pretty soon the lug begins to get
better. He gets a little more time.
Then he gets to throw a couple
games.
Now. he's the best pitcher in the
CIBA, has a season record of 6-1,
and boasts the best earned-run av
erage at only 2 per game.
Even Stanford, where we have
bragged that we have made athletes
out of boobs, would have a hard
time matching that one.

batting practice pitches, and he had
a hard time doing that. But like
| all guys with the baseball-bug, he
was determined to make good, and
for no reason at all except that he
liked the place, he enrolled at that
villain-villa, USC.
Now here's where the punch-line
comes in. When the bum went out
for ball, there were enough coaches
around so that even a scatter-arm
like Pender was given some time.
Pretty soon the lug begins to get
better. He gets a little more time.
Then he gets to throw a couple
games.
Now. he's the best pitcher in the
CIBA, has a season record of 6-1,
and boasts the best earned-run av
erage at only 2 per game.
Even Stanford, where we have
bragged that we have made athletes
out of boobs, would have a hard
time matching that one.
The Stanford baseball just finished
doing what every other Farm ath
letic squad has done this year.
It lost to USC's terrible Trojans,
to whom it is supposed to be all
right to lose because they don't
have high grade standards and are
known to take care of their boys.
It is also okay to lose to USC be
cause most ot the Trojan athletes
are developed before they get to
college and therefore don't accom
plish much when they beat a bunch
of boys who never had any talent
except that which they developed
between exams and lab experi
ments.
Or so goes the long list of ex
cuses which more than a few In
dian boosters have been muttering
during the Trojan dry year of 1949.
Why Does USC Win?
But for a change, let's try to look
at the situation from a San Luis
Obispo point of view, otherwise
known as an unbiased evaluation.
Trojan wins are not actually bought
on a cash and carry basis.
Partly, it's the Trojan farm sys
tem. Partly, it is their method of
making things easier for the well
coordinated boys who decide to
grace ther gymnasia.
But mostly, it's the members of
USC's coaching staff, an intelligent
and hard-working bunch who like
to win. who are responsible for the
frequent Trojan successes.
Take a concrete example of a case
in which Trojan coaching lias helped
produce a winner.
I'm referring to Donald Pender,
ace hurler on Troy's baseball team
which has now won 19 straight
baseball games, with Lefty Pender
being responsible for eight of them.
Pender Was a (iook
When Pender started to choose
his college, he wasn't noticed even
by San Jose State, a school which
has feelers out for every second
rate athlete in the business.
The reason behind the brush was
simple enough. In high school at
Manual Arts, a stones-throw from
Bovard Field, Fender was a bum. a
real gook who barely earned him
self a suit.
His main duty was to toss-up
batting practice pitches, and he had
a hard time doing that. But like
| all guys with the baseball-bug, he
was determined to make good, and
for no reason at all except that he
liked the place, he enrolled at that
