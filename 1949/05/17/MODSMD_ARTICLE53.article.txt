### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Last Friday's USC Daily Trojan
sports page includes the following
item concerning this weekend's PCC
swimming meet:
"Heavy favorites to walk oIY
with this swimfest, now that they
don't have to worry about Stan
ford's injured ace Ralph Sala. the
C'adymen should win all hut one
or two events, and might win
thein all."
Naturally, this statement did not
set too well with my pro-Indian
disposition, so I immediately tod
dled over to the Encina pool to pick
up Tom Haynie's reaction to this
bit of Trojan blasphemy.
At the pool office, beneath a dis
orderly heap of mutilated news
paper clippings, University press
releases, and sports page form
sheets, I found Tom busily at work
entering numbers on a columned
sheet of paper on his desk.
He was doping the conference
meet, of course; and from the fact
that he was not wearing his usual
wide grin, I silently predicted that
the normally confident Haynie
would step out of character and
second the Trojan scribe's predic
tion.
I should have known better.
Dauntless Tom, while not willing
in this case to make his usual flat
prediction of a Card victory, was
still hopeful of his Indians'
chances.
True, tiie Card mentor admits
that the Trojans should take most
of the first-place rpots this week
end. Such lads as Wally Wolf in
the 220 and 440. Don Hughes in the
100, Harry Messenheimer in the
' reaststroke, and Tom Hairabedian
in the diving are not to be denied
their rightful roles as favorites.
But in the conference meet points
are awarded to the first five men
in each event, on a 5-4-3-2-1 basis,
and Haynie sincerely believes that
the Stanford depth gives his boys
at least an even chance in their
defense ol the title they have won
in each of the last three years.
For instance, while Wolf will
doubtlessly win the 220. Hub Stoke
ly and Johnny Mowatt of the Cards
could easily finish two-three and
Rod Mead should be good for a
fifth. That's 8 points to Troy's 7.
That's the way Haynie figures it
in quite a few of the eventsâ€”USC
first, but Stanford still picking up
a good share of the points. Fur
thermore, Tom looks for Woody
Hoogs to take first in the 100 and
Jack Weeden to do likewise in the
150-yard backstroke.
The relays must be rated a
toss-up nght now, and therein
toss-up right now, and therein
lies the key to the entire pu/zle.
Haynie's completed do|ie - sheet
shows USC and Stanford within
a few points of each other before
the relay figures are reckoned
with.
In short, the whole thing boils
down to this: whoever wins the two
relay events Saturday should be
this year's Pacific Coast swimming
:hamp.
