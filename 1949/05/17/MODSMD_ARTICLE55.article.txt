# Card Tennis Team Travels To Broncoland
## 
### 
Wednesday is Bronco-taming day
for the Stanford tennis team when
the Indians meet Santa Clara on
the enemy's court at 1 p.m.
Fresh from an easy 6 to 3 victory
over San Jose State last Friday, the
Cards are showing better form as
the season draws to a close.
In the tussle with the Spartans,
Coach Bugge shifted the lineup to
allow some of the top players a rest
while he gave the more inexperi
enced members of the team a
chance to perform under fire.
If the Broncos prove to be tame
as they have before, Bugge will
probably make the same switch for
Wednesday's match. The Cards ran

the Santa Clarans into the courts
the last time out and should repeat.
While an Indian victory is ex
pected Wednesday, the shoe will be
on the other foot Saturday. At 1:30
the USC Trojans, the old meanies
who have been messing up Stanford
squads all year long, will meet the
Cards on the Farm courts, and by
no stretch of the imagination can
the home team be favored.
With the varsity tennis squad
busy, the frosh netters take a rest
this week. The frosh earned their
right to rest with a victory over
Berkeley High by a 5 to 4 count.
