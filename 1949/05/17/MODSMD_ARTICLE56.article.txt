## 
### DICK KLEIN 
With eyes centered on added lau
rels at Modesto's Pacific Coast
Championship Relays, the freshman
tracksters dig in this week for their
final workouts of the season.
The season of '49 has been an
outstanding one for the frosh. In
cluded in their hatful of wins is a
sterling victory over the Cal Cubs,
while their single loss was to Stock
ton JC by a narrow three points.
Well - balanced and outstanding
athletes were the keynotes to the
Papoose successes. Best criteria for
future chances are the Cal meet re
sults and the season's best times and
distances.
Taylor Tops
Wilbur Taylor showed the way in
the Papooses' 70' a to 60 1 > triumph
over the cubs. A double win in the
sprints and a surprise first in the
low hurdles gave Taylor a total of
15 points for the meet. His times
of :10 fiat and:21. S rate him as the
best sprinter on the squad. Pete
Sanford, who came from the East
ern seaboard with good dash marks,
was hampered al! season by a bad
leg.
Not a couple, but four steady
quarter-milers galloped the single
lap for the yearlings. Stan Dawson,
Nelson Judah. Wally McCamant,
and Ken Payson were all under 52
seconds. McCamant won the Little
Big Meet with a :50.f1. a mark
which was the year's best.
As a team, the foursome went un
defeated in all meets.
Wooley Wild
Distoncemen John Wooley and
Bob Barry made their best time of
the season against Cal. dropping
wire decisions in each instance.
Woo'ey fell to Lew Olive of Cal in
both the 880 and the mile. His sec
ond-place times were a respectable
1:59.3 and 4:30.
Having trouble with the added
inches in the barriers, high school
flash Biil Storum never approached
his expected times, but kept around
:15 and:25 in the highs and lows.
These times were usually good
enough for a double win.
Other hurdlers with outstanding
possibilities were Jim Pollock, lows
and dashes, and Paul Warner, high
barriers. Both scored seconds
against Cal in their events.
Hokanson Hot
Muscleman Charlie Hokanson
ruled supreme in the shot and dis
cus. With marks of better than 47
ft. and 138 ft., Charlie appears to
be a sharp varsity prospect. Frank
Bradley. Cal meet winner at 136 ft.
11 3 4 in., is another discus hurler of
merit.

With eyes centered on added lau
rels at Modesto's Pacific Coast
Championship Relays, the freshman
tracksters dig in this week for their
final workouts of the season.
The season of '49 has been an
outstanding one for the frosh. In
cluded in their hatful of wins is a
sterling victory over the Cal Cubs,
while their single loss was to Stock
ton JC by a narrow three points.
Well - balanced and outstanding
athletes were the keynotes to the
Papoose successes. Best criteria for
future chances are the Cal meet re
sults and the season's best times and
distances.
Taylor Tops
Wilbur Taylor showed the way in
the Papooses' 70' a to 60 1 > triumph
over the cubs. A double win in the
sprints and a surprise first in the
low hurdles gave Taylor a total of
15 points for the meet. His times
of :10 fiat and:21. S rate him as the
best sprinter on the squad. Pete
Sanford, who came from the East
ern seaboard with good dash marks,
was hampered al! season by a bad
leg.
Not a couple, but four steady
quarter-milers galloped the single
lap for the yearlings. Stan Dawson,
Nelson Judah. Wally McCamant,
and Ken Payson were all under 52
seconds. McCamant won the Little
Big Meet with a :50.f1. a mark
which was the year's best.
As a team, the foursome went un
defeated in all meets.
Wooley Wild
Distoncemen John Wooley and
Bob Barry made their best time of
the season against Cal. dropping
wire decisions in each instance.
Woo'ey fell to Lew Olive of Cal in
both the 880 and the mile. His sec
ond-place times were a respectable
1:59.3 and 4:30.
Having trouble with the added
inches in the barriers, high school
flash Biil Storum never approached
his expected times, but kept around
:15 and:25 in the highs and lows.
These times were usually good
enough for a double win.
Other hurdlers with outstanding
possibilities were Jim Pollock, lows
and dashes, and Paul Warner, high
barriers. Both scored seconds
against Cal in their events.
Hokanson Hot
Muscleman Charlie Hokanson
ruled supreme in the shot and dis
cus. With marks of better than 47
ft. and 138 ft., Charlie appears to
be a sharp varsity prospect. Frank
Bradley. Cal meet winner at 136 ft.
11 3 4 in., is another discus hurler of
merit.
