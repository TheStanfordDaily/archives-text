### 
It will be the winner of the SAE-
Theta Delta Chi contest versus the
Fijis on Thursday for the Univer
sity volleyball championship.
The SAE's won their way into the
semi-final round yesterday by 15
to 11 and 15 to 5 wins over a Phi
Sig II team. Theta Chi took Croth
ers over the hurdles to win a like
spot in the semi-finals.
The two teams will meet at 4:30
this afternoon to fight it out for
final honors against the Fijis, who
had dumped the Phi Delt Rams to
gain the top rung spot.
It was large' > due to the work of
Don Stites and Jim Brett that the
SAE's ran their win streak to seven
by downing the Phi Sigs.
The SAE's have won all seven of
their games and have not been
pressed into a three-game set as
yet.
The Theta Delts had it easy with
Crothers Hall, winning 15 to 5 and
15 to 10. The victors were paced by
Julian Cans, member of the Stan
ford team that won honors in the
Southland over the weekend, and
Ed Marriott.
