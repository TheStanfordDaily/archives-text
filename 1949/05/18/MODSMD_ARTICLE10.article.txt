## Hashing Committee 
### 
Hashing employment policy by the University was questioned
yesterday in a letter to The Daily by seven students. We have
received other complaints orally during the year concerning stu
dents holding down hashing positions in place of more needy
students.
The University dining hall office has one check on prospective
hafhers' needs. They fill out a student employment application
form that requests information on physical status, car owner
ship, past hashing experience, preference of hashing assignment,
need of work, and family aid.
Unfortunately, however, too many hashers have not answered
the form truthfully, and they have won jobs under false pre
tenses.
Since money is becoming more valuable, the need for jobs is
increasing, and hashing applications will be more numerous next
year than they were last autumn. And the task of picking new
student hashers will be more difficult than ever.
We believe that a better co-ordinated system for hiring stu
dent hashers is needed on the Farm.
Such it system might be found in a student committee of
three active hashers plus one taculty representative reviewing
student applications tor hashing positions in University dormi
tories and houses.
The committee would operate more efficiently than a Uni
versity individual or committee because students know their own
age group better. Not only can students appraise other students
better, but they also can do it with less misunderstanding than
an older adult can.
The committee's usefulness would be greater during the winter
and spring quarters when fewer hashing jobs would be open
and when more students would have spent their summer earn
ings.
Since autumn quarter hashing positions are filled during the
summer and the first few days of autumn quarter, the committee
would not be able to review new applications until the first week
of school. In that case, it would dismiss the men and women who
do not need the work to pay the University board bill. Any va
cancies created would be filled with students needing the posi
tion in order to continue with University studies.
Future vacancies developing by students leaving hashing
positions could be filled by men and women showing the greatest
need for the work.
The hashing committee would operate under the director of
University dining halls. Their decisions would be forwarded to
the director as recommendations.
One of the complimentary points about Stanford's environ
ment is that students can hash and not suffer socially as a re
sult. In fact, many students will go to all lengths to get a hash
ing job in order to meet more friends.
Under such circumstances, therefore, it is important that we
protect the hashing position for the students in need of work
in order to remain in school.

student hashers will be more difficult than ever.
We believe that a better co-ordinated system for hiring stu
dent hashers is needed on the Farm.
Such it system might be found in a student committee of
three active hashers plus one taculty representative reviewing
student applications tor hashing positions in University dormi
tories and houses.
The committee would operate more efficiently than a Uni
versity individual or committee because students know their own
age group better. Not only can students appraise other students
better, but they also can do it with less misunderstanding than
an older adult can.
The committee's usefulness would be greater during the winter
and spring quarters when fewer hashing jobs would be open
and when more students would have spent their summer earn
ings.
Since autumn quarter hashing positions are filled during the
summer and the first few days of autumn quarter, the committee
would not be able to review new applications until the first week
of school. In that case, it would dismiss the men and women who
do not need the work to pay the University board bill. Any va
cancies created would be filled with students needing the posi
tion in order to continue with University studies.
Future vacancies developing by students leaving hashing
positions could be filled by men and women showing the greatest
need for the work.
The hashing committee would operate under the director of
University dining halls. Their decisions would be forwarded to
the director as recommendations.
One of the complimentary points about Stanford's environ
ment is that students can hash and not suffer socially as a re
sult. In fact, many students will go to all lengths to get a hash
ing job in order to meet more friends.
Under such circumstances, therefore, it is important that we
protect the hashing position for the students in need of work
in order to remain in school.
