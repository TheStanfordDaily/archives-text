Report on Varitype
To the Editor:
In, answer to the many inquiries I have received about Varitype. here
is a brief resume of progress to date.
As you know, my trip to Yale was for the purpose of analyzing the effi
ciency of student operation of a newspaper plant. Frankly, it wasn't very
good. The primary difficulties are in preventing the students from inter
fering with the operators' work, from playing with the Varitype machines
and throwing them out of adjustment, in scheduling production so that
all personnel are busy all the time, and in organizing time for producing
enough outside work to keep men and equipment busy when the paper is
not in publication.
Study of the Yale operation convinced me that their arrangement would
be impractical at Stanford, and I returned with several recommendations.
The basic advantages of Varitype composition and olfset printing, inci
dentally, remain unchanged in my mind; as a matter of fact, I attended a
session of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association convention in
New York, where it was said that such methods were definitely the
coming thing in newspaper publication.
However, to set up a plant at a university, particularly here, would be,
I am certain, completely unfeasible without some outside control over
all phases of production. Students just don't have the experience and
the time necessary to administer such an operation. At a meeting with
the vice-President, Louis Lundborg, Dean Kimpton. and A 1 Masters,
I suggested that the ASSU build and equip a building and contract with
an outside individual to run it lor us, leaving him a total responsibility
for selling idle press time.
However, we all came to feel that entering into competition with the
University Pi ess and the Palo Alto printers waft. not advisable for The
Daily, and negotiations have been proceeding on the basis that we rent
space from the Press, buy some or all of the equipment ourselves, and
contract with the Press for supervision of the operation.
Since Donald Bean, Press Director, is in the East, no further meetings
can be held until next week.

Report on Varitype
To the Editor:
In, answer to the many inquiries I have received about Varitype. here
is a brief resume of progress to date.
As you know, my trip to Yale was for the purpose of analyzing the effi
ciency of student operation of a newspaper plant. Frankly, it wasn't very
good. The primary difficulties are in preventing the students from inter
fering with the operators' work, from playing with the Varitype machines
and throwing them out of adjustment, in scheduling production so that
all personnel are busy all the time, and in organizing time for producing
enough outside work to keep men and equipment busy when the paper is
not in publication.
Study of the Yale operation convinced me that their arrangement would
be impractical at Stanford, and I returned with several recommendations.
The basic advantages of Varitype composition and olfset printing, inci
dentally, remain unchanged in my mind; as a matter of fact, I attended a
session of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association convention in
New York, where it was said that such methods were definitely the
coming thing in newspaper publication.
However, to set up a plant at a university, particularly here, would be,
I am certain, completely unfeasible without some outside control over
all phases of production. Students just don't have the experience and
the time necessary to administer such an operation. At a meeting with
the vice-President, Louis Lundborg, Dean Kimpton. and A 1 Masters,
I suggested that the ASSU build and equip a building and contract with
an outside individual to run it lor us, leaving him a total responsibility
for selling idle press time.
However, we all came to feel that entering into competition with the
University Pi ess and the Palo Alto printers waft. not advisable for The
Daily, and negotiations have been proceeding on the basis that we rent
space from the Press, buy some or all of the equipment ourselves, and
contract with the Press for supervision of the operation.
Since Donald Bean, Press Director, is in the East, no further meetings
can be held until next week.
