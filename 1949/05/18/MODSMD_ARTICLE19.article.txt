## Dutch Refused to Arm Indonesians 
### 
The war came to Indonesia in
December 1941 and found the Dutch
completely unprepared. As Charles
Wolf. Jr., former American vice
consul in Batavia, has pointed out,
''the Indonesian people did not have
any arms with which to fight the in
vader, since the Dutch government
had avoided arming or training any
large groups .... particularly . .
. . educated or nationalist Indo
nesians." (Wolf. C.. The Indonesian
Story, p. 12.)
This policy was not changed even
after 1939 when mass mobilizations
were taking place all over the world.
The Dutch were afraid that once
the Indonesian people were to get
arms and drive out the Japanese,
they might profit by this experience
and turn out the Dutch, too.
As a matter of fact, many Indo
nesian leaders, including Soekarno
and Sjahrir, who had expressed their
opposition to fascism, were impris
oned, exiled, or put under detention.
No doubt, the Dutch rule collapsed
soon after the Japanese invasion.
Even under these emergency con
ditions, the Dutch refused to give
independence to the Indonesians and
ask them to tight for it. Ttiey wanted
the Indonesian people to fight a
totalitarian threat from outside
while submitting to a totalitarian
reality inside.
Thus, the problem for the Indo
nesian people was not posed as a
choice between freedom and subju
gation but between one master and
another.
After their defeat, the Dutch of
ficials left for Australia and hist all
contact with Indonesia. (Wolf. op.
eit.. p. 12.) The Indonesian leaders,
left behind in jails by the Dutch,
had to improvise their own strategy
in dealing with the Japanese. Fail
ing to establish any liaison with
ihe exiled Dutch officials, and hav
ing no arms, they decided to follow
two different tactics.
One u'oup led by Sjahrir and
SjarLVeddin. consisting mainly oi

trade union leaders, organized an i
underground resistance movement j
against the Japanese.
The second group, led by Soe
karno and Hatta, decided to have
some working relationships with the j
Japanese. Forced by military neces- j
sity, the Japanese had to permit
them to organize and consolidate •
the nationalist movement. And |
what was even more important, the i
Indonesian leaders succeeded in I
getting arms. It is to be noted that ;
the two groups kept in close con
tact with each other.
As a result of this strategy, soon j
after the fall of Japan, the Indo
nesian people were able to declare 1
the formation of an independent re- j
public whose first prime minister I
was Sjahrir and whose first presi- j
dent was Soekarno.
Regarding the charge of the Re- |
public being a Japanese puppet, the
then Dutch lieutenant governor- j
general of the Netherlands Indies [
(Indonesia), Dr. van Mook, admitted '
in October 194G:
"Misled by outward appearances j
.... we originally reported the j
Republic too much as a Japanese j
invention, and when in October and !
November the movement developed ,
with the speed of tropical growth j
into a sort of popular revolt com- i
parable to the September days of
1792 in the French Revolution, it !
was difficult to gauge properly the 1

inherent lasting power of this phe
nomenon;' (Wolf, op. cit., p. 14.)
The government of the Indonesian
Republic was formed by more than
seven political parties and other
groups representing labor, students,
and women.
Regarding the comeback of the
Dutch and their further efforts to
reconquer Indonesia, the remarks ot
Owen the foremost Far
Eastern authority in America, are
enlightening. He says:
"The elephant boy was unable to
climb back on the elephant without
British help. A British force found
that the Indonesians fought so ef
fectively that Japanese who had
surrendered had to be armed again
and sent into battle against them;
the British were unable to recon
quer the islands, but they were able
to get the Dutch back in."
Since then, the story of Indo
nesian politics has been the story of
how the Dutch have slowly built
up their military forces, winning
time to do so by setting up as many
patronized states as possible to
compete with the Indonesian Re
public, and by resorting intermit
tently to sudden but not sustained
military action in order to break the
organized military forces of the Re
public without running the risk of
a long and exhausting colonial war."

patronized states as possible to
compete with the Indonesian Re
public, and by resorting intermit
tently to sudden but not sustained
military action in order to break the
organized military forces of the Re
public without running the risk of
a long and exhausting colonial war."
(Lattimore, 0., The Situation in
Asia. pp. 204-5.)
The war came to Indonesia in
December 1941 and found the Dutch
completely unprepared. As Charles
Wolf. Jr., former American vice
consul in Batavia, has pointed out,
''the Indonesian people did not have
any arms with which to fight the in
vader, since the Dutch government
had avoided arming or training any
large groups .... particularly . .
. . educated or nationalist Indo
nesians." (Wolf. C.. The Indonesian
Story, p. 12.)
This policy was not changed even
after 1939 when mass mobilizations
were taking place all over the world.
The Dutch were afraid that once
the Indonesian people were to get
arms and drive out the Japanese,
they might profit by this experience
and turn out the Dutch, too.
As a matter of fact, many Indo
nesian leaders, including Soekarno
and Sjahrir, who had expressed their
opposition to fascism, were impris
oned, exiled, or put under detention.
No doubt, the Dutch rule collapsed
soon after the Japanese invasion.
Even under these emergency con
ditions, the Dutch refused to give
independence to the Indonesians and
ask them to tight for it. Ttiey wanted
the Indonesian people to fight a
totalitarian threat from outside
while submitting to a totalitarian
reality inside.
Thus, the problem for the Indo
nesian people was not posed as a
choice between freedom and subju
gation but between one master and
another.
After their defeat, the Dutch of
ficials left for Australia and hist all
contact with Indonesia. (Wolf. op.
eit.. p. 12.) The Indonesian leaders,
left behind in jails by the Dutch,
had to improvise their own strategy
in dealing with the Japanese. Fail
ing to establish any liaison with
ihe exiled Dutch officials, and hav
ing no arms, they decided to follow
two different tactics.
One u'oup led by Sjahrir and
SjarLVeddin. consisting mainly oi

trade union leaders, organized an i
underground resistance movement j
against the Japanese.
The second group, led by Soe
karno and Hatta, decided to have
some working relationships with the j
Japanese. Forced by military neces- j
sity, the Japanese had to permit
them to organize and consolidate •
the nationalist movement. And |
what was even more important, the i
Indonesian leaders succeeded in I
getting arms. It is to be noted that ;
the two groups kept in close con
tact with each other.
As a result of this strategy, soon j
after the fall of Japan, the Indo
nesian people were able to declare 1
the formation of an independent re- j
public whose first prime minister I
was Sjahrir and whose first presi- j
dent was Soekarno.
Regarding the charge of the Re- |
public being a Japanese puppet, the
then Dutch lieutenant governor- j
general of the Netherlands Indies [
(Indonesia), Dr. van Mook, admitted '
in October 194G:
"Misled by outward appearances j
.... we originally reported the j
Republic too much as a Japanese j
invention, and when in October and !
November the movement developed ,
with the speed of tropical growth j
into a sort of popular revolt com- i
parable to the September days of
1792 in the French Revolution, it !
was difficult to gauge properly the 1

inherent lasting power of this phe
nomenon;' (Wolf, op. cit., p. 14.)
The government of the Indonesian
Republic was formed by more than
seven political parties and other
groups representing labor, students,
and women.
Regarding the comeback of the
Dutch and their further efforts to
reconquer Indonesia, the remarks ot
Owen the foremost Far
Eastern authority in America, are
enlightening. He says:
"The elephant boy was unable to
climb back on the elephant without
British help. A British force found
that the Indonesians fought so ef
fectively that Japanese who had
surrendered had to be armed again
and sent into battle against them;
the British were unable to recon
quer the islands, but they were able
to get the Dutch back in."
Since then, the story of Indo
nesian politics has been the story of
how the Dutch have slowly built
up their military forces, winning
time to do so by setting up as many
patronized states as possible to
compete with the Indonesian Re
public, and by resorting intermit
tently to sudden but not sustained
military action in order to break the
organized military forces of the Re

and sent into battle against them;
the British were unable to recon

military action in order to break the
organized military forces of the Re
public without running the risk of
a long and exhausting colonial war."
