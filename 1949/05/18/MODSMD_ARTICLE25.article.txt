"Labor Day" on the Farm is a
tradition as old as the Convalescent
Home itself.
On the very Saturday in April
1920 before Senator Stanford's old
summer home was to be shown to
the Con Home Board of Directors
to see if they wanted to use it for
a permanent home site, A 1 "Dutch"
Roth, then University comptroller,
took a look at the cluttered mansion
and decided it had to be cleaned.
Not losing a moment's time,
"Dutch" hot-looted it up to the Row,
secured the services of three Dekes,
two Alpha Delts, and two Betas and
hustled them off to the white-faced
manse out beyond the Cactus Gar
dens.
Under his watchful eye the roughs
worked over the kiddies' "home to
be' the rest of that day and the next
morning until just before the dime
tors came. The house was so clean
that they agreed to establish the
Convalescent Home there at a rent
of $1 a year.
The laborers in the meanwhile
promptly adjourned to the lake to
recoup some of their lost energies.
Thus the idea of working at the Con
Home was established.
In May, just after the home was
officially opened, "Labor Day" was
