established so that the grounds could
be cleaned out. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, president at that time, de
clared a half-holiday for that pur
pose. A barbecue was served to the
workers after they had completed
! their project.
Sam McDonald was made chief
j cook and bottlewasher for the clean
up celebration. Menu for the day
was six whole sheep fixed in the
Southern style and served by the
Stanford gal;?, who then were not
pressed into rake and hoe duties.
On the agenda for this grandfather
of Labor Days was a parade of
wagons to haul the students to the
site of their rigors. The queue was
to be followed by a water wagon,
and by May 10, 1920, according to
The Daily, "it has not been definitely
decided who will be permitted to
pull it."
The Farm laborers were enter
tained on that memorable May 115
by several vaudeville acts and a six
piece band. The inevitable Stanford
quartet also rendered some songs.
Stanford fashions and appetites
have annually undergone a change
through the years on Labor Day.
But the students still flock to the
Con Home and get acquainted with
the children.
