As ;i little boy waited impatiently

'arid across thc> table at a kindly
N'cero man and asked. "Do you have
.nv children, Sam?"
The guest — Sam McDonald —
bought a minute and then replied.
'Why certainly I do."
"How many?" the boy asked.
"Oh. I don't know." was the
inswer.
"You don't know how many ehil
ren you have?" the astonished lad
jitcried.
"Well, said Sam. looking around
he table, "I can count 28 here, but
nere ;;re many more in the bed
vards ;ind (<ut at the University."
This is the same Sam McDonald
hom many alumni, students, and
..trents have loved for four decades.

•Mumni, of which Sam is honorary
ife-time president.

>rixe-winning victory gardens,
le cooks the traditional Labor Day
•arbecue every year.
His latest project is the construc
tion of a picnic ground and barbe

cue pit for the "run-about" children
1 in a small alcove among the euca
i typhis trees.
Every Halloween the youngsters'
friend hauls dozens of pumpkins to
bur dedicated Sam McDonald Road,
which is near the varsity tenuis
courts. One man. the vice-president
ol Columbia University, received
the wards where he helps them
carve jackolanterns. In between
times the children get him to sing
old folk songs to them.
The boys and girls reward him by
their physical recovery, which he

January 1, Sam's birthday, the
children invite their friend to a
party which always includes a big
gift which the youngsters make in
handicraft classes.
Sam often forgets his friends'
names, but they always remember
him. One little boy who had re

covered at the Convalescent Home
but had to return lour years later
with a new ailment, popped his first
quesion to the nurse, "Where's
Sam?"
Probably Sam's fondest memory is
the day when Dr. Ray Lyman Wil

pointment to ollice. and answered by
saying that the occasion was small
compared to the one at which Sam
had been honored.
It was 1903 when Sam McDonald
came to Stanford. Since 15(07. he has
been chief custodian of the athletic
fields. His barbecues, made famous
at the Convalescent Home Labor

'Why certainly I do."
"How many?" the boy asked.
"Oh. I don't know." was the
inswer.
"You don't know how many ehil
ren you have?" the astonished lad

"Well, said Sam. looking around
he table, "I can count 28 here, but
nere ;;re many more in the bed
vards ;ind (<ut at the University."

names, but they always remember
him. One little boy who had re

covered at the Convalescent Home
but had to return lour years later
with a new ailment, popped his first
quesion to the nurse, "Where's
Sam?"
Probably Sam's fondest memory is
the day when Dr. Ray Lyman Wil

saying that the occasion was small
compared to the one at which Sam
had been honored.
It was 1903 when Sam McDonald
came to Stanford. Since 15(07. he has
been chief custodian of the athletic
