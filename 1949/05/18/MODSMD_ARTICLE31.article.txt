# Convalescent Home Kiddies Have Own Rhythm Band
## 
### JACK LITTLE 
Last week I attended a kind of
special band practice. The band was
composed of 15 kids, 4 to 12 years
old. in one of the wards at the Stan
ford Convalescent Home.
Ever watch a little boy at a con
cert . . . his rapt expression of won
derment at the magic of the music?
Combine that expression with the
same little boy's intense concentra
tion as he practices his first piano
lessons, multiply by 13 children,
and that's what 1 saw at that band
practice.
The band is made up entirely of
improvised rhythm instruments . . .
drums, triangles, maracas, casta
nets, tambourines, wood - blocks,
hells, sandpaper blocks, and the
like. But somehow the music comes
out with a melodic flavor.
Each of the numbers in the band's
repertoire has been painstakingly
rehearsed under the guidance of
Marion Stuart, the children's teach
er. Miss Stuart chooses a record,
plays it over and over for the chil
dren, and tlie group decides which
rhythm instruments are suited to
certain portions of the selection.
Then a regular musical score is pre
pared showing just when each in
strument plays, and the rehearsing
begins.
All of the children take real
pride in their' music and have a
lot of respect for their teacher. As
little Bill said:
"Gee. if it wasn't for Miss Stuart
we wouldn't know anything about
music. And you know, we're going
to give a real concert for our moth
ers pretty soon."

The rhythm band is part of the
Convalescent Monies program lor
bringing education to the bedside.
Regular report cards are issued ancl
many of the children have .shown
marked improvement in their
school work upon returning to reg
ular schools.
Some of the boys, who first began
to learn about music in the rhythm
band, have begun serious studies in
the field of music.
