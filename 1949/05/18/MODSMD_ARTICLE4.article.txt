# Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt Compared in Tuesday Series
## 
### 
"Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D.
Roosevelt," was the topic of last
night's Tuesday Evening Series at
the Memorial Auditorium. Speaking
on the subject was Dr. Harley A.
Notter, historian, author, and
statesman.
Dr. Notter compared the two men
on the grounds of their personal
background, party affiliations, early
political experience, handling of do
mestic problems and foreign rela
tions, and their relations with peo
ple in general.
In handling domestic problems.
Dr. Notter said Wilson spoke to the
people in terms of abstracts and
ideals. His audiences were inspired
by his speeches but could not iso
late the ideas upon which the
speeches we're based or bring them
to bear on their everyday problems.
Roosevelt, on the other hand, was

acutely aware of the current issues
facing the people.
Roosevelt kept his dealings,
whether personal or with foreign
governments, on a firsthand basin.
Wilson always made use of inter
mediaries.
Wilson, Dr. Notter said, tried to
do too much alone and relied on
fighting his way. Roosevelt, on the
other hand, managed to maintain
the support of those who disagreed
with him on minor issues. The main
contributions of both men, accord
ing to Dr. Notter, was the vitality
they instilled into the nation in time
of crisis.
