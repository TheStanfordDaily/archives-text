I act; but the majority of them,

tared for just about anything.
y thoughts about the 1849 Red
hine wander something like
. 'the Cards will he a higher
ring team, if because of Gary
rkorian alone. The ends will
k a lot better because they will
e scmeone to pass to them.
This added passing attack will
:e the Reds more of a threat at
times. Few teams will be able
jlay an eight-man line against
n as Army did at times.
. It has been a long time since
rchie lias had such depth at
1 or halfback. I wonder who
I play first string. I think
rchie is wondering too.
But just the opposite is true at
d and tackle. The old saying
a team is only as strong as its
•h makes me wonder if those
tions can hold up through the
le season. The team is bound
iifl'er some injuries.
. The team will be deep enough
play offensive and defensive
n in some positions and that
uld help a lot. It should make
a stronger team on the long
rches downfield.
I also wonder: Even if we had
lgth at guard and tackle, would
)e able to play football the way
good teams play it? Can the
get by on passes and nice run-
Did they learn anything in
game? Will they ever play
and sock football?
Follow through on the above:
