## 
###

played dead horse for the Indians.

9 to 0 defeat to their rivals in that
one.
Today the Farm netters will be
out to repeat, but Coach Bugge will
probably use some second-string
players to ease up on the hapless
Santa Clarans.

be Bob Lewis, Kirke Mechem. Errol
Lycette, Fred Lewis, Lucien Bar
bour. and Vincent Schmeider, but
Bugge indicated that there will be

some of the singles or doubles com
binations.
