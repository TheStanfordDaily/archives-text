# Troy Bids For Swim Crown
## 
### 
It's the final splash of the season
this weekend for Tom Haynie's
Stanford swimmers, as the Card
mermen take to the USC pool Fri
day and Saturday in search of their
fourth consecutive conference meet
victory.
Although swimmers from all four
Southern Division schools will be
featured in the Figueroa fish carni
val, the meet looks to be strictly a
two-team title-chase between the
Indians and the men from Troy.
The Trojans hit the headlines
earlier this season when they be
came the first team to defeat the
Cards in dual competition since
1942: and the pre-meet dope sheets
rate the southland supermen as
slight favorites to paddle off with
the conference championship that
has been a Farm fixture since 194(5.
The Stanford squad will be led
on their southward trek by co-cap- I
tains Woody Hoogs and Don Hes- 1
ter. Hoogs will enter the 50- and
100 - yard dashes and —if he can
equal his previous season's best |
time of 21-I.9—should streak home in
first place in the 50.
Hester is the defending champ in
the 200 breaststroke. but he'll be (
facing a host of potent challengers I
in the Figueroa bath — including ;
such standouts as Troy's Harry
Messenheimer, the current favor- j
ite: UCLA's Gil Tuffli; and Waldo
Cook of Berkeley's Golden Bears. I
