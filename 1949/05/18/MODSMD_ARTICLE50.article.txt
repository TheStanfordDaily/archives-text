# World's Best To Perform at Coliseum
## Dillard, Dixon, Patton, Bryan Among Cinder Carnival Stars 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
The top-flight Coliseum Relays, which will be held this Fridav
night in Los Angeles, will host the year's best collection of track
greats from all over the United States and ths world.
Not since the Olympic Games of 1948 has there been such a
galaxy of cinder stars in a single meet. It will take somethinc

more than threatening weather to
keep many of the track records
from falling by the wayside.
One of the principal attractions !
will be Harrison Dillard, record- j
breaking hurdler from Baldwin- j
Wallace, whose chief competition in
the high hurdles will be UCLA's
Craig Dixon.
Dillard chalked up the largest
consecutive string of victoiies that

a trackman has ever made, only to
hit a hurdle and not qualify for the
hi?hs in the Olympics.
However. Dillard made one of
the greatest comebacks of all time
when he placed in the trials of the
100-yard dash, and then went on
to become the Olympic champ in
the century event.
The great hurdler holds the pres-

ent world's record for the highs at
13.G, mace last year at the Kansas
Relays. In contrast, Dixon of UCLA
has been credited with a none-too
slow 14.0 in the same race. The
Bruin star is in great shape, having
won the high hurdles in the Fresno
Relays last week at 14.1. At any
rate, it is bound to be a great race.
Mrs. Fanny Blankers-Koen, her
alded as the greatest woman ath
lete of all time, has flown all the
way from her native Holland in.

Mrs. Blankers-Koen holds four
world's records, and paced Holland
in the Olympics last year by win
ning numerous races. Accompany
ing her on the trip to Los Angeles
is her trainer-husband Jan Blan
kers, who coached the Dutch
Olympic team.
Again on hand this weekend will
be the Trojan ace. Mel Patton, who
wi'.l anchor the USC sprint relay
teams.
If"'Pell-Mell" continues at his tre
mendous pace, there's no tellir.%
how many records could be broker..
Stanford, as announced yester
day, will send nine men to compete
on the Coliseum track. Indian
Downing McKee, who was crediteo
with a fast 14.3 in the trials of the
high hurdles at Fresno last week,
will face his stifl'est competition of
the year in Dillard and Dixon.

The top-flight Coliseum Relays, which will be held this Fridav
night in Los Angeles, will host the year's best collection of track
greats from all over the United States and ths world.
Not since the Olympic Games of 1948 has there been such a
galaxy of cinder stars in a single meet. It will take somethinc

more than threatening weather to
keep many of the track records
from falling by the wayside.
One of the principal attractions !
will be Harrison Dillard, record- j
breaking hurdler from Baldwin- j
Wallace, whose chief competition in
the high hurdles will be UCLA's
Craig Dixon.
Dillard chalked up the largest
consecutive string of victoiies that

a trackman has ever made, only to
hit a hurdle and not qualify for the
hi?hs in the Olympics.
However. Dillard made one of
the greatest comebacks of all time
when he placed in the trials of the
100-yard dash, and then went on
to become the Olympic champ in
the century event.
The great hurdler holds the pres-

ent world's record for the highs at
13.G, mace last year at the Kansas
Relays. In contrast, Dixon of UCLA
