# Trojans Have Signed Petition Demanding New Election Board
## 
### 
University of Southern California students may have a new
election commission to organize voting procedure for a second
.ASSC election this semester.
The students signed petitions demanding another election and
election commission after evidence had been found that indi-

cated the school's spring elections *
were not conducted properly. More ,
bill lots were cast than there were
registration cards on file. Students
also claimed that the elections com
missioner destroyed the cards pre
maturely.
Monday Barbara Potter, ASSC
vice-president, said a special session I
of the Senate will he called as soon
as enough petition signatures
(1,640) have been checked among
the 4,000 turned in to the student
bdoy office.
Miss Potter said she will call the
special session and make her rec
ommendations for the new elections
commissioner and the election com
misison.
"I will try and split the election
commission evenly," she said, indi
cating that Unity (independent)
Party and Row will be equally rep
resented on the new commission.
Grafton Tanquary was named as
the person most likely to be selected
by the vice-president as elections
commissioner.
"He is objective in his outlook, and
I believe he is trusted by both
sides," Miss Potter said. "I be
lieve that there should be another
election," she added.
Arrangements already have been
made to keep the marked ballots in
the proposed elections in the vault
of a local bank. The move will be
made to prevent the stuffing of bal-
Jot boxes.
