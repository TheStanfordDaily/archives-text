## 
### Associated Press 
Unchecked Chinese Commu-1
nist armies all but encircled
Shanghai Tuesday, swept to
within 87 miles of the southeast
port of Foochow and were re
ported but 225 miles from Can- j
ton, the refugee capital.
The southbound Red juggernauts ;
appeared to be virtually unopposed |
Communist armies simply walked
into the three big cities of Hankow,
Wuchang, and Hanyang, grouped on
the Yangtze in Central China.
Military observers in Canton de- 1
elated that was little but '"moun
tains and space" between that
South China citv and a Red column

which has slashed 300 miles south
of the Yangtze. Wealthy Cantonese
were fleeing to the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong.
Only on the Shanghai front did
the Nationalists appear to be put
ting up a battle. And even the gar
rison admitted the Reds were mak
ing encircling moves that put the
city in imminent peril.

I A communique said the Reds had
i reached Chwansha, 12 miles east ot
| Shanghai's waterfront. This meant
that tlie Reds held lines about three
fourths of the way around China's
| greatest city.
The Communists also reached
Chowpu, at the outskirts of Pootung,
; the sprawling industrial district
i across the Whangpoo River from
I Shanghai. Chowpu is but seven
miles from the Shanghai waterfront.
The cannonading roared louder
I than ever in Shanghai as the Red?
stepped up their attacks from the
| southeast. The Nationalists were
pouring in reinforcements.
Pressure on Shanghai lessened on
the south and north. Here, before
I Lungwha Airport on the south and
the Fortress of Woosung on the
north, the Nationalists made a de
i termined stand.
