In anybody's book, one of them
is Paul W. Trousdale. Said TIME'S
issue of December 2, 1946:
With a banker's natural curiosity,
old A. P. Giannini wanted to meet the
32-year-old builder who had already
borrowed $30 million from his Hank
of America, and was now asking for
$50 million more. So he made a special
trip to Los Angeles, dropped in or.
Paul W. Trousdale, looked at his past
projects and future plans. Danker
Ciannini's curiosity was apparently
satisfied, for last week Trousdale an
nounced that he was getting his S5O
million loan.
Past Projects. The record which im
pressed Banker Giannini: during the
war the Paul \V. Trousdale Construc
tion Co. had built 3.0:5 small houses,
including seven big housing projects
Xow it was hard at work 011 2.000
houses for veterans and was turning
them out at the rate of ten a day.

.1./'. took a look.
Paul Trousdale got into the Los
Angeles building business by way of
the University of Southern California
and the ad department of Beech-Xut
After a year as an adman, Trousdale
took a J?i2s-a-month timekeeper's job
with a local contractor, quit to form
his own company with a $10,000 bank
loan to finance it.
On each project, he and his stock
holders put up the money to cover the
cost of real estate, got Bank of Amer
ica loans to cover all construction
costs, had little trouble getting mate
rials by his cash-on-the-line policy.
Like most builders he formed a new
corporation for each project, dissolved
it when the project was finished. Thus
his fat profits were taxable at only
:? c c as capital gains, gave him plenty
of capital to expand. In all, he invested
some $900,000 in his wartime projects,
made another Sqoo.ooo.
Future Plans. Well heeled at war's
end. he decided the time had come to
plunge. For this he picked one of the
best pieces of undeveloped land ir
Southern California, a 625-acre tract
at Baldwin Hills, a short run from
downtown Los Angeles.
Now. with the Bank of America
loan, Trousdale plans to build S.OOO
rental units on 450 acres of it, along
with a 26-acre super-shopping center.
Eventually he hopes to build a hun
dred 13-story apartment houses on the
mrest of the land.
