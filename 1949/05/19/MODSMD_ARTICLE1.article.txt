# Excom Defeats Election By-Law, Considers Hashing
## 
### 
Excom last night defeated a by-law which would have pro
hibited anyone who has ever been convicted of Honor Code
violations or misuse of student office from running in an ASSU
election.
Lorry Lokey, Daily editor, suggested that Honor Code vio-

lators not be allowed to run for
positions" on Men's and Women's
Councils. Excom felt, however, that
once an offender had served his
term, he was completely free in the
eyes of the law, and no such re
strictions should be placed on the
candidate.
Don Fix and Lokey were ap
pointed to investigate the advisa
bility of setting up a Student Hash
ing Committee. Excom felt that
there were several problems that
should be clarified before a definite
committee was appointed.
"Ihe heart of the hashing selec
tion trouble is in the central of
fice,'' Lokey said. "Many applica
tions are never considered, and some
hashers, formerly subs, are now
working full-time without ever hav
ing filled out an application."
"In Union, the subs get the job
when there is an opening," Art Her
/og stated. "Anyone who really
wants a hashing job can get one by
first working as a sub."'
Lokey questioned the eligibility
of potential hashers who own late
model cars in relation to needy ap
plicants without cars. But Herzog
said this was not a fair judging point,
as some students put all their money
and time into a good car.
The main complaints against the
proposed Student Hashing Commit
tee was that it was too big a job
for students to handle. They would
never have time to closely consider
the hundreds of applications.
Hank Rosin, ASSU president-elect
for next year, suggested that all
applications be numbered and con
sidered only in the order of their
need, and that they were received,
and that applicants be required to
sign the Honor Code proving the
validity of their statements.
Hank Grandin. Sydney Morgan,
and Hank Rosin were appointed by
Excom to consider the methods of
appointing the summer quarter stu
dent government.
Frank Wolff announced that the
foreign students for next year had
been selected. Notifications have al
ready been mailed to them.
