Somehow summer weather (I
say that having carefully re
pressed the memory of last
weekend's rain) makes you want
to get out and play games, and
nothing is more comfortable for
sports than smart, tailored shorts
and a T shirt.
This year women's T shirts are
keeping pace with the men's.
Bermuda offers a special waffle
weave shirt with V neck soft
ened by a slight collar. They
have also put out a turtle neck
shirt. Harper suggests a T shirt
set in matching stripes, one with
simple round neck and the other
a cardigan. Harper also offers
the Gaucho type with a small
collar. The best thing about these
new T shirts is their attractive
colors and their unusual treat
ment of stripes. 52.50 to 53.50.
With your T shirt wear White
Stag shorts. The name "White
Stag" assures you of a fashion
skillfully cut for beauty in action,
These shorts come with patch
pwkets and French cuffs in
white duck, and in gray, red,
aqua, yellow, and faded blue
denim. 83.95.
Somehow summer weather
(don't give up. kiddies, one day
that sun will shine again) makes
the Indian maid want to bare
her shoulders to the sun. The
Clothes Closet has a new ship
ment of cotton sunback dresses
complemented with stoles and
jackets in plain colors, stripes,
and checks for only $12.95. This
is something you can't afford to
miss. Come down to the Clothes
