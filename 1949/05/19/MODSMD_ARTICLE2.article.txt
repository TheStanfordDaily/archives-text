# Action on Crew Letters Postponed
## 
### 
A by-law awarding a Block S to
first and second varsitj* crew men
who participated in either the Cal
or the Washington race or any other
two races, was tabled by Excom last
night, pending further consideration
of the problem.
"Not only did we have 150 stu
dents turn out for crew last fall,
but we also drew a crowd of be
tween 4,000 and 5.0G0 spectators to
the Cal race," Mark Hatfield said.
"The least we can do is to make
crew a major sport."
Gus Chavalas, ASSU president,
felt that the matter ought to be
uiven more thought.
' We have to see that it gets the
proper sudent support and also find
out how the Administration and
Athletic Department feel about the
whole matter," he said.
