# University Probes ATO 'Flu' Wave
## 
### 
The gastrointestinak outbreak at
the ATO house has not been fully
unraveled as yet. Dr. G. S. Luckett
of the Health Service reported last
night.
He said tht same symptoms could
be produced by either one type of
food poisoning or by so-called "in
testinal flu.'' So far as the investi
gation has gone, indications are that
food—minced ham—was involved,
and a sample of suspected food is
being studied at the Palo Alto Hos
pital laboratory.
Dr. Luckett reported that all af
fected persons had recovered from
the acute symptoms within three to
four hours and no new cases had
appeared by 2 p.m. yesterday. In
fact, he said, some of the patients
were able to eat a steak dinner at
7 the same evening.
