## Editor's Notebook 
### 
Tuesday night a false alarm was turned in at the box near the
isigma Nu House. Within a few minutes' time after the arrival
of the fire trucks, 30 or 35 cars with over 100 men and women
choked the narrow streets in the hilly area.
Had there been an emergency, the fire trucks would not have
been able to move. The campus police said yesterday that if
such a situation occurs again, they will have to enforce a state
iaw and tag cars blocking the road for emergency vehicles.
A Sunday Movie manager is needed for summer quarter. This
year's manager, Jim Kerr, will interview interested men and
women tomorrow from 11 a.m. to noon and from 3 to 4 p.m. in
the Excom room. The work pays $50 for the quarter.
Jim has done an excellent job this year in arranging for Sun
day movies. Every week the films have arrived on time, and
they have been good in quality.
Sunday movies have become a tradition here at Stanford, and
the summer manager will be expected to arrange a movie pro
gram, take care of Daily stories, and hire a projectionist. We
hope that a student as conscientious as Kerr will win the posi
tion.

The Sophomore Carnival is coming up tomorrow night. The
feature is a good money-maker for the Convalescent Home drive,
and is an excellent source for student entertainment. However,
we suggest one precaution of the class chairmen of the program:
Restrict the number and'or volume of loudspeakers that will
be used in the Pavilion and the handball court. Last year there
were so many loudspeakers turned on full volume that the entire
area sounded like a continuous explosion.

Yesterday's rainstorm brought out the inadequacy of the
wooden stairs leading from the sidewalk down to the Quad at
Ihe Geology Corner. Rainwater made the worn down, grooved
steps so slippery that students had to watch their step even more
closely. It would be better for the University carpenters to fix
it now than it would be for the school to suffer the legal and
medical consequences resulting from possible future injury to
a pedestrian.
About 70 new students from foreign countries will be coming
to Stanford next autumn. Nearly all of them are unfamiliar with
'he English language, and none of Ihem will know how to get
around during the first 10 days they are on campus.
Willard Waterous, foreign student adviser, will be organizing
a group of Farm students to receive and guide the students
around campus during registration week. In return, Farm men
and women will be able to cultivate new friendships and learn
about the students' home environments. More news on the proj
ect will appear in The Daily next week. Waterous' office is in
Temporary Building B.

they have been good in quality.
Sunday movies have become a tradition here at Stanford, and
the summer manager will be expected to arrange a movie pro
gram, take care of Daily stories, and hire a projectionist. We
hope that a student as conscientious as Kerr will win the posi
tion.

The Sophomore Carnival is coming up tomorrow night. The
feature is a good money-maker for the Convalescent Home drive,
and is an excellent source for student entertainment. However,
we suggest one precaution of the class chairmen of the program:
Restrict the number and'or volume of loudspeakers that will
be used in the Pavilion and the handball court. Last year there
were so many loudspeakers turned on full volume that the entire
area sounded like a continuous explosion.

Yesterday's rainstorm brought out the inadequacy of the
wooden stairs leading from the sidewalk down to the Quad at
Ihe Geology Corner. Rainwater made the worn down, grooved
steps so slippery that students had to watch their step even more
closely. It would be better for the University carpenters to fix
it now than it would be for the school to suffer the legal and
medical consequences resulting from possible future injury to
a pedestrian.
About 70 new students from foreign countries will be coming
to Stanford next autumn. Nearly all of them are unfamiliar with
'he English language, and none of Ihem will know how to get
around during the first 10 days they are on campus.
Willard Waterous, foreign student adviser, will be organizing
a group of Farm students to receive and guide the students
around campus during registration week. In return, Farm men
and women will be able to cultivate new friendships and learn
about the students' home environments. More news on the proj
ect will appear in The Daily next week. Waterous' office is in
Temporary Building B.
Tuesday night a false alarm was turned in at the box near the
isigma Nu House. Within a few minutes' time after the arrival
of the fire trucks, 30 or 35 cars with over 100 men and women
choked the narrow streets in the hilly area.
Had there been an emergency, the fire trucks would not have
been able to move. The campus police said yesterday that if
such a situation occurs again, they will have to enforce a state
iaw and tag cars blocking the road for emergency vehicles.
A Sunday Movie manager is needed for summer quarter. This
year's manager, Jim Kerr, will interview interested men and
women tomorrow from 11 a.m. to noon and from 3 to 4 p.m. in
the Excom room. The work pays $50 for the quarter.
Jim has done an excellent job this year in arranging for Sun
day movies. Every week the films have arrived on time, and
they have been good in quality.
