COMMON SENSE ABOUT FUND
RAISING by Robert Keith Lcavitt
(American Book-Stratford Press,
Inc.)
The review distributors for this
book could not possibly send a book
of this subject matter to a better
place than Stanford University.
Since fund raising appears to be
a major extracurricular activity on
this campus, Leavitt's advice is
really useful here.
Leavitt, personally intrigued by
the methods employed by such
large national organizations as the
Red Cross, the Community Chest,
the Salvation Army, etc., began a
very scientific analysis of the way
the various drives were conducted.
3y then tabulating the financial
success of each, he was able to as
certain the best possible means for
enlisting public support.
There are basically two types of
fund raising: the high-pressure "su
per fund' drive, and the small in
dependent crusade. There ;Â»re also
two types of causes: the social re

lief drive and (he health drive.
While still there are higher re
sponses ,to pressure shown in the
large social relief services, the Red
Cross, Community Chest, and Sal
vation army, the newly formed
! health organizations have risen rap
idly. For example, the infantile pa
ralysis "March ot Dimes" campaign
and the Cancer Fund have done
very well.
The author has also conducted a
survey to determine what caused
the people to contribute. Theater,
street booth, and door to door so
licitation is still the most thorough
method, although the Red Cross and
the Community Chest have found
that causing the employer to arbi
trarily deduct a donation from em
ployees' salaries is effective.
However, it was also observed
that about seven to 25 per cent of
. the donors to organizations using
this method made the comment that
while they didn't particularly ap
-1 prove of their methods, they felt
| forced to give.
