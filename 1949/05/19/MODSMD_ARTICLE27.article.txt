A ruling by the administration of i
Michigan State College, ordering !
fraternities to have housemothers by •
tall term of this year, is stirring up j
j strong opposition, according to the !
Michigan State News.
If the co-ops are forced to hire
; housemothers, Inter Co-op Council :
1 said, the cost of housing would in- !
crease from 514.53 to $18.37 per!
man per week. In addition, 36 men
from the seven co-op houses would j
be forccd to move out to make room
for the housemothers, meaning a
further loss of income.

The University of Connecticut
paper, Connecticut Campus, reports
that its "big, strapping senior men
and women" are well over the na
tional college average, after a study
ot the seniors' measurements for
caps and gowns.
Sez the Connecticut Campus, the
average man in the senior class is
5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs a
"sinewy" 160 pounds, has a 38-inch
chest, and a 22^-inch head.
The average senior coed is 5 feet
5 1 1; inches tall and weighs 125
pounds. One vital measurement was
not taken, and thus was based on
"the honesty of girls" .... 56 per
cent claimed the perfect 34 bust.
''Extremes in this case were several
38-inchers and a surprising small
number at 32." the paper reported.
