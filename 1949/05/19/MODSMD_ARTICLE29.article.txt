# Harvard Professor Develops Human Relations Machine

### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
A Harvard professor has a new
answer for man in the machine age
—a contraption which measures how
people get along with one another.
In the university's sociology de
partment. Professor Robert F.
Bales has set up his "interaction re
corder."' This machine has a metal
frame with 14 holes, one for each
of 14 different kinds of action.
Bales arranges his subjects in a
conference room and tells them to
conduct a meeting. Unknown to
ihem. Bales and his associates spy
on the group through a one-way
mirror covering one wall.
A sensitive voice recorder picks up
even the most confidential whispers
while Bales' assistants, using the
"interaction recorder," busily punch
appropriate holes in a paper ribbon
feeding into the machine.
Such small details as yawning and
table-tapping reveal a "profile"' of

the guinea-pig meeting. Actions are
classified according to one of the 14
categories. Baler, records such ac
tions as "squelching an imminent
misunderstanding," "surrendering
the floor," and "practicing team
work."
On the practical side. Bales lias
found that a group meeting tends to
follow a certain pattern, with the
person having the most prestige
often winning the audience to his
side of the argument.
Ey rearranging the furniture of
the experimental chamber, Bales
may easily transform the confer
ence chamber into an office or liv
ing room situation. In fact, he has
even begun a study of people who
play bridge together.
Another machine, the "interaction
chronograph" developed by Eliot D.
Chappie, has already been used by
department stores to sec how effi
cient their clerks are.
