# Dry Summer Faces Farm Despite Rains

### 
"I'm afraid it looks like another
j dry year for the Farm!"
Such was the dismal forecast of
Assistant Engineer Carl Maier as he
I compared this year's total precipi
tation with that of last year.
Almost as he spoke, though, the
| skies darkened and thunder rolled
| as this spring's heaviest rain began
i to fall.
So far this season, Maier's data
I book showed, 11.59 inches of rain
had fallen in the campus area. At
7 last evening an additional 1.35
inches was reported to have fallen
at Woodside in yesterday after
] noon's sudden downpour.
This would put this year's total
! rainfall more than an inch over that
loi last year at this time, 11.80
j inches.
San Francisco weather bureau
j predicted continued scattered show
| ers today, leaving the overall pic
i ture uncertain for now.
When interviewed early yester
-1 day, Maier figured that as additional
rains came in May and early June
last year to raise the total precipi
tation to 12.64 inches by June 15.
this year's total probably wouldn't
be lar ahead of last year's total, if
i it exceeded it at all.
