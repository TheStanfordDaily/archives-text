Balavia. Indonesia, since 1!).">!). In
15M1 she served in the Dutch East
Indian Army as a truck driver, and
displayed great courage during the
Japanese attack.
She was one of a few survivors,
when a troop transport, on which
she was hroflght from Java to Su
matra, was sunk by Japanese
dive-bombers.
After the Japanese occupation
of the islands had been completed,
she spent three and a half years
in a Japanese prison camp on Su
matra, from which she was res
cued by an Australian homher a
few weeks before the camp was
taken over by Republican troops

She came to America in liMfi,

In reference to the article by
Vidya Dutt and Bipan Chandra in
The Daily Tuesday, 1 would like to
comment upon a few of their state
ments.
As regards agricultural products
for export, most of them were intro
duced and developed by the Dutch,
in many cases at the cost of years
of disappointing and costly experi
mentation. Plantations for all these
products are only allowed in re
gions not occupied by the population
for agriculture and only where rice
culture is not possible.
Sugar is the only exception. Sugar
producers can rent, not buy, the land
from Indonesian village communi
ties, but are limited to one-third of
the acreage owned by the village
according to a system of rotation so
as not to exhaust the soil.

The authors of the article con
sider the living conditions of the In
donesian not flattering to the Dutch.
They complain about his normal
diet.
Well, lice and fish and. of course,
all kinds of tropical fruit is the pre
ferred diet of the Javanese popula
tion, even for the more wealthy. To
me, who have lived in Indonesia,
this sounds as when somebody woul
this sounds as when somebody
would pity Americans for having to
eat hamburgers!
The Dutch government has sup
plied irrigation and other assistance
in order to make it possible to grow
sufficient food for the unbelievably
dense population.
Java and Madura, with an area of
about 51.000 square miles, had before
the war a population of 46.000,000.
California has an area of 153,000
square miles (three times that of
Java). With the same density of
population as Java. California would
have 1i58.000.000 people, which is
nearly as much as the entire United
States.
What would be the standard of
living in California if the whole
population of the U.S. were con
centrated in this state? How would
it be possible to have a standard of
living comparable to any western
standard?
Notwithstanding the extremely
difficult situation ;is regards the sup
ply of food, even the most anti-
Dutch enthusiast must know and
admit that famines were unknown
under the Dutch regime, which cer
tainly cannot be said of India.
It may be interesting to know the
opinion of other Indonesians and
therefore I want to quote Dr.

Teunko Mansur, head of the im
portant Federal Indonesian State of
East Sumatra (the negara Sumatra-
Timur), where he said in an inter
view in December 1948:
"I am a fiery nationalist, in my
thoughts perhaps more "dangerous"
than Sukarno; but my sense for
reality forces me, alas, to state that
the people'of Indonesia are incap
able of self-government in the
democratic sense of the word, due
to their lack of knowledge, expe
rience, and technique.
"The few years of experience that
we have now had with the experi
ment "Republic." have fully con
vinced me that the time for Indo
nesia has not yet come. I hope and
dream and work in order to attain
eventually an Indonesia that will be
governed by Indonesians.
"It cannot even be considered that
in this period of education we could
do without the assistance of the
Netherlands.
"It would be a crime if the Neth
erlands were to leave Indonesia.
Then in the entire Archipelago the
same hell would arise as we can
now observe beyond the boundaries
of our negara (state)."
As we all know, Sukarno's Re
public has finally agreed to join the
other two-thirds of Indonesia and
the Netherlands in round table con
ference at The Hague. It is there
fore highly inopportune to continue
a propaganda which seems to have
no other object than the creation
of hostile feeling against the Dutch
whose sincere aim is to realize this
summer on a basis of mutual under
standing and confidence the Indo
nesian ideal: a free and independent
United States of Indonesia.
