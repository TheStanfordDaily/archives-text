# Stanford Golfers Seek PCC Crown
## 
### 
Coach Bud Finger and six Stan- |
ford golfers left for Los Angeles
Tuesday morning to play in the PCC
Southern Division championships
this weekend.
Twenty-four men, six from each
school, will tee off this morning in
the 36-hole qualifying round that

will determine the team champion
ship. The four lowest scores from
each team will be counted.
Stanford will he represented by
Ernie Kellberg, Bob Crozier, Bud
Moe, Jack Wallace, Cully Ingram,
and Dave Mitten. Mitten won the
right to take the trip south Mon

. day afternoon when he defeated
I Dick Weldon. Ralph Mills, and Lynn
i Miller over 18 holes.
The team championship is rated
| as a toss-up, although USC might
be termed a slight favorite since
j the Trojans are undefeated in eon
j ference play. However, if two of
i the Indians have hot rounds today,
I Stanford could come home with its
I sixth straight championship.
The 16 low qualifiers will play on
Friday and Saturday for the indi
vidual crown. Last year Paul Car
ter of USC defeated Ted Richards
of UCLA in the finale, 3-1, but they
have both departed from collegiate
j activities.
This year the race appears to be
| wide open with Stanford's Kellberg,
j Crozier, and Moe as definite threats.
! Don Schwab of California, Bob
i Travenick and Bob Pastore of USC,
and Dick Runkle and Ben Alyea of
j UCLA are the other first-rate pros-
I pects.
All matches will be played on
I the north course of the Los Angeles
; Country Club with UCLA as the
J host team. This will give the up
and-coming Bruins an advantage
I over the other teams.
