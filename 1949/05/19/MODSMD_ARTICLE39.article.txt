# AL BERRY
## On The Bench 
### 
This week Fve got track on my
mind, and for good reason, too. Al
though the dual meet season is
over, the frosting is still to be eaten
off this year's cinder-path sponge
cake. Friday it's the Coliseum re
lays and Saturday the Modesto dit
tos. Then comes the PCC meet in
Seattle closely followed by—wham!
—finals. But the meet I'm looking
forward to is being held in Los
Angeles one month from yesterday
—the NCAA meet: "the nationals."
I think Stanford will win that
meet—not tt» mention (lie PCC.
I can remember a time when a
statement like that would bring out
| a byd of enthusiasm somewhere
along the line. No more. Stanford
: rooters have rooted and lost for so
long now that when someone says,
"We're going to win," they say,
: "Yeah? Show me." The typical In
dian fan just can't bring himself to
! realize that the famine is at last
; over. That the day of "moral vic
tories only" is over. That we're out
of the forest. That we can and are
going to. win and win often in the
I years to come.
SC can ill give us trouble, but
we've lost to the University ol Cali
fornia for the last time in any spoi*t
: for a nice long time to come. And
this time the scoreboard backs me
up: four for four in basketball with
; Cal; two for three vs. the Jensenite
| horsehiders; and did we or did we
| not slaughter them in track?
Yep, we're coming out of the
! woods, and it is - Coach Jack Weiers
haiisei's amiable, hard - working
! bunch of trackmen who are lead
] ing the way to victory. Most Stan
ford sports fans don't seem to ap
preciate the fact that the Farm
thin-clade are not only one of the
best track teams in the conference,
1 but in the nation and the whole
darn world as well. Troy, which
has copped national championships

for some decades now, did beat us in
a dual meet by a foot, and in the
Fresno Relays by one point and the
grace ot Mel Patfon. But the PCC
L.nd the NCAA have different scor
ing systems, and more and better
competition in all events. I don't
tiiink that the very good and very
fortunate Trojan tracksters will be
able to beat the Big Red in these
two meets.
Let's look at the "nationals," to
be held in Los Angeles on the 18th
day of June.
There are six p'aces given in the
NCAA meet and these are scored
10. 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Contrary to popular
opinion there is no mile relay in
the NC2A meet, which is highly
unfortunate because it keeps Stan
ford from sewing up the meet (on
paper, anyway).
But the meet has been won with
40 points. Back in the days of Jesse
Owens, Ohio State won the meet
with 40':_> points, 40 of which were
accumulated by the great Owens
himself. Stanford next month will
make far more points than that.
The sore arm of Otis Chandler
will be in shape by that time and
he and his leammate Lew Davis
should be able to nab a tidy 18
points with the 16-pound iron ball.
This is especially true since Fuchs,
Yale's great putter, will be engaged
in final examinations at that time.
Bud Held, who won the NCAA
last year, is above and away the fa
vorite to win the javelin, although
he may be pushed. Downing INleKee
will nab at least a third (six points)
in the high hurdles, and another
McKec, Steve, will get two or four
points in the discus. So far that's
18 and 10 and six and four equals
38 points.
Which brings us to the great—
yep, great — Gaylord Bryan. Gay
can win the broad jump and—l'll
I be conservative for one minute—will
I get no worse than fourth (four
j points) in the 220. and a third in the
j low hurdles (six points). That to
! tals up to 20 points- for the Gaylord
; and 58 for Stanford.
To top it off, I think that Gay
will get more points than that—l
haven't even counted in the high
jump, which he may or may not
try. And to make it even nicer for
the home team, may I point out that
I also haven't mentioned such prob
able point-nabbers as Al Lyons (if
lie can shake that cold and ingrown
toenail) in the two-mile. Bob Bryan
in the low hurdles (his time is one
; of the best in the country this ydar),
Otis Chandler in the discus, and
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson in the
| 440.
Sixty or 70 points for Stanford
in the nationals would certainly
not he out of the question.
