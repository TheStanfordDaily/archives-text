# CIBA Baseball Swings into Home Stretch As Dave Melton Guns for Batting Crown
## 
### JOHN HALL 
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Association goes into
its final whirl this weekend with all six clubs expected to show
off their best set of horsehide habits.
The baseball boys from Bovard Field have aleady cinched their
second straight CIBA flag, but St. Mary's will invade Stanford,

Santa Clara travels to UCLA, and
Troy will meet California, just to
battle it out for their own personal
satisfaction.
To grab the top spot. USC has won
10 loop games in a row, and boasts
a string of 19 straight. Further
more the Trojans have lost only
lour CIBA games in the past two
seasonsâ€”three to Santa Clara and
one to UCLA in 27 starts.
Stanford Wins Three Series
Here in the home Sunken Dia
mond Saturday Stanford, not quite
so plush as SC. will l>e gunning
for its seventh league victory
against the cellar-stranded Gaels.
The Tribe, overlooking a dismal
southern tour which featured six
straight losses to USC and UCLA,
had better hunting against Califor
nia, St. Mary's, and Santa Clara, all
of whom have dropped series nods
to the Indians.
So, three out of five series eon-

tests make Stanford look slightly
better than its present 6-8 fourth
place CIBA standing would indicate.
Leading question of the final
weekend of play concerns the iden
tity of the gentleman who will even
tually end the season with the high
est batting average.
Batting Title in Balance
Eight now the last-minute rush is
on. with Bill Sharman (.423) of
USC, Skip Rowland (.4tXl) of UCLA.
Bob Odell (.400) of California. Tom
Kelly (.392) or Santa Clara, and
Dave Melton (.396* of Stanford still
in the running.
Dave Meltou. Stanford's candi
date for the best brute-of-basb,
will have a definite chance to take
over the top spot if he has a good
da v \ against St. Mary's.
The saucy society of left-handed
chuckers, featuring the talented trio
o! Dave Rahle. Don Pender, and Hal
Toso, will also get one more chance
to show their wares this weekend.
Stanford's Dahle will wind up the
season with an attempt to pick up
his sixth win against two defeats.
Don Pender of USC will probably
face" California. It will be Pender's
.seventh against only one defeat il
he is successful.
Southpaw Huriers in Front
Bronco Hal Toso. possibly the best
of the three, has a record of 5-1.
and should notch his sixth against
UCLA.
Harry Walter's men will have

another object in mind whfli
they take the field Saturday.
Trailing L'SC for the team batting
crown, the Cards could conceiv
ably put forth enough of a blast
against the Gaels to hoist their
percentages past the champs.


CHARLIE COLE. Indian center
fielder, led the Stanford horse
hiders to a 7 to 5 victory over
St. Mary's Tuesday afternoon at
Moraga. Cole added to his usual
good Held game by belting a
home run.
