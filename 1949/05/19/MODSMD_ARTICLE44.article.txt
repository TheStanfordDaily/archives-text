## 
### 
The California Relays, to be held ;
! Saturday at Modesto, will hold a 1
! lot of interest for the sports fans
j this weekend as Stanford and other
! PCC teams enter the last big meet
before the PCC meet the following
weekend.
Ovrshadowed by the Coliseum
i Relays and their great array of
' stars, the California Relays are nev
] ertheless important as an indication
of how the respective teams will
fare in the PCC meet. The winner
| of the relays will hold the inside
track on the championship when the
teams meet up north.
Stanford will send a full team to
the California Relays and the other
| conference team will be in there
! with full squads too. The Cards will
send only a nine-man delegation to
1 the Coliseum tussle, but those nine
will be in tough company.

Patton, and other Olympic greats
among the list of competitors, the
I Coliseum Relays are tabbed as one
| of the greatest meets of the year.
I The following day the Indians get
another crack at USC. Stanford
i and the Trojans seem to be the
! odds-on choice as favorites for the
PCC championship. Who will emerge
on top in the northern meet is still
I a matter of speculation, but the
| showing the two teams make this
Saturday shou'.d give a hint as to
| which team will win.
The California Relays are run on
much the same idea as the Fresno

Relays, with the 100-yarcl clash, the
1 high hurdles, and all of the field
j events in addition to numerous re
lay races.

! close, the California Relays prob
ably will be a nip-and-tuck affair.

bus to Modesto Saturday morning,
; while the nine men who are going
I to the Coliseum Relays will fly up
on Saturday.
Cards competing in the Coliseum
