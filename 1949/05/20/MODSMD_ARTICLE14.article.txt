# Foreign Scholarship Com Names Six Students for Fall
## 
### 
Six foreign students have been |
selected to come to Stanford next
year under the foreign scholarship
plan.
They represent six nations and
several fields of study, but all of
them have been outstanding as stu
dent leaders in their own univer
sities.
The six, with their home countries,
majors, and residences for their
three quarters here, are:
Bent Pontoppidan, Denmark, in
ternational law. Alpha Sigma Phi, ;
Alpha Kappa Lambda, Beta Theta
Pi.
Flit/. Margulics, Germany, polit
ical and social sciences. Sigma Nu,
Phi Delta Theta, Alpha Sigma Phi.
Philippe Berlhet, Fiance, econom
ics. Beta Theta Pi. Theta Xi, Alpha
Kappa Lambda.
Gottfried Kindermann, Austria,
political science. Alpha Tau Omega.
Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon.
The two women chosen are:
Fotini Kaplauidou, Greece, educa
tion. Lagunita, all three quarters.
Ranveigh Drewry, Norway, social
psychology and sociology. Hurlburt,
and two other women's Row resi
dences not yet chosen.
Tuiton for these students is being
paid jointly by the administration
and the student body. In addition,
the ASSU pays for books, part of â– 
their expense money, and their
cross-country transportation.
The houses in which the students
live pay their room and board and

in some cases their expense money.
In addition, it is hoped that the
United States government, through
the Fulbright Act, will pay for their
ocean transportation.
As a sort of iollow-up to the for
eign scholarship plan, Frank WolfT
has announced the possibility of an
exchange student being sent to
France.
The French ambassador has en
couraged the idea under which the
French government would provide
all school expenses for one year for
a Stanford student. Only cost not
covered would be transportation.
Wolff has asked that all students
interested in such an exchange meet
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 in the
lIR Office (in the Quad Shack). As
yet, the only qualification is a good
knowledge of French.
