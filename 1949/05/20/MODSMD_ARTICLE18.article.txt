## No Violators on Council 
### 
Wednesday Excom turned down an ASSU constitutional by-law
that would have made students ineligible for student body of
fices if they had been convicted in the past of Honor Code in
fractions or of misusing an ASSU office.
The proposal had been tabled, wisely enough, from last week
in order to give Excom members time to consider the measure
more thoroughly. It came up too close to the final elections to
allow each representative to get a clear perspective of the issue.
When the motion was brought up again this week, it was
amended to read that only students convicted of misusing their
office should be banned from future ASSU positions.
The Daily editor suggested that Excom consider whether stu
dents convicted of Honor Code violations should be prevented
from running for Men's and Women's Council positions.
Excom defeated the by-law because the members felt that once
a student had been punished for an infraction, his past should
not be considered, nor should his future be darkened by bringing
up old chestnuts.
We agree with this reasoning (with the exception of Men's
and Women's Councils), and The Daily followed it during the
recent elections when one of the candidates for an ASSU posi
tion was not revealed in this column for having been convicted
for misusing an ASSU post.
However, we take this opportunity to point out what did hap
pen 18 years ago when a former two-time Honor Code violator
did run for a Men's Council position.
The Daily carried a front-page editorial warning student voters
to consider all the Men's Council candidates before they voted.
No mention of the student's name was made, no were there any
hints as to his identity.
Stanford was sparsely populated in 1931, someone talked, and
most of the voters knew the identity of the candidate described
in the editorial, one of the associate editors at that time told us
yesterday.
The man was soundly defeated. That brings us down to the
present day.
At the Excom meeting this week, the group was asked whether
Honor Code violators should hold Men's and Women's Councils
positions. The precedent for possible action is given in the above
1931 example.
Although convicted Honor Code violators rarely run for one
of the councils, we feel that a by-law should be put in the ASSU
Constitution that will prevent such action. Quoting the May 12,
1931, editorial:
"It is vitally important that the men selected for the Council
work earnestly and honestly for the vigorous enforcement of
the (Honor) Code.
"A .... student is today a candidate for (Men's Council)â€”
v/hose duty it is to enforce the Code he refused to observe.
"What can be the attitude towards enforcement of a man who
has twice been convicted of violating the Honor Code? Will he
favor the sentencing of other students for cheating as he cheated?
Will he approve of punishing them with three quarters' suspen
sion on the first conviction and permanent expulsion on second
.... under the recent policy announced by a joint session of
Men's and Women's Councils?"
