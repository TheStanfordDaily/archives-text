Re: American Women
Tell me, pretty maiden, what is the secret of your success? From
morning 'til night you are the apple of the male eye, the cream in his
coffee, the spice in his life. From Bull Session to editorials, they cannot
resist you. Ninety per cent of American literature is lavished on your
female distractions. I would like to take your secret back to Europe with
me next year—we're jealous of the attention you receive.
