# SC Students Vote Today On Election Referendum
## Senate Refuses to Accept Petitions; Daily Trojan Accused of Prejudice 
### 
University of Southern California
students will complete their voting
today on a student body referendum j
questioning the validity of last I
week's election results. The refer- 1
endum asks:
"Shall the senate action which ap- 1
proved the report of the elections ;
commission on the results of the re
cent ASSC election for ASSC presi- j
dent be reversed?"
Wednesday the senate refused pe
titions to hold the new elections at i
the same time on the grounds that
President-elect Ed Vierheilig's repu
tation had been compromised by ad
verse publicity.
The students began voting on the
referendum Wednesday. Voters j
were warned in a full-page eight
column Daily Trojan advertisement
to consider both sides of the ques- j
tion and then vote against the ref
erendum because:
1. "... . the Daily Trojan . ... in
the past week has openly misrepre
sented the facts in order to sway
. . . . opinion."
2. "There has been no real at
tempt to prove the charges of fraud." j
3. ". . . . the defeated Unity Par- 1
ty is contesting only the office of J
president despite the fact that if

fraud existed, all (seven) officers
would also be l'raudentlv elected."
4. ". . . . supporters of Ed Vier
heilig have been .... denied the
chance to present fairly these facts
to the student body "
Monday afternoon the ASSC sen
ate interpreted the referendum pe
tions to mean "recall" and set
Wednesday, yesterday, and today
for a special recall election of Vier
heilig. A recall election would have
required a two-thirds majority to
unseat an officer, while a referen
dum requires only a simple majority.
At the same meeting Monday, the
senate also voted to extend the cam
paign expense limitation from 545 to
$500.
Grafton Tanquarv protested that
"it is impossible to recall the man.
He is not in office."
Tuesday, Student Body President
Johnny Davis changed his opinion
about the meaning of the petitions
and thus gave the referendum side
a bare 14 to 13 majority.
A total of 6,500 signatures had
been turned in to the USC senate on
two petitions. They were based,
principally, on three charges:
!. Four hundred three ballots
could not be accounted for. and they
possibly could have changed the
election results.
2. There were about 1&4 more stu
dent identification cards punched
than there were votes cast.
3. At least 30 identification cards
were punched twice, thus indicating
the bearer voted twice.
