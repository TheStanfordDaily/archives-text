# Movie Titles Worked Over For Attraction

### HOWARD C. HEYN 
HOLLYWOOD, May 19 <4 5 ) —
Strange are the ways of the men
! who title movies. Even so, there is
j no support for the theory that these
; boys served apprenticeships naming
railway coaches.
A picture first called, say, "Quiet
j Pastures" is liable to turn up on
j the screen with a tag like "Samantha
( Steps Out." To the movie-goer, if
he knows about the switch, this may
| look pretty silly. Very often it is.
But the idea behind this jittery
! juggling makes some sense, even
! when the fifth and final title doesn't.
A "hypied" title is boxoffice bait.
Even more devious is the process
| of retitling films for foreign distri
| bution. Biggest headaches, usually,
are phrases popular in the United
States but meaningless elsewhere,
j "Mexican Hayride" was renamed
I for that country on the assumption,
no doubt, that hayrides are a nordic
custom. The picture became "Sangre
j y Farina ("Blood and Flour"), a
j comic takeoff (the studio hoped) on
the famous "Sangre y Arena"
' ("Blood and Sand").
"Family Honeymoon" became
] "Luna Sin Miel" ("Moon Without
Honey") for Latin Americans. In
I Spanish "Honeymoon" is "Luna de
i Miel"—"Moon of Honey." With the
| family along, however, "Honey
moon" usually becomes "Moon
Without Honey" ("Luna Sin Miel"),
a play on words designed to delight
| and lure the Latins.
"The Life of Riley" almost threw
! the titlers for a loss. The Spanish
! title was changed three times—from
I "Dicha sin Prescio" ("Happiness
j Without Price") to "Viva la Vida"
("Long Live Life") and finally to
I "Vida de Principe" ("Life of a
j Prince") a far cry from the Ameri
! can Riley.
"Yes Sir, That's My Baby" wound
up, rather startlingly, as "A Vida de
Solteiro e Boa" ("The Life of a
Bachelor Is Good") in Portuguese
i speaking countries.
But the real stickler was "Ma and
1 Kettle." The studio released its Por
| tuguese version as "Nem Tudo e
Ouro" ("All Is Not Gold that Glit—
: ters"). But the Spanish titlers, hav
ing discarded "Senor y Senora Cal
dera" ("Mr. and Mrs. Boiler") are
still stumped, at this' writing.

HOLLYWOOD, May 19 <4 5 ) —
Strange are the ways of the men
! who title movies. Even so, there is
j no support for the theory that these
; boys served apprenticeships naming
railway coaches.
A picture first called, say, "Quiet
j Pastures" is liable to turn up on
j the screen with a tag like "Samantha
( Steps Out." To the movie-goer, if
he knows about the switch, this may
| look pretty silly. Very often it is.
But the idea behind this jittery
! juggling makes some sense, even
! when the fifth and final title doesn't.
A "hypied" title is boxoffice bait.
Even more devious is the process
| of retitling films for foreign distri
| bution. Biggest headaches, usually,
are phrases popular in the United
States but meaningless elsewhere,
j "Mexican Hayride" was renamed
I for that country on the assumption,
no doubt, that hayrides are a nordic
custom. The picture became "Sangre
j y Farina ("Blood and Flour"), a
j comic takeoff (the studio hoped) on
the famous "Sangre y Arena"
' ("Blood and Sand").
"Family Honeymoon" became
] "Luna Sin Miel" ("Moon Without
Honey") for Latin Americans. In
I Spanish "Honeymoon" is "Luna de
i Miel"—"Moon of Honey." With the
| family along, however, "Honey
moon" usually becomes "Moon
Without Honey" ("Luna Sin Miel"),
a play on words designed to delight
| and lure the Latins.
"The Life of Riley" almost threw
! the titlers for a loss. The Spanish
! title was changed three times—from
I "Dicha sin Prescio" ("Happiness
j Without Price") to "Viva la Vida"
("Long Live Life") and finally to
I "Vida de Principe" ("Life of a
j Prince") a far cry from the Ameri
! can Riley.
"Yes Sir, That's My Baby" wound
up, rather startlingly, as "A Vida de
Solteiro e Boa" ("The Life of a
Bachelor Is Good") in Portuguese
i speaking countries.
But the real stickler was "Ma and
1 Kettle." The studio released its Por
| tuguese version as "Nem Tudo e
Ouro" ("All Is Not Gold that Glit—
: ters"). But the Spanish titlers, hav
ing discarded "Senor y Senora Cal
dera" ("Mr. and Mrs. Boiler") are
still stumped, at this' writing.
