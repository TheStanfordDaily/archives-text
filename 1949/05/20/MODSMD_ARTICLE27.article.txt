A man may understand the theory
of the atom and believe in the
fourth dimension —but he still re
fuses to walk under a ladder or let
a black cat cross his path.
Actually it's not bad luck to have
a black cat follow you, unless you're
a mouse, that is.
Superstition, like other beliefs in
magic, is at its bottom an attempt
to cushion ourselves from the pain
ful fact that we so often don't know
the why of things that happen and
so find it impossible to control or
avert them.
The majority of these superstitions
are based on a childish sense of
similarity between things which ac
tually have no relation to each other
whatsoever — like the landlubber
whistling on shipboard. Because the
gale whistles through the rigging it
is considered bad luck to whistle
. ... it might bring on a gale.
A person may carry a horse
chestnut in his pocket as a cure for
rheumatism. Since he knows of no
real cure for this ailment, he feels
that it is better to do something than
to do nothing.
The girl who darkens her eye
lashes with mascara is following an
ancient superstition used by primi
tives to ward off the "evil eye"
. . . . Earrings were first worn as an
amulet to bring good luck
The throwing of rice at a wedding
comes from the ancient Hindu and
Chinese religious rituals which be
lieved rice to be the symbol of fer
tility.
Even the triangular scarf worn by
gals in the rain, etc., dates back to
an ancient style based on the belief
that the triangle was a mystic sym
bol to ward off evil spirits.
The ancients even believed that
the hair often harbored evil spirits
—thus the phrase "He gets in my
hair," 1 suppose.
There are no more superstitious
people in the world than athletes,
professional or otherwise. If a ball
player gets a hit with a broken bat,
he'll use that bat until it can't be
used anymore.
Paul Corteau, the rugged center
of the Providence Reds hockey team
of a couple seasons ago, has a pet
superstition. He has a specially
built pocket in his thigh pads where
he keeps a collection of pennies.
The pennies he gets from his wife,
one before each game. They bring
him luck. He was one of the
leagues' highest scorers. Can you

argue with that?
Pitcher Lou Brissie still wears a
tattered sweatshirt he donned when
he joined the A s, and says he s going

the "devil's dozen."
But during all the years Hec Ed
mundson coached the University of
Washington basketball teams his
pet superstition was that his teams
always appeared exactly 13 minutes
before the starting whistle. Which
shows the perversity in superstition.
Sometimes things happen that
make you wonder, though. Take the
case of Robert Steiwer. He served
in the Merchant Marine. He was
paid off on one ship March 13, 1943.
and a month later (April 13) he
signed on another. On. Friday, Aug 7
ust 13, this ship was torpedoed off
the Spanish coast and he spent 13
days in the hospital.
Returning to the States he was as
signed to another ship. When he
learned the crew was signing or
ders on January 13 he asked for re
placement and signed on a different
ship. One year later (Jan. 13, 1943)
the ship he had previously been as
signed to was sunk, with all hand.-
