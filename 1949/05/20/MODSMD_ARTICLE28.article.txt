### PAUL R. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
Splendid interest marked the sec
ond section of the Spring Confer
ence on Religion last Saturday
morning. A larger,* and still more
representative group was present
than came to the first section.
Discussion was free and full, it
being almost impossible to observe
the time limits because of the eager
ness of many to shave their views.
Mark Hatfield and Robert Newcomb
chaired the meeting, witk obvious
ability and fairness to all.
Nominations for membership on
the committee, which is to explore
the possibilities in religious activ
ities, were offered by the earlier
committee of 12 who had been ap
pointed by the first section.
Other nominations from the floor
were received; with the result that
the following 37 persons now com
pose the study committee:
Katiiy Adams, Jim Anderson.
Dave Bennion, Jody Broeker, Mar
celine Chartz, Mel Cherno, Joe Cu
sick, Mary Duker, Alberta Engvall.
