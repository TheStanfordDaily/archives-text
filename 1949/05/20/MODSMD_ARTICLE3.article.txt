## Dekes, Betas, Fijis Fined $200 
### 
Three Stanford fraternities have
been fined a total of $200 for viola
tions of University social regula
tions. it was announced today by
Walt Varellas, president of the In
terfratei nity Board.
Another house. Phi Kappa Psi, was
placed on social probation for dis
orderly conduct. Under terms of the
probation, the house will not be per
mitted to participate in intramural
.-ports activities or stage any social
functions. The ban will remain in
effect at least until the end of fall
quarter, the board stated.
Phi Gamma Delta was fined SIOU
and Delta Kappa Epsilon and Beta
Theta Pi were fined S3O each.
The penalty assessed against Phi
Gamma Delta resulted from an otl
campus party for which the house
did not secure ASSU permission nor
have adequate "chaperonage. The
fines levied against the Dekes and
Betas involved a party given jointly
by the houses under similar condi
tions.
The joint party was held at the
Rio del Mar Beach Club. The club's
owners reported that the club was
damaged, and the two fraiernities
were held responsible. Lack of ade
quate chaperoning, the board felt,
prevented the disorderly conduct
from being halted.
