# Quarterly Time Schedule Is Product of Headaches
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Conies the beginning of each new quarter, and where does a
roung student's fancy turn? To a time schedule, of course.
Maybe you think this timely bit of information is just a pro
essor's forgotten manuscript, but try to get along without it.
Students who think they have trouble scheduling and finding

classes should drop over to see the'
young lady whose job it is to ar
range all the classes in their proper
rooms.
Mis. Nancy Ann Files is that
young lady. Mrs. Files is known as
"the girl who handles rooms," or as
some profesors have dubbed her,
"the girl who moves classes."
Chart Of Dots
The fate of your 10 o'clock is de
termined by en enormous chart of
intriguing dots, which signify all the
general rooms on campus. Each
quarter the individual departments
prepare their programs for the fol
lowing term. These are published in
the Announcement of Courses, i nd
..re tentative. A specific copy is then
handed in for the time schedule,
which must be published before each
pre-registration period.
Most classes have no designated
room space, although all the depart
ments reserve some rooms for their
own use. It is up to Mrs. Files to
find rooms for the classes.
Unexpected Numbers
Unfortunately no one can deter
mine how many students are going
to turn out for a class, so when a
professor expects about 50 and 125
show up, the problem begins. The
professor calls up Mrs. Files and tells
her half of his class is straggling in
the halls. Mrs. Files consults her
chart of dots. There is no larger
classroom available at that time.
The phone rings again. It is an
other unhappy professor who has no
table for his seminar class, and
straight-back desks are not con
ducive to these informal discus
sions.
Phone Calls. Complaints
Thus the first week goes. Phone
call after phone call, complaints,
confusion. But with the help of the
ijiart of dots, Mrs. Files by some
miracle manages to arrange all the
classes to satisfy at least half of the
professors. Often it is necessary to
switch classes, sometime even among
three or four.
The problem of arranging classes
so that there is no conflict of having
all classes meet at the same time is
controlled by certain principles
which the Committee on Schedules
tncl Examinations has set up.
Preferred Times
Registrar H. Donald Winbigler ex
plains that if all students had classes
at the hours they wanted them and
all professors could teach at their
desired hours, 75 per cent of the
classes would be at 9, 10. and 11 a.m.
There was a time before the war
when the size of the enrollment pei -
rutted this, but with rising enroll
ment. classes had to be scheduled
from noon on.
Before Mrs. Files can make out
her chart of dots, she makes a de
tailed inspection of all classrooms,
noting the number and type of desks
(seminar classes want movable
chairs), sections of blackboard (lan
guage and math classes need a lot),
amount of light, number of windows,
projection facilities, whether the
room has any posts (some profes
sors want everybody to be able to
see them), and whether the room is
located in the basement (some fac
ulty members don't like to walk up
stairs).
