# Pledge Raid Indirectly Blamed For Mysterious ATO Sickness
## 
### JIM HAGGART 
Apaprently the ATO pledges
wrought more havoc among their
brothers when they raided the house-
Sunday night than they realized at
the time.
The results of the investigation of
the Student Health Service into the
wave of food poisoning which
spread through the ATO house fol
lowing lunch Tuesday noon, places
the blame squarely on the shoulders
of the Sunday evening marauders.
Dr. George T. Luekett, University
Health Office, announced yesterday
afternoon that the cause of the food
poisoning had been traced to a
sample of the ham which the ATOs
ate for lunch Tuesday.
Dr. Luekett theoiizes that during
their clandestine tour of the house
Sunday night the pledges blew sev
eral fuses, one of which carried the
current to the refrigerator. Monday
morning, the cook left the refrig
erator door open for about an hour
and a half to rid the ice box of

odors that had accumulated Sun
day night.
"Thus the meat was exposed to
higher temperatures for a total of
four and one-half to five hours at
least, enough time for the bacteria
to multiply," Dr. Luckett said.
Monday noon the assistant cook
ate some of the ham and hail an
attack of food poisoning about two
hours later. One other person also
ate some of the ham at this time, but
was not affected.
Tuesday noon the ham was ground
and mixed in a salad. Two to three
hours Inter about 10 of those who
ate the salad had an attack of food
poisoning, but others escaped.
"There are two possible explana
tions of the good luck of those who
were not ill," Dr. Luckett said.
"Either they may have a resistance
to this toxin, or the toxin may not
have been evenly distributed
through' the ham. That is. it is pos
sible that only a portion of the
ham was affected and that this por
tion was not mixed throughout the
whole salad."
