# Student-Faculty Exhibit Is Shown At Art Gallery
## 
### 
Tlie year s most varied and inter
esting art exhibit is row on display
at the Art Gallery. This is the an
nual Stanford student-faculty show
ing which includes paintings, sculp
ture. and commercial and architec
tural design.
Among (he bet!er oil paintings is
a color study by Robert Breer
which won the 1949 Humanities
Prize. This is completely non-rep
resentational, but the versatile Breer
also lias two entirely different types
of paintings in the show.
One is a fairly conventional wa
tercolor and the other is a semi
realistic mood study of a pa'e-faced
ffirl with dark eyes. It is done
sketchily in a dull, monotone yel
low.
Professoi La Plante
Professor John La Plante has done
two very arresting paintings. The
first is called '■Pieta.*' It is a sur
realistic representation of the dead
Christ in the arms of his mother.
n,e colors are somber but glowing;
there is a feeling of luminosity that
is almost phosphorescent. The sec
ond is called "Veneration of the
Holy Wounds." completely surreal
istic with the bright underlying
glow of stained glass.
ihe flower still life by Professor
George Leßrun is bright and bold
-md fiesh. He uses paletie knife
technique very effectively.
Joan Clay's portrait of a girl
shows an unusually strong style for
a pirl and a very distinctive tech
nique.
Watercolors
Leading the watercolors is a land
scape by Professor Mendelowitz of
rolling brown hills, partially dark
ened by an oncoming storm.
Professor Farmer's mythological
painting shows a remarkable deli
cacy of color and a wonderful feel
ing for light and space.
The two tempera abstractions by
Professor Faulkner are very well
done. The first is bright, intense;
the second subdued and architec
tural. The latter is his impression
of New York.
In the sculpture division, Guy
Cochran has clone a beautiful ab
stract torso with lovely flowing
lines. He has made the utmost use
of the grain of the wood to empha
size the lines of the figure.
Graceful Wolf
Wayne Champion's wolf is a
graceful. elongated form, very dec
orative. He has made good use of
the wood grain.
Copper tubing, copper wire, and
ply woo J shapes were combined in
five form by Ivlilton Johnson. This
hr.s solidity and a feeling of space
which combine to produce a rather
architectural effect.
Philip Yost's aluminum and wood
con .position has a nice sweeping
line with an illusion of space.
In the architecture exhibit, there
are two very modern desisns by
Arthur Sweetser and Gi lic i t Wheat
which are under consideration for
the proposed new firehou.se.

istic with the bright underlying
glow of stained glass.
ihe flower still life by Professor
George Leßrun is bright and bold
-md fiesh. He uses paletie knife
technique very effectively.
Joan Clay's portrait of a girl
shows an unusually strong style for
a pirl and a very distinctive tech
nique.
Watercolors
Leading the watercolors is a land
scape by Professor Mendelowitz of
rolling brown hills, partially dark
ened by an oncoming storm.
Professor Farmer's mythological
painting shows a remarkable deli
cacy of color and a wonderful feel
ing for light and space.
The two tempera abstractions by
Professor Faulkner are very well
done. The first is bright, intense;
the second subdued and architec
tural. The latter is his impression
of New York.
In the sculpture division, Guy
Cochran has clone a beautiful ab
stract torso with lovely flowing
lines. He has made the utmost use
of the grain of the wood to empha
size the lines of the figure.
Graceful Wolf
Wayne Champion's wolf is a
graceful. elongated form, very dec
orative. He has made good use of
the wood grain.
Copper tubing, copper wire, and
ply woo J shapes were combined in
five form by Ivlilton Johnson. This
hr.s solidity and a feeling of space
which combine to produce a rather
architectural effect.
Philip Yost's aluminum and wood
con .position has a nice sweeping
line with an illusion of space.
In the architecture exhibit, there
are two very modern desisns by
Arthur Sweetser and Gi lic i t Wheat
which are under consideration for
the proposed new firehou.se.
Tlie year s most varied and inter

ing which includes paintings, sculp
ture. and commercial and architec
tural design.
Among (he bet!er oil paintings is
a color study by Robert Breer
which won the 1949 Humanities
Prize. This is completely non-rep
resentational, but the versatile Breer
also lias two entirely different types
of paintings in the show.
One is a fairly conventional wa
tercolor and the other is a semi
realistic mood study of a pa'e-faced
ffirl with dark eyes. It is done
sketchily in a dull, monotone yel
low.
Professoi La Plante
Professor John La Plante has done
two very arresting paintings. The
first is called '■Pieta.*' It is a sur
realistic representation of the dead
Christ in the arms of his mother.
n,e colors are somber but glowing;
there is a feeling of luminosity that
is almost phosphorescent. The sec
ond is called "Veneration of the
Holy Wounds." completely surreal
istic with the bright underlying
glow of stained glass.
