# Lehmann Concert Acclaimed
## 
### 
Lotte Lehmann completely won
the audience Memorial Auditorium j
last evening. Her recital of world
famous lieder songs was accom
plished with mature, polished skill,
achieving the highest levels of in
terpretive art.
The program was carefully ar
ranged to accentuate the full per- ,
fection and appeal of her voice.
Pleasantly light pieces by Mozart,
and Schubert opened the concert. :
Her renditions of Schumann in the
portion were softly compelling, and
seemed to wholly reveal the inner
i essence of the music.
TTi>e selections of French lieder
were hauntingly peaceful, sung with

the supple control and radiance for !
which Mme. Lehmann is known.
She completed her performance with I
four compositions by Strauss, given j
with dramatic power and poignancy. '
Mme. Lehmann was particularly
captivating with her projection of
direct intimacy in the 'Wozu noch ;
Madchen" by Strauss. "Infidelite |
by Hahn was superlatively graceful 1
and enchanting. Her first encore.!
"Dor J uncling an der Quelle," was
rr.o.-t enthusiastically received, as ,
were the others, "Si les vers avaient ;
les ailes," "Morgen" by Strauss, and j
her only number in English, "She
Never Told Her Lover" by Haydn, j
