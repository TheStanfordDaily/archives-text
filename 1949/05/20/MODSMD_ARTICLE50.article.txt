# New Metallurgy Building To House Spectrograph
## 
### 
Using only one wall and a ceiling, the construction firm of
Wagner and Martinez is changing the Mining and Metallurgy
shop from a U-shaped building to a rectangle.
A 530.000 addition to the building should be completed within
a month. It will provide the School of Mineral Sciences with

♦■classrooms and laboratory space for
i three long-range projects.
Even stranger than the unique
builcjing method, to the layman, is
the maze of the school's equipment.
Now pressing workers for elbow
room, much ol it will soon be moved
into the new quarters.
fright in the middle of a crowded
laboratory, with a sheet tossed over
it to protect it from dust, stands the
school's newest "baby." It is a $20.-
000 piece of precision equipment
1 called a spectrograph.
Uses of Spectrographs
The graph Is being used in experi
ments directed by Fred L. Hum
phrey, instructor in mining.
One of the lab assistants explained
what the spectrograph can do. A
| sample of ore is put into one of the
bulky metal units. It is kept there
lor minutes or for days. During this
time the machine takes a "picture''
of the ore. (Actually a picture of
radiations given off by the ore's
burning.) The film is developed.
Next it goes to another, smaller unit.
This one is tagged a "micropho
tometer."
Looking at the ore's picture in this
machine is like watching a green
television screen. A wavy line ap
pears on the green glass screen,
| while the image of a dial spins and
i wavers.
Minute Detections
By using this modern process, an
; experimenter can detect minute
amounts of each element in the sam
ple of ore. the lab men explained. It
is much quicker than standard
chemical analysis. It uncovers ele
ments which cannot be found at ail
in chemical analysis.
A special dust-free room will be
included in the addition to
house the spectrograph.
The main part of the new addi
tion will be a large laboratory. Into
this lab will go the school's five
"stress-rupture" units, being used in
a Navy-financed project. An orig
inal idea, and the only one? of their
kind in the country, they were con
ceived and built at Stanford under
the direction of Orson C. Shepard,
professor of mining and metallurgy.
Equipment Is Simple
This equipment looks simple
enough. Each unit looks like a
heavy, black, five-gallon can slipped
over a pole. In each "can," metals
are put under great stress and high
temperatures. Then the effects of
different gases on the metals aie
measured.
Similar to these units ire box-like
instruments used in a $30,000 a year
General Electric project, also di
' rccted by Mr. Shepard. They tell
what effect molten lead alloys have
on steel.
Included in the new. University
financed addition will be a small
study room and a lecture room. As
well, the present building will be
remodeled to give more office space.
