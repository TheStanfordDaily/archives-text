# Heavily Favored Trojans Take On Card Racketmen
## 
### DAN WINSTON 
The Stanford tennis team, which
despite losses is rated among the
first 10 in the nation, will meet that
evil genie from the Southland. USC,
on the Farm courts Saturday at 1:30.
Although the Cards are a well
rated team, USC is probably sec
ond only to USF in college tennis,
so the Trojans will be heavily fa
vored.
In their first meeting of the sea
son, the Cards came out on the short
end of a 9 to 0 count. In any other
conference but the PCC. the Indians
could probably win consistently, but
when the likes of Perez, Sal, and
Clark lead the legions from Troy,
the victory column does not mount
up very fast.
Although they will be the under
dogs the Cards hope to gain some
measure of revenge on USC. With
tho advantage of the home courts
the Indians could put up a much
closer match than they did before.
Coach Bugge will send a revised
lineup into the fray Saturday. A
series oi challenge matches were
played this week and Kirkc Mechem
moved back up to the first singles
spot while Errol Lycette grabbed
the third singles place.
Mechem has started to round into
form finally. Kirke has been hitting
the books too hard most of the quar

ter to concentrate much on tennis,
and only recently has he begun to
look like the player he was last year.
The fastest rising tennis star on
the Stanford team is Errol Lycette.
Errol has shown tremendous im
provement over his early season play
and has moved up steadily from
Saturday to Saturday to the third
place rank in singles.
Both Bob and Fred Lewis have
been playing better in the past cou
ple of weeks, and their doubles play
lias earned them the No. 1 doubles
post Saturday.
Lucien Barbour will play his usual
steady game unless the heavens fall
Saturday. Lucien is no flashy player
but he has a habit of wearing the
other fellow down with well placed
slice shots.
To round out the team. Vince
Schmeider will match his improving
game against the sixth singles man
from Trojanland. Vince has picked
up his game and now pushes Bar
bour for the filth spot in the sin
gles lineup.
The lineup for Saturday's match:
Singles—l. Kirke Mechem, 2. Bob

closer match than they did before.
Coach Bugge will send a revised
lineup into the fray Saturday. A
series oi challenge matches were
played this week and Kirkc Mechem
moved back up to the first singles
spot while Errol Lycette grabbed
the third singles place.
Mechem has started to round into
form finally. Kirke has been hitting
the books too hard most of the quar

ter to concentrate much on tennis,
and only recently has he begun to
look like the player he was last year.
The fastest rising tennis star on
the Stanford team is Errol Lycette.
Errol has shown tremendous im
provement over his early season play
and has moved up steadily from
Saturday to Saturday to the third
place rank in singles.
Both Bob and Fred Lewis have
been playing better in the past cou
ple of weeks, and their doubles play
lias earned them the No. 1 doubles
post Saturday.
Lucien Barbour will play his usual
steady game unless the heavens fall
Saturday. Lucien is no flashy player
but he has a habit of wearing the
other fellow down with well placed
slice shots.
To round out the team. Vince
Schmeider will match his improving
game against the sixth singles man
from Trojanland. Vince has picked
up his game and now pushes Bar
bour for the filth spot in the sin
gles lineup.
The lineup for Saturday's match:
Singles—l. Kirke Mechem, 2. Bob
Lewis, 3. Errol Lycette, 4. Fred
Lewis, 5. Lucien Barbour. 6. Vince
Schmeider.
Doubles—l. R. Lewis-F. Lewis, 2.
K. Mechem-R. Forbes, 3. E. Lycette-
L. Barbour.
The Stanford tennis team, which
despite losses is rated among the
first 10 in the nation, will meet that
evil genie from the Southland. USC,
on the Farm courts Saturday at 1:30.
Although the Cards are a well
rated team, USC is probably sec
ond only to USF in college tennis,
so the Trojans will be heavily fa
vored.
In their first meeting of the sea
son, the Cards came out on the short
end of a 9 to 0 count. In any other
conference but the PCC. the Indians
could probably win consistently, but
when the likes of Perez, Sal, and
Clark lead the legions from Troy,
the victory column does not mount
up very fast.
Although they will be the under
dogs the Cards hope to gain some
measure of revenge on USC. With
tho advantage of the home courts
the Indians could put up a much
closer match than they did before.
