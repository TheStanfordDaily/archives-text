My esteemed contemporary, A 1
Berry, creator of On The Bench ancl
usually a pretty normal guy, must
have been hit in the head with too
many raindrops. Or perhaps he fell
out of the proverbial apple tree.
But whatever happened. Berry
yesterday hatched such a fantastic
plot for a Stanford victory in the
NCAA finals, that I hastened to my
old psychology book to see just ex
â–  actly which historic malady he had
1 acquired.
It was immediately apparent that
he had fallen into a schizophrenic
state with prominent symptoms of
delusions of grandeur. The point is.
I don't think Stanford will run up 70
points in the Nationals. I don't think
Stanford will hit GO points. In fact,
it's going to be a tight pull at 50
points.
It will be nice to be wrong if so,
but with all due respects to the fine
Stanford cinder squad, a national
title just doesn't seem to be in the
offing.
Berry is counting on best per
formances from Otis Chandler and
Gay Bryan, both of whom hit their
peak in the UCLA meet and haven't
matched those efforts since. As one
of the last two outings, Bryan hasn't
jumped far enough to even place in
the bigtime.
But don't get me wrong. That
doesn't mean he won't be back on
top in the nationals. His best jump
ing would turn the trick. And Chan
dler could well be back in his 5G
ft. :! i in. UCLA form.
But it doesn't figure. We've put
Stanford on the spot time and time
again with these fanciful and opti
mistic predictions, and every time
we've ended up out on the limb with
the whole damn tree going down.
This time out I'm sticking with the
form chart, and men, that doesn't
include any openings for A 1 Lyons.
Downing McKee, Steve McKee, Bob
Bryan, or Otis Chandler in the dis
cus. Still, like the wise man said, it
could happen.
