# Hayniemen Defend PCC Swim Crown In LA Today
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
One more Stanford team will at
tempt to crack the curse of the ter
rible Trojan when Tom Haynie's
Card swimmers hit the waters of
the USC pool today and tomorrow
in the annu'.a Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet.
The villainous men from Troy
have been cast in the favorites'
role for the two-day splash spec
tacle; and thus far this has not been
the year for Stanford upsets over
USC.
Nevertheless, meantor Havnie
will hit the southern trail today
with a tank crew that is second to
few, and which is definitely not
out of contention in tlve quest for
its fourth consecutive conference
crown.
In any event, the meet will defi
nitely be a two-team affair, with
neither California's Golden Bears
nor their Westwood cousins expect
ed to claim any more than a token
share of the points,
The medley race is one of the big
question marks of the meet. It is
not a regular feature in dual meets,
and very little is known about the

potentialities of the various lads
who will compete. While Wolf is
expected to take first place, the re
maining four positions remain wide
open.
The Indian hopes for a successful
title defense reside for the most part
on the shoulders of the same lads
who have led the Farm fishmen to
their but-once-blemished season's
record. Only hard-luck Ralph Sala.
who finally licked a scholastic in
eligibility only to be sidelined by a
water - fight - incurred arm injury,
will be missing from the Card front
rank.
Co - captains Woody Hoogs and
Don Hester, dashman and breast
stroker respectively, will lead the
Stanford contingent; Harry Bor
chers will paddle the century
sprint; Marsh Pearlman backs up
Hester in the breast; Jack and Don
Weeden should both place in the
backstroke; Hub Stokely, Johnny
Mowatt. Bill Millard, and Rod Mead
form the Indian distance crew; Jim
Bradshaw and Karl Herrmann will
do the diving; and Jack Weeden
and Mead will enter the enigmatic
individual medley affair.
