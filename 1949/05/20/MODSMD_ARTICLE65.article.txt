# Indians End CIBA Season Tomorrow
## Dahle to Pitch Last Season Game Against St. Mary's 
### JOHN HALL 
Lefty Dave Dahle, Stanford's
winningest pitch - boy, will be on
the hill tomorrow when the Cards
close the door on the 1949 CIBA
season with a homey horseside bat
tle against St. Mary's hapless Gaels.
First pitch is set for 3:15 and ad
mission is tree for the fans who
wish to see the old Sunken Dia
mond fold up its tent for the year.
Stanford, resting in fourth place

with a 6-8 record, will be out to
make it three straight over the
Gaels who are struggling along with
a shaky 3 wins and 10 losses.
Against the hitless boys from
Moraga, the Indians should notch
CIBA win number seven without
too much strain.
Dahle Missed No-Hitter
Last time to the post the Gaels
made it a close 7-5 decision, but be
fore that Stanford romped to an 8-0
Win that was as easy to take as Ava
Gardner.
That 8-0 affair was the contest
in which Lefty Dahle tossed no-hit
ball until he had the fans breathing
hard in the ninth, only to lose it
when Bill Denehee singled to left
field.
Three Stanford seniors will play
their last game tomorrow, as Bill
Arce, Bob Nava, and Ray Winter
halter will call it a day.
Captain Arce, for three seasons a
steady guardian of the hot corner,
will end his career with a deter
mined effort to break the hallowed
circle of .300 hitters.
Since coming to Stanford, third
sucker Arce has never slipped be
low the 1.-for-three bracket, but an
early-season slump is going to make
it close this season. However, Bill
has pumped out 5 hits in his last
10 trips to the plate, and if his war
club is .still loose Saturday he
should climb right back into the
club,
Canfleld Is Gael Choice
ElaSting Bob Nava. one of tho
hardest hitters in the loop, and
fancy fielding Ray Winterhalter will
also be putting on the gas tomorrow
in their collegiate finales.
Scheduled to toss for the Gaels is
Carroll Canfield, a 1-5 chucker
who is much better than his dismal
record indicates. If his batsmen
could give him a little push. Can
field would be one of the league's
top hurlers.
Dahle Tosses for Perfection
Most dangerous, in fact about the

Shortstop Dave Me'ton will also
be out for more than just mother
win, as he will be eager to fatten his
only clubber the Gaels own, is
Billy Brown, the Moraga catcher,
who is swatting at a .341 pace.
Other than that, Dave Dahle
should be having a sol't afternoon
against the . 195 team batting Gaels.
It's not very probable that Dahle
will be back gunning for another
fling at a perfect effort, but you

never can tell.

Lefty Dave Dahle, Stanford's
winningest pitch - boy, will be on
the hill tomorrow when the Cards
close the door on the 1949 CIBA
season with a homey horseside bat
tle against St. Mary's hapless Gaels.
First pitch is set for 3:15 and ad
mission is tree for the fans who
wish to see the old Sunken Dia
mond fold up its tent for the year.
Stanford, resting in fourth place

with a 6-8 record, will be out to
make it three straight over the
Gaels who are struggling along with
a shaky 3 wins and 10 losses.
Against the hitless boys from
Moraga, the Indians should notch
CIBA win number seven without

Dahle Missed No-Hitter
Last time to the post the Gaels
made it a close 7-5 decision, but be
fore that Stanford romped to an 8-0
Win that was as easy to take as Ava
Gardner.

in which Lefty Dahle tossed no-hit
ball until he had the fans breathing
hard in the ninth, only to lose it
when Bill Denehee singled to left
field.

their last game tomorrow, as Bill
Arce, Bob Nava, and Ray Winter

will end his career with a deter

circle of .300 hitters.
