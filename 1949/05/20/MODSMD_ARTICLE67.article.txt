### 
A smooth-working nine from San
Mateo Junior College, possibly the
finest JC ball club in the state, were
pressed all the way by Stanford's
freshman horsehicers yesterday af
ternoon before edging the Card
babes 2-1 on the local freshman
diamond.
The game was the rubber tilt of a
three-game series between the two
squads this year. San Mateo, win
ner of the southern division of the
Northern California Junior College
Confidence, meets Placer JC tomor
row lor the conference champion
ship.
Frank Hamilton worked the en
tire distance for the yearlings in
yesterday's contest and allowed but
three hits while so doing.
Tlie Farm l'rosh, meanwhile, were
also able to pick up only three
base-knocks off the combined offer
ings of three San Mateo tossers,
scoring their only run in the fifth
when Don Simpson singled, stole
second, was sacrificed to third on a
bunt by Hamilton, and came home
on Dan Sullivan's timely rap to left
field.
The junior collegians broke the
ice with a run in the first, then
sewed it up with another marker in
the third frame.
Tomorrow Everett Dean's '52
s'uggers will clash with Santa
Clara's yearling crew at Santa
Clara.
Fireballer Roger Ossenbaugh is
slated to do the hurling for the
Farm lads, with Dick Corzine
receiving Ossenbaugh's steaming
slants behind the platter.
Jo!tin Jim Walsh will handle the
first-base chores, shortstop Larry
Peterson and second - sacker Don
Simpson make up the Babe's ster
ling keystone combination, with re
liable Bruce Iverson rounding out
the infield at the hot corner.
Patrolling the outer gardens will
be the hard-slugging trio of Dan
Sullivan in left, Tony Stellar in
center, and Ned Hutchinson in right.
