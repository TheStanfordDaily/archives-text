# No Frosh In Village Next Year
## 
### 
All new freshman men will be
housed on campus next year, 500
in Encina and 116 in Toyon Hali,
it was announced yesterday by
Shelton Beatty, chief men's coun
selor.
The plan marks a change from
the policy which has been carried
out in recent years, when freshmen
who could not be housed at Encina
lived and ate at the Village.
Beatty pointed out that the new
plan, which calls for freshmen to
live in the Toyon wing nearest En -
cina, will permit all freshmen to
eat together in Encina Commons.
One hundred and sixty - four
upper division students and some
sophomores—with present residents
receiving preference—will also live
in Toyon. These men will have the
choice of eating at Encina Com
mons or elsewhere.
The eating club quotas for room.'!
in Toyon will not be affected by
the new arrangement, explained
Dan Stone, men's housing commit -
tee chairman. The original quota.;
will l>e fulfilled.
It was also announced by Beatty
that Stern Hall, which will house
228 undergraduate students, will bo
ready for occupancy by autumn
quarter. Stern residents will eat in
the hall's four dining rooms, which
will feature cafeteria service.
However, if the dining rooms are
not ready—and there is some doubt
that they will be completed before
winter quarter—Stern residents will
eat in Encina Commons, Beatty
said.
