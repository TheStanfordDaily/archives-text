# Foreign Student Welcome Planned
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Next September some 30 or
40 students will arrive at Stan
ford after having traveled many
thousands of miles. For many,
the Farm will be their intro
duction to the United States.
These students will be unac
quainted with the many systems and
objects that most American stu
dents take for granted. The Ameri
can currency will be new to them;
the local transportation system may
be different from that of their own
countries; dial telephones may pre
sent a confusing problem.
On campus they will, meet the
maze of difficulties that confronts
all new students—housing, registra
tion. the unit system, extracurricular
clubs and activities, and the geog
raphy of the Quad and the whole
campus.
Cardinals and the lIR have, with
YViliard Waterous. Assistant Coun
selor for Men, worked out a pro
gram whereby individual students
already enrolled at Stanford would
act as host for each new student

from abroad. The hosts would help
by meeting the newcomer upon ar
rival if possible, and by serving as
fuide and adviser during his first
days on campus.
mis past year this "orientation"
procedure was carried out by Wa
terous alone, but the number of for
eign students who arrive fall quar
ter is too large for one person to
handle adequately. Cardinals and
lIK feel that if each student has his
personal host, it will be easier for
him to become acquainted with the
new situations and systems he. will
meet when he arrives.
Dorothy Winter, representative
from the lIR, stressed that this pro

j gram should Ik> an especially good
! opportunity for those who have
I traveled abroad or who plan to do
J so, to meet and become good friends
with at least one person from a for
eign nation —perhaps from the coun
try visited.
Students interested in acting as
hosts and hostesses to the students
from abroad next fall will be inter
viewed this week. On the inter
[ viewing committee will be a repre
j sentative from Cardinals: Louis
| Meleika. president of the I Club;
VVaterous; and Miss Winter.
Interviews will be on Thursday
and Friday between 2:'io and 4:30
and Saturday between 10:30 and
12 in tb-824.
