# Farm Federalists Ask Support For Internationalist Petition
## 
### BOB RIGNEY 
Stanford students, many too
young to vote, now have a chance
to register their convictions on
world government with the Presi
dent and Congress.
This week the Stanford Federal
ists have set up a booth in front
of the Cellar where students may
sign a petition asking our govern
ment to give its full support to the
United Nations, conform our for
eign policy to the spirit of the
Charter, initiate the necessary steps
to convert that organization into an
international federal government,
and submit to the legislatures of the
states a constitutional amendment
to enable the United States to par
ticipate in a world federation.
Republicans. Democrats, Federal
ists, and non-Federalistsâ€”all who
believe a world government is a
necessary and logical step toward

world orcer have been urged by
UWF president Paul Watson to sign
the petition.
The Stanford Federalists art
spearheading this drive to make the
final step toward world government
a prelude to peace rather than the
aftermath of another war.
Those who sign are also invitee
to join a car cavalcade to Wash
ington at the end of the quarter to
present the petition to the President
and Congress.
In so far as cars will be furnished,
the only costs for the trip East wil
be for gasoline and food. Arrange
ments have been made for students
to sleep in sleeping bags in desig
nated parks along the way.
As the caravan rolls through the
intervening college towns it will
pick up other student delegations
which have supported identical pro
grams.
