# Common Campus Disease Is Nuisance, Not Danger

i Editor's Note: Many eases of

rienced on campus during the past

describes the disease and outlines
the troubles doctors have curing

Infectious Mononucleosis is a
strange disease, and like other
universities and colleges, Stan
ford is rarely, if ever, free of it.
Mononucleosis was first not
iced in children's hospitals in the
t arly 1900's, and was then diagnosed
.> "Glandular Fever." With increas
ing knowledge, and improved meth
ods of diagnosis since the '20s, it has
taken its place as one of the com
moner nuisances found wherever
young adults congregate.
The cause of the disease is not
known, although it is considered to
e a virus. It is. believed to be trans
litted in the same way as are mea
lies. mumps, and chicken-pox, but
infection seems to take more con
tact than some of the other virus
diseases. Explosive epidemics are
unusual, therefore, except in or
phanages and institutions with large
numbers of young adults.
Resembles Iceberg
It is quite possible that the disease
within a university resembles an
iceberg, in that the top one-eighth
is the only part of the disease pat
tern that is seen. The physicians of
the Stanford Health Service believe
that many students have the disease
in such a mild form that they are
not aware they are ill. Other indi
viduals probably have mild symp
toms. and recover without the for
mality of a diagnosis.
About a week after exposure the
symptoms begin to appear. There is
general infection of the whole
ody. and the commoner symptoms
e fatigue, general discomfort, le
ver. and a sore throat. The lymph
atic glands enlarge, and later, char
acteristic changes occur in the white
blood colls.
Some patients develop a rash, and
one in 10 will become
aundiced. "Very rarely do compil
ations set in," says Dr. George
Houck. director of the Stanford
Health Service. "Sometimes there
.-.re*relapses, but usually because the
natient exerted himself too much
nd too soon. The only real danger
'.o the student is to his grades."
Nuisance. Not Threat
Infectious mononucleosis may be
very mild or may be severe enough

to cau.se several weelcs of disability.
At this time there is no known
method of prevention, and so far the
only method of treatment is that of
the symptoms as they occur. Sulfon
amides are ineffective, but penicillin
seems to help the throat symptoms.
Experiments are now under way
using some of the newer antibiotic
drugs, but the results arc not yet
of importance.
From the point of view of the
Health Service, the disease is a first
rate nuisance, but it is no threat
to life or future health.

Experiments are now under way
using some of the newer antibiotic
drugs, but the results arc not yet
of importance.
From the point of view of the
Health Service, the disease is a first
rate nuisance, but it is no threat
to life or future health.

Infectious Mononucleosis is a
strange disease, and like other
universities and colleges, Stan
ford is rarely, if ever, free of it.
Mononucleosis was first not
iced in children's hospitals in the
t arly 1900's, and was then diagnosed
.> "Glandular Fever." With increas
ing knowledge, and improved meth
ods of diagnosis since the '20s, it has
taken its place as one of the com
moner nuisances found wherever
young adults congregate.
The cause of the disease is not
known, although it is considered to
e a virus. It is. believed to be trans
litted in the same way as are mea
lies. mumps, and chicken-pox, but
infection seems to take more con
tact than some of the other virus
diseases. Explosive epidemics are
unusual, therefore, except in or
phanages and institutions with large
numbers of young adults.
Resembles Iceberg
It is quite possible that the disease
within a university resembles an
iceberg, in that the top one-eighth
is the only part of the disease pat
tern that is seen. The physicians of
the Stanford Health Service believe
that many students have the disease
in such a mild form that they are
not aware they are ill. Other indi
viduals probably have mild symp
toms. and recover without the for
mality of a diagnosis.
About a week after exposure the
symptoms begin to appear. There is
general infection of the whole
ody. and the commoner symptoms
e fatigue, general discomfort, le
ver. and a sore throat. The lymph
atic glands enlarge, and later, char
acteristic changes occur in the white
blood colls.
Some patients develop a rash, and
one in 10 will become
aundiced. "Very rarely do compil
ations set in," says Dr. George
Houck. director of the Stanford
Health Service. "Sometimes there
.-.re*relapses, but usually because the
natient exerted himself too much
nd too soon. The only real danger
'.o the student is to his grades."
Nuisance. Not Threat
Infectious mononucleosis may be
very mild or may be severe enough

to cau.se several weelcs of disability.
At this time there is no known
method of prevention, and so far the
only method of treatment is that of
the symptoms as they occur. Sulfon
amides are ineffective, but penicillin
seems to help the throat symptoms.
Experiments are now under way
using some of the newer antibiotic
drugs, but the results arc not yet
of importance.
From the point of view of the
Health Service, the disease is a first
rate nuisance, but it is no threat
to life or future health.
