## Block S for Crew 
### 
The Block S letter award is the highest honor a student body
can give its athletes. Last week Excom tabled a by-law until
Wednesday that would allow a Block S letter to the first and
aecond varsity crew men who participate in either the Cal or
Washington races or any other two races.
Several points were brought out last week why the crew
should be a major sport at Stanford. First, crew has spectator
interest At both the Cal (at Stanford) and USC (at USC) races
this year, over 4,000 spectators turned out. At Seattle the tra
ditional Cal-Washington regatta drew over 75,000 spectators.
Second, crew men put in as many hours in practice as other
major sports. Those hours, by the way, are put in between 5
and \ a.m. every day except Saturday.
And third, Stanford crew draws many more turnouts than can
be handled. This year, for instance, 120 men tried out for posi
tions on the five shells, but only 50 could be taken. Cal and
Washington have many more shells than Stanford, and they are
able to place more participants.
For the above reasons, crew should be a major sport. The
squad has climbed from relative obscurity to the largest minor
import now at Stanford. The participants themselves have ar
ranged for equipment, publicity, and financing. Stanford alumni,
Cal, and Washington have given our team money and equip
ment to place the crew on a competitive level with any other
collegiate squad in the country.
The Stanford Crew Association has dropped only one race so
far this year—to the California Olympic champions. We have
beaten USC and the South End, Dolphin, and San Francisco
Bowing Clubs. We will beat Oregon State later this quarter be
cause that team is no stronger than the USC squad.
