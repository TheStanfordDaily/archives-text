To the Editor:
Out of 266 owners ol tickets to ihe Village dining hall whom I have
interviewed. 82 (or less than one-third) ate their supper at the Pavilion
test Wednesday evening. This ratio probably holds true for all Village
diners. Then, at least two-thirds of these residents have paid for a meal
which, because of the inconvenience of time, place, and weather, they
have not received.
Notwithstanding the desirability of pulling weeds at the Con Home,
does the University have the moral right to impos"e this annual trek to
the Con Home, the Pavilion, or any place else besides the accustomed
dining halls?
Assuming for the moment that the University takes the course in the
matter which it feels most students approve (since, after all, they ;ire
financing the meal), wouldn t it logical to find out in advance how
many want to go to the "picnic belore deciding to close the dining halls?
