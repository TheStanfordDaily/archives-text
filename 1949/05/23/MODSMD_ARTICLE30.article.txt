# Disapproval of Hashing Committee
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Please permit me to voice my strong disapproval of the scheme to set up
a hashing committee as proposed in The Daily editorial of May 18.
I believe the writer of the editorial was sincere in expressing his opin
ions. but I implore him—and all your readers—to consider carefully the
plan to substitute a student committee of three active hashers and one
faculty representative for the present system of allocating hashing jobs.
Tlie danger of the new scheme lies in the fact that the student committee
would be in a position to exercise dictatorial powers over students in need
cf hashing jobs. The present happy position in which students who hash
are not socially discriminated against (as referred to in the editorial)
would be seriously prejudiced were hashing to become the outward and
visible sign of financial need as the scheme proposes.
There is no adequate method of determining a student's financial condi
tion this is an investigatory power available only to the government of
the United States. Thus, the proposed committee would have little pros
pect of achieving better results than those obtained under the present
circumstances. The committee, however, would be in a position to em
barrass needy students, conduct inquisitorial sessions, exercise discrimi
nation, and form a clique without whose approval no student—needy or
otherwise—could obtain a job in any of the University dining halls.
It anv attempt to further this scheme is planned I submit that such an
important issue should be submitted to- the democratic processes of he
ballot, and should not be deliberated upon by Excom until student feeling
on the matter has been adequately determined.
I condemn the proposed plan as being dangerous, undemocratic, and
foreign to the Stanford spirit.
