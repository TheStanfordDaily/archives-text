thal's recent brushes with members
of Congress over barring Commu
nists from the Atomic Energy Com

not do him any good next year, when
his reappointment to the commission
is likely to come up.
Lilienthal, now commission chair
man, has held in effect that it might
be better to h?ive a Communist or
two turn up getting government
funds in non-secret fields of study
than to turn the FBI spotlight on
every applicant.
