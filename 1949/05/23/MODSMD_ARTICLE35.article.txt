# Price Cuts

WASHINGTON — Government
economists' are keeping their fingers
crossed on what they consider the
big thing that will determine the
immediate business future — public
response to price cuts.
Up until this past week nearly all
reports coming in from business men
over the country showed price cuts
drawing more buyers.
However, a big eastern retailer

has sent worrisome word that buy
ers have been holding off the past
few days despite price cuts on a
scale that pulled them in before.
A top rank economist says it's a
good thing for people to want lower
prices—up to a point—but that if
they hold off for "OPA or pre-war
prices'' they'll force not only a price
crash but a business crash that will
hurt everybody.
