WASHINGTONâ€”There's a report
going around that Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas may take

| off for Europe next month on the
heels of Gov. Thomas E. Dewey's
j "non-political" tour of Britain and
western continental countries.
Douglas' ofiice will neither confirm
, nor deny the report.
Friends of the 50-ycar-old jurist
have been attempting to build him
up lor the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1952. He had many
] self-styled "liberal" democratic sup
porters at the 1948 Democratic con
vention. But during the convention
he issued a statement in Portland,
Oregon, that "no person, while a
member of the Supreme Court
should,seek political preferment."
