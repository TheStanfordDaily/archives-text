# Reconstruction Plans Laid Within Few Days of 'Quake'
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
(Editor's Note: This is the fourth
in a series on the history of Stan
ford buildings.)
Within a few days of the earth
quake, the rubble was being cleared
and plans laid for reconstruction of
damaged buildings. Dr. Jordan ex
cused the students for the semester
and appointed a commission of engi
neers to survey the extent of the
loss. *
This commission was composed of
professors C. D. Marx. W. F. Durand,
and C. B. Wing, who began work
on June 29. Dr. Jordan turned down
the secretaryship of the Smithsonian
Institute to help in the reconstruc
tion. The position had been made
known to him the day of the earth
quake.
The commission estimated that it
would cost $050,000 to repair dam
aged buildings and an equal sum to
restore the church. The latter proj
ect was postponed. The commission
also decided to raze the extravagant
library and gymnasium, which
would have cost the University
$750,000 to rebuild.
Meanwhile. William Randolph
Hearst's San Francisco Examiner
took the opportunity to create a
sensation by alleging graft in the
construction of University build
ings, putting Controller Charles G.
Lathrop in the spotlight. The Board
of Trustees immediately passed a

resolution clearing him of any
charges.
Senator Stanford carried no insur
ance on either the University or his
home, an oversight that put the
University in a precarious financial
situation. Nevertheless, the build
ings were patched up so that the
University could open again the fol
lowing fall, despite a strike of Union
carpenters that delayed work for
two weeks.
The church was reopened in 1913
with the steeple eliminated and the
sandstone set around steel and
bolted together. The "Sermon" was
replaced and the statuary eliminated
from the altar. Encina Gym was
constructed, minus a ballroom, to
handle men's physical education.
The present library, with a capac
ity of one million volumes, was
built in 11)19. the first building of a
proposed second Quad. Several
smaller libraries, donated by indi
viduals. were incorporated in the
building.
Plans for a student union were
drawn up in 1909 and pushed by
Herbert Hoover. The Women's
League started the clubhouse pro
gram in 1912, and both buildincs
were constructed in 1916. A dining
room was added to the Union later,
financed by an anonymous dona
tion of $100,000.

known to him the day of the earth
quake.
The commission estimated that it
would cost $050,000 to repair dam
aged buildings and an equal sum to
restore the church. The latter proj
ect was postponed. The commission
also decided to raze the extravagant
library and gymnasium, which
would have cost the University
$750,000 to rebuild.
Meanwhile. William Randolph
Hearst's San Francisco Examiner
took the opportunity to create a
sensation by alleging graft in the
construction of University build
ings, putting Controller Charles G.
Lathrop in the spotlight. The Board
of Trustees immediately passed a

resolution clearing him of any
charges.
Senator Stanford carried no insur
ance on either the University or his
home, an oversight that put the
University in a precarious financial
situation. Nevertheless, the build
ings were patched up so that the
University could open again the fol
lowing fall, despite a strike of Union
carpenters that delayed work for
two weeks.
The church was reopened in 1913
with the steeple eliminated and the
sandstone set around steel and
bolted together. The "Sermon" was
replaced and the statuary eliminated
from the altar. Encina Gym was
constructed, minus a ballroom, to
handle men's physical education.
The present library, with a capac
ity of one million volumes, was
built in 11)19. the first building of a
proposed second Quad. Several
smaller libraries, donated by indi
viduals. were incorporated in the
building.
Plans for a student union were
drawn up in 1909 and pushed by
Herbert Hoover. The Women's
League started the clubhouse pro
gram in 1912, and both buildincs
were constructed in 1916. A dining
room was added to the Union later,
financed by an anonymous dona
tion of $100,000.

Within a few days of the earth
quake, the rubble was being cleared
and plans laid for reconstruction of
damaged buildings. Dr. Jordan ex
cused the students for the semester
and appointed a commission of engi
neers to survey the extent of the
loss. *
This commission was composed of
professors C. D. Marx. W. F. Durand,
and C. B. Wing, who began work
on June 29. Dr. Jordan turned down
the secretaryship of the Smithsonian
Institute to help in the reconstruc
tion. The position had been made
known to him the day of the earth
