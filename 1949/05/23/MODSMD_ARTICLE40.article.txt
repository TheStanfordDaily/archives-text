One more step to coeducation—
Last week Harvard and Radclifl'e
Councils considered a proposal
which would establish coeducational
clubs.
Harvard Council president said
that he didn't favor breaking the
tradition-bound "all Harvard" rule,
which had kept feminine neighbors
at home. All agreed, however, that
the coed clubs were a good thing "as
long as the interests of both the
Harvard and Radclifle organizations
are preserved."

No more coffeetime for San Jose
State students—those cutting more
than 10 class periods total—or four
absences in any one class—are sub
ject to dismissal from college. Spar
tans are now universally moaning
from 8 a.m. blues.

Why should seniors be forced to
take finals? That's what one Wash
ington State Evergreen editorial
writer wanted to know.
The Washington rules state only
that seniors must have a certain
grade average and number of units
to graduate. The writer felt that the
last semester finals could do nothing
to raise or lower this general aver
age—except in special cases.
One way to do away with that
"tired senior look."

Washington State has its flattops,
too! A giant modernistic four-story
tincture — Todd Hall — was dedi
cated at the annual spring home
coming of the northern college.
Although the building is markedly
different from the rest of the Wash
ington skyline, college alumni have
raised no "roof controversy." Shades
of Stern!

"Wanted: Four Goatherders lor
trip to Japan."
And it is all part of a University

of Oregon religious department pro
gram which organized a "Goats for
Japan" drive last year. Dr. Paul B.
Means, department head, said that
MaeArthur had set the goat quota
at 2,750 by July.
The rides to Japan are free for
Oregon students - if they will look
nfter the goats all of the way.

University of Kansas television
department has gone a long way

Not only do radio students broad
east their own programs from
WQAM, but are now producing their
own telecasts from WTVJ—special

The university radio-TV depart

Ten years in business have found
the five co-operative houses at the
University of Kansas doing a boom
ing business.
When the co-ops began, students
only paid $17 a month for room and
board. Even now. the cost is only
$35.
The houses operate under a Co-op
Council which has a centralized pur
chasing plan making lower cost pos
sible for all of the groups.

Love Life at Michigan State is
simply not what it "uster be." De -

campus Passion Patrol is making
their lives miserable.
Seems that couplcs sitting by the
University Red Cedar who had ne

and portable radios were separated,
warned, and listed among the emo
tionally maladjusted.
One letter writer blamed the house
mothers, asking. "Just how subver
sive can love be at MSC?"

University of Kansas television
department has gone a long way

Not only do radio students broad
east their own programs from
WQAM, but are now producing their
own telecasts from WTVJ—special

The university radio-TV depart

Ten years in business have found
the five co-operative houses at the
University of Kansas doing a boom
ing business.
When the co-ops began, students
only paid $17 a month for room and
board. Even now. the cost is only
$35.
The houses operate under a Co-op
Council which has a centralized pur
chasing plan making lower cost pos
sible for all of the groups.

Love Life at Michigan State is
simply not what it "uster be." De -
jected lovers have deplored that the
campus Passion Patrol is making
their lives miserable.
Seems that couplcs sitting by the
University Red Cedar who had ne
glected to bring their Bi Sci manuals
and portable radios were separated,
warned, and listed among the emo
tionally maladjusted.
One letter writer blamed the house
mothers, asking. "Just how subver
sive can love be at MSC?"
One more step to coeducation—
Last week Harvard and Radclifl'e
Councils considered a proposal
which would establish coeducational
clubs.
Harvard Council president said
that he didn't favor breaking the
tradition-bound "all Harvard" rule,
which had kept feminine neighbors
at home. All agreed, however, that
the coed clubs were a good thing "as
long as the interests of both the
Harvard and Radclifle organizations
are preserved."

No more coffeetime for San Jose
State students—those cutting more

Why should seniors be forced to
take finals? That's what one Wash
ington State Evergreen editorial
writer wanted to know.
The Washington rules state only
that seniors must have a certain
grade average and number of units
to graduate. The writer felt that the
last semester finals could do nothing
to raise or lower this general aver
age—except in special cases.
One way to do away with that
"tired senior look."

Washington State has its flattops,
too! A giant modernistic four-story
tincture — Todd Hall — was dedi
cated at the annual spring home
coming of the northern college.
Although the building is markedly
different from the rest of the Wash

raised no "roof controversy." Shades
of Stern!
