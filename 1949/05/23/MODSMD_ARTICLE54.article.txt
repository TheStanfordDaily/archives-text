LUKE EASTER, colorful San Diego firstbaseman, is welcomed home by
IIARVEY STOREY (left), Padre third baseman, after his 14th home
run of the season against San Francisco. Easter is rated one of the
hardest hitters ever to play in the Pacific Coast league. He has become
a tremendous drawing attraction around the league. Yesterday
fans turned out at Seals Stadium to watch the big man perform. San
Diego and San Francisco split their double header, the Seals winning the
lirst 11 to and the Padres the nightcap, 10 to 7.
