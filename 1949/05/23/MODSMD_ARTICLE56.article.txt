# Delta Chi Leads Mural Qualifying
## 
### 
Angell Field echoed to the groans
and cheers of both athletes and
spectators Friday as the intramural
track trials for 1949 were held at
4 p.m.
Leading the pack in qualifying
was the Delta Chi track contingent.
The Delta Chi's placed in ten
events, while the Zetes and the
Dekes followed with seven places
each.
This should make these three
teams the favorites to battle it out
for the intramural crown, but other
teams will have a chance. The
number qualifying does not include
the entrants in the 100-yard dash,
as the semi-finals of that race are
to be run today. Neither does the
total include the mile and the two
mile entrants, nor does it include
the place that will be awarded when
a tie is run off in the high hurdles
today.
Proof that the team with the most
qualifiers does not always win is
furnished by last year's results.
Delta Chi led last year's qualifying
parade but the Delts came through
with three upset victories to win
the title.
This year the Delts are apparently
out of it with only three qualifiers,
but either the Zetes or the Dekes
could push the favorites out of the
top notch.
