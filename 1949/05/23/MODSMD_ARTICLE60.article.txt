## 
### JOHN HALL 
The educated arm of Lefty Dave Dahle once again set St.
ary's down gasping, this time with four hits Saturday, as
anford won its seventh league contest, 7 to 2.
It was the CIBA finale for the Indians, and a scattered Sunken
amond crowd watched them put on one of their best per-

mances of the season.
t was Lefty Dahle who once again
k complete charge of the base
lers from Moraga. Dahle pitched
-hit ball for five innings, and
uck out 14 along the route to
ablish a new strikeout standard
the 19-19 season.
lis sparkling mound work, ac
npanied by a consistent bat bar
;e by the Card stickers, gave
inford a clean three-game sweep
linst the Gaels and produced a
I season final record for the
be.
Stanford Scores Early
Stanford wasted no time in get
l on the scoreboard, as in the
t inning Bud Klein got life on

error, Chuck Cole tripled him in.
I then came home on Dick
gle to give the Indians a lead
ich was never thereatened.
'onsistent Charlie Cole led the
ing with a triple and single in
ee trips, being intentionally I
sed in the three-run sixth,
•her Dahle also collected two hits,
a double, to complete a highly •
cessful season.
he victory was Dahle's fifth
inst only two losses, and earned
i a position among the CIBA's
t. Ahead of him is USC's Don
ider, who owns a 7-1 rating.
/hile Stanford was pounding St. ;
•y's, USC's champion Trojans
e winning their 21st straight
game, this time against Jackie
sen and the California Bears.
Melton Loses Out
ensen wild-pitched with the
es loaded to give Troy its win
g run.
i the other scheduled CIBA en
ement, Santa Clara split a dou
header with UCLA to maintain ■
r second spot in the standings.
LA finished third, Stanford
th, California fifth, and St. I
y's wound up in the Cellar,
hortstop Dave Melton of the In

dians picked up only one hit in four
trips against the Gaels, so his
i chances for the league batting title
went out the window.
Skip Rowland of UCLA, who
smashed out 4 for 10 against Santa
Clara to maintain his .400 average,
unofficially won the season's batting
j crown.
The Indians played their final
game without an error to pick up
one CIBA standard at least, that of
making a lower amount of miscues
than any other club in the loop.
The basefcallers h ave two more
games scheduled before they hang
up their suits. Next Wednesday
i they'll divide up sides for a wild and
I wooly inter-squad game.
Bill Arce and Jim Castagnoli are
! the nominees for the pitching roles,
! and every man will play a foreign
| position in what should be a zany
j afternoon of baseball.
The annual game with the Alumni,
i this year marking the retirement of
Harry VVolter, will conclude the sea-
I son on Saturday.
