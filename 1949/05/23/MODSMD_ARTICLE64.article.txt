# Card Tennis Team Edged by Troy, 5-4
## 
### DAN WINSTON 
The victory column once more
reads one tor USC and none for
Stanford in the tennis world, but
the Indians arose Saturday to scare
the daylights out of a heavily fa
vored Trojan squad before suc
cumbing by a score of 5 to 4 on
the Farm courts.
Earlier this year the men from
the Southland took the Cards apart
on the USC courts, and for a while
Saturday it looked like the netters
from Figueroa Tech were going to
do it again.
The men from Troy took the first
four singles matches without losing
a set, although Bobby Perez was
forced to go all out to capture the
first set from Bob Lewis 12 to 10.
and Errol Lycette forced Straight
Clark to extra games before los
ing 9-7 and 8-6.
Lewis Loses Heartbreaker
But the real heartbreaker was
Fred Lewis' loss to Fleitz in the
fourth singles. Lewis walked through
Fleitz in the first set 6-2, but the
Trojan suddenly recovered his form
to brush Lewis aside in the filial
two sets by 6-1, 6-2.
Had Lewis been able to keep the
pressure on Fleitz he eould have
swung the match in favor of the
Indians, because the narrow margin
ot one match was all that separated
the men from Troy and the Farm
netters at the end.

In the fil th singles match the pic
ture changed as Lucian Barbour
chalked up the first Stanford win ot
the day by beating Teal in three
sets—6-4. 2-6, 11-9.
Then Vince Schmieder made it
two in a row lor the Indians as he
bocoed Harris in two sets 6-2, 6-2.
That brought the count to four
matches to two and the Trojan
coach would have had ample rea
son to talk to himself.
This Stanford team that was not

supposed to be in the same class
with Troy evidently had nut heard
the news, and the result of the
match depended on the doubles.
Troy Clinches Match
But the Cards' hope for victory
was short hveu. Arnie Saul and
Bobby Pere'. put the contest on ice
when they defeated Bob and Fred
Lewis in a tight three sets in the
lirst doubles, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5.
1 hen the irate Indians swept
through the final two doubles
matches to put the count at 5 to 4
in favor of the Trojans. Bob Forbes
and Kirke Mechem dropped the
first set of the second doubles 5-7
to Clark and Fleitz. but the Indian
duo took the next two sets 6-3. 6-?
to cinch the match.
Not to be outdone, Vince Schmie

The victory column once more
reads one tor USC and none for

the Indians arose Saturday to scare
the daylights out of a heavily fa

cumbing by a score of 5 to 4 on
the Farm courts.
Earlier this year the men from
the Southland took the Cards apart
on the USC courts, and for a while
Saturday it looked like the netters
from Figueroa Tech were going to
do it again.
The men from Troy took the first
four singles matches without losing
a set, although Bobby Perez was
forced to go all out to capture the
first set from Bob Lewis 12 to 10.
and Errol Lycette forced Straight
Clark to extra games before los
ing 9-7 and 8-6.
Lewis Loses Heartbreaker
But the real heartbreaker was
Fred Lewis' loss to Fleitz in the
fourth singles. Lewis walked through
Fleitz in the first set 6-2, but the
Trojan suddenly recovered his form
to brush Lewis aside in the filial
two sets by 6-1, 6-2.
Had Lewis been able to keep the
pressure on Fleitz he eould have
swung the match in favor of the
Indians, because the narrow margin
ot one match was all that separated
the men from Troy and the Farm
netters at the end.

That brought the count to four

match depended on the doubles.
