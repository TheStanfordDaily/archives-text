### MARY E. HILL 
At least three and possibly five
original television plays will be
written, produced, and telecast this
summer by the '"Problems of Tele
vision" class, part of the Stanford-
NBC Radio Institute, said Stanley
T. Donner. director of the Radio
Institute.
"The Stanford-NBC Radio Insti
tute will provide an opportunity for
careful study and sound practice in
television, in addition to important
radio work," Dr. Donner said. All
course work will focus attention on
television.
Besides work on the television
plays, the class will delve into the
background and technical operations
of television. Students will learn
such production methods as how to
block a television show, problems
in focusing TV cameras, and how
three-dimensional sound is applied.
Fundamentals of set construction
and staging, the effects of lights on
sets and on picture transmission,
and the types and colors used in
costuming and make-up will also
be included. In addition, the class
will study the unique problem of

j writing scripts for both eye and ear
j and the cost and programming the
; ories of television.
George Greaves, assistant general
| manager of KNBC, will join Dr.
Donner and Ray Sanders, Stanford
electrical engineering graduate, in
presenting the "Problems of Tele
vision" course. The class will also
feature guest speakers from leaders
in the field of television.
Greaves joined the NBC staff in
1928 and since then has worked on
many West Coast radio "firsts." He
handled the first broadcasts from a
moving ship at sea, and also the first
i broadcasts from Hoover Dam, the
dirigible Macon, and the San Fran
! Cisco Bay Bridge dedication.
One of Greaves' biggest jobs was
directing the technical operations
for both network and station cov
erage of the United Nations Con
ference on International Organiza
tion in San Francisco.

be taught by experienced radio men
and women including ten from the
KNBC staff in San Francisco.
Dr. Donner stated that students
of education, law, business, psychol
ogy, Journalism, and drama all havt
a stake in both radio and television
Preparation for the future should
include work in these two important
media of communication.
