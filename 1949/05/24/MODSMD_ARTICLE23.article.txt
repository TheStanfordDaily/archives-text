## Academic Freedom 
### 
Six months ago the University of Washington announced that
six professors had been suspended or put on probation at the
(university because of their active membership in the Communist
jParty. Since that time, many university presidents have been
iasked what their views were on the issue of "academic freedom."
' Below we have listed the views of Dr. Raymond B. Allen,
president of the University of Washington; Dr. Wallace Sterling,
[president of Stanford University; and a statement on academic
freedom as passed by the National Executive Committee of NSA.
: "A teacher may be rendered incompetent," Dr. Allen wrote in
his report, 'Communism and Academic Freedom,' "even within
:he restricted legal meaning of the term, by any action, condi
tion, or attitude which interferes with proper and adequate per
formance of his duties."
Dr. Allen asks this question:
"A teacher may be ever so sincere in his belief in Communism,
but at the same time can he be a sincere seeker after truth, which
is the first obligation and duty of the teacher?
"My answer to this question is, 'He cannot.' Therefore, I be
lieve these men, by reason ol their admitted membership in the '
Communist Party . ... to be incompetent, intellectually dis
honest, and derelict in their duty to find and teach the truth."
The two presidents are quite frank in their discussions on Com
munist membership and the teaching profession. The NSA Ex
ecutive Committee covers the angle of academic freedom in rela
tion to a "temporary hysteria" caused by "emergency circum
stances."
Referring to teachers having Communist affiliations, Dr. Allen
said, "I maintain that complete membership (in the Communist
Party) should disqualify a man for a teaching position in the uni
versity." Dr. Allen said that the University of Washington's hear
ings during the latter half of 1948 represented "the university's
effort to face squarely, and to answer questions surrounding, the
effect of Communist Party membership on the disqualifications
of a teacher."
Dr. Allen sums up his report on the Washington hearings with: !
"I do not question the right of an instructor to entertain a belief
of his choice. But active membership in any organization incom
patible with the government of the United States is disqualifying
and is ground for dismissal."
Early in April, Dr. Sterling told a press conference that if a
Communist teacher cannot be objective in his presentation, he
is almost by definition precluded from the classroom.
Dr. Sterling said, "I doubt if any member of the Communist
Party is a free agent. If he isn't a free agent, he cannot be objec
tive in his teaching. Therefore, he should be precluded from
classroom presentation."
Dr. Allen told a "Town Meeting of the Air".audience, "The
Communists shouldn't be able to teach in American colleges,
because they are not free men We have proved beyond
doubt that the Communists are slaves to dogma. A Commu
nist has abdicated control over his intellectual life; a teacher
can't be a whole man and be halt slave."
Dr. Allen is more definite in his opinions because of his expe
rience in the hearings at his university. Both presidents, how
ever, do have comparable opinions if Communist Party members
are not free agents in their teaching duties.
The statement on academic freedom passed on April 3 by the
NSA Executive Committee "opposes . . . the present tendency
. . . towards the negation of long-established principles of aca
demic freedom because of hysterical emergency circumstances
—negation both in terms of the immediate injustice it produces
and in terms of its permanently damaging effect on the over-all
fabric of our freedom to learn."
The committee's statement says that "the basis for punitive
action in the college community should be clear proof of the
deliberate actions of the individuals in question with the violation
of the following principles:
1. "The teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in
discussing his subject, but he should not introduce into his
teaching controversial matter which has no relation to his
subject„
2. The teacher has the right to join organizations whether re
ligious, political, or social—provided that these organizations are
not illegal under the civil status—without his being discriminated
against through economic, social, or political pressures because
of his activities.
3. When the teacher speaks or writes as a citizen outside
the campus, he should be free from institutional censorship or
discipline."
In this NSA committee statement, we regard their first point as
the most important. Picking up the arguments of both Drs. Allen
and Sterling, we would add that a Communist -teacher would
present, out of proportion to its value, Communist propaganda in
the classroom or seminars.
If he did overemphasize such material, the Communist teacher
would not be "objective"; he would be "intellectually dishonest";
he would be a slave to his dogma.

president of the University of Washington; Dr. Wallace Sterling,
[president of Stanford University; and a statement on academic
freedom as passed by the National Executive Committee of NSA.
: "A teacher may be rendered incompetent," Dr. Allen wrote in
his report, 'Communism and Academic Freedom,' "even within
:he restricted legal meaning of the term, by any action, condi
tion, or attitude which interferes with proper and adequate per
formance of his duties."
Dr. Allen asks this question:
"A teacher may be ever so sincere in his belief in Communism,
but at the same time can he be a sincere seeker after truth, which
is the first obligation and duty of the teacher?
"My answer to this question is, 'He cannot.' Therefore, I be
lieve these men, by reason ol their admitted membership in the '
Communist Party . ... to be incompetent, intellectually dis
honest, and derelict in their duty to find and teach the truth."
The two presidents are quite frank in their discussions on Com
munist membership and the teaching profession. The NSA Ex
ecutive Committee covers the angle of academic freedom in rela
tion to a "temporary hysteria" caused by "emergency circum
stances."
Referring to teachers having Communist affiliations, Dr. Allen
said, "I maintain that complete membership (in the Communist
Party) should disqualify a man for a teaching position in the uni
versity." Dr. Allen said that the University of Washington's hear
ings during the latter half of 1948 represented "the university's
effort to face squarely, and to answer questions surrounding, the
effect of Communist Party membership on the disqualifications
of a teacher."
Dr. Allen sums up his report on the Washington hearings with: !
"I do not question the right of an instructor to entertain a belief
of his choice. But active membership in any organization incom
patible with the government of the United States is disqualifying
and is ground for dismissal."
Early in April, Dr. Sterling told a press conference that if a
Communist teacher cannot be objective in his presentation, he
is almost by definition precluded from the classroom.
Dr. Sterling said, "I doubt if any member of the Communist
Party is a free agent. If he isn't a free agent, he cannot be objec
tive in his teaching. Therefore, he should be precluded from
classroom presentation."
Dr. Allen told a "Town Meeting of the Air".audience, "The
Communists shouldn't be able to teach in American colleges,
because they are not free men We have proved beyond
doubt that the Communists are slaves to dogma. A Commu
nist has abdicated control over his intellectual life; a teacher
can't be a whole man and be halt slave."
Dr. Allen is more definite in his opinions because of his expe
rience in the hearings at his university. Both presidents, how
ever, do have comparable opinions if Communist Party members
are not free agents in their teaching duties.
The statement on academic freedom passed on April 3 by the
NSA Executive Committee "opposes . . . the present tendency
. . . towards the negation of long-established principles of aca
demic freedom because of hysterical emergency circumstances
—negation both in terms of the immediate injustice it produces
and in terms of its permanently damaging effect on the over-all
fabric of our freedom to learn."
The committee's statement says that "the basis for punitive
action in the college community should be clear proof of the
deliberate actions of the individuals in question with the violation
of the following principles:
1. "The teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in
discussing his subject, but he should not introduce into his
teaching controversial matter which has no relation to his
subject„
2. The teacher has the right to join organizations whether re
ligious, political, or social—provided that these organizations are
not illegal under the civil status—without his being discriminated
against through economic, social, or political pressures because
of his activities.
3. When the teacher speaks or writes as a citizen outside
the campus, he should be free from institutional censorship or
discipline."
In this NSA committee statement, we regard their first point as
the most important. Picking up the arguments of both Drs. Allen
and Sterling, we would add that a Communist -teacher would
present, out of proportion to its value, Communist propaganda in
the classroom or seminars.
If he did overemphasize such material, the Communist teacher
would not be "objective"; he would be "intellectually dishonest";
he would be a slave to his dogma.
Six months ago the University of Washington announced that
six professors had been suspended or put on probation at the
(university because of their active membership in the Communist
jParty. Since that time, many university presidents have been
