PARIS, May 22. —The four-power
Conference of Foreign Ministers
opened today with polite skirmish
ing over the agenda.
In a session of two and a half
hours the four diplomatic chiefs of
Britain, France, the United States,
and Russia swiftly agreed:
1. To make German unification
their top business.
2. Surprisingly placed an Aus
trian independence treaty on the
slate.
3. Quietly muffled the bombshell
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vi
shinsky proposed to throw into the
conference by suggesting that a
date be set with China to take up a
peace treaty for Japan.
After the main discussion of the
agenda. Vishinsky said the time had
come for the Foreign Ministers'
Council, in which France would be
replaced by China, to think about
writing a peace treaty for Japan.

The proposal apparently was an
attempt to capitalize on Communist
successes in China.
