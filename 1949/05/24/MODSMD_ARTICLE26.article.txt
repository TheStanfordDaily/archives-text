Man comes into this world without his consent, and leaves it against
his will. When lie is little the big girls kiss him, and when he is big
the little girls kiss him.
If he is active in politics, it is for graft; if he is not interested in politics,
he is no good to his country.
If he makes a lot of money, he is dishonest; if he is poor, he is a bad
manager.
It he needs credit, he can't get it; if he is prosperous, everyone wants
to do something for him.
II he is religious, he is a hypocrite; if he doesn't go to the temple, he is
a hardened sinner.
If he gives to charity, it is for show; if he doesn't, he is a stingy cuss.
It he is affectionate, he is a soft specimen; if he doesn't care for anyone,
he is coldhearted.
If he dies young, there was a great future before him; if he lives to a
ripe old age, he missed his calling.
If lie saves his money, he is a tightwad; if he spends it.he is a spend
thrift.
If he has money, he is a grafter, if he hasn't got it, he's a bum.
So what's the use? (Associated Collegiate Press)
