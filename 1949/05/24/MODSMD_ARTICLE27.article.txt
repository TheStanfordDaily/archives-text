Leave Those Posters Alone
; To the Editor:
I'm angry!! I'd like to know who swiped the poster advertising the AWS
Fashion Show (May 26 at 3:3oâ€”Casa Ventura, for the benefit of the AWS
Scholarship Fund) from History Corner. This, I think, is a low, vile trick
I "on accounta" the show needs every bit of publicity it can get. If char
acters are going to swipe its gorgeous posters, the show won't be a success
j and the scholarship award won't go through.
| It was hung in a legal space.
