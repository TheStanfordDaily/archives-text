### AL McCOMBS 
(Editor's Note: This is the fifth
and last of a series on the history
of Stanford buildings.)
Dormitories and athletic buildings
were the main concern of Univer
sity builders following the First
World War. The new buildings were
of a modified style, retaining the
traits of the original structures. Re
inforced concrete replaced sand
stone, but the tile roof remained.
The Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery was completed in 1921, and
in the meantime, the Stanford
women had *novcd to the new Roble
near Lake Lagunita. The original
Roble was renamed Sequoia and
turned over to the roughs.
Sports Help
Sports flourished during this per
iod, and in 1922 the Board of Ath
letic Control provided $90,000 for
the basketball Pavilion. A $204,000
football stadium had been completed
a short time before. Another $ 115,-
000 from athletics was spent on the
BAC administration building.
Toy on was constructed by the
University in 19215. and the following
year the BAC financed the building
of Branner. With Encina Gym paid
for the same year, the board shelled
out $235,000 for Roble Gym, and the
girls were able to abandon Wood
pecker Lodge, home of the Five
Hundreds' athletics since the school
opened. In 192.5. the University built
Encina Commons so that Toyon men
could eat on campus.
Lagunita Court
Lagunita Court, the pride anfl joy
of the University, was built in 1935.
The first construction included four
units, and two more "casas" were
built in 1937. Need for the new
dorm developed when the University

abandoned its policy of limiting the
co-ed enrollment to 500 because of
the depression. Lagunita Court was
proclaimed one of the leading wom
en's halls in the country, and its
design and interior put Tovon and
Branner to shame.
The year 19157 heralded another
building spree. A gift of $575,000
was received from Dean and Mrs.
Ellwood P. Cubberley and used to
construct the education building
which bears their name.
A personal achievement of the
student body is Memorial Hall, built
to house the drama department. A
memorial to the Stanfordites killed
in World War I, the $750,000 Hall
was financed by the ASSU, which
budgeted $1 out of each tuition for
the purpose. A unique feature of the
auditorium was the construction of
a slot in the ceiling, from which a
large curtain can be hung to close
off half of the auditorium for
smaller performances. Later it was
decided that this was impractical.
Frost Amphitheater
Also in 1937, Mr. and Mrs. Howard
Frost gave money for Frost Amphi
theater in memory of their son, a
Stanford graduate, who died in 1936.
Hoover Tower, finally completed
on the inside this year, was actually

finished in 1941 as far as the ex
terior was concerned. This $600,090
building houses a collection of docu
ments paralleled only by that of the
French government's Musee de la
Guerre. The 35-bell carillon in the
tower of the 280-foot structure was
a present from the Belgian-Ameri
can Educational Foundation.
Wright's Opinion
The library was designed on the
lines of the cathedrals of Salamanca
and Mexico City. Frank Lloyd
Wright, internationally known ar
chitect. once called the structure an
architectural mistake, after saying,
that the Stanford campus was one
of the most beautiful in America.
Post war building completed in
cludes the Microwave Laboratory,
the first building of a proposed Sci
ence Quad; Crothers Hall, the gift
of Judge George E. Crothers. '95;
and the School of Mineralogy Build
ings, in which existing Quad build
ings were improved and second
floors added.
Under construction are Stern Hall
for men. financed from the estate of
Mrs. Lucie Stern of Palo Alto, and
the new Law Building, once the Ad
ministration building and before
that the Thomas Welton Stanford
Library.
