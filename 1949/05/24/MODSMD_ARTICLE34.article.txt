# France's The Eagle' Displays Great Acting, Camera Work
## 
### AL BERRY 
"Tlie Eagle with Two Heads,"
which is currently occupying the
Guild's aging projectionist, is
French, unusual, and confusing.
The subtitles are good, and the
camera work is reminiscent of some
of the best of Hitchcock, yet with a
flair all its own. The plot, while
never really clear until the end, is
interesting enough to keep all con
cerned trying to piece things to
gether. The acting is great, and the
ending magnificent.
The major share of the acting
chores are carried on by Edwige

Feuillere, as a
haunted queen,
and Jean Ma
rais as a hunted
assassin. Marais
will be remem
bered for his re
markable por
trayal as Jose in

the Italian version of '"Carmen." In
"The Eagle" Marais proves to Amer
ican audiencse what Continental
audiences have known for some
time: that his greatness in "Car
men'' was not accident.
"The Eagle with Two Heads" is
not, however, another "Carmen,"
and it is certainly not the best of
the Guild's seemingly diminishing
crop of foreign goodies. But it defi
nitely is worth the price of admis
sion, a thing that has not declined
at the Guild.
One of the foremost things that

make "The Eagle" worth while is
its magnificent camera work. The
shots and camera angles arc often
unusual, sometimes bizarre, and al- j
ways bordering on greatness. It is [
this technical excellence that makes
the hazy plot not only palatable but j
even stirring.
The story tells of a beautiful
queen who, ever since her husband j
was assassinated on their wedding
night ten years before, has lived in i
seclusion with the ghost-like mem- \
ory. Into this stew is tossed a lib
eral amount of 18th-century court j
intrigue, and a decided shock when
the man chosen to murder the queen I
bears a striking—almost uncanny— j
resemblance to the long - departed
kin*.;.
The queen and her would -be
murderer fall in love, and turn their i
wits toward thwarting those who I
are plotting against them. The pic- ;
ture progresses rapidly through ]
'.ove, intrigue, and frustration to one J
of the most sensational climaxes j
these tired old eyes have witnessed i
in some years.
