Tomorrow night Stanford's student Executive Committee will vote <>n
a previously tabled motion that crew members receive varsity blocks,
thereby establishing crew as a major sport.
To be sure, crew is a worthy activity and its participants no doubt
work hard—as we all have heard many times—but in no way is Stanford
crew ready to become a major sport or to have its members pick up varsity
blocks.
Everybody knows that crewmen work out from 5 to 7 in the a.m., and
everybody knows that crewmen have struggled against tremendous odds,
and everybody knows that the crewmen have worked diligently to get
where they are.
But the question is. iust exactly where is crew? The answer is cloudy.
In fact, it's dark and stormy.
Crew has too shaky a past, present, and future to be considered as a
major sport.
It Leaves Me Cold
It has been said that there are several good reasons for making crew .
major sport, including the fact that the sport has spectator interest, thai
the oarsmen work as hard as other major sport athletes, and that tlu
turnout is larger than can be handled at the present time.
All that leaves me cold.
In the first placc, I would question the spectator interest concerning
Stanford crew. I would like to know just how many of those 4,000 fan:
who turned out to see the Cal-Stanford regatta would return to see an
other regatta on the Palo Alto course.
It would be sale to wager that less than half would take another gander
The home course is not worth it. It takes a good man to drive out ovei
that shabby path, park in a dusty trap, and then stand on shore hardlj
able to see even alter all that effort.
Oil Major Sports
Some say that crew deserves to be a major sport just as much as goll
and tennis do, and' that isn't bad reasoning. Except that golf and tennb
don't have any business being major sports either.
In fact, a lot of persons would be happy to see the old big-four brought
back as (lie ONLY acceptable major sports.
The trend nowadays is for every club in the school to demand circle-S
or major sport recognition. By jove, the Flying Club, the Rifle Club
ihe fencing-team, anybody is apt to turn up with a Stanford lettermai:
sweater.
Next, tiie ping-pong players, chess club, and even the sports writers wili
be asking for similar recognition.
Golf and tennis are obviously above that class. At least they have
tradition and a regular schedule to fall back on.
Not Even a Schedule
But crew doesn't even have a schedule to follow. Right now, the oars
men haven t the slightest idea of whom they will row against next year
l'or all anybody knows, the Stanford boys might not even be rowim
themselves.
It's a trembling foundation upon which the crewmen wish to build
their major sport. They lack tradition, strength, and a future.
And, pardon the thought, but they lack the backing of the athletic de
partment. But let's don't get into the middle of that famous debate. Tht
conditions that exist now do not permit us a place for crew. It has beei
stated time and time again. Let's leave it there for awhile.
What crew should do for the present is stick to its oars. Ease up, con
centrate on Poughkeepsie, have its kicks as it did a year ago, and above all
quit trying to jump into things before it is ready.
When crew has maintained a good schedule over a period of a few
years, when it has been invited to Poughkeepsie a few more times, when
it has developed a decent home course where people can turn out to
see what s going on. and when it has been recognized by the athletic
department, then let's recommend that crew be adopted as a major sport,
i But as for now, I say— No. No. No. No. No. No.
