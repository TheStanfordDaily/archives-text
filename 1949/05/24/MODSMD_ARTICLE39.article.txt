# Cindermen Set for Conference Meet; Chandler Will Make Northern Jaunt
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
F>k\ blond Otis Chandler, ace In
ian shotputter, will miss this
•eek's practice sessions at Angel!
ield because oi his sore wrist, but
ill be able to make the trip to
entile for the PCC meet this Sat
rday. it was learned yesterday.
Oiis and 17 Card teammates will
V to Seattle to compete for the
arm in the annual Pacific Coast
onference track meet on Saturday,
bey plan to make a short stop at
ie Oakland Airport to pick up the
ilifornia team, and will arrive in
•pttle Friday evening.
The Indians aren't to he counted
it ol a PCC meet victory by any
eans. It is true that USC scored
decisive win at Modesto last Sat
day, but this was mostly due to
ie counting of 10 points apiece for
ie relays, while the field event
inners only received five.
Strongest Field Team
Stanford is rated the strongest
;ld team in the country, and if
ey can pick up enough points in
e races, they can grab the meet
is Saturday.
It is interesting to note that in
e northern division meet, with
ashington State College winning
sily, the best times were recorded
the events where USC is the
•ongest.
The pole vault was won at 14 feet,
hich should give the Trojan trio
John Montgomery, John Rowan,
id A 1 Zimmerman something to
>rrv about. This is particularly
jnificant in that all three Troy
en will be vaulting in a strange
t.
Placcs in 880 Close
Although Bob Chambers of USC

will probably win the 880, (he rest
of the places will be nip-and-tuck
i ul! the way. The northern teams
have turned up with some pretty
fair half-milers this year, and more
prospective USC points will be cut
j in this race.
On the other hand, Stanford's
strong events will have practically
no extra competition from the
northern division teams. The shot
j put was won at less than 50 feet,
leaving only USC's Bill Eayless and
Jess Swope for Lew Davis, Otis
Chandler, and Norm Nourse to
reckon with.
Bud Held of the Indians will cer
tainly not be pressed by be'ow 200-
| foot javelin throwers, the best that
! the north has to offer. The broad
jump also promises to be an all
southern show, with last year's
winner. Gay Bryan, figured to re
peat.
The meet could be very close, and
the Indians may do the trick. Last
year s Card team placed second to

r the Trojans by only nine points,
i and Stanford is stronger this year.

! the PCC meet is as follows (entered

F>k\ blond Otis Chandler, ace In
ian shotputter, will miss this
•eek's practice sessions at Angel!
ield because oi his sore wrist, but
ill be able to make the trip to
entile for the PCC meet this Sat
rday. it was learned yesterday.
Oiis and 17 Card teammates will
V to Seattle to compete for the
arm in the annual Pacific Coast
onference track meet on Saturday,
bey plan to make a short stop at
ie Oakland Airport to pick up the
ilifornia team, and will arrive in
•pttle Friday evening.
The Indians aren't to he counted
it ol a PCC meet victory by any
eans. It is true that USC scored
decisive win at Modesto last Sat
day, but this was mostly due to
ie counting of 10 points apiece for
ie relays, while the field event
inners only received five.
Strongest Field Team
Stanford is rated the strongest
;ld team in the country, and if
ey can pick up enough points in
e races, they can grab the meet
is Saturday.
It is interesting to note that in
e northern division meet, with
ashington State College winning
sily, the best times were recorded
the events where USC is the
•ongest.
The pole vault was won at 14 feet,
hich should give the Trojan trio
John Montgomery, John Rowan,
id A 1 Zimmerman something to
>rrv about. This is particularly
jnificant in that all three Troy
en will be vaulting in a strange
t.
Placcs in 880 Close
Although Bob Chambers of USC

will probably win the 880, (he rest
of the places will be nip-and-tuck
i ul! the way. The northern teams
have turned up with some pretty
fair half-milers this year, and more
prospective USC points will be cut
j in this race.
On the other hand, Stanford's
strong events will have practically
no extra competition from the
northern division teams. The shot
j put was won at less than 50 feet,
leaving only USC's Bill Eayless and
Jess Swope for Lew Davis, Otis
Chandler, and Norm Nourse to
reckon with.
Bud Held of the Indians will cer
tainly not be pressed by be'ow 200-
| foot javelin throwers, the best that
! the north has to offer. The broad
jump also promises to be an all
southern show, with last year's
winner. Gay Bryan, figured to re
