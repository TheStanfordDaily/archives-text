ical and Security) Committee of the UN, which meets before the
main Assembly to determine the+~ .

liesolution. Three resolutions were j
submitted for discussion at the
Saturday meeting, which was led by I
Ed Chambers.
The first resolution was presented !
by Conrad von Bibra, chairman of
tifie Indian delegation. It advocated a
middle-of-the-road policy: if na
tions would really follow the UN_j
charter as it is set up there would i
be no need for a North Atlantic I
Pact. The Indian resolution was op
posed to both Eastern and Western !
views, and took a positive stand by j
strengthening the power of the UN. !

for, 19 opposed, 19 abstained.

Pact as an aggressive alliance, out
side the UN. The results of the

tries' views on the North Atlantic
Pact as part of the KSU "Round
Table of the Air." Bob von Pagen
