# Dr Hansen, Pioneer in Radar, Dies
## 
### 
Dr. William Webster Hansen, pro
fessor of physics and pioneer in ra
dar development, died early yester
day morning at his home on the
campus. He would have been 40 on
Friday.
Death was caused by chronic
bronchitis which followed an attack
of pneumonia. Fellow scientists at
tributed his illness to overwork
during the war, when he. was a
top-ranking radar scientist.

Funeral services will be private.

Recognition of Dr. Hansen's sci-
Paying tribute to Hansen's extra
ordinary scientific ability. Dr. Fred
erick Terman, dean of the School of
Engineering, remarked:
'"Dr. Hansen was one of the most
fertile and original men I have ever
known. He is credited with work
ing out most of the microwave
techniques used during the war."
Dr. Hansen was co-inventor of
the klystron, one of the first instru
ments for producing high - power
microwaves. Invention of the klys
tron, in turn, was one of the most
vital steps toward the perfection of
modern radar.
A Stanford graduate at the age of
20, Dr. Hansen joined the faculty
when he was 21, and soon earned
the Ph.D. in physics. His first ob
jective in scientific work was to find
a more effective way to smash
atoms, and in 1934 he invented a
cavity resonator, then known as the
rhumbatron.
Together with Sigurd Varian and
his brother and Dr. David L. Web
ster, Stanford physicist, Hansen
worked throughout the war years,
constantly striving to perfect radar.
It was during this period that he
first contracted pneumonia. A trip
to England last August to attend a
conference on atomic particle ac
celerators aggravated his condition.
Dr. Hansen returned to Stanford
in 1945 to continue work on his
primary scientific interest, the dis
covery of new laws in nature. He
was also engaged in extensive re

search work, and was the head of
the Stanford Microwave Laboratory.
He designed and developed the
entitle work was universal. He was
awarded the Liebmann Memorial
Ptize for outstanding work in radio
engineering in 1944, and just last
month he was elected to the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Hansen is survied by his wid
ow, Betsy Ann, his parents. Mr. and
Mrs. W. G. Hansen of Fresno, and
a brother, James.

Together with Sigurd Varian and
his brother and Dr. David L. Web
ster, Stanford physicist, Hansen
worked throughout the war years,
constantly striving to perfect radar.
It was during this period that he
first contracted pneumonia. A trip
to England last August to attend a
conference on atomic particle ac
celerators aggravated his condition.
Dr. Hansen returned to Stanford
in 1945 to continue work on his
primary scientific interest, the dis
covery of new laws in nature. He
was also engaged in extensive re

search work, and was the head of
the Stanford Microwave Laboratory.
He designed and developed the
entitle work was universal. He was
awarded the Liebmann Memorial
Ptize for outstanding work in radio
engineering in 1944, and just last
month he was elected to the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Hansen is survied by his wid
ow, Betsy Ann, his parents. Mr. and
Mrs. W. G. Hansen of Fresno, and
a brother, James.


DR. WILLIAM W. HANSEN.
Dr. William Webster Hansen, pro
fessor of physics and pioneer in ra
dar development, died early yester
day morning at his home on the
campus. He would have been 40 on
Friday.
Death was caused by chronic
bronchitis which followed an attack
of pneumonia. Fellow scientists at
tributed his illness to overwork
during the war, when he. was a
top-ranking radar scientist.

Funeral services will be private.
University's new atom smasher,
now being installed in the micro
wave laboratory.
Recognition of Dr. Hansen's sci-
Paying tribute to Hansen's extra
ordinary scientific ability. Dr. Fred
erick Terman, dean of the School of
Engineering, remarked:
'"Dr. Hansen was one of the most
fertile and original men I have ever
known. He is credited with work
ing out most of the microwave
techniques used during the war."
Dr. Hansen was co-inventor of
the klystron, one of the first instru
ments for producing high - power
microwaves. Invention of the klys
tron, in turn, was one of the most
vital steps toward the perfection of
modern radar.
A Stanford graduate at the age of
20, Dr. Hansen joined the faculty
when he was 21, and soon earned
the Ph.D. in physics. His first ob
jective in scientific work was to find
a more effective way to smash
atoms, and in 1934 he invented a
cavity resonator, then known as the
rhumbatron.
