The Joft're Debate originally hon
■ ored Sadi Carnot, martyred presi

; called the Medaille Carnot. But in

' French war hero. Marshal Joft're.
The debate, which is the oldest
dual college competition in the
United States, always covers some
; phase of French policy. This year
! the topic is contemporary French
political philosophies. Two hours
before the debate, a specific ques

j neous.
