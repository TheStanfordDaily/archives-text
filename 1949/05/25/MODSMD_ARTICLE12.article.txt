# Recent Astronomy Progress Described to Phi Beta Kappas

Beyond the galaxy of stars into
" Fhe World of the Nebulae,'" man
! looks back into time as well as far !
into external space. Dr. Charles D.
Shane, director of Lick Observatory
at the University of California, de
scribed recent scientific progress in
astronomy as the Phi Beta Kappa 1
address on the Tuesday Evening !
Series program last night.
On'y in the 20th century did man !
uncover the mystery of the nebulae :
as being bodies beyond our stellar !
system, explained Dr. Shane. Sir •
William Herschel and Herbert !
Spencer were early pioneers in the '
astronomical study of the 18th and j
19th ctnturies. But no great impe- I
tus for serious study came until the
improvements in modern photogra
phy.
Through giant telescopes the neb- \
ulae t-.n k shape: some were gaseous
masses, part of our stellar system;
others had black bands of absorb
ing matter that blotted out part of i
! the soiral structure.

From Mt. Wilson Observatory j
i scientists viewed individual stars j
around the nebulae, Magellan's j
Cloud. The cloudlike haze was sup
posedly first sighted by Magellan's
sailors in the southern hemisphere.
| Some nebulae are so vast that a
! star on one side cannot be seen on i
| the other for many thousands of i
years. When scientists here sight
| some of the nebulae, they are look
j ing back into time as well as out
into space.
Over 400 people attending the lec
-1 ture gathered outside beneath the
j Dipper to discuss the slides and to
| see if they could find a hazy patch
of light like a cluster of stars.
Wives, parents, and husbands of
| the Phi Beta Kappa initiates started
j for the Women's Clubhouse for the
initiation ceremony and reception.
Eighty-seven students—the top six |
per cent of the graduating class— I
i were admitted into Phi Beta Kappa j
I last niirht. 1
