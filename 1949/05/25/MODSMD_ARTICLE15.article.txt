# Microwave Laboratory To House Atom Smasher
## 
### WALLY WHITE 

Looking like a long, modernized
{ greenhouse, the new building that
houses the Stanford Microwave Lab
j artory has inconspicuously taken its
i place just south of Sequoia Hall.
The $170,000 building was con
j structed as a home for the labora
| tory's proposed electron linear ac
i celerator. When completed, the ac
| celerator, an atom smasher, will be
160 feet long and is expected to be
; capable of generating 400.00o.000
j electron volts.
The new building, 300 feet long
and 80 feet wide, is divided into
j three bays.
The center bay, rising above the
; other two, is a long, high tunnel. It
will hold the accelerator, which will
be shielded by lead sheets and con- !
crete blocks. A second, smaller bay

runs along the west side and con
tains shops. The third, on the east
side, is divided into offices and small
laboratories.
Acoustic tile covers the ceilings of
the offices to cut out the noise of
the accelerator. Without this insula
tion, explained Dr. Ginzton, it would
be impossible to work there.
Plywood walls throughout can
easily be moved if a room rearrange
ment is desired. Over half of the
outer wall space is glass.
The microwave Laboratory has
now moved its equipment and per
sonnel from their old quarters in
the Physics Building. But, says Dr.
Ginzton. it will be two years at the
very least before the accelerator is
completed. At present the large cen
tral bay stands vacant except for
scattered equipment.
