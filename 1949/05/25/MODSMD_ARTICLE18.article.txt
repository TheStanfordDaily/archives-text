# Model Assembly Friday Will Hear UN Delegate
## 
### 
The West Coast will see its first
Model General Assembly this Fri
day, when Stanford will iniiiate <
tradition that Eastern and Mid
western colleges have been prac
ticing for many years.
The procedure of the Genera! As
sembly of the United Nations will
be realistically enacted at the Frost
Amphitheater, as over two hundred
Stanford students will participate
in delegations to represent the
views oi the member-nations ol the
UN on the "North Atlantic Pact."
Although such universities as
Cornell and Yale have been staging
model assemblies on international
affairs ever since the First World
War, Stanford is unique in having
â– >n actual member of the United
Nations as the main speaker at its
assemb'y.
Dr. Charles Malik, Lebanese del
egate, is flying from New York to
speak at the Stanford Model As
sembly. In addition to the promi
nent figure of Dr. Malik, foreign
consulates in San Francisco will
also be represented at the Assem
bly.
