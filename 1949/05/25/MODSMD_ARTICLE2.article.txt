# 'Z' Day Alters Call Letters For Stanford's Station KSU
## 
### MARY E. HILL 
Something new in KSU! It's still "Your Stanford Station," but
it's not KSU any more .... it's KZSU. The new call letters,
which were registered May 11 by the Federal Communications
Commission, take effect today, according to Steve Phillips,
KZSU general manager.
When the station went on the air in January, 1947, "KSU" was

the call for a small station in Texas.<
The conflict, however, was over
looked by the FCC until Stanford
could obtain new call letters, since
college "carrier current" stations
such as KZSU are not licensed.
It has been definitely known for
over a year the '"KSU" would have
to go. The Texas station has since
become inoperative, but the Federal
Communications Commission will
not assign any more three-letter
calls.
"Almost two years of vain effort
has been spent trying to find call let
ters which were not previously reg
istered," said Phillips. The station
has submitted over 40 potential set
of call letters. The great increase
in AM, FM, and TV stations, how
ever, has made few call letters avail
able.
Phillips added that this registra
tion has no bearing on the current
FCC proposal to change the rules for
college "wired wireless" stations.
The registration was done through
the Intercollegiate Broadcasting
System as a courtesy by the FCC.
