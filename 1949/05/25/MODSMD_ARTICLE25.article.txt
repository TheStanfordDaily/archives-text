# Advanced ROTC Students To Get Intensified Training
## 
### 
It's the Army life this summer for
about 50 Army and Air Force ROTC
students who have completed the
first year advanced course.
The cadets will spend six weeks
at Army training centex-s, going to
classes and gleaning practical expe
rience in their chosen military field.
For this training, a requirement
for receiving a reserve commission
upon graduation, the cadets are paid
$75 per month plus travel expenses.
Twenty-two members of the Field
Artillery ROTC and five from the
Quartermaster ROTC will arrive at
Fort Lewis, Wash., on June 18.
There they will attend classes super
vised by the Second Infantry and
work with Artillery and QMC
equipment.
Air Force cadets will travel east

ward. Statistical Control (adminis
tration) students will go to Lowry
Field, Colo., and Maintenance stu
dents to Chanute Field, 111., on
June 27.
Both these fields are regular Air
Force officers' training schools. The
22 cadets from Stanford, said Cap
tain Clarence A. Strawn of the Air
ROTC, will go through the same
training, in a condensed form, as Air
Force officers. They will work with
millions of dollars worth of the
latest equipment, he said.
Weekends are free. At Fort Lewis
cadets will dance Saturday nights
and take in sightseeing tours on
Sundays. The field's golf, tennis,
swimming, and movie facilities will
be open to them.
