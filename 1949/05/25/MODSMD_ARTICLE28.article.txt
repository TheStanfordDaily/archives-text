## Eating Club Progress 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs are on the way back to pre-war
strength. The groups were crippled and threatened with extinc
tion a few years ago when the University condemned and dis
mantled the club eating facilities. As a result, the clubs' exis
tence became precarious because they had no central organiza
lion except an Encina dining table.
Although the clubs' members still eat in Encina Commons, the
men are reviving the clubs by formulating plans for new dining
halls and meeting rooms to house the organizations.
Here are some of the recent developments in the eating club
housing situation:
1. The interclub council voted tentatively Monday night in
favor of single kitchens and dining rooms for each club.
2. The Board of Trustees took note Thursday of the eating
clubs' requests that they be permitted to build new facilities. No
specific proposals were considered by the Trustees, however,
because no concrete building plan has been drawn up and no
method for financing the project has been developed.
3. Dr. Sterling, Dean Kimpton, and eating club officers will
meet next week to discuss their building program. Dr. Sterling
ihen will be able to present recommendations to the Trustees.
With eating club dining facilities still in the discussion stage,
the groups have a great deal more planning to do before any
ground can be broken for new buildings.
We feel that the existence of eating clubs at Stanford is con
structive. For men who do not wish to join fraternities nor be
come lost in dormitory life, the clubs offer members a better
chance to participate in Farm social life.
It is heartening to see alumni and student members of the
eating clubs take the constructive interest in their organizations
that they have demonstrated in the past year.
