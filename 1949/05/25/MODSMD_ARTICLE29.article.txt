## Blocks for Crew 
### 
To the Editor:
John Hall's article on crew in yesterday's paper is a masterpiece of
journalistic nescience. His sterling analysis, if 1 may be so euphemistic,
displays a decided ignorance of the facts.
Hall says we don t have a schedule to follow; we don't even know who or
if we'll be rowing next year. Maybe he doesn't know. I do; we'll be row
ing! Along with the other crews on the Coast, we have tentative plans
for the coming year, but won't set definite dates until around the first of
the year. We will row SC on the date of the Cal-Washington race, and meet
Cal on the Estuary sometime in May. We will probably meet Oregon
State and the San Francisco rowing clubs. OXir schedule for this year
has been set since February. Hall's ignorance of the existence of any
schedule arrangements does not preclude the possibility of their existence.
The "old big iour" that Hall speaks of as the sports which a lot of
people would like to see as the only acceptable major sports consisted of
football, crew, baseball, and track 30 years ago here at Stanford. Of this
he is apparently unaware.
Hall says the sport lacks tradition. He probably will not be pleased to
learn that it is the oldest intercollegiate sport in the country, and one
of the first major sports at Stanford. It might chill him, as he seems par
ticularly susceptible to cold. Crew is a major sport everywhere except
at Stanford.
Hall states that the crew lacks strength. In the past two years, Stan
ford has swept to victories over UCLA, San Diego, three San Francisco
rowing clubs, a double win over SC, and has lost twice to Cal. the world
champs, this year by only nine seconds. In my mind, that is a fair dem
onstration of athletic prowess and strength.
Hall declares that the crew lacks a future. Later he suggests we wait
until we've been to Poughkeepsie a few more times, develop a bigger
and better course, and gain recognition from the athletic department after
we've maintained a good schedule for a couple of years. Looks like a
pretty good future to me.
The naive comparison of crew to ping-pong and chess is puerile and
unworthy of comment.
The lack of backing by the athletic department is extraneous to the
question at hand, and has no bearing on the worthiness of the crew to
receive block letters.
The anomalies and misrepresentations of fact contained in Hall's offer
ing would take more space than it is worth to refute. Suffice it to say
that he knows not whereof he speaks.
