# University of Washington Hearings

To ihc Editor:
If you will investigate the hearings at Washington you will find that
they were conducted not for the purpose of proving that the two profes
sors were unobjective in their teaching, but for the sole purpose of proving
that they were members of the Communist Party, a party which has
not yet been outlawed by the United States.
To my knowledge there has been no attempt to prove that Communist
professors preach Communism any more than Republican professors
.preach Republicanism.
