### Priscilla Claudius 
If Robert Benchley had only lived
to play the part of Mr. Banks, the
father of the bride, the coming
Hollywood production of this story i
would be perfect. For this is a story
which convincingly dramatizes the
old saying "it is Papa who pays."
This is the very amusing story, j
cleverly balanced with humor and '
pathos. Air. Banks' life is turned j
upside down when his daughter, !
Kay, falls in love. Author Streeter
carries our hero through every step
of the romance, from the announce- I
ment to the aftermath of the recep- I
tion.
Mr. Banks is behind the eight ball
from the start. Blessed with an ad
dle-brained, small-town wife, and a
daughter who is exactly like her
mother, Mr. Banks and his check
book are caught in the middle of
everything.
This is indeed the story of the for
gotten man. Because Mrs. Banks
and Kay are so engrossed in their j
plans, they never stop to realize, or
sympathize with the anguished Mr.
Banks. Worst of all, when the time
of the wedding finally arrives, after
Mr. Banks has suffered sleepless
nights, spent hours of planning, run
a thousand errands, paid a fortune
in bills, no one notices him. When,
during the reception, he asks for
one glass out of all the champagne
he has paid for, the bartender eyeij
him coldly.
As the sad story progresses, Mr.
Banks takes on the character of a
desperate, trapped animal. He even
resorts to offering his beloved
daughter 51,500 to elope. By the time
the last guests have left the recep
tion. Mr. Banks is a complete wreck.
The exhausted couple finally find
themselves alone in the ruins that
was their home before the great on
slaught of romance. It is all over, a
memory to Mrs. Banks, a nightmare
to Mr. Banks.
The many illustrations of Gluyas
Williams add the finishing touches j
to the story. Perhaps it is merely
that Williams did most of the illus
trations for the books of Robert
Benchley that give the reader a
faint impression that Benchley
would have written just such a book. !
The pathetically amusing, the kind- !
hearted but frustrated little man ap
pears as the hero of this story, just
as Benchley often portrayed himself.
Streeter has an extremely subtle
style in presenting his humor. Al
though it is amusing throughout. I
the humor of the book is never over- j
done. In the last scene, Streeter
brings out the last satiric twist to
the story. The exhausted parents
are alone:
"On the floor near the edge of the
rug Mr. Banks spied a few bits of
confetti that the cleaning man had
overlooked. He rose to pick them j
up. There seemed to be more just
under the edge. He turned back the
corner and disclosed a mat of multi
colored paper. Without comment he
dropped the rug back into place, i
Mrs. Banks was watching but said |
nothing. He went quietly up to the i
bathroom and drew the cork in the j
last remaining bottle."

If Robert Benchley had only lived
to play the part of Mr. Banks, the
father of the bride, the coming
Hollywood production of this story i
would be perfect. For this is a story
which convincingly dramatizes the
old saying "it is Papa who pays."
This is the very amusing story, j
cleverly balanced with humor and '
pathos. Air. Banks' life is turned j
upside down when his daughter, !
Kay, falls in love. Author Streeter
carries our hero through every step
of the romance, from the announce- I
ment to the aftermath of the recep- I
tion.
Mr. Banks is behind the eight ball
from the start. Blessed with an ad
dle-brained, small-town wife, and a
daughter who is exactly like her
mother, Mr. Banks and his check
book are caught in the middle of
everything.
This is indeed the story of the for
gotten man. Because Mrs. Banks
and Kay are so engrossed in their j
plans, they never stop to realize, or
sympathize with the anguished Mr.
Banks. Worst of all, when the time
of the wedding finally arrives, after
Mr. Banks has suffered sleepless
nights, spent hours of planning, run
a thousand errands, paid a fortune
in bills, no one notices him. When,
during the reception, he asks for
one glass out of all the champagne
he has paid for, the bartender eyeij
him coldly.
As the sad story progresses, Mr.
Banks takes on the character of a
desperate, trapped animal. He even
resorts to offering his beloved
daughter 51,500 to elope. By the time
the last guests have left the recep
tion. Mr. Banks is a complete wreck.
The exhausted couple finally find
themselves alone in the ruins that
was their home before the great on
slaught of romance. It is all over, a
memory to Mrs. Banks, a nightmare
to Mr. Banks.
The many illustrations of Gluyas
Williams add the finishing touches j
to the story. Perhaps it is merely
that Williams did most of the illus
trations for the books of Robert
Benchley that give the reader a
faint impression that Benchley
would have written just such a book. !
The pathetically amusing, the kind- !
hearted but frustrated little man ap
pears as the hero of this story, just
as Benchley often portrayed himself.
Streeter has an extremely subtle
style in presenting his humor. Al
though it is amusing throughout. I
the humor of the book is never over- j
done. In the last scene, Streeter
brings out the last satiric twist to
the story. The exhausted parents
are alone:
"On the floor near the edge of the
rug Mr. Banks spied a few bits of
confetti that the cleaning man had
overlooked. He rose to pick them j
up. There seemed to be more just
under the edge. He turned back the
corner and disclosed a mat of multi
colored paper. Without comment he
dropped the rug back into place, i
Mrs. Banks was watching but said |
nothing. He went quietly up to the i
bathroom and drew the cork in the j
last remaining bottle."
