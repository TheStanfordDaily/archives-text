One of the classic "pep-talks"
stories is told on Michigan's great
football coach, "Hurry Up" Yost.
| Yost, as well as being a brilliant
strategist, was a firm believer in
; dressing room oratory.
During half time of one important
game, lie pulled out all the stops in
i a fervent plea for victory. The
players sat enthralled as Coach Yost
j poured it on.
"Go out that door to victory," the
I fiery coach screamed. So carried
! away was he that Yost pointed to
I the wrong door.
! The Michigan players, fired to a
1 fever pitch, dashed headlong into
the swimming pool, and, encum
bered with heavy football gear, nar
, rowly escaped drowning.
