## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Three separate testing centers are
in full-time operation on the Stan
ford campus. One, housed in Tem
porary Building C, is the most fa
miliar to students. It is through
this office, under the direction of Dr.
Robert N. Bush of the appointment
service, that the Stanford Aptitude
Test, the pre-legal and pre-medical
exams, and the graduate record
exam are given.
Another office housed in the "tb's"
is the Veterans' Guidance Center,
under the direction of George D.
Barahal. Services of this office cen
ter around the vocational guidance
based upon tests and personal inter

The third office gives one test only,
the Strong Vocational Interest Test.
It is located in the Physics Corner
and any student may take the test.
The Strong Test, which was de
veloped at Stanford by Dr. Edward
Strong, measures relative vocational
interests by comparing those of the
person being tested with those of

such as medicine, law, journalism
or teaching. Considered one of the

Strong lest is used in the vocational
guidance center and the men's and
women's counseling departments
throughout the nation.
The Stanford Aptitude Test in use
at the present time, according to Dr.
Bush, was developed at Stanford to
lit Stanford needs. Different tests
have been used throughout the
years, he said, but they have alwavs

been used as a means of measuring
scholastic aptitude, not knowledge.
That is, the test is used along with
an applicant's previous record to
predict how well he could do uni
versity work of the type required
here.
Though "tailor made" for Stanford,
the aptitude test is required for ad
mittance to Scripps and Menlo col
leges, and many persons take it
every year and request that their
scores be sent to various colleges
throughout the country.
Mrs. Anne Severin, secretary in
the testing office, reports that the
test is given in February and
March every year at a number of
different places in California, Ore
gon. and Washington. It is admin
istered just before registration every
quarter at Stanford.
