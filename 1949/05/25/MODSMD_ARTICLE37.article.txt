# Colorful Czech Opera to Open Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford lias waited eight years to
give the colorful Czech folk opera
Shvanda," which will run Thurs
day, Friday, Saturday, and Monday
;.t 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
Ever since "The Bartered Bride''
was given here in 1941. plans for
"Shvanda" have been made and then
postponed. The opera is similar to
The Bartered Bride.'' whose per
formance was very successful.
In 1941 Stanford did not have an
orchestra which could play the
score, which calls for (?1 pieces. The
music, while based on folk tunes,
has modern orchestration.
During the war it was impossible
to buy tiie 500 yards of material
needed to make over 150 costumes
.or the play. After the war much
the same thing continued.
After the success of "Peter
Grimes' hist year, it was realized
the orchestra could handle the
'Shvanda" score. The opera oi
hestra, the full (30 pieces, cannot
be increased again unless the or
chestra pit is enlarged. Materials
for the costumes had again returned
to the market.
So, after eight years, Weinberger's
opera will at last appear on the
Stanford stage. It will also be given
jit the San Francisco Opera House
on June 2.
A Stanford production will be the
West Coast premier for "Shvanda."
It is one of the most popular cen
tral European operas of the 20th
century. It was written in 1927.
Jaromir Weinberger, the compose)*,
was born in Prague in 1896 and is
now living in this country, where
he has become a citizen.
The Metropolitan presented this
Dpera in 1931-32. While the work
was praised, the performance was
considered too ponderous for its gay
music. Since then Weinberger's
work has been known to American
udiences only through orchestra
excerpts such as "Under the Spread
ing Chestnut Tree."
Tickets are $1.20 at the Memorial
Hall box office.
