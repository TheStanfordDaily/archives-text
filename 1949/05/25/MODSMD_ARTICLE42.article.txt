# Forty-four Entries Signed Up For 'Biggest Ever' Spring Sing
## 
### 
On June 3, Stanford's vocally tal
ented living groups of songsters will
present the annual Spring Sing.
This year's Sing promises one of
the most varied and certainly the
longest program in the history of
the event, according to Lynn Pow
ell and Craig Stolle, co-chairmen.
Everything from the sentimental
strains of "Hills of Home" to the
boisterous "Whiskey and Stanford
Women" will tickle the ears of the
expected capacity crowd in Frost
Amphitheater. Last - minute sign
ups have swelled the total number
of entries to an unprecedented 44.
Late signups have also made pos
sible the opening of a new Mixed

division now boasts three entries.
