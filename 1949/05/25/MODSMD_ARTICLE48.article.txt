## Only 'Big Four' Deserve Block 'S', So... How About Three Groups of Sports? 
### JOHN BREIER 
Excom members will vote on an important proposal tonight when that
group considers the crew's bid to become eligible for the Bloek S award.
If Excom approves this plan, crew will join an already overloaded major
sport group.
Stanford sports are now divided into an unsatisfactory major or minor
class. Some sports have outgrown the minor class and have been pro
moted to major standing at different times. Each time Excom has promised
that "this is the last one, the last addition to major sports.''
Time was that a wearer of the Block S was an athlete in one of the
big four sports—football, basketball, track, and baseball. That is as it
should be. But tennis, golf, and swimming outgrew the minor sports
class and looked to new fields. Excom passed their applications in weak
moments and they became major sports.
I think there should be three classes of sports. A major, a middle class
(call it major-minor or minor-major if you wish), and a minor class.
Swimming, golf, and track could be dropped a rank into the middle class
and crew could battle it out for a place in either of the secondary groups.
But crew as a major sport? No! It was a major sport at Stanford once
upon a time but the student body voted it out in 1919 by a popular vote.
Financial trouble was the cause at that time.
Crew, again, this is just my opinion, is not ready to take a place even
in the second group I have suggested.
Now they are trying to get something they don't deserve, something they
are not ready for. Crewmen think the iron is hot. They, or their ad
herents, are taking a back-handed slap at A 1 Masters in trying to get this
move through Excom.
What is a major sport without official recognition? Stanford is not
financially able to support crew at this time. Give them major sport let
ters and then you will hear the cries for money, money, money.
In short, the crewmen are taking advantage of the sympathy generated
by the title "orphan crew," and capitalizing on the ill-feeling toward the
school for not giving financial support.
I like to know that when I see a man with a Bloek S sweater I am
seeing an athlete who earned his letter in one of the four "major" sports
recognized throughout the nation.
It only cheapens the letter to give it out so promiscuously. It is a real
honor to wear the letter and there are many advantages to owning one—
preferred tickets to football games, consideration in selling hard-to-get
tickets, etc.
Crew is doing itself damage in trying to edge into the Block S society at
this time. Many other sports have been working for years to get out
of the minor sports class and have been giving the student body good
entertainment while so doing. Now crew is trying to jump over them
into the sacred circle of the past Stanford greats.

It only cheapens the letter to give it out so promiscuously. It is a real
honor to wear the letter and there are many advantages to owning one—
preferred tickets to football games, consideration in selling hard-to-get
tickets, etc.
Crew is doing itself damage in trying to edge into the Block S society at
this time. Many other sports have been working for years to get out
of the minor sports class and have been giving the student body good
entertainment while so doing. Now crew is trying to jump over them
into the sacred circle of the past Stanford greats.

Excom members will vote on an important proposal tonight when that
group considers the crew's bid to become eligible for the Bloek S award.
If Excom approves this plan, crew will join an already overloaded major
sport group.
Stanford sports are now divided into an unsatisfactory major or minor
class. Some sports have outgrown the minor class and have been pro
moted to major standing at different times. Each time Excom has promised
that "this is the last one, the last addition to major sports.''
Time was that a wearer of the Block S was an athlete in one of the
big four sports—football, basketball, track, and baseball. That is as it
should be. But tennis, golf, and swimming outgrew the minor sports
class and looked to new fields. Excom passed their applications in weak
moments and they became major sports.
I think there should be three classes of sports. A major, a middle class
(call it major-minor or minor-major if you wish), and a minor class.
Swimming, golf, and track could be dropped a rank into the middle class
and crew could battle it out for a place in either of the secondary groups.
But crew as a major sport? No! It was a major sport at Stanford once
upon a time but the student body voted it out in 1919 by a popular vote.
Financial trouble was the cause at that time.
Crew, again, this is just my opinion, is not ready to take a place even
in the second group I have suggested.
Now they are trying to get something they don't deserve, something they
are not ready for. Crewmen think the iron is hot. They, or their ad
herents, are taking a back-handed slap at A 1 Masters in trying to get this
move through Excom.
What is a major sport without official recognition? Stanford is not
financially able to support crew at this time. Give them major sport let
ters and then you will hear the cries for money, money, money.
In short, the crewmen are taking advantage of the sympathy generated
by the title "orphan crew," and capitalizing on the ill-feeling toward the
school for not giving financial support.
I like to know that when I see a man with a Bloek S sweater I am
seeing an athlete who earned his letter in one of the four "major" sports
recognized throughout the nation.
