# Card Battery men, Fielders Meet Today In Intra-squad Baseball (?) Contest
## Castagnoli, Arce Tangle on Mound 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Game time is 3:15 today in the '
Sunken Diamond for a topsy-turvy ,
baseball game that finds Stanford's j
pitchers and catchers battling the I
nfielders and outfielders. Everyone ;
is going to switch from the position
he has played during the season to |
a new position.
Jim Castagnoli, who has been |
calling signals for the chuckers all j
season, will get his chance to show
what he can do when he opens on i
the mound for the batterymen. As
sistant Coach Charlie Bushong will
work behind the dish, receiving
Castagnoli's slants.
Captain Bill Arce will at last get
his long-sought chance to pitch a j
college baseball tilt, when he toes j
the rubber for the fielders. Arce. j
like Castagnoli, holds a one win and ,
no loss record from high school, and j
"Bouncing Bi!l" has all the inten
tions in the world of keeping his \
record unblemished.
Hard-hitting Dave Melton has
offered his services behind the
plate and promises to turn in a
snappy catching job. Melton will
probably swing from his regular
clean-up spot in the hatting order.
The batterymen's infield starts oft I
with powerful Dave Dahle holding
down the initial sack. Dahle's
clutch hitting is expected to add i
plenty of punch to the batting order.
Second baseman Jack Heinen is
also figured to be an important cog
in the batterymen's murderers' row.
Jack batted clean-up for the JV's ;
'ast year and has one of the Indians'
five home-runs this season to his
credit.
Dave Slott. who is said to look
like another Marty Marion at
shortstop, will be Heinen's key
stone mate. Stott has looked sharp
in practice this week, and he and
Heinen plan to chalk up a couple
of double killings before this af
ternoon's fray is ended.
Rounding out this air-tight in
field will be Frank Laßrum at the
Hot Corner. Frank is a smooth
fielder and is dangerous at all times
with a bat in his hands.
Bud Klein will open at first base
for the fielders. Bud has been hit
ting the ball hard and often in his !
last few outings and promises to
be in the opposition's hair all af
ternoon.
The fielders' double play combi
nation will be built around long
John Claypool at second and Chuck
Co'e at shortstop. Cole is also '
counted on to do mound duty in
case Arce runs into trouble. Cole
' is a cagey southpaw, and he will
j eive the batterymen a bad time if
| he has to go to the hill.
Blasting Bob Nava will be play
ing third base in this red-hot in
field. Bob is going to be counted
on to do much of the heavy stick
work for the fielders.
Jim Claypool, Frank MacGraw,

and Bill Herron will patrol the
outer gardens for the batterymen.
Claypool played some outfield in
his high school days and Herron
played in last year's freshman out
field.
Frank MacGraw is going to be
ready to do a little chucking too. it'
he is called upon. Mac was tossing
a batting practice yesterday, and he
said that his pitching arm was in
great shape.
Bruce Cameron, Dick Clegg, and
Bob Larson will do the ball hawk
ing for the fielders.
