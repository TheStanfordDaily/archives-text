# Indian Tennis Team Matched Against the Top-Ranking Dons
## 
### DAN WINSTON 
It will be a case of a good tennis j
team against the giants of the colle- |
giate tennis world today when the !
Stanford Indians take on the Dons
of USF at Golden Gate Park at 2 ;
p.m.
Make no mistake about it—the I
Cards are a good tennis team; but j
USF is the best tennis squad in
the nation.
A week ago the Indians would j
not have been given a chance to
take a match from the Dons, but
after the good showing the Farm
netters put up against USC Satur
day they can't be counted out en
tirely.
Bob Lewis and Kirke Mechem
will have the toughest assignments
today. They run into Sam Match
and Art Larsen, the two ranking
amateurs in the collegiate tennis
ranks and the reason that USF is
rated as number one nationally.
Even after the first two matches
are over the Dons will still be
tough. Other teams have outstand
ing players, but no other team has
the over-all strength that the Hill
toppers possess.
Stanford will be the underdogs,
but they could give the Dons some
argument. Saturday the Indians lost
by the proverbial skin of their eye
teeth to a heavily favored USC

team. The Trojans lost to USF by a
count of G to 3.
On the basis of their last showings
the improving Indians should grab
a match or two and if the Cards aU
play up to form they could give thi
Dons a bad afternoon.

Singles—(l) Kirke Mechem, (2">
Bob Ix;wis, (3) Errol Lycette. (4)
Fred Lewi . (5) Lucien Barbour,
(G) Vince Schmieder.
