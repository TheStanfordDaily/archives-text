# Release on SC Vote Delayed
## 
### 
Election results on the USC presi
dential referendum vote will not be
released until tomorrow, the Asso
ciated Press reported last night.
Outcome of the balloting will not
be made public until an official re
port has presented to the ASSC
Senate. Voting began Friday and
ended today.
In past elections the ASSC elec
tions hoard has given day-by-day
voting results. The Senate had ruled
last week, however, that no voting
figures would be released until the
entire election had ended.
The referendum was held because
USC students petitioned that there
was evidence of graft in the presi
dential election held two weeks ago.
If the referendum passes, another
student body presidential election
will be held at the beginning of the
autumn semester.
