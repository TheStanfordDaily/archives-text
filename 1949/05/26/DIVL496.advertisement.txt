In anybody's book, one of them
is Wishbone Harris. Said TIME'S
issue of August 18, 1947:
}
In New Orleans, ex-Vale backfiekl
coach E;irle ("Greasy"') Xeale ran
into a 6-ft. 230-lb. Minnesotan named
Wishbone Harris, who played tacki. 1
on the Vale football squad in 1933.
"What are you doing now?" asked
when the backslapping wu->
over. "I'm selling women's home kits
for permanent waves." said Wishbone.
Greasy grinned and said: "Now to-'
me what you're really doing.'' "I'm
celling home kits for permanent
waves." replied Wishbone, and dog
| gedly added: "And doing very well."
Richard Xeison Wishbone Harris
was making an understatement. I:
three years, he has built his "Ton:"'
home permanent-wave kits into a mer
chandising phenomenon which this
year will gross an estimated $16 mil
lion and net a tidy $3 million profit,
enough to curl anyone's hair. By
shrewd advertising (1947 budget: $3.5
million). Harris has captured 50' c of
the home-wave market.*
Toni's Harris
"And doing very well."
Harris, who has long since tired of
telling folks that Wishbone is no nick
name, is the son of a prosperous St.
Paul woolen merchant. The year after
his graduation in 1036, he picked up x
beautv-supply business for $5,000. In
1941. when cold waves began to at
tract attention in beauty shops, Harris
began wholesaling them. Two years
later, some of his pioneering competi
tors began experimenting-with home
wave kits. The first one, w hich sold foe
5'^<» w 'as a big seller, but it nearly
ruined the market because it was un
;atisfactory. Harris kept trying-, finally
came up with Toni.
Wishbone's success is partly due to
\ lesson he learned several years ago
He had experimented with a cold
ivave set. It was a stupendous flop.
Says Wishbone: "I found out then
that people just won't pay twobits for
>omething they have been paying $10
md $15 tor. It it's that cheap, it's n*>
4ood. in their minds."
*f>t 1 Q4$, Harris sold The Toui Co.,
'.hen selling about 85% of all horn -
wave kits in the U.S., to the Gillett
Safety Razor Co., for $20,000,000; h

In anybody's book, one of them
is Wishbone Harris. Said TIME'S
issue of August 18, 1947:
}
In New Orleans, ex-Vale backfiekl
coach E;irle ("Greasy"') Xeale ran
into a 6-ft. 230-lb. Minnesotan named
Wishbone Harris, who played tacki. 1
on the Vale football squad in 1933.
"What are you doing now?" asked
when the backslapping wu->
over. "I'm selling women's home kits
for permanent waves." said Wishbone.
Greasy grinned and said: "Now to-'
me what you're really doing.'' "I'm
celling home kits for permanent
waves." replied Wishbone, and dog
| gedly added: "And doing very well."
Richard Xeison Wishbone Harris
was making an understatement. I:
three years, he has built his "Ton:"'
home permanent-wave kits into a mer
chandising phenomenon which this
year will gross an estimated $16 mil
lion and net a tidy $3 million profit,
enough to curl anyone's hair. By
shrewd advertising (1947 budget: $3.5
million). Harris has captured 50' c of
the home-wave market.*
Toni's Harris

Harris, who has long since tired of
telling folks that Wishbone is no nick
name, is the son of a prosperous St.
Paul woolen merchant. The year after
