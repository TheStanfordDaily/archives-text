# Dow Carpenter Captures 55th Joffre Debate
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Dow Carpenter of Stanford won
tlie world-famous Joffre Debate last
night, as an audience of 300 crowded
Cubberley Auditorium.
For Stanford it was the "rubber"
victory in the 55-year-old rivalry.
Each team had won 27 of the annual
debates. For Carpenter it was the
second try for the Medaille Joffre.
Last year the 21-year-old pre-legal
major captured second place in a
close race with Cal's Leonard Hes
terman.
Second place in the top debate
meet of the year went to Fred Har
vey of the University of California.
Debate captain Jack Marcum of
Stanford won third place.
The question for the evening,
which was announced two hours be
fore the first speeches began, was
"Resolved: That the French Repub
lic will be crushed between Gaull
ism and Communism." Dr. Alan
Nichols, director of debate at USC
formulated the thesis, and each man
chose the side he wished to defend.
Carpenter's Speech
Carpenter, speaking for the nega
tive, demonstrated how the "third
force, the coalition government, is
leading France." He said that since
194ti, when France was threatened
by strikes and economic disorder,
the compromise government had
been a unifying force. And as this
coalition was strengthened, the
Communists and the extremists un
der General DeGaulle were de
creasing in numbers and in popu
larity.
Marcum, in his negative opening
speech, quoted numerous figures to
illustrate an increase in French po
litical and economic security—the
basis of the "third force unity."
Both Richard Miller of Cal and
Art Herzog, affirmative, emphasized
the ultimate downfall of the French
Republic which they said would lead
to supreme control by either the ex
tremists of the right or the extrem
ists of the left.
Diversity, Not Unity
Harvey, the second place winner
who defended the negative, pointed
to the pluralistic nature of the
French political scene. He said "I'm
in favor of diversity, not unity. Di
versity leads to a compromise, and
■with it a survival of the third force."
M. Andre Rousselet, vice-consul
of France in San Francisco, pre
sented the Medaille Joffre to Car
penter and then introduced side
lights of the Joffre question. He ad
mitted jokingly that he favored the
negative side of the question and
said that the political situation in
France was vastly improved.
Dr. Clarence Faust, who was
chairman of the debate, also intro
duced President of the Alliance
Francaise M. Roger Debbaudt.

Stanford won third place.
The question for the evening,
which was announced two hours be
fore the first speeches began, was
"Resolved: That the French Repub
lic will be crushed between Gaull
ism and Communism." Dr. Alan
Nichols, director of debate at USC
formulated the thesis, and each man
chose the side he wished to defend.
Carpenter's Speech
Carpenter, speaking for the nega
tive, demonstrated how the "third
force, the coalition government, is
leading France." He said that since
194ti, when France was threatened
by strikes and economic disorder,
the compromise government had
been a unifying force. And as this
coalition was strengthened, the
Communists and the extremists un
der General DeGaulle were de
creasing in numbers and in popu
larity.
Marcum, in his negative opening
speech, quoted numerous figures to
illustrate an increase in French po
litical and economic security—the
basis of the "third force unity."
Both Richard Miller of Cal and
Art Herzog, affirmative, emphasized
the ultimate downfall of the French
Republic which they said would lead
to supreme control by either the ex
tremists of the right or the extrem
ists of the left.
Diversity, Not Unity
Harvey, the second place winner
who defended the negative, pointed
to the pluralistic nature of the
French political scene. He said "I'm
in favor of diversity, not unity. Di
versity leads to a compromise, and
■with it a survival of the third force."
M. Andre Rousselet, vice-consul
of France in San Francisco, pre
sented the Medaille Joffre to Car
penter and then introduced side
lights of the Joffre question. He ad
mitted jokingly that he favored the
negative side of the question and
said that the political situation in
France was vastly improved.
Dr. Clarence Faust, who was
chairman of the debate, also intro
duced President of the Alliance
Francaise M. Roger Debbaudt.
Dow Carpenter of Stanford won

victory in the 55-year-old rivalry.
Each team had won 27 of the annual
debates. For Carpenter it was the
second try for the Medaille Joffre.

terman.

meet of the year went to Fred Har
vey of the University of California.
