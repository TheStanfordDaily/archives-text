# Wha' Hoppin' At Mariposa?

### ROWLAND REBELE 
Th joint was literally jumpin' out
at Mariposa last night.
About 6:45 p.m., just as the gals
from that house were trooping
through their front door after eat
: ing dinner at the Union, "there
j came a scream that resounded for
! miles."
"You won't believe this," one of
the still-shaky lasses said later, "but
there on the carpet were scads and
scads of little things jumping all
over the place."
"We screamed, scratched our arms
and legs wildly, and ran for cover
I as fast as we could."
Here's wha' hoppin. Evidently a
talented group of amateur Pied
Pipers had somehow led 200 half
inch tree toads into the house and
spread them about while the inno
cent young roomers were at dinner.
Among other ingenious places,
the pranksters had deposited the
jumpers into the living room, the
upstairs rooms, and—believe it or
not—into some coffee cups that hap
pened to be sitting in the kitchen.
After screwing up their courage,
the gals crept cautiously back into
the house and proceeded to root
out the "little things" by flinging
them into the garden. All this was
done to the inexpressible joy of the
evil-doers who had stationed them
selves outside strategic living room
windows to watch the fun.
