# Czech Opera ‘Shvanda’ Will Begin Run Tonight
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
An old Bohemian legend of the
bagpiper who set the whole world
dancing will come to life on the
Memorial Auditorium stage tonight
in the romantic Czech opera
"Shvanda." The performance starts
at 8:15.
The fairytale pageant will have a
60-piece orchestra, a ballet of 30
dancers, and a 45-voice chorus. The
opera is under the direction of F.
Cowles Strickland of the drama de
partment and Herbert Jan Popper
of the music department. Dancers
are from Orchesis. which is headed
by Mrs. Miriam Lidster.
Joel Carter, baritone well known
to Stanford theater-goers, will sing
the lead in the story of the bagpiper
who makes all earth, heaven, and
hell dance to his music, and who is
at last condemned to live forever,
not as a person but in the hearts of
all Czech musicians.
Miss Martina Zubiri, soprano, will
make her first appearance with the

j Stanford group in the role of j
i Shvanda's wife. She has sung with
' the San Francisco Opera Associa
| tion. Kalem Kermoyan, bass, will
j take the part of the devil. He sang
; last year in "Peter Grimes."
The part of the Ice Queen will be
1 taken by Mrs. Beta Popper, con
i tralto. Caesar Curzi, tenor member
I of the Opera Workshop, plays the
friend of Shvanda.
Sets for the opera are constructed j
,in the quaint and jaunty fashion of
! the gingerbread houses of "Hansel j
j and Gretel." The buildings with j
; their flowered shutters, the Ice Pal- !
j ace with its icicles, and even hell
I are in unusual perspective so as to
l intensify the theatrical effect of the
play.
Pink and lavender tones will add
; brightness to the stage, with blue
i overtones used for the ice scene. j
Over 150 costumes have been j
made for the performance. Czech j
i peasant costumes, with embroidered
' boleros, full skirts, and large pleat- i
i ed blouse sleeves, will twirl to the j
; polka tunes. Shades of green and !
j blue, made in costumes of the Na- j
poleonic era. will enliven the Ice j
i Palace scene.
The "dandy" devil wears a wide j
lapel on his bright maroon outfit |
j and swings his tail like a watch fob. j
j Unicorns and other unique devils
make a most unusual Hell cast.
Tickets for tonight, tomorrow, ]
Saturday, and Monday perform- !
j ances are $1.20 at the Memorial j
| Hall box office.
