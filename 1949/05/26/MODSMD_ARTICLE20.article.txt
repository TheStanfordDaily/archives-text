## No Propaganda Charge 
### 
To the Editor:
In your editorial. "Academic Freedom," you stated that a Communist
teacher "would present, out of proportion to its value, Communist pro
paganda in the classroom or seminars."
Just what the average Communist would teach in his classroom is any
body's guess, but the fact remains that the University of Washington
professors were not found guilty of such a charge by a committee of
their peers.
As for the claims made by the university presidents that Communists
<hould be precluded from teaching, because they are not "free agents," or
they are "half slaves" and "intellectually dishonest," each student should
ask himself these questions posed by another educator:
1. If a man joins an organization of his own free will and can leave
of his own free will, is he a slave?
2. Are you most likely to find the "intellectually dishonest" professor on
the side where the rewards for his convictions are scorn and loss of
employment?
