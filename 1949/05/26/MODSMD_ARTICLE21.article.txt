# No Free Agent

To the Editor:
Just a few comments on your Tuesday's editorial "Who is a 'free
agent'?"
Are we not all shaped by the society we live in? Is not every man a
partisan of his way of life? I think the answer is obvious. There is
no such thing as a "free agent."
Thus, the statement that Communists are not fit to teach, not being
"free agents," is rather absurd. By this brand of logic, one could throw
out the Catholic professors as being "slaves to dogma," and so on down
the line, ending up, perhaps, by throwing out the teacher who are "slaves
to capitalistic dogma."
A more proper concapt of a teacher is one who presents his thoughts
and opinions as "wares in the market of ideas." Unless we conceive of
the university as a rigid indoctrination course in the ideas of the status
quo, I think we must grant all men the right to present their views.
After all. what have we to fear? Students at Stanford are well able to
select their brand of politics.
