Proposed honor system at Brigham i
Young University would include
several provisions similar to Stan
ford's Honor â–  Code:
1. Indoctrination of new students
by an Honor Council.
2. Preparation of a program, by
the council, which would "bring the
tradition and principles of the Honor
Code to the attention of the stu- j
dents and faculty throughout the ;
year."
3. Complete investigation of all
reported violations by the Council, j
4. Warning of violators by pencil
tapping.
5. Record of violations and penal
ties imposed would be published in
the student newspaper, the violators S
being unnamed.
However, the proposed Brigham
Young honor system differs in one j
vital respect; while Stanford's Code
encompasses only academic work, !
Brigham Young's would consider
"all forms of dishonorable conduct"
violations of the honor code.

University of Masachusetts Presi- ;
dent Ralph V. van Meter has stated
that he would not tolerate frater
nities that choose members on the
basis of race, creed, or color. The
university's fraternities have unani
mously adopted a resolution oppos
ing "fraternal discrimination on the
basis of race, creed, or color."

An editorial in the Daily Kansan
provides a comment with a familiar
ring:
"Last week approximately 717 stu
dents 'sweated out' a three-hour ]
Western civilization examination. |
After nine months of poring over I

'many volume of forgotten lore,'
some of them probably asked them
selves, "What good is this course'?"

Cold Cruel World Department:
A San Jose State Spartan editorial
writer turned up this startling fact:
"By 1950. close lo 50,000 engineers
will be graduated from college as
against an annual replacement of
7.000."
This means there are simply more
college graduates than jobs for them
in their chosen fields. The Spartan
writer blamed the persistent Ameri
can notion of social prestige con
nected with the white collar jobs.
Soft, spoiled students concentrat
ing upon courses with ambiguous ti
tles will find themselves with clean,
but idle hands. And who will do the
dirty work?

A letter-to-thc-editor of the Co
lumbia Daily Spectator evidences
the scope of the water-pistol fad
throughout the country: . I
feel it my duty to point out that the
water pistol affair is merely one
symptom of the moral and cultural
degredation that pervades this cam
pus, where the students seem to
care about nothing but food, ath
letics, and amusement. Sui-ely, one
of the most shocking signs of our
present depravity is that President
Eisenhower, the highest official of
Columbia University, plays bridge,
for money, and that he plays this
infantile, indecent game with gov
ernment officials and other persons
of doubtful reputation."
The letter-writer's name was
withheld by request of the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution.
