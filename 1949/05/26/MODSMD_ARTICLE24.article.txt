### Priscilla Claudius 
HALFWAY TO FREEDOM by Mar
garet Bourke-White (Simon &
Schuster)
Apparently no author who under
takes a study of the political and so
cial life of India is able to view the
situation dispassionately. Margaret
Bourke-White, with more intrepid
ity than discretion, has gathered her
information from many sources.
By doing everything from walking
into agitated mobs to interview par
ticipants to buttonholing Mahara
jahs at breakfast, she has compiled
a mass of divergent viewpoints to
each of which she apparently suc
cumbs at the moment.
For example, she bitterly attacks
the Pakistan support of the Hill
tribe's invasion of Kashmir, where
a Moslem majority does exist. At
the same time she blithely white
washes the Indian government's sup
port of the Communist-inspired re
volt in Hyderabad, which led to the
government's invasion of that pri
vate principality.
But it is not on Miss White's
quixotic approach to the Indian so
cial problems that the value of the
book depends. It is, rather, her cov
erage of the political schisms, al
liances. etc., which both preceded
and followed the final split between
the All-India Congress and the
Moslem League. She has also in
cluded many astute character analy
ses of contemporary leaders. The
most complete and carefully written
of these is, of course, her study of
Gandhi.
As she so ably described Gandhi,
she still carefully established the
fact that the Mahatma's greatness
could only be felt, rather than an
alyzed. The sincere and everlasting
devotion of the members ol his
household gives some clue to the
personal magnetism of the man.
But it is only when she describes
the effect that his last fast had upon
the millions of people of all sects
does some of the true import of
his character come to light.
The decision to fast until peace
came between the warring factions
was Gandhi's own decision. Neither
Nehru nor Patel knew of it in ad
vance. And it was the great per
sonal sacrifice of this one far-from
ordinary man which resulted in all
of the main religious and political
factions sending their leaders to con
fer and sign a declaration of peace
to end Gandhi's fast.
And, following his assassination
by a member of the Fascistic R.S.S.,
a group of young Hindu extremists,
Hindus, Sikhs, Moslems, Christians,
and countless other sects joined in
the sincere and terrible grief at the
death of Gandhi. And it was this
final sacrifice which did succeed in
bringing a greater feeling of broth
erhood to the grieving nation.
The story is well supplemented
with many of Miss Bourke-White's
excellent photographs of most of
the important events of the period
of the last two stormy years in In
dian history.

erage of the political schisms, al
liances. etc., which both preceded
and followed the final split between
the All-India Congress and the
Moslem League. She has also in
cluded many astute character analy
ses of contemporary leaders. The
most complete and carefully written
of these is, of course, her study of
Gandhi.
As she so ably described Gandhi,
she still carefully established the
fact that the Mahatma's greatness
could only be felt, rather than an
alyzed. The sincere and everlasting
devotion of the members ol his
household gives some clue to the
personal magnetism of the man.
But it is only when she describes
the effect that his last fast had upon
the millions of people of all sects
does some of the true import of
his character come to light.
The decision to fast until peace
came between the warring factions
was Gandhi's own decision. Neither
Nehru nor Patel knew of it in ad
vance. And it was the great per
sonal sacrifice of this one far-from
ordinary man which resulted in all
of the main religious and political
factions sending their leaders to con
fer and sign a declaration of peace
to end Gandhi's fast.
And, following his assassination
by a member of the Fascistic R.S.S.,
a group of young Hindu extremists,
Hindus, Sikhs, Moslems, Christians,
and countless other sects joined in
the sincere and terrible grief at the
death of Gandhi. And it was this
final sacrifice which did succeed in
bringing a greater feeling of broth
erhood to the grieving nation.
The story is well supplemented
with many of Miss Bourke-White's
excellent photographs of most of
the important events of the period
of the last two stormy years in In
dian history.

HALFWAY TO FREEDOM by Mar
garet Bourke-White (Simon &
Schuster)
Apparently no author who under
takes a study of the political and so
cial life of India is able to view the
situation dispassionately. Margaret
Bourke-White, with more intrepid
ity than discretion, has gathered her
information from many sources.
By doing everything from walking
into agitated mobs to interview par
ticipants to buttonholing Mahara
jahs at breakfast, she has compiled
a mass of divergent viewpoints to
each of which she apparently suc
cumbs at the moment.
For example, she bitterly attacks
the Pakistan support of the Hill
tribe's invasion of Kashmir, where
a Moslem majority does exist. At
the same time she blithely white
washes the Indian government's sup
port of the Communist-inspired re
volt in Hyderabad, which led to the
government's invasion of that pri
vate principality.
But it is not on Miss White's
quixotic approach to the Indian so
cial problems that the value of the
book depends. It is, rather, her cov
erage of the political schisms, al
liances. etc., which both preceded
and followed the final split between
the All-India Congress and the
Moslem League. She has also in
cluded many astute character analy
ses of contemporary leaders. The
