### WALLY WHITE 
Grey concrete and thin steel rods
northwest of the Chemistry Build
in;* mark the site of the new Or
ganic Chemistry Building. Now in
the foundation stage, the $185,000
: structure is scheduled to be com
pleted Aug. 25,.
It will be a low, flat-roofed, one
; story building. In streamlined con

struction and extensive use of glas
it will resemble the nearby Micro
wave Laboratory.
The building will be used main!
for research. Its 12.000 square lie
of floor space will include eigh
four-man research labs, four room
to serve as offices and private labo
ratories. a large "first-year" lab. ant
various storerooms.
Heat will be supplied by water
filled pipes under the floor. Accord
ing to Eldridge T. Spencer, Univer
sity director of planning, this "ra
diant heating' is cheaper to oper
ate an J is much cleaner than othc
types. The air in a chemistry labo
ratory, he explained, should not b<
stirred up, as steam or gas heatim
would do. The same system is usee
in the Microwave Laboratory.
Most of the lighting will be fluo
rescent. The building will be con
nected with the University bell sys
tem and fire alarm system.
It is being erected by the E. S
McKittrick Co., Inc.
