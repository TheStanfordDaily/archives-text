# Black Feet Track Hoover Libe Walls
## 
### 
Four large black-paper footprints
were found fastened 50 to 75 feet
up on the north side of Hoover
Tower yesterday morning.
A few strands of manila were
found on the railing of the four
teenth floor deck, indicating that
the unknown culprit had been low
ered from there.
No one has ascertained how en
trance to the library was gained nor
how all the neeessaiy equipment
was brought in. Two of the prints
blew from the building, but the re
maining two had to be removed by
hooks lowered from above at con
siderable risk to Corporation Yard
employees.
The incident was the latest of
several pranks perpetrated in the
building. Mrs. Inez Richardson, ex
ecutive assistant and research asso
ciate of the library, stated that she
considered the event a matter de
manding student attention if Hoo
ver Tower is not to be a perennial
target for dangerous and defacing
pranks.
