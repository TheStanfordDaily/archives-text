# Gypsy Camp Dance

### 
Three hundred golden earrings
will he handed to couples as they
stroll into the firelit Theta Chi
Gypsy Camp tomorrow night.
"Petur" Henderson, leader of the
camp, explained that, once equipped
as gypsies, damsels and their swar
thy companions are free to wander
through the dimly lit camp, seek out
Madame Zukar, fortune teller,
lounge in the campfire's glow, and
hark to the strains of a strolling
violinist.
Inside, he said. Bob Miller and
his Mad Magyars will play dance
music. On the root, couples may
twirl to recorded gypsy melodies.
Each hour, he explained, a wagon
will leave the camp and steal into
the night, carrying the more ad
venturous to the Lake Lagunita re
gion.
