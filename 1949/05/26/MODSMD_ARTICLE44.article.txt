# Arce Hurls Fielders to 7 to 3 Diamond Win Over Pitchers
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Captain Bill Arce notched his first
collegiate win against no losses as
he pitched the infielders and out
fielders to a 7 to 3 win over the
pitchers and catchers yesterday be
fore a large crowd at Stanford's
Sunken Diamond.
Arce gave up only six hits and
allowed two runs in the six innings
that he worked.
The fielders opened the scoring in
the first frame. Bob Larson singled
and was thrown out at the plate as
he tried to score on John Schaefer's i
double. Schaefer went to third on
the play.
Winterhalter scored Schaefer by j
laying a perfect bunt clown the ;
ihird-ba.se line and beating it out '
for an infield single.

The fielders picked up two more
runs in the second on a double by
Bud Klein, a single by John Clay
pool, and a long single up against
the left centerfield bank by Dave
Melton.
Frank MacGraw came in from
right field to relieve Castagnoli with
one down. Mac's first pitch was a
blooper ball that Bud Klein went
after and popped up to third base
man Frank Laßrum. Tuffanelli tried
to take second after the catch, but
was thrown out for the battery
men's only double play of the tilt.
The battery men broke into the
scoring column in the fourth inning
when Ed Shive drove Bill Herron
home by blasting a single between
shortstop and second base.
The sixth inning produced two
more runs for the fielders when
MacGraw ran into a streak of wild
ness and walked four batters after
two were out. Arce aided his own
cause by driving in one of the runs
with a base knock into left field.
Chuck Cole went in to relieve
Arce in the seventh frame, and the
opposition greeted him with some
unexpected strategy. Lead-off man
Dave Stott struck out, but catcher
Tuffanelli dropped the third strike
and chased Stott all the way to third
base. At this point the batterymen
decided to run the bases backward.
However, their strategy backfired
when Jim Claypool popped up to
Co'e on an attempted sacrifice bunt
and Stott was doubled off third.
In addition to running the bases
in reverse, the batterymen had sev
eral other maneuvers o'evised to
confuse the opposition. In the fifth
inning catcher Bushong greeted the
batters with a loaded water pistol.
In the seventh inning a fourth man
showed up in the outfield, but all
this was to no avail as the damage
had already been done.

Captain Bill Arce notched his first
collegiate win against no losses as
he pitched the infielders and out
fielders to a 7 to 3 win over the
pitchers and catchers yesterday be
fore a large crowd at Stanford's
Sunken Diamond.
Arce gave up only six hits and
allowed two runs in the six innings
that he worked.
The fielders opened the scoring in
the first frame. Bob Larson singled
and was thrown out at the plate as
he tried to score on John Schaefer's i
double. Schaefer went to third on
the play.
Winterhalter scored Schaefer by j
laying a perfect bunt clown the ;
ihird-ba.se line and beating it out '
for an infield single.

The fielders picked up two more
runs in the second on a double by
Bud Klein, a single by John Clay
pool, and a long single up against
the left centerfield bank by Dave
Melton.
Frank MacGraw came in from
right field to relieve Castagnoli with
one down. Mac's first pitch was a
blooper ball that Bud Klein went
after and popped up to third base
man Frank Laßrum. Tuffanelli tried
to take second after the catch, but
was thrown out for the battery
men's only double play of the tilt.
The battery men broke into the
scoring column in the fourth inning
when Ed Shive drove Bill Herron
home by blasting a single between
shortstop and second base.
The sixth inning produced two
more runs for the fielders when
MacGraw ran into a streak of wild
ness and walked four batters after
two were out. Arce aided his own
cause by driving in one of the runs
with a base knock into left field.
Chuck Cole went in to relieve
Arce in the seventh frame, and the
opposition greeted him with some
unexpected strategy. Lead-off man
Dave Stott struck out, but catcher
Tuffanelli dropped the third strike
and chased Stott all the way to third
base. At this point the batterymen
decided to run the bases backward.
However, their strategy backfired
when Jim Claypool popped up to
Co'e on an attempted sacrifice bunt
and Stott was doubled off third.
In addition to running the bases
in reverse, the batterymen had sev
eral other maneuvers o'evised to
confuse the opposition. In the fifth
inning catcher Bushong greeted the
batters with a loaded water pistol.
In the seventh inning a fourth man
showed up in the outfield, but all
this was to no avail as the damage
had already been done.
