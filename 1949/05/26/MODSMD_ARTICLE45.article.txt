## PCC MEET Indians Lost Closie in '40 
### 
Nineteen hundred forty-nine isn't
the only year that the Stanford
tracksters have lost a meet to the
USC Trojans by a single race or
a single point.
Ine Indian cinder team of 1940
seemed to have its first Pacific Coast
Conference meet victory since 1927
in the bap, when all of a sudden
USC popped up with a makeshift
mile rel-y team which grabbed
fourth place and the PCC meet vic
tory by two slim points.
It is truly an amazing story. Dean
Cromwell, the Southern California
coach in 1940. called the Trojan
mile-relay team "the most tired
put motley collection of misfit mile
relay runners that I have ever as
sembled in a big meet."
Troy Needed Point
Troy went into the final event,
which was the relay, five points
ahead of Stanford. The Indian team
in that year were cinch winners in
the relay, having already set a new
world's record early in the 1940 sea
son. and to win the meet USC had
to finish at least fifth in the event,
the scoring being on a 5-4-3-2-1
basis.
USC. because of limited entries,
had only entered one quarter-miler
in the meet, gambling on winning
the championship before the mile
relay came around. But the Trojans
had to scrape up some four men for
the winning point.
The only four Troy athletes avail
able were Louis Zamperini, miler;
Art Laret, low hurdler; Art Read
ing. half-miler; and Howard Upton,
quarter-miler. This makeshift team
had to beat either Montana or
Washington, both of whom had run
a good 3:17.3 in the regular sea
son, because the Stanford, Califor
nia, and UCLA teams were much
too fast.
Miler Hits 51 Quarter
Zamperini, although forced to a
4:11.5 mile by Paul Moore of Stan
lord that same day, responded with
a 51-second quarter in the first lap.
but trailed the pack at the end of
his 440. Laret also hit a 51-second
lap, but Troy was 20 yards behind
everyone half - way through the
race.
Reading, the Trojan third man,
closed the gap to only 8 yards be
hind the last man with a 48-second

lap, by far his greatest effort, and
the stage was set for the upset.
Upton, the only quarter-rtiiler of
the makeshift group, poured it on
in the stretch to beat both Montana
and Washington, and USC won the
PCC meet again. Stanford won the
mile relay in 3:14 Hat. but it was to
no avail. Will the Trojans repeat
again in Seattle this Saturday?
