## On The Bench 
### 
Last week, like every week, many tilings were said by "important"
personages, and their remarks wound up in print, just as they always
do. Today I would like to make a comment on two of last week's quotes
that were certainly not earth-shaking, but were at least interesting.
Down in the low-rent district of L.A., Jess Hill, mentor of the mighty
Trojans, had his say about shot-putters. "Bayless has beaten Chandler of
Stanford once and he will do it again and again. Bayless is on the way
up and Chandler is—well, Bayless will continue to beat him."
While a rebuttal is not in order, I felt that one from the right sources
would be interesting. So 1 asked Stanford's handsome coach, Jack Weicr
shuuscr, what he thought. Jack was short, blunt, and emphatic:
"You can quote me as saying," he said, "that Bill Bayless will never
ever beat either Chandler or Davis again. And you might add that un
der the coaching <>l Jess Hill. Bayless has managed to come within six
inches of his best mark last year."
Bayless' best putt this season Is 53 feet 2 inches; last year under Crom
well he heaved 53 feet 8 inches.
Incidentally, this stuff about Chandler being in a slump is a lot of stuff.
The broad-shouldered ace is suffering from a sore wrist, and if you don't
think that hurts your shot-putting, guess again. Just how soon the Oatt
wrist will be back in shape is a big question mark. We hope that by
next Saturday (the PCC) it will be well enough to allow Chandler to
throw a winning 53-something; if not, it certainly will be "right" for the
June IHth NCAA in Los Angeles.
Which v brings us to the second saying of the week. Last Friday Sports
Editor Jawn Hall had a comment on my May 19 column, in which I happily
wrote that Stanford would win the NCAA meet and pile up possibly 60
points in doing so. To this Editor Hall quipped that I "had fallen into a
schzophrenic state with delusions of grandeur." Editor Hall since then
has gone so far as to offer to give me a "case of Millers" if the Stanford
fellas should win the NCAA.
This column, today, will not discuss the sad plight of Editor Hall, other
than to say that it is my well-founded opinion that he is suffering from
a manic-depressive condition resulting from Stanford's past consistent
losses to the University of Southern California, further complicated by
being a rabid basketball fan. Rather than take the risk of shocking my
editor into violence, 1 will merely say that I still think the Cards wiil
win the NCAA. And when they do, if there are any track men who—
when they are in an "off-training" month of the year—would like to
share Johns case ot Miller's with me, they are certainly welcome to do so.
The outlook for this Saturday's PCC meet in Seattle is, however, con
siderably less optimistic than it appeared last week. Stanford will face
the deep, loaded Trojans with an injury list that is nothing short of stag
gering. Cay Bryan has an injured leg (not critical); Chandler's wrist;
half miler Drew Terramorse is in the hospital with a strep throat; Pitch
Johnson is in the rest home with stomach trouble; Downing MrKec is
still bothered by a knee injury; Skip Russell has a twisted ankle; Al
Lyons has a pair of sore knees: and Boh Bryan has not yet fully recovered
from his recent appendix operation. Outside of this, the Indians are in
top shape.
To make things really nice, the scoring system used at the PCC will
woijs in favor of Troy, not Stanford. All events —including the mile relay—
are scored 5-4-3-2-1, which gives the deeper team the decided advantage.
If we should beat SC in the relay, we will gain only one point on them,
5 and 4.
(laylord Bryan will probably not run in the relay just because of this.
The older Bryan will, I think, compete in the 100, 220. high jump, and
broad jump, but may alternate the 220 low hurdles for one of these
four events.
Looking at it analytically, the PCC situation looks grim for the home
team and gay (not Gaylord) for the trolley-trackers. HOWEVER, being
a die-hard, I think that in spite of all, the Card trackers can win that
meet. I have a hunch that the northern schools might be able to tip
the scales against the Trojans by coming through in such events as the
pole vault and the 880. I have a hunch that the scoring system might
not work all to Stanford's disfavor. I alteo have a hunch tiiat lightning
will strike Mel Patton down at the 50-yard mark. And I have a hunch
that Stanford's cripples will pull a comethrough like nothing seen yet
this year.
And if I'm wrong, I'll apologize.
