# Card Cagers to Do Battle In Intrasquad Tilt Today
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Farm basketball fans will get a crystal-ball squint at what next
year has to offer this afternoon when Bobby Burnett's spring
cagers will make with the civil war at 4 in the Pavilion.
Climaxing the spring drills, this full-length inter-squad tilt
should produce answer to most of the new pending basketball

questions.
Such as, how will the new machine
look minus the services of Dave
Davidson, Bill Stephenson, Bob
Lewis, Bill Rose, and Milt Iverson?
How well will Ralph Carver and
Jim Ramstead take care of the all
important pivot spot?
Cnn big George Yardley get down
floor fast enough to offer a helping
hand in the fast break?
Is Jack O'Sullivan the man to fill
the vacancy at the forward spot left
open by the departure of Milt Iver
son and Bill Rose?
How smoothly will freshmen Ron
nie Garver, Jim Walsh, Gary An
drews, Bruce Iverson, and Karl
Davis fit into the varsity swing of
things?
And most important, do the Stan
fords have a basketball team in the
making? t
Besides getting the inside track to
the answers of these questions. Pa
vilion Peggy will also see a new sys
tem of foul-calling go into its ex
perimental stage.
The new idea in fouls was orig
inated by Coach Burnett himself,
and works something like this:
Each squad will carry on as
usual until it has committed 15
personals. After that, the other
team will get to take the ball out
of bounds as well as try its free
shot. No man will be fouled out
of the game.
The idea of the revolutionary sys
tem is to penalize the team instead
of the individual and to eliminate
the mad scramble which has been
taking place during the last few
minutes of the ballgames.
This new plan, although still in the
incubator stage and needing a little
pressing, stacks up like a good thing,
and if it tests well this afternoon, it
might go a long way.
Anyway, it'll all be going on at the
Pavilion, this afternoon. Admission
is free, spring basketball is the bill
of-fare, and the public is invited.
