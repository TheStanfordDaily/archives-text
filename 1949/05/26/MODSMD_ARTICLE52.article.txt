# DUs Nip Deke Swimmers
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Highlighted by Don Patch's three
| lirst places, the DU's nipped the
Dekes yesterday at the Encina pool ;
i ior the mural swim crown. Final I
; score gave the winners 18 points, the
Dekes 17, and the ATO's in third
spot with 14.
The outstanding star was, by far- i
and-away, freestyler Patch. Open
, ing the all-campus meet with rec
ord - tying time in the 50 - yard
i sprint, Don proceeded to break the
old marks in the 150 and century
I events. His times were :25.2 for
; ihe sprint, 1:35.G in the distance,
and :58.G in the hundred.
Added to Patch's 15-point effort
was a third place by Lee Morrison
in the 150 to give the DU's the win
i ning margin.
Versatile Ed Wilson paced the
Deke swim crew. A blue ribbon in
•he backstroke, which was the re
maining record performance of the
day, and a close second in the
breaststroke were Ed's doings. Strok
ing the 75 yards on his back in 47.5
seconds, Wilson broke the old
; standard set by Hall last year by
more than two seconds.
Other blue ribbons were awarded
to Villager Bob Buoxon in the
| breaststroke and Byron Geuy of the
| AKL house in diving.
The big show was ended by a
close finish in the relay. The Phi 1
j Delts barely tapped out the ATO's, j
i after mastering the 200 yards in j
; die fair time of 1:47 Hat. Both four- I
| somes had a qualifying time of j
I 1:46.G.
Winston Mumby, who ran the ,

two-day show, deserves a big hand
for his smooth handling. The goad
times, and close races indicate the
success of the meet.
