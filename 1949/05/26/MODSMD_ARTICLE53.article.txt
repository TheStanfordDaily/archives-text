# Intramural Track Records May Fall
## 
### 
More than 100 mural tracksters, ,
the cream of the crop picked from
last Friday's qualifying heats, will
battle it out in tomorrow afternoon's !
! mural track finals.
Some of the best times and dis
tances recorded in recent mural his- I
i tory were tallied by the qualifiers '
last week, and tourney officials are
expecting extra-close competition in
nearly every event.
Delta Chi, the mural giants from
upper Row, will lead the galloping
herd of cindermen in tomorrow's
finals with a total of 10 entries scat
tered throughout the 14 events on
| the program. Long John Boreta of
! the Delta Chi's turned in the out
! standing performance of last week's j
j competition by tossing the discus
130 feet 4 inchesâ€”nearly six feet
better than the old mural record.
That toss of Kistler's, incidentally,
bettered Emery Mitchell's record j
toss of 184 feet 8 inches tallied last
year, and dropped the big M to third
place in the event last week.
