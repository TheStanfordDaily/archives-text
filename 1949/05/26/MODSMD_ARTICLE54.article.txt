A "Delegate's Bar" was held yesterday afternoon at the lIR Shack, so
that delegations might receive final instructions for the General Model
Assembly, which will be held at Frost Amphitheater tomorrow afternoon.

Occasionally there was difficulty
in forming blocs, because of the
differences in countries' aims. For
instance, Pakistan was bound to
England for economic reasons, but

North Atlantic Pact.
Amendments to the main resolu

Assembly along with the x'esolu

A question that is bound to arise
at the Assembly, and most probably
from the mouth of the Russian del

Pact isn't hurting the UN since it
is outside of its jurisdiction."
A banquet will be held following
the Assembly, to which all dele
gation members, foreign consuls,
and Dr. Malik, the featured speak
er, have been invited. The banquet
will take place in the Garden Wing
of the Stanford Union at 6:15 p.m.
