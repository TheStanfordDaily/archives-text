# Crew Request Defeated, 8 to 5
## 
### 
A proposal that crew be given major sport status at Stanford
: was defeated by Excom last night.
The vote on the measure was 8 for and 5 against—a three
i fourths majority being necessary for adoption of the by-law.
It was agreed, however, that there is need for more definite

► criteria to help Exeom distinguish
between major and minor sports in
the future.
The principal objection raised to
giving b'ock letters to members ot
the varsity shell was that crew at
j Stanford is not yet sufficiently de
veloped to warrant major sport sta
! tus.
Mickey Titus, speaking for the
Block "S" Society, said that Excom
( had adopted a three-point criterion
' for a major sport in 1947 when it
| gave recognition to swimming ano
i golf, and that the Stanford crev
I today falls short on two of the thret
i requirements.
Titus admitted that there is suf
ficient campus interest in the sport
j but said that it lacks an adequate
j schedule and that the past achieve
ments of the sport at Stanford are
less than those of swimming and
golf at the time they were given
1 Block "S" status.

Excom member Mark Hatfield
reasoned that crew should be
awarded block letters on the basis
that additional expense to the ath
letic department would be negli
gible, and that they have proven
themselves by gaining recognition
from the Eastern Rowing Associa
tion and the Poughkeepsie Board of
Stewards.
Ted Norton, commenting on the
ASSU By-Laws, said that Block "S"
letters can still be earned by crew
members regardless of how Excom
acts. Like all minor sport athletes,
crewmen receive a block letter in
lieu of their third Circle '"S." Mem
bers of the varsity shell can also
earn blocks by winning the na
tional championship at Poughkeep
sie. he said.
