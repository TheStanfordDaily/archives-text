# Stanford Plans 50-Years Ahead
## Master Plan In Making 
### AL McCOMBS Feature Editor, The Daily 
Stanford has big things in
mind. Looking 50 years ahead
into the future, the University
is mapping out an extensive
planning program which will
lead to the development of a
broader curriculum and greater
working facilities for the stu
dents.
The task facing the administration
anil the Board of Trustees is im
mense, but University officials have

their sleeves rolled up and are all
set to expand. Dr. Wallace Ster
ling's arrival in the President's
chair means an early clear-cut pic
ture of University policy.
One phase of the planning is fu
ture building. Although not the
most important, it is the most tangi
ble, particularly to the students'
point of view. For this reason, The
Daily has devoted a section today
to the foreseeable construction pro
posed for the University.
The most important phase of plan
ning is development of curricular
activities. This development will
govern the size of the University
and future physical expansion.
The deans and department heads
of the graduate and undergrad\iate
schools are now surveying the future
needs of their respective depart
ments. Their reports will be sub
mitted to the President's Office,

and used for policy formation.
One important factor affecting
policy is enrollment. In 1946, for
mer Dean of Students John M. Stal
i naker predicted that Stanford would
have an enrollment of at least 5,000
for the next five years. Even then,
i he said he could not make an ac
j curate guesss. A year and three
months later, in the fall of 1947, en
j rollment climbed past 8,000. where
| it has remained for two years.
What is a desirable enrollment?
I Even the University can only guess
within a thousand. Opinions of ad
j ministration officials range between
j 6,000 and 7,000. The students,
polled in 1946, preferred under 4.000
â€¢ by an 85 per cent majority. That
I figure is now considered a mark for
j the history books.
Next December a committee will
! meet to set an approximate figure,

| and from there on the University
will scale down admissions. Al
ready the graduate schools are be
ginning to cut down, but a s'ight
increase is seen in the undergradu
ate division which will bring en
rollment close to last year's 8,317
in the fall.
j The Stanford rough who is inter
; ested in the ratio can be assured
; that the University is not setting a
' deiinite limit to the number of wom
en admitted, like the old "Stanford
500." The enrollment of women is
governed by the housing space
available, since it is a policy for all
coeds to live on campus.
According to the present views of
the administration and Trustees, the
ratio of graduate students to under
| graduates will be approximately one
to two. No matter what the exact
I ratio, however, Dr. Sterling assures

students that there will be no
heavier emphasis on one school or
the other. An attempt will be made
to develop both according to the
highest educational standards.
Like all private universities,
Stantord is faced with the prospect
of raising money to finance devel
opment. So far endowment has
lagged, but an active program is
being planned to get the financial
ball rolling.
Louis B. Lundborg, vice-president
for University development, empha
sizes that all the planning in the
world does no good unless the UivU
versity can secure gifts and dona
tions to finance the projects. Money
has become the number one con
cern of Stanford.
