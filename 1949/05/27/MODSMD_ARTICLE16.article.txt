# Bang, Bang; SAE Pledges Turn Into Soldier Boys
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
'"Don't shoot till you see the
whites of their eyes. We'll teach
you how to be soldiers."
A man walked across the street
l'rom the Post Office yesterday.
Quickly the SAE pledge leveled
his broom and snarled, '"Halt! Who
goes there? Friend or foe? .
Pshow, pshow; you die."
"It's been going on ever since I
woke up this morning," sighed a
tiny white-haired lady. I'm stay
ing at Union, you see. I know it's
not the same person because of his
legs; sometimes they're fat and
sometimes they're thin."
Suddenly the sentinel thrust a
megaphone to his lips and bellowed,
"One o'clock and all's well." Stu
dents shuffling along to their af
ternoon classes smiled as they
passed the house.
No wonder. Tucked in his belt
was a plunger for a bayonet, and
on his hip clattered a kettle for a
canteen against a catcher's mask.
A light bulb dangled from the
broom and a dishpan sparkled on
his head. He was stuffed in a dark
blue coat-jacket with levis sticking
out beneath.
"One o'clock and all's well," he
boomed again.
The little lady laughed and said,
"This morning one boy called 'Ten
o'clock and there's a hole in the
ground. He got called down for it,
though. They didn't like his calling
a well a hole."
