# Tracksters Seek Revenge On Troy In Seattle PCC
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
The Pacific Coast's two top cinder teams, Stanford and USC, '
will again clash tomorrow, this time at the University of Wash
ington Stadium in Seattle with the PCC track crown at stake.
Under the direction of Card Coach Jack Weiershauser, Stan- '
ford's 18-man.squad will leave the San Francisco Airport at 1 p.m.

this afternoon, and will fly straight
to Seattle except for a short stop at
the Oakland Airport to pick up the
Cal track team.
The outcome of the meet at
Seattle will depend largely on how
many points Washington State Col
lege, winners of the Northern Di
vision meet last week, can take

away from the ever-powerful Tro- >
jans.
WSC Threats in BSa
\ The WSC Cougars, who scored
twice as many points as second
| place Oregon last week, have defi
nite threats in the half mile and i
the hurdles which could grab badly- ;
needed points from the hands of j
I the Trojans.
Cougars Bill Parneil and Jack j
Hensey have times under 1:55 this
year in the half mile, and could both
beat Wally Wilson and Stan Mattoon, |
Troy 880 aces. However, USC's Bob
Chambers will be favored to win j
the race.
Fran Polsfoot, WSC hurdling sen- I
sation, tied a 19-year-old Northern
Division record in the high hurdles j
! when he won the race in :14.4 last !
; week. Although UCLA's Craig
' Dixon will probably win the race i
tomorrow, both USC's Dick At- I
j tlesey and Stanford's Downing Mc- J
i Kee will have to ramble to beat the j
fleet Polsfoot. The Cougar star also
won the Northern Division low hur
, dies in :23.8.
Oregon Ace Clears 14 ft. 6 in.
Oregon's George Rasmussen is
figured to cut in Troy's pole vault
points if he can equal his year's i
best vault of 11 feet 6 inches. Stan
ford's Don Campbell might possi
bly get a fourth of fifth in this event.
The mile race is another big
question. Kaare Vefling, California's '
; veteran distance man, has the best j
j time « n the Coast so far this year, j
I an t be favored to capture his !


STANFORD'S QUAD and Hoover Tower have become a trademark of
the University. Around these familiar buildings, Stanford will expand
to provide greater working resources for students and graduates. This
program is outlined in a 50-year master plan, drawn up by University
Planner Eldridge T. Spenser. This expansion will include renovation of
the Quad to provide more floor space. However, the Quad will be pre
served in its present form and will continue to be the center of University
activity.
event.
The rest of the places are wholly
in doubt with USC's Bob Pruitt,
Stanford's A 1 Lyons, Idaho's War
ren Johanson. and WSC's Dick Paeth
battling it out.
Mel Patton, Trojan flash, as usual
is expected to capture both sprints.
It will be a fight for the places in
the 100 between Stanford's Gay
Bryan, UCLA's Bob Work, and Cal's
Donnie Anderson, last year's cen
utry winner.
Bryan Entered In Six
Versatile Gay Bryan of Stanford
is entered in six events, which in
cludes the relay, but it is doubtful
whether he will compete in all of
them. He is favored to repeat last
year's victory in the broad jump,
and there's no telling how many
points the Card captain could grab
for the Indians during the afternoon.
Stanford's one-two shot put
punch Otis Chandler and Lew Davis,
may repeat in the meet tomorrow,
while Cards' Bud Held is figured
to win the javelin.
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson may
pick up some badly needed points
in the quarter, but will have to go
some to best WSC's Joe Nebolon,
who has ben credited with a tre
mendous :47.9 already this season.
Stanford's 18-man traveling squad
includes Ui'.pe Andrews, Cass Bly,
Otis Chandler, Lew Davis, Gay
Bryan, Bob Bryan, Larry Huff, Pitch
Johnson, Bud Held, Downing Mc-
Kee, Steve McKec, Drew Terra
morse, Skip Kent, A 1 Lyons, Don
Campbell. Merritt Van Sant, Norm
Nourse. and Dell Russell.

STANFORD'S QUAD and Hoover Tower have become a trademark of

to provide greater working resources for students and graduates. This
program is outlined in a 50-year master plan, drawn up by University

The rest of the places are wholly
in doubt with USC's Bob Pruitt,
Stanford's A 1 Lyons, Idaho's War

battling it out.
Mel Patton, Trojan flash, as usual
is expected to capture both sprints.
It will be a fight for the places in
the 100 between Stanford's Gay
Bryan, UCLA's Bob Work, and Cal's
Donnie Anderson, last year's cen
utry winner.
Bryan Entered In Six
Versatile Gay Bryan of Stanford
is entered in six events, which in
cludes the relay, but it is doubtful
whether he will compete in all of
them. He is favored to repeat last
year's victory in the broad jump,
and there's no telling how many
points the Card captain could grab
for the Indians during the afternoon.
Stanford's one-two shot put
punch Otis Chandler and Lew Davis,
may repeat in the meet tomorrow,
while Cards' Bud Held is figured
to win the javelin.
Larry Hoff and Pitch Johnson may
pick up some badly needed points
in the quarter, but will have to go
some to best WSC's Joe Nebolon,
who has ben credited with a tre
mendous :47.9 already this season.
Stanford's 18-man traveling squad
includes Ui'.pe Andrews, Cass Bly,
Otis Chandler, Lew Davis, Gay
Bryan, Bob Bryan, Larry Huff, Pitch
Johnson, Bud Held, Downing Mc-
Kee, Steve McKec, Drew Terra
morse, Skip Kent, A 1 Lyons, Don
Campbell. Merritt Van Sant, Norm
Nourse. and Dell Russell.
The Pacific Coast's two top cinder teams, Stanford and USC, '
will again clash tomorrow, this time at the University of Wash
ington Stadium in Seattle with the PCC track crown at stake.
Under the direction of Card Coach Jack Weiershauser, Stan- '
ford's 18-man.squad will leave the San Francisco Airport at 1 p.m.

this afternoon, and will fly straight
to Seattle except for a short stop at
the Oakland Airport to pick up the

The outcome of the meet at
