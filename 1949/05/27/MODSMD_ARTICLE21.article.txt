## Security for Students 
### 
The Stanford Health Service is planning a new health center
which will include an infirmary, office space, waiting rooms,
and a guidance center.
Not only is the present doctor-nurse space taxed to capacity,
but the rest homes, and isolation hospital are not adequate to
handle the high Farm enrollment.
These crowded facilities indicate that the Health Service has
reached the peak of its present development. Starting as an
outgrov/th of the Palo Alto Clinic, the service has built itself
into a student health center which is constantly being used as
a model by other universities.
Generally, the Health Service provides protection and se
curity for the students. Even if a student never takes advantage
ofs its services, the knowledge that it is available is comforting
and morally reassuring.
Specifically, the health service provides five general serv
ices:
1. Complete physical examination for all entering students.
2. All medical and surgical care and treatment.
3. One hundred days' hospitalization in hospital ward or Rest
Home for any one injury or illness.
4. Laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, dressings, splints, and
professional consultations.
5. Necessary house calls within 10 miles of the Adminis
tration Building at any time.
1 urthermore, the student is not limited to the doctors on duty
at the Health Service. It is possible for a student to select any
physician who is a licensed doctor living within 10 miles of the
Administration Building and who is acceptable to the University.
Thus, with no obligation to the student, the Health Service
stands ready to provide complete and, in cases of emergency,
speody medical care on a 24-hour basis.
