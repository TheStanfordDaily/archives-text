## Answer on Statement 
### 
To the Editor:
This is in answer to Mr. Allen's three questions concerning the state
ment on the trial of the Communists which was sent to members of the
Stanford faculty.
1. I was one of the students who "started it" (to quote Mr. Allen), be
cau e I feel that putting men on trial for political beliefs is completely
t on.ury to toe American conception of democracy, and cannot be justi
fied on any grounds.
-• The statement was sent to the faculty as a whole with a request
that it be signed.
Ihe cost of postage was paid by the students who drew up the
statement and circulated it.
I hope that all members of the faculty, including Mr. Allen, will sign
this statement, not for the purpose of defending the 12 Communists who
are on trial, but in order to protect the right of all cilizcns to hold views
contrary to those of the majority.
