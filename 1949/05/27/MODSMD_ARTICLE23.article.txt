# Comment on Protest Petition

### 
To the Editor:
May I comment on issues raised by a letter in last Monday's Daily
relative to a petition, of which I was one of the sponsors, protesting the
political trial of the Communist leaders.
That a man forfeits civil right by membership in any party is a dan
porous principle. That civil rights cannot be denied to any group without
endangering those of all other citizens is abundantly illustrated in history,
nowhere more vividly than by the Nazis, who proscribed all political
groups within six months after outlawing the Communist Party.
Abolitionists before the Civil War were persecuted with more violence
that! the "reds" are at the present, but luckily their party was not out
lawed. Fortunately the courts place a high value on civil rights. In 1942
the Supreme Court reversed the revocation by a California court of the
citizenship of William Schneidcrmann, a Communist, 12 years after his
naturalization.
"Nothing in the record," said Justice Murphy, indicates "that he was
trVei connected with any overt illegal or violent action. The burden rests
'pon the Government to prove lack of attachment to the Constitution by
'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' evidence. That burden has not been
carried. The Government has not proved that petitioner's beliefs on the
. Ã¼bj 'ct of force and violence were such that he was not attached to the
1 'onstitution .... far-reaching changes made in the Constitution since
1787 refute the idea that attachment to any particular provision or pro
visions is essential, or that one who advocates radical changes is neces
sarily not attached to the Constitution .... The constitutional fathers,
Iresli from a revolution, did not forge a political straitjacket for the gen
erations to come."
On the Monday on which the letter appeared, the Supeme Court reversed
the conviction of a Catholic priest named Terminiello by a Chicago court
for making an inflammatory speech leading to a riot. The conviction
rested upon an ordinance construed as prohibiting any speech "which stirs
the public to anger, invites disputes, brings about unrest, or creates a dis
turbance."
"A conviction resting on any of those grounds may not stand," Justice
Douglas declared. ' A function of free speech under our system of gov
ernment is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose
when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with condi
ions as they are or even stirs people to anger There is no room
under our constitution for a more restrictive view.
In view of these two recent decisions of the highest court in our land,
it would seem that putting men on trial for their political views is a clear
invasion of their constitutional right of free speech. The dismissal of
nary federal workers for opinions not even mentioned in the hearing,
- nd the firing of least 11 college professors for supporting Wallace in the
recent presidential campaign, prove that freedom of speech is not a remote
or purely "academic" matter.
