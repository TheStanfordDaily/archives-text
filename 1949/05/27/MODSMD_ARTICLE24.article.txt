# Chaplain's Chat
## 
### PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
Preparations go on apace for the
days ahead. A long look down the
road to be traveled is constantly
taken in the Chaplain's offices. It*
the right speakers for the church
services are to be chosen and their
assent secured, they must be dated
far ahead. I am glad to report
that at least three such men have
been scheduled for the next school
year.
Dr. Henry Pitt VanDusen, Presi
| dent of the Union Theological Sem
; inary in New York City, is one of
; them. He will come to us Nov. 13.
Dr. Charles W. Gilkey, who for a
; quarter of a century was the Dean
ol the Chapel in the University of
Chicago, and whose base of opera
tions is now in New England, will
lead our Religious Emphasis Week
the last of February, 1950.
Dr. Gilkey's time is very full,
since he is on call all over the
country lor college preaching and
seminars.
Next April 23 we will have the
pleasure of a visit from Dr. Albert
Cutler, Yale Divinity School, New-
Haven, Conn.
The above is hut ? taste of good
fare being readied. Meantime, the
Church and Interfaith Committees
are editing new material for the
1949-50 Students' Handbook, the
annual freshman pamphlet on Re
ligious Fellowship, and other publi
cations.
This year's "Quad" will contain
fresh writings on the church and its
work. Ted Off has been taking some
new and most attractive pictures of
both the interior and exterior of the
church, and some of these will be
in the literature.
A summer Church Committee has
been appointed, to carry on through
summer quarter and span the time
until the autumn return of the stu
dents. We are sharing in the plans
for freshman registration and orien
tation in the fall. Outdoor summer
services held in Frost Amphitheater
upon occasion are being studied.
It will be welcome news to many
that we expect to have more teach
ing of religion in the regular cur
riculum by the time the time
schedule for the fall quarter is is
sued. In addition the Chaplains and
other faculty members will offer
voluntary courses of study, without
credit. A wide-ranging program of
discussion groups is likewise on the.
agenda.
Mr. Minto and I would enjoy hav
ing many of you who read this col
umn drop into the Vestry and see
the new offices which are now com
plete. The arrangement is very
satisfactory and will be a most use
ful addition to our working equip
ment.
Thanks are due the Administra
tion and the Business Office, the
University Architect, and others,
for seeing that this improvement
took place. We are also working on
the possibility of installing a Public
Address System in Memorial
Church.
Finally, in this list of items we
want to share with the student body
—though the list is not at all ex
haustive—let me say that we are
seeking ways and means to establish
Chaplaincy service for Stanford
Village, beginning with the fall
period.
