# Long-Range Housing Program Will Ease Crowded Conditions
## 
### 
Stanford was built as a residence
campus, and the University author
ities have every intention to return
it to this status. When the final
housing plans are carried out, every
undergraduate may live on the
campus during his entire four-year
stay, and many graduates will be
housed as well.
With the end of World War 11.
Stanford found itself faced with a
critical housing shortage. By jug
gling existing dorm space and leas
j ing the Village from the govern
ment, the University managed to
fulfill the minimum housing needs
Today, 500 Encina freshmen, 84
per cent of the first-year men, .share
the hall with the University finan
cial offices. The rest of the frosh
live at the Village.
37 Per Cent on Campus
Encina was built to house 300.
Branner, once quarters for 130 men,
now houses 164 women. In Roble.
three women are crowded into suites
for two. Gti top of it all, onl,y 37
per cent of the student body livei
on campus.
Ultimately, the University may
have to house 6,000 before it can
again claim the distinction of being
a full-fledged residence university.
For this purpose, a $16,000,000 hous
ing plan has been designed. All the
University needs now to start actual
construction is donors.
The Lagunita Court plan has been
used as a model for most future
undergraduate residences. This plan
stresses separated living groups and
a central dining unit. Such a plan
is considered highly practical from
a standpoint of living as a social
group on one hand and economy on
the other, and has the approval of
students and educators alike.
Economy Plus Good Living
There are two reasons for this
compromise between existing resi
dences like Branner and Roble and
those on the Row. From a stand
point of economy, Roble, Branner,
and Union are cheaper to operate
because they house large numbers.
But this type of hotel-like living
lacks the social benefit provided by
the Union Units and the Row houses.
On the other hand, small houses
like those of the units and the Row
are faced with an operational cost
that is out of proportion to that of
other University residences, espe
cially in houses such as Elm Cot
tage, with a capacity of 12 women.
Small dining facilities in the Row
houses are costly, central dining on
the Row is unfeasible, and outside
dining like that of Union Unit is
considered impractical. The solution j

is a dining hall incorporated with
the living units.
Branner's Fate
At least three phases of resident
construction are planned for men
and one for women. Although no
definite date has been set, the Uni
versity is seriously thinking of giv
ing Branner back to the men. How
ever, this will occur only when an
other hall is completed for women.
Meanwhile, a second four-unit
group will be added to Stern as
soon as funds are available. A sec
ond dormitory like it may be con
structed across Escondido from
Branner.
A third dormitory for 100 men, to
be attached to the Toyon group,
rounds out the master plan. Toyon
and the new hall will have their
own dining units and will be served
from the existing Branner kitchen,
leaving Encina Commons to serve
the freshmen.
Remodeling
Encina and Toyon are scheduled
for remodeling. Partitions will di
vide Encina into smaller living
groups, and if Encina Resident Di
rector Mrs. Ellene Sumner wins her
argument, there will be hot and
cold running w.'iter in every room.
Two more residences, similar to
Crothers Hall, will be built for grad
uate men. Two additions will house
approximately 100 men each, and.
will contain a number of double
rooms. Crothers has only single
rooms and house 62 men. The new
dorms probably will be for the grad
uate schools of business and engi
neering, although such a designation
is not yet.definite. All three will be
served from central dining facilities
independent of Encina Commons.
Ideal Women's Location
Both Branner and Casa Ventura
are considered poor locations for
women's dormitories. The ideal lo
cation is in the Lagunita-Roble area,
close to the women's athletic fa
cilities. This probably will be the
site of any future women's resi
dences built.
Casa Ventura, considered a poor
location fbr girls, will go back to
the men, and kitchen facilities will
be added. Sequoia Hall will be razed
to make room for the buildings of the
new Sciehce Quad.
The plans for eating club dining
and recreational facilities, drawn up
last year, are being considered by
the President and the Board of
Trustees. The plans do not call for
independent living quarters. In the
past, the eating clubs had two units
for dining and recreation, but these
were condemned and torn down.
The eating clubs now meet at En
cina Commons.
