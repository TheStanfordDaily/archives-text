# University Has Several Programs To Boost Lagging Endowment Fund
## 
### 
Alumni and friends of Stanford r
are becoming more interested in the j
University's welfare, and more than i
ever before, the University needs
this interest.
To stimulate this interest, the Uni- |
versity is backing several programs '
to bring in needed money. One such ]
program, soon to be started, will j
show undergraduates how they can '
help the University as alumni by
pointing out to them the Univer- |
sity's present financial condition and ]
its future needs.
Another program was started 10
years ago by the Stanford Associates. J
an active group of 300 alumni and |
friends. The Associates send out a j
yearly appeal for small donations,
which make up a large part of the
gift money.
This year, the Associates sent a
series of five letters to alumni ask

ing for gifts. Many come" back in
the form of $5 or $10. But last year
gifts of less than $500 amounted to
over $206,000. Other gifts totaled
$2,130,000.
"Our Plan" is a gift program in
which alumni of various professions
seek oul people who plan to give
or will their money and tell them
of Stanford's needs.
Future Stanford building, with
the exception of the Tresidder Me
morial Union, will be entirely de
pendent on gilts. The Tresidder Me
morial receives the only portion of
tuition earmarked for building, This
amounts to $1 of every tuition,
charged at the request of the ASSU.
At the present, there are three
principal funds accumulating for
future construction. The largest is
the $800,000 Edwards Fund for a
Medical School medical sciences
building.
