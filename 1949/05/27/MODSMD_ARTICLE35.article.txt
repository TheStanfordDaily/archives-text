# 'Shvanda' Gay, Light Fantasy
## 
### DJANE JESSEN 
"Shvanda" delightfully transport
ed its audience to the picturesque,
playful fairyland of childhood last
:iig"ht.
As the colorful cast frolicked
rroin the Czech village up to the
ice Falace and down to Hell, the
- imple and beautiful tale unfolded
112 ihe bagpiper who was condemned
~o live forever in the hearts of all
Czech musicians.
Except for the excellent perform
nee of Caesar Curci. the first scene
passed in mediocre style. It was not
until the curtain rolled up on the
immense Ice Palace scene that it
'ecame evident this performance
■vas to vßnk with "Peter Grimes"
n magnificence if not in depth of
plot.
Exquisite blending of imaginative
costumes and dreamland settings
produce fantasy for the play. Against
This background the principle roles
move with comic gestures which
make the opera lightly enchanting.
Joel Carter as Shvanda and Kaiem
Kermoyan as the devil are particu
larly adept in this comic style. Beta
Popper, the Ice Queen, and Martina
Zubiri. Shvanda's wife, are superb.
;.nd sing their roles most clearly.
The gay, light, and yet very ex
pressive musical score ior this per
ormance makes the opera a delight,
to see.
