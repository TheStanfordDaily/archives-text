# University Looks to the Future
## Building Program 
### 
Stanford's future building pro
gram seems almost overwhelming;
in view of the amount of money
that must he raised to finance it.
Nevertheless, there are two fac
tors which make the future out
look appear more optimistic.
In tlu» first place. Stanford's
multi-million-dollar building pro
gram has hecn projected over a
stt-ycar period. No attempt is be
ing made to complete it over
night. A considerable portion of
this plan can be seen in the air
view picture of the University.
The second factor is the great
amount of building undertaken
during the past two years. The
accompanying picture first ap
peared In The Daily 011 April !>.
1947. At that time, 110 ground
had been broken on any of these
projects. Since then. Ciothers Hall
(1) has been built and put in
operation. Stern Hall, originally
planned for area 2. has been con
structed south of Crothcrs.
Other construction includes the
completed Microwave Laboratory,
first building of the proposed Sci
cnce Quad, and reconstruction of
(lie old Administration Building
which will house the Law School
next January.
(Hher areas marked for future
development are a graduate hous
ing area (3), uni's for married
students and staff (4), a men's
lower division housing unit (5),
and women's housing (6 and 7).
