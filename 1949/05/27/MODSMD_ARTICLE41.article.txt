# Subsurface Wires Leave Farm Free Of Unsightly Poles
## 
### 
Stanford is going indergroundâ€”
as far as Utilities arc concerned.
Recently added to the normal un
derground facilities for water, steam,
and sewage, is the Farm's electric
system, including electricity, com
munications, tire alarm system, and
class bells, thus leaving the campus
free from unsightly telephone poles
and wires.
The underground conduit system
for wiring is iK) per cent finished.
All wiring has been connected to
the new substation on Panama street,
in the middle of the road opposite
the old Corporation Yard substa
tion. The new substation will soon
be linked to the nearest PG&E aer
ial in back of the post office and
be ready for operation.
A new fire alarm system has been
installed, and eventually all Uni
versity buildings will contain lire
alarm boxes.
The entire electrical system makes
two circular loutes around the Uni
versity, beginning cmd ending at
the sub-station. One circular sys
tem lies directly within the other,
and in case of a breakdown on one
system, its load can be transferred
to the other.
The laying of the underground
steam system is about 60 per cent
completed. Later in the year, new
boiler equipment will be installed in
the steam plant to replace the sec
ond-hand, 40-year-old boilers now
in operation. The change will prob
ably be made this summer when
steam is not needed.
Eventually, the steam system will
be extended along the west side of
the campus to serve the new science
buildings. It will then form a com
plete circuit without any dead ends.
The University is using its own
ditch-digger for underground opera
tions. This machine has greatly re
duced the cost of the work and hos
paid for itself many times over.
This summer, an extensive survey
will be made of the future water
and steam needs on campus, and
plans for new facilities will be drawn
accordingly.
