# Stanford Plans Expansion of Academic, Scientific Facilities in Areas Adjacent to the Present Quad
## Master Plan Centers Drama, Music Programs Around Memorial Hall 
### 
Two phases of development have been planned for Stanford's
academic plant, aside from planning for the sciences. One phase
is the renovation of the existing plant to give more floor space
on the Quad. The other is new building to house library material
and the cultural arts.
Perhaps the most important from the standpoint of the Stanford j

family is the renovation of existing i
Quad buildings. This will be an in- [
terior job, and will include the con
struction and modernization of class
rooms and offices.
The Quad is Stanford's trademark,
and the rebuilding within it will be
carried on with this in mind. The
result will be the doubling of work- !
int; space without any change to
existing outside features, so that
academic studies may remain on
the Quad.
Second Floors «
The addition of second floors to I
present one-story buildings will be a j
major step. The University has al- j
ready added ;i second floor to the
mineral science buildings and has j
modernized them with gratifying :
results. Larger buildings such as I
Jordan Hall for biology will be re
constructed inside to eliminate I
wasted space through the center of
the building. Such steps arc al- ;
ready being performed on the old '
Administration Building.
Administration offices will prob- j
ably be placed in the Inner Quad
buildings left by the Law School. ;
Additional building space behind
the new Law Building may be
needed to handle other administra
tion offices. Not until after the Law '<
Building is completed in January. '
]'JSO, will the administration be able
to move out of Encina or the tcm- I
porary buildings.
No Paving Plan
There is no immediate plan to pave 1
the Inner Quad, and plans to recon
struct the Quad islands have been
abandoned at the present because ■
of lack of funds. Present work on
the islands is confined to taking out
trip roots.
The Library Quad will be de
veloped with additional library
space. Hoover Library is fast
reaching the saturation point, and a
connecting building will be needed
eventually to store documents and
literature collected by the library.

Additional stuck spare will he
needed soon for the Main Library,
and it is estimated that within 50
years the present stack space will
have to be doubled. Changes within
the Library to provide better light- '
ing, both real and artificial, are also
planned.
The Art Gallery and the Education
Building will remain in their pres
ent capacities, and no additions arc :
planned.
According to the master plan, 1
audience activities such as music '
and drama will be centered around I
Memorial Hall, an easy location to
reach and get away from by car. j
Opera workshop, art. and music may
be drawn to this area from scat
tered locations throughout the cam
pus. Speech and drama arc already ,
centered about the hall.


STANFORD'S NEW Microwave Laboratory is the future home of the
Farm's claim to atomic fame, the electron linear accelerator, now in the
process of building. The Microwave Lab was completed last winter. It
is the first building of a proposed Science Quad which will centralize
the University's scientific research facilities. —photo by Howard Garnick

result will be the doubling of work- !
int; space without any change to
existing outside features, so that
academic studies may remain on
the Quad.
Second Floors «
The addition of second floors to I
present one-story buildings will be a j
major step. The University has al- j
ready added ;i second floor to the
mineral science buildings and has j
modernized them with gratifying :
results. Larger buildings such as I
Jordan Hall for biology will be re
constructed inside to eliminate I
wasted space through the center of
the building. Such steps arc al- ;
ready being performed on the old '
Administration Building.
Administration offices will prob- j
ably be placed in the Inner Quad
buildings left by the Law School. ;
Additional building space behind
the new Law Building may be
needed to handle other administra
tion offices. Not until after the Law '<
Building is completed in January. '
]'JSO, will the administration be able
to move out of Encina or the tcm- I
porary buildings.
No Paving Plan
There is no immediate plan to pave 1
the Inner Quad, and plans to recon
struct the Quad islands have been
abandoned at the present because ■
of lack of funds. Present work on
the islands is confined to taking out
trip roots.
The Library Quad will be de
veloped with additional library
space. Hoover Library is fast
reaching the saturation point, and a
connecting building will be needed
eventually to store documents and
literature collected by the library.

Additional stuck spare will he
needed soon for the Main Library,
and it is estimated that within 50
years the present stack space will
have to be doubled. Changes within
the Library to provide better light- '
ing, both real and artificial, are also
planned.
The Art Gallery and the Education
Building will remain in their pres
ent capacities, and no additions arc :
planned.
According to the master plan, 1
audience activities such as music '
and drama will be centered around I
Memorial Hall, an easy location to
reach and get away from by car. j
Opera workshop, art. and music may
be drawn to this area from scat
tered locations throughout the cam
pus. Speech and drama arc already ,
centered about the hall.


STANFORD'S NEW Microwave Laboratory is the future home of the
Farm's claim to atomic fame, the electron linear accelerator, now in the
process of building. The Microwave Lab was completed last winter. It
is the first building of a proposed Science Quad which will centralize
the University's scientific research facilities. —photo by Howard Garnick
Two phases of development have been planned for Stanford's
academic plant, aside from planning for the sciences. One phase
is the renovation of the existing plant to give more floor space
on the Quad. The other is new building to house library material
and the cultural arts.
Perhaps the most important from the standpoint of the Stanford j

family is the renovation of existing i
Quad buildings. This will be an in- [
terior job, and will include the con
struction and modernization of class
rooms and offices.
The Quad is Stanford's trademark,
and the rebuilding within it will be
carried on with this in mind. The
result will be the doubling of work- !
int; space without any change to
existing outside features, so that
academic studies may remain on
the Quad.
