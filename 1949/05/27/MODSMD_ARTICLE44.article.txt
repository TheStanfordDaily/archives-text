# Microwave Lab Is First Building Of Proposed Science Quadrangle
## 
### 
The University has a 57,500,000 building program on paper
lor future consideration that would place Stanford's scientific re
search on a level where it would better serve the purposes of
! both students and the public if carried out.
j Consolidation of research processes is the by-word in this

planning. Current trends in science
| makes research more practical if
the physical, chemical, mineral, and
biological sciences cotfld be cen
tralized instead of being scattered
i as they are now.
As with other building plans, the
project depends on gifts or grants
of money.
The consolidated sciences would
be located in a Science Quad in the
area west of the present Quad, with
the Microwave Laboratory forming
the western side.
Research Tie-In
As the master plan is now drawn,
physics, mineral sciences, and engi
: nccring will make up the main Quad,
with the chemistry buildings
grouped near the present Depart
ment of Chemistry. Biology build
ings, which arc not included in the
multi-million dollar building pro
gram, may be constructed north of
the present Chem Building in the
direction of the Museum.
The Organic Chemistry Building,
which is being constructed north of
the Chem Building, would act as a
tie-in between the biological and
chemical sciences.
Existing campus space for scien
tific research is both restrictive and
inadequate. The science depart
ments are scattered to three coi
ners of the Quad and the shop row,
and are house in buildings over 50
years old.
Earthquake Precaution
Among the new science buildings
will be an auditorium with a seat
ing capacity of approximately 1.20(1,
adequate enough to handle a gen
eral biology session.
The buildings are planned one
and two stories in height. They will
be independent units, thus making
them free from possible serious
earthquake damage. (The buildings
on the Inner Quad, planned in the
same manner, suffered little damaue
during the HKMS earthquake.)
