# Women To Keep Branner Until New Residence Built
## 
### 
With Stern Hall almost completed *
and room assignments ready to be
made, the greatest hue and cry from
oIT - campus and Village males is
"When do we get Branner back
from the women?"
The official answer is that Bran
ner cannot be returned to the men
until another hall is built for
women. As yet, there is no money
in the ti l for such a project.
If Branner is of great concern to
the men, Casa Ventrua and Ma
drono are of greater concern to the
University officials. Women will be
withdrawn from these two halls at
the earliest possible moment, ac
cording to Dean of Students Law
rence A. Kimpton.
Dean Kimpton points out that
Madrono, one of the oldest frame
buildings on the campus, is a po
tential fire hazard. Ventura, he
says, is too isolated for practical use
by women, who often must walk
long distances at night to reach it.
Ventura would be turned over to
the men and Madrono would be
razed.
When a new women's dorm is
built, these women will have to be
moved first, the dean said, because
there is no other place to put them.
Only after these two houses are
cleared can the University seriously
consider moving the women out of
Branner, he added.
