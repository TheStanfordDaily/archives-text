# New Health Center Would Combine Treatment, Infirmary, Counseling
## 
### 
People were old-fashioned in
the prewar era, and believed
that the more men and women
students were separated, the
better it would be. As a result,
Stanford maintained two sep
rjrate health centers, with dupli
cate equipment, until 1946.
When Dr. George H. Houck left
the army as a colonel in the Medical

Corps to t:\ke over the health serv
ice in April, 1946, he found the men's
service located in the BAC building
and the women's service in the east
wing of the Women's Gym. Using
the University's plans to consoli
date the two services, Dr. Houck
built the Student Health Center up
to its present status. Three years
atter lus arrival he is just getting
started.
Crowded Quarters
Dr. Houck's crew of six physicians
is serving 8.000 students in quarters
which once served 500 women. Stu
dents must wait in an overcrowded
reception room, packed in with the
center's records and secretarial
staff. Doctors are forced to hold 1
consultation in the same rooms in
which they treatment.
The present service lacks dental j
care, and students have to be sent
to the Palo Alto Clinic for X-rays j
and eye examinations.
Dr. Houck's answer to such prob
lems is a new medical service cen- j
ter, a proposed student service j
building which would incorporate 1

the functions of the rest homes and
the Isolation Hospital, the present
health center located in the east
wing of the Women's Gym, and the
various student counseling services.
ASSU Health Com
Dr. Houck's plan is backed up by
the Student Health Committee, ap
pointed last fall by the ASSU to
survey student health needs. The
committee, headed by Dave Baty,
has submitted its report to the
President office and is ready to push
their recommendations further.
The committee says that the
greatest need is for a safe, up-to
date infirmary. According to Dr.
Houck's conception, this infirmary
would contain 40 to 45 beds in a
series of one- and two-bed rooms,
making up one wing of the building.
The central part of the proposed
building would be devoted to sec
retarial offices and records. A sec
ond wing would contain the health
service with office space for 10
physicians, a number of small wait
ing rooms, more utility and ante
room space for the convenience of

doctors and nurses, and at least two
dental offices.
The third wing of the building
would be devoted to the student j
counseling services that are now 1
scattered hither and yon across the ;
University. With these facilities, i
the committee suggests, the student
counselors could have a chance to j
pool their knowledge on various
cases they review.
Psychiatric teatment and nntitudr i
counseling would be carried on in
the same quarters.
