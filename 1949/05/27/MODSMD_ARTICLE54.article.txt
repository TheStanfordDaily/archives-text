# Circular Road Plan Will Solve Farm Transportation Problems
## 
### 
Ever since gas rationing ended, roads on the Stanford campus
ave been a headache to both drivers and University admin
;trators.
The cause of the trouble is the lack of money available in these
mes of record enrollments. The cure will be time plus a per-

anent circular road system and
introlled parking.
The circular roadway plan, de
sed by University Planner Eld
:ls*e T. Spenser, is constructed to
ve time in crossing the University
id at the same time provide ade
late parking for vehicles and safe
for pedestrians. Any future road
>i k, with the execption of spot re
irs, will be based on this plan, if
Board of Trustees approves it.
Looking Ahead
la drawing up the circular road
tem, University planners have
ked 50 years into the future and
.'e attempted to anticipate Uni
ity development and transpor
ion problems during this time.

s manager, said that the perma

scarcity of money, it would be

point of traffic flow and use by emer
gency vehicles. Any additional
recommendations they have will be
considered in the final plans.
The only building interfering with
the circular road plan is Russell
House, which the University would
like to raze anyway.
Between the two road systems |
and inside the inner network would i
lie a series of parking lots, similar
to the one recently constructed west
of Stern Hall. Surrounded by trees 1
and shrubs, these parking areas |
would make it possible to get parked
cars off the streets. This plan is de
sired for reasons of campus beauty j
and safety.
