# Student Activities Center To include Tresidder Union, Brokaw Memorial
## 
### 
The ASSU has its fingers in the
building butter, and funds are al
ready accumulating for a new stu
dent activities center for extra
curricular and social programs. The
Tresidder Memorial Union and the
Ann Claire Brokaw Memorial are
two buildings already designated for
the student center.
The present site of the Corpora
tion Yard is one of two areas sug
gested for the student activities cen
ter. The other location is across
Santa Teresa from the yard and the
fire house. The administration esti
mates that it would cost $500,000 to
move the Corporation Yard if that
area is used.
One dollar out of every quarter's
tuition is going toward the Tresidder
Union, a memorial to the Univer
sity's late President Donald B. Tre
sidder. The ASSU designated tlie SI
for the new Union after Memorial
Hall was paid for on a similar plan.
The Tresidder Union would con
solidate the Nitery and the Cellar,
and would include a much-needed
ballroom for campus dances.
The Ann Claire Brokaw Me
morial, currently proposed as a
music listening room, is being given
to the University by Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Luce and friends of the for
mer Stanford student, who was Mrs.

Luce's daughter. As a music lis
tening room, it would serve lor stu
dent appreciation of cultural music
and would not be related to the
music department.
Also planned for the student cen- i
ter are a new post office, book store, I
and publications center.
