# J. Jensen Signs Pro With Oaks
## 
### AL BERRY 
As predicted by The Daily, and
'.early everyone else who was in
erested, Jackie Jensen, the Univer
sity of California's great grid star,
■esterday signed a professional
baseball contract.
The surprise of the situation
arne not from "What?" but from
With whom?'' "The word" had
een circulating last week that the
olden-haired fullback would ac
pt a $40,000 deal with the New
fork Yankees, or a substantial J>73.-
>0 deal with t,he Pittsburgh Pi
stes. "The word." again, was
I'oni:. Jensen signed his contract
iiii Oakland ot the Pacific Coast
.eague.
Jcn:tii's contract, however, was a
ne-year job and called for a bonus
m cxoc-ss of 86,000." This deal
.lakes him a "bonus tlayer"' sub
•ct lo Big League draft next Oct.
G.
The Golden Boy will take over his
•uLlitid duties with the Oaks imme
liately. Although he had a fair ree
>rd in the CIBA as a pitcher (won
our, lost seven). Oakland is re
mtedly interested mainly in his
lower at the plate. Jensen batted
J2U lor the Bears last season and
)lasted out eight home runs.
Jensen, who is the best California
i idder since the days of Brick
Mueller, says he will definitely not
jlay professional football. His eol
egiate gridiron days were, of
ourse, over tl:e moment the bulg
ng tullback's pen touched the Oak
and contract.
His engagement to the equally
ilonde Zoe Ann Olsen (of Oakland)
.vill probably be announced next
•veek.
