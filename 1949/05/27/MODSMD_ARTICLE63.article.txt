### DICK KLEIN 
\v ith to JOO entrants ready
to rol', the mural truck tinals will
•eiart at 4 tins afternoon. First race
will begin immediately, and all
qualifiers are required to report to
Angell Field on time.
The much - soulht - after mural
crown is at stake, as the Delta Chi's
have the inside lane to an all-cam
pus track victory for ihe year.
Sporting an over-all point lead and
the most entrants in the finals lo
day, the Eowrren of "Red Ba 1"
fame look like solid favorites.
Heaviest favorite for a winning
performance is platter-tosser John
Boreta, a former all-city discus man
from Lowell High in San Francisco.

Ilis tremendous heave of over 130 |
-eet has already broken the mux a!
mark.
The shot put looms as the closest
battle, with all eight competitors
within three feet. Top qualifier was
Dick Abraham, while Boreta again
lias a good chance. Abraham put
the steel ball almost 4*l feet in the
prelims, another new record.
Leti Collins, a double winner in
the splints last year, is favored in
the 220, and the century remains
wide open. The 100 has already re
quired an extra semi-final, and all
contestants are capable of ten flats. I
Another new record wys racked j
up by Van Johns in the broad jump |
with a leap of 20 feet 3 inches, i

Johns also is entered in the ICO and
the high hurdles.
Frosh Bill iMcColl, the gridiron
flash, can possibly score a duo of
winning efforts in his specialty-—
the hurdles. Big Bill > ses his king
size to advantage. he tees over
the barriers easily.
Both the two entry-packed dis
tance trials fnd the nard-to—cre
tanee events dope out to be mad
scrambles for the first plp.ces. Un

tried but eager, tin expected 50
entrants in the mile and 35 in t:v*
two-mile should be cut down by
.t rt'iiv-mm tin*e.
