# Future Athletic Building Plan Includes Basketball Pavilion
## 
### 
Basketball was in knee britches in 1922 when the Board of
Athletic Control built Stanford's 2,800-seat basketball Pavilion
with $90,000 in athletic profits. Since then, the game has ex
panded into long pants, and the athletic department sadly has
to turn away spectators at the door.
Thus, a basketball pavilion has become one of the chief con-

cerns of the department. Al Mas- |
ters, director of athletics, estimates :
that a new pavilion would cost $800,- !
000. Masters would put 8,000 seats
in his new house. The area east of '
the Men's Gym and near the band |
bungalow has been suggested as a j
possible location.
The new pavilion is only one item 1
on a list of future athletic needs I
Masters recently submitted to the |
President's office at Hie request of
the administration. The athletic di- j
rector submitted two lists, one with j
and one without a new pavilion.
The program with a new pavilion
would cost $878,000, Masters esti
mates. Facilities in the new building
would include eight handball courts, j
eight squash courts, and one room
each for boxing, wrestling, and
weight lifting. At the present, there
are no facilities for squash and
handball.
The present pavilion would con
tain three crosswise intermural bas
ketball courts. The present seats
would be removed and locker and
shower facilities put in where the
lobby and washrooms now are.
The second plan, omitting the new
pavilion, would add the needed fa
cilities mentioned above to the pres
ent gym. In either plan, the floor
of the pavilion would have to be re
placed. Masters said, because it can
not take another sanding.
Both plans call for new bleachers
for the swimming pool and Sunken
Diamond, which now contain seats
built in 1929 and 1930. At the Sta
dium, new team rooms would re
lieve overcrowded quarters now
used. Also, the press box would be
modernized and have a private en
trance, an improvement sports
writers recently have been clamor
ing for.
Masters said tliat except for the
Stadium, the University athletic
plant has a capacity for less than

one-half the number now using it.
He believes that in the long run, the
second plan would cost as much as
the first, and so is heartily in favor
of a new pavilion.
