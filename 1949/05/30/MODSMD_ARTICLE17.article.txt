# Da Cheppie Vehrdsday Ta Blow Summa Abrod
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Translation of
the following passage in Igloo
Language says plainly that the
Chappie will be around on
Wednesday.)
Frustratons iss ragink down on
da Quod,
Kuz lots a' da stoodints hain't
goin' ahrod.
Da zuiuma's ha many iss gonna be
borink,
Kuz oft'a in Uropa dey hisn't tour
ink.
Ilif you liev a thirst for head
venture an thrill
Den kwick buy a Clieppie, dis de
sia ta fill;
Da Old Boy vill bring forth shouts
a' "Hooray"
Mis "Summa Ahrod" issue coinin'
Vendsday.
