# New Student Aid Commission Works on Grant-in-Aid System
## 
### 
Setting up a new system ol'
grants-in-aid is the complex prob
lem confronting the newly created
Student Aid Commission.
Organized as a subcommittee of

the Scholarship Committee under
William C. Bark of the history de
partment. the new commission vvil
revise the fund-granting system
a problem too large for the Scholar
ship Committee to handle in these
days of $(500 tuition.
Because of an increase in appli
cations by veterans whose "time
was running out." and an over-all
demand, Bark said the new com
mission will work out a clarified
procedure and rules by which funds
may be given to deserving students.
The University gives two kinds of
monetary help: scholarships and
grants-in-aid, Bark explained. Un-

like scholarships which are based
upon scholarship excellence, grants?
are awarded chiefly upon the need
of the individual student. Only a
"C" average is required for appli
cation.
These grants are not" loan?, but
are designed to help students not
eligible for scholarships and why
have no other sources of income.
Amounts of each grant vary with
each individual.
Last year, the Board of Trustees
provided $100 grants-in-aid to al
leviate the tuition raise. This fund
is still open to any student wishing
to apply.
Right now the commission already
has about 90 applications for grants,
from which they must select the
final recipients. However, Bark ex
pects the greatest number of re
quests for grants in autumn. But
the Commission plans to apportion
its funds so that additional grants
may be made during the academic
year of 1949-1950.
There are a few specialized grants
available to students. For instance,
there is a memorial benefit fund
open to Stanford men who were en
rolled here before they were in
service. This fund was set up by
the ASSU.
Members of the Student Aid
Commission are Bark; secretary.
George Barahal, veterans' adviser;
one alumni member not yet chosen;
and three student members, Mil
dred Hedberg, Walter Pendergast.
and Hank Grandin.
