## Planning for Education 
### 
Yesterday we thumbed through the planning section of Fri
day's Daily. Here are some typical sentences and phrases that
tlood out in the various stories:
. . . the University is mapping out an extensive plan
ning program which will lead to the development of a broader
curriculum and of greater working facilities tor the students."
"Like all private universities Stanford is faced with the pros
peel of raising money to finance development."
"Stanford was built as a residence campus .... but now—"
". . . . a 516,000,000 housing plan has been designed . . . ."
"Alumni and friends of Stanford are becoming more inter
ested in the University's welfare, and, more than ever before, the
University needs this interest."
"Stanford's future building program seems almost overwhelm
ing in view of the amount of money that must be raised to finance
it."i
a $7,500,000 building program .... for a Science
Quad. As with other building plans, the project depends on gifts
or grants of money."
"How long will the Village be used?"
"When do we get Branner back from the women?"
". . . . roads on the .... campus have been a headache
.... The cause of the trouble is the lack of money available in
these times of record enrollment."
.... the University athletic plant has a capacity for less
than one-half the number now using it."
Before we tie the meaning of those sentences together in a
Kingle thought, here are 11 of the many longiange University
plans as outlined in Friday's Daily:
1. Reach a desired enrollment.
2. Future housing for eating clubs.
3. Make Stanford a full-fledged residence University again.
4. Return Branner to the men when another women's dor
mitory can be built.
5. Expand Stanford's gift program.
6. Renovate the Quad buildings.
7. Build a Science Quad.
8. Expand the services and buildings of the Health Service.
9. Build a circular road system around campus and develop
controlled parking areas.
10. Build a student activities center.
11. Modernize the athletic plan with new facilities and equip
ment.
We can tie this entire building program together in one para
graph by repeating some of the preceding statements:
" the University is mapping out an extensive planning
program which will lead to the development of a broader cur
riculum and of greater working facilities for the students." But
"like all private universities, Stanford is faced with the prospect
of raising money to finance development." The University has
a 50-year program tentatively mapped out, but it needs money
for faculty salaries and plant renovation to reach that end. But
the building program and money are not the ends in themselves.
They are only the means to another end—education, or, "the
cevelopment of a broader curriculum and of greater working
facilities for the students." Education is big business in any
university; it is the only business, and Stanford planners have
not lost sight of that theme.
