ford Convalescent Home.)
Dear Mr. Chavalas:
As Secretary-Treasurer of the Stanford Convalescent Home and for its
Board oj Directors, I should like you to convey to the students of Stan
ford University our appreciation and real gratitude for their unselfish
devotion in working as they have for the benefit of the Home.
i Through the Sophomore Carnival, the Strawberry Brunch at the Union,
the Tag Day Drive, the movie, the open houses, and the personal solici
tation for additional funds in Palo Alto, the endowment of the Home has
been added to most substantially.
These activities, in spite of the late date and the bad weather, have
done more for the Home than just to add to the financial support that
it needs to cany on its work for the undernourished and underprivileged
children who are under its care.
It has acquainted hundreds of people, who otherwise might not have
known ot it. with the type and character of the service furnished by this
deceiving charity which, we are informed, is a model of its kind in its
efficiency and the position which it occupies in the community.
