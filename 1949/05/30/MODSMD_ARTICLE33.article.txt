### Priscilla Claudius 
Perhaps merely national pride, or
lack of knowledge has long inclined
Americans to think of the fabulous
Beaumarchais only as the man who
helped finance the American revolu
tion. But before that event, Beau
marchais' life was one of the most
daring and colorful of the French
court in the 1850's.
Beaumarchais was indeed a fas
cinating character. Few men have
risen so high or lived so long only
by their wits.
Born the son of a Parisian watch
maker, Pierre-Augustine Caron in
a lew years became Beaumarchais,
companion to the four daughters of
Louis XV. Yet, throughout his life,
he never had many friends. Still,
the friends he did make were in
fluential enough to allow Beaumar
chais to acquire both position and
wealth.
His life was always exciting.
Twice a widower, many times a
lover, wonder of Madrid society, a
King's judge, a duelist, musician,
merchant and author of "The Bar
ber of Seville" and"The Marriage
of Figaro," as well as financier,
Beaumarchais' story seems more like
the most fantastically romantic fic
tion than the biography of a real
person. His 67 years were fully
spent.
Lemaitre, a professor in the Ro
manic Languages Department here,
has skillfully traced the development
ol the fabulous Frenchman's career.
The book is lively and easy to read.
One only wonders why such a bril
liant and sparkling story should
have been left so long unwritten.
