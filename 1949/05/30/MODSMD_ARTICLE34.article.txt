(Editor's Note: In light of the
political turmoil at USC over the
recent student body elections. The
Daily reprints portions of a letter
, to the Daily Trojan suggesting
; election remedies.)
Editor, Daily Trojan:
.... The left thigh of each per
! son voting should be branded with
! a hot iron with the letters "SC."
This would prevent double voting
and make the task of the checkers
| much more enjoyable.
i Five hundred balloons should be
; dropped off the top of the Union
| each day of the elections at noon.
One hundred balloons would contain
an ID card and three ballots. This
| would immeasurably increase the
1 competitive spirit of the election.
Fraud is obviously present in
i connection with the new election.
The election is being held Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday and
everyone knows that those are the
three opening days of Hollywood
Park. Therefore, a majority of stu
dents won't be able to attend classes
! those days.
II the election commission was in
terested in getting out the majority
| of the vole, it would set up booths
1 at Vincc's, the 901 at Sorrento, or
j the fire escapes of the Chi Omega
1 House, and other places where there
is a large flow of students.
Elections are out of vogue in
democratic countries. The whole is
sue could be settled much more
fairly by having the principal con
testants have a pogo-stick race
down University avenue at 3 a.m.
i following the senior prom.

That tasty meat flavor in your
favorite canned soup isn't all due
lo meat.
UCLA amino acid experts ex
: plained that a jaw-breaker amino
acid product — mono-sodium-gluta
mate —is used to augment the small
meat particles in the soup.
Food and Drug Administration au
thorities required that this acid be
marked on the can label. The UCLA
experts have developed a quick
qualitative method for detecting un
labeled mono-sodium-glutamate. In
the soup, that is.
