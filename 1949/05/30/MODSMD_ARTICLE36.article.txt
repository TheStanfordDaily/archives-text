## Foreign Student Orientation 
### 
To the Editor:
Last Monday, May 23, 19-19. one of those truly wonderful ideas was set
into words and formed a few columns in The Daily. This particular idea
dealt with the foreign students in Stanford. It proposed that American
students should play host and hostess to the foreign students during their
first two or three weeks at the University.
I, as a foreign student, believe that this idea, if put to action, will be
a great help to the students who come to America from countries where
life, traditions, even food, are very different than those in the United
States. The idea is excellent provided, of course, it be executed in the
right way.
What I mean is that American students who are kind enough to accept
the execution of this plan must always—l repeat, always—remember that
they are being host, or hostess, to a student who has come to this country
with great expectancies. They must never -forget that each one of these
students is another Columbus who has crossed the ocean only to discover
the real America, the land he has seen upon the screen of his hometown
theater, the land of—as the movies claim—too practical lovers and too
fantastic gangsters.
Disillusioning these explorers is the most necessary tiling. This is what
this idea will do, and should do. American students who accept the exe
cution of this idea will profit by their help greatly. They will learn about
new lands, about new people, about new ideas.. They will have laughs
and they will learn a great deal, and the foreign students will share these
laughs and learnings with them.
It may be argued that these foreign students will learn all they have
to know about America themselves. I agree with that, but this they will
do the very hard way—the unnecessarily hard way. It is much better 10
help them discover America.
I can tell you how I discovered what a foreign student must do upon
his arrival at Stanford. I found out all I should have done after:
1. I paid $20 to a cab driver to bring me to Palo Alto from San Francisco
Airport. Later on I was told that 1 could have saved $19 by taking the
bus—and between ourselves 1 had so many other uses for those $19.
2. I walked more than three miles across the campus, from one office
to the other, just to find out how 1 should fill out my registration book—
it was more than tiring.
I spent all night pacing up and down the streets of Palo Alto because
the man behind the desk in the President Hotel told me that, according to
laws of California, 1 had to be "two in order to be able to rent a double
room, the only kind available on the night of Sept. 23, 1946. I tried to
find a roommate, but 1 failed (and you know how!).
•4. And I found out after living through a kind of delirium for two or
three weeks.
Thinkjng back, I wish someone had thought of this new idea sometime
before the fall of 194(5. Then I could talk about my pleasant adventures,
and the number of friends 1 made, during my first twoVveeks at Stanford.
