An item in Flic Daily says Stanford lias hnd three tennis players who
have ranked among the 10 top amateur players in the country." The
Daily is much too modest. Lin Murray was national champion in ]017
and 1018. Johnny Doeg in 19.10. Fred Schroeder in 1042. In addition
Keith Gladhill was No. 8 in 1031 and 1032. Cranston Holeman was 8 in the
mid twenties. Before that, Phil Neer was intercollegiate champion;
whether he made the first 10. 1 don't recall. There may have been others
among the Stanford greats of the past.
