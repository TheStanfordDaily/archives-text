# Frosh Smash Cubs; Netters Unbeaten
## 
### 
In a return match, the California I
Cubs again failed to take a single
set from the powerful Stanford
frosh, as the Indians won the Sat
urday morning tussle, 9-0.
The top singles player, George
Gentry, and the top tandem of
Gentry-Tom Lewyn had the easiest
time, winning by default. Dick
Norton, Cal's ranking player, failed
to appear on the courts due to a
previous tiff with a chem exam.
Ernie Dußray won over Murch,
6-1 and 6-2, and Tom Lewyn
trounced his singles opponent Cum
mings, 6-1, 6-1, in helping rout the
hapless Cubs for the final match in
an undefeated season. Complete re
