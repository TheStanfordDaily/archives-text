# Varsity Tops Alums, 11-5. In Harry Wolter's Finale
## 
### 
A great era in Stanford baseball I
history came to an end Saturday J
afternoon, as Harry Wolter coached |
his last Stanford team to an 11 to 5
victory over the alumni in the final
game of the season.
It was Harry Wolterday at the
Sunken Diamond, and Harry really
had a day for himself as hundreds
of his friends and former ball play
ers turned out to honor Stanford's
coach, who is retiring after 26 years
as head baseball mentor.
At the end of the sixth inning
Harry challenged the members of
Stanford's 1913 squad to see what
they could do against his southpaw
hurling. In facing 18 batters, he
struck out two with a curve ball
that was breaking more than a foot,
while allowing only five base hits.
When Harry's turn at the plate
came, Stanford's all-time £reat ath
lete, Ernie Nevers, went to the
mound, and Coach Wolter came
; through with a couple of smashes to
j right field.
