### 
SEATTLE, May 29 — Mel Patton,
currently the world's fastest human,
plans to retire from the starting
blocks at the end of this season.
But ho still thinks "I'm better
now than I was last year."
The Olympic ace relaxed yester
day after bucking a six-mile breeze
to breeze in first in the 100 and 220
yard dashes in the Pacific Coast
Conference track meet. A great
team man, he said:
"I eased up in both of them when
I knew I'd won. It was the race we
wanted . There was no sense going
all out after it was won."
He did the century in 9.7 and the
220 in 21.3. Both are slow for Pat
ton, but he said "if I could have
won it in 10.5, I'd have won it in
10.5. The points are what counts."
Patton said he intends to take a
track coaching iob at some Cali
fornia junior college after his re
tirement from active running. He's
24 years old and says "maybe I'd bo
better next season, but nobody will
ever know, I guess. I'm quitting for
good."
