## 
### DICK KLEIN 
In a nip and tuck battle down to
the final wire, the Delta Chi's
caught the Dekes in the last event
of the mural track meet to tie up
the score at 23 points apiece. The
two Row houses share the all-cam
pus track title that was decidcd Fri
day afternoon.
With the score 22-19 in favor of
the Dekes before the relay, the
"Red Bailers" grabbed a second
place and the leaedrs faded to a
fifth that closed the three-point gap
on the basis of the 5-4-3-2-1 scor
ing.
Bill McColl was the meet's indi
vidual star, as he broke a record
winning the football throw at 198
feet, got another blue ribbon in the
high hurdles, and placed second in
the lows. Bill's total was a nifty 14
points.
The relay was won by the Phi
Delt foursome in the speedy time
of 1:37. This time breaks the old
record set by the Phi Delts last
year. Old time was 1:38.8.
After the tie for first place be
tween the Dekes and Delta Chi's,
Encina 2VV (paced by McColl) and
the Zetes each scored 10 points for
third place. Next in totals were the
SAE's with 14'j.
