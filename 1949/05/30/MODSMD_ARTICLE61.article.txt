# Russia Walks Out of Model UN Assembly Group; Stanford's Atlantic Pact Discussion Receives Praise
## Minor Nations Split on Resolutions; Session Votes 58-1 to Reconvene 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Russia'® dramatic walkout from the General Model Assembly-
Friday afternoon was just one of the many evidences that Stan
ford was re-enacting the atmosphere of Lake Success.
Dr. Charles Malik skilfully guided the session, keeping speak
ers within their alloted time and seeing that they adhered to

UN procedure.
Dr. Lawrence A. Kimpton, tem
porarily abandoning his title as
Jean to take over the postion of
Secretary of State, opened the As
sembly. He said that a model as
sembly had special importance when
it was carried out by young people !
because it reflected their feeling of j
optimism.
The report of the First (political i
ind security) Committee, given by j
Dr. Harold Fisher, explained that !
he UN hacl not been able to per
form its functions because certain |
countries have not observed their
duties.
U.S. Scores Victories
The United States scored vic
tories in both the main resolutions j
j.nd in the amendments. Don Scott,
presenting the resolution of the
United States, called down Russia
for blocking the peace. George Vel
iiotes, a reasonable facsimile of Gro- j
nylco, retaliated in convincing Rus- !
dan, that the North-Atlantic Pact, j
■since it excluded Russia, was in
consistent with the UN. The In
dian draft resolution as presented by j
Conrad von Bibra, asked for a j
niddle-of-the-road policy, support
ing the North-Atlantic Pact by
vorking through the United Nations.
Smaller member nations were split ;
jp on the main resolutions but the
majority favored the U.S. resolu
tion to adopt the North-Atlantic i
Pact. The vote for the U.S. resolu
tion was the amendment was 31 for,
9 against, 15 abstained. The vote on
the Russian resolution was 7 for, 39
against, 9 abstained. Indian vote, j
L 2 for, 21 against. 22 abstained.
U.S. Amendment Passed
Four amendments were presented:
one from Denmark, Bolivia, Siam.
and the United States. The U.S.
amendment was the only one that
managed to obtain a majority vote. !
The most surprising event of the j
isasembly was the Bolivian amend
ment which advocated a revision of '
:he Charter in connection with arti
cle 109. Because this was a sub
stantive issue it needed a two-thirds
majority to pass and was defeated. !
although the vote was 29 for, 4
against, and 24 abstained.
Points of Order Stumble
The assembly ran smoothly al
though it was frequently inter
rupted by an overabundance of !

"points of order." Dr. Malik had
difficulty in reminding the delega
tions to keep to a point of order in
stead of expounding their own ideas.
One of these points of order was
when the U.S. delegation accused
the Chilean delegation of misrepre
sentation and asked for his creden
tials to be examined. Everything
was proved to be in order, however.
Because the assembly ran so late.
Dr. Malik postponed his speech until
the banquet. In his talk he empha
sized the importance of the Declara
tion of Human Rights because they
were inherent, natural rights. He
also brought out the splendid work
that the Economic and Social Coun
cil had keen doing without much
publicity. He explained that if peo
ple noted more what the Economic
and Social Council was doing instead
of just devoting their attention to
the Security Council, they would
realize that the United Nations is
doing constructive work.
The Model Assembly ended with
a 58 to 1 vote to have another as
sembly next year. A motion to have
the assembly on the revision of
the charter was defeated.
