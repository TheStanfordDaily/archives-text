# Heart Disease Lab to Be Built
## 
### 
Establishment of a Cardiovascular
Research Laboratory, one of the few
such centers in the West, has been
announced by Dean Loren R. Chan
dler of the Stanford Medical School.
The lab will be installed in the
Stanford Hospital and Medical
School in San Francisco. It is being
paid for by contributions from the
Both in Fund and sifts of interested
local people.
It will he used to diagnose con
genital heart disease in hospital pa
tients and to develop and perfect
new medical techniques.
The most dramatic of the new
techniques will be heart catheteri
zation. A slender, hollow tube is
inserted into the arm and is passed
from there into :he chambers of the
heart.
The catheter is vised together with
a fluoroscope. This process, said
Dean Chandler, gives information
which prevents useless surgery and
gives doctors a clear picture of what
defects can be corrected surgically.
