## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Dr. Charles Malik, Lebanese dele
gate to the UN General Assembly,
seemed very pleased with Stanford's
Model Assembly and felt that here
it was a necessary jolt to make us
aware of international events.
Since the days of the San Fran
cisco Conference in 1945, which he
attended. Dr. Malik has seen the UN
going on a downhill road. People
are now more hardened in their
hearts toward the UN; they don't
have the great spirit that was evi
dent at San Francisco.
He explained that the cause of this
was the conflict between the
and the \Ve>t. the luck of confidence
they felt for each other.
