# Atlantic Pact Brings Confidence
## 
### 
"If the Atlantic Pact brings confi
dence to the powers meeting at
Paris, it will have done some good."
Dr. Malik feels that the North-
Atlantic Pact is a "good tonic for
the UN and believes in its neces
sity. He hopes that it will not make
the U.S. teel secure enough to for
get the other parts of the world.
When asked if the Pact would not
weaken the UN since it was outside
of its jurisdiction, he replied that if

: the member-nations remain loyal to
the UN. the North-Atlantic Pact
would not hurt the UN, but provide
! the needed security.
Big Two "So Green"
The U.S. and Russia, whose fate
the world lies in, are both "so
green." he said. The rest of the
; world has to sit by and suffer while
! these two inexperienced nations, so
rich and powerful, fight for their
way. Dr. Malik added that given
I another 100 years. America will have
matured, ripened, and have expe
! rienced the "mellowness of tragedy"
to give her the experience to lead
the world.
He advised that in the assembly
j planned fur next year, students
shou'.d devote at two days for
the assemblv.
