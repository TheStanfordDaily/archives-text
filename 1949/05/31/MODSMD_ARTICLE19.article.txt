## Inadequate Lighting 
### 
Confucius says,"The lamp of one house cannot light two
houses." Assuming that proverb to be true, we offer this fact:
Stanford University is an example of a community having
veiy poor street lighting—lighting so inadeguate that it is an
invitation to trouble.
The Lower Row from the Post Office to Mayfield is the most
unsatisfactory area for street lighting on campus. Palm Drive
lighting is worthless because the weak bulbs used in the few
fixtures on that road hardly do more than mark a cross street.
The street running from the Post Office to The Oaks to Lomita
Drive is not lighted sufficiently except by oncoming au-to head
lights. The Bookstore corner—virtually the center of campus
life —offers a ripe invitation for an assault or robbery.
Most of these areas listed above lack lighting. But in nearly
every case where there is street lighting, the fixtures do not
have strong bulbs. In a few cases the weak lights are strung
up so high that their value is negligible.
Street lighting is a necessity where large groups of people
live. It offers protection against assault and robbery, and it
serves to guide pedestrians and motorists. We wonder if the
price of safety and security is too expensive here.
