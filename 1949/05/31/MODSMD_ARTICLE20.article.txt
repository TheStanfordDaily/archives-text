To the Editor:
As for the claims made by university presidents that Communists should
be precluded from teaching because they are "intellectually dishonest"
and not "free agents," each student, especially Mr. Syka, should ask himself
these questions:
1. Are you likely to find an "intellectually honest" person subscribing
to a doctrine which openly advocates to its followers deceit in any form
that will.serve to further its ends?
2. Assuming that he is sincere, assuming that he wants to make this
world a better place in which to live, is any person really a "free agent"
if he is so easily swayed by false standards garbed in altruistic phrase
ology that he will fight on the side of those who would destroy every
thing which has so far been gained in improving the mental, moral, and
physical welfare of mankind?
One fact seems to be continually overlooked. Communism is not merely
a political philosophy or an economic system. It is also an anti-God
religion whose adherents are no more fit to have, a hand in forming the
mir\ds of our youth than a proponent of free love, sadism, or devil-worship.
Their claim to free speech is no more valid than that of the Jew-baiter
or the slanderer.
If they actually believe in their cry for "academic freedom" they de
serve dismissal solely on grounds of mental incompetency.
