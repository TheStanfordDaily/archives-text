# Loyalty Bills
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Several bills which affect the future of every person in California are
coming up before the state assembly shortly. A few of these "loyalty
bills," introduced by Senator Jack Tenney, will have a direct effect on
every student and professor in this state.
Senate Bill 129 defines "Communism" as the political theories of Marx
or as a form of government under which title to most production facilities
are held by the government. A "Communist" js a person who circulates
or publicly displays any work advocating "Communism." Bill 130 re
quires a "loyalty" oath of all state school teachers and forbids the teach
ing of "foreign political ideologies" (Communism, Fascism, etc.) on school
property. What constitutes the difference between "presenting facts" and
"advocating" is not made clear. Other bills apply similar restrictions to
other people.
As one of the 300 students in this state who went up to Sacramento
May 23 to lobby against the Tenney Bills. 1 feel that students are entitled
to know about the apathy and ignorance that exists on the subject in
the capitol. Some assemblymen had not read the bills, and most of them
did not know how they thought about these bills which affect the economic
and political future of all of us!
I would urge all students to read the bills and write to their assembly
men (Kirkwood. Santa Clara County; Dolwig. San Muteo County) to
vote against them. If Bill 1.10 passes, such a course as Western Civ could
be outlawed. It is the duty of students to fight for academic and political
freedomâ€”and certainly to their interests to do so!
