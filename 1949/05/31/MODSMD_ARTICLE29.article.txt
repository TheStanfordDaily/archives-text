# Book Scrutinizes Kings River Issues
## 
### 
The majority of the Hoover Com
mission aren't the only ones mad at
the Army Engineers. In Califor
nia's Central Valley the Engineers
and the Bureau of Reclamation
have long been criticized for their
extravagant battling over building.
Public attention is shifting from
the 160-acre limitation fight to this
wasteful conflict between the Army
Engineers and the Interior Depart
ment's Bureau of Reclamation.
The Hoover Commission's recla
mation report suggested transferring
the Army Engineers' "civil func
tions" to the Interior Department, a
recommendation so politically in
flammable that Congressional fire
works seemed inevitable.
In his history of the Central Val
ley Project. "The Thirsty Land"
(Stanford University Press). Rob
ert de Roos gives careful scrutiny
to both issues involved and presents
a brief and clear picture of this
Kings River trouble.
