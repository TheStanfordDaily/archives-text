# Jensen Successful In Triple A Debut
## 
### 
Cal's gift to tl'e baseball world,
Jackie Jensen, made his start in
the professional ranks with Oak
land last weekend as the latter
dropped three out of four to Se
attle.
However. Jackie managed to
slam out five hits, one of them a
double, in l(i trips to the plate for
a fat .312 average. lie committed
one error Friday night when he
overthrew third in an attempt to
catch a runner.
L<vcal interest was definitely
aroused" hv Jensen's signing as in
dicated by the increased week
end attendance. The Oaks drew
6,500 on Friday, 5.500 on Satur
day,. ami 7.200 on Sunday, which
isn't bad for a second division
club. At any rate it seems
that owner Brick Laws made a
good investment when he signed
Jackie.
This week the Seals hope Jen
sen will attract a few people to
the Pot rem Street grounds, which
is something Seal athletes have
been unable to do thus far this
season.
