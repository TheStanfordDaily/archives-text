## Holland Triumphs In Record Time 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS, May .'JO </P> â€”
Fortune rode alongside jubilant Billv
Holland in the 500-mile automobile
race today.
Holland, 41-year-old driver of
Reading, Pa., scorched the bricks of
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
with record-breaking speed to win
in 4 hours, 7 minutes, 15.97 seconds.
He averaged 121.377 miles an hour,
lastest time in the 33-year history
of the event.
This performance blotted out the
track record ot 119.8113 miles an hour
established by Mauri Rose, South
Bend, Ind., a three-time winner, in
winning the 1948 race.
Holland won with five miles to
spare.
Closest to Holland, winner of
about 545.000 in prize money, was
Johnny Parsons. Burbank, Calif.,
with George Connor, Los Angeles,,
third. Myron Fuhr, of Milwaukee,
a first-time driver in the event, fin
ished fourth. Fifth was Joie Chit
wood. Cherokee Indian from Read
ing. Pa.
Holland, who finished second to
Rose in the 1947 and 1948 race.?,
took two years to hit the jackpot.
The ill-luck that cost Holland the
victory in the 1947 race when he
misjudged a signal from his pit crew
fell today to his teammate, Rose, who
was forced to quit 20 miles from the
finish when his engine stalled on
the southwest turn. The car had to
be dragged off the track.
Rose, seeking his third consecu
tive triumph, was in second place at
the time.
