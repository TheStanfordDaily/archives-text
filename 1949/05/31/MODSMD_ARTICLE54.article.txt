# Law School Progresses Toward 1950 Completion
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
"Danger—Keep Out" signs have
enticed the curious to stop and
peer inside the old Administration
Building for almost nine months.
Strong steel and concrete struc
tural work, erected by Wagner and
Martnez, is transtorming the rangy
old building into a modern home
for the Stanford School of Law.
But it will be almost nine more
rnonihs, according to Eldridge T.
Spencer, University director of
planning, before the school is fin
ished. Completion is scheduled for
the beginning of winter quarter,
1950.
Before work started the building
was more or less a hollow shell.
The lofty main hall, which rosf
from the ground floor to the roof
wasted space. The remodeling, says
Spencer, will conserve space and
will strengthen the outer walls.
Three floors o! steel - reinforcevl
stacks will contain the Law Li
brary. It is this steel, Spencer
pointed out that will give the stone
walls horiz/fntal support.
Sturdy Building
Most of t . original Quad build
ings, he said were liable to be
<?reatly in an earthquake.
Their heavy outer walls surrounded
empty, high-ceilinged interiors. The
Law Building, however, will be
sturdier and safer.
The entire building, four floors
and a mezzanine, could be described
as a central cube surrounded by
halls on all four sides, which in
turn open into outer rooms.
Most of the rooms to be used by
students (except the stacks) will be
located for convenience on the first
and second floors. Faculty rooms
will be higher up.
A sloping lecture room, holding
150, will take up the "cube part" of
the first floor and mezzanine. Stacks
start in the center of the second
floor. Across the windowed front
fo this floor will run a long reading
room. Two more reading rooms will
be located in back.
Moot Court
This arrangement, says Spencer,
fits in with a new theory of study
space—several low-ceilinged, well
lighted rooms instead of one large
room.
This floor will also hold a moot
court room, equipped like a real
courtroom, and a classroom holding
110.
Into the basement will go a stu
dent lounge, a mimeograph room, a
shipping and receiving room, and
lockers.
Most of the lighting will be fluo
rescent. Floors will be linoleum
over concrete. An elevator and a
booklift will span the center section.

"Danger—Keep Out" signs have
enticed the curious to stop and
peer inside the old Administration
Building for almost nine months.
Strong steel and concrete struc
tural work, erected by Wagner and
Martnez, is transtorming the rangy
old building into a modern home
for the Stanford School of Law.
But it will be almost nine more
rnonihs, according to Eldridge T.
Spencer, University director of
planning, before the school is fin
ished. Completion is scheduled for
the beginning of winter quarter,
1950.
Before work started the building
was more or less a hollow shell.
The lofty main hall, which rosf
from the ground floor to the roof
wasted space. The remodeling, says
Spencer, will conserve space and
will strengthen the outer walls.
Three floors o! steel - reinforcevl
stacks will contain the Law Li
brary. It is this steel, Spencer
pointed out that will give the stone
walls horiz/fntal support.
Sturdy Building
Most of t . original Quad build
ings, he said were liable to be
<?reatly in an earthquake.
Their heavy outer walls surrounded
empty, high-ceilinged interiors. The
Law Building, however, will be
sturdier and safer.
The entire building, four floors
and a mezzanine, could be described
as a central cube surrounded by
halls on all four sides, which in
turn open into outer rooms.
Most of the rooms to be used by
students (except the stacks) will be
located for convenience on the first
and second floors. Faculty rooms
will be higher up.
A sloping lecture room, holding
150, will take up the "cube part" of
the first floor and mezzanine. Stacks
start in the center of the second
floor. Across the windowed front
fo this floor will run a long reading
room. Two more reading rooms will
be located in back.
Moot Court
This arrangement, says Spencer,
fits in with a new theory of study
space—several low-ceilinged, well
lighted rooms instead of one large
room.
This floor will also hold a moot
court room, equipped like a real
courtroom, and a classroom holding
110.
Into the basement will go a stu
dent lounge, a mimeograph room, a
shipping and receiving room, and
lockers.
Most of the lighting will be fluo
rescent. Floors will be linoleum
over concrete. An elevator and a
booklift will span the center section.
