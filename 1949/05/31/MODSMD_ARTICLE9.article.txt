# Tuesday Evening Series Features Dickens Classic
## 
### 
"Great Expectations," the 1947
Academy Award-winning film, will
be shown tonight at 7:30 in Memo
rial Hall. The J. Arthur Rank pro
duction will conclude the Tuesday
Evening Series for spring quarter,
but the series will resume June 28
for the summer.
Faithful to the original Dickens
classic, "Great Expectations" is the
tale of a simple country boy who,
through the assistance of an un
known benefactor, becomes a "dan
dy" in London society.
With the vivid caricature typical
of Dickens, the complex plot in
volves a psychoneurotic spinster
who, jilted at the altar, refuses to
face reality and still wears her yel
lowed wedding gown.
The British film, released in this
country through Universal Studios,
stars John Mills, Valerie Hobson,
and Jean Simmons.
