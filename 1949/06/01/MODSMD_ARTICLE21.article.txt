## Editor's Notebook 
### 
Today is problem day. Some of the items that appear below
have received editorial comment before, and their importance
is such that we again present them to our readers.

First, the problem of hometown addresses in the Bawlout is
an issue because their great need is partially offset by the addi
tional cost in typing and printing which purchasers would have to
pay. Students' home addresses would make the Bawlout com
plete as an information booklet because graduating seniors, fac
ulty members, and administration officials would have a ready
reference to the statistics. Such addresses would be an added
convenience to students during the Christmas season.

Second, the wooden steps leading to the Geology Corner of
the Quad are in a dangerous state of disrepair. The steps are
especially hazardous when they are wet. It would be well to
replace these steps as soon as possible because the University
would be liable in a lawsuit if a pedestrian slipped on them or
if one of the steps broke under his weight.

Third, the temporary buildings are a postwar misfit that were
built to fill in a temporary lack of office space. They were con
structed so cheaply and hurriedly, however, that no provision
was made for an air-conditioning system. Nearly all of the offices,
moreover, lack even primitive air-conditioning units such as elec
tric fans. Since the buildings have metal roofs, the rooms heat
up and working efficiency, therefore, is cut down. In view of the
hot weather coming up, it would be well to equip the buildings
with some sort of air-conditioning equipment.

Fourth, one of the most fantastic problems is the one at the
two general delivery Post Office windows. At one window an
A through M breakdown exists, while the remainder of the stu
dents collect mail from the second window. Since the numerical
median of the alphabet is the letter "K," long lines of students
pile up at the first window during rush hours. The two alphabet
groups should be changed to A through K and L through Z.
