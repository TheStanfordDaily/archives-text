Danger of Communist Teachers

To the Editor:
Recent letters in The Daily indicate that there are at Stanford both
faculty members and students who believe or pretend to believe that
there is no danger in allowing Communists to teach in our colleges. Such
thinking indicates either subservience to the principles of Communism
or extreme gullibility.
Proof that the Communist Party is attempting to warp the minds of
American youth through their teachers is found in the Communist lit
erature. The following is a quotation from"The Schools and the People's
Front" by Richard Frank, an article in "The Communist" for May, 1937.
"Those educators which follow the party line must mobilize the other
teachers in this fight. They must take advantage of their positions, with
out exposing themselves, to give their students to the best of their ability
working class education.
"Only when teachers have really mastered Marxism-Leninism, will they
bt able to inject it into their teaching at the least risk of exposure and
at the same time to conduct the struggle around schools in a truly
Bolshevik manner."'
This article and the books of which it is typical explain how the Leninist
poison can be "smuggled" into every school course from literature and
history to physics and mathematics. Obviously this is not done by openly
advocating the principles of Communism. The plan of attack is much
more insidious such as attempting to convince students that Communism
should be considered on a plane with any other political party or system;
that it is of no more consequence whether a man be a Democrat, a Re
publican, an Abolitionist, or a Communist.
An example of this kind of thinking can be found in Dr. Weymouth's
letter of May 27.
