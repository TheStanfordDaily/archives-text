### Priscilla Claudius 
GO FIGHT CITY HALL by Ethel
Rosenberg (Simon and Schuster)
"Mrs. Pasternak is calling you."
Mrs. Kugel says presently. Mrs.
Rivkin listens intently, nods her
heads and then goes to the door.
"You're calling me, Frieda?" she
asks in a loud voice.
"I'm calling you," Mrs. Pasternak
says, standing in the doorway of her
apartment. "What are you doing?
You're busy with something?"
"Why am I busy?" Mrs. Rivkin
shrugs.
"So if you're not busy, come in,
and we'll have a glass of tea."
"Mrs. Kugel is in my house."
"So bring Mrs. Kugel . . . ."
"And Morris is also here . . . ."
"What's so terrible?" Mrs. Paster
nak asks impatiently. "So bring
Morris, too. I thank God there is
enough tea for everybody."
That is the Brooklyn that Ethel
Rosenberg describes in her first
novel, GO FIGHT CITY HALL. It.
is far different from the squalor and
discontent that Betty Smith depicted
in "A TREE GROWS IN BROOK
LYN."
Miss Rosenber's characters are
! the inhabitants of a Brooklyn apart
â€¢ ment house where everyone knows
what everyone else is doing, and
very little else.
They are all high-spirited, warm
: hearted, and thoroughly lovable
characters. Their modest triumphs
: are celebrated by all. Their petty
defeats are generally accepted with
good humor.
And, as befits these realistic little
people, there is no central plot to
, the story. Nor is one necessary. For
it is these pepole themselves, their
j attitudes, and their idiosyncracies
that are entertaining.
It is more nearly a journal of their
I adventures. Some of the best chap
ters' titles are self-explanatory. For
example: "Julius Pasternak and the
Bureaucrats, Julius Pasternak and
King George the Fifth, Mrs. Rivkin
Grapples with the Drama, A Serpent
in the Garden .of Rivkin. and the
Plot by the Fence and The Du
plicity of Kugel."
GO FIGHT CITY HALL is won
derful light reading. Once the front
cover is opened, the reader finds
himself living with the most en
gaging group of screwballs anyone
could ever hope to meet. The book
is generally delightful from start to
finish.
