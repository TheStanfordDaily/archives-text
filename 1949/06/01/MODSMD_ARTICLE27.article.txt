CANBERRA, Australia — Secret
weapons already are being tested on
the British Commonwealth Rocket
Range in South Australia.
So far only a small part of the
lange has been used. The full range
may be ready for vise the end of this
year, but perhaps not until much
later.
The Sydney Sunday Herald says
weapons being tested—many of them
known only to a handful of senior
scientists, high service officers and
cabinet members—include:
A rocket bomb designed to carry
an atomic warhead.
A jet-propelled flying wing bomb.
A bomb which follows a moving
target.
New jet-propelled aircraft.
New types of gliders.
Direction-finding beams operated
from aircraft. (In tests, the beams
follow a truck and guide bombers
to the "kill.")
Anti-tank weapons which can de
stroy the largest tank now in use.
A new explosive for firing rockets.
This is a variant of cordite; in
vented by Australian scientists.
