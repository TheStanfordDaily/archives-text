WASHINGTON—Rep. Vinson (D-
Ga.) has a special reason for being
chagrined at the House's action in
sending his military pay-raise bill
back to committee.
It spoiled his record. Never before
in his 1(> years as chairman of the
Naval AfTairs Committee and later of
the Armed Services Committee, had
the House ever sent back to com
mittee a bill which he had pre
pared.
Capitol Hill seers predict Vinson
will make the most strenuous efforts
to bring the bill back to the floor

this season—and they won't be as
tonished if he succeeds.
