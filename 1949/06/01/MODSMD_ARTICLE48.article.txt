# Cardinal Free-Lancers Capture Second in Volleyball Tourney

### DAN WINSTON 
Yakety. yakety, yak! That is all
the Stanlord sports family seems to
want to do these days. The contro
versy over major and minor letters
has been long and bitter.
But in the midst of all the squab
bling there is a bright spot.
A few days ago there was an item
in The Daily about a Stanford vol
leyball team placing second in the
collegiate division of the Inter
national Volleyball Championships,
held in Los Angeles.
Didn't know we had a volleyball
team, did you? Well, we haven't.
That is, we don't have an organized
team that holds regular practice
sessions, or has a coach, or has any
support from the University.
Seven Stnntord men, Jim Harris,
Larry Day, George Yardley, Walter
Roach, Boh Molnernv, Ed Major, and
Julian Ganz, just took it upon them
selves to enter the tournament.
No Petition Here
They did not have any support

from the University. They did not
have any petition up before Excom.
They had not played together, and
they did not have anyone to coach
them. They had nothing to gain in
making the trip to Los Angeles
except personal satisfaction. They
knew that thez-e would be no cheer
ing crowd to greet them when they
got back to the Farm.
In fact, the trip cost them in time
and money. And with finals coming
up that loss of time is a big loss.
Yet this team—without any oi the
advantages except the most impor
tant ones, the competitive spirit and
the love of the game —trounced a
veteran California team and rolled
over all opposition until they met
USC. Then they lost, but only after
two grueling sets of games.
Trounce the Bears
The teams opposing Stanford had
all practiced together before the
tournament. Indeed, at the Univer
sity of California volleyball is a
minor sport and the Bears get a
letter for their efforts.
But this intrepid band of Indians
tied the can to the Bear volleyball
ers, and everyone else but USC.
What Stanford team has been able
to hang one on the Trojans this
vear?
