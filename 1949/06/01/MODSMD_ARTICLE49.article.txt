# CIVIL WAR
## Papoose Netters To Battle Varsity 
### DICK KLEIN 
1 Facing their toughest and final
. test ot (he season, the undefeated
Papoose tennis squad goes into ac
j tion against the varsity this after
i noon. Tentative time is set at 3:30
■ on the varsity courts.
The frosh stand a good chance for
| victory in this special match, con
i sisting ot three singles and two
! doubles. Loaded with top-line tal
ent, but not too much depth, the
yearlings will have a break in the
small number ot clashes.
George Gentry, Ernie Dußray,
and Tommy Lewyn, all nationally
j ranked juniors this past year, will
| play the singles ior the lreshmen.
Their probable opponents shape up
to be Kirke Mechem, Bob Lewis,
and Errol i.ycette.
Double Trouble
i In the c oubles play Gentry teams
I with Leu \ n for one very fancy and
strong combination, and Dußray
and Dean Brinkman, both lefties,
| pair up to form another solid tan
j dem.
For the varsity, Lewis will play
with brother Fred, and Mechem
i with Bob Forbes.
Sporting an already impressive
number of wins, the Papooses have
j cut down some pretty tough squads.
IViodesto JC. sparked by top-flight
I junior college singles star Lorn
Main, fell to the lrosh early in the
season. Highly touted Ecrkeley
High School, rated as, one ot tho
a'l-time great high school teams,
also was cut down to size by the
clever ccurtwork of the freshmen.
Sweetest of All
The sweetest victories of all were
the two complete whitewashes of
the Cal Cubs. Never taking one set
from the Papooses, Cal barely man
aged to win a total of 50 games in
the two matches.
Besides the great trio ol Gentry,
Dußray, and Lewyn, the Papooses
1 can boast such good strokers as
Brinkman, Steve Blutnberg, Eric
Javits, Vaughn Manley, John Ger
lach, and Lou Frost.
Add to all this high-power talent
the ineligible efforts of first-year
Wa'ly Marks, and it's safe to predict
that the varsity will receive a shot
in the arm next season that should
go a long way.
Maybe with this new tennis tal
ent on the courts. Coach Bugge will
be able to field a squad that can
even trample "them Trojans."
