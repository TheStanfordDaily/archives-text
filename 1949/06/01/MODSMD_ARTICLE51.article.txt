## Grid Team Only as Good as Sophs; So Let's Not Go' Off Deep End Yet 
### JOHN BREIER 
As the school year draws to a close and with but two more issues ot
The Daily to come, let's take this time to look back over the sports scene
and take a brief glance into the crystal ball.
Let's look to the 1949 football season first. By the time most ol you
pick up a Daily next lall, the Cards will have played two football games-
San Jose State and Harvard. Next will come the great team of Michigan
and by that time we should have a pretty good idea as to Stanford's
strength and weaknesses.
There has been altogether too much Rose Bowl talk floating about. It
must be remembered that the 1949 team will be only as good as three oi
four sophomores make it. If fellows like Gary Kerkorian, Dick Horn
Harry Hugasian, Bill McColl, Eric Southwood, Chuck Hokanson, and
Jesse Cone come through, and if the injury list remains short, the Cards
should win more than they lose. But it is unfair to the team and theii
coach to talk of going all the way in one year.
It must also be remembered that the 1939 team —that was the year
that Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic. Freddie Meyers, and other of note
were sophomores—lost all their games until they played Dartmouth in
a post-season affair.
I personally think next year's team is going to be a little bit of all right
But experienced writers such as Dink Templeton have no business sayin.L
that Stanford's third string can beat Cal's first team now that Jensen ha
signed to play pro baseball. We just don't have the depth and experience
to be rated above average at this time.
Much will be said and written about Stanford between now and the
Sept. 17 opening game. Some of it will be true, but a lot of it will b<
guessing on the part of men who just don't know.
Looking Back
And now to mention a few of the men who have done their part t<
further sports at Stanford in the past year but have been somewhat over
looked on the sports pages.
Number one on anybody's list should be Chuck Taylor. Piloting the
frosh gridders to an unbeaten season was just a small part of the worl
done by this likeable guy. Chuck ran the mural program, no small tasl
in itself. teamed with Bob doling to get the high schoolers to comc t<
Stanford, and coached the rugby and wrestling teams.
There are many men who could make this list, but let's just run throiu:
the roster.
Jack McK it trick, who made the winning touchdown against San Jo;
and thus started the Cards out right. We won that one by luck and los
others by just the opposite kind of luck Bud Held, best in the na
tion in his event, NCAA javelin champ, and the kind of guy you take iu<
much tor granted Vic Conde, who could be a fine guard but for
shoulder injury. He has turned out for the past two years and tried i
again this spring, but the injury just won't let him stay out.
Ray Lunny, the amiable boxing coach who has less material to worl
with than most junior colleges. We of The Daily owe him an apology
about not knowing of, and thus not publicizing the All-University
tournament Gay Bryan, who has more publicity than any tw(
Stanfordites in the past 10 years and deserves every bit of it.
All the managers who have worked long and hard at their various sport
and still stay in school Bob Crozier, number one golfer, Ail-
University golf champ, who may not get his letter because of an injun
that kept him off the links for a better part of the season .... even so
he is but a half-point off the needed amount .... Ara Gaulstrum. a kit
who has made all-something-or-other in the last three years while play
ing soccer.
Then there was Vein Jones, one of the best collegiate wrestlers on tin
Coast, and the boxing team, which never gets to enter the nationals be
cause our finals come at that time Frances Lynn, the gal shoote
who led her he-male riflemen more times than not .... the whole rugln
team .... those guys give more entertainment to more people on lcs.
of the school's money than any other sport.
And for me there is the remembrance of hitch-hiking by air to Nev
York to see our boys get mauled by a vicious Army team. I missed sevei
days of school that time and went minus many many, but it was worth it
All in all, it has been a good year on the sports front. Stanford has no
yet regained its postwar standings but next season should be the turnin;
point. Two good frosh classes have moved up since we started the mov
to get on the road back. Let's cross our fingers and hope.
Harry Wo Iter Field?
There is a movement afoot to rename the Sunken Diamond. The sug
gestion is, of course, to change it to Harry Wolter Field. I think this i
a grand idea.
Harry Wolter's record isn't the best in collegiate circles. But then hi
material through the years has been decidedly second-rate. Baseball i
a forgotten sport at Stanford in comparison to football, basketball, anr
track. There arc no scholarships for a baseball player. The Card nim
falls into the "student body" class here.
Yet Harry's teams have compiled a close to .500 average in the 2.
years he has been coach. There is no way of knowing, but I'll bet thi
is pretty close to the average of college teams throughout the nation.
