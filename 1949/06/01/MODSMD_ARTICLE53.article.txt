# Indians Complete Successful Baseball Season As Wolter Bows Out After Twenty-six Years
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
This year's baseball season was
one of the most successful in Coach
Harry Wolter's 26 years at Stanford.
The Indians finished fourth in the
CIBA with seven wins against eight
losses and completed the season
with an overall 18 and 12 record.
Coach Wolter, who retired this
season, said that this was one of
the finest teams that he has ever
coached. It was a team that hus
tled from the first pitch to the last
out in every game.
With a few breaks here and
there along the line, this year's
squad could have had the pen
r'ant. Old man weather threw
die Indians a sharp breaking
curve before the season started
by raining out most of the early
season practice games.
Stanford copped the series from
her three northern neighbors, tak
ing two from both Cal and Santa
Clara and sweeping three from St.
Mary's. However, the Trojans and
Bruins from the Southland were
able to take all six games from, the
Indians.
Highlight of the season was the
come-through performance of the
infield. Captain Bill Arce, who
has held down third base for the
past seasons, was the only veteran
infi elder.
Dave Melton, who was used
mostly as a pinch hitter last season,
took over the shortstop duties and
turned in a performance that gained

bim the all-league nod over veter
ans Harvey Toso cf Santa Clara and
last year's all-leaeu'e shortstop, Jim
Brideweser of USC.
Ray Winterhalter came up from
last year's junior varsity to handle
the keystone sack. Ray did such a
fine job that Coach Wolter tagged
him "Superman."
When last year's first baseman,
Chuck Cole, was moved to the out
field, Dick Clegg took off his catch
ing gear and moved to the initial
sack.
Mellon, batting from the clean
up spot, was the Indians' biggest
threat at the plate, lie led the
team with a .3113 batting average,
32 runs batted in and 13 extra
base blows. He also accounted for
three of the Indians' six home
runs.
Replacement in the infield looks
like the big problem for Coach Ev
erett Dean, who succeeds Wolter
next season. Both Arce and Win
terhalter graduate this June.
Next , season's pitching staff should
be stronger than this year. Five
members of the present staff will
return. Frank La√ürum will gradu
ate at the end of the winter quar
ter. Fireballer Frank Hamilton,
Roger Osenbaugh, and Joe Chez
will be up from his year's frosh
squad.
The outfield next year should be
strong, with Bob Nava, top fielder
on the squad, the only graduating
senior.
