Bobby Rosburg, and Jack Schuler.
To Lose One
Only Ernie Kellberg, who alter
nated with Bob Crozier as top man
this year, will be lost to the team.
However, Ernie will be a tough man
to replace as he was the most con
sistent player this season.
Coming back for another year
will be Crozier, Bud Mce, Jack
Wallace, Cully Ingram, Dick Wel
don, and Ralph Mills. All these men
scored points in conference matches
this year.
Great things are also expected of
several men from the undefeated
freshman team. Dick McElyea was
on a par with any of the varsity
men this year, and he and Keith
Beekman are given excellent
chances of breaking into the top six.
Duffy Blabon and Bob Teitsworth
are also capable of varsity golf.
Opened in March
This year the golf season started

of? in March when Bob Crozier won
the Ail - University Golf Tourna
ment from Ernie Kellberg, 6 and 5.
The only dual match of winter
quarter found the Indians bowing to
the Los Altos Golf Club team, 17-
10.
This quarter the Indians com
peted in nine dual meets, winning
four of them. Santa Clara, the
Stanford Alumni, St. Mary's, and
California fell to the Cards, while
San Jose State edged Stanford
twice, and California, USC, and
UCLA eaeh defeated the Indians.
Second in NCI
The varsity also competed in the
Northern California Intercollegiates
at Pasatiempo where they placed
second, four points behind San Jose
State, as Bob Crozier won medalist
honors. In the Southern Division
championships at Los Angeles the
Indians finished in second place be
hind USC.
Only three men, Ernie Kellberg,
Bud Moe, and Ralph Mills, qualified
for Block l 'S" awards on the basis
of the point system. Each man must
score a total of six points in the
four conference matches to qualify.
Bob Crozier missed one match be
cause of an ankle injury, and fell
one - half point shy of his letter.
Coach Finger has recommended,
him for a block, however.
The Stanford golf team has fin
ished one of its worst regular
schedules in recent years, but de
spite the black results the Indians
give promise of being right back up
in the thick of things next year.
It is still indefinite whether the
team will be able to take the trip
to Ames, lowa, this year for the
NCAA championship, but definite
word should be received today 011
this subject. The tourney gets under
way on June 27.
The Indians were hard hit by
graduation last year when they lost
their three top men. Coach Bud
Finger, in his first year as golf
coach, found it very difficult to re
place such men as Tom Lambie,
Bobby Rosburg, and Jack Schuler.
