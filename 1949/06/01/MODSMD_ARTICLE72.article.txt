# Two-Bits Will Buy Old Boy's Europe
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Since we're not
going to Europe either, maybe
we'll have to break down and buy
a copy of this inag.y
If you're not among the thou
sands and thousands of plutocratic,
monopolistic, decadent capitalists
who are going abroad this summer,
then take hope and throw away
that dirty ol' party card. Da Chap
pie's made it possible to bring Eu
rope to you, in its big Summer
Abroad issue on sale today.
With lots of stories, cartoons, ads,
and even a cover, the Old Boy has
made it possible for you to see all
of the famous and fascinating facets
of the brilliant Continent for the
new low price of 25 cents, one
lourth of a dollar. Buy it, try it,
pick up yours at the four corners
of Quad, in front of either the Post
Oflice or the Cellar, or in the ash
can nearest your house.
