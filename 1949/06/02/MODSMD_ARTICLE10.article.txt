# 'Miss Pat' Named Stern Hall Head
## 
### 
Miss Patricia Davidson, known to thousands of Stanford coeds
as "Miss Pat," director of the Stanford Y.W.C.A., will "retire"
July I—but only to take up a new career, this time working
with young men.
For the attractive, genial woman who has been in Y.W.C.A.

♦work for 30 years, nine of them on
the Stanford campus, has been
named director of Stern Hall, new
residence hall for junior and senior
men which will open next October.
The story of Miss Pat's service to
i Stanford women can be told quite
j simply in the growth of the organ
ization since she has been at the
University. The YWCA membership
was 250 when she came here after
| 14 years of "Y" work in San Jose
, The membership is now more than.
: 800 and the organization's program
has played a key role in the devel
i oping of women leaders, it was
■ pointed out by Miss Elva Fay
Brown, Stanford chief counselor for
t women.
Miss Pat is 60, retirement age in
j the YWCA, and she is an exceptional
woman in that she admits her age.
Perhaps the reason for this unfemi
nine frankness is that she looks as if
she were in her forties.
Miss Pat will live in Stern Hall
after Sept. 1 when she will take
over her new duties. This will mean
giving up her long-time residence
with the family of the late Professor
j R. L. Green, 541 Salvatierra St., on
j the campus.
I Two hundred twenty-eight stu
| dents will move into Stern Hall upon
; its completion in September. They
will be housed approximately 60
each in the four two-story pavilions.
Inside the '*U" formed by these
pavilions will be a glass-walled in-
I ner court with a lounge and dining
room for each pavilion.
The kitchen, also planned for
! September completion, will open into
the four dining rooms. If it is not
finished by fall quarter. Stern resi
dehts will eat at Encina. The mod
ern dining halls may be used al
! ternately for cafeteria service or for
table service.
One resident assistant will live in
each building, and a suite will be
provided for the hall's one resident
director. Eight rooms will be one
man rooms. The rest, about 12x13
! feet each, will house two men.
Built-in wardrobes will supply
| the bedrooms, which will have lino-
I leum floors and California stucco
! walls. Four bathrooms will be in
j stalled for each unit. Halls will be
! floored with asphalt tile and roofed
! with acoustic tile.
The basements of two buildings
will hold laundry equipment. Stem
will be served by the Toyon tele
phone exchange.
The space between the pavilions
and the inner court will be tiled
and planted with full-grown oak
trees.
j Stern Hall was made possible by
a gift of $600,000 from the estate of
Mrs. Louis Stern of Palo Alto. It
| has been under construction sintv
i July of last year.

July I—but only to take up a new career, this time working
with young men.
For the attractive, genial woman who has been in Y.W.C.A.

♦work for 30 years, nine of them on
the Stanford campus, has been
named director of Stern Hall, new
residence hall for junior and senior
men which will open next October.
The story of Miss Pat's service to
i Stanford women can be told quite
j simply in the growth of the organ
ization since she has been at the
University. The YWCA membership
was 250 when she came here after
| 14 years of "Y" work in San Jose
, The membership is now more than.
: 800 and the organization's program
has played a key role in the devel
i oping of women leaders, it was
■ pointed out by Miss Elva Fay
Brown, Stanford chief counselor for
t women.
Miss Pat is 60, retirement age in
j the YWCA, and she is an exceptional
woman in that she admits her age.
Perhaps the reason for this unfemi
nine frankness is that she looks as if
she were in her forties.
Miss Pat will live in Stern Hall
after Sept. 1 when she will take
over her new duties. This will mean
giving up her long-time residence
with the family of the late Professor
j R. L. Green, 541 Salvatierra St., on
j the campus.
I Two hundred twenty-eight stu
| dents will move into Stern Hall upon
; its completion in September. They
will be housed approximately 60
each in the four two-story pavilions.
Inside the '*U" formed by these
pavilions will be a glass-walled in-
I ner court with a lounge and dining
room for each pavilion.
The kitchen, also planned for
! September completion, will open into
the four dining rooms. If it is not
finished by fall quarter. Stern resi
dehts will eat at Encina. The mod
ern dining halls may be used al
! ternately for cafeteria service or for
table service.
One resident assistant will live in
each building, and a suite will be
provided for the hall's one resident
director. Eight rooms will be one
man rooms. The rest, about 12x13
! feet each, will house two men.
Built-in wardrobes will supply
| the bedrooms, which will have lino-
I leum floors and California stucco
! walls. Four bathrooms will be in
j stalled for each unit. Halls will be
! floored with asphalt tile and roofed
! with acoustic tile.
The basements of two buildings
will hold laundry equipment. Stem
will be served by the Toyon tele
phone exchange.
The space between the pavilions
and the inner court will be tiled
and planted with full-grown oak
trees.
j Stern Hall was made possible by
a gift of $600,000 from the estate of
Mrs. Louis Stern of Palo Alto. It
| has been under construction sintv
i July of last year.
Miss Patricia Davidson, known to thousands of Stanford coeds
as "Miss Pat," director of the Stanford Y.W.C.A., will "retire"
