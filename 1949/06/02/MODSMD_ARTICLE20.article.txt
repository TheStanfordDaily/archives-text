# Veterans' Program For Allowances Expires July 25
## 
### 
Student veterans are reminded by
George Barahal, veterans co-ordi
nator, that the federal servicemen's
readjustment allowance program
(52-20 Club) expires July 25.
"Jobless pay under *he GI Bill
j ends July 25 for all veterans who
i were discharged prior to July 26,
1947. Men discharged after that
i date may be entitled to further
| benefits," Barahal said.
Congress specified in the Service
i men's Readjustment Act of 1944 that
I rights to unemployment pay would
expire two years after termination
of the war. President Truman pro
claimed July 25, 1947, as the official
i end of the war.
Any veteran who enlisted under
the Voluntary Recruitment Act or
who had service both before and
after July 25, 1947, and is in doxibt
as to his l ights may discuss his case
with the readjustment allowance
specialist at any office of the Cali
i fornia Department of Employment.
