# SIRO Opens Drive For Useful Books
## 
### 
SIRO is sending out a call for
used textbooks. These books are
needed by universities in the Phil
ippines.
SIRO will pay for the used texts,
but would appreciate it very much
if students would donate them. Es
pecially needed are Tarshis' "Ele
ments of Economics," Anderson's
"American Government," and the
Smart and Lang grammar for Eng
lish 2a and 2b. All books will be
very welcome.
Books should be turned in at the
lIR office as soon as possible.
