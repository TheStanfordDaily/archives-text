Professionalism in Pacific Coast Conference Athletics!
That phrase might be a damning headline sometime in the near
future if PCC schools do not straighten up and abide by their
own purity code.
Two universities—USC and Washington—and possibly a
third—Oregon—appear to be the prime violators of the code,
and their actions seem to have been spurred in part by restless
alumni anxious to see their schools in the championship bracket
of intercollegiate sports.
Professionalism is not the best word to use in the case of the
more flagrant code violations. Bribery and price bidding are
jbetter terms.
If Stanford, Cal, and UCLA refuse to lower their academic
standards for a promising track man, what can be done to prevent
USC or Washington from giving that man an athletic scholarship
and a lucrative "working program" job when he is not capable
of doing normal university work?
The existence of a PCC purity code today is sheer hypocrisy.
College representatives meet, draw up fair standards rules, and
then turn around and stab fellow members by bidding for top
high school athletes to "come to Podunk U."
In the case of USC, the university is a private institution with
a very small endowment. Since USC's endowment interest in
come is negligible, the school is dependent on athletic income to
support the academic side of their university. Scheduling often is
worked out with an eye on probable gate receipts, and the bene
iit of the sport itself is made secondary.
Indirectly, purity code violations undermine the academic
standards of a university when concessions are made to accept
exceptional athletes who may fall below academic entrance re
quirements. We can cite the example of a Compton JC football
star to illustrate our point.
The Compton man was the center of a sports controversy for
a number of weeks because he Could not decide whether to go
to USC or Washington. Compton is known in the Southland
as the "Trojan Farm." But Washington accepted the man, and
he is now enrolled in that university with the title, "the most
promising football player in the country."
Then there is the USC field track star whose home is in the
Bay Area. But he went to USC because, as his father put it, "You
can't turn down a good offer very well."
The purity code prohibits a member school from bringing a
potential student-athlete on a paid trip to the college to "look
fcver the grounds." But some schools go around this rule by
having the fraternities foot the bill.
We could tell about a well-known Cal football-baseball star
v/ho could not fulfill Stanford minimum requirements and thus
went to Cal.
How can we advocate fair sportsmanship on the field if PCC
members violate the basic principles of good sportsmanship by
drawing up rules to hinder the other members and to benefit
themselves. The conference code is turning into a big laugh—
on those who violate it the least. And the conference com
missioner cannot do anything about it unless he has conclu
sive evidence against the violators.
If the PCC members want to uphold the purity code, they had
better reform. And they had better change their ways before
;he violations reach some well-known columnist or commentator
outside of our own conference region. Criticism can be embar
rassing when people outside our family cut loose.
