Tennis as Major Sports
To the Editor:
In His discussion concerning the crew situation at Stanford (May 24)
John Hall made the unsupported statement that Tennis does not deserve
major sport status. I hereby cordially invite him to review, in detail, the
record of Stanford tennis teams down through the years since 1921, or
thereabouts, when the sport attained its majority.
Does he realize that our tennis team competes in the strongest confer
once in the U.S. and that two teams in this conference presently rate
among the top three college teams in the nation? Has lie noted that one
oi our non-conference opponents, unofficially at least, fields the strongest
college team in the country? Has he considered the results of recent
meets with these teams? Does he understand that the major sport stand
jng of Stanford tennis, plus the fine physical set-up here, has attracted
to this institution many outstanding players who have been a distinct
credit to Stanford both as students and alumni?
