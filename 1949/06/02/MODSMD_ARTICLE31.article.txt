MUSIC TO MY EARS by Deems
Taylor (Simon & Sehusler)
To understand this book, one does
not have to be an authority on
music; yet anyone entertaining am
bition of becoming a composer
should read it carefully. For this
is a book, not about music, but
about the men who write it, and it is
written, of course, by a man who is
a composer.
Taylor first describes the actual
process of composition. He cites one
example where a young composer
had written a symphonic poem
which would obviously appeal to
audiences. However, when he ex
amined the score, Taylor found that
the composition called for eight
horns and a bass flute.
No orchestra has eight horns, and
a bass flute is almost a curiosity.
Thus, an ignorance of practical de
tail, virtually ruined the composi
tion. This is only one example in
Deems Taylor's presentation of the
tremendous difficulties in composi
tion.
He has further included interest
ing material on many talented, but
little known composers, such as
Lawrence Gilman, Frederick Stock,
and John Knowles Paine.
Taylor has illustrated, from his
own experiences, the overwhelming
difficulties facing an American com
poser of opera. As the situation ex
ists, unless an opera is produced by
the Metropolitan, it is not produced.
Further, there is the serious financial
hazard involved.
Also, in this music miscellany,
based on Taylor's radio talks, he has
included much astute criticism of
Modem Music. Thus, anyone can
learn a gieat deal about music by
reading "Music To My Ears."
