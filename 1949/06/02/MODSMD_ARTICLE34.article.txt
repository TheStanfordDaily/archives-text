University of Kansas students
were surprised to learn recently
that they were the beneficiaries of
a few architectural hand-me-downs.
The architect for the university's
Fraser Hall was also the architect
for the state insane asylum at Osa
watomie. He designed an entrance
for the asylum but it couldn't be
used because of a mistake made by
the stone cutters. So Fraser Hall's
wooden steps were replaced by a
stuck-on eastern portico.
And a strange feathered carving—
a hybrid gargoyle—which sits atop
the University Museum'of Natural
History was the work of two stu
dents in 1901. When the commis

sioned carvers became tired, they
handed their tools to the interested
bystanders to "try their hands at
carving."
