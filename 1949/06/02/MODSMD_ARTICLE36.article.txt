# Colliers Told About Honor Code
## 
### 
Some time ago Collier's Magazine l>egan planning an
article on honor systems in American universities. The
magazine enlisted the aid of the National Student As
sociation, which prepared a questionnaire to obtain
complete information on the workings of various col
lege honor systems.
Hawley Smith, former Honor Code Standing Com
mittee chairman at Stanford, answered the NSA ques
tionnaire for the University. Smith's background with
the Honor Code Committee qualifies him as an au
thority on the workings of the Code; his opinions are
objective as well as comprehensive, providing a valid
study of just how the Code Ls functioning at Stanford.
The following is a summary of the NSA questions
and Smith's answers:
1. Has the amount of cheating in your school in
creased since the war? "Technically the 'amount' of
cheating'. . . probably has increased since tho war,
but at the same time I doubt if the proportion of
cheaters is any greater. . . . We have about twice as
many people at college . . . and scholastic standards
are higher than before the war. However ... I per
sonally doubt if the percentage of cheating has varied
markedly."
2. If so. do you think this can he attributed to the
veterans' influence? "... I do not think that vet
erans as such make the problem worse."
3. Do you think that college students today feel that
they are doing anything dishonorable when they cheat?
Is cheating more or less looked upon as a justifiable
means to obtaining a degree? "At Stanford we feci
very strongly that anyone who cheats is doing some
thing dishonorable . . . and it is not a justifiable means
for getting a grade in a single course ... to say
nothing of a degree. The students feel that allowing
cheating hurts honest peoples' chances for fair grades."
4. Have you found that men cheat more than women
or \ice versa? ". . . It does not appear to me that
men cheat more than women."
5. How has mechanized grading and the objective
type examination affected cheating? "The objective
type test does make it easier to copy an answer here
and there. I doubt if short answer or objective type
tests do much in the way of encouraging premeditated
cheating."
(>. Who cheats and why?
(a) Does the income of the student or his family
affect his willingness to cheat? "No. Frequently people
less well off .set higher standards for themselves be
cause they know that their future success depends on
good training and hard work, as opposed to finding an
easy out to education."
(b) Do inferior students cheat more than bright
students' "Recently I would say that we have had
more cases of superior students cheating than those

j about to fail: superior students who have set extremely
j high standards for themselvesâ€”perhaps too high to
I reach honestly when the pressure gets intense."
(c) l)o you think cheating is often a result of fam
ily difficulties? "Family difficulties would tend to make
the individual less stable. Some might cheat, others
would express the tensions differently. 1 would not
} say that cheating is often a result of family difficulties."
(d) Arc students who cheat usually psychologically
upset? "I do not think it can be fairly said that the
students who cheat are usually psychologically upset.
It probably could be said that the student who cheats
is in need of adjustment to meet our particular stan
: dards."
7. Do you think there is too much emphasis on grades
and the examination system? "In some cases, yes.
Especially where there is a sliding curve that means
the better the work of the class the higher the re
quirements for even passing."
8. What do you think of honor systems on the whole?
Do you feel that your honor system succeeds in its
purpose? "I think honor systems are the logical an
' swer to mature education. Our honor code works well
| primarily because we want very much for it to work
well, and are perfectly willing to take the responsi
| bility to make it work."
!). Do you feel that the cheating problem is as much
the fault of faculty and administration negligence as
the dishonest attitude of students? Do professors re
fuse to report cheating offenses because of fear of
student opinion, or fear of what severe disciplinary
action may he taken against the offender? "In the
i first place I do not think that we have ;i cheating
; problem at Stanford. Six or eight cases of cheating
per year with a student body of 8,000 is as near to
perfect as any largely voluntary system could be
expected to be. Our profesors do not hesitate to turn
| in suspected cheating."
10. Broadly, what do you think is the mean reason
for the increased problem? ". . . our main problem is
having more students to orient and to keep re
j minded of the honor code. University education is our
highest level of education and should be treated ;.s
just that. A mature approach breeds a mature reaction,
and suspicion by administrators and faculty with the
: same approach as high school breeds a sportiness in
cheating and getting away with something."
11. What do you think the best method is to renicd\
the cheating problem? "A mature, progressive attitude
on the part of all the people associated with univer
sity education. There must be the desire for mature
experience in both personal standards and in tin
taking of responsibility. The average student knows
what is right and wrong, and with help now and then
| student government can take care of its own prob
i loins effectively."
