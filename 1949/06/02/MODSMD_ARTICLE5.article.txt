### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Tho Stanford crew realized a
three-year dream yesterday after
noon when it was announced that
the Indian strokers have been in
vited to compete in the Pough
keepsie Regatta on June 23.
The Stanford invitation was con
firmed by a wire from Asa Bush
nell, secretary of the Poughkeepsie
Regatta Committee, and publicly
announced by crew Coach Ace
Clark.
Commander Clurk revealed that
11 members cf the varsity crew,
including Con .wain and Captain
Johnny Dee, eight first-string oars
pen, and two alternates, will make
ho Eastern journey.
It has been estimated that the trip

] will cost approximately $3,000: and
, as crew is not officially recognized
j by the University, the oarsmen have
asked permission from Excom to
conduct a campus drive for the
raising of the necessary funds.
The 1949 crew will be the school's
first representative at Poughkeepsie
in 34 years. The last time the Cards
i competed in this rowing World Se
j l ies was in 1913, when a coxswain's
mistake cost the Farm strokers a
sure victory.
Stanford finished second in that
one when the coxswain halted his
j shell at what he thought to be the
: finish line, but what turned out to
be quite h few feet shy of the actual
| finish.
Coach Clark is very definitely
, optimistic concerning his men's

j chances at the Hudson River spec- j
' tacle. He emphasizes the fact that !
California and Washington have j
' consistently been the powers in the j
! Poughkeepsie event, having won 19
j of the p; st 25 races, and that Stan
ford lost to the Olympic champion
Bears by but nine seconds in last
1 month's three-mile race.
; A further note of cheer for the
j Indian water-boys was set forth by i
I Cal Coach Ky Ebright following last
I week's Stanford victory over Ore- !
gen State at Stockton. Ebright re
! marked that the Farm crew is defi
i nitely of the caliber to place in
the top three at Poughkeepsie.
In any event, the crewmen have
won their first, and major, battle.
' They're going to Poughkeepsie.
