## Farm Prospects Rise for Fifty 
### 
It has not been a good year for
the tennis squad. The Stanford net
team has a fair record in its 1949
season, but given the breaks the
record would have been much pret
tier to hear.
The Indians started very slow.
The weather was foul during the
first part of the season, and the
Card players did not start rounding
into shape until the season was half
over.
In the first engagements with the
toughies of the tennis world, USF,
UCLA, and USC. the Indians were
beaten by humiliating scores. It
was a different situation in the
latter part of the season.
Kirke Mechem recovered from a
sore arm, and Bob Lewis got the
basketba'l kinks ironed out. Then,
later in the season, Stanford scared
the daylights out of both USC and
USF before dropping close matches.
The Indians climaxed the season
by mopping up the California Bears
to make it two for two over the
Berkeley racquetmen. The Indians
also bounced Santa Clara. San Fran
cisco State, and Pepperdine.
Next j ear the Indians should be
an improved team. The loss of Bob
and Tied Lewis and Bob Forbes
will hurt, but the rest of the In
dian regulars will be bock. In ad
dition, the unbeaten frosh team will
send several members up to the
varsity who will give the veterans
quite a scrap for the varsity posts.
Returning veterans will be Kirke
Mechem, Errol Lycette, Lucen Bar
bour. Vince Schmieder, and Phil
Nielson. Add to that list the frosh
trio of George Gentry. Ernie Du-
Bray. and Tom Lewyn, and the
Cards will have a top tennis team
next year.
