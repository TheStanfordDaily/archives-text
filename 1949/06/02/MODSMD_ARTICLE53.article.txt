# Card Baseball Brothers Will Return Next Year
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's baseball brothers, John and Jim Claypool, will both
be cack to add their services to next year's varsity squad under
Stanford's new head coach, Everett Dean. Both boys got their
baseball start playing for their hometown high school in San
Bernardino, and since have added plenty of spark to the Stan
!

ford nine.
John, the older of the two, saw a i
year's service in the Marines before |
legistering at San Bernardino Jun- j
ior College. Last year he transferred |
to Stanford as a sophomore.
John's lanky six-foot three-inch
frame has earned him the nickname '
of "Boards" among his fellow ball j
players. He played in the outfield J
this season, filling in at light field
most of the time.
In eight times at bat he collected
four base hits for a CIBA batting
average of .500 while driving in j
three runs. His left-handed power :
was strongest against right-handed [
chuckers. In three appearances at \
the plate against right-handed fire- J
bailer Jackie Jensen, John slammed
out a pair of base hits.
Jim Claypool came to the varsity
this season after winning seven
games for last year's frosh, while
losing only two. He broke even this
season with a two and two record. '
One hundred ninety pounds on his i
six - foot four - inch frame packs
plenty of power.
Jim struck out 37 batters in the
44 1 3 innings that ho worked this
season. His blazing fast ball and
good hook keep the opposition wor
ried all the time. He is no slouch
when his turn at the plate comes, I
batting a very respectable .273 this ;
season.
Both John and Jim are majoring
in engineering. John is a member
of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and
Jim belongs to Sigma Nu.
They are both enthusiastic hunters
and fishermen. Just mention a spot
where a good rainbow trout or four
point buck hangs out. and the Clay
pools will be in the middle of the
conversation before you can bat an |
eye.
