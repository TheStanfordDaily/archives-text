## On The Bench

All right, I apologize.
Unless I have been greatly misinformed, the Northern schools did
nothing to tip the scales in the PCC; our injury list did not get better;
lightning did not strike Mel Patton, and Stanford did not win the PCC.
"And there is no joy in Mudville . . . ." •
But Bill Bayless did not beat either Chandler or Davis in the shot put.
And somebody, namely us, beat the blazes out of the thin clad fellows
from nearby California and that Southern WPA project. UCLA.
'For Auld Lung Syne . .
This week I got oft my unobjective position on the bench, picked out
a lew splinters, and looked back over the past athletic year. In comparison
with the 1947 season, one thing was obvious. This year we did beat some
body.
We beat UCLA in football, basketball (only one for four), and in irack.
We beat California in football (morally, of course), basketball (four Lor
four), swimming, tennis, baseball (two for three), and track (wheel).
Looking toward the future, I would like to give out with the opinion
that there is a good chance that we will beat them again sometime.
Now to the problem of the University of Southern California. This year
Stanford did not beat USC in any major sport. We came a lot closer in loot
ball and in track than did most schools, but to we who are pretty darn tired
ol losing to Troy, this is little or no consolation. But what I'm trying to
put over is that now is not the time to weakly sigh and say, "They're
too good for us."
If Stanford is going to compete in athletics they must go into the propo
sition with the idea that there isn't anybody that is too good for us.
Stanford is going to start beating USC, in spite of scholarships, or high
salaries, automobiles, passionate movie stars, or whatever else the trolley
trackers deem necessary for the happiness of their very excellent athletes.
We are going to beat USC in football, in basketball, in track, and in
baseball. And when I start thinking that such a thing is impossible I
will transfer my athletic allegiance to Kiperashi Tech.
T-T-Tro —J-J-Jun —Trojan!
USC has had a very successful year in the sports world—they were
third (by a total of seven points) in PCC football, second (by and oh-so
s!im margin) in basketball, a blazing first in swimming, and last week
Tommy Trojan captured the PCC baseball and track crowns.
SC this year was good. Prospects for next year look better for them.
Their football team, capitalizing on the 14-14 Notre Dame game last
year, is already billing itself as "the guys that turned the shamrock gray."
Basketballers Sharman and Christie will lead Sam Barry's well-loaded
ranks come next winter. Their horsehide and cinder teams will both be
defending champions—as they were this year. Oh, it's happy, happy,
happy for El Trojan.
For Stanford? The football team is jammed full of promising but in
experienced sophomores. The basketball team has lost Stephenson. Dav
idson, and Lewis. The track team is scheduled to graduate one Gaylord
Bryan. The baseball team is losing Captain Bill Arce. Busting Bob Nava,
second sacker Winterhalter, and pitcher Laßrum.
Now the Question: "Gad. what will USC do to us next year?" The
Answer: "We'll beat USC next year in football, basketball, track, baseball,
<>nd swimming. Also lightning will strike Mel Patton."
Thus I finish o!r this first series of Thursday columns with the self
same, unflavored. unmitigated, completely biased optimism that 'ias
characterized it all quarter. I have said that we were 40ing to be champions.
Well, the scoreboard doesn't record it that way. so I will get off of the
tear-stained bench and Walk quietly out of the empty Stadium mur
muring over and over again the classic refrain. "Next year, next year,
next year, next vear ....''

ball and in track than did most schools, but to we who are pretty darn tired
ol losing to Troy, this is little or no consolation. But what I'm trying to
put over is that now is not the time to weakly sigh and say, "They're
too good for us."
If Stanford is going to compete in athletics they must go into the propo
sition with the idea that there isn't anybody that is too good for us.
Stanford is going to start beating USC, in spite of scholarships, or high
salaries, automobiles, passionate movie stars, or whatever else the trolley
trackers deem necessary for the happiness of their very excellent athletes.
We are going to beat USC in football, in basketball, in track, and in
baseball. And when I start thinking that such a thing is impossible I
will transfer my athletic allegiance to Kiperashi Tech.
T-T-Tro —J-J-Jun —Trojan!
USC has had a very successful year in the sports world—they were
third (by a total of seven points) in PCC football, second (by and oh-so
s!im margin) in basketball, a blazing first in swimming, and last week
Tommy Trojan captured the PCC baseball and track crowns.
SC this year was good. Prospects for next year look better for them.
Their football team, capitalizing on the 14-14 Notre Dame game last
year, is already billing itself as "the guys that turned the shamrock gray."
Basketballers Sharman and Christie will lead Sam Barry's well-loaded
ranks come next winter. Their horsehide and cinder teams will both be
defending champions—as they were this year. Oh, it's happy, happy,
happy for El Trojan.
For Stanford? The football team is jammed full of promising but in
experienced sophomores. The basketball team has lost Stephenson. Dav
idson, and Lewis. The track team is scheduled to graduate one Gaylord
Bryan. The baseball team is losing Captain Bill Arce. Busting Bob Nava,
second sacker Winterhalter, and pitcher Laßrum.
Now the Question: "Gad. what will USC do to us next year?" The
Answer: "We'll beat USC next year in football, basketball, track, baseball,
<>nd swimming. Also lightning will strike Mel Patton."
Thus I finish o!r this first series of Thursday columns with the self
same, unflavored. unmitigated, completely biased optimism that 'ias
characterized it all quarter. I have said that we were 40ing to be champions.
Well, the scoreboard doesn't record it that way. so I will get off of the
tear-stained bench and Walk quietly out of the empty Stadium mur
muring over and over again the classic refrain. "Next year, next year,
next year, next vear ....''
• i
All right, I apologize.
Unless I have been greatly misinformed, the Northern schools did
nothing to tip the scales in the PCC; our injury list did not get better;
lightning did not strike Mel Patton, and Stanford did not win the PCC.
"And there is no joy in Mudville . . . ." •
But Bill Bayless did not beat either Chandler or Davis in the shot put.
And somebody, namely us, beat the blazes out of the thin clad fellows
from nearby California and that Southern WPA project. UCLA.
'For Auld Lung Syne . .
This week I got oft my unobjective position on the bench, picked out
a lew splinters, and looked back over the past athletic year. In comparison
with the 1947 season, one thing was obvious. This year we did beat some
body.
We beat UCLA in football, basketball (only one for four), and in irack.
We beat California in football (morally, of course), basketball (four Lor
four), swimming, tennis, baseball (two for three), and track (wheel).
Looking toward the future, I would like to give out with the opinion
that there is a good chance that we will beat them again sometime.
Now to the problem of the University of Southern California. This year
Stanford did not beat USC in any major sport. We came a lot closer in loot
ball and in track than did most schools, but to we who are pretty darn tired
ol losing to Troy, this is little or no consolation. But what I'm trying to
