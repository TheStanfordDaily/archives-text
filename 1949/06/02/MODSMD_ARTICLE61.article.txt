Accessories make the outfit,
they say. Certainly one of th«i
most important accessories is
your purse because oi' its con
stant use and constant presence.
Most <►£ us follow our will as to
size and shape and the current
vogue as to style. This year's
summer fashions have taken two
trends, one to the perennial
white, and the other to natural
straw.
The Clothes Closet has many
bags for you to choose from:
there are light straw ones in a
fine weave; there are darker
straw ones in a pointed weave;
there are white leather and white
cloth ones. Some are round and
some are square, some draw shut
and some snap shut. Every size
you want is there.
Looking for smoothing new?
There are duck cloth bags with
wooden handles that slip out so
that the bag ran easily be
washed. These come in white
and bright summer colors. Very
nice for school or wi)rk are the
tooled, natural leather ba/js. For
"veninar we suggest a simple gold
kid purse.
And while you're at the
Clothes Closet, complete your
outfit with hat, gloves, scarf,
handkerchief, pearls. Accessories
make very nice graduation gifts.
You really ought to come see
them today. We're at 520 Ramona
just off University.
