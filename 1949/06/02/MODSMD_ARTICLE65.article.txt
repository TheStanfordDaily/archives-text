## 
### 
New steps will be built near the
Geology corner of the Quad as soon
as metal treads are received from
the factory, S. F. Post, of the Stan
ford business office, reported yes
terday.
"We approved the work and al
lotted the money a few months
ago," Post said, "but we have had
to hold back until we receive steel
treads for the new steps."
The steps have been worn down
in past years until they now con
stitute a hazard to peaestrians.
