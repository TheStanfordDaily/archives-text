# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Take It Away, Bill 
### 
Another volume has ended, Bill, and now it is my turn to
thiow in the traditional farewell edit. You and Jim have two
oi the biggest jobs on campus cut out for you next year, but
you will have an excellent staff to back you up.
But what is equally important with a good staff is the fact that
we now have an increasing number of administration officials
who understand students and who believe that one of the most
important channels to reach the student body is through the
daily newspaper. Thus, your responsibility for accuracy, re
liability, and good taste is a necessity if you wish to uphold the
faith of your readers.
The most important department for reader interest, of course,
is the one containing all of the news stories. Always remember
that your fwirst duty to The Daily is to print all of the news fit
to be printed. You will find in Jim a man fully capable of handling
such a task—which will be fine support for you just as Bruce's
v/ork was for me.
Your big job, Bill, will be directing editorial policy. That is a
nebulous term; I've been caught too many times trying to define
it. You might say that editorial policy consists of editorials writ
ten from a constructive, factual angle designed to lead and or
develop public opinion.
Editorials will be the measure of your volume, Bill, because
the force and honesty of your writing are the criteria that readers
involuntarily fall back on to judge a college paper.
Watch NSA next year. The organization must prove itself if
they want to keep their ASSU membership. And The Daily is
the major medium for informing the students on NSA progress.
Watch Men's and Women's Councils closely. Along with the
Honor Code Committee the two councils are the students' princi
pal guardian of the Honor Code.
Keep an eye on University development and planning. That
is big news and usually merits student comment. We students
and the alumni, for instance, were caught unprepared when the
flat roof building construction was permitted to go ahead.
Next year the ASSU will put the new representation system
to a test. The Daily favored it, but observe its operation to make
sure that it is the most efficient system we can have.
You are going to have a ticklish problem with the Row open
houses. Too many of these parties have been poorly conducted
as far as discipline is concerned, but so far the students have
tried to solve that problem themselves.
I have not mentioned your biggest project of the volume yet
—football. The school gradually is resuming its prewar interest
in intercollegiate sports, and only The Daily and Rally Com
can sour pre-game interest. You probably realize that the school
spirit developed through participation in and attendance at
intercollegiate sports is the unifying force within any college
student body.
To both of you fellows—Bill and Jim —and to the staff of the
coming Volume 116, we graduating staff members wish you the
best of luck and enjoyment in your work.

the major medium for informing the students on NSA progress.
Watch Men's and Women's Councils closely. Along with the
Honor Code Committee the two councils are the students' princi
pal guardian of the Honor Code.
Keep an eye on University development and planning. That
is big news and usually merits student comment. We students
and the alumni, for instance, were caught unprepared when the
flat roof building construction was permitted to go ahead.
Next year the ASSU will put the new representation system
to a test. The Daily favored it, but observe its operation to make
sure that it is the most efficient system we can have.
You are going to have a ticklish problem with the Row open
houses. Too many of these parties have been poorly conducted
as far as discipline is concerned, but so far the students have
tried to solve that problem themselves.
I have not mentioned your biggest project of the volume yet
—football. The school gradually is resuming its prewar interest
in intercollegiate sports, and only The Daily and Rally Com
can sour pre-game interest. You probably realize that the school
spirit developed through participation in and attendance at
intercollegiate sports is the unifying force within any college
student body.
To both of you fellows—Bill and Jim —and to the staff of the
coming Volume 116, we graduating staff members wish you the
best of luck and enjoyment in your work.

Another volume has ended, Bill, and now it is my turn to
thiow in the traditional farewell edit. You and Jim have two
oi the biggest jobs on campus cut out for you next year, but
you will have an excellent staff to back you up.
But what is equally important with a good staff is the fact that
we now have an increasing number of administration officials
who understand students and who believe that one of the most
important channels to reach the student body is through the
daily newspaper. Thus, your responsibility for accuracy, re
liability, and good taste is a necessity if you wish to uphold the
faith of your readers.
The most important department for reader interest, of course,
is the one containing all of the news stories. Always remember
that your fwirst duty to The Daily is to print all of the news fit
to be printed. You will find in Jim a man fully capable of handling
such a task—which will be fine support for you just as Bruce's
v/ork was for me.
Your big job, Bill, will be directing editorial policy. That is a
nebulous term; I've been caught too many times trying to define
it. You might say that editorial policy consists of editorials writ
ten from a constructive, factual angle designed to lead and or
develop public opinion.
Editorials will be the measure of your volume, Bill, because
the force and honesty of your writing are the criteria that readers
involuntarily fall back on to judge a college paper.
Watch NSA next year. The organization must prove itself if
they want to keep their ASSU membership. And The Daily is
the major medium for informing the students on NSA progress.
