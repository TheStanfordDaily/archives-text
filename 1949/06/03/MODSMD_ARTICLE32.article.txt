### PAUL C. JOHNSTON, Chaplain 
Since this is the final number of
The Daily* for the current school
year, I take this opportunity to wish
all students and faculty a happy and
fruitful summer.
Mr. Minto and I desire to thank
all who have helped us in the
Church and Religious Activities
program; and to say that we believe
that the seeds of strength in both,
now planted, will increasingly
flower into character and disciplined
life on this campus.
Many of you will not be returning
to Stanford, save as alumni or for
mer students. For you we particu
larly hope that your days here have
served to funish a working philoso
phy for life, as well as tools with
which to make a living. The former,
I think you will agree, is alone ade
quate. And if the Church has con
tributed its share toward thus es
sential matter, we will be encour
aged.
In his recent "Crisis in Educa
tion." Dr. Bernard Iddings Bell has
a chapter in which he' calls to ac
count the present assumptions in

education. His argument is that
whereas the older universities and
colleges deemed it their major func
tion to share with their young people
a basic moral philosophy, more mod
ern institutions of education have
not confessed this responsibility.
Grown gargantuan in size, de
partmentalized in interests, and ex
isting under the "tyranny of spe
cialization," they render it now
widely possible for a student to be
come intensely trained in one spe
cific field but to emerge from col
lege without general interests and
lacking any unifying theory of pur
pose and meaning.
Such a person has atrophied, or at
least not developed, the many at
tributes of his nature. He is by that
much provincial; and while he may
be extremely well "educated" in his
Specialty, he may be an absurd ig
noramus beyond it. Moreover, his
confusion may be prophesied. For
when life with its prabtical strains,
duties and crises begins to make its
imperative demands, he will be at
despairing loss to deal both with
himself and others.
