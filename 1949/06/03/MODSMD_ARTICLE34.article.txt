TIIE ANCIENT MAYA, by Sylvanus
Morley (Stanford University
Press
I have chosen to review a book
which was published almost three
years ago. Yet, I believe it to be
one of the finest books Stanford Uni
versity Press has published.
Dr. Morley, an associate of the
Carnegie Institute, has spent 40
years in the exploration of Mayan
ruins in Mexico and Guatemala. As
a result, his book, ''The Ancient
Maya," is undoubtedly the most
comprehensive work written on that
ancient civilization.
This is a record of the fabulous
Mayas whose material progress
never transcended the Stone Age.
And yet, these' people, who never
developed the keystone of material
progress, the wheel, developed the
great theoretical concept of the zero.
Some of their most magnificent
stone edifices, adorned with sculp
ture showing a high cultural ad
vancement, were designed for the
barbaric practice of human sacrifice.
What marvelous accomplishments
in literature or in other written rec
ords these Central American Indians
may have had, is impossible to esti
mate. For the Spanish Conquista
dores, in the name of God, syste
matically destroyed every book,
every idol of the Mayas that they
could lay their hands on. Only the
contemporary accounts, including
the personal letters of Cortez, give
some clue to the full Mayan story-
Anthropologists of today can find
only those vestiges which were hid
den, overlooked, or simply too large
to effectively destroy.
Gtily after the Franciscan Friars
taught the Indians how to write was
some attempt made to reconstruct
the history of the Mayas. From this
time on, the Yucatan story has fas
cinated anthropologists. Large
United States foundations, like th?
Carnegie Institute, have financed
countless expeditions into Central
America. And the culmination ol
this search, to date, for it is still
continuing, is Dr. Morley's book.
Besides being a readable, compre
hensive, fascinating account, the
book is also a bibliophile's delight.
The profuse illustrations, the pagina
tion in Mayan numerals, and the
many photographs; in fact, the total
make-up of the book is both rare
and beautiful.
It is not an ephemeral work. It
is the valuable archeological and
anthropological record written for
the scientist and layman alike. For
this reason I have submitted this
review, long after the publication of
"The Ancient Maya." It is truly a
bibliographic treasure.

ruins in Mexico and Guatemala. As
a result, his book, ''The Ancient
Maya," is undoubtedly the most
comprehensive work written on that
ancient civilization.
This is a record of the fabulous
Mayas whose material progress
never transcended the Stone Age.
And yet, these' people, who never
developed the keystone of material
progress, the wheel, developed the
great theoretical concept of the zero.
Some of their most magnificent
stone edifices, adorned with sculp
ture showing a high cultural ad
vancement, were designed for the
barbaric practice of human sacrifice.
What marvelous accomplishments
in literature or in other written rec
ords these Central American Indians
may have had, is impossible to esti
mate. For the Spanish Conquista
dores, in the name of God, syste
matically destroyed every book,
every idol of the Mayas that they
could lay their hands on. Only the
contemporary accounts, including
the personal letters of Cortez, give
some clue to the full Mayan story-
Anthropologists of today can find
only those vestiges which were hid
den, overlooked, or simply too large
to effectively destroy.
Gtily after the Franciscan Friars
taught the Indians how to write was
some attempt made to reconstruct
the history of the Mayas. From this
time on, the Yucatan story has fas
cinated anthropologists. Large
United States foundations, like th?
Carnegie Institute, have financed
countless expeditions into Central
America. And the culmination ol
this search, to date, for it is still
continuing, is Dr. Morley's book.
Besides being a readable, compre
hensive, fascinating account, the
book is also a bibliophile's delight.
The profuse illustrations, the pagina
tion in Mayan numerals, and the
many photographs; in fact, the total
make-up of the book is both rare
and beautiful.
It is not an ephemeral work. It
is the valuable archeological and
anthropological record written for
the scientist and layman alike. For
this reason I have submitted this
review, long after the publication of
"The Ancient Maya." It is truly a
bibliographic treasure.
