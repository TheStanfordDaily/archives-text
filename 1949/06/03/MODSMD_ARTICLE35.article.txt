# Grants-in-Aid Given to Twelve
## 
### 
Stanford's newly created Student
Aid Commission has approved 12
grants for fall quarter and will
finish consideration on many more
during the next few days.
Students may still apply for
grants in the scholarship secretary's
office, Temporary Building B. any
time next week.
Professor William Bark, commis
sion head, said that in some cases
amounts of grants were decreased
from the original application. Stu
dents receiving such grants may re
apply for additional funds if they
are needed, he said.
