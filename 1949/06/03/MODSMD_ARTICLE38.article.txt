## Communist "Army" 
### 
To the Editor:
Some recent letters to The Daily have condemned such events as the
dismissal of certain college professors for membership in the Communist
Party and also the trial of Communist leaders in New York. They have
noted that the Communist Party has legal status in the United States,
and also that everyone has the right to "hold opinions even though they
are contrary to those of the majority."
In this country we are accustomed to such political organizations as
the Democratic and the Republican parties, whose chief aims are to elect
their nominees to public office in order to have their policies enacted into
law. Tc do this they must sway opinion and win votes. But* the Com
munist Pfity is not that kind of an organization, although it often mas
querades as such.
It should be better known that the Communist Party is a highly dis
ciplined organization with a well-planned hierarchy, governed abso
lutely from the top like an army. Its major purpose is to gain control
of one country after another by any means that offer good prospects ot
success, whether legal or otherwise.
If a college student joins the football team, it is not sufficient for him
to manifest an interest in football and attend Uie games. As a member of
the team he must obey the coach and captain, and he must work hard and
devotedly for victory by the team. If he does not do so, he will assuredly
be deemed unfit to be a member of the squad. Although the 'cases are
not entirely parallel, the Communist Party member is in somewhat the
same position; if he does not work assiduously for the Party program and
obey orders, he is sure to be expelled and perhaps punished in addition.
Therefore, actual membership in the Communist Party, as distinguished
from mere sympathy with Communist ideology, may be taken as prima
facie evidence that the person is an obedient and energetic worker for
the Communist hierarchy; and as such he is unfit for a position on any
university faculty. He would also be untrustworthy as a member of a
governmental or other kind of public institution. Not to see this clearly
is to misunderstand the whole situation.
