# Let's Quit Kidding Ourselves

To the Editor:
I have been very interested in the reaction to your very stimulating
editorial, "Academic Freedom." However, your editorial is trying to adopt
a fence-straddling policy that many Americans are trying to follow and
can't.
It is about time that we woke up to the fact, as distasteful as it may
be, that Communism is not just another political philosophy to be dis
cussed and dabbled in at leisure. Communism is a religionâ€”a fanatical
religion which is intolerant of our institutions of freedom and which
seeks to destroy them by any means it can. For the sake of our own free
dom we can not be tolerant of this intolerance.
Americans must have the courage to admit that the day is probably
coming "when he who is not with us is against us." This fact is not
popular with many Stanford breast-beaters, but tough-mindedness is es
sential to our survival. The Communists certainly have this quality, and
we can not afford to be any less realistic.
