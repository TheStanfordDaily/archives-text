# Incident Closed

### 
To the Editor:
Some weeks ago a letter was written to The Daily concerning an act
of discrimination against a Negro at the "Hilo Club" on El Camino Real.
The facts of the case were brought to the attention of the NAACP chap
ter here at Stanford, and I think the addition of the following story is
necessary.
A small group was sent to talk to the proprietor of the club who told
them that he would continue to discriminate. Later a mixed group ot
whites and Negroes went to the ' Hilo" and requested service. They were
courteously and efficiently served, with no discrimination of any kind.
I sincerely hope that the "Hilo" continues this non-discriminatory policy,
and that this closes the incident.
