## College Station Status To Be Settled Aug. 1 
### 
The Federal Communications
Commission has changed the hearing
on the status of campus carrier cur
rent stations, such as KZSU, from
June 1 to Aug. 1. The FCC has
proposed to place college stations
under the same regulations as com
mercial broadcast stations.
Petitions for the extension were
submitted by the Intercollegiate
Broadcasting System, of which KZ
SU is a member, and the Westing
iouse Electric Company.
IBS. representing over 100 col
ege stations, requested the exten
,-ion from the June 1 hearing be
i ause it would conflict with exam
periods. This extension will give
students time to file their com
ments with the FCC.
II the campus stations • are not
'■nind to be of educational value.
FCC may feel justified in banning
he college stations. KZSU main
tains that campus stations provide a
.neater opportunity for student par
ticipation and original research.
Alternative proposals lor station
regulations would place campus
broadcasters under the rules for
ion-commercial FM, general broad
cast, the present low - power sta
tions, or ban campus stations.
