# Dr. Strong, Originator of Vocational Tests, To Retire from Farm Psychology Department
## 
### 
Dr. Edward K. Strong Jr.. orig
inator of the Strong Vocational In- ;
terest Tests, will retire at the end of i
this quarter from a less publicized
but important job at Stanford. Ho
will leave the post of Professor of
Psychology and of Applied Psychol
ogy. after teaching here since 1923. \
"I intend, however, to work with !
the Interest Tests for a good many j
years," Dr. Strong said. 'T may tire j
of the work some day, but I doubt
that that clay will come soon."
According to Dr. Strong, the tests I
were only a "hunch" at the time he '
came to Stanford from Carnegie i
Tech. At that institution he had 1
been in charge of vocational educa- j
tion. also doing research work and j
teaching classes in life insurance.
A master's thesis written by a j
friend had set forth some theories 011
determination of aptitude for certain !
occupations. Dr. Strong took up the j
work and began the research that
led eventually in 1027 to the ap- '
pearance of the first Men's Voca
tional Interest Test.
That, test distinguished just 17
occupations, but in 1933 the first
women's test appeared with more
than 20 scales. In 1938 the men's
te.-t was revised, cutting the number
of questions but enlarging the mini- ;
her of eifferentiated occupations to
nearly 40.
During the past 20 years. Dr.
Strong and his staff on the third
floor of Physics Corner have worked
out numerous scales covering many
more occupations than those actu
ally appearing on the tests. Research
for the armed services is still going
on.

The number of occupations ac
tually placed on the form is limited
by the amount that people are will
ing to spend for the tests, Dr. Strong
said. Adding a new group of jobs
not only is initially expensive but
increases the cost of scoring.
Although this phase of his work

lias received the spotlight of atten
tion, Dr. Strong lias a long record
of business teaching. He attended
the University of California, maj
oring in Psychology and Botany.
This unusual combination was the
result of his decision halfway
through the course that he disliked
Botany. Consequently, he persuaded
various professors in the two de
partments to graduate him with a
split major.
"Although graduated probably
isn't just the right word," Dr.
Strong said with a smile. "You
might say I was shaken out with
the earthquake. All of the 190(5 sen
iors were given degrees without
having to finish papers or take ex
aminations."
"And I was fortunate, too," he
added, "for at that time I had ab
solutely no idea of what I was going
to say in a paper that supposedly
covered a full year's work."
After leaving Cal. Dr. Strong
worked for a construction firm en
gaged in rebuilding San Francisco
and the East Bay.
In 1911 he obtained the Ph.D. de
gree from Columbia University,
i writing what he believes is the first
! master's thesis on advertising. He
: continued doing research there in
| the advertising field until 1914. wlu n
he went to Peabody College. Nash
| ville, Tenn.
Next stop was the Army in 1918,
: where he was a member of a com
mittee of 12 apointcd by the Sec
retary of War to set up a personnel
program in the Army.
With the completion of this work
in 1919, Dr. Strong went to Car
negie Tech. and then came to Stan
ford. During his 2(5 years here, ho
has taught seminars in vocational
I interests and courses in business or
ganization, personnel management,
, and the psychological aspects of
business.

Dr. Edward K. Strong Jr.. orig
inator of the Strong Vocational In- ;
terest Tests, will retire at the end of i

ogy. after teaching here since 1923. \
"I intend, however, to work with !
the Interest Tests for a good many j
years," Dr. Strong said. 'T may tire j
of the work some day, but I doubt
that that clay will come soon."
According to Dr. Strong, the tests I
were only a "hunch" at the time he '
came to Stanford from Carnegie i
Tech. At that institution he had 1
been in charge of vocational educa- j
tion. also doing research work and j
teaching classes in life insurance.
A master's thesis written by a j
friend had set forth some theories 011
determination of aptitude for certain !
occupations. Dr. Strong took up the j
work and began the research that
led eventually in 1027 to the ap- '
pearance of the first Men's Voca
tional Interest Test.
That, test distinguished just 17
occupations, but in 1933 the first
women's test appeared with more
than 20 scales. In 1938 the men's
te.-t was revised, cutting the number
of questions but enlarging the mini- ;
her of eifferentiated occupations to
nearly 40.
During the past 20 years. Dr.
Strong and his staff on the third
floor of Physics Corner have worked
out numerous scales covering many
more occupations than those actu
ally appearing on the tests. Research
for the armed services is still going
on.

The number of occupations ac
tually placed on the form is limited
by the amount that people are will
ing to spend for the tests, Dr. Strong
said. Adding a new group of jobs
not only is initially expensive but
increases the cost of scoring.
Although this phase of his work

lias received the spotlight of atten
tion, Dr. Strong lias a long record
of business teaching. He attended
the University of California, maj
oring in Psychology and Botany.
This unusual combination was the
result of his decision halfway
through the course that he disliked
Botany. Consequently, he persuaded
various professors in the two de
partments to graduate him with a
split major.
"Although graduated probably
isn't just the right word," Dr.
Strong said with a smile. "You
might say I was shaken out with
the earthquake. All of the 190(5 sen
iors were given degrees without
having to finish papers or take ex
aminations."
"And I was fortunate, too," he
added, "for at that time I had ab
solutely no idea of what I was going
to say in a paper that supposedly
covered a full year's work."
After leaving Cal. Dr. Strong
worked for a construction firm en
gaged in rebuilding San Francisco
and the East Bay.
In 1911 he obtained the Ph.D. de
gree from Columbia University,
i writing what he believes is the first
! master's thesis on advertising. He
: continued doing research there in
| the advertising field until 1914. wlu n
