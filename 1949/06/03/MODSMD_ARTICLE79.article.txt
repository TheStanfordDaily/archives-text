# Presidents Make Top News
## Number 1 Story Is Dr. Sterling 
### AL McCOMBS 
Dr. Wallace Sterling's selec
tion as Stanford's fifth presi
dent was this year's banner
story in the campus news pa
rade. The appointment, made
Friday, Nov. 19, was heralded
by a special edition of The
Daily at noon, at the same
time the selection was made
known to the faculty.
The Board of Trustees' action
ended a 10-month search for a per
son to iil 1 the chair left vacant by
the sudden death of Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder in January 1948.
Dr. Sterling's name first came into
the spotlight in Nov. 15, when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin sug
gested that he had been selected by
the Board. 1 he Trustees hastily de
nied the action because the appoint
ment was not completed at that
time.
Two other presidents, Harry and
Hank, made big news on campus
during the year. Harry surprised
(57.7 per cent of the Dewey-sup
porting campus on Nov. 2 by knock
ing Gallup ofT his poll. Hank sur
prised no one when he gained the
ASSU office in May. Rosin won by
a landslide.
However, the new ASSU Consti
tution slid by with less glory when
it was instated by a 40-vote majority.
The major issue connected with the
document was student body repre
sentation on Excom.
A week later an amendment to
the new constitution providing for
representation on an area basis was
defeated after coming within a few
votes of the two-thirds needed to
pass.
Stanford women, with the help of
Dean Samuel D. Thurman, Jr., of

the Law School, asserted themselves
in the field of democratic proceed
ings when Women's Council was
forced to submit the demerit plan
to their vote. The measure passed,
four months and many bitter hours
after it was first advocated,
Stanford men had encouraging
news from Washington in January
when the draft was suspended for
three months and federal officials
expressed the view that no one
would be drafted for 18 months.
During the year a $300,000,000
building program made progress
with the completion of Crothers
Hall, the Microwave Laboratory,
and the reconstruction of the Min
eral Sciences Buildings. Stern Hall
is three months from completion and
the Law Building has seven months
to go.
Two fcig names in the musical
world, Xavier Cugat and Benny
Goodman brought Hollywood to the
Farm, and at the end of October the
electrifying news that Stanford ar
chaeologists had uncovered a de
stroyed Troy opened the way for a

colorful homecoming.
Also in October, the Frosh man
aged to stage a pajamarino, much to
their credit, without burning down
Roble, and Injun Joe became the
Farm's answer to Oski.
Four UC men fell victim to En
cina head-shavers during Big Game
Week, and discussion rested on who
had applied more blue paint to the
| campus, Cal or Paly High.
Other November news included
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich's appointment
as head of the New York State Uni
! vemity system and SIRO's effort to
raise $12,000 by auctioning oil
Shmoos and Crosby golf balls.
Meanwhile, television invaded the
j campus and the commuting students
; got the trains to run on time so
i they could make their 8 o'clocks.
Stanford Players scored a mid-
I winter hit with Jane Darwell in the
I production of "Build No Fence
| Around Me," a sellout on every
! staging.
Milk and water made the head
lines as spring quarter opened. The
milk came in the form of individual
containers and the fraternity howl
at the Attorney General's ruling
i made Life magazine. The water
! came in bucketfuls and juniors saw

Lake Lagunita full for the first time, j
Rain also drove the Convalescent |
Home Labor Day inside, but veteran
chef Sam McDonald was up to the |
occasion and fed the Farm anyhow, i
Alphabet activities included NSA's
fight for survival (it finally got the
unanimous support of Excom) ana
KSU's adoption of a "Z" to get in
good with the FCC.
The year's tragedy was the death I
of Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emer
itus of Geology and earthquake
weatherman.
Sports had a fair year and on all
accounts Stanford bowed to USC
except in crew. Nevertheless, the '
Farm put UC to shame in the big i
four of sports, even if Cullom's toe !
claimed a 7 to 6 victory for the
Blue and Gold pigskinners.
Farm hoopmen injected some hope I
into sports fans but met their down
fall alter 17 victories when they tan
gled with CCNY and then went to !
the Southland. In track, Ironman j
Gaylord Bryan, who shared Life
fame with Bossy, had his heyday at j
Berkeley when he chalked up 23 1
points on the track and field.

Dr. Wallace Sterling's selec
tion as Stanford's fifth presi
dent was this year's banner
story in the campus news pa
rade. The appointment, made
Friday, Nov. 19, was heralded
by a special edition of The
Daily at noon, at the same
time the selection was made
known to the faculty.
The Board of Trustees' action
ended a 10-month search for a per
son to iil 1 the chair left vacant by
the sudden death of Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder in January 1948.
Dr. Sterling's name first came into
the spotlight in Nov. 15, when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin sug
gested that he had been selected by
the Board. 1 he Trustees hastily de
nied the action because the appoint
ment was not completed at that
time.
Two other presidents, Harry and
Hank, made big news on campus
during the year. Harry surprised
(57.7 per cent of the Dewey-sup
porting campus on Nov. 2 by knock
ing Gallup ofT his poll. Hank sur
prised no one when he gained the
ASSU office in May. Rosin won by
a landslide.
However, the new ASSU Consti
tution slid by with less glory when
it was instated by a 40-vote majority.
The major issue connected with the
document was student body repre
sentation on Excom.
A week later an amendment to
the new constitution providing for
representation on an area basis was
defeated after coming within a few
votes of the two-thirds needed to
pass.
