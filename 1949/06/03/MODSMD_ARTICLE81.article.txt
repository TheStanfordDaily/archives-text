### HELEN KESSEL 
Forty-six years ago—on June 1,
1903—Jane Lathrop Stanford turned
over the control of University af
fairs to the Board of Trustees.
By that date, the future of the
University seemed relatively safe.
During the years from 1893 to 1899.
as David Starr Jordan stated, "the
future of a university hung by a
single thread .... the love of a
good woman." He was referring, of
course, to Mrs. Stanford.
After Senator Stanford's death in
189.'J, his estate was tied up in liti
gation. Because of the panic and
depression at • that time, raising
money was very difficult. There was
grave danger of the complete bank

ruptcy of the Leland Stanford es- I
tate.
Against the advice of almost all of
her business and legal advisors,
Mrs. Stanford determined to keep
the University from closing. It was J
by her devotion and self-sacrifice !
that Stanford was able to remain
open.
Well-known is the story of how j
Mrs. Stanford was willing to sell her
personal jewels in order to get the
money necessary to keep the Uni
versity from closing. "We may lose
the farms, the railways, the bonds, :
but the jewels still remain. The
University shall remain open. When j
there is no other way, there are still
the jewels."
Only a very few of the jewels were

sold, however, for better times came.
The money of the Stanford estate
was freed from litigation and be
came available for its intended use.
Mrs. Stanford desired to dedicate
her jewels to the building of a
church for the University, but again
other resources were found.
In 1905 Mrs. Stanford requested
the Board of Trustees to sell her
jewels after she died. She wanted
the proceeds from the sale to be
invested in bonds and real estate,
and desired that the income be used
exclusively for buying books and
other publications. This "Jewel
Fund," which amounted to $500,000,
made possible the establishment of
a library for the University.
