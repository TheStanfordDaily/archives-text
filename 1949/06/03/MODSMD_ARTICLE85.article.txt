# Yanks Sign Renna, Kelly
## 
### 
Phe New York Yankees, worked
'up over being shut out by Oakland
in grabbing Jackie Jensen, signed
two other Bay Area baseball menâ€”
Santa Clara's Tom Kelly and Bill
Renna.
Tom Kelly, the Broncos' lanky
first baseman, was one of the top
southpaw sluggers in the CIBA last
season, while his teammate Renna
knocked out more safe hits than
any other stickman in the league.
Renna is also a very speedy out
fielder with a strong arm, playing
the same style of ball as Jackie
Jensen.
