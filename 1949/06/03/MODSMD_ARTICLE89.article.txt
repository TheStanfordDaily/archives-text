# Poloists to Face San Mateo Today
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team winds up its
season today with a match against
San Mateo at 3:30 on the polo field.
Led by captain Bill Decker at the
number three slot, the Indian squad
will be composed of Mickey Seeley,
Lynn Mndlener, and Bill Ross.
The contest will be strictly a
youth versus age affair, with San
Mateo gaining the edge in the ex
perience department. However, the
Cards have come a long way this
season and must l'ate a definite
chance.
For today's game there will be a
P.A. system, which will announce
the players and follow the game,
play by play. The field is located
south of the Sunken Diamond.
