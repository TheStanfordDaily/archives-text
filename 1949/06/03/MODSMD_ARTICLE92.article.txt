# Twenty-seven Senior Lettermen Depart, Leave Behind Colorful Athletic Record
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Twenty-seven sturdy sons of the
Stanford Red who toiled for the
Farm in seven major sports in 1948-
49 will bid their sad farewells to
collegiate competition come this
spring's Sheepskin Day.
The roster of departing stalwarts
includes 12 members of Marchie
Schwartz's Big Red Machine; eight
performers from the on-again, off
again 1949 hoop squad; three cin
dermen from Jack Weiershauser's
Trojan - plagued track corps; an
other trio who did their work for
Harry Wolter at the Sunken Dia
mond; a quartet of tankers from
Tom Haynie's nearly perfect dual
meet artists; three veteran tennis
lettermen; and one lone golf
stroke r.
Heading the list of departees
are the versatile Andersons, Mar
ty and Boh. who will lie missing
from the local gridiron scene for
the first time in four vears when
the '19 eleven rolls into action in
mid-September.
Marty held down a fullback post
tor the Cards for three consecutive
years, climaxing his long career in
fitting fashion by pacing Stanford to
within one point of Golden Eoy and
company in last fall's Big Game.
Anderson's stirring performance in
Strawberry Canyon caused Coach
Schwartz to remark of his blond
pile-driver, "Marty is truly an in
spirational player—a great asset to
any team."
Marty a'so turned in some stellar
track work during his stay at the
Farm, competing in the sprints and
the pole vault in '47 and '48; and he
also found time to serve as student
body president during the academic
year of 1946-47.
The list of Bob Anderson's ath
letic achievements would probably
stretch all the way up and down
Hoover Tower. On the football
field, his most notable achievements
were in 1946. when he teamed with
Lloyd Merrman to form the famous
Touchdown Twins combo which ac
counted for 20 Stanford touchdowns
that season.
But it was at swimming that
Rapid Robert's star shone brightest.
Bob captured the national 50-yard
dash crown in both 1946 and 1948,
and still holds the PCC records in
the 50 and 100 sprints, as well as the
prevai'nig American mark for the
50-yard dash in a 20-yard pool.
Another man with a long record

who will -be absent when the 1 949
r;rid roll call is tfken is Gene Mar
tin, football pass - catcher deluxe
and once a leading contender for |
Southern Division basketball scor
ing honors.
Gtne placed sixth among the j
league's hocp scorers in 1946. 112 ut
restricted his ath'etic endeavors to
the gridiron in the following two
years. There he received coast-wide i
fame as a sticky-fingered pass re
ceiver, rnd hardly a game passed ,
without Gene turning up with at j
least one circus catch and more
than his share of regulation com
pletions. I
Everett Dean will lose the services j
of three of last year's first-string 1
hardwood artists, including two for- ;
mer team captains.
Rugged Dave Davidson played
three >ears of varsity ball, oper
ating as a first-string guard in
each of them.
After captaining the Indians in
his sophomore year in 1947, Driving ;
Dave slipped slightly off form in :
'48. then came back last season to
eclipse all past performances by
leading the Cards in Southern Di
vision scoring and getting hmself
chosen on every mythcal all-divi
sion five in the books.
Perhaps the most noteworthy
tribute to Davidson's efficiency as a
ball-hawker, floor leader, and net
swisher was paid him by the play
ers of the City College of New York
squad.
Fo'lowing the Stanford - CCNY
massacre at the Cow Palace, the big
city boys agreed to a man that Dave
was one oi' the finest guards they '
had encountered all season; and
the Holman-coached crew saw a lot
of guards of all sizes and shapes in
their nationwide tour.
Steve Stephenson, another de
parting three-year veteran of the
wars, twice gained ail-confer
ence second team honors for his
work at the pivot post. Big Steve,
he of the expressionless face and
battleship roll, was one of the cool
est craftsmen ever to appear in the
pint-sized Card Pavilion. And rl
though his deadly hook shot con
sistent'y ranked him with Coast's
top scorers throughout his appren
ticeshpi at the Farm. Steve's great
est asset was doubtlessly his calm
efficiency as a floor leader and
clutch performer.
It was Steve, you'll recall, who
flipped in that last-ten-second cir

cus shot to sink the Spartans from
San Jose by one point in this year's
top Pavilion thriller; and while am
bling Steve wasn't always that spec
tacular about it. his come-through
performances saved many a game
for the Stanford thin-clads.
Blanket Bobby Lewis completes
the trio of first-line hoopsters who
will set sail in the civilian sea come
graduation. Stringbean Bub, the de
fensive wizard of college court cir
cles, performed with Dean's bounce
artists for three years following one
season with Utah's freshman won
ders of 1946.
Many of the hottest scorers in the
nation were cooled by Lewis' throt
tling defensive tactics, including
j such experts as Tony Lavelli of
Yale, Cal's immortal Andy Wolfe,
; App'es Kudelka of St. Mary's, and
many others.
When Bob held Lavelli to two
baskets at the Cow Palace last De
cember, it marked the first time in
; over a year that the Yale flash had
: failed to run his scoring total into
two figures.
But Bob didn't confine his efforts
solely to the hardwood. He also
! spent three seasons with the Card
j tennis team and was every bit as
successful on the concrete as on the
; lumber.
Bob's greatest achievement in
the net game occurred just last
! week when lie upset one of the
nation's top-ranking college stars,
L'SF's Art Larseu, during a dual
meet between the two schools.
Al! the varsity teams are losing
some good men with long records,
! but the Card baseballers will say
goodbye this year to the man with
; the longest record of them all —
Coach Harry Wolter, a veteran of
. 26 wears of Sunken Diamond and
pre-Sunkeh Diamond goings-on.
Four members of Coach Harry's
! last team also bow out of college
' play this season.
Bill Arce, keeper of the hot cor
i ner and this season's captain; Blast
ing Bob Nava. hard-hitting outer
i gardener; Ray Winterhalter, the
mighty mite of the keystone sack:
and hurler Frank La Brum have
all played heir final college game.
Jack Weiershauser will bid
adieu to the McKees, Downing
and Steve, and is also scheduled
to lose powerhouse Gav Bryan.
Al Holubar, who was ruled in
eligible this season due to a tech
-1 nicality, will graduate this month.

LEWIS, above, and DAVE DA
VIDSON', left, will ail graduate
this June after colorful collegiate
careers. Arce lettered three years
in baseball, and Ixswis and David
son did the saine in basketball.
Lewis doubled in tennis where
he ivcently defeated USF's Art
Larsen in one of the major up
sets of the year. (See Bernstein's
story.)
