# JOHN HALL
## The 						Front Row 
### 
As is the custom for closing day wanderings, I would like to take one
quick sweep at clearing up a few pending problems. For me, with thu
Ust outcry, it's farewell to sport, and a new boy, John Breier, will step up
to take his cuts from here on out.
First, I'd like to d<> the usual and pass out a few posies
To brother Breicr who has teen turning in a top job on sports side
lor two years now, and who will give football complete, minute, and ever
lasting coverage next season.
To Don Liebendorfer. Stanford's versatile and hard-working Athletic
Publicity Director, who has given me much time and has helped every
chance he had to make The Daily sports pages a better product.
To the base'call battery of Dave Dahlc and Jim Castagnoli, which pro
duced entertaining and sparkling moments during a dreary CIBA cam
paign. Castagnoli, admittedly making a good share of miscues, was still
far and away the most entertaining backstop in the league. His crazy
antics, deep throaty voice, and big bat made him a highly valuable man
to have around. It'll be a pleasure to watch Jim play that center spot
for Marchie next season.
To Dave Davidson, the best all-around guard and best come-through
eager in recent years.
To Boh Burnett. who turned in an excellent coaching job with the bas
ketball men during their brief spiing practice session. Burnett had the
old sweat glands working overtime as he sent the men through several
rugged scrimmages.
To Harry Ilugasian. Bill McColl, and Gary iverkorian, the frosh trium
virate, who made it worth while to crawl out of the sack early Saturday
morn to watch the gridders toil. Those boys, as all have said, are going io
be heard from plenty in future years.
To Dwiglit Wilbur, George Anderson, Bob Bernstein, A 1 Berry, Dan
Winston, Phil Steinmetz, and Dick Klein, all of whom put in many hours
and much effort in turning out the sports pages for the past season.
And that's all the posies.
But, further thanks to Bill Merrill and Elwyn Bugge for showing
at least definite leadership in the Front Row.
Also, thanks to the gentlemen—one unsigned, one David Spokely—
who wrote letters around USC Track Meet time with timely hints of
pending disaster.
CRYSTAL BAI L NOTES:
With thoughts ol the future, I would like to jump on the band wagons
of fireball Ronnie Garver in basketball, who should be very much in evi
dence when Dean's cage machine whips into gear next December.
Dean Borbu will be the best Stanford cheerleader since prewar days.
Win or lose, it will be a good time for all in the Stanford section next
autumn.
REGRETS:
I regret that such a delicate situation developed over the Blocks for
Crew request, but it only one thing was accomplished, it was pointed out
that Stanford needs a better system or see ol standards by which to judge
such requests.
Along such line-. Mickey Titus has started ;t plan in action which would
establish a definite policy. You will be hearing more about it in the near
future.
For the present, crew has been satisfied with the answering of the
team's greatest desire—that of being invited to Poughkeepsie.
FINAL ADDS:
And a final acid, all's well that ends well, and next season belongs to
Stanford.
The nervous disease of the typewriter which has been whipping out
USC victory stories has got to go.

Winston, Phil Steinmetz, and Dick Klein, all of whom put in many hours
and much effort in turning out the sports pages for the past season.
And that's all the posies.
But, further thanks to Bill Merrill and Elwyn Bugge for showing
at least definite leadership in the Front Row.
Also, thanks to the gentlemen—one unsigned, one David Spokely—
who wrote letters around USC Track Meet time with timely hints of
pending disaster.
CRYSTAL BAI L NOTES:
With thoughts ol the future, I would like to jump on the band wagons
of fireball Ronnie Garver in basketball, who should be very much in evi
dence when Dean's cage machine whips into gear next December.
Dean Borbu will be the best Stanford cheerleader since prewar days.
Win or lose, it will be a good time for all in the Stanford section next
autumn.
REGRETS:
I regret that such a delicate situation developed over the Blocks for
Crew request, but it only one thing was accomplished, it was pointed out
that Stanford needs a better system or see ol standards by which to judge
such requests.
Along such line-. Mickey Titus has started ;t plan in action which would
establish a definite policy. You will be hearing more about it in the near
future.
For the present, crew has been satisfied with the answering of the
team's greatest desire—that of being invited to Poughkeepsie.
FINAL ADDS:
And a final acid, all's well that ends well, and next season belongs to
Stanford.
The nervous disease of the typewriter which has been whipping out
USC victory stories has got to go.
As is the custom for closing day wanderings, I would like to take one
quick sweep at clearing up a few pending problems. For me, with thu
Ust outcry, it's farewell to sport, and a new boy, John Breier, will step up
to take his cuts from here on out.
First, I'd like to d<> the usual and pass out a few posies
To brother Breicr who has teen turning in a top job on sports side
lor two years now, and who will give football complete, minute, and ever
lasting coverage next season.
To Don Liebendorfer. Stanford's versatile and hard-working Athletic
Publicity Director, who has given me much time and has helped every
chance he had to make The Daily sports pages a better product.
To the base'call battery of Dave Dahlc and Jim Castagnoli, which pro
duced entertaining and sparkling moments during a dreary CIBA cam
paign. Castagnoli, admittedly making a good share of miscues, was still
far and away the most entertaining backstop in the league. His crazy
antics, deep throaty voice, and big bat made him a highly valuable man
to have around. It'll be a pleasure to watch Jim play that center spot
for Marchie next season.
To Dave Davidson, the best all-around guard and best come-through
eager in recent years.
To Boh Burnett. who turned in an excellent coaching job with the bas
ketball men during their brief spiing practice session. Burnett had the
old sweat glands working overtime as he sent the men through several
rugged scrimmages.
To Harry Ilugasian. Bill McColl, and Gary iverkorian, the frosh trium
virate, who made it worth while to crawl out of the sack early Saturday
morn to watch the gridders toil. Those boys, as all have said, are going io
be heard from plenty in future years.
To Dwiglit Wilbur, George Anderson, Bob Bernstein, A 1 Berry, Dan
Winston, Phil Steinmetz, and Dick Klein, all of whom put in many hours
and much effort in turning out the sports pages for the past season.
And that's all the posies.
