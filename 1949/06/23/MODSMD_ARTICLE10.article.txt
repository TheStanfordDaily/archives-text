## Frosh Orientation 
### 
Freshmen coming to Stanford during summer quarter find a
strange situation. Campus extracurricular life, instead of being
centered on social and athletic activities, is mainly based on the
interests of the graduate students—who are mostly school
teachers coming back to brush up.
The freshmen are lost in the whirl of education conferences
and institutes that covers the campus during the summer.
Always before the freshmen have remained pretty much in
the dark until Fall or Winter quarter, when they came back and
found out what life at Stanford was really like. This year House
Directors and sponsors are trying to change that.
An extensive orientation period has been planned for the new
freshmen—both men and women. The programs for each group
are coordinated, so that the freshmen on campus this summer
will become an integrated group and develop class spirit.
The head sponsors at both Lagunita and Encina, the sponsors
working under them, and the house directors, all worked to
gether to create a program that would indoctrinate the group as
a whole into Stanford life.
This group included all aspects of the situation.
The freshmen will get a taste of Farm social life from a Jolly-
Up, a Splash party at the women's gym, exchange dinners, and
dances.
They will also hear speakers talking on subjects concerning
their life on campus so far as the Administration is concerned.
Dean of Student Lawrence Kimpton, Chief Counselor for
Women Elva Brown, Professor A. H. Grommon, Health Service
Chief G. H. Houck, and Chaplain Paul Johnstone will all speak
to the freshmen on various phases of campus life.
All those concerned with indoctrinating the Freshmen into
campus life have done a conscientious job. They deserve all the
credit for any spirit and unity that develops in this group of
freshmen.
