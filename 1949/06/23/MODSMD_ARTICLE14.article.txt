# No Loyalty Check In Slav Schools
## 
### 
Sava Kosanovic, former Yugoslav
Minister of Information and pres
ent delegate to the United Nations
from that, country, told The Daily
yesterday that the Yugoslav uni
versities are not controlled as much
as their counterpart in America,
and the Yugoslav press is more free
than American newspapers and
magazines.
There are no loyalty oaths to be
taken by Yugoslav professors, Ko
sanovic said. Only men teaching
material which would lead to for
cible overthrow of the government,
or who sympathized with the enemy
in the past war, are dismissed.
Since newspapers in Yugoslavia
are owned and edited by unions,
syndicates, and other organizations
of the masses, they present a more
acurate picture of public opinion
than do our privately owned peri
odicals, he said.
Kosanovic pointed out that in the
last presidential election. American
perodicals fell far short of mirror
ing popular sentiment. Press free
dom is relative, the Yugoslav min
ister said. Americans, used to news
papers supported 'by private inter
ests. do not understand the true
meaning of freedom of the press.
The only control the Yugoslav
government exerts over the entry
of foreign news into that country
is a selling permit which must be
obtained by foregn newspapers.
There is no strict censorship as such
in Yugoslavia. All controls are
morally imposed by the editor him
self.
Criticisms of existing conditions
appear frequently in their news
papers. Kosanovic said.
The Catholic Church, which is
basically anti - Communist, is al
lowed complete freedom to print
whatever they wish. Kosanovic
added.
The educational system in Yugo
slavia is completely state owned and
operated, the minister said, and the
number of students has doubled
since the war. The number of bonks
and newspapers printed in that
country has correspondinglv doub
led.
