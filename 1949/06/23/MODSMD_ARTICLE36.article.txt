# Hansen Leaves For Athens To Study Greek Art
## 
### 
Dr. Hazel Hansen, Stanford
professor of classics, left Mon
day by air for a year's sabbati
cal leave in Greece.
An honorary citizen of Greece as
well as an expert on Grecian ar
chaeology, she will divide her time
between study of prehistoric Greek
art and visits to the island of Sky
ros, where she has long engaged in
a one-woman relief campaign.
One of Dr. Hansen's pleasant du
ties will be to inspect the results of
the relief work which she has car
ried on during the past year with
the help of toher Stanford faculty
members and students. Eight hun
dred pounds of clothing were sent
to Skyros, and Dr. Hansen has com
mented that residents of the Greek
island must bear a strange resem
blance, in dress at least, to the
Stanford campus.
Dr. Hansen will be joined on a
trip to Crete and Cyprus by Mrs.
Mary S. Mead, Stanford archaeol
ogy major from Denver, Colorado,
who has been working with Dr.
Hansen on restoration of the col
lection of ancient Grecian vases
which were broken during the 1906
earthquake when they were tum
bled off display shelves in the Stan
ford museum.
While Mrs. Mead returns to
Stanford in the fall to teach archae
ology, Dr. Hansen will continue her
studies in Cyprus until she returns
to Athens to do research work dur
ing the winter and spring at the
Americnn School of Classical Stud
ies.
