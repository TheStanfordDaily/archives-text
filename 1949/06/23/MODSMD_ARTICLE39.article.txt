# Sunday Movie Stars Cantor
## 
### 
ASSU-sponsored motion pictures
return to Memorial Auditorium this
Sunday with Eddie Cantor starring
in the musical extravaganza "Ro
man Scandals."
The Sunday Evening Movies are
a weekly tradition during the reg
ular school year.
''Roman Scandals," a million-dol
lar production, tells the story of a
Western farm boy who dreams he
lives in ancient Rome. Cantor's es
capades with the Emperor's harem
provide a balance of comedy and
sex.
George Kaufmann has written the
story, and the songs were com
posed by Cantor. Appearing in the
cast with the banjo-eyed comedian
are lovely Gloria Stuart and the
Goldwyn girls.
Supplementing the main attrac
tion will be the first chapter of "The
Daughter of Don Q" and a Bugs
Bunny cartoon.
The performance begins at 7:30
p.m. in the Memorial Auditorium.
Admission is 20 cents.
