# Crew Preps for Poughkeepsie
## 
### 
! For the first time since 1915 Stan-
I ford will be represented at Pough
| keepsie. The Indian oarsmen arrived
last Saturday and have been hold
ing daily workouts ever since in
! preparation for the big race which
| is slated for Saturday.
! Washington and California are
' rated as the favorites by veteran
observers. Princeton, beaten only
! by Harvard, seems to be the clas
j siest of the Eastern crews, followed
by Wisconsin, Navy, and Yale.
The Indians are rated as dark
horses and could prove to be the
big surprise in Saturday's race.
The campaign to raise funds for ;
the trip was more than successful,
as the goal of $3,000 was oversub
scribed by $500. The extra money
received will go toward a new shell j
1 which was ordered a year ago. This
shell, which will be used in the ]
Poughkeepsie race, was assembled
Sunday morning and promptly
christened the "Ace Clark in honor
| of the Indian coach.
Crews entered in the big inter
collegiate rowing regatta went ;
' through slow tine trials yesterday |
1 on the Hudson River and had the j
coaches soft - pedaling their opti- I
mism.
California's Golden Bears were
! reported to have swung their j
' sweeps down the course in ap- 1
proximately 15 minutes.
Coach Ky Ebright didn't reveal
the exact time, but said his boys
"were pretty good but nothing
wonderful." The Bears' varsity beat
the junior varsity by four lengths.
The record for the course is 13 min

utes, 33 3/5 seconds, set by Navy
in 1922.
The report on the defending
champion Washington Huskies was

that they had clocked 15 minutes
i and 20 seconds, indicating that they
! are not yet in trim for the long haul
j on the Hudson.
