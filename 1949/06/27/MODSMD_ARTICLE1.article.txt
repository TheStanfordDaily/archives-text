# Chancellor, President Was Farm Alumnus
## 
### 
Stanford University lost one
its greatest alumni yester
lay morning with the death of
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Always close to the heart of
the University since his gradu
ation in 1896, Dr. Wilbur died
at his home only a short dis
tance from the Quad.
Since his retirement as President
>112 Stanford University in 1943, Dr.
Wilbur served as Chancellor of the
University until his death. The
Chancellor was a familiar sight,
walking between his home and his
office on the eleventh floor of the
Hoover Library.
Dr. Wilbur was the first alumnus
to be selected President of the Uni
versity. He served in this capacity
lor 27 years from 1916 to 19413, in
cluding a span of four years from
1929 to 1933 when he was Secretary
of the Interior under Herbert Hoo
ver.
Previous to his term as President.
Or. Wilbur administered the new
Stanford Medical School as Dean
om 1911 to 1916. He graduated
. rom Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco in 1899, returning to the
campus as assistant professor of
physiology the next year.
Dr. Wilbur was president of the
senior class at the time of his grad
uation in 1896. He was an outstand
ing campus politician with a fine
record in curricular affairs.
"Had Stanford followed the cus
om of many Eastern universities
in naming the graduate most likely
to succeed," declared Will Irwin,
•Stanford '98, "that one person would
have been Ray Lyman Wilbur."
The 27 years of Dr. Wilbur's pres
dency saw many dramatic changes
t Stanford. It was during this pe
od that Stanford developed into
a University in the true sense of the
word.
The Lower Division was organ
ized; departments were organized
into schools; work in research and
the professions was built on these
foundations; and new units such as
the Food Research Institute and the
Hoover Library joined the older es
tablished schools.
It was under Dr. Wilbur's admin
istration in 1917 that the semester
system was abandoned and the pres
ent-day quarter system put into op
eration.
The period saw the establishment
of the Schools of Education, Law,
Social Sciences, Biological Sciences,
and Engineering, and the Graduate
School of Business.
The old Stanford home was made
into the Convalescent Home. The
honor system was also adopted. Dr.
Wilbur encouraged student govern
ment, leading to the unique Men's
and Women's Councils which han
dle all cases which violate Stanford
laws and regulations.
A building program during his
presidency saw the erection of such
weH-known campus sites as Roble
Hall, the Library, the Women's
Gym, the Basketball Pavilion, and
the Stadium. Other buildings were
Toyon and Branner Halls, the Art
Gallery, the Palo Alto Hospital, the
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco,
the Stanford Press, the Ryan High-
Voltage Laboratory, and the Presi
dent's house on the Knoll.
After considerable pondei'ing, Dr.
Wilbur took a leave of absence from
Stanford to become Secretary of the
Interior in 1929. When the Hoover
administration ended in March of
1933, he returned to the campus to
his old job.
While Dr. Wilbur was in Wash
ington in 1930, the famed "twenty
one" recovered the stolen Stanford
Axe from California. He sent a tel
egram to the acting President and
the students to express his hearty
pleasure.
In 1943 he retired, and was ac
corded the office of Chancellor.
Dr. Wilbur had a great future be
fore him as a physician had he not
turned to administration of the
Medical School, and then the Uni
versity.
However, in the winter and
spring *)f 1903, he dropped his pro
fessorship at Stanford completely
to combat a desperate epidemic of
typhoid fever in the Bay Area.
Shortly after the epidemic he
went abroad for study. Upon his
return from Germany in 1911 he
took the deanship of the Medical
School.
His first and most outstanding
contribution was the establishment
of full-time clinical instructors in
preference to the old method of
clinical instruction by physicians.
In 1916 he succeeded Dr. Branner
in the presidency of the University.

Or. Wilbur administered the new
Stanford Medical School as Dean
om 1911 to 1916. He graduated
. rom Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco in 1899, returning to the
campus as assistant professor of
physiology the next year.
Dr. Wilbur was president of the
senior class at the time of his grad
uation in 1896. He was an outstand
ing campus politician with a fine
record in curricular affairs.
"Had Stanford followed the cus
om of many Eastern universities
in naming the graduate most likely
to succeed," declared Will Irwin,
•Stanford '98, "that one person would
have been Ray Lyman Wilbur."
The 27 years of Dr. Wilbur's pres
dency saw many dramatic changes
t Stanford. It was during this pe
od that Stanford developed into
a University in the true sense of the
word.
The Lower Division was organ
ized; departments were organized
into schools; work in research and
the professions was built on these
foundations; and new units such as
the Food Research Institute and the
Hoover Library joined the older es
tablished schools.
It was under Dr. Wilbur's admin
istration in 1917 that the semester
system was abandoned and the pres
ent-day quarter system put into op
eration.
The period saw the establishment
of the Schools of Education, Law,
Social Sciences, Biological Sciences,
and Engineering, and the Graduate
School of Business.
The old Stanford home was made
into the Convalescent Home. The
honor system was also adopted. Dr.
Wilbur encouraged student govern
ment, leading to the unique Men's
and Women's Councils which han
dle all cases which violate Stanford
laws and regulations.
A building program during his
presidency saw the erection of such
weH-known campus sites as Roble
Hall, the Library, the Women's
Gym, the Basketball Pavilion, and
the Stadium. Other buildings were
Toyon and Branner Halls, the Art
Gallery, the Palo Alto Hospital, the
Stanford Hospital in San Francisco,
the Stanford Press, the Ryan High-
Voltage Laboratory, and the Presi
dent's house on the Knoll.
After considerable pondei'ing, Dr.
Wilbur took a leave of absence from
Stanford to become Secretary of the
Interior in 1929. When the Hoover
administration ended in March of
1933, he returned to the campus to
his old job.
While Dr. Wilbur was in Wash
ington in 1930, the famed "twenty
one" recovered the stolen Stanford
Axe from California. He sent a tel
egram to the acting President and
the students to express his hearty
pleasure.
In 1943 he retired, and was ac
corded the office of Chancellor.
Dr. Wilbur had a great future be
fore him as a physician had he not
turned to administration of the
Medical School, and then the Uni
versity.
However, in the winter and
spring *)f 1903, he dropped his pro
fessorship at Stanford completely
to combat a desperate epidemic of
typhoid fever in the Bay Area.
Shortly after the epidemic he
went abroad for study. Upon his
return from Germany in 1911 he
took the deanship of the Medical
School.
His first and most outstanding
contribution was the establishment
of full-time clinical instructors in
preference to the old method of
clinical instruction by physicians.
In 1916 he succeeded Dr. Branner
in the presidency of the University.
