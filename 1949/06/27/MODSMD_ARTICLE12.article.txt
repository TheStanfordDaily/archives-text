DR. WALLACE STERLING, Presi
dent of the University.
"The entire Stanford family is
saddened by the death of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur. His career devel
oped contemporaneously with the
growth of the University he loved
and served so well for a quarter of
a century.
"He brought to its presidency the
insight of a diagnostician and that
leadership which is derived from
nobility of character and keenness
of mind. He found time also to
serve his country with distinction
in many ways, not least as a cabi
net member. His honors were many
and he carried them to easy dignity.
He did not wear his heart on his
sleeve, but 112 can testify that it was
warm and generous.
"All Stanford salutes him as one
of her own and mourns his passing."

IK A S. LILLICK. secretary and
long-time member of the Board of
Trustees.
"Stanford University has 'lost a
supporter, who from the days when
he took over as its President, con
veyed the feeling that Stanford as
a free and independent institution
represented the best in education,
not only in California but in the
nation.
"Those who recognize true values
regardless of political climate have
always admired his services as Sec
retary of the Interior in Herbert
Hoover's cabinet. He displayed in
that high office the same wisdom,
unselfishness, and lofty principles
that made Stanford under him a
guiding star for youth."

HOMER R. SPENCE, Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of
California, President of Stanford

helpful."

manitarian his life was dedicated to
the service of mankind. As the

I President of Stanford for over 27
1 years he guided the University
; through two wars, a great depres
