## The 						Sports Desk Giants Participate in Coaching Clinc; Bryan Gets Another Year of Eligibility 
### 
The Fourth Annual Stanford University Coaching Clinic came to a
conclusion last Saturday after a week of instruction and demonstrations
in football, basketball, track, and baseball. The instructors were the entire
Stanford coaching staff and members of the coaching and scouting staffs
of the New York Giants while the students were the high school and junior
college coaches in the state.
The Giants, who were here at the invitation of the University, took
over during the last two days of the Clinic and provided expert instruction
on the technical aspects of baseball.
Representing the New Yorkers were such all-time greats as Carl Hub
bell. Mel Ott, Walter Reuther, Tom Sheehan, John Lobert, Frank Shellen
back, and "Moose" Krause. The latter is the present Stanford line coach,
who does a little scouting for the Giants in his spare time.
The highlight of the program came Friday afternoon on the Sunken
Diamond when Hubbell took his position on the mound and displayed
some of the form which made him one of the top hurlers in the National
League for more than a decade.
HiibbelTs Curve Slill Breaks a Mile
He served up his famous "screwball," and the hook on his curve
brought many a gasp from the assemblage. Hubbell won 253 games in the
majors before he called it quits four years ago, and he still seems to have
the stuff to make him a winning pitcher in any league. At present he
the director of the Giants' farm system.
Mel Ott, who last year retired as Giant manager for a job in the front
office, put on a batting exhibition. Mel was a little rusty, but he managed
to elout a couple of pitches into the far reaches of the outfield. He didn't
hit any balls out of the park, however, since the 355-foot right field fence
at the Sunken Diamond is a little more distant than the 2(io-l'oot fence
at the Polo Grounds where Ott set all his home run records.

Victor O. Schmidt. Pacific Coast Conference Commissioner, last Friday
granted Gay Bryan another year of college eligibility. This decision
brought to an end the confusion which had arisen in regard to Bryan's
case.
Bryan was on the Cal track team in 1945 and participated in five meets
before he was forced to withdraw from school in order to report for duty
with the Navy. As a result he was unable to complete the University of
California track schedule and compete at the California Relays at Modesto.
Incomplete War-Time Seasons Don't Count
According to the provisions of the Conference Athletic Code any season
which was cut short by the entry of an athlete into the armed forces shall
not be counted as a year of elibility.
At the June 1947 conference meeting an earlier petition submitted by
Bryan was denied and when the question was brought up again at the
conference meeting this month, it was ruled that it was not a matter of
interpretation but merely a matter of surveying the facts and therefore
did not require a petition.
This brings us up to the present situation where the Commissioner had
to decide if the California Relays was an integral part of the 1945 Cal
track season. As recorded earlier. Schmidt's decision was in the affirma
tive and Bryan now has a chance to go through his iron man act for an
other year.

the director of the Giants' farm system.
Mel Ott, who last year retired as Giant manager for a job in the front
office, put on a batting exhibition. Mel was a little rusty, but he managed
to elout a couple of pitches into the far reaches of the outfield. He didn't
hit any balls out of the park, however, since the 355-foot right field fence
at the Sunken Diamond is a little more distant than the 2(io-l'oot fence
at the Polo Grounds where Ott set all his home run records.

Victor O. Schmidt. Pacific Coast Conference Commissioner, last Friday
granted Gay Bryan another year of college eligibility. This decision
brought to an end the confusion which had arisen in regard to Bryan's
case.
Bryan was on the Cal track team in 1945 and participated in five meets
before he was forced to withdraw from school in order to report for duty
with the Navy. As a result he was unable to complete the University of
California track schedule and compete at the California Relays at Modesto.
Incomplete War-Time Seasons Don't Count
According to the provisions of the Conference Athletic Code any season
which was cut short by the entry of an athlete into the armed forces shall
not be counted as a year of elibility.
At the June 1947 conference meeting an earlier petition submitted by
Bryan was denied and when the question was brought up again at the
conference meeting this month, it was ruled that it was not a matter of
interpretation but merely a matter of surveying the facts and therefore
did not require a petition.
This brings us up to the present situation where the Commissioner had
to decide if the California Relays was an integral part of the 1945 Cal
track season. As recorded earlier. Schmidt's decision was in the affirma
tive and Bryan now has a chance to go through his iron man act for an
other year.
The Fourth Annual Stanford University Coaching Clinic came to a
conclusion last Saturday after a week of instruction and demonstrations
in football, basketball, track, and baseball. The instructors were the entire
Stanford coaching staff and members of the coaching and scouting staffs
of the New York Giants while the students were the high school and junior
college coaches in the state.
The Giants, who were here at the invitation of the University, took
over during the last two days of the Clinic and provided expert instruction
on the technical aspects of baseball.
Representing the New Yorkers were such all-time greats as Carl Hub
bell. Mel Ott, Walter Reuther, Tom Sheehan, John Lobert, Frank Shellen
back, and "Moose" Krause. The latter is the present Stanford line coach,
who does a little scouting for the Giants in his spare time.
The highlight of the program came Friday afternoon on the Sunken
Diamond when Hubbell took his position on the mound and displayed
some of the form which made him one of the top hurlers in the National
League for more than a decade.
HiibbelTs Curve Slill Breaks a Mile
He served up his famous "screwball," and the hook on his curve
brought many a gasp from the assemblage. Hubbell won 253 games in the
majors before he called it quits four years ago, and he still seems to have
the stuff to make him a winning pitcher in any league. At present he
the director of the Giants' farm system.
