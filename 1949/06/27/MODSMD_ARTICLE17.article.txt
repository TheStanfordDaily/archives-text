## Bear Crewmen Edge Huskies by a Length 
### 
Stanford's orphan crew had to be j
content with tenth place Saturday j
as the California Bears swept to
victory by a length over the Uni- j
versity of Washington at the 47th an- j
nual Poughkeepsie Regatta.
The Bears had a tough time of it '
as a driving wind and threatening
vveather as well as a field of 12 crews i
urnished stiff competition through- j
>ut the three mile race.
The Bears were followed across \
he finish line by Washington, Cor
icll. Navy, and Princeton in that
U'der.
Early Cal Lead
At the start of the race Cal jumped '
nto an early lead followed by
3 rinceton, Washington and Yale, j
lowever, the Huskies soon jumped i
nto the lead which they held at the
nile position.

At two miles California drew even
with Washington and from here on it
was nip and tuck all the way with
the Bears steadily pulling ahead at
the finish.
The Indians, whom many observers
had picked for fifth, were obviously
suffering from a case of over- cau
tiousness.
Clark Takes Blame
Lieutenant Commander Asa A.
Clark. Stanford's volunteer coach
was quick to take the blame for his
crew's tenth place finish, claiming
that he had told them to row lower
than the outcome proved they should
have.
The order of finish and the times
are as follows:
L California (14:42 (!).
2. Washington (14:45 1).
:i. Cornell (15:06 !>).
