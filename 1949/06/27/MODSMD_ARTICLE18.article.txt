Bryan, who after a sensational
early season began sliding back
ward, showed his old form Saturday
night at Radcliffe Stadium when he
won both the broad jump with a leap
of 25 feet l 1 .• inches, and then copped
the hop, skip, and jump with a mark
of 49 feet, one inch.
The versatile Bryan's best mark*in
the broad jump was achieved last
April in a meet against UCLA when
he leaped 25 fett, 4 3-4 inches.

told Tulare officials he was unde
cided if he would make the trip down
from Fresno and enter the decathlon
championships today and tomorrow.
