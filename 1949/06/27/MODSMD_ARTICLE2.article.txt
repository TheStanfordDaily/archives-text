Ray Lyman Wilbur is dead.
The man who "built Stanford from a college to a great Univer
sity" died yesterday morning after devoting his whole life to the
service of mankind.
Dr. Wilbur, a man with a great mind and a warm heart, rose
from the ranks of Stanford as an outstanding student, .to the
heights in education, statesmanship, and science. In each ca
pacity he made an enviable record which gave his name na
tional prominence.
Dr. Wilbur did not limit himself to one interest, but during his
entire life he was the generating force in many activities. Men
rallied about him, drawn to him and spurred on by the driving
force inherent in him.
And altlj«NUtth Dr. Wilbur was great in many fields, his service
jms as one of his outstanding achievements.
Chancfciior Wilbur knew and loved his students, for he grew
up as one of them, and even at his death the vital activity of
campus life undoubtedly drifted the several blocks to his bed
side.
And this campus activity was due to the efforts of Dr. Wilbur
as president of the University.
He excelled in the administrative duties of a university presi
dent, but more important, he kept in close touch with the stu
dents.
As president he was a leader and example for the undergrad
uates, to counsel and to be a fripnd to all under any circum
stances. He was strict, but quick to pardon and give a second
chance.
Dr. Wilbur had great faith in his students, and because he
believed in them he incorporated student government and the
honor code system into Stanford life.
In his 27 years as President, Dr. Wilbur considered it his high
privilege to give that wise and kindly inspiration so necessary
to students in their endeavor to gain knowledge.
And though Stanford mourns the death of its great benefactor,
the spirit that Ray Lyman Wilbur instilled in the University will
never die.


DR. IJAY LYMAN WILBUR served for 27 us President of the Univer
sity. was Secretary of the Interior during Hoover's administration, and
had been Chancellor of the University since 1943, when he retired as
