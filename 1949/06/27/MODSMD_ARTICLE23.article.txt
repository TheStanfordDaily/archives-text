Two thousand six hundred and fourteen students registered
for summer quarter last Thursday and Friday, the Registrar's
office announced.
More students are expected to register today, since several
schools were not cut until last weekend.
One thousand sixty-four men and 650 women registered. The

ratio of men to women stood at
J. 02 to 1.
Last year the enrollment figure
.stood at 2,878. This summer's regis
tration is expected to equal this, de
pending upon late registration.
Assistant Registrar Harvey Hall
said that the registration procedure
went off as well as expected, with
no major difficulties encountered.
The old returning students' line
was long, he said, because the files
of old graduates are handled in such
a way that many students cannot
be registered quickly. These stu
dents, many returning unannounced
and unexpected, must have their
files checked to make certain that
they are eligible to enroll.
Students went through the regis
tration procedure well spread out
over registration day, Mr. Hall said.
There was no bunching up of late
registrants at the end of the dav.
