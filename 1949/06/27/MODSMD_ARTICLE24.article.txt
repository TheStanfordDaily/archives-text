# Hot Jazz Society To Hold First Meeting Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford Hot Jazz Society
will hold its first meeting of the
quarter tonight in the Nitery at
8 o'clock.
The program for the evening will
include a history of the Lu Watters
Yerba Buena Jazz Band, presented
with recorded examples of its mu
sic by Fred league, past president
of the club, and some private re
cordings of the King Riverbottom
Mud and George Probert bands.
The society open to new mem
bers who are interested in Ameri
can instrumental folk music, pri
marily New Orleans and Dixieland
jazz. Be-bop fans will find little
they enjoy in the organization that,
according to Teague, "caters espe
cially to 'moldy figs'."
If enough interested jazz fans
show up for the meeting, they will
be continued through the summer.
Plans will be made tonight for any
future meetings and events.
