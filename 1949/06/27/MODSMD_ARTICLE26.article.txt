# IFC Penalizes Three Houses
## 
### 
"Inappropriate handling" of spring
quarter all-campus dances caused
{social restrictions for next year to
| be imposed on Phi Gamma Delta,
S Sigma Nu, and Phi Psi fraternities
iby Interfraternity Council at its
final meeting last quarter.
These houses will not be permit
ted to give all - campus dances,
i whether held on or off the campus,
j unless the affairs are requested by
three alumni members of the house
concerned. The same alumni and
j their wives will be required to at
! tend the dance, supervise it, and
| make a written report on its con
duct.
Dean of Students Lawrence
Kimpton pointed out that no fine or
| other penalty was laid on the fra
ternities, but that IFC merely felt
that the dances as conducted were
i "inappropriate for the campus."
"This ruling does not apply, how-
I ever, to closed affairs," Kimpton
said.
