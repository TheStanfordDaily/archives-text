loss to humanity.

public servant.
In 1929, Dr. Wilbur took leave of absence from Stanford to

become Secretary of the Interior ■
for his former classmate, Herbert
Hoover. His four - term was
highlighted by his determined ef
forts toward conservation and the
preservation of local self - govern
ment.
Dr. Wilbur's conservation policy
was felt in every activity. In one
case, he made the construction
camp beside Hoover Dam a federal
city to avoid what he considered
Nevada's policies on liquor and
gambling.
As Secretary of the Interior, Dr.
Wilbur considered himself a gen
eral manager for a great absentee
landlord — the American people —
and he was determined to protect
their interests.
