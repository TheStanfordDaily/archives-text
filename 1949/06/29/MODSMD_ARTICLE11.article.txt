## Give Them Rides 
### 
We're slipping up on one of the long-established traditions of
Stanford—that of picking up students who are trying to get to
and from Paly or the Village. These remarks are made to en
lighten the new students on campus this summer who don't
know about the tradition, and to remind the old students who
seem to have forgotten.
"Pick-up" stations are the Bookstore Corner, the Oak tree
across from the history corner, and at the top of Palm Drive. At
this last corner are signs designating where the hitch-hikers are
going, to Paly or the Village.
Wilson's is the place to pick up students coming back from
town. Pick up students coming to campus from the Village by
the gate to the Village.
There are a lot of students on campus without cars—and it's
a long way to town and to the Village. So let's give them rides.
