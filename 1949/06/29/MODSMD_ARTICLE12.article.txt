# Council Officers Elected
## 
### 
Al Rosenberg was elected chair
man of summer Men's Council at
a meeting held Friday afternoon.
Elaine Arnold was named chairman
of Women's Council.
These two groups will review
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard violations throughout the
summer quarter.
Men's and Women's Councils will
meet jointly to decide upon penal
ties for Honor Code violations and
singly to judge Fundamental Stand
ard breaches, according to the new
student constitution.
The Councils function as an im
portant part of Stanford's Honor
Code. This system, which allows
students to take examinations with
out proctors, depends upon student
support and student enforcement as
one of the provisions of its adoption
years ago.
Polls Conducted
Polls conducted by the Honor
Code Standing Committee have
shown that students think the Hon
or Code has been generally success
ful. It is the hope of Men's and
Women's Councils that the honor
system will continue to function
successfully.
The Fundamental Standard con
trols student action on and off the
Stanford campus. A violation of
this standard is "conduct unbecom
ing a Stanford student." Violations
of civil law as well as breaches of
moral conduct fall under this regu
lation.
Students accused of violations of
the two principles of conduct here
at Stanford are given a trial be
fore the Councils, where they have
the right to examine all of the evi
dence presented against them. It is
the rule in Council meetings that a
student is innocent until proven
guilty.

Blue Book Pledge
It is important to note that in
i signing the Honor Code pledge on
examination blue books, the stu
dent promises that he completed the
test without giving or receiving aid.
The Honor Code applies to all work
| used as a basis for grading in the
course, including problem sets and
themes.
If a student sees another cheating
on an examination, he should first
confront the student. If this does
: not stop the action, the violator
should be reported to a member of
Men's or Women's Council.
