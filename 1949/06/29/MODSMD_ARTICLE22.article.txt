# Intramural Teams Sought by Taylor
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor, summer intra
mural manager, again requested
volleyball teams to sign with him
for a summer tournament.
Men who wish to form a team
and enter the tournament should
sign up with Taylor at the SAC.
It is hoped that Encina Ilall
will enter several teams as well as
the Row houses which are open
this summer.
In previous summer quarters,
Stanford students have bright
ened their life with intramural
play.
