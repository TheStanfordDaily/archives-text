# Madrigal Music Concert Good; Rates 'Well Done'
## 
### FRED TEAGUE 
A concert of Renaissance masterpieces was presented in
Cubberley Auditorium last Sunday night by the Madrigal Guild
under the auspices of the Friends of Music at Stanford.
The program was offered as a part of the organization's cur
rent chamber music series.
The 10-voice group, led by Mrs. Eileen Washington of Menlo

Park, was composed of Buy Area
men and women singers. When the
singing required it, Mrs. Washing
ton accompanied the group on a
lute or harpsichord. Most of the
singing was a cappella.
As the singers walked out onto
the stage, a touch of color was lent
to the affair. The costumes were of
authentic Renaissance design, and
of about two-thirds the colors of
the spectrum.
Good Voicing and Timing
Tlie show opened with a group of
English ballets and madrigals. We
were immediately impressed with
the voicing and particularly with
the fine timing that went into the
production of these spirited 17th
century compositions.
The first solo came in the second
group. Lawrence Sherrill, bass
baritone, sang well (as did succeed
ing soloists) in his rendition of a
lute song, Downland's "Awake
Sweet Love."
An intermission followed the
third set, which consisted of four
Italian numbers, the last of which,
Palestrina's '"Thee I Extol," turned
out to be the most thrilling bit of
mixed singing we have heard in a
long time.
During the intermission we had
the opportunity to exchange a few
words with Mrs. Washington, who
revealed that this Madrigal Guild is
the only one of its kind in the coun
try. There is an amateur group at
Modesto Junior College that ap
peared here last quarter in the Jun
lior College Choral Festival. She
also said that the costumes were
done by the Stagecraft Studios of
Berkeley.
The second half of the program
began with the presentation of a
bright, happy duet, "Sound the
Trumpet" by Purcell, sung by Dor
othy Ohannesian and Jean Sim
mons and accompanied on the harp
sichord by Mrs. Washington. An
other of Purcell's works, "When the
Cock Begins to Crow," was a de
lightful trio that inspired a certain
amount of giggles among the au
dience.
Folk Songs
Two folk songs, an old English
song and a Marienlied, followed
these. Both were sung with the
competence that was evident
throughout the evening.
'London Street Cries'
The final song of the affair was
a fantasy called "London Street
Cries" by Gibbons. It represented
many of the cries of the street mer
chants of the 17th century, from the
town crier to a Bedlam beggar. The
action was arranged by Dr. Mar
gery Bailey.
On the whole there were no out
standing performances except that
of Mrs. Washington. This is because
each singer contributed an equal
amount to the success of the Guild.
It was teamwork; a rather platitu
dinous way of putting it, but accu
rate.
