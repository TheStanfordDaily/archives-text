# Dr. Spiegelberg Stranded Abroad
## 
### 
Professor Frederic Spiegelberg of
Asiatic and Slavic Studies is in Ho
nolulu. He doesn't want to be, but
he is, and there's no getting around
it.
On his return trip from his stud
ies in Tibet and India, his ship
stopped over at the Hawaiian sea
port and has been there ever since.
A waterfront tieup is to blame.
Realizing that the extenuating
circumstances would bo likely to
slow the progress of his classes, Dr.
Spiegelberg enclosed enough as
signments in a letter to his wife to
keep the class going until Friday
when, the American President
Lines' office claims, his ship will
come in.
The professor's travels, made
possible by a Rockefeller travel
gfrant designed to send scholars to
the countries of their interests, took
him first to India, where he met in
teresting people, studied Indian
culture and philosophies, and spent
some time at the Benares Hindu
University.
From India he went to Tibet, a
land of ancient and mysterious cul
ture. He visited a lamasery there
and delved into the culture and
studied the Tibetans' language.
Whe asked if her husband could
n't get back any sooner, Mrs. Spie
gelberg commented that "my hus
band isn't that good a swimmer."
