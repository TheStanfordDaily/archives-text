# Betas to Live Off-Campus
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi house will be
closed during the 1949 fall
quarter as a penalty for viola
tion of University regulations,
Walt Varellas, chairman of the
Interfraternity Board, said yes
terday.
The penalty, approved by Dean
of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton,
was imposed after the fraternity
served champagne at its dance May
27 in the chapter house.
The penalty will go into effect
with the opening of fall quarter and
will terminate the last day of finals
in December. It will not affect the
open houses and rushing scheduled
for winter quarter.
This is the second penalty to be
imposed on the Betas for spring
quarter activities.
The fraternity was fined $50 in
May for an off-campus party for
which the house did not secure
ASSU permission or have adequate
chaperonage. At the same time Phi
Gamma Delta was fined $100 and
Delta Kappa Epsilon $50 for similar
offenses. The Deke and Beta fines
were for a party given jointly by
the two houses.
The Chi Psi house, not Phi Psi as
was stated in the Monday Daily,
was among fraternities penalized by
social restrictions for the 1949-50
academic year.
