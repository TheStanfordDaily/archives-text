### 
An illustrated lecture on "Balin
ese Character" by Gregory Bate
son. noted British anthropologist,
inaugurated the summer quarter
Tuesday Evening Series last night
in Memorial Hall.
Professor Bateson showed films
of material presented in the book,
"Balinese Character," which he
wrote in 1942 in collaboration with
his wife, Margaret Mead, also a
tamed anthropologist of the peoples
of the South Pacific region. The
films included shots of parent-child
relationships and Balinese ritual
and dance.
The anthropologist contended that
"out of the specific frustrations of
Balinese frustrations of Balinese
childhood, a character is formed
which is non-competitive, rich in
artistic fantasy, and so oriented to
ward other people as to impose
similar frustration on the next gen
eration."
Professor Bateson was educated
at St. John's College, Cambridge,
and in 1938 was elected William
Wyse Scholar at Cambridge Uni
versity. He has spent many years
in research work among the peo
ples on New Guinea, Bali, and Ga
lapagos.
During the war Professor Bateson
served for two years with the Of
fice of Strategic Services. He has
been a visiting professor at the New
School for Social Research in New
York City, Columbia University,
Harvard, and most recently a lec
turer in medical anthropology at
the Langley Porter Clinic of the
University of California.
