Dr. Sterling's Tribute
In his tribute, Dr. Sterling said,
"It is given to few men to live a
life so full and influential as was
that of Ray Lyman Wilbur."
Dr. Sterling added, "Whether the
issue was to cure sickness and re
duce disease, to care for the Indian,
to advance the cause of child wel
fare, to conserve this country's nat
ural endowment, to broaden the
bases of understanding among na
tions, or to train the minds of young
men and young women, Ray Lyman
Wilbur's effort was directed toward
the realization of higher 'Human
Hopes'."
Dr. Trueblood, in his address,
said, "Dr. Wilbur believed in us
and there was something about the
fact that he believed in us that
made many of us rise to greater
heights than we would otherwise
have been capable of achieving.
There are not many truly great men
in the world but there are a few,
and when they appear, they per
form many services, but perhaps
the noblest service that they per
form is that they keep alive the
faith in the hearts of other men."
