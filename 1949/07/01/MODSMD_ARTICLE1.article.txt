## 
### 
The Social Committee, third
highest student government bu
reau, met for the first time of
the quarter last Wednesday.
The first things discussed, of
course, were the purposes and
functions of the committee. With
these formalities out of the way the
Soc Com got down to business.
A number of social events that
are definitely on the slate for the
quarter were mentioned. Among
these were the co - recreational
swimming plan, the big Lagunita
open house on July 8, an all-cam
pus barbecue, and the regular Wed
nesday afternoon social feature, the
Stay-a-While.
Committees Appointed
Committees were appointed to
handle the open house and the first
Stay-a-While. The Lag affair com
mittee consists of Lou Constantine,
chairman; Anne Fraser, co-chair
man; and Lou Fischl, co-chairman.
The committee that will see to
the first Stay-a-While consists of
Chuck Hirsh, chairman, and Veron
ica Szego, co-chairman.
"The Lagunita open house will
be an all - campus affair and we
would like to have as many students
as possible there," said Lois Croon
quist, ASSU vice-president.
Hal Richards' Band
Hal Richards' band will furnish
the music for the dance. Hal has
recorded for Decca and has played
in the Sir Francis Drake Persian
Room and more recently at Russian
River.
The Stay - a - While, a weekly
event, was inaugurated two quar
ters ago. The Soc Com feels that it
is the type of get-together that will
'appeal to the average student."
Miss Croonquist made a point of
insisting that women should feel
free to come alone to the affair.
There will be free doughnuts and
cider, and music for dancing.
Hosts and hostesses of the Stay
a-While will be the members of the
Soc Com.
