## Dead or Alive? 
### 
Will we see you alive on July five?
We will if you slow down and take it easy over this three-day
Fourth of July holiday.
Whether you are cutting that afternoon lab or waiting around !
until the cool hours of evening or early morning to drive to Los
Angeles or Lake Tahoe, plan your trip in advance to avoid fatigue
and hurry.
By staying physically and mentally alert and keeping your
speed down, you will be helping to keep yourself and your
passengers alive. Remember, it is wiser to arrive a little late
than not at all.
There will be an estimated 33,000,000 other automobile drivers
on the road with you, all of whom are planning to spend the ,
"Fourth" at some vacation spot, not in some roadside burial plot.
Each Independence Day holiday an unprecedented toll of death,
injury, and property damage are exacted on California high
ways.
Make it your personal responsibility to drive with courtesy
and caution.
Be sure your car is in good condition, giving special attention
to the safety featuresâ€”brakes, lights, tires, and horn.
Make the coming July Fourth holiday a day to be remembered
not a day on which you will be remembered.
We'll see you on campus Tuesday.
