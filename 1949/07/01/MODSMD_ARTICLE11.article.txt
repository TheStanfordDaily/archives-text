It is hard to say which is the more dangerous starting point of this
policy—the assumption that war is inevitable or the idea that war is
impossible. A substantial section of European opinion is convinced that
the United States has swung from the extreme of optimism on this issue
to the extreme of pessimism.
These observers are alarmed at some of the statements made by officials
and military leaders to push through our rearmament program as they
were dismayed by the lightning speed-of our demobilization and reconver
sion the instant the shooting stopped.
One of our costliest illusions was the belief that war was over and
peace was safe as soon as the Germans and the Japanese surrendered. We
know now that much that has happened since could have been prevented
if the United States had kept its forces in being until the post-war world
was organized.
As the only other country emerging from the fray with great reserves
of strength, it is mostly our fault that the Red Army remained as the
only visible force in the power vacuum of Europe. Our disarmament is
also the irrefutable answer to Soviet charges, repeated again in the May
Day slogans in Moscow, that American imperialism planned and is insti
gating a.new war.
But talk of inevitable war is equally reckless. A policy that proceeds
from the premise that conflict cannot be avoided is not directed to the
harder task of avoiding it. It is not a policy of statesmanship but of fatal
ism and panic. There is all the difference in the world between preparing
to fight because a fight is in the offiing and accumulating forces as a means
of discouraging aggression and averting war. In the latter case strength is
the support and instrument of political and diplomatic action.
"Inevitable war" is the theme of Soviet propaganda, for home con
sumption and the subjugation of the satellites; actually the present contest
is political and our theme is that it can be and is being won by political
means, backed by, but not geared to. visible reserves of military force. Far
lrom being unavoidable, shooting war can and will be averted by victory
in the political field.
