rolled under the GI Bill of Rights
will not get their monthly checks
on schedule this month.
The San Francisco Area office of
the Veterans Administration an

would be due to a one per cent
error in estimating the amount of
money needed to see the program

The VA said the $48.000..000 error
will leave 500.000 veterans through
