## 
### 
More than 100 Certified Public Accountants from all over
California have been meeting on campus since Wednesday for
a graduate accounting study conference. Today is the last day
of the conference.
The conference is sponsored by the California Society of Cer-

tilled Public Accountants, the - "
American Institute of Accountants,
and the Stanford Graduate School
of Business.
"The failure of free enterprise to
explain and sell itself is its great
est weakness."
This was the keynote of the ad
dress given Wednesday by Maurice
H. Stans of Chicago. 111.
Stans called for the accountants
to make an all-out attack on the
public's "economic illiteracy."
"The dissatisfactions (with de
mocracy) which exist internally arc
the result of a lack of general
knowledge of how our free enter
prise economy has grown, how it
works, and the benefits it produces,"
he declared.
The earning rates of many cor
porations are greatly exaggerated
under present accounting methods,
William A. Pa ton, professor of ac
counting in the School of Business
Administration at the University of
Michigan, said to the conferees yes
terday.
"With overstated earnings and
understated resources, the earning
rates of many corporations are
greatly exaggerated.
"This is a serious matter in a
time when business is being widely
criticized for making 'excessive
profits' and earnings of stockhold
ers as reported—sometimes before
taxes —are being compared with the
incomes of other groups in our so
ciety."
