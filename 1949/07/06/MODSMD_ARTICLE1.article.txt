MAROONED ON AN ISLANDâ€”Peggy Frazier, 5, and her brother Pat, 3, put away a large meal in the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Keith Wickes of Jordan, N.Y. The children were found by the YVickes on a desolate island in
tbe Seneca River where they had been abandoned by their father, Donald Frazier, three days before. They
were hungry, exhausted, and insect-bitten.
