Has it ever occurred to you that many a man realizes late in life that
ii when he was a boy he had known what he knows now, instead of being
what he is he might be what he won't; but how few boys stop to think that
if they knew what they don't know instead of being what they will be,
they wouldn't be? These aren't good thoughts.
I was planning to be a millionaire but something happened and I
couldn't get a-hold of a million dollars, or a million much of anything
else, for that matter. That disqualified me.
1 thought ways of earning the million. One that appealed
to me was song writing. Some song writers don't even work any more and
they are getting paid for songs they wrote years ago. Even the ones that
work couldn't find it very hard, just putting dots on lined paper. I thought
I'd give it a whirl.
I tried writing chamber music first but my girl put an end to that. I
couldn't find a chamber for low enough rent, anyway.
This drove me to writing popular tunes. I was an immediate success.
Some of my tunes will probably be immortal. Take "When It's Straw
berry Time in Normandy, I'll Come Back and Get Rash With You" or
"1 Fell Through the Mattress So I Could Meet You in the Spring." Maybe
you would rather not take them.
Those were both jazzy numbers. I also wrote ballads. How's this—
"I Had to Get All My Clothes Altered Since I Got You Under My Skin"?
This music writing got me in with the music crowd, but solid, man!
(I never did get very good at speaking their language.) I took up the
trombone in my spare time but I wasn't cut out for it so I let it slide.
After I had made quite a pile in the music game, I decided go to
school and be a music major. 1 looked in the catalogue of a Peninsula
university. One of the courses listed was Music 131.
This was apparently a course in conducting. I once knew a conductor.
He was quite a conductor. His last job was as conductor in a piece of high
voltage furniture at state expense. This convinced me to be an Ed major
like everyone else.
This entailed becoming educated but that isn't too hard once you get
the hang of it and an I.D. card. Some of the most informative seminars are
held in places located on the roads behind the campus or at a place called
Belt's.

This music writing got me in with the music crowd, but solid, man!
(I never did get very good at speaking their language.) I took up the
trombone in my spare time but I wasn't cut out for it so I let it slide.
After I had made quite a pile in the music game, I decided go to
school and be a music major. 1 looked in the catalogue of a Peninsula
university. One of the courses listed was Music 131.
This was apparently a course in conducting. I once knew a conductor.
He was quite a conductor. His last job was as conductor in a piece of high
voltage furniture at state expense. This convinced me to be an Ed major
like everyone else.
This entailed becoming educated but that isn't too hard once you get
the hang of it and an I.D. card. Some of the most informative seminars are
held in places located on the roads behind the campus or at a place called
Belt's.
