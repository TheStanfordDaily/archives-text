ines." said Jessica Tandy, star of

Uanford July 21st.
Also on the campus for rehearsals
vhich are now in their second week,
•s Akim Tamirov, who plays the
•art of the irascible General Erosa
bout whom the play revolves.
Mr. Tamirov, looking somewhat
liratical in his striped blazer at the
mie of his interview, is particularly
'ell suited for the part by reason of
is previous roles. For eight years
member of the acting company of
ie Moscow Art Theatre, Mr. Tami
)V's first role was that of the cat
) Materlinck's "The Blue Bird."
"It was unusual," he said, "for me
> get the part when I was only
ghteen. I didn't like it ton well, for
was acting with my teachers."
Coming to New York in 1923. Mr.
amirov continued for two years
ith the Moscow Ait Theatre, but
rmained in the United States with
ichard Bleslovsky, Leo Boulgakoft'
ho later produced "One Sunday
fternoon," Olga Balkinova, and
aria Ospenskva. "I joined Balieff's
hauve Souris", and then when I
uned English sufficiently. I played
a number of Broadway produc
ms. mostly flops, including Guild
leatre's 'Miracle of Verdun' ", said
r. Tamirov.
Under contract then for Pc'ra
>unt. he starred in films, including
or Whom the Bell Tolls." "The
•neral Died at Dawn," and "Dragon
ed." and was nominated for the
ademy Award for his work in
? first two pictures. Last winter i
\ Tamirov appeared in "Judg
•nt Day" at the Pasadena Play
use and in "I Remember Mama"
the New Orleans Theatre Guild.
'I was very pleased when Mr.
»nyn asked me to play the part
General Erosa." Akim Tamirov
d, "for I consider it to be the
it part I have ever done."
What I like about the part of
is Graves," sai l Miss Tandy, "is

. that it has so many shades of char
' acter. As a matter of fact, all of the
characters are so real, they are in
dividuals. And everything has such
overtones of comedy, that I like it
particularly."
Miss Tandy, who played Blanche
Dubois in Tennessee Williams' "A
Streetcar Named Desire" for eight
een months on Broadway, looks like
a Stanford freshman and speaks
rather precisely. For her work as
Blanche, Miss Tandy was given the
Clitics Award for the best perform
ance of the 1947-1948 season.
Previous to that. Miss Tandy
played in England, with John Gei
guld as Cordelia in "King Lear,"
as Miranda in "The Tempest," and
with Laurence Olivier as Viola in
i "Twelfth Night." and Katherine in
' "Henry V."
On the Stanford campus for the
first time, Jessica Tandy is enjoying
it a great deal. "I'm very grateful
i for the opportunities here. The
equipment is excellent and every
one is so helpful and co-operative."
When asked how she felt about
working with amateurs, referring
to the students who make up a
large part of the cast. Miss Tandy
appeared puzzled. "I never thought
of them as amateurs. In every play
I there are beginners."
In addition to her theatrical work.
Miss T tndy has enjoyed an excel
lent reputation as a movie actress.
In "The Green Years. Miss Tandy
had the odd position of playing her
husband's daughter, for she played
with Hume Cronyn, who is direct
ing "Now I Lay Me Down to
Sleep."
Cronyn. as well known an actor
as his wife is an actress, has ap
peared in "The Green Years." "The
Postman Always Rings Twice," and
"A Letter for Evie" On Broad
way, Mr. Cronyn has had leading
roles in "Three Men on a Horse"
and "Room Service." Recently, he
has prepared the screen plays for
Hitchcock of "Rope" and "Under
Capricorn." which are to be re
leased this fall.
