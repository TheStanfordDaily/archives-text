						Case for Crew Suffers a Setback; there's Still Hope for the Sliding Seals 
### 
7he argument for establishing crew as a major sport at Stanford has
1 weakened considerably by the crewmen's tenth-place finish at
ghkeepsie.
Jefore the fateful race the Card oarsmen had maneuvered themselves
a very favorable position. The story of the orphan crew which had
lired funds for a Poughkeepsie trip on its own had aroused the sym
iy of the Bay Area sports scribes and many inches were written prais- j
the gallant efforts of the struggling Stanford crew.
it Poughkeepsie everyone was pulling for the Indians and the experts
>ed them for fil'tji place. The set-up was ideal; the stage was set for
finish to a perfect success story.
t come-through performance by the crewmen at this point would have j
red major sport status and possible financial support from the Uni
ity.
lut their poor showing has temporarily put the damper on their dream
lock "S's" and helped to relieve the pressure on the University.
vS it turned out the venture was not a complete failure since the boys J
ived a lot of good publicity. But the punch ending was missing, and ;
jarsmen may have to wait a long while for such a golden opportunity j
resent itself again.
lton, Feldman, Gregg May Save Mounrl StaiT
he Seals may yet be able to finish in the first division and thus save a
hi which has so far been characterized by ineptness.
itching has been O'Doul's big problem, and the hurling staff is in the !
■ss of being bolstered. Big Cliff Melton, who has been sidelined since i
first week of the season with a broken ankle, should be ready to
t again within the next few weeks. Melton is steady and reliable and
>m fails to go the distance.
he addition of Hank Feldman and Hal Gregg should eventually pay
Feldman jumped to the Mexican League several years ago and was
ltly reinstated. He pitched for the Giants during the war, but when
>lew Yorkers failed to offer him satisfactory terms, he signed .with the.
al Gregg of World Series fame was obtained in the Bill Werle deal
the Pirates. He joined the Seals two weeks ago. He's a fast ball
er but a little wild.
oth Gregg and Feldman are badly out of shape, but it's nothing a little
won't cure. They have proved their worth in the major leagues and
should have no trouble winning in the PCL.
t any rate, these three could furnish the pitching consistency which
eded to pull the O'Doulmen out of the hole.
Rasclii Could Hit 30-Game Mark
us year's major league campaign may provide that rarity known
30-game winner in the person of Vic Raschi, the New York Yankee
id ace.
ischi, who used to perform for the Portland Beavers, now has 13
; ies to his credit, and the season is not yet half over. If he continues
present pace, he has a good chance of hitting the 30-game mark,
le prevailing system of handling pitchers makes a 30-game winner
ically non existent in modern day baseball. In the early days pitchers
Christy Mathewson and Cy Young used to win 30 or more games a
n and think nothing of it.
le average pitcher of today needs at least four days of rest between
liuents and seldom starts more than 40 games a year.
Ie likes of Mathewson and Young, on the other hand, could pitch
other day during tke week and then pitch both games of a double
•r on Sunday.
