# Council Finds Three Guilty Of Honor Code Infractions
## 
### 
Three persons were found guilty of violating the Honor Code
in spring guarter final examinations at a joint meeting of Men's
and Women's Councils.
One person was accused of copying a translation behind a
barricaded door in Encina Hall. Apparent lack of knowledge of

the course both before and after
taking the examination by this per
son was sufficient to indicate his
guilt.
By unanimous vote, the Councils
decided to suspend the accused for
summer, fall, and winter quarters.
The second case which came up
before the Councils involved two
persons who collaborated on an Eco
nomics 80 final examination. Com
parison of blue books, in which
both had the same incorrect an
swers, was sufficient to indicate
their gui'.t to the Councils.
Suspended Fall Quarter
These two persons were suspend
ed for fall quarter, 1949.
Men's and Women's Councils are
anxious to explain the difference of
severity in the two cases before it.
The violator in the first case is
known among the members of his
class os a habitual offender. His
violation was flagrant disregard of
the privileges enjoyed under the
Honor Code system.
The second case involed several
difficult and extenuating circum
stances. The usual practice in a
case of its type would be to suspend
the violators for fall and summer
quarters. However, one of the vio
lators had intended to attend sum
mer quarter, while the other had
not. Suspension for both quarters
would therefore work a hardship
on one and not the other.
Council Avoids Discrimination
The Councils hesitated to sus
pend one violator for summer quar
ter and the other for fall quarter

because summer quarter is usually
not regarded as one from which
suspension is a real penalty.
Furthermore, one violator intends
to enter Stanford Law School in
1950. It is necessary for him to
complete three more quarters be
fore he may do so, and he must
have completed these by June, 1950.
Therefore, a two - quarter suspen
sion would have worked undue
hardship upon him.
With the above complications in
mind, the Councils recommended
that the two violators be suspended
fall quarter 1949, but be allowed to
attend this summer.
