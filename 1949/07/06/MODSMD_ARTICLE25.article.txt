# Strikebound Spiegelberg Returns from Asia Trip
## 
### 
In spite of being unexpectedly marooned in Honolulu by a
wildcat strike while returning to the United States, Professor
Frederic Spiegelberg is back in his Asiatic and Slavic Studies
classes on the Stanford campus today.
The Rockefeller Study Grants scholar whose researches took

him to Tibet, India, Siam, China, and
Japan brought with him 450 color
photographs of Asiatic life and
customs which he plans to use for
illustrated class lectures.
Thirty-five paintings by con
temporary Indian artists acquired
by Professor Spiegelberg will be
shown at the Stanford Art Gallery
and later at other American colleges.
Professor Spiegelberg expressed
liis amazement at the difference be
tween Eastern and Western modes
of living and described China as a
hard-working country in contrast to
the feeling of leaning backward
prevalent in India and the European
atmosphere in Japan. Much of his
time was spent in studying philos
ophy.
While in Bangok the Siamese
Ministry of Information arranged
for him to spend a full week at a
Buddhist monastery.
Professor Spiegelberg feels that
his first trip to the Orient, although
only six months in duration, has
given him new viewpoints which
will make him "a better American
citizen."
