# Von Pagenhardt To Study Abroad
## 
### 
Bob von Pagenhardt, former
president of the lIR, will be leav
ing soon on a European trip of
study.
As winner of a Stanford scholar
ship he will serve as a United Na
tions intern at the UN from Mon
day to Sept. 7. He will go from
there to France for a year of study.
In Paris he will take the part of
a part-time representative of the
Hoover Institute. At the same time
he will be studying international
relations at the French school, L'E
cole des Hautes Etudes Internatio
nales. This school is, according to
von Pagenhardt, "the highest of its
sort in Europe."
While in Europe he will take an
expense-paid journey to Berlin to
the Free School there.
When as president of the lIR Von
Pagenhardt sent a number of bun
dles to Berlin last year, he appar
ently made a lasting impression on
the school. He was sent a scroll
signed by the heads of the faculty
and "Aussenreserat" (comparable to
Stanford's ASSU) inviting him to
their university to be their guest
and a representative of Stanford.
The Berlin Free School, which he
will visit for three days to a week,
was established in the British sec
tor in spite of much negative pres
sure exerted by the old university,
which is located in the Russian part
of Berlin and is Red-controlled.
After his studies Von Pagenhardt
will return to the University. In the
meantime he will send to The Daily
from time to time photographs and
letters pertinent to student life, af
lairs. and government in Europe.
