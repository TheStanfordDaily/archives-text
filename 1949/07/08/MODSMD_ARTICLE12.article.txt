# Fire Department Summoned Twice
## 
### 
Stanford's five department was
called out for only two minor fired
this week, both of which were
brought under control quickly.
The first came Saturday at 12:31
p.m. on the Galantine ranch at
Foothill and Arastradero Road. A
lire started on the top of a stack of
3,000 bales of hay and destroyed 13
bales before put out.
