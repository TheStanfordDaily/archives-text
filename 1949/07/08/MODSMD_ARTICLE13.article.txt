## Bull Session 
### 
Some people say that all my jokes are old. (Ed. note: Some people are
right. so right.) Well, just to establish this fact. I'll let you in on the oldest
joke known to man.
This crack originated in the Garden of Eden when Eve asked Adam,
' What's wrong about eating this apple?" and Adam answered, "I'll bite."
These trivia out of the way, we'll continue. You know, Encina Com
mons is a remarkable place. Residents of Crothers, Toyon, and Encina
eat there.
When I lived in Encina I always sat at the same table. The first night
I was there a little guy came in and sat down at the end of the table.
A French student sat down opposite him and smiled, "Bon appetit."
Not to be outdone, the little fellow (Ginsberg, by name) smiled and
said, "Ginsberg."
This performance continued for the entire quarter, and just before the
last meal Ginsberg confided to me. "I'm glad the quarter's ending—I'm
sick of this Bon Appetit guy."
I pointed out that bon appetit was a French expression meaning, "I
wsh you a pleasant meal."
When the French student came in Ginsberg stood up. made a deep
bow, and said. "Bon appetit."
The French lad smiled and murmured. "Ginsberg."
(I'd. note: Punch line next week.)

I went over to see my girl on the Fourth of July but her roommate
answered the buzzer and said she was upstairs waving her hair. I still
don't know why she couldn't afford a flag.

Some of my friends call me a reactionary, just because I favor the
gold standard. America once had the greatest supply of gold per capita
in the world. The citizens had it in their teeth. All this changed in the
depression when the capitalists lost their teeth.
I number a good many dentists among my friends and all of them are
for the gold standard. Anyway, who ever heard of a dentist filling teeth
with dollar bills.
