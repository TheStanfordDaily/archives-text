To the Editor:
Your editorial on the "Stanford Pick-up" reassures us old fossils that
the Farm has not yet degenerated into a typcal university. Now couldn't
you make the summer complete by running an editorial on "Hello' ?
It is so disconcerting to pass a lone student on an otherwise idle path,
to greet him with one's most open and genial "Hello" and to have him
respond with only a preoccupied grunt or a foreign "Oh. haow dew yuh
dew?"
One indoctrinated by the "roughs" of 1920 can't stomach that sort of
stuff. What would an old-timer think! Tradition bears the disapproba
tion of the enlightened intelligentsia. I know.
Fluff to all that sort of talk. Let's enjoy the humanizing advantages
of the good. old. hearty and hopelessly traditional Stanford "Hello."
JUST AN "OLD RETURNING STUDENT"
