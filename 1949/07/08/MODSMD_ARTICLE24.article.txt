## The 						Sports Desk We Have a Neighboring College Which Is Doing things in Sports 
### 
Although this paper is supposed to be carrying a cardinal flag, and
praising the Indian teams at every chance, it is of more than passing in
terest to look a tew miles southward and scan the athletic record of San
Jose State College.
This school at the very foot of the Peninsula—in the heart of the Santa
Clara Valley, as a matter of fact—deserves watching. The blue-and-gold
clad Spartans are doing things in sports.
Ihe enrollment at SJ State is neai ly as much as it is here at Stanford
in the three regular quarters. The school is not as old, of course, and the
campus is not as large. They don't have our traditions and history. But
they do have teams.
Yesterday, a release came to our desk from the SJ State Athletic News
Bureau. The director, Danny Hill, said: "San Jose State teams have
completed their most successful athletic year since the founding of the
institution. The 14 teams which represented ihe Washington Square school
accounted for 11 different championships." That is impressive, even in
the small-school California Collegiate Athletic Association.
Spartans Swepl Grid and Diamond
San Jose's football, basketball, baseball, track, golf, boxing, and gym
nastics teams all won CCAA titles.
In football, San Jose won 9 and lost 3, tying none. The Spartans lost
to the Indians here in the season opener last year, only by a freak touch
down when Stanford tackle Jack McKittrick swiped the ball from the !
State quarterback and carried it across the line to score. The Spartans
scored 373 points in these twelve games, a new high for them and not a
bad total for anyone.
The SJ State diamondmen won 19, lost 10, and tied one to capture the
league pennant. The basketballers won 22 and lost 13, tying none, to win
their second crown in that sport. The team finished third in the
NC2A tourney.
San Jose Won Third Track Crown
The Spartan trackmen won 4 and lost 2 meets, and brought home their
third CCAA title from the oval. The golf team, which won the NC2A at
Stanford last year, won their league with 11 wins and no losses. The
Staters placed in fifth place at Ames, lowa, this year.*
It is also interesting to see that San Jose State held the first intercolle
giate judo tournament last year. Of course, the Spartans also won this
event. They didn't mention the extent of the competition.
As a total in all encounters, in all 14 events, the SJ State men won 116,
lost 55. and tied 5. Those are the statistics. Watch the teams next year
for action.
