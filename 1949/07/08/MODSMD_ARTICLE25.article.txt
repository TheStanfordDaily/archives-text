NEW YORK, July 7 (.-P). —The
Cleveland Indians continued their
comeback surge in the American

8 to 2 victory over the Chicago
White Sox, the sixth Cleveland win
in seven games.
This may be it—that belated In

pions have been promising tor more
than a month.
Bob Lemon, a 20 - game winner
last season, got off to a shaky start
in the game at Chicago today. He
gave up five hits in the first two
innings. But then he caught hold
and allowed only four the rest of
the way for his ninth triumph of
this year.
The Indians meanwhile collected
17 off three White Sox pitchers. A
four-run rally, including a triple
by Bob Lemon and doubles by Lou
Bgudreau and Larry Doby, settled
the issue in the fourth inning.

telli's two-run double gave Pitts
burgh a 2 to 0 victory over the St.
Louis Cardinals. It was the second
win in a row for the Pirates over
the Cards, and dropped the St.
Louis club to a game and a half

away from first-place Brooklyn.
The win, too. was the eighth out
| of nine games for the Pirates, their
sixth in a row.
Ernie Bonham held the Cards to
j six hits for his fifth win in a row.
Only one Card reached third base.
The Pirate runs came in the sixth
: when Clyde McCullough singled,
Pete Casriglione singled and then :
Restelli's double against the left j
! field screen sent both home.

i victory over the Chicago Cubs at
