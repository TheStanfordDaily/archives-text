# UCLA, USC Grid To Be Televised
## 
### 
UCLA and USC have signed with
KECA-TV in Los Angeles to tele
cast their 1949 home games. This
is in the line of an experiment to
sec how televising will cut down
gate receipts.
As yet, Stanford has made no ar
rangements to have its eight home
games sent to receivers outside of
the stadium.
The PCC gave individual school 3
permission to contract individually
with television stations to cover
home games. Colleges and univer
sities all over the country have
wondered whether such a move
would decrease the turns of the
turnstiles. The two southern schools
will be able to give the answer.
