READY FOR DEBUT—The Southern Pacific's new Shasta Daylight will begin 15½-hour service Sunday
between San Francisco and Portland, three hours faster than the fastest previous train over the 718-mile
scenic Shasta route. Twin streamliners will operate the route, leaving San Francisco and Portland daily.
They were constructed at a cost of more than live million dollars.
