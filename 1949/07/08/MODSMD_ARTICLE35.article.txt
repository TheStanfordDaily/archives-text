# Self-Service Plan For Libe Renewals
## 
### 
j The self-service system has been
extended from the grocery store
into the Stanford library in the
form of renewal slips which the
student fills out and drops into a
box at the circulation desk.
Begun in the summer quarter, the
new system allows students to by
] pass the line-up to renew books,
j The slips are collected from the
; circulation desk and processed by
j the library assistants. If there is a

prior claim on a book, the student j
is notified that the book is not re- 1
newable and is requested to return !
it as soon as possible.
"The system also permits 'mail- J
order' renewals for those who have j
thoughtfully provided themselves
with a supply of the renewal forms j
and not used the backs of them for j
scratch paper," commented F. J. j
Priddle, head of the circulation di- j
vision.
