# 'Dramatic Vigor' Marks Opening of Ibsen Classic
## 
### CHUCK MILLER 
Bringing to the Studio Theater stage one of Ibsen's greatest
dramas, the Stanford Players opened their summer season Wed
nesday night with "Hedda Gabler."
This first production of the play to be given at Stanford showed
throughout a meticulously planned and executed harmony be-

♦'tween spectacle, story, and acting.
Such a blending of the various parts
is a difficult thing to achieve in any
play with the social and psychologi
cal implications that are found in
"Hedda Gabler." And yet a seem
ingly flawless combination of these
parts was produced to give the play
a dramatic vigor that was sponta
neous and realistic from the open
ing to the final curtain.
-Marcia Wilson Convincing 1
Marcia Wilson gave a convincing
portrayal of the life of a selfish and
| bored woman who, in trying to
| mitigate her own wretchedness in
a constricting society, draws into
the Vortex of unhappiness and dis
aster the others who stand in her
way. Necessary to the part, Miss
Wilson displayed an adroit ability
to change when confronted with
each personality in the little orbit
which surrounded her.
The comfortable staidness of
George Tesman's home was not
what she had hoped for. And the
kind, pedantic and slightly pitiable
Tesman. played with equal skill and
comprehension by Haran, could not
give her the livery that she wanted.
Stock Plays Expertly
Morgan Stock as the family friend
and counselor. Judge Brack, played
with professional adroitness the
part of a man in control of the sit
uation at every point and who
proved himself to be equal to Hed
da's machinations.
Thea Elvsted. played by Beatrice
Blau, was the soul who is lost with
out a purpose in life. A fragile and
round-?yed creature, she gave that
impression admirably as a rival to
Hedda for influence over Loveborg,
a rising young writer.
Casting (iood
The equally as good casting of
Duane Heath, the promising writer,
of Nancy Langston as Miss Jusiana
Tesman. George's aunt, and of Bar
bara Haran as Berta. the Tesman
maid, was evidence ot' Miss Mac-
Naught's ability to interpret the dif
ficult parts in Ibsen's play, directing
anil relying at once upon an expe
rienced group to come through with
a dramatic, fully convincing pro
duction.
Even the 1890 living room set.
designed by artist -in - residence
Joan Hacket. had a deep blue tone
that was subordinated to the mood
of the pl?y. The period costumes of
Jane Cannon contributde as well to
that same mood of somberness. of a
quiet 'hat was unnerving to the
bored Hedda. •

Stock Plays Expertly

with professional adroitness the
part of a man in control of the sit
uation at every point and who
proved himself to be equal to Hed

Thea Elvsted. played by Beatrice
Blau, was the soul who is lost with
out a purpose in life. A fragile and
round-?yed creature, she gave that
impression admirably as a rival to
Hedda for influence over Loveborg,
a rising young writer.

Bringing to the Studio Theater stage one of Ibsen's greatest
dramas, the Stanford Players opened their summer season Wed
nesday night with "Hedda Gabler."
This first production of the play to be given at Stanford showed
throughout a meticulously planned and executed harmony be-

♦'tween spectacle, story, and acting.
Such a blending of the various parts
is a difficult thing to achieve in any
play with the social and psychologi
cal implications that are found in
"Hedda Gabler." And yet a seem
ingly flawless combination of these
parts was produced to give the play
a dramatic vigor that was sponta
neous and realistic from the open
ing to the final curtain.
