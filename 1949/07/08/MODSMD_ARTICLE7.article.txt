# Shortened PO Lines Planned
## 
### 
The long general delivery lines
at the Post Oflice will soon be
shortened, John J. Callahan, Post
Office superintendent, announced
yesterday.
The change will be made possible
by making available for rent 40 per
cent of the boxes from July 10 to
July 20.
Students may rent a box during
the summer quarter for prices
ranging from $1 to $3, according to
the size desired. Since the quarter
is already under way, a fraction of
a quarter's rent will be dedvicted,
depending on the time the box is
rented.
Every day a few boxes are va
cated, so that by July 20 all stu
dents wishing boxes will be able to
procure them.
Those wishing to continue hold
ing letter boxes during the fall
quarter may do so by rent payment
for the quarter a few days in ad
vance.
Mail deliveries come into Stan
ford Post Office eight times daily,
from 5:30 a.m. until 6 p.m., and dis
patches are picked up until 7 p.m.
While the staff is short-handed
because of summer vacations, the
turn-over has produced a tremen
dous amount of work. Over four
thousand change-of-address cards
were vised this quarter.
'Still," Callahan smiled, "every
body's been very co-operative."
