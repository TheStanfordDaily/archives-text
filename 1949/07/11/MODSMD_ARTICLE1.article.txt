# Expressionistic Dancing On Tuesday Series Slate
## 
### 
A recital of modern, expressional dances will be given by
Miss Karen Burt on the Tuesday Evening Series at Stanford
tomorrow night.
A member of the University's summer quarter faculty, Miss
Burt will present a varied program of dances, several of them

experimental in form and combining
movement with drama.
The program, which will begin at j
8 o'clock in Memorial Hall, is pre- |
sented by the Stanford Committee I
on Public Exercises and is open to
the public without charge.
Miss Burt, assistant professor of j
physical education at Pomona Col- |
lege, has studied under such leading j
modern dance teachers as Martha j
Graham, Charles Weidman, Car- j
melita Maracci. and Doris Hum- j
phrey.
She will be assisted in the dance j
program by Mrs. Marianne Thomp- j
sSn, accompanist, wife of Victor K. :
Thompson, Stanford assistant pro
fessor of art; and two singers, Ger- !
lie Williams and John Miller, both
members of the Stanford Opera j
Workshop. Mrs. Thompson will play
several piano solos.
The recital will open with a
group of folk songs presented by
the singers to piano accompaniment
and interpreted by Miss Burt's i
dancing.
Her next dance will be a pre
classic form, the Pavane, done in a
modern manner. This dance, called
'"a sinister figure," will put into
dance form the essence of the
cruelty of the inquisition period, or
of any other period in which power
is used for evil purposes.
Other features of the program will
include "Obsession." in which Miss
Burt will give a dance interpretation
of the ridiculousness of obsessions,
and "Woman With Broom," a num
ber symbolic of traditions and hav
ing nothing to do. Miss Burt com
ments, with either witches or sweep
ing.
One of the novel numbers on the
program is an experimental dance
in which Miss Burt will recite ex
cerpts from T. S. Eliot's "The Hol
low Men" while interpreting the
words in dance movements.
The most lyrical number in the
recital will be "Earth Song," in
which the dancing will symbolize
the child-like quality of primitive
people, and their joy and awe of
the forces of nature.
The closing number and one of
the most unusual of the program
will be an experimental dance,
"Chreo - Jabberwocky," involving
pantomime, dancing, and use of al
literative word images to tell the
story of a "wacky" housewife who
gets involved in four or five projects
at once until the complexity of the
situation overwhelms her.

The recital will open with a
group of folk songs presented by
the singers to piano accompaniment
and interpreted by Miss Burt's i
dancing.
Her next dance will be a pre
classic form, the Pavane, done in a
modern manner. This dance, called
'"a sinister figure," will put into
dance form the essence of the
cruelty of the inquisition period, or
of any other period in which power
is used for evil purposes.
Other features of the program will
include "Obsession." in which Miss
Burt will give a dance interpretation
of the ridiculousness of obsessions,
and "Woman With Broom," a num
ber symbolic of traditions and hav
ing nothing to do. Miss Burt com
ments, with either witches or sweep
ing.
One of the novel numbers on the
program is an experimental dance
in which Miss Burt will recite ex
cerpts from T. S. Eliot's "The Hol
low Men" while interpreting the
words in dance movements.
The most lyrical number in the
recital will be "Earth Song," in
which the dancing will symbolize
the child-like quality of primitive
people, and their joy and awe of
the forces of nature.
The closing number and one of
the most unusual of the program
will be an experimental dance,
"Chreo - Jabberwocky," involving
pantomime, dancing, and use of al
literative word images to tell the
story of a "wacky" housewife who
gets involved in four or five projects
at once until the complexity of the
situation overwhelms her.
