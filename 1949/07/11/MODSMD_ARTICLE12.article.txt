Wilfred Painter of the U.S. Navy
were killed, and 10 other per
sons, including Col. and Mrs.
Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Jr.,
Philadelphia socialites, were in
jured yesterday in a yacht ex
plosion.
The 38-foot cabin cruiser ''Hal
cyon" blew up while taking on gaso
line at the dock of the Corinthian
Yacht Club on the Potomac River
I waterfront. The dead and most of
the injured were blown into the
shallow water near the dock.
Biddle, who suffered only minor
, injuries, dived into the water and
recovered Prichard's body and then
helped put it aboard a rescue craft.
Neither Biddle, nor his wife, Mar
garet. required hospital treatment.
The others injured were:
Mrs. Charlotte Prichard, wife of
, the Army public relations director,
who had been chatting with the
Biddies in the bow of the boat when
the blast occurred.
Navy Capt. S. N. Ferris Luboshez
who is in critical condition at the
Bethesda, Md., Naval Medical Cen
ter suffering from shock and multi
i pie fractures of the right leg.
| Cmdr. H. A. Dudley, U.S. Naval
' Reserve, who was treated for shock
, and cuts on the right leg at the Ana
i costia Naval Air Station.

Johannes Johannesen, steward of
the yacht club, who suffered third
degree burns over the upper part
of his body. He was taken to Cas
ualty Hospital.
Thomas L. Miller, 23-year-old
skipper of the "Halcyon," who was
treated for first, second, and third
degree burns.
Two men who were on the dock
watching the Halcyon refuel also
were slightly injured and were
treated by firemen at the scene.
They were Hardwood Martin. 40, and
Victor Niebes, 22.
The explosion rocked the water
front but did no damage to the yacht
club or to other craft anchored in
the basin. The Halcyon was wrecked
and settled quickly to the bottom,
her burned superstructure jutting
above the water.
The explosion occurred at 1:45
p.m. (EDT). soon after the "Hal
cyon" docked at the yacht club to
take on gasoline,
Mrs. Biddle told the United Press
there was a terrific explosion as she
and Mrs. Prichard were sitting to
gether in the bow.
"My husband tells me I pulled
Mrs. Prichard into the water with
me to keep her from being injured in
case the gasoline pump did explode,"
she said.
The boat started sinking almost
immediately, she said, and within 90
seconds had listed sharply enough to
throw the women into the water. It
sank moments later, its flag still
flying.
Harbor police speculated that
gasoline fumes accumulated in the
hold of the cruiser during refueling
and were touched off by a spark.
