WASHINGTON. July 10 (UP).—Rep. Harold H. Velde, R., 111.,
charged today that Federal Judge Samuel F. Kaufman showed
"bias bordering on judicial misconduct" in favor of Alger Hiss
at the latter's perjury trial in New York.
Citing six instances of alleged "impropriety," he said in a

statement that it is "obvious" an
investigation of the judge's conduct
"cannot be sidestepped."
Velde, a former judge and ex-
FBI agent, was the second member
of the House Committee on Un-
American Activities to call for a
probe of Kaufman's handling of the
Hiss case, which resulted in a hung
jury. Rep. Richard M. Nixon, R.,
Cal., is the other.
In addition to the six 'flagrant"
examples he cited, Velde said Judge
Kaufman was also guilty of "gross
impropriety" for leaning down and
shaking hands with U.S. Supreme
Court Justices Felix Frankfurter
and Stanley F. Reed when they ap
peared as character witnesses for
Hiss, a former high State Depart
ment official. He said that gesture,
made before the jury, "could only
be prejudicial to the prosecution
and helpful to Hiss."
Velde's statement brought sharp
rejoinders from Robert P. Patter
son, former Secretary of War and
president of the Bar Association of
New York City, and Chairman
Emanuel Ccller, D„ N.Y., of the
House Judiciary Committee.
