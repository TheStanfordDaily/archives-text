## Honor and Then Some 
### 
The aim of a university is not merely to make knowledge
available to its students, but more important, to give its students
a chance to develop into responsible individuals. Knowledge
means very little if it is used unwisely.
The Honor Code is Stanford's way of teaching its students to
grow up and accept responsibility. The Honor Code is as im
portant a part of life on the Farm as classes, fooiball games, or
dances. Maybe more important.
Briefly, the Honor Code means:
L. No unpermitted aid is to be given or received for any exami
nation, paper, project, or any other assigned work.
2. All library rules shall be observed.
3. Identical material shall not be turned in for two courses
without the instructor's knowledge.
But the Honor Code is more than a list of "dont's." It is, rather,
r feeling of social and individual responsibility. It is not some
thing to be "got around" if possible, but to be lived up to
Lecause it is believed in.
Many students coming from other schools are used to getting
by with as much as they can without getting caught. At Stanford,
the Honor Code is taken seriously by both students and instruc
tors. Penalties are severe for those who break the Honor Code.
But more important than the stigma of being caught and being
failed in the course or being expelled from school is the break
down of responsibility within the student that can harm only
himself.
