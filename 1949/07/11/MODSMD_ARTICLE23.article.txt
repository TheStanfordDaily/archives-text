A current-events column presumes to see in the passing maelstrom of
particular events on relations which will be of some service to significant
understanding. But the chief obstacle here is that reflections concerning
currents events are apt to consist mostly of reflections concerning current
prejudices.
The confusion in popular thought regarding the "state of the world" is
readily understandable when one surveys the semantic morass which
t asses as "information for an enlightened citizenry." The prevalence of
one- and two-valued orientations makes communication difficult and
clear conversation well-nigh impossible.
The current Socialist Menace, of which our Russians brothers are the
archetype, is a case in point. Every means at the disposal of an ingenious
ttchnology (even to a direct appeal to the good Lord) as mobilized to
the effect of convincing us that all Socialists, all Russians, all Communists,
112 ave filled the place abdicated by His Satanic Majesty, of recent fame.
To people trained to inhibit the initial sneer, even cursory reflection
will find it necessary to differentiate the Red Bogey into two modern
jjc-cial characteristics.
The first is the great proliferation of popular revolutions in this century.
The leveling-up of the masses may be regarded as caused by a combi
nation of Christianity and technology, or some other way. What the
American citizen should realize is that these vast social upheavals are
j'eing to continue. Apoplectic speeches and guns are no solution.
As more and more people become p6litically conscious, they will identify
with the collective ego on the next higher level. This suggests the second
characteristic: Nationalism. The present groups of nation-states, from
the Ivory Tower, give no pleasanter analogy than a collection of mad dogs.
Still the myth of Autonomous Destiny exists. Therefore, we must deal
with it.
Dealing with national governments is somewhat less "humanitarian" in
concept. It will involve, along with the United Nations and World Bank,
a certain amount of economic intimidation and military suggestion. This
tecause may nations have not developed to the point of voluntary co
cperation. Such manipulations are fraught with constant danger.
The limited analysis of the world configuration automatically suggests
n number of ameliorative and constructive courses of action. On the
<.trier hand, calling Russia the modern anti-Christ suggests nothing but
war. The only alternative is whether to fight now or later.
The first challenge in understanding human affairs, then, is one of
iemantic orientation. For we are a highly verbalized people who are
t dlessly manipulated for the specific purposes and prejudices of others.
The responsible citizen will develop an automatic distrust of the care-
Icss use of words. He will realize that the generalities in common use
(democracy, socialism, faith, Red, peace-loving, etc.) mean nothing when
• nsidered apart from a specific situation. They are defined by their vise
—not by rock-like absolute meanings which shoulder up the corners of
Creation.
One will realize, for instance, that "democracy" may be blueberry pie
cj. the right to vote to an American, land to a starving Hungarian peasant,
;i convenient projection for the pent-up hate and resentment of an
•j.xlonesian, and a dozen other thigns to someone else.
To formulate a problem correctly is to be halfway toward the solution.
Few people today are able to avoid unthinking identification with indis
criminate group ideas. Most are confused by the ambiguous abstractions
of world statesmen—that trade-union of sober buffoons.
Therefore, it falls to the lot of university-trained men and women to
use their wider knowledge and trained minds for the clarification of
public action. Their ability to deal with many-sided problems as such
makes them indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the evolution
of the race.
