## Bull Session 
### 
If this were a democratic setup we would quit trying to be funny and
go back to reading proof and reporting the Hot Jazz Society. A letter
has even been written to the Editor with the post script:
"P.S. I think the Bull Session is lousy."
This is all our fault. We try too hard or something. Well, the fella
who wrote the letter (you can read it in the Letters to the Editor) seems
to be quite a guy. He is a J.C. transfer. Possibly that makes him good.
At least it should make him impervious to any ignorance, however slight,
he will find around here.
Ohâ€”don't think we don't know what a Junior College is like. The only
difference between the average Junior College and a high school is that
there are some potential university students at high schools.
The average junior college is full of rah-rah boys who are too lazy
to go to work and too stupid to go to college. The women are usually
either too incompetent to get a job, too ugly to get a husband, or don't
like to study. Then there are the children of the wealthy that somehow
convinced their elders that going to a JC is the same as going to college.
It isn't, and there's no getting around it.

Abraham Lincoln was quite a guy. He coined a pretty phrase when
he said "You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the
people some of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the
time."
He must have been referring to some of the local bartenders who are
cutting their stuff so much that even the drinks aren't fooled. At one
place the Irish whisky was so thin that it mixed with some Scotch. Some
places are so cheap that the straight drinks are half shot, and mixed
drinks are nothing but a good old-fashioned soda chaser.
There is no reason to change the subject except that it wasn't very
good to start with.
