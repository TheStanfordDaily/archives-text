# Water Reserves Still Subnormal
## 
### 
"This has been an exceptionally
dry year," Alf E. Brandon, Uni
versity business manager, stated
last week. Even though rain fell
this year at very opportune times,
the total rainfall was almost six
inches under normal.
The University water supply is
better than it was last year, how
ever, Brandon said. This condition
is due to the water rationing pro
gram in effect last year.
Water for the campus is stored in
Felt and Searsville lakes. "The
heavy rain period was extended
over a sufficient length of time to
allow us to fill both lakes," Brandon
said.
There arc 30 million more gallons
in the two lakes than there were
last year at this time. This repre
sents water requirements for two
or three weeks.
"The University is taking steps to
see that no water is wasted in irri
gating the campus grounds," Bran
don said.
The administration is asking nil
campus residents to be careful in
their use of water.
Stanford is supplementing its wa
ter supply by pumping from domes
tic water wells. If the water tabic
does not drop too rapidly, there will
be no water rationing this year,
Brandon added.
