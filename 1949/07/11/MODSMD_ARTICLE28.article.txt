# Bemelmans Tells a Tale Most Whimsical But Sage, of Gen. Erosa's Unique Saga
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
"NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO
SLEEP." Ludwig Bemelmans,
Viking Press, New York.
} "General Leonidas Erosa was in
i many ways the stepchild of life.
He lived in fear of attacks of the
grand mal. he was near-sighted and
j given to long stretches of melancho
lia and lonesomeness. But small fa-
I vors had been granted him."
A far-sighted ancestor had left
him an estate in Ecuador surround
ed by the biggest herd of beefsteaks
that ever stood around looking ex-
I pensive. He owned a villa in Biar
ritz only somewhat smaller than the
Yankee Stadium. For his attacks of
J epilepsy he had a silent Indian to
j wrestle him "back to life." For his
! near-sightedness he had the "close,
! compliant comforts" of Senora Lo
| pez (they called each other "chi
j cken" and "swit-hart"). For his
melancholy he had his food—and
oh. such food — served up irregu
! iarly by a lovable old French cook
I who annually rolled the General for
: more francs than the food originally
cost. For his loneliness he had the
inimitable Miss Graves, an English
governess whom he had fished from
the Seine in 1012. Miss Graves al
ways carried a coffin en tour to
which she periodically attempted to
relegate herself. For all things else
J —the constant, annoying torments
I of life, ho had the beloved Plaschke,
his Polish valet. And for these serv
ices the General was appropriately
grateful. When the Senora, during
I a foul mood, suggests she would
l love to spit in someone's face, the
General orders a face for the lady
: to spit in."
He Sees the World
"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep"
is the story of the General's migra

tion, with his menagerie, from the
French Riviera, just before the in
vasion of France, to the family es
tates in Ecuador, via Casablanca
and New York. En route, the Gen
eral becomes involved with a bar
tender who barks like a dog when
anyone says "psst" at him, an ami
able German nymphomaniac, a
couple of salamanders, an escaped
murderer, and any number of ships'
captains, minor officials, tourists,
and odd-ball refugees.
He finally arrives in Ecuador, be
comes eventually established in his
palatial estate, idly fathers an il
legitimate son, when he is suddently
dispatched, after an earthquake, by
way of an cpileptic attack while
unattended in his bath. The final
irony occurs when the soul of the
General comes back across the
"bridge of life" to inhabit the body
of his fcbout-to-be-born son.
Reviewer Says He's Wrong
If this resume of Ludwig Bemel
mans' fine novel appears a little
cockeycd, the fault is with the re
viewer not with Bemelmans. Mr.
Bemelmans is frequently bizarre,
but never, never is he cockeyed. As
one reviewer says, there is plenty
of whimsy in Bemelmans' writing,
but it is the whimsy of \Visdom
rather than of self - indulgence.
When Bemelmans portrays an ec
centric, it is an act of love and
understanding, and not because the
eccentric gives him a chance to ex
hibit his powers of fancy. The real
root of humor-—always a serious
thing—is in him.
Bemelmans' Success Revealed
Carlyle once wrote that true hu
mor springs more from the heart
than from the head; its essence is
love. In this love and affectionate
wisdom for his characters lies Be
melmans' success. To understand

the General one must realize that,
j besides being hilariously droll, he
is essentially a sad and child-like
; old man. Despite his enormous
J wealth, despite (or perhaps because
i of) the assortment of subordinates
j who have always pampered him, he
!is emotionally a little boy. The
: ironic side of the portrait is his
i turning for warmth and protection
to Miss Graves (an apparent sub
! limation of his mother), who is as
[ much of a child as the General. To
i each other the two cling, surround-
I ed by the tragi-comic circumstances
! of an adult civilization gone crazy,
j from which children, like walking
on the grass, have been abolished.
Stanford Stage Adaptation
Bemelmans' novel is funny; in
j fact, funny as hell. But to get
! nothing more than a superior laugh
; from the frantic didoes of the weird
| Bemelmansian characters is to get
I little from Bemelmans.
The book has recently been
turned into a play by Elaine Ryan,
| a scenarist and screen playwright
j of no mean ability, and will be pre
| sented in its maiden performance.
I under the direction of Hume Cro
| nyn. at Stanford on July 21, 22, and
!2. It is offered in all seriousness
j that Mr. Cronyn and company have
their work cut out for them. To
! successfully telescope onto a stage
| a novel which meanders, by artis
| tic fits and starts, half-way around
j (he world involves some admirable
j skill in production. To portray the
adept characterizations of Bemel
j mans' figures, a large part of whose
| charm lies in their well - timed
} speechlessness, will require first
rate acting. And to capture the
states of mind, the flavor of the
Bemelsian world demands the high
; est type of adaptation. At all odds,
the results will be worth seeing. •
