# Tower Carillon Memorial To Hoover's Peace Work
## 
### FRED TEAGUE 
As an overflow crowd witnessed the graduation of the Class
oi 49, the music of Stanford's carillon rang out over the campus.
There is a story behind the carillonâ€”a story of the service of
cne man to a nation and of the welding of strong international ties.
An inscription in the Hoover Library describes the carillon:

''The carillon of thirty-five bells*
;:i this tower was originally cast by
Marcel Michiels in Tournai, Bel- j
pum, for the Belgian Pavilion at
;he New York World's Fair. The
carillon is a gift to Stanford Univer
sity from the Belgian American Ed
ucational Foundation, with which
. re associated the Belgian univer
ses and educational foundations,
recipients of endowment funds from
:he Commission for Relief in Bel- ;
. ium .1914-1919. Dedicated on June.
:0. 1941."
Story Dates to World War I
The story behind the bells begins
a August, 1914, witli the ringing
t a telephone bell. An American
consul in London, near the end of ;
his rope, was calling a young Stan
ford graduate.
At the time, thousands of Ameri
cans were stranded without funds, !
friends, or food in a Europe ablaze !
with war. The Stanford grad, Her
bert Hoover, was called in to help
send them home.
He handled this task with dis
patch and precision and as a con- i
sequence was awarded an even more j
difficult job, the administration of j
relief to the peoples of Belgium and
Northern France. This aid was be- j
gun during the dark days of the i
war and continued through there- j
construction of Belgium's devas- j
tated towns and universities. A
strong bond was created between
the people of the Low Countries j
and America.
Belgians Donate Bells
As a memorial of Hoover's great
services, the Belgian people have
civen this carillon to Stanford.
For centuries the Low Countries
had been a land of singing towers.
These towers with their bells rang
out the song of peace and demo
cratic spirit. What could be more
fitting for the Library on War, Rev
olution, and Peace than this set of
bells?
As the inky blackness of Nazism
swept over Belgium during the
more recent war, her historic ca
rillons were melted into cannon.
Nevertheless, their spirit rings out
ver the Stanford campus.
Played by Student
The carillon was played every
weekend by James Lawson until he
"ett the campus some time ago to
study in Belgium. It is now only
occasionally played by a student
earillonneur, Ray Sanders.
During the Commencement ex
orcises of the Class of '49, a staff
member had the pleasure of watch
ing Ray play the bells. Midway in
the first number the wire that plays
the F bell broke.
The member's hobby is music.
This was his big chance. He rushed
up ho the observation platform
where the carillon superstructure
is located, climbed into the maze
of bells, and repaired the broken
wire while the music poured forth.
Distance Beneficial
At that range, however, it wasn't
music. That is why he takes it upon
himself to offer the advice: "Recitals
ore best heard from a distance of
500 feet or more."
This is Important, for the second
,rv tones blur at a closer range.
The listener would do well to select
.. quiet place with an unobstructed
view of the tower.
