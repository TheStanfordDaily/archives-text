# MAJOR LEAGUE ROUNDUP
## Cards Cut Dodgers' Lead; Red Sox Down A's Twice 
### 
NEW YORK, July 10 (UP) â€”Harry Brecheen and Alpha Brazle,
a pair of slender southpaws, cut the Brooklyn Dodgers' National
League lead to half a game today as they pitched the St. Louis
Cardinals to a dual win over the Cincinnati Reds.
Brecheen, scattering 11 hits in the opener, scored a 4 to 2

triumph in the opener for his sixth
win of the season, while Brazle
hurled the Redbirds to a 7 to 4
triumph in the nightcap for his
eighth personal conquest.
Dodgers' Lead Cut
The two Cardinal victories cut
Brooklyn's lead to a bare half
game despite the Dodgers' 7 to 3
verdict over the New York Giants.
Erv Palica, Brooklyn's ace fireman,
limited the Giants to one hit in
three innings after Preacher Roe
was removed for a pinch-hitter n
the sixth. Sheldon Jones started
for the Giants, gave way to Andy
Hansen in the third, and Hansen
was charged with the loss.
Pittsburgh's eight - game winning
streak came to an abrupt end when
Chicago beat the Pirates twice, 8 to
G and 9 to G. The nightcap was
called at the end of six innings
because of Pennsylvania's Sunday
curfew law. Phil Cavarretta helped
Bob Rush to his seventh triumph in
the opener with a single, double
and two triples off Bob Chesnes.
Ralph Kiner hit his 22nd and 23rd
home runs for the Buccaneers.
Chipman Wins
In the nightcap. Bob Chipman
registered his sixth victory al
though he required help from Doyle
Lade and Walt Dubiel. Hank
Sauer's 15th homer with two on
in the first inning off Bill Werle
nd Frank Gustine's fourth homer
with one on, gave Chipman a five
run cushion.
In the American League, the Red
Sox stretched their winning streak
to seven straight by beating the
Philadelphia A's twice, 8 to 5 and
11 to 10. Ellis Kinder, although
touched for two homers by Sam
Chapman and another by Hank
Majeski, notched his ninth victory,
thanks largely to Dom DiMaggio's
three-run homer.
Williams Homers
In the nightcap, shortened to sev
er, and a half innings because of
c rkness, the Red Sox scored seven

runs in the opening frame and nev
er were headed although the A's
were coming fast at the finish. Be
spectacled Walt Masterson started
for Boston and was succeeded by
Tex Hughson in the second. Hugh
son gained the victory. Ted Wil
liams and Majeski each hit homers.
Bob Feller staggered to his sixth
victory by hurling Cleveland to a
7 to 4 win over the Browns in a
game held to six innings by rain.
The scheduled second game was
postponed because of rain. Two ho
mers by Jack Graham accounted for
all the Brownie runs. Ned Garver
was the loser.
Yankees Rained Out
The Chicago White Sox topped
the Tigers, 4 to 2, in the first game
but Detroit captured the nightcap,
1 to 0. Bill Wight gained the ver
dict over Hal Newhouser in the
opener. Art Houtteman was the
winner in the nightcap, scattering
four hits. Randy Gumpert, the loser,
yielded c.nly two hits. Detroit's only
run came in the first frame on Pat
Mullin's walk and Vic Wertz' double
down the right field line.
Washington and the league-lead
ing New York Yankees, scheduled
for a twin bill, were rained out.
