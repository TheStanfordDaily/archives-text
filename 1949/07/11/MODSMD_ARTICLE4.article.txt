# Buddhist 'Dik Cha' Discovered By Stanford's Dr. Spiegelberg
## 
### 
The previously unknown prophe
cies oi' a famous Indian philoso
pher will become known to the
world because a Stanford professor
needed some blankets to protect
him from the bitter cold of a trip
into the interior of Tibet.
This was disclosed yesterday by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, member
of the Stanford Asiatic and Slavic
Studies faculty, who recently re
turned from a six-month trip, fi
nanced by a Rockefeller Founda
tion grant, in which he visited re
mote Tibetan lamaseries high in
the Himalayas.
The valuable manuscript, written
in gold and silver on black paper,
fell from the blankets displayed to
the Stanford scholar by a Tibetan
peddler who had just returned from
Lhasa, a famed lamasery in central
Tibet.
Dr. Spiegelberg bought the need
ed blankets and also the manu
script. which was written nearly
2.000 years ago and is a copy of a
hitherto unknown book written in
the first century A.D. by Najcr
juna. great Buddhist philosopher.
The title of the book is *'Dik Cha."
which can be translated roughly as
"Exposure of Evil.
Penned in classical Tibetan, the
book predicts the downfall ol mor
als and manners intimes to come,
which Najerjuna describes a.s "the
black ages."
Planned to Bury Book
The Buddhist philosopher wr»to

that he planned to bury the book
'under a lion-shaped rock," so that
'it would be hidden and found
again only when the dark age was
at its worst and only a few still

cared ''or truth and the upholding J
of law."
Presumably, Dr. Spiegelberg sur
mises, the book was dug up* by j
Lhasa monks. The introduction
states that it was copied by a lama
by order of the relatives of a
woman who had died, and for the
benefit of whose soul the manu- j
script was produced.
Dr. Spiegelberg spent two weeks,
with the help of a learned lama !
from Lh;isa. making a rough trans
lation of the manuscript into Ens- '
lish, and he is now busily at work j
preparing a more polished transla- i
tion.
Finding of the rare manuscript i
was but one of the highlights of a i
trip which took the Stanford expert
on Oriental philosophies and reli
gions into Tibetan monasteries sel
dom visited by white men.
Once, through deliberate misdi
rection by a malicious native, he
was lost for 18 hours in the rugged
Indian mountains. He was finally
found by a searching party of his
own servants.
Monkeys and "Amazons" were
two of the other hazards he faced
on his horseback trip into the Hi
malayas.
Dr. Spiegelberg is voluble on the
subject of Tibetan monkeys and
their habit of rolling boulders down
hillsides in a bit of "monkey busi
| ne&>" which creates unusual haz
j aids for the unwary travelers. Thev


FREDERICK SPIEGELBERfi. a
Stanford professor. just returned
front a Tibetan expedition, where
lie found an ancient Buddhist
manuscript of sjreat value.
