# Buddhist 'Dik Cha' Discovered By Stanford's Dr. Spiegelberg
## 
### 
The previously unknown prophe
cies oi' a famous Indian philoso
pher will become known to the
world because a Stanford professor
needed some blankets to protect
him from the bitter cold of a trip
into the interior of Tibet.
This was disclosed yesterday by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, member
of the Stanford Asiatic and Slavic
Studies faculty, who recently re
turned from a six-month trip, fi
nanced by a Rockefeller Founda
tion grant, in which he visited re
mote Tibetan lamaseries high in
the Himalayas.
The valuable manuscript, written
in gold and silver on black paper,
fell from the blankets displayed to
the Stanford scholar by a Tibetan
peddler who had just returned from
Lhasa, a famed lamasery in central
Tibet.
Dr. Spiegelberg bought the need
ed blankets and also the manu
script. which was written nearly
2.000 years ago and is a copy of a
hitherto unknown book written in
the first century A.D. by Najcr
juna. great Buddhist philosopher.
The title of the book is *'Dik Cha."
which can be translated roughly as
"Exposure of Evil.
Penned in classical Tibetan, the
book predicts the downfall ol mor
als and manners intimes to come,
which Najerjuna describes a.s "the
black ages."
Planned to Bury Book
The Buddhist philosopher wr»to

that he planned to bury the book
'under a lion-shaped rock," so that
'it would be hidden and found
again only when the dark age was
at its worst and only a few still

cared ''or truth and the upholding J
of law."
Presumably, Dr. Spiegelberg sur
mises, the book was dug up* by j
Lhasa monks. The introduction
states that it was copied by a lama
by order of the relatives of a
woman who had died, and for the
benefit of whose soul the manu- j
script was produced.
Dr. Spiegelberg spent two weeks,
with the help of a learned lama !
from Lh;isa. making a rough trans
lation of the manuscript into Ens- '
lish, and he is now busily at work j
preparing a more polished transla- i
tion.
Finding of the rare manuscript i
was but one of the highlights of a i
trip which took the Stanford expert
on Oriental philosophies and reli
gions into Tibetan monasteries sel
dom visited by white men.
Once, through deliberate misdi
rection by a malicious native, he
was lost for 18 hours in the rugged
Indian mountains. He was finally
found by a searching party of his
own servants.
Monkeys and "Amazons" were
two of the other hazards he faced
on his horseback trip into the Hi
malayas.
Dr. Spiegelberg is voluble on the
subject of Tibetan monkeys and
their habit of rolling boulders down
hillsides in a bit of "monkey busi
| ne&>" which creates unusual haz
j aids for the unwary travelers. Thev

supplement this mountain "war
fare" with rare ability as thieves,
and dart even into homes to snatch
any available food and make a
lightning-like getaway.
Amazons in Nepal
As to the "Amazons," the scholar
returned convinced that in Nepal, at
least, women are the stronger sex.
Natives warned him against fem
inine magic in Nepalese villages,
where the women are said to be
able to transform men into goats—
a feat, Dr. Spiegelberg' wryly com
ments, which occasionally has West
ern parallels. Nevertheless, he did
n't visit the villages.
He did, however, see evidence of
the amazing physical strength of
the Nepalese women. Two of the
four coolies in his party were wom
en, and they were able to carry
heavy burdens with ease up steep
mountainsides. They were a great
deal more powerful physically than
the two male coolies in the group.
Dr. Spiegelberg, who is one of
the few men on the West Coast fa
miliar both with Sanskrit and Pali,
dialect of the early Buddhist scrip
tures, found that philosophical
scholarship is extremely rare among
the lamas, although they are
learned in ancient T'ibetan texts.
He suspects that, contrary to gen
eral belief, this has always been the
case, and that the true spiritual
centers of India have always been
concentrated, as they are now. in a
few "Ashrams," the Indian name
for private cultural and religious
institutions.
One of the purposes of the Stan
ford scholar's trip was to get an

answer to the question. "Is Indian '
spirituality alive today?"
He anticipated that the answer J
would be a firm "yes," but found
that a more accurate appraisal '
would be a cautious admission that
Indian spirituality is surviing. and j
that one can find it by going to a j
limited number of Ashrams.
Sees 'Day of Visibility'
The Stanford scholar was present
Feb. 21 when Sri Aurobindo held i
his "day of visibility," the one day
in the year when he emerges from
seclusion so that he may be seen ,
by pilgrims and other worshippers.
They see him for only about 10
seconds, but Dr. Spiegelberg says he
will never forget the occasion.
"The Indian saint sits motionless, )
with his wide - open, light green
eyes looking straight through you." !
he related.
The food, as in all of India, was 1
vegetarian fare, highly spiced, and !
Dr. Spiegelberg commented that !
"he less said about it the better." j
As a guest of the Indian govern- !
ment, he was granted every facility
a traveler could desire, and had j
ample opportunity to observe the j
cultural life of the country.
He found strange contrasts in this i
phase of Indian life.
There is a great separation, he
said, between the Western educa
tion typical of most of the Indian
leaders, such as Nehru, and those '
Indians who ar« not literate but
nevertheless receive a "family ed
ucation."
The Western, modernized Indians •
are the ones who are pushing the I
development of the nation through 1
service in government and politics, i
But this literate group, which is |
really the least Indian of the nation. :
forms only a small percentage of i
the population.
The rest, at all levels of the popu- j
lation, are illiterate and not anxious '
to be anything else. But they are :
brought up by their grandparents |
and parents to know the traditional |
arts of dancing, chanting, and San- 1
skrit chanting. And they receive j
fine mroal training through learn
ing the country's ancient wisdom
from mythology and legends.

Sees 'Day of Visibility'
The Stanford scholar was present
Feb. 21 when Sri Aurobindo held i
his "day of visibility," the one day
in the year when he emerges from
seclusion so that he may be seen ,
by pilgrims and other worshippers.
They see him for only about 10
seconds, but Dr. Spiegelberg says he
will never forget the occasion.
"The Indian saint sits motionless, )
with his wide - open, light green
eyes looking straight through you." !
he related.
The food, as in all of India, was 1
vegetarian fare, highly spiced, and !
Dr. Spiegelberg commented that !
"he less said about it the better." j
As a guest of the Indian govern- !
ment, he was granted every facility
a traveler could desire, and had j
ample opportunity to observe the j
cultural life of the country.
He found strange contrasts in this i
phase of Indian life.
There is a great separation, he
said, between the Western educa
tion typical of most of the Indian
leaders, such as Nehru, and those '
Indians who ar« not literate but
nevertheless receive a "family ed
ucation."
The Western, modernized Indians •
are the ones who are pushing the I
development of the nation through 1
service in government and politics, i
But this literate group, which is |
really the least Indian of the nation. :
forms only a small percentage of i
the population.
The rest, at all levels of the popu- j
lation, are illiterate and not anxious '
to be anything else. But they are :
brought up by their grandparents |
and parents to know the traditional |
arts of dancing, chanting, and San- 1
skrit chanting. And they receive j
fine mroal training through learn
ing the country's ancient wisdom
from mythology and legends.
The previously unknown prophe
cies oi' a famous Indian philoso
pher will become known to the
world because a Stanford professor
needed some blankets to protect
him from the bitter cold of a trip
into the interior of Tibet.
This was disclosed yesterday by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, member
of the Stanford Asiatic and Slavic
Studies faculty, who recently re
turned from a six-month trip, fi
nanced by a Rockefeller Founda
tion grant, in which he visited re
mote Tibetan lamaseries high in
the Himalayas.
The valuable manuscript, written
in gold and silver on black paper,
fell from the blankets displayed to
the Stanford scholar by a Tibetan
peddler who had just returned from
Lhasa, a famed lamasery in central
Tibet.
Dr. Spiegelberg bought the need
ed blankets and also the manu
script. which was written nearly
2.000 years ago and is a copy of a
hitherto unknown book written in
the first century A.D. by Najcr
juna. great Buddhist philosopher.
The title of the book is *'Dik Cha."
which can be translated roughly as
"Exposure of Evil.
Penned in classical Tibetan, the
book predicts the downfall ol mor
als and manners intimes to come,
which Najerjuna describes a.s "the
black ages."
Planned to Bury Book
The Buddhist philosopher wr»to

that he planned to bury the book
'under a lion-shaped rock," so that
'it would be hidden and found
again only when the dark age was
at its worst and only a few still

cared ''or truth and the upholding J
of law."
Presumably, Dr. Spiegelberg sur
mises, the book was dug up* by j
Lhasa monks. The introduction
states that it was copied by a lama
by order of the relatives of a
woman who had died, and for the
benefit of whose soul the manu- j
script was produced.
Dr. Spiegelberg spent two weeks,
with the help of a learned lama !
from Lh;isa. making a rough trans
lation of the manuscript into Ens- '
lish, and he is now busily at work j
preparing a more polished transla- i
tion.
Finding of the rare manuscript i
was but one of the highlights of a i
trip which took the Stanford expert
on Oriental philosophies and reli
gions into Tibetan monasteries sel
dom visited by white men.
Once, through deliberate misdi
rection by a malicious native, he
was lost for 18 hours in the rugged
Indian mountains. He was finally
found by a searching party of his
own servants.
Monkeys and "Amazons" were
two of the other hazards he faced
on his horseback trip into the Hi
malayas.
Dr. Spiegelberg is voluble on the
subject of Tibetan monkeys and
their habit of rolling boulders down
hillsides in a bit of "monkey busi
| ne&>" which creates unusual haz
j aids for the unwary travelers. Thev

supplement this mountain "war
fare" with rare ability as thieves,
and dart even into homes to snatch
any available food and make a
lightning-like getaway.
Amazons in Nepal
As to the "Amazons," the scholar
returned convinced that in Nepal, at
least, women are the stronger sex.
Natives warned him against fem
inine magic in Nepalese villages,
where the women are said to be
able to transform men into goats—
a feat, Dr. Spiegelberg' wryly com
ments, which occasionally has West
ern parallels. Nevertheless, he did
n't visit the villages.
He did, however, see evidence of
the amazing physical strength of
the Nepalese women. Two of the
four coolies in his party were wom
en, and they were able to carry
heavy burdens with ease up steep
mountainsides. They were a great
deal more powerful physically than
the two male coolies in the group.
Dr. Spiegelberg, who is one of
the few men on the West Coast fa
miliar both with Sanskrit and Pali,
dialect of the early Buddhist scrip
tures, found that philosophical
scholarship is extremely rare among
the lamas, although they are
learned in ancient T'ibetan texts.
He suspects that, contrary to gen
eral belief, this has always been the
case, and that the true spiritual
centers of India have always been
concentrated, as they are now. in a
few "Ashrams," the Indian name
for private cultural and religious
institutions.
One of the purposes of the Stan
ford scholar's trip was to get an

answer to the question. "Is Indian '
spirituality alive today?"
He anticipated that the answer J
would be a firm "yes," but found
that a more accurate appraisal '
would be a cautious admission that
Indian spirituality is surviing. and j
that one can find it by going to a j
limited number of Ashrams.

any available food and make a
lightning-like getaway.
Amazons in Nepal
As to the "Amazons," the scholar
returned convinced that in Nepal, at
least, women are the stronger sex.
Natives warned him against fem
inine magic in Nepalese villages,
where the women are said to be
able to transform men into goats—
a feat, Dr. Spiegelberg' wryly com
ments, which occasionally has West
ern parallels. Nevertheless, he did
n't visit the villages.
He did, however, see evidence of
the amazing physical strength of
the Nepalese women. Two of the
four coolies in his party were wom
en, and they were able to carry
heavy burdens with ease up steep
mountainsides. They were a great
deal more powerful physically than
the two male coolies in the group.
Dr. Spiegelberg, who is one of
the few men on the West Coast fa
miliar both with Sanskrit and Pali,
dialect of the early Buddhist scrip
tures, found that philosophical
scholarship is extremely rare among
the lamas, although they are
learned in ancient T'ibetan texts.
He suspects that, contrary to gen
eral belief, this has always been the
case, and that the true spiritual
centers of India have always been
concentrated, as they are now. in a
few "Ashrams," the Indian name
for private cultural and religious
institutions.
One of the purposes of the Stan
ford scholar's trip was to get an

answer to the question. "Is Indian '
spirituality alive today?"
He anticipated that the answer J
would be a firm "yes," but found
that a more accurate appraisal '
would be a cautious admission that
Indian spirituality is surviing. and j
that one can find it by going to a j
limited number of Ashrams.
Sees 'Day of Visibility'
The Stanford scholar was present
Feb. 21 when Sri Aurobindo held i
his "day of visibility," the one day
in the year when he emerges from
seclusion so that he may be seen ,
by pilgrims and other worshippers.
They see him for only about 10
seconds, but Dr. Spiegelberg says he
will never forget the occasion.
"The Indian saint sits motionless, )
with his wide - open, light green
eyes looking straight through you." !
he related.
The food, as in all of India, was 1
vegetarian fare, highly spiced, and !
Dr. Spiegelberg commented that !
"he less said about it the better." j
As a guest of the Indian govern- !
ment, he was granted every facility
a traveler could desire, and had j
ample opportunity to observe the j
cultural life of the country.
He found strange contrasts in this i
phase of Indian life.
There is a great separation, he
said, between the Western educa
tion typical of most of the Indian
leaders, such as Nehru, and those '
Indians who ar« not literate but
nevertheless receive a "family ed
ucation."
The Western, modernized Indians •
are the ones who are pushing the I
development of the nation through 1
service in government and politics, i
But this literate group, which is |
really the least Indian of the nation. :
forms only a small percentage of i
the population.
The rest, at all levels of the popu- j
lation, are illiterate and not anxious '
to be anything else. But they are :
brought up by their grandparents |
and parents to know the traditional |
arts of dancing, chanting, and San- 1
skrit chanting. And they receive j
fine mroal training through learn
ing the country's ancient wisdom
from mythology and legends.
The previously unknown prophe
cies oi' a famous Indian philoso
pher will become known to the
world because a Stanford professor
needed some blankets to protect
him from the bitter cold of a trip
into the interior of Tibet.
This was disclosed yesterday by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, member
of the Stanford Asiatic and Slavic
Studies faculty, who recently re
turned from a six-month trip, fi
nanced by a Rockefeller Founda
tion grant, in which he visited re
mote Tibetan lamaseries high in
the Himalayas.
The valuable manuscript, written
in gold and silver on black paper,
fell from the blankets displayed to
the Stanford scholar by a Tibetan
peddler who had just returned from
Lhasa, a famed lamasery in central
Tibet.
Dr. Spiegelberg bought the need
ed blankets and also the manu
script. which was written nearly
2.000 years ago and is a copy of a
hitherto unknown book written in
the first century A.D. by Najcr
juna. great Buddhist philosopher.
The title of the book is *'Dik Cha."
which can be translated roughly as
"Exposure of Evil.
Penned in classical Tibetan, the
book predicts the downfall ol mor
als and manners intimes to come,
which Najerjuna describes a.s "the
black ages."
Planned to Bury Book
The Buddhist philosopher wr»to

that he planned to bury the book
'under a lion-shaped rock," so that
'it would be hidden and found
again only when the dark age was
at its worst and only a few still

cared ''or truth and the upholding J
of law."
Presumably, Dr. Spiegelberg sur
mises, the book was dug up* by j
Lhasa monks. The introduction
states that it was copied by a lama
by order of the relatives of a
woman who had died, and for the
benefit of whose soul the manu- j
script was produced.
Dr. Spiegelberg spent two weeks,
with the help of a learned lama !
from Lh;isa. making a rough trans
lation of the manuscript into Ens- '
lish, and he is now busily at work j
preparing a more polished transla- i
tion.
Finding of the rare manuscript i
was but one of the highlights of a i
trip which took the Stanford expert
on Oriental philosophies and reli
gions into Tibetan monasteries sel
dom visited by white men.
Once, through deliberate misdi
rection by a malicious native, he
was lost for 18 hours in the rugged
Indian mountains. He was finally
found by a searching party of his
own servants.
Monkeys and "Amazons" were
two of the other hazards he faced
on his horseback trip into the Hi
malayas.
Dr. Spiegelberg is voluble on the
subject of Tibetan monkeys and
their habit of rolling boulders down
hillsides in a bit of "monkey busi
