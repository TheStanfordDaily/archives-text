# TOMORROW
## NL and AL Vie In All-Star Tilt 
### 
The National Leaguers will be
gunning for their first All - Star
game victory since 1944 tomorrow
when they tangle with the Ameri
can Leaguers in the sixteenth an
nual midsummer game which fea
tures the top stars from both cir
cuits.
At present the junior circuit holds
an 11-4 edge in victories, but it was
Billy Southworth, this year's Na
tional League manager, who last
steered the senior loop to victory
in 1944.
Lou Boudreau, Cleveland's ver
satile manager, will furnish the op
position, but his duties will be per
formed from the dugout since he
was not voted a spot on the All-
Star team.
The game will be played at Eb
betts Field, the home of the Dodg
ers. _Â»
The American League lineup, as
usual, will pack plenty of power
with such hitters as Ted Williams,
Dora DiMaggio, Tommy Henrich,
Joe DiMaggio, George Kell, and
Eddie Joost.
For the National League the
heavy stickmen include Johnny
Mize, Jackie Robinson, Pee - Wee
Reese. Ralph Kiner, Stan Musial,
and Willard Marshall.
