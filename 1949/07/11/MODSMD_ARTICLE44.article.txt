# Age Finally Overtakes Guild's Tsarist Triangle
## 
### 
"Katia," the current offering at the Guild Theater, which stars
Danielle Darrieux and John Loder, is a tragic example of the ease
with which a moving picture can become antiquated.
This 10-year-old French production tells the story of Tsar
Alexandre II of Russia (John Loder), his beautiful paramour

(Danielle Darrieux) and their five-*
year love affair surrounded by the
scandalized oh-ah's of a provincial
court given to scandalized oh-ahings
and the high jinks of a bunch of
spoil-sport revolutionaries. The
Czar meets Katia on one of his
tours about Russia, and is properly
smitten.
Courtship Violence
Their courtship continues when
the Czar visits Katia's seminary and
snatches her off to a sleigh ride while
the school matrons sit home around
the fire wishing they could have
their tea, Czar or no Czar. Katia
ds shortly presented at court and
makes an impression when the Czar,
in her honor, introduces that racy
dance, the waltz, to the court.
Remorseful, Katia goes off to
France only to have the Czar bring
her back after his visit to the Paris
Exposition of 18G7. Whereupon the
Czarina, a truly pathetic figure, !
providently dies and leaves the field
clear. Alexandre marries Katia and j
is about to have her crowned Cazrina |
when he is nailed (after several ;
previous attempts) by a revolu
tionist's bomb.
Rebels Heave Bomb
The irony: Under the influence of
the liberal Katia, the Czar is about
to declare Russia a constitutional
state when the revolutionaries,
goaded by the propaganda of some
reactionary ministers who are not !
hot for constitutions, toss their bomb.
We spoke of '"Katia" as being a
tragic example of an antiquated pic
ture; the tragedy is that such dated
ness is largely unavoidable and that
these particular stars deserve a
better fate.
The picture was made in 1939.
Since that time the whole process of
movie making has been revolution
ized.
Disjointed Sequences
For example, "Katia" is presented
in more or less disjointed sequences
unjoined by musical bridges or con
tinuity of story. Much of the action
is set before fluctuating pre-photo
graphed scenes. The voices, even in
the most dramatic moments come
out in the same reedy waver, punc
tuated only occasionally by a blast
of music calculated to draw attention
from the east side of the Bay. Part
of the difficulty lies in attempting to
compress five years of novel into 90
minutes of film.
But principally the blame belongs
o the oldness of the picture and the
lifliculties of presenting pictures re
corded for European machines on
~;ven the best of American equip
ment. As a result, the picture
ioesn't quite hang together. The
sound track voices tend to destroy
the dramatic effect and the sketchy
tableaux in attempting to tell too
nuch end by telling too little. The
-esult is the effect of large gaps in
•he action and continuity, and what
is worse, large gaps in the emotional
development.
Darrieux Superior
However, the picture, despite these
remarks, has some fine moments.
Danielle Darrieux, who has more
ibility in her little finger than the
irtificial likes of most Hollywood
actresses, is given a chance to exhibit
her sense of humor, her mobile face,
and the happy combination of slim
legs, brown eyes, and golden hair.
One scene, in which she expresses
her disapproval of the Czar by
stomping the daylights out of some
transplanted jasmines is superb.

-esult is the effect of large gaps in
•he action and continuity, and what
is worse, large gaps in the emotional
development.
Darrieux Superior
However, the picture, despite these
remarks, has some fine moments.
Danielle Darrieux, who has more
ibility in her little finger than the
irtificial likes of most Hollywood
actresses, is given a chance to exhibit
her sense of humor, her mobile face,
and the happy combination of slim
legs, brown eyes, and golden hair.
One scene, in which she expresses
her disapproval of the Czar by
stomping the daylights out of some
transplanted jasmines is superb.
"Katia," the current offering at the Guild Theater, which stars
Danielle Darrieux and John Loder, is a tragic example of the ease
with which a moving picture can become antiquated.
This 10-year-old French production tells the story of Tsar
Alexandre II of Russia (John Loder), his beautiful paramour

(Danielle Darrieux) and their five-*
year love affair surrounded by the
scandalized oh-ah's of a provincial
court given to scandalized oh-ahings
and the high jinks of a bunch of
spoil-sport revolutionaries. The
Czar meets Katia on one of his
tours about Russia, and is properly
smitten.
Courtship Violence
Their courtship continues when
the Czar visits Katia's seminary and
snatches her off to a sleigh ride while
the school matrons sit home around
the fire wishing they could have
their tea, Czar or no Czar. Katia
ds shortly presented at court and
makes an impression when the Czar,
in her honor, introduces that racy
dance, the waltz, to the court.
Remorseful, Katia goes off to
France only to have the Czar bring
her back after his visit to the Paris
Exposition of 18G7. Whereupon the
Czarina, a truly pathetic figure, !
providently dies and leaves the field
clear. Alexandre marries Katia and j
is about to have her crowned Cazrina |
when he is nailed (after several ;
previous attempts) by a revolu
tionist's bomb.
Rebels Heave Bomb
The irony: Under the influence of
the liberal Katia, the Czar is about
to declare Russia a constitutional
state when the revolutionaries,
goaded by the propaganda of some
reactionary ministers who are not !
hot for constitutions, toss their bomb.
We spoke of '"Katia" as being a
tragic example of an antiquated pic
ture; the tragedy is that such dated
ness is largely unavoidable and that
these particular stars deserve a
better fate.
The picture was made in 1939.
Since that time the whole process of
movie making has been revolution
ized.
Disjointed Sequences
For example, "Katia" is presented
in more or less disjointed sequences
unjoined by musical bridges or con
tinuity of story. Much of the action
is set before fluctuating pre-photo
graphed scenes. The voices, even in
the most dramatic moments come
out in the same reedy waver, punc
tuated only occasionally by a blast
of music calculated to draw attention
from the east side of the Bay. Part
of the difficulty lies in attempting to
compress five years of novel into 90
minutes of film.
But principally the blame belongs
o the oldness of the picture and the
lifliculties of presenting pictures re
corded for European machines on
~;ven the best of American equip
ment. As a result, the picture
ioesn't quite hang together. The
sound track voices tend to destroy
the dramatic effect and the sketchy
tableaux in attempting to tell too
nuch end by telling too little. The
-esult is the effect of large gaps in
•he action and continuity, and what
is worse, large gaps in the emotional
development.
