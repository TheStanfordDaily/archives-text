"Calling all Stanford queens . . .
Report to your radios and stand by
. . . This is important!" You'll hear

Every week during summer quar- !
ter, a Stanford woman will be pre

for a Queen," a new program writ- j
ten by Ann Thomas and emcee'd by |
Lee Cushion. During the first part |
of the program, musical clues will
be given about the girl to be fea- !

fied her, the mystery will be cleared
up when she is brought to the stu
dio in Mem Aud and introduced at

The girl chosen as the first Stan
ford queen last Thursday night was
president of both Lagunita Court
