# Mediator Claims UN Aiding Peace
## 
### 
"The United Nations has
i shown that it can step in and
i stop a dangerous war threaten
ing the peace of the world and
| lead the parties to an amicable
settlement of difficulties."
: Dr. Ralph J. Bundle, acting UN
mediator in the Israel-Arab war,
i said this in an interview with The
Daily yesterday.
"Restoration of Peace in Palestine
j so far has been the result of long,
j extensive, and determined effort on
I the part of the United Nations for
a period of two years.
'The attainment of this peace has
i demonstrated that without enforce
ment machinery or a mobilized
! army the UN can stop an armed
conict.
He said the UN had demonstrated
! its ability to settle these problems
; even when the Soviet Union and
j the United States disagree, as dem
onstrated in Korea and Indonesia.
Although neither of these prob
; lems has been finally settled, he
said, the tension has lessened con-
I siderably and there is no threat to
j the peace of the world.
Concerning the Palestine situa
tion itself. Dr. Bunche said that as
soon as a Syrian-Israel armstice is
signed, his work as mediator will
be finished. Syria is the only Arab
nation that has' not signed an ar
mistice with Israel. Dr. Bunche said
he expected an agreement to be |
reached in the near future.
He said the only disagreement
holding up negotiations was on
where the armistice line—the line
separating the two forces for the pe
riod of the armistice—should be
drawn.
Work on the final peace settle
ments is being done by the Pales
line Conciliation Commission in j
Lausanne. Dr. Bunche is not work- i
ing on this commission.
The Israeli face several severe in
ternal problems, both economic and
social, said the UN mediator. Jew
ish refugees are streaming into Is
rael at the rate of 30.000 a month. >

Feeding and housing these refugees,
us well as getting them established
in work, is about the most difficult
problem that Israel has, said Dr.
Bunche.
Israel wants to build an industrial
economy, but lacks both resources
and markets.
Textiles, diamond - cutting, and
pharmaceutical Koods are its main
industries, which Israel is depend
ing on to make the country a going
concern. Israeli leaders want to
make it a self-supporting nation,
free from relying on gift capital, as
soon as possible, said Dr. Bunche.
"There s no evidence of Russian
influence on either side (Israeli or
Arab). There are evidences of in
fluence on both sides, but not Rus
sian," said Dr. Bunche.

"The United Nations has
i shown that it can step in and
i stop a dangerous war threaten
ing the peace of the world and
| lead the parties to an amicable
settlement of difficulties."
: Dr. Ralph J. Bundle, acting UN
mediator in the Israel-Arab war,
i said this in an interview with The
Daily yesterday.
"Restoration of Peace in Palestine
j so far has been the result of long,
j extensive, and determined effort on
I the part of the United Nations for
a period of two years.
'The attainment of this peace has
i demonstrated that without enforce
ment machinery or a mobilized
! army the UN can stop an armed
conict.
He said the UN had demonstrated
! its ability to settle these problems
; even when the Soviet Union and
j the United States disagree, as dem
onstrated in Korea and Indonesia.
Although neither of these prob
; lems has been finally settled, he
said, the tension has lessened con-
I siderably and there is no threat to
j the peace of the world.

tion itself. Dr. Bunche said that as
soon as a Syrian-Israel armstice is
