## Equality of Race 
### 
We had the "chance of a lifetime" the other day when we got
to talk to Dr. Ralph Bunche for about an hour and a half. The
main purpose of the interview was to get his opinion on the ac
tivities of the UN.
But when we finished that discussion we drifted into talking
about racial discrimination and prejudice. Dr. Bunche presented
a number of intelligent and clarifying ideas.
We think his opinions on the subject are valuable, and warrant
careful consideration.
"It is the inalienable right of every man to walk with dignity
in society, regardless of his race or religion," said Dr. Bunche.
Too many people talk of "tolerance" for the negro. There is
no reason to "tolerate" negroes —it is a matter of accepting them
as you would any so-called Caucasian. The negro in the United
States does not belong in any special category, but to the same
group as any other American citizen, and he deserves the right
to "walk with dignity."
Dr. Bunche said that when negroes are deprived of their rights
and privileges, "then it is the obligation of deprived people and
all those who believe in the American way of life to see to it that
this aberration is corrected as promptly as possible."
"You can't say to the negro 'be patient in the deprival of your
rights and privileges.' or 'wait for a saviour to come along, or for
a dominant group to give recognition of these rights of its own
free will.'
"The advance of underprivileged groups can only come
through insistent clamoring and struggling for rights and
privileges."
But Dr. Bunche goes even deeper into the situation than the
actual unhappiness of the underprivileged group.
"This action (struggling for rights) is indispensable to the so
ciety, for such practices (prejudice and discrimination) are a
cancerous growth in the community. Experience in the modern
world shows that these dangerous prejudices can be exploited
lor political reasons."
"Laws are a backdrop on which the mores of the society are
set," said Dr. Bunche. But he added that the creation of laws to
correct certain mores is not conclusive; the basic ideas and
customs of the people with the society must be changed.
Dr. Bunche doesn't believe that Americans in any community
believe strongly in discrimination. But they have not yet reached
the point when they can overthrow the mores of earlier gen
erations.
"Social equality is up to the individual," said Dr. Bunche, "but
in business equality is a matter of principle. There can be no
compromise in this."
A person's standing in a community depends on the individual
—and the negro should be given the chance a white man has to
develop whatever standing he is capable of.
But when a service or utility is ostensibly open to all, who is
to say that a person cannot have that service because his skin is
a different color?
We can find examples of negro discrimination nearly every
where, but we can also see where the situation has improved, and
negroes are being accepted as individuals, and not as people
"with black skin."
Everytime discrimination and prejudice are checked, it is a step
forward, and there is no effort that is too trivial, nor any effort
too greaf, in trying to check this "cancerous growth" in society.
