To the Editor:
I just finished reading your editorial of Monday entitled ' Honor and
Then Some," and I began to steam once more. There may be honor at
Jtanford so far as cheating in courses is concerned, but does honor end
here? I am one person who is convinced that someone on this campus
loes not consider stealing dishonorable.
Many are the times I hvae left my car on the streets of Los Angeles.
Â»nd I have always found it in one piece the next morning. (You San
rranciscans may not believe it, but it is true!) Then I came to Stanford
tnd blithely believed that everyone was full of "social and individual
esponsibility" because of the Honor Code. Last Friday I changed my
nind.
The only thing anyone could possibly remove from my car, a pair of
ender skirts (one of which was dented by a careless Indian who, inci
entally, left red paint on it) was gone.
My car is still in the same place by Lagunita, and maybe the Indian
/ho went on the scalping party last Thursday night will read this and
eturn them. I doubt it though. ELAINE HACKETT
