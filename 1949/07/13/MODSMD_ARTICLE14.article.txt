# YOUR HUMP
## Camel Session 
### 
Don't get worked up one bit about the title of this column. There's a
simple, rational (?) explanation for it. This is by no means to be made
up of original stuff. Au contraire, that is exactly what it isn't supposed
to be. The stuff that is to be shoveled and sluiced into it is strictly moldy;
it is a heterogeneous assortment of ancient Bull Sessions, Our Hashers,
Razz Editions, and other musty potatoes, large and small, from old Dailies, I
plus whatever other senile glut happens to come along.
Your Hump will try to select the goriest, the gut-splittingest, the rib- '
aldest, and in general the most potent stuff that appears to his well- j
jaundiced eye. Real campus humor vanished almost completely at the '
end of 1937; therefore you, the posterities that were born ten-odd years j
too late, ought to get the benefit of it, providing you can stomach it. Don't ;
use all of it for after-dinner cracks, otherwise there might be horrible
regurgitations. But we'll break you in easily this time.
Screwy Squirrelly Editorial Goes Right Wrong Right Wrong

This is supposed to be a screwy edit. In fact, squirrelly as a squinch. !
Well, here it is. You've read italready. If you don't believe it, read on
and you will find out you are wrong. And if you don't read on, you will
still be wrong, because the idea is for it to be so screwy you will read to
the end, and if you do stop in the middle and don't read to the end, you
will be wrong because you are not supposed to stop till you read to the
end. So even if your are right you are wrong, and if you are wrong you
are right, because if you do wrong and read to the end, or don't read
to the end, you are still right because you want to see what all this type
is about, and you are right in seeing right off that you can't see what
all this type is about until you read wrong (right) and find out. So you
see it doesn't make a hell of a difference what you do, you aro still wrong
and you are still right. If you are wrong, you are wrong and right at the
same time. And if you turn the page to the left after you read wrong
and read all this type you will be right because you will read the page to
the left, and you are wrong because you will not read the page to the
right, and if you turn the page to the right after you read all this screwy
type you will be wrong because you will not read the page to the left,
and you are right because you will read the page to the right. And if you
don't turn any page at all you will still be wrong because you won't be
reading any more of this lousy rag, and you will still be right because not
a damn' bit of this lousy rag is worth reading.—Aug. 5, 1933

and you are right because you will read the page to the right. And if you
don't turn any page at all you will still be wrong because you won't be
reading any more of this lousy rag, and you will still be right because not
a damn' bit of this lousy rag is worth reading.—Aug. 5, 1933

Don't get worked up one bit about the title of this column. There's a
simple, rational (?) explanation for it. This is by no means to be made
up of original stuff. Au contraire, that is exactly what it isn't supposed
to be. The stuff that is to be shoveled and sluiced into it is strictly moldy;
it is a heterogeneous assortment of ancient Bull Sessions, Our Hashers,
Razz Editions, and other musty potatoes, large and small, from old Dailies, I
plus whatever other senile glut happens to come along.
Your Hump will try to select the goriest, the gut-splittingest, the rib- '
aldest, and in general the most potent stuff that appears to his well- j
jaundiced eye. Real campus humor vanished almost completely at the '
end of 1937; therefore you, the posterities that were born ten-odd years j
too late, ought to get the benefit of it, providing you can stomach it. Don't ;
use all of it for after-dinner cracks, otherwise there might be horrible
regurgitations. But we'll break you in easily this time.
Screwy Squirrelly Editorial Goes Right Wrong Right Wrong
Right Left Wright and Rong
This is supposed to be a screwy edit. In fact, squirrelly as a squinch. !
Well, here it is. You've read italready. If you don't believe it, read on
and you will find out you are wrong. And if you don't read on, you will
still be wrong, because the idea is for it to be so screwy you will read to
the end, and if you do stop in the middle and don't read to the end, you
will be wrong because you are not supposed to stop till you read to the
end. So even if your are right you are wrong, and if you are wrong you
are right, because if you do wrong and read to the end, or don't read
to the end, you are still right because you want to see what all this type
is about, and you are right in seeing right off that you can't see what
all this type is about until you read wrong (right) and find out. So you
see it doesn't make a hell of a difference what you do, you aro still wrong
and you are still right. If you are wrong, you are wrong and right at the
same time. And if you turn the page to the left after you read wrong
and read all this type you will be right because you will read the page to
the left, and you are wrong because you will not read the page to the
right, and if you turn the page to the right after you read all this screwy
type you will be wrong because you will not read the page to the left,
and you are right because you will read the page to the right. And if you
don't turn any page at all you will still be wrong because you won't be
reading any more of this lousy rag, and you will still be right because not
a damn' bit of this lousy rag is worth reading.—Aug. 5, 1933
