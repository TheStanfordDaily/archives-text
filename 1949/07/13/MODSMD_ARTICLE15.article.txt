Brooklyn —the American League won its fourth straight all

Then came a key play in the
game, one which might have turned
the fortunes in favor of the ill
fated National Leaguers.
Big Don Newcombe, rookie pitch
er for the Dodgers, hit a smashing
liner deep to left. Williams, never
noted as a defensive star, grabbed
the ball on a dead run and banged
into the left field wall as he made
the catch.
Had he missed, the blow probably
would have gone for a base-clearing
triple. But, as it was, only Marshall
scored after the catch.
The National Leaguers moved
ahead, 5 to 4, in the third when
Jackie Robinson walked, Musial
singled him to third and he scored
on a double play. Big Johnny Mize
of the New York Giants singled to
start a new sequence, Mashall
walked and Kazak, atoning for his
error, singled in Mize. Ironically,
these runs were scored off Virgil
Trucks of Detroit, who did the
poorest pitching of any of the four
American League hurlers, yet got
credit for the victory.
Americans Take Lead
The Americans went ahead to
stay in the fourth inning as they
collected two tallies off Newcombe,
the losing pitcher, even though he
did a top job in his stint on the
mound.
With one out George Kell of De
troit singled and Williams walked.
They both advanced on Joe DiMag
gio's infield out and Joost. on a
three and two pitch, sliced a cheap
handle past first base to score both
runners and make the count 6 to 5.
The Americans teed off on Vern
Bickford of the Braves for two more
runs in the sixth on a single by
Dominick DiMaggio, a walk to Kell.
a fly by Williams (which advanced
DiMaggio to third) and a double by
Joe DiMaggio. Jolting Joe's hit
scored both runners and he moved

Big Don Newcombe, rookie pitch

noted as a defensive star, grabbed
the ball on a dead run and banged
into the left field wall as he made
the catch.

scored after the catch.

liner deep to left. Williams, never
noted as a defensive star, grabbed
the ball on a dead run and banged
into the left field wall as he made
the catch.
Had he missed, the blow probably
would have gone for a base-clearing
triple. But, as it was, only Marshall
scored after the catch.
The National Leaguers moved
ahead, 5 to 4, in the third when
Jackie Robinson walked, Musial
singled him to third and he scored
on a double play. Big Johnny Mize
of the New York Giants singled to
start a new sequence, Mashall
walked and Kazak, atoning for his
error, singled in Mize. Ironically,
these runs were scored off Virgil
Trucks of Detroit, who did the
poorest pitching of any of the four
American League hurlers, yet got
credit for the victory.
Americans Take Lead
The Americans went ahead to
stay in the fourth inning as they
collected two tallies off Newcombe,
the losing pitcher, even though he
did a top job in his stint on the

runs in the sixth on a single by
Dominick DiMaggio, a walk to Kell.

YORK, July 12. —(UP) —lt was the same old story today
Brooklyn —the American League won its fourth straight all
r game, 11 to 7, because its celestial representatives played
3 all-stars while the National League boys were just all-startled.
The winners, who now have taken 12 of the 16 games in the
(summer classic, created a cush- |

of four unearned x - uns for them- |
es in the very first inning, and
t was the margin they needed
e the National League hitters
ked away regularly thereafter,
was the sloppiest game in the
re series, with most of the slip- I
Idiness on the part of the Na- 1
al Leaguers who set a new clas- ■
record by making five errors.
