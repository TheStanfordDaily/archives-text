## DRESSING ROOM Screwball Single Ruins NL Cause 
### 
NEW YORK, July 12 (UP).—
Gloomy and disgusted, a muttering
band of National Leaguers trooped
dispiritedly into their dressing room
today and blamed fate and a
"screwball single" for their all-star
game defeat by the American
League.
To the American League, satiated
by its 12th victory in 16 games, it
was just another day's work, that
11 to 7 conquest.
"Nice going, gang," shouted man
ager Lou Boudreau, and everybody
hustled for the showers so they
could catch trains and planes.
But they were a little slower in
the National League quarters, talk
ing about the carom shot single by
Eddie Joost of the Philadelphia
Athletics which scored two runs
and put the American League on
top to stay.
"It was a slider which I caught
on the very end of the bat," Joost
explained.
"It was damn lucky." fired back
the National Leaguers.
For that hit which brought the
American League from behind, took
one bounce in front of Gil Hodges
and such was its English, that it
twisted sideways and trickled into
right field as George Kell scored
from third and Ted Williams loped
home from second.
"It was a crazy bounder—and the
key play of the whole game," said
manager Billy Soutlnvorth.
Nobody wanted to talk about the
five errors—an all-star game rec
ord—which the National Leaguers
piled up on faults by Eddie Kazak,
Peewee Reese, Andy Seminick,
Willard Marshall and Roy Campa
nella.
"That's us all over," Reese grunt
ed. "That's the National League.
We set the records."
