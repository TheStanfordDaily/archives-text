SACRAMENTO, July 12 (UP).—
Sacramento's Pacific Coast League
climbing Solons face a wild wel
come in their home field tomorrow
night when they return after a
seven-game winning streak that
bounced them from the second di
vision to second place.
Opposing the victorious home
team, which claims it can't be
stopped, will be Hollywood's league
leading Stars, 10 games out in front.
Team officials were readying the
local ball park, Edmonds Field, for
overflow crowds. Solon Vice-Presi
dent George Klumpp said he wished
he had about "three or four thou
sand" extra seats in the park.
As it is, he said, they expect to
have to put many fans along the
edge of the playing field.
The seven-game victory string of
the Solons, at the expense of Port
land and Seattle, was the first such
feat for a Sacramento baseball club

since 1945. In winning the series
from Seattle, the Solons traded
i places with the Rainiers, Sacra
mento gonig from fifth to second
j and Seattle from second to fifth.
Returning Solon ballplayers were
voicing opinions that they couldn't
be stopped now and some even pre
dicting, "We'll win every game dur
ing the rest of the season.
Klumpp, however, was slightly
] more cautious in expressing his en
| thusiasm. Concerning the six-game
Hollywood series he said, "I'm like
! Del Baker —let's wait and see what
| happens . . . But we'll take at least
four."
However, Klumpp had nothing
but praise for manager Baker. '*!
j think Baker is a great manager," he
; declared, and added, "I can't help
: but think we're going to do all right
the rest of the season . . . the team
I is winning now."
