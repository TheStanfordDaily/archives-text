# Film Designer Gives Advice
## 
### 
A big-name "Hollywood star" re- |
I turned to her Stanford alma mater j
Monday to tell a Little Theater au- 1
j dience that her profession would
I hire few new people until those
already on the studio payroll have
died.
Edith Head of Paramount Studios
offered this comment not to aspir
ing actors and actresses but to
those interested in costuming the
greats of the movie world.
The particular type of designing
done for box-oHice beauties, Miss
Head explained, requires only a few
experienced people and there is lit- !
tie chance of crashing the ranks
while one of the current designers j
still wants the job. Those who are '
not discouraged by this apparent :
pessimism should begin with a flu- I
ent drawing ability as sketch-ar
tists. Miss Head believes college :
training to be superior to an art I
j school diploma for this type of '
work.
Although period gostumes are all
| highly authenticated, Miss Head
j tells with pleasure'of costuming a
; 1200 B.C. picture in which the garb I
i had to be left entirely to hers and ,
| the censor's discretion. "Samson
j and Delilah" is set in a time for
! which no records of clothing have
j been found.
The talk on "making actresses j
i look like what they're not" was the
first of a regular Monday afternoon ,
| series on the moiton pictures.
