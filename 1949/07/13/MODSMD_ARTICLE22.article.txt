# Fairbanks Stars In Revival Series
## 
### 
Douglas Fairbanks Sr., who cre
ated the Hollywood version of the
dashing hero complete with cloak,
mustache, and rapier, is the star of
"Around the World in Eighty Min
utes," headliner on the Revial Se
ries of Early Films to be presented
tomorrow evening at 7:15 in Cub
berley Auditorium.
The swashbuckling adventurer of
the early screen combines a boom
ing voice and an easy manner as he
portrays the part of a celebrity
comporting himself abroad. Fair
banks makes a "'first - rate travel
ogue conductor" as he takes in Ja
pan. Chnia, Siam, and India.
Sometimes he merely talks off
stage; at other times he actually
appears on the scene commenting
with witty remarks (authored by
Robert Sherwood) on the subject at
hand. When elephants are shown
lolling about in a river, Fairbanks
notes: "They wear nothing but their
trunks."
On his Oriental tour, Doug plays
golf in Japan, dances with a Siam
ese lady in her ornate palace, and
has lunch with King Prajadhipor.
He accompanies a bevy of noted
scientists on their scramble over
the temple at Angkor, and shoots
leopards with a maharajah. Finally
in India he treats his party to a
ride on his trusty magic carpet and
with all the effort of a mystic ma
gician lands in Hollywood safe and
sound four minutes later.
Admission to the Series s
through membership in the Stan
ford University Film Society. There
are no further memberships avail
able for the summer quarter.
