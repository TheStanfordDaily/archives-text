# Technicolor 'Bop' Caps Make Debut
## 
### ED CASWELL 
Following the spring quarter
siege of "ukes" in every room,
comes a summer quarter call for a
"bebob" cap on every hep head.
Yeah, man, a bebop hat is the
thing.
A bebop cap is generally de
scribed as a knit wool cap, a hybrid
ot a golf cap (sans plus fours) and
a beret, usually of blue, red, white,
green, orange, yellow, brown, and
gray squares. The blue and yellow
is strictly taboo unless overpowered
by a good bloody red, as one be
bopper was recently informed by
his date, an innocent newcomer
strongly imbued with Stanford
spirits.
A bebop cap has many free in
terpretations for wearing. Bebop
pers can wear them way back, or
down in front, pulling the little cord
on the vi§or down under the chin,
being able to see only by raising the
chin to the usual forehead position.
Most beboppers arvise the best way
is in the "French manner," pulled
back casually and down on one ear,
giving the effect of a "sportsman
about to take a Riviera cruise."
Really a zoot effect,,non? Ah, oui!
"Hey, man, when you goin' to
get your bebop hat, huh? Leave us
get on the ball, soon!"
(Ed note: Bebop hats are for
sale in the Enema Gym shop.)
