# English Teachers To Meet at Farm
## 
### 
Teachers of English from the Bay
Area and other sections of Northern
California will meet at Stanford
from Tuesday to Thursday next
week to be brought up to date on
latest scholarly findings in the field.
Sponsored by the University's
department of English and the
School of Education, the conference
will concentrate on subject-matter
taught by English teachers, rather
than on teaching methods.
The program will include talks by
Stanford faculty members on such
subjects as Shakespeare, UNESCO,
contemporary drama, the Arthur
ian legends, and current Romantic
poets.
