# British Unions Boycott Troops In Dock Tie-up
## 
### 
LONDON, July 12 (UP).—Thou
sands of defiant labor unionists
confronted the government with the
threat of a major crisis tonight by
refusing to bundle goods removed
by troops from strike-bound ships
under a royal state-of-emergency
proclamation.
Two thousand meat handlers at
the great Smithfield market, dis
tributing center for Greater Lon
don and all southeast England, vot
ed to touch no provisions unloaded
by troops.
The executive of the Union of
Lightermen, Tugmen and Bargemen
decided tonight to instruct ils 3,800
key men not to work at any place
where troops are employed.
Hundreds of truck drivers who
move meat between ship and mar
ket indicated they would boycott
food which troops unloaded.
Fifteen additional ships were tied
up today by the strike of dockers
who refuse to touch any Canadian
vessel because of a strike of Cana
dian seamen.
At the docks, 2,700 soldiers and
sailors tried to do the work of
13,296 dockers who are now out.
Thus Britain's Labor government
was faced with its most embarrass
ing industrial tie -up in its four
years of office. The crisis began
when dockworkers refused to un
load two struck Canadian ships.
Today troops worked on loading
as well as unloading strike-bound
ships.
At least 127 ships were tied up
by the strike and eight others were
undermanned.
No violence was expected since
the King's proclamation specifically
prohibits interference with the
troops or any form of sabotage.
Dockworkers thronging the clingy
streets near the waterfront held
small impromptu meetings today.
The government's powers under
the proclamation are nearly as wide
as those it had in wartime, and the
most drastic adopted in peace since
the general strike 23 years ago.
