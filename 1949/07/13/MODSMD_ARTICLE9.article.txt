"Unless unforeseen events thwart present progress, a Syrian
Israeli agreement will be signed within a few days," asserted
Dr. Ralph Bunche, acting United Nations mediator, yesterday

•before an overflow audience in Me
morial Auditorium.
(All Arab states except Syria
have signed agreements with Is
rael.)
Dr. Bunche, an authority on th->
world's non-self-governing territo
ries, is a member of the Board o
the American Association of th
United Nations. He graduated froiv
UCLA, and received a Ph.D. frotr
Harvard in 1934.
"The UN experience in Pales
tine," continued the statesman, "i
demonstrating cogently that al
though the UN is not world gov
ernment and lacks enforcement ma
chinery, its voice is becoming an
instrument of great good."
Dr. Bunche pointed out that the
UN is attempting to guide all na
tions along the uncharted and in
sufficiently traveled road to peace.
"Peace," he said, "is a difficult
road and one which in self-interest
we must all follow."
The former State Department of
ficial decried the popular tendency
to be cynical of the UN. It has
found few definitive solutions to
"explosive problems," he conceded,
but said that it always "dulled the
dangerous edge of problems and
eliminated them as frightening
threats to world peace."
"The UN is a light," assured Dr.
Bunche, "dim and flickering, but
growing stronger daily, and we
must choose between this light and
the darkness of another dark age"
He called for banishment of racial
and religious bigotries and for the
acceptance of all peoples, races, and
religions "in a bond of fraternal
kinship, in which there would be
no discrimination, no segregation,
no colonialization, no imperialism."
"These," he said, "must be unsa
vory relics of a dark age happily
passed."
Dr. Wallace Sterling, president oE
the University, returned from his
vacation specifically to welcome and
introduce Dr. Bunche.
