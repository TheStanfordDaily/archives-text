WASHINGTON, July 14 (UP)
â€” President Truman today
moved to get the Armed Serv
ices Unification Bill off a side
track in the House by putting
the reorganization project on a
"you do it or I will" basis.
He Stepped into the unification
%ht after the House Armed Services
; Committee unanimously approved a '
, bill to centralize buying and spend
ing ot the military forces but re
| fused for the second time to act on
i f f at u ules of the Senate-parsed
bill to tighten unification.
Mr Truman revealed at his
| weekly news conference that he soon
j will submit to Congress a plan for
| reorganizing the armed forces and
i achieving greater unity.
While he declined to discuss de
| tails, other administration sources
jsaid it is part of a complicated
strategy tor bypassing the unifica
tion roadblock erected by the Armed
| oervices Committee.
Chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga ) !
! th , e committee Mr. Truman has j
i drafted an executive order to carry
I out nearly all' of the steps pro
| vided 111 the Senate Bill.
, This order, Vinson indicated, is
intended primarily as a weapon for I
administration strategists to wield in :
the fight for congressional action on !
a unification bill.
Chairman Millard F. Tydings (D-
Md.), of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, joined in the legislative |
squeeze plav by announcing he does
not intend to seek Senate action on
military pay rises until the House
acts on unification.
Tydings said "several influential
members of his committee have
served notice that thev won't vote
for the 5302.000.000 pay bill, passed
by the House, unless the money lor i
! the program is saved by the econo- i
| niies which would result from i
I tighter unification.
