# Vatican Floods Radio Lanes With Excommunication Edict
## 
### 
ROME. July 14 (UP). —Powerful
radio transmitters of the Vatican
started broadcasting to millions of
Catholics in Iron Curtain countries
today that the church had decreed
the excommunication of Commu
nists.
Over and over, the Vatican sent
the church decree in eight lan
guages — Czechoslovak, Slovene.
Croat. English. French. German,
Hungarian, and Spanish.

Church sources expressed belie!
that direct broadcasts, beamed to-
Eastern countries, would be the
only way of getting the news to
Catholics promptly in countries like
Czechoslovakia. There the state nofc
only controls all propaganda outlet?
but also has forbidden the Roman.
Catholic hierarchy to make "politi
cal" pronouncements.
Dispatches from Czechoslovakia,
Poland, and Hungary said not c
word had been published about the
decree in the newspapers or broad
cast by the radios. All are govern
ment-controlled.
The decree was a terrific blow tc
the Italian Communist party.
The independent newspaper Stani
pa of Turin estimated that about
one - third of Italy's population
would be affected.
Salvato Cappelli, editor of the big
Communist weekly Omnibus, pre
dicted a heavy membership loss for
the party. He suggested that Cath
olic women would induce their hus
bands and sons to leave the partv
'"There is general indignation ir
Communist circles." Cappelli said
"This move of the Vatican is re
garded as an unworthy action. The
statutes of the Italian Communist
party declare precisely that there
is no conflict between Communism
and Catholicism."
The pro-Communist newspaper It
Paese denounced the decree as c
"gesture of hate" intended to in
timidate the people.
"The Vatican is attempting with
its intimidating note to divide th*.-
mass of the Italian people and to
use this split for the success of its
cloudy and oblique policy." the pa
per said.
Pietro Nenni. left-wing Socialist
leader, said that the decree might
result in the "emergence and
spread" of '"national" Catholic
churches which put "loyalty to
Christianity above fealty to the Rj
man Catholic Church."
