## Bull Session 
### 
Wednesday, through no fault of ours, John Bush, alias "Your Hump,"
turned in a "Camel Session'' that was inadvertently printed in the paper.
The name "Camel Session ' came to Bush as I 'lie was telling a bawdy
joke with the line: "They sat around shooting the camel, bull being
unknown in those days." We will not be a party to such nonsense.

We have been taking French 1 for three weeks and so feel qualified
to give a few pointers on travel in France. Ah, France!
The people ot France are very cultured—even the small children speak
practically nothing but French. They even claim to understand each
ether. This is, of course, plain rot. They are just being polite.
However, many Frenchmen do speak French, so it might be a good
idea to know some key phrases before your trip. Then notes on pronun
ciation are prepared to give you the highest type Parisian accent.
"Qui est cc qui a mange le main de ma tante?" Translation: "Who is
that who has eaten my aunt's hand?" Pronunciation: Key eh saw key ah
mahngzhay puh meng duh mah tangt? The value of this phrase is de
pendent upon the type of person with whom you plan to associate in
France.
"On sont mes petits elephants?" Translation: "Where are my little
elephants?" Pronunciation: Oo song may p'tee zelephong? This may sound
billy, but if you plan to take any small elephants with you, learn this
phrase by all means. You have no idea just what a French railroad agent
can do with baggage—particularly with small elephants.
''Ma soeur s'endorme dans I'encriere." Translation: "My sister goes io
t.ieep in the inkwell." Pronunciation: Mah swr sengdawrm dang lencree-er.
You may say that this is an impossible pronunciation, particularly the
"swr" part. However, I known my sister better than you do. "Swr" is
as close as you come to it.
Now that you are all prepared to speak French, we'll have to allez
tider ma soeur en desengager ses chevaeux du mechanisme de la hall clock.
In case you haven't learned your lessons, this means we've got to go
help our sister get her hair out of the works of the hall clock. This may
also seem strange to you. We still say, you don't know our sister.

We were standing across the street from the Engineering Corner wait
ing for a ride to Paly when a huge Great Dane came running around
the corner and knocked down a pedestrian. Just then a Crosley came
around the corner.
"Are you hurt?" asked a bystander.
"No," said the pedestrian, "but the can tied to his tail scared the day
lights out of me."
