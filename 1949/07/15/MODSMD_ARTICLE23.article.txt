### DUANE SPILSBURY 
(This is the first of two articles by Duane Spilsbury on Jessica Tandy
and Hume Cronyn. who arc currently working on the Stanford pro
duction of "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.")
The nation-wide slump in moving picture attendance during the past
year has produced one hell of a to-do. For one thing, it has sent the
movie industry scurrying into conferences. It has expressed a national
horselaugh at Hollywood's epidemic of lousy pictures and lousier re
releases right where it hurts the most, in the pocketbook.
It has produce a realization that the age-old idea of entertainment, a
"herd of pretty, blank-faced girls walking around a screen looking nothing
but promiscuous, is perhaps not the success formula that the big boys
thought it was. And, it has produced a new evaluation of talent and a
new conception of assigning credit where credit belongs.
As a result, the writers, composers, recorders, make-up men, tech
nicians, and talented players, without whom the more sensational lights
ci Hollywood would look all too tragically like themselves, are at last
coming into their rights.
Toward the end of fame where fame rightfully belongs, we offer the
team of Tandy and Cronyn.
At present artists-in-residence at Stanford University, Hume Cronyn
and Jessica Tandy, in private life a sedate married couple with a family
ci three kids and a Buiek convertible, are of the odd type who go around
passing out unsolicited eulogies of the other to nosy interviewers. About
Miss Tandy, Mr. Cronyn offered:
"She has a perfect sense of timing combined with a superb ear for
music; both language and sound."
About Mr. Cronyn, Miss Tandy offered:
"He has an excellent sense of humor which carries over into his acting
*>s an ability to add the touch of comedy to tragedy which gives it body."
Since we are in this vein of admiration, it looks as though it will be up
to the interviewer to tell the rest of the story.
Between the two of them, teh Cronyn's are actress, actor, director,
parent, scenarist, movie star, screen writer, comedien(ne), and admitted
r/iembcrs of "The Society for The Hearty Laugh at The Picture We
Appeared in in That No One Could Write Home About."
Mr. Cronyn's membership rests on a small-budget "epic" which could
have (but didn't) tell a great story of the development of the atomic bomb.
His classic line: "Well! This is it!" Miss Tandy's enrollment has to do
with the great disappointment to the sex-mad youth (I read the Ladies
Home Journal) of America, "Forever Amber."
However, rather than laeve the wrong impression, I will add that Miss
Tandy has played Shakespeare with the Old Vic Company under the
c irection of a famous old slouch named Tyrone Guthrey. And during
the last two years she has appeared as the lead in the original Broad
way production of "A Streetcar Named Desire," to describe which play
Â»nd performance some usually cannibalistic critics employed the Holly
wood terms of high praise: supreme, superb, gigantic, stupenduous. All
of which is enough to gladden the heart of any actress. She is at present
under contract to Twentieth Century-Fox Studious in Hollywood.
