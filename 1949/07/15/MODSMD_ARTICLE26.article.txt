The Rod and the Black
This week the Catholic Church announced that all Communists and
fellow travelers are henceforth and forevermore persona non grata in
the various cathedrals, churches and wayside chapels of its mighty
spiritual fortress. Thus, the two great institutions have made a clean
break, and may be expected to square off for a terrific 15 rounds, no
holds barred.
It is characteristic of large and overweening organizations that no mem
bers are consulted, the head-end bengi endowed with all possible Light.
The conflict, after all, is a matter of Principle; and all prestige and
Strength must be used to buttress the Battle of Giants.
Could the massive array of wealth and talent being poured into this
essentially deadlocked conflict be turned to the objective resolution of
current economic and political paradoxes, both Catholics and Communists
would soon be scratching their heads over the meanings of presently
touted principles. But to cast loose from the Isle of Dogma on the Ship
of Reason seems an unthought-of venture.
To deal internationally with practical answers to cogent issues seems
beyond the power of their crystallized brains. The Catholics, for example,
refuse to face the fact solving economic problems implies a higher stan
dard of living, and that if one feeds the world population, mass methods
of birth control must be developed at the same time. The habit of re
ferring every aspect of social life to an economic interpretation (to be
viewed as method in the struggle for power) is a well known Communist
technique, which is swiftly poisoning whatever independent thought re
mains within their sphere.
Although Catholic and Communist methods differ, both finally lend
themselves to the same oppression of the masses in a psychological way.
They both encourage mass reaction on a signal level. Likewise, both
discourage the type of variety of thought and suggestion which is unified
on a level of voluntary co-operation.
UN Laboratory
An occasional person is heard expressing discouragement about the
usefulness of the United Nations. Some are skeptical and a fey cynical.
It would be worth remembering that the UN is a power complex. As
such, it must establish itself among other powers which already reached
an accommodationâ€”no matter how shaky. The implication is a complete
rebalance of power.
To effect an influential, or governing, place in human affairs, the UN
will have to make a gradual extension into the concerns of so-called
"sovereign" powers. Certainly, the Big Four are not going to be intimi
dated by speeches on the "rights of small nations."
As Dr. Bunche pointed out, the Arab-Israeli conflict was a step in the
right direction. A bolder step would be the considered interference in
South Africa. The present premier, Dr. Malan, is rapidly constructing a
one-class dictatorship in this area. Since the UN is dedicated to the
removal and the implementation of human progress some swift action is
indicated. Otherwise, we will see another cancerous spot on the already
sick body-politic.
