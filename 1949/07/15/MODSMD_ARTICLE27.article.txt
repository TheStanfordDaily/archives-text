# Encina TV Set Attracting Many Spectators Nightly
## 
### DON SEYDEL 
Where'll yon find the men of Encina in their evening off-hours? Palo
Alto? Rossotti's? Maybe some of them—but a good many will be right
down in the lobby watching one of the newer additions to Encina equip
ment —television.
The new set was placed in the lounge as a gift of the Class of 1952. It
is made in the same style as the barroom type, elevated six feet of! the
floor so that everyone in the room can watch the programs.
At the top of the red leather case is an 18x24 inch screen, the lacge
made possible by the mirror-reflection type of enlargement. Such a large
screen gives a good image, visible from most any part of the room.
ihe money lor the set was raised under the direction of Hank Rosin,
president of the sponsors. A goal was set up among the Encina men. each
one trying to sell at least one subscription to one of the Curtis Publishing
Co.'s magazins. An arrangement with the firm allowed a certain per
centage to go towards the fund.
It was first hoped that the set would lie in operation by Christmas, 1948,
but unavoidable delays held it off till late January. At the time the set
was bought, a console model TV set was presented to Mrs. Sumner,
resident director of the hall, for a Christmas gift.
Probably the favorite comedy program among male viewers is the
Milton Berle show. Another "good" is the Arthur Godfrey show. The
wrestling matches always draw a big crowd, as do many of the baseball
games.
Many of the shows viewed in this area aire specially produced telefilm
cine productions, although the live programs still rate tops.
