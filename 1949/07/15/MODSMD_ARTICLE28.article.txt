### CHUCK MILLER 
SEQUOIA AND KINGS CANYON
NATIONAL PARKS. By John R.
White and Samuel J. Pusatcri.
Illustrated. $3.00.

Situated half-way between San
Francisco and Los Angeles are two
ol the most scenic vacation spots in
the West. They are Sequoia and
Kings Canyon National Parks.
Throughout the year almost 700.-
000 persons visit these areas of still
forests and bouldered crags rising
above 10,000 ieet, and a roaring
Kings River that throws its fine
spray across the highway during
the spring thaw.
The average casual visitor can
know very little about a region of
such interest and beauty. "Sequoia
and Kings Canyon National Parks"
lulfills this need.
This little volume gives the his
tories of both parks, telling about
(he first discovery by white men,
the fires that razed the small tim
ber but could not destroy the Big
Trees, a lumber wagon road that
became the Generals Highway, and,
today, the continued development
and preservation of these virginal
parks as unmarred vacation cen
ters.
As an authoritative guide book, it
contains seven maps which locate in
detail all of the camps and lodges,
ranger stations, roads, and other fa
cilities for the benefit of the visitor.
Included also is useful information
on changes in the seasons.
Considerable attention is given to
tracing the easier and the more dif
ficult foot trails, with descriptions of
landmarks along the way which are
of scenic as well as historical inter
est.
The entire book is written in a
lucid and entertaining style, and the
material is conveniently arranged
according to the individual parks.
It is illustrated by a number of
remarkable photographs, and in the
"Natural History" section are seven
pages of drawings to aid the visitor
in identifying the flora most abun
dant in the region. In the same
section are brief descriptions of the
birds and animals which inhabit
both parks.
Those who enjoy climbing to the
more rugged heights along the John
Muir Trail will find valuable data
in the "Miscellany" section on the
elevation of peaks and passes, and
the names and addresses of packing
outfits.
White & Pusateri's book is an in
dispensable guide anil history for
all who plan a trip to Sequoia and
to Kings Canyon, the place where,
in John Muir's words, "beneath the
shadows of the highest mountains in
the Sierra . . . the canyons are
deepest and the snow-laden peaks
are crowded most closely together."

SEQUOIA AND KINGS CANYON
NATIONAL PARKS. By John R.
White and Samuel J. Pusatcri.
Illustrated. $3.00.

Situated half-way between San
Francisco and Los Angeles are two
ol the most scenic vacation spots in
the West. They are Sequoia and
Kings Canyon National Parks.
Throughout the year almost 700.-
000 persons visit these areas of still
forests and bouldered crags rising
above 10,000 ieet, and a roaring
Kings River that throws its fine
spray across the highway during
the spring thaw.
The average casual visitor can
know very little about a region of
such interest and beauty. "Sequoia
and Kings Canyon National Parks"
lulfills this need.
This little volume gives the his
tories of both parks, telling about
(he first discovery by white men,
the fires that razed the small tim
ber but could not destroy the Big
Trees, a lumber wagon road that
became the Generals Highway, and,
today, the continued development
and preservation of these virginal
parks as unmarred vacation cen
ters.
As an authoritative guide book, it
contains seven maps which locate in
detail all of the camps and lodges,
ranger stations, roads, and other fa
cilities for the benefit of the visitor.
Included also is useful information
on changes in the seasons.
Considerable attention is given to
tracing the easier and the more dif
ficult foot trails, with descriptions of
landmarks along the way which are
of scenic as well as historical inter
est.
