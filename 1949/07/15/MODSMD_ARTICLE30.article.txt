Workmen are busy at Stan
:ord this summer on construc
tor! projects which include in
stallation of a new section of
steam lines, a new boiler in the
University's steam plant, an
addition to the campus sewer
line, and resurfacing of Palm
Drive and a student parking lot.
A power shovel is currently at
work preparing a ditch on Galvez
Street for installation of a line of 12-
inch insulated pipe which will run
from the steam plant, opposite the
men's gymnasium, to Stern Hall, at
the intersection of Galvez and Es
condido.
The work is being done under a
$24,970 contract with Macnsons Con
tracting Engineers of San Francisco.
The job, which is to be completed
by Oct. 9, will primarily provide
steam for Stern Hall, but it also sup
plement the service available to En
cina and Crothers Halls.
Seraphim Post, engineer, who is
assistant to Business Manager Alf
E. Brandin and is in charge of co
ordinating construction work at the
University, said that progress is also
being made on the $4(5,000 job of in
stalling a new boiler in the Uni
versity steam plant. The old boiler
has been removed, and the new
boiler, with its additional 1,100
horsepower, is ready to be put in.
Post said that an interesting aspect
of the work on the University's
steam distribution system is that
much of the preliminary survey
work was done by graduate students
in Stanford's mechanical engineering
department under the direction of
Professor Volney Finch.
Meanwhile, a new sewer line is
being laid from the corner of Escon
dido and Arguello, down past Toyon
Hall and Encina to a point approxi
mately opposite the band house.
This new line will service prac
tically all of the campus residential
area and part of Stern Hall.
A new coat of oil and rock has
been put on Palm Drive in the past
few days and similar treatment has
been given the parking lot bounded
by Alvarado Row, Escondido Road,
and Galvez Street.
University corporation yard work
men, directed by Carroll L. Blacker,
superintendent of buildings and
grounds, are carrying out all the
work except the boiler installation
and work on the new steam lines.
The corporation yard crews will
also complete two new water wells
which were drilled last year near
San Francisquito Creek. The re
maining work consists of tying the
wells into the University's water
system. One well is approximately
half a mile upstream from the Con
valescent Home and the other well
about a mile from the home.

Drive and a student parking lot.
A power shovel is currently at
work preparing a ditch on Galvez
Street for installation of a line of 12-
inch insulated pipe which will run
from the steam plant, opposite the
men's gymnasium, to Stern Hall, at
the intersection of Galvez and Es
condido.
The work is being done under a
$24,970 contract with Macnsons Con
tracting Engineers of San Francisco.
The job, which is to be completed
by Oct. 9, will primarily provide
steam for Stern Hall, but it also sup
plement the service available to En
cina and Crothers Halls.
Seraphim Post, engineer, who is
assistant to Business Manager Alf
E. Brandin and is in charge of co
ordinating construction work at the
University, said that progress is also
being made on the $4(5,000 job of in
stalling a new boiler in the Uni
versity steam plant. The old boiler
has been removed, and the new
boiler, with its additional 1,100
horsepower, is ready to be put in.
Post said that an interesting aspect
of the work on the University's
steam distribution system is that
much of the preliminary survey
work was done by graduate students
in Stanford's mechanical engineering
department under the direction of
Professor Volney Finch.
Meanwhile, a new sewer line is
being laid from the corner of Escon
dido and Arguello, down past Toyon
Hall and Encina to a point approxi
mately opposite the band house.
This new line will service prac
tically all of the campus residential
area and part of Stern Hall.
A new coat of oil and rock has
been put on Palm Drive in the past
few days and similar treatment has
been given the parking lot bounded
by Alvarado Row, Escondido Road,
and Galvez Street.
University corporation yard work
men, directed by Carroll L. Blacker,
superintendent of buildings and
grounds, are carrying out all the
work except the boiler installation
and work on the new steam lines.
The corporation yard crews will
also complete two new water wells
which were drilled last year near
San Francisquito Creek. The re
maining work consists of tying the
wells into the University's water
system. One well is approximately
half a mile upstream from the Con
valescent Home and the other well
about a mile from the home.
Workmen are busy at Stan
:ord this summer on construc
tor! projects which include in
stallation of a new section of
steam lines, a new boiler in the
University's steam plant, an
addition to the campus sewer
line, and resurfacing of Palm
Drive and a student parking lot.
