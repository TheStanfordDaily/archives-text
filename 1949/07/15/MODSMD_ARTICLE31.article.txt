# University Signs Pipeline Contract
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Water Com
mittee Monday morning a contract
was signed for the construction of
new pipeline from the corner of
Escondido to the steam plant.
Students witnessed the arrival of
the first construction machinery
cross from the Encina Gymnasium
yesterday when a steam shovel
tractor was unloaded from a truck.
The pipe along the roadway will be
used in the project.
No change has taken place in the
sparse water supply, and although
there is no prospect of water ra
tioning yet for this year, campus
residents are requested to use water
<. conomically.
