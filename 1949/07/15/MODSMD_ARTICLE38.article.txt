# Tower Commands View of Campus
## 
### 
Everybody's heard about San j
j Francisco's famous "Top o' the j
â–  Mark" with its breathtaking view of :
j the city, but some may not realize
| that Hoover Tower visitors enjoy a
panoramic view of the entire Stan
[ lord community.
The i levator trip to the four
| teenth-floor observation platform is I
j without charge, and the tower is j
j open weekdays between 1 and 5
p.m. Saturdays the tower is also j
open to the public during the morn- I
ing, from 10 until 12, but it is closed j
on Sundays.
Visitors are asked to stay in the j
j front lobby while waiting for the ,
| elevator, and should remain quiet I
J so that those using the Hoover Li
brary facilities will not be dis
j turbed. Although these trips arc
| not guided tours, an attendant is i
| available to answer questions.
