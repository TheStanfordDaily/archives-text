| Oahu's Diamond Head finish line.
' She had hoped to cross the line at
; about 2 p.m. (PST) —10 hours bet
; ter than the old record. But after a

i night riding out a calm, Skipper
Richard S.S Rheem radioed it would
! be nearer to 10 p.m. (PST).
He said the schooner was now
: making only nine knots, against a
| previous 11 in strong trade winds.
| During the night all boats became
almost becalmed and speeds drop
ped as low as five knots.
The crippled yacht Flying Cloud,
from the Waikiki Yacht Club, re
ported it was sailing with a jury

I rig at five knots. -Although her po
sition was not reported, she said
she was in no danger.
The position of the Patolita, in
second place earlier, was unreport
( ed in latest messages.
