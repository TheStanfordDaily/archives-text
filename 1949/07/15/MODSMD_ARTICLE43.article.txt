vin Rack ley raced all the way from
first base to score on Billy Cox's
; 10th-inning double tonight, giving
the Brooklyn Dodgers a 6 to 5 vic
tory over the Cincinnati Reds and
a I^2-game edge in the National
| League race.
The second-place St. Louis Car
dinals helped the Dodger cause with
a 1 to 0 loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies.
Things looked black for the
| Dodgers as, leading the league by
1 only half a game, they went into the
j ninth inning trailing the Reds, 5 to
i 3, with the Cardinals still scoreless
and going strong at Philadelphia.
Then up stepped pinch - hitter
Dick Whitman with a single. Pee
wee Reese walked, and both run
ners advanced on Gene Hermanski's
sacrifice bunt.
Extra Innings
Duke Snider grounded out, but
Whitman scored on the play to
leave the Dodgers trailing by only
one run with two gone. Jackie Rob
inson was up next and he rapped
a single to bring in Reese with the
: tying run and put himself on with
the potentially winning run. Bui
; Robinson was caught at second
j stealing and the game went into an
j extra inning.
The Reds went down 1-2-3, and
: then came the Dodgers red - hot.
I Rackley led off with a single. Cox,
: the next man up, doubled and Marv
j came sliding in safe for victory.
Del Ennis' 13th homer of the sea
' son gave Ken Heintzelman the nod
over Max Lanier in an airtight
hurling duel at Philadelphia as the
: Cards tasted defeat. The win was
, the seventh straight for Ken.
Giants Win
Larry Jansen's four-hit pitching
; and Johnny Mize's three runs hat
ted in gave the Giants a 4 to 3 edge
; over the Pirates at New York. Mize
! cleared his 14th homer of the year.
Dutch Leonard held the Braves
to four hits and then batted in the
winning run for a 3 to 2 Chicago
Cub victory. His looping single to
center in the eighth scored Frank
Gustine for the margin.
I The Cleveland Indians made it
nine wins in 10 games with a 7 to 1
conquest of the Philadelphia Ath
i letics. Bob Lemon, a 20-game win
: tier last year, chalked up his 10th
!of the season and thus bounded
i into the running for that pitching
prize again. He gave up only three
i hits tonight.
Meanwhile, Larry Doby and Ike
Boone homered to pace the Indian
! attack.
The Boston Red Sox, also on a
win streak in chase of the front
-1 running New York Yankees, made
it eight in a row by beating the De
troit Tigers. 5 to 2. That placed the
Sox within a half game of fading
Philadelphia's third place in the
standings.
Joe Dobson's pitching was effec
tive enough to strand 12 Tigers on
the bases as he won his seventh.
The Yankees kept their five-and
a-half-game lead, however, with a
to 0 win over the hapless St. Louis
Rrowns. Allie Reynolds won his
10th.
The White Sox beat the Senators.
