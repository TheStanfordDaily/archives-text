Chuck Taylor announced yester
day that the summer intramural
volleyball tournament has been
called oft'.
There will be a tournament
among Encina teams only, however.
Seven teams have signed up from
the summer men's dorm.
Only three teams from outside of
Encina signed with Taylor. This was
not enough to make an all-campus
league possible.
"I was afraid that would hap
pen, Taylor said. "The response
was not good enough."
In previous summers, Stanford
has had mural leagues in both vol
leyball and soitball. Repeated calls
went unheeded this summer by
clubs and organizations which
might have sent teams to the court.
