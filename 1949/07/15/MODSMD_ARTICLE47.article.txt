## The 						Sports Desk San Jose Both Largest and Oldest Among California's State Colleges 
### 
This column had not hit the special places around the Quad last
week for many hours, before an irate San Jose State man sat down at
a typewriter and told me a few things I did not know.
The colors of San Jose State are Gold and White, he said, not Gold and
Blue. I was misled by last year's football jerseys, which were lettered
with blue, not white.
The writer of the letter also said that San Jose State was older than
Stanford.
As a matter of fact, he said, '"Governor Stanford signed the bill char
tering the school. According to San Jose's president. Dv. T. W. Mac-
Quarrie, Stanford came as an afterthought to the early Governor of
California.
Of course, I was surprised by this, and since I wrote the column last
week, I have done a little research on my own. And come to find out.
San Jose has been doing things in athletics for a good many years now.
Publicity Director Tells Football Story
Here is what Danny Hill, director of the Athletic News Bureau, has
t > say about things down there:
The Spartan football teams of 1937 to 1939 were the highest-scoring
teams in the nation. San Jose still holds an all-time defensive record
as listed by the NCAB for the fewest yards per play allowed on the
ground. Bill Cook's record of kicking six field goals still stands as an
intercollegiate record. All of the records in the last two sentences were
made during one season."
In the years from 1937 to 1939. State played Nevada. Santa Barbara.
College of the Pacific, and San Diego State. It is interesting to note that
between 1900 and 1935. Stanford played San Jose five times. San Jose
failed to make a single score in all five games. Last year, they almost
beat us, however.
On the coaching staff at San Jose, they have had such men as Fielding
"Hurry-Up" Yost, "Pop" Warner, and Dud DeGroot.
Stale Honors More Than Football
But football is not all San Jose is proud of. Hill goes on to tell about
State's other teams:
''In basketball, Spartan teams for the last two years have competed in
the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) Tourna
ment in Kansas City; Spartan boxing teams have achieved national promi
nence; the Spartan golf team. 1948 champions, are still among the nation's
best; the 1948 water polo team was National AAU Junior Indoor Cham
pion; and the baseball team this year proved it is one oi the best on the
Coast.
"For the first time, this year San Jose State was honored by the selec
tion of one man one first All-Coast team—Pete Mesa in baseball."
Hill then goes on to say that one of the indications that San Jose has
arrived in sports are the large numbers of requests for games which
pour into the San Jose campus. People are beginning to hear of "San
Jose" while before no one ever knew of them.
As far as the age of the college goes, the whole thing began way back
in 1857 as Minn's Evening Normal School in San Francisco. The school
was moved to San Jose in 1870. San Jose expects to enroll 7.800 students
next fall. This makes San Jose State the largest and the oldest of the
California State Colleges.

Jose" while before no one ever knew of them.
As far as the age of the college goes, the whole thing began way back
in 1857 as Minn's Evening Normal School in San Francisco. The school
was moved to San Jose in 1870. San Jose expects to enroll 7.800 students
next fall. This makes San Jose State the largest and the oldest of the
California State Colleges.
This column had not hit the special places around the Quad last
week for many hours, before an irate San Jose State man sat down at
a typewriter and told me a few things I did not know.
The colors of San Jose State are Gold and White, he said, not Gold and
Blue. I was misled by last year's football jerseys, which were lettered
with blue, not white.
The writer of the letter also said that San Jose State was older than
Stanford.
As a matter of fact, he said, '"Governor Stanford signed the bill char
tering the school. According to San Jose's president. Dv. T. W. Mac-
Quarrie, Stanford came as an afterthought to the early Governor of
California.
Of course, I was surprised by this, and since I wrote the column last
week, I have done a little research on my own. And come to find out.
San Jose has been doing things in athletics for a good many years now.
Publicity Director Tells Football Story
Here is what Danny Hill, director of the Athletic News Bureau, has
t > say about things down there:
The Spartan football teams of 1937 to 1939 were the highest-scoring
teams in the nation. San Jose still holds an all-time defensive record
as listed by the NCAB for the fewest yards per play allowed on the
ground. Bill Cook's record of kicking six field goals still stands as an
intercollegiate record. All of the records in the last two sentences were
made during one season."
In the years from 1937 to 1939. State played Nevada. Santa Barbara.
College of the Pacific, and San Diego State. It is interesting to note that
between 1900 and 1935. Stanford played San Jose five times. San Jose
failed to make a single score in all five games. Last year, they almost
beat us, however.
On the coaching staff at San Jose, they have had such men as Fielding
"Hurry-Up" Yost, "Pop" Warner, and Dud DeGroot.
Stale Honors More Than Football
But football is not all San Jose is proud of. Hill goes on to tell about
State's other teams:
''In basketball, Spartan teams for the last two years have competed in
the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) Tourna
ment in Kansas City; Spartan boxing teams have achieved national promi
nence; the Spartan golf team. 1948 champions, are still among the nation's
best; the 1948 water polo team was National AAU Junior Indoor Cham
pion; and the baseball team this year proved it is one oi the best on the
Coast.
"For the first time, this year San Jose State was honored by the selec
tion of one man one first All-Coast team—Pete Mesa in baseball."
Hill then goes on to say that one of the indications that San Jose has
arrived in sports are the large numbers of requests for games which
pour into the San Jose campus. People are beginning to hear of "San
Jose" while before no one ever knew of them.
