# Initial Rose Bowl Recalled
## 
### MORTY NOVICK 
They will tell you up at Michigan
that on nights when the wind is
whistling through the sycamores,
the ghostly voice of George Fielding
Yost can be heard calling: "Hurry
up! Hurry up!"
That's the cry Yost was shouting
from the sidelines New Year's Day
back in 1902 when Michigan met
Stanford in the initial Rose Bowl
classic.
"Dig in there, we haven's a snap,"
he continually yelled.
The historic contest was a bruis
ing. brawling, barney, which saw
the'tenacious Wolverines, a superb
ly co-ordinated Spartan-like out
fit, whip Stanford. 49-0.
And. though the Indians were
handed a terrific beating, Captain
Ralph Fisher called the game "the j
greatest benefit to Western ath- |
letes."
Chronicle Says "Magnificent"
With one-third of the squad com
posed of substitutes and the key
men . . . Traeger . . . Roosevelt . . .
Clark . . . and McGilvray . . . play
ing with injuries, it's no wonder
the San Francisco Chronicle used
the superlative adjectives "magnifi
cent" and "marvelous" in describ
ing the grit and courage and de
termination of the underdog eleven, j
Late in the first half Stanford I
caught the fire of the mob's cheer, j
which rose like flame above the j
rambling wooden bowl, when they !
held the Wolverines four inches |
from the last line.
It was first down and inches to
go when Bill Traeger ripped :
through the Michigan line and
threw Willie Heston for a yard loss, j
Again and again the Wolverines i
charged the line, but Stanford
wouldn't waver and took the ball
over on downs.
But Michigan Scores
With seven minutes to go in the i
first half Michigan finally scored, j
In a furious, sustained march they
went 67 yards for a touchdown. ,
Willie Heston climaxed the attack
when he skirted around right end
Pete Cooper, and raced 35 yards
down the sidelines twisting and
feinting away from tacklers like the
football Houdini he was.
Michigan's first tally seemed as
personal as a body blow to the
Stanford eleven, and at the half
Michigan led 17-0.
In the second half. Michigan j
sealed up the game tighter than a ;
sailboat in a bottle, scoring six
touchdowns on 32 points helped by j
five Stanford fumbles.
Stanford Plavs 17 Men
Michigan ended the game with its j
original eleven men, not substitut- i
ing once. Stanford, on the other '
hand, used seventeen men.
Michigan went on to win the 1903
Rose Bowl, but Stanford, like Achil- I
les. went into its tent and was not |
seen at Pasadena until 1925.
