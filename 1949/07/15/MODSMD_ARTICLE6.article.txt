# Brush Fire Sears Lot Near Corral
## 
### 
A roaring brush fire, fanned by a
steady northeasterly wind, swept
aci-oss approximately three acres of
dry grass and eucalyptus groves
yesterday afternoon near the old
riding corrals on Pine Avenue next
to Alameda Street on the Stanford
campus. Two fire trucks were
called out at 3:OG p.m.
The police had to block off Pine
Avenue to prevent sightseeing cars
from driving down Pine Avenue to
watch the low wall of black and
orange flames crackle in the dry
July grass and slowly move under
the old corral fence to the road,
where the fire crew made a line
to stop it.
The fire started from the Stanford
dumps by jumping a fire trail which
surrounds the dump. There it
spread quickly into the ROTC fields
behind the barracks, where the rid
ing corral of years ago is still
marked by a post and barbed wire
fence.
No damage was caused other than
the burning of the grass. Chief John
Marston said the crew allowed the
fire to burn itself out to the road to
prevent any further danger from
fire in that area during the summer.
Another grass fire was reported
immediately afterward on Sand Hill
and Whisky Roads. Only one truck
was called out to fight it.
