# Hoover Institute Acclaimed Center For Study of Human Affairs, Peace
## 
### FRED TEAGUE 
"The purpose of this institution is
to promote peace. Its records stand
as a challenge to those who promote
j war. They should attract those who
search for peace. I therefore dedi
i cate this building to these pur
! poses."
These were the words that Her
j bel t Hoover chose as he dedicated
the Hoover tower on June 20. 1941.
Some think of the Hoover Library
as a great store of knowledge to
which scholars may refer in their
j research. It is that, and it is much
! more.
The Hoover Institute and Library
' is a world center for the study of
j human affairs. In the tower today
j men and women are studying the
human problems, revolutions, and
j world relations of many peoples.
They are studying from docu
i ments unavailable elsewhere be
j cause of destruction or political
i censorship. The Hoover Institute is
! an institution capable of utilizing
the great resources in the Library
for public service through teaching
and publication.
Donations Over Million
These documents that they are
using were either given to the In
stitute or purchased by it with
funds donated to it or funds set
aside for it by the University. Cash
i contributions to the Institute total
i more than $3 1 4 million. The gifts of
j material from governments, associ
| ations, and individuals would cost
a great deal more to replace if they
could be replaced.
In 194G the Rockefeller FounJa

j tion contributed $200,000 to the In
i stitute for a five-year program of
[ Slavic studies. The Carnegie Cor
poration gave the Institute a three
year grant of $180,000 for the study
j of the impact of revolutions and in
j ternal relations.
The Institute has representatives
all over the world whose sole mis
: sion is the gathering of the docu-
I ments that make up the Library.
. Some of these are not on the pay
i roll and are merely honorary rep
, resentatives who work for nothing
| because they respect the cause of
j the Library.
Devoted to Peace
The Library's collections are de
i voted primarily to international re
| lations bearing upon peace. They
j embrace the world's largest collec
! tion of material on the Communist,
j Fascist, Nazi, and Socialist revolu
! toins, and their underground oppo
| sition. Many contemporary public
j figures have deposited sealed doc
i urnents to be opened in stipulated
I future years.
As a teaching institution the In
stitute ranks high. It offers the op
| portunity for young graduate stu
! dents to prepare themselves for
; governmental or private service in
â– international affairs.
The institute conducts research in
i many directions and has published
; 24 volumes of important material
; under its imprint.
Founded by Hoover
The Library was founded by Mr.
Hoover during hbs post-World War
I work to mitigate the suffering

caused to the people of the Low
Countries by the war. It was
founded as a part of Stanford Uni
versity for the study of the causes
and the consequences of war and
revolution and the problems of
peace.
During his service as Secretary of
Commerce and as President of the
United States, and since his retire
ment, he gave much of his time,
energy, and funds to the Library's
development.
At the dedication of the Tower in
'41 Mr. Hoover put into words his
hopes for the Library's usefulness:
'"Here are the records of the
world's effort to make peace. Here
are the proofs of the highest ideal
ism. And here are the records of
.selfishness and lowest trickery.
''Here can be ound the record of
the ideas nad forces which might
have made its success. Out of these
files the world can get great warn
ing of what not to do and what to
do the next time it assembles
around the peace table. True, there
must be brought to that table a con
cept of new human relations, a con
cept that substitutes peace for war.
But if the world is to have long
peace, that concept must ...id its
origins in human experience and
its inspiration in human idealism.
"And here are the documents
which record the suffering, the self
denial. te devotion, the heroic deer
of men. Surely from these records
there can be help to mankind in its
confusions and perplexities, and its
yearnings for peace."
