BULLETIN

CHICAGO. July 14 (UP) — The U.S. Steel Corporation tonight an
nounced that production facilities throughout the nation are being shut
down in the face of an impending strike by the CIO United Steel
Workers.

PITTSBURGH, July 14 (UP) — The nation's steelworkers were
set tonight for a strike against U.S. Steel Corp. and at least fou:
big independents after "Big Steel" again turned down President
Truman's plan for a 60-day peace truce.
The rank-and-file of the CIO United Steelworkers received

orders to strike r nday mici
night then waited to see whether
i U.S. Steel and the independent com
! panies would relent and go
with the President's plan.
Now that "Big Steel" has turned
i down the plan unless modified, th e
! lour big independents were expectec
to follow its action. If they do, a
strike of more than 350,000 steei -
' workers was almost a certainty.
CIO President Philip Murray rea
, the telegram to the White House if
! which U.S. Steel President Benja
min F. Fairless put down his ob
jections to acceptance of the peac.
, plan then told newsmen he had "n
I comment" to make.
1 Fairless pointed out that the Taft-
Hartley Act specifically prohibits
presidential fact-finding boards from,
recommending strike settlements.
And he is "unable to see" why the
President should want to appoint a
board with broader powers in tlve
present situation.
j He assured the President that the
big steel company had given "care
ful consideration" to his proposals.
"We are willing and anxious to
have operations continue uninter
ruptedly under the terms of these
present labor contracts," he said.
"We are most desirous of avoiding a
steel strike if possible. A lockout is
farthest from our thoughts."
The company's attitude was out
lined in the telegram delivered to
the White House soon after Mr
Truman told a news conference
there was nothing in the picture
now that would justify seeking ar.
80-day anti-strike injunction under
the Taft-Hartley Law.
He said that even if the nation
wide steel strikes come off Friday
midnight as scheduled, it would have
to go on for some time before it
could be termed a real national
emergency.
A spokesman for U.S. Steel said
the corporation's telegram should
not be interpreted as a "rejection"
of the President's proposal, but
rather as a "request for additional
advice."
! The answer by U.S. Steel to the
j President's second appeal to the in
dustry to continue operating under
its present contract until a fact
finding board can investigate its
wage-pension dispute, was expected
to set the pattern for Bethlehem
and Republic Steel.
