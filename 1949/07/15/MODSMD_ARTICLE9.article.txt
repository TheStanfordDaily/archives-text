## 
### 
LONDON, July 14 (UP). —The
Labor government announced today
that Britain will cut imports from I
the United States by 25 per cent this i
year in an effort to solve the men
acing economic crisis.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir ;
Stafford Cripps, who a week ago
announced temporary suspension of
all dollar imports, said today that
total purchases from the United
States this year will amount to only
$1,200,000,000, compared with $1,-
600.000,000 in 1948.
Speaking in the House of Com- 1
mons, Cripps forecast a $20,000,000
cut in American tobacco purchases !
and unspecified reductions in im- '
ports of American steel, timber, cot
ton. paper and pulp, and nonferrous
metals.
At the same time, he announced
a cut in the already-scanty sugar
ration and small increases in rations
of meat and butter. Cripps said that
the four-ounce-a-week candy ra
tion, ended earlier this year, would
be reimposed Aug. 14.
Cripps' comments on the steel in
dustry, looking toward proposed
nationalization, brought a sharp
challenge from Winston Churchill, 1

leader of the Conservative opposi- j
! tion.
Other Conservative spokesmen at
i tacked the government's socialist
policies, and predicted that the cuts
' announced today are '"only the pre- :
; cursors of worse conditions to
come."
A Labor attack on "greedy and
socially irresponsible elements" in
America brought a sharp reply from
Conservatie Robert Booth by. who
said that Britain is being "kept" by
! the United States, and added:
"11 you sponge on someone, you
I should try to be polite to them."
Cripps, opening Commons debate :
on the crisis while Commonwealth 1
finance ministers looked on from
the galleries, called for more pro- !
duction and lower costs to bail Brit- ;
ain out of her difficulties. He also j
opposed wage increases.
"It is only those with a total dis- !
regard for their own future welfare I
... or those who have an active j
desire to damage our economy who
will at the present time press for
general wage, salary, or profit in- :
' creases." Cripps said.
