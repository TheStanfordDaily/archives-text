# Fight Due on Arms Plan
## Predictions Point to Easy Passing of Atlantic Pact 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 17 (UP). —Sen. Edward Martin, R„ Pa., said today
the $1,1.50,000,000 plan to help rearm Atlantic Pact nations is "just a start,"
and that he will oppose it unless President Truman adopts a "definite
policy" to cut federal spending.
Sen. Millard Tydings, D., Md., took issue with Martin. He said that

►in the long run the arms program
will save the taxpayers money by
permitting cuts in home front de
fense spending.
At the same time Sen. Glen H.
Taylor, D., Ida., told a reporter he
would oppose the Security Pact. The
former Progressive party Vice-Pres
idential candidate said he would
make a Senate speech against it be
i cause he believes it violates the
principles of the United Nations.
The Senate resumes debate on the
pact tomorrow. A final vote is
scheduled Thursday or Friday. Both
friends and foes of the treaty pre
dict it will be ratified with only a
dozen dissents. But the related
arms program continues to draw,
fire, mainly on grounds stated b:
Martin, who generally has backec
administration foreign policy.
While supporting the pact, Martir
said the arms plan would cost
"more and more billions" over th-r
years, a fact that is giving him "the
greatest concern and worry."
"The worry is not over the ques
tion whether these countries should
be rearmed but whether, in view of
the present rate of federal spending
and our financial condition, we car.
possibly rearm these nations with
out destroying our own country,"
he said.
He said the nation faces a basic
decision on whether it will continue
to spend billions in Europe "to sup
port socialistic programs that are
proving day by day to be complete
failures." He maintained that it
might be better to "gamble" that
the pact alone, with its warning to
aggressors, would be enough to
avert another war.
