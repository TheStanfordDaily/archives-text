# Letters to the Editor
## Stolen Auto Parts 
### 
In regard to Miss Hackett's letter to the editor last week I would like
t< say this: Although she has a right to be burned about losing her fender
skirts, she shouldn't raise hell with the Stanford student.
I have been around here for a long time and have come to realize that
nearly every case of vandalism, particularly auto-stripping, can be blamed
on Palo Alto High School children. The rank immaturity of these young
sters is probably responsible for her missing skirts and not "social and
individual irresponsibility" on the part of a college student.
Yours for correct placement of blame,
A PALO ALTAN
