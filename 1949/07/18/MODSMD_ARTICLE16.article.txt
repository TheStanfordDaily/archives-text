To the Editor:
As an Indian and a Northern Californian I would like to ask Miss Elaine
Hackett to lay aside her tomahawk momentarily in regard to her automo
bile skirts that were recently stolen.
I heartily agree with Miss Hackett in her indignation and wrath against
anyone who would stoop to stealing car parts, but did you ever stop to
consider that it might not have been a Stanford student who purloined
your skirts? Last week some enterprising individual neatly removed the
water pump from my pre-New Deal era Ford while it was in the Encina
parking lot. After crying on the shoulder of the campus constabulary
those Keystone gentlemen pointed out that local high school lads have
been active removing what items are not welded on campus autos.
What the answer to our problem is, I don't know. We could cry in
each other's beer, but I still have faith in Stanford students and the honor
system.
