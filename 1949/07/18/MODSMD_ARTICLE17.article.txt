# Tough Guy Cronyn Directs, As Wife Governs General
## 
### 
(This is the second and last installment of Dunne Spilbury's story
on Hnme Cronyn and Akim Tamiroff.)
Mr. Cronyn played one of the equestrians in the John Cecil Holm play
"Three Men on a Horse," a hilarious hit made famous throughout the
country by the Marx Brothers only because Broadway never gets of!
Manhattan Island. In stock, he has played the lead in "Golden Boy" and
in the Spivack comedy "Boy Meets Girl."
In the movies, he has held a variety of parts including a rejected lover,
a duped lover, a German civilian during the Hitler regime, a French col
laborationist, and a sadistic chief guard in a state prison.
According tu Mrs. Cronyn, the last role, from a movie called "Brute
Force," has since brought some interesting results. It happened like this.
Despite diversity in casting, a Hollywood actor is very susceptible to being
typed by the public. Look at William Frawley, a gravel-voiced Irishman
who is invariably cast as a cop who apparently wouldn't be able to ma
triculate to the upper third grade. Look at George Raft. Mr. Raft has been
in pictures since Grant stormed Richmond and yet he has never succeeded
in looking like anything in the world but George Raft.
At all odds, in this picture, "Brute Force," the inmates of the prison
are made out to be hell-for-nice, clean-cut young lads who had un
doubtedly never done anything more lawless than to spit in the punch
at a Sunday school picnic. Mr. Cronyn, on the other hand, becomes, in
the picture (and permanently for a lot of people), a nasty little-man com
plex walking around behind the long arm of the law.
The immediate result of the picture's release was a number of "fan"
letters suggesting (1) Mr. Cronyn would get his some day. (2) (to his wife)
they were glad, very glad he'd got bumped off, and (3) he should drop
dead. Now while this was a fine tribute to the realism of his portrayal,
the attitude contained for Mr. Cronyn the possibility that some day a
vengeful movie-goer might have him investigated by the Federal Prison
Board—maybe even by the Un-American Activities Committee, which, as
any fool knows, is no small potatoes.
Personally, the Cronyns are very pleasant people. Miss Tandy is
startlingly attractive. In fact, with due apologies, she is what the average
man, 9-90. would give his right eye, seven front teeth, and his old age
security to find in his stocking some glorious, ecstatic Christmas morn.
Mr. Cronyn looks like a jovial burgermeister dispensing beers to the
troops amidst a shower of solid American coins. But, after all, he does
have a good deal to smile about.
At present, Mr. and Mrs. Cronyn are working together in a stage adap
tation of the Bemelmans novel "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep," which is
to be presented in the Memorial Auditorium on Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights.
Mrs. Cronyn plays the part of an English governess, the righteous right
hand of General Leonidas Erosa. who is given to vivid speculations on the
joys of dying, and who resents the implication that since the General
is too old himself to have a governess, since the General has no children,
hence the General must have a—c'est la vie. ouvrez la fenetre—to use
the French expression.
Mr. Cronyn, who is director of the play, employs, by way of capturing
the moods and character of the various parts, pieces of pantomimic direc
tion. For instance. The General in his views on sex is a child of nature.
Instead of brooding about sex "as does the Anglo-Saxon mind," the
General does something about it. In one particular scene, he attempts to
assure Senora Lopez that he is most grateful for her maidenly agreeable
ness. Already aroused, almost to the point of pawing the ground, the
General comes up behind Bebecita and makes a ferment promise The
scene goes something like this.
Walking up behind the Senora, whom he clutches about the waist,
Mr. Cronyn (acting the General) says big-heartedly: "Chi-cken! I am
like that net up there. If ever you should fall, I will always be here to
catch you." With that Bebecita murmurs fondly over her shoulder. The
General arches his neck. The neck muscles strain. His jaws open wide.
Then, with all the nethusiasm of a friendly crocodile, he makes as if to
sink his teeth into the ripe and willing shoulder.
The mood, believe me, is captured.

are made out to be hell-for-nice, clean-cut young lads who had un
doubtedly never done anything more lawless than to spit in the punch
at a Sunday school picnic. Mr. Cronyn, on the other hand, becomes, in
the picture (and permanently for a lot of people), a nasty little-man com
plex walking around behind the long arm of the law.
The immediate result of the picture's release was a number of "fan"
letters suggesting (1) Mr. Cronyn would get his some day. (2) (to his wife)
they were glad, very glad he'd got bumped off, and (3) he should drop
dead. Now while this was a fine tribute to the realism of his portrayal,
the attitude contained for Mr. Cronyn the possibility that some day a
vengeful movie-goer might have him investigated by the Federal Prison
Board—maybe even by the Un-American Activities Committee, which, as
any fool knows, is no small potatoes.
Personally, the Cronyns are very pleasant people. Miss Tandy is
startlingly attractive. In fact, with due apologies, she is what the average
man, 9-90. would give his right eye, seven front teeth, and his old age
security to find in his stocking some glorious, ecstatic Christmas morn.
Mr. Cronyn looks like a jovial burgermeister dispensing beers to the
troops amidst a shower of solid American coins. But, after all, he does
have a good deal to smile about.
At present, Mr. and Mrs. Cronyn are working together in a stage adap
tation of the Bemelmans novel "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep," which is
to be presented in the Memorial Auditorium on Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights.
Mrs. Cronyn plays the part of an English governess, the righteous right
hand of General Leonidas Erosa. who is given to vivid speculations on the
joys of dying, and who resents the implication that since the General
is too old himself to have a governess, since the General has no children,
hence the General must have a—c'est la vie. ouvrez la fenetre—to use
the French expression.
Mr. Cronyn, who is director of the play, employs, by way of capturing
the moods and character of the various parts, pieces of pantomimic direc
tion. For instance. The General in his views on sex is a child of nature.
Instead of brooding about sex "as does the Anglo-Saxon mind," the
General does something about it. In one particular scene, he attempts to
assure Senora Lopez that he is most grateful for her maidenly agreeable
ness. Already aroused, almost to the point of pawing the ground, the
General comes up behind Bebecita and makes a ferment promise The
scene goes something like this.
Walking up behind the Senora, whom he clutches about the waist,
Mr. Cronyn (acting the General) says big-heartedly: "Chi-cken! I am
like that net up there. If ever you should fall, I will always be here to
catch you." With that Bebecita murmurs fondly over her shoulder. The
General arches his neck. The neck muscles strain. His jaws open wide.
Then, with all the nethusiasm of a friendly crocodile, he makes as if to
sink his teeth into the ripe and willing shoulder.
The mood, believe me, is captured.
(This is the second and last installment of Dunne Spilbury's story
on Hnme Cronyn and Akim Tamiroff.)
Mr. Cronyn played one of the equestrians in the John Cecil Holm play
"Three Men on a Horse," a hilarious hit made famous throughout the
country by the Marx Brothers only because Broadway never gets of!
Manhattan Island. In stock, he has played the lead in "Golden Boy" and
in the Spivack comedy "Boy Meets Girl."
In the movies, he has held a variety of parts including a rejected lover,
a duped lover, a German civilian during the Hitler regime, a French col
laborationist, and a sadistic chief guard in a state prison.
According tu Mrs. Cronyn, the last role, from a movie called "Brute
Force," has since brought some interesting results. It happened like this.
Despite diversity in casting, a Hollywood actor is very susceptible to being
typed by the public. Look at William Frawley, a gravel-voiced Irishman
who is invariably cast as a cop who apparently wouldn't be able to ma
triculate to the upper third grade. Look at George Raft. Mr. Raft has been
in pictures since Grant stormed Richmond and yet he has never succeeded
in looking like anything in the world but George Raft.
At all odds, in this picture, "Brute Force," the inmates of the prison
are made out to be hell-for-nice, clean-cut young lads who had un
doubtedly never done anything more lawless than to spit in the punch
at a Sunday school picnic. Mr. Cronyn, on the other hand, becomes, in
