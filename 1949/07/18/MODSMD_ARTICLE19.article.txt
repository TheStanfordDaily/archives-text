## Time and Tide THE 						RED AND THE BLACK, A REASSESSMENT 
### 
TT>e analysis in this column last Friday of one or two facets of official
Catholic policy is known to have been interpreted contrary to intention.
For this I must apologize since any ideas so grossly misinterpreted must
have been poorly expressed.
A restatement of my views would seem to be in order. What follows
is written to answer specific objections received:
There was no criticism intended on the Catholic policy of excommuni
cating Communists. According to the inner order of Catholic orientation, i
this step was a logical one. Its use was merely an introduction to the fol
lowing comments.
The rest of the article was an exposition using Catholic and Commu
nist collective policies as examples. As a generalization, it is naturally
open to argument. I do not harbor pro- or anti-Catholic sentiments. To
my way of thinking, it is impossible to "judge" or evaluate any group of
individuals in an absolute manner. Such habits show a distinct lack of
sane orientation.
It is possible, however, to assess tentatively the effects of policies used j
by group ruling bodies. The general idea was to emphasize the effects of j
some institutional policies. As long as large organizations use their obvious j
power to mislead masses of people with abstractions which do not fit the i
facts we can expect the human race to be mired in its present difficulties, j
The reference to the Catholic attitude concerning birth control was j
perhaps unfortunate. It was meant only as an example of one debatable j
attitude, but since it is such a "live" issue, it tended to obscure the drift I
of the argument. All persons (including the writer) hold some question
able notions. It is desirable that these be examined rather than defended
as points of honor.
To sum up, there was no indiscriminate anti-Catholic attack implied :
or intended. I question rather some of the Catholic approaches to human
difficulties. Again, these doubts are open to rebuttal.
