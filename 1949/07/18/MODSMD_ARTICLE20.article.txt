To the Editor:
I believe Mr. Cloonan's article on the fight between Catholicism and
Communism warrants some comment. He demonstrates a lack of under
standing of the basic tenets of Communism when he asks for compromise
between the Church and Communsim.
Communism's economic interpretation of social institutions and struc
tures is not, as Mr. Cloonan states, merely habit; it is basic doctrine. All j
religion is considered to be of economic derivation and merely a tool by
which the masses are kept pacified in their subjection. Knowing this, and
in view of the very active campaign of persecution and slander of Catholi
cism at the present time, the Church has no other course than to declare
"total war" on Communism by excommunicating all Catholic Communists.
The two positions are, basically, utterly incompatible. Communism can
let religion exist only at the expense of their basic doctrines.
Evidently Mr. Cloonan objects to the fact that both Catholicism and
Communism stand so firmly by their doctrines (he speaks of their crystal- 1
lized brains). I find firmness in convictions within a given integrated
framework to be admirable. It is against the framework as a whole that
objection should be directed.
