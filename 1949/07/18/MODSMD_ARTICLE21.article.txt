## The 						Sports Desk Giant Pitchers Finally Come Through; But Leo Would Rather Feud with Team 
### 
The case of Leo Durocher vs. the New York Giants is still undecided
nit the effect of this petty bickering between manager and players is
•videnced by the apathetic play of the New Yorkers and their inability to
vin consistently.
In fact, Leo's activities following his return after a year's suspension
esemble a success story in reverse.
Midway through last season he left Brooklyn and became manager of
potentially powerful Giant team, and was thus presented with the j
pportunity of proving his managerial ability.
Let's review the set-up which faced Leo. In '47 and '48 the Giants were
trictly a heavy-hitting club. With the exception of ex-Seal Larry Jansen,
he hurling staff was erratic and unreliable. Many a ball game was won
y merely out-hitting the opposition.
Johnny Mize, Walker Cooper, Willard Marshall, and Bobby Thomson
lie setting all kinds of home run records. These men represented the
leatest concentration of batting power since Ruth and Gehrig.
Pitching Was the Problem
The fly in the ointment was the pitching. Mize and Co. would build
p a lead and then along about the third inning the starting pitcher would
low up. This would start the usual parade of relief hurlers from the
nil pen, and the game would eventually be lost in the ninth when the
inning run would score on a wild pitch.
The Giants were pennant contenders in '47 and '48 until early July when
ey developed the habit of going into a nosedive. It was just after last
ason's nosedive that Leo took over. He finished out the season as man
;er, but the Giants were already out ol the race so his big test didn t
me until this year.
At the start of this season pitching was the question mark once again,
ost experts conceded that the Giants would be contenders if the pitchers
me through.
Well, the moundsmen did come through. Monte Kennedy, Clint Har
ng. Sheldon Jones, and Dave Koslo joined with Jansen to provide the
am with steady hurling. Giant fans had waited a long time and they
;ured this was their year.
Cooper Is Peddled to Reds
Then Leo started feuding with the players. He couldn't get along with
alker Cooper so he sold him to Cincinnati. He benched Mize, shortstop
Idv Kerr, Bill Rigney, and Marshall and inserted a'bunch of untried
kies in the lineup.
The effects were immediate. The Giants went into their annual nose
a month earlier than usual and it was only then that Leo put the
ulars back in.
On July 3 when the Giants took the field against the Dodgers, it was
ly the sixth time that Durocher had used the lineup that set home run
cords under Ott last year. The vets responded by banging base hits all
er the lot and submerging the Dodgers 16 to 0.
The great Durocher had been wrong but it had taken him two months
realize it. It seems hard to understand how one man could break up a
tential pennant-winning team, but Leo has succeeded in doing just that.
At present the Giants are ten games off the pace going nowhere fast,
i Leo still has problems; he may have to trade Mize and Kerr. He
.sn't get along with them either.

The Giants were pennant contenders in '47 and '48 until early July when
ey developed the habit of going into a nosedive. It was just after last
ason's nosedive that Leo took over. He finished out the season as man
;er, but the Giants were already out ol the race so his big test didn t
me until this year.
At the start of this season pitching was the question mark once again,
ost experts conceded that the Giants would be contenders if the pitchers
me through.
Well, the moundsmen did come through. Monte Kennedy, Clint Har
ng. Sheldon Jones, and Dave Koslo joined with Jansen to provide the
am with steady hurling. Giant fans had waited a long time and they
;ured this was their year.
Cooper Is Peddled to Reds
Then Leo started feuding with the players. He couldn't get along with
alker Cooper so he sold him to Cincinnati. He benched Mize, shortstop
Idv Kerr, Bill Rigney, and Marshall and inserted a'bunch of untried
kies in the lineup.
The effects were immediate. The Giants went into their annual nose
a month earlier than usual and it was only then that Leo put the
ulars back in.
On July 3 when the Giants took the field against the Dodgers, it was
ly the sixth time that Durocher had used the lineup that set home run
cords under Ott last year. The vets responded by banging base hits all
er the lot and submerging the Dodgers 16 to 0.
The great Durocher had been wrong but it had taken him two months
realize it. It seems hard to understand how one man could break up a
tential pennant-winning team, but Leo has succeeded in doing just that.
At present the Giants are ten games off the pace going nowhere fast,
i Leo still has problems; he may have to trade Mize and Kerr. He
.sn't get along with them either.
The case of Leo Durocher vs. the New York Giants is still undecided
nit the effect of this petty bickering between manager and players is
•videnced by the apathetic play of the New Yorkers and their inability to
vin consistently.
In fact, Leo's activities following his return after a year's suspension
esemble a success story in reverse.
Midway through last season he left Brooklyn and became manager of
potentially powerful Giant team, and was thus presented with the j
pportunity of proving his managerial ability.
Let's review the set-up which faced Leo. In '47 and '48 the Giants were
trictly a heavy-hitting club. With the exception of ex-Seal Larry Jansen,
he hurling staff was erratic and unreliable. Many a ball game was won
y merely out-hitting the opposition.
Johnny Mize, Walker Cooper, Willard Marshall, and Bobby Thomson
lie setting all kinds of home run records. These men represented the
leatest concentration of batting power since Ruth and Gehrig.
Pitching Was the Problem
The fly in the ointment was the pitching. Mize and Co. would build
p a lead and then along about the third inning the starting pitcher would
low up. This would start the usual parade of relief hurlers from the
nil pen, and the game would eventually be lost in the ninth when the
inning run would score on a wild pitch.
