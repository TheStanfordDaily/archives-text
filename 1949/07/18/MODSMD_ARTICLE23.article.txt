### 
SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 (UP). I
â€”The San Francisco Seals parlayed
two singles into a sixth-inning run
to bat the Seattle Rainiers 1-0 in
the second game of a Pacific Coast
League doubleheader after the Rai
niers had won the opener 6-2 be
fore a crowd of 7.565 fans.
Denny Galehouse, Suds right
hander, had a no-hit, no-run game
going into the sixth inning of the
second game when Leroy Jarvis
beat out an infield hit that skit
tered over the pitcher's head. He
was sacrificed to second by Roy
Nicely and to third by Manny Perez
and scored on Jackie Tobin's single
to center, the only other hit off
Galehouse.
The Rainiers were held to five
hits by Perez, who notched his sixth
victory of the year.
The game was played in one hour
21 minutes.
