It was learned from Mr. Cronyn
that the play is one of the largest
productions ever handled in Stan
fold's Memorial Auditorium. "The
staging ir. one scene alone involves
a set of three rooms and an exterior
scene. Such a production requires
tlie split-timing of a large organi
sation."
Reports from the two agencies
handling the ticket sales indicate
that the ducats for all performances
have been sold out.
