# Supreme Court Justice Dies Unexpectedly
## 
### 
DETROIT, July 19 (UP). —
Frank Murphy, hard - fighting
Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court and U.S. Attorney
General in the hey-day of the
New Deal, died unexpectedly
today. He was 56.
Death of the red-haired, bushy
browed friend of labor was attrib
uted to a heart ailment, which had
curtailed his activities during the
last two sessions of the high court.
Murphy had undergone periodic
treatment under the name "Francis
Williams" at Henry Ford Hospital
for "about a month" and had re
entered the hospital only last night,
doctors said.
A nurse making a routine check
discovered the former U.S. Attor
ney General, High Commissioner of
the Philippines, and Governor of
Michigan semi - conscious as she
made her morning rounds. Murphy,
a bachelor, died 45 minutes later
with his brother and sister-in-law,
Recorder's Judge and Mrs. George
Murphy, at his bedside.
At Washington, Chief Justice
Fred Vinson revealed that Murphy
had been on the verge of death "for
months."
Dr. Wayne Parkinson, assistant
hospital superintendent, said death
was caused by coronary occlusion.
He said Murphy had "seemed all
right" when he retired last night
and had not complained of feeling
ill.
His career in politics and on the
bench spanned 30 years, from the
time he became an assistant federal
attorney in 1919 until his death.
Named to the Supreme Court as
Mr. Roosevelt's fifth appointee in
February 1940, the fiery Murphy
never ceased to champion the rights
of the individual, although his
strength waned so badly that he
failed to return to Washington until
two months after the present court
term began.
Known as the "extreme liberal''
of the high bench, he had been a
member of a loose minority bloc
since President Truman's appoint
ment of more conservative justices.
Early speculation about a possible
successor centered around the
names of Attorney General Tom C.
Clark and Senators J. Howard Mc-
Gi'ath, D., R. 1.; Brian McMahon, D.,
Conn.; Joseph C. O'Mahoney, D.,
Wyo.; and Francis J. Myers, D., Pa.
All except Clark are Catholics.
Observers believed that by tradi
tion, President Truman might se
lect a Catholic to replace Murphy,
the only justice of that faith on the
high tribunal.

Frank Murphy, hard - fighting
Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court and U.S. Attorney
General in the hey-day of the
New Deal, died unexpectedly
today. He was 56.
Death of the red-haired, bushy
browed friend of labor was attrib
uted to a heart ailment, which had
curtailed his activities during the
last two sessions of the high court.
Murphy had undergone periodic
treatment under the name "Francis
Williams" at Henry Ford Hospital
for "about a month" and had re
entered the hospital only last night,
doctors said.
A nurse making a routine check
discovered the former U.S. Attor
ney General, High Commissioner of
the Philippines, and Governor of
Michigan semi - conscious as she
made her morning rounds. Murphy,
a bachelor, died 45 minutes later
with his brother and sister-in-law,
Recorder's Judge and Mrs. George
Murphy, at his bedside.
At Washington, Chief Justice
Fred Vinson revealed that Murphy
had been on the verge of death "for
months."
Dr. Wayne Parkinson, assistant
hospital superintendent, said death
was caused by coronary occlusion.
He said Murphy had "seemed all
right" when he retired last night
and had not complained of feeling
ill.
His career in politics and on the
bench spanned 30 years, from the
time he became an assistant federal
attorney in 1919 until his death.
Named to the Supreme Court as
Mr. Roosevelt's fifth appointee in
February 1940, the fiery Murphy
never ceased to champion the rights
of the individual, although his
strength waned so badly that he
failed to return to Washington until
two months after the present court
term began.
Known as the "extreme liberal''
of the high bench, he had been a
member of a loose minority bloc
since President Truman's appoint
ment of more conservative justices.
Early speculation about a possible
successor centered around the
names of Attorney General Tom C.
Clark and Senators J. Howard Mc-
Gi'ath, D., R. 1.; Brian McMahon, D.,
Conn.; Joseph C. O'Mahoney, D.,
Wyo.; and Francis J. Myers, D., Pa.
All except Clark are Catholics.
Observers believed that by tradi
tion, President Truman might se
lect a Catholic to replace Murphy,
the only justice of that faith on the
high tribunal.
