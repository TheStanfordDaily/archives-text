Church vs. Communism
(The Daily has received a number of letters on Ted Cloonan's column,
"Time and Tide," concerning the Catholic Church and the Communists.
We are printing Mr. Freiling's letter as representative of and more com
prehensive than the other letters.â€”Ed.) r
Dear Mr. Cloonan:
I have lead, re-read, and puzzled considerably over your article en
titled "The Red and the Black" appearing in last Friday's Daily. I am
sure that you do not mean to hurl cowardly innuendos while seeking
refuge behind a bulwark of ambiguity. I believe that you have enough
courage of your convictions to clarify your position. Therefore I should
like to ask you six straightforward questions and receive in return six
straightforward answers.
1. Throughout your article you seem to imply that Catholicism and
Communism are on the same plane, even referring to them as "two great
institutions." I cannot tell whether you mean this to be sincerity or sar
casm. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT COMMUNISM IS NOBLE OR THAT
CATHOLICISM IS IGNOMINIOUS?
2. You seem to be of the opinion that the Catholic Church should re
strict itself to purely democratic legislation. Now the Catholic Church
maintains that the ex cathedra pronouncements of the Pope on matters
of faith and morals are infallible. The Pope interprets the will of God
from Scriptures and from tradition under divine guidance. It would be
foolish to seek infallibility in the vox populi. DO YOU MAINTAIN THAT
AIORALS ARE MAN-MADE AND THEREFORE PURELY SUBJECTIVE
AND WITH NO BASIS IN REALITY?
3. You seem to think that the principal issues in the battle between
Communism and Catholicism amount to no more than "economic and
political paradoxes." Catholics strive to follow Christ, Who they believe
i:; God, and the code of ethics which He established. Communists follow
Marx and Lenin, who claim there is no God and advocate many violations
of Christian ethics. WOULD YOU CALL THIS AN ECONOMIC PARA
DOX OR A POLITICAL PARADOX?
4. You state that "to cast loose from the Isle of Dogma on the Ship of
Reason seems an unthought-of adventure." Few people seem to realize
that Catholic dogma merely represents the postulates and theorems of
Catholic: philosophy. WOULD NOT YOUR SHIP OF REASON BE QUITE
AT SEA WITHOUT ISLES OF POSTULATES FROM WHICK TO EM
BARK AND ISLES OF THEOREMS AT WHICH TO MAKE PORT?
5. You also state that "The habit of referring every aspect of social
life to an economic interpretation ... is a well-known Communist tech
nique. IS NOT THE SIZE OF ONE'S FAMILY AN ASPECT OF SOCIAL
LIFE WHICH YOU HAVE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF WORLD
FOOD ECONOMY?
G. You seem to believe that the recent Papal pronouncement "encour
ages mass reaction on a signal level. The opposite stands of Catholicism
and Communism are nothing really new, you know. Excommunication
bars one from the sacraments; and the sacraments, except, of course,
baptism, are administered only to Catholics. The Church has certainly
published enough literature on Communism to enable anyone to realize
that a Catholic Communist is a non-existent entity and that anyone who
embraces Communism de facto relinquishes his rights to the sacraments.
ARE NOT ATHEISM AND THEISM MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TERMS?
If jumbled facts, faulty logic, vague presentation, ancl poor taste are
any criterion of bad journalism, it is difficult for me to imagine how one
could get oft to a worse start than you have.
Sineerelv,
EDWARD C. FREILING
