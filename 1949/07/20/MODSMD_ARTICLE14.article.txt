# Film Executive Tells of Movie-Making
## 
### 
Charles Palmer, Hollywood cine
ma executive, gave a behind-the
scenes talk on movie making in the
Little Theater Monday night.
He told his audience that some
238 different arts and trades go into
the making of a movie, and de
scribed some of the difficulties en
countered in a film's production.
Pdlmer, who worked on such
movies as "House on 92nd Street"
and "Boomerang," recently followed
the filming of "The Stratton Story."
It was by this picture that he illus

; trated his talk.
He mentioned the difficulties en
| countered by authors trying to get
I their stuff accepted, and the trouble
met in controlling sound on loca
! tion where there are all sorts of
; odd noises.
Touching on the astronomical sal
aries paid the stars, he pointed out
that it was a matter of prestige for
a star to have a higher salary than
his competitors. This results in a
vicious circle that accounts for the
fabulous salaries now in vogue.
