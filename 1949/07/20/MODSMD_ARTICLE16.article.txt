Dear Mr. Freiling:
I have chosen to answer your letter from among those deceived because
it is the most inclusive. It will become clear to you that while we have
entirely different bases of judgment, my original thought was not to con
demn the Church, but to question policies both of that organization and
of the Communists.
Answer 1: (a) TTie Catholic Church and the Communist organizations
(in toto) are not identical. In my opinion, they do both operate against
independence of thought and the scientific solution of economic and social
problems, (b) The phrase "two great institutions" implies "two large in
stitutions." I refer you to the Webster Collegiate Dictionary, (c) The
words "noble" and "ignominious" are evaluative terms having many
meanings. I do not understand your precise implication.
Answer 2: Again, the word "morals" without a specific listing is hard
to deal with. In so far as I understand you, I agree that "morals" are
not simply manufactured ethics. However, only the "morals" of Catholics
are refcrrable to the Pope. Therefore, your question is two-valued (ex
cludes a third possibility) and false to facts.
Answer 3: I do not tend to interpret the Catholic-Communist struggle
in terms of religion vs. atheism. Rather does it appear to be the conflict
oi two authoritarian systems. However, the methods of these two systems
differ. They are not simply "the same thing."
Answer 4: The choice of metaphors was unfortunate. You are correct
in indicating that every idea-structure is grounded on postulates which
are taken for granted.
Answer 5: This question again shows your two-valued approach to
many-valued problems. You are surely aware that the family as a social
gioup is highly conditioned by wide-scale marginal living (starvation,
miserable housing, etc.) and major social upheavals (war, revolution, etc.).
These are factors which the Catholics, to my present knowledge, refuse
to take into account in the practical resolution of the family problem. This
is not to limit the family to an economic interpretation.
Answer 6: (a) It is the long-time policies, and not the recent Papal
pronouncement, which encourage mass reaction on an unthinking level.
The edict of excommunication will, on the other hand, present a difficult
conflict which may force many to assess both sides of the question—and
perhaps find a third answer, (b) Atheism and theism are exclusive terms
which obscure more than they clarify. When a Communist says he is an
atheist, it is a sign of ignorant posture or psychological warfare. When a
non-Communist says he is a theist he can be anything from a sinner to
a saint, a moron to a genius, a despot to a democrat.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your letter. If the original
article was ambiguous it certainly deserved criticism. I deeply regret
the persecutions which many European Catholics are subjected to. The
sooner a way is found to alleviate their condition the happier we will all
be. It is not desirable, however, to call the Communists "Anti-Christ" and
proceed to foment a religious war.

non-Communist says he is a theist he can be anything from a sinner to
a saint, a moron to a genius, a despot to a democrat.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your letter. If the original
article was ambiguous it certainly deserved criticism. I deeply regret
the persecutions which many European Catholics are subjected to. The
sooner a way is found to alleviate their condition the happier we will all
be. It is not desirable, however, to call the Communists "Anti-Christ" and
proceed to foment a religious war.
Dear Mr. Freiling:
I have chosen to answer your letter from among those deceived because
it is the most inclusive. It will become clear to you that while we have
entirely different bases of judgment, my original thought was not to con
demn the Church, but to question policies both of that organization and
of the Communists.
Answer 1: (a) TTie Catholic Church and the Communist organizations
(in toto) are not identical. In my opinion, they do both operate against
independence of thought and the scientific solution of economic and social
problems, (b) The phrase "two great institutions" implies "two large in
stitutions." I refer you to the Webster Collegiate Dictionary, (c) The
words "noble" and "ignominious" are evaluative terms having many
meanings. I do not understand your precise implication.
Answer 2: Again, the word "morals" without a specific listing is hard
to deal with. In so far as I understand you, I agree that "morals" are
not simply manufactured ethics. However, only the "morals" of Catholics
are refcrrable to the Pope. Therefore, your question is two-valued (ex
cludes a third possibility) and false to facts.
Answer 3: I do not tend to interpret the Catholic-Communist struggle
in terms of religion vs. atheism. Rather does it appear to be the conflict
oi two authoritarian systems. However, the methods of these two systems
differ. They are not simply "the same thing."
Answer 4: The choice of metaphors was unfortunate. You are correct
in indicating that every idea-structure is grounded on postulates which
are taken for granted.
Answer 5: This question again shows your two-valued approach to
many-valued problems. You are surely aware that the family as a social
gioup is highly conditioned by wide-scale marginal living (starvation,
miserable housing, etc.) and major social upheavals (war, revolution, etc.).
These are factors which the Catholics, to my present knowledge, refuse
to take into account in the practical resolution of the family problem. This
is not to limit the family to an economic interpretation.
Answer 6: (a) It is the long-time policies, and not the recent Papal
pronouncement, which encourage mass reaction on an unthinking level.
The edict of excommunication will, on the other hand, present a difficult
conflict which may force many to assess both sides of the question—and
perhaps find a third answer, (b) Atheism and theism are exclusive terms
which obscure more than they clarify. When a Communist says he is an
atheist, it is a sign of ignorant posture or psychological warfare. When a
non-Communist says he is a theist he can be anything from a sinner to
a saint, a moron to a genius, a despot to a democrat.
