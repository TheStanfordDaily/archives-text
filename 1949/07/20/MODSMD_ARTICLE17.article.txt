# Four Horsemen Baffled Cards In Rose Bowl
## 
### MORTY NOVICK 
A Notre Dame tidal wave swept
over Pasadena's broad gridiron
panorama on New Year's Day, 1925.
Stanford was caught on the fervid
crest of this wave and once again
tasted the bile of defeat in a memo
rable, rock - crushing Rose Bowl
game which saw 'The Fighting Ir
ish" outscore the Indians, 27-10.
The fabled Four Horsemen —
Layden, Crowley, Miller, and Stuhl
dreher—did it. Stuhldreher, who
handled the football with mysteri
ous ease, played the entire game
with a broken ankle. And Layden!
He was magnificent and seemed to
be three Red Granges and a mule
rolled into one. scoring three touch- '
downs on scintillating runs of 60.
70, and 10 yards.

Warner's Victory
It was a typical "Pop" Warner ]
victory, however. The Old Fox of !
the West had the game won in \
every department of straight foot- 1
ball, but the Blue and Gold waited
for their opportunity and then :
struck swiftly and decisively like
wolves on the fold.
The Indians scored first when
Cuddeback, hero of a 20-20 tie with
California, kicked a field goal from ;
the 20-yard stripe.
At this point Rockne called on
his Horsemen.
"Get in there, boys, and show
them what those press releases were 1
all about," Rockne shouted in his j
accustomed bravado.
With the ball deep in Notre Dame I
territory, quarterback Solomon's in- '
tended pass to Nevers was inter- ;
cepted by Layden who outraced the j
entire Stanford secondary for a 70- '
yard touchdown. Crowley missed
the conversion and the Irish led. )
6-3. >
Layden (Joes Over
Minutes later Layden scored ]
again, bucking his way over from
the three. This time Crowley's con- I
version was good.
In the third period the Irish took
advantage of another break when i
quarterback Solomon butterfingered
a punt on his own 20. As he at
tempted to recover the ball Hun
singer canle out of nowhere, rudely •
shoved him aside, and crossed the j
goal line as lonesome as a ship
wrecked sailor.
Ernie Nevei's, who played bril
liantly for Stanford throughout the
contest, finally scored a touchdown,
taking a pass from Walker in the
'eft fiat and racing the remaining I
eight yards unmolested.
65 Yards to Score
The game was brought to a
pulse-throbbing climax in the last
quarter when Layden and Crowley
brought the huge mob to its feet
with an unbelievable play.
Nevers passed directly over cen
ter but Crowley leaped high into
the air and tapped the ball to Lay
den. The Horseman was nailed mo
mentarily by Mitchell and Johnston
on the 28. but shook them off like a
man throwing off his overcoat and
went 65 yards for a touchdown, get
ting past tackles in a ghost - like
manner.
Stanford had a weight and height j
advantage over the Irish and as
Coach Andy Kerr said "were in the
best shape of the season." But when
the going got rough Notre Dame
fought with the tenacity that is so
characteristic of them.

the conversion and the Irish led. )

Layden (Joes Over
Minutes later Layden scored ]
again, bucking his way over from
the three. This time Crowley's con- I
version was good.
In the third period the Irish took
advantage of another break when i
quarterback Solomon butterfingered
a punt on his own 20. As he at
tempted to recover the ball Hun
singer canle out of nowhere, rudely •
shoved him aside, and crossed the j
goal line as lonesome as a ship
wrecked sailor.
Ernie Nevei's, who played bril
liantly for Stanford throughout the
contest, finally scored a touchdown,
taking a pass from Walker in the
'eft fiat and racing the remaining I
eight yards unmolested.
65 Yards to Score
The game was brought to a
pulse-throbbing climax in the last
quarter when Layden and Crowley
brought the huge mob to its feet
with an unbelievable play.
Nevers passed directly over cen
ter but Crowley leaped high into
the air and tapped the ball to Lay
den. The Horseman was nailed mo
mentarily by Mitchell and Johnston
on the 28. but shook them off like a
man throwing off his overcoat and
went 65 yards for a touchdown, get
ting past tackles in a ghost - like
manner.
Stanford had a weight and height j
advantage over the Irish and as
Coach Andy Kerr said "were in the
best shape of the season." But when
the going got rough Notre Dame
fought with the tenacity that is so
characteristic of them.
A Notre Dame tidal wave swept
over Pasadena's broad gridiron
panorama on New Year's Day, 1925.
Stanford was caught on the fervid
crest of this wave and once again
tasted the bile of defeat in a memo
rable, rock - crushing Rose Bowl
game which saw 'The Fighting Ir
ish" outscore the Indians, 27-10.
The fabled Four Horsemen —
Layden, Crowley, Miller, and Stuhl
dreher—did it. Stuhldreher, who
handled the football with mysteri
ous ease, played the entire game
with a broken ankle. And Layden!
He was magnificent and seemed to
be three Red Granges and a mule
rolled into one. scoring three touch- '
downs on scintillating runs of 60.
70, and 10 yards.

Warner's Victory
It was a typical "Pop" Warner ]
victory, however. The Old Fox of !
the West had the game won in \
every department of straight foot- 1
ball, but the Blue and Gold waited
for their opportunity and then :
struck swiftly and decisively like
wolves on the fold.
The Indians scored first when
Cuddeback, hero of a 20-20 tie with
California, kicked a field goal from ;
the 20-yard stripe.
At this point Rockne called on
his Horsemen.
"Get in there, boys, and show
them what those press releases were 1
all about," Rockne shouted in his j
accustomed bravado.

territory, quarterback Solomon's in- '
