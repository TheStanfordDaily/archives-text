NEW YORK, July 19.—The battering Buckeyes of Ohio State
loomed large today on this fall's college football horizon as a
likely candidate for Big Nine honors and the mythical national
championship.
As the grid training season approached, Notre Dame's perennial

| candidacy seemed to be destined for
I rough treatment, and Michigan's
j two-time champion Wolverines ap
j peared to lack the old depth which
1 carried them to two conference
; championships and a share in na
! tional honors.
Sectional standouts as prophesied
| were:
Bis Nine—Ohio State.
Pacific Coast—Stanford.
Southwest — Southern Metho
dist.
East—Army.
Southern Conference — North
Carolina.
Southeastern Conference — Tu
lane.
Midlands—Oklahoma.
Rockies—Utah State.
But the word from the Midwest
i is that Ohio State may wind up
| head and shoulders over the na
tional pack. The Buckeyes have
; eight regulars back among their 24
; lettermeh. Added to that power are
sophomores from Ohio State's
I "greatest freshman team," headed
■ by halfback Vic Janowicz.
Northwestern and Minnesota loom
as Big Nine possibilities. The Gold-
I en Gophers again have a great line.
but the backs will be slow and
| light.
Notre Dame is weak at tackle end
guard and has an uncertain back-
I field. The defeat which Frank
Leahy has been predicting for two
, years could arrive at any time.
Stanford, bolstered in another
great frosh team, will have to bat
tle Southern C'al and California
all the way—with Washington, a
seven - time loser last year, the
dark horse.
Headed by two-time All-Ameri
can Doak Walker. SMU needs line
strengthening. Texas will be tough
with good-sized line replacements.

The threat is TCU. an all-veteran
outfit headed by triple-threat Berry.
Army again rates, as the Eastern
juggernaut. The backfield will be
one of the best in the nation with
Arnold Galiffa. Sugarfoot Jim Cain,
and Gil Stephenson. Big Dan Fold
berg anchors the line and is a sure
shot All - American. Cornell's Big
Red, all-veteran and bolstered by
great freshman stars, will be right
in there.
Choo Choo Charley Justice again
spearheads the North Carolina at
tack in the Southern Conference
with Clemson, Duke, and Wake
Forest as title threats and loaded
Maryland rated as the dark horse.

NEW YORK, July 19.—The battering Buckeyes of Ohio State
loomed large today on this fall's college football horizon as a
likely candidate for Big Nine honors and the mythical national
championship.
As the grid training season approached, Notre Dame's perennial

| candidacy seemed to be destined for
I rough treatment, and Michigan's
j two-time champion Wolverines ap
j peared to lack the old depth which
1 carried them to two conference
; championships and a share in na
! tional honors.
Sectional standouts as prophesied
| were:
Bis Nine—Ohio State.
Pacific Coast—Stanford.
Southwest — Southern Metho
dist.
East—Army.
Southern Conference — North
Carolina.
Southeastern Conference — Tu
lane.
Midlands—Oklahoma.
Rockies—Utah State.
But the word from the Midwest
i is that Ohio State may wind up
| head and shoulders over the na
tional pack. The Buckeyes have
; eight regulars back among their 24
; lettermeh. Added to that power are
sophomores from Ohio State's
I "greatest freshman team," headed
■ by halfback Vic Janowicz.
Northwestern and Minnesota loom
as Big Nine possibilities. The Gold-
I en Gophers again have a great line.
but the backs will be slow and
| light.
Notre Dame is weak at tackle end
guard and has an uncertain back-
I field. The defeat which Frank
Leahy has been predicting for two
, years could arrive at any time.
Stanford, bolstered in another
great frosh team, will have to bat
tle Southern C'al and California
all the way—with Washington, a
seven - time loser last year, the
dark horse.
Headed by two-time All-Ameri
can Doak Walker. SMU needs line
strengthening. Texas will be tough
with good-sized line replacements.

The threat is TCU. an all-veteran
