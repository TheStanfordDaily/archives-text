# Goethe Exhibition Contrasts Humanitarianism and Naziism
## 
### 
Currently on display in the Main Libe is an imposing array of
books, pamphlets, sketches, and musical scores relating to Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe.
The display was arranged by Joseph Belloli, head of the refer
ence division of the library, in observance of the great human-

ist's bi-centennial. It is composed of
volumes from the University Li
brary and from the Bender Room, a
collection of rare books.
The display was also intended, in
conjunction with the last display,
one on Nazi propaganda methods,
to contrast two ideals. That is, com
pare Goethe, the humanist, and his
theories and concepts of a form of
society based on certain ethical
points of view, with Hitler and his
supernationalistic. totalitarian soci
ety.
Included in the display are copies
of Goethe's "Faust" in both German
and English, a facsimile of an origi
nal, hand - engrossed and orna
mented page of "Faust" done in the
German script by Johann Holz of
Flensburg.
Photostats of a number of origi
nal sketches by Goethe from the
Goethe National Museum of Wei
mar and a photostat of a musical
score by Goethe lend verification to
the thought that Goethe was a per
son "complete" in the arts. That is,
able with the brush, pen, and com
poser's quill.
In the exhibition there are a
number of books written in Ger
man that cover the various phases
of the humanist's life. One, "Goethe
als Seher und Erforscher der Na
tur," tells of Goethe as a botanist
as does "Goethe, die Metamorphose
der Pflanzen."
Extolling Goethe's virtues as a
musician is a hefty volume, "Die
Tonkunst in Goethes Leben," and
giving an account of his travels in
Italy is "Goethes Italienische Reise."
The display, dedicated to the man
who couldn't tolerate ignorance and
who said as he died, "Open the
blind ... so that more light may
come in," will run through July 31.
