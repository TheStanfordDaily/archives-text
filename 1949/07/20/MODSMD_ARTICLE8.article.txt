# ASSU All-Campus Beach Frolic at Seacliff Sunday
## 
### 
First all-campus party-time of the quarter is the ASSU-spon
sored beach party, scheduled for Sunday afternoon at Seacliff
Beach. It is planned to run from 12:30 to 6 p.m.
Price for the affair will be 50 cents, payable in advance, and
will entitle the student to a ticket, potato chips, volleyball, trans-

portation (if he desperately need-i
it), and a whole lot of free beer.
Some students might (and legiti
mately) pose the question, "Hou
does a guy get to Seacliff?"
For the benefit of those students
here are some directions:
Get some cash, get a car, and
start off on the road to Santa Cruz
That is, go down El Camino to Sun
nyvale, turn right, and continue to
Saratoga. At Saratoga turn left and
go over the mountains to Santa
Cruz. At the first stop light in San
ta Cruz, turn left. Follow this roac
to the turn-off to Seacliff Beach
The beach is a wee bit south ot
S'Cruz and immediately north o:
Rio del Mar.
The time to leave the campus is
about 11 a.m. or thereabouts. "The
party starts at 12:30 and it takes ar
hour and a half to get there, sc
leave early," said Lois Croonquist
Soc Com head, in a plea to start the
thing off with a bang.
Tickets may be bought at the
ASSU office in the Union or in tht
living groups but, according to Miss
Croonquist, "they are going fast sc
you better hurry." Anyway, ticket
sales will end Thursday at 5 p.m.
"Buddy Scott, campus Hawaiian,
will emcee any and all entertain
ment and will lead whatever sing
ing is sung," continued Miss Croon
quist. Soc Com recommended that
students bring their ukes, banjos,
guitars, harps, and other similar in
struments.
"If a student thinks that his hun
ger will be too great to be satisfied
by the planned refreshments he
would do well to bring a sandwich,
or a bagel or something, although
there is a place to buy stuff down
there," said Veronica Szego, one of
the three refreshments chairmen.
Jean All red, transportation chair
man, made a point of saying that
"students should tell what manner
of transportation they have when,
they buy their tickets."
