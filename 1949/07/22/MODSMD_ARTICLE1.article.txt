# 'Drama of Contrasts' Premiere Opens Here
## 
### 
"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep." opening
last night in the Stanford Memorial Auditorium,
can justly be called a drama of contrasts.
Directed by Hume Cronyn, actor and scenar
ist from Hollywood, it is on the surface a ca
pricious comedy drawn around the life of a
general who is able to live sumptuously while
in comparative safety in a French villa that is
already under the shadow of the advancing
German armies. He prefers at the same time
to share this life with Miss Graves, a woman
who is gaily oblivious to everything but sacri
ficing herself to him, and longing to know the
beauty of death—in England.
The humor to be found in this situation is
fully exploited by the airy repartee that is done
with a delicate and almost rippling touch in
certain scenes.
Beneath this surface in the darker eddies,
however, there is the conflict, always restive
and unresolved, between his flippantly sensual
treatment of life and her idealization of a no
man's world that could never exist.
Akim Tamiroff, in the part of the general,
brought out with a great skill, marred only in
several places by line-bobs, the nature of a man
who was human enough to - feel sympathy for
the lonely Miss Graves.

Jessica Tandy, as Miss Graves, had at once
I a charm and a balance necessary to keep such
a part fiom lapsing into sentimentality. It was
i this naivete cf a dreamer and idealist, so well
brought out by Miss Tandy, which created the
contrast between herself and the bawdy gen-
I eral. Around this the life of the two persons
1 turned.
Milton Parsons, who was cast in the role
of a Polish refugee, gave an excellent perform
-1 ance of a bemused man, haunted by the fear of
his German pursuers. Other members of the
supporting cast included Jeanne Bates as Doha
| Bebecita, the flirtatious wife of the general's
cousin. Chimene, a servant girl to the general,
was played by Roberta Haynes with a coyness
j that was immediately infectious.
General Erosa's villa proved a versatile set
ting with its sliding panels that permitted va
riety in scene changes and continuity. De
signed by Wendell Cole and painted by Harry
Cumming, the settings of Cronyn's production,
' and the pin-point timing with which they were
changed, deserved to share honors with the
acting.
The play needs pointing up in places for
greater effect, while at other points of lag it
could stand further cutting.—Chuck Miller

general who is able to live sumptuously while
in comparative safety in a French villa that is
already under the shadow of the advancing
German armies. He prefers at the same time
to share this life with Miss Graves, a woman
who is gaily oblivious to everything but sacri
ficing herself to him, and longing to know the
beauty of death—in England.
The humor to be found in this situation is
fully exploited by the airy repartee that is done
with a delicate and almost rippling touch in
certain scenes.
Beneath this surface in the darker eddies,
however, there is the conflict, always restive
and unresolved, between his flippantly sensual
treatment of life and her idealization of a no
man's world that could never exist.
Akim Tamiroff, in the part of the general,
brought out with a great skill, marred only in
several places by line-bobs, the nature of a man
who was human enough to - feel sympathy for
the lonely Miss Graves.

Jessica Tandy, as Miss Graves, had at once
I a charm and a balance necessary to keep such
a part fiom lapsing into sentimentality. It was
i this naivete cf a dreamer and idealist, so well
brought out by Miss Tandy, which created the
contrast between herself and the bawdy gen-
I eral. Around this the life of the two persons
1 turned.
Milton Parsons, who was cast in the role
of a Polish refugee, gave an excellent perform
-1 ance of a bemused man, haunted by the fear of
his German pursuers. Other members of the
supporting cast included Jeanne Bates as Doha
| Bebecita, the flirtatious wife of the general's
cousin. Chimene, a servant girl to the general,
was played by Roberta Haynes with a coyness
j that was immediately infectious.
General Erosa's villa proved a versatile set
ting with its sliding panels that permitted va
riety in scene changes and continuity. De
signed by Wendell Cole and painted by Harry
Cumming, the settings of Cronyn's production,
' and the pin-point timing with which they were
changed, deserved to share honors with the
acting.
The play needs pointing up in places for
greater effect, while at other points of lag it
could stand further cutting.—Chuck Miller

PAUL MASON, JESSICA TANDY, and AKIM TAMIROFF are shown
in a scene from "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep."
"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep." opening
last night in the Stanford Memorial Auditorium,
can justly be called a drama of contrasts.
Directed by Hume Cronyn, actor and scenar
ist from Hollywood, it is on the surface a ca
pricious comedy drawn around the life of a
general who is able to live sumptuously while
in comparative safety in a French villa that is
already under the shadow of the advancing
German armies. He prefers at the same time
to share this life with Miss Graves, a woman
who is gaily oblivious to everything but sacri
ficing herself to him, and longing to know the
beauty of death—in England.
The humor to be found in this situation is
fully exploited by the airy repartee that is done
with a delicate and almost rippling touch in
