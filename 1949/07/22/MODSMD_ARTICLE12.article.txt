WASHINGTON. July 21 (UP).-
The Senate today ratified the North
Atlantic Defense Pact with an over
whelming no-strings-attached vote

The vote was 82 to 13—a margin
of 18 more than the two-thirds ma
jority needed for approval of the
12-nation anti-Communist treaty.
President Truman will ask Con
cress tomorrow to move swiftly to
back up the pact with a $1,130,000,-
000 arms-for-Europe program.
But the peacetime lend - lease
plan, which Mr. Truman will out
line in a 3,000-word message, is ex
pected to meet much stifTer oppo
sition than the treaty itself.
The six-to-one vote for ratifica
tion came after the Senate had
rejected three Republican - led at
tempts to write reservations into
the pact.
The reservations would have stip
ulated that the treaty carries no
obligation for the United States to
supply arms to its allies, or to use

] force in helping them meet an at
j tack.

final showdown were two Demo
