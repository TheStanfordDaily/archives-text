## Fundamental Standard 
### 
In The Daily today is an article on the Honor Code, its devel
opment and importance to the students.
One of the lesser known facts about the Honor Code is that
jis spirit exists not only in academic matters but also in nearly
eJI other phases of University life. This spirit is embodied in
the Fundamental Standard, which is concerned with matters out
side the confined boundaries of class work.
The Fundamental Standard is not meant to apply to the en
forcement of minute regulations but is concerned with such mat
ters as social regulations and "conduct becoming a Stanford
student." Violations of the Fundamental Standard are handled
by the Council for Student Control.
Both the Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard are tradi
tions which can be maintained only by the integrity of the indi
vidual himself, not by the administration or the student govern
ment. No amount of control and punishment will make them
prosper. The success of these traditions depends on two things:
1. The realization by the individual of the advantages to be
obtained.
2. The active participation by the individual in observing the
Code and the Standard and in reporting violators to the Honor
Code Committee or to the Council of Student Control.â€”D. M.
