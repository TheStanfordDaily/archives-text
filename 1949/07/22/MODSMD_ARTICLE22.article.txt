## Time and Tide 
### 
The State Department has admitted publicly to a hold-off or do-nothing
policy in regard to the Chinese Civil War. That this should be done in spite
of the constant Congressional needling to help the Nationalist govern
ment, and in spite of the generally anti-Communist government, and
in spite of the generally anti-Communist atmosphere now prevailing,
Indicates the formidable weight of decision implied in China's struggle.
The Chinese have a long record of national friendship with America.
They are the inheritors of one of the finest cultures produced by man. By
position and potential the country dominates the entire Western Pacific
wea. The culture, at present, is in a state of dissolution- Given Western
techniques, technological and agricultural training, and a re-ordering of
the national economy, the Chinese will rise again to a position of power
tjnd dominance.
At present, there is the chaotic civil war. There is continued fighting,
spring floods in the south, much privation. The Nationalists, given time
to breathe by temporarily-stopped Red armies, are making a renewed
effort to rally enough force to at least 'make a deal'. Judging from present
show, there is little doubt that the Chinese Communist armies will carry
both the day and the final victory.
Now, what the good Senators want to know is—are we going to play
tall with the Communists and give up our democratic birthright? Or
do we help the Nationalists and let G. Washington rest easy in his grave?
Without deciding the issue, let us inspect the picture on a less abstract
level. If we support the Nationalists (an act that seems largely to pad
private bank accounts), we support people who have evidenced little or
no effectiveness in running a country in war or peace. Likewise, we sup
port the losing side, and by implication, cut loose whatever tenuous con
nection we still have with that stricken country.
If we (later) deal with the Communists, we deal with the controlling
,:«ower. That is a large point. The Communists will be faced with the
name mammoth social and economic problems as the gentlemen who are
TiOw retiring. They must, of sheer necessity, turn to someone for help.
Would it be preferable to refuse them aid and watch close ties of de
pendence develop between China and Russia? Or can we use our prestige
Knd technology to aid the Chinese people and consequently insure their
friendship?
Dealing with Communis! state powers does not guarantee either grati
tude or friendship—often, quite the contrary. Any program designed to
help their reconstruction would have to be administered with meticulous
care. It is hardly wise, on the other hand, to announce that we are for
tver the enemy of the Chinese Communists, as some of our good Sen
ators have done. To cut off a nation of three hundred million people may
h<. to cut off any effective contact with most of Eastern Asia.

techniques, technological and agricultural training, and a re-ordering of
the national economy, the Chinese will rise again to a position of power
tjnd dominance.
At present, there is the chaotic civil war. There is continued fighting,
spring floods in the south, much privation. The Nationalists, given time
to breathe by temporarily-stopped Red armies, are making a renewed
effort to rally enough force to at least 'make a deal'. Judging from present
show, there is little doubt that the Chinese Communist armies will carry
both the day and the final victory.
Now, what the good Senators want to know is—are we going to play
tall with the Communists and give up our democratic birthright? Or
do we help the Nationalists and let G. Washington rest easy in his grave?
Without deciding the issue, let us inspect the picture on a less abstract
level. If we support the Nationalists (an act that seems largely to pad
private bank accounts), we support people who have evidenced little or
no effectiveness in running a country in war or peace. Likewise, we sup
port the losing side, and by implication, cut loose whatever tenuous con
nection we still have with that stricken country.
If we (later) deal with the Communists, we deal with the controlling
,:«ower. That is a large point. The Communists will be faced with the
name mammoth social and economic problems as the gentlemen who are
TiOw retiring. They must, of sheer necessity, turn to someone for help.
Would it be preferable to refuse them aid and watch close ties of de
pendence develop between China and Russia? Or can we use our prestige
Knd technology to aid the Chinese people and consequently insure their
friendship?
Dealing with Communis! state powers does not guarantee either grati
tude or friendship—often, quite the contrary. Any program designed to
help their reconstruction would have to be administered with meticulous
care. It is hardly wise, on the other hand, to announce that we are for
tver the enemy of the Chinese Communists, as some of our good Sen
ators have done. To cut off a nation of three hundred million people may

The State Department has admitted publicly to a hold-off or do-nothing
policy in regard to the Chinese Civil War. That this should be done in spite
of the constant Congressional needling to help the Nationalist govern
ment, and in spite of the generally anti-Communist government, and
in spite of the generally anti-Communist atmosphere now prevailing,
Indicates the formidable weight of decision implied in China's struggle.
The Chinese have a long record of national friendship with America.
They are the inheritors of one of the finest cultures produced by man. By
position and potential the country dominates the entire Western Pacific
wea. The culture, at present, is in a state of dissolution- Given Western
techniques, technological and agricultural training, and a re-ordering of
the national economy, the Chinese will rise again to a position of power
