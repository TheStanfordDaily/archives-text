We always wanted to be a contortionist. Contortionists seem to have a
different twist on life. They see things from a different angle. One of the
reasons for your ambition may be that we come from a family of elbow
benders.
A contortionist believes that position is everything in life. That one
good turn deserves another. We believe that position means a lot—we
even bend over backward to get a good one.
We knew a girl who was a contortionist and was bowlegged. Sometimes
she stood almost beside herself but this was bad because she had to lean
over her shoulder to see her face and she was practically beside herself
because she didn't like people who looked over shoulder.
Being a contortionist got the better of her, though. Once she rolled
over in her sleep and got her nose stuck in her ear. This irritated her
nose and blew her brains out.
We also knew an ex-convict who was a contortionist. Imagine! A
contortionist going straight. The parole board made him quit because they
thought the racket was crooked.

A professor we know has a glass eye. The other day he had the thing
out and on his desk when he reached for a radish. The inevitable happened
—the prof swallowed the orb and took off like Mel Patton for Health Serv
ice. One of the Docs sent him down to the Clinic for an X-ray.
At the Clinic the doctor looked at the slip of paper that the instructor
got at the Health Service and stuck him in front of the camera. The Doc
took the slide in to be developed and didn't come back.
After a while old whiskers went to look for him and found him, X-ray
in hand, out cold on the floor. When he came to ol' prof asked him
what had happened. "I've looked at hundreds of stomachs," he said, "but
that's the first one that ever looked back at me."

We have never been known to show an awful lot of patience. However,
in this case we think that we have shpwn a good deal of equanimity and
sense of stoicism. At long last our self-possession has reached an end.
