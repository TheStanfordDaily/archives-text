# Individual Seen as Protector Of Honor Code Tradition
## 
### BOB BERKA 
The Honor Code is the tradition
of which Stanford is proud.
Students are on their honor not j
to give or receive aid in examina
tions or other work which is used j
as a basis for grading.
The Honor Code was adopted at
an election by the students many
years ago. Each year the Honor
Code Standing Committee polls stu
dents to get their opinion on
whether the system is functioning
I effectively. Every year a majority
i of students say that it is.
There was one stipulation put on
i the Honor Code adoption by the
j Administration. The students them-
I selves must see that it functions
j properly. This is done by the Coun
j cil for Student Control, consisting
| of Men's and Women's Councils
jointly.
It is also enforced by the stu
; dents. The "third-party responsi
bility" part of the Honor Code en
{ ables every student to watch for
violations and report them to the
j Council. Every student should first
| warn the violator that he has been
cheating, and ask him to stop. If
this does not work, the violator
| should be reported.
Violators are called before the :
Council for Student Control where
! they have a chance to answer the
J charge. Each student is presumed
J innocent until proved guilty. The |
I defendant is given a chance to ex- |
j amine and refute, if he can, every )
! bit of evidence against him.
If found guilty, the student is !
i sentenced by the Council according :
I to the seriousness of his offense. 1
j Only in the most extreme cases !
would a student be expelled. This
j has never been done in the history J
j of the Honor Code at Stanford.
A second violation of the Honor
j Code, however, means an almost ;

automatic expulsion. The Council
fc-els that this is only fair treatment
for a habitual offender.
Usually the penalty consists of
suspension from school for one or
two quarters, depending upon the
seriousness of the case. This is not
a penalty in the sense of exacting
an eye for an eye. It is more of a
period in which the offender may
think over his mistake.
Expulsion from Stanford means
that the student may not be admit
ted to any other accredited school
in the country.
A suspended student may not
study at another school during the
period of his suspension.
However, once the period of sus
pension has passed, the student may
continue his education without a
blemish on his record.
The suspension Is not put on the
student's transcript unless the
Council recommends that this be
done. Council has not done this for
many years.
If, however, the university which
is reviewing the transcript of a
transfer asks Stanford for a com
plete character report, or sees tlint
the student did not attend for one
or two quarters, and asks Stanford
why, the University must tell them.
In other words, the University
does not volunteer the information
that a student has violated the Hon
or Code. If asked point blank
whether the student has been found
guilty of such a violation, the Uni
versity is obligated to give the in
formation.
Expulsion is a different, story.
That is put on the transcript.

I defendant is given a chance to ex- |
j amine and refute, if he can, every )
! bit of evidence against him.
If found guilty, the student is !
i sentenced by the Council according :
I to the seriousness of his offense. 1
j Only in the most extreme cases !
would a student be expelled. This
j has never been done in the history J
j of the Honor Code at Stanford.
A second violation of the Honor
j Code, however, means an almost ;

automatic expulsion. The Council
fc-els that this is only fair treatment
for a habitual offender.
Usually the penalty consists of
suspension from school for one or
two quarters, depending upon the
seriousness of the case. This is not
a penalty in the sense of exacting
an eye for an eye. It is more of a
period in which the offender may
think over his mistake.
Expulsion from Stanford means
that the student may not be admit
ted to any other accredited school
in the country.
A suspended student may not
study at another school during the
period of his suspension.
However, once the period of sus
pension has passed, the student may
continue his education without a
blemish on his record.
The suspension Is not put on the
student's transcript unless the
Council recommends that this be
done. Council has not done this for
many years.
If, however, the university which
is reviewing the transcript of a
transfer asks Stanford for a com
plete character report, or sees tlint
the student did not attend for one
or two quarters, and asks Stanford
why, the University must tell them.
In other words, the University
does not volunteer the information
that a student has violated the Hon
or Code. If asked point blank
whether the student has been found
guilty of such a violation, the Uni
versity is obligated to give the in
formation.
Expulsion is a different, story.
That is put on the transcript.
The main job of the Council for
Student Control, of the Honor Code
Standing Committee, and of each
student regarding the Honor Code,
is prevention rather than correc
tion.
The Honor Code is the tradition
of which Stanford is proud.
Students are on their honor not j
to give or receive aid in examina
tions or other work which is used j
as a basis for grading.
The Honor Code was adopted at
an election by the students many
years ago. Each year the Honor
Code Standing Committee polls stu
dents to get their opinion on
whether the system is functioning
I effectively. Every year a majority
i of students say that it is.
There was one stipulation put on
i the Honor Code adoption by the
j Administration. The students them-
I selves must see that it functions
j properly. This is done by the Coun
j cil for Student Control, consisting
| of Men's and Women's Councils
jointly.
It is also enforced by the stu
; dents. The "third-party responsi
bility" part of the Honor Code en
{ ables every student to watch for
violations and report them to the
j Council. Every student should first
| warn the violator that he has been
cheating, and ask him to stop. If
this does not work, the violator
| should be reported.
Violators are called before the :
Council for Student Control where
! they have a chance to answer the
J charge. Each student is presumed
J innocent until proved guilty. The |
I defendant is given a chance to ex- |
j amine and refute, if he can, every )
! bit of evidence against him.
