The June issue of the Stanford
Law Review has been published and
is now ready for release, according
to Marjorie O'Brien, business man
ager.
Published by Stanford University
law students four times a year, the
Law Review seeks as one of its
goals to investigate current legal
problems in advance of their wide
spread litigation. In pursuit of this
goal, Warren M. Christopher, presi
dent of the editorial board, com
ments:
"A desre to comment on cases be
fore they reach a court of last re
sort is a corollary of our resolution
to discuss problems in advance of
their widespread litigation. How
ever, a California Supreme Court re
quest that law reviews refrain from
commenting on pending cases ham
pers our efforts to discuss legal
problems in California prior to their
final resolution by the courts."
For the June Law Review Charles
Fairman, professor of law and po
litical science at Stanford, has writ
