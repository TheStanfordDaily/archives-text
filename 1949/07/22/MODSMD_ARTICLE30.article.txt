# Row in Summer Beastly Dead; Kiddies Litter Road Instead
## 
### BOB BERKA 
The Row just doesn't look the same this summer. The tree-lined
treet which is the prototype of what a college campus should
ook like to a part of Stanford's students has changed.
No more are there girls sunning themselves on balconies and
ront lawns. No more are there volleyball games on the house

awns. And the strains of a sere- - *
ade don't break the campus quiet
;his summer.
Now, instead, Hie Kills' Row
nouses are rented to private fann
ies, and the fraternity houses are
icupied by skeleton crews. Skele
:<>n crew means just enough peo
ple to keep the front door open,
nd enough people to keep the front
awn watered.
The girls' Row houses have tri
ycles, wagons, scooters, sandboxes,
nd little children on the front
awns. It is a strange sight.
You can't walk down the Row at
ight without serious danger of
lipping over a child's wagon. It
ikes a while to get used to that.
Some of the fraternity houses are
..king advantage of uncrowded
summer conditions to renovate their
louses. The Zetes are doing this
now. The Theta Chi's are going to
wait until summer quarter is over
â– efore they have the front of their
.ousc remodeled.
Most of the men living on the
Row this summer eat at the Beta
house, Stanford Row's traditional
summer kitchen.
The Fijis and the Delts have
closed their houses for the summer.
Their members are living in other
fraternity houses and off the cam
pus for the quarter.
All of this is quite a change. But
t substantiates the statement of one
Row man that, "Tilings are certain
ly different in the summer here."
