# Sabbath Cinema Features Olivier
## 
### 
"Wuthering Heights," a movie
taken from Emily Bronte's book of
•he same name, will play at the
Mem And Sunday evening as part
of the regular series.
Laurence Olivier, this year's
Acndemy Award winner, plays the
ending role—that of Heathcliff. He
will play opposite Merle Oberon,
whose heart is broken in the classic
nanner of the English.
The nineteenth-century setting in
he gloomy, dank, Yorkshire moors
ioesn't help the picture to be any
hecrier, either.
Then there's the serial. The thing
nded last time with the car carry
ing the hero and heroine plunging
ver a cliff. (Funny, the car that
vent over the clilT was a sedan but
he car they were in was a coupe—
nist be an oversight or perhaps
hey couldn't afford to lose a good
40 Dodge.)
Will they get out? Of course, it's
nevitable. The hero will probably
save the gal-friend somehow —-even
.1 he has to break a shoelace or
muss his hair.
Also, there's the prospect that
-ome romance will develop between
;he reporter and Dolores. So far
their love life has been lacking.
The third big feature is a cartoon
from Warner Brothers. It might be
funny — last week's had the little
Indian with a big cardinal and white
feather.
The movie will start at 7:30 p.m.,
nd admission is 20 cents.
