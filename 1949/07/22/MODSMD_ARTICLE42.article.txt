## The 						Sports Desk Sanity Code Puts Family Friend Of Harry Hugasian on PCC Blacklist 
### 
At the Pacific Coast Conference get-together, held in about the middle
i June in Portland, fines were levied against the schools of the conference
>r violations of the "sanity code" designed to keep proselyting for athletes,
particularly football players, at a minimum.
In their quest for purity on the athletic field, the conference fathers
iave set up an amazing number of rules, the violation of which brings
nancial penance upon the university concerned. It the commissioners
an take college football back to the days of pure amateurism they can
take potatoes quit sprouting in a damp cellar.
At the June meeting, Stanford got socked for almost three thousand
erries. Yet it ran third to Washington, three-time loser, and Idaho, a
urprise second. One of the most stupid of the rules is the alumni abate
'.ent edict.
This decree rules that any "repeated, persistent, or obnoxious" contact
ith a prospective athlete on the part of a blacklisted alumnus of a school
an ants a fine of a thousand bucks against that school. When a college
an't in any way control the actions of its alumni!
A perfect illustration of this type of tomfoolery is the case of Sam
alesian—how he got on the blacklist of Stanford grads. formerly exclu
ive to "Big Jim" Reynolds.
Mr. Salesian is a friend of the family of Harry Hugasian, a lad due to
tart a three-year stretch as a star for Marohie Schwartz. As a matter
■ course he visits the Hugasians now and then, it's logical. As Harry
tgan to develop into an athlete, Sam sold him on coming to the Farm.
SC Loses Out —Gets Mad
USC wasn't very happy about this decision. The Trojan scouts had
een bringing in favorable reports on the boy's prep footballing. The
C athletic department sent a representative to see him. When Harry
aid no, the Trojans started a series of "repeated, persistent, and obnox
ius" visits to try to make him change his mind. Friend Salesian advised
im on how to give these giiys the brush-off.
This somehow troubled the Southern Californians, who promptly turned
am's name in to Conference Commissioner Vic Schmidt. When Harry
as asked how many times Sam had been to see him. the answer was
jmewhere around "25." Sam Salesian. Stanford grad. got blacklisted
n - visiting a personal friend.
Washington has eight of these blacklisted alums and USC has lour,
al has only one and the guy never went to of Strawberry Canyon Tech.
te went to Notre Dame and just thinks the gilded b'ar is swell.
This rule heaps a little hardship on the conference schools. They liave
> keep a private eye on their rivals' blacklistees.
Vjc Schmidt didn't make up the rules and realizes that they are not
ic best of legislation but that they will have to do until something better
mes along.
T\ from Hoover Tower?
Incidentally, while strolling on the campus yesterday, nottcpq some
ling that should be of interest. High on the observation platform of the
oover Tower was a piece of machinery that resembled somewhat a loud
leaker. Upon closer inspection it proved to be something else. We
eren't quite sure what. ;
It turned out to be a bit of apparatus used to reflect television waves,
he reason for its presence on the tower is the interesting part.
There is a possibility that some of Stanford's football games will be
lecast this fall. However, the television sending equipment cannot send
te fractious video waves from the depths of the stadium. They must be
nt upward to some nearby high place and reflected toward their ultimate
stination. The Hoover Tower business is only one of several methods
relaying the waves that are being considered.
