# ROSE BOWL
## Crimson Tide Ties Stanford 7 to 7 in 1927 
### 
In a thunderous finish to a dull
and insipid 1927 Rose Bowl game,
the Crimson Tide of Alabama came
alive in the on-rushing gloaming
like a rudely awakened giant and
nearly tore the Stanford varsity
apart.
With five minutes remaining on
the big clock, Stanford held a seven
lo nothing lead and seemed well
on their way to chalking up their
first Pasadena victory.
However, the football gods re
fused to smile down on the Indians
and they had to be content with a
7-7 tie. In the dying minutes of the
last quarter an Alabama tackier,
distinguished only as a raw, red
smear from the distant stands,
broke through and smothered Wil
ton's kick on the Stanford 14.
At this point Coach Wade insert
ed Bill Johnson, a second-stringer,
and in three plays he plunged over
for the tally. With the game hang
ing in the balance Billy Clark was
brought in to attempt the extra
point.
The mob. which had been shout
ing, screaming, and throwing body
English with each succeeding play
in the waning moments, quieted
down as Clark, standing" as immo
bile as a wooden Indian, waited for
the ball to be snapped from center.
Billy Clark did it. Period. The
mob provided the rest. From across
the field Alabama's little rickety
band struck up "Dixie" and the sta
dium took on the appearance of an
Armistice Day and political rally
all in one.
This v\ as a game the Indians had
all sealed up. Or. at least, seem
ingly so until Alabama caught fire.
Stanford's only score was easily
produced in the first quarter. Biff
Hoffman shot a spot pass to Dick
Hyland, who took the ball on the
dead run and raced all the way to
the Alabama 30. ,On straight line
plays Stanford carried the ball to
the 11. With the Alabama defense
pulled in close, Bogue passed to
Walker in the end zone. Bogue
kicked the extra point and Stanford
led. 7-0.
As was the case in the 1925 Bowl
game. Stanford held a decided edge
in offensive play but once again
missed opportunities. Twice Bogue
missed field goals. One failure was
attributed to the sun, which was
against Stanford in the first quarter.
The game, however, except for
a few flashing moments, lacked the
color that goes with the annual Rose
Bowl. During half - time a frisky
Alabama partisan ran onto the play
ing field. A Rose Bowl cop took up
the pursuit in a dizzy down-field
run. This was by far and away the
most spectacular play of the after
noon.
