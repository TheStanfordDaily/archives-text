# 'Say, Man, What's This Bebop Got That Dixieland Ain't Got?'

"Hey, Daddy, have you got eyes for Bebop?"
"You bet, Pops, that's real gone stuff!"
To the devotees of Dizzie Gillespie, famous "Emancipator of
]azz," that answer would mean, "Sure, I think it's tops!" although
to the outlander it might seem that bop was on the downgrade.

"Cool," "gone," and "Bells, man!"*
make for bebop expressions of ap
proval, and even the "square" jazz
men fall to using them.
Why, then, the jazz schism? The
differences are really technical, but
to both the Boppers and the Dixie
landers they're everything. Bop de
tractors refer to the innovation as
an offset of cocaine and marijuana.
This fails to express the difference
since a dope eventually slows some
one up, and as Gil Fuller, a Gilles
pie arranger, says, "Bebop is to I
jazz what the jet-plane is to the I
horse-and-buggy."
The music itself is a peculiar (to
the jazz ear) combination of a com
plicated, irregular rhythm .and odd
chords, frequently containing aug
mented filths and ninths. "It is so- ;
phisticated. highly literate, and ce
rebral," say Boppers, perhaps
strange only to jazzers as Chinese
music is to Americans at first. The
regular humdrum four-beats-to-bar
attributed to some primitive native (
instinct "no longer represented our j
way of living," said Gillespie. So
the Boppers are striving for a new !
expressionism along with most oth- |
er artists.
Bebop has boosted "scat singing" ;
tremendously. Scat singing is the j
vocalizing of meaningless sounds in J
instrumental fashion. Babs Gonza- j
les, though he contradicts conven- j
tional spontaneous eruption of I
noises in singing with his calculated 1
memorization, made scat famous j
•with his "Oop-Pop-A-Da." Bebop- i
pers and Dixielanders are brothers !
under the "scat."
Dizzie Gilelspie and his "rounds"
are acclaimed in France and Scan
dinavia especially. In Sweden his
records sell for as much as $12.
However, New Orleans is not tak
ing bop prone. At the International <
Jazz Festival of 1948 in Nice the
moment of European bop - jazz
clash occurred, when the Southern
sluggards tried to out-boo bop. At
the Marigny Theater in Paris, at the
climax to the Semaine du Jazz, Dix
ielanders reluctantly admitted Bop
pers to be good musicians by ap
plauding most of their perform
ances, through a shower of francs j
on the stage.
Certain Boppers concede that too
many strange habits have been ap
pended to the good music. There is
trumpets which inhere in misinter- j
a strange vein of Mohammedan con
versions, baggy clothes, and beat-up
pretations about Dizzie. The meer- ;
schaum pipe, the bop-hat, and dark j
glasses, too, are ridiculed by Jazz- j
ers, but then, so was the "new j
iook."
No, statistics prove the popularity j
of Behop is not on the slide and J
Dick (any good guy) can still have '
eyes for Bebop.
