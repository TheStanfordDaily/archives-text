## No Butts About It 
### 
Stanford has many graduate students and outsiders here this
quarter who do not understand some of the traditions of our
University. One of the njost fundamental of these is the question
of smoking in the Quad.
Traditionally, the law students have been the greatest of
fenders—the great pillars of independence who toss tradition
to the winds in order to have a cigarette before class. The first
weeks of school most of the frosh forget and wait until they get
to the middle of the Quad before finishing their cigarettes.
But now students who have been here for two and three years
seem to have forgotten completely about the custom. Some
persons even think the request has been completely abandoned
"for the duration" just because "practically everything else has
been done away with."
Of course, many wonder what is back of this tradition. When
the University was founded, Mrs. Leland Stanford, in one of her
few requests, asked that students do not smoke in the Quad.
For years this custom was strictly adhered to, but in the last
five or six years a new crop of people, who pride themselves on
being independent, have entered the portals of Stanford Univer
sity and torn down all of the principles which had lasted for more
than 40 years.
Not so many persons confine their smoking to the Inner
Quad —it is mainly the walk along the edge of the Quad which
is inhabited by violators.
The next time you want to light a cigarette in front of Room
100, think and try to wait until class is over and step outside
the Quad for your smoke.
You can also help revive a dying tradition by politely remind
ing your friends when they start to smoke in the Quad.
