# 'Kiss of Fire' Enflames Guild, Torchy Miss Romance Stars
## 
### UANE SPILSBURY 
"The Kiss of Fire," now playing at the Guild Theater, is a French-made,
Italian boudoir comedy starring a pair of brown eyes (plus other assorted
equipage) with the improbable name of Viviane Romance and a big hi
larious clown named Michel Simon.
The story concerns the adventures of an amorous wench named Lolita
(Miss Romance) who steps out of the hold of a coal steamer at Naples and
into the lives and apartment of a couple of buddy musicians (Michel Simon
and Tino Rossi).
Miss Romance has the happy faculty of being able, in one casual glance,
to insinuate more good, clean old sex than all the dirty words in "Forever
Amber."
Before she stops trading ogles with half the men in Naples. Lolita has
temporarily broken up a marriage and a friendship, cooled the lust of an
Italian Frank Sinatra, and undressed more times than ought to be written
about.
Her maine forte is telling little fibs which make the creations of Orson
Welles look like the recorded minutes of a women's tea.
At End—Peace
In the end, peace reigns; and everyone is reconciled except the sales
man she winds up with, who will undoubtedly have one sweet time ex
plaining her to the "little woman" at home.
All in all, the picture is good. Michel Simon, a top-flight comedian,
is excellent as the wronged friend. Miss Romance, as the amiable little
trollop, manages to look fetching even while looking common.
The sex, in this case, is not tacked on for the lone benefit of the college
freshmen, but forms a neat part of the emotional development. (I guess
that's what you'd call it.)
Many Fine Scenes
Particularly fine scenes are one in which a dignified old man returns
the glance of Romance, plucks his eyeballs up off the ground, and leaps on
a streetcar, hormones atingle: one which shows Simon's burlesque of a
heart-throbbing street song; one hide-and-seek bedroom scene with a
nervous photographer; and a scene where Miss Romance instructs Mr.
Rossi to come up at four (presumably to look at her stereoscopic slides).
He holds out until four-thirty, then creeps up the stairs. Whereupon—
but then, there's no use telling the whole story.
