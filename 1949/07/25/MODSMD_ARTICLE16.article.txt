# Ladies Steal Headlines As Men Get Brushoff
## 
### United Press 
NEW YORK. July 24—The hand
that rocks the cradle set the world
to spinning at a dizzy rate last week.
Every day was ladies' day just
about everywhere but the Harvard
Club, and a lot of gents got left out
in the heat wave.
A group of lonely California wid
ows put the first plank into the dog
house by asking the government for
a road map to a place where there
is an over - supply of dependable
men. They sought husband-hunting
help, thsy said, because the men
they know in Southern California
want only fleeting romances with
movie stars.
Mrs. Daniel F. Lafoon, Richmond,
Va„ did her bit lor the lonesome
Westerners. Her 61-year-old hus
band complained to Indiana police
that whc?n he got out of their car
for a minute en route to Wisconsin,
she drove away without him. It
wouldn't have been so bad, he said,
if she hadn't taken his clothes,
money, tools—and teeth.
A Japanese husband gave his 27-
year-old wife to a 36-year-old wid
ower, and threw in a dowry of
50,000 yen besides. He explained
that he was "enfeebled by ill health
and unable to contribute to a happy
marriage."

Mrs. Georgia Neese Clark got her J
hands on the biggest purse strings 1
in the world by becoming the first
woman treasurer of the United
States. She was entrusted with
$27,424,541,375.78.
At Monte Carlo, the world's most
famous gambling den, Ruth Thomas,
a blonde New York show girl, threw
the first dice ever to be rolled offi
cially in Europe. The Mississippi
! marbles stopped at five and two —a
natural.
Broadway musical comedy star
; Nanette Fabray stopped the show j
; in Dallas, Tex., when a June bug I
crawled into her brassiere during
|an open air performance. She 1
screamed and was taken away in
j hysterics.
Mae West had the last word on
i that episode. She said Miss Fabray
I should have looked the bug in the ;
i antenna and said:
'Look, honey, I'm busy. Give me
a buzz some other time."
