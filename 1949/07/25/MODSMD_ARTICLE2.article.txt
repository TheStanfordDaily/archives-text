Fact."
Another in the summer series of
talks by motion picture experts, the
lecture by the Disney director will
be held at 4:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall and is

Beginning as an animator, in
which capacity he worked on such
films as "Snow White," Algar soon
became a director. His first direc
toral stint was the "Sorcerer's Ap
prentice" in "Fantasia," followed by
"Bambi" and "Victory Through Air
Power," in each of which he di
rected aboute half the production.
Letter he undertook the direction
of war training films, government
films, a series of health films for
Latin America, and most recently
the Academy Award winner, "Seal
Island," the first of a true-life ad
venture series. Algar is now writ
ing the scripts for two more films
in this series, "The Amazing Bea
ver" and"The Eskimo."

the class of 1933 with an A.B. in
journalism. He won his Master's
degree in journalism in 1936. He

ton, is also a member of the class of

graduates in the 'thirties who have
"grown up" artistically with Disney
through the period of black and
white Disney shorts and are now
concerned mostly with the studio's
technicolor feature-length shows, or
films in which live action and ani

are Frank Thomas, '33; Oliver John
ston, '35 (son of Dr. Oliver M. John
ston, emeritus professor of Romanic
languages); Thor Putnam, '32; and
Jack Boyd, '39. Algar, Thomas,
Johnston, and Putnam all worked

Stanford from Modesto Junior Col
lege.
Agar is one of five Stanford
graduates in the 'thirties who have
"grown up" artistically with Disney
through the period of black and
white Disney shorts and are now
concerned mostly with the studio's
technicolor feature-length shows, or
films in which live action and ani
mation are both used. The others
are Frank Thomas, '33; Oliver John
ston, '35 (son of Dr. Oliver M. John
ston, emeritus professor of Romanic
languages); Thor Putnam, '32; and
Jack Boyd, '39. Algar, Thomas,
Johnston, and Putnam all worked
on the haparral together.
The speech and drama depart
ment is arranging a reception in
Algar's honor following the lecture.
