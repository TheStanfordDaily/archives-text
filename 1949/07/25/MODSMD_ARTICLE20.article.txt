# Former Stanford Greats Commence '49er Practice at Menlo on Monday
## 
### 
Clark Shaughnessy was just
initiating the "T" formation
when Frankie Albert and Norm
i Standlee were playing in his
backfield. The whole thing
j hinged on a fast four men be
hind the line. The formation
needed a guick accurate passer.
That passer was Frankie Albert,
j The big charging fullback was Norm
"Big Chief" Standlee. Together with
little Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gal
larneou, that backfield made his
tory. That backfield parlayed Stan
} ford's name into football history.
Monday on the practice field at
j Menlo Junior College, Albert and
Standlee will join 56 more foot-
I bailers as the San Francisco '49ers
j open their fall practice session.
I Menlo JC is just a few miles north
j of Stanford on El Camino.
Last year the '49ers lost only two
J games, both to the Cleveland

Browns. The team, coached by Buck
Shaw, feels that this is its year. 1
The '49ers in '49, they are saying.
They even plan on beating the ,
Browns nemesis.
Of the 56-player roster, 27 of the '
men are rookies. Twenty more are
linemen. This strings along with
Buck Shaw's belief in a strong line.
Albert and Standlee were with
Stanford when they went to the
Rose Bowl in 1940 to beat Nebraska
21-13. It was a glorious victory for
the Indians and the "T" formation.
It was the passing of Albert to
Kmetovic which turned the trick
from a close score which meant that
the game could go either way.
The "Wow Boys," the 1940 team
was called. They began the season
without much support from the
men who practice picking teams.
But they ended up on top of the
heap. And one-half of that back
field will be back in uniform this
fall, trying to carry the '49ers to
the top of the '49 heap.
