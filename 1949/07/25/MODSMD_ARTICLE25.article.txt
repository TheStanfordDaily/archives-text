# Experimental Play Terminates 3-Day Run at Memorial Hall
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Stanford Players' experimental production of the Bemel
mans' novel "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" is finished. With
the Saturday performance, the play closed its three-day run. The
last set has been "struck," the last compliment received.
The stage of the Memorial Auditorium is as bare as .the meat

plate in a boarding house. The vil - ♦
las and steamships have disappeared
into the cavernous holds of the
workshop. The earthquake which
rattled the teeth of the last row has j
died off into the placid surface of a j
sound recording. The last withered J
leaf and Indian has been swept into i
the ashcan.
"The baby," as Stephan Cole, the
assistant director, put it, "has been j
born and put to bed."
Worriers Flood Backstage
And to continue the figure, the i
obstetrics were pretty awe-inspir- ;
•ing. There were more worried "doc- I
tors" and floor-pacing "relatives"
standing by than attended the ac- j
couchement of Princess Elizabeth. !
.For example:
There was Miss Ryan, the nervous !
grey - eyed lady who adapted the I
play. There was Mr. Bemelmans, :
who telegraphed regards to the cast.
Likewise, there was the cave-eyed l
Mr. Hume Cronyn who whipped the j
tremendous production into shape j
in four weeks; and Mr. Stephan j
Cole, who cued the three perform- j
ances from backstage.
There was Miss Jessica Tandy,
•who gave life to the glassily brittle
Miss Graves; and Mr. Akim Tami
rolf, who can look hilariously funny
without looking like anything but
Mr. Tamiroff. And, of course, as
the philosophic Plaschke, there was
the superb performance of Mr. Mil
ton Parsons. Rounding out the cast
were other professionals and the
very able Stanford Players.
Split-Timed Excellence
Behind stage was the split-timed
excellence of the technical crew j
who nightly constructed villas,
boats, and orderly havoc during the
ten - minute intermissions. There
were also the lighting and sound
offects crews, and the property
crews, the designer, painters, and
special - effects crew, the makeup
and costume department, the tick
et-sales staff, and the faculty and
.students of Stanford University —
without all of whom the perform
ance would have looked like a first
grade Easter pageant.
To all these people and their ex
haustive labors, Stanford University
owes a most grateful thanks.
