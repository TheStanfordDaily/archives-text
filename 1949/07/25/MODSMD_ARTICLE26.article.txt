children.
' My husband had various jobs in
Latin America, and I went along,
with whatever children were on
hand at that time, to British Hon
duras, Guatemala, Jamaica, and
Mexico," she relates.
"Mexico is really my home where
I intend to retire —if ever—and to
visit as often and as long as possible
meantim?."

duras jungle.
