# Jamboree Attracts Large Dance Crowd
## 
### 
A large crowd attended the
Square Dance Jamboree in the
Women's Gym last Friday night.
The crowd was dressed in blue jeans
and calico.
Two Bay Area square dance
groups were present at the dance
to present a show. The groups were
the "Gateswingers" and the "49ers."
Members of these groups helped the
beginners get started.
The most popular dances per
formed were waltzes, schottisches,
and the "Cotton-eyed Joe."
Said one of the girls who at
tended, '"Everyone who stayed away
sure missed a good time."
