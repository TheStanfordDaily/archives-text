achieved in India and the world

and minds are young.

dents in Hoover Library Friday af
ternoon. She is visiting Indian na- j

interests.

India was not interested in a Pa

among the unstabilized governments
of Asia.

causing chaos in India, but that
chaos was possible if the govern

citizens.

change these things cainnot be a
stable government," she said.
India is 'looking to the United
States for help to (I) build India
into a strong, self-supporting na- j
tion, and (2) make it the stable
force in Asia.
