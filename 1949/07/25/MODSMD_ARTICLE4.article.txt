# ASSU Party Attracts 200
## 
### 
Two hundred students journeyed
to Seaclift Beach yesterday for the
ASSU-sponsored beach party.
The sky was cloudless, the sun
was warm, and a gentle breeze,
later in the day, cooled the sun
baked ..Tew.
The affair got under way at 12:30
p.m. with the start of the volleyball
games on two courts erected by
Chuck Hirsch. Both courts were
in use most of the afternoon.
Chuck Blohn and Fred Hnsbrook
reported that "there was plenty of
refreshments." "In fact," they said,
"there were two kegs left over."
Swimming and body surfing at
tracted many celebrants away from
the refreshments.
"Although the breakers were
larger than usual today," said Lois
Croonquist, ASSU vice - president,
"the swimmers kept going back for
more."
Student life guards reported that
no one had to be rescued from the
surf.
The day-long party began break
ing up around 5 p.m., but many stu
dents on the beach lagged behind
"to see !he sun set over the Pacific."
On the way home traffic piled up
for three miles outside of Los Gatos.
No accidents were reported by 8
o'clock last night.
