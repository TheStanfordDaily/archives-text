# Folk Song Duo Returns Friday
## 
### 
The delightful folk song duo, Jo
set Marais and Miranda, will return
to Stanford Friday evening at 8:15
in Memorial Hall for their second
campus appearance in less than a
year.
The husband and wife team, who
have been scoring smashing suc
cesses with their Decca record al
bums and radio appearances, will
present a varied program of 23 folk
songs from all parts of the world.
Although specializing in songs of
the African veld, they are equally
versed in ballads from the Great
Smoky Mountains, Holland, Eng
land, France, and Switzerland.
Marais and Miranda are present
ed at Stanford under the joint aus
pices of the Friends of Music and
the University's Committee on Pub
lic Exercises. Friends of Music
membership cards will admit the
bearer without charge.
Concert tickets are on sale at the
Peninsula Box Office in Palo Alto
and San Mateo, the Memorial Hall
box office at Stanford, and the Pub
lic Exercises office in Temporary
Building B, room 55. on the campus.
Admission is $1.20 and no seats are
reserved.
Marais and Miranda are noted for
their intimate, informal stage man
ner which is said to combine sophis
tication with extreme simplicity.
They sing each of their songs first
in the native tongue and then in
the English translaton, to the ac
companiment of Josef's guitar.
