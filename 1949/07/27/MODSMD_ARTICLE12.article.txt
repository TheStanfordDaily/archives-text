# Featurist Notes U.S., Veld Folk Songs Comparable in Origin, Presentation
## 
### BOB BERKA 
This Friday night the Stanford
Committee on Public Exercises will
i present a program of folk songs by
! Josef Marais and Miranda.
The program will consist mainly
| of songs of the African veld. The
i similarity between these folk songs
| and our own is surprising. But it
I is easier to see the similarity when
one considers the parallel between
j the Union of South Africa and the
; United States.
Both countries have large flat
j areas where animals are herded.
: Both countries have a language
: which has drifted slightly through
I usage from the original.
The Dutch of South Africa de
veloped a language which is func
| tional, and has come to be known
ias Afrikaans. This is similar to
! the manner in which Amerioan
speech has become different from
the original English. Both countries
grew from colonies.

Josef Marais was born on the
Great Karoo Plateau of South Af
rica. As he grew older he devel
oped a strong interest in his coun
try's history and traditions. This
led to an interest in folk songs.
Marais went to England to complete
his education, and while there con
vinced the BBC that the listening
public would be interested in a
program of South African folk
songs.
He was right. Later when he
came to America, NBC found that
his folk songs had an appeal here.
His radio program, "Songs from the
African Veld," enjoyed a big suc
cess.
During the war, the "Voice of
America" broadcast news to South
Africa, and Marais was employed to
intersperse the news with his folk
songs. It was while working for
radio during the war that he met
Miranda. She was doing transla-

tion work for the short-wave sta- !
tion.
The two found their voices were
well matched, and when the war J
was over and news not too plentiful, ,
they w?nt on as a folk song team.
The veld songs are simp!e and
catchy. They are sung with a gui
tar, just as most of our folk songs
are. It is leisurely music, with the
life and the laughter of the people
woven into it. There is a sly twist
in some of the songs which are I
quite humorous. One example of j
this is "Old John Goggabie." Gogga i
in Afrikaans means insect. It is j
a name held in high esteem. The i
song tells of a woman who is poor,
but marries John Goggabie. As the !
song ends, she says that her name J
may be Goggabie. but she has new
clothes.
The Marais have appeared at
Stanford previously to present their
folk song program.

I is easier to see the similarity when
one considers the parallel between
j the Union of South Africa and the
; United States.
Both countries have large flat
j areas where animals are herded.
: Both countries have a language
: which has drifted slightly through
I usage from the original.
The Dutch of South Africa de
veloped a language which is func

ias Afrikaans. This is similar to
! the manner in which Amerioan
speech has become different from
the original English. Both countries
grew from colonies.

Josef Marais was born on the
Great Karoo Plateau of South Af
rica. As he grew older he devel
oped a strong interest in his coun
try's history and traditions. This
led to an interest in folk songs.
Marais went to England to complete
his education, and while there con
vinced the BBC that the listening
public would be interested in a
program of South African folk
songs.
He was right. Later when he
came to America, NBC found that
his folk songs had an appeal here.
His radio program, "Songs from the
African Veld," enjoyed a big suc
cess.
During the war, the "Voice of
America" broadcast news to South
Africa, and Marais was employed to
intersperse the news with his folk
songs. It was while working for
radio during the war that he met
Miranda. She was doing transla-

tion work for the short-wave sta- !
tion.
The two found their voices were
well matched, and when the war J
was over and news not too plentiful, ,
they w?nt on as a folk song team.
The veld songs are simp!e and
catchy. They are sung with a gui
tar, just as most of our folk songs
are. It is leisurely music, with the
life and the laughter of the people
woven into it. There is a sly twist
in some of the songs which are I
quite humorous. One example of j
this is "Old John Goggabie." Gogga i
in Afrikaans means insect. It is j
a name held in high esteem. The i
song tells of a woman who is poor,
but marries John Goggabie. As the !
song ends, she says that her name J
may be Goggabie. but she has new
clothes.
The Marais have appeared at
Stanford previously to present their
folk song program.
This Friday night the Stanford
Committee on Public Exercises will
i present a program of folk songs by
! Josef Marais and Miranda.
The program will consist mainly
| of songs of the African veld. The
i similarity between these folk songs
| and our own is surprising. But it
