# Dancing, Singing At Stay-a-White
## 
### 
Lois Croonquist, ASSU vice
president and campus personality,
will provide entertainment at the
Stay-a-While this afternoon from
4 to 5 by singing some blues that
"give the low-down on the low
down Stanford men."
There will be dancing to the best
bands in the land (records) and also
free soft drinks and chocolate crul
lers for the midweek relaxing.
"More women are especially
urged to come," says Jim Brown,
chairman and Resident Adviser at
Encina Hall, who finds that the men
are not the shy ones this summer.
