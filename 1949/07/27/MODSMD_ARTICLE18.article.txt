## Firemen's Problems 
### 
Summer is the season for fires. It is also the season for curious
fire-engine chasers to impede the fire fighters when every second
counts.
One of the greatest concerns of any fire-fighting unit is the
difficulty in getting necessary equipment to the scene of the
trouble before the onlookers jam the roadways. Many cities,
such as Palo Alto, go as far as blocking off the area immediately,
with the aid of the police department. Stanford is unable to do
this because of the limited personnel in the fire and police
departments.
Therefore, it becomes the duty of the students themselves to
restrain their curiosity.
Up to this date the number of campus fires has been less than
during the average year. As the days go by, the grass becomes
drier and drier and invites a careless smoker to flick his ashes
and start a costly conflagration. The throwing of any lit material
from an automobile is now punishable by law, and should remind
us of our duties.
Another law concerning fire fighting which was recently
signed by Governor Warren makes it unlawful to drive over a
fire hose.
Let's remember to use our ash trays and to stay where we are
when the fire whistle sounds.â€”D. M.
