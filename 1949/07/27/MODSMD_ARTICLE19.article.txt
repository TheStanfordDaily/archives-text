# Jazz on Top, Not So Bop

### FRED TEAGUE 
"Playin' jazz is talkin' from the
heart, you don't lie."
These were the words of Bunk
Johnson, venerable New Orleans
trumpeter who diet! but a few
weeks ago. Bunk was the man who.
after a good deal of reflection, said,
"Me and Louis Armstrong — we're
the only men who can succeed on
this horn (trumpet)." Bunk, inci
dentally, was in on the creation of
jazz in ihe '90's.
Dixieland, or New Orleans, jazz
is a simple, honest, straightforward
% musical art - form, springing from
the work songs and folk tunes that
are a rich slice of Americana.
This is opposed to be-bop, a jazz
form that seems to be insincere, im
mature, and frenetic; that gives off
strong hints of un-artistic neurosis,
shoddy, commercial power-politics,
and childish clowning. The phoni
ness of bop is attested through the
stilted, mechanically arranged scat
vocals -and instrumental ensembles.
Instrumental solos in bop illus
trate the other extreme—a musician
with good technique playing any
note as it enters his head without
the slightest regard for the edicts of
harmony or the traditions of musi
cianship. Dizzy Gillespie, one of the
creators of bop, is excused from
blame of intent to violate the max
ims of music—you see, the Diz is
half deaf.
By the way, be-bop isn't anything
new—it has all been done before
but until recently was not forced
upon the public. Wingy Manone,
trumpeter out of New Orleans, once
,said, "We had guys play a lot of
notes like they (hoppers) do back
on the river boats but we'd just
throw 'em overboard and they'd
cool off in the Mississippi."
However, the purpose of this
piece is not to tear down bop but to
help explain jazz to the uninitiated.
It is no news to anyone that the
general public is hopelessly vague,
confused, and full of misapprehen
sions as to just what jazz is. Disc
jockeys who profess to play jazz and
then present a program of Paul
Whiteman and Duke Ellington have
not helped any.
The New American Encyclopedia
defines jazz as 'a style of rhythmic, I
syncopated music derived from rag- '

time, made popular by 'Alexander's
Ragtime Band' just before the first
World War." Bunk would love to
know that.
Right out of the Century Diction
ary comes this definition: "(Jazz is)
a kind of noisy, discordant, synco
pated music as played by a jazz
band, using the cornet, trombone,
clarinet, saxophone, piccolo, banjo,
cymbals, and drum."
That's right, the man said pie
co'o. This brings to mind only that
celebrated line by Muggsy Spanier,
jazz great from the Windy City,
i Asked by a big-band leader to play
j a solo way up in the highest of
registers on his cornet, Muggsy re
| plied in rather purple language,
| "Wot do you think this is, a
I piccolo?"
The way we look at 'it, jazz is
impossible to define except with
generalities. We'll do our best,
i however. Jazz is a good time music
i played with a definite, simple but
| syncopated rhythm on some or all
| of the following instruments: cor
j net, trumpet, trombone, clarinet,
| piano, banjo or guitar, string bass
or tuba, drums, and sometimes oth
er instruments such as the soprano
sax, tenor sax. slide whistle, wash
board, and so on. It is played in
the tradition engendered by Bunk
and his nineteenth century associ
ates.
Although Bunk died recently, he
had returned to music six years ago
to lead his ancient cronies and the
youngsters just starting in the idiom
on the high road of the jazz renais
sance. Jazz has enjoyed immense
popularity on two fronts.
While bop's only strong front has
been the immature or degenerate
mincl. Dixie sweeps on, appealing to
the older person through nostalgia
and to the youth of the country
through its exciting rhythm and ex
uberant spirit. College students are
thrilling all over the nation to the
Dixieland jazz of such campus bands
as Stanford's King Riverbottom
Mud and his Cardinal Jazz Band
and Harvard's Crimson Stompers j
and so on.
Well, where a hopper might say.
"You bet, daddy, bop's the gonest—•
it's the top. mop-mop," a Dixie-cat
like Bunk would say, ''Playin' jazz j
is talkin' from the heart, you don't j
lie."
