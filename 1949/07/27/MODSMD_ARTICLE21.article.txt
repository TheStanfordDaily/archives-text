# Birds Set Up Housekeeping
## 
### J. J. FISHMAN 
Mama Bird flew in with a twig in
her mouth, placed it carefully with
the others on the shelf, and stood
there with her head on one side
surveying her handiwork. Appar
ently she wasn't satisfied, for she
twittered to Papa Bird who soared
gracefully to a stop beside her. For
a moment there was no sound in
the room save the chirped conver
sation between Mama and Papa
Bird. The class sat with collective
bated breath awaiting their deci
sion. Finally Papa Bird picked up
the twig and moved it two inches
over toward the wall. The class
breathed again and returned to its
discussion of Aristotle's 'Poetica," as
Mama and Papa Bird fluttered out
of the window in search of more
materials for their next building.
Who is building where, you ask?
Well, even at Stanford the housing
situation is tight, as you know, and
it affects juncos as well as students.
So Mama and Papa Bird, finding all
available nesting space taken in the
trees on campus, found themselves

a spot in the Seminar Room of the
Memorial Theater Building. As a
matter of fact, they like their quar
ters so well that this is the third
year they've nested there. Of course,
they hud a decision to make this
year. The best theater models had
already been utilized in former
years for their nests, so this year
they decided on a nice corner of
one of the book shelves. The fact
that there were some papers there
didn't laze Papa Bird. He picked
them up, one by one, and deposited
them on another shelf. Then they
started building.
They flew in at all hours, for
there's a sign on a window from
previous years saying: "Do not close
this window. Mama Bird must get
food." A bit of fluff here, a twig
there, a leaf from an oleander, all
were brought in and built into their
nest. Through the fog and haze of
smoke they came. Sometimes they
were lost from sight in the smoke
that spiraled above the pipe at the
head of the table, but Papa Bird not
only enjoyed the smoke, he liked
cigarettes.
