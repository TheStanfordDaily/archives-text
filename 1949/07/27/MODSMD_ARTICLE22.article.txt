To the Editor:
In reference to the editorial concerning smoking on the Quad, stop try
ing to breathe life into a dead horse. A tradition which is both unpopular
and which serves no useful purpose is better abandoned.
Cigarettes are more expensive now than they were in Mrs. Stanford's
time. I can't afford to throw away one every time I walk on the Quad.
If The Daily must carry a cudgel for a cause, it can find more important
ones than the maintenance of antiquated traditions.
