# NCAA Clarifies Football Rules
## 
### 
The National Association of Col
legiate Commissioners, with repre
sentatives of 162 colleges through
out the country, agreed that all
football rules should be interpreted
the same from North to South and
East to West.
In the future all officiating is to
be on a neutral basis regardless ol
the site of the competition.
According to a statement by Asa
S. Bushnell, who is presiding over
the conference, the chief objective
was to assume that the new rewrit
ten, recodified 1949 NCAA rule
book would mean the same thing
and be interpreted the same way
by coaches, players, and officials in
all sections of the country.
