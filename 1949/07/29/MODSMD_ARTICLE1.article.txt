### 
Josef Marais and Miranda will present a cosmopolitan program
of folk songs from all over the world tonight at 8:15 in Memorial
Hall.
The popular husband-and-wife team, who first gained fame for
their Decca record albums of African Veld songs, will appear

under the joint auspices of the
Friends of Music at Stanford and
the University's Committee on Pub
lic Exercises.
Tickets, priced at $1.20. will be
on sale at the door. They may also
be obtained at the Peninsula Box
Office in Palo Alto and San Mateo,
the Memorial Hall box office, and
the Public Exercises office. Mem
bers of the Friends of Music will be
admitted without charge.
In their return performance on
the campus, Marais and Miranda
will present the familiar South Af
rican songs for which they are so
well known, as well as ballads from
America, the British Isles, and the
Continent.
Typical of the material to be in
cluded in their Stanford program
are such songs as "Unga Wena
Wena," a bargaining song between
a Zulu and his father-in-law; "Jan
Pieriewiet" (a pieriewiet is a small
South African bird noted for its
shrill cry); "The Days of '49," a
California ballad; "The Mountain Is
Far," a marching chant of the Ba
suto; "Cripple Creek," a song from
the Smoky Mountains; and "Whis
tle and I'll Come to Ye," a Scottish
air by Robert Burns.
Accompanied by Marais' guitar,
the pair will sing foreign songs first
in the native tongue and then in
English translation.
Marais and Miranda have a back
ground almost as cosmopolitan as
their songs. Josef was born on the
great Karoo Plateau of South Af
rica. Miranda in Amsterdam. They
met in New York City during the
war where both were working on
the "Voice of America" broadcasts.
