SOUNDING BRASS
In a decade of massive dislocations when prolific crises elbow each other
for our attention in unseemly haste it is easy to overlook the sinister
mouthings of a Washington legislator as hardly impressive. Thus Senator
Hickenlooper's remarks on the privy nature of atomic information are apt
to pass as ill-considered, or merely as noise.
The Senator's knack of playing the limelight shows no realization of
the cogent fact that 'politics' should stop where the delicacies of national
interest begin. His rash attack at the mere suggestion that we exchange
atomic data with England and Canada shows little effort (or ability)
to understand the primary role being played by the United States in
world relations today.
Reports from Europe today suggest that American aid (ERP) was just
the tool needed to implement the technological recovery of the Western
nations. Their industrial recuperation has been excellent. Machinery
and production, however, do not of themselves produce a harmonious so
ciety capable of maintaining peace and orderly relations.
Just as important is the confidence Europeans have in us and in their
ability to create a stable social order. Insofar as we foster this confidence
by encouraging European unity (in a federal sense), our financial invest
ment will be justified. To discourage this painful integration is to turn
our economic aid into Operation Rathole.
It is, of course, desirable that Congress chaperone the American recon
struction program. But to speak carelessly, without calculating the de
stiuctive effect on all previous effort is much the same as casting good old
American dollars to the wind. This is a distinctly un-Republican char
acteristic, and one wonders what is clouding the good Senator's compre
hension.
BITTERSWEET POTION
The fantastic negativism (to us) of Russian policy and practice has long
ceased to be a sharp pain—now seeming, to our dulled sensibilities, like
the dull, persistent ache of anxiety.
It seemed when Russian objectives were finally clarified in our minds,
that this, added to years of suffering, sacrifice, and effort, was just too
much. The vacuum left by Nazi Germany seemed to have been filled by
Hitler's big brother.
So burdening has this view become, that we thought of looking at
Russia from the angle of good luck—just for relaxation.
America and Russia form the two opposite poles of the primary political
tension now existent. This fact has brought much sorrow; it can bring
much improvement. Russia is a continuous challenge to us to resolve the
multitudinous political and economic difficulties that have formed un
shakable obstacles to world peace.
With this vastly irritating spur in our sides we have the motivation
and interest to use our mammoth influence to reduce national friction
and discourage ethnocentric institutions (e.g. trade barriers, obsolete
monetary systems).
For this we need not rationalize a covert Manifest Destiny. The very
existence of Russia demands continuous and daring experiment on our
part. Either we become statesmen or has-beens.
