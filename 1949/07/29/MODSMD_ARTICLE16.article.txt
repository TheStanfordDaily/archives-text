### FRED TEAGUE 
The Stanford Institute of International Relations has remained active
during the quarter to conduct the foreign affairs of the ASSU under
President Bob Butow.
Six main committees and an executive board and staff comprise the
working machinery of the lIR.
A few of the main committees are:
SlRO—Student International Relief Organization which conducts relief
drives and sends the supplies to the needy in foreign countries; ICC—ln
ternational Conference Committee, which conducts discussion groups on

subjects of international significance;
and, the"I" Club—The Internation
al Club, which promotes close con
tact American and foreign students
on campus.
In addition to the main commit
tees, there are several temporary
and special cortunittees which are
responsible for particular projects.
The executive board is in charge
of llR's operations. This board con
sists of the heads of the six stand
ing committees and the four execu
tive officers of the organization.
Nevertheless, all policy decisions
rest, ultimately, on the authority
of the Excom.
The lIR has no faculty or Uni
versity advisers. It is completely
free from any external domination,
except Excom. It is, essentially, a
democratically controlled student
organization.
One of the main phases of the
llR's activities is its affiliations with
other and subsidiary organizations.
For the U.S. National Students As
sociation the lIR acts as Interna
tional Commission of the Stanford
NSA, as the International Commis
sion of the California-Nevada-Ha
waii region, as the national office for
Far Eastern affairs under the U.S.
NSA, and similarly as national of
fice for Inter-American affairs.
The lIR also works with the
World Student Service Fund, oper
ates a UN educational center, works
with such international organiza
tions as the UN and UNESCO, and
so on.
Through the lIR, since its incep
tion, Stanford students have sent
nine tons of relief supplies abroad,
have donated $23,800 to world re
construction, have adopted and as
sited N iples University, and aided
rehabilitation and education of the
war-torn world in a score of other
ways.
The lIR has also annually edited
a Stanford Survey Handbook which
provides students going abroad with
the most recent information avail
able on events of student interest,
on student oranizations, and on gen
eral conditions abroad. It includes
tips for the traveler, tables of the
current rates of exchange, and oth
er aids.
Stanford students are encouraged
to look in on the lIR offices. SIRO
can alwnys use help, as can the rest
of lIR. Office hours at the shack
are 3 to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

SlRO—Student International Relief Organization which conducts relief
drives and sends the supplies to the needy in foreign countries; ICC—ln
ternational Conference Committee, which conducts discussion groups on

subjects of international significance;
and, the"I" Club—The Internation
