### FRED TEAGUE 
The Stanford Institute of International Relations has remained active
during the quarter to conduct the foreign affairs of the ASSU under
President Bob Butow.
Six main committees and an executive board and staff comprise the
working machinery of the lIR.
A few of the main committees are:
SlRO—Student International Relief Organization which conducts relief
drives and sends the supplies to the needy in foreign countries; ICC—ln
ternational Conference Committee, which conducts discussion groups on

subjects of international significance;
and, the"I" Club—The Internation
al Club, which promotes close con
tact American and foreign students
on campus.
In addition to the main commit
tees, there are several temporary
and special cortunittees which are
responsible for particular projects.
The executive board is in charge
of llR's operations. This board con
sists of the heads of the six stand
ing committees and the four execu
tive officers of the organization.
Nevertheless, all policy decisions
rest, ultimately, on the authority
of the Excom.
The lIR has no faculty or Uni
versity advisers. It is completely
free from any external domination,
except Excom. It is, essentially, a
democratically controlled student
organization.
One of the main phases of the
llR's activities is its affiliations with
other and subsidiary organizations.
For the U.S. National Students As
sociation the lIR acts as Interna
tional Commission of the Stanford
NSA, as the International Commis
sion of the California-Nevada-Ha
