# ROSE BOWLâ€”'35
## Crimson Beats Reds 39 to 13 
### MORTY NOVICK 
The forward pass, which had
its humble beginning back in
on the plains of West Point,
1913 when Dorias hit Rockne
reached its peak on Pasadena's
field of battle, New Year's Day,
1935.
It was a "dream" game, this Ala
bama - Stanford clash, which saw
the Crimson Tide swallow up the
Indians, 39-13, in a game that pitted
power against passing. And in the
end, Dixie Howell, Alabama's great
All-American back, stood alone on
the field like a huge exclamation
point because he WAS the Rose
Bowl game of 1935.
Howell Reached "Heights"
You can linger for a while down
the long corridors of memory and
look at the Rose Bowl stars out of
yore. There was Heston of Michi
gan . . . and Pollard of Brown
. . . and the marauding "horseman,"
Layden of Notre Dame. But this
Howell reached the "heights," as
they say in sports parlance. You
can't go any further. It's like a man
exceeding his grasp.
Stanford started the scoring pa
rade in the first quarter when full
back Joe Demyanovich's fumble
was recovered by Keith Topping on
the Alabama 22.
From here Grayson drove to the
12 and, on a reverse, "Bones" Ham
ilton moved to the five. Grayson
carried the ball over and Monk
Moscrip converted.
It was now Howell's turn, and he
began threading his passes with
| deathless precision. They came in a
monotonous, machine - like pattern.
Howell Runs to Score
Late in the second period How
ell found a hole over left etackle,
I cut back, and out-raced the entire
! Indian secondary for a 67 - yard
I touchdown, waving a fond adieu
j to his trailing opponents as he
; jogged across the last line.
Stanford's final touchdown was
scored an straight running plays.
! With Grayson and Hamilton lug
sing the ball the Tribesmen went
I 75 yards for the tally with Van Del-
Ian going over from the 12.
In the waning minutes of the
i last period Howell threw a 59-yard
touchdown pass to Don Hutson.
Howel! to Hutson, there's nothing
more to say.
