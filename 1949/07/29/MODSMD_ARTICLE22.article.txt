# One Operetta Well Done, Second Scratchy at Guild
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Guild Theatre is currently offering a double feature eve
ning of German and Austrian operettas, "Der Bettelstudent" and
"Tales of the Vienna Woods."
The first, supposedly the original of "The Student Prince," is
the light and ludicrous story of a bankrupt Polish widow and her

attempts to find rich and titled hus-
bands for her two daughters. The
plot involves most of the population
of Crakow, Poland (who invariably
break into song at the drop of a
cue), including a starved soprano,
a timid prison warden, and an am
orous governor.
As in all operettas, everything is
resolved at the end with a song.
However, the plot in ''Die Bettel
student" can bring no discredit
upon the music. The sound record
ing is nearly perfect, and the gay
mazurkas, waltzes, and love lyrics
come out clear and lovely.
Funny Without Effort
The dances are well staged, the
costumes lavish, and the humor,
while a trifle heavy-handed, is fun
ny without effort. Particularly ex
cellent are the lead tenor, who sings
with a superb bel canto, and the
lyric soprano, whose songs (after
the first one) show a clear, well
controlled register.
"Talcs of the Vienna Woods" suf
fers primarily from a scarred film
track, which occasionally walks a
dainty heroine across the street
with a speed that would make Mel
Patton drop dead from envy. The
broken film and cuts are really un
fortunate in that the best of the
very melodious Strauss music turns
up, in spots, a little worse for the
wear.
Vienna Setting
The settting is Vienna of the pre-
Anschluss days, and the story re
voles around a titled car salesman
and an incognito American million
airess. The leads are no great digs
as singers, but the picture is ade
quately recovered by the mellow
baritone voice and superb mimicroy
af an old Austrian clown named
Schlopf.
