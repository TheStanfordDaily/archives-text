# Kreps Seeks Economic Pact
## 
### 
In a speech given at last
night's session of the annual
Stanford Business Conference,
Dr. Theodore J. Kreps called
for an Atlantic union of civil
liberties countries over and
above the Marshall Plan and the
Atlantic Pact.
The union proposed by Dr. Kreps
would be to provide a free How of
capital and free exchange, and
would extend not only to Europe
and Africa but would also reach
into Asia through the Dutch and
the British.
Without such an Atlantic union,
the Business School economist said,
the future looks dim for Truman's
new foreign economic program, due
to the irreconcilable divergence in
attitudes of the United States and
foreign countries toward "business
! in government." A further advan
i tage of such an arrangement he
I cited as the probability that Dutch
1 and British efforts might be resent
| ed as imperialistic were they to op
! erate as nationalistic states, where
j as this would not be the case if they
! worked in a union with the United
States, < H; j Jfc
Breach Prevents Development
The breach in view between this
I country and the so-called "back
1 ward nations," he pointed out, will
i not permit economic development
by private capital. Under these cir
cumstances, warned Dr. Kreps, we
| must take care that we are not
forced to shift from our role of
t specialists in co-operation to one of
j specialists in violence.
The program, continued Professor
Kreps, is not one of the Saudi Ara
[ bian type, but rather contemplates
world-wide extension of the type
of economic development carried
j out by Nelson Rockefeller in Latin
; America — "partnership in capital
1 ism." He emphasized that the plan
' is not aimed merely at industriali-
I zation of backward countries, but at
j development of human material —
J the people and their work habits
| and attitudes.
To make possible such a program,
he noted, we must recognize that
imperialism is dead or dying. We
j must teach other nations "the dig
i nity of overalls," and also must put
| forward another freedom—freedom
j from arrogance toward other peo
| pie's ways of doing things.
Corporations Lack Power
Private corporations, Kreps pre-
I dieted, would not do the job. al
| though they have the know-how.
! since it is governments that have
the power.
As for the recipients of this aid.
j he said, they must do away with
j discriminatory controls of foreign
investment and the fear of confisca
tion.
j Concluding, Kreps denied that
this plan was visionary, saying that
much could be expected from "men
under 40 —the kind of men who
wrote our Constitution."
