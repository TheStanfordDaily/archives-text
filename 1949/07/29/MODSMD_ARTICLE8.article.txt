# Palo Alto Man May Receive Millions From Discovery of 'Mystery Bottle'
## 
### 
Fifty-five-year-olcl Jack J. Wurm
of Palo Alto holds a scrap of brown
wrapping paper that may bring him
half of a $12,000,000 estate left by
the heii'ess to the Singer Sewing
Machine fortune.
The document, enclosed in a bot
tle, was discovered by Wurm last
night when he stumbled over it on
a San Francisco beach. On it is
written in pencil:
"Share and share alike with my
attorney, Barry ohen, and the finder
of this bottle." It was signed "Daisy
Alexander."
Several of Daisy Alexander's
friends, as well as her attorney, at
test to the fact that the woman was
fascinated by floating bottles, and
that it is very likely she may have
cast the bottle into the sea. A 40-
year-old will was the only other
will which could be found for the
estate.
Attorney Barry Cohen, British
executor of the Alexander estate,
announced that he was having the
matter investigated with the great
est care. He revealed, that since the
heiress was inclined to put notes in
bottles, it fitted in with the pattern
shown by the discovery made by
Wurm. He added that if the affair
were a hoax, he expected his in
quiry to expose it.


JACK J. YVURM of Palo Alto
holds the paper he allegedly
found in a floating bottle. The
paper may be the long-sought will
of Daisy Alexander, deceased
heiress to the Singer fortune, who
died intestate in England several
years ago.
