## 
### 
The story of a UNESCO mission
I was revealed this week by Dr. Paul
| R. Hanna, Stanford professor of ed
ucation and elementary school ex-
I pert.
Dr. Hanna and three other mem
bers of an international UN com
mission journeyed to the Philippine
Islands early this year at the invi
! tation of the Philippine government
j and at ihe request of the world or-
I ganization.
UCEMP. UNESCO Consultative !
Education Mission of the Philip-
I pines, as the group was named, was i
i charged with the goals of reorgan
| izing the Philippine educational t
! system and promoting '"educational
j leadership lor the Filipinos in keep- j
I ing with the progress of world j
events."

The specific achievements result
ing from the committee s work on a
new Education Code for the islands
cannot yet be made public, but
Professor Hanna says that if suc
cessful, most of the nations of the
world .vill ask for similar surveys
by an impartial group.
UNESCO will send technical as
sistants at the request of any gov
ernment. Although the results are
not yet known, missions are already
in the field in Siam and Abyssinia,
and other requests are pending.
Df. Hanna said the hurdles facing
the team were overshadowed by
the "magnificent demonstration of
a people's eagerness to help
from the outside . . . their welcome
and reception was ... whole-

hearted pouring out of generosity
and hospitality.'
"The Filipinos came through the
Japanese occupation a great people,
demonstrating that they knew the
nature of democratic institutions
and valued them."
Dr. Hanna attributed this talent
for democracy to the experiences
under the original United States
military occupation and the Malay
an racial and cultural background
which taught its people to "do unto
another as you believe he would
have you do it unto him."
Dr. Hanna will speak at the reg
ular Tuesday Evening Series on
Aug. 9. His talk will emphasize the
Philippines as a bulwark of de
mocracy in the Orient.
