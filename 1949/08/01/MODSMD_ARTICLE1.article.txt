# Folk-Song Duo Perform To Receptive Audience
## 
### BOB BERKA 
Josef Marais and Miranda presented their folk songs before
an especially appreciative and large audience in Memorial Hall
last Friday.
And it is no wonder the audience was appreciative. The pair
had a stage manner which can be compared to that of the Lunts.

►■It seemed, throughout the program,
that these people were the kind
you would like to have visit you
!at home some evening. They were
charming.
Josef i-nd Miranda sat on a wide
wooden chair on the stage to sing
their folk songs. The program ap
peared to be completely unre
hearsed. Josef strummed his guitar.
Miranda smiled coyly, and joined
him in the singing of the folk songs.
They seemed to thoroughly enjoy
singing for the audience.
Open with Theme
The program opened with their
theme, "Saraie Marais." They then
sang a group of songs of the Afri
can veld. Slyly, with the typical
sense of humor the couple possess,
they sang a translated verse of
"Marching to Pretoria" which Dec
ca would not allow them to put on
wax.
The Ma raises paused briefly after
a few numbers from the veld, and
then returned to the stage to sing
folk songs of a cosmopolitan nature.
They sang a French song, and one
from England and one from Scot
land. They sang a Flemish song;
Flemish is a Dutch dialect.
The two American songs which
the pair sang, "Cripple Creek" and
"The Fox," are songs which have
become popular with American folk
singers. Actually both songs had
their beginning in the music halls
of 18th century England.
Folk Song Rhythm
To show the rhythm of folk songs
from interi'or Africa, Josef and Mi
randa sang two Bantu tribal songs,
"The Cricket" and "Unga Wena
Wena." The latter, incidentally, has
been recorded by Woody Herman.
The Maraises ended their pro
gram with "Old Johnnie Goggabie,"
a song which gets its humor from
the unfortunate name of this man,
whose name means "insect" in Afri
kaans. They walked off the stage,
but the audience would have none
of it.
And the Maraises, obligingly,
were called back five or six times
to play songs which the audience
requested. It seemed that nearly
everyone in the audience had a fa
vorite :;ong, and the Maraises were
swamped with called titles from the
audience.
Popular Songs Next
They then played and sang some
more of their most popular songs.
These included "Brandy," a plain
tive song which begins "Brandy,
leave me alone," and "Waltzing Ma
thilda."
"Waltzing Mathilda" was made
popular in this country by Ameri
can soldiers who had learnedd it
from Australian and New Zealand
troops in the South Pacific.
The song tells the story of a wan
derer who steels a sheep and is ap
prehended. Rather than be caught
and punished, the wanderer jumps
into a river and is drowned. Al
though the song is sung in English,
words are substituted for "wander
er," "sheep," "river," and the other
important factors in the song.
