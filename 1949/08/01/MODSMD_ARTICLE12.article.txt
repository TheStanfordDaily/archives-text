# President And Mrs. Sterling Plan Reception
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Wallace Ster
ling will hold an informal summer
reception for faculty, emeriti, ad
ministrative officers, and students
on Thursday evening from 8 to 10.
The setting will be the Memorial
Court of the Stanford Quad, which
will be lit for the occasion by col
ored lanterns and the full moon of
August. To suit the outdoor in
formality of Stanford summer life,
the Sterlings chose to ask their
guests to meet them in the open
court at the entrance of the Inner
Quad.
According to long - memoried
Stanford alumni, this will not be
the first time the lawns and shad
owed arcades of the Memorial
Court have been used for an eve
ning party. The Junior Prom, in the
days when a prom was really a
promenade, offered the junior class
its evening of music, refreshments,
and strolling by lantern-light in
that court. The University's most
famous party, during its Fiftieth
Anniversary festivities, was also
held "in the Quad by moonlight,"
as the pioneer Stanford song ad
vises.
A summer president's reception
is a new "tradition," however, in
spired by the wish of the president
and his wife to meet all the Stan
ford family, including those who
can stay one quarter only.
No formal invitations are being
issued, but the outdoor at-home is
open to all faculty, emeriti, enrolled
students and their wives. Dr. and
Mrs. Lawrence Kimpton and the
president and vice-president of the
ASSU, Leonard Ely and Lois
Croonquist, will assist in receiving
the guests, who will be introduced
by Marianna Olmstead. in charge of
the summer recreation program.
Heads of the academic departments
and their wives are asked as aides
in hospitality. A group of Stanford
women students will assist at the
refreshment tables.
