(UP). â€” The Navy sent a special
board of inquiry here today to in
vestigate the crash of an airliner
which was rammed in the air by a
stunting Navy Hellcat fighter plane,
killing 16 persons.
The Fourth Naval District at
Philadelphia appointed the four
man board. The Civil Aeronautics
Board, meanwhile, also was ques
tioning witnesses of the crash and
surveying the wreckage for "fac
tual evidence."
The CAB roped off the scene
where the Eastern Airline D-3, its
wing ripped off in the air. smashed
into an alfalfa field and burned at
11:30 a.m. Saturday. It was the
first fatal crash of a scheduled air
line plane in 11 months.
A witness to the collision, George
Humphrey, said the Navy fighter
"buzzed" his Piper Cub plane twice,
then zoomed up in a fast turn and
smacked into the airliner.
