### 
CHICAGO, July 31 (UP).â€”Cool |
breezes routed a week - long heat
wave from the Rockies to the East
ern seaboard today, but the nation |
counted at least 173 persons dead.
A United Press survey showed i
that 82 persons had died from I
causes attributed to the heat since I
last Sunday, and that 91 had |
drowned.
The cool front had wafted out of j
Canada, chasing temperatures that
had mounted over 100 degrees in
some areas and the sticky humidity
that went with them.
San Francisco was recovering
from a freak electrical storm in the
Bay Area yesterday in which light- i
ning felled at least 30 power line
poles. Several communities were j
blacked out for brief periods.
Rain at Oakland measured only
.05 inch, but that was more than
the city had seen in any entire i
month of July since 1929.
