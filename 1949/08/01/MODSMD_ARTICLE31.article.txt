# Paulman Saved '36 Bowl With 62-yd. Clutch Kick
## 
### MORTY NOVICK 
At 4:55 by the watch, on the first day of January, 1936, "Come
Join the Band"—Stanford's victory song—began booming out
across Pasadena's Rose Bowl.
The song was unfamiliar to many in the mob of 80,000 as they
headed for the exits in long ribbon-like streams. Unfamiliar,

yes, but long overdue as far as,
Stanford was concerned.
In six attempts at the mythical
football coronet, the Indians had
been kicked around the bowl by
the Arroyo Seco more than a hat in
a barroom free-for-all. However, j
in 1936 SMU had no kick coming,
as Willie Howard used to say.
Stanford had a kick corning,
though. One kick and it won the
Rose Bowl game.
With the ball deep in Stanford |
territory in the first quarter, Bill ,
Paulman got off a quick kick that
sailed 62 yards through the air, j
finally xolling dead on the SMU 10.
It was the greatest boot in Rose j
Bowl history.
The Mustangs were forced to kick
and Jimmy Coffis returned the ball j
19 yards to the SMU 41. On the
next play Coffis, running like a I
barefoot boy with a hot foot, made i
an over-the-shoulder catch of Ham- j
ilton's looping pass and ran to the
19. Bobby Grayson then carried the j
ball to the 12, and Hamilton cut j
over center to the one. On a quar- j
terback sneak Pau'.man carried it i
over. Moscrip's conversion was per- j
feet.
As the onrushing gloaming began i
to fingertip the edges of the ram- I
bling old bowl, Bobby Wilson found j
the mark. With his deadly right
arm slinging 'em through, the Mus- !

tangs pushed down to our 33.
Wilson then shot a pass over cen
ter to Shuford who lateraled to Tip
ton, who then lateraled to Finley.
i This razzle-dazzle display with the
pigskin, Texas style, ended up on
the five. However, on the next play
the sleight -of - hand routine went
astray when Finley fumbled the
| ball on a double reverse. Keith
Topping recovered for Stanford on
the three.
! It was now a battle against time.
Again and again Grayson and Cof
fis and Hamilton thwarted the Mus
. tang aerial circus. Keith Topping
! and Monk Moscrip, Stanford ends,
! played savagely with an utter dis
| regard for physical injury, although
; the Monk, himself, had a bad knee
j and wore a jaw protector.
Long before the final gun went off
! the mob was on its feet cheering
with such gusto it seemed to shake
| the very bowels of the stadium.
''We want Paulman ... we want
! Paulman," they began chanting.

! Paulman," they began chanting.
At 4:55 by the watch, on the first day of January, 1936, "Come
Join the Band"—Stanford's victory song—began booming out
across Pasadena's Rose Bowl.
The song was unfamiliar to many in the mob of 80,000 as they
headed for the exits in long ribbon-like streams. Unfamiliar,

yes, but long overdue as far as,
Stanford was concerned.
In six attempts at the mythical
football coronet, the Indians had
been kicked around the bowl by
the Arroyo Seco more than a hat in
a barroom free-for-all. However, j
in 1936 SMU had no kick coming,
as Willie Howard used to say.
Stanford had a kick corning,
though. One kick and it won the
Rose Bowl game.
With the ball deep in Stanford |
territory in the first quarter, Bill ,
Paulman got off a quick kick that
sailed 62 yards through the air, j
finally xolling dead on the SMU 10.
It was the greatest boot in Rose j
Bowl history.
The Mustangs were forced to kick
and Jimmy Coffis returned the ball j
19 yards to the SMU 41. On the
next play Coffis, running like a I
barefoot boy with a hot foot, made i
an over-the-shoulder catch of Ham- j
ilton's looping pass and ran to the
19. Bobby Grayson then carried the j
ball to the 12, and Hamilton cut j
over center to the one. On a quar- j
terback sneak Pau'.man carried it i
over. Moscrip's conversion was per- j
feet.
As the onrushing gloaming began i
to fingertip the edges of the ram- I
bling old bowl, Bobby Wilson found j
the mark. With his deadly right
arm slinging 'em through, the Mus- !

tangs pushed down to our 33.
Wilson then shot a pass over cen
ter to Shuford who lateraled to Tip
ton, who then lateraled to Finley.
i This razzle-dazzle display with the
pigskin, Texas style, ended up on
the five. However, on the next play
the sleight -of - hand routine went
astray when Finley fumbled the
| ball on a double reverse. Keith
Topping recovered for Stanford on
the three.
! It was now a battle against time.
Again and again Grayson and Cof
fis and Hamilton thwarted the Mus
. tang aerial circus. Keith Topping
! and Monk Moscrip, Stanford ends,
! played savagely with an utter dis
| regard for physical injury, although
; the Monk, himself, had a bad knee
j and wore a jaw protector.
Long before the final gun went off
! the mob was on its feet cheering
with such gusto it seemed to shake
| the very bowels of the stadium.
''We want Paulman ... we want
! Paulman," they began chanting.
