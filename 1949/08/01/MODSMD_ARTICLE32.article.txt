# Stadium Will Have 'New Look' For Fall Grid Season Opening
## 
### DON SEYDEL 
The seats in the Stanford stadium may not be any softer
next year—but they will have an attractive "new look" as a
lesult of the beehive of activity centered over there this summer.
Yes—the stadium is getting its regular two-year coat of paint,
covering not only the seats but trimming around the inside of

the stadium and equipment outside.H
The seats were the first to be start- [
ed on, around the beginning of
July. Most of the painting of the
bleachers should be completed to
day, with possibly some touching
up left foi tomorrow morning.
As to color, the tiers of wooden
"chairs" have become a uniform
brown, the same color as they have
been painted in the past. The work
as being done first with a spray gun
and then painted in by hand with a
brush.
The painter operating the spray
apparatus leads the procession, fol
lowed by men brushing the paint
evenly into the wood. At present,
seven painters are occupied with
• his particular task. The amount of
paint used to cover the seating
space for close to 1)0,000 people is
enormous—over 2,000 gallons. The
. jaint takes up 40 drums of 52-gal
ton capacity each.
Alter the bleachers are completed,
the crew will proceed to work oh
"'he trimming. The traditional red
will add a brilliant flare of color
igainst a green background on the
lower railings. The ticket booths
outside are also a gay Cardinal red.
Work on the trimming is expected
to be completed in about two
weeks. Next task for the painters
js the tunnels. As the tunnels have
j lot been painted within recent his
• ory no accurate measure as to the
time needed for them is available,
although progress on other parts of
\he stadium places the estimate of
time at about two weeks.
So. as you traipse merrily over to
■the first of the eight Stanford home
games next fall, remember the good .
souls who had to soak their hands
in turpentine every night for two
months so that the spectators might j
enjoy not only the games but the I
looks of the stadium.
