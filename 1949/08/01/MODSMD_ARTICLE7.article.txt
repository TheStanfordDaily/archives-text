# Rainstorm Misses Swimming Party
## 
### ED CASWELL 
Fortunately for the GO or 70 stu
dents vvho attended the swimming
party Saturday afternoon, ASSU
chose the safest slice of a stormy
day. No rain fell at the party.
Everyone was kept busy by
games and by the impromptu em
cee. George Velliotes, who took
over for Dean Borba. While many
party-goers lounged at the pool or
played at the volleyball courts,
more watched Velliotes' antics at
the mike.
Several relays were held. Among
them was-included carrying a ping
pong ball in a spoon, held in tile
mouth, across the pool.
Outstanding event of the after
noon was George's strip-tease on
the high board, proving men still
could outdo women in any field, as
Velliotes put it. Afterward George
and Sue Marion exhibited a male
versus female diving contest.
Frizes were awarded the winners
of each contest.
