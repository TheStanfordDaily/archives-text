HONOLULU. Aug. 2 —The Ha
waiian Senate today rejected by a
one - vote margin a move by a
seven-man bloc to revive Governor
Ingram Stainback's original seizure
plan for reopening Hawaii's strike
bound ports.
By a vote of 8-7, the 15 - man
Senate defeated an amendment,
backed by Attorney General Wal
ter Ackerman, that called for a 90-

has frozen Hawaiian ports since
May 1 in a demand for increased
wages.
