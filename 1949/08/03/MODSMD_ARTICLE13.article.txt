## Paying A Debt 
### 
Stanford owes a great debt to the late Dr. William Webster
Hansen for the work he did in scientific research, and for the
effort and ability he put, as its head, into the development of the
Microwave Laboratory.
Stanford can recognize that debt by renaming that laboratory
the William Webster Hansen Microwave Laboratory in his honor.
We feel that would be a fitting tribute a man who contributed
so much to the world through his scientific research.
Dr. Frederick Terman, dean of the School of Engineering, said,
"He is credited with working out most of the microwave tech
niques used during the war."
While Dr. Hansen was a professor of physics at Stanford he
designed and developed the University's atom smasher, which
is installed in the laboratory.
He was a pioneer in radar development, and his work in that
field contributed greatly to his untimely death. Dr. Hansen
developed pneumonia during his work to perfect radar. A trip
to England last year to further his work aggravated the condition,
and he died in May.
A graduate of Stanford at the age of 20, Dr. Hansen joined the
staff the next year, and soon earned the Ph.D. degree in physics.
He concentrated then on finding a more effective way to smash
the atom, and in 1934 he invented a cavity resonator.
After his work in the field of radar during the war, Dr. Hansen
returned to Stanford to work on the discovery of new laws of
nature, and it was then that he was engaged in extensive research
work as the head of the Microwave Laboratory.
Recognition of Dr. Hansen's work has been universal.
He was awarded the Liebman Memorial Prize for outstanding
work in radio engineering in 1944, and was elected to the
National Academy of Sciences last April.
We feel that it is only fitting that Stanford also recognize the
contributions Dr. Hansen made in scientific research by naming
the Microwave Laboratory for him.
