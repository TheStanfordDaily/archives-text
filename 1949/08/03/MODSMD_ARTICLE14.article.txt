To the Editor:
By all means stick to your guns in your defense of the "no smoking on
Quad tradition. I, for one, feel that the request made by Mrs. Stanford
should be honored, not only because she made it, but for the reason that
the Inner Quad is a beautiful place steeped with Stanford history and
ti adition, deserving better than the ministrations of individuals who regard
it as their right to smoke wherever and whenever it so pleases them.
