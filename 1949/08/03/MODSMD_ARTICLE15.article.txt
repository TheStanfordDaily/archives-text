# Sporting Chaps at Press Print Saga of SF Cable Car
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The versatile Stanford University Press, a monument to advanced learn
ing, recently sent to the Daily a large-lettered, color-illustrated kiddies'
book titled ''Cable Car Joey."
What with the recent fight over abolishing San Francisco cable-cars,
the book is certainly a timely stroke for their continued use. However,
the kiddies for whom it was evidently intended. English grad students and
professors emeriti, are not very influential. Speaking for the former,
though, we enjoyed it very much.
The thin little volume tells the story of Joey's first attempt to climb Bush
Street, while a bunch of spoil-sport capitalists stand in the valley below
and scoff. He makes it, though, and slides back down into the happy arms
of his father (a horse-trolley) and his mother (a demure sedan-type trol
ley). He is a success.
Joey lives through the 1906 earthquake and is decorated, shortly there
after with a gold mustache, which, believe me. is the last word in cable
car attire.
The book ends with Joey shedding a few metallic tears over the passing
of the old days, but promising to keep a stiff upper a-eh-windshield.
The type, the pictures, the continuity, the Englishâ€”all these are splen
did, except the price, which is a buck ninety-five.
Anyway, the cover is tough and stiff and should take the average three
year-old a full 45 minutes to eat his way through.
