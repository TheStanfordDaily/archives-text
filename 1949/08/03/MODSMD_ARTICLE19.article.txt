### MORTY NOVICK 
Bursting upon the scene like an
exploding star shell, Pete Kmeto
vic, a with larceny in his feet
and heart, stole the 1941 Rose Bowl
show as he paced a "Cinderella"
Stanford eleven to a heart-pound
ing victory over Nebraska, 21-13.
rwice during the contest—called
by many the greatest of 'em all—it
seemed the eleven good men and
true would be slugged into an early
midnight. But twice the Indians got
up irom the turf, wiped themselves
oil, and came roaring back.
The big, burly, powerful Coin
luiskers wasted little time in scor
ing their first touchdown. Ripping
the Stanford line to shreds, they
marched 48 yards for a touchdown
with Vike Francis going over from
the two. Francis also added the
extra point.
Kmetovic Runs
A bad punt gave Stanford the ball
on the Nebraska 47. Pete Kmetovic,
on his first running assignment,
carried the ball to the 17. From
there Hugh Gallarneau went over
tor the score. Quarterback Frankie
Albert ridded the extra point.
Again Nebraska came back to
take over the lead in the second
quarter when Herman Rohrig
passed to Zikmund in the end zone.
Ihe score had been set up by
Kme to vic's fumble on the Stanford
00.
Gallarneau in Motion
Time was running out on the first
half when Albert, working his dark
magic out of the "T." sent Gallar
neau in motion. The Huskers
thought he was just a decoy. Drop
ping back, Albert shot a spot pass
to the running Gallarneau. who
grabbed the ball on the Nebraska
jO, and went all the way for the
tying touchdown. Albert converted
and the Indians led for the first
time.
In the second half the Indians
seem to have lost their opening jit
ters and began battling the Ne
braskans on even terms.
The Nebraskans stopped a Stan
ford drive on the one but had to
kick froni their own end - zone.
Harry Hopp got off a high spiral
which bounced once on the Ne
braska 40.
Kmetovic Again
Kmetovic, playing safety, scooped
up the ball and started to his left.'
He was hemmed in by three charg

and a feint, and was off down the
sidelines like a circus tight - rope
walker. With blocking by Rod
Parker, Dick Palmer. Albert, and
Chuck Taylor. Kmetovic raced into
the end zone, a symphony in mo
tion.
Albert again added the extra
point. However, it wasn't necessary.
Nebraska was all through.
And so on its fiftieth anniversary
Stanford ended up the pre - War
years on an optimistic note. The
Farm's great football teams out of
yore have left memories mellowed
with age. Football has a deep heri
tage in college life. They seem to
be inseparable, like spinach with
mashed potatoes.
