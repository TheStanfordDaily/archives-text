# 'The Meanest Thief' Steals Bike of Boy Who Found the Axe
## 
### 
Larry Bacon, the little boy who
found the Stanford Axe last year
near the golf course, had his bicycle
stolen Monday night.
The thief knocked down the bar
riers to the driveway and took the
bicycle about 3 a.m.
Larry, who will be 11 years old
Friday, is living at Manzanita with
his folks. He earned the money
himself to buy the bicycle.
It's a Montgomeiy Ward bicycle,
red with a white stripe, and has
balloon tires. No questions will be
asked when it is returned.
Larry would like to have his bi
cycle back.
