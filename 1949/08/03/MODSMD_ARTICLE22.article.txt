LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2 (UP).â€”
Harry (Stubby) Kruger, former
Olympics diver, said today lie was
the perpetrator of a theft that
rocked amateur sports circles 25
years ago.
Kruger, now a comedian with
Buster Crabbe's professional water
circus troupe, said he stole the 1924
Olympic Games flag as a souvenir
from a staff where it flew in Paris
after the close of the international
games there. Its disappearance and
that of the Finnish flag which Hew
with the Olympics banner were a
mystery at that time.
Thursday night. Kruger said, he
will present the Olympics banner
to Helms Hall, home of the Helms
Athletic Foundation. The presen
tation will take place during the
opening performance here of the
Crabbe Aqua Parade, which will be
attended by nearly 100 former
Olympics stars.
