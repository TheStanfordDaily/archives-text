# New KZSU Show Gives S.F. Facts
## 
### 
If you've been looking for quick,
easy trips on where to go and
what to do in San Francisco and
adjoining areas, listen to "Your Bay
Area Host" on Station KZSU every
Thursday night at 7:15. Dwight
Mindling gives background notes on
San Francisco lore, as well as a cal
endar of events in the Bay Area.
Starting tomorrow, Mindling will
describe a landmark on the Penin
sula, then ask a question about
some phase of this history high
spot. The two listeners who first
call or write to Station KZSU with
the correct answer will be awarded
tickets to Adobe Creek Lodge. The
tickets will admit winners and
their guests to swimming, dancing,
and picnicking at the recreation
spot.
