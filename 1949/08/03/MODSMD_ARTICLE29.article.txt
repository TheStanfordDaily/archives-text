# Lou Henry Hoover Room Opens Doors To Visitors
## 
### 
The Lou Henry Hoover Room,*
displaying rare objects and items I
of historical interest which be- I
longed to the late wife of former
President Herbert Hoover, is now
open to visitors to the Hoover In
stitute and Library at Stanford.
The exhibit room, one of two on I
the entrance floor of the library
which Mr. Hoover founded, honors I
the memory of her years of part
nership in all his activities. The
Hoovers met as students at Stan
ford, and she shared her husband's
achievements from early mining
days through years of public serv
ice.
Mrs. Hoover died in New York in
1944. Opening of the room was de
layed by its wartime use as study
quarters for an Army and Navy
Officers' Civil Affairs Training
School, carried on by the Hoover
Institute and Library. â€¢
As a result, the Lou Henry Hoo
ver Room was only recently opened
to the public, simply and without
ceremony.
It was purely a fortunate coinci
dence, Hoover Institute officials
said, that the opening of the room j
came at a time when Stanford was 1
making preparations to Honor Mr.
Hoover on his 75th birthday, Aug. i
10. Mr. Hoover will observe the
occasion by making a major na- J
tional address from Laurence Frost
Amphitheater on the campus.
The new exhibit room is open to [
the public daily from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. The library is closed Sundays. |
The 285-foot tower of the library,
commanding a sweeping view of the
Santa Clara Valley, is open to visi
tors from 1 to 5 p.m. weekdays, and
from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m. !
Saturdays.
