# Crowd Enjoys Farm Concert

### ED CASWELL 
Jan Popper and the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra played a con
cert of contemporary music to an en
thusiastic crowd at Memorial Audi
torium last night. *They demon
strated that the worth of contempo
rary music is not to be lightly dis
carded.
Mr. Ernst Bacon, artist-in-resi
dence at the University this sum
mer, also directed the orchestra in
the first West Coast presentation of
his work, "From These States."
First on the program was William
Bergsman's "Paul Bunyan Suite," a
suite depicting the legendary giant
of the Northwest and his big blue
ox. The epic glory of the woods
men was excellently portrayed in
the rich, powerful music of the third
part.
Marni Nixon, soprano, sang the
beautiful solo of the Chinese Flute,
by Toch. Her good feeling for the
melancholy of the piece, however,
missed in the awful torture of part
IV, Sao Han, when a rat sinks his
talons into her. Much-applauded
Miss Nixon exhibited fine restraint
in her execution of the weird chant,
and Anita Barrett, violin, and Mar
jorie Kline, flute, told the fanciful
tale delicately.
The Saluda Barn Dance, in its
Sandburg simplicity, and the Wiz
ard Oil, ending so quaintly, the au
dience agreed were best in Mr.
Bacon's work.
"From These States" had the rich
body so many people like to find
in modern music, and which was
missing so much in the other pieces,
Kohs' "Legend" for oboe and strings,
and Hovhaness's "Kohar."
