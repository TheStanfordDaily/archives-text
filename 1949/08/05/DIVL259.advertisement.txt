Dear Little Joe:
On Sunday night, July 24, 1949, I ate Pizza and drank a bottle of
wine at your excellent establishment. We did not have enough
money with us to pay the full bill. The wine, I believe, was never
paid for. You were gracious enough to allow us to eat and drink
our fill anyway and said you would let us pay later for the excess.
My friends and I are grateful to you for your kindness. I have
enclosed a check for two dollars. This should he more than enough
to cover the cost of the bottle of wine. If it is not let me know the
next time I come in and I shall complete the payment. If the two
dollars is in excess of the amount required, please give the differ
ence to the tall, dark-haired girl who served our table.
I am looking forward to many excellent meals with you. Thank
you again for your kindness.
Sincerely yours,
