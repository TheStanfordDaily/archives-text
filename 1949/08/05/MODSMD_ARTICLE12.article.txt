"The Man Who Could Work Mir
acles," one of the modern machine
age creations of author H. G. Wells,
will play on the screen at Mem Aud
this Sunday evening at 7:30.
Mr. Wells, who delights in brewing
up such fantasies to speak his social
ideas, has given Roland Young a per

membered from the "Topper" series,
prospers in the part of a man who
is the victim of mystic powers beyond
his control. An old British film, it is
produced by Alexander Korda.
Chapter 8 of "Don Q" will rescue
Dolores Q from behind her boxes,
and, promises Howard Miller, chair
man for the movies, "her 'boy friend*
will unearth himself from the billion
tons of refuse in time for a love af
far." Untoward thrlls are expected.
A cartoon, "Shell - shocked Egg,"
will also be shown.
