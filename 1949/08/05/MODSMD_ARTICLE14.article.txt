B.v ANDY JORDAN and BILL KOCH
The Mundt-Ferguson Bills (S-1194 and S-119t>), now facing a vote in
the Senate Judiciary Committee as the Mundt-Ferguson-Johnston Bill
(S-2311), are a rehash of last year's Mundt-Nixon Bill, which was buried
in a Senate sub-committee by overwhelming public protest.
Only this year's bill "sharpens the teeth and expands the bite" in
the words of Mr. Mundt, a co-author.
In order to accomplish this the hill sets tip a Subversive Activities
Commission, which recognizes two types of so-called "subversive" or
ganizationsâ€”"Communist political organizations" and '"Communist front
organizations."
The former is contended to be dominated by the (unnamed) foreign
government which controls the world Communist movement and operates
to achieve the ends of that movement (which are, according to the bill,
to set up a foreign dominated totalitarian dictatorship).
The Communist front is, however, alleged to be under the control of the
Communist political organization and operates primarily to achieve its
ends.
These organizations, along with their members, are required to register
as such. Penalties lor failure to register include heavy fines and jail sen
tences.
Registrants Worse Off
If the organization and its members do register, their fate is much
worse. By legislative fiat, such registered organizations and the members
thereof are found to be guilty of conspiracy, disloyalty, and sedition, and
may presumably be prosecuted accordingly.
Both the"due process" and "self-incrimination" clauses of the Fifth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are violated by this procedure. It is
clear that the mere exercise of freedom of speech and assembly or associa
tion can subject an organization (and its members) to the bill's penalties, <
whereas the First Amendment states that "Congress shall make no law
. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the right of
people peaceably to assemble. . .
Ex-Attorney General Tom Clark admitted that "it can be assumed that
no organization would confess guilt by registration . . ." (page 424, Hear
ings on H.R. 5852). The authors' claim that the bill will only serve to
disclose so-called "subversives" is absurd.
"The fact is that the bill envisages not that any organization will reg
ister. but rather that individuals will be relentlessly prosecuted for be
longing to organizations which have failed to register" (page 3, The Bill
of Rights and the Mundt-Ferguson Bills, National Lawyers' Guild).
How will this bill affect the country? All progressive, liberal, civil
rights, and other minority organizations and labor unions can be de
stroyed. Clearly this bill seeks to destroy organized, political and eco
nomical opposition to the bi-partisan domestic and foreign programs of
the Republicans and Democrats.
Workers who ask for higher wages, those who fight against Negro dis
crimination and segregation, and organizations which call for more public ,
housing, have at various times been termed "communistic" and "subver
sive." The Mundt-Ferguson bills are in effect branding all disagreement
with the Administration as a conspiracy to set up a foreign controlled
totalitarian dictatorship.
Authors Fear Change
These bills have been designed by men who are not concerned with the
well-being of Americans. Mundt and Ferguson are fearful of the demo
cratic process of change.
This legislation is not compatible with traditional American democracy.
It is well worth observing the words of Thomas Jefferson (Notes on Vir
ginia, Query 17). "Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your
inquisitors? Fallible men; men governed by bad passions, by private as
well as public reasons."
