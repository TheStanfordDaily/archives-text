Four years of tedious negotiations in the United Nations, the clamoring
of liberals for "values and conducts and loyalties." and a post-war real
istic outlook diluted by general feelings of insecurity over the future of
this countryâ€”all have at their core the one question that remains to be
answered today. Can freedom and order be reconciled?
Edgar Robinson in his ' The New United States" approaches the prob
lem with the historian's insight when he calls for a new "synthesis." a
reinterpretation of social forces and ideas belonging to our past. For it is
through them, he believes, that we may adjust to the unusual conditions
imprinted upon our national life by the last war: but we may also regain
the spiritual hope and resolution needed to "build a structure within which
men can live in security and dignity and peace. . . ."
The individualism that was born of the frontier, ruthless as it often was.
and mixed with metaphysical ideas and theology, contained the germ of
democratic faith which could not be defeated in spite ot hardships of all
kinds. Mr. Robinson traces the development of this faith from our agrarian
p?ist and through the period of industrialization to the eve of the war's end.
The symbols of this faith were order and the freedom of the individual.
Its results were growth and opportunity, equality and the capacity tor
self-government.
The lesson that we might learn from a clearer recognition of the
history of our ideals is that "democracy cannot be provided by law. can
not be produced at will, and rests on long adaptation." The waters of
disillusionment already appear to be backed up against an unstable dike
of peace, of an Atlantic Charter, and of "mild recession" g "Democ
racy as we piactice it cannot .save us."
