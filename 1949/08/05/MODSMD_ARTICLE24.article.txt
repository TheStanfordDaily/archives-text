Dr. Hans Staub, Stanford nu
clear physicist, will leave the
University Aug. 15 for his na
tive Switzerland where he has
been appointed professor of ex
perimental physics and director
of the Institute of Physics at the
University of Zurich.
Dr. Staub. who has specialized in !
the field of nuclear physics since the
early 1930's when he began work for !
the Ph D. at Switzerland's Federal
Institute of Technology, believes his
appointment indicates a shift in em- !
phasis toward nuclear physics in the I
Swiss university's physics depart- !
ment.
"Europe is so depleted of physi
cists that universities are looking to '
the United States for faculty replace- !
merits," Dr. Staub said yesterday."I
sincerely regret leaving the United |
States, and already I am homesick '
for California."
Dr. Staub came to this country in |
19.J7 as a fellow of the Institute of
International Education at the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology. He I
has been on the Stanford faculty !
.since 1938. He holds the rank of pro- '
lessor of physics.
While at Stanford he helped build
the University's 27'->-inch cyclotron,
and with Dr. Felix Bloch and Dr. j
David Nicodemus, two other Stan- j
ford physicists, conducted research j
on the polarization, magnetic mo- I
ment, and angular velocity of ncu- j
trons.
During the war Dr. Staub was en
gaged in experimental work at Stan
ford and at Los Alamos on the Man- :
hattan atomic bomb project.
Dr. Staub was last in Switzerland j
in 1947 when he visited his parents i
in Zurich. He made one other visit I
in 1939.
The Stanford physicist, his wife,
and his three daughters will drive
