# Student Officers To Read Service
## 
### 
The Book of Job is a study of
perennial interest. On Sunday
morning Chaplain Johnston will
preach on the topic "Disinterested
Goodness?" The question-mark is
used since the theme arises from
Satan's famous question: "Does Job
serve God for naught?"
The readers for the service will
be Leonard Ely Jr., president of the
student body, and Lois Croonquist,
vice-president. The summer Uni
versity Choir will sing at the serv
ice.
Next Sunday, Aug. 14, Stanford

Church pulpit the chaplain of Rut
gers University, Rev. Dr. Bradford
S. Abernathy. Dr. Abernathy is cur
rent president of the National As
sociation of University hCaplains.

Lake Tahoe, sponsored by the
American Friends Service Commit
tee.
Candlelight services continue at
the church each Wednesday eve
ning from 9 to 9:30. All are wel
come.
