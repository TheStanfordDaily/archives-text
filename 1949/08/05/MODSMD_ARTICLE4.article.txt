# Larry's Birthdayâ€” Bike Still Missing
## 
### 
Larry Bacon's red and white bi
cycle is still missing.
It has been lost since Monday
night when a thief knocked down
barriers to a garage to steal it.
Larry, who is living at Manzanita,
hopes the bike will come back today
for a special reason.
Today is his birthday, and an 11-
year-old really needs a bike.
