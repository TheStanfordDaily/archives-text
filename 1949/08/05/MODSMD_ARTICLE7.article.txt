## 
### CHUCK MILLER 
Shakespeare comes to the campus
again when the Stanford Players
J present ihe tragedy of "Romeo and
j Juliet" from Aug. 11 to 13 in the
Memorial Auditorium.
Francis Strickland, who is direct
i ing this second major production of
! the summer season, refers to his
cast as "all Bay Area" since the
[ residence of the members is en
| tirely local.
James Clancy, a graduate of
Stanford and a favorite of audi
i ences here, will scale the apulets'
balcony as Romeo. The young Ju
liet will be portrayed by Robin
Humphrey. A junior artist-in-resi-
I dence for the summer, she has ap
peared several times on Broadway
with such actors as Gertrude Law
rence and Beatrice Straight.
That member of the gentility and
j challenger of Romeo's sword, Mer
j cutio, will be played by John Mc
j Liam. Having been in several Eq
; uity Library shows in New York
and in movies produced bv the

Navy, he is also here on an acting
fellowship.
Other Cast Members
Other members of the Bay Area
cast include George Wilson as the
friar, the comforter and confidant of
the lovers, and Marian Stebbins,
who will play Juliet's sympathetic
nurse.
Stanford is again fortunate in
having an outstanding designer in
the person of Lee Simonson recre
ate the early Renaissance settings
and costumes. Mr. Simonson has
been an active artist in the New
York Theater Guild for the past 25
years. Among his latest works were
the settings for "Joan of Lorraine,"
"Marco Millions," and the Wagner
ian ycle which was presented last
season by the Metropolitan Opera
Company.
For "Romeo and Juliet" Mr. Si
monson has created a semi-perma
nent setting of warm stucco and
grey stone. It will permit the al
ternate lighting of different parts of
the stage without having tj drop

the curtain between scenes. In this
way "the drive and the speed" i
which many of the scenes attain
will not be lost, and a more fluid, a
more functional continuity will re
sult. Harry ummins, a holder of a
technical fellowship and painter of
the "Now I Lay Me" sets, is doing
the job on "Romeo and Juliet." |
In designing the costumes for the
period of the play, Mr. Simonson
has derived his ideas from some of
the frescoes of the Italian Renais- !
sance. Extracting a style, color, or !
emblem from the clothing of a page j
or courtier, he makes it the princi- j
pal feature of one of his costumes. '
When the first curtain rises on the
scene of a public place in Verona, ;
the costumes will not only be au- j
thentic but will appear true to the i
mood of the play and to the atmos- '
phere of his Italian settings.
Tickets for all three performances
are still available and can be ob
tained it the Auditorium box office. !
or by phoning the Peninsula Box j
Office at DA 2-2122.
