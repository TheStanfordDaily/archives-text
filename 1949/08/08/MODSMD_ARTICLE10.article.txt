# Hoover Coming Into His Own As New U.S. Elder Statesman

### FRED TEAGUE 
(This is the first of two articles
on Herbert Hoover by Teague.)
A great part of the new genera- j
tion that is moving into business :
and government has never heard i
anything spoken of Herbert Clark '
Hoover other than slams at his per- s
sonal character and governmental
conduct.
Until one or twu years ago, and j
since the election of Koosevelt, \
Hoover had been merely a myth. |
a myth that was factually false and |
humanly unjust. New Deal propa- <
ganda had it that Hoover "caused"
a depression and then "did nothing" j
to mitigate its horrors.
Prior to World War II his popu
larity seemed to be at its lowest ebb.
However, he contrived to lower it. j
At the time a wave of pro-USSR
feeling was sweeping the nation.
Hoover did nut approve of the to
talitarian governmental methods of |
the • Soviets.
He suggested, rather, that energy !
be directed to alleviate the suffer- j
ing of the starving children of Nazi- i
held European countries. His pop- I
ularity continued downward.
Feeling of Guilt
Perhaps a feeling of guilt on the |
part of the great American public
has caused the tide to turn recently, i
In 1940 the Republican party con- j
sidered him poisonous to a cam- |
paign—in 1948 he shook the country I
with a speech he made at the Re- j
publican convention.
Where he was branded as "reac
tionary" in the thirties, in 1947 Dr. i
Alvin Johnson, ranking liberal. I
conceded that "among the men of
my time, Hoover has been the !
greatest."
Americans think of Hoover as [
austere f.nd cold — this is wrong. [
Austerity was not one of his char
acter traits. His most obvious quirk j
is shyness—almost physical shrink
ing from strangers, crowds, and
demonstrations.
Speaking informally with a friend !
he is at his best. His voice attains i
a certain richness, not the hearti- I
ness of a hail-fellow-well-met po- '
litico, and his phrases have an un
studied eloquence. He has a phe- j
nomenal memory for anecdotes and [
wit.
Shyness Is Crown
Will Irwin, '98, one of his j
raphers and a classmate, wrote that 1
"this shyness is the crown of his i
personality." A personality that is !
rooted in his beginnings in a small 1
lowa town;
Our thirty - first President was J
boln in a small, humble cottage in
the nearly al! - Quaker village of
West Branch, lowa. Poor and early
orphaned, he spent all of his young !
life in close Quaker homes. His 1
great - grandmother, who lived all
but five years of the nineteenth
century, was the epitome of tradi
tional Quaker matriarchs — pious
and strict. His mother was much
the same.
When young Herbert was but six
years old his father contracted ty
phoid fever and died. Partly to ease
the burden on his mother he was
sent to Oklahoma to spend eight or
nine months with his uncle, an
Indian agent.
At the school they went to he
and his cousin Miles were the only
white youngsters. They played the
Indian games, learned to vise the
bow and arrow, and to hunt and
fish. Three years later his mother

died and he went to live on his
uncle Allen's farm just outside of j
West Branch. He had a number of j
homes in the next eight years.
When he was seventeen he was i
living with his mother's mother,
Grandmother Minthorn. They had j
come to live in Oregon. At the j
time, entrance examinations were
being held for the new Leland
Stanford Jr. University. He took
them but failed. However, he made
a good impression with his pre
cocity in mathematics. In fact, a
Sale in banker paid Hoover's fare to
Palo Alto in exchange for tutoring
lin math for his son.
When he reached Stanford he
took the test again and passed. He
then moved into room 38 at Encina
Hall. He is supposed to have been
the first person to have slept under
the title roof of the "rock." as some
have called it.
Reg Job
By virtue of experience as an of
fice boy he got a job in the Univer
sity office and helped to register the
students on the first reg day.
Hoover played on the frosh base
ball team as shortstop, but his ath
letic career was stopped short as
a nailed a hot grounder and sus
tained an injury to his hand that
kept him out of further competi
tion. His work around the keystone
sack over, he devoted his athletic
energies to the management of var
ious teams.
During Hoover's years on the
Farm there was a bitter political
war for control of the student gov
ernment between the "frats" and
the "barbs." Hoover was on the
side of the "barbs" and it was
largely through his efforts, and
those of young Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who entered school a year later
than he did and gbt the frosh vote,
that the "barbs" won out.
Student Government
During the summer of '93 he
worked for the U.S. Geographical
Survey. His friend, Dr. Branner,
was a great aid in getting him the
position. He spent the summer
thinking along the lines of student
government, and when he came
back to school for his junior year
he had a host of ideas to organize
the tangled campus activities and
government. He wrote the original
ASSU constitution which lasted un
til 1948. His constitution called for
an ASSU treasurer, and friends
urged him to take the position. He
declined because it provided for a
salary and he feared that people
might think that he created the post
for himself. He finally gave in to
those who wanted him as treasurer,
but stipulated that he should not
reccive a cent for his work.
The following summer he worked
again for the survey. During his
senior year at Stanford. Hoover met
Lou Henry, who later became his
wife. Lou was the only girl he ever
had, and when he was traveling he
was quite true to her.
Times were rough when Hoover
i graduated from Stanford. A diplo
ma helped not a whit when he
tramped the streets looking for a
job. However, Herbert Hoover was
made of sterner stuff. He wasn't
! afraid of a little, or a lot of, work.
He got a job at miner's wages in
the Mayflower pits, where he served
j his internship in mining. After a
while he went to mining big-shot
! Louis Janin to look for better fare.

During Hoover's years on the
Farm there was a bitter political
war for control of the student gov
ernment between the "frats" and
the "barbs." Hoover was on the
side of the "barbs" and it was
largely through his efforts, and
those of young Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who entered school a year later
than he did and gbt the frosh vote,
that the "barbs" won out.
Student Government
During the summer of '93 he
worked for the U.S. Geographical
Survey. His friend, Dr. Branner,
was a great aid in getting him the
position. He spent the summer
thinking along the lines of student
government, and when he came
back to school for his junior year
he had a host of ideas to organize
the tangled campus activities and
government. He wrote the original
ASSU constitution which lasted un
til 1948. His constitution called for
an ASSU treasurer, and friends
urged him to take the position. He
declined because it provided for a
salary and he feared that people
might think that he created the post
for himself. He finally gave in to
those who wanted him as treasurer,
but stipulated that he should not
reccive a cent for his work.
The following summer he worked
again for the survey. During his
senior year at Stanford. Hoover met
Lou Henry, who later became his
wife. Lou was the only girl he ever
had, and when he was traveling he
was quite true to her.
Times were rough when Hoover
i graduated from Stanford. A diplo
ma helped not a whit when he
tramped the streets looking for a
job. However, Herbert Hoover was
made of sterner stuff. He wasn't
! afraid of a little, or a lot of, work.
He got a job at miner's wages in
the Mayflower pits, where he served
j his internship in mining. After a
while he went to mining big-shot
! Louis Janin to look for better fare.

A great part of the new genera- j

anything spoken of Herbert Clark '
Hoover other than slams at his per- s
sonal character and governmental
conduct.
Until one or twu years ago, and j
since the election of Koosevelt, \
Hoover had been merely a myth. |
a myth that was factually false and |
humanly unjust. New Deal propa- <
ganda had it that Hoover "caused"
a depression and then "did nothing" j
to mitigate its horrors.
Prior to World War II his popu
larity seemed to be at its lowest ebb.
However, he contrived to lower it. j
At the time a wave of pro-USSR
feeling was sweeping the nation.
Hoover did nut approve of the to
talitarian governmental methods of |
the • Soviets.
He suggested, rather, that energy !
be directed to alleviate the suffer- j
ing of the starving children of Nazi- i
held European countries. His pop- I
ularity continued downward.
Feeling of Guilt
Perhaps a feeling of guilt on the |
part of the great American public
has caused the tide to turn recently, i
In 1940 the Republican party con- j
sidered him poisonous to a cam- |
paign—in 1948 he shook the country I
with a speech he made at the Re- j
publican convention.
Where he was branded as "reac
tionary" in the thirties, in 1947 Dr. i
Alvin Johnson, ranking liberal. I
conceded that "among the men of
my time, Hoover has been the !
greatest."
Americans think of Hoover as [
austere f.nd cold — this is wrong. [
Austerity was not one of his char
acter traits. His most obvious quirk j
is shyness—almost physical shrink
ing from strangers, crowds, and
demonstrations.
Speaking informally with a friend !
he is at his best. His voice attains i
a certain richness, not the hearti- I
ness of a hail-fellow-well-met po- '
litico, and his phrases have an un
studied eloquence. He has a phe- j
nomenal memory for anecdotes and [
wit.
Shyness Is Crown
Will Irwin, '98, one of his j
raphers and a classmate, wrote that 1
"this shyness is the crown of his i
personality." A personality that is !
rooted in his beginnings in a small 1
lowa town;
Our thirty - first President was J
boln in a small, humble cottage in
the nearly al! - Quaker village of
West Branch, lowa. Poor and early
orphaned, he spent all of his young !
life in close Quaker homes. His 1
great - grandmother, who lived all
but five years of the nineteenth
century, was the epitome of tradi
tional Quaker matriarchs — pious
and strict. His mother was much
the same.
When young Herbert was but six
years old his father contracted ty
phoid fever and died. Partly to ease
the burden on his mother he was
sent to Oklahoma to spend eight or
nine months with his uncle, an
Indian agent.
At the school they went to he
and his cousin Miles were the only
white youngsters. They played the
Indian games, learned to vise the
bow and arrow, and to hunt and
fish. Three years later his mother

died and he went to live on his
uncle Allen's farm just outside of j
West Branch. He had a number of j
homes in the next eight years.
When he was seventeen he was i
living with his mother's mother,
Grandmother Minthorn. They had j
come to live in Oregon. At the j
time, entrance examinations were
being held for the new Leland
Stanford Jr. University. He took
them but failed. However, he made
a good impression with his pre
cocity in mathematics. In fact, a
Sale in banker paid Hoover's fare to
Palo Alto in exchange for tutoring
lin math for his son.
When he reached Stanford he
took the test again and passed. He
then moved into room 38 at Encina
Hall. He is supposed to have been
the first person to have slept under
the title roof of the "rock." as some
have called it.
Reg Job
By virtue of experience as an of
fice boy he got a job in the Univer
sity office and helped to register the
students on the first reg day.
Hoover played on the frosh base
ball team as shortstop, but his ath
letic career was stopped short as
a nailed a hot grounder and sus
tained an injury to his hand that
kept him out of further competi
tion. His work around the keystone
sack over, he devoted his athletic
energies to the management of var
ious teams.

tional Quaker matriarchs — pious
and strict. His mother was much
the same.
When young Herbert was but six
years old his father contracted ty
phoid fever and died. Partly to ease
the burden on his mother he was
sent to Oklahoma to spend eight or
nine months with his uncle, an
Indian agent.
At the school they went to he
and his cousin Miles were the only
white youngsters. They played the
Indian games, learned to vise the
bow and arrow, and to hunt and
fish. Three years later his mother

died and he went to live on his
uncle Allen's farm just outside of j
West Branch. He had a number of j
homes in the next eight years.
When he was seventeen he was i
living with his mother's mother,
Grandmother Minthorn. They had j
come to live in Oregon. At the j
time, entrance examinations were
being held for the new Leland
Stanford Jr. University. He took
them but failed. However, he made
a good impression with his pre
cocity in mathematics. In fact, a
Sale in banker paid Hoover's fare to
Palo Alto in exchange for tutoring
lin math for his son.
When he reached Stanford he
took the test again and passed. He
then moved into room 38 at Encina
Hall. He is supposed to have been
the first person to have slept under
the title roof of the "rock." as some
have called it.
Reg Job
By virtue of experience as an of
fice boy he got a job in the Univer
sity office and helped to register the
students on the first reg day.
Hoover played on the frosh base
ball team as shortstop, but his ath
letic career was stopped short as
a nailed a hot grounder and sus
tained an injury to his hand that
kept him out of further competi
tion. His work around the keystone
sack over, he devoted his athletic
energies to the management of var
ious teams.
During Hoover's years on the
Farm there was a bitter political
war for control of the student gov
ernment between the "frats" and
the "barbs." Hoover was on the
side of the "barbs" and it was
largely through his efforts, and
those of young Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who entered school a year later
than he did and gbt the frosh vote,
that the "barbs" won out.
Student Government
During the summer of '93 he
worked for the U.S. Geographical
Survey. His friend, Dr. Branner,
was a great aid in getting him the
position. He spent the summer
thinking along the lines of student
government, and when he came
back to school for his junior year
he had a host of ideas to organize
the tangled campus activities and
government. He wrote the original
ASSU constitution which lasted un
til 1948. His constitution called for
an ASSU treasurer, and friends
urged him to take the position. He
declined because it provided for a
salary and he feared that people
might think that he created the post
for himself. He finally gave in to
those who wanted him as treasurer,
but stipulated that he should not
reccive a cent for his work.
The following summer he worked
again for the survey. During his
senior year at Stanford. Hoover met
Lou Henry, who later became his
wife. Lou was the only girl he ever
had, and when he was traveling he
was quite true to her.
Times were rough when Hoover
i graduated from Stanford. A diplo
ma helped not a whit when he
tramped the streets looking for a
job. However, Herbert Hoover was
made of sterner stuff. He wasn't
! afraid of a little, or a lot of, work.
He got a job at miner's wages in
the Mayflower pits, where he served
j his internship in mining. After a
while he went to mining big-shot
! Louis Janin to look for better fare.

A great part of the new genera- j

anything spoken of Herbert Clark '

conduct.
Until one or twu years ago, and j
since the election of Koosevelt, \
Hoover had been merely a myth. |
a myth that was factually false and |
humanly unjust. New Deal propa- <
ganda had it that Hoover "caused"
a depression and then "did nothing" j
to mitigate its horrors.
Prior to World War II his popu
larity seemed to be at its lowest ebb.
However, he contrived to lower it. j
At the time a wave of pro-USSR
feeling was sweeping the nation.

talitarian governmental methods of |
the • Soviets.
He suggested, rather, that energy !
be directed to alleviate the suffer- j
ing of the starving children of Nazi- i
held European countries. His pop- I
ularity continued downward.
Feeling of Guilt
Perhaps a feeling of guilt on the |
part of the great American public
has caused the tide to turn recently, i
In 1940 the Republican party con- j
sidered him poisonous to a cam- |
paign—in 1948 he shook the country I
with a speech he made at the Re- j
publican convention.
Where he was branded as "reac
tionary" in the thirties, in 1947 Dr. i
Alvin Johnson, ranking liberal. I
conceded that "among the men of
my time, Hoover has been the !
greatest."
Americans think of Hoover as [
austere f.nd cold — this is wrong. [
Austerity was not one of his char
acter traits. His most obvious quirk j
is shyness—almost physical shrink
ing from strangers, crowds, and
demonstrations.
Speaking informally with a friend !
he is at his best. His voice attains i
a certain richness, not the hearti- I
ness of a hail-fellow-well-met po- '
litico, and his phrases have an un
studied eloquence. He has a phe- j
nomenal memory for anecdotes and [
wit.
Shyness Is Crown

personality." A personality that is !
