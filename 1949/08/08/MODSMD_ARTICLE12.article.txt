# Birthday Greetings Pour Into Hoover Library Headquarters
## 
### 
A lot of people are wishing for- |
mer President Hoover well as his j
75th birthday approaches.
Tlie evidence is piling up in his j
offices in the Hoover Tower over- !
looking the grassy bowl where, on
his birthday Wednesday, he will
speak to the nation on the subject
"Think of the Next Generation."
The Stanford switchboards were
clogged with incoming calls from
people wanting tickets to the cele
bration. A few tickets were still
left for the 5:30 p.m. ceremony in j
Frost Amphitheater, but indica
tions were that provisions might I
have to be made for an overflow
crowd.
Letters — many of them with :
checks i'or the Hoover Library as
a birthday present for the nation's
31st President — poured into the:
library.
There were letters from gover- i
nors all over the nation and from !
friends all over the world.
And they found an official coun- !
terpart in the greetings coming to
"the Chief," as he is known to his I

intimates, from the U.S. Senate and '
House of Representatives. Both
branches of the legislature have
passed a resolution congratulating
Mr. Hoover and expressing "admi- I
! ration and gratitude" for his serv
ices to the nation and the world, j
Congratulatory mail poured in i
in such a stream that Mr. Hoover's
big mail box in the Stanford Post j
Office has had to be emptied many j
times a day by his hard-working i
secretarial staff.
His neighbors have not forgotten j
him either. Mayor Walter Caspar
of Palo Alto has declared Aug. 10 j
"Hoover Day." In a formal procla- !
I mat ion he called upon citizens of
j Palo Alto to display the national
colors next Wednesday "in honor j
iof our most distinguished citizcn." i
The proclamation pointed out :
j that Mr. Hoover "has come home
j lo observe this day in the commu
; nity he has known since his stu- |
> dent days at Stanford University."
"It is fitting, therefore, that Palo
j Alto should observe this anniver
sary as Hoover Day. We have loi\g
been proud of his achievements."
