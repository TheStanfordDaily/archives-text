# New Prize Novel On Revolt Tactics
## 
### 
Research on revolution done for
the Hoover Institute and Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace has
provided authentic background for
a first novel by Robert Carver
North. The book has just been pub
lished by Houghton Mifflin Co.
The novel by Mr. North, research
assistant at the Hoover Institute
and a graduate student in interna
tional relations at Stanford Univer
sity, is titled "Revolt in San Mar
cos" and deals with an imaginary
revolution in an imaginary Central
American country.
The 34-year-old author has spent
the last 18 months in research on
revolutions at the Hoover Institute.
He has specialized in Marxist-Len
inist revolutions in backward areas
and has used the hinese revolution
as a laboratory project.
"Revolt in San Marcos" is an at
tempt to bring to life the theory
that Communists have a different,
highly specialized approach to rev
lutions in backward areas. The
book portrays the dilemma of a
modern liberal in a backward coun
try.
The novel by Mr. North was writ
ten under the auspices of the Cre
ative Writing Center at Stanford
and won the 1948 Wallace Stegner
Prize for a novel.
