### 
With the keynote address pro
vided by Dr. Allen Nevins of Co
lumbia University, who declared
that "an understanding of our na
tional characteristics is the key to
American history," the eighth an
nual teachers' conference reached
its high-water mark Saturday night
at Cubberley Hall.
Speaking before a capacity au
dience, composed mainly of high
school and college history teachers,
Dr. Nevins made a vigorous ap
peal for the new approach to Amer
ican history.
''American history is not static,"
he declared. It is a throbbing, ever
growing history and a reilection of
the spirit of our times. Our civili
zation changes with each reborn
generation. The America of Bryce
was quite different from the Amer
ica of the 1930'5.
"The 'grand success story' ap
proach is misleading and tire the
ory of an 'expanding democracy' is
inadequate. A full and whole
hearted understanding of our na
tional characteristics and emotions
is the key to American history."
Dr. Nevins cited the two distin
guished authors and scholars, Fred
erick Jaokson Turner and the late
Charles E. Beard, as examples of
the new school of American history.
"However," Nevins said, "Turner
was attacked by the Marxians be
cause he neglected the theory of
class warfare in his writings on
the significance of the frontier in
American history.
"Beard and his theory of eco
nomic determinates in dealing with
the Constittuion was attacked be
cause he did not consider the agrar
ian movement."
After the address by Nevins a
panel discussion on "What Is Amer
ican History?" was conducted by
Professor Edgar E. Robinson of the
University's Institute of American
History. Other members of the
panel w.?re Professor John D. Hicks
of the University of California;
Harley Notter, author and U.S.
State Department official; J. G.
Randall, noted biographer of Lin
coln and history professor at the
University of Illinois; and Nicholas
Roosevelt, former vice-governor of
the Philippines.
After the round-table discussion
a question and answer period was
held, with Dr. Nevins taking the
brunt of the questions.
