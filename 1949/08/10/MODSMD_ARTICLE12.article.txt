## Stanford's First Citizen 
### 
Stanford's most prominent alumnus is celebrating his seventy
fifth birthday today.
Herbert Clark Hoover of the Pioneer Class of '95, the only
living ex-President of the United States, has returned to the scene
, of his undergraduate days.
While at Stanford, he initiated the idea of student government
which has become one of our most cherished traditions. Mr.
Hoover was one of three students who wrote the original ASSU
constitution which lasted until 1948.
One example of his selfless service to his fellows was his ac
ceptance of the position as first treasurer of the student body
for which he would not accept a- salary.
He has followed this principle of altruistic service throughout
his entire career as a humanitarian, statesman, and great leader.
His willingness to serve in the public interest and his adminis
trative abilities molded him into the stature of a world leader.
As President of the United States he was subjected to criticism
and misunderstanding. But he did the job he had to do regard
less of voter conseguences, and did not forsake his principles
for popularity. He retained his integrity throughout his term as
chief executive.
Now that all the hate and prejudice has abided, Mr. Hoover
is being recognized as one of the truly great men of history.
He spent the years from 1933 until 1945 making speeches and
writing books and magazine articles, all calling for a resurgence
of the spirit of justice.
It was during this time that the Hoover Library was begun and
developed. Through Hoover's inspiration the Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace is endeavoring to foster and improve
understanding.
Mr. Hoover stands as a giant among men. We are proud to call
him our first citizen.
