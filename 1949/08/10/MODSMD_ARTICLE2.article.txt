# Bard's Tragedy Opens At Mem Aud Tomorrow
## 
### CHUCK MILLER 
Second of the major productions given by the Stanford Players
during the summer season will be "Romeo and Juliet." It opens
tomorrow night in the Memorial Auditorium and will continue
through Saturday with a full house expected at each first-curtain.
Tickets, however, for all three performances can still be ob-

â–ºtained either at the Auditorium box j
office or by calling the Peninsula
Box Office at DA 2-2122.
F. Cowles Strickland of the
speech and drama department has
been working on the show for at
least six weeks, casting the major
roles at a time when "Now I Lay
Me" was still in its rough - hewn
stage.
He has had the good fortune this
season of being able to draw from
a full pool of fellowship students,
as well as to benefit by the crafts
manship of one of the older Broad
way set and costume designers, Lee J
Simonson.
After allowing Hume Cronyn of j
the "Now I Lay Me" production j
first option on the players he would
need for rehearsals, Mr. Strickland
set James Clancy into the role of
Romeo and offered Robin Hum
phrey the part of Juliet. George
Wilson, as the friar, and Marian
Stebbins, portraying the nurse,
round jut the little group of early i
starters. Miss Humphrey and John '
McLiam, who will be seen as the !
proud Mercutio, are both junior j
artists-in-residence for the sum- j
mer.
Two weeks ago Mr. Strickland
began to put the pieces together by
finishing his casting routine and i
assembling the scenes.
Meanwhile, Mr. Simonson and his
right-hand man, Harry Cummins, i
attending on a technical fellowship,
have be-jn pushing ahead with their 1
semi - permanent setting from the j
Italian Renaissance. The big job of
constructing the period costumes is
being done by Virginia Opsvig and
her students.
No more than the "ordinary"
amount of cutting will appear in !
the finished production. But Mr.!
Strickland states that he has tried \
to emphasize that " 'Romeo and
Juliet' is the story of two families
that were tragically reunited rather
than of two lovers who loved trag- I
ically."
