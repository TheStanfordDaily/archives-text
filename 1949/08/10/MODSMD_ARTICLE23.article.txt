# The 						Hoover Story in Pictures
## From Gold Miner To Humanitarian 
### FRED TEAGUE 
(This is the second of two ar- ,
tides on Mr. Hoover's life by j
Fred Teague.)
Shortly after his graduation from
Stanford, Herbert Hoover tired of s
working at miner's wages in the
Mayflower pits and went to mining
bigshot Louis Janin to look for bet- j
ter fare. He took a job as copyist, j
butr his efficiency soon earned him !
a promotion.
One of the positions he held with j
the company was at a rough min
ing camp as assisant manager. He
wore a six-shooter on his hip as he I
went about his duties. Hoover was !
then recalled to the office in San
Francisco, another promotion.
At the time there was a great
gold rush in progress in Australia I
and it commanded .the interest of I
the world. A London firm wired i
Janin that they needed a mining 1
engineer for their clients, ten Aus- J
tralian mining corporations. Hoo
ver was selected for the job.
While in Australia, the London !
office on Hoover's judgment risked
a half-million dollars on a project !
that rivals had considered a bad j
risk, By 1940 the mine had yielded
45 millions in gold.
It is generally conceded that in all
the history of the mining industries I
there have not been a dozen men of ;
Hoover's stature. There have been
greater experts in various phases of j
the industry, but these were the j
men he employed and directed on
around thirty or forty concurrent
enterprises all over the world.
When Hoover was but 40, his ca
reer as an engineer ended. Several
hundred thousand Americans were
stranded in war-torn Europe. Un
der Hoover and his associates, a
combination bank, shipping com
pany. diplomatic agency, and tourist
bureau was formed to aid these
Americans.
One and a half million dollars
changed hands through the agency's i
duration. Only S4OO was lost.
He left Europe in September of
1919, exhausted by five years of 18-
hour days as, in the words of Gen- j
eral Pershing, "Food Administrator
of the World." In commemoration
of his relief work in the low coun
tries. the Belgian government, in
conjunction with the Belgian uni
versities and the Educational
Foundation, saw fit to give him a j
carillon of 35 bells.
Hoover served for eight years as
Secretary of Commerce under Har
ding and Coolidge. He changed the
position from one of dubious essen
tiality to one that was required in
a modern government.
Every reader knows what 1929 ;

meant to the nation's, even the
world's, economy. Not many stop to
think that it was Hoover who first
planned from the White House
measures designed to mitigate the
problems of child welfare, labor re
lations, flood control, and home
ownership.
Since his term in the White
House Hoover has worked on var
ious committees.
Hoover's greatest achievement
since his term in the White House
has been his plan for reorganization
of the federal government.


FAITHFUL COMPANIONâ€”Hoover's wife, Lou llenry Hoover, added
strength and understanding to the life of the former chief executive.
