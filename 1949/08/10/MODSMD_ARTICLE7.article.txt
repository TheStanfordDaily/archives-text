# Campus Displays Hoover Exhibits

"Happy Birthday, Herbert Hoo
ver" highlights the Stanford cam
pus today, with special exhibits on
display at the Hoover Library and
the Bookstore, and welcoming signs
over the Stanford Union and En
cina.
Downstairs in the Hoover Library
presentations given to former
President Hoover by the Congress of
the United States, and the hono
rary ASSU membership awarded
him in a simple ceremony yester
day morning. This is the first time
that the joint houses of Congress
have unanimously voted a resolu
tion of birthday greetings to a pri
vate citizen of the United States.
An illuminated certificate signed
by the officers of ASSU cites Mr.
Hoover as an honorary, lifetime
member of that organization.
In the Bookstore window is a
display of several photographs of
Mr. Hoover, with some of the many
volumes which he has written. Es
pecially interesting is the transla
tion of the famous sixteenth cen
tury Latin mining text, "De Re Me
tallica" by Agricola, which he and
Mrs. Hoover translated together.
