Herbert Hoover, speaking from his alma mater and adoptee
home here at Stanford, told the nation Wednesday that "as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob posterity of its inheri
tance."
"We have not had a great socialization of property," said Star.-

ford's first citizen, "but we are c:
the last mile of collectivism
through governmental colleetio
and spending of the savings of th
people."
This grim warning for the futur
was delivered in Laurence Fro?
Amphitheater by the only livin
ex - President before an overflov
audience of 12.000. The topic o
Mr. Hoover's talk was "Think of th
Next Generation."

Ex-President Hoover returned :
Stanford to celebrate his 75th birth
day.
Belaboring confiscation of savinc ;
by the government through taxa
tion Mr. Hoover pointed out th;
not only the nation's standard o:
living would be lowered but th;r
it would also "expose our inde
pendent colleges and other private
ly supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the
state."
"Then," he continued, "through
politics we will undermine their in
dependence which gives stimulus to
government-supported institutions
"No nation grows strong by sub
traction.
Mr. Hoover in his birthday ad
dress ciccused "fuzzy-minded peo
ple" of fostering "the foolish notior
that a collectivist economy can at
the same time preserve persona'
liberty and constitutional govern
ment."'
Throughout his 18 - minute ad
dress, Mr. Hoover punctuated hii
remarks with the phrase: "Think it
over."
In concluding his appeal for re
duction in government costs, he
said:
"The American people have
solved many great crises in na
tional life. The qualities of self
restraint, of integrity, of conscience,
and courage still live in our people.
"It is not too late to summon
these qualities."
Fred Wickett, chairman of the
Hoover Birthday Fund, introduced
Mr. Hoover.
Dr. Sterling, president of the
University, opened the program
