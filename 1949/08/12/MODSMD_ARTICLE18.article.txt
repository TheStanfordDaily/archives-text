## Time and Tide American Report on China Declared To Be 'Tragedy' 
### 
AS IT WAS IN TIIE BEGINNING . . .
The American White Paper on China is a major climax in the Chinese
tragedy. The State Department finds Nationalist leaders, for the most part,
corrupt, undependable, and insincere; and the Communist leaders as liv
ing extensions of Kremlin world policy. The implication is that we can
deal with neither side in trying to stabilize world pcace and help the
Chinese people.
The bitter conclusion is that we call for a revolt by the Chinese people
to "throw off the foreign yoke" and that we will encourage any signs of
rebellion in this direction.
Such a conclusion is not a policy but admission of no policy whatever.
We simply don't know what to do, besides foster (by suggestion at least)
more years of social chaos in that miserable country.
A strong United Nations could conceivably resolve the civil war and
bring political stability by sheer imposition of the collective strength it
represents. The indelicate feelings among the big powers make such a
resolution impossible at present.
Since ignoring the China problem is manifestly impossible, there seems
to remain only one admittedly questionable course of action: to take as
much positive initiative in the reconstruction of China as we can, at the
same time always making sure that the Chinese people are informed as
to the source of their aid. If, over the next few years, we can build a sound
prestige and friendship with the Chinese people, then perhaps we can
counteract the blind conditioning which has been the late of many Com
munist-dominated peoples.
THE NEW ADAM. . .
A British bachelor recently attached the following rather imposing list
cf adjectives to American women: rude, vulgar, sex-conscious,- brash,
trazen, selfish, artificial, undisciplined, and unbelievably stupid. Since
our British cousin was here for three years, one concludes that he is not
merely generalizing a disappointing love affair.
Now I mention these somewhat cool sentiments, not for the sake of a
dead chivalry, but rather in mourning. One wonders how in the world
cur friend from across the seas missed meeting at least a few of the
tplendid women who sustain the Republic and assuage the lives of their
men.
Is it possible that our bachelor is rather vain and unselective himself?
But no, surely not. One is almost tempted to propose a new Bureau for
Interesting Foreign Men in American Women. On second thought, let's
leave them to the chorus girls.
