To the Editor:
Speeches and celebrations are continually marred by the active pres
ence of eager but thoughtless photographers. Herbert Hoover's recent
talk here was no exception.
The flashbulb artists were not content with spending five or ten min
utes before the address began in getting all of the shots they could possibly
use, but persisted in rushing about the rostrum during the talk clicking
their shutters. The entire audience was left with an up-in-the-air feeling
;:t the conclusion of the speech when the mob of photographers rushed
up and surrounded Hoover. This unregulated and thoughtless activity
shattered any attempts for a spontaneous birthday song or appropriate
concluding remarks.
The public relations department handled the broadcasting and pub
licizing of the speech to the general public quite well, but they apparently
missed the boat in handling the situation in Frost Amphitheater.
Why doesn't someone tone down these cameramen and give such cele
brations back to the audience?
JIM CAREY, JOHN JENKINS.
