# Shakespeare Play Opens Before Half-Filled House
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
For over three hundred years, Shakespeare has been plaguing
high school freshmen, confounding critics, and generally tick
ling the citizenry. For only shortly less than three hundred
years, he has been providing the vehicles for amateur theatrical
groups of every type, from Ladies' Aid societies to college drama

â™¦departments. Some of the results
I are good. Some not so good.
The Stanford Players' production
|of "Romeo and Juliet," which
opened its three-periorniance run
last night at Memorial Hall to a
half-filled auditorium, partakes of
both qualities.
The unhappy feud of the families,
j Capulet and Montague, was staged
j in two parts under the direction of
F. Cowles Strickland. This unusual
| adaptation of the traditionally five-
I act tr.aeedy led to a swift move
ment of action, aided as it was by
the single set designed by the New
York stage designer, Lee Simonson.
The set, which featured a high cen
ter Roman arch flanked by an Ital
ian Renaissance colonnade and a
series of three Gothic arches to rep
resent die church and the cell of
the Friar Lawrence, was unique in
its simplicity and starkness.
The role of Romeo, played by Jim
Clancy, gave the slight San Jose
! professor a chance to show his ver
satility. Though he occasionally
slipped into declamation, his char-
I acterization of the unhappy and
j volatile Italian was essentially sin
i cere and frequently excellent.
Juliet as played by Robin Hum
| pherys showed a steady develop
; ment from the child of 14 ot the pa
j thetic and tragic child wife. She
] failed somewhat to project her voice
j into the audience, and occasionally
seemed to leap into her speeches
with a suddenness, a quick rise and
j fall of voice, which tended to rob
I the part of its steady emotional de
velopment.
Particularly excellent were the
j nurse, played by Marian Stebbins,
i the elder Capulet. played by Lynn
j Gault. rnd Mercutio. played by
i John McLiani.
At .ill odds, Shakespeare, as
usual, is worth seeing.
