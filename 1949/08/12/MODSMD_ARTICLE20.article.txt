To the Editor:
The article on the Mundt-Ferguson bills in a recent issue of The Daily
shows how far along the road of reaction the United States has traveled.
Under the vague language of the bills and with the current "red" hysteria,
>nv organization advocating political, economic, or social reforms of a
liberal nature could legally be persecuted as "subversive."
The Mundt-Ferguson bills are part of the effect of the cold war on our
domestic policy. It is logical enough that the same sort of people who are
behind our policy of military aid to Fascist governments such as Greece,
of intervention in the political and economic affairs of foreign countries
through the Marshall Plan, and of forming a military alliance described
by the Wall Street Journal as "jungle law" and a step toward war, should
iJso wish to destroy civil liberties in this country. Practically all pro
gressive domestic programs are defeated or buried in Congress.
The reactionaries in government are trying to avert a depression
through military expenditures in the cold war, and are fearful that if a
depression comes, the people will wake up and demand reform through
the democratic processes of constitutional law. Thus we are faced with
bills whose purpose is to make such reforms illegal and "subversive,"
an a manner reminiscent of the early days of Nazi Germany. I urge every
person to write or wire immediately to Senator Pat McCarran, chairman
c.f the Senate Judiciary Committee, and to their own senators and repre
sentatives in protest against the bills. If we don't act now, we may be
t nable to do it later.
