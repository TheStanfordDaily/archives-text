# Life on Farm Bulletin Board Or, Wanna Buy Old Toupe?
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
We would like to pay tribute this
week to the greatest news agency
on the Stanford campus. Maybe
even the greatest and most unique
news agency in the whole state of
California. We do not mean The
Stanford Daily; nor do we mean
the Stanford OlTice of Information.
We mean, proudly, the public
bulletin boards situated on and
about the campus. Here are the
unsung heroes of the great farce of
life, the small stages upon which
are enacted the little daily dramas
of human existence.
Here ?.re, indeed (aside from the
superb sign at the History corner
announcing the "Ladies' Public Re
tiring Room"), the most fascinating
bits of Americanism since Barnum
bit the suckers.
To the uninitiated, they may look
like nothing but a mass of multi
colored slips announcing good
"cheap" cars for sale, a "real buy
in used zither strings," "a small,
well - varnished, almost new baby
for sale, reasonable." (Whatever be
longs in that space after baby, only
the harried student who whipped
it out will ever know. I'm sure
you wouldn't accuse a Stanford stu
dent of cannibalism.)

In one corner there will be a no
tice pleading for a ride to New !
York or Gander, Newfoundland, j
around Aug. 17, 1957 or 8. In the
other corner there will be a notice
"Urgent — need two passengers to
Gander, Newfoundland, or Passaic,
New Jersey, on or about Aug. 17,
1957 or 8." In the middle there will j
be a notice to "Joey—Come back. I ;
forgive you for your offensive atti
tude; you can spit on the floor any
time you want to."
And you readers of the boards,
you insensitive clods, will think
that's funny. Because you have a j
short memory. You can't remem- j
ber when you had to get to New- j
foundland or Passaic for a waiting |
funeral. You won't recall that zith
er strings for someone, some poor
little man with an unstrung zither,
are pretty big stuff. You'll never
bring back to mind the day when
you too had offensive manners. You
probably didn't stop at spitting on j
the floor. You probably threw rolls |
at the visiting minister, or dunked |
your napkin in the gravy.
To you who laugh thus at life, I J
say a fig on you.
By the way, anyone like to buy a I
flying saucer?

In one corner there will be a no
tice pleading for a ride to New !
York or Gander, Newfoundland, j
around Aug. 17, 1957 or 8. In the
other corner there will be a notice
"Urgent — need two passengers to
Gander, Newfoundland, or Passaic,
New Jersey, on or about Aug. 17,
1957 or 8." In the middle there will j
be a notice to "Joey—Come back. I ;
forgive you for your offensive atti
tude; you can spit on the floor any
time you want to."
And you readers of the boards,
you insensitive clods, will think
that's funny. Because you have a j
short memory. You can't remem- j
ber when you had to get to New- j
foundland or Passaic for a waiting |
funeral. You won't recall that zith
er strings for someone, some poor
little man with an unstrung zither,
are pretty big stuff. You'll never
bring back to mind the day when
you too had offensive manners. You
probably didn't stop at spitting on j
the floor. You probably threw rolls |
at the visiting minister, or dunked |
your napkin in the gravy.
To you who laugh thus at life, I J
say a fig on you.
By the way, anyone like to buy a I
flying saucer?

We would like to pay tribute this
week to the greatest news agency
on the Stanford campus. Maybe
even the greatest and most unique
news agency in the whole state of
California. We do not mean The
Stanford Daily; nor do we mean
the Stanford OlTice of Information.
We mean, proudly, the public
bulletin boards situated on and
about the campus. Here are the
unsung heroes of the great farce of
life, the small stages upon which
are enacted the little daily dramas
of human existence.
Here ?.re, indeed (aside from the
superb sign at the History corner
announcing the "Ladies' Public Re
tiring Room"), the most fascinating
bits of Americanism since Barnum
bit the suckers.
To the uninitiated, they may look
like nothing but a mass of multi
colored slips announcing good
"cheap" cars for sale, a "real buy
in used zither strings," "a small,
well - varnished, almost new baby
for sale, reasonable." (Whatever be
longs in that space after baby, only
the harried student who whipped
it out will ever know. I'm sure
you wouldn't accuse a Stanford stu
dent of cannibalism.)
