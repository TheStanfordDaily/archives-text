# Windmills, Wine-bags Slain In Cervantes Farce at Guild
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
If Francisco Franco, the fat
jowled ton of a fascist, gets his
meat hooks in the grab bag of the
Marshall Plan, no small amount of
credit will be due to the pleasing
taste left in the American mouth by
the Spanish screen production of
"Don Quixote de la Mancha," now
at the Guild.
Not that we wish to say anything
nice about Franco. Life Magazine
did a recent, homey little job of
that. But we would like to pay a
tribute to the picture.
The blurb calls Cervantes' novel
the world's greatest. And any num
ber of scholars have called Cer
vantes the world's greatest satirist,
all of which leaves little to say in
that line.
Knightly Adventure Story
The book is a collection of the ad
ventures of an ancient Spanish
"knight - errant" and his timid
squire, Sancho Panza, who are al
ways in search of the Ideal. Their
high purpose set in the low bawdry
of the Renaissance begets some lu
dicrous situations. The Don is so
hepped on knighthood that he takes
to imagining that windmills and
wine-bags are giants and herds of
sheep are armies. These he charges
valiantly and usually disastrously.
The humor, however, lies in the
Don's occasional lapses ino pene
trating good sense and in the sly
wisdom of Sancho.
The greatness lies perhaps in the
realization that it isn't Don Qui

xote who is crazy, but the hurrying, i
tormented, and always serious
world in which he lives.
Picture Judged 'Superb'
The picture, if you wish, is su
perb, terrific. But that doesn't point
out the fondness you will develop
for the Don and his squire, nor the !
magnificent wisdom of Cervantes, j
nor the sincere sadness of the cli- j
max.
That vou will have to see.
