"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is

entire world, as well, and which weigh

the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro

major source of credit and capital to

of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under

No nation grows stronger by subtrac

travagance and waste on to the next

debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our

that is a duty to our children.

working days in the year. Therefore,

meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.

It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these

this ride to a dead-end of our unique

Many of these groups maintain paid

Our representatives must run for

pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object

But beyond this the seriously pro

Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every

You might want to work for your

And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting

werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment

would add one-third more annually to

But beyond this the seriously pro

Taking out holidays, Sundays, and

corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.

There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would

So long as we must support (he neces

working days in the year. Therefore,

your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.
In Conclusion
And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not
be limited to legislative halls. We
should debate them in every school.
We should resort to the old cracker
barrel debate in every corner grocery.
There phrases and slogans can be dis
solved in common sense and integrity.
A splendid storehouse of integrity
and freedom has been bequeathed to us
by our forefathers. In this day of con
fusion, of peril to liberty, our high duty
is to see . hat this storehouse is not
robbed of its contents.
We dare not see the birthright of
posterity to individual independence,
initiative and freedom of choice bar
tered for a mess of a collectivist system.
My word to you, my fellow-citizens,
on this seventy-fifth birthday is this:
The Founding Fathers dedicated the
structure of our government "to secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity." Wo of this generation
inherited this precious blessing. Yet as
spendthrifts we are on our way to rob
posterity of its inheritance.
Tlie American people have solved
many great crises in national life. The
qualities of self-restraint, of integrity,
of conscience and courage still live in
our people. It is not too late to sum
mon these qualities.
"To my friends of Stanford Univer
sity and the tens of thousands of 'per
sons who have sent messages and let
ters, I want to make acknowledgment.
"It would be a pleasure for me to
discuss the gains being made by the
two and a half million young men and
women who are being trained in our
institutions of higher learning and the
part of this grea< institution in this
training.
"But in the somber situation of th
world I would be derelict if today 1
discussed anything but the serious is
sues which affect us nationally and the
entire world, as well, and which weigh
on my heart.
Some of you will know that during
the past two years I have added some
what to my previous knowledge of the
currents of government in this Repub
lic. Beyond the immediate problems of
efficient organization of the Federal
Departments, there arise from these
investigations some grave questions as
to our whole future as a nation.
Now, as never before, we need think
ing on some of these questions. If
America is to be run by the people,
it is the people who must think. And
we do not need to put on sackcloth and
ashes to, think. Nor should our minds
work like a sundial which records only
sunshine. Our thinking must square
against some lessons of history, some
principles of government and morals,
if we would preserve the rights and
dignity of men to which this nation is
dedicated.
The real test of our thinking is not so
much the next election as it is the next
generation.
I am not going to offer you solutions
to our national ills. But I shall list some
items for thought. Perhaps in Japanese-
English a subhead would be "Bring
feet from clouds into swamp where we
now are."
The Growth of Spending
We must wish to maintain a dynamic
■progressive people. No nation can re
main static and survive. But dynamic
progress is not made with dynamite.
And that dynamite today is the geo
metrical increase of spending by our
governments—Federal, state and local.
Perhaps I can visualize what this
growth has been. Twenty years ago,
*»11 varieties of government, omitting
Federal debt service, cost the average
family less than $200 annually. Today,
klso omitting debt service, it costs an
werage family about $1300 annually.
This is bad enough. But beyond this
is the alarming fact that at this moment
executives and legislatures are seriously
proposing projects which if enacted
would add one-third more annually to
our spending. Add to these the debt
service and the average family may be
paying $1,900 yearly taxes. They may
get a little back if they live to over 05
years of age.
The Growth of Bureaucracy
No doubt life was simpler about 147
years ago, when our government got
well under way. At that time there
was less than one government em
ployee, Federal, state and local includ
ing the paid military, to each 120 of
the population. Twenty years ago, there
was one government employee to about
40 of the population. Today, there
is one government employee lo about
every 22 of the population. Worse than
this, there is today one government em
ployee to about 8 of the working popu
lation.
The Growth of Dependency
Twenty years ago, persons directly or
indirectly receiving regular monies
"rom the government—that is, officials,
soldiers, sailors, pensioners, subsidized
persons and employees of contractors
working exclusively for the Govern
ment -represented about one person in
every 40 of the population.
Today about one person out of every
7 in the population is a regular recipi
ent of government monies. , If those of
..ce are all married, they comprise about
one-half the voters of the last Presiden
tial election.
I would like for you to think that
over.
Working for the Government
In the long run it is the Average
Working Citizen who pays by hidden
i.nd other taxes. I have made up a

little table showing the number of
days which this kind of citizen must
work on average to pay the taxes.
Days' work
Obl» from former wars.. .11
I Cold War ...24
utner tetier'al expenditures 12
State and local expenditures.... 14
Total thus far til
But beyond this the seriously pro
posed further spending now in process
will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every
month.
You might want to work for your
family instead of paying for a gigantic
bureaucracy.
I hope you think about that also.
Confiscation of Savings
To examine what we are doing, we
must get away from such sunshine
figures as the gross national income.
We must reduce our problem to the
possible savings of the people after a
desirable standard of living. If we
adopt the Federal Government's esti
mate of such a desirable standard, then
the actual, and the seriously proposed,
national and local governmental spend
ing will absorb between 75% to 85%
of all the savings of the people. In
practice it does not work evenly. The
few will have some savings, but the
many must reduce their standard of
living to pay the tax collector.
And it is out of savings that the
people must provide their individual
and family security. From savings they
must' buy their homes, their farms and
their insurance. It is from their savings
finding their way into investment that
we sustain and stimulate progress in
our productive system.
One end result of the actual and pro
posed spendings and taxes to meet them
is that the Government becomes the
major source of credit and capital to
the economic system. At best the small
business man is starved in the capital
he can find. Venture capital to develop
new ideas tends to become confined to
the large corporations and they grow
bigger. Governments do not develop
gadgets of improved living.
Another end result is to expose all
our independent colleges and other pri
vately supported institutions to the risk
of becoming dependent upon the state.
Then through politics we will under
mine their independence which gives
stimulus to government supported insti
tutions.
No nation grows stronger by subtrac
tion.
Think it over.
Government Borrowing
It is proposed that we can avoid these
disasters by more government borrow
ing. That is a device to load our ex
travagance and waste on to the next
generation. But increasing government
debts can carry immediate punishment
for that is the road to inflation. There
is far more courage in reducing our
debts than in increasing them. And
that is a duty to our children.
Increasing Taxes
And there is no room for this spend
ing and taxes except to cut the stand
ard of living of most of our people. 11
is easy to say increase corporation
taxes. That is an illusion. The bulk of
corporation taxes is passed on to the
consumer—that, is to every family. It is
easy to say increase taxes on the higher
personal income brackets. Bui if all in
comes over $5000 a year were confis
cated, it would cover less than 10% of
these actual and proposed spendings.
The main road is to reduce spending
and waste and defer some desirable
things for a while.
We Cannot Have Everything at Once
There are many absolute necessities
and there ire many less urgent meri
torious and desirable things that every
individual family in the nation would
like to have but cannot afford. To spend
for them or borrow money for I hem
would endanger the family home and
the family life. So it is with the na
tional family.
So long as we must support (he neces

sary national defense and cold war at a
cost of 24 days work per year to Mr.
Average W. Citizen there are malty
comforting things that should be de
ferred if we do not wish to go down
this road to ruin of our national fam
ily life.
It merits thought from you.
The Back ltoad to Collectivism
We have a few hundred thousand
Communists and their fellow travelers
in this country. They cannot destroy
the Republic. They are a nuisance and
require attention. We also have the doc
trinaire socialists who peacefully dream
of their Utopia.
But there is a considerable group of
fuzzy-minded people who are engineer
ing a compromise with all these Euro
pean infections. They fail to realize that
our American System has grown away
from the systems of Europe for 250
years. They have the foolish notion that
a collectivist economy can at the same
time preserve personal liberty and con
stitutional government.
The steady lowering of the standard
of living by this compromised collectivist
system under the title "austerity" in
England should be a sufficient spectacle.
It aims at a fuller life but it ends in a
ration.
Most Americans do not believe in
these compromises with collectivism.
But they do not realize that through
governmental spending and taxes, our
nation is blissfully driving down the
back road to it at top speed.
In the end these solutions of national
problems by spending are always the
same—power, more power, more cen
tralization in the hands of the state.
Along this road of spending, the
Government either takes over, which
is socialism, or dictates institutional and
economic life which is fascism.
We have not had a great socialization
of property, but we are on the last mile
to collectivism through governmental
collection and spending of the savings
of the people.
You must give it thought.
Fooling lite People's Thinking
A device of these advocates of gigan
tic spending is the manipulation of
words, phrases and slogans to convey
new meanings different from those we
have long understood. These malign
distortions drug thinking. They drown
it in emotion. We sec government bor
rowing and spending transferred into
the soft phrase "deficit spending!" The
slogan of a "welfare state" has emerged
as a disguise for the totalitarian state
by the route of spending. Thomas Jef
ferson would not recognize this distor
tion of his simple word "welfare" in
the Constitution. Jefferson's idea of the
meaning of welfare lies in his state
ment "To preserve our independence
. . . we must make a choice between
economy and liberty or profusion and
servitude. ... If we can prevent gov
ernment from wresting the labors of
the people under the pretence of caring
for them we shall be happy."
Another of these distortions is by
those who support such a state and call
themselves "liberals." John Morley
would not recognize them.

Out of these slogans and phrases and
new meanings ol words come vague
promises and misty mirages, such as
"security from the cradle to the grave,"
which frustrate those basic human im
pulses to production which make u
dynamic nation.
Think it over.
Where Blame Must Be Placed
It is customary to blame the Ad
ministrations or t!ie legislatures for this
gigantic increase in spending, these
levies on the nation's work-days, and
this ride to a dead-end of our unique
and successful American system. A large
cause of this growing confiscation of the
work of the people by our various Gov
ernments is the multitude of gre&t pres
sure groups among our citizens. Also
the state and municipal governments
pressurize the Federal Government.
And within the Federal Government
are pressure groups building their own
empires.
Aggression of groups and agencies
against the people as a whole is not a
process of free men. Special privilege
either to business or groups is not
liberty.
Many of these groups maintain paid
lobbies in Washington or in the State
Capitols to press their claims upon the
Administrations or the legislatures.
Our representatives must run for
election. They can be defeated by these
pressure groups. Our officials are
forced to think in terms of pressure
groups, not in terms of need of the
whole people.
Perhaps some of my listeners object
to somebody else's pressure group. Per
haps you support one of your own. Per
haps some of you do not protest that
your leaders arc not acting with your
authority.
Think it over.

And finally, may I say that thinking
and debate on these questions must not

But beyond this the seriously pro

will take another 20 days work from Mr.
and Mrs. Average W. Citizen.
Taking out holidays, Sundays, and
average vacations, there are about 235
working days in the year. Therefore,
this total of 81 days work a year for
taxes is about one week out of every

You might want to work for your
