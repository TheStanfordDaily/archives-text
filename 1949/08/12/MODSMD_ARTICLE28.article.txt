# LET'S LOOk AT THE MAJORS
## The 						NL Battle Waxes Hot 
### MORTY NOVICK 
The baseball weeds are growing ,
wild in '.he national pastime's gar- :
den again this season.
In the sedate old National League j
the Dodgers and Cardinals, like two
neighborhood bullies who have
token the only ball and bat on the
block and refuse to let the other
boys play, continue to grapple each
other in the dirt as they have done
during the past decade.
Both >112 'em are hanging by their
eyelids — fighting tenaciously for
first plar:e. It is even dangerous to
wink.
Back in early spring at Brook- '
lyn's colossal baseball plant at Vero i
Beach, Fla., the Dodgers were a 5 :
to S choice in the book. The experts j
conceded them the speed, reserve ]
strength, and pitching material.
"If Duke Snider can hit around ;
the ,280's by July 1," Mickey Mc- '
Connel, head of Dodger promotion, j
told this writer as he took off '
his rose-colored glasses last May.
"Brooklyn should win by ten
games.'
Snider, a rawboned guy with a
pencil-like physique, is a rare, un
cut gem from Mr. Rickey's batting
process — a weird-looking contrap
tion called a "bazooka" which au
tomatically shoots balls to different
spots in the batting zone.
The Duke has produced. Effec
tively and devastatingly so. He has
hit more home runs than any Dodg
er since the golden days of Dolph
Camili, whose rival pitchers used
to say 'he right field wall at Ebbets
Field would move in 20 feet every
time he advanced to the plate.
While the Dodgers were getting

i in shape at Vero Beach the Cardi-
I nal training site at St. Petersburg,
i Fla., was like Goldsmith's "Deserted
j Village." Eddie Dyer would sit for
hours in the cool of his veranda and
speak with a sort of near-sighted j
reverence about his "six expend
ables."
The thin, red line of old pros . . .
Musial, Slaughter, Marion, Bree
| chen, Schoendienst, and Pullet . . .
who, he said, would hold the Red
birds together for better or for
worse.
Starting slowly and for a while
' floundering around in the league
} cellar, the Cards began to move up
| about mid-July.
Since then, their ascent up the .
j ladder has been phenomenal. [
| Southpaw Howie Pollet, who had
j n't been winning since 1946, came !
I out of his deep pitching slumber j
j and began hurling victories for the j
I Red birds.
Pollet exemplifies the Cardinal j
j surge. Perhaps it's that one, last
! fling . . . one more herculean effort
J of trying to exceed your grasp . . .
i before the swan song.
But, they've been writing "the
; end of the Cardinal era" since
j Enos Slaughter made that dramatic,
j heart-throbbing run for home in
the last game of the 194(5 World's
Series.
The Cardinals have those "six ex
| pendables" and they have that re
juvenated pitching. The Dodgers
! have the speed and youth and re
| serves.
It'll be no mean trick to knock
the Bums down. However, it'll be
; i hard to keep 'em there.
