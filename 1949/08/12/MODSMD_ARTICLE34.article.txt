# 'Whole PCC Will Be Stronger This Year,' Says Bengtson As He Reviews 1949 Stanford Line Prospects
## 
### 
Head Line Coach Phil Bengtson j
said yesterday that the Stanford |
football team will be much stronger j
this year than it was last.
But, at the same time, he cau
tioned that everyone else will be j
stronger too.
"Oregon will be a definite con- j
tender," Bengtson said. This team
is in addition to the predicted strong
teams of Cal and USC. And. Bengt
son .said that the Washington game 1
can't be predicted as anything bet
ter than a tossup.
It's hard to teil exactly how the
team will look on Aug. 29. when
some 02 players have been invited
to come to Stanford's first fall prac
tice, Bengtson said.
"Ot course, our line will be lisht
c than either Cal's or USC's."
B. ngtson said. "But we have al
ways iiad our best line play against
those two schools."
Phil Bengtson said he didn't j
know about UCLA. "They are an
unknown quantity. They will J
probably have more fire than they
have had recently, and Coach 'Red'
Sanders has been promising a sur
p: ise," Bengtson said.
Bengtson feels that the Pacific j
Coast teams will do a lot better
against their inter sectional oppo
nents than they have since the war. |
Stanford's line coach doesn't hold;
out too much hope of beating !
mighty Michigan, but Harvard may j
be a different story. Although the
Crimson played a better game,
against Army last year than we did. I

it was one of Harvard's best games. |
Bengtson said.
At the tackle spot, both of last j
year's lettermen will return. Both t
Gordon White and A 1 Rau played j
outstanding games last year. White ;
was judged by some to be the best
tackle on the field during last year's
Big Game. A 1 Rau. who weighs
only 200 pounds, is quick and in
tel'igent at his position.
White will be backed r.p by Lee j
Daly from last year's frosh. Hal ;
Walker will come up from the JV's. ,
and Don Lucas is returning from l
last year's varsity. Lucas was out I
a good part cf last season with an :
injury.
Rau wi'ii be backed up by Wes
Poulson, who is returning from last i
year's varsity, and Bruce? Mikesell.
who is up from the frosh.
At tackle. Don Fix is 'the return
ing letterman from last year. Tix
payed most oi the time last year.
He will fight for his p. ;ition with I
Hart Cook. Charley Hokanson, Russ
Pomerov. and Joe Jacob. Cook, j
who weighs only 184 pounds, will [
probably be used quite a bit.
Jack McKittrick. last year's left j
guard, has been lost by graduation. '
His post will be filled by Tom Au- j
gust, who was shifted over from end
last year, Jesse Cone, who is up
from the frosh. Mike Pelsinger of
last year's varsity, and Dick Lucas,
who is out for ball for the first
time.
There are four lettermen'return
ing to center spot. They are Jim
CastagnoL:, Dick Abraham, Jack

Barnes, and John Rosekrans. Other
centers will be Gordon Rice, a
transfer from Santa Clara, and
Doug Thamer, who is up from the
frosh.
