# Well-Wishers Greet Hoover
## 
### 
America's only living ex-president
came home yesterday to face a re
ception by well-wishers and friends
as befitted the University's
First Student.
The Hoover family was there too,
with all the grandchildren in the
first row. Ihe feeling was a "family"
one—extending to all 12,000 persons
there.
As Hoover walked in clad in a
brown business suit with hat in
hand, the carillon was playing
"Hail to the Chief," but an elderly
voice started "Happy Birthday" and
the rest of the crowd took it up.
Mr. Hoover did not appear to be
listening as honors were heaped up
on him—maybe he felt, as he has
said, that he has already received
all the worldly honors he desired.
But he did look up to laugh when
Dr. Wallace Sterling told how
Eneinaites hung out a banner an
nouncing: "Hoover slept here."
Tlie whole affair had the friendly

characterful 16 6f an lowa state pic
nic, but ■'Hoover showed that he had
more, than aJ-Mirtfoday celebration in
mind as he delivered his address.
"Think of the Next peneration." in
which 'he denounced the present
government spending as the "last
mile to collectivism."
When it was all over, the strains
of "Happy Birthday" again drowned
out the Stanford Hymn on the
carillon, and Hoover's birthday
oartv was over.
