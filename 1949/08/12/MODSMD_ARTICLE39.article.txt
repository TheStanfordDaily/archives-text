# Hoover Day Traffic Handled with Ease
## 
### 
The 12,000 persons who attended
Frost Amphitheater Wednesday af
ternoon for the Hoover birthday
celebration rate a "perfect" in traf
fic behavior, for no accidents were
reported to the Stanford police.
The Stanford police had seven of
their own officers on traffic work
and were assisted by 20 student po
lice. The estimated 4,000 cars at
the event came and went from the
Amphitheater without mishap, in
spite of the street repairs in prog
ress all over campus.
Also absent from the affair were
the usual cases of people fainting,
sprained ankles, and lost children.
All of the cars moved out quickly
afterward so that by 6 p.m. no more
intersection control was needed.
