# Lusty Love Movie Tells 'Simple Tale'
## 
### 
The eye - popping title of Sun
day's Mem Aud movie is "Wedding
Night," announced Sunday Series
director Howie Miller yesterday.
"Quelle sport," murmured Mil
ler, as he disclosed that it is a "sim
ple tale" about a young novelist
who finds his talent slipping and
then returns home to "refresh him
self."
There he falls in love with a
farmer's daughter, no less, who is
engaged to another man. The nov
elist's wife soon returns, and the
voung girl marries the other man.
To unravel the rest of this lusty
dilemma, said Miller, one must pay
the usual 20 - cent tariff Sunday
evening.
