vice-president Lois Croonquist. and
Marianna Olmstead, chairman of
summer activities.
The reception was held from 8
p.m. to 10 p.m. in the Court lighted
by Japanese lanterns.
The Sterlings greeted students,
faculty, emeriti, and administrative
officers under a full August moon.
Soft music came over the loud
speakers as guests talked and drank
punch.
This is the first time the Court has
been used for an all-campus social
affair since the Junior Proms wore
held there years ago.
