## Dead Horses 
### 
We don't believe in breathing life into dead horses, but we
find it rather difficult to breathe life into a dead student â€”
especially one who has been killed by a speeding bicycle or
motorcycle on Inner Quad.
No riding bicycles and motor scooters in Inner Quad is not
only a tradition, but common sense as well.
We believe this should include Lasuen street between the
Quad and the Library.
It is often unsafe for a pedestrian to walk across Inner Quad,
or down the street in front of the Library and Education Building.
Life is cheap among whizzing two-wheeled vehicles around here.
We have several solutions.
First, we may stop riding bicycles where large groups of
people are.
Second, we may compensate for injuries and deaths by in
creasing the student population. This can be done either by de
creasing the tuition, or easing the entrance requirements.
It is an understandable thrill to weave in and out among the
walking portion of the student body. It is probably even more
of a thrill to send a student running up a tree in one of the islands
of Inner Quad, dropping his books on the way.
Of course, it is possible to build safety zones and traffic signals
at convenient locations about the danger area. These might be
cf use only to people who are not track stars, or who can dig
a foxhole in asphalt in record time.
This may be a small thing, it is true. But we cannot allow this
indifference to tradition to gain sanction. It will become im
possible to draw the line. The Stanford student of 1960 will be
dropping down to his class on the Math Corner in a helicopter.
We understand that a whirling helicopter rotor might neatly
mow down five or six students at a time. This would make
bicycles and motorcycles look sick.
