# THE
						AL RACE
## Yankees Slang On Top Rung 
### MORTY NOVICK 
When Orsino, Duke of Illyria,
first gandered Viola and Sebastian
together he exclaimed: "One face,
one voice, one habit, and two per
sons. A natural perspective that is
and is not."
Now the Bard from Avon didn't
know a single from a home run
but he surely, and in every sense
of the word, summed up the cur
rent National - American League
pennant race four centuries ago in
that scene from "Twelfth Night."
As the impetuous child of history
will note, the pennant fever in the
junior circuit usually subsides
about mid-July. However, in the
National League, as the pace quick
ens and the pennant chase becomes
more intense, children leave and
only the stouter hearts prevail.
AL Race Close, Too
For the past few seasons the
American League has kept up with
the fervor of the old league. This
year the circuit's pennant race is
closer than a college boy's haircut,
although the statistics do not bear
this out.
As this is being written the Yan- i
kees are four games ahead of the |
Boston Redsox and five in front j
of Cleveland. Continually plagued
by injuries to key players, Casey :
Stengel's 1949 "Cinderella Boys"
are ready to be hurdled from the j
top rung .in the ladder.
The Redsox, possessing the most
devastating batting order since the
millennium of Murderous Row, may
lack consistent pitching, but their
big bats are now beginning to
bludgeon rival pitchers into obliv
ion. They ARE the team to beat.
No? Ask Casey Stengel.
Cleveland Was Split
Early-season dissension split the
world champion Cleveland Indians
wider apart than a pair of store
teeth. It wasn't until late July that
they began moving up into the first
division. Of course, the ball club
played over its head in 1948. Re
member that play - off game last
year when they came into the lair
oi the Redsox and played like nine
Dick Merriwells? And remember
the exhibition of Lou Boudreau,
hitting two home runs and stealing
the show away from Williams and
Stephens, Pesky and Doerr?
Eoudreau, the superb shortstop
that he is. played an impossible
brand >1 ball while guiding Cleve
land to its fi ist pennant since 1920.
Whenever a key hit was needed Lou
was there. Whenever a winning base
lit seemed destined for the outfield
he was there, shuffling over in that
familiar crab-like fashion, making
those plays look as easy as if he
were playing in a rocking chair.
Can't Count Tribe Out
Nevertheless, the Indians can't be
•ounted out. Last year they played
H.\st when the going got rough and
he clouds were their darkest.
But it seems to be Yankees and
Redsox. The New Yorkers may not

New York and Boston. It figures
to by the biggest battle since Bunker
Hill. This time, however, the Yanks
better not wait to sec the whites
of their eves.
