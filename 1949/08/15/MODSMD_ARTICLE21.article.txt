# Farm Players' 'Bomeo' Scored High for Acting
## 
### CHUCK MILLER 
After the final curtain call of Saturday night's performance of
"Romeo and Juliet," the stage was struck in record time and the
main body of the cast sallied down to Longbarn's to talk over the
show across the cups. However varied may have been audience
opinion, the Stanford Players had added another tick to the
measuring roc! for future oroduc- *

tions.
Some members of the cast will be
scon again locally and will doubt
less conlinue to turn out as com
mendable a job of acting as they
did on Saturday night, when "they
.vere no longer playing on their
nerves.' Among these are George
Wilson, who played the staunch and
sympathetic friar, and Marian
-Stebbins, who showed us the tender
character of Juliet's nurse. James
Clancy brought to life a youthful
but far more mature Romeo than
even the friar had guessed.
Those two members of the cast
who are here on acting fellowships
will be remembered in the quar
ters to come for their subtle and
interesting, their talented interpre
tations of Juliet and Mercutio.
.Robin Humphrey and John are with
us only for this summer, but their
efforts carried far in making "Ro
meo" the over-all enjoyable play
that it was.
No less, however, can be said of
the remaining members of Mr.
Strickland's cast. After working for
over a month, they gave a three
night run that had its wrinkles, yes,
but that could be compared favor
ably with any Shakespeare here in
the past.
If any two qualities distinguished
the play in its entirety, they were
simplicity and economy, and for
all who had a part in "Romeo"
are to be congratulated.
The Players were fortunate in
having Lee Simonson of the New
York Theater Guild design the set
tings and costumes. For his work
on the snow as a senior Artist-in-
Residence, and for his gift of paint
ings and drawings, representing 30
years of experience, he rates a final
curtain coll of his own.
