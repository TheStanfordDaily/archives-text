### 
A talk on autobiographies of
three men concerned with Latin
j American relations will be given by
! Prof. Arthur P. Whitaker Wednes
day at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Hall.
The lecture, last in a series of
addresses by Professor Whitaker
under Ihe sponsorship of the His
panic Institute, will be open to the
public without charge.
Professor Whitaker, member of
the faculty at the University of
Pennsylvania and visiting professor
of history at Stanford during the
summer quarter, will discuss these
| three autobiographies:
i "Creole Ulysses" by the Mexican
J author Jose Vasconcelos, "The Me
moirs of Cordell Hull" by the for
j mer Secretary of tSate, and "On
I Active Service in Peace and War"
j by former Secretary of War Henry
L. Stimson and McGeorge Bundy.
Professor Whitaker will develop
the premise that these autobiogra
phies show that the history of in
ternational relations is a branch of
! social and cultural history, and that
| conversely, social and cultural his
! Tory is incomplete without inter
! national relations.
