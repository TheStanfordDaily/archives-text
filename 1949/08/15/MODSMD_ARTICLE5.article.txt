# Opera Scenes Here Friday
## 
### 
Friday night in the Memorial
, Auditorium, the Stanford Op
era Workshop, under the direc
torship of Professor Jan Pop
per, will present a program of
excerpts from five operas.
The program, which marks the
j first public performance of the
Workshop during the summer term,
t will include selections from two
new American operas: "A Tree on
the Plains" by Ernst Bacon, and
"The Prodigal Son" by Frederick
Jacobi.
Professor Bacon, who is compos
er-in-residence at Syracuse Uni
versity and former dean of the mu
sic department at Converse College
in South Carolina, is currently
teaching classes in musicology and
chamber music at Stanford. His op
era was commissioned before the
war by the League of Composers,
and was given its premiere at Spar
tanburg, S.C., in the spring of 1942.
According to Professor Bacon, the
opera is set in the American South
west. It is the story of a drought,
the prayers of the country folk for
rain, and their feelings when the
rain finally comes. Within it are the
j internal conflicts of love and the
I primitive fear of the farmers and
! ranchers of losing their land.
Will Be Second Performance
The Stanford production will be
! the opera's second performance. It
| will be presented under the stage
I direction of Joel Carter and the
| supervision of Professor Bacon, who
j will also conduct the work.
Professor Jacobi is a member of
i the faculty of the Juillard School
! of Music in New York City. "The
j Prodigal Son" was composed .in
j 1944, then performed in 1946 as an
' orchestral suite by the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1945 the
! work received the David Bispham
Memorial Award after an excerpt
performance by the National Opera
Association in Chicago.
The opera has its setting in a
I large American city of the early
I nineteenth century.
Mozart Included

Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," a scene
