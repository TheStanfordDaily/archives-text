SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 15 j
(UP). — John Marin, '50, drove a
speedboat into high school student
James Keating, 16, as he was swim
ming in Lake Arrowhead tonight.
Keating was severely slashed by
the speedboat's propellox-s.

The victim was reported fighting
for his life as doctors appealed for a
rare type of blood with which to
give him transfusions.
The youth, son of Los Angeles
newspaper reporter Jack W. Keat
ing, suffered a broken pelvis, frac
tures of the right arm at wrist and
elbow, cuts, and shock yesterday
when the boat operated by Marin
struck him.
The victim, a resident of North
Hollywood, has type 2A —Rh blood,
and supplies at the San Bernardino
hospital were soon exhausted. Al
though more blood was flown here
from the Los Angeles Red Cross
blood bank, the store was reported
dwindling, and persons with this
type were urged to make donations
at the bank.
Sharon Mulcahy. 17, daughter of
movie publicist Jack Mulcahy, dived
from the craft and pulled him from
the water. Keating tried to escape
the boat by diving under water, and
Marin and Miss Mulcahy at first
were unaware he had been hit.
