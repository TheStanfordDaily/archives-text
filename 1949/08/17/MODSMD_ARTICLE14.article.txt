To the Editor:
The Hoover celebration on Wednesday has raised a problem which
we feel demands an answer.
University authorities deny campus platforms to "political speakers
unless "both" sides are represented. Such a rule tends to emasculate
liberal education, by excluding speakers it excludes consideration ot
current problems from campus life. We feel also that it is based upon
tw<> false assumptions that political speakers can be readily distinguished
from non-political, and that there are two and no more than two sides
to every political question.
But let ns grant the advisability of the University rule. How can the
authorities justify their allowing Mr. Hoover a campus platform? The
political significance of his speech was, we thought, immediately apparent,
lie described his opponents variously; they are Communists, fellow trav
elers, doctrinaire socialists, and dupes of the doctrine of the "welfare
stale." This makes four other sides recognized by Mr. Hoover. We regret
that he overlooked us, a well-knit, non-Marxist, and strongly anti-dupe
splinter group. Mr. Hoover, himself, favors a free discussion of the
issues which he discussed. Why did the formulators of the rule not insist
upon a second speaker opposing Mr. Hoover and representing at least one
of these other sides?
We are opposed to the rule. The action of the University authorities
on Wednesday violated it. Does their action substantiate our suspicion
that the ride is to be used arbitrarily in order to exclude speakers whom
the authorities deem undesirable?

(The University rule, as set down in the Founding Grant, letters of
Mrs. Stanford, and subsequent interpretation by the Board of Trustees,
states that University grounds will not be used for partisan political
purposes. Because Mr. Hoover is a distinguished alumnus, and because
he has been connected for so long with non-partisan affairs, the admin
istration felt it was an honor to have him speak here.—Ed.)
