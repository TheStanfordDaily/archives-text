To the Editor:
Ted Cloonan's comment on the "Chinese Tragedy" is an example of
the American tragedy. It would appear that Cloonan has been blindly
conditioned (to use his vocabulary) by the ideological conceit of "American
Century" advocates. Would Cloonan care to write of the blind condition
ing of many, especially American, capitalist-dominated peoples?
It is a tragedy that Chinese people have been slaughtered by American
weapons; it is poetic justice when the Chinese forcibly reject the "aid"
of Generals Hurley, Wedemeyer, Marshall, and company.
The delirium of Time, Life, Look, and Hearst in connection with the
Chinese revolution is understandable; the despondency of liberals is less
understandable. When our militarists establish a vast network of bases,
flourish the atomic bomb, become paymasters of ex-Nazis, and attempt to
suppress liberation movements in colonial and semieolonial lands the
American people must expect resistance from courageous, realistic people
such as the Chinese.
The desire to dominate was a characteristic of the capitalists of England,
France, Germany, and Japan. The tragedy today is that American capi
talists are attempting the same in the name of the American people. The
comedy of today is to see the Chinese administer a "kick in the pants"
of the imperialists.
