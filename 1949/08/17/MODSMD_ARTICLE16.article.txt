To the Editor:
Those who saw last week's "Romeo and Juliet" surely cannot agree
with the criticism in last Friday's Daily. Nosegays were entirely out of
order for "the play in its entirety." Simonson's efforts and those of John
McLiam and Marian Stebbins made the show.
It trudged like an army through the valley of the shadow of death,
failing miserably to create what Shakespeare must have intended -to show,
not the tragedy, but the slightly whimsical sadness of youth thwarted in
love. Robin Humphrey, an imported creation, had the air of an animated
store manikin, waxen and too artificial to convince us that she was truly
in love with an aging Romeo. Is it possible that some of our local talent
might not have done a more effective job?
And the friar Played with the profundity of Baron Thunder-ten
tronckh, he was completely devoid of the human qualities found in the
jolly and somewhat sinful friars of Chaucer, Balzac, and Boccaccio. He
was more in the part when he rushed from the grave scene than at any
other time in the play.
You compare "Romeo" with "any Shakespeare here in the past." Have
you forgotten "The Taming of the Shrew," "Richard III." and the "Mac
beth" of last year? They were performances that stirred audiences, what
ever the mood. "Romeo" had only the effect of moving them to wonder
it their $1.20 might not have been better spent at Finoccio's.
What were the reasons for this fiascoâ€”"in its entirety"? The directing
is one; but then Mr. Strickland has produced better shows. The "star
system at Stanford? Perhaps. Whatever may have been the various
causes, many ol us hope that in the future the work of the Players will
measure up to and surpass the "bests" of the past, and that the criticism
of r lhe Daily will be honestly severe, even if the reviewer did personally
"enjoy" the play.
