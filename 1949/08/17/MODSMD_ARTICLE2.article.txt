### 
In a major address here Monday afternoon President Elpidio

thought of as a back door.
Stressing the need of his country for the moral encouragement

of the United States, as well as re- j
newed economic support, President |
Quirino said that the Pacific Union, j
the Far East version of the Atlantic
Pact, must be approved. After see
ing ten years of training for auton- :
omous government devastated by '
war, the people of the Philippines
need immediate spiritual and finan- i
cial implementation from the Unit- J
ed States, he said.
He called his people the '"most re- j
silient" in the world, and warned ,
that even as the Spanish, Chinese.
Japanese, British, and Germans had
imprinted the Philippine character,
so the dangerous Communist front
threatens to destroy what the
United States has been building for
fifty years.
'Thank God for those American
battleships which we have had up,

to now," he shouted. "You cannot,
you must not, ignore the East."
Pointing to fears of economic loss,
the President assured the people
that the Philippines are financially
sound, that taxes of $150,000,000 per
year aie being collected now, and
that the U.S. must look on the Is
lands as a "material and political
and moral outpost."
"There is still time if the United
States has foresight, determination,
and interest. Now the Atlantic is
guaranteed with a pact. The Pacific
must be looked upon as your front
door!"
Dr. Sterling introduced the head
of state at his appearance here, re
cording the day as a rare occasion
for Stanford.
A reception following the speech
was held for the Island officials in
the Lou Henry Hoover Room of
the Hoover Library.
