# Orange Bowl Decries Rule
## 
### 
MIAMI, Fla., Aug. 15 (UP).—Mi
ami's Orange Bowl football game
and week - long festival would be
"financially wrecked," an official
said today, if a proposed NCAA
ruling limiting bowls to 20 per cent
of the '.',ross receipts of thejr post
season games is adopted.
"We cannot operate on a mere
20 per cent of the gross," Grover
Morrow, first vice-president of the
Orange Bowl, said. "In the first
place, we must pay 15 per cent for
stadium rental alone, and the
NCAA proposal would force us to
eliminate our wonderful half-time
pageant and the lavish entertain
ment we provide the players and
officials of each team."
The NCAA proposal would pro
vide that the competing teams re
ceive 80 per cent of the gross.
"Our ' profit last year was only
about $4,000 out of a gross gate of
more than $300,000, which certainly
indicates that the competing schools
were not exploited as has been
claimed.' Morrow said. "They each
received $75,000."
'"Ours is a non-profit organiza
tion, but when we do make some
thing over expenses it is placed in
a special fund for the time when
our game may not fare so well."
