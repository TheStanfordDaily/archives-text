# Ruth's Story Still Lives On
## 
### MORTY NOVICK 
One year ago on August 15 Babe |
Ruth, but a hollow shell of his once
vitally alive self, got up from his
bed at Memorial Hospital, New
Yor, and it seemed then that even
Death would have to walk the j
Bambino.
But, late in the afternoon of the
next day.the Great Umpire pressed
his indicator on the inevitable "out" j
as the shadow that finally en- j
shrouds all mortals fell across j
George Herman Ruth.
There was little shock when the
news came. Many had known that
the Babe, a victim of cancer, was j
having life slowly and agonizingly i
taken from his body.
Those who had seen him a few
weeks before at the Yankee Sta- j
dium — a haggard, shriveled -up
man, his voice but a harsh, rasping !
gasp as he said a few words on j
behalf of the Babe Ruth Founda
tion for kids—knew that the end
was near.
For a quarter of a century he had j
been MR. BASEBALL. That's
spelled with all capitals because J
wherever lie went . . . Chicago . . .
Detroit ... St. Petersburg . . . Day
ton . . . the crowds came out to
cheer him. He was idolized, wor
shipped, and loved. Ask any kid
today about Babe Ruth. He'll tell j
you all about his batting feats, his
home runs, and his strike-outs.
It was fantastic, perhaps unbe
lievable, that the big ugly man
with the barrel-like torso and thin,
canary legs held such a grip on the
American people. But he did. And
stil! does as old-timers still talk
about him with nostalgic reverie i
and the kids remember him al- !
though they weren't even around
when his booming bat was hitting
home runs.
There was a certain innate fine
ness to the man. A lavish spender
anil a free-wheeling sort of guy, he j
was at heart a simple, earthly man.
He loved life and he loved kids,
"because.* as Tom Meany said in j
his biography. "Babe Ruth." "the
Babe was just a big kid himself."
