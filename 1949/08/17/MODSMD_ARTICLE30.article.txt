ager Billy Southworth of the Bos
ton Braves was given a leave of
absence for the rest of the season
tonight because of "failing health."
Braves President Lou Perini said
Southworth would be replaced by
Coach Johnny Cooney.
Perini disclosde that he proposed
the leave of absence idea to his
manager. Southworth has been the
target of much criticism this season
because his Braves failed to put up
a stiff light in defense of their Na
tional League pennant.
A Braves spokesman denied a re
port Southworth had collapsed.
'"Nothing of the sort." said Pub
licity Assistant Charley Sands. "The
whole mater was talked over thor
oughly before the decision was
made. It certainly did not come
from any immediate health failure
by Southworth."
Southworth. his wife and daugh
ter were flown to their home in
Sunbury. Ohio, in Perini's private
plane, the club disclosed.
The startling development in the
Braves' floundering pennant de
