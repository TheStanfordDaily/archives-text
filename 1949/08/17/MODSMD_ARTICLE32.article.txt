# Two Broncs Break Football Records
## 
### 
Two Santa Clara footballers have
been officially accorded recognition
for breaking three collegiate foot
ball records between them.
They are Hall Haynos, Bronco
halfback, and Ellery Williams, end.
Both will be back this year.
Official recognition was given
when the Football Writers' Associa
tion of America published its official
schedule and record book last week.
Ellery Williams shattered a six
year mark, set by Lamar Davis of
Georgia, by averaging 29.6 yards
per forward pass caught. The
Bronco end amassed l>2l total yards
from passing. Second record set by
Williams, and previously shared by
several collegians, was in the num
ber of touchdown passes caught in a
single season. The old mark was
eightâ€”Williams made it nine. Three
of 'em against USF, Oct. 31!
Halfback Hall Haynes eclipsed
the punt mark of 43.3 yards set in
'47 by Les Palmer of North Caro
lina. Haynes' 43.5 average in 47
punts, however, was half a yard
short of the 44-yard average by
Charley Justice of North Carolina,
who currently wears the college
punting crown.
