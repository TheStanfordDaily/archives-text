# Longshoremen File Suit; Negotiations Reopened
## 
### 
HONOLULU, T.H., Aug. 16 (UP). —Striking CIO longshoremen
and employers formally agreed to renew negotiations today as
the union opened its legal campaign against the territorial dock
seizure law by asking $3,000,000 in damages from government
officials and an injunction to prevent enforcement of the anti-
act.

A formal pact signed in Gov. In
gram Stainback's office by manage
ment and union leaders including
Harry Bridges, president of the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Association, agreed
to intervention by Cyrus Ching, di
rector of the Federal Conciliation
Service, if no agreement is arrived
at after three days of negotiations.
Under the proposal, Ching would
be invited to Hawaii to try to settle
the dispute, presumably by medi
ation.
Resumption of bargaining was
proposed by Bridges himself and
the agreement came on what union
officials described as the "D-Day"
of the legal battle they plan to carry
to the United States Supreme Court
if necessary to challenge the con
stitutionality of the territorial law
that seeks to end the 107-day tieup
of island ports.
The damage and injunction suit
was filed in federal court before
Judge Delbert E. Metzger and asked
the court to restrain Hawaiian At
torney General Walter Ackerman
from enforcing the anti-strike law
on grounds it revoked the civil and
contractual rights of longshoremen.
Signing the negotiation pact for
the union were Bridges, Henry
Schmidt, and Frederick Low. and
for the employers W. Russell Starr,
chief industry negotiator.
The agreement provides that new
negotiations will begin from scratch
with both parties withdrawing all
earlier proposals. The union agreed
not to boost its earlier demand for a
32-cent hourly wage hike—the is
sue that touched off the strike last
May 1.
