# Workshop to Stage Five Operatic Gems
## 
### 
Selections from five operas will be presented tonight at
Memorial Hall at 8:15 by the Stanford Opera Workshop.
The program will feature excerpts from two American operas,
' A Tree on the Plains," by Ernst Bacon and"The Prodigal Son,"
by Frederick Jacobi.
A Tree on the Plains" is set in the American Southwest and

tells the story of a drought. The
composer is teaching classes in
musicology and chamber music at
Stanford this quarter.
The opera begins with a funeral
on an isolated, lonely farm, and ends
with the rejoicing of the rain that
breaks the drought.
The conflict is between the girl
who longs for the neon lights of
town, her farm suitor and her
sophisticated brother.
The book is by the famous Paul
Horgan, who uses terse, colloquial
speech. The opera was commis
sioned by the League of Composers
in 1941 and had its first performance
in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at
the city's annual music festival. It
was composed for students and has
been presented since on many cam
puses.
Jacobi's "Prodigal Son" is a set of
four scenes based on familiar prints
that used to hang on American walls
by a man named Kellogg. Stanford
has selected the liveliest of the
scenes, "The Prodigal Wastes His
Substance," which is described as
taking place in "an elegant hot-spot
of pre-Victorian America."
Other numbers on the program in
clude two scenes from Act I of
Mozart's "Cosi fan Tutte," a scene
from "Martha" by Von Flotow, and
a scene from Verdi's "Falstaff."
Professor Jan Popper, who is
leaving shortly to assume a position
at UCLA, will conduct the orches
tra, and Joel Carter will handle the
stage direction.
Tickets, priced at GO cents, may be
obtained at the box office. A repeat
performance will be given Sunday
also at 8:15 p.m. in Woodminster
Amphitheater, Oakland.
