# Lord Nelson The Lover In Sunday Flick
## 
### 
From out of the musty history
tomes of merrie o'de Engelande to
the Sunday Movie stage comes a
spicy -caudal of the Napoleonic
wars, "That Hamilton Woman,"
starring Vivien Leigh and Lau
rence Olivier.
The cinema reveals the torrid ro
mance of that one-armed sea dog
Lord Nelson and the wife of a Brit
ish official, Lady Hamilton. Against
the background of the war, Olivier
and Miss Leigh perform what has
been hailed as the greatest of their
roles together.
Olivier is this year's Academy
Award winner, and in private life
is married to Miss Leigh.
Hollywood and Britain have com
bined forces to produce a great epic
of the Napoleonic war. Nelson's de
feat of the French navy at Trafalgar
is realistically enacted upon the
screen.
The two final chapters of "The
Daughter of Don Q" will also be
shown. According to Howard Mil
ler, movie series director, Dolores
and Cliff were last seen in an ex
ploding laboratory. Quipped Mil
ler as he spliced marshmallow-fla
vored film with his teeth: "Hell,
they're goin' to get out safe, capture
Donovan and Manning, marry, and
raise a half-dozen little Don Q's."
Rounding out the bill will be an
other Warner Bros, cartoon. The
rhythmic clapping will commence
immediately at 7:30 p.m., and ad
mission is 20 cents.
