# U.S. Population Increase May Change Hospitals
## 
### 
The percentage of the population in the United States over 65
years of age has nearly doubled in the past 50 years, a fact which
may change the nation's hospital picture.

Dr. Julius Katzive, manager of Mt. Zion Hospital in San Fran
cisco, told 85 hospital administrators attending an intensive

♦ two-week refresher course at the
University Wednesday afternoon
that hospitals can expect an in
creased emphasis on chronic care
patients.
Illnesses of more than three
months duration are generally
: considered lo be chronic, according
selection l'rom his new American
have heart ailments, hardening o£
the arteries, rheumatism, diabetes,
and other ailments, he said.
People are living longer because
i medical discoveries and improved
! public health measures are cutting
' down deaths from acute illnesses.
Dr. Katzive said it is estimated that
between 1940 and 1947 the lives oi
250,000 persons were saved which,
previously would have been ended
by illnesses.
Dr. Katzive said that in 1900 only
4 per cent of the population was
over 65 years. Now approximately
7 per cent of the nation's popula
tion is over 65.
Although more people are living
longer, they are still subject to
chronic ailments. However, the out
look for patients with chronic ill
nesses has changed in recent years,
according to Dr. Katzive.
"The emphasis is now one of hope
rather than hopelessness," he as
serted. He said that facilities foi"
the care of chronic patients have
changed.
Dr. Katzive recommended that
chronic care hospitals be closely af
filiated with acute care hospitals so
that laboratory, surgical, and X-ray
facilities are available.
He mentioned use of home care
i programs as a step to ease the de
mand for chronic care hospials. He
said that in the Bay Area the cost
of building a chronic care hospital,
without laboratory, surgical, or X
ray facilities, is $12,000 a bed. He
listed special facilities which should
be available in chronic care hospi
tals, including those for recreation,
physical therapy, and occupational
therapy.
