## Alumni Deserve Ducats 
### 
Excom Wednesday night put its stamp of approval on a sug
gestion concerning Big Game football tickets. It seems that
there aren't going to be enough to go around to the alumni who
deserve them, and to the students wanting two extra tickets to
the game.
Stanford gets 35 per cent of the seats available at the Stadium
ior the Big Game. Cal gets the other 65 per cent. The reason
jot the discrepancy is the difference in the size of the two
schools.
A 1 Masters has received an unexpected number of requests
jor tickets to this year's Big Game, and is running short of tickets.
It boils down to this: whether the paid-up alumni should get
the tickets we think they deserve, or whether a small percentage
of the student body should be able to buy two tickets apiece at
S5 each.
The students of course will get their regular rooters tickets.
The extra tickets, which the students have been able to buy for
the last few years, have been available because the demand from
the alumni was not then up to what it is this year.
Many of these "extra" tickets have shown up in the City just
before the game at scalpers' prices. Others have gone to friends
or families of students.
The suggestion that Excom approved was that of making the
lickets available to the alumni, and not to the students.
The alumni have a very definite interest in the school and
the football games. We don't think friends and family—and out
siders who buy scalped tickets—deserve to see the games if it
will keep the alumni out.
If you're worried about not getting the tickets you want, con
sider this. The average student goes to Stanford for four years.
He's an alumnus for a lot longer than that.
We think it only fair that the alumni get the tickets rather
than the students, who will have their own rooters tickets,
Enyway.
