Non-political Ruling
To the Editor:
Oii August 17 a letter appeared in Daily opposing the University regu
lation that campus platforms be denied to "political" speakers unless
' both" sides are represented, on the basis that such a rule "emasculates
liberal education" by excluding consideration of current problems from
campus life, that the rule is based on the false assumption of the possi
bility of readily distinguishing political speakers from non-political, and
of the existence of two and only two sides to every question, and that,
iurthermore the rule was not consistently applied in the case of Mr.
Hoover's obviously political speech on campus.
We are in agreement with the signers of this letter and feel that the
"University should re-examine the rule as a valid interpretation of the
clause in Mrs. Stanford's will, or if the rule must be preserved, should
clarify the nature of this rule and apply it consistently.

To the Editor:
Young Progressives considers it necessary io clarify its part in the
circumstances surrounding the Hoover speech. We wish to make clear
that we appreciate hearing any controversial speaker on campus, Mr.
Hoover included. However, Hoover's speech was political in nature,
which, according to administration policy requires that differing views
i lso be presented. Therefore, we requested the administration to present
in opposition speaker at some later date, because it might hamper the
birthday celebration if another speaker were on the platform.
Our request was turned down; as an unrecognized organization we had
t,o right to make a request, and, according to the administration, even
&o the request was absurd.
In the past year such figures as Chan, Hoover, Quirino, and the Spanish
Consul-General have spoken on campus. To the unbiased observer this
might connect Stanford University with Chiang Kai-Shek, Franco, the
old-line Republican Party, and the proposed Pacific Pact—a certainly
unwanted impression. What is needed is an impartial forum on present
►peakers of varying opinions on controversial subjects. Such a forum
already exists in the formative stages under the sponsorship of Deans
Spaeth, Faust, and Kimpton, and should be supported.
