# Dr. Jan Popper, Conductor, Czech Aviator, Masters Opera Workshop
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
OH to the northwest of the Quad,
in what might be called the tules
of the Stanford campus sets an old
yellow-shingled building called the
Woodpecker Lodge.
It was apparently built some short
time .after the Fall of Jericho, and
is now shredded by woodpecker
holes and flanked by glorious Stan
ford weeds. Some people might call
it an atmospheric old shrine. Other,
more crude, individuals might call
it the dilapidated hole-in-the-wall
that it is.
The front of the building houses
a "division of records," probably of
the current expenditures of the
Army of the Potomac. A few rooms
are also given over to the Red
Cross.
Opera Workshop Here
Most of the colorful old fire-trap
is devoted big-heartedly to the ac
tivities of the Stanford University
Opera Workshop. Not that the work
shop students, being successful pio
neers, seem to mind. With complete
abandon, they sweep freely over the
the stage, little knowing, or appar
ently caring, when they may find
themselves in the basement. With
clasped hands, they sound a full
round note, unclasping only when
sure the roof is not about to come
down and join in a chorus.
The most intrepid and notable of
these foolhardy artists is the direc
tor, Professor Herbert Jan Popper.
Dr. Popper is a brown-eyed and
easy-smiling gentleman of some ac
complishments. He was born in the
Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, in
1907. A never-filled hunger up to
the age of 11 is the excuse he now
uses to wheedle his wife, a profes
sional singer in her own right, into
buying an occasional beefsteak.
Conductor. First Job
At the age of 19, he got his first
job as a conductor, soon after be

coming the youngest conductor on
the staff of the Prague Opera House.
From 1936 to 1939 he was a pilot
with the Masaryk League, a group of
1,000 fliers who were not taken in
by Chamberlain's "Peace in Our
Time." After the conquest of Czecho
slovakia he escaped to America,
where he joined the staff of the
Stanford Music Department. He
now fondly speaks of Stanford as
his home.
But, like any serious man, he has
engineered a few improvements in
the old homestead.
First of all, he set up the Opera
Workshop, one of the first of such
college ventures in the country, and
according to visiting Professor Ernst
Bacon, who ought to know, one of
the best.
Purpose of Workshop
The purpose of the Workshop is
threefold: It fetches a piece of opera
out of the senile circus of idle cou
pon-clippers and brings it to the
universities where it more properly
belongs; it offers promising singers
a chance to study and stage opera;
and it fosters the production of
new American opera, a pleasure
which the commercial opera houses,
with a blind eye to a mythical some
thing called puljlic -taste, avoid like
the plague.
And the results of the Workshop
have been rewarding all around.
Witness last year's production of
"Peter Grimes," and the spring per
formance of "Shvanda the Bag
piper."
Today's Program
Tonight's program of excerpts
from five operas, to be presented in
the Memorial Auditorium, will,
however, be a culmination of all
three of the Workshop's aims.
Three of the offerings will be from
the tradition of European opera.
And the other two are new Ameri
can operas, experimental in nature,

yet composed by two of the tpo
fiight composers in the U.S., Ernst
Bacon and Frederick Jacobi.
The program, which is under the
stage direction of Joel Carter, will
feature all members of the Stanford
Opera Workshop.
Having seen the rehearsals, I sin
cerely submit that the production is
well worth seeing.
Professor Popper is leaving at the
end of summer quarter to take a
sabbatical position at UCLA.
May we wish him a successful
year, and may we hope, upon his
return, that he will consider Stan
ford still his home. There are still
a number of improvements to be
made.
