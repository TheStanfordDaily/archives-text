### ED CASWELL 
Stanford will be witness to the
pomp and glory of a colorful me
dieval ceremony on Friday after
noon, Oct. 7, when the University
will inaugurate its fifth president,
Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling.
A tentative outline for the oc
casion includes a luncheon to be
given at Lagunita Court for the in
auguration delegates. These dele
gates will be prominent men invited
to represent 300 of the leading uni
versities and colleges throughout
the United States, as well as some
50 learned societies and 50 founda
tions, such as the Rockefeller
Foundation.
After the luncheon the delegates
will assemble and move in a for
mal academic procession into the
Memorial Church at 2:30 p.m. There
services will be conducted by Chap
lain Paul C. Johnston.
From the Memorial Church the

delegates, all of whom will be clad
in caps and gowns in a colorful ar
ray, will be led, as is the custom, by
the representative from the oldest
academic institution in the country,
President Conant of Harvard Uni
versity, out through the Memorial
Quad down to the Frost Amphi
theater.
The majority of the faculty will
also enter the procession, as well as
the ASSU Executive Committee, the
Executive Board of the Alumni
Committee, the Board of Governors
of Stanford Associates, the Trustees,
and former trustees. Among the six
former trustees are Judge George
Crothers, who financed Crothers
Hall, Ralph Arnold of Los Angeles,
Judge John T. Nourse, Francis Price
of Santa Barbara, and former
comptroller, Almon E. Roth.
President Paul C. Edwards of the
Board of Trustees will then intro
duce Dr. Sterling from the stage of
the amphitheater, and the new

president will deliver his inaugura
tion address.
Indefinite plans have been made
for a faculty reception which will
follow the inauguration, and give the
delegates a chance to meet Dr. Ster
j hng.
"We hope to work in more student
■ participation than planned," said
Lyle Cook, co-ordinator of activ
ities for the day. Already the fac
ulty is giving much time to the cere
monial plans in connection with
staging and music.
Professor Marion R. Kirkwood
heads the faculty committee, which
is composed of Dean Clarence H.
Faust. E. E. Robinson, Hugh Skil —
ling, and Dean Douglas M. Whitaker.
The Stanford Alumni Association
and Stanford Associates, taking ad
vantage of the opportunity of the
gathering, will give give a formal
reception and dinner for the Ster
lings at the Palace Hotel on the
eve of the inauguration.
