i To the Editor:
The undersigned were disturbed
by two points in connection with
the presentation of Elpidio Quirino
at a special University convocation
Monday afternoon. Although Mr.
; Quirino may have offered informa
i Lion of sufficient interest to warrant
such an action, and although the
President of the Philippine Repub
lic may deserve an honor befitting
the dignity of his office, we feel that
before he spoke the University, the
Daily, or both might well have
made clear the following points:
(1) The alleged fact that Mr.
Quirino is a collaborator, "who had
signed his name to a letter pledg
ing loyalty and obedience to Japan
j while the Americans were still
fighting Japan." (B. Sceman and
, L. Salisbury, "Cross - Currents in
• the Philippines," American Coun
cil, Institute of Pacific Relations,
No. 23. 1946, p. 47.) In this connec
tion it might also have been made
I clear before the Quirino convoca

tion that the present Philippine
chief executive while still a senator \
introduced a bill which would in i
effect "whitewash most of the big
collaborators." (H. Abaya, "Be
trayal in the Philippines," New
York. 194G, p. 112. foreword by
Harold L. Ickes.) Essential portions
of this bill became law.
(2) The apparent infringement of
the University regulation forbid
ding "political" speeches on the
campus. It seems evident that
President Quirino is or will be a
candidate to succeed himself in the
approaching Philippine elections, j
Furthermore, the avov ed purpose |
of Mr. Quirino's trip to this coun- !
try concerns the of an j
alliance directed against Commu
nism in the Pacific, the hrdative for
which came from Chiang Kai-shek.
This is certainly as much a political I
as it is a military problem, both in j
the Philippines and in the United j
States. We are pleased, in fact, that I
the University seems willing to ig- !

nore the regulation in question.
This attitude has been evidenced by
the speech of Mr. Herbert Hoover
last week as well as by that of Mr.
Quirino. We are disturbed, how
ever. that the policy prohibiting
"political" speeches apparently re
mains " >n the books," at least in so
far as points of view opposing those
of such extreme conservatives as
Mr. Hoover and Mr. Quirino are
concerned.

made clear the following points:
(1) The alleged fact that Mr.
Quirino is a collaborator, "who had
signed his name to a letter pledg
ing loyalty and obedience to Japan
j while the Americans were still
fighting Japan." (B. Sceman and
, L. Salisbury, "Cross - Currents in
• the Philippines," American Coun
cil, Institute of Pacific Relations,
No. 23. 1946, p. 47.) In this connec
tion it might also have been made
I clear before the Quirino convoca

tion that the present Philippine
chief executive while still a senator \
introduced a bill which would in i
effect "whitewash most of the big
collaborators." (H. Abaya, "Be
trayal in the Philippines," New
York. 194G, p. 112. foreword by
Harold L. Ickes.) Essential portions
of this bill became law.
(2) The apparent infringement of
the University regulation forbid
ding "political" speeches on the
campus. It seems evident that
President Quirino is or will be a
candidate to succeed himself in the
approaching Philippine elections, j
Furthermore, the avov ed purpose |
of Mr. Quirino's trip to this coun- !
try concerns the of an j
alliance directed against Commu
nism in the Pacific, the hrdative for
which came from Chiang Kai-shek.
This is certainly as much a political I
as it is a military problem, both in j
the Philippines and in the United j
States. We are pleased, in fact, that I
the University seems willing to ig- !

nore the regulation in question.
This attitude has been evidenced by
the speech of Mr. Herbert Hoover
last week as well as by that of Mr.
Quirino. We are disturbed, how
ever. that the policy prohibiting
"political" speeches apparently re
mains " >n the books," at least in so
far as points of view opposing those
of such extreme conservatives as
Mr. Hoover and Mr. Quirino are
concerned.

i To the Editor:
The undersigned were disturbed
by two points in connection with
the presentation of Elpidio Quirino
at a special University convocation
Monday afternoon. Although Mr.
; Quirino may have offered informa
i Lion of sufficient interest to warrant
such an action, and although the
President of the Philippine Repub
lic may deserve an honor befitting
the dignity of his office, we feel that
before he spoke the University, the
Daily, or both might well have
made clear the following points:
(1) The alleged fact that Mr.
Quirino is a collaborator, "who had
signed his name to a letter pledg
ing loyalty and obedience to Japan
j while the Americans were still
fighting Japan." (B. Sceman and
, L. Salisbury, "Cross - Currents in
• the Philippines," American Coun
cil, Institute of Pacific Relations,
No. 23. 1946, p. 47.) In this connec
tion it might also have been made
I clear before the Quirino convoca

tion that the present Philippine
chief executive while still a senator \
introduced a bill which would in i
effect "whitewash most of the big
collaborators." (H. Abaya, "Be
trayal in the Philippines," New
York. 194G, p. 112. foreword by
Harold L. Ickes.) Essential portions
