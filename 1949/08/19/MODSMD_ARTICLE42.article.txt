## The 						Sports Desk Second National Football Magazine Picks Stanford Third—So What? 
### 
or the second time this year in pre-season football magazines, Stan-
I has been picked third in the Pacific Coast Conference.
he first ot the predictors to go out on the limb was the Pic Football

behind Cal and USC.

iter of the Annual's Pacific Coast article, one Bill Leiser by name, danced
lbly around, avoiding any tackier who was about ready to nail him

erhaps that is the best attitude to take. Football predictions should be

is bad psychology to feel the victor's cup before the contest. It is

hink.
here is one prediction common to all of the football books which
ryone of us can string along with. This year the PCC is scheduled to
tin its place in national football after the doldrums of the past three
rs. Perhaps, at last, an embarrassed West Coast eleven will mete out
•nge in the h'ose Bowl. No matter which team gets the assignment, the
st to our own part of the country is welcome.

going to go when the first games are played.
might be worthy of note that in the Illustrated Football Annual, one

iehigan and Noire Dame Are About Through
oth Michigan and Notre Dame are supposed to be knocked down from
r lofty pinnacle this year. Who will do it? That, no one knows,
this is not paradoxical. The assassin who will pull the props from
throne will probably be Michigan State. The Spartans are not worried
ut any wooden horses either. Notre Dame doesn't have its horsemen
year.
here is doubt whether Stanford will be the one to knock the Wolverines
n. We may even have trouble with Michigan's little football brother,
vard. The Crimson is one of the top three in the Ivy League (accord
to the dopesters), and 33 of 48 lettermen are returning on the roster,
vard works things differently than we do. Their practice season is
h longer than ours. They even have a summer camp. Also 48 letter
i is a lot for any squad—even where the school is all male.

it all be back. It is a potential, and it could explode.
ho can say?
149 Complete Football made a bid for Pacific Coast unpopularity in an
le about card stunts. They may be right, but it hurts.
ere is what they said: "Pacific Coast colleges seem to indulge in the
(card stunts) far more than institutions in other areas. This might
lue to better weather conditions, proximity to the nation's film capital,
desire to offset the effect of lack-luster football."
