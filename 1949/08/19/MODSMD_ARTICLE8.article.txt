# House Halves Arms Aid Bill

### 
WASHINGTON, August 18
(UP) — The House handed
President Truman a bitter de
feat last night by passing a
foreign arms aid bill that car
ries only half the funds he
sought to re-arm Western Eu
rope.
Mr. Truman has submitted an
! arms program totaling 51,450,000.000
of which $1.1(50,990.000 was ear
i marked for Western Europe.
But the House knocked out half
[ of the European funds by adopting
i an amendment sponsored by Reps,
j James P. Richards (D-S.C.) and
: John M. Vorys (R-O.). The 101 l
I call was 209 to 151.
The House approved the full
amount asked by the President for
other countries — $211,370,000 for
I Greece and Turkey and $27,640,000
I for Iran, Korea, and the Philippines.
An attempt to send the bill back
j to committee was rejected by voice
j vote and it now goes to the Senate
| where it faces a similar fight over
I size of the proposed arms shipments
!to Europe.
Sen. Walter F. George (D-Ga.),
leader of a Senate bloc seeking to
cut the entire program to about
$700,000,000, said the House reduc
tion strengthened the hand of his
| group.
Chiarman Tom Connally (D-Tex.)
jof the Senate Foreign Relations
i Committee, said the administration
would continue its battle for ap
proval of the full program and
would be ready to fight out in con
ference with the House any differ
ences in the versions approved by
the two chambers.
But the House spurned their
pleas and also ignored a last-minute
appeal from Secretary of State Dean
Acheson. Acheson said that a re
duction might indicate to the na
tion's allies that the United States
is suspicious and distrustful of
them.
Richards and Vorys argued suc
cessfully that Congress should ad
vance only half of the money to the
European nations now. The other
half, they said, could be provided
next year if the Atlantic Pact mem
bers set up an acceptable common
j defense plan under terms of the
security alliance.
