### CHUCK MILLER 
« SELF SKETCHES, by Bernard
Shaw; Dodri, Mead & Company;
-H7 illustrated. $11.5t1.
Claiming that anyone interested
n the life of G. B. S. can iind it tlis
)layed in the shop windows, the
•andorous Shaw has at last pitched
ome straws into the wind for
•Ycudinns, socialists, literary peo
)le, and bohemian hangers-on to
•rasp at.
Sixteen in number, they reveal
nuch about the man who admits
hat he was a cannibal until the age
>1 25, and that "neither fish, flesh,
ior i'owl is indispensable to success
literature."
He writes of how this man with
i common past sat for a number of
/ears on a clerk's stool in Dublin,
tin I how not until he was caught
n the British Museum reading
Vlarx's "Capital" in French was he
discovered."

From there he went to the politi- j
cal staff of the "Star" where he !
wrote his conglomerate music and
political economy column and orat- :
ed in the streets, halls, and the rain
of London on Fabian socialism. His
first play was shelved and later
dusted off to cause a controversial
J success.
In telling "who I am and what I
' think," Mr. Shaw answers his spec
j ulators about him on matters of re
i ligion, sex. and politics and takes
considerable time to .correct the
■ blunders of his biographers.
For all who are interested in the
private thoughts of the man who
| scorns cigars, champagne, and
i "thirty suits of fashionable clothes,"
is cravenly afraid of man, and who
| confesses that he is the successor to
Shakespeare, these "Self Sketches"
I are here offered for an entertaining
as well as instructive two hours of
reading.
