## Forgery of Criticism" 
### 
'o the Editor:
In the heat of Mr. Edward Charles' delicate ire he has committed the
•ery forgery of criticism attributed to last Monday's article on "Romeo."
'or him, as well as for what seemed to be an invisible quorum, the play
ould not have been "overall enjoyable" or with its "wrinkles"; so the j
nly logical alternatives are that it was a "fiasco" and in a constant state
f collapse from beginning fo end. Soot or whitewash, audiences are ;
ikely to think in terms of extremes, and hence to condemn an entire
heatrical effort on the grounds that it did not fit vague preconceived
leas of what Shakespeare "must have intended."
Might not the writer's "slightly whimsical sadness" have been a mood
lien to the more apparent seriousness of two families enraged against
aeh other? Not all friars, moreover, either in literature or in reality,
ave loved their ale and dabbled in sin. And it Miss Humphrey defaulted
i her role, she was not the show. Though the acting sometimes makes a
lay, neither "Romeo" —admittedly not one of Shakespeare's best—nol
le friar and Juliet were so insultingly offensive as to give reason for
arboiling the entire production. This amounts to a kind of critical
lyopia i which defects only are seen and the rest of the play is con
idered an a priori flop.
Mr. Strickland once said that one of his main objectives was to edu
ate the people on both sides of the footlights. How? I would respect
ully suggest that the authorities in the drama department try a new tack
f minimizing smashing premieres, colossal gate receipts, and concentrate
n more "little" plays. The students do most of the work anyway; and
Jroadway sets do not a play make. Look at Wilder's "Our Town." Quality
eed not be sacrificed for variety and number, and the authorities may
oine closer to their mark. It is certain that flagrant condemnation is no
ad tan remedy for critical nearsightedness, even when paid for at the rate
f $1.20 a bottle.
Rather hopefully.
