CAMP PENDLETON, Cal.. Aug.
21 (UP). —The first combined Ma
rine - Army reserve training pro- ,
gram in the history of the service J
was hailed as a success today by
Brig. Gen. James T. Roberts, com
mander of the 13th California
Tankers.
Gen. Roberts also said it was the
Hrst time a skeleton division has i
completed a "relatively sell - con
tained training program in the
field."
The observations were made as
the 13th Tankers completed two
weeks of maneuvers this week.

"Our reception by Maj. Gen. j
Graves B. Erskine and his First
Marine Division has been wonder- !
ful," Gen. Roberts said. We have
received every possible assistance
from them and our cordial relations ;
have be>.*n an inspiration. What has |
been accomplished may powerfully j
affect Army reserve unit training in
the future.
