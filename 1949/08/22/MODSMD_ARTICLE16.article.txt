## The 						Sports Desk ail to the Conquering Hero'- Te Band Can Be Heard Already 
### 
\ letter from the sports publicity department of the University of
higan came to the sports desk recently. The Wolverines will begin
ctice on Aug. 31, just after the PCC starts.
And on that day one of Bennie Oosterbaan's big problems will be
om to use for a quarterback. "Pistol Pete" Elliott will not be back,
vvaid Yerges won't be at Ann Arbor either.
There seem to be two choices which Bennie can make. His next quar
baek will probably be Bill Bartlett, who lettered last year and pre
usly played for Navy, or John Ghindia, a real rocking socking blocker
o missed spring practice recovering from a leg operation.
Bartlett missed a good part of spring practice keeping up his studies
medicine. Bartlett is small and stocky. Van Summern, another ex
'y back, may well qualify for the quarter spot. Summern is larger,
„_ighing 180.
The question at Ann Arbor's Ferry Field at the end of this month will
iiot be "What will we use for a quarterback?" but "Whom will we use?"
i'he same problem, and not any more of a knotty one, faces Marchie
jLchwar*z here.
jftr Saturday's Paly Times said that Gary Kerkorian's throwing arm was
Ipijuite all right. This should settle fears bred by a larger daily paper a few
- weeks ago.

The M ichigamlers Have Slatistics Too

I he publicity department at the U. of M. aiso included some statistics,
fhey are impressive, to say the least.
It seems that the Maize and Blue has had a winning streak of 23 games
ince 1946. In their entire history, the Wolverines have won 149 games.
2hey have lost only 55 and tied but ten.
The biggest statistical pileup is against Michigan State. Michigan has
eaten the Spartans 32 times, lost six, and tied three. Michigan opens
gainst the Staters on the 24th. That is Michigan's one game before the
-jame here.
, Of course, we play twice before meeting the national champs, against
< San Jose State and Harvard. From all reports, the tenth '"Big-Ten-er" is
112 cocking to unload on Michigan.
Ihis may enhance the Indians' chances. More properly, this may just
i f.ive us a chance period.
Michigan's iootball history goes back farther than ours. They began
tkeir grid career in 1879, when the Farm was still a farm. But the histories
;re parallel in that both teams played their first games in baseball parks,
nd both teams won their initial game.
The press release from the Michigan Peninsula included this little item.
Iranch Rickey, the Dodger Deacon, coached Michigan baseball teams in
908 and 1909.
At. the same time, he completed a three-year law course in two years,
i'our years later, after he was associated with the St. Louis Browns as
< scout, Rickey invaded the Wolverine campus and delivered a young
tllow named George Sisler to the Browns.

Santa Clara Opens Practice August 29

Santa Clara will open practice sessions on the 29th of September, fall
ig in line directly with the PCC. The Bronco coach, Len Casanova, has
ited 61 men to the fall training period.
"The King of the Independents" will have 16 lettermen returning. Ten
! these were last year's first-string starters. The remaining 45 bids went
' *. f her prospects. Nine of the first eleven this year are seniors. In spite
112 this, the average age of the first string is 1 years.
Santa Clara opens its season against Cal there on Sept. 17. The Broncos
ill wear now red leather helmets, red jerseys, and silver satin pants,
frm fitting yet.
We play Santa Clarr> here on Oct. 29.
A few weeks ago we ran a story on how Ellery Williams broke the
sting record for touchdown passes caught last year. The Bronco caught
ne. The old record was eight, and was shared by a number of receivers.
There is a guy from the local scene who did much better at breaking
ords than Williams did. He is Stan Heath of Nevada. Heath will not
back this year to help the Wolf Pack. He helped them on their
mb to prominence in the immediate post-war years.
He broke the existing record for total yards gained per game, passing
I rushing, with a total of 221.3. He broke the record for total yards
ned passing with 2,005 yards. The old record was 1.457 yards. He also
ew 22 touchdown passes to break the record there.

ctice on Aug. 31, just after the PCC starts.
And on that day one of Bennie Oosterbaan's big problems will be
om to use for a quarterback. "Pistol Pete" Elliott will not be back,
vvaid Yerges won't be at Ann Arbor either.
There seem to be two choices which Bennie can make. His next quar
baek will probably be Bill Bartlett, who lettered last year and pre
usly played for Navy, or John Ghindia, a real rocking socking blocker
o missed spring practice recovering from a leg operation.
Bartlett missed a good part of spring practice keeping up his studies
medicine. Bartlett is small and stocky. Van Summern, another ex
'y back, may well qualify for the quarter spot. Summern is larger,
„_ighing 180.
The question at Ann Arbor's Ferry Field at the end of this month will
iiot be "What will we use for a quarterback?" but "Whom will we use?"
i'he same problem, and not any more of a knotty one, faces Marchie

The M ichigamlers Have Slatistics Too

I he publicity department at the U. of M. aiso included some statistics,
fhey are impressive, to say the least.
It seems that the Maize and Blue has had a winning streak of 23 games
ince 1946. In their entire history, the Wolverines have won 149 games.
2hey have lost only 55 and tied but ten.
The biggest statistical pileup is against Michigan State. Michigan has
eaten the Spartans 32 times, lost six, and tied three. Michigan opens
gainst the Staters on the 24th. That is Michigan's one game before the
-jame here.
, Of course, we play twice before meeting the national champs, against
< San Jose State and Harvard. From all reports, the tenth '"Big-Ten-er" is
112 cocking to unload on Michigan.
Ihis may enhance the Indians' chances. More properly, this may just
i f.ive us a chance period.
Michigan's iootball history goes back farther than ours. They began
tkeir grid career in 1879, when the Farm was still a farm. But the histories
;re parallel in that both teams played their first games in baseball parks,
nd both teams won their initial game.
The press release from the Michigan Peninsula included this little item.
Iranch Rickey, the Dodger Deacon, coached Michigan baseball teams in
908 and 1909.
At. the same time, he completed a three-year law course in two years,
i'our years later, after he was associated with the St. Louis Browns as
< scout, Rickey invaded the Wolverine campus and delivered a young
tllow named George Sisler to the Browns.

A few weeks ago we ran a story on how Ellery Williams broke the
sting record for touchdown passes caught last year. The Bronco caught
ne. The old record was eight, and was shared by a number of receivers.
There is a guy from the local scene who did much better at breaking
