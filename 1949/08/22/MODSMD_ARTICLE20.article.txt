The hollow boom oi Confederate
j guns echoed through the streets of
| Washington in 18(12, the year Con
nie Mack and Amos Alonzo Stagg
j were brought into this world.
i Since then thousands of words
j have been written and spoken
i about the two Grand Old Men who
i have, lor all time, notched their
I names in the ever turning wheel of
j sport.
Dynasties have fallen . . . the
globe has been torn apart by devas-
I tating wars . , . great men have
; burst upon the scene, shone like
i exploding stars and then vanished
I as quickly, but the two octogenar
! ians are still going strong.
Stagg, the Grand Old Man of
| Football, just celebrated his 87th
j birthday on Aug. 16 as physical ed
j ucation director at the College of
i the Pacific.
While Stagg was Ttead athletic
man at Chicago his football teams
| were labeled "machines" and "jug
| gernauts," and during his 41-year

stay he won 268 games and lost 141.
From the "Old Man," as his boys
call him, the game has taken the
tackling dummy, end-around play,
tackle-back shift, and hidden ball
principle,
A devout man, like Mr. Mack, hi.9
counterpart in baseball, he has
never smoked, sworn, or tasted the
evils of John Barleycorn.
Cornelius McGillieuddy, who
shortened his name to Connie Mack,
because it couldn't fit into the box
score when he was catching for
Meriden in the Connecticut State
League, is four months Stagg's jun
ior.
Ad though they gained fame in
two different sport fields, their per
sonalities and philosophies are al
most identical.
