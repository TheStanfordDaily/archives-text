FARFA. Italy. Aug. 21 (UP).—ln
grid Bergman stepped down from
in front of the cameras here early
today and said, "That is the final
shot I will ever act before a motion
picture camera."
Handsome Italian director Roberto
Rossellini had just said "Cut!" to
the crew photographing the final
scene of "Stromboli," an American
financed picture directed and pro
duced by Rossellini and starring
Miss Bergman.
Rossellini rose from a small
wooden box alongside the camera
and walked over to the star. He
kissed her lightly on both chceks
and told her:
"It's all over, dear, and thank
you."
Miss Bergman then said in an ex
clusive interview:
"I wish to make it clear that my
intention to withdraw from the
screen is final and definite. The
kind of publicity which has arisen
about me since I arrived in Italy
is largely responsible for this deci
sion—an end to what has always
been the greatest love in my life—
acting.
"I am a shy and timid person,
and although I understand that peo
ple will laugh and doubt that I have
now finished with motion pictures,
I wish to inform you—and please
have it published—that my decision
is a firm one." Miss Bergman added.
