# Workshop Commended for Opera Scenes
## 
### DUANE SPILLSBURY 
The excerpts from Mozart's "Cosi
Fan Tutte," one of the opera scenes
presented Friday night under the
direction of Dr. Jan Popper, were
a hilarious satire on 18th century
manners and morals.
The cencs gave the principals,
William Bond, Robert Dunlap, Ewan
Harbrecht, Patricia Hall, and Jun
ius Gale an opportunity for some
lovely arias and duets. Particularly
good were the crochety actions and
sly humor Gale put into the part
of the cynical bachelor, Don Al
fonso, md the "de'icate" quintet of
farewell in the second scene.
The highlight of the excerpt from
'Martha" was the slap-stick actions
of the elderly fop. Sir Tristram

Mickleford, played by Raymond
Hammett, and the fine soprano
voice of Marni Nixon and the small
but true and clear voice of Geral
dine Williams.
Verdi' 3 opeva "Falstaff," based
upon the complicated plotting of
Shakespeare, offered some catchy
and melodious counterpoint which,
according to some observers, was a
little beyond the ability of the
Workshop group.
Since I had too good a time to be
objective, I can make no comment
upon this, but I do offer that if it
be so. at least the presentation was
redeemed by the love duets of
Betty Benson and Caesar Curzi.
The Western premiere of Bacon's
"A free on the Plains" provided
some line melodies (especially the
"Hymn to Evening"), stirring and
complicated rhythms between voice
and orchestra, and a sincere emo
tional feeling.
The happy combination of Ba
con's music and Paul Morgan's li

bretto produced an excellent study
in raw character and human emo
tions that was, more than educa
tional; it wasÂ» very entertaining.
Particularly good were the per
formances of William Bond and
I Robert Dunlap. and their enthusi
astic singing of Bacon's clever take
off on the folk song, "Froggy Went
a CourtinY'
The program closed with a per
formance of the second act of Fred
erick Jacobi's ''The Prodigal Son."
based upon a series of early Ameri
can prints. Raymond Hammett as
the black-browed cynic and Betty
Benson's singing were excellent.
Perhaps the program won't drive
the Metropolitan Opera Company
into retirement, but then the seats
didn't cost S6.GO in the 17th bal
cony. To anyone who went and
didn't have a fine time and to those
who didn't go, I offer my condo
lences. To the entire Stanford O
: era Workshop, 112 offer my sincere
thanks for a happy event.
