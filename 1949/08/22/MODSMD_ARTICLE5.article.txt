# Britain Has Chance For Atom Base
## Officials Demand American Control 
### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21 (UP).—
High U.S. officials are discussing the
possibility of "basing" atomic bombs
in Britain, but under safeguards
that would keep them under ex
clusive American control, it was
learned today.
Key members of Congress, who
already have held several informal
conferences with top administration
officials on the question, regard it as
one of the basic issues to be faced
in connection with joint defense
| planning under the North Atlantic
j Security Pact.
The role of the A - bomb in
' discounting aggression by Russia
I against Western Europe may come
j in for further discussion when the
j combined Senate Foreign Relations
j and Armed Services Committees
j meet behind closed doors Tuesday
i to begin final work on President
; Truman's $1,450,000,000 arms aid
| program.
A United Press poll over the
weekend showed that 13 Senators,
I or a majority of the joint commit-
I tee, favor restoring all or at least a
large part of the $580,495,000 which
the House last week cut from the
j funds for shipments of conventional
arms to European pact members.
But some legislators strongly be
lieve tint shipments of conventional
i arms, even in the full amount re
| quested by the administration,
I would be merely a stop-gap meas
; ure until a decision is reached on
i exactly how the atomic bomb will
' be fitted into the defense scheme.
It was recalled that Gen. Omar N.
1 Bradley, chairman of the U.S. joint
1 chiefs of staff, said in his recent tes
. tiinony on the arms program that
the primary strategic responsibility
of the United States in Atlantic
j Pact defense planning would be
. j long-range bombing and delivery of
; the atomic bomb.
. ; Persons in close touch with the
i situation report that so far no de
cision has been reached on whether
the United States can meet that re
, sponsibility by keeping its atomic
weapons hoarded in this country,
I or whether it should stockpile some
I I of the weapons closer to the cold
I war front lines in Britain.
