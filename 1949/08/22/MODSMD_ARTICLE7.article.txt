## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21 (UP).— ■
Senate "five percenter" investiga- j
tors today searched the records of a
Chicago perfume company for evi- t
dence of any "motive" behind its
deep freezer gifts to Maj. Gen.
Harry H. Vaughan, President Tru
man's military aide.
Committee sources disclosed that
the staff now has records of the
Albert Verley Co., which made the
first of the "gifts" in June 1945. j
shortly before the famed trip to
Paris of the mysterious John Mara
gon, Vaughan's "close friend," and
two others in a military plane.
As the search of the records pro
ceeded, investigators:
1. Disclosed they have obtained j
evidence that Vaughan several j
times requested special considera- i
tions and government priorities for i
friends.
2. Chucked reports that Vaughan
"got rough" with an Agriculture
Department aide in a telephone call
after a 1940 tightening of grain al
locations to distillers.
3. Completed plans for question
ing Maj. Gen. Herman Feldman,
suspended Army Quartermaster
General, about his activities with
James V. Hunt, alleged Washington
"influence salesman." Hunt was
quoted by earlier witnesses as de
scribing himself as the "most infiu
ential man" so far as the Quarter
master Department was concerned.
4. Got ready to call later two stars
of the cast—Vaughan and Maragon.
both of whom keep popping out in
the testimony of various witnesses.
