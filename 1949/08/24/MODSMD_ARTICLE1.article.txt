The highway to Guayaquil, Ecua
dor's only large port of entry, has

transporting supplies into the coun
try. !
Asout $50,000,000 is needed for
immediate relief work, according to
Galo Plaza Lasso, President of the
South American republic, who was

dor Relief Fund under the leader
ship of Cyril I. Magnin and Dr. J.
