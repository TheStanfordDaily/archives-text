# FOREST FIRES UNDER CONTROL

SAN FRANCISCO. Aug. 23 (UP).
â€”Only two of the 118 forest fires
touched off by lightning in national
forests from the Mexican border to
a point north of Sacramento were
causing concern today.
Meanwhile heroic work by ma
rines and civilian firefighters saved
the hamlet of Deluz, 20 miles north
of San Diego, from an uncontrolled
fire which charred 3.000 acres and
was still burning tonight.
