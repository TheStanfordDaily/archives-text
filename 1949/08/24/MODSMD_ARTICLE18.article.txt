# Tito Gives Soviets 'Hands Off' Order

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 23
(UP). â€” Marshal Tito's government
told Russia today not to meddle in
| Yugoslavia's internal affairs and
j said that it would not be cowed by
; foreign pressure.
At the same time, in reply to a
threatening Russian note, the Yu
goslav government offered to settle
all disputes with the Soviet govern
ment in accordance with the inter- j
national obligations the two coun- I
tries have undertaken.
The Yugoslav note also offered to 1
return to Russia all Soviet citizens, i
including those "spies" about whose .
treatment Russia had complained, if j
they desired to return home.
The note was firm and even de
fiant in defending Yugoslav treat
ment of Russians. Its tone was con
ciliatory in offering to repatriate
Russians in Yugoslavia and to set- j
; tie disputes diplomatically. But dip

lomats detected an ironic under
| tone. The Russians referred to are
Czarist refugees and the Kremlin is
not likely to want thousands of
them sent home.
