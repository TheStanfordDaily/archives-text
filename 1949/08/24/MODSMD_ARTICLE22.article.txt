### ED CASWELL 
To walk across the Quad on a
hot and windy afternoon one would
think the Stanford Farm was just a
uiet University set in the brown
California lulls. But the offices of
:he business manager, Alf Brandin,
with their scurry of pencils across
paper, and Eldridge Spencer's Plan
ning Office tell a different story.
Stanford is teeming with tentative
plans for new roads, buildings,
andscaping, and in the meantime is
susy shifting offices and preparing
:or one the largest enrollments in
history.
I.aw School, Stern Hall
The main projects of the summer
have been keeping the new Law
School and the new dormitory,
Stern Hall, on construction sched
ule. Bo f h buildings are progressing
s planned. At present linoleum is
being laid in the rooms at Stern,
final coats of paint are going on
.lallways. and the steam tables in
the serving line of the qommons are
being installed.
The Law School is to be ready for
use by winter quarter provided no
delays occur. Housed in the for
mer Administration Building, the
school will be a complete and sepa
rate unit. The basement level of
the school will include a lounge,
lockers for books, and room for fu
ture stacks and storage.
An air - conditioned, fluorescent
lighted lecture room with single
curved desks extending the length
of the room, will replace the old
marble lobby. The Dean and his
staff will also have offices on the
first floor.
Study Facilities
The first - floor mezzanine in
cludes rpace for graduate research
and consultation, study cubicles, a
reading room, and moot court. On
the second-floor mezzanine a fac
ulty library and conference room
will be situated across the hall from
the professors' offices, and more
stacks will be placed up there.
Now completed is the Linear Ac
celerator Building, and the Organic
Chemistry Building is scheduled to
open in 45 days for the fall quar
ter. Parking and landscaping re
main to be done for the Accelerator
Building, and plastering for the
Chemistry Building.
Spoech Clinic Moved
The speech clinic has been movec'
to new offices in the Knoll, so that
remodeling can take place to ac
commodate the ROTC and the
NROTC on the second story of the
SAC. This will permit student ath
letics to expand its crowded quar
ters on the first floor.
The sewer line on Arguello has
finally been set. but the eruptions
of asphalt and dirt on Galvez will
not be smoothed out again until
about Sent. 23, just in time for the
Harvard game. Engineers expect
the steam to go through on Sept. 15.
Road Work Planned
The road problem light now is a
vital one to the business staff. Bran
din feels that adequate plans for
road development have been con
cluded now. and hopes the tenta
tive plan will soon be presented to
the Board of Trustees for approval.
Layouts for parking areas and a
new perimeter road around Stern.
Toyon, and Encina, would give ad

ditional parking on the corner of
Galvez and Alvarado. Indefinite
plans have been made for the clos
ing of Arguello to traffic and using
it for a service entrance to Stern
and Endna, but no immediate ac
tion is scheduled.
The Village, which has so long
been an eyesore to its inhabitants,
has undergone some refurbishing
this summer in an attempt to make
it "not more permanent, but more
livable," according to Brandin.
Areas formerly separated only by
tin lockers have been partitioned
into living groups of three and four,
and the entire interiors of the
buildings have been repainted.
