# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Open Your Eyes 
### 
Since this is the last Daily to be published this quarter, we feel
:hat this is the time to look over the quarter and see what has been
accomplished at Stanford.
For as long as we can remember we have heard remarks de
riding Stanford as an "Ivory Tower." As we scan this quarter's
issues of The Daily we find evidence to the contrary. To those
who say that students here don't have the opportunity to find
out what's going on in the outside world, we say "open your
eyes."
So far this quarter students have had the chance to hear
qualified speakers on such topics as the United Nations, condi
tions in India, the Philippines, and government spending. The
qualified speakers have been Dr. Ralph Bunche, Madame Pandit,
Elpidio Quirino, and Herbert Hoover.
This array of distinguished speakers would not seem to make
Stanford an "Ivory Tower."
But beyond these outstanding speakers, there have been
many other lecturers on campus this quarter. The Tuesday
Evening Series, Institutes, and guest speakers have all been avail
able to the students this quarter. They only have to take the
lime and energy to go to these lectures.
We are just trying to point out that there are more than
enough opportunities to hear speakers, on both political and
non-political subjects. Summer quarter is an especially good
lime for this. Any number of outstanding visiting professors
come from other universities.
Too often students sit back and wait for the opportunities to
.'earn to come to them, instead of going out and looking for them.
Others are like the legendary cow looking at the greener grass
on the other side of the fence. Both have a negative attitude that
will not get them far.
To those students who ask for more political speakers on
campus, we say "open your eyes" and take advantage of what
Stanford offers rather than presenting purely destructive
criticisms.
