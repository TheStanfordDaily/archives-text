# Double Barrels of Crackers By Will Rogers Play at Park
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Park Theater in Menlo Park
j.- currently showing a revival of
two of Will Rogers' last pictures,
'"Steamboat 'Round the Bend" and
''David Harum."
The first of the two films, which
r.lso includes a few glimpses of the
late Irvin S. Cobb, is a now some
â€¢vhat melodramatic story of two
young lovers, one of whom is about
to be hanged, and the story of how
the hanging was but narrowly
avoided by a steamboat race down
the Mississippi River.
The high spot of the picture in
fact is the race in which the "Clare
more Queen," using everything from
demon rum to a wax works mu
seum as fuel, noses out Cobbs' boat.
' The Pride of Paducah."
During the race, Will tics up "The
Pride" for a night's free tow which
furnishes its own type of laconic
humor. At one point, Will and the
heroine, Anne Shirley, are looking
for a self - styled prophet calling
himself the New Moses. Upon ask
.ng a boat's crew if they have seen
him. they receive the answer, "Hell,
we haven't even seen the old one!"
which when delivered in the show
f .< funny. Will answers in dead pan,

"Well, you ought to have. The
joke's old enough."
The second film is based on an ]
1890 novel detailing the good deeds
and shrewd horse-trading activities
of a bucolic do-good banker from
upstate New York. Set alongside ;
the more "You've got an honest face
but have you a'so got a set of false I
teeth a couple of well fattened kids
and three or four pounds of heart |
for collateral" attitudes of today's
banks, David Harum's propensities
for paying off widows' mortgages
seem a little idealistic.
Otherwise, the movie gives us a
chance to see Kent Taylor and Eve
lyn Venable in their salad days, j
such as they were, exhibits the j
grand old Oklahoma sage in his
best cracker - barrel manner, and j
revolves its story around a trotting j
horse that goes like a bat out of !
hell when someone sings the right
songs.
Will Rogers, as usual, is Will Rog
ers, and when the script writer i
gives him a chance ho comes up i
with such gems as: "A few fleas is
good lor any dog. They keep him (
busy so he won't start thinking |
about being a dog."
