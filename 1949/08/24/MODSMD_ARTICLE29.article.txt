Dear Mr. Koch:
Your reccnt remarks regarding China and American capitalist domina- j
tion is a good example of the fog in which many liberals of the Henry
Wallace-type travel. It is this obscurity which renders.them despondent, i
and not any hopelessness regarding the "world situation," which, his- 1
torically, has always been far from Utopian.
After applying some abstract principles of social justice to American
policy, you proceed to condemn that policy with a devastating sneer,
never bothering to balance our fumbling with the corruption and ques
tionable motives of other nations. You spread your sympathies thin over
the backward areas (technologically) of the world, and spend youi'self in
their quixotic defense.
The Chinese civil war is a specific case in point. Of course, it is tragic
that Chinese people have been killed with American weapons. Just what
rational improvement do you suggest, if any? Shall we support the Com
munists, and let one side do most of the killing? Shall we isolate our- I
selves, stop interfering, just when we are approaching the period when j
we can be of most use to the Chinese people?
It is a difficult problem to resolve. Yet you seem satisfied with indis- '
criminate criticism, never bothering to seek a way out through manipula- ;
tion of political and economic forces as they exist.
Your objections regarding China bring up your whole interpretation
of America's relation to the rest of the world in the twentieth century, j
It would be far preferable if liberals of your general category could live [
with the idea of the "American Century." This is not suggested through
a blind ethnocentrism, as you think. Rather is it a recognition that the j
American nation is the principal power in the world today, and will remain 1
so for some time to come.
It seems impossible to deny the existence or use of this power. More 1
to the point is, how we are going to use it? Since we are a capitalist I
country, our endeavor will unavoidably involve some profit for the capi- :
talists. You may not like that, but the realistic fact should be accepted. I
Working within this framework, how can the liberal best use himself for
his particular goals (e.g. raising the living standards of colonial and semi
colonial areas, and fostering self-government)? Instead of wasting him
self in passionate social diatribes, why not encourage specific policies I
which implement your ideals.
We can send the Chinese (and others) engineers, and experts of all
sorts to help them in building dams and bridges, improving a ruinous
agriculture, integrating the country with modern communications and
transportation, and founding the rudiments of an adequate industry. We
can finance a technical education in the U.S. for many. We can tempo
rarily alleviate part of the widespread food shortage.
By these methods, we can accrue prestige and influence of great value j
and peaceful effect. They should lead to a lessening need for military
bases, and a great inter-cultural assimilation coming from common under
standing and sympathy, and a joint endeavor.

After applying some abstract principles of social justice to American
policy, you proceed to condemn that policy with a devastating sneer,
never bothering to balance our fumbling with the corruption and ques
tionable motives of other nations. You spread your sympathies thin over
the backward areas (technologically) of the world, and spend youi'self in
their quixotic defense.
The Chinese civil war is a specific case in point. Of course, it is tragic
that Chinese people have been killed with American weapons. Just what
rational improvement do you suggest, if any? Shall we support the Com
munists, and let one side do most of the killing? Shall we isolate our- I
selves, stop interfering, just when we are approaching the period when j
we can be of most use to the Chinese people?
It is a difficult problem to resolve. Yet you seem satisfied with indis- '
criminate criticism, never bothering to seek a way out through manipula- ;
tion of political and economic forces as they exist.
Your objections regarding China bring up your whole interpretation
of America's relation to the rest of the world in the twentieth century, j
It would be far preferable if liberals of your general category could live [
with the idea of the "American Century." This is not suggested through
a blind ethnocentrism, as you think. Rather is it a recognition that the j
American nation is the principal power in the world today, and will remain 1
so for some time to come.
It seems impossible to deny the existence or use of this power. More 1
to the point is, how we are going to use it? Since we are a capitalist I
country, our endeavor will unavoidably involve some profit for the capi- :
talists. You may not like that, but the realistic fact should be accepted. I
Working within this framework, how can the liberal best use himself for
his particular goals (e.g. raising the living standards of colonial and semi
colonial areas, and fostering self-government)? Instead of wasting him
self in passionate social diatribes, why not encourage specific policies I
which implement your ideals.
We can send the Chinese (and others) engineers, and experts of all
sorts to help them in building dams and bridges, improving a ruinous
agriculture, integrating the country with modern communications and
transportation, and founding the rudiments of an adequate industry. We
can finance a technical education in the U.S. for many. We can tempo
rarily alleviate part of the widespread food shortage.
By these methods, we can accrue prestige and influence of great value j
and peaceful effect. They should lead to a lessening need for military
bases, and a great inter-cultural assimilation coming from common under
standing and sympathy, and a joint endeavor.

Dyspcptic Distortions
Dear Mr. Koch:
Your reccnt remarks regarding China and American capitalist domina- j
tion is a good example of the fog in which many liberals of the Henry
Wallace-type travel. It is this obscurity which renders.them despondent, i
and not any hopelessness regarding the "world situation," which, his- 1
torically, has always been far from Utopian.
