Political Policy

To the Editor:
As a non-affilirfte of any political party, I think that I share a common
conviction of many students on the Stanford campus that there is a very
real need and place for hearing openly all sides to important issues of
the day.
There can be little doubt in the minds of those who listened to both
Mr. Hoover's and Mr. Quirino's speeches that there were important political,
social, and economic implications within their talks. 1 feel that it was
proper and appropriate that these two men express their convictions openly
and forthrightly.
A good many of us make our mistake in categorizing any speech as j
being entirely political or unpolitical, controversial or nor.-controvcrsial, j
etc., without actually discerning the content of what the man said. It is j
utterly indefensible to classify the scope of any talk on the basis of the
speaker's position in life, past or present, or our subjective feelings toward |
him. Thus, the rule has not only been stretched, but it has been cast j
aside if we think that these last two speakers did not touch the area of
politics.
Fortunately there is still far more than one side to current domestic
and international issues. I would like to hear them all on the same basis
that Mr. Hoover and Mr. Quirino were heard. But above all I believe that
we have to hear and know all sides, else we will fall into the apathetic
state of being unable to know a political speech when we hear one.
