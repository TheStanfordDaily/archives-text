# MYSTERY DEAL
## Mize Goes To Yankees Now 
### 
NEW YORK. Aug. 23 (UP).—
Wonderment of baseball fans
reached a new high today over
the "wheels within wheels" in the
major leagues which permitted a
home run slugger like Johnny Mize
to go to the pennant - contending
New York Yankees at this late
stage in the season.
In order for the first-place Yan
kees to purchase him from the New
York Giants, it meant definitely
that at some time during the past
season every other club in big
league baseball had to say in ef
fect, "We don't want him. we can't
use him, not even for $10,000."
Baseball, many years ago, effected
a ride whereby no trades could be
made after June 15—the regulation
having been designed to prevent
clubs in pennant contention from
raiding teams lower in the ranks
with big offers of cash for players
that would insure the Hag.
However, players may be waived
from one club to another for the
established major league waiver
price of $10,000. But if all of the
clubs in one league waive on a
player's services at that price, he
can then be offered to clubs of the
other league.
They, too. must waive, unless the
player's name has been up previ
ously on inter-league waiver lists.
In the case of Mize, the 36-year
year-old fading home run king of
the National League, he previously
had been offered to American
League teams this season.
This being the case, it was pos
sible for the Giants to sell Mize to
the Yankees at any price they could
get. The terms of the deal went un
announced but were estimated var
iously at from $15,000 to $100,000.
But vvhat the baseball fan—the
guy in the bleacher seat—couldn't
understand was how even a fading
star like Mize could be waived out
from under such bitter pennant
contenders as both the Brooklyn
Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals
without some effort being made to
claim him.
