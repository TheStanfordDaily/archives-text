## The
						Sports Desk Success of Televised Football Will Depend Upon Skill of Cameramen 
### 
Next Monday the practice fields of Stanford will be the scene of a lot j
o! picture-taking. There will be shots of Kerkorian passing, and Fix ;
poised ready to charge across the line. There will be shots of McColl and j
Van Alstyne catching passes. The whole team will come to life again on j
.sensitized paper in newspaper darkrooms.
This is Stanford's year of great expectations. People are waiting for
bi;4 things, and want the pictures of the men who will be doing them. |
Picture taking is nothing new for football teams, of course. Every team j
that is worthy of wearing shoulder pads goes through the same thing on j
the first day of practice.
But it seems somehow that this year's pictures will mean more. And we
are just one of the many who hope they will.
And we do feel like one of the many, too. The tickets for the Cal game, 1
for instance, will never reach the mitts of an eager public. And that j
public seems eager despite television.
The problem of whether or not television would cut down gate receipts i
i-; a big one. It has worried athletic managers quite a bit. When our A 1
Masters signed with Tide Water Associated to televise Stanford's home \
g; mes, he faced the problem squarely. At the present time, not enough
people own television sets to crimp attendance much anyway.
However, ii can be expected that televised football games will make
sales sour for sets. But the success of television football depends upon
the skill of the cameraman and his announcer. Video men have to be even
better artists than radio men do.
Announcers Generally Aren't Too Good
Some of the men announcing football games are bad enough. People
are particular about what a football announcer sounds like. Oftentimes |
they miss an important play, and it is obvious. This is probably one
reason why people would much rather attend one game personally than
listen to 10 on a radio. The same thing could happen to television.
We have seen football games on TV. The announcer who accompanies
the picture must be even sharper than a regular announcer. The watching
audience can see whether or not he is giving them full coverage, anq
whether or not his enthusiasm is genuine.
And the camerman must be on his toes to follow the play. If a newsreel
man misses a play, it can be cut out and one from another camera substi
tuted. or the play can be left out altogether. TV must get everything, as b; |
at the moment.
Although Tide Water Associated men have covered the East-West gamo
once, and several games in the Southland, they are not men with years of
experience.
This doesn't mean they won't do a good job. Not by any means. It is
just to point out that people trust only their own eyes. Watching a game '
on television would be only a second choice at best.
Perhaps the attendance will fall off on rainy days. It usualy does anyway. '
But people will not be forced to miss the game altogether. Most people
will appreciate this. At any rate, television is never going to take the
place of sitting in the stands and cheering the old team on. Most people
feel silly yelling in their own front room. Or even the neighborhood bar.
for that matter.
San Jose Goes to AN ork August 29
Another press release has been delivered to the sports desk. This one
comes from San Jose State. The Spartans begin practice on Aug. 29, the
same as the I'CC. The men of the gold will turn out 57 strong next
Monday, and will have only 10 days to get ready for their first game.
San Jose plays the University of Mexico on Sept. 10. The game will
climax a three-day Admission Day festival in the early California town.
The importance of this is than an untried Stanford team will meet a
squad which has had its baptism under tire on Sept. 17.
On the other hand, the Spartans might feel the strain of tangling with
the boys from Mexico City. We hope they don't fight the Mexican War
all over again.
The Golden Raiders are losing 10 key lettermen from last year's squad.
Among these are Bob PifTerini, Chuck Hughes, Steve O'Meara, and Fred
Lindsey. Ever hear of 'em? Nevertheless, the Staters will miss them,
badly.
Last year the Spartans won nine games and lost three. This year Coach
Bill Hubbard is pessimistic about doing as well. The Spartans have a
rougher schedule this year, and the schedule begins a week ahead of ours.
