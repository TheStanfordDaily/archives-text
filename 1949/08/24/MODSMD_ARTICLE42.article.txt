# 'Means and End' Is Sermon Topic
## 
### 
The final summer quarter service
of worship in the Memorial Church
will be held this Sunday when
Chaplain Johnston preaches on "The
Means and the End."
The service, which will mark the
temporary closing of the church for
its annual cleaning, will include
two solos by Joel Carter of the Palo
Alto Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Nanney will be organist but
the regular choir will not be heard,
since many members have already
left the campus.
Church services will begin again
with Freshman Sunday on Sept. 25.
The church office in the vestry will
remain open for the convenience of
visitors.
Mimeographed copies of "The
Means cnd the End" and the Aug.
21 sermon. "Blessed Are the Meek,"
will be available on Sundav.
