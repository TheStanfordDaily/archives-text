# A 						Camel Passes Thru a Needle Eye
## 
### 
Rich men will now stand a better
chance of making it into Heaven,
due to the passing of a camel
through the eyes of five needles on
Monday afternoon.
The camel was made of steel, to
be sure, and the needles of stone,
but the Biblical prophecy now
should not be so disheartening to
prospective capitalists.
The camel in this case was a
multi-ton steam shovel needed to
dig a sewer trench for the new Law
School quarters on the Quad. The
needle eyes were archways through
which the workers had to pass to
reach the rear of the old Adminis
tration Building.
Workers threaded the shovel with
its 20-foot derrick through the five
stone archways from the rear of the
Quad to the construction without
an error in their aim.
When the digging is done, they
will once again attempt to repu
diate the Scriptures, by uncanceling
the needles' eyes.
