Hey, FROSH How's Your Econ ....
National Campus Club
First Question: WHAT IS IT?
Founded at Stanford, by Stanford students, it is the home base of a growing national
organization, designed to keep dollars in student pocketbooks. It was once called the
Campus Auto Club, because it gave students savings at gas stations and garages. Now it
has expanded to include all the businesses below.
Second Question: HOW DOES IT WORK?
Members present their cards when paying for merchandise or service, and receive their discounts. The mer
chant can give lower prices because his volume of business is greater. Stanford students conserve cash. NCC
members keep their money in barrels. Ask the person with a card.
Third Question: HOW CAN I SAVE?
