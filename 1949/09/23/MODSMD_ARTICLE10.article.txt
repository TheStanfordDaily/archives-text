# Cards Host Harvard Gridders Tomorrow
## Over 45,000 Expected to View First Football Game Between Two Schools 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
For the first time in the his- ;
tory of the two universities, j
Stanford and Harvard will tan
gle on a football field when
they meet in a rare PCC-Ivy
League intersectional contest in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow aftcr
at 2:30.
For the Indians it will be the first
of four out of five contests with a
single wing team. It will also be the
first real test of Coach Marchie
Schwartz' 1940 Big Red Machine.
Last week the Redmen trampled a
weak San Jose State team 40 to 0.
Schwartz is still wondering if the
Indians were "that good or the Spar
tans that poor."
Observers at the first three days
of practice this week came away
with the impression that Schwartz
had decided to forget, the San Jose
State game and start all over again.
Rather than getting the usual easy
Monday workout, the Card griddcrs
found themselves going through a
rough two - houi - long scrimmage.
Again on Tuesday and Wednesday
Schwartz pitted the varsity, frosh.
and junior varsity "Harvard team"
against each other in a merry-go
round of rock - and - sock scrim
mages.
Schwartz is more than a little
worried over the outcome of to
morrow's single wing versus T-for
mation contest. Stanford, the home
I of the modern collegiate T-forma-
I tion, hasn't met a single wing team
. since that disastrous day in 1047
when the Indians foil before the on
slaught of a great Michigan team.

Tomorrow It will be Arthur Val
pey, an assistant coach under Mich
igan's Fritz Crislcr in 1047 and a
firm believer in the spinning full
back style of single wing play, who
will coach the Crimson double
teaming line and bevy of fast backs.
Schwartz has decided to stick
with last week's starting lineup
which contained Bill McColl and
Ken Rose at ends, A 1 Rau and Gor
don White at tackles, Don Fix and
Jesse Cone at guards, and Jim Cas
tagnoli ai center. The baekfield of
Tom Shaw, Harry Hugasian, Bob
White, and Bill DcYoung will go
again for the Reds.
Last week's high temperature
forced Schwartz into a platoon type
of substitution that most fans
praised a.-, becoming for a team of
great depth and ability.
But the Card mentor knows, as do
most close fans, that the Stanford
depth leaves u lot to be desired. He
has said that he will stick with such
as Gordon White on offense as well
as defense. Last week's game was
the first scrimmage work since
spring for the big tackle. He had
been ruled out for the year because
of a spinal injury but had returned
to the Farm ihe week before the
San Jose game.
In the event of high temperatures
again tomorrow, Schwartz may well
turn to substituting seven to eight
men every time the ball changes
hands. He found some fine defen
sive materia! in sophomore end Jack
Kye, taekle Ha! Weaver, guard Russ
Pomeroy, as well as in veterans
Dave Field and Ken Peck.
MITCH IS SOLID
Another big morale booster was
the return of Mr. Fullback himself,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch turned up
at the early practices and took his
turn at quarterback. A week before
the first game he transferred back
to his old fullback position and
looks to be the Mitchell of old.
He carried the ball three times
against the Spartans and scored two
first downs and a touchdown. Great
as was that performance, his great
est use is still in his ability to clear
the way for his teammates via
booming blocks. He will undoubt
edly see much action tomorrow af
ternoon.
Schwartz expressed his satisfac
tion over the performances of his
three soph quarterbacks. Gary
Kerkoriun took over the team in
the second quarter and promptly
scored a touchdown. But, over and
above this feat, he did not fumble
in his debut. Brother sophs Dick
Horn and Jack Bickie performed al
most as well in their first varsity
game.
As well as these sophs and others
did perform in their first varsity
game, they will be meeting sterner
stuff tomorrow.
HOUSTON IS GOOD
Harvard boasts one of the two
All-American lackles chosen in a
national magazine. He is Captain
Howard Houston. Next week the
Indians meet the other, 33-year-old
Al Wisert, captain of the Michigan
team.
And after all is said and done
about the San Jose State game, the
fact rem lins that the Cards could
score but 13 points in the first half.
Ihe Harvard team arrived Wednes
day night and is quartered at the
Hearst Ranch at Pleasanton. They 1
will turn out in the Stadium at 2:30 '
this afternoon.
Art Valpey. who personally scout
ed the Card-San Jose State game
last week, said that he thought his
team could match the Indians in ma
terial but not conditioning. He
I
blamed cold weather in Cambridge |
for the "20 per cent difference in
conditioning between the two j
teams."
Valpey said that he thought that .
Marchie had a well-organized outfit
but that "the writers have over- '
played his material his boys aren't
that good."
Betting odds on the game have

not been well publicized but a local
belting sheet has established the ■
Cards as 14-point favorites. it will

HOUSTON IS GOOD
Harvard boasts one of the two
All-American lackles chosen in a
national magazine. He is Captain
Howard Houston. Next week the
Indians meet the other, 33-year-old
Al Wisert, captain of the Michigan
team.
And after all is said and done
about the San Jose State game, the
fact rem lins that the Cards could
score but 13 points in the first half.
Ihe Harvard team arrived Wednes
day night and is quartered at the
Hearst Ranch at Pleasanton. They 1
will turn out in the Stadium at 2:30 '
this afternoon.
Art Valpey. who personally scout
ed the Card-San Jose State game
last week, said that he thought his
team could match the Indians in ma
terial but not conditioning. He
I
blamed cold weather in Cambridge |
for the "20 per cent difference in
conditioning between the two j
teams."
Valpey said that he thought that .
Marchie had a well-organized outfit
but that "the writers have over- '
played his material his boys aren't
that good."

not been well publicized but a local
belting sheet has established the ■

For the first time in the his- ;
tory of the two universities, j
Stanford and Harvard will tan
gle on a football field when
they meet in a rare PCC-Ivy
League intersectional contest in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow aftcr
at 2:30.
For the Indians it will be the first
of four out of five contests with a
single wing team. It will also be the
first real test of Coach Marchie
Schwartz' 1940 Big Red Machine.
Last week the Redmen trampled a
weak San Jose State team 40 to 0.
Schwartz is still wondering if the
Indians were "that good or the Spar
tans that poor."
Observers at the first three days
of practice this week came away
with the impression that Schwartz
had decided to forget, the San Jose
State game and start all over again.
Rather than getting the usual easy
Monday workout, the Card griddcrs
found themselves going through a
rough two - houi - long scrimmage.
Again on Tuesday and Wednesday
Schwartz pitted the varsity, frosh.
and junior varsity "Harvard team"
against each other in a merry-go
round of rock - and - sock scrim
mages.
Schwartz is more than a little
worried over the outcome of to
morrow's single wing versus T-for
mation contest. Stanford, the home
I of the modern collegiate T-forma-
I tion, hasn't met a single wing team
. since that disastrous day in 1047
when the Indians foil before the on
slaught of a great Michigan team.

Tomorrow It will be Arthur Val
pey, an assistant coach under Mich
igan's Fritz Crislcr in 1047 and a
firm believer in the spinning full
back style of single wing play, who
will coach the Crimson double
teaming line and bevy of fast backs.
Schwartz has decided to stick
with last week's starting lineup
which contained Bill McColl and
Ken Rose at ends, A 1 Rau and Gor
don White at tackles, Don Fix and
Jesse Cone at guards, and Jim Cas
tagnoli ai center. The baekfield of
Tom Shaw, Harry Hugasian, Bob
White, and Bill DcYoung will go
again for the Reds.
Last week's high temperature
forced Schwartz into a platoon type
of substitution that most fans
praised a.-, becoming for a team of
great depth and ability.
But the Card mentor knows, as do
most close fans, that the Stanford
depth leaves u lot to be desired. He
has said that he will stick with such
as Gordon White on offense as well
as defense. Last week's game was
the first scrimmage work since
spring for the big tackle. He had
been ruled out for the year because
of a spinal injury but had returned
to the Farm ihe week before the
San Jose game.
In the event of high temperatures
again tomorrow, Schwartz may well
turn to substituting seven to eight
men every time the ball changes
hands. He found some fine defen
sive materia! in sophomore end Jack
Kye, taekle Ha! Weaver, guard Russ
Pomeroy, as well as in veterans
Dave Field and Ken Peck.
MITCH IS SOLID
Another big morale booster was
the return of Mr. Fullback himself,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch turned up
at the early practices and took his
turn at quarterback. A week before
the first game he transferred back
to his old fullback position and
looks to be the Mitchell of old.
He carried the ball three times
against the Spartans and scored two
first downs and a touchdown. Great
as was that performance, his great
est use is still in his ability to clear
the way for his teammates via
booming blocks. He will undoubt
edly see much action tomorrow af
ternoon.
Schwartz expressed his satisfac
tion over the performances of his
three soph quarterbacks. Gary
Kerkoriun took over the team in
the second quarter and promptly
scored a touchdown. But, over and
above this feat, he did not fumble
in his debut. Brother sophs Dick

tory of the two universities, j
Stanford and Harvard will tan
gle on a football field when
they meet in a rare PCC-Ivy
League intersectional contest in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow aftcr
at 2:30.
For the Indians it will be the first
of four out of five contests with a
single wing team. It will also be the
first real test of Coach Marchie
Schwartz' 1940 Big Red Machine.
Last week the Redmen trampled a
weak San Jose State team 40 to 0.
Schwartz is still wondering if the
Indians were "that good or the Spar
tans that poor."
Observers at the first three days
of practice this week came away
with the impression that Schwartz
had decided to forget, the San Jose
State game and start all over again.
Rather than getting the usual easy
Monday workout, the Card griddcrs
found themselves going through a
rough two - houi - long scrimmage.
Again on Tuesday and Wednesday
Schwartz pitted the varsity, frosh.
and junior varsity "Harvard team"
against each other in a merry-go
round of rock - and - sock scrim
mages.
Schwartz is more than a little
worried over the outcome of to
morrow's single wing versus T-for
mation contest. Stanford, the home
I of the modern collegiate T-forma-
I tion, hasn't met a single wing team
. since that disastrous day in 1047
when the Indians foil before the on
slaught of a great Michigan team.

Tomorrow It will be Arthur Val
pey, an assistant coach under Mich
igan's Fritz Crislcr in 1047 and a
firm believer in the spinning full
back style of single wing play, who
will coach the Crimson double
teaming line and bevy of fast backs.
Schwartz has decided to stick
with last week's starting lineup
which contained Bill McColl and
Ken Rose at ends, A 1 Rau and Gor
don White at tackles, Don Fix and
Jesse Cone at guards, and Jim Cas
tagnoli ai center. The baekfield of
Tom Shaw, Harry Hugasian, Bob
White, and Bill DcYoung will go
again for the Reds.
Last week's high temperature
forced Schwartz into a platoon type
of substitution that most fans
praised a.-, becoming for a team of
great depth and ability.
But the Card mentor knows, as do
most close fans, that the Stanford
depth leaves u lot to be desired. He
has said that he will stick with such
as Gordon White on offense as well
as defense. Last week's game was
the first scrimmage work since
spring for the big tackle. He had
been ruled out for the year because
of a spinal injury but had returned
to the Farm ihe week before the
San Jose game.
In the event of high temperatures
again tomorrow, Schwartz may well
turn to substituting seven to eight
men every time the ball changes
hands. He found some fine defen
sive materia! in sophomore end Jack
Kye, taekle Ha! Weaver, guard Russ
Pomeroy, as well as in veterans
Dave Field and Ken Peck.
MITCH IS SOLID
Another big morale booster was
the return of Mr. Fullback himself,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch turned up
at the early practices and took his
turn at quarterback. A week before
the first game he transferred back
to his old fullback position and
looks to be the Mitchell of old.
He carried the ball three times
against the Spartans and scored two
first downs and a touchdown. Great
as was that performance, his great
est use is still in his ability to clear
the way for his teammates via
booming blocks. He will undoubt
edly see much action tomorrow af
ternoon.
Schwartz expressed his satisfac
tion over the performances of his
three soph quarterbacks. Gary
Kerkoriun took over the team in
the second quarter and promptly
scored a touchdown. But, over and
above this feat, he did not fumble
in his debut. Brother sophs Dick
Horn and Jack Bickie performed al
most as well in their first varsity
game.
As well as these sophs and others
did perform in their first varsity
game, they will be meeting sterner
stuff tomorrow.
HOUSTON IS GOOD
Harvard boasts one of the two
All-American lackles chosen in a
national magazine. He is Captain
Howard Houston. Next week the
Indians meet the other, 33-year-old
Al Wisert, captain of the Michigan
team.
And after all is said and done
about the San Jose State game, the
fact rem lins that the Cards could
score but 13 points in the first half.
Ihe Harvard team arrived Wednes
day night and is quartered at the
Hearst Ranch at Pleasanton. They 1
will turn out in the Stadium at 2:30 '
this afternoon.
Art Valpey. who personally scout
ed the Card-San Jose State game
last week, said that he thought his
team could match the Indians in ma
terial but not conditioning. He
I
blamed cold weather in Cambridge |
for the "20 per cent difference in
conditioning between the two j
teams."
Valpey said that he thought that .
Marchie had a well-organized outfit
but that "the writers have over- '
played his material his boys aren't
that good."
Betting odds on the game have

not been well publicized but a local
belting sheet has established the ■
Cards as 14-point favorites. it will
