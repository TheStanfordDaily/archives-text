# Cards Host Harvard Gridders Tomorrow
## Over 45,000 Expected to View First Football Game Between Two Schools 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
For the first time in the his- ;
tory of the two universities, j
Stanford and Harvard will tan
gle on a football field when
they meet in a rare PCC-Ivy
League intersectional contest in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow aftcr
at 2:30.
For the Indians it will be the first
of four out of five contests with a
single wing team. It will also be the
first real test of Coach Marchie
Schwartz' 1940 Big Red Machine.
Last week the Redmen trampled a
weak San Jose State team 40 to 0.
Schwartz is still wondering if the
Indians were "that good or the Spar
tans that poor."
Observers at the first three days
of practice this week came away
with the impression that Schwartz
had decided to forget, the San Jose
State game and start all over again.
Rather than getting the usual easy
Monday workout, the Card griddcrs
found themselves going through a
rough two - houi - long scrimmage.
Again on Tuesday and Wednesday
Schwartz pitted the varsity, frosh.
and junior varsity "Harvard team"
against each other in a merry-go
round of rock - and - sock scrim
mages.
Schwartz is more than a little
worried over the outcome of to
morrow's single wing versus T-for
mation contest. Stanford, the home
I of the modern collegiate T-forma-
I tion, hasn't met a single wing team
. since that disastrous day in 1047
when the Indians foil before the on
slaught of a great Michigan team.

Tomorrow It will be Arthur Val
pey, an assistant coach under Mich
igan's Fritz Crislcr in 1047 and a
firm believer in the spinning full
back style of single wing play, who
will coach the Crimson double
teaming line and bevy of fast backs.
Schwartz has decided to stick
with last week's starting lineup
which contained Bill McColl and
Ken Rose at ends, A 1 Rau and Gor
don White at tackles, Don Fix and
Jesse Cone at guards, and Jim Cas
tagnoli ai center. The baekfield of
Tom Shaw, Harry Hugasian, Bob
White, and Bill DcYoung will go
again for the Reds.
Last week's high temperature
forced Schwartz into a platoon type
of substitution that most fans
