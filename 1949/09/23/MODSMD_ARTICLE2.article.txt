I.OS ANGELES â€” Four hundred
members of the University of Cali
fornia faculties at Los Angeles, La
Jolla, and Riverside today indicated
disapproval of that part of their

with the principles of the loyalty
oath but do not like the form it
takes. "'They believe it should be
voluntary, not compulsory," he said.
