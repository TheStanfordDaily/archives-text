Students should not leave val
uables openly lying around their
rooms, Stanford Police Chief Gor
don R. Davis warned yesterday.
Rooms should be locked whenever
possible.
Living groups, particularly fra
ternities, have been subject to
numerous early-morning robber

beries have taken place early in
the quarter, and the University of
California has already reported
one robbery this fall.
