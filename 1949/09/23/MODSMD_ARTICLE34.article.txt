# It's Stanford for You
## 
### 
Hello '53! The Daily is happy to be among
the first to welcome you to the Stanford Fam
ily.
As members of the incoming freshman class
you are about to begin a new phase in your
life. On the Farm you will make new friends,
1 ave new experiences, be exposed to new
ideas.
You will find Stanford a good place to have
fun, but you must work hard too. For Stanford
is primarily an academic institution of high
standards and as a member of the student
body you will assume certain responsibilities
to yourself, to your fellow students, and to
the (Jniversily.
You will find an unusual atmosphere of
friendliness hero on the Farm, made possible
by Stanford's limited size, its many traditions,
and by an unexplainable something that you
will know at first only as the "Stanford Spirit."
This "Stanford Spirit" is a nebulous term
which will come to mean more and more to
you as your undergraduate years progress.
Although your first week at Stanford has
been preceded by hours of hard work on the
part of University and student officials whose
[irst interest is to see that your preregistration
program runs smoothly, things are bound to
seem a bit confused here at first. There will be

lines to stand in for housing, registration, and
orientation, and your first impression of Stan
ford is apt to be that it's just a place where you
"hurry up and wait."
But don't be impatient. In a program of such
magnitude there can't help but be a few un
foreseen hitches. Everything will straighten
out in a day or two, and when you look back
it won't seem "half bad."
Feel free to discuss any problems you might
have with your sponsors. They're anxious to
help you. After all, that's what they're here
for.
As for activities, Stanford's got 'em. The
ASSU prints its own daily newspaper, humor
magazine, and yearbook. There are openings
in dramatics, athletics, and student govern
ment varied enough to inteerst every student.
The important thing is to get started right
away. There is no better way to make new
friends and to become a part of what's going
on than through activities.
But choose carefully. Don't bite off more
than you can chew. Studies take some time
too, you know, and nobody likes a "joiner"—
the person who spreads himself out so thin he
can't be an effective worker in any of his ac
tivities.
The facilities of the Stanford campus are at
your disposal. Take full advantage of them!

help you. After all, that's what they're here
for.
As for activities, Stanford's got 'em. The
ASSU prints its own daily newspaper, humor
magazine, and yearbook. There are openings
in dramatics, athletics, and student govern
ment varied enough to inteerst every student.
The important thing is to get started right
away. There is no better way to make new
friends and to become a part of what's going
on than through activities.
But choose carefully. Don't bite off more
than you can chew. Studies take some time
too, you know, and nobody likes a "joiner"—
the person who spreads himself out so thin he
can't be an effective worker in any of his ac
tivities.

Hello '53! The Daily is happy to be among
the first to welcome you to the Stanford Fam
ily.
As members of the incoming freshman class
you are about to begin a new phase in your
life. On the Farm you will make new friends,
1 ave new experiences, be exposed to new
ideas.
You will find Stanford a good place to have
fun, but you must work hard too. For Stanford
is primarily an academic institution of high
standards and as a member of the student
body you will assume certain responsibilities
to yourself, to your fellow students, and to
the (Jniversily.
You will find an unusual atmosphere of
friendliness hero on the Farm, made possible
by Stanford's limited size, its many traditions,
and by an unexplainable something that you
will know at first only as the "Stanford Spirit."
This "Stanford Spirit" is a nebulous term
which will come to mean more and more to
you as your undergraduate years progress.
Although your first week at Stanford has
been preceded by hours of hard work on the
part of University and student officials whose
[irst interest is to see that your preregistration
program runs smoothly, things are bound to
seem a bit confused here at first. There will be

lines to stand in for housing, registration, and
orientation, and your first impression of Stan
ford is apt to be that it's just a place where you
"hurry up and wait."
But don't be impatient. In a program of such
magnitude there can't help but be a few un
foreseen hitches. Everything will straighten
out in a day or two, and when you look back
it won't seem "half bad."
Feel free to discuss any problems you might
have with your sponsors. They're anxious to
help you. After all, that's what they're here
for.
