To 112 at into the spirit of things,

writing to you bccausc somehow I must have
overshot my checkbook and need an extra couple
of bucks.

getting ready to take a tour of all the scenic
and historic spots on campus, such as Rossotti's,
(\irlun's, Dinah's, Stanford Chapel, The Zombie Hut,
The Band Box, and Hoover Libe.
now in the Post Office where I have spent the
last hour and twenty minutes trying to work the com
bination to my box. Thanks for the check which I
am sure is in the letter I'm trying to unlock.
in my new room in (Roble) (Encina). My
roommate just arrived. I'll greet (him) (her) after
1 finish this letter. I would do it now, but (he) (she)
is from Los Angeles.
I ARRIVED
safely, but I need an extra couple of bucks to
i.ot things in order.

i" time to catch my roommate making a thief SelK j an cxtra coup | c 0 f bucks
ol (himself) (herself) over my toothpaste and shoe
polish. Thanks.

last night and went for a ride down El Camino
Real. Somehow, I think Junipero Serra would have
enjoyed the trip a little more these days—especially
if he saw Slim and Bcrnice.
but as yet I'm unimpressed. However, tonight
I'm going to a football rally, and they say Rally Com
is really a laugh. I like to laugh.
I WONDER
if you would mind sending an extra couple of
bucks.
why we have to go through this super-charged
welcoming program. Aren't they sure that my 200
slugs are already as good as in the till, that A 1 Mas
ters has my $1.20 for the Harvard game, and that just
plain old Stanford is good enough for me?
how tough Minnesota will be in the Rose Bowl.
(This spot shouldn't be checked unless your are Bill
Leiser, Russ Newland, or an optimistic football fan.)
if the (girls) (roughs) are really (ugly) (rug
ged ).
DON'T WORRY
I'll be okay as soon as you send the couple of
extra bucks.
I've already been warned about contributing
my last dollar to Stanford Crew.
somebody gave me the word on how to act
when the bell rings at Dinah's.
I'll know more about this place after the Mich
igan game. Furthci details will follow in my next
letter—next quarter.
P.S.
