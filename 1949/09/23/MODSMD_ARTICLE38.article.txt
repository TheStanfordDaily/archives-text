Recent developments in electron
ics techniques devised by European
engineers will be surveyed for the
U.S. government by Dr. Cledo Bru
netti and Dr. Jtrre D. Noe of Stan
ford Research Institute.
The SRI scientists left yesterday
morning from San Francisco Air
port by United Airlines to spend

several days in Washington, D.C.,
conferring with government author
ities before continuing to England.
Their findings will be used as part
of a program for adapting the latest
ideas in electronics to the design of
government equipment.
Dr. Brunetti, former chief of en
gineering electronics at the Na
tional Bureau of Standards, is asso
ciate director of Stanford Research
Institute. In commenting on his trip
yesterday, lie said: "While the
United States has taken the leader
ship in the development of printed
circuits and miniature electronic
equipment, the British have come
up with some ingenious new ideas.
One embodies automatic equipment,
that will turn out a complete radio
every 20 seconds. Another is a
printing process that produces elec
tronic circuits of high quality on
paper."
Dr. Noe, an electronic research
engineer, spent more than a year
during the war at Malvern, England,
as a member of the staff of the
American - British Laboratory, a
branch of the Radio Research Labo
ratory of Harvard University.
