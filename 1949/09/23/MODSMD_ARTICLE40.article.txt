# Administration Officials Greet Frosh
## 
### 
As a freshman on Dean Kimpton's
staff there is reason to question, af
ter a short six weeks here, the va
lidity of any over-zealous "welcome
back" or "welcome to Stanford."
To the initiated members of the
Stanford Family, I look forward to
working with you and learning from
you the complete meaning of a
Stanford education. Bluntly, I am
glad to be here.
To the Class of '53—the freshmen,
I offer this conviction. There are
few universities in the land where
the warm and friendly greeting you
have so recently received lasts as it
does at your chosen Alma Mater.
Accept this sincere greeting and be
come a part of the most devoted
student" and alumni body it has ever
been my pleasure to meet—joining
the "Stanford Spirit" is not a con
scious endeavor, it just happens.
You have the chance many others
have been denied. Avail yourself
of the many and varied opportuni
ties for learning.

For the entire Dean of Students'
staff, I wish to extend a hearty wel
come to the new entering students
at Stanford. The competition for ad
mission has been unusually keen
this year and we congratulate you
upon being here.
It is our job to help you receive
the greatest possible benefit from
your educational experience at
Stanford. Please call on us for any
assistance that we can give you.

It is a pleasure to welcome to
Stanford the Class of 1953, and to
extend that welcome most cordially
to other new students. I wish for
each of you a year of great achieve
ment not unmixed with the excite
ment that appropriately attends a

full and healthy campus life

You bring much to the University,
otherwise you would not be here;
and the University has much to offer
you. We must see to it that none of
us misses his opportunity to add
luster to Stanford's name.
