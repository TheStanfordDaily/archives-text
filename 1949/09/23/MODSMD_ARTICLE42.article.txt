# Farm Expands Firehouse as New Red Wagon Joins Water-Shooting Fleet
## 
### 
Rather than leave their new 1,000-
gallon tank truck at the mercy of
Ihe fabulous California sunshine, the
Stanford firemen are now making a
major expansion of the firehouse.
Since garage space on the west
side of the building was far too
short, the department is now laying
a floor over the old cement vault
back of the former space.
Knocking down walls so that the

glitter of the new engine will not be
lost to future Farm generations, the
hose and axe men have achieved a
new high in large-scale cross ven
tilation, unparalleled since the days
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The new tanker, which can now
be seen parked across Ihe street
from the Santa Teresa-Street fire
house awaiting completion of the
operation, will be the biggest such
piece of equipment in the history of
the department.
In addition to its 1,000 - gallon
tank, it carries two pumps, a high
pressure job on the rear and a 50-
gallon-per-minute one on the front.
It will carry about 800 feet of 2 1 Â£-
inch hose, 600 feet of l'/fe-inch, and
600 feet of 1-inch forestry hose.
