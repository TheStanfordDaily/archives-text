# Card Stunts Set For Harvard Tiff
## 
### 
Card stunts have been planned
for tomorrow's football game, Gor
don Luce, chairman, announced,
The rooting section will be di
vided, with men and women sitting
separately, he added. A smaller sec
tion than usual will do card stunts,
and there will be fewer stunts, since
time has not allowed elaborate plan
ning, Luce said.
New metallic cards, which have
been purchased by Rally Commit
tee, will be used tomorrow. Stu
dents are urged by Rally Com not to
throw the cards around after the
stunts, since these cards must be
used all season.
The new duck-billed rooters' caps
will sell at $1 each at the game.
Pom-poms will cost 25 cents.
