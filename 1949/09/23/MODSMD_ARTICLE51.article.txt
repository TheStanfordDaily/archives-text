### AL BERRY 
W. C. Fields is one of the
immortals of American humor
along with Irving S. Cobb, Har
old Lloyd, and Will Rogers. If
anyone is interested in immor
tality, a glimpse of Mr. Fields
is currently being screened by
the very kind management of
the Park Theater.

and laugh at Fields again.
"The Bank Dick" is listed as the
number one feature and it is a small
Fieldsian riot from start to finish,
but most movie-goers will be in

which co-stars the old master with
one Mae West. Chickadee is doubly
enlightening because it where

script for the Hope-Russell stinker

have any more to offer the audience
than Jane Russell did, but Miss
West is considerably more generous
with it.
You can do considerably worse on
an evening than viewing these two
