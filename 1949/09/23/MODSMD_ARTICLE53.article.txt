Jli Frosh! In this, the fust edition of the 1949 Stanford D;iily, we try
to fi I you in on the past history of the Farm, its students and its iaeulty,
as well as giving you registration information.
So let me here give you a brief rundown on the Stanford football pic
ture. li can't be complete here in this column. Too much has gone by
the boards since the Sons of the Stanford Red first embarked on what
is known today as American football.
Stanford has won 23G, lost 102 and tied 110 games since 'hat day in
1K!)I when Walter Camp fielded a team that *vas to win three and lose
one game.
Since that time the Big Red Machine has participated in eight Rose
Howl contests and has placed 14 men on the different All-American teams.
But it is not my purpose here to dv. ell upon the past glories. Let's take
a look at the record since Stanford resumed ' jotball alter a three-year
lay-oil' caused by the war.
Just Now Celling Hack Inlo the Race
We got back in the football wars a year later than most of our Pacific
Coast Conference brethren. The- 194 ft squad won G, lost 3 and tied 1. That
team could have been 100 per cent better with the addition of a capable
quarterback. We had no freshman team that year.
The season of 1947 will live to be one of the most famous. That was
the year we playeu nine games and lost nine. Yet the lamed Stanford
Spirit was never more evident. You who now enter Stanford may never
see this intangible something we call the Stanford Spirit.
It isn't a hubba-hubba type of spirit. Rather it is something that will
carry a team, and a student body, through an eight-game losing streak up
to the last, game, that against their arch-foe, the University of California.
Then, though th'>y were underdogs by 2U points against a team that had
lost but one game, they went on to play that Cal team oIT its feet only
to lose in the last three minutes of the game, 21 to 18. We missed three
conversion tries.
112 say that you men and women of 1953 may never,see this spirit as we
of '48, '49 and '50 saw it. We saw it come out in defeat, indeed, constant
defeat. Any school can show fiyht when it has a winning team, but the
unbeatable spirit comes out best when you have been beaten. Strange
.'is it may sound.
Three Years Later . . . Now Wlial—
But on with the story. The 1948 squad won four and lost six. Two of
those losses were by one-point margins against our most bitter loes, USC
and Cal. We scored as many touchdowns but we didn't convert. For the
third year in a row our quarterbacking failed us. And without a good
quarterback the T-l'ormation doesn't go fur.
And that brings us up to the 1949 season. Last week we beat a pitifully
weak San Jose State team, 49 to 0. It could have been much worse. We
can't tit in in another performance like that ail this year if we are to con
tinue on the winning road. The rest of the schedule just will riot allow it.
Bui after discounting first-game jitters, the silver lining can be seen,
though maybe not in the next two weeks against the likes of Harvard and
Michigan.
Stanford be on the brink of one of its best seasons in many
years. We will know more about that after meeting some fust-class com
petition.
Why does the 1949 picture look so bright? Freshman teams are the
answers. The 1947 and '48 teams were undefeated. The '47 outfit squeaked
through in more than one instance; but the '48 frosh team v/on going away
more often than not. Those team members are now sophs and juniors.
Look over the lineup and note the number of important players who have
been drawn from those teams.
Now it is up to you, the men of '53, to carry on. You will be the
varsity members of the football teams to come. You have a very difficult
record to uphold.
Your predecessors have been undefeated in ten straight games. What
is more, they have kept alive that which we are proud to call the Stanford
Spirit. It is not an easy challenge to accept. Are you up to it?

the year we playeu nine games and lost nine. Yet the lamed Stanford
Spirit was never more evident. You who now enter Stanford may never
see this intangible something we call the Stanford Spirit.
It isn't a hubba-hubba type of spirit. Rather it is something that will
carry a team, and a student body, through an eight-game losing streak up
to the last, game, that against their arch-foe, the University of California.
Then, though th'>y were underdogs by 2U points against a team that had
lost but one game, they went on to play that Cal team oIT its feet only
to lose in the last three minutes of the game, 21 to 18. We missed three
conversion tries.
112 say that you men and women of 1953 may never,see this spirit as we
of '48, '49 and '50 saw it. We saw it come out in defeat, indeed, constant
defeat. Any school can show fiyht when it has a winning team, but the
unbeatable spirit comes out best when you have been beaten. Strange
.'is it may sound.
Three Years Later . . . Now Wlial—
But on with the story. The 1948 squad won four and lost six. Two of
those losses were by one-point margins against our most bitter loes, USC
and Cal. We scored as many touchdowns but we didn't convert. For the
third year in a row our quarterbacking failed us. And without a good
quarterback the T-l'ormation doesn't go fur.
And that brings us up to the 1949 season. Last week we beat a pitifully
weak San Jose State team, 49 to 0. It could have been much worse. We
can't tit in in another performance like that ail this year if we are to con
tinue on the winning road. The rest of the schedule just will riot allow it.
Bui after discounting first-game jitters, the silver lining can be seen,
though maybe not in the next two weeks against the likes of Harvard and
Michigan.
Stanford be on the brink of one of its best seasons in many
years. We will know more about that after meeting some fust-class com
petition.
Why does the 1949 picture look so bright? Freshman teams are the
answers. The 1947 and '48 teams were undefeated. The '47 outfit squeaked
through in more than one instance; but the '48 frosh team v/on going away
more often than not. Those team members are now sophs and juniors.
Look over the lineup and note the number of important players who have
been drawn from those teams.
Now it is up to you, the men of '53, to carry on. You will be the
varsity members of the football teams to come. You have a very difficult
record to uphold.
Your predecessors have been undefeated in ten straight games. What
is more, they have kept alive that which we are proud to call the Stanford
Spirit. It is not an easy challenge to accept. Are you up to it?

Jli Frosh! In this, the fust edition of the 1949 Stanford D;iily, we try
to fi I you in on the past history of the Farm, its students and its iaeulty,
as well as giving you registration information.
So let me here give you a brief rundown on the Stanford football pic
ture. li can't be complete here in this column. Too much has gone by
the boards since the Sons of the Stanford Red first embarked on what
is known today as American football.
Stanford has won 23G, lost 102 and tied 110 games since 'hat day in
1K!)I when Walter Camp fielded a team that *vas to win three and lose
one game.
Since that time the Big Red Machine has participated in eight Rose
Howl contests and has placed 14 men on the different All-American teams.
But it is not my purpose here to dv. ell upon the past glories. Let's take
a look at the record since Stanford resumed ' jotball alter a three-year
lay-oil' caused by the war.

We got back in the football wars a year later than most of our Pacific
Coast Conference brethren. The- 194 ft squad won G, lost 3 and tied 1. That
team could have been 100 per cent better with the addition of a capable
quarterback. We had no freshman team that year.
The season of 1947 will live to be one of the most famous. That was
the year we playeu nine games and lost nine. Yet the lamed Stanford
Spirit was never more evident. You who now enter Stanford may never
