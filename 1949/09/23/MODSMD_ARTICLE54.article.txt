## 
### 
While most Stanford students
wore entering the last month of
their summer vacations, some 80
gridders, varsity and frosh, were
hard at. work preparing themselves
for the coming season.
Coach Marchie Schwartz had a
few early worries but most of them
have since cleared themselves up.
The first and most serious blow to
fall upon the team was the an
nouncement. that first-string tackle
Gordon White would have to fore
go the rest of his football years be
cause of a spinal injury suffered
during spring practice.
White went to his home in Texas
for a check-up by his family doctor
and that gentleman (God bless him)
gave him the OK to play. The big
follow returned to the campus in
time to play in the San Jose State
game.
Aubrey Devine found himself
ruled ineligible by PCC Commis
sioner Vic Schmidt. Devine had
played part of a season for Pasa
dena Junior College during the War.
lie left the team late in the season
to enlist in the Air Force and was
accepted. However, he was not
called up for service until after the
season ended. The commissioner
ruled that the year counted as a
college football season.
Schwartz and his staff have been
working the varsity gridders in
two-a-day practices since late Au
gust. Despite hard contact work
there .have been few serious inju
ries. . -
Halfback Jim Hayes came up with
a bad leg injury that will keep him
out of action for most of the season.
Other players have been sidelined
for short periods at a time but none
of them has been hurt seriously
enough to keep him out for over a
week.
Soph halfback Charles Brazel was
the only loss via the grade defi
ciency route.
