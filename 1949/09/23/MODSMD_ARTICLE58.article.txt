# COACH SCHWARTZ
## Marchie Starts Fifth Season He Is Now Co-Deas Of Coast Mentors 
### 
Marchmont (Marchie) Schwartz,
Stanford's popular young coach, is
starting his fifth year as head foot
ball man here on the Farm. Marchie
first came to Stanford as backfield
coach under Clark ShaUghncssy in
1940. When Shaughnessy departed
at the end of the 1941 season, Jim
Lawson was made head coach and
Schwartz planned to continue as
backfield mentor. But Lawson en
tered the Navy shortly before the
start of the 1042 season, and
Schwartz stepped in as head man.
Marchie started out with an in
experienced team in '42 and devel
oped it into the strongest team on
the Coast as the Indians finished
the year in a blaze of glory by
whipping the Navy Pre-Flight (28-
]4) and Cal (26-7).
At the end of 1942 Stanford
abandoned football for the duration
of the war, and Marchie became af
filiated with an oil company in
Kansas.
He returned in 1945 to organize
an informal squad, but it wasn't
until 1946 that Stanford officially
fielded a team again.
Schwartz was quite a football
player in his own right as he was
star halfback at Notre Dame from
1929 to 1931, making All-American
in 1930 and 1931. When he gradu
ated from college he went directly
into coaching and became back
field coach at his alma mater in
1932 and 1933.
Marchie worked with Shaugh
nessy first in 1934 and was athletic
director and head football coach at
Creighton University from 1935
through 1939.
