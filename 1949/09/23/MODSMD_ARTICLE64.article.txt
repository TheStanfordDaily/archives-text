## SPORTS New Harvard Team Eager to Destroy West Coast Opinion of Ivy Grid Teams Best Crimson Squad in Years Boasts Michigan Styled Single Wing Attack 
### AL BERRY 
Stanford's Bii> Renovated Maehire j
tomorrow hits what should prove !
to be one of i<s tougkest games o) j
the current season, when a batch of j
fast, hungry single - wingers from }
Harvard take Horace Greeley's ad- j
vice regarding the westward move- I
merit. Greeley painted tlie West as
a land of great oppoi tunny, and the i
Johnny Harvards seem to feel that 1
there is much gold to be mined in j
the hills of Palo Alto.
Harvard, often referred to as the j
"Stanford of the East,' is an Ivy i
League school, and the Ivy League i
has always been noted ft,r an over- '
abundance of ivy and ; n under- j
abundance of football p'. ers. Not j
so this year.
GAVE ARMY A BAD TIME j
Sticking up like a sore Everest j
inlo the happy clouds of thought |
concerning Ivy League weakness is
the score of last year's West Point
vs. Harvard g.me. The terrible
"Black Knights :>f the Huason" went t
into their half-time dressing room {
with a ripping 7-7 tie v.-ith the boys I
from Cambridge. Hudson Higher
Arnold Galilfa saved the day for the
Cadets in the second half by flipping
the pork-hide \ couple of times to ]
rangy Dan Fold berg. Final score:
Army 20, Harvard 7.
By way of comparison, no half- |
time spurt was necessary for the i
Kadets when they trapped an tin- j
fortunate Injun eleven ir New York
last year.
But comparative scoies, always j
deceptive, don't tell th • true tale. I
Harvard didn't catch Army on the 1
same Saturday tH.it Stanford did, |
and Haivard certainly isn't the 30- j
point favorite that the two scores
would indicate. In reality, the Crim- j
sons last year were as hot and cold 1
as an tutomalic waffle iron. They
batted .500 last season, winning four '
and losing four.
Harvard pulled a surprise 33-24 !
win over Columbia, eked Holy Cross j
20-13, bounced Brown 30-19, and |
beat the Boola-boola boys from 112
Yale, 20-7, for the first time since ;
1941. Their lo ir losses included the j
Army game, Ivy League champion |
Cornell (40-G), a surprising Dart- 1
mouth (14-7), and a genteel but i
blood-thirsty hunch of lads from!
Princeton (47-7).
AI ,L-MICHIG AN STAFF
Coach Art Valpey, with his all-i
Michigan trained staff, di.l not leave |
his backfield coaching job at Ann j
Arbor until fall of last V*ar, which !
accounts for a great deal of Har- I
yard's in - again - out - again record, j
Valpey bad ju:;t three ks to junk '

the Harvard "T" and put in the
Michigan single wing, so he worked
only on offense--letting the defense
care for itself until late in the sea
son. This proved disastrous in some
t-ames, but it should be noted that
the Harvards scored in all of their
contests.
Manpower is somewhat the least
of the V'-jpeyite;-.' worries, as grad
uation took but one man off the
Crimson starling lineup. A 1 Wilson,
a (J-It. 3 - in., 210.-pound transfer
from ih"? University o. Southern
California, more than makes up for
that one, graduation 1of:>.
Strongest point in the Harvard
line centers around their left guard
(running guard), 200 - pound All-
American candidate Howard Hous
ton. Houston i; the team captain,
and w. j s All - Eastern last year.
Coach Valpey, who was number two
coach on the 1947 Michigan squad,
says that Houston could have made
first, string on the national champion
Wolverines hands down. Captain
Houston is also rated as the best
wrestler in Harvard history—which
if: a lo.ig time.
SQUAD LISTED
The Crimson will probably line
up against Stanford tomorrow this
,vay:
Fnds—Transfer A 1 Wilson and left
end Dike Hyde, a rugged 6-ft. 3-in.
Junior from Minneapolis, Minn.
Kvde ij fast, tricky, and blocks
well.
Tackles —At right tackle (strong
side) the Harvards aie featuring
''205 - pound Ralph "Chief" Bender,
who is second only to Captain
Houston, who relieves him on de
fense,. as an offensive lineman. At
the weak-side tackle spot (left) is
one Wiil Davis. Many of the East
ern scribes rate this spot as Har
vard's strongest. Davis p'ayed 50
minutes in the Yale game, but will
probably see only defensive action
tomorrow. Doing offensive chores
will be Doug Bradlee. a 200-pound
senior from Boston.
Center — 210-pound Paul O'Brien
is rated the best Harvard pivot man
since All - American Ben Ticknor
played in 1930. Depth comes into
this position with 210-pound vet
eran Chuck Glynn and sophomore
flash Bili Julian.
Guards—At the left guard spot is
Captain Howard Houston. When
Houston moves to tackle on defense
hi is ably replaced by a rough little
r-uy named Sam Butler. Behind
Butler are Pete Coyne r nd Bill Ro
senau. In the strong side guard
(right) spot is offensive lineman
Jack Coan, > 200 - pound senior.
