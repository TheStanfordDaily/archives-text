## Cinderella Crew Disappoints Farm in Poughkeepsie Finale 
### GIL JONAS 
While most Farm students were
baking in the warm California sun
during their summer vacation, the
final chapter of the 1949 Stanford
"Cinderella" crew was written be
neath a stormy sky over the choppy
waters of the Hudson last June. But
the conclusion of this epic, .set in the
illustrious Poughkcepsie Regatta,
was not a typically happy Holly
wood one for the Cards, who fin
ished a disappointing ldth, far be
hind the favored California and
Washington shells.
The victorious Bears, trailing the
Huskies to the two-mile mark, la
boriously pulled ahead and main
tained their slight lead to the fini h
in 14:42.G. The Huskies finished
two and a half seconds later.
The two Far Western crews shook
ofr early bursts by Princeton and
Yale until the former were vague
blurs from our official Card coach
launch, which had trailed the Farm
eight from the start. Grouped to
gether in a "second'' race \vei> Cor
nell, N.ivy, Princeton, Yak. Colum
bia, Syracuse, and Stanford. Far in
the rear trailed Rutgers and MIT.
Coming in on deiense is Jerry Kan
ter. a six-foot junior from Cincin
nati, Ohio.
Quartet hack—This pos'lion is be
ing ably filled by senior Bill Henry,
a brilliant offensive field general, a
hard runner, and a good passer. De
fensively speaking, Phil Isenberg
has been calbd by the Harvard
Crimson "nothing short of sensa
tional as a line backer-up."
Left half (tailback) —Three expe
rienced veterans are back in this
vital spot: Chuck Roche is a great
runner and Harvard's lest punter.
Jim Noonan is a senior and Har
vard's best pi.sser. Jim Kernary
weighs 190 pounds and 'S said to hit
like a run-away Mack truck. Is.it
tabbed the boy to wrtch in this
position is 148-pound C: ! Loewen
stein, who was eaptaifi of last year's
Crimson frosh. Loewemtein is a
good kicker, a sensational passer,
and very fast.
Right half (wingback) — Hal Mof
fie has been Harvard's hi;.,host scor
er for the la'jt two ye irs. Enough
said.
Full hark—Offensive lu'.lback Paul
Shaler is the Cr.mson's finest faker
and b.i'l handler; he is fast and a
hard runner. Pushing Shaler for
first-string honors is 195 - pound
Jack West, who—according to the
Harvard Crimson —is "a demon
line-backer ;r:a runs with great
speed and vigor."
For the 36 men of Harvard's trav
el squad tomorrow is a big day.
They want to find out if what hap
pened in last year's Army game
was just a poor day for the Cadets,
or a prevue r I things to come in
Cambridge.

Although Cornell maintained a lair
lead in the .second -fioup, any one
of the seven could have finisher!
third with a concerted illort.
Sadden thunder showers caused
the delay of the lrosh race as the
crews were forced to leturn to shore '
twice to empty their shells of water ;
and wring out their soaked jerseys. J
The JV race was postponed until
after the varsity affair and the big
race was delayed once when a fresh
thunderstorm suddenly broke.
