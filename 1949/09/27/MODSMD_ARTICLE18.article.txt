# UNFINISHED DORM
## Carpenters Brush Students In Almost-Finished Stern Hall 
### 
It's a fight to see who controls Stern Hall, the students or the
workmen. Two hundred twenty-nine students moved into the
University's new dorm this weekend despite the fact that actual
completion is a couple of weeks away.
University officials and the new Stern Hall director, Miss

Patricia Davidson put their heads
together early last week and de
! cided that it would he too much to
ask of Stern residents to spend a
few days in the Village before go
ing to Stern, so the "move in" sig
nal was given. Several members of
the Stanford Band were the first to
enter Thursday.
A shortage of beds was the imme
diate problem, but was solved by
late Saturday when about 150 of the
residents had moved in. The direc
tor. Miss Pat as she is called by her
"boys," was forced to give up her
own bed and sleep at her other
home on the campus because of the
i shortage.
Students moving into two of the
I units found no linoleum on the floor,
and because of a strike by the AFL
Linoleum and Carpet Layers' Un
ion. there is no promise of flooring
! until the residents go home for
Christmas, if the strike is over by
| then.
'I he San Francisco warehouse
1 strike has tied up some small fix
tures, and workmen will spend the
next few days putting the finishing
j touches on the hall and cleaning up.
The various decorations on Stern
j pane glass are precautionary meas
ures to prevent workers from stick
! in?; boards through I ho windows,

not the work of mischief makers.
Miss Pat said.
University officials hope that the
dining room and kitchen facilities
will be completed early in October.
Meanwhile, the 229 residents, plus
35 Crothers students and 65 off
campus students allotted Stern
meals, are eating at F.neina. Eating

clubs have been abandoned tempo
rarily at the Commons during this
period.
Despite the -hardships, Stern men
are looking forward to living in the
modern quarters, and the workers
don't mind the company, even the
carpenter trying to drill a hole in a
swinging door at 8 a.m.
