# Eating Clubs Are Without Private Dining Facilities

### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs have
temporarily relinquished their pri
vate room and tables in Encina
Commons, pending completion of the
Stern Hall dining unit. Miss Chris
tine Kicker, Director of University
dining halls, confirmed yesterday.
Reason for the shake-up is the fact
that some 300 Stern Hall men have
been forced to take their meals in
Encina as long as their dining hall
remains in the construction stage.
Overcrowded conditions in the com
mons caused dining directors to ask
temporary displacement of the Eat
ing Clubs.
As it now stands, Clubbers are
handled just as all others, filing into
the dining halls and eating at unre
served places. Miss Ricker said the
clubs would regain their former
status immediately after completion
of the Stern Unit.
