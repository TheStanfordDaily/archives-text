## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
Faculty as well as students are
at Stanford to learn, Dr. Clarence
Faust, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, told incoming freshmen at an
assembly in the Memorial Audito
rium last night.
Dr. Faust explained and defended
"the paradoxical thesis that the
University is a place of learning" by
first explaining how the faculty are
"pushing out the frontiers of
knowledge" through research in sci
ence, food research, work in the
Hoover Library on the causes of
war and revolution, and work with
communications and language.
Learning for students, Dr. Faust
corttiued, must not be accumu
lating knowledge "like collecting
stamps or mustache cups," but must
be the kind of learning that makes
it possible to solve important prob
lems, The University is teaching
them to be capable of intelligent
judgment, not trying to develop
quiz kids.
Don't be in a hurry to specialize,
was his first advice to his audience.
Preoccupation wtih specializing, and
ignoring the problems every citizen
should meet, can lead to fascism.
Dr. Faust's final advice was that
the first six weeks arc the crucial
ones in a freshman's career. He
ended by wishing his audience the
best of luck in finding the Univer
sity a real place of learning.
