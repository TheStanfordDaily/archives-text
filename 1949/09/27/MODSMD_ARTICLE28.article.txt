# Russia's Economy Vastly Defective, New Book Claims
## 
### 
Lenin said "land to the peasants ;
. . . bread to the hungry," but the I
years of Communist domination in 1
the Soviet Union have actually ta
ken land away from the peasants,
and bread has been less abundant
than in Czarist times. So says agri
cultural economist Naum Jasny, au
thor of "Tlie Socialized Agriculture
of the USSR," published last week
by the Stanford University Press.
Today, when we are acutely con
scious of the word "socialism," and
when much of the world is faced
with agrarian problems, many are
wondering just how effectively the
Russian system of collective farms
has operated. Jasny supplies a mass
of evidence from original sources to
support his conclusion that it has
been tragically defective.
FOR EXAMPLE
For one thing, the peasants on ;
collective farms could starve while |
the state took most of the farm out
put to feed the urban, industrial
population. The only solution would
be a gigantic and immediate in
crease in agricultural output, which
isn't likely, judging by the record
Jasny presents.
He warns against the pitfalls fac
ing similar experiments in socialized
agriculture in other parts of the
world. In the Soviet Union, despite
increased mechanization, productiv
ity per work hour in agriculture has
not grown proportionately. Much is
still done by hand, and there is
heavy work for women. It is con
sidered more important for a high- j
yielding cow than a woman dairy
worker to have a daily rest period.
MISREPRESENTATION
Soviet statistics are often misrep- j
resented to produce the desired re- i
suits. This made Jasny's task ex- j
tremely difficult. He cites the way
statistics for Russia's exceptionally j
productive year, 1937, have been
widely quoted to indicate the gen
eral "success" of the entire system
of collectivization.
Russian-born Jasny, a recognized
authority on Soviet agriculture, is
at present a consultant with Stan

j ford University's Food Research In
| stitute. His experience has taken
I him to many countries, and he has
i written widely on agricultural econ
| omy in Russian, German, and Eng
j lish. The book, No. 5 in the "Grain
j Economics Series," is a publication
| of the Food Research Institute.
