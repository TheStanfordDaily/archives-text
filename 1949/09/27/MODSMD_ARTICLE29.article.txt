# 'Cable Joey' Is a Sellout
## 
### 
"Cable Car Joey," the University
Press's lirsl trade juvenile, was sold
out on Sept. 18, one month after the
first printing. A 10,000-copy second
printing is now being run off the
presses.
The book, written by Naomi and
Lorin MacCabe, became an over
night success, especially in Chicago
where the Cable Car is one of the
features of the Railroad Fair.
Gn Sept. 1, a bell-ringing contest
was held al the fair with prizes con
sisting mainly of copies of "Cable
Car Joey."
Adults, as well as children, are
reported to he giving Cable Car
Joey parties, baking Cable Car Joey
cakes, and making Christmas mod
e's of Cable Car Joey from wood,
cardboard, or metal.
The story of Joey begins on top
of a hill many years ago. From
there, it follows his ups and downs
from the early days to the present,
and each adventure is punctuated
with a colorful line drawing in
cable-car red, green, and gold by
the late Lorin MacCabe.
The Press also recently published
the third edition of "America in
Fiction,'' a mass of fiction interpret
ing life in the United States put to
gether by Otis W. Coan and Richard
G. Lillard.
This annotated book is directed
at adults and young people alike,
with the specific purpose of helping
readers understand their country
better through imaginative writings
which present specific human be
ings in realizable situations.
