# It Seems Fair to Us
## 
### 
Last Saturday Stanford rooters paid $1.20
for student tickets to the Stanford-Harvard
football game. This week they will have to
cough up an additional $1.20 if they want to
see Stanford mix it up with Michigan Satur
day. 112
The amount of griping caused by the rein
statement of this "old Stanford tradition" has
been up to expectations. Looking at similar
situations elsewhere, many students see no
reason why they should fork over a buck
twenty for the privilege of watching their
schoolmates tangle with intersectional football
opponents.
Frankly the Athletic Department has antici
pated that there would be complaints because
the students are not generally aware that the
charge is traditionally made.
Don't think that this is some new assessment
that the powers-that-be have thought up over
the summer, because it isn't. A 1 Masters says
the $1.20 was the going price for intersec
tional tfjames when he took over his job as
Aathletic Director 24 years ago. Just how much
farther .back this "tradition" goes, he doesn't
know. ■
Unfortunately there hasn't been a major non
conference opponent in the Stanford Stadium
since before the war. The revival of this charge
after such a long period of time was bound to
bring about a few complaints.
What most students don't know is that the
Athletic Department only receives one dollar
per quarter out of each student's tuition to
take care of admissions to athletic events. For
his dollar this quarter the Stanford student
will receive free admission to five football

games, all water polo games, and a number
of pre-holiday basketball games as well as the
opportunity to buy reduced-price tickets to
four additional football games.
To meet the athletic budget it is imperative
that some additional assessment of students
be made. Whether the money be collected
through increasing tuition, selling athletic ac
tivity cards, or through the sale of individual
game tickets as is done now, makes no differ
ence. In any event, it must be collected.
The SAC sells tickets to the individual
games because it believes that this is the only
fair way. Those who wish to attend the games
may buy reduced-price rooters' tickets, while
those who cannot or who do not want to see
them do not have to do so.
In view of the circumstances it seems to us
that a charge of $1.20 for the two intersection
als, $1.50 for USC, and $1.80 for the Big Game
is entirely fair.
