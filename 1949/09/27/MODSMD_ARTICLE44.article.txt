"Beyond the call of duty."
It's an overworked phrase, but there is no
better way to describe the efforts of all the
students who gave up part of their summer
vacation to return to school early and start all
the various campus activities rolling again.
Through their untiring efforts we have had
one of the best pre-reg programs in Farm his
tory.
On behalf of the student body The Daily
wishes to thank Warren Gartman and his pre
reg committees, rally com, the band, and all
the sponsors for an outstanding job.
