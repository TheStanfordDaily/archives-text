# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Bull Session —like several other traditions around
I his place—has ? past. In fact, since way back in
1931, different characters have been making with the
words, trying in their innocent way to charm and
influence unsuspecting Daily patrons. And in all
that time (19 years) more than a few varied inter
ests have been presented.
Some guys have gagged it up, others have played
it straight. Some have talked of » j -5; u

shoes and ships, others of affairs
of ;state. Some have lowered the
boom on Poor Cal, while others
have fallen back to ratting on a
pal. And good 01 bad, it's all been
8.5. (Bull Session).
Me, I don't know what I'm go
ing to do. I'm just a poor dumb
sportswriter trying to get along,
and stuff like atomic mysteries in
outer Siberia, the scotch-starved
Britons, NSA, and the lIR makes
my typewriter start to stutter

worse than a defensive halfback about to be blocked
by Emery Mitchell,
I've tried to be witty, but iti the process most of
my friends have shunned me. However, yesterday t
was pleased to receive notice of improvement. I
overheard someone stating that I was definitely a
half-wit.
So from here on in, we ought to be able to work
things out together. At any rate, we'll take a good
look at Stanford Life, autumn-style, 1949. The theme

—local em to death—will be the password. And
why complain? It's Hall for nothing.
* # *
Casual mental notes as Stanford knockcd the Ila
out of Hahvaad last Saturday: I like football again,
I like the way the band played, I like the cheer
leaders, I even like Rally Committee. . . . Nobody
seems to say much about our defensive halfbacks, but
Ken Peck, David Field, and Mickey Titus arq among
the best in the business. . . . How long has it been
since Stanford could toss in four quarterbacks and
keep on carrying the offense? Was San Jose State
really as pitiful as Coach John Breier believed? . . .
Ninety-three points in two games, a total of no for
the opposition—is this really the same school I
started as a freshman? . . . The Big Red Machine —
it's the first titne since the war that sportswriters and
such could apply the old tag with a straight face.
Ah, football—besides all else it has to offer, it's the
only season that you can walk down the street with
a girl on one arm, a blanket on the other, and not
look suspicious.

So much for football. Today is the day that I
turn over my summer's savings to the Administra
tion. It is the day that all sane persons will steer
clear of the Bookstore. It is the day that the social
ones will begin to gather again to fight it out with
the bees at the Cellar. And it is also the day before
Wednesday, which is tomorrow, which is when we'll
start all over again.

leaders, I even like Rally Committee. . . . Nobody
seems to say much about our defensive halfbacks, but
Ken Peck, David Field, and Mickey Titus arq among
the best in the business. . . . How long has it been
since Stanford could toss in four quarterbacks and
keep on carrying the offense? Was San Jose State
really as pitiful as Coach John Breier believed? . . .
Ninety-three points in two games, a total of no for
the opposition—is this really the same school I
started as a freshman? . . . The Big Red Machine —
it's the first titne since the war that sportswriters and
such could apply the old tag with a straight face.
Ah, football—besides all else it has to offer, it's the
only season that you can walk down the street with
a girl on one arm, a blanket on the other, and not
look suspicious.

So much for football. Today is the day that I
turn over my summer's savings to the Administra
tion. It is the day that all sane persons will steer
clear of the Bookstore. It is the day that the social
ones will begin to gather again to fight it out with
the bees at the Cellar. And it is also the day before
Wednesday, which is tomorrow, which is when we'll
start all over again.

Bull Session —like several other traditions around
I his place—has ? past. In fact, since way back in
1931, different characters have been making with the
words, trying in their innocent way to charm and
influence unsuspecting Daily patrons. And in all
that time (19 years) more than a few varied inter
ests have been presented.
Some guys have gagged it up, others have played
it straight. Some have talked of » j -5; u

shoes and ships, others of affairs
of ;state. Some have lowered the
boom on Poor Cal, while others
have fallen back to ratting on a
pal. And good 01 bad, it's all been
8.5. (Bull Session).
Me, I don't know what I'm go
ing to do. I'm just a poor dumb
sportswriter trying to get along,
and stuff like atomic mysteries in
outer Siberia, the scotch-starved
Britons, NSA, and the lIR makes
my typewriter start to stutter

worse than a defensive halfback about to be blocked
by Emery Mitchell,
I've tried to be witty, but iti the process most of
my friends have shunned me. However, yesterday t
was pleased to receive notice of improvement. I
overheard someone stating that I was definitely a
half-wit.
So from here on in, we ought to be able to work
things out together. At any rate, we'll take a good
look at Stanford Life, autumn-style, 1949. The theme

—local em to death—will be the password. And
why complain? It's Hall for nothing.

Casual mental notes as Stanford knockcd the Ila
