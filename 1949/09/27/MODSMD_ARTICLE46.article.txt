To the Editor:
I hate to appear in the eyes of my superiors to
be a nagging, disgruntled, discontented sorehead, but
perhaps these same superiors would excuse my boor
ishness were I to ask—in as polite a voice as possible
-just what the story is on students having to pay
admission to their own rooting section for games
played in their own stadium. We were honored and
delighted to play host to Harvard, and will be as
honored to meet Michigan. We hope that they
will return often.
But for myself, I cannot see having to fork over
lo the powers that be—these self-same superiors—
one buck twenty for the privilege of sitting in a
stadium expressly built "for the enjoyment of Stan
ford's athletic contests" and for the added privilege

of watching a Stanford team composed of my own
classmates.
Perhaps it is dull of me to repeat what should be
obvious, but the infernal stupidity and plain darn
cussedness which demands that registered students
come across to watch their own football team play
two intersectional games, has gone quite far enough.
The price of admission for both the USC and the
Cal games is, I believe, entirely in order. But to pay
lo watch more than that, and to nonetheless be ex
pected to root for the dear old Cardinal, is : bit thick.
What do they want us to do, form a rooting section
in front of Longbarn's television set?
