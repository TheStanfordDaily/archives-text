# Portion of Stanford Electron Linear Accelerator Ready for Testing Soon
## 
### 
Stanford physicists are ready to
begin tests on the first 15-foot sec
tion of the University's new - type
atom smasher — the electron linear
accelerator.
The initial section of the accelera
tor is expected to produce 70 to 80
million electron volts, compared to
the billion - volt output which the
physicists hope to have when the
atom smasher is completed to its
160-foot length.
This was reported last week by
Richard F. Post of the physics de
partment staff at a meeting of the
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers in San Francisco.
MICROWAVE POWER
Power for the accelerator will be
generated by a series of high-power
vacuum tubes which will be turned
on in pulses of only a little over a
millionth of a second, then turned
off for a sixtieth of a second before
being turned on again.
Electrons will speed along this
powerful microwave at a speed close
to that of light.
Disintegration of the atom occurs
when a speeding electron, to which
tremendous mass and energy have
been imparted by acceleration, col
lides with an atom which happens to
be in its path.
The resulting collision is cxpcctcd
to smash large hunks from the
atomic nucleus and to produce
heavier mesons than has been hith
erto possible in laboratories. Mesons
are by-products of cosmic ray col
lisions.
MAY OPEN NEW FIELDS
Post said that if Stanford physi
cists are successful in producing
billion - volt electrons — and it may
not be before late in 1951 that they
can do so—a number of new ex
perimental fields will be opened in
nuclear research.
Assuming that the billion - volt
electrons will come out of the ac
celerator "like water out of a spig
ot," Post, indicated that these heavy
electrons will provide a new method
of studying both the properties of
the electron and the proton and pos
sibly the neutron.
The 15 - foot electron accelerator
will be the first one in its energy
range in which it will be possible to
bring the electrons out of the ac
celerator into the laboratory for
study. This will be true also of the
160-foot model.
'CAMERA' THEORY
It may be possible, Post said,
to use the electron beam as a sort
of super "diffraction camera" to
study nuclear charge distributions.
The accelerator will also make
possible a careful experimental
check of the "shower theory," which
is based on the phenomenon that
particularly energetic particles pio
duce bursts of atomic bits and ra
diation when they collide. The ex
istence of these atomic "showers" is
known from cloud chamber experi
ments, but no accurate checks of the
theory have been made.
"So that you are not left with the

impression that from here on every
thing (in the construction and oper
ation of the linear accelei'ator) is
obvious, let me point out that there

were many opportunities to go
astray in the early stages of the
program, and there will be many
more," Post warned.

The resulting collision is cxpcctcd
to smash large hunks from the
atomic nucleus and to produce
heavier mesons than has been hith
erto possible in laboratories. Mesons
are by-products of cosmic ray col
lisions.
MAY OPEN NEW FIELDS
Post said that if Stanford physi
cists are successful in producing
billion - volt electrons — and it may
not be before late in 1951 that they
can do so—a number of new ex
perimental fields will be opened in
nuclear research.
Assuming that the billion - volt
electrons will come out of the ac
celerator "like water out of a spig
ot," Post, indicated that these heavy
electrons will provide a new method
of studying both the properties of
the electron and the proton and pos
sibly the neutron.
The 15 - foot electron accelerator
will be the first one in its energy
range in which it will be possible to
bring the electrons out of the ac
celerator into the laboratory for
study. This will be true also of the
160-foot model.
'CAMERA' THEORY
It may be possible, Post said,
to use the electron beam as a sort
of super "diffraction camera" to
study nuclear charge distributions.
The accelerator will also make
possible a careful experimental
check of the "shower theory," which
is based on the phenomenon that
particularly energetic particles pio
duce bursts of atomic bits and ra
diation when they collide. The ex
istence of these atomic "showers" is
known from cloud chamber experi
ments, but no accurate checks of the
theory have been made.
"So that you are not left with the

impression that from here on every
thing (in the construction and oper
ation of the linear accelei'ator) is
obvious, let me point out that there

were many opportunities to go
astray in the early stages of the
program, and there will be many
more," Post warned.
Stanford physicists are ready to
begin tests on the first 15-foot sec
tion of the University's new - type
atom smasher — the electron linear
accelerator.
The initial section of the accelera
tor is expected to produce 70 to 80
million electron volts, compared to
the billion - volt output which the
physicists hope to have when the
atom smasher is completed to its
160-foot length.
This was reported last week by
Richard F. Post of the physics de
partment staff at a meeting of the
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers in San Francisco.
MICROWAVE POWER
Power for the accelerator will be
generated by a series of high-power
vacuum tubes which will be turned
on in pulses of only a little over a
millionth of a second, then turned
off for a sixtieth of a second before
being turned on again.
Electrons will speed along this
powerful microwave at a speed close
to that of light.
Disintegration of the atom occurs
when a speeding electron, to which
tremendous mass and energy have
been imparted by acceleration, col
lides with an atom which happens to
be in its path.
The resulting collision is cxpcctcd
to smash large hunks from the
atomic nucleus and to produce
heavier mesons than has been hith
erto possible in laboratories. Mesons
are by-products of cosmic ray col
lisions.
