Many 1949 Quads, bought and
paid for last spring quarter, are
awaiting their owners at the ASSU
office. The Quad staff asks that stu
dents who ordered Quads last spring
and have not yet called for them do
so at their earliest convenience.
Receipts should be presented at
the ASSU office when claiming the
book.
A few 1949 Quads still remain un
sold and are available on a first
come-first-served basis.
