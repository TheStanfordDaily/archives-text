# Film on Negro Problem Scores Brilliant Attack
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
"This picture has guts" scream the
billboards—and surprisingly enough
the advertising moguls are right.
"Home of the Brave" rips and
tears and forces its way through the
color line. This independent produc
tion, the vanguard of a series of
"Negro Intolerance" films, has
tossed its cap over a peak the major

studios will have
a hard time in
reaching with the
coming films
on intolerance.
Most refreshing
thing about the
picture, which is
now playing at
the Varsity The-

atcr, is a parcel of young actors, at
tractively displayed in tailor-made
roles. This alluring gift package in
cludes Frank Lovejoy, cynical and
sentimental sergeant; Lloyd Bridges,
towheaded private with a winning
grin and a Negro friend; Steve Bro
die, bitter, insecure, contemptuous
of a "Nigger-lover"; Jim Edwards,
proud and shy, sensitive of the color
line he can't cross. Douglas Dick, the
only well-known actor in the film,
comes off second best to the rest of
the cast.
Last of the new names on the
screen credits is that of director
Mark Robson, hottest directorial
prospect in half a Hollywood dec
ade. Robson's terse and almost bril
liant style carries the picture close
to the violent "Crossfire" of a few
seasons ago, in acting and clarity of
direction.
The film deals with four men who
find themselves on the wrong side
of the world during the recent "war
to end wars" and a Negro private
for whom no side of the world seems
to be the right one. Their task is to
survey a Japanese-held island. The
men work under ever - increasing
pressure. One man dies. Another
becomes paralyzed rather than face
his conscience. The third does his
with calm authority. The fourth
man remains bitter with hate. The
last man loses his armor of cyni
cism. The result is a moving and
very rarely superficial picture.
