# Foreign Student Aid Asked
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Palo Alto
Council of Church Women's com- j
mittee on foreign students last week,
Willard VVaterous urged Palo Allans
to give Stanford foreign students
hospitality, aid in housing and trans
portation.
A record fall enrollment of nearly
250 foreign students is expected here
and therefore help from community
organizations as well as campus ones
will be needed, Waterous said.
He said that he hoped those de- j
sirous of making the students ac- '

quaintcd with America could invite
them to private homes, offer trans
| portation, and ask them to social
receptions held by various organiza
tions. Help in obtaining housing and
part-time jobs is also needed.
Anyone interested in assisting for
eign students may contact Waterous
at Room 24 Temporary Building B.
or by calling DA 3-9411, extension
