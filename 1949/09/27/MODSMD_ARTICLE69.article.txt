# Undefeated, Unscored-on, Cards Prep for Michigan
## It's a Great Feeling, But Indians Still Wonder, 'How Good Are We?' 
### 
Stanford's undefeated, untied, anil
! unscored - upon football team, still
j wondering "How good are we?"
| started preparation yesterday for
Saturday's game with Michigan,
proud possessor of a string of 24
I straight wins and holder of the
I number one team in the nation rat
! ing.
The Cards, along with their coach,
I are pondering over a question yet
j unanswered a fifth of the way
through the season. None doubted
that the question would be an
j svvered, in large part at least, by
j G o'clock Saturday evening next.
For a team that had scored f)3
! points in two games, with neither
contest considered easy before it
was played, the Indians are indeed
in a quandary.
Team members were quick to give
the Harvards their due after last
week's tilt. Most of the Card line
men spoke up for the Easterners,
said they charged well, hit hard and
. . . but they couldn't explain away
a' 44 to 0 score.
It was generally agreed that it
was the speed of the Stanford backs
' that turned the trick, on offense at

!east. But the Card line should come
in for more than a little praise. They
were off on the ball and outcharged
their opponents all game.
All agreed, coaches and team
alike, that a lot of work remained
to be done before the mighty Wol
verines from Michigan could be
licked, or even met on equal terms.
With the lapses in pass defense
in mind, in both the San Jose State
and Harvard game, the coaches ran
the squad through extensive pass
defense drills yesterday. Time was
also given over to work on pass pro
tection for Card quarterbacks Tom
Shaw and Gary Kerkorian.
Stanford's current run on good
breaks was stretched again this
week. End Jack Rye suffered a
broken nose. Guard Dick Lucas is
limping from a bad charley horse
and A 1 Laakso aggravated an old
ankle injury. All will be available
Saturday.
