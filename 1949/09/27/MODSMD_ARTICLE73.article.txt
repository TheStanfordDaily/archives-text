# Schwartz Indicates Indians Might Surprise Wolverines
## Farm Coach Pays Tribute to Howard Houston As One of Most Outstanding Tackles in Years 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26 (/P) —
Michigan's 24-game winning streak
stretching over three years may
come to an end this Saturday against
Stanford, Cpach Marchie Schwartz
of Stanford ventured today at the
football writers meeting.
Schwartz made it clear he was not
predicting a victory for his unde
feated, unscored upon team. He
said the possibility of beating Michi
gan was there in these words: "if
Stanford plays up to its capabilities,
we possibly can end Michigan's win
ning streak."
The Stanford mentor, whose squad
racked up a one-sided 44-0 win over
Harvard last week, said his players
"believe in themselves. They have
determination and confidence, a fine
attitude. At the same time they
realize they cannot rest on their
laurels.

"We have a lot of respect for
Michigan. Our Mai Elward who
scouted the Michigan - Michigan
State game reports that Michigan is
excellent on defense. He observed
the team is long-pass minded on
offense. Michigan used the T-forma
tion sparingly against Michigan
State and scored its winning touch
down (7-3) on a pass from this sys
tem.
"The lineman we will watch
closely will be A 1 Wistert the big
tackle. Our scout report reveals
that Wistert gets down on the plays
with great speed."
Coach Schwartz said he wished to
pay tribute to Harvard's great tackle,
Howard Houston, who played an
outstanding game in spite of his
team's defeat. "This is something I
seldom do," Schwartz said. "I intend
to write Houston a personal letter
congratulating him on his fine play.
He undoubtedly was an All America
against us. He made 90 per cent of
the tackles on defense and was hard
to block out. Even when the Har
vard cause was utterly hopeless in
the fourth period. Houston played
his heart out. He is one of the best
I have seen in years."
Les Etter, Michigan publicity man,
said the Stanford game was being
taken seriously. "We know we are
meeting a better team than two
years ago when the score was 49-13
in our favor. The Stanford, team in
1947 lacked speed. Ii has it now.
Michigan is not as fast as it was last
year but it is bigger."
Michigan's platoon system is caus
ing more of a problem this season
than last, Etter declared. Graduation
of key men has left holes, he said,
which probably will entail using
tackles A 1 Wistert and Bob Wahl, as
well as Lloyd Heneveld, guard, on
both offense and defense much of
the time.

come to an end this Saturday against
Stanford, Cpach Marchie Schwartz
of Stanford ventured today at the
football writers meeting.
Schwartz made it clear he was not
predicting a victory for his unde
feated, unscored upon team. He
said the possibility of beating Michi
gan was there in these words: "if
Stanford plays up to its capabilities,
we possibly can end Michigan's win
ning streak."
The Stanford mentor, whose squad
racked up a one-sided 44-0 win over
Harvard last week, said his players
"believe in themselves. They have
determination and confidence, a fine
attitude. At the same time they
realize they cannot rest on their
laurels.

"We have a lot of respect for
Michigan. Our Mai Elward who
scouted the Michigan - Michigan
State game reports that Michigan is
excellent on defense. He observed
the team is long-pass minded on
offense. Michigan used the T-forma
tion sparingly against Michigan
State and scored its winning touch
down (7-3) on a pass from this sys
tem.
"The lineman we will watch
closely will be A 1 Wistert the big
tackle. Our scout report reveals
that Wistert gets down on the plays
with great speed."
Coach Schwartz said he wished to
pay tribute to Harvard's great tackle,
Howard Houston, who played an
outstanding game in spite of his
team's defeat. "This is something I
seldom do," Schwartz said. "I intend
to write Houston a personal letter
congratulating him on his fine play.
He undoubtedly was an All America
against us. He made 90 per cent of
the tackles on defense and was hard
to block out. Even when the Har
vard cause was utterly hopeless in
the fourth period. Houston played
his heart out. He is one of the best
I have seen in years."
Les Etter, Michigan publicity man,
said the Stanford game was being
taken seriously. "We know we are
meeting a better team than two
years ago when the score was 49-13
in our favor. The Stanford, team in
1947 lacked speed. Ii has it now.
Michigan is not as fast as it was last
year but it is bigger."
Michigan's platoon system is caus
ing more of a problem this season
than last, Etter declared. Graduation
of key men has left holes, he said,
which probably will entail using
tackles A 1 Wistert and Bob Wahl, as
well as Lloyd Heneveld, guard, on
both offense and defense much of
the time.
