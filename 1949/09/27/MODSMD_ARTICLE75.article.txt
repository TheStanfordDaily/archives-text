# Five Stanford Opponents Take Weekend Victories
## Michigan, UCLA, OSC, USC, and Cal Score Wins in Saturday Grid Tussles 
### CRAYTON JONES 
With two games under its belt already, Stanford now faces
eight more games on consecutive Saturdays before the season
officially ends. Of these eight all are conference tilts with the
exception of Michigan and Santa Clara. Conference games in
clude UCLA, Washington, Oregon State, USC, Idaho, and Cali-

fornia. All these teams were active
last weekend, so a check of their
activities might prove enlightening.
At Ann Arbor Michigan squeezed
by Michigan State 7 to 3 as th'jy
cut short a last-minute drive by the
Spai'tans with only two minutes re
maining to play. Michigan Staie
jumped into an early 3 to 0 lead .in
a first - period field goal, but the
Wolverines recovered a fumble on
State's 25 in the second quarter to
set up the gr.me - winning touch
down. The score came on a pass
from quarterback Bill Putich to Irv
Wisnicwski.
DEFENSE IS STRONG
Statistically speaking the game

was even closer.
Michigan rolled
for only 89 yards
on the ground
while the Spar
tans gained 92. In
the air Michigan
had the edge with
115 yards and the
Statemen hit for
85. These low fig
ures indicate that

Irv Wisniewski defense was the
big factor and speak well for the
Wolverine line.
UCLA paid a visit to the Midwest
where they broke loose with a
third-quarter splurge and went on
to down lowa 41 to 25. lowa is rated
as a second-rate team in the Big
Ten, but UCLA's convincing win
establishes them as a definite con
tender here on the Coast.
The Bruins have now won two in
a row under their new coach, Henry
(Red) Sanders. They routed Ore
gon State 35 to 13 a week ago in the
Coliseum.
HUSKIES LOSE
The Washington Huskies also vis
ited (he Midwest but their opponent,
Minnesota, showed little mercy and
proceded to overpower the North
erners 48 to 20. The Huskies opened
their season a week ago by eking
out a 14 to 6 win over a surprisingly
strong Utah eleven.
However, the Huskies have it
easy this week; they play Notre
Dame next Saturday at Seattle.
Oregon State recovered from their
35 to 13 shellacking at the hands
of UCLA, and roared back to
trounce Utah 27 to 7 last weekend.
The Beavers, who are traditionally
slow starters, have a new coach in
the person of Kip Taylor, a former
Michigan star.
Santa Clara edged by San Jose
State last Saturday night 14 to 13 as
Marty Formico ran back a fourth
quarter punt for a Bronco score.
TROJANS SIIINE
For the first time since before the
war Southern California looked
good in their season opener when
they turned back a fighting Navy
team 42 to 20. Such familiar names
as Jay Roundy. Jim Powers, and
Bill Martin played a prominent part
in tho lopsided triumph as the Tro
jans definitely justified their posi
tion as pre-season favorites.
As usual, publicity reports from
Idaho raved about what was to be
the best Vandal team in 20 years.
When the Vandals ran rough-shod
over little Willamette University
79 to 0 it appeared that for once the
reports were well founded. But
Idaho reverted to form last Satur
day when they played dead while
Oregon romped to a 41 to 0 win.

Cal seems to be unaffected by the
loss of such stalwarts as Jack Swa
ner, Billy Main, John Cunningham,
Norm Pressley, and Doug Duncan.
The Bears with apparent ease have
! downed Santa Clara and St. Mary's
on consecutive Saturdays and ap
pear to be a Rose Bowl candidate
once again.
Swaner will probably be out for
! another three weeks, but he should
i be ready for the Cal-USC ;jame on
Oct. 13 when the Bears get their
' first real test.
