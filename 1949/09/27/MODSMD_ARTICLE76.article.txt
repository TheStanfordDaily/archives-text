# Indian Gridders jubilant After Harvard Conquest
## 
### AL BERRY 
Colonel Allen, Stanford home
t '..ame timer, finally pulled the trig-
I | er, the game ended, the field was
' flooded with joyous Indian gridsters
! eager to congratulate each other,
iud a tired referee reluctantly gave
ihe fjame ball to a bruised Captain
A 1 Kau, The scoreboard read 44-0.
The Re 'shirts on the field were
immediately surrounded by wildly
happy tans — Rupe Andrews, Holy
Boruck, Gary Kerkorian, and Ken
Rose, at least, were still signing au
-1 to raphs a half-hour after the Big
Renovated Machine had left its in
delible mark on a completely
I crushed Cambridge eleven. But for
the lads who had eagerly journeyed
:>.OOO some odd miles in search of
victory, there was not much glory—
only a great weariness, a few inju
ries, and the overwhelming sadness
ut defeat. It had been their big
game, and something, somehow, had
gone wrong.
HOUSTON SICK
Harvard's team captain, Howard
Houston, had played his heart out
for the Crimson for a great part of
the game. He was neither as good
as the Sunday morning papers were
to paint him, nor as bad as the lop
sided score made him look. As he
walked off the field, his helmet
dang'ing by his hand, he was heard
to repeat in a dazed voice, "What
fast backs, wluit fast backs, Lord
what fast backs!"
There was something very un
usual about the attitude of the Har
vard team. In the second quarter
when Crimson halfback Jim Kenary
sustained an extremely painful knee
injury, one man—the trainer—both
ered to run out on the field to aid
him. Dr. Karl Carlson, the Stanford

team physician, and one of the In- I
dian student managers ran out to j
help him when it became apparent
that the Crimson managers intended
to stay bench-bound. It was left to
the Stanford manager to assist the
Harvard trainer in carrying Kenary
not only off the field but into the
visitors' half-time shack.
STUNNED HARVARD
As Kenary was carried past the
Harvard bench, still in a great deal
of pain, not one Valpeyite looked
up; not one "Tough luck. Jim!" was
heard. Halfback Kenary was in
jured, out of the game, and Ijius, it
appealed, no longer of any interest
to his teammates. What sympathy
he got was from the Stanford loot
ing section: "Injured player, rah rah
rah!"
If it was very quiet in the Har- j
vard dressing room after the game, j
the Indian locker room was by far j
the opposite extreme. Old alums J
were shaking hands with players, j
other alums, and even with them- (
selves. Nobody seemed to know [
whether or not the Stanford team
was very good or if the Spartans
and the Johnnies had been poor
football teams. After the lean years
since the war, it was somehow hard
to believe that the Cardinals were
40 some odd points better than a
major opponent.
THE BAND PLAYED ON
Outside the Indian dressing room j
the Stanford band was playing. It J
sounded good, but to some of the j
old-timers it was a reminder of a '
Saturday afternoon two years ago j
when the band played outside of a !
very silent Stanford dressing room. ;
The band sounded much better last '
week than it did in 1947 after UCLA
had trounced the Cards 39-G.
On the Indian team blackboard
before the game, someone had wt it- j
ten: "How Good Are We?" After
the game this was erased, and a
quotation from Adolf Hitler was I
written in its place: "Tomorrow—
The World!"

that the Crimson managers intended
to stay bench-bound. It was left to
the Stanford manager to assist the
Harvard trainer in carrying Kenary
not only off the field but into the
visitors' half-time shack.
STUNNED HARVARD
As Kenary was carried past the
Harvard bench, still in a great deal
of pain, not one Valpeyite looked
up; not one "Tough luck. Jim!" was
heard. Halfback Kenary was in
jured, out of the game, and Ijius, it
appealed, no longer of any interest
to his teammates. What sympathy
he got was from the Stanford loot
ing section: "Injured player, rah rah
rah!"
If it was very quiet in the Har- j
vard dressing room after the game, j
the Indian locker room was by far j
the opposite extreme. Old alums J
were shaking hands with players, j
other alums, and even with them- (
selves. Nobody seemed to know [
whether or not the Stanford team
was very good or if the Spartans
and the Johnnies had been poor
football teams. After the lean years
since the war, it was somehow hard
to believe that the Cardinals were
40 some odd points better than a
major opponent.
THE BAND PLAYED ON
Outside the Indian dressing room j
the Stanford band was playing. It J
sounded good, but to some of the j
old-timers it was a reminder of a '
Saturday afternoon two years ago j
when the band played outside of a !
very silent Stanford dressing room. ;
The band sounded much better last '
week than it did in 1947 after UCLA
had trounced the Cards 39-G.
On the Indian team blackboard
before the game, someone had wt it- j
ten: "How Good Are We?" After
the game this was erased, and a
quotation from Adolf Hitler was I
written in its place: "Tomorrow—
The World!"
Colonel Allen, Stanford home
t '..ame timer, finally pulled the trig-
I | er, the game ended, the field was
' flooded with joyous Indian gridsters
! eager to congratulate each other,
iud a tired referee reluctantly gave
ihe fjame ball to a bruised Captain
A 1 Kau, The scoreboard read 44-0.
The Re 'shirts on the field were
immediately surrounded by wildly
happy tans — Rupe Andrews, Holy
Boruck, Gary Kerkorian, and Ken
Rose, at least, were still signing au
-1 to raphs a half-hour after the Big
Renovated Machine had left its in
delible mark on a completely
I crushed Cambridge eleven. But for
the lads who had eagerly journeyed
:>.OOO some odd miles in search of
victory, there was not much glory—
only a great weariness, a few inju
ries, and the overwhelming sadness
ut defeat. It had been their big
game, and something, somehow, had
gone wrong.
HOUSTON SICK
Harvard's team captain, Howard
Houston, had played his heart out
for the Crimson for a great part of
the game. He was neither as good
as the Sunday morning papers were
to paint him, nor as bad as the lop
sided score made him look. As he
walked off the field, his helmet
dang'ing by his hand, he was heard
to repeat in a dazed voice, "What
fast backs, wluit fast backs, Lord
what fast backs!"
There was something very un
usual about the attitude of the Har
vard team. In the second quarter
when Crimson halfback Jim Kenary
sustained an extremely painful knee
injury, one man—the trainer—both
ered to run out on the field to aid
him. Dr. Karl Carlson, the Stanford

team physician, and one of the In- I
dian student managers ran out to j
help him when it became apparent
that the Crimson managers intended
to stay bench-bound. It was left to
the Stanford manager to assist the
Harvard trainer in carrying Kenary
not only off the field but into the
