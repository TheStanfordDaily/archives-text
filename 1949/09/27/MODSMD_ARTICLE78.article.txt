# Taylor's Frosh Gridmen Primed for JV Opener
## Manoogian, St. Geme, Eldredge Outstanding As '53 Footballers Prepare for Initial Battle 
### DICK KLEIN 
With their season opener only
four days away, Coach Chuck Tay
lor's newest frosh team buckles
down to hard scrimmaging lor the
remainder of the week. The '53ers
get their initial test from the junior
varsity.
Not on the original schedule, the
game will precede the Michigan-'
Varsity tiff. Kick-off time is set for
11 o'clock in the Stadium.
"It's up to the boys, if they want
to equal last year's freshman rec
ord. They can do it," saged Coach
Taylor about his latest charges.
Since Stanford returned to football,
Taylor has tutored two frosh squads
and both were undefeated.
Two-a-day practice sessions have
been the order since September 11,
when the Class of '53 first turned
out on the freshman field. The big
turn-out ot 70 has been sliced down
to a little less than 50.
Only major injuries sustained
from the rugged workouts were by
two backs—Jim Cairns, a slipped
disc in the back, and Roy Deffebach,
an old knee re-injured.
Leading the pack in practice, Joe
St. Geme has been the top quarter

back on the all-around, well-bal
anced team. An til-leaguer from
Loyola High in Los Angeles St.
Genie shapes up as a top signal
| caller.
Other standouts at the quarter
spot are Dave E'.dredge, A 1 Colton,
j and Nason Fishback. Diek Gargiulo,
I Loren Hinkelman, Wes Laubscher,
and Tommy Van Sant are top half
back prospects.
Supplying the power in the back
field, Skip Crist and Willie Barmore
are fullback candidates.
Norm Manoogian, an all-city line
man from Dorsey High in Los An
geles, tops the freshmen in the front
line. Other guards are Allen Han
ner, Tom Romano, and Howie Pyle.
Cal Cottriell and Jack Ten Eyck
bolster the center of the line.
Top tackles are Jim Vick, John
I Broderick, Hayden Leason, and Ken
Downey. Flanking the line. Bob
| Hoegh, Dick Sawyer. Ron Eadie,
Ron Wilson, and Bob Thompson
shape up as the best end material.
The Jayvees, with a big edge in
experience and conditioning, should
give the frosh a good tune-up for
j their first regularly scheduled
game with Santa Clara the follow
| ing week.
