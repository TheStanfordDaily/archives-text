# Reynolds-Odom Fellowship Honors Famous Airman
## Well-Known Manufacturer Starts Fund as Memorial to Old Friend 
### 
Establishment of the Mi'ton Rey
nolds-Rill Odom Aeronautical Fel
lowship Fund at Stanford was an
nounced recently by Dr. Wallace
Sterling.
The fund, which will set up five
fellowships for young aeronautical
engineers, was begun with a con
tribution from Mr. Reynolds, inter
nationally known pen and elec
tronic equipment manufacturer.
A supplementary gift to the fund
has been received from the Chicago
section of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers.
LINKS TWO GREAT NAMES
The fund, by training young engi
neers, will perpetuate the memory
of Bill Odom, who died Sept. 5 when
his plane crashed in the Thompson
Trophy race during the National Air
Races at Cleveland.
The fund links two names which
have made aviation history.
Odom, with his long-time asso
ciate, "Tex" Sal'ee, was at the con
trols of the "Feynolds Bombshell,"
with Reynolds as navigator, when
the trio, with a time of 78 hours, 55
minutes and 5 seconds, broke the
round - the - world flight record in
April of 1047. Odom later that same
year broke the solo record for
around - the - world flight in the
"Reynolds Bombshell."
Odom, Sallee, and Reynolds took
part in Reynolds' latest internation
al aviation adventure when in a
four-engine plane, "The Explorer,"
they flew last year to Mt. Amne Ma
fchin in Chinese Tibet and deter
mined that this mystery peak was
31.000 feet high — 2,000 feet higher
than Mt. Everest.
AKOUND-THE-WORLD RECORD
• It was the around - the - world
flight which brought Reynolds and
Odom together into a team which
y/;»s to make spectacular headlines
with long-distance flights.
; This flight confirmed a prophecy
made by Bill as a boy of seven to
his mother while they were living
in Kansas City.
"Some day,"he told her, "I am
roing to set a record by flying
around the world."
The lad repeated the prediction
three years later while watching
Wiley Post work on the plane with
which Post had just made the first
around-the-world flight.
"Someday, Mr. Post, I'm going to
break your record," young Odom
said.
PROPHECY CCME TRUE
Post took a piece of the canvas he
had removed from the plane and
wrote, "To Willie Odom: I hope that
some day you break my round-the
world record. Wiley Post."
When Odom and Reynolds flew
over Alaska in 1947 on their world
pirdling flight, they intended to drop
a wreath, containing this piece of
canvas, over the spot in Alaska
where Post and Will Rogers met
death in the crash of their plane, the

"Winnie Mac." Officers at the Naval
Anchorage Club at Anchorage per
suaded them to leave the wreath
| at the club and it hanes there today.
Reynolds is nationally known as
a pen manufacturer, although the
description bothers him. He has pen
factories in eight foreign countries,
I but his major business interest is
i the American Bosch Corporation,
j which he and a small group of asso
ciates control.

This firm, through its subsidiary,
; Arma Corporation, is engaged in the
production of high-precision elec
tronic equipment used in the Army,
Navy, and Air Force. Five hundred
engineers work at the firm's main
| plant in Brooklyn, N.Y. Reynolds is
also chairman of the Printasign
| Corporation.
Feynolds' son, James M. Reynolds
of Palo Alto, graduated from Stan
ford in 1945 with a degree in engi
neering. Young Jim's wife. Zelta, is
also a Stanford graduate and holds

AKOUND-THE-WORLD RECORD
• It was the around - the - world
flight which brought Reynolds and
Odom together into a team which
y/;»s to make spectacular headlines
with long-distance flights.
; This flight confirmed a prophecy
made by Bill as a boy of seven to
his mother while they were living
in Kansas City.
"Some day,"he told her, "I am
roing to set a record by flying
around the world."
The lad repeated the prediction
three years later while watching
Wiley Post work on the plane with
which Post had just made the first
around-the-world flight.
"Someday, Mr. Post, I'm going to
break your record," young Odom
said.
PROPHECY CCME TRUE
Post took a piece of the canvas he
had removed from the plane and
wrote, "To Willie Odom: I hope that
some day you break my round-the
world record. Wiley Post."
When Odom and Reynolds flew
over Alaska in 1947 on their world
pirdling flight, they intended to drop
a wreath, containing this piece of
canvas, over the spot in Alaska
where Post and Will Rogers met
death in the crash of their plane, the

"Winnie Mac." Officers at the Naval
