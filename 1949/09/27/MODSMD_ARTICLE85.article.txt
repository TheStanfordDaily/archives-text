# Speeded-up Bookstore Line System To Continue Throughout she Week
## 
### 
The Bookstore line system will be (
continued this week to speed up j
textbook purchases. Yesterday the j
line, usually extending outside past l
the west door, moved smoothly so
that the waiting period was fairly
short.
Slips should be filled out before j
the student enters the Bookstore. J
Indicator guides to books needed for |
each course are on a table by the
west door. Veterans should use a j
special form for ordering books, and I

other students should use the small
er slips.
The textbook line is separated by
a rope handrail from the rest of
the Bookstore to prevent crowding
in. There is no line for general
books and supplies, and the front
j door can be used by students pur
j chasing these.
from 11 a.m. <0 1 p.m.
is lunch hour for the Bookstore
staff, so service will be slower be
tween these hours.
