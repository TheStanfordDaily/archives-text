# SUMMER TEARUP
## Campus Roads Given Patches 
### 
Stanford roads took a beating this
summer from excavators and ditch
diggers, and their ultimate repair
will depend upon their relation to
the new Farm road plan. The larg
est amount of work in laying under
ground systems for electricity,
steam, and sewers occurred on Gal
ve7. and Arguello Streets.
On Galvez from Stern Hall to the
steam plant, workers spent the sum
mer months digging up pavement so
that a new steam line could be laid.
The ditch was fil'ed in last week,
and final repair to the road will
come soon, according to Alf E.
Brandin, University business man
ager.
Arguello was hacked up while
workers laid in electric conduits and
sewers, and probably will receive
little attention, according to Bran
din. The reason for neglect of the
street, which runs between Encina
and Toyon, is that its final location
is not assured. Stanford road plans,
which include the ultimate location
and use of Arguello, are now being
studied by the Board of Trustees.
Brandin said that Arguello may
cither be moved a few feel, or aban
doned as far as automobile traffic is
concerned. However, such action
cannot be expected soon, he said,
because there is no money available.
The Stanford long-range plan calls
for a circular road system, and
Brandin said it would be foolish to
repave the streets until their final
use is known, because of expense.
Several streets throughout the
campus received repairs durine the
summer to keep them from being
torn away by traffic. Lagunita Drive
behind the Post Office was one of
these. Palm Drive received a sealer
coat to preserve its surface.
Work on curbs and gutters on
Escondido in the block in front of
Stern will start this week. The
curbing will be constructed far
enough from the center of the road
to permit diagonal parking on each
side.
