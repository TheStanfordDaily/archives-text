Harris Tweed
The natives of the Outer Hebrides have long
been famed for their rather dank climate...
and a cloth admirably designed to resist it:
now Roos Bros has persuaded said natives to
change their traditional brand to a new, jf:» * rt
1 iqhter Harris Tweed ... specially woven for
Cal ifornians. This patch-pocket suit is the J*,: jj
happy outcome. It has all the rugged qua I- /J® #
|ties of conventional Harris Tweed suits,
but weighs far less. And kindly observe the ;1H
cut of the jacket ... broad-shouldered, yes;
but the waist Is cut full, giving the suit a W
wedge-shaped, decidedly husky look.
