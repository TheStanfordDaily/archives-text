# Delegates Return From NSA Meeting
## 
### 
Six delegates, drawn from five
different campus activities, repre
sented Stanford at the Second An
nual National Student Association
Congress held on the University of
Illinois campus during the latter
part of August.
Together with the representatives
from more than 300 other colleges
and universities, they spent ten in
tensive days and nights trading
ideas, learning about situations oth
er students face, and looking for a
way to make NSA ar important
phase of student life on the Farm.
Stanford delegates were: Mickey
Hefter, Cardinals president; Dick
Kelton and Lois Kcister, IIR; Syd
ney Morgan, NSA co-ordinator;
Hank Rosin, ASSU president; and
Bill Swigart, Daily editor. Barbara
Levison attended the convention as
an alternate, and Erskine Childers
was there in his capacity as chair
man of the California, Hawaii, and
Nevada Region.
Meeting first in small 15 - man
roundtables, then in larger "com
missions," and finally convening in
plenary assemblies, the delegates
examined the worth of all the
thoughts they could muster on bet
tering the educational system of the
United States and making it more
.imply serve the needs of each in
dividual student.
The first step taken was that of
acquainting themselves with the
problem areas, by hearing notable
"resource" speakers* including Dr.
Harold Taylor, president, Sarah
Lawrence College; Dr. Francis
Brown, American Council on Edu
cation; George Houser, Committee
on Racial Equality; William Hcync
ker, Dutch Office of Foreign Student
Relations; Dr. Buell Gallagher. U.S.
Office of Education; and Dr. Helen
White, U.S. Commission for UNES
CO.
Along with facts from students
who operated NSA projects last
year, these speakers provided the
background for the formation of
NSA policy for the coming year.
Discussion and decisions on Na
tional Student Association policy
(•entered on discrimination, academ
ic freedom, international affairs, and
federal aid to education.
On minority group bias, repre
sentatives realized that "character
and academic standing arc the only
two qualifications necessary for ad
mission to educational institutions."
They called for legislation against
schools refusing admission to stu

dents because of race, religion, sex,
national origin, political beliefs, and
economic circumstances.
Taking a stand on the eventual
elimination of discrimination which
was called "neither right nor left,"
the NSA adopted the "Michigan
Plan" used at the University of
Michigan. It calls for banning of
any new campus organization with
discriminatory clauses in its consti
tution or charter.
The National Interfraternity C'oun-

oil and the National Panhcllenic
Conference were urged to eliminate
discriminatory clauses within mem
ber social sorority and fraternity
groups.
On federal aid to education, stu
dents were for federal scholarships
and fellowship grants, but didn't
forget limitations they thought it
should have. Aid should not be
discriminatory, and merit and needs
determined according to an objec
tive examinatnon, should be the cri
terion.
NSA defined academic freedom as
the right of a scholar to seek the
truth, discuss his subject, and offer
his conclusions through publication
and classroom instruction.
"Membership in any political, re
ligious, or other organization or ad
herence to any philosophical, politi
cal, or religious belief do not con
stitute in themselves sufficient
grounds for dismissal or failure to

re-hire educators," they declared
flatly.
If universities and colleges have
any ideological qualification for
teaching, they should state it —in
writing—to the teacher, before hir
ing him.
NSA will also continue its pres
ent policy of "efforts of co-operation
on specific projects of a non-politi
cal nature" (such as student foreign
travel) with the Communist-domi
nated International Union of Stu
dents. By an overwhelming vote the
delegates decided that nothing
should be done this year about affil
iating with the lUS.
Virtually every phase of student
life is touched by programs outlined
by the National Student Association.
Increased numbei's of American
students will study, work, and trav
el abroad. More than 1,500 will go
to Denmark alone. Asia, South
America, and Africa will be added
to present travel lists. Students may
be represented on the Fulbright
scholarship committee.
Under consideration arc an inter
national publications clearing house,
international art. festival, interna
tional study tour of India, film ex
change, broadcasts abroad, exchange
of radio, stage scripts, and interna
tional seminar on student life.
Grading systems and faculty rat
ing systems will be evaluated and
students will work for granting of
extra credits to students participat
ing in extra-curricular activities.
The Stanford delegates will make
a report on the convention to the
ASSU Executive Committee.

and fellowship grants, but didn't
forget limitations they thought it
should have. Aid should not be
discriminatory, and merit and needs
determined according to an objec

NSA defined academic freedom as
the right of a scholar to seek the
truth, discuss his subject, and offer
his conclusions through publication
and classroom instruction.
"Membership in any political, re
ligious, or other organization or ad
herence to any philosophical, politi
cal, or religious belief do not con
stitute in themselves sufficient
grounds for dismissal or failure to

re-hire educators," they declared
flatly.
If universities and colleges have
any ideological qualification for
teaching, they should state it —in
writing—to the teacher, before hir
ing him.
NSA will also continue its pres
ent policy of "efforts of co-operation
on specific projects of a non-politi
cal nature" (such as student foreign
travel) with the Communist-domi
nated International Union of Stu
dents. By an overwhelming vote the
delegates decided that nothing
should be done this year about affil
iating with the lUS.
Virtually every phase of student
life is touched by programs outlined
by the National Student Association.
Increased numbei's of American
students will study, work, and trav
el abroad. More than 1,500 will go
to Denmark alone. Asia, South
America, and Africa will be added
to present travel lists. Students may
be represented on the Fulbright
scholarship committee.
Under consideration arc an inter
national publications clearing house,
international art. festival, interna
tional study tour of India, film ex
change, broadcasts abroad, exchange
of radio, stage scripts, and interna
tional seminar on student life.
Grading systems and faculty rat
ing systems will be evaluated and
students will work for granting of
extra credits to students participat
ing in extra-curricular activities.
The Stanford delegates will make
a report on the convention to the
ASSU Executive Committee.

Six delegates, drawn from five
different campus activities, repre
sented Stanford at the Second An
nual National Student Association
Congress held on the University of
Illinois campus during the latter
part of August.
Together with the representatives
from more than 300 other colleges
and universities, they spent ten in
tensive days and nights trading
ideas, learning about situations oth
er students face, and looking for a
way to make NSA ar important
phase of student life on the Farm.
Stanford delegates were: Mickey
Hefter, Cardinals president; Dick
Kelton and Lois Kcister, IIR; Syd
ney Morgan, NSA co-ordinator;
Hank Rosin, ASSU president; and
Bill Swigart, Daily editor. Barbara
Levison attended the convention as
an alternate, and Erskine Childers
was there in his capacity as chair
man of the California, Hawaii, and
Nevada Region.
Meeting first in small 15 - man
roundtables, then in larger "com
missions," and finally convening in
plenary assemblies, the delegates
examined the worth of all the
thoughts they could muster on bet
tering the educational system of the
United States and making it more
.imply serve the needs of each in
dividual student.
The first step taken was that of
acquainting themselves with the
problem areas, by hearing notable
"resource" speakers* including Dr.
Harold Taylor, president, Sarah
Lawrence College; Dr. Francis
Brown, American Council on Edu
cation; George Houser, Committee
on Racial Equality; William Hcync
ker, Dutch Office of Foreign Student
Relations; Dr. Buell Gallagher. U.S.
Office of Education; and Dr. Helen
White, U.S. Commission for UNES
CO.
Along with facts from students
who operated NSA projects last
year, these speakers provided the
background for the formation of
NSA policy for the coming year.
Discussion and decisions on Na
tional Student Association policy
(•entered on discrimination, academ
ic freedom, international affairs, and
federal aid to education.
On minority group bias, repre
sentatives realized that "character
and academic standing arc the only
two qualifications necessary for ad
mission to educational institutions."
They called for legislation against
schools refusing admission to stu

dents because of race, religion, sex,
national origin, political beliefs, and
economic circumstances.
Taking a stand on the eventual
elimination of discrimination which
was called "neither right nor left,"
the NSA adopted the "Michigan
Plan" used at the University of
Michigan. It calls for banning of
any new campus organization with
discriminatory clauses in its consti
tution or charter.
The National Interfraternity C'oun-

oil and the National Panhcllenic
Conference were urged to eliminate
discriminatory clauses within mem
ber social sorority and fraternity
groups.
