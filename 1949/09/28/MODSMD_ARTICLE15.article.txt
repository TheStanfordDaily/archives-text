''I think both the students and
the Bookstore staff are quite happy
with the textbook line as it has been
worked out," commented Mrs. Hel
ena Bauchou, Bookstore manager,
yesterday afternoon after the sec
ond day of its use this quarter.
The line, while often long, usu
ally moved rapidly. Students were
always waited on in sequence, and
usually did not stand in line too
long, she thought. The textbook line
gave more freedom to other depart
ments of the store, enabling them to
serve customers without delay.
The line will probably be contin
ued both this week and next week,
if necessary. The extra clerks will
be retained for two weeks.
Mrs. Bauchou said she thought
there was no material difference in
textbook costs since 1948. Textbooks
which arc listed on the blackboard
inside the store as being out of
stock will, in most cases, be avail
able by Monday.
Service was slowest from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m., lunch hour for the staff.
The line system works effectively,
she said, because an equal number
of clerks and customers arc always
kept on the cast side of the cash
register inside the store. This as
sures that there will not be con
fusion and delay after the cash reg
ister is reached.
Students make out slips listing
the authors and titles of the books
they want before they enter the
Bookstore. Indicator guides arc
available listing the required texts
for most courses, as given to the
Bookstore by the professor.
The textbook line, separated from
other departments ol (he store by a
rope handrail, goes single file from
the cash register out the west door.
A clerk takes the order slip and re
turns with the books when the cash
register is reached.
Before the present system was in
itiated last spring quarter, there was
no organized line for textbooks, but
only a large semi-circle of suffocat
ing students crowding toward the
textbook counter.


THE NEW SINGLE-LINE SYSTEM makes navigation in the Bookstore during reg week not only
possible, but even profitable for first time in years. Extra help will be kept on hand for
another two weeks to insure continued success of the plan.


NOT AS BAD as it looks, the Bookstore line stretches far but moves fast. The new system
will be continued until the rush has subsided, according to Mrs. Helena Bauchou, Bookstore
manager.
