# Victim Goes Home
## 
### 
KENOâ€”Just as spunky as if she
had just pitched her school softball
team to another victory, 14-year-old
Imogene Wittsche went home from
the hospital yesterday.
It had been three long months in
the hospital for Imogene since that
day last June when a speeding ino
torboat ran over her as she swam in
Lake Tahoe.
The alleged operator of the mo
torboat, Phil Davis, an Oakland
automobile dealer, faces criminal
charges in federal court at Sacra
mento, and a $200,000 civil damage
suit at Placerville.
