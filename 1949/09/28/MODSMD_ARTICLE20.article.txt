# Reg Hits 7,590; Ratio Still 3.2
## Lower Division P.E. Enrollment To Be Held Today and Tomorrow 
### 
Registration figures released at 5 p.m. yesterday indicated tiiat
there will be 3.2 men on campus for every one woman. The
figure, contrary to the earlier rumor of an increased ratio, is
exactly the same as that of fall quarter 1948.
After the second day of registration, the totals jumped to 7,590,

about 1,900 more than the 5,648 fig
ure released yesterday. However,
the second-day total this yea/ fell
short of last year's mark by 473.
Registrar H. Donald Winbigler
yesterday afternoon estimated that
300 more students would register
during the rest of the week. He said
this group consists mostly of grad
uate students and a few illness
cases.
It is probable, the registrar said,
that the enrollment may fall 200
short of the "crystal ball" prediction
of 8,100. He is not disappointed with
the lower registration, for Stanford
had hoped to be able to effect a
reduction in its enrollment.
Although most of the students had
completed their registration by noon
yesterday, there were still some;
drifting into the Pavilion up to 5:45,
the deadline for registration books
to be returned. A $2 fee will be
charged for books handed in after
that time.
Dr. Winbigler called attention to
the new registration procedure for
physical education courses. Thi:i
year the lower division physical ed
ucation courses which are required
were not to be listed on the study
lists by the specific names.
Instead, lower division students
are expected to enroll for the spe
cific physical education courses to
day and tomorrow. The women have
already made appointments for the
enrollment procedure, but the men
should report to the Athletic De
partment and make the required ar
rangements.
Registration officials explained the
procedure in changing the study list
after the registration books have
been filed. Students should file a
revised study list form with all
proper signatures in the Registrar's
office within two weeks after the
class schedule begins. Only by so
doing, Winbigler asserted, can the
study lists be made official.
This year's registration was "the
smoothest we've ever had," Dr.
Winbigler said yesterday after the
lines closed. "By trial and error wo
have finally removed the bugs from
the scheme," he added.
He attributed a great deal of the
efliciecy to his staff of early 80 stu
dents and stenographers who direct
ed lines, gave out books, stamped
forms, and received the completed
books.
Until noon yesterday the registra
tion was carried out by sending the
lines into the auditorium. But in
the afternoon many of the girls weir
spending their time knitting while
the stragglers walked directly into
the lobby to pick up their registra
tion books.

300 more students would register
during the rest of the week. He said
this group consists mostly of grad
uate students and a few illness
cases.
It is probable, the registrar said,
that the enrollment may fall 200
short of the "crystal ball" prediction
of 8,100. He is not disappointed with
the lower registration, for Stanford
had hoped to be able to effect a
reduction in its enrollment.
Although most of the students had
completed their registration by noon
yesterday, there were still some;
drifting into the Pavilion up to 5:45,
the deadline for registration books
to be returned. A $2 fee will be
charged for books handed in after
that time.
Dr. Winbigler called attention to
the new registration procedure for
physical education courses. Thi:i
year the lower division physical ed
ucation courses which are required
were not to be listed on the study
lists by the specific names.
Instead, lower division students
are expected to enroll for the spe
cific physical education courses to
day and tomorrow. The women have
already made appointments for the
enrollment procedure, but the men
should report to the Athletic De
partment and make the required ar
rangements.
Registration officials explained the
procedure in changing the study list
after the registration books have
been filed. Students should file a
revised study list form with all
proper signatures in the Registrar's
office within two weeks after the
class schedule begins. Only by so
doing, Winbigler asserted, can the
study lists be made official.
This year's registration was "the
smoothest we've ever had," Dr.
Winbigler said yesterday after the
lines closed. "By trial and error wo
have finally removed the bugs from
the scheme," he added.
He attributed a great deal of the
efliciecy to his staff of early 80 stu
dents and stenographers who direct
ed lines, gave out books, stamped
forms, and received the completed
books.
Until noon yesterday the registra
tion was carried out by sending the
lines into the auditorium. But in
the afternoon many of the girls weir
spending their time knitting while
the stragglers walked directly into
the lobby to pick up their registra
tion books.
Registration figures released at 5 p.m. yesterday indicated tiiat
there will be 3.2 men on campus for every one woman. The
figure, contrary to the earlier rumor of an increased ratio, is
exactly the same as that of fall quarter 1948.
After the second day of registration, the totals jumped to 7,590,

about 1,900 more than the 5,648 fig
ure released yesterday. However,
the second-day total this yea/ fell
short of last year's mark by 473.
