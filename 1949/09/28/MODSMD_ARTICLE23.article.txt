Tor tho .second lime in two years The Daily
changes Iho s :?e of ils format. In winter quar
ter of 1918 we switched to a five-column tab
loid paper. This volume, much to the disap
pointment of ma.iy breakfast-table and class
room readers, we're right back where we
started w'lh a standard eight-column page.
Many people have asked us why.
If you find the larger paper difficult to
handle we hope you'll bear with us. There's
no right or wrong about the size of a news
paper. l-.'s strictly a matter of opinion as to
which one best fulfills the requirements. Each
has its advantages and disadvantages.
Except for the last three volumes and for a
short period during the war, The Daily has
been published as an eight-column paper for
nearly 30 year 3.
The switch was made to the tabby in order
to encourage belter writing by Daily reporters.
There was a feeling among editorial board
members at that time that reporters were pad
ding their sicries needlessly in order to fill
out the space assigned them. If stories were
not long, they felt, The Daily would be a
hodgepodge of club announcements and short
news storie3. Makeup would resemble a
checkerboard.
We disagree. With a little imagination and
the proper use of pictures and cartoons, any

paper can be made attractive, regardless of
how short the stories t are. The larger page
gives us more flexibility in makeup. We can
use more pictures, larger pictures. Important
stories can be given better display. It will be
a livelier Daily this year.
The ends will not be chopped off important
stories because of lack of room on the page
to run them. People or organizations with
news to print will not be denied space while
uninteresting feature stories clutter up the
editorial page.
As a matter of policy we will not give regu
lar columns or "little corners" to any person
or organization regardless of whether they
have any news to print or not. Our space is
at a premium. We must use it for news, and
news alone.
Mechanically, we gain about 20 column
inches with the switch. We can use that space.
Eight - page papers are possible with the
standard-size page. Our press will accommo
date only twelve small or the equivalent of
six standard pages when printing a tabloid.
Finally, we will no longer have to refuse
six- and eight-column advertising as we did
last year.
Everything considered, we think we can
best serve the interests of the student body
by using the standard-size page. That's why
we changed back.

members at that time that reporters were pad
ding their sicries needlessly in order to fill
out the space assigned them. If stories were
not long, they felt, The Daily would be a
hodgepodge of club announcements and short
news storie3. Makeup would resemble a
checkerboard.
We disagree. With a little imagination and
the proper use of pictures and cartoons, any

paper can be made attractive, regardless of
how short the stories t are. The larger page
gives us more flexibility in makeup. We can
use more pictures, larger pictures. Important
stories can be given better display. It will be
a livelier Daily this year.
The ends will not be chopped off important
stories because of lack of room on the page
to run them. People or organizations with
news to print will not be denied space while
uninteresting feature stories clutter up the
editorial page.
As a matter of policy we will not give regu
lar columns or "little corners" to any person
or organization regardless of whether they
have any news to print or not. Our space is
at a premium. We must use it for news, and
news alone.
Mechanically, we gain about 20 column
inches with the switch. We can use that space.
Eight - page papers are possible with the
standard-size page. Our press will accommo
date only twelve small or the equivalent of
six standard pages when printing a tabloid.
Finally, we will no longer have to refuse
six- and eight-column advertising as we did
last year.
Everything considered, we think we can
best serve the interests of the student body
by using the standard-size page. That's why
we changed back.
