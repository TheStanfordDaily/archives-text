# KZSU Broadcasts Appeal To Aspiring Radio Workers
## 
### 
KZSU, "880 on Your Dial," has sent out the call for all types
of radio workers, especially salesman, says Mary Hill, manager
of the campus radio station.
During registration, booths were placed on campus to intro
duce interested students to KZSU. Today, tomorrow, and Friday

3 to 5 p.m., tours will be con
ducted through the KZSU studio,
offices, and engineering rooms at
the rear of Memorial Auditorium.
Prospective workers and those
merely curious are invited to join
the tours and view KZSU's modern
equipment, announced Miss Hill.
Chuck Black, program director,
said that announcing auditions will
be held in the studio during the
same hours. At 5 p.m. Friday, a
general meeting will be held in the
Little Theater for present, past, and
prospective members. Questions re
garding KZSU operation and mem
bership will be answered there.
Besides salesmen, KZSU needs
include announcers, engineers, ac
tors, script writers, publicity men,
producers, and office workers. Miss
Hill advised that no experience is
necessary to join the staff, which
usually numbers around 150. She
explained that most KZSU workers
receive only experience and fun as
compensation. Sales workers, how
ever, collect a 10 per cent commis
sion on all air time they sell to
sponsors.
Regular broadcasting will begin
Sunday. KZSU is on the air from
7 to 11 every night except Saturday
over 880 kilocycles. As a special
event, however, all freshman foot
ball games played in the Stanford
stadium will be broadcast by KZSU,
beginning this Saturday afternoon.
The station is licensed by the
Federal Communications Commis
sio as a carrier current station, or
"wired wireless." Broadcasting is
not done through a tower antenna,
but through a network of wires
which run to strategic campus
points and to Stanford Village. Be
cause of this system, the station can
be heard only on campus and ut
the Village.
Using the call letters KSU, the
campus station began operations in
a tiny i abandoned Army booth al
Stanford Village during winter
quarter of 1947. In a little more than
two and a half years, it has grown
to be the largest commercial college
station in the Southwest, and is the
Southwest regional office for the In
tereollegiate Broadcasting System.
KZSU is owned by the University
and operated entirely by students.
It owns all of its own equipment,
including a remote unit capable of
broadcasting from almost any place
on campus. It was the first Western
college station to become fully com
mercial.
In past seasons, KZSU has in
formed and entertained the campus
with almost every type of program
that can lie found on a regular com
mercial station. Perennials include a
"soap opera" and the notorious
"Stanford Sadie," who has for two
years lured Stanford roughs away
from their studies. Director Black
has several new programs in the
offing, and says that he is on the
prowl for people with new ideas.

merely curious are invited to join
the tours and view KZSU's modern
equipment, announced Miss Hill.
Chuck Black, program director,
said that announcing auditions will
be held in the studio during the
same hours. At 5 p.m. Friday, a
general meeting will be held in the
Little Theater for present, past, and
prospective members. Questions re
garding KZSU operation and mem
bership will be answered there.
Besides salesmen, KZSU needs
include announcers, engineers, ac
tors, script writers, publicity men,
producers, and office workers. Miss
Hill advised that no experience is
necessary to join the staff, which
usually numbers around 150. She
explained that most KZSU workers
receive only experience and fun as
compensation. Sales workers, how
ever, collect a 10 per cent commis
sion on all air time they sell to
sponsors.
Regular broadcasting will begin
Sunday. KZSU is on the air from
7 to 11 every night except Saturday
over 880 kilocycles. As a special
event, however, all freshman foot
ball games played in the Stanford
stadium will be broadcast by KZSU,
beginning this Saturday afternoon.
The station is licensed by the
Federal Communications Commis
sio as a carrier current station, or
"wired wireless." Broadcasting is
not done through a tower antenna,
but through a network of wires
which run to strategic campus
points and to Stanford Village. Be
cause of this system, the station can
be heard only on campus and ut
the Village.
Using the call letters KSU, the
campus station began operations in
a tiny i abandoned Army booth al
Stanford Village during winter
quarter of 1947. In a little more than
two and a half years, it has grown
to be the largest commercial college
station in the Southwest, and is the
Southwest regional office for the In
tereollegiate Broadcasting System.
KZSU is owned by the University
and operated entirely by students.
It owns all of its own equipment,
including a remote unit capable of
broadcasting from almost any place
on campus. It was the first Western
college station to become fully com
mercial.
In past seasons, KZSU has in
formed and entertained the campus
with almost every type of program
that can lie found on a regular com
mercial station. Perennials include a
"soap opera" and the notorious
"Stanford Sadie," who has for two
years lured Stanford roughs away
from their studies. Director Black
has several new programs in the
offing, and says that he is on the
prowl for people with new ideas.
