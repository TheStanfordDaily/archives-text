Students at San Francisco State
College probably will fail their
studies as often as anyone; but part
of the sting may be removed by a
new plan called ''Hunk insurance."
Authors of the plan, members of
the Alpha Phi Gamma journalistic
fraternity, have worked out risk
tables according to classes and
grade-point averages. The higher a
student's scholarship, the lower the
risk and premium.
A student with an average scho
lastic rating, for example, would pay
50 cents for his coverage on a par
ticular course. If he flunks, he
would be paid back $1. All incom
ing frosh will be charged a flat 50-
cent rate.
Any dividends on the flunk in
surance will go toward a scholarship
for an outstanding high-school jour
nalist.
