Everybody who is anybody these days has been making a wild grab to
climb aboard Stanford's new football bandwagon. Whether the wagon
stays full alter next Saturday's game remains to be seen. But no matter,
quite a few nice adjectives have already been dusted oil to describe the
"new" Indians.
For instance, Bill Leiser, sports editor of the Chronicle, put his feelings
into a Chinese vein by stating that this is "The Year ot (he Howe ring
Sophomore."
Dick Hyland, football specialist for the L.A. Times ami formerly a Stan
lord grid star known as Tricky Dick, tried some of Leiser's mood by
calling it"The Year of No Excuses."
Koy Bullet Baker, who scouted the Harvard game for USC's Trojans,
was quoted as saying that Stanford now has the jame running and passing
threats as in the year of Albert the Great, 1940.
Bob Braclunan, football scribe for the Examiner and usually a Berkeley
Bear at heart, came up with "Michigan's Wtil verities Had Better Be Ready.
Stanford Is."
Jiinmy Cain, referee of the Harvard game and once a smooth-running
halfback for the Washington Huskies, went completely oil the deep end
witlh the statement that this Stanford team has better timing than any
football squad he has ever seen play.
Hiilifoarri, Valpey Issue Warning
However, wiser heads, such as Coach Bill Hubbard of San Jose and
Art Valpey of Harvard, issue warning that the Indians still have a long
road to travel before they become a great ballclub.
Marchie Schwartz, himself, says he still doesn't know what his boys
can really do. "Michigan will be the test," he repeats over and over.
And that in itself is really something. Two years ago or even two weeks
ago not even a Daily sports scribe would have dared mention Michigan
and Stanford in the same breath.
Now, the bookmakers are lating the Wolverines a slight 7-point choice,
and many figure that Michigan's 24-ganie win streak may have reached
the end of the line.
Big Jim on Conference Blacklist
ODDS AND ENDS TO OPEN THE QUARTER: Big Jim Reynolds, one
of the main reasons behind Stanfords' football strength, has been put on
the Conference black list. That is, Jim can't talk, even so much as
whisper to a high-school athlete without Vic Schmidt pouncing on Stan
ford with a football fine. Actually, the reasons given for such action are
unfounded, silly, and stupid
Spotted in the Registration lines on Monday, Iron Gay Bryan was
full ol praise lor the Track and Field shows put on this summer by
Sweden. Bryan should be. In 17 nights, Gay competed in 14 meets and
won prizes enough to parallel a Stop the Music champ. His goods range
all the way from fancy suitcases to a Swiss imported three-gear bicycle
Southpaw Frank Hamilton, rumored to be taking Ids horsehide mastery
to Princetons Tigers, is back on campus. Hamilton, who was the hottest
frosh hurler on the Coast last season, should be the number one chucker
on Lverett Deans varsity next season.
Aubrey Devine, the quarterback who waved the mystic wand last
season to defeat UCLA and so end a two-year football famine drew an
adverse decision from the Conference eligibility committee this season,
but he will stick around to help coach. Aubrey always did have the brains
if not the arm, to make a truly great quarter.
