# Wolverines Risk Streak Against Determined Cards
## Stanford Bids For National Spotlight 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's hopeful gridders will
be handed a golden opportunity to
leap smack into the center of the
national football spotlight this Sat
urday when they meet the invasion
of the bloodthirsty Wolverines of
Michigan University.
The Michigans currently can
boast of one of the longest win
streaks in "big school" grid history.
Their string of victories now stands
at 24, culminating in last week's
7-3 defensive win over their cross
state rivals, Michigan Slate.
They haven't been beaten since
Illinois turned the trick. 13-9. way
back in the mid-season of 1946.
49-13 IN '47
The Midwesterners' impressive
record, incidentally, includes a
thumping 49-13 win over Stanford
in 1947, the last time the two schools
met. It also lists a Rose Bowl romp,
again by 49-0, over the Trojans of
USC on New Year's Day of 1948.
For the Indians, therefore, Sat
urday's battle will be an effort +o
redeem lost prestige for Stanford in
particular and the West Coast in
general.
The post-war years have seen the
Midwest dominate the national grid
picture, but a Farm victory Satur
day would go a long way toward
getting the Pacific Coast back into
the act.
ALL-AMERICAN TACKLE
It'll be the same story, second
verse, for Marchie's men Saturday
when, for the second consecutive
week, their opponent will be
sparked by an All-American tackle
Last time it was Harvard's Howard
Houston. This week, they'll face Al
vin Wistert, a husky, 33-year-old
former soap salesman who captains
the Wolverine pack.
As a matter of fact, the tackle
slots are probably the strongest
spots in Michigan's rock-ribbed for
ward wall. Wistert and Allen Wahl,
both first-string holdovers from last
year, are the •"ack's best both on of
fense and defense.
But Bennie Oosterbaan's club is
almost as power-packed in the oth
er positions, too. Bennies got veter
ans for practically every slot, in
cluding such stars as end Ozzie
Clark, fullback Tommy Peterson
who led the Wolverines_4Ji scoring
last season, halfbacks Chuck Ort
mann and Leo Koceski, and a host
of others.
These are the same lads who led
the Pack to both Western Confer
ence and national titles last year; so
that gives a pretty good idea of the
Michigan potentialities for 1949.
23 FIRST DOWNS PER GAME
The localites will be facing a team
which scored 252 points in 1948
while its opponents managed to ring
the bell for 41, averaged 23 first
downs per game, and gained a total
of more than 2,000 yards during the
year.
Peterson, as mentioned before,
was the leading scorer during the
perfect season, while Koceski had
slightly the better average on rush
ing, netting 3.84 yards per try.

state rivals, Michigan Slate.
They haven't been beaten since
Illinois turned the trick. 13-9. way
back in the mid-season of 1946.
49-13 IN '47
The Midwesterners' impressive
record, incidentally, includes a
thumping 49-13 win over Stanford
in 1947, the last time the two schools
met. It also lists a Rose Bowl romp,
again by 49-0, over the Trojans of
USC on New Year's Day of 1948.
For the Indians, therefore, Sat
urday's battle will be an effort +o
redeem lost prestige for Stanford in
particular and the West Coast in
general.
The post-war years have seen the
Midwest dominate the national grid
picture, but a Farm victory Satur
day would go a long way toward
getting the Pacific Coast back into
the act.
ALL-AMERICAN TACKLE
It'll be the same story, second
verse, for Marchie's men Saturday
when, for the second consecutive
week, their opponent will be
sparked by an All-American tackle
Last time it was Harvard's Howard
Houston. This week, they'll face Al
vin Wistert, a husky, 33-year-old
former soap salesman who captains
the Wolverine pack.
As a matter of fact, the tackle
slots are probably the strongest
spots in Michigan's rock-ribbed for
ward wall. Wistert and Allen Wahl,
both first-string holdovers from last
year, are the •"ack's best both on of
fense and defense.
But Bennie Oosterbaan's club is
almost as power-packed in the oth
er positions, too. Bennies got veter
ans for practically every slot, in
cluding such stars as end Ozzie
Clark, fullback Tommy Peterson
who led the Wolverines_4Ji scoring
last season, halfbacks Chuck Ort
mann and Leo Koceski, and a host
of others.
These are the same lads who led
the Pack to both Western Confer
ence and national titles last year; so
that gives a pretty good idea of the
Michigan potentialities for 1949.
23 FIRST DOWNS PER GAME
The localites will be facing a team
which scored 252 points in 1948
while its opponents managed to ring
the bell for 41, averaged 23 first
downs per game, and gained a total
of more than 2,000 yards during the
year.
Peterson, as mentioned before,
was the leading scorer during the
perfect season, while Koceski had
slightly the better average on rush
ing, netting 3.84 yards per try.
Stanford's hopeful gridders will
be handed a golden opportunity to
leap smack into the center of the
national football spotlight this Sat
urday when they meet the invasion
of the bloodthirsty Wolverines of
Michigan University.
The Michigans currently can
boast of one of the longest win
streaks in "big school" grid history.
Their string of victories now stands
at 24, culminating in last week's
7-3 defensive win over their cross
state rivals, Michigan Slate.
