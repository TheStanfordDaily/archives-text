# Dave Dahle Starts For Oakland Oaks
## 
### 
Dave Dahle, Stanford's star pitcher
on last Spring's baseball squad, got
his first pitching assignment in the
Coast League Sunday afternoon,
when he opened on the mound for
Oakland against Portland in the first
game of a double-header.
Dahle, who was strike-out king of
the CIBA last season, struck out five
men in the five innings that he
worked. He gave up six runs and
10 hits to be charged with the loss
as the Oaks bowed eight to four.
