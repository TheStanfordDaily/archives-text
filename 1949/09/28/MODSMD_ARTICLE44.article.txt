## Cards Try New Plays Surprise in Store For Mighty Michigan 
### 
Michigan's Wolverines will be in
for a surprise Saturday if some of
the new Card stunts come off as
planned and executed in yesterday's
practice session.
The stunts, definitely not of the
rooting section variety, were in
stalled Monday and tried out again
yesterday. If all goes well, they will
be sprung Saturday. They are on
the hush - hush list, and practices
have been closed to all but the press
to keep them so.
BORUCK TO MISS PRACTICE
Coach Marchie Schwartz, who has
awaited the usual rash of injuries,
received the fix-st serious shock of
the season Monday when halfback
Holy Boruck carne up with a
sprained ankle. He will not practice
this week but may suit up Saturday.
Veterans A 1 Rau and A 1 Laakso
were also out of yesterday's practice
with injuries; Rau with a broken
rib and Laakso with a lame ankle.
Both are expected to be able to go
against Michigan.
Most of yesterday's practice was
given over to scrimmages against
the frosh, with the varsity concen
trating on pass protection for quar
terbacks Tom Shaw, Gary Kerko
rian, and Dick Horn. All three lads
threw well, but the sideline observ
ers were noticing the improved
blocking of Rupe Andrews and the
running of halfback John Banks.
IMPROVEMENT .NEEDED
Yesterday and Monday the squad
members saw the movies of last
week's Harvard game. They only
served to remind most of them what
they already knew: that they would
have to play a lot better brand of
ball if they were to upset the na
tional champion Michigan team.
Schwartz has indicated no major
switches in the lineup after seeing
the movies. But Rau's injury may
cause the big tackle to give over
some of his playing time to such as
Hal Walker and Wes Poulson, both
of whom have looked good in the
first two games.
Headman Schwartz will probably
cut down somewhat on the "pla
toon" system that he has used in
the past two weeks. He will use

veterans Dave Field and Ken Peck |
as defensive halfbacks with Harry
Hugasian also playing safety in ad
dition to his offensive chores.
