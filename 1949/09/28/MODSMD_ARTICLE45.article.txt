# Marchie Vetoes Suggested Name For New Baby
## 
### 
Coach Marchie Schwartz' newest
quarterback, a 7-pound 4-ounce boy, |
was a topic of the after-game press
talks by Schwartz.
Marchie, always a hard man from j
whom to finagle a quote concerning j
a Stanford player before looking at j
the movies of the game, was asked i
how he liked Bill DeYoung's play.
"I liked it very much," he said.
"Why don't you name the new
baby 'DeYoung Schwartz"?" queried
the reporter.
"I'll have to think that over,"
smiled Marchie.
To which the reporter replied, I
"Why. do you want to see the movies j
first?"
