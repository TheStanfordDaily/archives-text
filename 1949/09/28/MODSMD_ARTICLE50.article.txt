When Alfred R. Sumner received
an appointment to the Stanford

University faculty, he solved the
problem of transporting his wife and
two children 3,000 miles across the
continent by buying an airplane and
flying them to Palo Alto.
Dr. Sumner, who will be an acting
professor of geography at Stanford
this year, also combined the move
by air from New Hampshire to Cal
ifornia with some professional ob
servations.
"Geography is my field, and it's
my feeling that geographers should
see as much country as possible. I
find a trip by air is one of the best
ways of doing this," he says.
Dr. Sumner has had more than 10
years of flying experience, including
wartime service as a navigator with
the Naval Air Transport Service on
the San Francisco to Manila run.
