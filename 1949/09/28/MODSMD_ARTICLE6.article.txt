# Coal Mine Strike
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH-Non-union bitu
minous mines guarded heavily by
state police went back into produc
tion in western Pennsylvania today,
openly defying John L. Lewis' strik
ing United Mine Workers.
The five-county Clearfield area
northeast of Pittsburgh became a
powder keg in the nationwide "no
pension, no work" walkouts of
Lewis' 480,000 miners. The nine
day-old strike developed from sus
pension of UMW welfare fund pay
ments because Southern operators
shut off 20-cent-a-ton royalty pay
ments in their fight with Lewis over
a new contract.
