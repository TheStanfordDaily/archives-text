# Stern Holds First Meet
## 
### 
Stern Hall will hear an informal
talk on the rejuvenated Big Red
Machine by Coach Marchie
Schwartz tomorrow night. Other
guests who will appear in the dorm's
open air court to meet the resi
dents will be Dr. Wallace Sterling,
Dean Lawrence Kimpton, and Rich
ard L. Balch, the new Men's Coun
selor.
The hall's first social gathering
will begin at 7 p.m. During the
session, a provisional committee will
be chosen to lead the dorm activi
ties until an executive committee
can be elected.
Two days' work this week on the
new building has brought many im
provements. The windows have
been washed and the halls swept.
Door knobs and window panes have
been placed in the hall doors and
every room is complete except for
desks, according to Miss Patricia
Davidson, resident director. Lino
leum is lacking in two units because
of a strike among layers, but this
condition will not be corrected until
the Christmas vacation.
Miss Pat said the desks are ex
pected this week, possibly today.
Residents hope to have public tele
phones in their new air-conditioned
phone booths by tomorrow. The
telephone company is now installing
a cable to hook up the hall with the
Toyon switchboard.
On the outside of Stem, workers
have terraced and graded the land
and cleaned away the refuse from
the entrance. Curbing is being
placed on Escondido in front of the
hall to facilitate parking.
