# Marchie Expects Michigan Surprise Attacks on Cards
## 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
Coach Marchmont Schwartz and
staff are making no pretenses of
knowing just what attack Michigan
will throw at the Cards Saturday.
End coach and scout Mai Elward,
fresh off the plane from scouting the
Michigan - Michigan State game,
brought back a good report but in
all likelihood it will avail the In
dians little.
Schwartz, when asked what type
offense he is propping for, answered,
"Everything. When you play Michi
gan you have to be ready to have
the book thrown at you. That's the
way they do things."
El ward's report stated that no less
than seven Michigan backs took a
hand in the pass-throwing business
last week. When you play a team

with that many men tossing the ball
you don't have much of a chancc
to watch for any one pass pattern.
Schwartz, still unwilling to com
ment on the probable outcome of
the game, says that he thinks his
boys can beat Michigan "if we play
up to our potential."
Stanford's defensive setup is a
tight secret, but it is widely known
that Michigan State limited the
Wolverines to but 89 yards on the
ground and allowed but eight com
pleted passes in 18 tries.
They did this by throwing an
eight - man line against the na
tional champs and by so doing
rushed the highly rated Chuck Ort
mann off his feet when he tried to
pass.
This is the same defense the Phil
adelphia Eagles threw at the All—

Stars last August. You might say it
vworkcd, to the tunc of 38 to 0 with
the All-Stars getting the goose egg.
But Bennie Ooostcrbaan is coach
enough to know that other teams
will be quick to try a like defense.
So the Schwartzmen are just
about back where they started. They
know Michigan is a veteran-stocked
team that likes to run. They beat
their opponents in much the same
fashion that Stanford has won its
first two games. Run 'cm to death
with great team speed and throw
enough passes to keep 'em loose.
Neither of Stanford's quarter
backs has been forced to show much
of the Card aerial attack. Indian
backs have been able to tear off
huge chunks of yardage on the
ground and the passes have been
more or less extra.
In fact so many backs have been
used that, though the Cards lead the
Conference in total and rushing of
fense, the highest Card individual
yard-gainer is in sixth place. Harry
Hugasian is that man with 138 yards
gained in 22 carries.
The same thing applies to the
passers. March ic has used four
quarterbacks in each of the two
games to date. Gary Kcrkorian has
10 completions in 17 tries for fifth
place; he has 102 yards and a .588
completion percentage.
Tom Shaw has attempted only 10
passes, but lie's completed six ant!
is in eighth place in that depart
ment. He has 104 yards and a .600
completion average.
Tom Kingsford of Montana and
Bob Gambold arc running one-two
in the completion department, with
15 and 13 respectively, and Gam
bold's tossing has gained the phe
nomenal total of 338 yards in two
iamcs—but both of these boys have
oarticipatcd in virtually every of
fensive play; Shaw and Kcrkorian
in on'y about a quarter.
This argues well for the team
ability of the squad. For the first
time in years, Stanford leads the
PCC in total offense and rushing,
and total defense and rushing de
fense. They rank a poor fifth in the
passing defense department, but arc
second in passing offense. In regard
to the latter, San Jose State and
Harvard completed 17 of 3fi passes
against the Cards. It might, be
pointed out that many of these were
made in the late periods when the
reserves were on duty. Saturday's


TOM PKTIOKSON, stocky Im
pound Michigan fullback, led the
Wolverines in scoring l last year.
Peterson racked up nine touch
downs and one aftcrpoint for a
grand total of 55. lie is fast, a fine
spinner, and the most deceptive
man on the Ann Arbor squad.
