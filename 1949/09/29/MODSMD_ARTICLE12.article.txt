# Excom OK's Campaign For Band Trip North
## Vote of Thanks Given Pre-Reg Committee for Work; Women's Residence Summer Club Fund Consolidated 
### 
Excom last night granted the Stanford Band permission to*
put on a campaign for funds to send the Band to Seattle for
the Stanford-Washington game October 15. Goal for the drive
has been set at $4,000.
"We (Excom) hope the student body will really support this
drive," said ASSU President Hank*

Rosin. "The Band made a great
showing at the Harvard game. It
looked and sounded like the best
band in years .... a real credit to
the University and our team.
"The Band deserves that trip,''
said Rosin, "and the team deserves
their support."
Norm Hamilton, band manager,
appeared before Excom to outline
the band's plans for the drive. He
said that University officials had
voiced confidence in the plan and
that the $4,000 goal would be suffi
cient to field a 90-piecc band at
Seattle.
At last night's Excom meeting, the
first of the quarter, Rosin informally
addressed the representatives, com
menting that this Excom is prob
ably the first real peacetime student
government, in view of the average
age of the group.
Excom adopted a formal vote of
thanks to the Prc-Rcg committees
for their excellent work, financially
and managerially.
Excom last night incorporated into
the by-laws of the ASSU Consti
tution the proposition that the money
from Women's Residence Summer
Club Fund for the past 10 years be
consolidated into one fund at the
close of each summer session for
the use of the following Summer
Club Fund.
The following appointments to be
made were discussed: Union Board
of Governors, student member; Stu
dent Health Committee, six mem
bers; Union Planning Committee,
eight members; Student-University
Employment Committee, four mem

hers; Election Board Chairman; and
Men's Housing Committee.
Committees-in-Exeom discussed
were: By-laws and Reprinting; Con
stitutions and Charters; and Ath
letics.
Excom approved the appointments
of George Jaidar, Jay Hughes, Jim
Scott, and Frank Rohncr as assistant
yell-leaders. Also approved were
winged-S awards for the Flying
Club, pending investigation to de
termine whether all award-winners
were registered in the University at
the time of their participating in
competition.
Excom affirmed its previous allot
ment of $143 to the I Club for use in
serving refreshments at the club's
functions. I Club is the only excep
tion to Excom's policy against allot
ing ASSU funds for refreshments.
The exception is made on the ground
that the club is a .social club ex
isting for the sole purpose of pro
moting greater understanding be
tween foreign and American stu
dents, thus serving all students.
Dave Chan, I Club vice-presidcnt,
and A 1 Brennan, secretary, spoke
for the club.
Excom agreed to loan Women's
Row Excom $747 to finance a carni
val on October 14. The carnival is

"This is only a loan," Student

sized. ' We are not underwriting the
carnival."
Lilienthal also brought up the mat

foreign scholarship student, and to
send others to selected high schools.
