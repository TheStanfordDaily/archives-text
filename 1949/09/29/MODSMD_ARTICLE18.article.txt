# On Closed Football Practice

"Secret Practice All Week. Press Only!"
For the first time since he took over as head
coach in 1342, Marchie Schwartz has closed
varsity football practice to all but accredited
press representatives.
We think ho has acted wisely.
Practice sessions at nearly every other col
lege and university in the country are tradi
tionally carried on behind closed gates. At
Harvard, not even the press is admitted. Stu
dent police at the University of Illinois re
fused us admission on the first day of prac
tice -when picture-taking and loosening-up
calesthenics, not intricate play formations,
were the order ot the day.
Yet, in spite of all this, Marchie frankly hated
to close his practices. He felt that students,
alumni, and team followers who were inter
ested enough to come out to the midweek
sessions should be admitted.
Only the suspicion that some of Stanford's
new plays and supposedly secret defenses
have been getting out to opponents before
hand ha 3 forced him to change his mind.
When some alumni followers who had not
seen any of the practices approached him

several weeks ago and asked him about the
new, "highly secret" defense that he intended
to use against San Jose State, it was the pro
verbial last straw.
Stanford practice sessions hdve been re
stricted, in theory at least, for years. Persons
have been asked to show student body cards
or some other proof that they at least were not
scouts for the opponents.
In practice almost anybody could, and did,
get in. As sports columnist Will Connolly
dryly put it, Pappy Waldorf himself could
have sat in on the Stanford sessions the week
before the Big Game last year. Â»
And there's another angle to it, too. Ath
letic News Director Don Liebendorfer points
out that spectators are apt to get in the way
and hamper the efficiency of the team. Loud
talking on the sidelines makes it hard for the
boys to hear their coaches, and in scrimmages
there's always a tendency to play for the
crowd.
Marchie thinks that by closing practices he
can have the team ready to play its best foot
ball on Saturdays. He hopes the students
and alumni will understand.
