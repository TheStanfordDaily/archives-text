# Speed Up Those Lines
## 
### 
Eight thousand tickets are quite a few to sell
through only two Pavilion ticket windows even
if three days are alloted for the distribution.
The many students who waited in line for
more than an hour to buy student tickets to
the Michigan game discovered this yesterday.
When rooters' tickets to the Cel. (JSC, and
other remaining games are distributed next
week, the selling problem becomes more com
plex. Lines will move even more slowly.
The Daily suggests that two more booths
be pressed into service, for the first day of
the sale at least, to facilitate the handling of
these tickets. The University has gone a long
way toward eliminating congestion at the
Bookstore and in the reg lines. How about
doing something about those ticket lines?
