# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
These are the times when everybody is trying out
for something. And these are also times when every
thing is ltying to get somebody.
From Stanford Players to Stanford Crew, they're
all out to catch their share, hoping to trap some

unsuspecting frosh.
The Chaparral, called a humor
magazine for want of a better ad
jective, tried to get the jump on
the rest of us yesterday by having
its editor write a letter to the edi
tor of The Daily.
John Motheral, that's the Chap
pie editor's name, was complain
ing about having to pay one
buck-tv enty for the right to root
at the Harvard and Michigan
games.
It was obviously a publicity

;;tunt, drummed up by Chaparral heads to influence
the public- that they have the people's best interests
at heai I.
Don't |;e fooled. The Chappie's only interest is in
nicking the student body one quarter per at the
beginning of each month, and what do you get for it
-nothing but a bunch of worn-out gags and a pic
ture of a queen, which always makes you think
either that the wrong girl had been chosen or that

the photographer just hadn't gotten the hang of hi;;
camera yet.
But, here at The Daily Shack, we really take a
sincere interest in the student's welfare. Sure we do.
In going all-out to establish reasons why the
Frosh should drop around to the Shack, Bill Swigart,
that's The Daily editor's name, asked me to explain
the face which has been inclosed in this column for
the past few mornings.
Actually, it's a fake. Nobody could look that bad.
It's used only to scare away George Velliotes, Pris
cilla Claudius, and Jan van Gindertael.
Absolutely, there are no convicts, ex-cons, or
would-be Dan Dt.tryeas on the staff. So that explains
the picture.
If 1 might offer a sincere suggestion on how to
handle these try outs for various hungry organizations.
1t would be this:
Look them all over carefully. Visit the Quad.
Try Rally Com. See KSU, I mean KZSU. Judge
them all. Decide which can yive you what you want.
And then, after you make your final decision, forget
it.
Back calmly out of activities and lead a normal
life. Take up knitting or spend your spare time
learning how to slug down a straight shot without
wheezing.
Do anything, but don't let it happen to you what
happened to mo.

that's The Daily editor's name, asked me to explain
the face which has been inclosed in this column for
the past few mornings.
Actually, it's a fake. Nobody could look that bad.
It's used only to scare away George Velliotes, Pris
cilla Claudius, and Jan van Gindertael.
Absolutely, there are no convicts, ex-cons, or
would-be Dan Dt.tryeas on the staff. So that explains
the picture.
If 1 might offer a sincere suggestion on how to
handle these try outs for various hungry organizations.
1t would be this:
Look them all over carefully. Visit the Quad.
Try Rally Com. See KSU, I mean KZSU. Judge
them all. Decide which can yive you what you want.
And then, after you make your final decision, forget
it.
Back calmly out of activities and lead a normal
life. Take up knitting or spend your spare time
learning how to slug down a straight shot without
wheezing.
Do anything, but don't let it happen to you what
happened to mo.
