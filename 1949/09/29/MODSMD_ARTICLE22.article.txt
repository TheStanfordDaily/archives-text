### BOB BATLIN 
Now that h'eg Day has come and
and two hundred dollars with
it, scores of Stanford students are
turning their stops in the direction
of the Student Employment Office.
Whether it be to earn money for
making the proverbial ends meet, or
just lor that weekend date, Stan
ford]! is through the years have
learned to count on the office for aid
in securing funds.
The office serves as a regular em
ployment agency, listing numerous
jobs throughout the area available
i ? fudents alone. Bookkeeping to
chopping wood, tutoring to baby
sitting, there is no limit to the
breadth of employment opportuni
ties offered
This office was established in 1938
us a little sister to the Appointmenl
Service, which secures permanent
employment for graduating seniors,

but has long outgrown its shoes. |
Under the direction of Mrs. Clotilde |
Edwards, who headed the Service
from 1945 through last spring quar
ter, the office attracted more and
more friends each year. fXiring the
school year of 1948-49, Mrs. Ed
wards and her assistant, Mis. Har
riet Williams, succeeded in helping
3,768 students registered with the
office to secure some 4,257 jobs.
Mrs. Edwards married Hugh '
Southgate of Portola in June, and
has decided to retire from the post, i
Mrs. Anne D. Severin, who has had
several years' experience dealing
with personnel at large California
business concerns, has since as- i
sumed the position.
As the number of applicants has
increased (from 1,001 students in
194r,-46 to the 3,768 in 1948-49), so
has the scope of occupational oppor
tunities The office ri now a clear*

i ing house for jobs available on cam
! pus, in Palo Alto, and in the Bay
Area. The office divides its jobs into
several categories. There are the
"pick-up" jobs, which include the
odd tasks of mowing lawns, ad
dressing post cards, etc., of which
there is usually a large selection
j awaiting a student with a free af-
I ternoon.
Another group cotnprises the
"part - time permanent" jobs, em
! bracing a wide diversity of duties
demanding several hours of work
each week. Full-time jobs are open
to students who are mil of school for
a quarter or so.
So, if you're in need of a job to
j provide money or just to while
away the time between classes, Mrs.
Severin suggests that you visit the
Student Employm< ut Office in Tern
penary Building (' between 8 30 a m
