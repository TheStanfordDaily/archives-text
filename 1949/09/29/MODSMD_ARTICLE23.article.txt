Carpenters, electricians, and
plumbers are busy preparing desks,
doors, lighting, and lounge facilities
tor the painters, who are slated to
begin work in close to two weeks.
The original estimated completion
date of "early 1950" has been moved
up due to speedy construction work,
especially in the last few months.
Dean of the School of Law Carl
B. Spaeth said yesterday:
"The new law quarters will house
Ihe present school comfortably. We
don't plan any increase in enroll
ment, and expect to have from 350
to 100 students winter quarter."
The old Law School location on
Innjer Quad may be used for Ad
ministrative offices, University offi
cials said.
Begun in August of 1948, the new
school will have a capacity of 348
students in its main lecture room,
classrooms, and moot court room.
Stack capacity will be close to 160,-
000 volumes.

sultation and graduate research
rooms, reading looms, and quarters
for the "Stanford Law Review."
A lounge, locker rooms, and stor
age and service facilities will be
housed in the basement.
The building will serve no other
functions than those which pertain
