# KZSU Looks For Sexy Siren
## Seductive Voice Needed to Play 'Stanford Sadie' 
### 
KZSU is on the prowl for another
Stanford Sadie. Station Manager
Mary Hill announced that tryouts
for the sultry Stanford siren will be
held today from 3 to 5 in the KZSU
studios at the rear of Memorial Hall.
Tradition, explained Program Di
rector Chuck Black, dictates that a
new girl should play the anonymous
role each quarter. "We want a sexy
voice," mused Black. "And if she's |
got a sexy personality to go with it
that's all the better."
Stanford Sadie, patterned after
the wartime "Axis Sally" and "To
kyo Rose" broadcasts, was origi
nated two years ago. The mysteri
ous Sadie, luring men from books
rather than from fighting, will air
her charms this quarter from 10:30
to 11 p.m. Mondays, beginning next
week, over 880 kilocycles.
"We want somebody to play the
part of a seductress," Black said.
He pointed out that the new Sadie
will be chosen in utmost secrecy,
and that her name will be kept se
cret till the end of the quarter.
Three times during the past, bands
of "roughs" have invaded the KZSU
studio to find who the sultry one
was. None of the efforts was suc
cessful.
Black urged all interested Stan
ford women to try out. "No experi
ence is needed," he declared, and
then added, "at least no radio ex
perience—let's put it that way."
Contrary to previous announce
ment, there will be no auditions or
tours held tomorrow. Notice of
KZSU meetings will be found in
today's and tomorrow's Bulletin
Board.


STANFORD'S RADIO STATION KZSU, has invited the public to view its studio, offices, and

Sadie will be held at the same time.
