## Midweek Musings 
### 
I finally got down to Frankie's bar
last night, something I've been in
tending to do ever since our won
derful Indians pasted back the ears
of the Harvards last Saturday. Io
fact, that 44-0 romp was just what
I'd been.waiting for since September
of 1947. Now at last I had my
chance to return a few of the verbal
pokes Frankie had been taking at
my alma mammy the past few years.
Not that I don't like Frankie. He's
a good sort of egg for the most part:
friendly, efficient, and personable.
He can mix a Zombie with the best
of them, and he always remembers
my first name. As long as he sticks
to his regular business of wine,
women, and song, he's tops in my
book.
But Frankie also considers him
self a first-class grid expert. Add to
that the fact that he's a Cal booster
from way back, and you have all
the ingredients of a personality
which often proves exceedingly dis
agreeable. Some of the things that
Frankie has said about our Cards
the last two years would make the
Dead End Kids wince.
REVENGE IS SWEET
Being human, I can't be blamed
for wanting revenge. So after four
days of convincing myself that the
Lucky Strike people hadn't padded
my cigarettes, and that the scohe
board really said 44-0, I dug my
red jacket out of its mothball stor
age, sharpneed my tongue, and trot
ted down El Camino to Frankie's re
freshery.
Once seated at my favorite perch,
I discovered one more disagreeable
trait in Frankie which I hadn't no
ticed before. He's stubborn as a

mule.
I opened casually with, "Howdja
like the game, Frankie?"
"Dem lucky bums. '
I didn't like his attitude, but I
calmly pointed out what I consid
ered to be a few pertinent facts.
First, I mentioned that Hugasjan,
White, DeYoung, Boruck, Benson,
etc., were the fastest things seen in
these parts since Haley's Comet last
put in an appearance.
"The tackling was sloppy," Frank
ie coutered.
WINGMEN BEAU COUP
"And those ends. We've got
enough ends to supply the whole
Pacific Coast with All-Americans."
I was still undaunted.
"Any team that's heard of the
forward pass can run rings around
the bums."
I pretended not to hear. "White
and Rau are the best tackles on
the Coast. And didja notice Pom
eroy and Jacobs? We've got quar
terbacks coming out of our ears.
And Mitchell's back."
Give it to him both barrels, I
thought.
"Michigan'll kill ya."
This time I had an answer ready.
"Oh, yeah, didn't you see where the
Bay Area sports writers pick Stan
ford to win this week?"
Frankie laughed for the first time
since I've known him.
"Sports writers! Hah!" I realized
it was more of an expectoration than
a laugh. "The day I see a sports
writer who knows what the hell
he's talking about, I'll give you a
case of Canadian Club. Free, for
nuttin'."
He had me there.

ticed before. He's stubborn as a

mule.
I opened casually with, "Howdja
like the game, Frankie?"
"Dem lucky bums. '
I didn't like his attitude, but I
calmly pointed out what I consid
ered to be a few pertinent facts.
First, I mentioned that Hugasjan,
White, DeYoung, Boruck, Benson,
etc., were the fastest things seen in
these parts since Haley's Comet last
put in an appearance.
"The tackling was sloppy," Frank
ie coutered.
WINGMEN BEAU COUP
"And those ends. We've got
enough ends to supply the whole
Pacific Coast with All-Americans."
I was still undaunted.
"Any team that's heard of the
forward pass can run rings around
the bums."
I pretended not to hear. "White
and Rau are the best tackles on
the Coast. And didja notice Pom
eroy and Jacobs? We've got quar
terbacks coming out of our ears.
And Mitchell's back."
Give it to him both barrels, I
thought.
"Michigan'll kill ya."
This time I had an answer ready.
"Oh, yeah, didn't you see where the
Bay Area sports writers pick Stan
ford to win this week?"
Frankie laughed for the first time
since I've known him.
"Sports writers! Hah!" I realized
it was more of an expectoration than
a laugh. "The day I see a sports
writer who knows what the hell
he's talking about, I'll give you a
case of Canadian Club. Free, for
nuttin'."
He had me there.
I finally got down to Frankie's bar
last night, something I've been in
tending to do ever since our won
derful Indians pasted back the ears
of the Harvards last Saturday. Io
fact, that 44-0 romp was just what
I'd been.waiting for since September
of 1947. Now at last I had my
chance to return a few of the verbal
pokes Frankie had been taking at
my alma mammy the past few years.
Not that I don't like Frankie. He's
a good sort of egg for the most part:
friendly, efficient, and personable.
He can mix a Zombie with the best
of them, and he always remembers
my first name. As long as he sticks
to his regular business of wine,
women, and song, he's tops in my
book.
But Frankie also considers him
self a first-class grid expert. Add to
that the fact that he's a Cal booster
from way back, and you have all
the ingredients of a personality
which often proves exceedingly dis
agreeable. Some of the things that
Frankie has said about our Cards
the last two years would make the
Dead End Kids wince.
REVENGE IS SWEET
Being human, I can't be blamed
for wanting revenge. So after four
days of convincing myself that the
Lucky Strike people hadn't padded
my cigarettes, and that the scohe
board really said 44-0, I dug my
red jacket out of its mothball stor
age, sharpneed my tongue, and trot
ted down El Camino to Frankie's re
freshery.
Once seated at my favorite perch,
I discovered one more disagreeable
trait in Frankie which I hadn't no
ticed before. He's stubborn as a

mule.
