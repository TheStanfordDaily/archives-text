# AL Pennant Race Tied: Yanks Win, Washington Dumps Red Sox 2-1
## New York Gets Seventh Inning; Nats Win on Parnell's Wild Pitch 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. (/P) 28 — The |
Yankees' pennant hopes flickered
and almost died, then were revived
in one inning today. The New
Yorkers after falling behind in the
seventh, blasted their former neme
sis, Alex Kelliiier, (or three runs in
the same inning to defeat the Phila
delphia Athletics, 7 to 5.
This victory made it certain that |
the 1949 American League pennant
race will be won or lost in the two- j
game series between the Yanks and
the Boston Red Sox here Saturday ;
and Sunday. Joe DiMaggio worked
out for the first time but did not
play.
The Athletics, submissive and ap- I
parently ineffective for six innings, I
scored all their runs in the seventh
when they drove Tommy Byrne off j
the mound. But the Yanks, possibly
inspired by the brief and unexpected j
pre-game appearance of the ailing
Joe DiMaggio. came l ight back to i
score three times in that inning and I
win the ball game.
UMPIRES ON SPOT
The tension of a tight pennant
race against put the umpires on the
hot spot with Charlie Berry, behind
the plate, taking most of the blasts.
Berry evicted Eddie Joost, Philadel
phia shortstop, for too-vigorous pro
tests against a called third strike in
the third inning. And Berry twice
called balks against pitchers, the
second sending the Yankees' last
run home.
who had failed to survive
the first inning against Boston Mon
day, apparently had the game well in
hand going into the seventh. He had
allowed only two hits up to that point
ana was leading, 4-0. Home runs by
Bobby Brown in the third and by
Jim Delsing in the sixth accounted
for three of these.
CHAPMAN STARTS IT
But the Yankee left-hander appar
ently lost his stuff and before the in
ning ended, Fred Sanford and Joe
Page also had made futile efforts to
stop the A's. Allie Reynolds finally
took over the pitching job after the
Yanks regained the lead and hurled
two superb innings in relief to hold
it, striking out three men in the
ninth.
The trouble started when Sam
Chapman drew a walk to open the
A's half of the seventh.

The tail-end Washington Senators

Eddie Robinson beat out a hit and
Coan romped to third.
Kozar followed with a single to
left to score Coan with the tying
run and chase Stobbs in favor of
Ellis Kinder.
Sam Dente greeted Kinder with a
single to right but sharp fielding by
A 1 Zarilla held Robinson on third
| and the bases were loaded.
Mel Parnell, the majors top win
