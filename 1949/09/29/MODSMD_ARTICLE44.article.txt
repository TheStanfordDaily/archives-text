Next Saturday evening Coach Marchie Schwartz's Stanford Indians
will be the top football team in the nation.
If ... .
I .... a lot of things. If the Cards themselves are as good as they
think they are. If Harvard and San Jose State were good football teams.
If Michigan football players are what I think they are—human being's,
who eat, drink, and sleep just like everyone else. And if Mr. Will Con
nolly, who used to be a pretty good sportswriter, is wrong in his brilliant
quote of last Monday morning.
Mr. Connolly, who has not seen the Cards, either in action or in prac
tice, this year, and who has not seen the mighty Wolverines since their
great 1947 squad, spoke like an expert this week. ". . . . the Redskins will
try to keep the Michiganders within decent bounds. We don't think it is
humanly possible." It appears to me, from reading the "Green —a poor
substitute for the Examiner sports page—that somebody up there still
thinks the University of California still has the greatest grid squad on
earth, and thus, why bother with the kids down Palo Alto way?
Well, maybe so—now that Cal has thundered over the nation's two
greatest power-houses (St. Mary's and Santa Clara) and is preparing for
a similar bone-crunching game against the mighty eleven from Oregon
State. Yep. I guess the undefeated Bears deserve, along with the Oaks,
Mr. Connolly's rapt attention.
My only sadness is that if the trend continues, Sunday's Chronicle will
look something like this:
CAL SLAUGHTERS OSC, 7-<>
cards eke miehigan, 28-7
And go on to say how the great Boots Erb —the greatest Cal qb since
C'eleri —completely dazzled the unfortunate Beavers. They will say how
fine it is that Boots is finally getting a chance to play ball—cleverly for
getting that the same Boots Erb was Cal's first-string quarterback in
19-16. Also, the Green might mention that the Indians looked OK against
the slow, weak Wolverines and are expected to get their .first test next
week against UCLA.
As the great Dink Temple ton pointed out last week, if the Cards had
beaten San Jose by two touchdowns instead of seven, and Harvard by one
touchdown instead of six, the world would say we have a fine team. Now
everyone is in doubt. It boils down to what yours truly blurted out last
spring: that the famine is over, and Stanford rooters just can't quite be
lieve it yet.
But the Indian bandwagon—with the somber absence of Mr. Connolly
—is becoming distinctly crowded. Kuss Newland of the Associated Press
took a poll of California sports writers yesterday and found that out of
12 major writers (Mr. Connolly wasn't polled), seven picked the Indians
Saturday, four picked the Wolverines, aud Stanford grad Dick Friend
lich stayed on the fence, predicting a 14-14 tie.
Chronicle Sports Editor, Bill Leiser, a former Daily editor whom many
readers had given up as a robust Berkeley-lover, has scampered back onto
the Stanford side of the field after a scad of springtime Golden Bearish
press orgies. Mr. Leiser who, without seeing the Indians, predicted u.s
into the Rose Bowl, has picked Stanford to eke out Michigan 28-27.
Another Drofnats grad, Art Rosenbaum, picks the Indians, 20-7. Jack
McDonald of the Call-Bulletin says Stanford, 24-14. Former Card All-
American Dick Hyland of the LA Times, who is one of the Coast's top
sportsters, likes the Indians, 14-7. Bob Brachman, who is one of the best
sports reporters in the Bay Area, tags Standforcl 20 to Michigan's 7.
Mucky Walters of the News picks Stanford, 20-14.
It is also interesting to note that all those picking the Wolverines over
Stanford do not give the men from the Ann Arbor Athletic Club more
than seven points over Schwartz's happy warriors. All of which leaves
Mr. Connolly of the Chronicle alone on his cold,, cold limb.
My personal prediction is Stanford 28,. Michigan 14, and that next
Saturday evening Coach Marchie Schwartz's Stauford Indians will he
the top football team in the nation.
