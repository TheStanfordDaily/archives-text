# Rain Gives Bums, Cards Well-Deserved Breather
## 
### GIL JONAS 
With rain retarding the tight Na
tional League pennant race, the
Dodgers and Cardinals have been
given a chance to rest their cam
paign-weary regulars for the final
spurt. The Bums are probably the
more grateful of the two to Jupe
Pluvius' benevolent intervention.
Their pitching staff is haggardâ€”
that is, big Don Newcombe and
slender Preacher Roe cannot pitch
every day. Their daring speed has i
diminished since the early months j
of the season. They haven't been !
hitting consistently in the last |
month. But they have managed to
keep pace with the more experi- j
enced Cards.
And the most credit is undoubt
edly due to Jackie Robinson, the
greatest one-man gang in baseball,
who hasn't missed a game al! season.
Robbie tops the loop in batting and
hits, is second in doubles, triples,
and RBl's, and third in runs tallied.
He tops every second baseman in
fielding. But the attribute that
draws the fans and causes opposing

managers and hurlers to lose sleep
is his cat-like speed.
Jackie isn't the fastest man in
baseball. He merely has phenome
nal reflex actions, a gambling dispo
sition, and the gift for sensing the
right opportunity. He steals home,
scores from first on a single, tallies
from second on an infield out, goes
from first to third on a sacrifice, and
generally causes various forms of
neurosis among the opposition.
Much of the Dodgers' league-lead
ing home run output has been cred
ited to Jack's daring leads which
cause the pitcher to concentrate on
him instead of the batter. And all
this without a vacation. He had an
abbreviated one yesterday and to
day he's starting all over again.
