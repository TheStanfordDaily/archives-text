# ROTC Has Many Openings
## Freshmen Should Join Right Now 
### 
Stanford's Army, Navy, and Air
Force ROTC s .till have many open
ings for those who want to earn re
serve commissions while going
through college. Men students may
enroll in the ROTC offices on the
second floor of the SAC Building.
"Now is the time," emphasized
Colonel 11. L. Barrett, head of the
Air Force ROTC. He stated that
Since the ROTC programs require
four years, freshmen who want to
take advantage of the courses must
enroll now or not at all.
Colonel Barrett said that aside
(from the knowledge, pay, and ex
perience ROTC oflers, an enrolled
student learns "leadership in citi
zcnslup," and l'ullills a "vital re
sponsibility in helping prepare for
national defense.
College graduates in ROTC are
especially desirable as officers, said
Colonel James V. Collier, in charge
of the Army ROTC. He expressed
the opinion that the Army could not
have managed in the last war with
out its wealth of ROTC graduates.
During his first two years, a stu
dent in the Army or Air Force ROTC
takes two units a week ol military
science. In his last two years, he
may specialize in the Artillery or
Quartermaster Corps, if in Army
ROTC. He may specialize in maint
enance or administration if in the
Air Force ROTC. Four units are
civen for these advanced courses.
A student in the Naval ROTC s
"contract program" receives three
units a quarter, and in his last two
years may specialize in the Marine
Corps or in the Navy.
All ROTC programs pay the stu
dent approximately $27 a month in
his last two years. Army and Air
students learn to work with mili
tary equipment when they attend a
six weeks summer camp following
their third year. Naval students go
on a six weeks cruise.
Colonel Barrett declared that
ROTC is a w?y of "preparing you
for lifeâ€”free." In case of national
emergency, he said, the RGTC grad
uate goes on active duty as an ofTi

cer. In any case, the ROTC gradu
ate who maintains membership in
the reserve, wilh pay, whether serv
ing on active duty or not, can retire
at the age of (>0 with a pension of
from SlOO to $250 per month. In
addition, said the colonel, he is ful
filling a vital public duty.
Veterans with one year of active
duty may enroll in the third year of
Army and Air Force ROTC. Gradu
ates of three years of high-school
ROTC are given a year's college
ROTC credit.
Army and Air Force ROTC stu
dents may obtain draft deferments
for their four years of college.
These deferments are in effect dur
ing time of peace or of war. A
graduate of this program is no longer
liable to compulsory peacetime ac
tive duty service, as he was last
year.
Stanford's ROTC units, the only
voluntary Army - Air Force - Naval
ROTC units in a Pacific Coast col
lege, possess equipment worth hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. In
cluded arc a $50,000 F-51 plane, two
105 mm. howitzers, and a hand-made
"terrain board," a miniature land
scape used for firing practice.
Graduates of college ROTC who

obtain active duty commissions, said
Colonel Collier, are in exactly the
same position as West Point gradu
ates. All are graduated as second
lieutenants. Recently, Stanford has
had the chance "to offer 25 active
duty commissions to its Army and
Air Force graduates. Colonel Col
lier himself worked up by attending
officers' training school during World
War I.
Stanford's Army and Air Force
ROTC units field a marching band
on drill days. Most members of the
Stanford rifle team, a minor sport,
come from the ROTC small bore rifle
team, said members of the ROTC
staff. Several Stanford students
have received national commenda
tion for their ROTC work.

Force-Naval ROTC units in a Pacific Coast college. Since
ROTC programs reguire four years, freshmen who wish to
take the courses should join now.
