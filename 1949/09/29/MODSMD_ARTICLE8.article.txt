# Village Barracks Receive $18,000 Summer Repairs
## Ceiling-High Partitions Constructed As Part of Extensive Face-Lifting 
### GORDON ADDISON 
A mass face-lifting is what the doctor ordered, and that is
what Stanford Village got.
When the 1,297 Village residents returned to their Farm homes
this week, they found that the wrinkles on the Village chin
had been wiped off with an 518,000 operation.
The major piece of surgery involved the "grafting on" of

cciling-high partitions in 12 fcar
racks. The alterations have resulted
in the setting up of 144 separate
four-man rooms. They were for
merly called bay areas and consisted
of shoulder-high partitions which
, divided the long barracks into sep
; aratc sections.
Dwight B. Adams, director of the
Village, said in summarizing the
summer renovation, that the rooms
have all been fitted with locks and
keys. He said "There have been :
many complaints in the pa.st be- !
cause the bay areas were poorly sup- '
plied with desks and locker space." I
EQUIPMENT STANDARDIZED
He pointed out that after an ex
tensive inventory of barracks equip
ment. the Village staff had stand
; ardized all equipment in the various
bay areas so each foursome might
have the same type of desks as those
in neighboring cubicles.
Along with the construction of the
high plyboard partitions, the ward
robe lockers were built into the wall
and freshly painted. However, the
walls in the 12 barracks were not
the only ones which felt the paint
brush this summer. All the build
ings were washed and cleaned for j
the first real "new look" the Village |
has had since the University took
over Dibble General Hospital in the !
fall of 1946.
RENT BOOSTED
The Village renovation will not |
pass without the residents them- j
selves tasting the leftovers of the I
feast. When Villagers write checks j
for their room rents this week they !
will le paying $35 per quarter for i
room rent. In three years, this $5 |
boost in rent is expected to erase the |
debt which is norw balanced on the
shoulders of a "reserve fund."
Adams said he felt the modern- j
ized bay area quarters will "more |
than make up for the increased
rents." He added that many Vil- ;
lagers have already expressed their
satisfaction with the summer's work.
The Village director stressed the
fact that it wasn't just an overnight :
job. The moment students moved
out in the June, the carpcnters \
moved in with their lumber, ham- j
mcrs, and paint buckets. And the ;
enterprise was completed right on 1
schedule—Spetembcr 10.
MORE PARKING
Second only to the work on the
barracks rooms was the addition of j
a large parking lot adjacent' to
buildings 306-316. The black-top
surfaced lot will hold 60 cars and
will solve the Village parking prob
lem. Director Adams said the new j
lot was primarily constructed with [
the idea of substituting for the park- |
ing space taken over by the Research j
Institute last year.
He emphasized that every effort is I

being made to furnish parking close I
to the barracks without endangering ;
the lives of the small children o f j
the Village families. Formerly some j
of the cars were crowded into small
areas where the children and pedes- ]
trians played or walked.
NO MORE TAR-PAPER
The days of the tar-papered shack
in Stanford Village are over, Adams
said. Uppcrclassmen will remember
the controversy last spring over the
use of the shacks for housing Vil- j
lage students. At that time the "tar- j
paper boys" were ousted from their
shabby quarters and the much-re
vered homes were converted into J
warehouses.
Adams asserted that the shacks
would only be used in an emergency j
this year.
Concerning the permanence of the
Village Adams said, "We're still |
thinking in terms of the temporary |
existence of the Village." Because
of the "crowded housing conditions j
he said, "it is difficult to plan recon
struction projects. No one knows i
how long the Village will be forced j
to operate."

quarters with shoulder-high partitions. N-ow, BELOW, ceiling high' jjaiUtions have been added
in 12 buildings, turning the cubicles into separate 4-man rooms which can be locked.
