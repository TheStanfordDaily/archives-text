## Russ-Tito Break 
### 
MOSCOW, Sept. 29 (/P) â€” Soviet
Russia broke oil her war-borr mu
tual ai'l treaty with Yugoslavia on j
grounds that Premier Marshal Tito's
government is linked with foreign
imperialists in "hostile and disuptive
work against the USSR." The treaty
normally would have run until 1965.
Its accusation was based on the j
recent Budapest treason trial, in
which former Hungarian Foreign
Minister Laszlo Rajk and two other
high Communists were sentenced to
death. They were charged with
plotting with Americans and Yugo
slavs to overthrow Hungary's Com
munist government and swing the
nation into Tito's orbit.
The Soviet decision was contained
in a note handed by Deputy For- ,
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko yes- i
terday to Yugoslavia's temporary
charge d'affaires, La/.o Latinovic.
Denunciation of the treaty
snipped one of the few remaining j
threads that had bound Russia and ;
Yugoslavia, which emerged from the
war under Communist rule.
