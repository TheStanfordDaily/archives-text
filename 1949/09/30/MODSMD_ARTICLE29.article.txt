The Palo Alto Post Office has
discovered four tickets to the
Michigan game in a special de
livery letter now resting in the
Dead Letter Office.
The student who sent these tick
ets to his father and forgot to ad
dress the envelope may pick up
the tickets at the Post Office if he
can present proper identification.
