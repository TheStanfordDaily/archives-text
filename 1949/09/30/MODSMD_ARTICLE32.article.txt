# Novel Due in '50
## New Look, Low Price Promised 
### 
With a new printer, engraver, and
photographer, a new cover, a new
price—even a new coat of paint on
the office walls — the ISSJ Quad
promises to present fresh and novel
i'eatures when it appears next June.
Amazingly enough in these times
of climbing costs, that "new price"
won't cause your hank hook to curl
..t the coiners. Instead the "half
century Quad" has been reduced to
$0.50, or $7 with the name printed
on the cover.
According to Dave Elliott, the
yearbook's business manager, this
refreshingly different price change
was made possible by savings in
printing co.ts. This year the work
is being done by the H. S. Crocker
Company at their new plant in San
Bruno. Willi the most modern equip
ment, Crocker can turn out the job
at a greater speed and smaller cost
than printers could in the past, El
iott said.
INCREASED DATES
Blind dates 011 the Stanford cam
pus should show a marked rise with
Quad's appearance. Their new pho
tographer comes to the Farm with
years of experience in the Los An
geles area, where much of his busi
ness was with movie stars. The
glamor content ol the individual
pictures is expected to increase cor
respondingly.
The outside of the book will pre
sent a look that has been absent
lrom Stanford Quads lor several
years with the return of the padded
and embossed cover.
And perhaps the test news is 'for
those who have cussed their way
backward, page by page, seeking 333
when only 350 was marked. The '50
Quad will positively be numbered 011
every page —that, too, from the au
thority of the business manager.
CALIFORNIA DUMMY
The dummy of the yearbook was
done by Victor Anderson of the Cali
fornia Art and Engraving Company
in Berkeley. He suggested many
features not seen around here for a
long time, especially improvements
in the Queen and football sections.
The five division pages will feature
full-color photoglyphs. And the ad
vertising section will be divided up
into classifications — for instance,
skiing, with candids, ads for ski re
sorts and equipment, and so forth
grouped together.
There will be a page for every
football game, and also a diagram
score chart picturing the plays of
each contest.
"And we're saving plenty of space
for the Rose Bowl game," Elliott
added.
This approximately 450-page vol
ume is now on sale every after
noon from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Quad
Office, across the street from Geology
Corner.
Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
there will be a Quad booth open in
front of the Cellar. Later on, repre
sentatives will be selling them in
the living groups as well.
"We know how many times you've
been told to get your Quad early, as
they might run out—and then it
doesn't happen," Elliott said.
SALES EARLY
"But we're repeating it again this
year, because for the first time we're
opening the sales to the alumni
groups. We don't think the Quads
will last as long, and we don't want
to see any of the students disap
pointed."
Tryoutees are still welcome at the
Quad office, gleaming in its new
gray and red color sceme. There are
openings for photographers, dark
room technicians, artists, and just
those who want to help with sched
uling pictures, writing articles, or
taking appointments. No experience
is required for most of these posi
tions.
ON LOOK-OUT
The business staff also is on the
look-out for student to work on both
circulation and advertising.
Anyone interested in these jobs is
invited to drop by the office in the
afternoon or come to the staff meet
ing Monday at 4.
The current heads of the staff are
Editor Bill Larmer; Managing Edi
tor Doris Elliott: Junior Editors Mi
Deane, Dick Klein. Nancy Mayer,
and Elise McKown; and Art Editor

there will be a Quad booth open in
front of the Cellar. Later on, repre
sentatives will be selling them in
the living groups as well.
"We know how many times you've
been told to get your Quad early, as
they might run out—and then it
doesn't happen," Elliott said.
SALES EARLY
"But we're repeating it again this
year, because for the first time we're
opening the sales to the alumni
groups. We don't think the Quads
will last as long, and we don't want
to see any of the students disap
pointed."
Tryoutees are still welcome at the
Quad office, gleaming in its new
gray and red color sceme. There are
openings for photographers, dark
room technicians, artists, and just
those who want to help with sched
uling pictures, writing articles, or
taking appointments. No experience
is required for most of these posi
tions.
ON LOOK-OUT
The business staff also is on the
look-out for student to work on both
circulation and advertising.
Anyone interested in these jobs is
invited to drop by the office in the
afternoon or come to the staff meet
ing Monday at 4.
The current heads of the staff are
Editor Bill Larmer; Managing Edi
tor Doris Elliott: Junior Editors Mi
Deane, Dick Klein. Nancy Mayer,
and Elise McKown; and Art Editor
Joyce Lowell.
With a new printer, engraver, and
photographer, a new cover, a new
price—even a new coat of paint on
the office walls — the ISSJ Quad
promises to present fresh and novel
i'eatures when it appears next June.
Amazingly enough in these times
of climbing costs, that "new price"
won't cause your hank hook to curl
..t the coiners. Instead the "half
century Quad" has been reduced to
$0.50, or $7 with the name printed
on the cover.
According to Dave Elliott, the
yearbook's business manager, this
refreshingly different price change
was made possible by savings in
printing co.ts. This year the work
is being done by the H. S. Crocker
Company at their new plant in San
Bruno. Willi the most modern equip
ment, Crocker can turn out the job
at a greater speed and smaller cost
than printers could in the past, El
iott said.
INCREASED DATES
Blind dates 011 the Stanford cam
pus should show a marked rise with
Quad's appearance. Their new pho
tographer comes to the Farm with
years of experience in the Los An
geles area, where much of his busi
ness was with movie stars. The
glamor content ol the individual
pictures is expected to increase cor
respondingly.
The outside of the book will pre
sent a look that has been absent
lrom Stanford Quads lor several
years with the return of the padded
and embossed cover.
And perhaps the test news is 'for
those who have cussed their way
backward, page by page, seeking 333
when only 350 was marked. The '50
Quad will positively be numbered 011
every page —that, too, from the au
thority of the business manager.
CALIFORNIA DUMMY
The dummy of the yearbook was
done by Victor Anderson of the Cali
fornia Art and Engraving Company
in Berkeley. He suggested many
features not seen around here for a
long time, especially improvements
in the Queen and football sections.
The five division pages will feature
full-color photoglyphs. And the ad
vertising section will be divided up
into classifications — for instance,
skiing, with candids, ads for ski re
sorts and equipment, and so forth
grouped together.
There will be a page for every
football game, and also a diagram
score chart picturing the plays of
each contest.
"And we're saving plenty of space
for the Rose Bowl game," Elliott
added.
This approximately 450-page vol
ume is now on sale every after
noon from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Quad
Office, across the street from Geology
Corner.
Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
