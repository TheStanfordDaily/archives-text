# PADDLING EXPEDITION
## Tim-Man Farm Crew Navigates the Yukon 
### 
Have a dull summer?
Looking for something more exciting to do next year?
If so, why not give a thought to paddling down the Yukon
River in a metal canoe? Two Stanford Delts, Dave Field and
Dick Schultze will be glad to tell you all about it.
The pair left Lake Bennett in British Columbia, source of the

Yukon, on June 20. Fifty-one days,
1,800 miles, and an unknown num
ber of mosquito bites later, they
pulled ashore at Anchorage, near the
mouth of the river.
Their craft, the "SS Permanente,"
was an 18-foot Grumman aluminum
canoe with air tanks at each end. It
was unsinkable, and according to
Schulze "would be very difficult to
turn over." The canoe was donated
to the expedition by the Kaiser Cor
poration.
The two navigated three Yukon
rapids without mishap, but were
plagued by almost daily rain and
ciouds of hungry mosquitoes.
They were in real danger only
once, Field said. Just outside Moun
tain Village, a town 90 miles inland
from the mouth of the Yukon on the
Bering Sea, their canoe was caught
in a cross current, whipped by high
winds. After a battle with the river,
they finally made their way near the
bank, where the waters were
smoother.
The only big game they bagged
were mosquitoes.
"They really grow big up there,"
Schultze remarked.
"A lot of the time we couldn't even
camp on the beach at night they
were so bad."
The river's current carried them
along at a brisk clip and only oc
casionally were they required to
paddle.
"We paddled the hardest on the
14th day out after we had run out
of food and were trying to get into
Carmacks to get something to eat,"
Schulze related.
Chief item of diet from that time
on was salmon, given to them by
the Indians as they passed the var
ious fishwheels.
"We ate so much salmon we began
to sprout gills," Field said.


TWO STANFORD DELTS, DICK SCHULTZE and DAVE FIELD,
walk down a Seattle street after completing an 1,800-mile
trip down the Yukon River in a metal canoe. They are attempt
ing to sell the story of their adventure to Collier's Magazine.
