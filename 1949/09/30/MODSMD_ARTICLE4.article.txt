# Steel Strike Due
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH — One small steel
company today accepted the CIO
United Steclworkers' terms but all
other signs pointed to a nationwide
slcei strike at midnight Friday.
As other companies banked their
furnaces— and some workers al
ready were leaving their jobs —
Portsmouth, 0., Steel Corporation
signed a contract to break the steel
industry's united front.
It agreed to foot the pension and
insurance bill for its 4,000 em
ployees. Previously all steel compa
nies had insisted that if their work
ers wanted a social security pro
gram they would have to help pay
for it.
