# A 						Letter to Marchie Schwartz

(Bob "Horse" Reynolds still rates at the top of
Stanford's long list of gridiron greatsâ€”he was the
sparkplug of the famed Vow Boys; he was an All-
Ainerican tackle two years running; and he is the
only man ever to have played 180 consecutive min
utes in the Rose Bowl. He is now vice-president
and general manager of Radio Station KMPC in
Los Angeles.
The following is the contents of a letter that
"Horse" Reynolds wrote Wednesday to Coach Mar
chie Schwartz. Marchie read it to the team yester
day, and then felt that there was something in it
for every member of the student body. Marchie
has given us permission to print it here.)
September 28, 1949
Dear Marchie:
Like a lot of other Stanford men here on
the Coast, and all over the world for that
rpatter, I'll be pulling and pushing for you
and your fine squad next Saturday afternoon.
I'll be one of the luckier ones, as I plan to be
on hand at the Stadium. (As you probably
know, a great many people, many of them
not Stanfordites, are making the trip north
from here.)
Thinking of this game gives me a thrill such
as I've rjot experienced in many years. It
stems frdm the knowledge and experience
gained in-football, that a tried and proven and
unbeaten football team is the finest and most
worthy kind of adversary a team on the way
up can meet. As we both know, it doesn't hap
pen very often in football that a team has the
privilege I of taking on a 24-game winning
champion. To take the field against an oppo
nent of this caliber was always to me the su
preme thrill of football. Particularly is this

true when a player has a quiet but firm confi
dence in the collective ability of his team to
match such an opponent. It was in a game
under circumstances somewhat similar to this
one that our so-called Vow Boy team came
into its own, when as a bunch of 19-year-old
sophomores, we ended a Southern California
winning streak of 21 games. I know you've
experienced it and so did Phil Bengtson at
Minnesota.
There just isn't a better test in football or in
any sport for that matter than to beat or look
good against a champion. Only yesterday a
good friend of mine in Detroit, and a close
follower of Michigan, who saw their game
against Michigan State, wrote me that Michi
gan "can be had." But, he added that the team
who could beat them would have to be on its
toes and would have to play all-out for sixty
minutes.
There are a great number of former Stanford
football players who will be following your
boys in the positions which they once played.
That's why I'll be "sweating it out" for Gor
don White and A 1 Rau and the other tackles.
I like the way they looked in the games I
saw them play last season, and if they do what
I think they can they're going to be mighty
proud after the Michigan game.
To a man, we're with you and your squad,
Marchie, win, lose, or draw. If the men will
play like champions against a champion,
they'll go a long way.
The best to you,
808 "HORSE" REYNOLDS
