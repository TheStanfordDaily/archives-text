# It's Your Responsibility

The Honor Code Standing Committee has
done a good job of telling new members of
the Stanford Family, students and faculty alike,
about the Honor Code. Learning how and
why the Honor Code works is perhaps the
most important single aspect of orientation,
and we'd like to toss in our two cents' worth.
The Honor Code is a keystone in the Stan
ford way of life .... an ideal that became a
reality through the efforts of countless students
and faculty members.
Student government was non-existent here
lor many years after the founding of the Uni
versity. Student affairs were administered by
faculty committees. Then, in 1904, an honor
system was proposed by students and faculty
who felt that exam proctoring was an affront
to student integrity. The proposition was re
jected because both factions agreed that an
honor system would be practicable only under
a student government, which the administra
tion still opposed.
In 1912, however, the University granted the
student body its first self-government, stimu
lating the fight for an honor system, and in
1921 the April issue of the Stanford Illustrated
Review declared that "the proctoring system
kefeps the students honest, while the Honor
Code makes them honest."
In May of 1921 the University, acting on a
student petition, approved the Honor Code.
Since then the responsibility for honorable
conduct in academic work has rested squarely
upon the students. And it is a third-person
responsibility. Students should support the
Honor Code not only by observing it them

selves, but by reporting violations.
In past years there has been some confusion
between the Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard, with respect to this third-person re
sponsibility. It must be understood that the
third-person responsibility, which is the heart
of the Honor Code, does not apply to the
Fundamental Standard. Excom passed the fol
lowing ruling on May 19, 1949:
"In the opinion of Executive Committee, the
Fundamental Standard establishes a general
standard for student conduct. The Honor Code
relates only to honesty in academic work. It is
neither desirable nor practicable that the
Honor Code encompass every phase of Stan
ford life, nor does the Honor Code place on
each student individually the responsibility
for the observance of all University or ASSU
regulations."
The Honor Code means that our examina
tions are not proctored .... there is no
scramble to "outsmart the prof," leaving the
honest student high and dry.
Stanford's honor system has three basic
phases. The Honor Code Standing Committee
educates students and faculty to the "hows
and whys" of the Code, and Men's and Wom
en's Councils treat violations. But in practice,
the responsibility is ours.
The Honor Code is one of the University's
most revered traditions . . . , a tradition that
works for every student and instructor to in
sure fairness and equality in the business of
learning. The success of the Honor Code rests
upon our ability to recognize its true value
and support it wholeheartedly. —J.L.

The Honor Code means that our examina
tions are not proctored .... there is no
scramble to "outsmart the prof," leaving the
honest student high and dry.
Stanford's honor system has three basic
phases. The Honor Code Standing Committee
educates students and faculty to the "hows
and whys" of the Code, and Men's and Wom
en's Councils treat violations. But in practice,
the responsibility is ours.
The Honor Code is one of the University's
most revered traditions . . . , a tradition that
works for every student and instructor to in
sure fairness and equality in the business of
learning. The success of the Honor Code rests
upon our ability to recognize its true value
and support it wholeheartedly. —J.L.
The Honor Code Standing Committee has
done a good job of telling new members of
the Stanford Family, students and faculty alike,
about the Honor Code. Learning how and
why the Honor Code works is perhaps the
most important single aspect of orientation,
and we'd like to toss in our two cents' worth.
The Honor Code is a keystone in the Stan
ford way of life .... an ideal that became a
reality through the efforts of countless students
and faculty members.
Student government was non-existent here
lor many years after the founding of the Uni
versity. Student affairs were administered by
faculty committees. Then, in 1904, an honor
system was proposed by students and faculty
who felt that exam proctoring was an affront
to student integrity. The proposition was re
jected because both factions agreed that an
honor system would be practicable only under
a student government, which the administra
tion still opposed.
In 1912, however, the University granted the
student body its first self-government, stimu
lating the fight for an honor system, and in
1921 the April issue of the Stanford Illustrated
Review declared that "the proctoring system
kefeps the students honest, while the Honor
Code makes them honest."
In May of 1921 the University, acting on a
student petition, approved the Honor Code.
Since then the responsibility for honorable
conduct in academic work has rested squarely
upon the students. And it is a third-person
responsibility. Students should support the
Honor Code not only by observing it them

selves, but by reporting violations.
In past years there has been some confusion
between the Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard, with respect to this third-person re
sponsibility. It must be understood that the
third-person responsibility, which is the heart
of the Honor Code, does not apply to the
Fundamental Standard. Excom passed the fol
lowing ruling on May 19, 1949:
"In the opinion of Executive Committee, the
Fundamental Standard establishes a general
standard for student conduct. The Honor Code
relates only to honesty in academic work. It is
neither desirable nor practicable that the
Honor Code encompass every phase of Stan
ford life, nor does the Honor Code place on
each student individually the responsibility
for the observance of all University or ASSU
regulations."
