# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Tomoirow it's Michigan. The big, bad Wolverines.
Representing the finest that football has to offer.
They're good. Very good.
Thov won 24 straight football games, and that's

a lot of football games. Tomor
row they will be favored to make
it number 25.
For two years in a row, Michi
gan has been called by sports
writers the first or at least the
second-best gridiron machine in
the world. There is no reason to
believe, yet, that they will not be
right back up there again this
season.
Someone said it. They're good.
Actually, Michigan figures to

KiiUcn U»4 ÜbaiUUi d by two touchdowns and keep its
record intact and unblemished.
But there are those foolish ones —how do you do
who think that the Ann Arbor bpys have reached
the end of the line. Time has run out on them. It's
time to move over.
The whys and wherefores behind Stanford's out
landish attitude have been demonstrated during the
Tribe's last two outings. The sophomore sparkplugs
. . the return of Emery Mitchell .... the line
backing of Castagnoti and Abraham .... and all
those flash-fast halfbacks.
But to turn the trick, that of being the first eleven
to topple Michigan in three years, Stanford must
do it the hard way. The Indians must climb right
to the top rung of the football ladder.

I've got h special reason for thinking thai the
Cards will do it. To be precise, it's a sub halfback
named Rvipe Andrews. Be sure to watch "Number 11"
tomorrow, because the Rupe is ready to roll. It's
just a hunch, but those lightning legs of his are about
to explode for some sweet gains.
The rest should go according to script. Shaw and
Kerkorian will pass, Hugysion will run, and Mitch
will kick—and don't forget Bud Klein, the club's
leading scorer; or Peck and Field, Stanford's defensive
specialists; or Ken Rose, on? of the best blocking
ends in the game today; or hobbling Holy Boruck.
They're all set to move. As is the entire squad.
It's Stanford's big chanre. Nobody wants to draw
a near miss. So lookout, Michigan. You've got a
big name and you have hurt us before, but 24 is
enough in any man's league.

If the cheerleaders happen to ask for it tomorrow.
I for one will be happy to lend my lungs to the Axe
Veil. Mainly, because it's, the top football game of
Ihc nation this week, and because almost 80,000 per
sons will be watching Stanford, and because we're
playing the best team in the country. If Stanford
wins, it will be the most significant football victory
since the Wow Boys gave it to Nebraska.
An Axe Yell along the way could do a lot of
good. Yeah-yeah, I know, save it for Cal. But why?
It was once given against a stubborn Washington
team, and it seemed plenty potent against USC last
season, and it's been used a great many other times
when the going has beeti rough.
Anyway, as I said before, I'll be glad to yell if
the cheerleaders ask for it.
