# Farm Students Swarm Over Europe, Practice Spanish and Beer Drinking
## 
### JOAN HARZFELD 
From the halls of English Parlia
ment to the shores of Italy, Stan
ford students bicycled, walked, and
vehicled ov6r Europe this summer.
Among this great mass of Stan
fordjtes was one small group whose
faux pas and experiences will for
ever immortalize them to the people
of Europe. Unfortunately, one tour
member has never returned—he is
now working his way through Ger
many.
Germany is the one place on earth
where a beer is cheaper than a post
card. The tour crossed into the
French zone one afternoon, and vis
ited the only building left standing
in the village—a beer garden. The
post cards were a nickel, the stamps
cost a young fortune, and the re
freshment (on tap) was three cents.
Spain once owned the Nether

lands, but one of the tour members
learned the hard way that the Dutch
do not speak Spanish too fluently.
The Stanfordite asked his taxicab
driver, "Donde esta Hotel Krasno
polsky?" The driver turned around
and said, "I don't understand Span
ish; can't we speak in English?"
This business of languages has
come through with some good sto
ries. The continental trains seat
their passengers in little compart
ments, six people to each cubby
hole. On the trip to Paris five of the
tour were contentedly hogging a
six-man room. Suddenly a dark
little man appeared and started
talking frantically in French, wav
ing his arms in the direction of the
empty seat.
One of the group looked blankly
at the newcomer and said, "You
have to have a ticket to come in
here." The "Frenchman" frowned
and replied, "Whatcha mean I ain't
got no ticket!" He moved in, Brook
lyn accent and all.
ANYTHING FOR A NICKEL
Europeans, and in particular Ital
ians, are always anxious to make a
nickel here, a dollar there. When
ever the touring bus stopped in
Italy, a swarm of paisanos would
decend, selling everything from
Vesuvius dirt to "genuine" coral.
One of the brighter tour members
beat the vendors at their own game
one day. He offered them a worn
out ball-point pen.
"C'est la vie," goes the old saying
in Paris. Anything goes—but when
American tourists steal the thunder
from the gay Parisians, that's some
thing new. In the Paris hotel, two
SC men gallantly offered to share
their bathtub with three Stanford
coeds. As a result, one of these gals
could be seen entering the boys'
room upstairs at almost any time of
day or night. The French chamber
maids were quite interested—prob
ably because the Stanford women
were clothed in little else except a
bathrobe and a towel.
ALUMNI ABROAD
There are a lot of ex-Stanfordites
living in or around Paris. Among
them are Beth Van Hoesen and Bob
Bigelow. The Bigelows have a farm
house and eight acres of land 40
miles away from the city. The house
and acreage costs them $12 a month.
Bob lives like a king on his GI bill.
"El Gruppo," as the tour members
called themselves, arc now strolling

up and down Quad instead of the
Champs-Elysees, and probably ea
ger to pounce on anyone who wants
to hear about Europe. So beware
these people—Kay Lloyd, Josie Cor
net, Mary Lou Alden, Miriam Aa
rons, Dee Hinimelstein. Jody John
son, Mary Geary, A 1 Margolis, Terry
Flynn, and Bob Caulfield.
