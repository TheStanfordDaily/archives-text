# Wolverines Seek 25th Straight Win
## 
### AL BERRY 
For two long, glorious years the Wolverines of the University of Michigan have made their
name syonymous with all that is mighty in the world of football. The title "National Champions,"
which "Fritz" Crisler's and Benny Oostbaan's excellent elevens gained at the end of the 1947
and 1948 campaigns, seemed somewhat anti-climactical in comparison with what these two great
teams had done every Saturday during the season. Michigan, then, has for the two last years

been power itself, victory plus, and
greatness in blue jerseys.
Stanford, which did not win a
game in 1047, which won but four
times in 1948, plays Michigan to
morrow in tl>e Stanford Stadium at
2:30 in the afternoon.
The Wolverine - Indian tussle
brings one big question to the fore:
Granted that the Cardinals of 1940
are a different team than the Red
shirts of the last two years. But
are the Wolverines of 1949 the same
team that rejoiced so happily on the
fields of Ann Arbor in '47 and '48?
The Midwestern scribes think they
are; the Far Western sports writers
think they arc not. And the Stan
ford varsity doesn't really care
much—they think they're going to
win anyway,
SPARTANS ARE STRONG
Michigan in her first debut last
week resembled only slightly the
powerhouse that grid immortals El
liot, Chappuis, Wiescnberger, and
Yerges sparked two years ago.
Against an admittedly powerful
Michigan State eleven, the Wolver
ines made hut 89 yards on rushing
plays, and a none too staggering 115
yards via the air ways. The final
score, 7-3, was somewhat less than
the '47 and '48 clubs offered the
Michigan rooting sections.
The 1947 Wolverines averaged 39
points or so per game to their op
ponents' nebulous 4 per. The 1947
Wolverines beat a weaker Michigan
State club 55-0. The 1948 national
champions had more trouble with
the Spartans, beating them only 13-
7, but for the season the lads of the
Ann Arbor Athletic Club averaged
around 26 points per game to the
opponents' 5. Michigan in the past
has always been—at worst —a rea
sonably decisive ball club.
It is readily pointed out that the
team that the Wolverines faced last
Saturday is one of the 10 strongest
in the nation; that the contest is a
"grudge game"—not comparable to
the Big Game, but still very bitter;
and that it was Michigan's first con
test. The only stable statistic to
come out of last week's tangle is
Michigan's punting average, which
was 38.9—about 10 yards less than
Stanford's average this season.
LOST DEFENSIVE LINE
It is also interesting to note that
the Ann Arborites lost the ball
three times via the fumble medium
last week, but this too can be at
tributed to the "first game" and the
"grudge game" status of the strug
gle.
A study of Michigan's personnel
is the one thing that adequately
shows the terrible striking power of
the Midwcsterners. Going down
their roster man for man, there arc
few teams in the nation that pre
sumably can stay in the same sta
dium with them, much less match
their awesome strength.
The loss of nearly their entire of
fensive line.f and their first-string 1
quarterback, will affect the potency j
of the Wolverines amazingly little.
Some of the depth is gone in the
line, but the first two strings wc
composed of potential All - Ameri
cans. The backfield might is unbe
lievable—strong even for Michigan
—especially at fullback and half
back. A dearth of experience at
the field-general post is probably
the only weak spot in Coach Ooster
baan's wonderful eleven. Here's how
the kids stack up:
BY POSITION
Fullback — Michigan's spinning '
crew is probably the strongest in
the country. Tom Peterson, short,
stocky 185-poundcr, was Michigan's
high scorer last year. Tom is rated
along with '47's Weiscnburger as a
spinning fullback — half halfback
and half magician. Last year Pctcr

son personally accounted for 55
points and threw three more touch
down passes.
Defensive fullback — Dick Kemp
thorn has been described as "de
structive as dynamite" and is un
doubtedly one of the greatest line
backers in football. He's a good ball
carrier, and one of the best block
ing backs in the Big Ten—those who

reviewed the dying Trojans in the
1947 Rose Bowl game will vouch for
that.
But the best fullback Michigan
showed last Saturday against the
Spartan was one Donald Dufek, who
was awarded Michigan's "most im
proved player" award at the end of
last year's spring practice. Dufek
sparked all of the Wolverines'
drives last week.
Halfback—Here we find the much
publicized (deservedly) Ail-Ameri
can candidate Chuck Ortmann, who
was probably Michigan's best back
last year. Ortmann, a junior, is
Michigan's best passer, flipping for
seven TD's last season. The smiling
left halfback scored twice last year,
carrying the ball 92 times for a total
of 237 yards.
At the right halfback spot is
"Bump" Elliot's able successor, Leo
Koccski. Koceski is a junior, a good
punter, scored seven times last sea-

son, and had a 3.87-yards-per-carry
in 67 times at bat. Koceski is an
excellent pass receiver—las) year lir
caught 22 passes for a total of 41!)
ya ids.
A third all - around halfback is
Walter TVninua, who has played all
of the baekficld positions. He is
Michigan's best punter, and was
rated the best back on the field last

I Saturday against Michigan State.
' He scored four touchdowns last sea
| son and passed for another one. Mis
punting average for the 1048 sea
! son was 3D.8.
Quarterback —This, is the weakest
spot in the Wolverine backfield, but
nevertheless has several worthy
: candidates plugging for it: Bill
Bartlett, formerly of Navy, was
given the starting nod last week, but
it was sophomore Bill Putich of
Cleveland, Ohio, who flipped the
winning touchdown pass for Michi
gan last week. Bartlett, who won a
letter last year understudying for
Pete Elliot, will probably start
against Stanford, however.
Ends — Irvin Wisniewski, "The
Whizzer," is G ft. 3 in., weighs 195.
Harry All is is Michigan's after-point
kicker and the Wolverines' third
highest scorer last season—he scored
three touchdowns and kicked 29
conversions. Oswald Clark has won
varsity football letters at both Mich
igan and Notre Dame and was the
Wolverines' best defensive end last
season. These gentlemen are three
i of the best wingmen in the country.
Tackles — Of the two greatest
tackles in the nation, Stanford will
only have to face one next Satur
day—Nomellini goes to Minnesota.
Alvin Wistert, however, plays for
I Michigan —in fact he is the Ann
! Arbor team captain. Wistert is one
! of Michigan's greatest All-Ameri
cans; the ex-Marine is unquestion
ably the finest lineman that Stan
ford will meet this season.
And holding down the other side
of the Michigan line is Allen Wahl,
who — incidentally — was an Army
Golden Gloves boxing champion.
Wahl is 6 ft. 3 in., weighs 225
j pounds, and is fast for a tackle.
Guards—The guard spot at Michi
! gan has been weakened with the
i graduation of four-year lettermen
■ Dom Tomasi and Stuart Wilkins,
i but it is still as strong as any guard
; spot in the nation. Probable starters
j here are Lloyd Heneveld and Don
| aid McClelland.
Center — Robert Erben is Michi
gan's only holdover from last
year's offensive line, will probably
see all of the big "M's" offensive
duties Saturday. Coming in on de
fense is iincbacker Tony Mom sen—
who is 6 ft. 2 in., 210 pounds of
| tackier.
All in all, Michigan is a nice foot
; ball team —from Coach Oosterbaan's
j viewpoint. From an opponent's
viewpoint they arc big, experienced,
rugged, and just downright g-o-o-d.
It will be an interesting contest to
morrow at 2:30 in the Stanford Sta
dium.

last year's spring practice. Dufek
sparked all of the Wolverines'
drives last week.
Halfback—Here we find the much
publicized (deservedly) Ail-Ameri
can candidate Chuck Ortmann, who
was probably Michigan's best back
last year. Ortmann, a junior, is
Michigan's best passer, flipping for
seven TD's last season. The smiling
left halfback scored twice last year,
carrying the ball 92 times for a total
of 237 yards.
At the right halfback spot is
"Bump" Elliot's able successor, Leo
Koccski. Koceski is a junior, a good
punter, scored seven times last sea-

son, and had a 3.87-yards-per-carry
in 67 times at bat. Koceski is an
excellent pass receiver—las) year lir
caught 22 passes for a total of 41!)
ya ids.
A third all - around halfback is
Walter TVninua, who has played all
of the baekficld positions. He is
Michigan's best punter, and was
rated the best back on the field last

I Saturday against Michigan State.
' He scored four touchdowns last sea
| son and passed for another one. Mis
punting average for the 1048 sea
! son was 3D.8.
Quarterback —This, is the weakest
spot in the Wolverine backfield, but
nevertheless has several worthy
: candidates plugging for it: Bill
Bartlett, formerly of Navy, was
given the starting nod last week, but
it was sophomore Bill Putich of
Cleveland, Ohio, who flipped the
winning touchdown pass for Michi
gan last week. Bartlett, who won a
letter last year understudying for
Pete Elliot, will probably start
against Stanford, however.
Ends — Irvin Wisniewski, "The
Whizzer," is G ft. 3 in., weighs 195.
Harry All is is Michigan's after-point
kicker and the Wolverines' third
highest scorer last season—he scored
three touchdowns and kicked 29
conversions. Oswald Clark has won
varsity football letters at both Mich
igan and Notre Dame and was the
Wolverines' best defensive end last
season. These gentlemen are three
i of the best wingmen in the country.
Tackles — Of the two greatest
tackles in the nation, Stanford will
only have to face one next Satur
day—Nomellini goes to Minnesota.
Alvin Wistert, however, plays for
I Michigan —in fact he is the Ann
! Arbor team captain. Wistert is one
! of Michigan's greatest All-Ameri
cans; the ex-Marine is unquestion
ably the finest lineman that Stan
ford will meet this season.
And holding down the other side
of the Michigan line is Allen Wahl,
who — incidentally — was an Army
Golden Gloves boxing champion.
Wahl is 6 ft. 3 in., weighs 225
j pounds, and is fast for a tackle.
Guards—The guard spot at Michi
! gan has been weakened with the
i graduation of four-year lettermen
■ Dom Tomasi and Stuart Wilkins,
i but it is still as strong as any guard
; spot in the nation. Probable starters
j here are Lloyd Heneveld and Don
| aid McClelland.
Center — Robert Erben is Michi
gan's only holdover from last
year's offensive line, will probably
see all of the big "M's" offensive
duties Saturday. Coming in on de
fense is iincbacker Tony Mom sen—
who is 6 ft. 2 in., 210 pounds of
| tackier.
All in all, Michigan is a nice foot
; ball team —from Coach Oosterbaan's
j viewpoint. From an opponent's
viewpoint they arc big, experienced,
rugged, and just downright g-o-o-d.
It will be an interesting contest to
morrow at 2:30 in the Stanford Sta
dium.


AL WISTERT


LEO KOCESKI
For two long, glorious years the Wolverines of the University of Michigan have made their
name syonymous with all that is mighty in the world of football. The title "National Champions,"
which "Fritz" Crisler's and Benny Oostbaan's excellent elevens gained at the end of the 1947
and 1948 campaigns, seemed somewhat anti-climactical in comparison with what these two great
teams had done every Saturday during the season. Michigan, then, has for the two last years

been power itself, victory plus, and
greatness in blue jerseys.
Stanford, which did not win a
game in 1047, which won but four
times in 1948, plays Michigan to
morrow in tl>e Stanford Stadium at
2:30 in the afternoon.
The Wolverine - Indian tussle
brings one big question to the fore:
Granted that the Cardinals of 1940
are a different team than the Red
shirts of the last two years. But
are the Wolverines of 1949 the same
team that rejoiced so happily on the
fields of Ann Arbor in '47 and '48?
The Midwestern scribes think they
are; the Far Western sports writers
think they arc not. And the Stan
ford varsity doesn't really care
much—they think they're going to
win anyway,
SPARTANS ARE STRONG
Michigan in her first debut last
week resembled only slightly the
powerhouse that grid immortals El
liot, Chappuis, Wiescnberger, and
Yerges sparked two years ago.
Against an admittedly powerful
Michigan State eleven, the Wolver
ines made hut 89 yards on rushing
plays, and a none too staggering 115
yards via the air ways. The final
score, 7-3, was somewhat less than
the '47 and '48 clubs offered the
Michigan rooting sections.
The 1947 Wolverines averaged 39
points or so per game to their op
ponents' nebulous 4 per. The 1947
Wolverines beat a weaker Michigan
State club 55-0. The 1948 national
champions had more trouble with
the Spartans, beating them only 13-
7, but for the season the lads of the
Ann Arbor Athletic Club averaged
around 26 points per game to the
opponents' 5. Michigan in the past
has always been—at worst —a rea
sonably decisive ball club.
It is readily pointed out that the
team that the Wolverines faced last
Saturday is one of the 10 strongest
in the nation; that the contest is a
"grudge game"—not comparable to
the Big Game, but still very bitter;
and that it was Michigan's first con
test. The only stable statistic to
come out of last week's tangle is
Michigan's punting average, which
was 38.9—about 10 yards less than
Stanford's average this season.
LOST DEFENSIVE LINE
It is also interesting to note that
the Ann Arborites lost the ball
three times via the fumble medium
last week, but this too can be at
tributed to the "first game" and the
"grudge game" status of the strug
gle.
A study of Michigan's personnel
is the one thing that adequately
shows the terrible striking power of
the Midwcsterners. Going down
their roster man for man, there arc
few teams in the nation that pre
sumably can stay in the same sta
dium with them, much less match
their awesome strength.
The loss of nearly their entire of
fensive line.f and their first-string 1
quarterback, will affect the potency j
of the Wolverines amazingly little.
Some of the depth is gone in the
line, but the first two strings wc
composed of potential All - Ameri
cans. The backfield might is unbe
lievable—strong even for Michigan
—especially at fullback and half
back. A dearth of experience at
the field-general post is probably
the only weak spot in Coach Ooster
baan's wonderful eleven. Here's how
the kids stack up:
BY POSITION
Fullback — Michigan's spinning '
crew is probably the strongest in
the country. Tom Peterson, short,
stocky 185-poundcr, was Michigan's
high scorer last year. Tom is rated
along with '47's Weiscnburger as a
spinning fullback — half halfback
and half magician. Last year Pctcr

son personally accounted for 55
points and threw three more touch
down passes.
Defensive fullback — Dick Kemp
thorn has been described as "de
structive as dynamite" and is un
doubtedly one of the greatest line
backers in football. He's a good ball
carrier, and one of the best block
ing backs in the Big Ten—those who

reviewed the dying Trojans in the
1947 Rose Bowl game will vouch for
that.
But the best fullback Michigan
showed last Saturday against the
Spartan was one Donald Dufek, who
was awarded Michigan's "most im
proved player" award at the end of
last year's spring practice. Dufek
sparked all of the Wolverines'
drives last week.
Halfback—Here we find the much
publicized (deservedly) Ail-Ameri

fields of Ann Arbor in '47 and '48?
The Midwestern scribes think they
are; the Far Western sports writers
think they arc not. And the Stan
ford varsity doesn't really care
much—they think they're going to
win anyway,
SPARTANS ARE STRONG
Michigan in her first debut last
week resembled only slightly the
powerhouse that grid immortals El
liot, Chappuis, Wiescnberger, and
Yerges sparked two years ago.
Against an admittedly powerful
Michigan State eleven, the Wolver
ines made hut 89 yards on rushing
plays, and a none too staggering 115
yards via the air ways. The final
score, 7-3, was somewhat less than
the '47 and '48 clubs offered the
Michigan rooting sections.
The 1947 Wolverines averaged 39
points or so per game to their op
ponents' nebulous 4 per. The 1947
Wolverines beat a weaker Michigan
State club 55-0. The 1948 national
champions had more trouble with
the Spartans, beating them only 13-
7, but for the season the lads of the
Ann Arbor Athletic Club averaged
around 26 points per game to the
opponents' 5. Michigan in the past
has always been—at worst —a rea
sonably decisive ball club.
It is readily pointed out that the
team that the Wolverines faced last
Saturday is one of the 10 strongest
in the nation; that the contest is a
"grudge game"—not comparable to
the Big Game, but still very bitter;
and that it was Michigan's first con
test. The only stable statistic to
come out of last week's tangle is
Michigan's punting average, which
was 38.9—about 10 yards less than
Stanford's average this season.
LOST DEFENSIVE LINE
It is also interesting to note that
the Ann Arborites lost the ball
three times via the fumble medium
last week, but this too can be at
tributed to the "first game" and the
"grudge game" status of the strug
gle.
A study of Michigan's personnel
is the one thing that adequately
shows the terrible striking power of
the Midwcsterners. Going down
their roster man for man, there arc
few teams in the nation that pre
sumably can stay in the same sta
dium with them, much less match
their awesome strength.
The loss of nearly their entire of
fensive line.f and their first-string 1
quarterback, will affect the potency j
of the Wolverines amazingly little.
Some of the depth is gone in the
line, but the first two strings wc
composed of potential All - Ameri
cans. The backfield might is unbe
lievable—strong even for Michigan
—especially at fullback and half
back. A dearth of experience at
the field-general post is probably
the only weak spot in Coach Ooster
baan's wonderful eleven. Here's how
the kids stack up:
BY POSITION
Fullback — Michigan's spinning '
crew is probably the strongest in
the country. Tom Peterson, short,
stocky 185-poundcr, was Michigan's
high scorer last year. Tom is rated
along with '47's Weiscnburger as a
spinning fullback — half halfback
and half magician. Last year Pctcr

son personally accounted for 55
points and threw three more touch
down passes.
Defensive fullback — Dick Kemp
thorn has been described as "de
structive as dynamite" and is un
doubtedly one of the greatest line
backers in football. He's a good ball
carrier, and one of the best block
ing backs in the Big Ten—those who

reviewed the dying Trojans in the
1947 Rose Bowl game will vouch for
that.
But the best fullback Michigan
showed last Saturday against the
Spartan was one Donald Dufek, who
was awarded Michigan's "most im
proved player" award at the end of
last year's spring practice. Dufek
sparked all of the Wolverines'
drives last week.
Halfback—Here we find the much
publicized (deservedly) Ail-Ameri
can candidate Chuck Ortmann, who
was probably Michigan's best back
last year. Ortmann, a junior, is
Michigan's best passer, flipping for
seven TD's last season. The smiling
left halfback scored twice last year,
carrying the ball 92 times for a total
of 237 yards.
At the right halfback spot is
"Bump" Elliot's able successor, Leo
Koccski. Koceski is a junior, a good
punter, scored seven times last sea-

son, and had a 3.87-yards-per-carry
in 67 times at bat. Koceski is an
excellent pass receiver—las) year lir
caught 22 passes for a total of 41!)
ya ids.
A third all - around halfback is
Walter TVninua, who has played all
of the baekficld positions. He is
Michigan's best punter, and was
rated the best back on the field last

I Saturday against Michigan State.
' He scored four touchdowns last sea
| son and passed for another one. Mis
punting average for the 1048 sea
! son was 3D.8.
Quarterback —This, is the weakest
spot in the Wolverine backfield, but
nevertheless has several worthy
: candidates plugging for it: Bill
Bartlett, formerly of Navy, was
given the starting nod last week, but
it was sophomore Bill Putich of
Cleveland, Ohio, who flipped the
winning touchdown pass for Michi
gan last week. Bartlett, who won a
letter last year understudying for
Pete Elliot, will probably start
against Stanford, however.
Ends — Irvin Wisniewski, "The
Whizzer," is G ft. 3 in., weighs 195.
Harry All is is Michigan's after-point
kicker and the Wolverines' third
highest scorer last season—he scored
three touchdowns and kicked 29
conversions. Oswald Clark has won
varsity football letters at both Mich
igan and Notre Dame and was the
Wolverines' best defensive end last
season. These gentlemen are three
i of the best wingmen in the country.
Tackles — Of the two greatest
tackles in the nation, Stanford will
only have to face one next Satur
day—Nomellini goes to Minnesota.
Alvin Wistert, however, plays for
I Michigan —in fact he is the Ann
! Arbor team captain. Wistert is one
! of Michigan's greatest All-Ameri
cans; the ex-Marine is unquestion
ably the finest lineman that Stan
ford will meet this season.
And holding down the other side
of the Michigan line is Allen Wahl,
who — incidentally — was an Army
Golden Gloves boxing champion.
Wahl is 6 ft. 3 in., weighs 225
j pounds, and is fast for a tackle.
Guards—The guard spot at Michi
! gan has been weakened with the
i graduation of four-year lettermen
■ Dom Tomasi and Stuart Wilkins,
i but it is still as strong as any guard
; spot in the nation. Probable starters
j here are Lloyd Heneveld and Don
| aid McClelland.
Center — Robert Erben is Michi
gan's only holdover from last
year's offensive line, will probably
see all of the big "M's" offensive
duties Saturday. Coming in on de
fense is iincbacker Tony Mom sen—
who is 6 ft. 2 in., 210 pounds of
| tackier.
All in all, Michigan is a nice foot
; ball team —from Coach Oosterbaan's
j viewpoint. From an opponent's
viewpoint they arc big, experienced,
rugged, and just downright g-o-o-d.
It will be an interesting contest to
morrow at 2:30 in the Stanford Sta
dium.

For two long, glorious years the Wolverines of the University of Michigan have made their
name syonymous with all that is mighty in the world of football. The title "National Champions,"
which "Fritz" Crisler's and Benny Oostbaan's excellent elevens gained at the end of the 1947
and 1948 campaigns, seemed somewhat anti-climactical in comparison with what these two great

been power itself, victory plus, and

of the baekficld positions. He is
Michigan's best punter, and was
rated the best back on the field last

I Saturday against Michigan State.
' He scored four touchdowns last sea
| son and passed for another one. Mis
punting average for the 1048 sea
! son was 3D.8.
Quarterback —This, is the weakest
spot in the Wolverine backfield, but
nevertheless has several worthy
: candidates plugging for it: Bill
Bartlett, formerly of Navy, was
given the starting nod last week, but
it was sophomore Bill Putich of
Cleveland, Ohio, who flipped the
winning touchdown pass for Michi
gan last week. Bartlett, who won a
letter last year understudying for
Pete Elliot, will probably start
against Stanford, however.
Ends — Irvin Wisniewski, "The
Whizzer," is G ft. 3 in., weighs 195.
Harry All is is Michigan's after-point
kicker and the Wolverines' third
highest scorer last season—he scored
three touchdowns and kicked 29
conversions. Oswald Clark has won
varsity football letters at both Mich
igan and Notre Dame and was the
Wolverines' best defensive end last
season. These gentlemen are three
i of the best wingmen in the country.
Tackles — Of the two greatest
tackles in the nation, Stanford will
only have to face one next Satur
day—Nomellini goes to Minnesota.
Alvin Wistert, however, plays for
I Michigan —in fact he is the Ann
! Arbor team captain. Wistert is one
! of Michigan's greatest All-Ameri
cans; the ex-Marine is unquestion
ably the finest lineman that Stan
ford will meet this season.
And holding down the other side
of the Michigan line is Allen Wahl,
who — incidentally — was an Army
Golden Gloves boxing champion.
Wahl is 6 ft. 3 in., weighs 225
j pounds, and is fast for a tackle.
Guards—The guard spot at Michi
! gan has been weakened with the
i graduation of four-year lettermen
■ Dom Tomasi and Stuart Wilkins,
i but it is still as strong as any guard
; spot in the nation. Probable starters
j here are Lloyd Heneveld and Don
| aid McClelland.
Center — Robert Erben is Michi
gan's only holdover from last
year's offensive line, will probably
see all of the big "M's" offensive
duties Saturday. Coming in on de
fense is iincbacker Tony Mom sen—
who is 6 ft. 2 in., 210 pounds of
| tackier.
All in all, Michigan is a nice foot
; ball team —from Coach Oosterbaan's
j viewpoint. From an opponent's
viewpoint they arc big, experienced,
rugged, and just downright g-o-o-d.
It will be an interesting contest to
morrow at 2:30 in the Stanford Sta
dium.


AL WISTERT


LEO KOCESKI
For two long, glorious years the Wolverines of the University of Michigan have made their
name syonymous with all that is mighty in the world of football. The title "National Champions,"
which "Fritz" Crisler's and Benny Oostbaan's excellent elevens gained at the end of the 1947
and 1948 campaigns, seemed somewhat anti-climactical in comparison with what these two great
teams had done every Saturday during the season. Michigan, then, has for the two last years

been power itself, victory plus, and
greatness in blue jerseys.
Stanford, which did not win a
game in 1047, which won but four
times in 1948, plays Michigan to
morrow in tl>e Stanford Stadium at
2:30 in the afternoon.
The Wolverine - Indian tussle
brings one big question to the fore:
Granted that the Cardinals of 1940
are a different team than the Red
shirts of the last two years. But
are the Wolverines of 1949 the same
team that rejoiced so happily on the
fields of Ann Arbor in '47 and '48?
The Midwestern scribes think they
are; the Far Western sports writers
think they arc not. And the Stan
ford varsity doesn't really care
much—they think they're going to
win anyway,
SPARTANS ARE STRONG
Michigan in her first debut last
week resembled only slightly the
powerhouse that grid immortals El
liot, Chappuis, Wiescnberger, and
Yerges sparked two years ago.
Against an admittedly powerful
Michigan State eleven, the Wolver
ines made hut 89 yards on rushing
plays, and a none too staggering 115
yards via the air ways. The final
score, 7-3, was somewhat less than
the '47 and '48 clubs offered the
Michigan rooting sections.
The 1947 Wolverines averaged 39
points or so per game to their op
ponents' nebulous 4 per. The 1947
Wolverines beat a weaker Michigan
State club 55-0. The 1948 national
champions had more trouble with
the Spartans, beating them only 13-
7, but for the season the lads of the
Ann Arbor Athletic Club averaged
around 26 points per game to the
opponents' 5. Michigan in the past
has always been—at worst —a rea
sonably decisive ball club.
It is readily pointed out that the
team that the Wolverines faced last
Saturday is one of the 10 strongest
in the nation; that the contest is a
"grudge game"—not comparable to
the Big Game, but still very bitter;
and that it was Michigan's first con
test. The only stable statistic to
come out of last week's tangle is
Michigan's punting average, which
was 38.9—about 10 yards less than
Stanford's average this season.
LOST DEFENSIVE LINE
It is also interesting to note that
the Ann Arborites lost the ball
three times via the fumble medium
last week, but this too can be at
tributed to the "first game" and the
"grudge game" status of the strug
gle.
A study of Michigan's personnel
is the one thing that adequately
shows the terrible striking power of
the Midwcsterners. Going down
their roster man for man, there arc
few teams in the nation that pre
sumably can stay in the same sta
dium with them, much less match
their awesome strength.
The loss of nearly their entire of
fensive line.f and their first-string 1
quarterback, will affect the potency j
of the Wolverines amazingly little.
Some of the depth is gone in the
line, but the first two strings wc
composed of potential All - Ameri
cans. The backfield might is unbe
lievable—strong even for Michigan
—especially at fullback and half
back. A dearth of experience at
the field-general post is probably
the only weak spot in Coach Ooster
baan's wonderful eleven. Here's how
the kids stack up:
BY POSITION
Fullback — Michigan's spinning '
crew is probably the strongest in
the country. Tom Peterson, short,
stocky 185-poundcr, was Michigan's
high scorer last year. Tom is rated
along with '47's Weiscnburger as a
spinning fullback — half halfback
and half magician. Last year Pctcr

son personally accounted for 55
points and threw three more touch
down passes.
Defensive fullback — Dick Kemp
thorn has been described as "de
structive as dynamite" and is un
doubtedly one of the greatest line
backers in football. He's a good ball
carrier, and one of the best block
ing backs in the Big Ten—those who

reviewed the dying Trojans in the
1947 Rose Bowl game will vouch for
that.
But the best fullback Michigan
showed last Saturday against the
Spartan was one Donald Dufek, who
was awarded Michigan's "most im
proved player" award at the end of
last year's spring practice. Dufek
sparked all of the Wolverines'
drives last week.
Halfback—Here we find the much
publicized (deservedly) Ail-Ameri
can candidate Chuck Ortmann, who
was probably Michigan's best back
last year. Ortmann, a junior, is
Michigan's best passer, flipping for
seven TD's last season. The smiling
left halfback scored twice last year,
carrying the ball 92 times for a total
of 237 yards.
At the right halfback spot is
"Bump" Elliot's able successor, Leo
Koccski. Koceski is a junior, a good
punter, scored seven times last sea-

son, and had a 3.87-yards-per-carry
in 67 times at bat. Koceski is an
excellent pass receiver—las) year lir
caught 22 passes for a total of 41!)
ya ids.
A third all - around halfback is
Walter TVninua, who has played all
of the baekficld positions. He is
Michigan's best punter, and was
rated the best back on the field last

I Saturday against Michigan State.
' He scored four touchdowns last sea
