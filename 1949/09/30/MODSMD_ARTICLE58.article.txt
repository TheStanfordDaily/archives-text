# Indians Out fur Sweet Revenue; Remember 1947 Rout at Ann Arbor
## 
### JOHN HALL 
In looking over the two Michigan
battles, Stanford's only hope seems
to lie in the old axiom, "The third
time is the charm."
For if history is to repeat itself,
the Wolverines look as tough as En
ema steak. In two times to the
post they have racked up 08 points
while Stanford has sputtered around
with a measley 13.
The first time the lights went out
j was in 1902 in a game that marked
i the opening of the famous Pasadena
I Rose Bowl. Michigan poured it on
with a vicious 40-0 onslaught, which
was really something in those days.
The second Michigan lesson was
taught in 1947, this time at Ann
Arbor. Brrr, that game still creates
a chill. It was murder, The first
four times Michigan touched the
ball they scored.
Twenty-eight to nothing was the
J toll at quarter-time, then it was 41
' to 0 at half, but just when the score
| board men started looking around
for more numbers, the Indians
i pulled themselves somewhat togeth

cr, scored twice, and rode out a 49-
13 count.
But the game put Stanford on the
canvas for the remainder of the
season. It earned for them the title
of the Woe Boys, and it made it
two-for-two for Michigan.
