# CARDS, MICHIGAN IN GRID TITANIC
## 'Game of Week' to Draw 77,000 Fans to Stadium Wolverines Eye 25th Straight Victory; Indians Out to Revenge '47 Scalping 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
Tomorrow in Stanford Stadium at 2:30, Michigan the Mighty,
a grid machine whose exploits have written an indelible recot'l
in the all-time football annals during the past two years, will
tangle with a revenge-minded Stanford team which has set rsur
prised Pacific Coast football fans back on their heels during tho

Befitting such a contest, some
77.000 persons will be on hand, tho
largest crowd, excepting California
or USC games, to witness a foot
ball game in Stanford Stadium since
the 1929 Army game.
It was three years ago that the
Pacific Coast Conference teams be
gan a fight to win their way back
into a once-prominent spot in the
national grid scene. And for three
years they have received nothing
but lumps on the head for their ef
forts.
Twice Stanford has ventured forth
to shoulder its share of the battle
and twice the Cards have limped
home with stinging defeats, 13-49 to
Michigan in 1947 and 0-43 to Army
last year.
WINNING STREAK
It was just 24 games ago that
Michigan started on what was to be
come the greatest winning streak in
major college football circles.
The question the 77,000 persons
will have come to sec decided is
really manyfold.
First. Is Michigan, for two years
the kingpin of American football, to
end its great spurt here—to a Stan
ford team that has won but 6 of 21
games in the last two years?
That is the question the non-
Stanfordite will be asking, the ques
tion the average, or rabid, football
follower will be present to see de
cided.
OTHER QUESTIONS
But the other questions, the an
swers to which the Stanford stu
dents, alumni, and friends will be
awaiting, runs along different lines:
Is this the team for which we have
waited through three lean years?
Has this team, depending as it does
so much upon 18- and 19-year-old
sophomores, the stuff to continue on
its winning ways? Or were San
Jose State and Harvard far weaker
than their press notices read?
In Michigan the Indians will have
the toughest sounding board in the
nation, with the possible exception
of Notre Dame. It is indeed a fitting
challenge to the young group that
Marchie Schwartz will field.
YOUNG TEAM
And itis a young team. Only five
men who journeyed to Michigan in
1947 will be on the field tomorrow—
Don Fix, Dave Field, Ken Peck,
Mickey Titus, and Dan Mervin. The
revenge motive, however, will not
be lacking as the Card squad, to a
man, is determined to avenge the
1947 rout.
Coach Schwartz will start with
the same lineup that went into the
first two games. Tom Shaw will
handle the quarterbacking chores
with Bob White, Harry Hugasian,
and Bill DcYoung rounding out the
backfield..

Ken Rose and Rill McColl will yo
at the end spots, A 1 Rau and Gordon
White at tackles, Don Fix and Hatl
Cook at guards, and Jim Castagnoli
at center.
OTHER ACTION
That's tho way the starting lineup
reads, but there is no doubt that th»:
game will not be long under way
before A 1 Laakso. Jack Rye, Peck,
Field, Russ Pomeroy, Jesse Cone.
Dick Abraham, and Gordy Rice see
duty. These are the defensive spe
cialists though they also fill in as
offensive material from time to time.
Soph quarterback Gary Kcrko
rian, fullback Emery Mitchell, half
backs Boyd Benson. Rupe Andrews,
and Holy Boruck, if his ankle will
permit him to play, will not In
benchbound for long either.
Andrews, who has carried the ball
but twice, once for 38 yards and
again for 9. is expected to be at bis
best tomorrow. The fast, pass-catch
ing lad has improved his blocking
and now stands as one of the most,
versatile backs on the squad.
Michigan scouts were given but. ;»
glimpse of Colonel Rupert in the
first two Stanford games and it may
be that he was being saved for to
morrow.
Stanford wound up the week's
practice with a light workout yes
terday. Pass defense and pass pro
tection were stressed, but the Can I
coaches were still shaking their
heads at the thought of facing th<-
Wolverine aerial attack. In the past
Michigan has liked to throw them
long, but against defensive backs the
height of Field, Peck, and Hugasisn
they may well decide to concentrate
on the short stop passes to draw flip
defense up and then trot their bi;:
ends downfield for the long ones.
AIR ATTACK
It is no secret that the Cards ex
pect to take to the air also. Stan
ford has yet to show any offensive
ground strength up the middle and
that is of prime necessity if the
attack is to work. DeYoung's
yards per carry average has been
gathered mostly off tackle *nd
around the ends.
Emery Mitchell may be the man
to carry the team through as he did
so often last year. The hard-run
ning fullback has been used spav
ingly thus far but he is in good
shape.
The local oddsmakers, seemingly
buoyed up by the Card wins |hti:.
far, have picked Michigan by hi it
seven points.

at the end spots, A 1 Rau and Gordon

OTHER ACTION
That's tho way the starting lineup

game will not be long under way
before A 1 Laakso. Jack Rye, Peck,
Field, Russ Pomeroy, Jesse Cone.
Dick Abraham, and Gordy Rice see
duty. These are the defensive spe

offensive material from time to time.

rian, fullback Emery Mitchell, half
backs Boyd Benson. Rupe Andrews,
and Holy Boruck, if his ankle will
permit him to play, will not In
benchbound for long either.
Andrews, who has carried the ball
but twice, once for 38 yards and
again for 9. is expected to be at bis
best tomorrow. The fast, pass-catch
ing lad has improved his blocking
and now stands as one of the most,
versatile backs on the squad.
Michigan scouts were given but. ;»
glimpse of Colonel Rupert in the
first two Stanford games and it may
be that he was being saved for to
morrow.
Stanford wound up the week's
practice with a light workout yes
terday. Pass defense and pass pro
tection were stressed, but the Can I
coaches were still shaking their
heads at the thought of facing th<-
Wolverine aerial attack. In the past
Michigan has liked to throw them
long, but against defensive backs the
height of Field, Peck, and Hugasisn
they may well decide to concentrate
on the short stop passes to draw flip
defense up and then trot their bi;:
ends downfield for the long ones.
AIR ATTACK
It is no secret that the Cards ex
pect to take to the air also. Stan
ford has yet to show any offensive
ground strength up the middle and
that is of prime necessity if the
attack is to work. DeYoung's
yards per carry average has been
gathered mostly off tackle *nd
around the ends.
Emery Mitchell may be the man
to carry the team through as he did
so often last year. The hard-run
ning fullback has been used spav
ingly thus far but he is in good
shape.
The local oddsmakers, seemingly
buoyed up by the Card wins |hti:.

Tomorrow in Stanford Stadium at 2:30, Michigan the Mighty,
a grid machine whose exploits have written an indelible recot'l
in the all-time football annals during the past two years, will
tangle with a revenge-minded Stanford team which has set rsur
prised Pacific Coast football fans back on their heels during tho

Befitting such a contest, some
77.000 persons will be on hand, tho
largest crowd, excepting California
or USC games, to witness a foot
ball game in Stanford Stadium since
the 1929 Army game.
It was three years ago that the
Pacific Coast Conference teams be
gan a fight to win their way back
into a once-prominent spot in the
national grid scene. And for three
years they have received nothing
but lumps on the head for their ef
forts.
Twice Stanford has ventured forth
to shoulder its share of the battle
and twice the Cards have limped
home with stinging defeats, 13-49 to
Michigan in 1947 and 0-43 to Army
last year.
WINNING STREAK
It was just 24 games ago that
Michigan started on what was to be
come the greatest winning streak in
major college football circles.
The question the 77,000 persons
will have come to sec decided is
really manyfold.
First. Is Michigan, for two years
the kingpin of American football, to
end its great spurt here—to a Stan
ford team that has won but 6 of 21
games in the last two years?
That is the question the non-
Stanfordite will be asking, the ques
tion the average, or rabid, football
follower will be present to see de
cided.
OTHER QUESTIONS
But the other questions, the an
swers to which the Stanford stu
dents, alumni, and friends will be
awaiting, runs along different lines:
Is this the team for which we have
waited through three lean years?
Has this team, depending as it does
so much upon 18- and 19-year-old
sophomores, the stuff to continue on
its winning ways? Or were San
Jose State and Harvard far weaker
than their press notices read?
In Michigan the Indians will have
the toughest sounding board in the
nation, with the possible exception
of Notre Dame. It is indeed a fitting
challenge to the young group that
Marchie Schwartz will field.
YOUNG TEAM
And itis a young team. Only five
men who journeyed to Michigan in
1947 will be on the field tomorrow—
Don Fix, Dave Field, Ken Peck,
Mickey Titus, and Dan Mervin. The

Tomorrow in Stanford Stadium at 2:30, Michigan the Mighty,
a grid machine whose exploits have written an indelible recot'l
in the all-time football annals during the past two years, will
tangle with a revenge-minded Stanford team which has set rsur
prised Pacific Coast football fans back on their heels during tho

Befitting such a contest, some
77.000 persons will be on hand, tho
largest crowd, excepting California
or USC games, to witness a foot
ball game in Stanford Stadium since
the 1929 Army game.
It was three years ago that the
Pacific Coast Conference teams be
gan a fight to win their way back
into a once-prominent spot in the
national grid scene. And for three
years they have received nothing
but lumps on the head for their ef
forts.
Twice Stanford has ventured forth
to shoulder its share of the battle
and twice the Cards have limped
home with stinging defeats, 13-49 to
Michigan in 1947 and 0-43 to Army
last year.
WINNING STREAK
It was just 24 games ago that
Michigan started on what was to be
come the greatest winning streak in
major college football circles.
The question the 77,000 persons
will have come to sec decided is
really manyfold.
First. Is Michigan, for two years
the kingpin of American football, to
end its great spurt here—to a Stan
ford team that has won but 6 of 21
games in the last two years?
That is the question the non-
Stanfordite will be asking, the ques
tion the average, or rabid, football
follower will be present to see de
cided.
OTHER QUESTIONS
But the other questions, the an
swers to which the Stanford stu
dents, alumni, and friends will be
awaiting, runs along different lines:
Is this the team for which we have
waited through three lean years?
Has this team, depending as it does
so much upon 18- and 19-year-old
sophomores, the stuff to continue on
its winning ways? Or were San
Jose State and Harvard far weaker
than their press notices read?
In Michigan the Indians will have
the toughest sounding board in the
nation, with the possible exception
of Notre Dame. It is indeed a fitting
challenge to the young group that
Marchie Schwartz will field.
YOUNG TEAM
And itis a young team. Only five
men who journeyed to Michigan in
1947 will be on the field tomorrow—
Don Fix, Dave Field, Ken Peck,
Mickey Titus, and Dan Mervin. The
revenge motive, however, will not
be lacking as the Card squad, to a
man, is determined to avenge the
1947 rout.
Coach Schwartz will start with
the same lineup that went into the
first two games. Tom Shaw will
handle the quarterbacking chores
with Bob White, Harry Hugasian,
and Bill DcYoung rounding out the
backfield..

Ken Rose and Rill McColl will yo
at the end spots, A 1 Rau and Gordon
White at tackles, Don Fix and Hatl
Cook at guards, and Jim Castagnoli
at center.
OTHER ACTION
That's tho way the starting lineup
reads, but there is no doubt that th»:
game will not be long under way
before A 1 Laakso. Jack Rye, Peck,
Field, Russ Pomeroy, Jesse Cone.
Dick Abraham, and Gordy Rice see
duty. These are the defensive spe
cialists though they also fill in as
offensive material from time to time.
Soph quarterback Gary Kcrko
rian, fullback Emery Mitchell, half
backs Boyd Benson. Rupe Andrews,
and Holy Boruck, if his ankle will
permit him to play, will not In
benchbound for long either.
Andrews, who has carried the ball
but twice, once for 38 yards and
again for 9. is expected to be at bis
best tomorrow. The fast, pass-catch
ing lad has improved his blocking
and now stands as one of the most,
versatile backs on the squad.
Michigan scouts were given but. ;»
glimpse of Colonel Rupert in the
first two Stanford games and it may
be that he was being saved for to
morrow.
Stanford wound up the week's
practice with a light workout yes
terday. Pass defense and pass pro
tection were stressed, but the Can I
coaches were still shaking their
heads at the thought of facing th<-
Wolverine aerial attack. In the past
Michigan has liked to throw them
long, but against defensive backs the
height of Field, Peck, and Hugasisn
they may well decide to concentrate
on the short stop passes to draw flip
defense up and then trot their bi;:
ends downfield for the long ones.
AIR ATTACK
It is no secret that the Cards ex
pect to take to the air also. Stan
ford has yet to show any offensive
ground strength up the middle and
that is of prime necessity if the
attack is to work. DeYoung's
yards per carry average has been
gathered mostly off tackle *nd
around the ends.
Emery Mitchell may be the man
to carry the team through as he did
so often last year. The hard-run
ning fullback has been used spav
ingly thus far but he is in good
shape.
The local oddsmakers, seemingly
buoyed up by the Card wins |hti:.
far, have picked Michigan by hi it
seven points.
