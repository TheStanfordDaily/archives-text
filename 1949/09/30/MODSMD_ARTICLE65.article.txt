# TOMORROW morning
## Frosh Footballers Open Season Against Jayvees 
### DICK KLEIN 
The freshman footballers cavort in
the Stadium for their initial test to
; morrow morning. Kickoli is set for
j eleven o'clock with the experienced
' .'ayvees for opponents.
Under the critical eye of Coach
Chuck Taylor and his assistants, Don
Campbell, Bob Ghilotti, and Bob
i Kohrer, the yearling squad is rapidly
J haping upto into a smooth-looking
j unit.
With plenty of strength at guards
and tackles the '53ers look like an
i other top freshman outfit, but with
I the game-wise junior varsity with
1 two games already under the kelt,
j will be plenty tough.
TA Y'LOIt SPLITS SQUAD
i Coach Taylor split the freshmen
j into separate elevens during the
J week. Part of the time, the second
string moved over to the varsity
practice to scrimmage the Michigan
-1 hungry first-stringers.
Dave Eldredge, a clever signal
caller from the Hawaiian Islands,
j quarterbacked the second unit.
Sparked by the left-handed pass
' ing ol Joe St. Ceme, the tentative
I first-stringers countered for good
gains in a dummy scrimmage against
J the third eleven on the frosh field.
The fleetness of Dick Gargiulo, a
' 10-flat sprinter from down South,
| and the hard-to-stop, power running
of former Ply Higher Skip Crist, top

, fullback, ground out most of the
l yardage.
Earlier in the week, a flock of
j new candidates for the yearling out-
I fit were worked into the plays and
! defensive set-ups. New defenses to
stop the single-wing plays of the
j jayvees were gone over by all the
defensive units.
VAN SANT INJURED
Out with a pulled muscle in his
thigh, Tummy Van Sant missed most
I of the week's action. He'll probably
! be ready for the junior varsity tiff
; tomorrow. Another halfback new
tocner Peterson was hurt yesterday
! afternoon. He'll sii. the ballgame out
| with a bum ankle. Guard Don Fon-
I tana is also out with a bad knee.
Wjth no lineup available for the
I jayvees, the tentative starters, ac
j cording to Coach Taylor, lor the
frosh eleven will be.
