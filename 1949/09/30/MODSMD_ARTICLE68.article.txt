nounced yesterday afternoon that
the annual all - University mitt
tourney will be held either the lat
ter part of November or early De

This year's tournament will be

In addition to the open competition
to determine University champions,
a separaate novice bracket will be
formed for men who have had no
previous experience.
This latter division will constitute
an intramural boxing tournament,
and winners of the various weight
classes will be awarded regular in

Any man who desires to enter the
novice competition, and might want
some instruction between now and
tourney time, has been asked to
contact Lunny at Encina Gym.
Lunny has volunteered his spare
time services for this purpose and
will probably conduct such training
classes on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons of each week.
Lunny also disclosed that he will
be assisted with the varsity coach
ing this year by Ferris Boothe, a
former all-University welterweight
champ and two-year varsity per
former who is now enrolled in the
Stanford Law School.
Stanford's varsity boxing squad
will not go into official training un
til the beginning of winter quarter.
