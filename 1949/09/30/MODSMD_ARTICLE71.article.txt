# PCC: ROUNDUP
## Oregon-UCLA Clash Tonight Brunk Returns to Cal Lineup for OSC Game 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Coast Conference spotlight
will focus on the Los Ange'.es Coli
seum tonight when either UCLA or
' Oregon will be toppled from the
| undefeated ranks. The question of
' just how strong the Bruins are
| should be decided once and for all.
Despite the fact that Deke Houl
| gate rates the Uclans as number one
j in the nation, the Southerners have
! yet to prove themselves. They ran
up 7(J points aganist Oregon State
| and lowa, but the latter are defi
| nitely second-rate outfits.
FIRST TEST
Oregon's victories were also won
at the expense of weak opposition in
i the person of St. Mary's and Idaho.
; So it promises to be the first real
test for both teams, with Oregon
I getting the nod by dint of superior
' backfield speed.
Up at Seattle the Washington
I Huskies will risk their collective
necks against powerful Notre Dame
in what promises to be no contest.
Washington's 40,0000 capacity sta
dium has been sold out since last
| March; it's the magic name of Notre
Dame which attracts them, not tin
expectation of a Washington vic
tory.
BRI NK RETURNS
California should have little
i trouble with Oregon State at Pprt
; land. The return of Frank Brunk
I strengthens the Bear backfield, but
the Beavers are always tough on
their home field and may surprise.
The Bears will be away for two
consecutive weeks, as they travel
to Wisconsin next Saturday.
Southern California should roll
against Washington State at the
Coliseum tomorrow. Phil Sarboe
claims he has his best team since the
war, but the Cougars' one-touch
down win over Montana last week
wasn't too impressive.
In other games Texas figures to
trounce Idaho by !J0 points or more
while Sunta Clara should have little
trouble with Fresno State.
