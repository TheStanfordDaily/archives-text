"DESTRUCTIVE AS DYNAMITE" .... That's what the Michigan press releases have to say
about Dick Kempthorn, big Michigan fullback whp is being hailed by his followers as one of
the greatest line backers in football. Dick, currently playing his third varsity year for Benny
Oosterbaan, was an outstanding star of the 194 8 Rose Bowl game and continued his bruising
tactics all of last year as a ball-toter, blocker, and defensive wizard. â€”Palo Alto Times photo
