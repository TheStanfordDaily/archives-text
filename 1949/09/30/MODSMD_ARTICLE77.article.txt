# Peerless Pickers Tab Cards; Give Nod to Bears, UCLA, USC
## 
### 
Here we go again!
The Stanford Daily Peerless Pick
ers' Association, composed entirely
! of sportswriters who naturally don't
know any better, has once more
! placed its collective neck on the
chopping block of public criticism.
I Please don't rush down to your fa
j vorite bookie and lay your summer's
j earnings on our choices; but in case
you're interested, here are our pre
dictions of things to come in Satur
day's grid wars:
Stanford-Michigan: The third re
newal of the rivalry between these
two schools has captured first in
i terest not only from Coast fans, but
| from the nation in general. Stanford
is plenty fast and hasn't even ex
plored its full air potentialities as
yet, but the Wolverines have drive
! and savy to spare. The oddsmakers
I are calling this one for the pack by
seven points, but we'll stick to Stan
i ford by three.
California - Oregon State: . Al
! though the writers have shown a
] tendency to overplay the Bears'
strength on the basis of their first
i two games, they still play a mighty
I good game of football over at Ber
keley. At least good enough to lick
the thus-far impotent Beavers. Cal
j by nine.
Southern California - Washington
! State: The Figueroans, pre-season
1 favorites to take the New Year's ex
cursion to Pasadena, will make it a
cle.' n sweep for the Coast's Big
I Three tomorrow at the Coliseum,

according to the pickers. USC looks I
22 points better, and that's playing I
it conservative.
UCLA-Oregon: This one is also at
the Coliseum, but tonight. The sur
prising Bruins will get their first
real test of the year against last
year's co-champs; but they haven't
shown enough stuff as yet to rate
the nod over a powerful Webfoot
crew. Oregon by nine.
Wisconsin by 6 over Illinois.
Northwestern by 15 over Pitt.
Ohio State by 8 over Indiana.
Oklahoma by 15 over Texas A&M. j
