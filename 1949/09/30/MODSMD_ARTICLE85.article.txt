### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29 (/P)—
A federal court jury alter four clays' !
deliberation convicted Mrs. Iva To- j
guri D'Aquino last night of a 1
charge of treason growing out of j
"Tokyo Rose" broadcasts from radio
Tokyo during the war.
The dog-tired jury of six men and
six women found her guilty of just j
one of the eight charges of tree*on j
—that of making a broadcast con- 1
corning loss of American ships.
The jury, which took the rase at
11:44 a.m. Monday, twice turned I
down Federal Judge Michael J.
Roche's offers of a recess in order |
to drive toward a verdict.
As the verdict was announced j
there was a general exclamation of

"Oh!" in the courtroom. Most of the
spectators throughout the 12-week
trial had expected acquittal.
Tokyo Rose, 33, born in Los An
geles and educated at UCLA, will
be sentenced October 6.
She freely admitted broadcasting
for pay over radio Tokyo to Ameri
can troops in wartime, but she ve
hemently denied making any of the
scurrilous, frightening, or taunting
remarks attributed to her by a
prosecution parade of ex - service
men witnesses.
A canvas backdrop with scenes of
horror, death, bombing, and war
prison intrigue seemed to dwarf the
central figure of the thin little al
mond - eyed womai, scribbling on
her tablets at the defense stand.
