# HEALTH COMMITTEE
## Houck—'Asset to Student Government' 
### 
Only a year-old baby in Excom's
family of .spccial committees, the
I student health committee has al
| ready progressed to the point where
il is characterized by Health Serv
ice Director Dr. G. H. Houck as
| "one of the most valuable assets
Stanford student government pos
| sesses."
■ Dr. Houck might well be proud
1 of this student group, for in a very
' real sense it is actually "his baby."
'I The realization by Dr. Houck that
j "everyone is represented at the
Health Service except the students"
; led to the committee's formation last
i year.
The committee's number one job
was to obtain a closer contact be
tween students and members of the
Health Service staff. However, not
only did chairman Dave Baty and
! his group accomplish this, but they
I also realized that the Health Serv

ice facilities were outdated and in
adequate to handle the increased
number of students.
BUILDING PROGRAM
Health Service administrators had
been advocating a new building
program for many years, but no ac
tual plans had ever materialized.
Through the efforts of the commit
tee, however, land has now been
laid aside, sketches and plans made,
and the cause of the new student
health building advanced greatly. In
fact, Dr. Houck credits the commit
tee with accomplishing in one year
what the staff had been trying to
get done for eight or ten.
The source of information that
would be provided by the group in
case of an emergency such as an
epidemic shows another potential
use of the committee.
Getting back to the formation of
the committee lost year, Dr. Houck

mentioned that tliis was not the first,
time the plan Had been tried at
Stanford. Some thirty years ago
there had been a similar student
group working with the Health
Service, but for some unknown rea
son it had been discontinued.
GOOD RECORD
"We felt that through the agency
of student government we could im
prove our Health Service for all
concerned, and if last year's record
of the student health committee is
any criterion, wo were absolutely
correct," said Dr. Houck.
This year's committee will be
named Wednesday night at the Ex
eoin meeting. Those interested in
serving on the group should contact
their Excom representatives imme
diately.

with the Union planning commit
tee will he featured in The Daily.)
