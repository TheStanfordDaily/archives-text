# Wolverines Show They're Still Champs, Despite Heavy Loss of Key 1948 Stars
## Cards Outclassed; Need to Improve To Handle UCLA 
### JOHN BREIER 
They may not be the cham- |
pions of old, but the 1949 Michi- j
gan football team will do as
such until something better
comes along. That's the opin-1
ion they left in the minds of
88,000 fans and the Stanford
football team Saturday. The 27
to 7 score doesn't tell the whole
story.
It was just a case of too much
experience, too much finesse, too
much know- how, and too much
football for the Cards. The touch
down-hungry Wolverines took al
most complete charge of the game
frbm the starting whistle to the j
final gun.
BRUINS ROUGH
Touch though the game was, the
Cards have turned to meet a new*
threat. They will host a surprising
ly tough UCLA team this week. And
the Bruins, in case you may not
know, are undefeated in three
games. They looked mighty good in
downing last year's PCC co-cham
pionship Oregon team 35 to 27 last
Friday.
There was a general feeling of
disgust prevalent among the Indians
after the Michigan game. They had
! muffed the chance to beat the
champ, and in so doing, let down
' their coach and school, or so they
| thought.
But the after - game talk went
along much more charitable lines.
Stanford had met a better football
team; a better team in all ways—
drive, defense, poise, and whatever
it takes 1o make a top-notch team.
FUMBLES COSTLY
The constant pressure put on by
the Wolverines caused the five cost
j ly fumbles, two of which cost the
Indians the ball at times they had
seemed to be on the move.
It may well have been this pres
sure that caused the Cards to miss
blocks and tackles in wholesale lots.
If Michigan linebackers Dick Kemp
] thorn and Anton Momsen were
j blocked out of more than ton plays
| during the afternoon it would come
| as a surprise to most of the fans.
CARDS OUTMANNED
But that was the way it went all
down the line. The Michigan team
outmanned the Cards almost mem
' her for member, or so it appeared.

The Indians are a better team
than they showed Saturday. Usu
ally dependable men dropped
passes, easy passes. The pass throw
ers for the most part hit their rc
receiver at the time the ball gets
didn't seem to want to keep the ball.
Of course, it isn't easy to gather in
passes when the defenders hit the
reecivcr at the time the ball gets
there. But that is what makes for
good pass defense, and that is just
what the Card defenders didn't do.
LINE CRUSHED
Poor as was the Card aerial game, j
both on ofTonse and defense, the j
game was lost in the line. What
speed the Indians did have wasn't
given a chance. Wide plays were
not used until late in the game, and
the power plays were smothered be
fore they, got under way. Stanford
averaged but 2.9 yards per carry.
'Ihe aweSofrie part of the whole
thing was the, machine-like manner
in which the Wolverines went about
winning the game. They trapped
the guards and tackles, double
teamed on the reverses with terrible
efficiency, and handled the Card
ends all day.
It was only late in the game that
the Reds put together an offensive
drive that wet 46 yards and ended
in Boyd Benson scoring from four
yards out.
TOUGHEST FOE
The picture has a brighter side,
though it was hard to see it, during
find immediately after the game.
The Cards lost to the first or second
best team in the nation. They will
not meet another like it this year.
It can be figured that a lot of the
mistakes were made because Michi
gan was so good. They controlled
! the ball and that, in the end, is what
| wins ball games.
UCLA comes next, then Washing
ton. UCLA will cause trouble. They
seem to have recovered from last
year's blues. But neither of these
teams can approach Michigan in of
fense or defense.
CARDS LEARN
Our boys should have learned
| something from the game. Team
I members say they did anyway. UC
j LA uses much the same type of
' offense though they work more from
I the short punt formation.

Stanford's offense shouldn't bog
down again this year as it did Sat
urday. The team was very down
hearted after the game. It isn't ev
ery day you get a chance at the
nation's best. But they should
bounce back well. After all, the
conference season doesn't start un
til this week for Stanford.
That certain post-season tilt isn't
lost yet. no, not by any means.


PLAYERS SCRAMBLE for the ball in the first period of the game, as Michigan fumbles on a
running play. Although it doesn't look like he's going to make it, Stanford's Harry Hugasian

ford's Ken Rose (end). —AP Wirephoto
