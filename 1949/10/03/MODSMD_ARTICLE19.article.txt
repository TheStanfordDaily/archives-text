NEW YORK, Oct. 2 (AP)—lt's the New York Yankees ontl
Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series.
In a nerve-stabbing climax to the closest double-barreled fin
ish in 41 years, these neighborhood rivals staggered to league
championships with last-gasp victories today.

Uiey barely made it.
The resourceful Yankees, banged
and battered all year by a never
ending series of injuries, stood off .«
last-inning rally to repel the Boston
Red Sox, 5-3, at Yankee Stadium.
That gave them the American
League pennant by a single gnmc
The dashing Dodgers were forced
to ten innings by the Phillies at
Philadelphia but managed to bull
through for a 0-7 victory that gave
them the national title by a si mi
larly thin margin over the St. I.oni •
Cardinals.
St. Louis' old pros, who wore ex -
pected to stand up better than nil in
the torrid stretch, broke a four •
game losing streak to last the Chi •
cago Cubs, 13-5. But it was too late.
Thus the Bombers from the Bronx
and the Bums of Flatbush begin
feuding for the world championship
Wednesday at "Yankee Stadium.
It's the third time the two havf
: met for baseball's highest prize, (In-
Yankees subduing the Dodgers, four
games to one, in 1941 and 4-3 in
1947.
The World Series is scheduled to
go right on through without a letup,
! The Dodgers are at Yankee Stadium
Wednesday and Thursday and then
i they move oer to Ebbets Field !i
! act as hosts Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, barring a sweep. In cys<-
j the series lasts that long, the final
two games are set for Yankee Stadium
| dium the following Monday and
Tuesday, October 10-11.
Not since 1908, when the Chicago
Cubs and Detroit Tigers won in
j major league races that carried
I three teams in each league down to
! the wire, has the sport witnessed
j such a stirring windup as this.
It was the second straight season
! the gold-plated Red Sox, a leant
built by Tom Yawkey's million •,
j were nosed out at the last minute
: A year ago they lost a play oil with
Cleveland after finishing in ;t tie
| for the lead.
It was a bitter dose, too, for lie
62-year-old Manager Joe McCai •
thy of the Sox, who saw his pen
nant hopes shattered in the same
expansive stadium where he ltd l.hr
Yankees to eight American League
pennants and seven world cham
pionships.
