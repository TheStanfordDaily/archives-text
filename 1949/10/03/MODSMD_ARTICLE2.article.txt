# Steel-Coal Strike Hits
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH — The first double- j
barreled steel-coal strike, idling i
nearly a million /nen, battered the ;
nation's economy today. There's no i
sign of peace.
Labor's twin- pension dispute with !
industry is costing millions in wages j
and profits. Business, too, is hurt, j
Philip Murray, CIO Steelworker :
president, and John L. Lewis, United |
Mine Workers chieftain, are leading j
labor's fight.
Their demands for benefits —and
industry's refusal—led to the walk- I
outs of 513,000 steelworkers and I
100.000 soft coal diggers.
