						Goal Worth Shooting For

The University's official "Ratio of Grade
Points to Registered Units" scoresheet for last
year appears on page 1 of today's Daily.
It is a complex table which divides the stu
dent body up according to sex and living
groups, and which classifies these groups as
to scholarship by means of an arbitrary point
system. For that reason the schedule holds
little importance for most students —it's just a
curiosity piece,
Not so for fraternity men. There's a ruling
that scholastically-minus pledges of houses
that fall below all-men's average may not
move into the fraternity house and that mem
bers who are on probation must live out until
they bring up their own grades or until the
house scholarship again equals all-men's aver
age.
The key phrase is "all-men's average."
Last spring the all-men's grade-point aver
age was 2.59. Broken down by living groups
it is found that men living in University Resi
dence Halls had a scholarship mark of 2.65;
that male students not living in organized resi
dence groups hit 2.61; and that fraternities
trailed with 2.44.
Of the 24 fraternities on campus only eight
managed to equal or better the all-men's aver
age of 2.59. This means that minus pledges
and members on probation may not live in the
remaining 16 houses this fall.
Although it works a hardship on members
of houses that fall below the academic line,
this seems to be a fair ruling.
Without doubt, fraternity grade points are
higher now than they would be if such a rule
were not enforced. There is a real incentive,
or "pressure" if you like, on houses to improve
their scholarship. Without the rule it is doubt
ful if Stanford fraternities would seriously at

tempt to improve the academic standing ol
their members as they are doing now.
Quiet hours schedules are presently en
forced at nearly all houses and improved
grades are the responsibility of every fra
ternity man.
Considering the makeup of the average fra
ternity and the unstudylike conditions that
will always exist to some extent in fraternity
houses regardless of what steps are taken, it
seems unlikely that all 24 houses will ever go
over all-men's average.
But it's a goal worth shooting for.
