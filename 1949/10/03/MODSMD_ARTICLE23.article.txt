# Those Duck-Bill Caps
## 
### 
The actions of Rally Committee have always
intrigued us; so it was only natural that this
new rooter cap move should come under our
surveillance. It turned out that the whole
affair was not an extra-legal push to make
money for some higher-ups among the Com
mittee, but seems to be quite on the level.
Rally Com simply decided to have a new
style of caps that year, and Excom approved
the move. The explanation of why the new
caps is not too clear. Officials of R.C. say
that the bills keep the sun out of one's eyes,
apparently overlooking the fact that Stanford
rooters face the sun only once every two
years.
No one is being forced, or even urged, to
buy the new caps if they don't wish. It's like
the year the longer skirts came in—you saw
both the old and the new. Personally, we al
ways liked the the old ones better, if only for
the reason that they were different from SC's
and UCLA's.
Well, we never did pretend to understand
Rally Com. — jM.K.
