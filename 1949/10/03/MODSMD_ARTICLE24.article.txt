# BULL SESSION

### BILL DAILEY 
As that prominent Chicago philosopher, Dave
Garroway, once said, "In the spring, a young man's
fancy .... in the winter he's a slob." And in the
autumn, young men who are masquerading as news
paper columnists sit down at their little typewriters

to tell the readers of the Penin
sula's Only Morning Fish-wrap
per what happened during the
summer," or "Remember, you
present: "What went on thL?
summer " or "Remember, you
read it here last."
Rita and Ali announced this
summer that they were expecting
their first child. As soon as the
baby is born, they are going to set

up light nouseKeeping. All they have to do now is
find a vacant lighthouse.

But the Prince and his Princess were not the only
ones who were feeling romantic this summer. I
liked Bob Hope's crack about Vice-President Bark-
Jey's romantic duing. (Y'know, the Veep, and who
inhell ever thought that one up?). Hope quipped
that he didn't know if the Vice-President and Mrs.
Hadley were going to get married, but if they did, the
ceremony was going to be held in the U.S. Treasury,
.so they could save the price of a choir. It seems
that a couple ol fellas named Bevin and Sir Stafford
Cripps are already there singing "Oh Promise Me."
!â€¢ or some reason there was an onrush of would-be

swimmers of the English Channel. One of the few
peddlers who succeeded in making the crossing sup
posedly entered the water right after attending a
champagne party. No, Myrtle, he wasn't a Beta.
One of the local bars introduced a new drink this
summer which a customer suggested they call a
"Grand Coulee.' It was dam near water.
A new company came out with a different kind of
chopped baby food. This, of course, is foolish. Alter
all, how many people have chopped babies.
My father spent three months in the county jail
and composed some music while he was there. His
cell had 32 bars on it. His music wasn't really bad,
it was just a little delinquent.
The summer also saw the beginning of an adver
tising campaign which is funny enough to rate a free
pitch here. I'm referring to the ad campaign of the
makers of Strykers Soap. (Ah ha, this'll keep me
in soap for the rest of the quarter!)
Some of their very honest ads went like this:
"Ladies, use our soap on your husband. No other
soap will leave him so lustrous, yet so easy to
manage." Or: "Our soap doesn't contain Solium
(Rinso), Nofoolium, Baloneyum, or any other magic
formula; it's just good soap." Or: "Our soap is the
only soap which is used for washing other soap
when it gets dirty."
Myself, what did I do ihis summer? I was working
on a farm, picking fruit. I was a talent scout for
Finocchio's.
