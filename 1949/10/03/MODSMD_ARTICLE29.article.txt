# Gaease Paint Troupers Wanted for '49 Gaieties
## 
### 
If you get thrilled over grease
paint and opening night excitement
—if you think you've got hidden
talent that only a spotlight could re
veal—then the place for you tonight
is at the tryouts for the 1949 Big
Game Gaieties.
On stage or back stage, the Gaie
ties needs students for a tremendous
variety of jobs. Director Jim Haran
is looking for singers, both solo ami
members of the ensemble; dancers;
actors; and people with specialty
numbers.
For those with a less well-devel
oped streak of exhibitionism, the
Gaieties offers positions on the
stage, lighting, and painting crews.
Girls who can sew are urged to
work on the costume crew.
Musically, the Gaieties needs a
rehearsal pianist, and the orchestra

needs more members.
Tryouts and signups for all these
jobs will be held tonight, tomorrow
night, and Wednesday night from
7:30 to 10 in the Ram's Head room,
located downstairs in the back of
Memorial Hall. Dancers are asked
to wear suitable clothes for trying
out.
Ram's Head is the student dra
matic organization which produces
Gaieties, Spring Show, and three
original one - act plays each year.
Points toward membership are
earned by working in these shows.
The highest number of points is
given for crew work.
The magnitude of this year's Gai
eties means lots of openings, and
lots of help needed. No previous
experience is required and every
one has an equal chance, Haran
emphasized.


MORE FUN! Five members of last year's Gaieties cast are
shown at rehearsal here during a lighter moment.
