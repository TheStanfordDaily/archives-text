### 
FRANKFURT, Germany â€” Thou
sands of Eastern Germans coming
by foot, car, and bicycle streamed
across the border today to sample
(he economic plenty of the Western
zones.
The Russians relaxed their border
controls at a number of crossing
points to encourage Western Ger
mans to participate in gigantic
"World Peace Day" demonstrations
throughout the Eastern zone, but
only about 500 Germans were re
ported to have taken advantage ol
Ihe holes in the Iron Curtain to go
East.
