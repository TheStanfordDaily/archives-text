# On Your Dial-880

### 
Tonight some lucky Stanford coed
will reign supreme on Jim Crooker's
"Orchid for a Queen" show. Maybe
it will be someone you know. May
be it will be you. Tune in at 9:30
to find out.
At 10:30 Stanford Sadie will agaifi
put her charm to work. The Sultry
One will attempt to beguile studious
roughs away from their books.
Strictly not for those with high
blood pressure. Sadie should not
be tuned in if you have a test to
morrow.
