### 
Problems of students who commute
are being eased through the aid of
Alpha Phi Omega, national service
fraternity.
A year and a half ago, when the
commuting population of Stanford
was growing and organized coop
eration among commuters was
needed, Alpha Phi Omega began
compiling lists of students who trav
eled to the campus each day;
For the past lour quarters the fra
ternity has conducted a signup of
commuters on registration day. Lists
of those signing up were compiled
and mailed to all who had registered.
These lists contained names, ad
dresses, and information on trans

portation available or needed.
Contact of individual commuters
was left to those in need of trans
portation, or with room in their cars.
However, a file of cards was kept
for students who had not signed up
on registration day.
Over 100 commuters had regis
tered with the fraternity by the
second day of registration this quar
ter. Lists will be mailed as before,
and the file will be available at the
ASSU office when it is completed.
Until that time interested students
may contact Kichard Konig, Alpha
Phi Omega president.
Southern Pacific train schedules
were changed last spring to accom
modate commuters with 8 o'clock
classes. The early train now arrives
in Palo Alto at 7:52 a.m., giving eight
minutes for a quick dash to the
campus. No further changes in the
schedules are planned.
