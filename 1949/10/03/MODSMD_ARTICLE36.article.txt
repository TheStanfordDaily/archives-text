# PCC Power Threatens Stanford Prominence
## UCLA Strong in 35-27 Oregon Rout; Trojans, Bears Score Lopsided Wins 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The UCLA Bruins issued a warning to the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in general and Stanford in particular Friday night as they
outscored a favored Oregon eleven 35 to 27. The Uclans will
provide the Indians with their first conference competition next
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
The Cards now have seven game.s remaining to play, six of

which are conference tilts. At pres
ent UCLA, USC, and Cal appear to
he the biggest obstacles while OSC,
Washington, and Idaho are definite
ly weak sisters.
Santa Clara, the only non-confer
once opponent, has improved con
siderably since their opener against
the Bears, as was borne out by their
53 to 0 rout of Fresno State, and will
be a tough nut to crack by October
29 when they take on the Indians.
BRUINS OUTPLAY DUCKS
The Bruins' Friday night victory
over Oregon was far more lopsided
than the score indicates. UCLA out
gained the Ducks on the ground 310
yards to 38 and out-first-downed
the northerners 21 to 8. Two lucky
prayer passes which happened to
connect provided the Webfoots with
a pair of touchdowns.
Bruin halfback Ernie Johnson
really had a big night for himself.
UCLA's optional pass-run play from
the single wing featuring Johnson
had the Ducks baffled. All told,
Ernie ran up 118 yards running and
passed for an additional SG.
It was the third straight victory
for the rejuvenated Bruins under
their new coach Red Sanders, and
proves that their lopsided wins over
Oregon State and lowa were defi
nitely not flukes.
HUSKIES SCARE IRISH
The Washington Huskies gave
Notre Dame a temporary scare Sat

urday up in Seattle. The Huskies
scored in the first quarter on a pass
fÂ«om Don Ileinrich to Roily Kirkby
and managed to hold the South
Benders to a 7-7 tie at half-time.
But the Irish got rolling in the
second half and went on to win 27
to 7.
A California team which is still
riddled with injuries continued its
winning ways by trouncing flu-rid
den Oregon State 41 to 0. Once
again little Charlie Sarver was the
sparkplug. He carried the ball ten
times and gained 116 yards for an
average of 11.6 yards per carry. Not
bad for ii guy who wasn't even first
string last year.
TROJANS SLUGGISH
Southern California reverted to its
usual early-season style of play as
the Trojans stumbled to a 35 to 7
victory over Washington State. The
first half ended in a 7 to 7 tie, but
the superior Trojan manpower fi
nally decided the issue as the Cra
vathmen scored a pair of touch
downs in each of the final two quar
ters.
After last week's impressive win
over Navy when the Trojans dis
played an efficient and well-round
ed attack it appeared that finally a
USC team would reach top form
before the final week of the season.
But last Saturday's performance
marked a return to the usual pat
tern of Cravath-coached teams.
At Austin, Texas, the Texas Long
horns scored 49 points in the second
half (which must be some kind of
a record) while routing Idaho 5G
to 7. The score was actually tied at
half time, but Idaho lost control of
the situation after that, and the
Texans ran wild.
