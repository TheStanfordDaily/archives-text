# LOCKER ROOM
## Cards Awed By Michigan Adroitness 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford knows now why Michi
gan has won 25 straight football
games. The Wolverines showed
their stuff to 88,000 and all were
convinced.
After the batt'e was over and the
Indians had walked back to their
dressing quarters, the scene was ex
actly what you would expect of a
squad which has just dropped a
game it_ thought it might win.
Disappointed and i m pressed.
That's the way most of the Stanfords
felt. They were disappointed be
cause they weren't able to do what
they wanted. They were impressed
with Michigan's all - around sock,
both offensively and defensively.
CAN'T MAKE MISTAKES
Consensus of opinion was that
"you can't make mistakes and beat
a team like Michigan."
Which was true, oh so true, as it
was the two early fumbles which
ended, probably more than any
thing else, Stanford's chances for
the day.
But there should not be too much
sadness on the outcome. The Cards
lost to a great football machine, and
they lost respectably. Because, even
after being knocked around for
three quarters, they came back to
score in the fourth, and were driv
ing into Michigan territory as the
gun sounded.
And they were not afraid of
Michigan. Time and again they
gambled for yardage on the last
down. Most of the time they made
it.
INDIANS LIKE BOXER
Prescott Sullivan of the Examiner
drew a good parallel of the Stanford
situation. He said, "Like an up and
coming boxer rushed along too fast,
Stanford was thrown in against the
j champ before it was ready."
Perhaps on another afternoon,
with everything going just right,
perhaps, things might be a little dif
ferent. Just perhaps.
Marchie Schwartz was full of
praise for the Wolverine defense.
He said that he agreed 100 per
cent with Ben Oosterbaan that
Dick Kempthorn was one of the
i best line - backers he had ever
I seen.
However, he stated that "this
j Michigan team isn't as good as the
1947 outfit. That was a dream team."
Asked about the Stanford stand
outs, Schwartz thought that "Russ
Pomeroy played some steady guard
| in the first half, Dave Field made
some nice tackies, and Emery
Mitchell turned in an excellent all â€”
j around performance."
ANDREWS LOOKS GOOD
He also liked the pass catching
| and running of Rupe Andrews, who
had a very good clay.
Aside from that, there wasn't
much to say. His boys had been
j beaten by a better bal'.club.
But it was no disgrace. And be-
J sides, the conference race doesn't
! start until next week.
Rough though the game was, only
A 1 Rau of the Indians may be out
of the UCLA game. The veteran
tackle suffered another rib injury
and may be sidelined. Boyd Benson
was hit in the eye but should be
able to go Saturday.
