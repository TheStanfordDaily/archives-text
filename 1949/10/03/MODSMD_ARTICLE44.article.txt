## Frosh Team Clips Braves Taylormen Power To 27-13 Triumph 
### DICK KLEIN 
Showing great strength at tackle !
and guard positions, the latest !
; freshman powerhouse easily pasted
a 27-13 defeat on the inept junior
j varsity in Saturday's preliminary.
Coach Chuck Taylor's frosh !
j punched over a score in every pe- j
I riod, and allowed only one real sus- i
tained drive by the Braves. That j
drive came in the second period, and
; featured the single wing patterns
that they had learned to scrimmage
the varsity.
Throughout the game, sloppy play
by both outfits bogged down the at
tacks. Poor tackling, no downfield
j blocking, and a whole brace of fum
i bles, six by each side, left a lot to
| be desired.
Not to take anything from the
I '53ers, who surprised everybody
| with plenty of power, the yearlings
j have the stuff for another cham
pionship outfit. Norm Manoogian
played up to his advance notices at
j the guard slot.
Co-captains A 1 Hanner and Tom
Romano, also fine guard prospects,
and tackles John Broderick, Jim
Vic, Hayden Leason, and Ken Dow
ney all did a fine job of outplaying
the experienced jayvtfe line. And
; coping with the likes of such top
j prospects as Dave Worley, Owen
; Powell, and Bo Raisch was no small
I task.
The quarterbacking of Joe St.
! Geme and Dave Eldredge showed
I flashes of brilliance and was cer
tainly good. Probably the most
promising play was uncorked by
Skipper Crist. The hard - charging
fullback countered for good gains
and was tough to haul down.
For halfbacks the freshmen came
j up with Wes Laubscher, who reeled
off the longest run of the day,
speedy Dick Gargiulo, and Tommy
Van Sant, a strong defender who
had to leave the game with a twisted
j ankle.
The scoring plays went something
, like this:
The frosh kicked off. and before
tfie*"jayvees got rolling* they com
mitted the first bobble of the game.
; On their first offensive play, the
Papooses tallied on a trap pass play
from St. Geme to Ron Eadie, who
raced the rest of the way unmolest
ed. The play was good for 50 plus
! yards and then Crist converted,
i After another freshman drive
pooped out with a penalty and a
fumble, the jayvees made their lone
: drive of the game. Bickel scored on
a quarterback sneak, while the con
version was missed. The touchdown
! was set up by a Bickel - to - Dean
Shepherd pass to the four.
Taking the kick-off, Laubscher
produced his "play of the game." He
I grabbed up the ball on the 13. and
| then proceeded up the middle ol
! the field through the entire junior
varsity. Wes received very little
help from his mates, but his adver
! saries couldn't make a tackle. Crist
converted again. Half score: 14-6.
Crist finally scored via ihe touch
down route in the third period. He
plunged over from the two, and then
! while trying for his third straight
! extra point, got smashed by a
charging junior varsity line.
Both squads hit the scoring col
umn in the last period. Sub half—
; backs Lippold and Garrett made
long runs for the tallies, and Pow
ell and Crist kicked good. This com
! pleted the scoring.

Throughout the game, sloppy play
by both outfits bogged down the at
tacks. Poor tackling, no downfield
j blocking, and a whole brace of fum
i bles, six by each side, left a lot to
| be desired.
Not to take anything from the
I '53ers, who surprised everybody
| with plenty of power, the yearlings
j have the stuff for another cham
pionship outfit. Norm Manoogian
played up to his advance notices at
j the guard slot.
Co-captains A 1 Hanner and Tom
Romano, also fine guard prospects,
and tackles John Broderick, Jim
Vic, Hayden Leason, and Ken Dow
ney all did a fine job of outplaying
the experienced jayvtfe line. And
; coping with the likes of such top
j prospects as Dave Worley, Owen
; Powell, and Bo Raisch was no small
I task.
The quarterbacking of Joe St.
! Geme and Dave Eldredge showed
I flashes of brilliance and was cer
tainly good. Probably the most
promising play was uncorked by
Skipper Crist. The hard - charging
fullback countered for good gains
and was tough to haul down.
For halfbacks the freshmen came
j up with Wes Laubscher, who reeled
off the longest run of the day,
speedy Dick Gargiulo, and Tommy
Van Sant, a strong defender who
had to leave the game with a twisted
j ankle.
The scoring plays went something
, like this:
The frosh kicked off. and before
tfie*"jayvees got rolling* they com
mitted the first bobble of the game.
; On their first offensive play, the
Papooses tallied on a trap pass play
from St. Geme to Ron Eadie, who
raced the rest of the way unmolest
ed. The play was good for 50 plus
! yards and then Crist converted,
i After another freshman drive
pooped out with a penalty and a
fumble, the jayvees made their lone
: drive of the game. Bickel scored on
a quarterback sneak, while the con
version was missed. The touchdown
! was set up by a Bickel - to - Dean
Shepherd pass to the four.
Taking the kick-off, Laubscher
produced his "play of the game." He
I grabbed up the ball on the 13. and
| then proceeded up the middle ol
! the field through the entire junior
varsity. Wes received very little
help from his mates, but his adver
! saries couldn't make a tackle. Crist
converted again. Half score: 14-6.
Crist finally scored via ihe touch
down route in the third period. He
plunged over from the two, and then
! while trying for his third straight
! extra point, got smashed by a
charging junior varsity line.
Both squads hit the scoring col
umn in the last period. Sub half—
; backs Lippold and Garrett made
long runs for the tallies, and Pow
ell and Crist kicked good. This com
! pleted the scoring.
