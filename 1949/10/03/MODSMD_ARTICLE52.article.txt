# Commuters Plan Protest
## 
### 
Organizing to block a possible
Southern Pacific rate increase, over
800 Peninsula civic officials and
commuters last night formed thq,
Peninsula Protective Association.
Patrick J. Kearns, attorney and
former mayor of San Carlos, warned
the mass meeting at Sequoia High
School auditorium that unless the
S.P. decides to be "halfway reason
able," there will be an exodus from
this area.
The proposed boost, which runs as
high as 8(5 per cent, was described
by Kearns as the latest in a "can
cerous" series of increases in recent
years. "It's a progressive disease,"
he said, "and you must get a doctor
to cut out that cancerous growth."
The Peninsula Protective Associa
tion announced that it intends to re
tain attorney Marvin Handler of
San Mateo to represent it before
the California Public Utilities Com
mission. Handler has appeared be
fore that body for years. Howard
Magee of Redwood City was named
chairman; Fred H. Chestnut of San
Mateo, engineer; and Jack South of
Millbrae as publicity director.
"The commuters have made the
S.P. as powerful as it is," attorney
Kearns declared. "The S.P. as far as
the commuting public is concerned
is a Frankenstein monster. We need
the unanimous vote of all the cities
and organizations so the S.P. will
know it is no longer the master but
the servant," he insisted.
The railroad received increases in
19.'5fi and\in 1947. The one presently
under fire runs from 18 to 86 per
i cent.
