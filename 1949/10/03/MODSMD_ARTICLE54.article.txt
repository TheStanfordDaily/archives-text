# "White Heat' Is One Gangster Picture Not forgotten When Cartoon Starts
## 
### AL BERRY 
Good gangster films are usually
quite painless, usually quite pleas
ant, and usually forgotten as soon as
the cartoon starts. "White Heat,
currently being screened at the
Redwood, stars James Cagney in
one ol' his greatest roles, and it will
not be easily forgotten.
There is more to recommend this'
flick than the over - abundance of
gun play. In retrospect, the thing
may seem a bit over-done: train
robberies, prison breaks, and mur
ders clone with wonderful casual
ness. But at the time Cagney's
characterization of a psychopathic
gang leader seems very real, very
stirring, and extremely entertain
ing. "White Heat" is a good motion
picture.
The script, which incidentally is
well done, deals with one Cody Jar-

ret (Cagney) who is the proud pos-

sessor of a bit of
hereditary insan
ity. The only
thing that keeps
this happy killer
from going com
pletely off his
buzzer is his
sweet old mother
who wants her

boy to be on "top of the world." To
achieve this miraculous ascension
Cody is leading a band of charming
lads who would kill their mothers
for a dime, and end up killing
Cody's for only slightly more.
Another nice factor in the flick is
Virginia Mayo, who does a very re
spectable job of portraying Cody's
very disreputable wife. Miss Mayo,
who looks splendid in nightgowns,
under - things, etc., has somehow
learned to act better since her last

picture. The elYect is very good.
The great J. C. at his best is ma«-
nificent. He is at his best in this
one.
It was so exciting that 1 forgot
to eat my candy bar.
