# Atom Question

### 
WASHINGTON—A wide divsiion
of opinion raised the possibility to
day that Congress will delay until
next year any final verdict on the
handling of Atomic Energy Com
mission affairs.
Some members forecast that the
Senate-House Atomic Committee —
split wide open over a proposed re
port on its lengthy investigation of
the AEC—will find it almost impos
sible to arrive at any majority find
ings before Congress quits for the
year.
