# USC Elects President
## Non-Fraternity Man Wins Office 
### 
USC students, after two elections
and a referendum, have finally
elected themselves a student body
president.
Bob Padgett edged out Ed Vier
heilig last Thursday by 205 votes in
a re-run of last spring's disputed
contest.
In reporting the election, the
Daily Trojan announced yesterday
that Bob Padgett is the first non
fraternity student body president in
the history of the paper.
Padgett is supposed to be the first
independent elected in 27 years, but
an actual record of the last inde
pendent president seems to be non
existent.
The whole trouble started last
spring the day after Vierheilig was
elected student body president. Of
ficial count found that there were
370 more votes than registration
cards.
The defeated candidate, joined by
a great number of interested stu
dents, requested further investiga
tion which was denied by the stu
dent Senate.
The students, realizing that they
had been betrayed by a majority of
the Senate, which had ratified the
inadequate election report, respond
ed in an overwhelming manner to
referendum petitions expressing
their disfavor of Senate action.
The Senate tried to change the
referendum to a recall, but was
forced by public opinion to hold
the referendum election during the
spring semester finals.
The referendum was successful,
and a new election was scheduled
for this fall.
The new election, held Thursday,
put Padgett into office and was ac
cepted as official by the Senate. Ev
ery ballot was accounted for, ancf
there were no reports of discrepan
cies or attempted manipulations.
