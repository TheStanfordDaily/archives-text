# MORE LATE DATES
## Review of Women's New Late Leave Plan Presented 
### 
Tlic amended late leaves plan for j
J women, which was passed by AWS
' last spring quarter, lias gone into cf
fect this quarter. Together with the
Demerit System, which was put to
; use last quarter, these late leaves
\ constitute the revised social regula
j lations on which the AWS social
! regulations committee, headed by
Marilyn Schwartz, has been work- j
ing since last year.
The new late leaves plan gives the
j women more responsibility hy sep
arating social regulations from aca- j
! demic standards. Each woman re
ceives a certain quota of late leaves ,
per quarter. Quotas vary according j
to class, no matter what a woman's j
grade average is.
The late leaves in this quota may
be used at any time hut no more |
j will be granted. The old system of
regular 1 :30 late leaves and floaters
is no longer in use. More leaves will
bo given to a student as she pro
gresses in class.
First - quarter freshmen are al-j
lowed 24 1:30 late leaves, five of 1

which may he 2:3o's. Second- and
third - quarter freshmen have 30
1 :.">() late leaves but still can use only
live as 2:3o's.
Sophomores get 40 I:3o's and can
use 10 of them as 2:30 s. A quota of
55 l:3o's has been assigned to the
juniors, who can turn 15 of those
into 2:3o's. Seniors have unlimited
l:3o\s and can take 20 2;3o's.
The first-quarter freshman quota,
which is the lowest one, is divided
into periods of one week. Freshmen
can take two late leaves at any time
during the week and leaves not used
in one week can be carried over to
the next They are also given three
extra late leaves which they can
take any time during the quarter.
The quota system is in effect from
the day a woman student arrives at
the University until the day she
leaves for between-quartcrs vaca
tions. Leaves from the quota must
he used during the holidays that
come during the quarter.
The Bonus and Demerit systems
are still in effect as a carryover from

last quarter. Each woman may be
a total of 15 bonus minutes late
during the quarter before her late
returns count as demerits. Only
three bonus slips arc permitted per
quarter.
One demerit is given for a late
return of 30 minutes over the bonus
or five lockouts totaling a half-hour
or less. Three offenses or eight tech
nicals also constitute one demerit.
An offense is failure to sign in or
out or taking more leaves than the
quota. A technical is an error in
filling out the sign-out slip.
The demerit record is accumula
tive throughout the undergraduate
years. When a woman has four de
merits she may be put on social
probation, and when she has five she
is liable to be suspended from the
University.
These new systems of social
standards arc designed to give the
woman student more responsibility
in co-ordinating her social and aca
demic affairs, Doris Cooper, presi
dent of Women's Council, said.

the day a woman student arrives at
the University until the day she
leaves for between-quartcrs vaca
tions. Leaves from the quota must
he used during the holidays that
come during the quarter.
The Bonus and Demerit systems
are still in effect as a carryover from

last quarter. Each woman may be
a total of 15 bonus minutes late
during the quarter before her late
returns count as demerits. Only
three bonus slips arc permitted per
quarter.
One demerit is given for a late
return of 30 minutes over the bonus
or five lockouts totaling a half-hour
or less. Three offenses or eight tech
nicals also constitute one demerit.
An offense is failure to sign in or
out or taking more leaves than the
quota. A technical is an error in
filling out the sign-out slip.
The demerit record is accumula
tive throughout the undergraduate
years. When a woman has four de
merits she may be put on social
probation, and when she has five she
is liable to be suspended from the
University.
These new systems of social
standards arc designed to give the
woman student more responsibility
in co-ordinating her social and aca
demic affairs, Doris Cooper, presi
dent of Women's Council, said.
Tlic amended late leaves plan for j
J women, which was passed by AWS
' last spring quarter, lias gone into cf
fect this quarter. Together with the
Demerit System, which was put to
; use last quarter, these late leaves
\ constitute the revised social regula
j lations on which the AWS social
! regulations committee, headed by
Marilyn Schwartz, has been work- j
ing since last year.

! demic standards. Each woman re
ceives a certain quota of late leaves ,
per quarter. Quotas vary according j
to class, no matter what a woman's j
grade average is.
The late leaves in this quota may
be used at any time hut no more |
j will be granted. The old system of
regular 1 :30 late leaves and floaters
is no longer in use. More leaves will
bo given to a student as she pro
gresses in class.
First - quarter freshmen are al-j
lowed 24 1:30 late leaves, five of 1

which may he 2:3o's. Second- and
third - quarter freshmen have 30
1 :.">() late leaves but still can use only
live as 2:3o's.
Sophomores get 40 I:3o's and can
use 10 of them as 2:30 s. A quota of
55 l:3o's has been assigned to the
juniors, who can turn 15 of those
into 2:3o's. Seniors have unlimited
l:3o\s and can take 20 2;3o's.
The first-quarter freshman quota,
which is the lowest one, is divided
into periods of one week. Freshmen

during the week and leaves not used
in one week can be carried over to
the next They are also given three
extra late leaves which they can
take any time during the quarter.
