Athletic Director Al Masters feels like a
boxer who's leading with his chin these days.
The reason is that an unprecedented de
mand by alumni has forced the Athletic De
partment to limit students to one-rooter's ticket
for the Big Game this year.
In words of one syllable this means that
there will be no public sale of tickets and stu
dents will not have the chance to buy an extra
pair of seals for their family or friends that they
have always had.
Summer Excom made it official on August
17 when it put its stamp of approval on Mas
ters' recommendation that alumni be given
first crack at tickets this year. Ordinarily, the
Summer Quarter Executive Committee, as an
interim group, isn't empowered to make such
decisions, but time was short and the Athletic
Department couldn't wait until fall to get the
ASSU's support.
The reasoning behind the move is simply
one of arithmetic. For the benefit of those who
haven't seen the classification breakdown al
ready, here's where Stanford's share of the
Big Game tickets will go this year:
Class I—Student1 —Student rooters. 8,150 tickets re
served on basis of expected enrollment.
Class 2—Stadium subscribers. Approxi
mately 580 tickets will be distributed to living
Stadium subscribers.
Class 3—Staff members, faculty, working
press, and comps for team members. 2,500
tickets.
Class 4- Buck of the Month Club. 4,600
tickets.
Class s—Block "S" award winners. Ap
proximately 1,500 tickets.
Class 6A—Life members of the Alumni As
sociation. 10,000 tickets.
Class 6B - Annual members of the Alumni

Association. Only 4,170 tickets left for this
group. Many annual paid Alumni Association
members who did not file applications early
will not receive tickets.
Class 7—Non-paid alumni. No tickets avail
able for this group. All money received with
applications from this class was refunded in
mid-August.
The figures add up to 31,500 which is Stan
ford's share of the Stadium according to a 15-
year pact signed by the two schools. The rest
of the 90,000 seats, or 65 per cent of the tick
ets, will go to California.
The reason for the discrepancy is the dif
ference in size between the schools. Both
Stanford and Cal have been trying to boost
their end of the 35-65 ratio for years but to no
avail.
Masters had enough ticket applications on
his desk July 1 to fill the Stadium nearly five
months hence, and with more checks rolling
with every mail he knew he was bound to be
come a pretty unpopular fellow before the
thing was over.
Nestled somewhat uncomfortably between
the devil and the deep blue sea, he reasoned
that present students will be alumni a lot long
er than they will be in school and therefore the
old grads should be allowed first chance at
the tickets as far as they go. Besides, the Uni
versity doesn't want to alienate any more po
tential donors than it has to.
Although students at other universities are
almost never allowed to buy extra tickets to
traditional games when seats are in short
supply, Athletic Director Masters is the first
to admit that Stanford students have a legiti
mate gripe.
"About all I can do is keep ducking," he
cays.
We agree.
