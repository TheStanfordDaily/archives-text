### JOHN HALL 
It happened again. I was hoping that the deluge
was over, but yesterday another one of those intelli
gent conversationalists about campus asked ine,
"Well, John boy, how was the summer?"
"Seeing ;;s how that little one-line quiz has been

bounced around Quad (pro
nounced kwadd by the regulars)
tu the exhaustion point lately, I
snarled simply, "Okav, pal, okay."
Okay. ThatV a jour-letter word
meaning "What in hell does it
matter? Kight now it's October,
early in the week to boot, I've
yet to crack my book for Biz Law,
our football team just blew one,
and in the first place, I don't like
the silly smile on your lace any
way."

But, my conversationalist friend uian t seem to
get it, because he started to follow up with the dou
ble-or-nothing query, "How'd your grades come out?"
This got me. I had to struggle hard to overcome
a hastily-formed plan to beat him over the head
with his own psych book and drag him out behind
the Beta house to quietly bleed to death. But, finally,
1 managed an ' okay, pal, okay."
Okay. '1 hat's another four-letter word meaning
"I wuz robbed. 1 had a B-plus average going into
the finals and ended with a C-minus stab. But you
can't do anything about it, so why ask?"
This didn't bother the gook in the slightest, but
just a« he was about to tell me he had gone plus 30,
another victim strolls by, and the Quiz Man gets

that silly look on his face, and he sez, "Well, Jim boy,
how was the summer."
At this point, I remembered a previous engagement,
and ran to the Cellar where all of a sudden I didn't
even mind the bees.

Fate turns out some strange products at times, but
fate and all, I never figured that Bill Dailey and I
would be sharing this same space.
For, once upon a time Dailey and I started life
together as freshman roommates. What memories.
It seems like only yesterday that we were clean-cut
American youths, trying hard to adjust to the Stan
ford way.
We were a great combination. Every night before
learning the Stanford way, sometimes pronounced
El Camino Real, we would sit in our old room 245
Encina and talk about persons we had met that day.
Dailey would say something funny about the person,
and then I would say something sarcastic. When we
ran out of people, we practiced on path other.
We had another roommate whom we drove com
pletely out of his mind. He moved to Toyon and de
cided to give up college life to become a student.
It was great while it lasted, but like Faye and
Elliott, our twosome broke up.
1 did a stretch on Upper Row, and Dailey is still
doing time down at the Sigma Chi house. So, like
two empty canoes, we drifted apart. But now, after
all the hardships, we're back together. Dailey's still
being funny, and I'm still trying to sound like Sam
Spade.
The moral to the story is: Take poison now, it
acts faster than Western beer.

doing time down at the Sigma Chi house. So, like
two empty canoes, we drifted apart. But now, after
all the hardships, we're back together. Dailey's still
being funny, and I'm still trying to sound like Sam
Spade.
The moral to the story is: Take poison now, it
acts faster than Western beer.

It happened again. I was hoping that the deluge
was over, but yesterday another one of those intelli
gent conversationalists about campus asked ine,
"Well, John boy, how was the summer?"
"Seeing ;;s how that little one-line quiz has been

bounced around Quad (pro
nounced kwadd by the regulars)
tu the exhaustion point lately, I
snarled simply, "Okav, pal, okay."
Okay. ThatV a jour-letter word
meaning "What in hell does it
matter? Kight now it's October,
early in the week to boot, I've
yet to crack my book for Biz Law,
our football team just blew one,
and in the first place, I don't like
the silly smile on your lace any
way."

But, my conversationalist friend uian t seem to
get it, because he started to follow up with the dou
ble-or-nothing query, "How'd your grades come out?"
This got me. I had to struggle hard to overcome
a hastily-formed plan to beat him over the head
with his own psych book and drag him out behind
the Beta house to quietly bleed to death. But, finally,
1 managed an ' okay, pal, okay."
Okay. '1 hat's another four-letter word meaning
"I wuz robbed. 1 had a B-plus average going into
the finals and ended with a C-minus stab. But you
can't do anything about it, so why ask?"
This didn't bother the gook in the slightest, but
just a« he was about to tell me he had gone plus 30,
another victim strolls by, and the Quiz Man gets

that silly look on his face, and he sez, "Well, Jim boy,
how was the summer."
At this point, I remembered a previous engagement,
and ran to the Cellar where all of a sudden I didn't
even mind the bees.

Fate turns out some strange products at times, but
fate and all, I never figured that Bill Dailey and I
would be sharing this same space.
For, once upon a time Dailey and I started life
together as freshman roommates. What memories.
It seems like only yesterday that we were clean-cut
American youths, trying hard to adjust to the Stan
ford way.
We were a great combination. Every night before
learning the Stanford way, sometimes pronounced
El Camino Real, we would sit in our old room 245
Encina and talk about persons we had met that day.
Dailey would say something funny about the person,
and then I would say something sarcastic. When we
ran out of people, we practiced on path other.
We had another roommate whom we drove com
pletely out of his mind. He moved to Toyon and de
cided to give up college life to become a student.
It was great while it lasted, but like Faye and
Elliott, our twosome broke up.
1 did a stretch on Upper Row, and Dailey is still
doing time down at the Sigma Chi house. So, like
two empty canoes, we drifted apart. But now, after
all the hardships, we're back together. Dailey's still
being funny, and I'm still trying to sound like Sam
Spade.
