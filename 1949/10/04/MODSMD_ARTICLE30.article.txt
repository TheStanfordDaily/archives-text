# Excom to Select New Union Planning Head
## Work on Initial Unit of Tresidder Memorial May Begin Next Year 
### WALLY WHITE 
Planning for the Tresidder Union will swing into a new phase
tomorrow night when Excom appoints a chairman for the Union
Planning Committee.
Last year it was decided to erect a long-planned new student
union as a memorial to Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, University presi-

dent who died early in 1948. To
plan and coordinate, the ASSU |
Union Planning Committee was j
created. This little-known com- I
mittee's job was to discover student j
opinion on the subject and to make j
plans, subject to approval by a
student-faculty committee.
Last year's committee expired at
the end of the school year. Tomor
row night Excom members will sug
gest names, and Excom will appoint
a new chairman. Within a week
the chairman will hold interviews to
choose six or eight members for his
committee. Part of their job will be
to chat with other students, to find
out just how the students want the
memorial built. In a joint student
faculty committee, the chairman, to
gether with Hank Rosin, ASSU
president, will work on final ap
proval of student plans.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
Last year Ted Norton headed the
band of workers. "His committee
burrowed into the maze of sugges
tions, plans, and illusions which had
grown up around the idea of a
Tresidder Memorial, and came up
with a usable yardstick, "first things
first."
"Constructing a unit at a time,"
said Norton in his report to the
ASSU, "seems to us the best way
to have 'first things first'." Norton's
committee determined what facilities
would be needed in a new student
union, and then proposed the fol
lowing order of construction:
1. A unit including a restaurant
(to take the place of the Cellar) and
a ballroom.
2. Second unit, an office building
for student government.
3. Third unit, a social and recrea
tional building.
The committee did not attempt to
prescribe further construction since
changing conditions may create
changing needs. They did not make
precise recommendations, as further
research will be required to lind
out how many people the i-estau
-1 rant should hold, etc.
PROBABLE LOCATION
The new Union will probably be
constructed on Santa Teresa Street,
near the present Student Union. Its
growth will mean the razing of Oaks
Residence, and possibly of the Cor
poration Yard.
Buff walls, red tile roofs, and Ro
manesque arches were claimed by
last year's committee as the students'
choice, but final decision will depend
on current opinion and cost.
Funds for the memorial are being
collected from three sources —dona-
i tions in Dr. Tresidder's memory,
! profits from the present Union, and
money from a "dollar per student
per quarter" plan. Under this plan,
the ASSU, through petition to the
University, is granted a 'dollar from
each student's tuition. The plan was
used formerly for the building of
' Memorial Hall. When the hall was
j paid for, proceeds were switched to
j the Union fund,
By the end of spring quarter, the
I Union fund contained $200,000. Nor-
I ton's committee expected that the
total would rise to $300,000 in 1949-
50. If this happened, they said, con
j struction on the first unit should
start in 1950 or 1951. The committee
; urged that construction not be
I started on any unit until enough

money to pay for that entire unit is
safely in the coffers.
With a tentative general plan
chiseled out, last year's committee
has left a more definite job for its
successor. Those who are appointed
during the next week will make de
tailed plans on how a ballroom
should be constructed. Plans for a
restaurant, however, should be left
to experts, said Norton's committee.
"Students," the committee said,
"have no particular special knowl
edge of restaurant construction or
management Students, how
ever, do hfeve considerable expert
knowledge of ballrooms and the
planning and holding of dances."
Those interested in serving on
this year's committee should con
tact their Excom representatives im
mediately.

FIRST THINGS FIRST
Last year Ted Norton headed the
band of workers. "His committee
burrowed into the maze of sugges
tions, plans, and illusions which had
grown up around the idea of a
Tresidder Memorial, and came up
with a usable yardstick, "first things
first."
"Constructing a unit at a time,"
said Norton in his report to the
ASSU, "seems to us the best way
to have 'first things first'." Norton's
committee determined what facilities
would be needed in a new student
union, and then proposed the fol
lowing order of construction:
1. A unit including a restaurant
(to take the place of the Cellar) and
a ballroom.
2. Second unit, an office building
for student government.
3. Third unit, a social and recrea
tional building.
The committee did not attempt to
prescribe further construction since
changing conditions may create
changing needs. They did not make
precise recommendations, as further
research will be required to lind
out how many people the i-estau
-1 rant should hold, etc.
PROBABLE LOCATION
The new Union will probably be
constructed on Santa Teresa Street,
near the present Student Union. Its
growth will mean the razing of Oaks
Residence, and possibly of the Cor
poration Yard.
Buff walls, red tile roofs, and Ro
manesque arches were claimed by
last year's committee as the students'
choice, but final decision will depend
on current opinion and cost.
Funds for the memorial are being
collected from three sources —dona-
i tions in Dr. Tresidder's memory,
! profits from the present Union, and
money from a "dollar per student
per quarter" plan. Under this plan,
the ASSU, through petition to the
University, is granted a 'dollar from
each student's tuition. The plan was
used formerly for the building of
' Memorial Hall. When the hall was
j paid for, proceeds were switched to
j the Union fund,
By the end of spring quarter, the
I Union fund contained $200,000. Nor-
I ton's committee expected that the
total would rise to $300,000 in 1949-
50. If this happened, they said, con
j struction on the first unit should
start in 1950 or 1951. The committee
; urged that construction not be
I started on any unit until enough

money to pay for that entire unit is
safely in the coffers.
With a tentative general plan
chiseled out, last year's committee
has left a more definite job for its
successor. Those who are appointed
during the next week will make de
tailed plans on how a ballroom
should be constructed. Plans for a
restaurant, however, should be left
to experts, said Norton's committee.
"Students," the committee said,
"have no particular special knowl
edge of restaurant construction or
management Students, how
ever, do hfeve considerable expert
knowledge of ballrooms and the
planning and holding of dances."

Last year it was decided to erect a long-planned new student
union as a memorial to Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, University presi-

dent who died early in 1948. To

created. This little-known com- I
mittee's job was to discover student j
opinion on the subject and to make j
plans, subject to approval by a
student-faculty committee.

The committee did not attempt to
prescribe further construction since
changing conditions may create
changing needs. They did not make
precise recommendations, as further
research will be required to lind
out how many people the i-estau

PROBABLE LOCATION
The new Union will probably be
constructed on Santa Teresa Street,
near the present Student Union. Its
growth will mean the razing of Oaks
Residence, and possibly of the Cor
poration Yard.
Buff walls, red tile roofs, and Ro
manesque arches were claimed by
last year's committee as the students'
choice, but final decision will depend
on current opinion and cost.
Funds for the memorial are being
collected from three sources —dona-
i tions in Dr. Tresidder's memory,
! profits from the present Union, and
money from a "dollar per student
per quarter" plan. Under this plan,
the ASSU, through petition to the
University, is granted a 'dollar from
each student's tuition. The plan was
used formerly for the building of
' Memorial Hall. When the hall was
j paid for, proceeds were switched to

By the end of spring quarter, the

should be constructed. Plans for a

Planning for the Tresidder Union will swing into a new phase
tomorrow night when Excom appoints a chairman for the Union
Planning Committee.
Last year it was decided to erect a long-planned new student
union as a memorial to Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, University presi-

dent who died early in 1948. To
plan and coordinate, the ASSU |
Union Planning Committee was j
created. This little-known com- I
mittee's job was to discover student j
opinion on the subject and to make j
plans, subject to approval by a
student-faculty committee.
Last year's committee expired at
the end of the school year. Tomor
row night Excom members will sug
gest names, and Excom will appoint
a new chairman. Within a week
the chairman will hold interviews to
choose six or eight members for his
committee. Part of their job will be
to chat with other students, to find
out just how the students want the
memorial built. In a joint student
faculty committee, the chairman, to
gether with Hank Rosin, ASSU
president, will work on final ap
proval of student plans.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
Last year Ted Norton headed the
band of workers. "His committee
burrowed into the maze of sugges
tions, plans, and illusions which had
grown up around the idea of a
Tresidder Memorial, and came up
with a usable yardstick, "first things
first."
"Constructing a unit at a time,"
said Norton in his report to the
ASSU, "seems to us the best way
to have 'first things first'." Norton's
committee determined what facilities
would be needed in a new student
union, and then proposed the fol
lowing order of construction:
1. A unit including a restaurant
(to take the place of the Cellar) and
a ballroom.
2. Second unit, an office building
for student government.
3. Third unit, a social and recrea
tional building.
The committee did not attempt to
prescribe further construction since
changing conditions may create
changing needs. They did not make
precise recommendations, as further
research will be required to lind
out how many people the i-estau
-1 rant should hold, etc.
