In Which the I'ipemaii Proposes a Name
For the Farm's 1949 Big Bed Machine
Stanford had better take warning .... the PCC football race is on in
full fashion and it looks to be a tough un. Thus far the Cards have
but marked time in regard to the Conference and their ultimate goal—
the Hose Bowl.
Oh, it's no secret that the Indians feel that the time is Now. In fact,
some of us have stuck that name to Marchie's lads—the Now Boys. We'vt
had the Vow Boys, the Wow Boys, the Woe Boys, and now .... 7
1 submit the title "Now Boys" for several reasons. Stanford is on the
road back, or so we like to believe. Three seasons have passed and we
have gone nowhere so now is the time to start.
Already this year we have played three games, All were fine contests
but after all, it is the Conference championship that we are after.
So we are over the hump, the warm-up time is over Now we start
in earnest. Now we start playing real football.
See how it fits in ... . the term "now," I mean. All our efforts of the
past three years have been .shaped to this time. The makings are there
for a good team. I fear that next year will be too late. Too many men
will be lost from this year's team. So "the time is now, the time to read
the writing on the wall," as the song goes.
I rest my case. What do you, the jury, say?
* rain*l Fair
I wonder just how many people know the story behind the "abatement"
of Big Jim Reynolds last December. By his own admission, "Stanford
is the biggest thing ever to come into my life." Jim works for greater
Stanford athletic teams. He works hard.
But the PCC moguls saw fit to "abate" Jim. The term abate, as used
by the PCC, means Jim is to see no more prospective Stanford athletes.
He Is not to talk to them, call them, or have any contact with them.
Mr. Reynolds' abatement came out of a hazy Conference ruling that
says an alumnus can be given the cease and desist order if his contacts
with athletes is, "persistent, repeated, or offensive." I wonder who worded
that particular passage.
It can be assumed that you or I would be subject to abatement if,
upon graduation, we talked twice to an athelete who would like to go to
Stanford. The second time would be a "repeated" contact.
It is no secret that Jim is largely responsible for many of Stanford's
athletes being Stanford, and not USC or Oregon, athletes.
But the strange part of the story is that Jim rarely met a boy outside
his Los Angeles office. Reynolds is known as "Mr. Stanford" by the high
school athletes of the Southland. They know that Stanford is a school
up north; they would like to go to Stanford. But how do we go about it,
they ask. So they go to see Big Jim and, in the past, he has given them
the needed information.
There is more to the tale. Big Jim is on the campus now, and he told
me that, though he has no figures to back him up, he has interviewed
more girls than boys on the prospect of entering Stanford.
But that is all over now. Stanford is subject to fines if Jim Reynolds
continues this extra-curricular activity. Some lawyers, presumably more
than a few of them Stanford law grads, have told Reynolds they would
like to make a test case out of the ruling. They talk of "suppressment of
free speech, etc." But Jim will have none of it. He is abated and it looks
as if he will remain so, unjust though the ruling maye be.
A Vole for the Fireman
My nomination for the American League's Most Valuable Player award
goes to Joe Page of the Yanks. The Bosox' Ted Williams has a large
iollowing. Ted leads the league in just about every department and should
rate serious consideration.
But it was Joe Page who brought the Yanks through. He participated
in GO games and saved 42 of them. He managed to compile a 13 and 8
record while so doing. He never started a game.
And when it is all said and done, it was the J Yanks who won the
pennant. Without Page they wouldn't have done so. That makes him
rather valuable, doesn't it?
