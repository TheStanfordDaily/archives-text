# Bruins Rated High for Saturday Came; New Coach, New System Give New Life
## Tailback Johnson Fills Featured Slot' In Coach Sanders' Single Wine Attack 
### 
There's no breather in store for
Marchie Schwartz's Michigan
mauled Indian gridders this week
end.
The Red Sanders-coached UCLA
outfit they'll be facing in the Sta
dium Saturday will be a far cry
from the truly great Wolverine team
that performed on the Farm last
week. But the southerners have a
good team, no mistake about it; and
they'll be carrying the finest offen
sive record on the coast when they
prance proudly onto the Stanford
turf Saturday afternoon.
And proud the Westwooders have
a right to be. Playing their first
year under their new coach and new
single wing attack, they've out lasted
Oregon State, lowa, and Oregon on
successive weekends, averaging 37
points per battle while so doing.
That's better than any other coast
team has done to date and places the
Bruins right in the middle of Rose
Bowl discussions. The southerners
are not too likely to get that call
to Pasadena themselves, but they'll
doubtlessly provide nvtny a rough
afternoon for the squads with more
definite aspirations toward the
Roses.
One scribe, the famed Deke Houl
gate, has even rated the Bruins the
top team in the country on the basis
of their first few showings. And
while most of the so-called experts
do not concur with Houlgate's view,
nobody denies that UCLA is mighty
dangerous this year.
CONVERSION
Sanders' attack depends mainly
upon the performance of his tail
back, Ernie Johnson, a converted

T-formation quarterback who has
adapted himself gleefully to his new
job. The single wing as used by
Coach Red calls for a triple-threater
in the tailback, slot, and that's just
what Johnson has proven himself
to be. The 173-pound halfback has
been shining particularly in the
aerial department this year, al
though the summer addition of 13
muscular pounds has also increased
his potency as a ball-toter.
Sanders' success with essentially
the same material tlu.it Bert La√üru
cherie handled with such marked
failure in 1948 would seem to indi
cate that last year's dismal collapse
at Westwood was due almost en
tirely to the internal dissension
which plagued the squad all season.
Henry R. "Red" Sanders made
quite an impression in the South
during his stay at Vanderbilt, where
he turned out consistently good
teams with consistently inferior ma
terial. And he's well on his way
now, it might be added, to endear
ing himself as well to the fans of
Southern California.
25 RETURN
Seventeen veteran linemen and
eight letter-winning backs form the
nucleus of Sanders' first PCC en
deavor. Three of these veterans are
currently leading the squad statis
tically: Johnson in passing with 180
yards credited to his tossing; wing
back Howard Hansen and Johnson
in in the running department with
better than 400 yards gained be
tween them; and end Bob Wilkin
son, who has been on the receiving
end of about 200 yards' worth of
