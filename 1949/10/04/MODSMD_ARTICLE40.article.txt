passes and has scored four touch
downs to tie with Johnson as top
pointmaker of the squad.
As a team, the Bruins in their first
three games rolled up slightly more
than 1,000 yards via both ground
and airlane routes. They were par
ticularly potent on the ground
against Oregon last Friday night,
amassing 310 yards while the Web
feet had to be content with a mere
38.
This would seem to indicate a
staunch Westwood defense as well
as offensive strength, but it should
be noted that Oregon outdistanced
the Bruins 13G yards to 80 in the
air.
Also of interest is the fact that
UCLA's opponents have averaged 22
points per game, another defensive
black mark against the Bruins.
In short, considering the fact that
Stanford is also a team much longer
on offense than defense, it looks like
a touchdown carnival coming up at
the Stadium Saturday .
