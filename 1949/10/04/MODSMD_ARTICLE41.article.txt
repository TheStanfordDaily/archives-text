# Card Sick Bay List Small
## 
### 
Tho usual Monday practice blues
were somewhat dispelled yesterday,
but the Card football team still had
some worries. Chief among these
was the announcement that tackle
A 1 Rau would probably be sidelined
for Saturday's UCLA game. Rau is
out with broken ribs.
Another tackle, Wes Poulson, is

also on the injured fist but he is
expected to be ready for duty. He
has a shoulder injury. Other than
Rau the team came out of the
Michigan game in pretty good shape.
Halfbacks Bob White and Holy
Boruck were not suited up for yes
terday's practice but will go Satur
day.
