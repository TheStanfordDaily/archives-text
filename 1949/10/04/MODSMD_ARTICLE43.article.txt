# Bay Region Artists Exhibit Abstractions at Art Gallery
## 
### 
A collection of works by out
standing Bay Region artists is now
; being exhibited at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
This exhibit was featured at the
San Francisco Museum of Art dur
ing the summer. Pictures were se
lected on an invitational basis.
The majority of the pictures are
of an abstract nature, but such art
' ists as Baumann have lent a real
istic touch to the exhibit. A small
painting, 'Mental Aquarium," by
Dr. Bothwell is of special interest
! because of its beautiful design.
Other works included arc those by
! Claire Frankenstien; Fran Spencer,

a young San Francisco painter;
George Harris, a former director of
the Stanford Art Gallery; and Gene
Vargar, who combines painting with
cut-out paper work.
Small pastels of California mis
sions, owned by Stanford, are of
historical value, because they show
the condition of the missions in the
late 1860's.
The exhibition closes October 16.
The gallery is open eveiy day but
Monday.
