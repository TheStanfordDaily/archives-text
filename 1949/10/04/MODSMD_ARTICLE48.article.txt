â–º Highway patrol officers took an j
[ appreciative view of the normal
of highway traffic yesterday after
150,000 sports - minded motorists
caused what Peninsula area police
termed the "worst traffic jam in
history" Saturday and Sunday.
The Stanford - Michigan football
game brought 85,000 persons onto
the highways. Other events drawing |
large crowds were the races at Bay
Meadows, 20,000, and the Centen
nial gold rush parade in San Mateo
; and Burlingame, 45,000.
Cars on Bayshore and El Camino
j were bumper to bumper by noon, J
: police said. All roads leading to |
! Stanford were choked with cars by
| 1 p.m.
The jam began again late in the
| afternoon when the crowds began
i to return home. It was after 9 p.m.
j before traffic let up to "normally
j heavy," the highway patrol re
! ported.
Movement of the estimated 23,000
cars to and from the game was de
scribed as "satisfactory" by Police
Chief Gordon Davis, the jam being
more on the highways than on the
campus.
Stanford students helped consid
erably by walking to and from the
j game, Chief Davis said.
