# Navy-Air Quarrel

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Documents se
cretly slipped to newsmen today
pictured U.S. Navy morale as shot
to pieces and the nation's security
imperiled under the present unified
defense setup.
The documents, signed with the
names of high naval officers, were
handed to reporters by a naval
source in a shadowy corridor of a
downtown oflice building.
The release was the latest incident
in a long tug-of-war between the
Navy and the Air Force for Con
gressional appropriations and the
right to carry out strategic air as
signments.
