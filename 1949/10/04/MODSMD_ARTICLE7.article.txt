PITTSBURGH â€” Bloody violence
erupted anew in the strike-scarred
coal fields today as the nation's first
doubleheader steel - coal walkout
pinched America's economy a little
harder.
Gunfire pinpointed a clash be
tween Tennessee's union and non
union miners with at least three
hurt and two others missing. This
came at the same time as 102,000 of
John L. Lewis' men streamed hack
to the pits, the one bright spot on
the strike scene.
