# STANFORD BANDWAGON
## Musicians Prep for UCLA; Aim at Washington Trip 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The arrow backfired—the arrow that lost its head in the giant
"M" which the Stanford Band formed in the half-time maneuvers
Saturday afternoon. Although the bandsmen saw their prophecy
fall short in the second half of the Michigan game Saturday, the
air is full of confidence and musical notes this week as the new

| Stanford Band prepares for the
opener against the Bruins.
Baton - wielding Coach Julius
Shuchat and his well - valve - oiled
machine will take the field along
with a Band of Bruins which always
j puts on a good show during the
| half-time festivities.
While the Bruin Band makes like
Benny Goodman, the local musi
cians will use their own variation of
the Notre Dame box, eight files and
eleven rows deep, as a basis for the
running formations.
However ludicrous the parallel
between band and team might he,
| the fact remains that Stanford's
music - makers have established
I themselves as a core in the ncbu
! lous term, "The Stanford Spirit."
Upperclassmcn still remember the
' USC game in the Coliseum two
i years ago in which the band and a
handful of rooters backed the team
| while the gridders threw a 14-0
scare at the Trojans. The crimson
! and gold fielded their usual circus
j band with flags, glee club, and port
j able kettle drums.
TOP PERFORMANCE
The Stanford horn - blowers in
■ faded red uniforms took the field at
! half-time and gave the Los Angeles
j press something to talk about. One
of the top dance drummers called
the Indian drum section the best he
had ever heard. Larry Kain, sec
ond-string bass drummer that year,
was so enthusiastic he put a hole
| through the drumhead during one
! Stanford goal-line stand.
The appearance that year was
only one of many in which coaches,
yell leaders, and students agreed
that the Farm band set the cadence
j for the amazing "Stanford Spirit."
Bay Area scribes have been un
impressed. Last year, Will Connolly
said both the Indian football team
| and band would be outplayed when
the Trojans came north ,for the
' game.
EIGHT TO SIX
The Stanford Band outweighed
and outplayed the Trojan outfit
eight basses to six, while the team
missed a 7-7 tie by one conversion.
Mr. Connolly still hasn't appeared at
i band practice.
Last week Jack McDonald of the
Call-Bulletin extolled the virtues of
i the Michigan band which is recog
nized, along with the team, as one
of I he best in the nation. The Mich
igan band, he said, "can march at
the tempo of 152 cadences a minute
| when it reaches its midseason peak."
I The Indian drummers have been
| beating off a 180 cadence since the
1 first game this season. After the

| game the snare specialists some
j times hit 200. The drum beats roll
| off the "skin" in the form of six
! street beats, most of which the
drummers drummed up in their
j own heads.
MUSIC SITUATION
McDonald's account goes on to say
the 150-piece Michigan band has a
head librarian and five assistants to
handle the $30,000 worth of music.
The Indian band owns $200 worth of
worn-out music which is handled
by one part-time student musician.
The Call - Bulletin sports scribe
writes, "The Michigan Band does
not even award scholarships (some
Midwest bands do). But a bands
man is given a watch chain the first
! year, a sweater the sophomore sea
son, a Block M for the sweater the
third year, and a monogrammed
blanket the senior year. All this and
three academic units, too."
The Stanford Band gets one unit
of credit with a possibility of going
I minus if the attendance record at
j practice is poor, a pair of sore feet
! from 10 hours of marching each
week, and the joy of outblowing all
the other bands on the Coast (bar
ring the SC band which often uses
i a loudspeaker).
HANI) REBUILT
Sincc the war the Stanford Band
, has been busy with a mass rebuild
ing job. The ground foundation was
laid two years ago when the Ath
letic Department, dug down in the
e'osely guarded coffers to finance
100 new uniforms for the bandsmen.
From then on the construction job
was in the hands of the band mana
gers, Bill Warren, Eel Cramer, and
this year Norm Hamilton. Working
| with an allowance from the Music
Department which buys a limited
supply of music and helps pay for
instrument repairs, the fugitives
from the hovel (known as a band
house) have scraped the campus for
I recruits.
The SAC continues to send the
band to Los Angeles for one game
: each year. The result—a big boost
for the footballers. This year, after
three years of the rebuilding, the
band is on the threshold of a big
i name nationally and a trip to the
Washington game.
Perhaps a library of $30,000 worth
of music, a band of 150 pieces, and
a reputation equaling that which
the drum section already possesses
i is just around the corner for the
: new Stanford aßnd.


STANFORD'S SPIRITED BAND shows its stuff during half-time
activities at the Michigan game. The musicians will accompany
the Cardinal gridders to the USC game this year and hope to

make the trip to Washington October 15. Band members, work
ing on a shoestring and gifts, have reinstated their war-battered
organization into a first-class unit.
