# SERIES TALK
## Brandt Tells Of German Rebuilding 
### 
With a concise and informative
report on "What Is Going On in
Germany Today," Dr. Karl Brandt,
professor of agricultural economics
in the Food Research Institute,
opened this season's Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night in Memorial
Auditorium.
"Nowhere else in Europe have I
seen people working under similar
political, economic, and social han
dicaps with so much determination,
self-discipline, and natural devotion
to the job of digging themselves out
of the ruins and rebuilding their
cities and industries as I did in
Western Germany," Dr. Brandt re
ported.
Having just returned from a one
year stay in Europe, Dr. Brandt
bui't his talk around an analysis of
the psychological viewpoint of the
modern-day, post-war German of
the Western zone of occupation.
FAVOR OCCUPATION
"With many different German
audiences I have tested the people s
attitude toward the occupation
forces by asking whether they want
them to be withdrawn.
"In each instance I have received
a determined 'No' in reply. The
Germans want the occupation forces
to stay because they are the only
token of protection against a Soviet
aggression."
"(In the Soviet-controlled areas)
there is neither freedom of speech,
of teaching, nor of the press and as
semb'y. The Germans there live in
a Soviet colony virtually in slavery.
FEW ARE COMMUNIST
"At heart, very few of them are
Communist; all of them, including
the Communists, long to be free, and
every week from one to three thou
sand of them clandestinely migrate
westward under the Iron Curtain."
Discussing the present economic
situation, a topic concerning which
he is particularly qualified, Dr.
Brandt reported:
"As soon as they (the Western
Germans) got some freedom to
shape their domestic economic pol
icy, they chose to restore a free
market economy.
"They decided not to socialize in
dustries, reaffirmed private property
and private initiative as the basic
institutions of their economy, and
at the same time acknowledged the
social obligation of entrepreneurs
and workers to the common good."
GERMANY VS. ENGLAND
Dr. Brandt compared the new
German economic policy to the con
flicting socialist ideology of the Brit
ish, one of the occupying powers.
He brought out the German claim
that "the Western powers, particu
larly Great Britain, but also France,
are using the security commission
and the pretext of military security
for the sake of restraining German
competition in the world market."
In commenting on the above, he
said:
"It is obvious that the relations
between Germany and the West are
being poisoned if there is any truth
in this claim."
Summing up, Dr. Brandt said that
the U.S. - financed program of re
constructing a democratic German
society "has been remarkably suc
cessful so far."
"I see no reason why it should
not ultimately succeed provided the
remnants of punitive policies arc re
moved, and that the West State is
admitted into membership in the
community of Western nations," he
concluded.

situation, a topic concerning which
he is particularly qualified, Dr.
Brandt reported:
"As soon as they (the Western
Germans) got some freedom to
shape their domestic economic pol
icy, they chose to restore a free
market economy.
"They decided not to socialize in
dustries, reaffirmed private property
and private initiative as the basic
institutions of their economy, and
at the same time acknowledged the
social obligation of entrepreneurs
and workers to the common good."
GERMANY VS. ENGLAND
Dr. Brandt compared the new
German economic policy to the con
flicting socialist ideology of the Brit
ish, one of the occupying powers.
He brought out the German claim
that "the Western powers, particu
larly Great Britain, but also France,
are using the security commission
and the pretext of military security
for the sake of restraining German
competition in the world market."
In commenting on the above, he
said:
"It is obvious that the relations
between Germany and the West are
being poisoned if there is any truth
in this claim."
Summing up, Dr. Brandt said that
the U.S. - financed program of re
constructing a democratic German
society "has been remarkably suc
cessful so far."
"I see no reason why it should
not ultimately succeed provided the
remnants of punitive policies arc re
moved, and that the West State is
admitted into membership in the
community of Western nations," he
concluded.
With a concise and informative
report on "What Is Going On in
Germany Today," Dr. Karl Brandt,
professor of agricultural economics
in the Food Research Institute,
opened this season's Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night in Memorial
Auditorium.
"Nowhere else in Europe have I
seen people working under similar
political, economic, and social han
dicaps with so much determination,
self-discipline, and natural devotion
to the job of digging themselves out
of the ruins and rebuilding their
cities and industries as I did in
Western Germany," Dr. Brandt re
ported.
Having just returned from a one
year stay in Europe, Dr. Brandt
bui't his talk around an analysis of
the psychological viewpoint of the
modern-day, post-war German of
the Western zone of occupation.
FAVOR OCCUPATION
"With many different German
audiences I have tested the people s
attitude toward the occupation
forces by asking whether they want
them to be withdrawn.
"In each instance I have received
a determined 'No' in reply. The
Germans want the occupation forces
to stay because they are the only
token of protection against a Soviet
aggression."
"(In the Soviet-controlled areas)
there is neither freedom of speech,
of teaching, nor of the press and as
semb'y. The Germans there live in
a Soviet colony virtually in slavery.
FEW ARE COMMUNIST
"At heart, very few of them are
Communist; all of them, including
the Communists, long to be free, and
every week from one to three thou
sand of them clandestinely migrate
westward under the Iron Curtain."

situation, a topic concerning which
he is particularly qualified, Dr.
