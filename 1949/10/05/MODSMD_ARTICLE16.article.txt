# Employment Com Solves Student Labor Problems
## 
### 
Though labor-management quar-
J rels have been highlighting the na
| tional news, there's no feudin' and
1 fussin' on the Farm labor scene.
Here students work with Univer
j sity officials to solve difficulties that
may arise between employers and
| student employees. The group which
helps conduct this work is the Stu
i dent-University Employment Com
i mittee, now in its second year of cx
j istence.
This standing committee consists
of four students appointed by the
ASSU president with the approval
lof Excom. One of the represents
! tives in the group must be a mem
; ber of Excom, and two must have
I been employed by the University
j part-time for at least two quarters
! prior to their appointment.
The committee, working in con

junction with the Stanford Employ
ment Office, makes recommenda
tions to Excom and the University
about matters such as wages, hours,
working conditions, and the hiring
and firing of students.
In disputes between students and
employers, the group acts as a fact
finding and mediating board, and
suggests action to be taken.
Appeals for or against proposed
student business enterprises are also
brought before this special commit
tee, as well as policy matters con
cerning campus representatives for
private firms.
Members of this year's Employ
ment Committee will be announced
at the Excom meeting tonight. Any
students interested in working with
this group should contact their Ex
com representative immediately.
