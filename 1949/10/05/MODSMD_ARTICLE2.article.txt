# Czechs Denounce Tito
## 
### 
PRAGUE—Czechoslovakia chimed
in with the Cominform chorus to
day and denounced her alliance and
friendship treaty with Yugoslavia.
Charging that Marshal Tito had
deserted the "Soviet-led camp of
peace" and gone over to the legions
of the "imperialists," Czechoslovakia
also scrapped her cultural pact with
the stiff-backed Yugoslav Commu
nists and demanded the recall of
their ambassador.
For good measure, she joined an
other Russian - led Cominform
movement—recognition of the Chi
nese Communist government at Pei
ping and severance of relations with
the Chinese Nationalists at Canton.
