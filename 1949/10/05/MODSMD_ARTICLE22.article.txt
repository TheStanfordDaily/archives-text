# Farm Students In Auto Accident
## 
### 
Two Stanford students received
minor injuries in an automobile ac
cident on Portola Road Monday
night about midnight.
Maner Thorpe, 19, and Thomas H.
Wieder, 24, received cuts and
bruises when their 1931 Ford road
ster went out of control while
rounding a curve. The automobile
dragged the fence for about 50 feet
and finally smashed into a post. Po
lice believe brake failure was the
cause of the accident.
Both students were taken to the
Palo Alto Hospital, where they were
treated and released.
