# Rain Threatens First Series Game
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 4 (/P) —Threat
of rain cast a gray shadow tonight
over the golden World Series open
ing tomorrow between the New
York Yankees and the Brooklyn
Dodgers.
But the forecast of scattered
showers failed to lower the enthu
siasm of the vast multitude of rau
cous Dodger adherents, of haughty
Yankee supporters, and of out-of
town baseball fans of all stripes of
opinion.
Yankee Stadium, sile of games
one, two, six, and seven of the base
ball classic, can accommodate 70,000
fans but it was all sold out except
for the usual bleacher seats which
are a cinch to sell like hot cakes
when the gates open at 9 a.m. to
morrow.
The first-day crowd may set a
new record for receipts. The sta
dium mark is $327,659.70, made in
the 1947 series with Brooklyn. Since
then prices have been boosted from
$6 to $8 for boxes and $4.40 to . .<•
for reserved scats. This may bring
the receipts over the lush $.'578,785.7;i
hit in the larger Cleveland stadium

last year. There were black market
offers as high as $50 for a single
place in a box costing originally $8.
High strategy went on in secret
meetings of the rival teams. White
haired Burt Shotton. who manages
the National League Dodgers, said
he would not reveal his starting'
pitcher until tomorrow. Everyone
guessed it would be Don Newcombe,
giant strong-arm Negro with a rec
ord of 17 victories and eight defeats,
or the anemic but highly effective
Elwin (Preacher) Roe, 15-6.
Gray-haired Casey Stengey of the
American League Yankees came
right out and said it would be Allie
Reynolds, a 17-6 acc.
Carl Furillo, Brooklyn outfielder
who whopped it up at bat in the
pennant stretch drive, said he could
not play "unless the doctor performs
a miracle." His groin was painfully
injured in the season's last game
Sunday.
Manager Shotton said Furillo
would play "and let's have no argu
ment about it."
That's the way things go on the
eve of a World Series.
