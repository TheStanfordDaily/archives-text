# About Those Ride Signs
## 
### 
Now that the ASSU Executive Committee
has outlawed the use of campaign signs or
posters of any size, shape, or description dur
ing student elections, it concerns us as to just
who is going to replace the Palo Alto and
Village ride signs when the present ones dis
integrate as they inevitably must.
We're speaking of the two somewhat dilapi
dated signs that guard the entrance to Palm
Drive and by which wheel-less Village and
off-campus students traditionally stand if they
want a ride home.
For the past two years the signs have "tra
ditionally" been replaced by public-spirited
candidates for public office, eager to cash in
on a large and appreciate off-campus and Vil
lage vote at election time.
The signs have been plastered with the
name and expectant position of the hopeful

candidates to be sure, but the words "Village" '
and "Palo Alto" have been discernible at least.
But now that such electioneering methods
are improper and present ride signs are 1
wearing out, what next? We went through
this same situation two years ago. The files of
The Daily are full of letters lo the editor on ;
the subject, but still the University took no
action. We think that it should.
Sharing rides with those who do not have
cars is one of the Farm's finest traditions. The j
University should encourage it in every way
possible and this includes the erection of some ;
permanent ride station signs, made of sturdier j
stuff and large enough to be visible as the ;
motorist turns into Palm Drive.
The cost of such a project would be low, j
and the appearance of a large, official looking '
sign would stop many more motorists than
those campaign budget ones do now.
