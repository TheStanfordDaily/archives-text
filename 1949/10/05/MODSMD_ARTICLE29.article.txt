# BULL SESSION

### JOHN BOONAR 
"God, I'm ruined, all washed up, my whole career
has been nipped in the bud."
"What's wrong?" I was speaking to my roommate,
Bob Tangent.
"I tell you, I'm lost."
"You must be fooling. How could you, a boy genius
leading your class in engineering, be lost? You were
the wonder in your home town. You astounded all
the leading scientists. Everyone honored you, even
Pepsi-Cola."
"When I think of all that work gone, gone to
nothing."
"For God's sake, tell me what is your trouble.
You and I are old buddies. Didn't we rough it to
gether at Encina?"
"Well, it seems that the administration is going to
add another requirement for an engineering degree."
"What difference can one extra requirement make
to a mind like yours?"
"They are going to require a knowledge of read
ing and writing."
"The dogs, this will undermine the entire engi
neering setup in America. But how is it that you,
the boy-wizard, have never learned to read and
write?"
"It all started back in grammar school. I was so

good at math problems that my teachers encouraged
me. 1 used to make out the income tax returns for
the faculty, so I had what I wanted. 1 didn t like
reading and writing, so 1 didn't learn them."
"You were able to keep up a hoax like that for all
these years?"
"It was easy. Whenever anyone asked me a ques
tion, I gave an answer in alegbra or drew them a
graph. People don't like to admit that they are
ignorant, so I got by."
"This is a problem."
"Maybe you can teach me. You can read and
write."
"It's nothing, really."
"There are only 2G letters in the alphabet." he said.
"You're making progress already."
"We could yive each letter a number. Then I
could figure maybe some equation forms in reading
and writing."
"Maybe your fears are unfounded. It could be
that some English major was just trying to. throw a
scare into you."
"Oh well, if worst comes to worst and I get thrown
out of college, I can always get a job teaching in some
place like Cal Tech or M.1.T."
