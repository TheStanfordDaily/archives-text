WASHINGTON â€” Two investiga
tions were launched swiftly today
in the aftermath of Navy officers'
charges that naval morale is shat
tered and the national security
weakened under the unified defense
setup.
The House Armed Services Com
mittee scheduled a hearing for Navy
officers who feel that the Air Force
is being given too much priority and
that sea power and its own air arm
are dangerously slighted.

Denficld, chief of naval operations,
announced an investigation to de

correspondence containing some of
the charges happened to be made
public last night.
