# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
Regarding Friday's article on Stanford students in
Europe, 1 would like to make a few comments if per
mitted. A village with one building left standing,
Herman Iter warden or no, is hardly the place for
a flip comment on cheap beer. I might say the
author has missed the significance of this, to me at
any rate, rather tragic description.
The second comment is about the supposed anxiety
of Europeans to make a nickel here, "a dollar there."
Such a generalization is completely false and com
pletely unnecessary. For anyone who was in Europe

this summer, the beauty of its art, the sensitivity and
maturity of its students, the simplicity and way of
life of many of its peoples, the fascination and charm
of its cities—these are the things which should be
written about.
I'm sure we all had funny experiences—the lan
guage difficulty alone gives you prompt assurance
of that! But I consider Friday's article in rather
bad taste. Give us another article on students in
Europe which shows a little insight into what Europe
really is and stands for, and what American students
can learn from her.
