## 
### 
Disorganized singing and other
late hour disturbances by Stanford
students must bo curtailed, Police
Chiuf Gordon Davis said yesterday.
The warning was issued to new
students who may not be familiar
with life on the campus, and also to
old students who have become lax
in their observance of rules of quiet.
Chief Davis reminded students
that the Stanford campus is much
like ;i city, many persons other
than students having their homes
hero. Students should not make any
disturbance that they would not
make ;it home, he said.
Organized serenading is permis
sible, Chief Davis advised, if it is
orderly and completed before nor
mal hours of quiet.
Recently there have been several
instances of groups of students sere
nading campus residences as late as
11 or 12 p.m. Chief Davis warned
that these occasions have been vio
lations of University rules.
Students are also warned of traf
fic conditions on Palm Drive. Many
hitchhikers have been walking
down the drive to thumb rides.
The campus tradition, Chief Davis
.said, has been to wait at the "Y" for
rides to Palo Alto or the Village.
Those who desire to walk should
use the pathways on either side of
the road.
Bicyclists are cautioned about rid
ing down Palm Drive. An accident
resulting in the near death of a
cyclist occurred this summer be
cause the rider was out in the road
at night and riding without lights.
Those wishing to ride bicycles
down Palm Drive should ride on the
pathways, and carry a flashlight and
have a reflector on their vehicle,
Chief Davis said.
