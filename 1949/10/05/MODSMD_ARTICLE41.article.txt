# Old Boy Counts Candles; Marks 50 Witty Years
## 
### 
By rights, the Old Boy should be 1
stroking a long, white beard. Today
marks his fiftieth birthday. On Oc
tober 5, 1899, the Stanford Chapar
ral was founded the fifth college
comic in the United States.
To celebrate the occasion, the old
one will bring out a flashy anniver
sary issue on October 20, "mit 24-
karat gold cover, solid."
The Chaparra! is the founder and
home oflice of the Hammer and
Coffin Society, college humor fra
ternity which now stretches across
the country. Too, Chappie is the
oldest Stanford publication still in
existence.
Among its past members Chappie
claims Fog Murray, artist-author of
"Seein' Stars"; Jack Shoup, Stan
ford alumni director; Will Irwin,
originator of the Axe Yell; Bruce
Bliven, an editor of the "New Re
public"; and "Doodles" Weaver,
movie and radio personality. Editor
of the first Chaparral was Bristow
Adams, now dean emeritus of the
Cornell School of English.
The Old Boy put out his first year
of pamphlets on $500. Now, says
newest' Old Boy John Motheral,
Chappie operates on a yearly budget
of $19,000.
