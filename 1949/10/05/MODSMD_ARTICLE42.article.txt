## The
						Front Row Baseball Fans Will Be Listening Today, Yankees 9-5 Favorites Over Dodgers 
### 
They had better call off all the 10 and 11 o'clock classes this morning
because most of the red-blooded populace will be relying on their radios,
not their profs, to bring them the word as Old Case Stengel sends bis
gamest, fightingest Yanks out to battle the Cinderella Dodgers in the
opener of the 1949 World Series.
This latest Episode in baseball's great moment promises to offer almost
as many thrills as the rest of the Series combined.
Because both the clubs are sentimental public favorites, and both have
just gone through one of the most exciting double-barrelled pennant
races in recent history.
Right now, the Yanks are being rated as 9-5 bookmaker favorites, but
nobody seems to know why. It could be that they knocked off the best
team of the three in the last two days of the season.
Anyway, KFRC, the .Mutual Broadcasting Station, will carry the play
by-play, and il should be worth tuning in.
Kill Coruiii (lioosos Bums
Most of the "noted" critics are sticking with the American League to
continue it usual winning ways, but there are enough wise prophets,
such as Bill Corum (the razor-blade man), choosing the Bums, to keep
it legal.
Both managers, Old Burt of Brooklyn and Old Case oi New York, have
been playing it coy with regard to naming their-starting moundsman, but
it would seem that Big Allie Reynolds will go for the Bombers, with Don
Newcombe tossing the ball for the Dodgers.
The Yanks' -happiness, if any, will be a thing called Joe. Correct that.
It should be two Joes. . . v
The first, DiMaggio, is almost a religion around San Franoiaco. Healthy
or no, DiMag will be the most glamorous (inure in the Series. And he
easily could be the most destructive to Flatbush hopes.
But it's the second Joe, Page, the red-hot reliefer, who will be the most
important Yankee. Page went to the mound 60 times this season. He
had to. Stengel's pitchers aren't built to last. But with Page around to
finish up, they've looked pretty good.
Because of Page and DiMaggio and Stengel and Bobby Brown (the local
representatives) and John Lindeil and Tom Henrich, the Front Row sees
the Yanks grabbing their 12th World Championship, 4 games to 2.

Hang Up Mike
1 see by the Chronicle Green that Don Liebendorfer is going to hang
up his mike next Saturday and turn over his public address chores to
Sportscaster Fred YVeingarth.
Liebendorfer, Stanford's publicity head and assistant Athletic Director,
gave up the post so that he could play full-time host in the Stadium press
box, a move which will help in making it a better press box. However, his
familiar voice will be missed next week, as Liebendorfer has been doing
a thorough and entertaining job for a long time now.

Items for the things to come in basketball department: Bill Stevenson,
the rangy center from Lowell High, is enrolled in school. And close by,
over at Menlo JC, all-time prep great Kenny Flower is attending classes
with George Yardley's little 6-foot, 2-inch brother, Bob. Both plan to
hit Stanford when their books catch up to their basketball abilities.
