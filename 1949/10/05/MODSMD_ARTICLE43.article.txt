## History of 19-Game Card-UCLA Series Reveals Number of Stunning Upsets 
### EARL ODELL 
Yards and yards of grid grass
have been trampled since Pop War
ner's mighty eleven rolled over
UCLA one afternoon in 1925 to the
catchy little tune of 82 to 0 in the
opening contest between the two
schools.
Those were the days when the
Cardmen took a breather whenever
they played the Bruins. They even
gave the water boy a chance to show
his stuff.
In '28 the "Injuns" had little
trouble in getting by 45 to 7, and in
'29 and '30 they didn't even let the
Uclans score, leaving them with
scores of 57 to 0 and 20 to 0 respec
tively.
7-fi UPSET IN '.'{s
But, never underestimate the
powers of the Southland boys. In
1935, when the Vow Boys were mel
lowed seniors and were tabbed by
one and all to take over the Rose
Bowl chores for the third successive
year, they got the shock of their
lives, for Bill Spaulding brought his
oft - defeated Bruins to the Farm
with other ideas, and they took
home a 7 to 6 upset.
The Stanford - UCLA game has
been a surpriser more than once,
though. Take '39, f'r instance, when
the Rose-bound Uclans were stop
ped in their tracks by Albert,
Standlee and Co. under Tiny Thorn
hill. That game ended in a 14-14 tie
and caused the Bruins a lot of lost
sleep.
An example of what carelessness
can do is the '32 game, when the
Westgaters up and defeated a highly
touted Card eleven on the strength
of two blocked kicks, which set up

the touchdowns UCLA needed to
win 13 to 6.
ALBERT DAZZLES UCLA
In more recent pre - war days
Stanford had little trouble with the
Bruins, razzle-dazzling them with a
brand new Model T (a Shaugh
nessy make) with a fellow named
Albert at the wheel.
The year 1940 saw the T roll to
a 20 to 14 win, and in '41, with very
few scratches on the fenders, the big
red machine drove over the Uelans
33 to 0.
After 1941 the Indians weren't to
see the top of the scoreboard in a
UCLA game for a number of years.
The Bruins were grown up and
there was no dneying it.
POST-WAR BRUINS TOPS
When play resumed after a time
out for the Big War, the Uelans still
found themselves on top of the pile,
winning 26 to 6 in '46, and 39 to 6
in '47.
In 1948. however, the Indians
heaped their altar high with sacri
fices and prayers to the great foot
ball god and the Bruin Era passed.
The Cards came out on top, surpris
ing everyone but themselves, with
a 34 to 14 win.
The record now stands Stanford
12 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie in the
19-game series. This Saturday will
find the Indian altar piled high again
as the Stanford Era continues.

POST-WAR BRUINS TOPS
When play resumed after a time
out for the Big War, the Uelans still
found themselves on top of the pile,
winning 26 to 6 in '46, and 39 to 6
in '47.
In 1948. however, the Indians
heaped their altar high with sacri
fices and prayers to the great foot
ball god and the Bruin Era passed.
The Cards came out on top, surpris
ing everyone but themselves, with
a 34 to 14 win.
The record now stands Stanford
12 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie in the
19-game series. This Saturday will
find the Indian altar piled high again
as the Stanford Era continues.
Yards and yards of grid grass
have been trampled since Pop War
ner's mighty eleven rolled over
UCLA one afternoon in 1925 to the
catchy little tune of 82 to 0 in the
opening contest between the two
schools.
Those were the days when the
Cardmen took a breather whenever
they played the Bruins. They even
gave the water boy a chance to show
his stuff.
In '28 the "Injuns" had little
trouble in getting by 45 to 7, and in
'29 and '30 they didn't even let the
Uclans score, leaving them with
scores of 57 to 0 and 20 to 0 respec
tively.
7-fi UPSET IN '.'{s
But, never underestimate the
powers of the Southland boys. In
1935, when the Vow Boys were mel
lowed seniors and were tabbed by
one and all to take over the Rose
Bowl chores for the third successive
year, they got the shock of their
lives, for Bill Spaulding brought his
oft - defeated Bruins to the Farm
with other ideas, and they took
home a 7 to 6 upset.
The Stanford - UCLA game has
been a surpriser more than once,
though. Take '39, f'r instance, when
the Rose-bound Uclans were stop
ped in their tracks by Albert,
Standlee and Co. under Tiny Thorn
hill. That game ended in a 14-14 tie
and caused the Bruins a lot of lost
sleep.
An example of what carelessness
can do is the '32 game, when the
Westgaters up and defeated a highly
touted Card eleven on the strength
of two blocked kicks, which set up

the touchdowns UCLA needed to
win 13 to 6.
ALBERT DAZZLES UCLA
In more recent pre - war days
Stanford had little trouble with the
Bruins, razzle-dazzling them with a
brand new Model T (a Shaugh
nessy make) with a fellow named
Albert at the wheel.
The year 1940 saw the T roll to
a 20 to 14 win, and in '41, with very
few scratches on the fenders, the big
red machine drove over the Uelans
33 to 0.
After 1941 the Indians weren't to
see the top of the scoreboard in a
UCLA game for a number of years.
The Bruins were grown up and
there was no dneying it.
