# Shaw Has Cold, Misses Practice
## 
### 
Marchie Schwartz must have ta
ken a Jong look- at the passing sta
tistics for the Michigan game, be
cause last night he had his gridders
tossing the ball all over the lot.
Only thing wrong with the process
was that number one flinger Tom
Shaw was home in bed with a cold
instead of out on the firing line.
However, it's nothing serious, and
Shaw should be rid of the miseries
by this afternoon.
In his absence, Gary Kerkorian
and Dick Horn filled the gap with
a nice passing performance, espe
cially Kerkorian, who pumped die
ball out to receivers Rupe Andrews
and Bill McColl in fine form.
Whether the passing punch will
be enough to stop UCLA's three
time winners next Saturday remains

to be seen. But it looks like it will
be an all-out air battle, and the In
dians should be ready to cope with
it.
'I he injury list was yetting smaller
yesterday as Duve Field reported
back ior action. AI Rau was running
to keep in khape while his ribs arc*
on the mend, and Rupe Andrews
(with fingers taped) was
through the motions without pads.
Also back on the Held was Joe Ja
cobs, almost set to go alter a painful
thumb dislocation last week.
