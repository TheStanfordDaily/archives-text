northeast of here today after swat
tin:; at this Texas metropolis and
dealing a heavy blow a t coastal
crops. Farm losses were in the mil
lions.
The slap at this city of more than
500,000 was a surprisingly light one.
Damage to a bumper rice, cotton
and vcegtablc crop was the greatest
toll.
The hurricane first struck at the
rich industrial and agricultural
coastal area between Matagorda and
Free port. Then about 1:30 a.m.
(11:30 p.m. Monday, PST) it hit
Houston.
