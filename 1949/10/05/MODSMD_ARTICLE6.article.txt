PITTSBURGH — New violence
sputtered in the coal strike today as
contract talks resumed with no hint
of a quick end to cither the mine
or steel walkouts.
The tipple — coal preparation
structure—at the C. V. Fink and Son
mine near Clearfield, Pa., was dam
aged by an explosion. State police
found evidence a charge of dyna
mite caused the blast.
