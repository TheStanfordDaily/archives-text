# Cost May Rise For Commuters
## 
### 
Student monthly commuters' tick
ets will be increased by a maximum
of 6 per cent if the Southern Pacific
proposal is approved by the Public
Utilities Commission.
According to James J. McDon
ough, district passenger agent a*
Palo Alto, student commuter tickets
between Palo Alto and San Fran
eisco would therefore be increased
less than 60 cents per month.
The date for the hearing of the
proposal has not been announced
by the Public Utilities Commission.
The hearing will be held in San
Francisco.
Opposition to the proposed in
crease is being voiced by the Penin
sula .Protective Association. This
association argues that the increase
is unfair and that further raises
would be sought if the proposal is
approved.
Southern Pacific claims that ris
ing costs and the 40-hour week,
which is to start Sept. 1, necessitate
the increase.
