monstrous home run into the right
field seats at Yankee Stadium in the
ninth inning today to break up a
brilliant pitching duel between Al
lie Reynolds and Don Ncvvcombc
and give the New York Yankees ji
1 to 0 triumph over the Brooklyn
Dodgers in the opening game of the
World Series.
The first Yankee to face New
eombe, Brooklyn's great N< gro
right-hander, in the ninth was Hen
rich. He looked yt two balls and
then slammed the next pitch, a
waist-high fast ball, on a screaming
line into the lower deck over the
!J44-foot mark.
The pay-ofT blast was only the
fifth hit olf the rookie Neweombe.
who had struck out 11 of his
American League opponents in the
eight previous innings. Reynolds,
the winner, pitched one of the clas
sics of World Series history in
blanking the Dodgers with two
widely spaced hits, lie struck out

within two of the series record set
in the 1944 playoff between the two
St. Louis clubs, when Moi t Cooper
of the Cards whiffed 12 and Denny
Galehouse of the Browns 10.
Up to tiie time of Henrich s colos
sal blow, the Yankees had not
pushed a man past second against
the Brooklyn flame-thrower. Only
one Dodger saw third off Reynolds,
and that was the outgrowth of a pair
of walks to open the second in
ning.
Newcombe was ;it his hottest in
the early part of the struggle strik

the 151-year-old Oklahoma City star
of Indian extraction, took the oppo
site route. He wobbled in the early
going, and then, stinting in the sixth
inning, became a ball of fire.
In the last four chapters the Na
tional League champions put only
two men on base against the cool
variety of curves, sinkers, and fast
balls served lip by the .sturdy
Yankee.
