## 'Code' Exam Plan Tabled 
### 
A proposal to add an interpreta
tion to the Stanford Honor Code
regarding the taking of examinations
out of classrooms was considered by
Excom last night.
The change would mean that if
adequate seating was provided — in
other words, il alternate scats were
available—then students could not
leave the examination room with
out the permission of the instructor.
Donn Wells, chairman of the
Honor Code Standing Committee,
said that this interpretation had
been approved by the committee,
but that he felt the matter was of
such great importance that it should
be passed upon by Excom.
MATTER TABLED
ASSU President Hank Rosin, after
hearing arguments pro and con, pro
posed that the matter be tabled until
next week. Then, after members of
Excom Ifave had an opportunity to
sound out student opinion, speakers
will give arguments on both sides,
and a full discussion will be held.
Excom also made the following
appointments:
1. Ed Wells as student member of
the Union Board of Governors.
2. Ken Cundy as chairman, and

recommended installing three signs:
Village, downtown Palo Alto, and
across Palo Alto to Bayshore. His
offer was accepted.
The Kappa chapter of Delta Phi
Epsilon, foreign service fraternity,
was granted a charter by Excom.
Last spring the present Foreign
Service Association had objected to
the granting of the charter on the
ground that the fraternal organiza
tion would interfere and compete
with it.
GROITS AGREE
Excom therefore recommended,
last spring, that the two groups dis
cuss the matter over the summer.
This was done, and the Foreign
Service Association now supports
the granting of the charter to Delta
Phi Omega. This organization will
meet Friday night at 7:30 in the Ex
com room.
A report was made on the Film
Revival Series by Jim Thurber. The
series was not presented this quarter
because the Committee on Public
Exercises felt that too much was
going on fall and spring quarters,
because the auditorium had already
been reserved Thursday nights for
football movies, and because there
were not enough movies available to
show them quarter after quarter.
This series has always sold out,
however.

The Kappa chapter of Delta Phi
Epsilon, foreign service fraternity,
was granted a charter by Excom.
Last spring the present Foreign
Service Association had objected to
the granting of the charter on the
ground that the fraternal organiza
tion would interfere and compete
with it.
GROITS AGREE
Excom therefore recommended,
last spring, that the two groups dis
cuss the matter over the summer.
This was done, and the Foreign
Service Association now supports
the granting of the charter to Delta
Phi Omega. This organization will
meet Friday night at 7:30 in the Ex

A report was made on the Film
Revival Series by Jim Thurber. The
series was not presented this quarter
because the Committee on Public
Exercises felt that too much was
going on fall and spring quarters,
because the auditorium had already
been reserved Thursday nights for
football movies, and because there
were not enough movies available to
show them quarter after quarter.
This series has always sold out,
however.

wrapped and mailed to high school,

A proposal to add an interpreta
tion to the Stanford Honor Code
regarding the taking of examinations
out of classrooms was considered by
Excom last night.
The change would mean that if
adequate seating was provided — in
other words, il alternate scats were
available—then students could not
leave the examination room with
out the permission of the instructor.
Donn Wells, chairman of the
Honor Code Standing Committee,
said that this interpretation had
been approved by the committee,
but that he felt the matter was of
such great importance that it should
be passed upon by Excom.

ASSU President Hank Rosin, after
hearing arguments pro and con, pro
posed that the matter be tabled until
next week. Then, after members of
