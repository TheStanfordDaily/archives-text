. A whirlwind three-day fund-raising cam
.. .paign to send the Stanford Band to Seattle for
the Washington football game gets under way
this morning with tag-day tables set up at four
different spots on the Quad.
This weekend you will be contacted at ral
lies, at the dinner table, and in the rooting sec
tion Saturday, for donations to the drive.
" Although they have no funds available with
which to support the trip, the ASSU, the Uni
:-versify Administration, and the Athletic De
partment stand solidly behind the drive to
send the Band north for the first time.
Dr. Sterling, Dean Kimpton, A 1 Masters,
Marchie Schwartz, and the ASSU Excom have
all' Voiced their wholehearted approval. We
on The Daily would like to put in our bit, too.
i f'THere are many people in the Pacific North
-west- 1 v&ho know little about Stanford, except

that it went to the Rose Bowl in 1940, and that
it's a privately-owned university located some
where in California. To parade one of the besl
drilied and most colorful bands in the country
before the expected crowd of 40,000 can cer
tainly do the Stanford cause no harm.
Marchie Schwartz says that having the band
on the field away from home will give the
team a tremendous boost, and we're inclined
to agree.
The cost of sending a full 90-piece band to
Seattle is approximately $4,000. To send less
than a full band would be worse than sending
no band at all. In the words of Band Manager
Norm Hamilton,, "You've just got to have a
certain amount of noise down there or you
might as well not bother."
This is a fine project, worthy of our support.
Let's send a full band to Seattle.
