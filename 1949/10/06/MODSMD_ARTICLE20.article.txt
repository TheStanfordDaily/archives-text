### JOHN HALL 
/ ■;«. -Navigating around these Stanford "roads" lately,
" •4ias -brought to mind a few "live-fast die-young"
stories which should be passed along.
If you're tired ol books, or have just struck out in

attempts to snag a Big Game date,
or are despondent about not hav
ing any more Btta pailies to look
forward to. you might like to try
one for size.
The first is a simple setup
which requires only two cars, a
lonely road, and a pair ol jockeys.
The cars are placed at opposite
ends of the chosen section. Then,
they jump forward at full speed
heading directly toward each
other.

At the last possible instant, one veers oil and avoids
a head-011 crash. Ol course, if neither car chooses to
veer, then the game is over.
It should be mentioned at this point that these
stories are actual games, as reported by a Chicago
policeman who had been assigned to investigate 'teen
age driving in the Windy City.
At first, I figured that the boys had probably just
Watched the Chicago Cubs once too often, but any
way, on with the report.
The next one lakes a half-dozen persons. They get

going about 70 as everyone hovers as close as possible
to the wheel. Then the driver lets go. The first one
to touch the wheel is "Chicken."
"Rotation" is another cute one. It demands a sedan,
six occupants and, naturally, the 70 miles an hour.
At that .speed, the driver suddenly opens the front
door of the car. The man next to him takes the wheel,
while the first man works his way to the rear seat by
the outside route.
Meantime, a rear-seat occupant has opened a door
on the right, and n.akes his way to the front. This
process is repeated until all six have had their turn
or are laid out in the morgue.
I don't know what it all means, but in Chicago
they're getting quite worried about it. 1 just thought
you would like to know.

As long as I'm passing stuff along today, I've heard
the story about the Stanford journalism major who.
during the war, was working for Stars and Stiipes.
He was wording on copy desk one night, enjoying
himself, and showing it by loudly whistling.
Two old hands, annoyed by this obnoxious form of
sell-entertainment, snarled "Look, buddy, lor vyhal
paper did you ever work that you whistled on copy
desk?"
Being a Stanford man and clever besides, he
whipped back "Downbeat," and that was that.
