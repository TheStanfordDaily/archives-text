To the Editor:
Did you know that:
1. li each student contributed J cent each day when
picking up his Daily (assuming 5.000 copies are dis
tributed every morning) at the end of a school year
approximately S'J.OOO would be realized?
2. This V.J.01)0 would buy 1)00 packages oi lood
which would be sent by CAh'E, in Stanford's name,
to needy families all over Europe?

3. Nine thousand dollars could be used for a Stan
ford Daily Scholarship Fund—or for dozens of worth
while relief funds.
Who knows, some sympathetic soul might even
suggest that the money be used to keep the Stanford
Crew afloat!
