### GORDON ADDISON 
Thirty Octobers ago a young man
sporting a clink topped with a red
button mounted the steps of old Se
; quoia Hall to become a freshman in
! Lei,and Stanford Jr. University.
Last week the same man—this
j time wearing the khaki cap of the
'U.S. Army — mounted the stairway
of the BAC Building to assume his
J duties as Assistant Professor of
I Military Science and Tactics of the
j Stanford ROTC unit.
Tile officer, Lt. Col. Samuel £.
Vaughan, recalled his undergraduate
days this week as tile c:unpus buzzed
with the excitement of the ap
j proa chin,' 4 Conference football
j games.
A JLORSIi-DKAWN ROTC
"The ROTC in the old days con
sisted mainly of horse-drawn artil
! lery," the new officer said. "The old
j stables still stand in the ROTC Mo
tor Park, l.oxed in lpr classrooms,
jiifle ranges, and storage space. But
the last of the horses left in 1942,"
| Vaughan added.
Ihe French 75's and the American
three-inch guns used for training in
j those days all found their way to
the melting pots during the war
I scrap drives, he explained.
It is the college life of the early
j '20's that is remembered best by
j Vaughan. At that time, there were
only 2,000 students, including 500
women.
sorokijh:s—and now.
The sororities left an indelible
mark » Vaughan's mind. "I think
; I still have the chart which rated
| the different sororities and their
special characteristics," the lieuten
ant colonel remarked. "The hori-
I zontal graph rated beauty and
j brains—naturally running in oppo
[ site directions; and the vertical chart
;. bowed danciir; and—" he hesitated,
"affection," The subject changed.
The Farm of 1 i'2o was much more
rugged than the Farm today. In his
day, Vaughan reported, the fresh
! men and sophomores gathered on
I opposite hills and then stormed the
top of the Row —the real no-man's
> land. The object of the battle was
I for the men to capture class adver
saries and then drag them to the
nearest water hydrant where a hose
was thrust down their throats until
they were nearly drowned.
THE BASEBALL TILT
J "Then there was the annual
spring baseball fight in which the
varsity baseball captain hurled the
| ball into the Frosh-Soph mob. The
idea was for one class to return the

ball to the captain after pocketing
it until G p.m.
Of the professors who cracked the
whip over Vaughan and his under
classmen pals, only two remain.
They are Boynton Green, now head
of the Engineering Department, and
Welton J. Crook, of the Metallurgy
Department.
During five years on the Farm,
Vaughan graduated with Great
Distinction, and was a member of
Scabbard and Blade.
A NATIONAL OBLIGATION
From then on. his was a military
story— reserve commission in il>23,
National Guard in 1936, active serv
ice in 1941, and finally occupation
duly in Korea in 1945. In the Ori?nt,
ihe officer commanded battalions in
California's own 40th Division as
well as the (itn Division. He was
also executive officer for the Gth
Division artillery.
After oO years in the Army,
Colonel Vaughan still is a strong
advocate of the ROTC program.
The program, the returning Stan
iordite stressed, "should reach every
freshman and every freshman
should reach for it as his obligation
to the nation."
