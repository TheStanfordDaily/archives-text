i type of experience necessary lor
later commercial work. Its facilities,
owned by the University, include a
sound-proof studio, sound-proof an
nouueer's booth, and an engineering
! i.nJ porducer's booth. KZSU oper

j comparable to those in commercial

ciprocal attitude. We co-operate
J much as possible. It works I OUI
| ways."
Said Dr. Donner, "1 don't assign
j ..tudents to work on KZSU, but I
| always urge them to do so." In re
| tui 11, he advises KZSU workers to
I lake radio courses, though they are
j not required for working on the
j station.
Dr. Donner claimed that Stan
ford's radio department is quite ad
i vaticed. "We try to oiler all basic
[ courses in radio," he said. "In doing
' this, we will compare favorably,
course-wise, with almost any school
| in the country."
TELEVISION COURSE OPEN
Expansion is expected in the tele
| vision courses, said the radio di
; rector. Equipment may be forth -
! coming, as well as new and more
| advanced courses. Upperclassmen
| are wanted especially for the tele
vision course "Problems in Te!e
-i vision." However, commented Dr.

I lei t open to anyone, without pre
requisites, so that any genuinely in
