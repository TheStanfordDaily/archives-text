# Sun Tanned Stanford Nurses Are Hardest-Working Coeds
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
They're the stepchildren of the
Farm — and, frankly, they'd rather
not be a lust branch on the Stan
lord family tree.
Actually, students at the Stanford
School of Nursing in San Francisco
are a part of the ASSU. And, con
trary to legend, shimmering halos
don't hover over their heads, anil
they don't all marry doctors.
Of course, life in the seven-story
dorm across from the Stanford-Lane
Hospital does have its peculiarities.
On what other part of the "campus,"
for instance, does a sun-bathing
coed have to Hee at the sight of a
helicopter? And there are the mon
keys in the research lab next door,
who are likely to bellow with a
toothache or just want to turn on
some monkey jabber at midnight.
CARDINAL IN SPIRIT
But in most ways the nursing"
school is more like the Farm. It
vigorously carries on the old give
'em-the-axe rivalry with the Cal
nursing and medical schools in San
Francisco. And, not to be outdone
by the Farm's colossal intake of
>tray dogs, the School does a fair
business in the homeless cat line.
Although the School is a very defi
nite part of the University, its only
direct contact with the Farm is as
an entry in the Spring Sing. This,
the students agree, is not only most
unsati.sfftciory from a coed's point of
view, but also results in that "out
on the limb" position in most stu
dent activities. For instance, a week
after this quarter began, nursing
students were still trying to get hold
ot their student body cards. And as
for reading the Chappie, they don't
see one—ever.
Last spring quarter someone boldly
clutched the ASSU Constitution and
made the startling suggestion that
maybe, since they were members of
the ASSU, the nurses should vote in
the school elections. However, this
revolutionary idea came to a stand
still when ASSU officers overlooked
a suggestion that the nursing and
medical schools hold an assembly to
meet the candidates.
A-1 CLASSIFICATION
11 its contact with the Farm is
wobbly however, at least its posi
tion on the Pacific Coast is strong.
Stanford's School of Nursing rates
high in the state examination re
quired of registered nurses. Out of
last year's graduating class 03 per
cent received an A grade on the test.
Out of the eight nursing schools in
San Francisco, the Stanford and Cal
schools are the only ones to have
reciprocity with other states. This
means that a graduate, having passed
the California test, need not take
another test to practice nursing in
another state.
The School of Nursing encom
passes a three-year program. Stu
dents may enter the School only
after they have completed two years
of college pre-nursing training.
About one-third of the students take
their college requirements at Stan
ford. At the end of three years, the
Bachelor of Science degree is
awarded, at which time the student
i.s officially a graduate of the Uni
versity. However, students remain
lor three months of ward work, with
no classes, before taking the state
examination for registered nurses.
In taking the B.S. degree in addi
tion to a nursing certificate (which
may be obtained without college re
quirements), students prepare them
selves for superintendent and teach
ing positions as well as for bedside
nursing. >
48-HOUR WEEK
Students have eight hours of
ward work and classes each day,
working a 48-hour week. Ward work
pays for board and room while tui
tion is $120 a quarter. Because of
irregular hours, all of the 75 students
have single rooms. Come Big Game
time, its quite a job to get ward
hours shifted in order to see the
game. too. Meals are served cafe

teria style in two-hour stretches so
that girls can eat going on and
coming off of shifts.
Vacations are almost as irregular
as ward hours. Each girl gets four
weeks in the summer, but her
Christmas recess is just as apt as
not to come sometime in February.
Late leaves and Women's Council
are not unheard-of phenomena to
the nurses. Freshmen at the School
gel two 12:30'5, a 2:.'JO, and an over
night each week. Seniors get un
limited Lite leaves. Married stu
dents maintain a room at the School
for when they come off of late
shifts, and they may take a leave ol
absence to start a family.
DATE TROUBLES
The Stanford Medical School is
frequently invited to the School's
social functions, but more of the
girls seem to date the Cal mod stu
dents. Less than one per cent ol
the doctors and interns are eligible
dates. Even the Med School classes
which started during and just alter
the war presented a dating problem
because of the large percentage of
married men.
Besides, there's something the
Stanford med students can't quite
get Over. Every time they want to
do something, like test a patient's
blood or redress a wound, they
can't do a thing until a nurse de
cides she has time or wants to. And.
after all, what man is going to take
that kind of treatment from his last
Saturday's date!
