# Social Security Pusses
## 
### 
WASHINGTON—The House vot
ed today for a bigger Social Security
system—covering more people, pay
ing higher benefits, and to cost, after
'JO years, three times larger payroll .
taxes.
On the showdown, only 14 votes :
were cast against it. There were 333
for it.
The administration measure sailed
through overwhelmingly after the
House first slapped down, 232 to 113,
a proposed substitute offered by 1() #
Republicans.
Like the administration bill, the
GOP hill would have expanded
Social Security but at a slower gait.
