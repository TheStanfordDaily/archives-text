Per capita lire loss of $.335 for
the Stanford community was well
below the nation's average loss of
$5.08. Fire Chief John Marston an
| nounced yesterday.
The Stanford Fire Department is
(he local sponsor of Fire Preven
tion Week, October 9 to 15, spon
sored nationally by the National
Fire Protection Association.
FARM LOST $3,354
Monetary loss by lire for the en
tire country amounted to $700,000,-
: 000 last year. At Stanford the loss
was $3,354.41, Chief Marston said.
He credited Stanford's low average
! to generous support by students and
j other campus residents.
In spite of this record, Chief Mar
ston added, Stanford should be con
tinually on the alert to eliminate
lire hazards and thus keep the loss
and damage low.
The fact that human carelessness
is the basic cause ol nearly all fires,
as announced by the NFPA, is sup
ported by Chief Marston's annual
report for the year ending August
31, 1949.
CARELESSNESS MAIN CAUSE
Of the 103 calls the department
responded to last year, 10 grass fires
and 11 rubbish fires were the results
of careless burning alone. Other
alarms resulting from carelessness
were five started by cigarettes in
wastepaper baskets, two by smok
ing in bed, one by children playing
with matches, and several others by
careless handling of cigarettes.
Chief Marston's annual report lists
several calls not resulting from ac
tual fires. Included in these were
four requests for assistance from
students locked out of Univrsity
residences.
