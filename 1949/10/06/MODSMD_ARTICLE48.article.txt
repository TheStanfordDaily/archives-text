# FIRST WORLD SERIES GAME
## Series Dressing Rooms Lack Clamor and Dramor of Old Bum Locker Room 
### 
NEW YORK, o<t. 5 </P> — Don
Newcombe, a pitcher who came
close to World belies immortality,
ragged down his 2£5 pounds in the
Dodgers' dressing room and pressed
his resin-stained finger and thumb
against the bridge of his nose to
hold back the tears.
"Reynolds pitched a helluva ball
l_ame," he said a voice so low it
could scarcely be heard.
The Brooklyn Dodger dressing
room was deadly quiet.
Jackie Rol inson, standing nude
close to the despondent Newcombe,
joined in praising Yankee Allie
Reynolds.
' You can't get runs when you face
pitching like that." said Jackie.
Newcombe whispered that it was
a curve that Tommy Henrich belted
for the decisive ninth-inning home
run — 'a curve ball, a good pitch."
A lew men came up and clapped
Newcombe on his bare shoulders and
said "nice going," "tough" and things
like that. Most of them went away
rapidly because Newcombe's sad
ness was the kind no one wanted to
l.y to intrude on.
"One pitch did it," said Manager
l.urt Shotton. "Except for that we'd
still be out there."
Newcombe was slated to hurl
three games if the Seiies goes the
limit. The six-foot four-inch right
hander, who rose suddenly to star
dom in his rookie year, proved bis
unusual stamina in the late pennant
drive when he was called upon al
most every other day.
