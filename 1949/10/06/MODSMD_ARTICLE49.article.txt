NFW YORK. Oct. 5 (A J ) â€”Tommy
Henrich pushed his cap back and
scratched his head. There was a j
: puzzled look on his face as he said; j
"I don't know what kind of a I
pitch it was that I hit. I think it
j was either a fast ball or a slider,
j Anyway it looked pretty so j
i 1 hit it."
Henrich had just broken up a I
tense World Series pitching duel be- j
tween Allie Reynolds and Don New- j
j combe by belting New Combe's sec- i
ond pitch in the ninth inning for a |
: game-winning home run.
In the dressing room, the Yankee i
first baseman was doing his best to t
live up to his nickname of "The i
j Old Pro." He wasn't showing much
excitement and was doing his best
i to analyze the game.
"I never saw a World Series game
' that had the pitchers so much in
j charge," Tommy continued. "The
players on our bench all were say
ing that Newcombe gave them very
' few good ones to hit. He really was
the boss, and so was Reynolds."
Reynolds, who shut out the
Dodegrs with two hits, was taking j
his first World Series just us calmly, i
He posed giving Henrich a big hug j
for the benefit of photographers, i
then, .still wearing a jacket over his
uniform, lie explained:
"No, I didn't have as much stuff
today as I had the other day against
Boston, but I just couldn't find the
i plate then, today I had good control.''
