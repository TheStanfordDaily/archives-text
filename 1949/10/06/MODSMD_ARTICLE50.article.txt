# Irony and Melodrama Spice Series Rivals
## 
### GIL JONAS 
Preacher Roe, slated to start for
Brooklyn today, only four or five
years ago was informed by medics
that he would never pitch again as
a result of a brain concussion in
curred alter a collision with a bas
ketball referee. The slender Arkan
sas southpaw questioned a decision
against the high school five he was
coaching and the referee promptly
pushed him down a flight of
stairs. . . .
Johnny Mize, the former great
N.L. slugger now lidiny the bench
for the Yankees, Iks never played
on a World Series nine. . . .
Last April Brooklyn prexy
Branch Rickey told Don Newcombe
lie wasn't ready for the majors and
sent the giant rii ht-hander to Mon
treal. Disconsolate Don went home
to Elizabeth, N.J., instead of the Ca

nadian metropolis but, after a few
days, humbly called Branch to ask
for forgiveness. The Great White
Father of the Bums condescended,
Newcombe was recalled in June
and led the Brooks to the flag
with a 17-8 record. He hurled a
typical Newcombe contest yester
day BUT. . . .
Indian Allie Reynolds, whom New
York sportswriters "rode" through
out the campaign as Fireman Joe
Page's ''better half," pitched the
iinest game of his career, and soft
spoken, except with the Louisville
Sluggers, Tommy Hen rich sewed it
up with a four-master. Which is
typically "Yankee Style."
Only once before yesterday's
thriller has a World Series game
been won by the score of a 1 to 0
on a home run. On that other oc
casion, another subway series in
1923 between the Yanks and the
Giants, the decider was clouted by
a New York outfielder named Casey
Stengel, the present manager of the
Bronx Bombers.
There's a forgotten man on the
Yank roster, a rotund right-hander
with a rosy-hued complexion, who
figured twice before in World Series
for the team he is now opposing,
and against his present club. In
19-H this relief hurler made Mickey
Owen famous by throwing a third
strike pa>t Tommy Henrieh in the
ninth inning of a game that would
have knotted the Series. The ball
curved right on past Henrieh, past
catcher Owen, and passed the Bums
out of the money, for the Yanks,
given the break, poured five runs
over to win. In 1947, this same
hurler saved all three Dodger vic
tories with stellar relief perform
ances against the Bombers and re
ceived credit for two wins. Today
he is right behind Joe Page, waiting
to get a crack at his old club. His
name is Hugh Casey.

spoken, except with the Louisville
Sluggers, Tommy Hen rich sewed it
up with a four-master. Which is
typically "Yankee Style."
Only once before yesterday's
thriller has a World Series game
been won by the score of a 1 to 0
on a home run. On that other oc
casion, another subway series in
1923 between the Yanks and the
Giants, the decider was clouted by
a New York outfielder named Casey
Stengel, the present manager of the
Bronx Bombers.
There's a forgotten man on the
Yank roster, a rotund right-hander
with a rosy-hued complexion, who
figured twice before in World Series
for the team he is now opposing,
and against his present club. In
19-H this relief hurler made Mickey
Owen famous by throwing a third
strike pa>t Tommy Henrieh in the
ninth inning of a game that would
have knotted the Series. The ball
curved right on past Henrieh, past
catcher Owen, and passed the Bums
out of the money, for the Yanks,
given the break, poured five runs
over to win. In 1947, this same
hurler saved all three Dodger vic
tories with stellar relief perform
ances against the Bombers and re
ceived credit for two wins. Today
he is right behind Joe Page, waiting
to get a crack at his old club. His
name is Hugh Casey.
Preacher Roe, slated to start for
Brooklyn today, only four or five
years ago was informed by medics
that he would never pitch again as
a result of a brain concussion in
curred alter a collision with a bas
ketball referee. The slender Arkan
sas southpaw questioned a decision
against the high school five he was
coaching and the referee promptly
pushed him down a flight of
stairs. . . .
Johnny Mize, the former great
N.L. slugger now lidiny the bench
for the Yankees, Iks never played
on a World Series nine. . . .
Last April Brooklyn prexy
Branch Rickey told Don Newcombe
lie wasn't ready for the majors and
sent the giant rii ht-hander to Mon
treal. Disconsolate Don went home
to Elizabeth, N.J., instead of the Ca

nadian metropolis but, after a few
days, humbly called Branch to ask
for forgiveness. The Great White
Father of the Bums condescended,
Newcombe was recalled in June
and led the Brooks to the flag
with a 17-8 record. He hurled a
typical Newcombe contest yester
day BUT. . . .
Indian Allie Reynolds, whom New
York sportswriters "rode" through
out the campaign as Fireman Joe
Page's ''better half," pitched the
