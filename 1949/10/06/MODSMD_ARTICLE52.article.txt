# Pitching Control Dulls Crowd Spirit in Opener
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 5 (/P) â€” You
had a feeling that something like
that was going to happen.
When Don Newcombe strode to
the mound with his long, ungainly
strides in the last of the ninth in
ning his fellow players must have
had a premonition too. Spider Jor
gensen, and Pee wee Reese, and
Jackie Robinson took turns trotting
up to pat him on the back and offer
words of encouragement. They
hadn't felt the need to do that be
fore.
It happened so suddenly the crowd
reaction was delayed, and the roar
came almost like a tremendous echo.
One moment there was an authori
tative crack of a bat against a ball,
and the experienced observers took
one quick look. They knew it was
in there.
CROWD SILENT
Until then the crowd sat for the
most part in polite silence, as in
ning after inning Newcombe and Al
lie Reynolds mowed down the hit
ters with methodical efficiency.
As someone said, it was only three
days after the end of the season and
the pitchers still were ahead of the
hitters. Anyway, the crowd really
had little to get excited about, al
though in contrast to the crowd
which saw the Yankee-Red Sox
games lust Saturday and Sunday the
enthusiasm was missing.
Possibly because the real fans
were gathered at the corner pubs or
hanging around radios as their more
opulent brethren, the one-a-year
fans, took over the stadium. One
distinguished looking gentleman,
when Jorgensen hit one into the
right field stands that was foul by
not too much, replied hesitantly
when his feminine companion asked
if it was foul:
CROWD STIRS
"I guess so, it was on this side
of that pole out there."
But as the game droned along
there really was little to keep the
fans on edge. It had been so me
chanically perfect up to the filth in
ning that when Gerry Coleman let
Carl Furillo's easy grounder roll be
tween his legs it had the effect ol

dousing the dozing crowd with cold
water.
You really could count the mildly
thrilling moments on the fingers of
one hand. There was Joe DiMag
gio's fine catch of Robinson's tre
mendous drive in the sixth, Jorgen
stn's "almost" home run, and
Reese's steal of second in the eighth.
Maybe a couple more, but all in
all it was Reynolds and Ncwcombe
and Newcombe and Reynolds, pitch
ing with such deadly efficiency that
even the fielder's chances for the
most part were routine.
As anticipated, the teams were as
evenly matched in practically all
departments as a pair of bookends,
and you got the idea they would
be playing yet if Hen rich hadn't
leaned into one in the ninth inning,
it was just a question of which
team would get the first break.
CROWD EXPLODES
It probably was particularly fit
ting that the old pro, Henrich, broke
up the game. The guy has gone
through a season of broken bones
and aches and pains, playing when
he should have been on crutches.

Somehow you got the idea, as you
swa him loping across the plate with
his face split in a Jack O'Lantern
yrin, that the moment was worth
weeks of suffering.
All the drama oi the muggy,
breezeless day was wrapped up in
that one titanic blow, and we can
imagine Casey Stengel's mind flash
ing back a quarter of a century to
the day when he himself had been
the man to break up a much-similar
ball game.
