# UCLA Appears Fit But Cards Ready For First Conference Foe
## Ex-Sports Editor Gives an Opinion 
### JOHN HALL 
UCLA's three-in-a-row Bruins
look like sure things to be rated an
even toss-up with Stanford when
the two get together Saturday in
the Stadium.
One month ago that would not
have been the case. The Bruins were
considered to be definitely minor
league. But in three straight out
ings, UCLA has captured the eye of
the entire Coast.
Henry Sanders has given them a
single wing, short-punt style, that
is powerful and dangerous, and with
a tailback such as Ernie Johnson,
the Bruins could go all the way.
But leave us face it. UCLA is not
Michigan, and Stanford will have to
play stumble-bum football to make
them look like Michigan.
The Bruins are riding high right
now because it's been clear sailing,
excepting the Oregon game perhaps,
which gave them a slight push. But
a couple ol hard knocks could break
them wide open.
JOHNSON IS FINE BACK
UCLA is too shallow to stand off
the big hoys. It's true that Ernie
Johnson is one of the finest running
backs in the business, and that
Henry Sanders from Vanderbilt has
given the We.stwooders a new spirit,
but how long Johnson and the spirit
will last is questionable.
The IGU-pound Ernest has yet to
go a full season without getting
blasted out of contention with an
injury. Last season it was Stanford's
Don Campbell who met him head-on
to put him out of commission.
But Johnson seems to be healthier
this year. He's doing yeoman work
at running, passing, and pass-catch
ing-. And he's doing all of them
well enough to make UCLA a lead
ing contender for the Conference
crown.
But there are several Haws in the
Bruin paws, and they could well
lead to their downfall.
UCLA's pass defense appears to be
nil. lowa plunked out nine successes
in 17 tries with two going lor fourth
quarter touchdowns. Oregon did
even better, completing 10 for 15,
and using the air to get all lour
scores.
If Shaw, Kerkorian, and Mitchell
are anywhere up to snuff, the In
dians ought to be able to take ad
vantage of the slow-footed Uclan
secondary.
CARDINAL PRACTICE
Last night in practice, the Curds
looked as if they would do all right
along those lines.
Marchie Schwartz turned both the
offensive and defensive units loose
in a lengthy pair of scrimmages yes
terday, but the center of attention
remained right on the passers.
Tom Shaw was back in action
after sitting out one day because
of a cold, and he was connecting
frequently, as were Mitchell, and
Kerkorian.
The football managers dressed up
a couple of JV boys in Ernie John
son's No. 17 jersey and turned them
loose against the defense. But
against Castagnoli, Abraham, Poine
roy, and Van Alstyne, the ersatz
Johnsons didn't fare too well.
While the defense worked at one
end of the field, the offense was
down at the other end trying to
spring Rupe Andrews or Bob White
or Boyd Benson out into the open.
Spirit seems to be high on the
field. It will have to be if Stanford
is to stop the Bruins at three.
The Indian injury list is getting
smaller every day. A 1 Rau is still
a doubtful starter. At best, he will
not get to work this week.
A 1 Laakso is still out. Holy Boruek
hasn't been able to scrimmage yet,
and Joe Jacobs hasn't shaken off his
thumb injury, but other than that
ihe Tribe looks trim and ready.

of a cold, and he was connecting
frequently, as were Mitchell, and
Kerkorian.
The football managers dressed up
a couple of JV boys in Ernie John
son's No. 17 jersey and turned them
loose against the defense. But
against Castagnoli, Abraham, Poine
roy, and Van Alstyne, the ersatz
Johnsons didn't fare too well.
While the defense worked at one
end of the field, the offense was
down at the other end trying to
spring Rupe Andrews or Bob White
or Boyd Benson out into the open.
Spirit seems to be high on the
field. It will have to be if Stanford
is to stop the Bruins at three.
The Indian injury list is getting
smaller every day. A 1 Rau is still
a doubtful starter. At best, he will
not get to work this week.
A 1 Laakso is still out. Holy Boruek
hasn't been able to scrimmage yet,
and Joe Jacobs hasn't shaken off his
thumb injury, but other than that
ihe Tribe looks trim and ready.
UCLA's three-in-a-row Bruins
look like sure things to be rated an
even toss-up with Stanford when
the two get together Saturday in
the Stadium.
One month ago that would not
have been the case. The Bruins were
considered to be definitely minor
league. But in three straight out
ings, UCLA has captured the eye of
the entire Coast.
Henry Sanders has given them a
single wing, short-punt style, that
is powerful and dangerous, and with
a tailback such as Ernie Johnson,
the Bruins could go all the way.
But leave us face it. UCLA is not
Michigan, and Stanford will have to
play stumble-bum football to make
them look like Michigan.
The Bruins are riding high right
now because it's been clear sailing,
excepting the Oregon game perhaps,
which gave them a slight push. But
a couple ol hard knocks could break
them wide open.
JOHNSON IS FINE BACK
UCLA is too shallow to stand off
the big hoys. It's true that Ernie
Johnson is one of the finest running
backs in the business, and that
Henry Sanders from Vanderbilt has
given the We.stwooders a new spirit,
but how long Johnson and the spirit
will last is questionable.
The IGU-pound Ernest has yet to
go a full season without getting
blasted out of contention with an
injury. Last season it was Stanford's
Don Campbell who met him head-on
to put him out of commission.
But Johnson seems to be healthier
this year. He's doing yeoman work
at running, passing, and pass-catch
ing-. And he's doing all of them
well enough to make UCLA a lead
ing contender for the Conference
crown.
But there are several Haws in the
Bruin paws, and they could well
lead to their downfall.
UCLA's pass defense appears to be
nil. lowa plunked out nine successes
in 17 tries with two going lor fourth
quarter touchdowns. Oregon did
even better, completing 10 for 15,
and using the air to get all lour
scores.
If Shaw, Kerkorian, and Mitchell
are anywhere up to snuff, the In
dians ought to be able to take ad
vantage of the slow-footed Uclan
secondary.
CARDINAL PRACTICE
Last night in practice, the Curds
looked as if they would do all right
along those lines.
Marchie Schwartz turned both the
offensive and defensive units loose
in a lengthy pair of scrimmages yes

remained right on the passers.
