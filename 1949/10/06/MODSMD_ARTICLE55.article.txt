# BOB BERNSTEIN
## Midweek Musings 
### 
I rather expected Frankie to be
pretty I-told-you-so-ish about the
Michigan game. So when I stopped
in at 1 lis bar on E! Camino last
night, 1 didn't say anything about it,
just grabbed a stool and ordered my
usual.
Frankie didn't say anything at
first either, not until he was setting
my beer in front of me.
"When you guys gonna learn that
Coast football is strictly from high
school?"
I'm a die-hard, and besides I did
n't like his insolence .
"It woulda been different if we
hadn't made those two first-quarter
fumbles," I said, not believing a
word of it.
Frankie didn't answer. I didn't
blame him.
He went back to polishing the
ylass he had been working on when
I came in.
The guy sitting next to me looked
up from his beer - stained green
sheet and addressed Frankie.
"Didja see where Will Connolly
says Stanford has an even chance
of going to the Bowl?"
Frankie showed disgust, contin
ued wiping his glass. "You're drunk.
Go tell your wife to make some
black coffee."
"No, here it is in black and
green."
Frankie carefully put down the
glass, which by all rights should
have been worn through by this
time, and twisted around to where
he could read the green.
After a moment, "I apologize.
Conno'ly's the one needs the coffee."
That was my cue. "How do you
figure? Not being able to lick the
pros is no reason we can't beat any-
I thing on the Coast. You said your
self the Coast is weak."
"You'll be lucky to get by UCLA."
"Just because they've managed to
score a few touchdowns against
some weak sisters? We're on to the
I single wing by now, and theirs
won't look like Michigan's by a long
shot."
"Oregon's no weak sister. UCLA
scored five times against Oregon."
I laughed, disdainfully I hoped.
"And Oregon scored four times
against them."
I pointed out further that Oregon
without Van Brocklin was like Bo
gart without Bacall: apt to get into
trouble. And that the Bruins' of
fense depended on one man, Ernie
Johnson, and that a one-man attack
can be pretty unstable.

This time Frankie laughed, dis
dainfully for sure. "When you gon
na quit using those newspaper sto
ries for a Bible and look at the
actual statistics? They've got two
other good passers, Kay Nagel and
Cliff Schroeder. Both of 'em com
pleted a higher percentage than
Johnson in the first two games.
"Furthermore," Frankie was now
breaking all his old records for non
stop vocalizing, "Howard Hansen
averaged almost 10 yards per carry
in those first two games. Johnson's
running average was under three
yards. And Braly's outdistanced him
in punting. 50 yards to 37.
"Not that Johnson isn't plenty
good. He's probably the best back
on the Coast. But he'll have plenty
of help when it comes to beating
Stanford."
I hadn't prepared for an argument
with a walking record book, and I
was forced to stall for time while I
recovered from that statisitcal bar
rage. I took two long drags from my
glass, drained it, lit a Lucky, ad
justed my specs, and returned to
battle.
"So they might score a few times.
We'U score more."
I had a few figures myself; so I
explained to Frankie that the West
wooders' first two opponents, Ore
gon State and lowa, had piled up
more total yardage than the Bruins
had in the same two games.
But that didn't stop him long.
"Last week they gained ten times
as much by rushing as Oregon. And
Johnson passed for 118 yards all by
himself against Oregon, which is
still a good ball club."
I must have weakened visibly, cuz
Friinkie gave me another beer—on
the house.
He isn't such a bad guy at that.

Emery Mitchell led the Stanford
backs last year in yardage gained
against conference opponents: 532
yards.
I rather expected Frankie to be

just grabbed a stool and ordered my

"When you guys gonna learn that
Coast football is strictly from high
school?"

pros is no reason we can't beat any-
I thing on the Coast. You said your
self the Coast is weak."
"You'll be lucky to get by UCLA."
"Just because they've managed to
score a few touchdowns against
some weak sisters? We're on to the
I single wing by now, and theirs
won't look like Michigan's by a long
shot."
"Oregon's no weak sister. UCLA
scored five times against Oregon."
I laughed, disdainfully I hoped.
"And Oregon scored four times
against them."
I pointed out further that Oregon
without Van Brocklin was like Bo
gart without Bacall: apt to get into
trouble. And that the Bruins' of
fense depended on one man, Ernie
Johnson, and that a one-man attack
can be pretty unstable.

This time Frankie laughed, dis
dainfully for sure. "When you gon
na quit using those newspaper sto
ries for a Bible and look at the
actual statistics? They've got two
other good passers, Kay Nagel and
Cliff Schroeder. Both of 'em com
pleted a higher percentage than
Johnson in the first two games.
"Furthermore," Frankie was now
breaking all his old records for non
stop vocalizing, "Howard Hansen
averaged almost 10 yards per carry
in those first two games. Johnson's
running average was under three
yards. And Braly's outdistanced him
in punting. 50 yards to 37.
"Not that Johnson isn't plenty
good. He's probably the best back
on the Coast. But he'll have plenty
of help when it comes to beating
Stanford."
I hadn't prepared for an argument
with a walking record book, and I
was forced to stall for time while I
recovered from that statisitcal bar
rage. I took two long drags from my
glass, drained it, lit a Lucky, ad
justed my specs, and returned to
battle.
"So they might score a few times.
We'U score more."
I had a few figures myself; so I
explained to Frankie that the West
wooders' first two opponents, Ore
gon State and lowa, had piled up
more total yardage than the Bruins
had in the same two games.
But that didn't stop him long.
"Last week they gained ten times
as much by rushing as Oregon. And
Johnson passed for 118 yards all by
himself against Oregon, which is
still a good ball club."
I must have weakened visibly, cuz
Friinkie gave me another beer—on
the house.
He isn't such a bad guy at that.

Emery Mitchell led the Stanford
backs last year in yardage gained
against conference opponents: 532
yards.
I rather expected Frankie to be
pretty I-told-you-so-ish about the
Michigan game. So when I stopped
in at 1 lis bar on E! Camino last
night, 1 didn't say anything about it,
just grabbed a stool and ordered my
usual.
Frankie didn't say anything at
first either, not until he was setting
my beer in front of me.
"When you guys gonna learn that
Coast football is strictly from high
school?"
I'm a die-hard, and besides I did
n't like his insolence .
"It woulda been different if we
hadn't made those two first-quarter
fumbles," I said, not believing a
word of it.
Frankie didn't answer. I didn't
blame him.
He went back to polishing the
ylass he had been working on when
I came in.
The guy sitting next to me looked
up from his beer - stained green
sheet and addressed Frankie.
"Didja see where Will Connolly
says Stanford has an even chance
of going to the Bowl?"
Frankie showed disgust, contin
ued wiping his glass. "You're drunk.
Go tell your wife to make some
black coffee."
"No, here it is in black and
green."
Frankie carefully put down the
glass, which by all rights should
have been worn through by this
time, and twisted around to where
he could read the green.
After a moment, "I apologize.
Conno'ly's the one needs the coffee."
That was my cue. "How do you
figure? Not being able to lick the

of help when it comes to beating
Stanford."
I hadn't prepared for an argument
with a walking record book, and I
was forced to stall for time while I
recovered from that statisitcal bar
rage. I took two long drags from my
glass, drained it, lit a Lucky, ad
justed my specs, and returned to
battle.
"So they might score a few times.
We'U score more."
I had a few figures myself; so I
explained to Frankie that the West
wooders' first two opponents, Ore
gon State and lowa, had piled up
more total yardage than the Bruins
had in the same two games.
But that didn't stop him long.
"Last week they gained ten times
as much by rushing as Oregon. And
Johnson passed for 118 yards all by
himself against Oregon, which is
still a good ball club."
I must have weakened visibly, cuz
Friinkie gave me another beer—on
the house.
He isn't such a bad guy at that.

Emery Mitchell led the Stanford
backs last year in yardage gained
against conference opponents: 532
yards.
I rather expected Frankie to be
pretty I-told-you-so-ish about the
Michigan game. So when I stopped
in at 1 lis bar on E! Camino last
night, 1 didn't say anything about it,
just grabbed a stool and ordered my
usual.
Frankie didn't say anything at
first either, not until he was setting
my beer in front of me.
"When you guys gonna learn that
Coast football is strictly from high
school?"
I'm a die-hard, and besides I did
n't like his insolence .
"It woulda been different if we
hadn't made those two first-quarter
fumbles," I said, not believing a
word of it.
Frankie didn't answer. I didn't
blame him.
He went back to polishing the
ylass he had been working on when
I came in.
The guy sitting next to me looked
up from his beer - stained green
sheet and addressed Frankie.
"Didja see where Will Connolly
says Stanford has an even chance
of going to the Bowl?"
Frankie showed disgust, contin
ued wiping his glass. "You're drunk.
Go tell your wife to make some
black coffee."
"No, here it is in black and
green."
Frankie carefully put down the
glass, which by all rights should
have been worn through by this
time, and twisted around to where
he could read the green.
After a moment, "I apologize.
Conno'ly's the one needs the coffee."
That was my cue. "How do you
figure? Not being able to lick the
pros is no reason we can't beat any-
I thing on the Coast. You said your
self the Coast is weak."
"You'll be lucky to get by UCLA."
"Just because they've managed to
score a few touchdowns against
some weak sisters? We're on to the
I single wing by now, and theirs
won't look like Michigan's by a long
shot."
"Oregon's no weak sister. UCLA
scored five times against Oregon."
I laughed, disdainfully I hoped.
"And Oregon scored four times
against them."
I pointed out further that Oregon
without Van Brocklin was like Bo
gart without Bacall: apt to get into
trouble. And that the Bruins' of
fense depended on one man, Ernie
Johnson, and that a one-man attack
can be pretty unstable.

This time Frankie laughed, dis
dainfully for sure. "When you gon
na quit using those newspaper sto
ries for a Bible and look at the
actual statistics? They've got two
other good passers, Kay Nagel and
Cliff Schroeder. Both of 'em com
pleted a higher percentage than
Johnson in the first two games.
"Furthermore," Frankie was now
breaking all his old records for non
stop vocalizing, "Howard Hansen
averaged almost 10 yards per carry
in those first two games. Johnson's
running average was under three
yards. And Braly's outdistanced him
in punting. 50 yards to 37.
"Not that Johnson isn't plenty
good. He's probably the best back
on the Coast. But he'll have plenty
of help when it comes to beating
Stanford."
I hadn't prepared for an argument
with a walking record book, and I
was forced to stall for time while I
