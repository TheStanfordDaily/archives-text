CHICAGO', Oct. 5 (/Pi Pushing a
lew numbers out of this week's loot
hall punchboard:
Michigan 20, Army 13 The Ca
dets have frolicked to a pair of easy
wins and come up to their first big
test with full wind . . . but it won't
be quite enough to blow over Mich
igan, ranked No. 1 in the AP na
tional poll after edging Michigan
State 7-3 and trouncing Stanford
27-7.
Southern California 11. Ohio State
13—This toss-up could conceivably
be a sneak preview ol the Rose Bowl
game .... the Trojans, playing at
home, rate a shade over a team
classed in the top four of the Big 10.
Notre Uaiue 27, Purdue 7 The
Boilermakers, victims of North
'western and lowa, hope Ilarry Szul
fcorski will be able to go at full
steam for the first time this season
. . . . but they will need more than
him to dent another solid Irish
outfit.
Texas Christian 20, Indiana 12 —
The Hoosiers have been buried un
der a total I JS points by Notre Dame
and Ohio State in their first two
games .... now they are ready
to give a team a run for its nione;
Cal it or iiia 14, Wisconsin 7 —
Smashing wins over Santa Clara, St.
Mary's and Oregon State have given
Pappy Waldorf's Bears a good start
which shouldn't be derailed now
. . . . the Badgers are vastly im
proved, making up in speed what
they lack in experience, and could
even surprise.
.Michigan State 21, Maryland 0—
Looks like another soft touch for
the Spartans who slammed Mar
quette 48-7 a week ago.
Minnesota 21, Northwestern 13—
Scouts are impressed with the Go
phers' two opening triumphs over
Washington (48-20) and Nebraska
(28-G) and believing it will take a
mighty good team to keep them
from the Rose Bowl and Big 10
championship.
lowa 19, Illinois 13— Should he
quite an aerial show between Glenn
Drahn, who led the Hawkeyes over
Purdue 21-7, and Illinois' Bernie
Krueger .... Illinois, showing it
has far from jelled in 20-20 and 13-
13 stalemates with lowa State and
Wisconsin, figures to lose to lowa
for the first time in seven years
unless it can cement defensive
weakness.
