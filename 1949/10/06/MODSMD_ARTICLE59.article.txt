# AL BERRY
## On The Bench 
### 
Tliat lonely-looking fellow sitting ;it tlie end ol the bench, amidst the
crunched paper cups and torn Michigan programs, is me. Well, blazes, 1
only missed the final score by a mere 34 points, a thing like that could
happen to anybody. Besides, J4 from 100 is 06 times 10 equals 600 And
what's the matter with 600 as a batting average?
It wasn't that the Wolverines had a more experienced team t.'ian Stan
ford, but I think that it is somewhat gay to note that their team captain,
tackle Al Wistert, was playing high school football when Stanford end
Bill McColl was horn.
But seriously, for a moment, I was very proud of the Stanford team
Saturday. I thought they played the champions like champions. Even
though the Indians did not play their best ball against the Wolverines,
there were at all times 22 men on the Held playing the best game they
could for 00 minutes. I think that Stanford';, prime trouble was that they
were trying too hard—that they froze up, or maybe they just had a "bad
one" under their belts that had to be worked out.
As it is now, I can only say "Hail to the victor valiant." The Michigan
eleven, 1 think, is a credit to the game of football. They are national
champions, on and oil the field. They play hard, rugged, and on the
whole, clean football. 1 hope Stanford continues to play them for years
to come, and Michigan—l think —will not meet a better opponent (as lar
as what I feel is the best in football) than they met last Saturday in l.he
Stanford Stadium.
Favored Bruins May Carry Big Slick
But enough ol post mortems. The Redshirts play wliat I honestly think
is the most important game on their schedule next Saturday. It seems odd
that a cheerful chap like myself who happily predicted the Cards 14
points over mighty Michigan is, the next week, very worried about
UCLA.—a school often referred to as "the poor man's San Jose State."
I don't know exactly how or when it happened, but Red Saunders has
put together a mighty fine football team down South. A team that is
now rated lHth in the nation, seven teams over Stanford and third on
the Coast. The Bruins are undefeated alter three games with good but not
great competition. OSC was a picnic, but the next week they beat a pretty
good Utah team. lowa was a strong favorite, but was made to fumble
the game away. Oregon was thought by some to be the Coast's top team,
but was lucky to get lour touehowns to the Bj uins' live. In short, the
University of California at Los Angeles is a pretty deadly football team,
even though we can't figure out how or why.
If they have just been lucky, the luck has been of the consistent kind
which often wins championships.
It appeared in early season that the Bruins were to consist of two guards,
a center, and Ernie Johnson, with the big question being "What happen;
when Johnson get tired?" The answer to this quizzer was eloquently sup
plied last week against Oregon. Ernie Johnson just doesn't get tired. lie.
and the rest oi' the team, are in good—almost miraculous—physical con
dition. This is one oi the primary reasons that the depthless Bruins are
as yet undefeated; why, they think that they are going to remain unde
feated.
Uelans Now Wear 17 Bears' Shoes
Another important wheel on the Bruin victory wagon is that the Uelans
are in the same spot that California was in 1047. The team, the students,
and various assorted alumni turned like sun-blinded rattlesnakes upon
their coach after last season. They tried to push all of the blame for
their disastrous year onto the tired shoulders of Bert Laßrucherie, and
claim that they—the players—had nothing to do with losing ball games.
This year those same players are on the spot: if they lose games they
were wrong about Bert—they are traitors to their coach. I they win, they
are heroes. The men of the Westwood WPA project have more than the
normal incentive this year. They have got to win.
Another thing—and to football experts (of which I am not) this is really
amazing—is that the Saundlotters have seemingly been unable to make the
difficult transition from the "T" to the single wing without contracting ihe
dreaded disease known as "fumbleitis." The Bruins have played "drop
the ball" only with the Beavers, and even then they got OCS to fumble
more than they.
It all boils down to the fact that the Southern Branch has got more
this year than just the one man war, Ernie Johnson, who the Stanford
scout tells me is "one ol the best running backs in collegiate football."
They have got a t-e-a-m. And one that has not been.beaten to date.
But don't get the idea that I'm sitting on the wrong bench for this one.
I can't picture the likes of Castagnoli, Rau, White, Hugasian, Mitchell.
Rye, and friends, losing to the likes of anything less than Michigan. UCLA,
as the man said, just ain't Michigan. But they are a touch, and
highly spirited ball club, and it is going to take the Indians' best effort.-;
to beat them.
The game might have to go extra innings; the Cards might have to
score six times to gain a one-touchdown victory; they may have to kick
field goals from 90 yards out. But the Cardinals can and will beat the
Southern Branch Saturday, and I think they are going to have fun doing it.

The game might have to go extra innings; the Cards might have to
score six times to gain a one-touchdown victory; they may have to kick
field goals from 90 yards out. But the Cardinals can and will beat the
Southern Branch Saturday, and I think they are going to have fun doing it.
Tliat lonely-looking fellow sitting ;it tlie end ol the bench, amidst the
crunched paper cups and torn Michigan programs, is me. Well, blazes, 1
only missed the final score by a mere 34 points, a thing like that could
happen to anybody. Besides, J4 from 100 is 06 times 10 equals 600 And
what's the matter with 600 as a batting average?
It wasn't that the Wolverines had a more experienced team t.'ian Stan
ford, but I think that it is somewhat gay to note that their team captain,
tackle Al Wistert, was playing high school football when Stanford end
Bill McColl was horn.
But seriously, for a moment, I was very proud of the Stanford team
Saturday. I thought they played the champions like champions. Even
though the Indians did not play their best ball against the Wolverines,
there were at all times 22 men on the Held playing the best game they
could for 00 minutes. I think that Stanford';, prime trouble was that they
were trying too hard—that they froze up, or maybe they just had a "bad
one" under their belts that had to be worked out.
As it is now, I can only say "Hail to the victor valiant." The Michigan
eleven, 1 think, is a credit to the game of football. They are national
champions, on and oil the field. They play hard, rugged, and on the
whole, clean football. 1 hope Stanford continues to play them for years
to come, and Michigan—l think —will not meet a better opponent (as lar
as what I feel is the best in football) than they met last Saturday in l.he
Stanford Stadium.
Favored Bruins May Carry Big Slick
But enough ol post mortems. The Redshirts play wliat I honestly think
is the most important game on their schedule next Saturday. It seems odd
that a cheerful chap like myself who happily predicted the Cards 14
points over mighty Michigan is, the next week, very worried about
UCLA.—a school often referred to as "the poor man's San Jose State."
I don't know exactly how or when it happened, but Red Saunders has
put together a mighty fine football team down South. A team that is
now rated lHth in the nation, seven teams over Stanford and third on
the Coast. The Bruins are undefeated alter three games with good but not
great competition. OSC was a picnic, but the next week they beat a pretty
good Utah team. lowa was a strong favorite, but was made to fumble
the game away. Oregon was thought by some to be the Coast's top team,
but was lucky to get lour touehowns to the Bj uins' live. In short, the
University of California at Los Angeles is a pretty deadly football team,
even though we can't figure out how or why.
If they have just been lucky, the luck has been of the consistent kind
which often wins championships.
It appeared in early season that the Bruins were to consist of two guards,
a center, and Ernie Johnson, with the big question being "What happen;
when Johnson get tired?" The answer to this quizzer was eloquently sup
plied last week against Oregon. Ernie Johnson just doesn't get tired. lie.
and the rest oi' the team, are in good—almost miraculous—physical con
dition. This is one oi the primary reasons that the depthless Bruins are
as yet undefeated; why, they think that they are going to remain unde
feated.
Uelans Now Wear 17 Bears' Shoes
Another important wheel on the Bruin victory wagon is that the Uelans
are in the same spot that California was in 1047. The team, the students,
and various assorted alumni turned like sun-blinded rattlesnakes upon
their coach after last season. They tried to push all of the blame for
their disastrous year onto the tired shoulders of Bert Laßrucherie, and
claim that they—the players—had nothing to do with losing ball games.
This year those same players are on the spot: if they lose games they
were wrong about Bert—they are traitors to their coach. I they win, they
are heroes. The men of the Westwood WPA project have more than the
normal incentive this year. They have got to win.
Another thing—and to football experts (of which I am not) this is really
amazing—is that the Saundlotters have seemingly been unable to make the
difficult transition from the "T" to the single wing without contracting ihe
dreaded disease known as "fumbleitis." The Bruins have played "drop
the ball" only with the Beavers, and even then they got OCS to fumble
more than they.
It all boils down to the fact that the Southern Branch has got more
this year than just the one man war, Ernie Johnson, who the Stanford
scout tells me is "one ol the best running backs in collegiate football."
They have got a t-e-a-m. And one that has not been.beaten to date.
But don't get the idea that I'm sitting on the wrong bench for this one.
I can't picture the likes of Castagnoli, Rau, White, Hugasian, Mitchell.
Rye, and friends, losing to the likes of anything less than Michigan. UCLA,
as the man said, just ain't Michigan. But they are a touch, and
highly spirited ball club, and it is going to take the Indians' best effort.-;
to beat them.

I can't picture the likes of Castagnoli, Rau, White, Hugasian, Mitchell.
Rye, and friends, losing to the likes of anything less than Michigan. UCLA,
as the man said, just ain't Michigan. But they are a touch, and
highly spirited ball club, and it is going to take the Indians' best effort.-;
to beat them.
The game might have to go extra innings; the Cards might have to
score six times to gain a one-touchdown victory; they may have to kick
field goals from 90 yards out. But the Cardinals can and will beat the
Southern Branch Saturday, and I think they are going to have fun doing it.
Tliat lonely-looking fellow sitting ;it tlie end ol the bench, amidst the
crunched paper cups and torn Michigan programs, is me. Well, blazes, 1
only missed the final score by a mere 34 points, a thing like that could
happen to anybody. Besides, J4 from 100 is 06 times 10 equals 600 And
what's the matter with 600 as a batting average?
It wasn't that the Wolverines had a more experienced team t.'ian Stan
ford, but I think that it is somewhat gay to note that their team captain,
tackle Al Wistert, was playing high school football when Stanford end
Bill McColl was horn.
But seriously, for a moment, I was very proud of the Stanford team
Saturday. I thought they played the champions like champions. Even
though the Indians did not play their best ball against the Wolverines,
there were at all times 22 men on the Held playing the best game they
could for 00 minutes. I think that Stanford';, prime trouble was that they
were trying too hard—that they froze up, or maybe they just had a "bad
one" under their belts that had to be worked out.
As it is now, I can only say "Hail to the victor valiant." The Michigan
eleven, 1 think, is a credit to the game of football. They are national
champions, on and oil the field. They play hard, rugged, and on the
whole, clean football. 1 hope Stanford continues to play them for years
to come, and Michigan—l think —will not meet a better opponent (as lar
as what I feel is the best in football) than they met last Saturday in l.he
Stanford Stadium.
Favored Bruins May Carry Big Slick
But enough ol post mortems. The Redshirts play wliat I honestly think
is the most important game on their schedule next Saturday. It seems odd
that a cheerful chap like myself who happily predicted the Cards 14
points over mighty Michigan is, the next week, very worried about
UCLA.—a school often referred to as "the poor man's San Jose State."
I don't know exactly how or when it happened, but Red Saunders has
put together a mighty fine football team down South. A team that is
now rated lHth in the nation, seven teams over Stanford and third on
the Coast. The Bruins are undefeated alter three games with good but not
great competition. OSC was a picnic, but the next week they beat a pretty
good Utah team. lowa was a strong favorite, but was made to fumble
the game away. Oregon was thought by some to be the Coast's top team,
but was lucky to get lour touehowns to the Bj uins' live. In short, the
University of California at Los Angeles is a pretty deadly football team,
even though we can't figure out how or why.
If they have just been lucky, the luck has been of the consistent kind
which often wins championships.
It appeared in early season that the Bruins were to consist of two guards,
a center, and Ernie Johnson, with the big question being "What happen;
when Johnson get tired?" The answer to this quizzer was eloquently sup
plied last week against Oregon. Ernie Johnson just doesn't get tired. lie.
and the rest oi' the team, are in good—almost miraculous—physical con
dition. This is one oi the primary reasons that the depthless Bruins are
as yet undefeated; why, they think that they are going to remain unde
feated.
Uelans Now Wear 17 Bears' Shoes
Another important wheel on the Bruin victory wagon is that the Uelans
are in the same spot that California was in 1047. The team, the students,
and various assorted alumni turned like sun-blinded rattlesnakes upon
their coach after last season. They tried to push all of the blame for
their disastrous year onto the tired shoulders of Bert Laßrucherie, and
claim that they—the players—had nothing to do with losing ball games.
This year those same players are on the spot: if they lose games they
were wrong about Bert—they are traitors to their coach. I they win, they
are heroes. The men of the Westwood WPA project have more than the
normal incentive this year. They have got to win.
Another thing—and to football experts (of which I am not) this is really
amazing—is that the Saundlotters have seemingly been unable to make the
difficult transition from the "T" to the single wing without contracting ihe
dreaded disease known as "fumbleitis." The Bruins have played "drop
the ball" only with the Beavers, and even then they got OCS to fumble
more than they.
It all boils down to the fact that the Southern Branch has got more
this year than just the one man war, Ernie Johnson, who the Stanford
scout tells me is "one ol the best running backs in collegiate football."
