# Michigan Seeks Twenty-sixth Win Against Unbeaten Cadets
## 
### 
' ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 5 li
lt's a battle of winners here Satur
day as Michigan and Army meet in
the number one football game of
ihe weekend grid card.
Michigan, voted the top team in
the land by Associated Press sports
editors, will match its 25-game win
ning streak with a Cadet string that
has extended 13 games without a
defeat.
Long sold out. the Wolverine
stadium will Le jampacked with
fans as Michigan tries for its 2\?th
con ecutive victory to tie the mod
ern collegiate record, established
by Cornell in 1021-21.
Michigan's bid again is built
around one of the best defensive
lines in the business and a handful
of fast and tricky backs operating
from Coach Bonnie Oosterbaan's
single wing attack.
Arnold GalifTa, who quarterbacks
the Army club, is rated a first-class

passer and he has
an unusually fine
receiver in Dan
Foldbei l\ a tall,
fast left end.
When GaliJfa is
n't tossing the ball
the attack is in
the hands of the
fast Cadet hacks,
headed by half
backs Jim Cain
and Frank Fischl.
Hard, deceptive

runners, the two combine with fjll
back Gil Stephenson to make the
Cadet ground game go.
Michigan's Chuck Ortmann can
match passes with the best of them.
But, to date, the Wolverine receiv
ers have not put deadliness in the
Michigan offense.
Hut, despite a slow start with
Michigan's 7-3 victory over Mich
igan State College, the Wolverine
running backs cut loose to wallop
Stanford 27-7 last week.
Ortmann and Leo Koceski handle
the halfback posts with a speed and
shiftiness that dazzled the Indian
defenses. And when they werein't
handling the ball, Don Dufek, Mich
igan's driving fullback, plunged
through the Stanford line. Dick
Kempthorn alternates witii Dufek to
make the Wolverines rock-solid at
the fullback post.
And there's bound to be a battle
of the lines, too. Both teams field
big, tough forward walls.
The game rates pretty much of
a toss-up.

defenses. And when they werein't
handling the ball, Don Dufek, Mich
igan's driving fullback, plunged
through the Stanford line. Dick
Kempthorn alternates witii Dufek to
make the Wolverines rock-solid at
the fullback post.
And there's bound to be a battle
of the lines, too. Both teams field
big, tough forward walls.
The game rates pretty much of
a toss-up.

' ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 5 li
lt's a battle of winners here Satur
day as Michigan and Army meet in
the number one football game of
ihe weekend grid card.
Michigan, voted the top team in
the land by Associated Press sports
editors, will match its 25-game win
ning streak with a Cadet string that
has extended 13 games without a
defeat.
Long sold out. the Wolverine
stadium will Le jampacked with
fans as Michigan tries for its 2\?th
con ecutive victory to tie the mod
ern collegiate record, established
by Cornell in 1021-21.
Michigan's bid again is built
around one of the best defensive
lines in the business and a handful
of fast and tricky backs operating
from Coach Bonnie Oosterbaan's
single wing attack.
Arnold GalifTa, who quarterbacks
the Army club, is rated a first-class

passer and he has
an unusually fine
receiver in Dan
Foldbei l\ a tall,
fast left end.
When GaliJfa is
n't tossing the ball
the attack is in
the hands of the
fast Cadet hacks,
headed by half
backs Jim Cain
and Frank Fischl.
Hard, deceptive

runners, the two combine with fjll
back Gil Stephenson to make the
Cadet ground game go.
Michigan's Chuck Ortmann can
match passes with the best of them.
But, to date, the Wolverine receiv
ers have not put deadliness in the
Michigan offense.
Hut, despite a slow start with
Michigan's 7-3 victory over Mich
igan State College, the Wolverine
running backs cut loose to wallop
Stanford 27-7 last week.
Ortmann and Leo Koceski handle
the halfback posts with a speed and
shiftiness that dazzled the Indian
defenses. And when they werein't
handling the ball, Don Dufek, Mich
igan's driving fullback, plunged
through the Stanford line. Dick
Kempthorn alternates witii Dufek to
make the Wolverines rock-solid at
the fullback post.
