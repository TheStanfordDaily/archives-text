LOS ANGELES—Jim Powers will
open at quarterback and Bill Martin
at fullback when the University of
Southern California lakes the field
here Saturday against Ohio State.
That seemed certain today, but
Coach Jeff Cravath was undecided
about the halfback positions.
Art Battle seemed assured of the
right halfback spot when Jay
Koundy suffered a shoulder injury
in scrimmage against the junior
varsity today.
Today's practice emphasized pass
defense.
