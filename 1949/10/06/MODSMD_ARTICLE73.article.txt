lOWA CITY, la. —Coach Eddie
Anderson said today it now seems
he will have to send his lowa foot
ball team against Illinois here Sat
urday minus three regulars.
Both starting guards. Earl Banks
and Bob Lage, are on the extremely
doubtful list. Quarterback Glenn
Drahn may be ready but only for
limited offensive duty.
