# Cleveland Visits Albertland For Biggest AAC Grid Clash
## 
### 
The big. bad Browns from Cleve- ,
land move into Kezar Stadium Sun- ;
i day to face Frankie Albert & Co. I
in a tilt that may well decide the j
' of-the All-American -C<>n
i ference and the success of the '49ers
1949 campaign. Diminutive Frankie
i and his cohorts recovered remark- j
• ably from their Buffalo defeat with j
| a resounding 42-24 thumping of a j
surprising Chicago eleven.
But it will take much more effort !
| and the unpredictable signal calling |
i of Albert at his best to whip the |
league champs. The Cleveland I
I steamrollers have Albert's equal in '
Otto Graham at quarter. Edgar j
i "Special Delivery" Jones and Tu
lane's Dub Jones swivel-hip at the '
halves. And the crashing power j
down the middle is supplied by ■
burly Marion Motley. The anks
and pass-nabbing chores are ban- j
died expertly by Dante Lavelli and 1
Mac Speedie. The line is rock solid j
and deep. The team, in fact, is al- j
most ihe same unit that has copped |
i the AAC flag for three years
] straight.
The San Francisco aggregation, on 1
the other hand, has been injury- j
ridden for the past weeks. Their [
defense was not sharp against Chi- [
cago and Albert couldn't get sufTi- (
cicnt pass protection in Buffalo. The j
only way they can replace the j
Browns is by whipping them on j
their own. This they have yet to ac- j
j complish. With a healthy Eddie 1
Carr on pass defense, Joe Perry in- j
j tact at full, and a rejuvenated Norm j
Standlee storming all over the j
place, the Bay boys have a strong j
chance. But some doubt still re- !
mains whether starting tackle Bob .
Bryant will be able to play.
The two clubs dominate the AAC !
statistics in rushing, passing, and ;

scoring. In other words, the contest j
figures to be a high-scoring affair.
But Uie forward walls are almost as
stingv as the backs are greedy.
Small wonder Uie park lias been
sold out for weeks.—G.J.
