# Grant Praised as 'War Bride'
## 
### 
Many arts and many artists have
become extinct in Hollywood. Like
the La Brea tar pits which hold the
J bones ot' prehistoric reptiles, major
| studios contain the slightly less de
cayed bones of artists who have for-
I gotten they ever had ability after
years of type casting.
So this review may turn out to
be six inches of praise for Cary
: Grant. Twenty pounds underweight,

. tired, and ill from
" yellow jaundice
. while making the
* picture, Cary has
: still retained a
sense of comedy
timing that turns
/"I Was a Male
t War Bride" into
1 the funniest pic
; ture of the fiscal
year.

Theater, has been used in Holly
wood since Clara Bow wore tights.
The film resembles an Army ob
stacle course with Ann Sheridan as
first prize when the final hurdle is
e'eared. Before landing safely in a
locked stateroom with his delectable
bride, Grant lands successively in a
vat of blue dye, a German jail, and
the clothes of an Army nurse.
Howard Hawks has pasted these
ancient chestnuts on the fresh
background of post-war Germany,
painted them with spicy, sexy, and
downrighty funny lines, and turned
out a picture that is somewhere
near a comic work of art.
The most suggestive lines in a
Hollywood film since the Hays of
fice arc abetted and interpreted by
Grant, whose voice inflection can
turn a simple statement into a bed
room scene.

Ann Sheridan matches Grant ex
pression for expression, double take
for double take, and doesn't come off
second best. Watch her during the
last scene in the liner's stateroom.
The acting jackpot is hit by every
member of the cast down to the
German taxicab driver and police
man who gesticulate unintelligibly
in the first scene.
One word of warning. Prepare to
sit through the picture twice. The
audience will be laughing so loudly
at the dirty jokes, you won't be able
to catch them the first time.â€”Aljean
