# A 						Stanford Man, Through and Through

### 
Dr. Wallace Sterling, Stanford's fifth presi
dent, officially takes over his new duties today.
In a colorful inaugural ceremony to be held
in the Laurence Frost Amphitheater this after
noon, the popular 43-year-old educator will ac
cept the heavy responsibilities that go with
the presidency of a major university.
Dr. Sterling takes over during one of the
most critical periods in Stanford's 58-year his
tory. A large enrollment, swollen by a heavy
postwar influx of veterans, still taxes Univer
sity facilities almost to the breaking point;
many campus roads and buildings are badly
in need of repair; housing is far from ade
quate; the termination of the GI Bill requires
that additional funds be put into scholarships
and grants-in-aid; faculty and staff members
are generally underpaid as compared to other
institutions of similar size and academic stand
ing; the athletic budget is too small to support N

a first-class athletic program.
Income, on the other hand, is inadequate to
meet all these needs. Assigning priority to
these various projects and dividing up avail
able funds between them is just one of the
many tasks that face Stanford's new president.
Dr. Wallace Sterling returns to Stanford with
the highest possible recommendations. A rec
ognized scholar, President Sterling also has
an outstanding administrative record. He is a
Stanford man through and through, friendly,
well liked by all who know him.
We have been impressed by the extreme
interest and enthusiasm that he has shown for
student affairs, particularly athletics.
It is a pleasure for us to welcome Dr. Wal
lace Sterling as Stanford's fifth president. The
Board of Trustees could not have picked a bet
ter man. With Dr. Sterling as its president,
Stanford can do nothing but move ahead.
