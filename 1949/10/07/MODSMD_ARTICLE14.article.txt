# On Living Dangerously

### 
It's the little annoyances that make life most
unpleasant, which brings us to those motor
scooters and motorcycles which have turned
the area between the Art Gallery and Cubber
ley Auditorium on Lasuen Street into a minor
race track.
There's an old ordinance which prohibits the
riding of such vehicles on any part of the Quad
which is closed to automobiles. The $2.50 fine
for doing such doesn't seem to be stopping the
speedsters; so we'd like to appeal to their hu
manitarianism.
Getting to an 8 o'clock fall guarter is not too

pleasant at best, and when one has to run an
obstacle course to boot, it's enough incentive
to stay in bed.
As a summer Daily editorial poinied out, the
whirling helicopter of 1960 will make pikers
out of these motor scooters. But we still think
they might show a little courtesy for the rest
of the student body, and keep out of the Quad
area.
At any cost, these two • wheeled demons
have got to go—student life is not yet expend
able.—M. K.
