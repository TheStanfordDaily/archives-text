# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
It's Friday again and time to talk football. No more
picks against Michigan, you understand, but just
clean-cut Conference talk.
UCLA, the school from the Southland, the alma

mater of Jane Russell, and the
<,nly local rival to Beverly Hills
High, switched coaches last sea
son and came up with a football
team.
The Bruins play single-wing
football. That's the same system
Michigan used. That's also the
same system Harvard used. It's
amazing wh;it can happen to a
system ifi the period of two
weeks.
But thut's neither here nor

there, UCf A will be plenty tough tomorrow. So it
will be important for the rooting section to get
behind the ballclub and cheer.
Cheer. That's a good word. You can find it almost
everywhere. But this is rooting section cheer. That
means football yells.
There are all kinds of football yells, such as ,
How do you like your oysters—raw-raw-raw.
Or City College, City College—the institute of
health and knowledge—chess, checkers, and shuffle

board.
Or, Eenie-meenie-minie-moe, watch Ernie Johnson
go!
Or, never mind, this could go on forever. But
what I'm trying to say is, the rooting section really
is an important part of the football game. Stanford
sections have always been tops in their field.
And Stanford has a yell which is IT in root-root
circles. The only trouble with the yell is that we
never use it. Except for once a year when everybody
has halfway forgotten it and somebody always savs
NECK when he should have said AXE.
Tomorrow, 3,000 people with UCLA ID cards, al
most 40 more Bruin football players, and the Greater
Bruin Band v/ill be on hand to flash their stuff.
Their stuff would look like nothing if Stanford de
cided to GIVE 'EM THE AXE Last year the
Cards hadn't beaten UCLA since 1841. They gave
'em the axe down in the Memorial Coliseum and
the final score ended up 34-14, Stanford winning.
Anyway, like I said before the Michigan game,
the axe-yell could have helped a let.
And for tomorrow, it still goes. I for one, will be
glad to offer lung and larynx if the Borba-boys ask
for it.
Yeah, give 'em the axe. ,
