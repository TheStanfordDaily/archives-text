To the Editor:
I heard Dr. Brandt's speech Tuesday evening, and
let's agree that Dr. Brandt is a German at heart
and thus speaks in favor of his fatherland. That's
one thing. But why are Americans always ready
to feel sorry for the Germans and excuse their "mis
takes" and help them to start a new powerful state?
Is it really so awful that one-half of the Germans
are slaves in Russia—have you tried to live in a
country occupied by the Germans during the war,
with deportation, starvation, concentration camps,
and death awaiting around each corner for thousands
of innocent people who never thought of insulting
or attacking anyone else?
Why is it so awful that half of the Germans are
under Russian rule—what about Poland, Estonia,
Latvia. Is i( such a wonder that England wants to
help her own economy instead of that of Germany
when Germany is the main reason why England and
the English people are so poor today?

Let us .--top feeling sorry lor, or admiring, the
German people. It was not only the Nazis. There
were not live out of each hundred Germans who
did not know what "Lefcensraum" meant to Hitler,
or who thought that the enormous German army
and navy were only for use in impressive military '
shows. Few were the Germans who did not spit on ,
the Jews in the street, and no one forgot to cheer j
over the big German victories in the beginning of
the war. How many Germans were ashamed when
Germany attacked the small, peaceful states sur
rounding her, without reason, in spite of the fact
that a short time before non-aggression pacts had
been signed?
How many of you believe that these Germans,
who comt; nt ly have been the cause of our European
wars, who did not keep their own promises, who
killed and tortured as much as possible, who did not
consider human life, who lied and stole, that these
Germans in six or seven years can be changed to
pcacel'ul, honest, pious, morally sound and reliable
people? GUDRUN GYTEL
