# Washington Card Stunts Backfire
## 
### 
The University of Washington
Rally Com pulled the prize boot of
the week last Saturday when the
Huskies met the Fighting Irish in
Seattle.
Gazing at the half-time Washing
! ton card stunts, spectators were
I amazed to lind the rooters come
up with a big purple "M" against
i a gold field.
They couldn't understand what an

"M" had to do either with the Uni
versity of Washington oi Nolle
Dame,
Biftecn stunts later they could
answer their own question.
It seems lJally Com had given
row No. 1 cards that row No. 60
â€¢ hould've had and so on up the
line. As a result every stunt was
turned upside down, to the complete
joy of the few loyal Notre Darners
present.
