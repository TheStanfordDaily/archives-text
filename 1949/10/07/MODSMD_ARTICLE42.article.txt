# Brooks Throttle Yanks 1-0; Preacher Hurls Six-Hitter
## 
### 
| YANKEE STADIUM, NEW YORK, Oct 6 (AP)—Elwin (Preacher)
Roe, a slight, studious southpaw from Arkansas, gave a magnifi
cent performance under wracking pressure in the late innings
today to throttle the Yankees, 1 to 0, and pull his Brooklyn Dodg
ers pven with the New Yorkers in the 1949 World Series at one
game each.
A crowd of 70,053 packed into the Yankee park witnessed a

second, throbbing mound duel, this >
time between Roe and Vie Ra.schi,
the Yankees' big 21-game winner.
And for the second day they saw
the decision hinge on a single run.
Jackie Robinson, the Dodgers'
scampering Negro second baseman,
crossed the plate with the big one
of! Raschi on a single into left field
by Gil Hodges in the sf eond inning
after Jackie had doubled and raced
tu third on a pop foul.
TROUBLE IN B'ill AM) 9TII
Pitching his way out of trouble
in the eighth and ninth I mines with
a cool and gritty exhil ition, Roe be
came the first Brooklyn hurler to i
hang up a 1 to 0 victory this season.
He also became the first lefthander j
to blank the Yankees this year.
Never before have two games been j

won by 1 to 0 scores in a series,
much less two in succession by that
formula. As to the two fighting out
fits go into the third contest tomor
row in the Dodgers' home park,
Ebbets Fieid, they appear more
evenly matched than identical twins,
and it's anybody's World Champion
ship.
Roe, a 31-year-old veteran with a
tremendous assortment of curves
but very little speed, gave fully as
impressive a performance as his
huge stablemate, Don Newcombe,
did in his heartbreaking loser yes
terday.
The Yanks nudged the cool
Preacher lor six hits, two of them
in the eighth and ninth frames, but
only once during the tense duel did
the American League champions
push a man to third. Not until the
eighth inning did they ever have
two runners on base at the same
time.
lIENRICn POPS UP
In the eighth, after his own error
on a sa; rifice bunt by Phil Rizzuto
had puts Yanks on first and second
with one out, Preacher forced Tom
my Ilenrich, hero of the opening
game, to pop weakly to left field
and stopped Hank Bauer on an in
field roller.
When Joe DiMageio opened the
ninth with his first hit of the Series,
a slow roller which third baseman
Spider Jorgensen couldn't handle in
time, the predominantly Yankee
crowd raised a ruckus and told
themselves excitedly that the Bomb
ers were going to pull it out in
the ninth again.
But they didn't reckon with the
Preacher. Johnny Lindell went
down swinging at a sweeping curve
—Roe's third strikeout of the day—
Billy John: on sent up a weak pop
which Robinson gobbled, and Gerry
Coleman lofted to right for the
game-ending out.

| YANKEE STADIUM, NEW YORK, Oct 6 (AP)—Elwin (Preacher)
Roe, a slight, studious southpaw from Arkansas, gave a magnifi
cent performance under wracking pressure in the late innings
today to throttle the Yankees, 1 to 0, and pull his Brooklyn Dodg
ers pven with the New Yorkers in the 1949 World Series at one
game each.
A crowd of 70,053 packed into the Yankee park witnessed a

second, throbbing mound duel, this >
time between Roe and Vie Ra.schi,
the Yankees' big 21-game winner.
And for the second day they saw
the decision hinge on a single run.
Jackie Robinson, the Dodgers'
scampering Negro second baseman,
crossed the plate with the big one
of! Raschi on a single into left field
by Gil Hodges in the sf eond inning
after Jackie had doubled and raced
tu third on a pop foul.
TROUBLE IN B'ill AM) 9TII
Pitching his way out of trouble
in the eighth and ninth I mines with
a cool and gritty exhil ition, Roe be
came the first Brooklyn hurler to i
hang up a 1 to 0 victory this season.
He also became the first lefthander j
to blank the Yankees this year.
Never before have two games been j

won by 1 to 0 scores in a series,
much less two in succession by that
formula. As to the two fighting out
fits go into the third contest tomor
row in the Dodgers' home park,
Ebbets Fieid, they appear more
evenly matched than identical twins,
and it's anybody's World Champion
ship.
Roe, a 31-year-old veteran with a
tremendous assortment of curves
but very little speed, gave fully as
impressive a performance as his
huge stablemate, Don Newcombe,
did in his heartbreaking loser yes
terday.
The Yanks nudged the cool
Preacher lor six hits, two of them
in the eighth and ninth frames, but
only once during the tense duel did
the American League champions
push a man to third. Not until the
eighth inning did they ever have
two runners on base at the same
time.
lIENRICn POPS UP
In the eighth, after his own error
on a sa; rifice bunt by Phil Rizzuto
had puts Yanks on first and second
with one out, Preacher forced Tom
my Ilenrich, hero of the opening
game, to pop weakly to left field
and stopped Hank Bauer on an in
field roller.
When Joe DiMageio opened the
ninth with his first hit of the Series,
a slow roller which third baseman
Spider Jorgensen couldn't handle in
time, the predominantly Yankee
crowd raised a ruckus and told
themselves excitedly that the Bomb
ers were going to pull it out in
the ninth again.
But they didn't reckon with the
Preacher. Johnny Lindell went
down swinging at a sweeping curve
—Roe's third strikeout of the day—
Billy John: on sent up a weak pop
which Robinson gobbled, and Gerry
Coleman lofted to right for the
game-ending out.
