Still untried by an intercollegiate
i opponent, the Stanford freshman
eleven takes the field against a
Santa Clara freshman squad tomor
row morning at 11:30.
Serving as a preliminary for the
] Bruin-Indian program in the Sta-
I dium, the clash shapes "up as a good
measuring-stick for both universi
ties' latest gridiron nuggets. It will
j be the season open for the Broncos,
! junior si7.e, while the Cardbabes
| have seen action only against the lo
cal jayvees, winning easily. 27-13.
Ihe game will mark the renewal
of frosh rivalry between the two
I schools after a year's lapse. In 1947,
j the last encounter, Boyd Benson
I took a Tom Shaw pass in the final
j play of the day, and raced 96 yards
j for a touchdown. Final score was
j u—o with the '51 Papooses on top.
The latest Bronco outfit features
| the qunrterbacking of Eugene Paoa,
I another Hawaiian star from St. Louis
j High. Sparkplugs on the line are
: Gem Nagler, former all-Northern
I Cal from Marysville, at end and Dale
I Sterling, brother of varsity king
! Vern, at tackle.
Only change in the Papoose lineup
| lor the game will be at guard. Al
i Hanner replaces Tom Romano at
I this spot.
j Latest infirmary news was that
! Jim Cairns will return to workouts
j on Monday, if he secures the doc
tor's final okay. Jim was looking
j very good at the halfback spot be
fore he dislocated a disc in his back.
"We're ready,'' was all Coach
Taylor had to say about his pros
pect's chances of maintaining a per
fect slate.
