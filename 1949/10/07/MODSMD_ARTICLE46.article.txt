# MEET THE BRUINS
## Sanders Moans But Westwooders Boast Experienced Aggregation 
### AL BERRY 
Joe Bruin, happy pride of the great southland, is paying his glorious respects to the Farm to
morrow, with all intentions of being a most impolite guest. Whether or not the Uclan calling
card is gilt-edged or guilt-edged is a thing that remains to be seen, but all indications at this
point shew the visitors to be a pretty deadly aggregation of athletes.
All through the pre-season period Coach Red Sanders carefully jockeyed himself into an un-

! derdog role by pitiful claims of a ;
material shortage amongst the 15,-
GOO-man (and gurl) student body, i
< His tears were taken so seriously, j
that even today after UCLA's romps
over Oregon State (35-13), lowa (41-
25), and '48 Coast co-champion Ore
gon (35-27), the sports world is j
1 having difficulty believing that Joe j
is, indeed, one of the Coast's mighti
est Rose Bowl contenders.
But Rose Bowl contenders they
are, and there are good reasons for j
it. The Southern Branch's first {
eleven may be second to none on
i the Coast, but if so, they are just ;
' barely in that lamentable condi- i
! tion.
SQUAD BY POSITIONS
Halfbacks—Leading the southern
parade is one of the best running
: backs in the country and one of the
top five in Bruin history. He comes
j in a 168-pound package called Er- ;
nie Johnson. There is little use in j
! elaborating on the many published i
| accomplishments of Mr. Johnson, i
who does everything his northern i
brother, J. Jensen, did—only faster. I
On the right halfback side of the i
j field stands 177 pounds of Howard
Hansen, who leads the Bruin backs :
! in average yards gained. Out of 26
! tries in the first three games, Han- j
son has averaged nearly eight yards 1
per carry. He is not a strong passer,
S but is second only to Johnson in
I punt returns.

Quarterback —The qb job in the
Sanders single wing does not pass, j
i rarely runs, and does not call sin- !
; gles. He is what used to be known
j as the blocking back. On the UCLA
I roster he comes in the form of 193- 1
pound Jim Buchanan, a transfer
, from Los Angeles City College.
Buchanan is also the Bruin's best j
line-backer, and is a guy who likes ;
1 to play "rough" football, for which
he may be penalized Saturday.
Fullback—At the full spot are two
i excellent Southland gentlemen!
named Braly and Schroeder. Of the
! two, Cliff Schroeder will probably
get the starting nod. The 192-
pounder, who has made a miracu- j
lous switch from the T-formation
quarterback spot. TeatTs the Bruins
with 30 points scored in the last ;
three games. He also has a .400 j
• „ !
i passing average.
Ends—At left end for the Bruins
i is 199-pound, 6-foot 3-inch Bob
Wilkinson, who really shone in the
| lowa game, catching five passes for
, 132 yards and two touchdowns. He
; is tied with Ernie Johnson for sec
! ond-place scorer so far this season
with a total of 24 points. Wilkinson
I is unuestionably one of the niftier
I ends on the Coast.
On the other side of the line are
Don Cogswell and Malcolm Ellis,
i who alternate about evenly. Cogs
i well is a fine offensive end with a
so-far record of five catches. Ellis

plays mo stly dei-ense.
Tackles — The tackle spot shows
the return of UCLA's 25 lettermen,
215-pound George Pastre and 23 2-
pound Harry Thompson. Both men
are big and fast. This is one of the
strong spots on the Bruin eleven.
Guards—The center of the UCLA
line was rated in Ihe pre-season
sports pages as being rock-like.
Coach Sanders has not been disap
pointed in them. Both Johnny Nik
cevich (15)7) and Eddy Eaton (189).
are candidates for all-Coast honors.
Johnny, who hails from Wilmington,
California, has three years of varsity
football under his belt, has gone to
the Rose Bowl with the team in
1f)46, and played considerable ball
in the '47 and '48 campaigns. Eaton
who is UCLA's star heavyweight
wrestler, played 375 minutes of ball


ERNIE JOHNSON (left) and RAY NAGEL are t wo of UCLa s veteran backs who will perform
in Stanford's Stadium tomorrow. Johnson's mo st effective play is an optional pass-run effort off
Sanders' single wing attack. Ray Nagel, who was first string last year, is now playing behind
Johnson. He has pitched two touchdown passes in three attempts to date.
