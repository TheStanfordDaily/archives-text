# Win-Hungry Jayvees Look For Victory Over Davis JC
## 
### 
This Saturday the chagrined jun- i
ior varsity football team will journey j
to Davis JC near Sacramento to at- !
tempt to prove that last weekend's i
afl'air with the upstart helmet forces
of '53 was just a fluke.
"I wish we could meet the frosh j
again in ii couple of weeks," said j
Coach Jim Cox. "I doubt if they
would even score on us."
That's right. Cox thinks he has a |
ball club and furthermore it is al- j
most the same team which went ;
through the debacle last Saturday.
New faces include Ed Taylor, who j
has moved into the left tackle spot
and Dave Worley, a converted cen
ter, now playing right guard.
Bill Eddy will take over the full
backing chore. 1 and Bob Latham will
start as defensive tackle.
"Our biggest difficulty to date," 1
declared the young and rangy coach,
"is that we have had to spend all
our time running off UCLA and ;
other varsity opponents' plays. We
had only two days of good prac- •
tice this week."
Of course dummying plays against
the varsity doesn't make for much
team cohesion and slows down the |
esrentril conditioning process.
As with most JC outfits, nothing
much is known about Davis, but
Coach Cox is sure llis JV's can han
dle anything the Sacramento outlh
will show.
