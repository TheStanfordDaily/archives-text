BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE helps make up the fine Card end
squad. Formerly a fullback at Menlo Junior College, Van Al
styne was sidelined with a leg injury last year and did not play
at all. He took up his football duties at the end post last spring.
Bruce is used primarily on defense now that A 1 Laakso is in
jured but he is a fine pass catcher. Van Alstyne is 22 years
old, weighs 295, and is six feet three inches tall.
