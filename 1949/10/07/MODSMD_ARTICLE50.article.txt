# Stanford Water Poloists Take On UCLA Tomorrow
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Stanford's varsity water poloists,
J defending co-champions of the PCC,
I will receive a stiff test tomorrow
morning when they square off with
i a potentially powerful but as yet
: untested UCLA squad at Encina
j Pool.
ine rough and tough contest is
slated to begin at 10 a.m., and ad
| mission is free.
The Card team received a serious
J blow yesterday when it was learned
that scoring ace Fritz Maurer would
be ineligible for the season.
VVYCOFF SPRINTER
Stepping up to take Maurcr's po
sition at forward is the sophomore
speedster, Bob Wycoff, who will
I sprint for the locals.
Bob Frojan, a star from Fullerton
! Junior College, will start at guard
[ for the Indians, while Don Weeden
| will be shifted from guard to for
| ward. Otherwise, the Indians will
j start with the same lineup that
shared the confercnce crown with
the Trojans last year.
The Bruins have a completely re
vitalized club with the addition of
Don Smith and Monte Nitzovvski,
both of whom played on the Na
tional AAU water polo team.
TOUGH GAME
No one knows exactly how strong
1 the Bruins are, but Stanford mentor
j Tom Haynie predicts a tough game
I tomorrow for the Cards. Last year's
! team, which only lost one Confer -
j enee game, easily subdued the
I Bruins twice.
All-Coast guard Ralph Sala and
j Ken Fox will begin with Frojan at
guard, and speedy Hub Stokely will
I get the starting call v/ith YVycofT and
i Weeden at forward.
