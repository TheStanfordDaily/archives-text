# Bad Fingernail Bothered Roe

### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 6 (jF)—Elwiti
(Preacher) Roc, who pitchcd Brook
lyn to victory today with a torn
fingernail, said in the dressing room
after the game he mixed his curve
ball with his fast ball—which isn't
very fast.
Whenever he had any trouble, the
Dodger infield would concentrate at
the mound, mindful of his painful
injury, and how much depended on
keeping Yankee power under re
straint.
"Who did the talking?" Roe was
asked.
''Why," Pec Wee Reese, of course,"
said Roe. "He's a mighty handy
man to have on your team. Besides,
he's the captain."
"Why didn't you get a hit.
Preacher?"
"It was this finger. Who could hit
with this finger?"
Roc gave his alibi solemnly but
the crowd around him laughed be
cause he is a notoriously poor hitter.
He struck out three times today.
A doctor working in the dugout
had to drill a hole in Roe's finger
nail to let out a pocket of blood in
the fifth inning.
In the bottom of the fourth Johnny
Lindell of the Yankees hit a scream
ing drive at Roe. The ball tore off
the top half of the fourth fingernail
of the Preacher's right hand, and
the blood formed under the bottom
half.
Roe dropped the ball but re
covered and threw Lindell out.
"Sure it hurt, but not too much,"
said Roc. "I wanted to go back in
there."
