# Pickers Tab Stanford, Cal, Ducks, Huskies For Wins
## 
### 
The Daily's Peerless Pigskin Pick
ers, staggered only temporarily by
a whimpering .6.17 average in last
week's first prognosticating picnic
of the season, have bounced back
with the resilience of youth this
! week, and fearlessly predicted 15
| more winners in tomorrow's grid
battles.
Michigan, UCLA, Pilt, and the
i Wisconsin-Illinois tie took a healthy
! chip out of the crystal ball last Sat
urday, leaving us with seven hits
to go with the four misses. But
[ those were the games missed by
l nearly every .scribe 011 the Coast; it
was merely a poor clay for crystal
! ball gazing.
Staffman Gil Jonas leads the pack
i after the first week's reckoning with
i a .728 percentage, which means that
I he called one more right on his in
dividual scoresheet than did the con
sensus form-chart.
{ So hang 011 to your pencils (better
i hang on to your bankrolls, too) as
i once again we fiddle with the fickle
finger of fate. The predictions be
low are all consensus picks, the
I average figure of the nine individual
choices:
Stanford-UCLA — The scoreboard
! should get a real workout on this
. one. Both the Cards and Bruins are
strictly offense-minded, and they've
both got that Rose Bowl hankering.
; It's a toughie, but we say Stanford
by six points.

California - Wisconsin — Another
close. Cal misses Golden Boy, but ;
has little Charlie Sarver to take up I
at least some of that offensive sap. [
The Midwesterners, on the other j
hand, have shown a lot of improve-
I ment since the Bears pasted them j
by 40-14 last year. We'll string alone j
with the Waldorf crew, but only by j
7 points.
USC-Ohio State — Another inter-1
sectional honey, another chance for
the West Coast to derail that Big
Ten Express. We're hopin' other- 1
wise, but it's a weak vote for the j
Buckeyes by one.
Oregon-Washington State — The I
hapless Cougars will catch Oregon
on the rebound alter their upset by
UCLA. Too bad. Oregon by 15.
Washing ton-OSC — The Huskies '
have a fine squad but have lx?cn
playing out of their league the last
' two weeks. They'll get a little re
' venge tomorrow: Washington by 10. '
Montana-Colorado A&M—The sari
i part about this one, from the PCC's j
1 viwepoint, is that it'll probably be j
close. Montana by 6.
Michigan-Army — This could put ;
; Russia's atomic bomb to shame. It's
the battle of the giants, but the Wol
| vcrines look taller from out here.
Michigan by 8.
Oklahoma-Texas — The Sooncrs
! rate the nod here, but it's a boau
| tiful spot for an upset. Oklahoma
: by 8.
