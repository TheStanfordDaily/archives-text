# Red Machine to Battle UCLA Before 45,000
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's football Indians,
backed up and bruised by
Michigan's Wolverines, will fi
nally get around to opening !
their conference season tomor- i
row in the Stadium against the |
unbeaten UCLA Bruins.
KickofT time is set for 2:30, with i
a frosh preliminary between Stan- '
ford and Santa Clara scheduled to j
get underway at 11:1.5,
A crowd of 45,000 paying cus- j
tomofs is expected to be on hand J
to watch the Cards try to bounce j
back from their 27-7 Michigan loss
with a victory over the Bruin.
But against the Sanders single
wing, which has won three straight !
(Oregon State, 35-13; lowa. 41-25;
Oregon, 35-27) and which is pres
ently setting the pace in the PCC [
rundown, it might not be so easy.
TO TEST IT! I.I)
The Bruins arrived in town this [
morning on the Southern Pacific I
Lark and will probally test the Sta
dium turf later this afternoon. To
morrow the invading gridders will
be followed by 3,000 rooters and a
band.
The contest will have as much
Rose Bowl scent to it as an early
season clash po.sibly can. With
I Oregon out of the way, the race has
narrowed down to four clubs, USC,
UCLA, Cal, and Stanford. Alter
Saturday, Stanford or UCLA will
be eliminated.
The Indians, although still bot.li
: ered by a handful of injured rogu
-1 lars, should be ready for this one.
I Marehie Schwartz worked the men
j long hours this week on UCLA de
fense, as the defensive unit will draw
the rugged assignment of slopping
I the Bruin ground game which has
' been vicious to date.

The Tribe defense will consist of
Bruce Van Alstync and Jack Rye at j
ends, Jim Castagnoli and Dick Ab- j
raham at line-backers, Wes Poulson J

and Cordon While at tackles, Hart i
Cook and Russ Pomrroy at guards, j
Dave Field and Ken Peek at half- j
backs, and Hairy Iluga.sian at safe-J
i ty.
I! they can stop Ernie Johnson j
. nd Cliff Sthroeder's running and
passing, it's a good bet that the ball- j
| game will be decided right then
j and there.
Fti.nlord's offensive threats (listed'
below in the starting lineup) will be |
the saint- as usual, except that the

injured A 1 Rau may be replaced by
Poulson.
Packing the ball in practice this
week were Emery Mitchell, Bob
White, and Rupc Andrews, and all
three looked as if they meant busi- |
ness.
WHITE It AMBLED
Last season when Stanford upset ,
UCLA 34-14, to win their first con
ference game in two years, it was
mainly Bob White and Emery
Mitchell who supplied the fire
works.
Bob White rambled to three \
touchdowns that day, and he piled j
up 126 yards in 10 tries for 12.(5 per
I carry. A performance like that to- j
i morrow could crack things wide i
j open.
Finery Mitchell, another impor- j
tant cog in last season's victory,
} looks right now to be in top form
i again, although Bill DeYoung will
continue to get the starting nod at
I full Lack.
It has been said that the Bruins
arc not Michigan. But the Bruins
!do play block and tackle football,
and they will be able to give Stan-
I ford all it can handle.
It will be the 20th time the two
I -''boots have met, and so far, the
Tribe has exactly doubled the We. t
i wood efforts. Stanford has won 12,
i chopped 6, and tied 1.

lIOAMIN' ROBERT WHITE would

gained I2»'i yards in 10 tarries to
help iout the Bruins, .">1 to 14.
Stanford's football Indians,
backed up and bruised by
Michigan's Wolverines, will fi
nally get around to opening !
their conference season tomor- i
row in the Stadium against the |
unbeaten UCLA Bruins.
KickofT time is set for 2:30, with i
a frosh preliminary between Stan- '
ford and Santa Clara scheduled to j
get underway at 11:1.5,
A crowd of 45,000 paying cus- j
tomofs is expected to be on hand J
to watch the Cards try to bounce j
back from their 27-7 Michigan loss
with a victory over the Bruin.
But against the Sanders single
wing, which has won three straight !
(Oregon State, 35-13; lowa. 41-25;
Oregon, 35-27) and which is pres
ently setting the pace in the PCC [
rundown, it might not be so easy.
TO TEST IT! I.I)
The Bruins arrived in town this [
morning on the Southern Pacific I
Lark and will probally test the Sta
dium turf later this afternoon. To
morrow the invading gridders will
be followed by 3,000 rooters and a
band.
The contest will have as much
Rose Bowl scent to it as an early
season clash po.sibly can. With
I Oregon out of the way, the race has
narrowed down to four clubs, USC,
UCLA, Cal, and Stanford. Alter
Saturday, Stanford or UCLA will
be eliminated.
The Indians, although still bot.li
: ered by a handful of injured rogu
-1 lars, should be ready for this one.
I Marehie Schwartz worked the men
j long hours this week on UCLA de
fense, as the defensive unit will draw
the rugged assignment of slopping
I the Bruin ground game which has
' been vicious to date.

The Tribe defense will consist of
Bruce Van Alstync and Jack Rye at j
ends, Jim Castagnoli and Dick Ab- j
raham at line-backers, Wes Poulson J

and Cordon While at tackles, Hart i
Cook and Russ Pomrroy at guards, j
Dave Field and Ken Peek at half- j
backs, and Hairy Iluga.sian at safe-J
i ty.
I! they can stop Ernie Johnson j
. nd Cliff Sthroeder's running and
passing, it's a good bet that the ball- j
| game will be decided right then
j and there.
Fti.nlord's offensive threats (listed'
below in the starting lineup) will be |
the saint- as usual, except that the

injured A 1 Rau may be replaced by
Poulson.
Packing the ball in practice this
week were Emery Mitchell, Bob
White, and Rupc Andrews, and all
three looked as if they meant busi- |
ness.
WHITE It AMBLED
Last season when Stanford upset ,
UCLA 34-14, to win their first con
ference game in two years, it was
mainly Bob White and Emery
Mitchell who supplied the fire
works.
Bob White rambled to three \
touchdowns that day, and he piled j
up 126 yards in 10 tries for 12.(5 per
I carry. A performance like that to- j
i morrow could crack things wide i
j open.
Finery Mitchell, another impor- j
tant cog in last season's victory,
} looks right now to be in top form
i again, although Bill DeYoung will
continue to get the starting nod at
I full Lack.
It has been said that the Bruins
arc not Michigan. But the Bruins
!do play block and tackle football,
and they will be able to give Stan-
I ford all it can handle.
It will be the 20th time the two
I -''boots have met, and so far, the
Tribe has exactly doubled the We. t
i wood efforts. Stanford has won 12,
i chopped 6, and tied 1.

lIOAMIN' ROBERT WHITE would
please one antl all if be repealed
his 1!' IH effort against UCLA. He
gained I2»'i yards in 10 tarries to
help iout the Bruins, .">1 to 14.
Stanford's football Indians,
backed up and bruised by
Michigan's Wolverines, will fi
nally get around to opening !
their conference season tomor- i
row in the Stadium against the |
unbeaten UCLA Bruins.
KickofT time is set for 2:30, with i
a frosh preliminary between Stan- '
ford and Santa Clara scheduled to j
get underway at 11:1.5,
A crowd of 45,000 paying cus- j
tomofs is expected to be on hand J
to watch the Cards try to bounce j
back from their 27-7 Michigan loss
with a victory over the Bruin.
But against the Sanders single
wing, which has won three straight !
(Oregon State, 35-13; lowa. 41-25;
Oregon, 35-27) and which is pres
ently setting the pace in the PCC [
rundown, it might not be so easy.
TO TEST IT! I.I)
The Bruins arrived in town this [
morning on the Southern Pacific I
Lark and will probally test the Sta
dium turf later this afternoon. To
morrow the invading gridders will
be followed by 3,000 rooters and a
band.
The contest will have as much
Rose Bowl scent to it as an early
season clash po.sibly can. With
I Oregon out of the way, the race has
narrowed down to four clubs, USC,
UCLA, Cal, and Stanford. Alter
Saturday, Stanford or UCLA will
be eliminated.
The Indians, although still bot.li
: ered by a handful of injured rogu
-1 lars, should be ready for this one.
I Marehie Schwartz worked the men
j long hours this week on UCLA de
fense, as the defensive unit will draw
the rugged assignment of slopping
I the Bruin ground game which has
' been vicious to date.

The Tribe defense will consist of
Bruce Van Alstync and Jack Rye at j
ends, Jim Castagnoli and Dick Ab- j
raham at line-backers, Wes Poulson J

and Cordon While at tackles, Hart i
Cook and Russ Pomrroy at guards, j
Dave Field and Ken Peek at half- j
backs, and Hairy Iluga.sian at safe-J
i ty.
I! they can stop Ernie Johnson j
. nd Cliff Sthroeder's running and
passing, it's a good bet that the ball- j
| game will be decided right then
j and there.
Fti.nlord's offensive threats (listed'
below in the starting lineup) will be |
the saint- as usual, except that the

injured A 1 Rau may be replaced by
Poulson.
Packing the ball in practice this
week were Emery Mitchell, Bob
White, and Rupc Andrews, and all
three looked as if they meant busi- |
ness.
WHITE It AMBLED
Last season when Stanford upset ,
UCLA 34-14, to win their first con
ference game in two years, it was
mainly Bob White and Emery
Mitchell who supplied the fire
works.
Bob White rambled to three \
touchdowns that day, and he piled j
up 126 yards in 10 tries for 12.(5 per
I carry. A performance like that to- j
i morrow could crack things wide i
j open.
