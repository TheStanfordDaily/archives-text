Dear Mrs. Bungcy, |
Sorry I won't be at Stanford this year to thank you personally tor your
part in making my trip to Europe so enjoyable
The trip was all I had hoped for and more. The group was congenial, and
I'm sure I made some lifelong friendson the trip. The tour itself was very well
organized, the hotels were good, and the itinerary all that a person could ask. The
Scottish part was also very fine, with the only weak point being the Irish hotels,
which were very poor—perhaps they still don't like the Scotch. The Edinburgh
Music Festival was particularly interesting.
Get along very well on my own after the end of the tour and enjoyed
Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal immensely. Made my plane in Lisbon on
time, although I had my doubts at one point, and had a good trip home. For
future reference, the Do lmperio in Lisbon is super deluxe—very fine hotel.
, Think 1 liked the south part of Germany the best of everything, with
Switzerland a close second. The Norwegian fjords were beautiful, but I wouldn't
care to spend any more time than we did. Flew over to Finland on my own
and enjoyed it as much as anything I did; it's amazing how those people arc
working to recover from their war damage and throw off the influence of Russia.
Again, thank you and Mr. Bungey tor all you did in arranging my trip. It
indeed was one cf the highlights of my life.
Sincerely,
(Nome supplied on request)
