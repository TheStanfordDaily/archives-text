CANTON, Oct. !) (A 3 )â€” Red Gen.
Lin Piao swung his main forces
southwest in pursuit of Chinese Na
tionalist troops withdrawing into
Kwangsi province today, giving
Canton an uneasy respite.
Reliable private reports said the
Communists were advancing despite
strong rear-guard actions by Gen.
I'ai Chung-hsi's Nationalists.
They were said to be approaching
Lingling, 231) miles northwest of
Canton .
Pai evidently has elected to usl
his 200,000 men to defend il rather
than Canton, the provisional Na
tionalist capital.
