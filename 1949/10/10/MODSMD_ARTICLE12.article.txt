# Card Gridders Flounder, Hand Bruins One Free Win
## 
### JOHN HALL 
It took Stanford fifty-six minutes of stumble-bum football last
Saturday to hand UCLA it fourth consecutive win, 14 to 7.
Forthy thousand Stadium fans watched Stanford's offense
flounder miserably every time it approached scoring territory,
and only Rupe Andrews' four-minute entry into the lineup kept

♦Stanford from being whitewashed.
Sure, the Indiana pushed UCLA
I all over the field, pounding out 18
first downs 1o 7, but they handed
; Ernie Johnson two touchdowns, and
that was it.
ROSE BOWIx HAH!
In so doing, they kissed the Rose
Bowl goodbye, flunked the single
| wing fingernail test for the second
straight week, and had the Card
, rooters moaning, "Here we go again."
i To say that UCLA was a good
j team doesn't do it. The Bruins did
have the ability to cash in on Indian
J miscues, but a Trojan or Bear could
| have cashed in at least twice as
' much.
It's difficult to put a finger on
what kept Stanford stumbling. At
times the offense clicked perfectly,
and the defense, for the most part,
I stopped the Bruins cold.
FLUBBING QB's
But every time the Cards got close,
1 !.lie halfbacks would come up with
six thumbs, the quarterbacks went
j back instead of forward, and Stan
ford drew goose-eggs instead of
touchdowns.
For the record, it was Gary Kcr
korian on a .sneak who finally went
| over for Stanford from the two. But
if it had not been for some inspired
! running by Rupe Andrews, the for
i gotten man, the ball would never
' have been resting on the two.
In two tries, a forward from Gary
I Kerkorian to Rupe, and a Kerkorian
| pitchout to Rupe, combined with the
j Andrews touch on the foot end, the
Indians picked up as much yardage
j in Bruin territory as they did in the
entire game.
CARD TD TOO LATE
But Andrews might as well have
not made the effort. The Bruins had
already closed the door.
Stanford's only bright moments of
the afternoon came between the 30-
; yard stripes, mainly sandwiched
I around the brilliant pass-rccciving
i of end Ken Ro.sc.
Rose, besides Westwood Ernie
Johnson, was probably the outstand
ing griddcr on the field. He blocked
! well and ran smoothly whenever he
! got his mitts on the ball.
ROSE HOT
If there had been more Rose in
' side the Bruin 30, there might have
been more reward for the Indian
defensive unit, which worked hard
and successfully all afternoon, only
to see its efforts go for nil when the
offense didn't handle its half of the
bargain.
Russ Pomeroy and Hal Walker, in
particular, turned in fine defensive
performances. Bruce Van Alstyne,
although erratic, broke through
more than once to nail Bruin ball
carriers for lost yardage, and in gen
eral, the defensive secondary was
on the spot.
But there were too many fumbles.
Too many interceptions. Too many
mistakes. Too much nothing.
It turned out to be the same old
story. Stanford lost its second game
of the season and its 17th in the last
22 tries.
Like the conductor said when he
rang the bell, boys—its the end of
I the line.
