# Draft-Age Men Must Register
## 
### 
Though drafting of men for the
armed services is at. a standstill and
I promises to remain so for some time, (
men arc still required to register
! within 10 days after becoming 18.
Failure to do so is a federal offense, j
carrying penalties of fine and im
prisonment.
Men may register with any con
venient draft board. Draft boards
closest to Stanford arc in San Jose
at Room 416, Bank of America
i Building, and in San Mateo at 45 1
North B Street.
Upon receiving his questionnaire,
normally more than a year after
| registration, a student enrolled at
1 Stanford may obtain from the Uni
; versify a form exempting him from
1 the draft for one year.
These forms arc obtainable in the
â€¢ office of Mr. Waterous, Assistant
Counselor for Men, in Temporary
Building B, Room 24. They may be
obtained in succceding years to ex
tend exemption.
