# Dr. Sterling Inaugurated as Fifth President
## Fifth President Accepts Duties At Bright, Impressive Ceremony 
### 
At an impressive, colorful ceremony Dr. Wallace Sterling was
inaugurated fifth president of Stanford University Friday after
noon.
The audience of 7,000 in tree-shaded Frost Amphitheater heard
Dr. Sterling say, "I shall discharge my duties with integrity and
♦with such talent and energy as I

j po.'ess." With these words Dr.
Sterling ended his quarter of "learn
ing the ropes" at Stanford, and offi
cially became it fifth president.
ACCEPTS BURDEN
The Board of Trustees, delegates,
faculty, alumni, and students heard
the new president accept respousi
| hility for maintaining "a univer-
Isity of high degree," for "teaching
i the lessons of liberty."
i Paul C. Edwards, president of the
Board of Trustees, confirmed Dr.
I Sterling's statements in a speech
: praising the new president.
"We have seen him at work and
•at play," he said. "We have felt
| the warm and wholesome glow of his
j personality. We have seen regard
and respect for him and confidence
| in him grow steadily with acquain
tance."
• JUDGMENTS, VALUES
The man who inspired this eon
j fidence closed his address with this
j statement of policy:
"Wc must have as a prime cduca
j tional objective the development in
! student and teacher alike of a
1 greater capacity to make relevant
| judgments, to discriminate anions
I values.
"For only through these can the
j abjectness of tyranny be exposed,
| the measure of material things bo
! taken and the basic worth of indi
| vidual freedom be appraised."
"MIRACLES" ASKED
i In outlining the rccent changes in
universities, Dr. Sterling said:
"A university today is supposed
to perform a variety of educational
services, or if you prefer, miracles.
First, it is supposed train you people
for life's work Second, the
| universities arc expected to discover
and organize knowledge Third,
i they arc expected to inculcate a
| sense of values according to which
I the gifts of material education can
be wisely judged and intelligently
used.
"And fourth, the universities are
expected to do all of these things
for more students than ever before."
UNIVERSITIES DAZED
He said universities are not op
| posed to the tremendous inrush of
students—but arc merely dazed by
it.
Dr. Sterling's inauguration can be
; compared to that, of Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan, ex
cept that Dr. Jordan started his term
as president of a school with 30
tcachers and 559 students. Tin* fac
ulty has now reached 900, and the
; student body 8,000.
But the setting was the same, the
! ideals the same.
"We come than to this day of in-
I auguration, happy and contented in
i contemplation of that which h;is
! gone before, confident of what the
future holds," said Edwards.
