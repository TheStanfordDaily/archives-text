# Library Gets Old Volumes
## 
### 
Bound volumes of old California
, newspapers published during the
I politically turbulent years from 1877
. to 1911 have been added to the col
j lection of historical newspapers at
I the Stanford University Library.
The papers are the San Jose Pio
| necr, the San Jose Mercury and the
; San Jose Herald. They arc duplicate
I copies from the files of the San Jose
I Mercury-Herald, donor of the vol
-1 umcs to the Library.
The collection completes the file
; on the San Jose paper, since the
| library already possesses all volumes
j of the paper from 1012 to the pres
! ent.
the 68 bound volumes re
ceived by the Library are copies of
| the New Orleans Republican for
| 18(i8, probably acquired by the San
Jose paper through exchanges.
Acqusition of the volumes was ar
; ranged by Dr. Chilton K. Bush, head
|of the University's Institute for
I Journalistic Studies. The file was
: turned over to Dr. Raynard C.
j Swank, director of libraries, and
â–  Miss Irene Barquist, gifts and ex
j change librarian.
The papers cover the breaking of
; railroad control of the state legisla
ture and the administrations of the
late Gov. Hiram Johnson.
They will be used by students
| conducting research in the fields of
| journalism, history, and political
; science.
The volumes are being added to
the Library's extensive collection of
historic and rare newspapers. In
1047 45.000 colonial and early Ameri
j can newspapers were acquired by
Stanford, and last year 975 news
papers of historical interest were
presented to the Library.
