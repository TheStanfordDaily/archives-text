# Navy Fights For Power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (/p)_The
N;ivy brings its biggest guns to bear
this week against Pentagon defense
doctrines in a now-or-never battle
to preserve its full sea and air
power.
It marshalled before the House
Armed Services Committee such old
sea dogs as Fleet Admirals W. F.
(Bull) Halsey, Ernest J. King, and
Chester Nimitz to nail down grave
contentions that the nation is being
put on the wrong security track.
The committee is investigating ex
plosive unification troubles within
the armed services, and charges by
Navy men that it is not getting a
square deal from a "landlocked"
Pentagon high command.
Chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga.)
confirmed today earlier predictions
that Johnson will be called before
the committee. Vinson already has
proposed curbs on his powers.
He also confirmed that secretary
Johnson had ordered an $800,000,000
economy cut in current (1950) de
fense appropriations, and has as
sessed the heaviest part against the
Navy and its fleet and marine air
arm.
What's more, Vinson announced,
lie had learned that plans were afoot
to cut $100,000,000 irom naval avia
tion in the still-pending 1951 budget
and give it to the air force â€”all in
spite of recommendations of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Hie 1950 defense appropriation bill
is to come up in Congress tomorrow
after being in conference over Sen
ate-House differences. The princi
pal disagreement is over provisions
for the air force. The House wants
58 air groups; the Senate the 48
groups recommended by President
Truman.
