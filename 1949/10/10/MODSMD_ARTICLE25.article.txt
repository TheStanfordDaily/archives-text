# Pass 'Em Out at the Gates

### 
"Megaphone Melee," a production written,
directed, and produced by the Stanford Rally
Committee Last Saturday, may go down in
theatrical history as one of the year's better
panic scenes. It ranks on a par, at least, with
the last C. B. DeMille epic we saw.
The scene was the men's rooting section in
Stanford Stadium; the time was last Saturday
afternoon shortly before the opening kickoff;
and the action was Rally Com members distrib
uting a large number of Roos Brother mega
phones to student rooters in the same manner
in which they would feed the monkeys at a
zoo. Casualties totaled three, including one
broken nose.
We dislike to constantly belittle the actions
of Rally Com which, on the whole, is doing a
fine job, but when the committee continues to

do little things the hard was, we find it diffi
cult to remain silent.
We have a plan. Not an original plan, mind
you, as this same Rally Com used it last year.
But nevertheless a plan.
One or two members posted at the men's
and women's gates and handing out mega
phones, one to a person, as rooters pass
through would do the trick. No fuss, no muss,
no bother.
There would be no need to carry heavy
cartons of "phones" way up to the top of the
stands so that gravity might aid the pitching
arms of the weaker members; everybody
would get one megaphone instead of six going
to the basketball players while the shorter
members of the student body go without.
Just pass them out at the gates. It's as
simple as that.
