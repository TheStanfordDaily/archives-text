### JOHN HALL 
Who were those ante-diluvian cruds who yelled
"no-no" when Dean Borba asked for the axe-yell in
the fourth quarter last Saturday?
Who are these creeps that sneak into the football

game under the disguise of nor
mal, honest-to-God human be
ings?
How dare they give UCLA a
football win and the Conference
lead?
How dare they ruin Stanford's
1949 football season?
How dare they make me sick
to my stomach?
I demand a letter to the editor
giving one—just one—good rea-

son why there was an objection to giving the Yell.
If ever in the entire tradition of the Axe-yell
there was a better spot for it, you'll have to point it
out.
UCLA, in powder-puff blue jerseys, was leading
by a single touchdown, but Stanford was threatening,
although the final paydirt spark was missing.
When UCLA took time out with the ball on the
Bruin 40, first and 10 for the Tribe—that was IT. The
perfect spot to give 'em that extra push. But when
Borba asked if anybody wanted to give the yell,
these misguided cruds shouted him down.

Don't tell me to save it for Cal. We miaht as well
save it lor the graveyard. Read up on the tradition
of the Axe-yell, will you? Yeah, read up and then
forget it. You boohs missed your chance.
* * :»
While shedding a football tear: What ever hap
pened to Lloyd Merriman? He was the last Stanford
man I ever saw run back a punt. Nowadays we just
don't run back punts.

I finally heard somebody say something disparaging
about Joe Dimaggio, and seeing as it came from a
DiMaggio worshipper, I guess it's okay to quote it.
As everybody knows, DiMag was having a dismal
World Scries, and reached bottom when he slipped
and fell while going after a ball hit by Pee Wee Reese
which put Reese on ba:-:e and started a large Brooklyn
rally.
So wh'. 11 DiMag carne to bat next time, Mel Allen,
who had been making excuses for Joe all week, an
nounced in his best Gillette tones that although Joe
was weak, wan, and wasted, he was still the Yankee
Clipper. At which point, my boy says, "You mean
Yankee Tripper," and I laughed. Not loud, but just
a chuckle.
Because it's not every clay ycu hear somebody
say something mean about DiMaggio. Everybody
loves DiMagtjio. Ask anyone in Boston.

Don't tell me to save it for Cal. We miaht as well
save it lor the graveyard. Read up on the tradition
of the Axe-yell, will you? Yeah, read up and then
forget it. You boohs missed your chance.

While shedding a football tear: What ever hap
pened to Lloyd Merriman? He was the last Stanford
man I ever saw run back a punt. Nowadays we just
don't run back punts.

I finally heard somebody say something disparaging
about Joe Dimaggio, and seeing as it came from a
DiMaggio worshipper, I guess it's okay to quote it.
As everybody knows, DiMag was having a dismal
World Scries, and reached bottom when he slipped
and fell while going after a ball hit by Pee Wee Reese
which put Reese on ba:-:e and started a large Brooklyn
rally.
So wh'. 11 DiMag carne to bat next time, Mel Allen,
who had been making excuses for Joe all week, an
nounced in his best Gillette tones that although Joe
was weak, wan, and wasted, he was still the Yankee
Clipper. At which point, my boy says, "You mean
Yankee Tripper," and I laughed. Not loud, but just
a chuckle.
Because it's not every clay ycu hear somebody
say something mean about DiMaggio. Everybody
loves DiMagtjio. Ask anyone in Boston.

Who were those ante-diluvian cruds who yelled
"no-no" when Dean Borba asked for the axe-yell in
the fourth quarter last Saturday?
Who are these creeps that sneak into the football

game under the disguise of nor
mal, honest-to-God human be
ings?
How dare they give UCLA a
football win and the Conference
lead?
How dare they ruin Stanford's
1949 football season?
How dare they make me sick
to my stomach?
I demand a letter to the editor
giving one—just one—good rea-

son why there was an objection to giving the Yell.
If ever in the entire tradition of the Axe-yell
there was a better spot for it, you'll have to point it
out.
UCLA, in powder-puff blue jerseys, was leading
by a single touchdown, but Stanford was threatening,
although the final paydirt spark was missing.
When UCLA took time out with the ball on the
Bruin 40, first and 10 for the Tribe—that was IT. The
perfect spot to give 'em that extra push. But when
Borba asked if anybody wanted to give the yell,
these misguided cruds shouted him down.
