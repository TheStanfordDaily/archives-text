Miss Gytel's Letter

To the Editor:
Reading Miss Gudrun Gytel's comment on Dr.
Brandt's speech last Tuesday, I feel obliged to say
a few words from the platform of a German student.
I admit that I feel deeply ashamed for what the
Germans hive done to many occupied nations in
Europe, and that I regret having teen a soldier in
this army which attacked many small states in its
neighborhood without having any reason to do so.
I realize tint our present government has taken over
a very poor heritage and it seems to be understand
able that Germans are to be blamed as a whole for
what a great number of them have done in the past.
I should like to ask you, however, when this suc
cessive hatred between nations shall find an end.
I have lost several relatives (women and children)
in the Sudeten Area of Czechoslovakia while the
Czechs were again taking over this land in 1945.
One would suppose that I should now hate the Czech
people, a few of whom have committed atrocities not
different from the ones done by Germans beforehand.
I believe that there must be an end to this long range
of hate again producing hatred and I see no reason
why I should not make a beginning.

Of course there is not much reason for the Ameri
can people to support the re-establishment of a na
tion that has caused so much damage to the world.
But the fact that America has helped us during the
last few years has perhaps been a better lesson for
democracy than many of the attempts to show us
that we are the only evil in the world and ought to
be punished collectively. As a people we do not ask
the world for pity about our present condition, but
for actions to help us out of our moral and physical
isolation. This is the one chance for the growth of
a young and new generation in Germany, for people
that shall once take over the democratic leadership of
their government.
Tiie American student-exchange program may be
regarded as one step in this direction and you can
be assured that these American efforts will not be
in vain. I would, however, not consider myself to be
in the light place as an exchange student if Miss
Gytel's comment were the general attitude of the
American people. The growth of a democratic Ger
many mainly depends upon the interrelation with
its neighborhood nations and on the exchange of ideas
between its yourv generation and the young people
in the world.
