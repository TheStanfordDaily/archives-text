# Service Insurance Deadline Set; No Checks Due Until 1950
## 
### 
No checks m payment of the spe
cial National Service Life Insurance
dividend will be mailed before Janu
ary, 1950. the Veterans Administra
tion announces.
Harold W. Breining, assistant
administrator for insurance, said re
ports that checks might start going
out before Christmas were "abso
lutely without foundation."
An estimated 1G.000.000 veterans
and servicemen are entitled to a
share of the $2,800,000,000 dividend
fund. Once payments start, checks
are expected to go into the mails at
the rate of 200.000 per working day.
More than 12,000.000 applications
for dividend payments have been
received in Washington since appli
cation forms were made available on
Au rt u: t 29.
Eligible veterans who have not yet
applied may obtain forms at VA

ofTices, Post Offices, or from Veter
ans service organizations.
World War II veterans with serv
ice-incurred disabilities were re
minded by Veterans Administration
today of an important deadline in
connection with their entitlement to
National Service Life Insurance.
Prior to January I, 1950, such dis
abilities actually incurred in service
between October 8, 1940, and Sep
tember 2, 1945, if less than total in
degree, are disregarch-d in deter
mining eligibility under the health
requirements for NSLI purposes.
This means that veterans who
might not otherwise qualify for life
insurance for health reasons may re
instate lapsed NSLI or buy new oi
additional insurance up to the $10,-
000 maximum if they apply before
the end of the year.
