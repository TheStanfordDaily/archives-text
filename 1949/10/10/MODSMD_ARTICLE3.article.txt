CHICAGO â€” The Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and Engine
men tonight rejected a Presidential
emergency board report, but made
no recommendation for a strike or a
strike vote.
Instead, David B. Robertson, pres
ident of the union, said that a new
parley has been arranged with the
nation's railroad representatives in
Chicago next Tuesday.
An agreement may be reached
then to avert a nationwide strike.
