# Cards' Future Opponents Have Weekend Troubles
## Washington Upset by Beavers, 7 to 3; Cal Beats Badgers-Sarver Injured 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's inconsistent Indians will hit the halfway mark of
their 10-game schedule next Saturday at Seattle when they take
on the Washington Huskies.
The Huskies have had their share of trouble this year. After
eking out a 14 to 6 win over Utah in their opener, they have ab-

sorbed consecutive defeats from
Minnesota and Notre Dame. Then
last Saturday they were upset vic-

Tims as the lowly Oregon State Bea
vers came from behind to nip the
Huskies by a 7 to 3 count.
BEAVERS OUTGAINED
Washington completely dominated
the game statistically as they
gained 400 yards passing and rush- j
ing compared to only 150 for the j
Beavers. The Huskies were further!
! handicapped by the loss of half- j
I backs Hugh McElhenny and Hank
Tiedemann, who' were injured in i
the Notre Dame game.. It seems |
that a game with Notre Dame can
be expected to cripple a team for at
| least three weeks.
Southern California had its per- (
i fact record marred last Saturday as i
the Trojans were forced lo settle !
! for a 13 to 13 tie with Ohio State, j
I Trailing 13 to 7 in the third period, j
; the Trojans put together a 64-yard !
march to pay dirt with fullback Bill |
Mai tin going over for the score.
CALIFORNIA WINS
After an evenly played first half, j
I California broke loose for three ;
! touchdowns in the final half to out- j
score the Badgers from Wisconsin,
'35 to 20. The win, however, was a \
costly one for the Bears, since they
| lost the services of their star half
! back, Charlie Sarver. Sarver will
j definitely be out of next Saturday's
crucial with USC, and that's one
i game when the Bears will really
! need his speed.
At Lodi yesterday good old P.U.
(Portland University) blew a 7 to 6
: half time lead and went on to lose
to Santa Clara, 26 to 13. It marked
; the third consecutive win for the
Broncos, and is in keeping with their
usual .mid-season surge.
Idaho had an open date last
| weekend.
