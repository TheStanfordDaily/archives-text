# 'IT WAS A GIFT'
## Coach & Co. Wail After UCLA Loss 
### JOHN BREIER 
The "Now" boys were very close
to being the "Bow" boys last Sat
urday, both during and after the
game.
Their heads were bowed in defeat.
They took this loss harder than any
j this writer has seen in three years
of covering Stanford football losses.
Somebody had written a large
I "NOW" on the blackboard at the
' entrance of the dressing room. One
|of the disgruntled players had
| drawn his hand through the thick
chalk on the way back from the
! game. The gesture seemed to sym
bolize the team's lost chance for the
coveted Rose Bowl invitation.
CARDS BEWILDERED
"It was a gift." mourned Coach
Schwartz. And the p'ayers agreed.
It was a half-hour before many of
j them started to undress. They sat in
1 disgusted bewilderment. "Wo gave
; it to them . . . they didn't play well,
hut we were worse . . . we just fum
! hied too much."
And it was a gift if you believe
in statistics. The Cards outgained
I the Bruins 326 yards to 140 yards,
18 first downs to 7. But the Indians
' failed when it counted. They were
| midfield marvels who lost their
drive inside the UCLA 30.
Schwartz faced the men of the
press with a very sad face. "Let's
get this over with quickly. I can't
say much about a game like that,"
jhe said.
JOHNSON BEST BACK
| He picked Ernie Johnson as the
| best back on the field and Russ
j Pomeroy as the most valuable Stan
ford man. He didn't try to explain
1 why the usually reliable Ken Peck
j had tried a greenhorn's trick in lat
j eraling with a tackier already on
j him to set up the first UCLA mark
er.
j This writer asked, "Did you have
any special reason for keeping An
drews out of the game unitl the
fourth quarter?"
''No, I didn't," he snapped. He
started to say more but checked
himself. A question later he came

back With, "I answered that ques
tion in that manner lor il is always
easy to second guess."
BRUINS NOT JOYOUS
The UCLA dressing room was riot
the joyous place one might imagine.
The atmosphere was one of subdued
excitement. Coach Sanders was
asked, "Did you feel that you had
the l>est team on the field today?"
"When you win you are the best
team . . . that's been my experi
ence," he answered.
DEYOUNG AND ANDREWS
Sanders went on to say that he
"hoped the rest of the Coast teams
wouldn't get any tougher." lie
praised the Stanford backs by num
ber, "I liked number 20 and 11. You
had some 'real leaping' men out
there."
But when it was al! said and done
. . . Stanford had lost another foot
ball game. One they should have
won. But the team members blamed
themselves. The fans didn't look at
it that way. Where do we go from
I there?
