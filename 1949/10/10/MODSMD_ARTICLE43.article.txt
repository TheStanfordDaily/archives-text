# Taylormen In 27-13 Win
## Frosh Nip Broncs For 13th Straight 
### BILL MORLEY 
After a scoreless and sloppy first
half the Card pigskin yearlings
struck twice in the third quarter
and got another pair in the final
stanza to beat the Santa Clara frosh
27 to 13 Saturday morning at the j
Stanford Stadium.
In a game lull of penalties and
fumbles, the Broncos kicked into the
end zone to begin the second half.
The Papooses appeared to be mov
ing when star fullback Skip Crist !
fumbled on his own 44.

Santa Clara went to the 36 and
then fumbled themselvesâ€”no sur
prise. it had happened all day. On i
the next play the whole Red team |
started to move to the right, but i
speedy halfback Wes Laubscher j
suddenly took the ball from quar- 1
terback Dave Eldredge and a per- |
fectly naked reverse was in opera- j
tion.
LAUBSCHER SCORES
The Broncs were completely
fooled anjl with no apparent block- :
ing Wes went 64 yards in the clear.
Crist kicked the extra point.
The score seemed to sheke the
| frosh from their lethargic fumble
itis. After a long Bronco drive from
j the ensuing kiekoff, Stanford held
for downs on its own 29 and began
a long drive of its own.
On third down Crist pulled off
his own right tackle to the Card 49.
Then Crist, Laubscher, and Dick
Gargui.'o alternated on short line
plays to the Santa Clara J7.
Eldredge threw to right end Dick
i Sawyer, who incidentally played an
| excellent offensive game, on the
i eight and Crist plunged to the four.
| Illegal use of hands took the ball
| back to the 19 but Garguilo sped
! around right end into the end zone.
Eldredge passed to Sawyer for the
! extra point, and the third quarter
! ended with the score 14 to 0 Stan
! ford.
BRONCOS COME BACK
On the kiekoff a substitute Bronc
' halfback named Jim Merz led the
j tnemy on a 78-yard march for 6
| points.
On two more plays Stanford had
; G more points and the ball game in
|the bag.
Santa Clara kicked off to Peterson
| who carried to his own 42. On the
| next play Loren Hinkleman went
| over left guard for a touchdown.
! Crist's kick was wide.
PASS PAYS OFF
The Broncs had one more gasp,
however, and drove back the en
-1 suing kiekoff (56 yards for a score.

Quarterback Duane Louis passed
i the last 35 to end Gene Nagler for
I the touchdown. Louis' kick was
j good. Score 20 to 13, Cards.

when the Broncs gambled on a
