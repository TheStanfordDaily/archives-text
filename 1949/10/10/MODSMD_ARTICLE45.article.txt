A three-foot push shot by Trent j
McHugh, UCLA's star forward, !
broke a 3 to 3 tie as the Stanford j
water polo team bowed to a revital

It was a nip and tuck battle all
the way, neither team leading by
more than one point at any time

j during the contest.
McHugh's winning shot came two
minutes before the end of the game. !
Although the contest was tied sev- i
eral times, the Cards had never been '
behind since the opening minute. j
After the Bruins had made their '
initial score, Stanford's veteran I
guard Ken Fox scored on a beauti- !
ful 15 - yard shot from the right
| hand corner to knot up the game
I 1 to 1.
i A minute later, Ernie Polte. a
i newcomer to the Card team, made a
1 similar point from the right side,
I and it looked like the Indians would
! start pulling away.
However, the Bruins were not to
I be denied, and scored on a partially
1 deflected shot to again knot the
i score 2 to 2, shortly before half
! time.

In the beginning of the second '
j half, Card forward Hub Stokely
made a 10-foot whip shot on the
left side to put Stanford in the lead
again 3 to 2, but this again was
short-lived.
Much to the delight of the large
! gathering of Bruin fans, the never
| say-die Uclans tied the score 3 to 3,
setting the stage for McHugh's win
ning toss. McHugh was high scorer
of the day with three goals.
