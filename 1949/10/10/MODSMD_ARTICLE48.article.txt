# Danish Exchange Student Recounts First Experiences in United States
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
i The motorist cruising south out of
!Washington, D.C., saw a tall, blond,
(young man in khaki standing at the
wide of the highway.
; "Ride, soldier?" he called as he
stopped. The young man climbed
jin. Bent Pontoppidan, Stanford for
eign scholarship student from Den
mark, started on the first lap of his
hitchhiking tour from Washington
to New Orleans.
Bent arrived in New York in the
middle of last summer's heat. For
four days he saw the sights of the
city, then went up to New Haven
for a summer course for foreign stu
dents at Yale. At the end of the
rummer he was full of "theoretical"
information about America, and he
decided to learn a little about this
country from first-hand knowledge.
An experienced hitchhiker, Bent

I chose that as the best way to see
the country and meet people. In
Washington, D.C., where, he said, he
was lucky enough to miss the humid
summer heat, and spent three beau
tiful days seeing the town —a travel
agency helped him pick the best
route through the South.
With only his strong right thumb
to rely on, Bent succeeded in keep
ing to his planned route and ar
rived in New Orleans five days later.
"Everyone told be not to go to
the French Quarter," he said, "so,
of course, I went there first." In
New Orleans he heard many of the
small Negro bands, which he said
were excellent—real rhythm, and
I quite up to any blues recordings he
I already owned.
CRUISED RIVER
A steamboat ride up the Missis
sippi was next on the agenda, and
! after that a side trip to Baton Rouge
to see the University of Louisiana.
But all his sightseeing and enter
; tainment was not planned or even
j expectcd. One afternoon, caught in
a crowd, he saw a fall fashion pa
rade with "Miss Autumn, 1949" rid
ing down Canal Street in a shiny j
convertible, and the rest of the pa
rade following in a similar manner. I
Such a place!
With only five days left to reach [
Stanford and stop to visit relatives j
in Los Angeles, Bent boarded the i
train for the West Coast.
EASY RIDES
"Hitchhiking would have been too |
slow," he explained. American mo- !
torists are much friendlier than !
many European drivers who pick j
you up—especially in France, he j
laughed. In France, he said, some of !
his friends took a ride on a lorry.
The driver took them part way
across a very dry desert region and j
then stopped the lorry and made
them give him 100 francs before he j
would take them any further.
Nevertheless, Bent reports that i
hitchhiking is very common among j
European students. The French j
truck driver was exceptionally un- !
friendly. "Scandinavian students
even have a 'student's cap' to wear,"
he said. "This way people recog
nize you and are more willing to
'RIDING CAP'
"I wore the cap over here," he I
went on. "and people didn't know
what it was, but they could see it j
was a school cap." After the Ameri- j
can custom of picking up service I
men was explained to him, he dei
cided that perhaps his khaki outfit !
was a help in getting him rides. j
After his year at Stanford—he's
studying international law here and :
living at the Alpha Sig House—Bent j
plans to start out on the highway
again. The summer trip is to include J

Oregon, Washington, Canada, the
Midwest, and Chicago. "I want to
see if Chicago lives up to its repu
tation," he laughed.
NO PASSPORTS!
"This is a wonderful place to
travel in," he continued. "In Europe
you go the distance from Washing
ton to New Orleans and you have
' to cross four, maybe five, national
j borders. At each one you need a
; passport, and your bags are exam
| incd by customs officials. Here you
can even cross back and forth into
Mexico and Canada without a
passport!"
This life of study and travel is
quite different from that which Bent
lived a few years back when he
and many of his colleagues were
"trying to make Denmark just as
uncomfortable for the Germans as
we could."
IN UNDERGROUND
When he was 17, Bent started
working with the resistance move
ment, printing and distributing in
formation pamphlets and leaflets.
Later he helped with actual sabo
tage and collection of weapons. "We
used to put sugar in German gas
tanks," he said. "When you do that,
the lorry will break down after 100
miles."
"Of course, we had to keep mov
ing from place to place, and some
of my colleagues moved completely
out of Denmark. But I stayed, and
was very glad, because I was thoi-e
when the liberation came," he said.
"Aud such a day that was—with
dancing and singing in the streets."'
