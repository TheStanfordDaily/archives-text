### BENT PONTOPPIDAN 
First scene: The Knoll House. The
classroom is humming with many
different accents of the English lan
guage, just before the English test
for foreign students is to take place.
A man comes into the room and ex
plains thoroughly that he will read
an English sentence, and you will
have to choose the one among three
drawings which covers the meaning
best.
He starts reading—deep silence—
everybody is thinking hard. Did he
say the man was bitten by the dog,
the dog was bitten by the man, or
the man and the dog bite in a bone?
Next sentence. Did he say think
ing, sinking, or singing? The sing
ing girl on sketch B looks pretty, so
you check her.
Afterward an English professor
steps in and suggests you write
about "your home town." A Norwe
gian girl objects violently; Oslo is
not a town to write about. But her
protest is refused. Finally a kind

man wants an interview with you,
and he either assigns you to an Eng
lish course or he does not, depend
ing on whether he likes your accent
or not.
Next scene: A line outside the
Memorial Auditorium. After a short
wait you get in and you sit in a
comfortable chair and look expec
tantly toward the stage; now an im
portant man must show up and ex
plain things to you. But no! Soon
you are called out to the lobby
and you walk out from your seat i
with the same feeling you have !
when a film stops just at the mo- j
j ment it is getting exciitng.
| There all others get colored book
lets, but you only receive a pink
card telling you to go to the Board
of Admission. After this short visit
in Temporary Building A, you try
desperately to find the Pavilion on
the map. It is not there, so you ask
a nice passing girl. She does not
know cither, she tells you, but she
has a map.
Finally you find Mr. YVatcrous in
the Pavilion and he removes every ;
obstacle. So after a short re-per
formance in the theater, you obtain
a beautiful blue booklet and go I
happily out into the sunshine.
Here you find out, a little less j
i happily, that there are 20 blanks to ;
| be filled out, and with a deep sigh
j you remember old Mr. Fonss in the
University of Copenhagen who
j merely wrote your name in a big 1
black book.
"The next thing for you to do is
to sec your adviser," savs a well
informed man, and so you do. He is
a clever man . He hands you over 1o
the man you really need for your
planning. Then you walk back to !
the Pavilion.
An enterprising photographer lifts
your head two inches more than
usual and takes a picture while you
arc staring bewilderedly into the
camera. But soon you arc all
through and you have obtained your
first date at Stanford — with the
Health Service.
Finale: Physical examination. A
line of boys dressed only in socks is
waiting. You have never seen so
many colors and patterns of socks
in your life. Picasso would have
been envious of you for this sight if
he had known of it.
Then a physician tells you that
you have a #ood blood pressure, an
other hands you over to'a new team
of stern-looking men, one of whom
sticks you with a needle while an
other yells, "Hit 'em again, hit 'em !
again, harder, harder!"
At last, when all is over, you
stand outside, feeling deeply re
lieved and that it is good to be at
Stanford.
