'YOUNG SCIENTISTS ARE BUILDING
• CAREERS WITH DU PONT FROM
CONNECTICUT TO TEXAS
When you think of Du Pont research,
you may think first of Wilmington,
Delaware. Actually, only eight of the
Company's 36 research groups are
located there. Du Pont scientists now
pursue their studies in 11 states scat
tered from Connecticut to Texas.
Each of these laboratories is a self
contained operation. It may he de
voted in part to fundamental re
search and applied research, or to
investigations looking to the devel
opment of new products—sometimes
a combination of these activities.
An unusual Du Pont laboratory
is one opened last year at Newburgh,
New York.
Inside the Laboratory
In the three-story building at New
burgh, scientists have at their dis
posal the most modern equipment
for study of coated fabrics and plas
tic sheetings under all sorts of con
ditions. For example, a new product
can be tested in a room maintained

at a temperature of —20' F. In other
rooms, the effects of high tempera
ture and humidity can be studied.
Equipment is available for testing
tensile strength, tear resistance, fad
ing, flex and flame resistance, and
many other characteristics. One of
Du Pont's 33 libraries has quarters
in the building; there is a photo
graphic darkroom, as well as offices,
conference and work rooms.
The Newburgh Laboratory works
closely with the adjacent plant, which
makes "Fabrikoid" pyroxylin coated
fabrics, "Fabrilite" vinyl resin coated
fabrics and plastic sheetings, "Ton
tine" washable window shade cloth,
bookbinding materials, and other
coated and impregnated fabrics and
plastic sheetings for many uses.
Research at Du Pont
Research has long been a major ac
tivity at Du Pont, and it flourishes
in an atmosphere of appreciation,
encouragement and patience. The
new products, the new plants, and
the new and better jobs of the years
to come will develop from the pains
taking research programs being car
ried on today in the laboratories.

Choicc of Careers
Each of the Du Tout manufacturing
departments conducts continuous
research. They operate much like
separate companies, with interests
ranging from heavy chemicals to
plastics and textile fibers. Each holds
challenging opportunities for college
trained chemists and physicists, as
well as chemical, civil, electrical, in
dustrial and mechanical engineers,
also those specializing in production,
sales and many other fields..
In this alert, ever-growing organi
zation, young graduates can choose
from a variety of careers the one
that suits them best as their ability
and interests develop.
