# OCCUPATION
## Devastating Effects of War No Longer Apparent in American Governed Japan 
### DEE KEATLEY 
(Editor's Note: Miss lieatlcy,
Daily Night Editor, has just re
turned from a three months' stay
in Japan with her parents. Her
father. Colonel E. E. Keatlcy, is
commanding officer of the liana
gawa Civil Affairs Team, of which
Yokohama is the capital. It is the
first in a series of two articles on
conditions in Japan today.)

Effects of World War II are
scarcely evident in Occupied
Japan today. I feel I can say
this after living there for three
months.
The usual rubble of war, such as
crumbling brick walls and broken
beams is rarely found. Since Japa
nese houses arc ordinarily built of
wood, this material either burned
up after the bombing or was car
ried away on the backs of men,
women, and children who needed it
for firewood. Such brick and stone
as there was, has been used to
build new buildings.
WAR SIGNS SCARCE
Accordingly, the only real sign
of war in Japan is a scarcely notice
able dearth of high buildings. How
ever, when we drove through the
great industrial centers such as
Kawi isaki, a town between Tokyo
and Yokohama noted for its steel
industries, I saw a number of empty
skeletons of factories, their black
ened steel beams little changed from
the time of the bombing. The Japa
nese do not have means to carry
away this steel and so have not been
able to remove this evidence of war.
A notable thing about the town
of Kawasaki is the way it has been
rehabilitated. '1 he 1 last furnaces
and steel mills are going day and
night and other industries are also
thriving. The streets arc crowded
with stores offering Japanese-made
wares, contributing much to the eco
nomic welfare of the town. The city
government (with which my father,
as military governor of the prefec
ture, deals) has taken on a great
deal of the running of its own affairs
instead of letting the army do it. As
this is the aim of military govern
ment in Japan, it is a sign that
Kawasaki is doing vey well. How
ever, cost of the towns in Japan
are not far behind.
One remarkable characteristic of
the recent wai in Japan is the abun

dance of caves. Apparently every
family had to have a cave as an air
raid shelter and there arc over
79,000,000 people in Japan. The
caves go very deeply into every
hill and it is frightening to realize
what a good defense the Japanese
would have had against us if we
had invaded.
People keep asking me if the
Japanese seem hostile. The answer
is No. They are friendly, unless they

have been roughly treated by the
Occupation Forces. They are well
fed. since I hey are given a weekly
food ration which includes foods
with a high nutritional value. A
great deal of this food has been
shipped by the United Slates from
other countries and so is paid for
by the U.S. taxpayers.
FREEDOM OF ACTION
The majority of the Japanese peo
ple have more freedom of action
than I hey did before wo took over.

Thcy have been very much rcgi
| mented by their leaders since feudal
times in the 18th century and most
, of them have more choice in mat-
I tors now than they ever had before.
Another question that I am asked
is, "Is the Russian scare very
i strong?" Not that I know of, but the
j news that comes to us over the
Army radio station (we have only
j one English station) is censored by
J General Douglas Mac Arthur's head-

quarters first.
The only Communist trouble is
with strikes against the recent lay
off of railroad workers by the Japa
nese government to save money.
The return of repatriates from Rus
sia to Japan also occasioned several
demonstrations.
There arc a great many members
of the Allied Forces in Japan. How
ever, most of them arc there for
defense purposes only and have lit
tle to do with the actual governing

A large staff of civilian workers pro
vide the .specialized information
needed to solve economic and ad
ministrative problems and a lot, of
them work in offices a.s secretaries
and personnel workers.
RESTRICTIONS IJU KI)
Troops arc stationed all over
Japan, and until recently none of
the occupation personnel were al
lowed to associate with the Japanese
people. You could not go into Japa
nessc restaurants or hotels for fear
of germs, and the language barrier
prevented much shopping in Japa
nese stores. These limits have now
been lifted by General Mac-Arthur
and Americans can now go any
where in Japan.
The one exception to the rule of
non-fraternization with the Japa
nese was the Civil Affairs Teams,
formerly called Military Govern
ment Teams. These teams arc being
dissolved on November .'5O when the
entire running of the governments
will be put into Japanese hands.
(IOVERNMENT TEACHES
In Japan the military government
setup has been evolved to teach the
Japanese our democratic ways. Civil
Affairs teams, composed of both
Army officers and civilians well
versed in law, have been set up for
each prefecture, which is comparable
to a state. The Japanese are to run
their own government, collect taxes,
see about the allocation of the crops,
particularly rice, and keep order.
The members of the team only
supervise this work and act as a "go
between" for the Japanese govern
ment officials and the occupation
forces headed by General Douglas
Mac Arthur, supreme commander.
These teams are the only ones which
are supposed to deal with the Japa
nese directly; other occupation
forces, which compose the majority
of those stationed in Japan, arc re
quired to go through these teams.
After November 150. the Japanese
will have no help in running things
except from the regional teams
which have been established, one
team for every eight prefectures.
NO ONE SEES HIM
In Japan statements come from
General Mac Arthur's headquarters,
but no one ever sees the general
himself. He is, to the Japanese, just
a myth. The only time I ever saw
him was at a July 4th review in
Tokyo. Having just arrived in
Jnpan, I didn't realize at the moment
what an honor that was.
