# Honor Code Committee To Hold Open Meeting
## Students to Review Proposal For Revised Interpretation 
### 
Proposed interpretation of the Honor Code regarding the taking
of examinations out of exam rooms will be discussed today at
4 p.m. in the Excom Room. All students are invited to attend
and express their opinions, both pro and con. The proposed inter
pretation is:
"Providing adeguate seating is provided in the examination
" "112 room, exams will be taken out of the

room only with the permission of
the instructor."
The Honor Code Standing Com
mittee, which will moderate the dis
cussion, is anxious to find out
whether students feel this interpre
tation will strengthen or weaken the
Honor Code.
The situation has not been clear,
according to Donn Wells, Honor
j Code Committee chairman. Some
i professors have made a practice of
j refusing to allow exams to be taken
I out of the room, while others have
j freely permitted it-
Many students, said Wells, have
indicated that they feel that since
the second- and third-person re-
I sponsibility leaves the room with
tine exam, this is the weak point in
the Honor Code.
The Honor Code Committee, on
j the basis of violations observed, re
ports made to them concerning vio
lations, and general rumors during
| the post-war years, has come to the
i conclusion that the situation must
, be clarified, one way or another.
The committee feels that the pro
posed interpretation of the Code
| carries no weakening efleet on the
j honor systm, but rather that much
| harm is done to the Code by rumors
about cheating on exams taken out
of the rooms.
"This would not be an administra
| tive curb,'' emphasized Wells, "but a
movement by the students to pro
! tect their own system from the few
I who might use this means of abus
j ing lhe privileges of the Honor
I Code."
The proposed interpretation, said
j Wells, will in no way inhibit stu
] dents from leaving exam rooms or
taking exams out for apparently le
gitimate reasons. It will serve only
| as a check on those very few who
| would take unfair advantage of the
| privilege.
Some students have expressed the
| opinion that such a move would
I weaken the Code and that the hon
:or system should carry unlimited
, privilege. Others have said that the
| Honor Code is only as good as it is
j practical, and that because of the
! few who will not respect, the privi
leges, checks arc needed, just as
1 civil law is set up to protect the
; many from the few.
The Honor Code Committee wants
ito obtain the sentiments of as many
| students as possible on this ques
tion, as their opinions will deride
i the final interpretation of the Honor
Code.
