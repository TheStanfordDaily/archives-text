# Consul's Wire: Kliatchko Well
## 
### 
A cablegram received last night
at 9:45 from the American consul at
Prague disclosed that Savcl Kliatch
ko, former Stanford student and son
of a Stanford language instructor, is
well and safe following his imprison
ment by the Czech Red police as a
spy.
Kliatchko was seized on a recent
vacation trip in Czechoslovakia by
the police, who doubted the authen
ticity of his papers, although they
were issued by the Czech govern
ment. He was held incommunicado
while charges against him of spying
were being investigated.
The cable to his mother, Mrs. Sar
ra Kliatchko Sabgay, announced
that the incident is considered closed
by the Czech government. However,
United States government sources
yesterday announced that a sharp
formal protest has been lodged by
the American authorities. Czecho
slovakia has as yet made no reply
to the note.
