# The 						Forgotten Man
## 
### 
In the activities focused around President
Sterling's inauguration last week there were
several groups which were actively repre
sented in the proceedings —notably the Board
of Trustees, the alumni, such organizations as
the Stanford Associates, and finally, even the
faculty.
We wonder if anyone noticed the absence
of another interested party. Maybe the alums
and other University bigwigs felt that "every
one who is anyone" in the Stanford family
was present.
But it seemed to us that the Stanford student
was not only not present in any number at
such affairs as the Inaugural Dinner and the
Inauguration itself, but that no one even
seemed to notice his absence.
According to Mr. Paul Edwards, who spoke
at a dinner for Dr. Sterling Thursday night,
the new president was chosen to please three
groups of interested people—the Trustees, the
alumni, and the faculty. I
Don't we count at all?
The crowning blow came, however, when
the president of the Stanford Associates, an or
ganization of moneyed alumni and other in
terested people, took the entire credit for such
student activities as publishing the Frosh
Handbook.
Well, we happen to know that the Frosh
Book was ably edited by a student, Maurine
Bourne, and financed by the ASSU.
Personally, we are getting a little tired of
the manner in which the "interested people"
are running the University. Maybe they don't
do as much harm as it might seem from what
they say, but we do wish that even if they don't
include us in their confidence, they might at
least take the student body into consideration
when they plan for the future of Stanford Uni
versity.
It seems amazing to us that three or four
speakers could orate concerning a university
for two hours and never even mention stu
dents. This happened last week, and we are
convinced it's not unusual at these alumni
gatherings.

We are not advocating that students be al
lowed to administer a large university or any
other such ridiculous plan, but it seems that
certain people have lost sight of the forest
for the trees.
Granted, raising money is a big job in run
ning an independent school, but what is the
purpose of raising money if one forgets what it
is for?
Now we don't want to believe that the Trus
tees and alumni have completely forgotten us,
but we do wish that if they haven't, they'd at
least mention every now and then that they
do have our interests at heart. —M.K.
