# It's Only Money

### 
Well, it's happened again. Nothing new,
just another Row robbery.
This time the Delta Chis were taken for SlOO
or so, nobody seems to know just how much.
Of course, it could have been any of the Row
houses .... they're all a soft touch.
The robberies always follow the same tried
and-true pattern. The thief walks into the
house early in the morning, usually some
time between 2 and 4, strolls from room to
room and empties the wallets conveniently
left on desks and dressers. No strain.
Comes morning. One after another the vic
tims discover their losses. Someone remem
bers hearing footsteps about four o'clock, but
he thought it was just one of the boys coming
in. Everybody's mad. "What a lousy trick."
We agree .... it is a downright lousy trick.
But isn't it amazing, now, to suddenly dis
cover that someone is dishonest .... that
some people do steal.
Fraternity robberies aren't peculiar to Stan
ford alone. All over the country Trusting Joe
College tosses his wallet, watch, and change
on his desk and hits the sack. Just too tired
to put the stuff in a drawer or some out-of-the
way place. And too tired to get up and look
around when he hears footsteps at four o'clock
in the morning.
After all, it's only money. â€”J.L.
