### JHN HALL 
After last Saturday's football game, I turned to
two old friends, both named Haig, to reduee the
pain. And alter the lights had dimmed, I began to
have misty, restless dreams of long ago
Once upon a time there was a young boy named
John. liL lived in Los Angeles

unci at-; whe; ties and puffed rice.
One day his mother walked in
and .said, "I iound two million
dollars :n a black bag in a vacant
lot ye. terduy, and now you can
go to Stanford.
"Hoo.ay," I shouted with my
mouth cl< sod, because as Bill
Stern would say, that young boy
who ati< wheaties and puffed rice
turned out to be me.
"Get dn-ysed," my mother said,

and to down to the drug store to get your transcript
filled."
"Surely," I said, because I figured it was all for
the be-1. "13ut why do you want me to go to Stan
ford?"
"Because," my mama done told me, "A woman's
a two-face, and at Stanford both of them are ugly,
so there will be no distractions and you can study
hard and one day you can become a gas station at

tendant."
Suddenly, my dream was broken by a sharp voice,
"Here's another drink."
"I knew it," I shouted. "You're not my mother,
you're cousin Ethyl, and you hate me because I'm
regular."
I naively muttered, "Is it Scotch?" and was an
swered, "Naw, but it's just as good, it's gin and juice."
"My favorite antidote," I mumbled and swallowed
it in two gulps, two gulps because I am a conserva
tive drinker.
All of a sudden everyone was gone, and I was
dreaming again, only this time it was more like
fits
1 was a football being punted by somebody in a
powder-puff blue shirt and I was rolling and rolling
and people in red were standing all around, but no
body would touch me. Then, when they did touch
me they kept dropping me, and I was unhappy, be
cause being a poor, dumb football I lelt like I didn't
belong to anybody.
I felt like the kid in Australia who bought a new
boomerang and then went crazy trying to throw the
old one away
Once again the mist cleared, and I was back to
reality. Then they carried me home and before I
knew it Sunday had come.

knew it Sunday had come.

After last Saturday's football game, I turned to
two old friends, both named Haig, to reduee the
pain. And alter the lights had dimmed, I began to
have misty, restless dreams of long ago
Once upon a time there was a young boy named
John. liL lived in Los Angeles

unci at-; whe; ties and puffed rice.
One day his mother walked in
and .said, "I iound two million
dollars :n a black bag in a vacant
lot ye. terduy, and now you can
go to Stanford.
"Hoo.ay," I shouted with my
mouth cl< sod, because as Bill
Stern would say, that young boy
who ati< wheaties and puffed rice
turned out to be me.
"Get dn-ysed," my mother said,

and to down to the drug store to get your transcript
filled."
"Surely," I said, because I figured it was all for
the be-1. "13ut why do you want me to go to Stan
ford?"
"Because," my mama done told me, "A woman's
a two-face, and at Stanford both of them are ugly,
so there will be no distractions and you can study
hard and one day you can become a gas station at

tendant."
Suddenly, my dream was broken by a sharp voice,
"Here's another drink."
"I knew it," I shouted. "You're not my mother,
you're cousin Ethyl, and you hate me because I'm
regular."
I naively muttered, "Is it Scotch?" and was an
swered, "Naw, but it's just as good, it's gin and juice."
"My favorite antidote," I mumbled and swallowed
it in two gulps, two gulps because I am a conserva
tive drinker.
All of a sudden everyone was gone, and I was
dreaming again, only this time it was more like
fits
1 was a football being punted by somebody in a
powder-puff blue shirt and I was rolling and rolling
and people in red were standing all around, but no
body would touch me. Then, when they did touch
me they kept dropping me, and I was unhappy, be
cause being a poor, dumb football I lelt like I didn't
belong to anybody.
I felt like the kid in Australia who bought a new
boomerang and then went crazy trying to throw the
old one away
Once again the mist cleared, and I was back to
reality. Then they carried me home and before I
knew it Sunday had come.
