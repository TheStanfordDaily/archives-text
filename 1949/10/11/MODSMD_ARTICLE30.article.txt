# Women to Invade Harvard Next Year
## 
### 
The doors of Harvard Law School
will be open to women for the first
time next year.
Dean Erwin N. Griswold an
nounced last night that a "small
number" of women graduated from
accredited colleges will be eligible
for admittance to the 132-year-old
school in 1950.
"Opportunities for women in law
still are limited, however, and the
faculty is we'l aware that many able
men are turned away from our
doors every year," Dean Griswold
said.
