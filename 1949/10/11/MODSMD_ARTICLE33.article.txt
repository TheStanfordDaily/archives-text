# Janitors Sweep Farm
## 
### PHIL WILCOX 
More than 25 years ago the
American Building Maintenance
Company took over a job which
it has held ever since—that of
cleaning and servicing the
men's dormitories and class
rooms on the Stanford campus.
Original quarters for the ABMC
was an old building south of the
steam plant. In 19155 the company
built the larger bungalow-type
building nearby which now houses
45 of the 58 men employed by the
ABMC. Here the janitors have pri
vate rooms and the facilities of a
kitchen and dining hall within the
present building.
Mr. P. J. Hample, who has been
connected with the A BMC for the
past 25 years, has acted as superin
tendent of the company at Stanford
for the last five years. There are
men such as Peter Poulus, or "Pete,"
as lie i.s known by Eneina men, who
has never been seen to sit down on
the job. Another old-timer at Stan
ford is George Thomas, who has
been working at Memorial Audi
torium ever since it was constructed.
An important duty of the ABMC is
that ol supplying the linen for men's
dormitories. H. C. Beckett, with an
interval in the U.S. Navy during the
last war, has been exchanging linen
and giving back to the offenders
those ink-stained towels for several
years.
Avoided by the majority of the
janitors i.s the job of N. J. Brennan,
who serves as janitor in the Anat
omy Building. Not bothered at all

by the deceased occupants of the
building, Mr. Brennan has the
most unenvied job on campus.
Though a number of the men who
work in janitorial positions on the
Farm remain only short periods of
time, 15 ABMC men have been here
from five to 13 years.
