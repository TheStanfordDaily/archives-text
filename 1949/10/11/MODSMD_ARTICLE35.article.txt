Stanford lost another football game Saturday and that, to a great many
of us students, means a lot. We were going to the Rose Bowl. So Russ
Newland, Bill Leiser, and a whole host of writers who hadn't even seen
Stanford practice, said. We all got excited. This was the year. We couldn't
Jose, etc.
But we did lose. We lost a game we should have won. We have lost
games in past years that we should have won. So have a great many other
schools from Misqually Tech to mighty Michigan. We lost to a UCLA
team that gained but 140 yards for GO minutes of work. We had to give
them two touchdowns to enable them to win.
Public Wants a Winner
Wc are all tired of hearing the old cry of "bad breaks" to explain away
a football loss. Many of us are seniors and we would like to remember
our last year as the year that Stanford went to the Rose Bowl. My high
school football coach once told us during a half time—"You guys are
behind now. If you don't get going you are going to lose. No one likes
a loser. In 10 years you will not be able to say, 'but that was an awlully
good team we lost to on that day.' People don't remember that. All they
remember is that you lost a game. The public wants a winner."
'lhose words have come back to me many times since that day. And I
always want to be able to remember that football isn't always winning.
And it isn't always losing either.
If Stanford had won the game last Saturday all would lie well on the
campus of Leland Stanford Junior University. But we lost and the dining
halls of Encina, Roble, and the Row houses buzz with the talk of "doing
something about it."
That's the Easy Way
Yes, that's the easy way to do it. I could come down here and write
a column that would make everybody who read it say, "now we are getting
.something done." The Daily could print letters to the editor as we are
running today. Our sting of defeat would be lessened and for a while
we would be happy.
And what would be the restul. The team members would fall to fighting
among themselves, and we would go on to lose the greater part of the
games yet to play.
The question that every college sports writer should ask himself in
.situations like this is, "What will be the end result of my tearing into the
team, the coaching staff, and the athletic setup at this time?"
I think the answer is plain. No good would come of it. So I appeal to
all Stanfordites to read and debate the following:
Last year we had a bad year and we didn't like it. This year we have
won two and lost two with six rough games to come. The only disgrace in
losing to UCLA is that we beat them in every way but the scoreboard.
And they don't send you to the Rose Bowl for near misses.
Stanford attracted nation-wide notice for its conduct in the last two
seasons. We lost far more than we won, but we were on the way back
after a "sLudent body" team in 1946.
Let's Be Different
Next week the Saturday Evening Post will come out with an article on
Stanford and its treatment of its coaches in a time that most schools are
firing their mentors.
I don't know what the article will say. We have not received a tear
sheet on it as yet. But I think I am going to be proud of what the author
v/ill say. Stanford alone among the big timers was great enough to realize
that it takes time to build a football team. We gave the 1947 team a plaque.
They lost, but we were proud of them.
Now we are on the threshold of the land of green pastures. Maybe we
will make it this year, maybe next. You don't very often turn a 19-year-old
sophomore into a great vrasity T-l'ormation quarterback in four games.
So, let's bide our time and see. In so doing we will be putting ourselves
above the common run of schools. We have the stuff to go this year or
next. I think it will come about this year. Six wins in a row is not at all
out of the realm of possibility. And if we lose five of those—well then,
let's wait until November 13, a week before the Cal game. If it looks as if
things have not progressed as they should, then we can debate the action
to be taken.
Nothing But Praise
Every writer who covered the UCLA game had nothing but high praise
i'oi the men of the Big Red. Except for those two loose moments that
we bogged down, and the time a holding penalty shoved us back, we might
heve won that ball game.
Stanford will go now. We were not mentally right for Michigan. Why
we lost to UCLA is a mystery to one and all. Our boys will go to Seattle
and give the Husky one helluva battle. Then they come home.
Then let that famed Stanford spirit show itself. Then let us show one and
all that we stand by our boys. We will have time later to settle accounts
if they need be settled.
Now we have the task of winning football games. We will do that. It is
easy to shout and holler that all is lost. It isn't. The right turn of events
could still see Stanford in the Rose Bowl.
If the above sounds like the usual stuff .... it is. We don't like to lose.
But now is not the time to gripe. Maybe at the end of the year we can
look back at our momentary panic and smile. If we can't smile, then we
will take action.
But now—win or lose this week, let's be at the bus to send the team off
and welcome it home. They represent us. They are Stanford.

will make it this year, maybe next. You don't very often turn a 19-year-old
sophomore into a great vrasity T-l'ormation quarterback in four games.
So, let's bide our time and see. In so doing we will be putting ourselves
above the common run of schools. We have the stuff to go this year or
next. I think it will come about this year. Six wins in a row is not at all
out of the realm of possibility. And if we lose five of those—well then,
let's wait until November 13, a week before the Cal game. If it looks as if
things have not progressed as they should, then we can debate the action
to be taken.
Nothing But Praise
Every writer who covered the UCLA game had nothing but high praise
i'oi the men of the Big Red. Except for those two loose moments that
we bogged down, and the time a holding penalty shoved us back, we might
heve won that ball game.
Stanford will go now. We were not mentally right for Michigan. Why
we lost to UCLA is a mystery to one and all. Our boys will go to Seattle
and give the Husky one helluva battle. Then they come home.
Then let that famed Stanford spirit show itself. Then let us show one and
all that we stand by our boys. We will have time later to settle accounts
if they need be settled.
Now we have the task of winning football games. We will do that. It is
easy to shout and holler that all is lost. It isn't. The right turn of events
could still see Stanford in the Rose Bowl.
If the above sounds like the usual stuff .... it is. We don't like to lose.
But now is not the time to gripe. Maybe at the end of the year we can
look back at our momentary panic and smile. If we can't smile, then we
will take action.
But now—win or lose this week, let's be at the bus to send the team off
and welcome it home. They represent us. They are Stanford.

Stanford lost another football game Saturday and that, to a great many
of us students, means a lot. We were going to the Rose Bowl. So Russ
Newland, Bill Leiser, and a whole host of writers who hadn't even seen
Stanford practice, said. We all got excited. This was the year. We couldn't
Jose, etc.
But we did lose. We lost a game we should have won. We have lost
games in past years that we should have won. So have a great many other
schools from Misqually Tech to mighty Michigan. We lost to a UCLA
team that gained but 140 yards for GO minutes of work. We had to give
them two touchdowns to enable them to win.
Public Wants a Winner
Wc are all tired of hearing the old cry of "bad breaks" to explain away
a football loss. Many of us are seniors and we would like to remember
our last year as the year that Stanford went to the Rose Bowl. My high
school football coach once told us during a half time—"You guys are
behind now. If you don't get going you are going to lose. No one likes
a loser. In 10 years you will not be able to say, 'but that was an awlully
good team we lost to on that day.' People don't remember that. All they
remember is that you lost a game. The public wants a winner."
'lhose words have come back to me many times since that day. And I
always want to be able to remember that football isn't always winning.
And it isn't always losing either.
If Stanford had won the game last Saturday all would lie well on the
campus of Leland Stanford Junior University. But we lost and the dining
halls of Encina, Roble, and the Row houses buzz with the talk of "doing
something about it."
That's the Easy Way
Yes, that's the easy way to do it. I could come down here and write
a column that would make everybody who read it say, "now we are getting
.something done." The Daily could print letters to the editor as we are
running today. Our sting of defeat would be lessened and for a while
we would be happy.
And what would be the restul. The team members would fall to fighting
among themselves, and we would go on to lose the greater part of the
games yet to play.
The question that every college sports writer should ask himself in
.situations like this is, "What will be the end result of my tearing into the
team, the coaching staff, and the athletic setup at this time?"
I think the answer is plain. No good would come of it. So I appeal to
all Stanfordites to read and debate the following:
Last year we had a bad year and we didn't like it. This year we have
won two and lost two with six rough games to come. The only disgrace in
losing to UCLA is that we beat them in every way but the scoreboard.
And they don't send you to the Rose Bowl for near misses.
Stanford attracted nation-wide notice for its conduct in the last two
seasons. We lost far more than we won, but we were on the way back
after a "sLudent body" team in 1946.
Let's Be Different
Next week the Saturday Evening Post will come out with an article on
Stanford and its treatment of its coaches in a time that most schools are
firing their mentors.
I don't know what the article will say. We have not received a tear
sheet on it as yet. But I think I am going to be proud of what the author
v/ill say. Stanford alone among the big timers was great enough to realize
that it takes time to build a football team. We gave the 1947 team a plaque.
They lost, but we were proud of them.
Now we are on the threshold of the land of green pastures. Maybe we

halls of Encina, Roble, and the Row houses buzz with the talk of "doing
something about it."
That's the Easy Way
Yes, that's the easy way to do it. I could come down here and write
a column that would make everybody who read it say, "now we are getting
.something done." The Daily could print letters to the editor as we are
running today. Our sting of defeat would be lessened and for a while
we would be happy.
And what would be the restul. The team members would fall to fighting
among themselves, and we would go on to lose the greater part of the
games yet to play.
The question that every college sports writer should ask himself in
.situations like this is, "What will be the end result of my tearing into the
team, the coaching staff, and the athletic setup at this time?"
I think the answer is plain. No good would come of it. So I appeal to
all Stanfordites to read and debate the following:
Last year we had a bad year and we didn't like it. This year we have
won two and lost two with six rough games to come. The only disgrace in
losing to UCLA is that we beat them in every way but the scoreboard.
And they don't send you to the Rose Bowl for near misses.
Stanford attracted nation-wide notice for its conduct in the last two
seasons. We lost far more than we won, but we were on the way back
after a "sLudent body" team in 1946.
Let's Be Different
Next week the Saturday Evening Post will come out with an article on
Stanford and its treatment of its coaches in a time that most schools are
firing their mentors.
I don't know what the article will say. We have not received a tear
sheet on it as yet. But I think I am going to be proud of what the author
v/ill say. Stanford alone among the big timers was great enough to realize
that it takes time to build a football team. We gave the 1947 team a plaque.
They lost, but we were proud of them.
Now we are on the threshold of the land of green pastures. Maybe we
will make it this year, maybe next. You don't very often turn a 19-year-old
sophomore into a great vrasity T-l'ormation quarterback in four games.
So, let's bide our time and see. In so doing we will be putting ourselves
above the common run of schools. We have the stuff to go this year or
next. I think it will come about this year. Six wins in a row is not at all
out of the realm of possibility. And if we lose five of those—well then,
let's wait until November 13, a week before the Cal game. If it looks as if
things have not progressed as they should, then we can debate the action
to be taken.
Nothing But Praise
Every writer who covered the UCLA game had nothing but high praise
i'oi the men of the Big Red. Except for those two loose moments that
we bogged down, and the time a holding penalty shoved us back, we might
heve won that ball game.
Stanford will go now. We were not mentally right for Michigan. Why
we lost to UCLA is a mystery to one and all. Our boys will go to Seattle
and give the Husky one helluva battle. Then they come home.
Then let that famed Stanford spirit show itself. Then let us show one and
all that we stand by our boys. We will have time later to settle accounts
if they need be settled.
Now we have the task of winning football games. We will do that. It is
easy to shout and holler that all is lost. It isn't. The right turn of events
could still see Stanford in the Rose Bowl.
If the above sounds like the usual stuff .... it is. We don't like to lose.
But now is not the time to gripe. Maybe at the end of the year we can
look back at our momentary panic and smile. If we can't smile, then we
will take action.
But now—win or lose this week, let's be at the bus to send the team off
and welcome it home. They represent us. They are Stanford.

Stanford lost another football game Saturday and that, to a great many
of us students, means a lot. We were going to the Rose Bowl. So Russ
Newland, Bill Leiser, and a whole host of writers who hadn't even seen
Stanford practice, said. We all got excited. This was the year. We couldn't
Jose, etc.
But we did lose. We lost a game we should have won. We have lost
games in past years that we should have won. So have a great many other
schools from Misqually Tech to mighty Michigan. We lost to a UCLA
team that gained but 140 yards for GO minutes of work. We had to give
them two touchdowns to enable them to win.
Public Wants a Winner
Wc are all tired of hearing the old cry of "bad breaks" to explain away
a football loss. Many of us are seniors and we would like to remember
our last year as the year that Stanford went to the Rose Bowl. My high
school football coach once told us during a half time—"You guys are
behind now. If you don't get going you are going to lose. No one likes
a loser. In 10 years you will not be able to say, 'but that was an awlully
good team we lost to on that day.' People don't remember that. All they
remember is that you lost a game. The public wants a winner."
'lhose words have come back to me many times since that day. And I
always want to be able to remember that football isn't always winning.
And it isn't always losing either.
