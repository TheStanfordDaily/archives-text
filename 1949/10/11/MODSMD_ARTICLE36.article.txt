# Washington Prepares For Staggering Schwartzmen
## McElhenny Key to Husky Win Chance DAILY Sports 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's erratic gridders, bogged
down deep in the mire of defeat on
their home grounds the last two
weeks, will attempt to parley a
change of scene into a change of
luck this Friday when they journey
to Seattle for a Saturday meeting
with Washington's hapless Huskies.
Just what degree of success they
attain will depend to a large extent
on the condition of the left foot of
one Hugh McElhenny.
The sensational sophomore full
back, who churned the turf for bet
ter than 1,100 yards while perform
ing for Compton Junior College last
year, was the principal offensive
threat in Coach Howie Odell's T
l'ormation attack until he sprained
said foot in the Huskies' losing 48 to
20 battle against Minnesota three
weeks ago.
He has since removed the cast
from the ailing leg, but full reports
on his condition have not yet drifted
southward.
FIVE-FIVE PER
Against Utah's Redskins in the
year's opener, McElhenny piled up
105 yards and averaged 5.5 yards
per crack. The following week he
returned Minnesota's opening kick
off for a 97-yard scoring sprint, and
generally gave the Golden Gophers
quite a few uneasy moments before
going into forced retirement early in
the battle.
Since then, the Huskies' efforts
have met only with frustration.
They had a brief moment of glory
when they led Notre Dame 7 to 0
in the first period of their Seattle
contest, but finally lost that one 27
to 7.
Last Saturday, their tale was even
sadder. Oregon State, a team spiri
tually and physically sick after lop
sided defeats by Cal and UCLA and
a crippling influenza epidemic, slap
ped the Puget Sounders 7 to 3 on a
morale-busting last-quarter teedee.
SAME OLD STORY
To make matters worse, the Se
attle lads, like Stanford the same
afternoon, completely dominated the
battle of the statistics. They out
downed the Beavers 20 to 8, out
rushed them 195 yards to 92, and
out-aerialed them 195 yards to 58.
Had Washington also out-score
boarded the visitors, it would have
been their 100 th PCC victory and
moved them into the select century

club alongside USC. Which means
that the Huskies will still have that
added incentive when they meet our
Cax'ds this Saturday.
McElhenny's replacement at the
fullback slot, Henry Tiedemann, is
another doubtful starter for the
Indian game. Tiedemann, who
clinched Washington's only win of
the year with an 80-yard scoring
romp against Utah, failed to go to
the post against the Beavers; and it
is uncertain at this point whether
he will be ready Saturday.
If neither he nor McElhenny is
sufficiently recovered, Kenny Dunn
will get the starting nod.
The Huskies have two good pass
ers in quarterbacks Don Heinrich

and Don O'Leary, a couple of fancy
Dons according to northern reports.
O'Leary is a transfer from Notre
Dame, while Heinrich is a sopho
more.
VETERAN LINE
Rounding out the starting back
field will be junior halfbacks Roland
Kirkby and Jack Seth. Both are
lettermen, Kirkby performing as a
fullback last year.
Washington's forward wall is
much better stocked with veterans
than its backfie!d, with lettermen
available for every position.
Main scoring threat in the line,
however, is left end Fritz Apking,
a towering sophomore who gained
more yardage on aerials in the Hus
kies' first two games than did their
top receiver during the whole of
last year. The 6-ft. 5-in. Apking
gained 131 yards in the Utah and
Minnesota conclaves.
Offensively at least, Saturday's
clambake thus should be a war of
sophomores, particularly if McEl
henny is prepared to do battle
against Hugasian, Kerkorian, Mc-
Coll, and company.
