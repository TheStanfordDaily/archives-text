# PRACTICE
## Cards Fit For Northern Tilt 
### 
Mondays are blue all over, but the
14 to 7 loss to UCLA was almost
forgotten, by the football team at
least, and things were looking ro ,y
at yesterday's practice session.
Only Mickey Titus is on the in
jured list. A 1 Laakso and Al Rau
were back at work, but colds took
their toll of others. Five men were
missing clue to the flu bug, but all
are expected to be ready for Wash
ington on Saturday. Titus will be
sidelined for several weeks with a
knee injury.
Coach Marchie Schwartz an
nounced several changes in posi
tions. Eric Southwood was moved
from fullback to right half. The big
sophomore has been looking good
ut fullback, but that position is a
hard one to crack what with Emery
Mitchell. Bill DeYoung, and Bud
Klein playing from that spot now.
Southwood's speed and size
should help the right half spot in
the blocking department, for neither
Bob White nor Boyd Benson has
come through with top work during
the last two games.
Jim Hayes was also back in the
fold after missing scrimmage work
since early September. His injured
knee has healed and the hard-luck
back is now available for full-time
duty.
Schwartz also hinted that soph
quarterback Dick Horn wil see ac
tion in the Washington tilt. Sthwartz
figures that both Gary Kerkorian
and Horn need varsity time to be
come top quarters and that the
Washington game is as good a time
as any to let Horn earn his.spurs.
