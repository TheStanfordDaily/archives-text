### ALJEAN LEVIN 
The World Series is over again.
But for nearly a week radios have
! sprouted on the Stanford campus
where only trees grew before. From
the loudspeaker in the Cellar, from
the darkness of parked cars, from
the portables on the lawn in front
, of the library came "It's 1 to 0 in
1 the 9th."
The pennant races were so close
J in both leagues this year that the
i Series, almost an anti-climax, didn't
! cause as much interest as usual,
i Only a few classes were minus their
full quota of students from 10 a.m.
to noon. However, at least one stu
dent in a class on Inner Quad ar
ranged for a friend to walk by the
open window and call in the score
to him at strategic intervals.
The hashers at one of the women's
| dorms used a co-ordinated system.
The white-coated hashers listened
to a portable until it was time to
serve. Then the bus boys bent their
ears to the radios. As trays were

cleared the news was relayed —
along with bottles of rnilk from
sidestand to sidestand by drink
hashers.
The '47 series found nearly 90 per
cent of Farm students rooting for
the Dodgers. This year's surprising
Yankee team had at least 50 per cent
of Farm fans.
Perennial fans packed the Cellar
every noon to listen to the Series.
A loudspeaker relayed the game
into the Cellar dining room and fans
spent the lunch hour over a cup of
coflee. The unaggressive students
who were merely hungry had no
chance.
Probably the most enthusiastic
group of fans were the Daily sports
writers. None of them went to a 10
or 11 o'clock all week.
