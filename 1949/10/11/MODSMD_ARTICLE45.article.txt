# Racial Play Is Coming Soon
## 
### 
"Deep Are the Roots," a play by
Arnaud d'Usseau and James Gow,
will be presented by the Peninsula
Little Theater on November 4, 5, 11,
12, 18, and 19 in the San Mateo Jun
ior College Auditorium.
The play, which deals with the
problem of Negro prejudice in the
South, was written by the same
team who authored the wartime
Broadway hit, "Tomorrow the
World."
According to R. A. Brauns, direc
tor of the production, "Deep Are the
Roots" is a clear-sighted presenta
tion of the racial intolerance prob
lem. As a Broadway production, the
play was the forerunner of such mo
tion pictures as "Lost Boundaries"
and "Home of the Brave."
Tickets for the play went on sale
yesterday and may be obtained by
writing Peninsula Little Theater,
P.O. Box 543, San Mateo.
