# FUNDS RAISED
## Airborne Band Wings To Husky Stadium Saturday 
### 
The dreams of the Stanford Band
marching into the Husky Stadium in
Seattle will finally be turned into a
; reality Saturday, Band Manager
Norm Hamilton announced last
night. His announcement followed
the donation of $600 yesterday by
I various individuals — mostly Stan
| ford alumni.
The news came as somewhat of a
I surprise to the Indian bandsmen,
whose campaign fell short last
! week. Even more of a surprise was
! the fact that the band will sprout
wings and travel in a DC-4.
TIME SAVED
Not only will the traveling time be
: cut from 20 hours round trip to ap
proximately seven hours, but also
the cost has been sliced almost in
half—from an estimated $4,000 to
j $2,500. The rate has been made pos
j sible by special arrangements with
| Ade Lurie, class of '40, now head
| of the University Air Travel Serv
ice.
The four-engine Douglas trans
port, classed as an air coach, has
i been converted from its war-time
capacity of about 40 seats to 73
| seats. Eight of the passengers will
| be students who previously had
j bought tickets for the chartered
! plane. When it became apparent
that a full load would not be avail
able for the "Husky Limited," the
Travel Sex f vice agreed to transport
the Indian musicians at cost.
The trip lay squarely in the hands
j of Manager Hamilton yesterday
i morning when the arrangement was
made with ihe Travel Service and
; Western Airlines. The energetic
| drum section leader went up and
j down the Peninsula contacting
Stanford alumni. The result—sfioo.
Although $500 is still to be raised,
Director Julius Shuchat was sure
last night that the difference could
| be raised this week.

I said, "It will be a great trip for one
of the best bands in Stanford's his
