# Excom to Review Code Interpretation Tonight
## Opposition Is Expressed To Code Reinterpretation 
### 
The proposed Honor Code interpretation
would not serve to strengthen the Code, accord
ing to the majority opinion of students who took
part in yesterday's open discussion of the plan.
The suggested interpretation is:
"Provided that adeguate seating is provided

in the examination room, exams a
may l~e taken out of the room only
with the permission of the instruc
tor."
Twenty-three students partici
pated in the discussion, which was
moderated by the Honor Code Com
mittee. Only live expressed belief
that the plan would strengthen the
Code.
"The purpose of the meeting," said
Donn Wells, Honor Code Standing
Committee chairman, "was to give
interested students a chance to voice
their feelings on the plan. It was
a democratic attempt to bring out
opinions which otherwise might not
have been heard.
SUPPORT LACKING
"It is obvious," Wells continued,
"that no interpretation of the Honor
Code is practicable without the
wholehearted support of the stu
dents. And student opinion at yes
terday's meeting would seem to indi
cate that such support would be
lacking."
The discussion brought out sev
eral reasons why students feel that
the proposed interpretation would
not be advantageous to the Code.
Some said that more rules and regu
lations would weaken the system,
which, they Relieve, depends on vol
untary subscription to the ideals of
the Code.
Many feel that the majority should
not be deprived of the privilege of
taking examinations out of the room,
because of the very few who would
abuse this privilege.
CODE RESPONSIBILITY
The idea that first-person respon
sibility is the essence of the Code,
although second- and third-person
responsibility plays an important
role in the operation of the system,
was expressed by many who took
part in the discussion.
"This interpretation of the Honor
Code was proposed with a view to
strengthening the system," said
Wells, "but the opinions expressed
in the discussion indicated that stu
dents feel the Code, as il is now
functioning, needs no such modi
fication to strengthen it."
