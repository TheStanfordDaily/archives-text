(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of two articles on Japan by
Miss Keatley, Daily Night Kditor,
who has just returned from a three
months' visit in that country. Her
father, Colonel E. E. Keatley, is

Civil Affairs Team.)

Japan is often called "Topsy Turvy
Land," a name which aptly describes
it, since there arc a great many
; customs which differ radically from
; those of the United States.
For instance, let's consider trav
i cling. The 200 miles that it takes
; four hours to cover in California
J would take a whole day in Japan.
The roads are very narrow and usu
ially unpaved. The main highway in
jJapan is really little more than an
alley in some places, and when a
car comes from the opposite direc
tion, you have to stop in the widest
place possible while the other car
: inches by.
. .
Driving is, of necessity, very slow
because there are so many bicycles
and people 011 the road. Most Japa
j nc.so- are not aware of automobiles
and they never look for cars when
they decide to cross the street they
just barge right 011 across. Thus, it's
up to the driver to watch out for
the people and no cars ever drive
over HO miles an hour.
The Japanese ears are very un
usual. They arc either very small,
like the English Austin, or run 011
kerosene that is burned in a tank
in the back of the cars. Gasoline is
not available.
CHIPS RUN TRUCKS
Heavy trucks use little chips of
wood as fuel. A large barrel is
placed in back of the cab of the
truck, and every hour the truck

stops and the driver gets out to ,
"stoke up." Ho fills the tank with j
two-inch cubes of wood and starts
the fire. Smoke billows out on the
road, covering the area around the
truck for about 30 feet. When the
fire is going strong, the driver gets j
back into the cab and starts on his
journey.
The cars drive on the left side of
the road in Japan, a custom bor
rowed from the English. I didn't j
think I would ever get used to it j
until I returned to the States and
had such a time when I looked the
wrong way for cars, and then real
ized one was hearing down on me
from the opposite direction.
Another interesting sidelight on
driving in Japan is that all the chil- j
drcn wave at the American ears and
expect to get an answer. The only
English words they know are "Hal
lo" and "Good-bye," and they shout
it at all passers-by.
"OLD LOOK" PREVAILS
They Japanese people no longer
wear their kiminos to work in, but
contrary to reports, both men and
women do wear them a great deal
in the evenings and for special oc
casions. Since silk is too expensive
for the people to buy now, they
tend to conserve their pre-war
clothing.
Western style pants and shirts are
I the usual daytime garb for the men
| in the towns, while the women wear
* blouses and skirts, which are defin-
Uely "old look." Many Japanese
I men wear knee-length pants and
j long socks.
Out in the country the Japanese
revert lo their own fashions. The
J women who work in the rice pad
dies are picturesque in blue and
j white cheeked baggy pants, and a
I blouse in a contrasting print, A head

. scarf topped by a huge rice-straw
hat, and a strip of bamboo matting
strapped on the back complete the
costume.
Another familiar sight in Japan is
the working man in his blue cotton
I happi coat with the name of the
company for which he works im
printed in white characters on the
back. The happi coat is provided
for the workers by the company,
much as a garage here provides
j overalls for its mechanics.
LANGUAGE TROUBLES
The majority of the Japanese
speak no English, thus communica
tion with them is very difficult, as
their language is constructed and
pronounced in a completely different
lashion from English. For example,
the English word "No" is the oign
for the possessive in Japanese. So
when you don't want them to do
something, and scream "No," they
look at you blankly, thinking what
is this person doing, shouting the
sign for the possessive case. It is
very exasperating.
There are two kinds <>112 religion
in Japan, Buddhism and Shlntoism.
The majority of the people adhere
to both beliefs, as the former has to
! do with life after death and the
latter to the worship of the Gods of
Nature which figure in the legends
of Japan.
SHINTO FESTIVALS
There is a Shinto festival in every
little town about once a week. All
the children and the young men par
ticipate in these merry-makings
which consist in part of carrying
portable .shrines down the streets of
the town.
The young men come first carry
ing their heavy gold shrine and
! weaving back and forth chanting
I some kind of song as they make

their way up the road. In fact, the
shrine is so heavy they have to stop
every now and then and have a
drink of "sake." a potent wine made
of rice, to keep up their strength.
By tl ie end of the day, they aren't
just weaving because of the dancc.
Next come the little boys from six
to 10 years old, carrying their own
shrine and doing their very best to
ape their older brothers. Last arc
the boys and girls under six pulling
a smaller shrine.
Everyone wears costumes on fes
tival day. The men and boys who
carry the shrines wear blight happi
coats and short pants, or else tuck
up their kimonos. They paint their
fac6s white, though often they just
put white on their noses, so that
they will look longer. The little girls
wear their best kiminos.
ORNATE TEMPLES
The Buddhist temples arc very
majestic and serene. Built in the
usual Oriental style with curving
pagodas and tile roofs, they arc al
ways large. Two wooden figures of
Gods about 15 feet, high guard the
gates to all the big temples. The
perfection of the work, which must
have teen done by hand about 000
years ago, is remarkable.
Another interesting part of re
ligion in Japan is that the people tie
messages to their ancestors on the
limbs of the trees in the temple
grounds. It is very strange to see
the trees covercd with these little
bits of papers which look as if
they've been there for years.
My main impression of Japan was
its oldness. This stands out in spite
of the clTects of the war and Japan's
widening contact with th'e rest of
the world. The people continue to
follow traditions started many thou
sand years ago.
