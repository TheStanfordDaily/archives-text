# A 						Bawlout Card File
## 
### 
Beyond doubt, our University Directory, or
"bawlout," is a handy booklet. But it has its
limitations.
Suppose a visitor to Stanford wants to lo
cate a friend. He has no Bawlout, of course.
There is a file available in Building A-60, but
it is behind the counter and cannot be used
without disrupting the staff, ft does no good at
all after office hours.
We propose that a card file with names and
addresses of all students be placed in some
convenient location for the use of all. Several
advantages would result:
1. It would be an aid to visitors in locating
friends.
2. Class schedules could be included. This
would be helpful for finding students during
the day.

3. Home addresses of students could be
given.
4. The file would be corrected each quarter,
since a new card would be made out. It would
be available in the first weeks of autumn quar
ter before the Bawlout is printed.
These cards could be filled out on Reg Day
and turned in with the reg books. Probably
the cards should be separate from the books,
and larger.
The question of where to put the file is a
problem. If we still had an administration
building, its lobby would be the ideal place.
As things stand, perhaps the Union or near the
shop at the old Memorial Arch would do.
Anyway, it's an idea worth considering.
