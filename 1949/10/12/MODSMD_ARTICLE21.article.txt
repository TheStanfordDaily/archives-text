# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
For no reason at all, except that they gave me a
free dinner lust night, I would like to put in a plug
for the ATO Hog Wallow to be held at Mangini's
Bam next Saturday night.
The Hog Wallow, which is a combination riot and

dance, will be one of those affairs
to which you take a flask of wine,
:i book of verse, and sow.
At any rate, the Hog Wallow
lias become a great campus at
traction, and (How'm I doing
Downing?) one of the more en
joyable of the usual campus run
of-the-mill get togethers.
In case you didn't know, the
ATO's are the Alpha Tau Ome
gas and they blend together to
make up what is known as a

fraternity. A fraternity is a group of persons who
brag they are "Brothers NOT by blood, BUT by
actual choice." Unfortunately, some of the choices
turn out to be pretty bloody.
No matter. It is the Hog Wallow with which we

are concerned. And it is always a good dance be
cause the ATO's go all-out to make it so. Last year
they all dated pigs just to keep in the spirit of
things.
One ATO in particular complained that his last
date turned out to be like a String of Pearls—
Necklace, that is. But what could he do, he couldn't
choker? (Look out for these, they're tricky.)
Anyway, all roads will be leading to Mangini's
Saturday night. There's no tariff, and everybody on
and off campus is invited. So, if you like bogs, horses,
cows, and girls, e'mon out and wallow with the ATO's.

One good plug deserves another, so I'd like to pass
the word that "Lost Boundaries" is a flick worth
seeing. Not flashed around like its predecessor,
"Home of the Brave," it deals with racial prejudice
in much more adult manner.
Other movies around the town these days are
having a rough time. Such as the Carson-Morgan
mistake now taking place at the Stanford. It's sup
posed to be a gag picture, and I guess it succeeds
because that's what everybody does when they see it.
