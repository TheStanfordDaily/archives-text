## The 						German Question 
### 
To the Editor:
In reference to Miss Gytel's letter, with its bitter
hatred of the German people, I must confess that
as a Stanford student I am deeply ashamed of her
sentiments.
I am a student from England. Although we in
London did not suffer as much as Miss Gytel, or as
much as Fritz Marguiles, still I feel that the three
of us belong, with the rest of humanity, to a common
class of sufferers for the follies of war.
Is it possible that this suffering has again been in
vain? Miss Gytel's letter suggests that we shall
never, never learn the universal lav/ of love and
forgiveness.
I would like to question if Miss Gytel is qualified
to pass judgment on the Germans, considering that
she is guilty of much extreme hatred herself. Hate is
lb* cause of war and atrocities, and is certainly not
characteristic of a morally sound and reliable person.
I would suggest to Miss Gytel that Fritz Marguiles
proved by his reply to her letter that, here at Stan
lord, we have at least one German student who has
the integrity and humility essential to true democ
racy.
I know I speak for the majority of Stanford stu
dents when I say to Fritz Margulies: "Welcome to
Stanford, Fritz. We are proud to have you as a mem
ber of our Farm family. We brought you to Stan
ford because we believe that you particularly can
help us to learn that basic principle of democracy:
"love your neighbor as yourself."
