If all Germans felt as you do, Mr. Margulies, the
world would not be confronted with a German prob
lem as it txists today. Unfortunately, Germans like
you are few and far between.
However, it is not hatred that is involved. It is
justice. The very fundamentals of criminal law (and
we do agree that crime is involved) demand a
punishment l'or a crime. Such measures are neces
sary in order to give the guilty an opportunity to
realize that he has committed a wrong, and time to
think how br j .st he can rectify his wrongdoing. If all
is forgotten and forgiven the next day, there is no
time to repent. And the time that elapsed between
the two world wars has proved that quick forgive
ness is not the answer.
But until the Americans get unbiased speakers to
present the German situation to them, they can
hardly hi I lamed for attempting to solve the problem
.in a manner which in the end will prove to be no
solution at all.
