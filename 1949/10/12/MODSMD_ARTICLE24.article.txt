To the Editor:
'Ihank you for the credit tag on the Frosh Bible.
I'm afraid, however, that you and the student body
as a whole do not realize that some of those very
"higher-ups" that you criticized in yesterday's edi
torial lor neglecting the students are particularly
interested in bridging that gap between students
and administrators. In particular, Dean Kimpton,
Tom Carpenter, Walt Peterson, and Fred Glover
.'.pent, very willingly, their time and funds to incor
porate into the Handbook an eight-page illustrated
section on "How Rich Is Stanford?" in which they
do not try to solicit funds but to acquaint the stu
dents with the financial problems of our University.
We of the "Bible" staff appreciate greatly their in
terest. We got a lot out of reading it—why don't you?
