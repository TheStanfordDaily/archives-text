# A 						Rooter Has His Say

To the Editor:
After Saturday's game with UCLA, I heard the
usual post mortem quarterbacks with tl* usual "they
were lucky," "they got all the breaks." The truth
of the matter is that Stanford was the lucky one;
lucky the score wasn't much higher against them.
Bill Stein's saying, that a football team makes its
own breaks, applied to the game Saturday as well as
it did to the Michigan game. If Stanford expects to
win footbc.ll games by getting the breaks, then n
better start making them or else get out of the PCC
and play the various gil ls''schools in the country.
I won't attempt to delve into all the faults shown
by the team to this date, but I would like to point
out one main factor that is keeping them from scor
ing on teams that play hard and fast. This factor is
the decided lack of blocking. Keep in mind that
blocking means to remove an opponent completely
from the play in progress. Just nudging him with a
shoulder is not blocking when he Ls able to tackle the
ball-carrier or even slow him up. Obviously the best
way effectively to block an opponent is to put him
on the ground so that the ball-carrier can elude his
grasping fingers with less trouble.
The lack of blocking was so obvious in the Michigan
game that I thought surely it would be noticed and
corrected. Evidently it wasn't.
Due to sparse, ineffectual, and, in some cases, no
blocking at all, a Stanford ball-carrier was one man
against 11 in both this past game and the Michigan
game. Lack of blocking showed more clearly when
v/e received a kickoff. The ball is in the air and the
Stanford forward line moves back to form a wall
around the ball-carrier. But do they block down
opposition for him? NO! In several instances, not
one would-be tackier was blocked.
Since I came to Stanford I have heard a lot of
moaning and groaning about Stanford's football luck
with their injuries, lack of material, etc., etc. Bull
loney. Stanford has plenty of fine material in all
positions, but for some reason they are not absorb
ing good training in the fundamentals.
There is more to football, winning football, that is,
than just running out on the field in a shiny uni
form. You have to match your wits with the guy in
the position opposite you and if he knows more of
the basic fundamentals and tricks than you do, he
can make you look silly. I have also heard from
many sources that some of the coaches don't take a
serious interest in the team and wander around dur
ing practice with their hands in their pockets.
Whether this is true or not is not for me to say
because I don't know. But I will say, judging from
past performances, that the lessons of whoever
i*-" supposed to be teaching the team the fundamentals
of blocking are not sticking in the players' minds.
Don't take my word lor this lack of blocking, but go
see the game movies Thursday. Instead of watching
the ball-carrier trying to run back a kick, count the
number of UCLA men blocked out. My guess is that
you won't get a grand total of five for the whole
game. Then, when UCLA is on the offense, keep
your eye on one of their men and then compare their
teamwork with ours. You will see why I said that
Stanford was lucky.
Next Saturday you will find me in the rooters'
section again, yelling myself hoarse, but if I still need
more than two hands of fingers to count all the
tacklers left standing when we receive a kickoff, I
am returning my other tickets for a refund. Even if
we do luck out over Cal with no blocking, it still
will be a disappointment (o us who regard football
as a game of skill.

Don't take my word lor this lack of blocking, but go
see the game movies Thursday. Instead of watching
the ball-carrier trying to run back a kick, count the
number of UCLA men blocked out. My guess is that
you won't get a grand total of five for the whole
game. Then, when UCLA is on the offense, keep
your eye on one of their men and then compare their
teamwork with ours. You will see why I said that
Stanford was lucky.
Next Saturday you will find me in the rooters'
section again, yelling myself hoarse, but if I still need
more than two hands of fingers to count all the
tacklers left standing when we receive a kickoff, I
am returning my other tickets for a refund. Even if
we do luck out over Cal with no blocking, it still
will be a disappointment (o us who regard football

To the Editor:
After Saturday's game with UCLA, I heard the
usual post mortem quarterbacks with tl* usual "they
were lucky," "they got all the breaks." The truth
of the matter is that Stanford was the lucky one;
lucky the score wasn't much higher against them.
Bill Stein's saying, that a football team makes its
own breaks, applied to the game Saturday as well as
it did to the Michigan game. If Stanford expects to
win footbc.ll games by getting the breaks, then n
better start making them or else get out of the PCC
and play the various gil ls''schools in the country.
I won't attempt to delve into all the faults shown
by the team to this date, but I would like to point
out one main factor that is keeping them from scor
ing on teams that play hard and fast. This factor is
the decided lack of blocking. Keep in mind that
blocking means to remove an opponent completely
from the play in progress. Just nudging him with a
shoulder is not blocking when he Ls able to tackle the
ball-carrier or even slow him up. Obviously the best
way effectively to block an opponent is to put him
on the ground so that the ball-carrier can elude his
grasping fingers with less trouble.
The lack of blocking was so obvious in the Michigan
game that I thought surely it would be noticed and
corrected. Evidently it wasn't.
Due to sparse, ineffectual, and, in some cases, no
blocking at all, a Stanford ball-carrier was one man
against 11 in both this past game and the Michigan
game. Lack of blocking showed more clearly when
v/e received a kickoff. The ball is in the air and the
Stanford forward line moves back to form a wall
around the ball-carrier. But do they block down
opposition for him? NO! In several instances, not
one would-be tackier was blocked.
Since I came to Stanford I have heard a lot of
moaning and groaning about Stanford's football luck
with their injuries, lack of material, etc., etc. Bull
loney. Stanford has plenty of fine material in all
positions, but for some reason they are not absorb
ing good training in the fundamentals.
There is more to football, winning football, that is,
than just running out on the field in a shiny uni
form. You have to match your wits with the guy in
the position opposite you and if he knows more of
the basic fundamentals and tricks than you do, he
can make you look silly. I have also heard from
many sources that some of the coaches don't take a
serious interest in the team and wander around dur
ing practice with their hands in their pockets.
Whether this is true or not is not for me to say
because I don't know. But I will say, judging from
past performances, that the lessons of whoever
i*-" supposed to be teaching the team the fundamentals
of blocking are not sticking in the players' minds.
