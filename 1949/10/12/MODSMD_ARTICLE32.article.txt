# Stork Brings New Fans to Rossotti's
## 
### JOHN BUSH 
A double-barreled attraction to
delight the hearts of those attending
the fall elbow-bending term at Ros
sotti's was disclosed this week by
Aland Leo Mandoli, proprietors of
the fabled resort.
The surprise came in the form of
two baby daughters, one for each of
the local characters, born within less
than a month of each other.
September 10 heralded the ap
pearance to mortal eyes of the first
of the new additions to Farm soci
ety, in the person of Bernadine Ann
Mandoli. She was born to Ida, wife
of younger brother Leo, at Palo Alto
Hospital.
And last Friday the orie - eyed
stork was seen hovering over the
same hospital, bringing with him
Diane, first child of Aland "Dee."
The baby, born about a month and
a half prematurely, is doing well in
the hospital's incubator. At birth
she weighed GV2 pounds.
Both babies are the first for their
parents. No confirmation has been
received on the inevitable rumor
that they will shortly be weaned to
Acme, and later to some Eastern
formula.
