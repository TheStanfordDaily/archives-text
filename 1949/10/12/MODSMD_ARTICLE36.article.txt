their belts yesterday afternoon in
preparation for their second PCC
game of the year against the Wash

The coaching staff emphasized
blocking during the workout. Phil

low and hard, and the backs were
told to make their blocks stick.
Dick Horn and Gary Kerkoran led
the varsity in a rugged scrimmage
against the jayvees. Harry Huga
sian, Boyd Benson, and John Banks
ran well, and Horn was hitting his
receivers with great regularity.

plays against the regular defensive
unit. The defenders broke up many
plays and generally gave a good ac
count of themselves.
Despite the ferocity of the work
out there were no serious injuries,
although several of the boys were
temporarily disabled by hard blocks
and tackles.
