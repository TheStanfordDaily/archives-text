## Midweek Musings 
### 
We saw a one-man football team
in action Saturday. A one - man
teaip that expects to go to the Rose
Bowl.
That's the part that doesn't make
sense. -
The 45,000 some - odd persons
who watched Stanford's fumhlnig
Indians get themselves Johnson
waxed by UCLA last week came
away convinced that the Bruins
do not have a championship team.
They licked Stanford, true. But
they looked like anything but
champions in so doing. It was
simply a case of a mediocre team
heating one which was completely
ineffective, scoreboard - wise at
least, on that particular day.
But those 45,000 fans were also
convinced of something else. Name
ly, that Ernie Johnson is far and
away the best back to churn the turf
of Stanford Stadium this year.
Johnson was the difference between
the two teams Saturday, just as he'll
be the difference in any game the
Westwooders win in 1949.
Energetic Ernie isn't abnormal
ly fast. He's a slower runner than
a good many less effective ball -
toters. He isn't powerful: Ernie
wouldn't weigh more than 170
pounds after being dipped in mo
lasses. Ami he isn't a great pass
er. although he is a better one
than his two completions Satur
day would indicate.
When Coach Sanders of the Bru
ins was interviewed after the game,
he summed up the ease of Johnson
by remarking that Ernie is "quicker
than he is fast."
That explains the situation
rather well. Johnson is shifty,
he's clever, and he's just fast
enough to make those qualities
pay off with compound interest.
He's also a fine pass defender and
tackier when the Bruins need his
services on defense.
Pity the poor Bruins if something
should happen to Ernie Johnson.

On the whole, Sanders was about
as unresponsive to the questions of
the press as he could be while still
being decent about it.
Red. whose hair paradoxically is
a battleship gray, took a long
time answering most of the que
ries. And when he finally re
sponded in his deep Southern
drawl, it was usually with two or
three words.
One question he refused to answer

altogether. One writer asked the j
Bruin coach if he thought UCLA
had been lucky in winning from the I
Indians. Sanders lowered his head, 1
said nothing, and the question was [
repeated. Still no answer.
Sanders mentioned only one Stan- j
fcrd player having'turned in an out- |
standing game. That was Bill De-
Young, whose off - tackle smashes j
weer cited by the Westwood men- j
tor.
One of Red's assistants, how
ever, realized that Russ Pomeroy
had performed brilliantly on de
fense, while another aide tossed
in a bouquet for Rupe Andrews'
fourth-quarter showing.

We've been hearing a lot about
bad breaks here at the Farm lately;
but this corner's nomination for the <
hard-luck outfit of the conference \
goes to the Washington Huskies, the i
Schwartzmen's target for the week.
Things looked fairly rosy for
the lads from the shores of Lake
Union when the season opened.
Quite a few veteran linemen re
turned, and the backfield could
boast of outstanding sophomores
in Hugh McElhenny and Don
Heinrich, a top - notch parsing
transfer from Notre Dame in Don
O'Leary, two veteran junior half
backs, and a fullback Ictterman,
Henry Tiedemann, to back up
McElhenny.
So they played their first game, I
and won it on an 80-yard sprint by
Tiedemann. About this time Life
magazine came out with the predic- |
tion that Washington would rank '
alongside USC and Cal as Rose
Bowl threats.
Full of confidence, they jour
neyed cast to do battle with Min
nesota's Golden Gophers. Condi
tions looked even brighter when
speedster McElhenny trotted J)7
yards with the opening kickoff to
rocket the Huskies into a 7 to I)
lirst-minute lead.
What happened is old stuff by
now. McElhenny sprained his foot,
Minnesota won 48 to 20, and the j
Odellmen went home to prepare for \
Notre Dame without their soph sen- j
sation.
Even against the Irish, Wash
ington managed their customary
7-0 first-quarter lead. But they
eventually lost 27-7, and Heinrich
and regular left half Roland Kirk
by were damaged in the process.
Then, while they were getting ;
ready for the conference opener i
against Oregon State, second-string ;
fullback Tiedemann was put out of
condition during a practice scrim- j
mage.
Battered and bruised though
they were, the Huskies valiantly
outplayed the Beavers for the full
sixty minutes only to lose 7-15.
And if you think Stanford had
quite a statistical edge on UCLA, j
take a look at the Washington-OSC
figures when you get a chance.
For the Stanford game, McEl
henny is still a question mark.
Tiedemann is definitely out. We
haven't received the latest reports
on the rest of the injuries, but you
can bet they have some more.
So it shouldn't be a matter of
which team the best breaks
Saturday. It'll be which one fcets
the fewer bad breaks.
