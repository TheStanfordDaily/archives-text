PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia — Com
munist police roundups threw a fear
bordering on hysteria into many of
Czechoslovakia's 3,000,000 people to
night.
Although the tempo of arrests ap
peared to he receding from its peak
of last work in Prague, many land
lords, architects, confectioners, and
small shopkeepers were still being
picked up and their businesses con
fiscated. In some cases their apart
ments were seized and their families
dispossessed.
The main drive appeared to be
against the propertied classcs, but
the widespread arrests, reaching
through Bohemia and Moravia, were
accompanied by purges of govern
ment employees,! the clergy, army,
and even the Communist ranks. Slo
vakia, as yet. appeared untouched
by any extraordinary wave of ar
rests.
The charges — where any were
made — ranged from high treason
and sympathy with Titoism or
"Western imperialism" to simple
denunciations by snoopers who had
overheard suspicious bits of conver
sation.
