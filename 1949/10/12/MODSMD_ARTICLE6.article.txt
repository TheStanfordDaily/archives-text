# Buck Says Britain Faces Worst Crisis in History
## Social Services Prove Expensive 
### 
Great Britain is now passing
through the worst crisis of her his
tory, worse even than the German
bombings in 1940-d 1, Dr. Philip W.
Buck, Stanford professor of political
scince, told a Tuesday Evening Sc
ries audience last night in Memorial
Auditorium. He was speaking on
"British Socialism,
"The British economic crisis is es
pecially dangerous because it, is
such an unexciting battle," he ex
plained to bis listeners, "and if they
can get out of tne tight box they
are in now there is certainly some
thing special about the British peo
ple."
Recently returned to the campus
after a year's sabbatical leave in the
London area, Dr. Buck placed him
self in the role of both a professor
and an "on-the-spot" journalist as
he reported on living conditons and
government problems in the British
Isles.
"The situation today is not very
encouraging," he said, "but at the
same time it is not hopelessly dis
couraging. Production and exports
are up, over half the total popula
tion is employed, general health is
at a very high level, and the ra
tioning program is working with
precision and accuracy.
"The British public, as a whole, is
alert, and well informed on public
issues."
On the other side of the lodger,
! Dr. Buck pointed out that today
there is considerable conflict among
j various interest groups, costs and
| prices are still rising, taxes are un
| usually high, and the eost, of the
various social services is very large.
The question of whether the La
borites are spending their money as
productively as possible is yet to be
answered, Dr. Buck contended.
"This is true of the entire social
istic program," he said. "It is too
j early yet to judge the worth of So
! oia'ism in Britain."
Reviewing government, policies,
| Dr. Buck reminded his audience
j that most of the major policies of
j the Labor government were begun,
in one form or another, by earlier
Conservative governments. Health
j and unemployment insurance, the
| nationalization of radio, and the ex
tension of the educational system
| are among the reforms instituted by
Conservatives and carried on by the
i I.aborit.es today.
"I l should also be remembered
that the Laborite program is an ex
j trcmely cautious one," he said. "It
is a moderate program and one that
is profoundly democratic. If the
I people do not consent to Labor poli
j eies, they are perfectly willing to
sec another government come into
I power."
