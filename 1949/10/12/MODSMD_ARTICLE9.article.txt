# Stern Basement Flooded
## Blame Laid To Faulty Water Tank 
### CHUCK SCARLOTT 
Stern Hall kitchen nearly
floated away yesterday — the
crowning blow to the dorm
which is reluctantly earning the
right to be called "the hard luck
hall."
Yesterday morning a clay before
the linoleum layers were to return
to work, ending a seven-week strike,
a storeroom worker arrived in the
Stern kitchen to find the basement
flooded by four feet of water. A
complete stock of new equipment,
newly arrived and unpacked, was
either submerged or floating about
on a sea of debris—including, iron
ically, signs warning of "wet paint."
Cartons containing china soup
howls had dissolved, disgorging their
contents to bob about incongruously
amongst bakers' paddles which took
on the appearance of oars drifting
about on the scene of a ship sinking.
The flood was caused by a water
softener tank which "blew a gasket,"
according to Miss Christine Ricker,
director of dining halls.
Fire Chief John Marsten, working
all day long with George Green,
foreman of the Corporation Yard la
borers, succeeded in pumping the
basement dry of its 125,000-gallon
soakinjf by late afternoon. But the
big job, that of cleaning up the
mess, remains.
Afl iron work is badly rusted and
must be cleaned, in addition to haul
ing out and replacing the ruined
supplies which range from paper
napkins to the freight elevator.
Miss Ricker, who worked a 12-
hour day along with Marsten and
Green in an effort to open the kitch
en for use with as little delay as
possible, said that the precise extent
of the damage is not yet known. The
loks is covered by insurance.
She added that although nothing
could be said until the damage is
more closely surveyed, "We hope to
open the kitchen in four or five
days as planned."
Until that time, the occupants of
Stern Hall will continue to compete
with Encina, Toyon, Crothers, and
off-campus men in creating confu
sion at ever-crowded Encina Din
ing Hall.


THAR SHE FLOATS—A leaky water tank poured forth come 125,000 gallons of water in the
kitchen of Stern Hall (circled) yesterday. At one time the water level measured four feet in
the basement of the new men's dormitory. New kitchen equipment that was to be installed
in the dining room was damaged by the high water.
