### 
All of! - campus freshmen should
have their Quad pictures taken to
day. Today is also the deadline for
Toyon and Encina freshmen.
Men must wear coats and ties;
women, white blouses. Proofs for all
Roble and Branner pictures must be
picked up, chosen, and returned by
Friday, or the Quad photographer
will make his own choice of the
picture to be printed both in the
Quad and in the frosh yearbook.
The office is open from 10 to 12 in
the morning and from 1 to 4 in the
afternoon. Price is $1.
