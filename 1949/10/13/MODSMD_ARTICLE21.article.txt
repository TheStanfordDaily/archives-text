## 
### 
Funeral services were being ar
l ranged yesterday for 42 - year - old
John Beverly Preston, former Stan
j ford football star and a pilot with
â–  the Flying Tigers in China during
| the war.
Preston committed suicide by tak
ing poison yesterday at his home at
fi2 Churchill Avenue in Palo Alto.
His body was discovered about noon
by his father.
Preston suffered a spine injury
several years ago in a plane crash,
and was being treated at the time
of his death. He was never able to
| fly again, and it is believed that
j the knowledge that his aviation ca
| reer was ended forced him to sui
| cide.
Glenn (Pop) Warner, former
I Stanford football coach, described
Preston as one of the greatest ends
he had ever eoachcd, and a splendid
fellow off the field.
Preston was a regular on the
j Stanford teams of 1927-28-29. After
Ihe war he became an instructor at
! Palo Alto Airport. Since the plane
crash, he had been increasingly de
' spondent over his failing health.
