# Econ Students Move Portola Curve Sign to Gurley's Office
## 
### 
That 10-foot yellow road sign at
the foot of the basement stairs in
the History Building is definitely not
a prc-Hallowccn stunt. "
Civic - minded Econ 2 students
painstakingly removed the structure
from its former position on the Por
tola Road curve in response to a
half-hour outburst by Econ Instruc
tor J. E. Gurlcy last week.
Said Gurlcy, who lives just be
yond the curve, "At least two or
three people are killed there every
year because of that It seems
that the CAA marker showed a
straight road ahead after the first

small curve. and completely ignored
the sharp bend in the road. This
was dangerous'y misleading to driv- j
crs, even if they hadn't been near |
Rossotti's.
Even so. Gurley scarcely expected
to find the sign in his office early i
Monday morning, "although I did j
hope something of the sort would j
happen."
He has been quick to suggest to
that same 12 o'clock class that the
unidentified sign movers contact of
ficials in Redwood Cily and get a ;
correct marker put up.
But now Gurley has a new worry, j
'Just how did they get that thiny i
into mv locked office?"
