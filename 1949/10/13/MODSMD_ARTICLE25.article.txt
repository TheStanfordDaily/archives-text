# Code Change Dropped At Chairman's Request
## $160 Voted Conditionally to Boost Band Funds for Northern Expedition 
### 
Proposed Honor Code interpretation submitted to Excom lor
approval was withdrawn last night at the request of Donn Wells,
Honor Code Standing Committee chairman.
"Without 100 per cent support by the students, no interpreta
tion of the Honor Code would be practicable," said Wells. "And

| it is obvious that such support of
! this interpretation would be lack
i ing."
The suggested Code interpretation
staled that "provided adequate scat-
I ing is provided in the examination
room, exams may be taken out of
j the room only with the permission
of the instructor."
Excom held a straw vote follow
ing discussion and withdrawal of
j the proposition, unanimously vot
ing against the suggested interpre

tation or any compromise interpre
tation.
Excom voted to appropriate $100
for the fund to send the band to
Seattle ior the Washington name
Saturday, providing the band se
cures the additional $100 needed for
the trip.
Norm Hamilton, band manager,
explained that $2,320 is the sum
needed to finance the trip, and that
$2,000 has already been contrib
uted.
Excom's vote on the appropriation
was deadlocked at five for and five
against, with ASSU President Ilank
Rosin's vote deciding the issue.
Excom also voted to invest in the
University Investment Fund $45,000,
or any part thereof, of the ASSU

John Lilienthal, would yield a re
turn of 4.32 per cent annually.
