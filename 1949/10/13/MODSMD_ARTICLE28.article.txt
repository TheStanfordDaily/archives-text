# Making Deferred Rushing Work
## 
### 
Frosh men, in case you haven't heard, will
not be welcome at the ATO Hog Wallow this
Saturday, or at any other fraternity-sponsored
all-campus social function this quarter.
This is unfortunate. It is always unfortunate
when any person or groups of persons on
campus is told to stay home from an "all
campus" party.
But the restriction, a long standing one im
posed to keep contact between freshmen and
fraternity men to an irreducible minimum, is
absolutely necessary to make Stanford's de
ferred rushing program work.
No social contact of any sort is permitted
until formal rushing season starts at the be
ginning of winter quarter. This means that
freshmen may not enter a fraternity house for
any reason, and that fraternity men must stay
out of Encina and other University living
groups until rush season starts.
Such a rule must be enforced if all frater
nities and frosh are to have an equal chance
when rush season formally starts.
The Stanford pre-rush "contact" problem is
a unique one.
At most universities throughout the country

it is the practice to begin rushing new students
immediately upon their arrival on campus. As
a result, these prospective members do not
have an opportunity to become adjusted to
campus life and their studies before rushing
and pledging begin.
Stanford men have the time to gain an ade
quate perspective from which to look over the
fraternity system before rushing begins; and
their first-year stay at Encina or with mem
bers of their class at the Village enables them
to make valuable contacts which will carry
over during later years.
Rushing here was for many years deferred
until the middle of fall quarter, but in 1941 it
was decided that the social program was too
full at that time of the year, and rush season
was set back to its present spot in winter
quarter. With the lengthening of the period of
deferment, the "contact" problem became ac
cordingly more difficult.
The need for a ruling which keeps freshmen
and fraternity men apart during this deferred
period is obvious. It should be the responsi
bility of every frosh and every fraternity man
to see that Stanford's desirable deferred rush
ing system works.
