# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Hello, you happy Stanford Rooters:
Yesterday as I walked into The Daily Shack with a
happy smile and a Saturday Evening Post, I was
met in person by the editor and his assistants, who

ut the time, looked almost human.
This is fine, I modestly said to
myself, but before I could say
anything they had slapped me
twice across the face and pushed
me into a chair in front of a type
writer once used by William
Saroyan.
"Write something funny, you
dry-balled Bull Sessionist. We
can't wait forever," they said.
"Not so much sports," said the
managing editor with the stern
look of a drowning rat at Stern.

"Ease up on the women," said the woman (it brags)
associate editor.
"Sell pencils," suggested the man associate as he
pushed his cigarette into my eyes, trying to be clever
instead of constructive.
"But-but," I said. "These arc bad times. The Rus
sians have the atom bomb. The Greeks are still
starving, and five members of Rally Com are loose."
"Gag it up," they shouted.
"But-but," I said. "The Commies are 40 miles from
Canton, England is going to pieces, and I've got
a cold."
"Make em laugh," they cried.
"But I did. Didn't you get the one about the kid
in Australia who bought a new boomerang and . . ."
"You stink," they explained.
I was at the end of my rope. "I'm sorry," I ad
mitted. "What is to be done?"
They answered in a chorus, and that is strange be
cause if you've ever heard four people speaking to

gether unrehearsed at the same time you will agree
that it is an accomplishment. "Mingle with the stu
dents. Write about THEM. You know, the human
frailty angle. Peebles of the Farm stuff.
"Forget sports," yelled the managing editor, as he
broke out on his own.
This was too much. "Wait a minute," I Bogarted,
getting to my feet and knocking over three coke
bottles and a female tryoutee.
"You should know that sports are an integral part
of campus life. People enjoy football, basketball, and
baseball, or at least they used to. ?
"And furthermore, if you had the guts to read your
own Daily, you would know that my policy is 'local
-'em-to-death,' and just because I don't mention
Dinah's every other sentence doesn't mean that I'm
not mingling, and second furthermore, I resent the
fact that you stuck cigarettes in my eyes."
1 was beginning to get mad, but I cooled off as
the associate editor spit on me, and I said simply,
"Excuse me, I lost my head," and as 1 crawled under
the desk looking for it, I continued humbly, "All
light, my best is all I can give you, and I will try
to get more feebles."
But let's work together. I can't get more than one
feeble a day on my own. So, to printable tales
of campus foolishness, Hall will set up free beer at
Rosott's, or if written by a minor without a fake ID,
free cokes at the Cellar. Just send your stuff to me.
Any takes?
Ihird furthermore, if anybody writes two con
secutive funny stories in a row, he can take over
the whole damn column.
Right now I gotta hurry to make the first perform
i.nue of George Raft and Virginia Mayo in "Red
Light," which will positively be immoral, obscene,
and now showing in Paly.
See ya.

Hello, you happy Stanford Rooters:
Yesterday as I walked into The Daily Shack with a
happy smile and a Saturday Evening Post, I was
met in person by the editor and his assistants, who

ut the time, looked almost human.
This is fine, I modestly said to
myself, but before I could say
anything they had slapped me
twice across the face and pushed
me into a chair in front of a type
writer once used by William
Saroyan.
"Write something funny, you
dry-balled Bull Sessionist. We
can't wait forever," they said.
"Not so much sports," said the
managing editor with the stern
look of a drowning rat at Stern.

"Ease up on the women," said the woman (it brags)
associate editor.
"Sell pencils," suggested the man associate as he
pushed his cigarette into my eyes, trying to be clever
instead of constructive.
"But-but," I said. "These arc bad times. The Rus
sians have the atom bomb. The Greeks are still
starving, and five members of Rally Com are loose."
"Gag it up," they shouted.
"But-but," I said. "The Commies are 40 miles from
Canton, England is going to pieces, and I've got
a cold."
"Make em laugh," they cried.
"But I did. Didn't you get the one about the kid
in Australia who bought a new boomerang and . . ."
"You stink," they explained.
I was at the end of my rope. "I'm sorry," I ad
mitted. "What is to be done?"
They answered in a chorus, and that is strange be
cause if you've ever heard four people speaking to

gether unrehearsed at the same time you will agree
that it is an accomplishment. "Mingle with the stu
dents. Write about THEM. You know, the human
frailty angle. Peebles of the Farm stuff.
"Forget sports," yelled the managing editor, as he
broke out on his own.
This was too much. "Wait a minute," I Bogarted,
getting to my feet and knocking over three coke
bottles and a female tryoutee.
"You should know that sports are an integral part
of campus life. People enjoy football, basketball, and
baseball, or at least they used to. ?
"And furthermore, if you had the guts to read your
own Daily, you would know that my policy is 'local
-'em-to-death,' and just because I don't mention
Dinah's every other sentence doesn't mean that I'm
not mingling, and second furthermore, I resent the
fact that you stuck cigarettes in my eyes."
1 was beginning to get mad, but I cooled off as
the associate editor spit on me, and I said simply,
"Excuse me, I lost my head," and as 1 crawled under
the desk looking for it, I continued humbly, "All
light, my best is all I can give you, and I will try
to get more feebles."
But let's work together. I can't get more than one
feeble a day on my own. So, to printable tales
of campus foolishness, Hall will set up free beer at
Rosott's, or if written by a minor without a fake ID,
free cokes at the Cellar. Just send your stuff to me.
Any takes?
Ihird furthermore, if anybody writes two con
secutive funny stories in a row, he can take over
the whole damn column.
Right now I gotta hurry to make the first perform
i.nue of George Raft and Virginia Mayo in "Red
Light," which will positively be immoral, obscene,
and now showing in Paly.
