To the Editor:
To be specific, Editor M.K. My goodness, that edi
torial entitled "The Forgotten Man" sure startles an
average alum, one of the little-wigs, or, in a recent
Daily's enchanting phrase, one of the "older adults."
Does any student, even one, think anyone in the
Stanford Family ever forgets the students? My good--
riess again, everybody knows, everybody remembers
that's what Stanford is all for. That's what Stanford
is. That'?; why Trustees, including devoted Paul
Edwards, give their time and their hearts to admin
istering Stanford's long policies, Stanford's money—
for students. That's why alumni give time and heart
and money, and undertake the most disagreeable of
all social jobs, raising money—for students. The pres
ent ones, and tomorrow's. Not for themselves. Presi
dent Sterling was chosen for one reason only—serv
ice to students—and not to "please" anybody. The
job of actually selecting a President belongs to the
Trustees. Faculty and alumni committees were asked
to present any names they felt appropriate. They, as
individuals, could and did write to the Trustees, with
suggestions. Civic initiative is inherent, not invita
tional, around here.
If a student is really worried that any group of
alumni or faculty or "interested people" (Cod bless
those, often the salt of the earth; are running the
University into harm, surely they can go find out,
specifically. Most alumni, as far as I know, take it.
foi granted that student bodies run themselves, at
Stanford, adequately, and are fully able to speak for
themselve , and do not need, might even resent, being
carefully "noticed" (like children) by post-student •>—
their elders -so glad to get a look at the new Presi
dent (God bless him, too). Which is why they gave
themselves a party.
We older adults know Dr. Sterling can count on
his students, as they on him. But we did hope he

wasn't counting them, at that Inauguration. They
were his hosts, too. Where were they, so many of
them?

To the Editor:
As Chairman of the Faculty Inaugural Committee,
may 1 say a few words regarding some serious inac
curacies in Tuesday's editorial titled "The Forgotten
Men," in which the writer complains that the students
were not actively represented in the inaugural pro
ceedings.
'1 he first complaint is that students were not in
vited to the "Inaugural Dinner." This dinner was
not an official part of the ceremony. It was sponsored
by the Alumni Association as their welcome to Dr.
Sterling in the same way that the student body gave
its welcome by the rally on Friday evening. Natur
ally, alumni attended the dinner as students attended
the rally.
A to ceremonies on Friday, you overlooked tfie
lad that students participated in several ways. The
Executive Committee of the student body formed an
important unit in the academic procession. The Stan
lord Hand and the Brass Choir contributed their
mi vices as did the Stanford Choir.
It is true that too few students attended the cere
mony, but that unfortunate fact was due to their
own reluctance. All sudents were invited through
the columns of your paper and tickets were given out
all clay Wednesday at the Box Office. When it ap
peared that very few student were accepting the
invitation, arrangements were made to give out tick
ets at the Engineering Corner on the Quad on Thurs
day. We were very sorry that more did not take ad
vantage of the opportunity.
I am aft iid your editorial writ r failed to investi
gate Ik fact , before putting pen to paper.

It is true that too few students attended the cere

own reluctance. All sudents were invited through
the columns of your paper and tickets were given out

Edwards, give their time and their hearts to admin

all social jobs, raising money—for students. The pres

job of actually selecting a President belongs to the
Trustees. Faculty and alumni committees were asked
to present any names they felt appropriate. They, as
individuals, could and did write to the Trustees, with
suggestions. Civic initiative is inherent, not invita

If a student is really worried that any group of

As Chairman of the Faculty Inaugural Committee,
may 1 say a few words regarding some serious inac

were not actively represented in the inaugural pro
ceedings.
'1 he first complaint is that students were not in
vited to the "Inaugural Dinner." This dinner was
not an official part of the ceremony. It was sponsored
by the Alumni Association as their welcome to Dr.
Sterling in the same way that the student body gave
its welcome by the rally on Friday evening. Natur
