## On The Bench 
### 
Don Campbell, who used to play a lot of football around here, is a
who knows a lot more than his share ol just what is going on in
the Athletic Department. Besides being the track teams best pole
viiulter, "The Rock" was once upon a time (last year) one of the best
defensive safety men these tired old eyes have seen on the green, green
turf of the Stanford Stadium.
Rock, who was quite a star in high school, came to Stan lord and
.stepped into the qb spot of - the "team that never won a game. And
alter the blood had seeped off the field after the 1947 Big Game, it was
quite obvious that the slight measure of success that the team had had
that November afternoon was due in large measure to one Don Campbell.
I.ust season, however, was one that didn't smile with much favor on
old Rotkie. lie suffered brain concussions on an average of one every
two games, which slowed down his efficiency no end. His foothall career,
as you'll recall, ended at Berkeley after the first few seconds of the '48
Big Game. It was then that Don cost the Tide Water Associated people
several thousand dollars of extra air time as he lay on the field aftei
coming out second-best in a tussle with Van Dcrin s knee.
The first few paragraphs have served mainly as an introduction, and to
qualify Rock to those who might not know him as a bit of an expert on
football and foothall methods. Since the date of Don's placing his sup
porter on the peg, he has assisted—extra-curricularly, without pay-
Chuck Taylor in shaping up the Frosh eleven. So he has remained close
to the inside of Stanford athletics.
The reason for this "introduction" is that, although Rock knows a
great deal of what is going on he has not until now felt moved to say
anything about it. Yesterday he asked me if he could have the voice
of The Bench for a brief opinion. Since Rock is one student whose foot
ball opinion I sincerely value. 1 said something like "blaze* yes." And
Don wrote the lollowing letter, which talks about football with a degiei
of authentic ness that few columnists can muster.
DEAR AL:
"I note from last Monday's Daily sport page, and from the hum heie
abouts, that the gridiron situation about the old Farm has ebbed to such
depths that some undergraduate "experts are demanding the right to
affix some source with "blame" (that nasty word) for last Satuiday s soiiy
fiasco. I see, and hear, that the "experts" have absolved the Stanford
Varsity from responsibility for the wrong that has been committed.
This, of course, leaves only one other channel to ponder therein—inade
quate coaching.
Perhaps you might be interested in some philosophy on this thought by
an old "has been" who used to play when defeat served up that price
less intangible—the Stanford Spirit. And, Al. my grid days are gone,
thus I have no axe to grind.
This year's Stanford Varsity, Al, is a well-coached team; and is. po
tentially. sound in fundamental football. Fundamental football, as you
knofv, encompasses three categories—blocking, tackling, and desire.
These three are the commodities whereof football games are won or lost.
But. strangely enough, the functional success of the first two, blocking
and tackling, is only about 10 per cent dependent upon coaching (instruc
tion). The other 90 per cent is the key to the successful performance of
these two very necessary maneuvers of football. That key is the thiid
commodity—desire, sometimes called guts, determination, or even "moxie."
Call it what you like, but it is the key that unlocks the door, and it comes
fiom within the individual player.
Football may be a team game, but it is still played by 11 players on each
side, and each of those players is an individual who must—within himself
yive ALL for the concerted effort of the team play. When an individual
is well coached, as our Varsity is, in the techniques of the functions he is
t<j perform in the game, and is then sent into the game, it is his respon
sibility ALONE to muster within himself that desire, that determination,
which will cause him to fulfill his duty, his obligation, to himself, his
team, his school, and his coach.
Our team is in wonderful physical condition. When any player is
in goad "shape" and is DETERMINED to act and to think in the manner
he has been coached, his mistakes in the ball game are few. Actually,
Al, football is merely the weighing of one set of mistakes against an
other. The team which makes the fewer errors usually wins.
Thus, in our situation, I don't think that the coach is responsible for the
particular endings of the 11 individuals on the playing field (being there
because they have earned the right) who combine their skill, effort, and
will to play a team game.
The padded shoulders of the Stanford Varsity must, again, bear the
weighted burden of responsibility—and blame, if any—for the mistakes
of its individuals, and another unvictorious Saturday afternoon.
Sincerely yours,
DON CAMPBELL
That's all for this Thursday, kids, except for one brief word from The
Bench. Put your gold on the Big Red Machine next Saturday—l think
they'll beat Washington by 20 points. Which will, indeed, be fun.

The first few paragraphs have served mainly as an introduction, and to
qualify Rock to those who might not know him as a bit of an expert on
football and foothall methods. Since the date of Don's placing his sup
porter on the peg, he has assisted—extra-curricularly, without pay-
Chuck Taylor in shaping up the Frosh eleven. So he has remained close
to the inside of Stanford athletics.
The reason for this "introduction" is that, although Rock knows a
great deal of what is going on he has not until now felt moved to say
anything about it. Yesterday he asked me if he could have the voice
of The Bench for a brief opinion. Since Rock is one student whose foot
ball opinion I sincerely value. 1 said something like "blaze* yes." And
Don wrote the lollowing letter, which talks about football with a degiei
of authentic ness that few columnists can muster.
DEAR AL:
"I note from last Monday's Daily sport page, and from the hum heie
abouts, that the gridiron situation about the old Farm has ebbed to such
depths that some undergraduate "experts are demanding the right to
affix some source with "blame" (that nasty word) for last Satuiday s soiiy
fiasco. I see, and hear, that the "experts" have absolved the Stanford
Varsity from responsibility for the wrong that has been committed.
This, of course, leaves only one other channel to ponder therein—inade
quate coaching.
Perhaps you might be interested in some philosophy on this thought by
an old "has been" who used to play when defeat served up that price
less intangible—the Stanford Spirit. And, Al. my grid days are gone,
thus I have no axe to grind.
This year's Stanford Varsity, Al, is a well-coached team; and is. po
tentially. sound in fundamental football. Fundamental football, as you
knofv, encompasses three categories—blocking, tackling, and desire.
These three are the commodities whereof football games are won or lost.
But. strangely enough, the functional success of the first two, blocking
and tackling, is only about 10 per cent dependent upon coaching (instruc
tion). The other 90 per cent is the key to the successful performance of
these two very necessary maneuvers of football. That key is the thiid
commodity—desire, sometimes called guts, determination, or even "moxie."
Call it what you like, but it is the key that unlocks the door, and it comes
fiom within the individual player.
Football may be a team game, but it is still played by 11 players on each
side, and each of those players is an individual who must—within himself
yive ALL for the concerted effort of the team play. When an individual
is well coached, as our Varsity is, in the techniques of the functions he is
t<j perform in the game, and is then sent into the game, it is his respon
sibility ALONE to muster within himself that desire, that determination,
which will cause him to fulfill his duty, his obligation, to himself, his
team, his school, and his coach.
Our team is in wonderful physical condition. When any player is
in goad "shape" and is DETERMINED to act and to think in the manner
he has been coached, his mistakes in the ball game are few. Actually,
Al, football is merely the weighing of one set of mistakes against an
other. The team which makes the fewer errors usually wins.
Thus, in our situation, I don't think that the coach is responsible for the
particular endings of the 11 individuals on the playing field (being there
because they have earned the right) who combine their skill, effort, and
will to play a team game.
The padded shoulders of the Stanford Varsity must, again, bear the
weighted burden of responsibility—and blame, if any—for the mistakes
of its individuals, and another unvictorious Saturday afternoon.
Sincerely yours,
DON CAMPBELL
That's all for this Thursday, kids, except for one brief word from The
Bench. Put your gold on the Big Red Machine next Saturday—l think
they'll beat Washington by 20 points. Which will, indeed, be fun.
Don Campbell, who used to play a lot of football around here, is a
who knows a lot more than his share ol just what is going on in
the Athletic Department. Besides being the track teams best pole
viiulter, "The Rock" was once upon a time (last year) one of the best
defensive safety men these tired old eyes have seen on the green, green
turf of the Stanford Stadium.
Rock, who was quite a star in high school, came to Stan lord and
.stepped into the qb spot of - the "team that never won a game. And
alter the blood had seeped off the field after the 1947 Big Game, it was
quite obvious that the slight measure of success that the team had had
that November afternoon was due in large measure to one Don Campbell.
I.ust season, however, was one that didn't smile with much favor on
old Rotkie. lie suffered brain concussions on an average of one every
two games, which slowed down his efficiency no end. His foothall career,
as you'll recall, ended at Berkeley after the first few seconds of the '48
Big Game. It was then that Don cost the Tide Water Associated people
several thousand dollars of extra air time as he lay on the field aftei
coming out second-best in a tussle with Van Dcrin s knee.

fiasco. I see, and hear, that the "experts" have absolved the Stanford
Varsity from responsibility for the wrong that has been committed.
This, of course, leaves only one other channel to ponder therein—inade
quate coaching.
Perhaps you might be interested in some philosophy on this thought by
an old "has been" who used to play when defeat served up that price
less intangible—the Stanford Spirit. And, Al. my grid days are gone,
thus I have no axe to grind.
This year's Stanford Varsity, Al, is a well-coached team; and is. po
tentially. sound in fundamental football. Fundamental football, as you
knofv, encompasses three categories—blocking, tackling, and desire.
These three are the commodities whereof football games are won or lost.
But. strangely enough, the functional success of the first two, blocking
and tackling, is only about 10 per cent dependent upon coaching (instruc
tion). The other 90 per cent is the key to the successful performance of
these two very necessary maneuvers of football. That key is the thiid
commodity—desire, sometimes called guts, determination, or even "moxie."
Call it what you like, but it is the key that unlocks the door, and it comes
fiom within the individual player.
Football may be a team game, but it is still played by 11 players on each
side, and each of those players is an individual who must—within himself
yive ALL for the concerted effort of the team play. When an individual
is well coached, as our Varsity is, in the techniques of the functions he is
t<j perform in the game, and is then sent into the game, it is his respon
sibility ALONE to muster within himself that desire, that determination,
which will cause him to fulfill his duty, his obligation, to himself, his
team, his school, and his coach.
Our team is in wonderful physical condition. When any player is
in goad "shape" and is DETERMINED to act and to think in the manner
he has been coached, his mistakes in the ball game are few. Actually,
Al, football is merely the weighing of one set of mistakes against an
other. The team which makes the fewer errors usually wins.
Thus, in our situation, I don't think that the coach is responsible for the
particular endings of the 11 individuals on the playing field (being there
because they have earned the right) who combine their skill, effort, and
will to play a team game.
The padded shoulders of the Stanford Varsity must, again, bear the
weighted burden of responsibility—and blame, if any—for the mistakes
of its individuals, and another unvictorious Saturday afternoon.
Sincerely yours,
DON CAMPBELL
That's all for this Thursday, kids, except for one brief word from The
Bench. Put your gold on the Big Red Machine next Saturday—l think
they'll beat Washington by 20 points. Which will, indeed, be fun.
Don Campbell, who used to play a lot of football around here, is a
who knows a lot more than his share ol just what is going on in
the Athletic Department. Besides being the track teams best pole
viiulter, "The Rock" was once upon a time (last year) one of the best
defensive safety men these tired old eyes have seen on the green, green
turf of the Stanford Stadium.
Rock, who was quite a star in high school, came to Stan lord and
.stepped into the qb spot of - the "team that never won a game. And
alter the blood had seeped off the field after the 1947 Big Game, it was
quite obvious that the slight measure of success that the team had had
that November afternoon was due in large measure to one Don Campbell.
I.ust season, however, was one that didn't smile with much favor on
old Rotkie. lie suffered brain concussions on an average of one every
two games, which slowed down his efficiency no end. His foothall career,
as you'll recall, ended at Berkeley after the first few seconds of the '48
Big Game. It was then that Don cost the Tide Water Associated people
several thousand dollars of extra air time as he lay on the field aftei
coming out second-best in a tussle with Van Dcrin s knee.
The first few paragraphs have served mainly as an introduction, and to
qualify Rock to those who might not know him as a bit of an expert on
football and foothall methods. Since the date of Don's placing his sup
porter on the peg, he has assisted—extra-curricularly, without pay-
Chuck Taylor in shaping up the Frosh eleven. So he has remained close
to the inside of Stanford athletics.
The reason for this "introduction" is that, although Rock knows a
great deal of what is going on he has not until now felt moved to say
anything about it. Yesterday he asked me if he could have the voice
of The Bench for a brief opinion. Since Rock is one student whose foot
ball opinion I sincerely value. 1 said something like "blaze* yes." And
Don wrote the lollowing letter, which talks about football with a degiei
of authentic ness that few columnists can muster.
