# Soccermen Meet Cal Aggies Saturday on Stanford field
## 
### 
Coach "Skipper" Segal is working
industriously to ready a large but
green soccer squad for the peren
nially rugged Cal Aggies who in
vade Stanford Field next Saturday
at 10 a.m.
The squad, over 50 strong, has a
large sprinkling of first-year men
who have never toed a "football"
until this fall.
However, Segal will be able to
field at least one veteran team which
can give the Aggies plenty of oppo
sition.
So far practice has indicated that
Handy Hudson in the goal and Homi
Irani, two years all-conference, at
right half will be the sparkplugs of
this team.
Harry Havi io, Alex Lane, and
Jeff Moishead will probably also
shine. Harry learned his soccer
fundamentals south of the border
in the Argentine and can do every
thing with the ball except swallow
it. He uses his head as well as most
greenhorns on the squad use their
feet.

Morshead plays an aggressive
game at center half. He likes to
bull right up the middle of the field
before he passes off to set up a goal.
Bud McCord will bolster the de
fense at fullback if a trick knee will
agree to stay in place. Bud started
soccer only last spring and is now
one of the team's strongest full
backs.
Best of the newcomers are Sal
Colletto, speedy right wing, and goal
keeper Chuck Malouf. Chuck filled
in at the goal his first day out and
lias been there ever since.
Cal Aggies are always tough, and
although Stanford beat them last
year, the Aggies beat Cal who eked
by the Cards 1-0.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters has
O.K.'d a trip to Los Angeles on No
vember 5 to play UCLA. Masters
agreed to al!ot $300, enough for
round-trip train tickets for a trav
eling squad of 20, if the team wanted
to go.
