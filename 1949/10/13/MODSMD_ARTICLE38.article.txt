## Redskins Found Hunting Poor in Seattle Forest 
### EARL ODELL 
It's no picnic in Seattle for the ,
Indians this Saturday when they j
j throw their young bucks against the [
j wild Huskies of the Northland in 1
I live 2(ith meeting between Stanford
| and Washington.
The Redskins have never made j
1 the Seattle field a "happy hunting j
j ground" judging from past records, |
i although they have had their mo
j ments. For example, in the rugged j
1935 name Stanford's Monk Moscrip ;
took all honors, booting two field |
j>oals for a ti to 0 upset. However, j
it was nothing new, for Washing- j
ton's Bil! Evans had pulled the same j
stunt in their previous Seattle en
< counter in '33, upsetting the then j
beardless Vow Boys by the same
score.
TIGHT BALL GAMES
For the most part the Stanford- I
Washington games have been tight,
I close - scoring affairs, full of sur
i prises, one of the few exceptions be
ing the first game between the uni
j versities in 1893 when the Farm j
! products took complete charge, ;
J routing the Huskies 45 to 0. In the
second game, played in 1920, Stan
ford squeezed by 3 to 0 on the
I strength of Dink Templeton's toe.
The inimitable Dink split the up
rights from the 25-yard stripe.
In '37 the Indians beat Washing
ton-13 to 7on a couple of breaks,:
but they were unable to pull any
thing out of the bag in '39 when
| the Northerners nipped them in a
real thriller-chiller by a baseball
score of 8 to 5. Revenge was forth
! coming, however, in 1940, the year
of that certain flower, when, after
trailing at half-time 10 to 0 in the
local stadium, the Cards rallied to
j push over the Huskymen 20 to 10.
TAYLOR WINS IN If
After Washington's 13 to 0 victory
I in '25 the Injuns went on a four
| year winning spree against the Hus- '
; kies starting with the '26 bat
tle, the kind of game coaches dream
i about, if they're the type of coach
■ who sleeps. With the game tied at
| 10 all in the early part of the fourth
period, the Cards pushed over three
quick TD's, "Irish Mike" Murphy
i seeing to two of them all by his
lonesome.
In '27. "28,and 29 the boys from
| the Farm still had Washington's
number, winning 13 to 7, 12 to 0, and
G to 0 "respectfully."
Next year saw Stanford continue 1
i in her winning ways against Wash
; ington, convincing the Huskies by
a 13 to 7 score. That was the day
Chuck Taylor won a line battle over
i center Walt Harrison.

TIGHT BALL GAMES

ing the first game between the uni

J routing the Huskies 45 to 0. In the
