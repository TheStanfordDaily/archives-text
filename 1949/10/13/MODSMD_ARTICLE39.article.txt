## 
### 
With only one more local practice
session remaining before they leave

attle, and they hope to use the same
route in subduing the Washington
Huskies on Saturday afternoon. The
plane will leave San Francisco Air
port at 10:30 Friday morning.
Although the skies are clear and
the sun is hot in California, the res
idents of Washington have not been
so fortunate this week. It has been
raining in Seattle a good part of
the week, and that might spell
trouble lor Marchie Schwartz and
Company. The Indians have had no
occasion to use a wet bail this year.
Yesterday's workout tapered off
a little from Tuesday's vicious
scrimmage, but Schwartz had both
the offensive and defensive units in
rough scrimmages. Hie offensive
team looked good, with both the
passing and running formations
working in good style.
A 1 Laakso, regular end last year,
is rounding into shape after an ear
ly-season injury, and is expected to
see plenty of action against the Hus
kies Saturday. Co-Captain Al Rau's
rib injuries have improved during
the week, and he should be able to
play on offense at least. Rau re
ceived a beautiful black eye in
scrimmage on Tuesday, but he wil!
be in there Saturday shiner and all.
