# Law Exam Changes Explained by Spaeth
## 
### 
The reasons behind the recent
major change in first-year law ex
aminations were disclosed yesterday
by Dean Carl B. Spaeth ol the Law
School. -
Dean Spaeth said that the faculty
decided to hold all examinations at
the end of spring quarter rather
than at the end of each course, as
wps formerly done, because:
MATERIAL MUST 'STICK'
I. The first-year courses are fun
damental not only to the entire Law
School program, but to the work
which the lawyer does throughout
his career. The content as well as
the techniques of analysis studied
in the first year must in a very real
sense become a part of the lawyer.
The realization of this difficult ob

jective has been made even more
difficult by the division of the first
year course of study into neat pack
ages of ten weeks each, with the
inevitable tendency to cram on seg
ments of the law during short pe
riods of time.
2. As a student moves through his
first year he finds that law courses
supplement one another and that
information acquired in one course
makes more meaningful the mate
rial in other courses. A desirable
comprehensive view of the entire
first year will be promoted by the
new system.
NEW SYSTEM FAIRER
The system under which stu
dents were required to take a final
examination, with a permanent en
try on their transcripts, at the end
of on'y ten weeks of study has in
many cases worked an injustice to
very able men who require a sub
stantially longer period to become
familiar with the "vocabulary" of
what is an entirely new discipline to
them .
4. Teachers of contracts and torts,
which are tlu-ee - quarter courses,
have found in the past that the men
concentrated on review tor the ex
ams in criminal law, personal prop
erty and remedies, agency, and oth
er courses which have autumn and
winter finals.
LONGER REVIEW
Since the first-year students will
be attending classes in the fall and
winter examination periods, the lec
tures may be ended ear.ier in the
spring, giving the men a longer re
view at that time. The spring re
view session will probably be ten
days to two weeks long, Spaeth
added that the faculty plans to give
preliminary examinations on little
or no notice during the year to in
sure the desirable review, but with
out entry of a grade upon the per
manent record.
The law faculty, lie said, is seri
ously considering extension of the
new arrangement to the second and
third years.
