## New Band Stunts Ready for Seattle 
### 
As the 63 members of the air
borne Stanford Band prepared
for the half-time stunts at the
Washington game Saturday,
new donations were received
yesterday, Band Manager Norm
Hamilton announced.
The latest addition to the bind
drive was $10 from the Shell Oil
Co. The musicians still need about
$30.
In order to cut some of the ex
pense, band members have agreed to
pay for any meals not furnished by
the Seattle Stanford Chlub.
Final arrangements were being
made yesterday with Western Air
lines, which has scheduled a special
chartered plane with the co-opera
tion of the University Air Travel
Service. The band's flight tomorrow
night will initiate the airline's new
air coach service, Hamilton said.
Director Julius Shuchat "cut" the
80-piece band to a 65-man travel
ing squad, including himself and
Drum Major Ray Williams. At re
hearsal Tuesday night the bandsmen
went through the complete half
time rudiments which will include
formation of a "W into which an
arrow will crash, a Block "S," and
an umbrella, together with special
musical arrangements of "Stormy
Weather" and "Blue Skies."
Before the game the band will
form a "hi" and play "Hail, Hail, the
Gang's All Here." Lest Seattle has
rain Saturday morning, the band
will have completed the necessary
rehearsals for the game stunts be
fore boarding the DC-4.
