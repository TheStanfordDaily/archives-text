# Powell, Lombard On Screen Sunday
## 
### 
When a society debutante wins a
I scavenger hunt by successfully re
trieving a forgotten man from the
city dump, it makes for one of the
wackiest comedies produced in Hol
lywood.
This week's Sunday evening mov
ie, "My Man Godfrey." with Wil
liam Powell and Carole Lombard,
concerns Park Avenue's craziest
tanuly of multimillionaires. The
"filthy rich" are finally reformed by
the forgotten man. Wi'liarn Powell,
who is installed as their butler.
The bi'l is rounded off by a color
I cartoon, "Rattled Rooster," and
Chapter 4 of the blood - curdling,
| hair-raising "Black Widow" serial.
