### MARGE McKEON 
Nineteen hundred thirty - five
marked the inauguration of a new
and different course whieh has since
become an institution at Stanford.
This course, familiar to all Farm
reshmen as Western Civ. was ini
tiated to nive every student a
glimpse of the kaleidoscopic ele
ments of European history whieh
•itronyly influenced American de
mocracy.
Western Civ, {in innovation in the
study of general history, set a prece
dent for similar courses whieh are
now offered at universities and col
leges from coast to coast, including
the University of Washington and
the University of Chicago. Requests
for the syllabus and organization of
Western Civ are still being received
from other schools, 14 years after
the course was opened.
The basic idea behind this course,
according to Dr. Edgar A. Robinson,
head of the history department, "is
the belief that the roots of our
American life were oil in Western

..uiope. anu n students were to live
in what \v;is called one world, they
ought lo know about the roots and
many nationalities and institutions
of Western Europe."
kvolvei) in
Preceding the development of the
present course, a History of Civiliza
tions was o'icred in 191 (» and discon
tinued during World War I. In 15)2!t
discussions were again opened on
the possibility of a world history
eourse, and after several experi
ments and considerable preparation,
the present Western Civ course was
evolved in ISKSS.
The extensive syllabus received
by every freshman, was one of the
innovation, made possible by the
unique administrative method de
velop. Ed for Western Civ. Unlike
most univer: ity courses, Western
Civ is planned and guided by a
special committee whieh prepares
the syllabus and makes necessary
revisions in the eourse from year to
year.
Plans for this comprehensive
course were so new in 1935 that no

text was avaiiamo to cover trie |
broad field, so the Civ Libe was cs- j
tablished for the large collection of
source materials. Although text- |
books are now available for Western
Civ, freshmen are still found in the !
Civ Libe. poring over the selected
source materials prescribed to en
rich the course.

Men who have been Western Civ
instructors here may be found
teaching in universities throughout
the United States. Included among
the many distinguished scholars who I
have been on the Western Civ staff j
is Stanford's newly - inaugurated |
president. Dr. Wallace Sterling. Dr.
Sterling was on the initial staff for
two years when Western Civ was
first offered in 10' J.).
Eleven instructors now spend j
their entire teaching time leading |
freshmen into the study of Western
Civilization, while at the beginning
only four full-time instructors were
used, along with the assistance of
other men in the History Depart
ment.
