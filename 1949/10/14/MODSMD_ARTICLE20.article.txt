Is there is or is there ain't an
Alpha Tail Omega Pig? Nobody

But a spokesman at the ATO
house refused to give any specific
information as to whether the
young porker had or had not been
pignaped. Since the animal comes
from a most prominent swine
family, perpetrators of an unau
thorized pig roast probably would
find themselves in trouble with
the law.
