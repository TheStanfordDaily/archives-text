# Cards Favored In Huskie Tilt
## Indians Travel to Seattle Saturday Hoping to Stay in Conference Race 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
It's now or never lor Stanford's football heroes this week, ar>
the Indians travel to Seattle to meet the University of Washing
ton Huskies. It will be the second Conference game for each
team, and both need a win to stay in the Rose Bowl picture.
Stanford has been installed 7V2-point favorite for this con-

♦lest. The odds-makers probal ly
j based their claim on the Huskies'
! inability to score a single toucli
| down against the battered and
I bruised Oregon State Beavers.
The Indians also showed little of
| fensive skill when they got into
position to score against UCLA last,
week, but it is a known fact that
the Bruins rank in a class a bow
j Oregon State.
BROADCAST OF KCBS
j The game is scheduled to get un-
I der way at 2 p.m. Pacific Standard
i Time. It will be broadcast over
! KIRO in Seattle, and released lo
cally over station KCBS in San
Francisco starting at 1:45. Pat Hayes
will handle the sportcast. Approxi-
I mately 32,000 persons are expected
I to attend the contest.
Coach Marchie Schwartz and 37
| of his warriors will leave San Fran
cisco Airport this morning at 10:.'JO
! for the Northwest. The trip will be
| made on a United Air Lines DC-<I
j plane. (See traveling squad on
j sports page.)
The Stanford gridders have been
I working overtime this week in prep
| aration for the struggle. Schwartz,
has been giving both the offensive
j and defensive units stiff workout .
i and they have responded in good
j style.
HORN TO GKT CHANCE
There will be several changes in
| the Stanford lineup this week, ;,s
| the coaches have tried to iron out
I the miscues that led to last week's
jl4 to 7 loss to UCLA. Dick Horn,
sophomore quarterback who has
spent, the last two weeks warming
the bench, is expected to get every
opportunity to prove himself tonior •
row.
Horn appears to be the best passer
on the team, but he has yet to show
| the stuff that made him a terrific
I prep star. His faking is not quite
'as good as Kerkorian's and Sliaw'
| but that will probably come along
j with a little more experience.
The much-heralded Rupe An
drews will see more action in tomor
row's contest than in previous
games, despite two sprained fingers.
Andrews has been a ball of lire
whenever he has been in action this
season, and it is hoped that he will
spark the Indians 1o several touch
downs.
Best news from this week's work
out was the return to form of AI
Laakso. The 176-pounder is one of
the best blocking ends on the squad,
and his recovery from an injury in
the Michigan game will be a big
help to the squad . Laakso lus been
I used mostly on defense in the past.
RAU TO PLAY
I Co-captain A 1 Rau, he of the
j broken ribs and black eye, has been
| taking it easy in practice this week,
i but he will be ready to see plenty
lof action against the Huskies. lie
j will probably be used exclusive! l /
|on offensive.
Schwartz has been working the
! defensive unit herd in attempting
to solve Washington's "Winged T"
formation. The Huskies run on the
average of only one out of six plays
I from the straight T. and make great.
