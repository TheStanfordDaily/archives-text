# Mail Delivery for All
## 
### 
Although Stanford students have tradi
tionally picked up their mail at the Post Of
fice general delivery window, there is no
reason why letters and parcels cannot be de
livered to all campus dormitories.
Individual mailboxes have already been in
stalled in Crothers and Stern Halls. The Vil
lage buildings have pigeonholes for each let
ter ol the alphabet. But Roble, Lagunita, Bran
ner, Toyon, and Encina residents must, for the
most part, stand in line each day at the gen
eral delivery window.
The Stanford Post Office is willing to deliver
to these halls if locked individual mail boxes
or some other satisfactory method of distri-
Jiution is provided.
In the days when Stanford was a school of
3,500, the Post Office was a sort of social gath
ering place each morning at 10 when the mail
arrived. Weekend dates were sometimes
made on the spot when a promised check
from father arrived.
But Stanford has grown since then, while
the Post Office has not. Even though two
men have been placed on the longter A-M
section of general delivery at busy hours, the
lines are sometimes long. Waiting for mail
has become a nuisance, not a social event.
The cost of installing mail boxes in the halls
is ciearly a point to consider. Although it is

far easier to install them when a dormitory is
being built than to do so years later, the cost
should not be prohibitively large.
Another problem is that of space. Where, for
example, would GOG mail boxes be placed in
Encina? The problem may have been solved
in Stern Hall, where the boxes are built into
the wall in each wing, with a maximum of 72
boxes in a single place. Wall space prob
ably could be found in all the halls, however,
once an effort was made.
Post Office boxes would still be available
for those who desired them, but the strain on
the general delivery window would be re
lieved. Parcels could be delivered to the hall
office and a nolice left ol its arrival. Registered
and insured mail, however, would still have
to be called lor at the Post Office.
Perhaps arrangements could also be made
to collect outgoing mail from each hall. At
present Stern and Toyon residents, for ex
ample, must go to Encina or the Post Office to
mail a letter.
Only one question remains—do students
want delivery service, or do they prefer the
present set-up? Frankly, we think this mail
box system would be far more convenient
and satisfactory. If the residents of these halls
agree, perhaps a change can be made in the
near future. M.H.

the Post Office has not. Even though two
men have been placed on the longter A-M
section of general delivery at busy hours, the
lines are sometimes long. Waiting for mail
has become a nuisance, not a social event.
The cost of installing mail boxes in the halls
is ciearly a point to consider. Although it is

far easier to install them when a dormitory is
being built than to do so years later, the cost
should not be prohibitively large.
Another problem is that of space. Where, for
example, would GOG mail boxes be placed in
Encina? The problem may have been solved
in Stern Hall, where the boxes are built into
the wall in each wing, with a maximum of 72
boxes in a single place. Wall space prob
ably could be found in all the halls, however,
once an effort was made.
Post Office boxes would still be available
for those who desired them, but the strain on
the general delivery window would be re
lieved. Parcels could be delivered to the hall
office and a nolice left ol its arrival. Registered
and insured mail, however, would still have
to be called lor at the Post Office.
Perhaps arrangements could also be made
to collect outgoing mail from each hall. At
present Stern and Toyon residents, for ex
ample, must go to Encina or the Post Office to
mail a letter.
Only one question remains—do students
want delivery service, or do they prefer the
present set-up? Frankly, we think this mail
box system would be far more convenient
and satisfactory. If the residents of these halls
agree, perhaps a change can be made in the
near future. M.H.
Although Stanford students have tradi
tionally picked up their mail at the Post Of
fice general delivery window, there is no
reason why letters and parcels cannot be de
livered to all campus dormitories.
Individual mailboxes have already been in
stalled in Crothers and Stern Halls. The Vil
lage buildings have pigeonholes for each let
ter ol the alphabet. But Roble, Lagunita, Bran
ner, Toyon, and Encina residents must, for the
most part, stand in line each day at the gen
eral delivery window.
The Stanford Post Office is willing to deliver
to these halls if locked individual mail boxes
or some other satisfactory method of distri-
Jiution is provided.
In the days when Stanford was a school of
3,500, the Post Office was a sort of social gath
ering place each morning at 10 when the mail
arrived. Weekend dates were sometimes
made on the spot when a promised check
from father arrived.
But Stanford has grown since then, while
the Post Office has not. Even though two
men have been placed on the longter A-M
section of general delivery at busy hours, the
lines are sometimes long. Waiting for mail
has become a nuisance, not a social event.
