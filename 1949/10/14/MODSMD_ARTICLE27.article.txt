### JOHN HALL 
As real people sometimes do, I overslept yesterday
morning, and upon awakening with that frantic
leeling of a man whose date has just walked out
with another guy, I hastened to find out what time

j< was.
I bounded down the stairs and
encountered one of the red-eyed
brothers.
"What time is it?"
"I don't know. I left my watch
upstairs."
"Aren't you afraid it will run
down?"
"Naw, it's a winding staircase."
T hit him three times, left him
lying there, and ran into the
kitchen.

"What time is it?" I asked the first person I came to.
' I don't know, I woke up last night and thought
my watch was gone."
'Well, was it gone?" I asked innocently.
"No, but it was GOING," he guffawed out loud.
He stopped laughing when I poured scalding coffee
down the hack of his Phelps-Terkel shirt, and I
lan off cursing to myself.

My clothes happened to be in the back seat of my
car where I had li ft them the'night before, so I put
them on and drove lull speed to class.
Juj-t as I was about to grab the last parking place
on campus, down in front of Wilson's, a black shiny
thing darted in front of me.
Remembering a el ver line I learned in the third
| grade, I Bogarted, "Whatya think you're driving—a
! golf ball?"
An ugly gorilla who looked as if he had played the
lead in Mighty Joe Young, jumped out and snorted
simply. "Yeah, buddy, yeah," and he tried a chip shot
off my teeth.
Still bleeding, I finally got to History Corner, run
part the M;.xine Kellogg personality photos, and into
! the classroom.
There, to my surprise, I came face to face with an
! empty ruom and the big chalk-white letters on the
! board- NO CLASS TODAY.
And remembering the reason for it. I exclaimed
cleverly with double meaning, "Christopher Colum
bus."
Well, you can't win 'em all, or haven't you read
the Saturday Evening Post?

And remembering the reason for it. I exclaimed
cleverly with double meaning, "Christopher Colum
bus."
Well, you can't win 'em all, or haven't you read
the Saturday Evening Post?

As real people sometimes do, I overslept yesterday
morning, and upon awakening with that frantic
leeling of a man whose date has just walked out
with another guy, I hastened to find out what time

j< was.
I bounded down the stairs and
encountered one of the red-eyed
brothers.
"What time is it?"
"I don't know. I left my watch
upstairs."
"Aren't you afraid it will run
down?"
"Naw, it's a winding staircase."
T hit him three times, left him
lying there, and ran into the
kitchen.

"What time is it?" I asked the first person I came to.
' I don't know, I woke up last night and thought
my watch was gone."
'Well, was it gone?" I asked innocently.
"No, but it was GOING," he guffawed out loud.
He stopped laughing when I poured scalding coffee
down the hack of his Phelps-Terkel shirt, and I
lan off cursing to myself.

My clothes happened to be in the back seat of my
car where I had li ft them the'night before, so I put
them on and drove lull speed to class.
Juj-t as I was about to grab the last parking place
on campus, down in front of Wilson's, a black shiny
thing darted in front of me.
Remembering a el ver line I learned in the third
| grade, I Bogarted, "Whatya think you're driving—a
! golf ball?"
An ugly gorilla who looked as if he had played the
lead in Mighty Joe Young, jumped out and snorted
simply. "Yeah, buddy, yeah," and he tried a chip shot
off my teeth.
Still bleeding, I finally got to History Corner, run
part the M;.xine Kellogg personality photos, and into
! the classroom.
There, to my surprise, I came face to face with an
! empty ruom and the big chalk-white letters on the
! board- NO CLASS TODAY.
And remembering the reason for it. I exclaimed
cleverly with double meaning, "Christopher Colum
bus."
Well, you can't win 'em all, or haven't you read
the Saturday Evening Post?
