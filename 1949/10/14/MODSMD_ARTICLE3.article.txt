LONDONâ€”Prime Minister Att!ee
put ;i stop tochiy to Britain's big
political guessing game by announc
ing there will be no general election
in 1949.
The announcement came as a
neatly timed wet blanket case smack
in the middle of the three-day an
nual rally of the Conservative party,
the major opposition to Attlee's La
bor government.
Winston Churchill and other Con
servative leaders had called for an
car'y vote as a test of the govern
ment's economic policies.
