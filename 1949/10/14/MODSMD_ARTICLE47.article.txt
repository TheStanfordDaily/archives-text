# Survivor of Bataan March Enters Law School Here
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Bill Linderfelt, a senior political
science major, has attended two
universities prior to his enrollment
at Stanford this quarter. At both
other schools he was visited by a
reporter seeking an interview, and
Stanford proved no exception.
There are undoubtedly other and
better reasons why he should be
the subject of an interview — and
this reporter became aware of such
reasons as he talked—but the pri
mary cause for Bill's news value is
that he is blind.
Bill lost his vision in 15)42 as a
result of beatings and malnutrition
sufTered in a Japanese prisoner of
war camp. A U.S. Marine, he had
been captured in the Battle of Ba
taan, and had managed to survive
the infamous Death March and a
couple of postponed dates with a
firing squad. He had been included
on two "shooting squads" in which
one man escaped and the other nine
were to be executed. For some rea
son the Japanese suddenly cut the
number of victims to five, and Bill
managed to be in the right half both
times.
SO MUCH EXPERIENCE
But Bill looks back on the years
from 1942 to 1946 as just so much
experience. Far from being embit
tered toward the Japanese people,
he hopes to return to the Orient,
where he made many friends, to
follow out his career in law.
It was because of the reputation
of the law school here, which Bill
hopes to enter, that he came to
Stanford. Thus far, Bill lias main
tained a "B" average after one year
at San Diego State and two at the
University of Hawaii. Here on the
Farm, where Bill asserts there is a
unique "free and easy attitude con
ducive to study," he has set his
sights for a year of straight "A's."
TAKING NOTES
In class, the only indication that
Bill cannot see is the presence of
his guide dog, Nip. When he first
started college, Bill used to take lec
ture notes with a braille typewriter.

But it later occurred to him that he
had spent 20 years learning how to
write the normal way, and he saw
no reason why he should stop now.
Consequently, Bill takes notes in his
own hand and has his readers re
cord them.
Bill has ignored much of the
equipment designed for his use. Flis
room at Stern is well stocked with
a braille typewriter and books in
braille, but they are gathering dust.
Bill doesn't consider himself help
less, and he tries to—and does—get
along like any other student.
LACK OF TIME
And like any other student, the
29-year-old veteran has already en
countered trouble in finding time
for study, because of the abundance
of social activities.
The only device Bill uses with
any regularity is a scripto-scribe
recording machine. He has hired
several persons to record the text
of his assignments and the notes he
takes in class.
And that's how Bill hopes to meet
the law school requirements and get
his diploma. If you're interested in
his war-time adventures, Bill sug
gests that you buy the book he
hopes to write someday.
