# Taylor's Crew Hosts UCLA
## Papooses Aim For 14th Straight Win 
### DICK KLEIN 
With Coach Chuck Taylor's
impressive win streak ol 13
frosh victories hanging in the
balance, the Papoose eleven
takes on the UCLA yearling
sguad tomorrow on the Stadium
turf. Kickoff is tabbed for 2:30
p.m.
The games shapes up as a re
match of last Saturday's varsity tilt.
It's the Brubabe single wing against
the locals' T formation. It's Stan
lord with one more game of col
legiate ball against UCLA's lop
sided victory over Oceanside Col
lege. Both teams have injuries, and
plenty of 'em.

Coach Taylor, who has led three
post-war Farm frosh teams to un
defeated seasons, would like to equal
last year's Brubabe drubbing. Then,
the now famous '52ers plastered the
Weslwooders, 23-6, in the Coliseum.
IMPROVED MATERIAL
The Bruin frosh are tutored by
Coach George Dickerson, 193(5 UC
LA football captain. Last year's
record was a poor one-win-and-
I four-losses. But better material
I makes the team a real threat.
Ike Jones, former teammate of
Stanford's Dick Horn and an ex
ail-state end in 1947 prep ranks,
was slated to be the Brubabes' big
gun at the wingback spot. An un
! fortunate broken knee will sideline
the flashy star for the entire season.
In the revitalized lineup, Ted Nar
j leski, wearing Ernie Johnson's num
! her 17, has been the big gainer. The
little scatback, who West wood fans
j think v/ill replace Johnson someday
' on the varsity, is a deadly open-field
j runner.
Power for the Bruins is supplied
by Whitey Arcenaux and two steady
j wingmen, Donn Moomaw and Ernie
Stockort, are standouts on both de
| lense and on the pass-catching. Big
i Tom Wahlgren will try to match
j slams with Papoose middle-of-the
j line stars.
LIGHT SCRUM
I For the Indian yearlings, only
light scrimmaging was allowed yes
j terday to prevent further injuries.
[ Coach Taylor was concerned over
i many of his players' ability to pk'y
j full-time ball.
Dave Eldridge will get the quar
: terback call over Joe St. Geme. Top
j spark in the backfield, Frank "Skip
i per" Crist is scheduled to start at
i fullback, but Skip will be spelled by
ever-improving Willie Barmore.
At the halves, Wes Laubschcr gets
! into the starting string, while Loren
Hinkleman and Dick Gargiulo still
I lale as a toss-up for the other. Line
S .'■ tar Norm Manoogian, nursing a
; bruised ankle from the Santa Clara
j battle, is a doubtful starter. Yester
j day, Norm's leg seemed to be re
| sponding to warm-up, but Howard
: Pyle is ready for most of the action.

last year's Brubabe drubbing. Then,
the now famous '52ers plastered the
Weslwooders, 23-6, in the Coliseum.
IMPROVED MATERIAL
The Bruin frosh are tutored by
Coach George Dickerson, 193(5 UC
LA football captain. Last year's
record was a poor one-win-and-
I four-losses. But better material
I makes the team a real threat.
Ike Jones, former teammate of
Stanford's Dick Horn and an ex
ail-state end in 1947 prep ranks,
was slated to be the Brubabes' big
gun at the wingback spot. An un
! fortunate broken knee will sideline
the flashy star for the entire season.
In the revitalized lineup, Ted Nar
j leski, wearing Ernie Johnson's num
! her 17, has been the big gainer. The
little scatback, who West wood fans
j think v/ill replace Johnson someday
' on the varsity, is a deadly open-field
j runner.
Power for the Bruins is supplied
by Whitey Arcenaux and two steady
j wingmen, Donn Moomaw and Ernie
Stockort, are standouts on both de
| lense and on the pass-catching. Big
i Tom Wahlgren will try to match
j slams with Papoose middle-of-the
j line stars.
LIGHT SCRUM
I For the Indian yearlings, only
light scrimmaging was allowed yes
j terday to prevent further injuries.
[ Coach Taylor was concerned over
i many of his players' ability to pk'y
j full-time ball.
Dave Eldridge will get the quar
: terback call over Joe St. Geme. Top
j spark in the backfield, Frank "Skip
i per" Crist is scheduled to start at
i fullback, but Skip will be spelled by
ever-improving Willie Barmore.
At the halves, Wes Laubschcr gets
! into the starting string, while Loren
Hinkleman and Dick Gargiulo still
I lale as a toss-up for the other. Line
S .'■ tar Norm Manoogian, nursing a
; bruised ankle from the Santa Clara
j battle, is a doubtful starter. Yester
j day, Norm's leg seemed to be re

Frosh (loach Chuck Taylor
With Coach Chuck Taylor's
impressive win streak ol 13
frosh victories hanging in the
balance, the Papoose eleven
takes on the UCLA yearling
sguad tomorrow on the Stadium
turf. Kickoff is tabbed for 2:30
p.m.
The games shapes up as a re
match of last Saturday's varsity tilt.
It's the Brubabe single wing against
the locals' T formation. It's Stan
lord with one more game of col
legiate ball against UCLA's lop
sided victory over Oceanside Col
lege. Both teams have injuries, and
plenty of 'em.

Coach Taylor, who has led three
post-war Farm frosh teams to un
