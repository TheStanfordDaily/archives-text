# Phi Delts Smother Alpha Delts, 31-0
## 
### 
Led by the stellar play of tail- !
backs Jim Aubel and John Wallace, ;
the Phi Dclt Rams overpowered the
Alpha Delts, 31-0. Combining a
!.>ood passing attack with a well exe
cuted "Notre Dame box" running
■-•«'!me. the Rams completely over
shadowed the Alphas' brave but fu- 1
tile efforts.
With the game barely begun, Au- i
bel passed to Pete Baldwin for the
first Phi Delt score. Wallace's throw
to Jack Mcßirney was good for the
'_xtra point. After that it was
strictly a Phi Delt picnic. Stopping |
cold tiie Alphas' bid for points, the 1
Delts added another counter shortly
before the end of the first half to go
ahead, 13-0.
In the second period, it was the j
same thing all over again — only!
more so. An intercepted pass by Bill ;
Farrar and a recovered fumble by ;
Gartheiy set up the Rams' fourth i
and fifth touchdowns, respectively.
In an encounter between the "boys
from up north," Stanford Village 117
tripped Village 119, 14-7. Speedster
Burr Ward sparked 117 with a pay
dirt intercepted pass return. Coming
back in the second half, the 119ers !
scored on a long run by Frisco Sar- j
tor to tie the score at 7-all. A long I
pass from Wark to Mel Wright, how
ever, cinched the victory for 117.
