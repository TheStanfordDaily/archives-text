# McElhenny Still Doubtful Starter in Husky-Card Tilt
## 
### GIL JONAS 
In a maze of Seattle fog an imminent question mark has been
shaping itself for tomorrow's Washington-Stanford game. Since
their squeaker with Utah, Coach Howie Odell's charges have
taken it on the chin thrice, by two big scores from Notre Dame
and Minnesota, and 7-3 against an underdog Oregon State eleven.

I The last one hurt the most, from
j the morale standpoint, that is.
This was a Husky team, much like
! the Card eleven, which was sup
j posed to go places. New blood in
j jected into a pitiful 1948 line-up
was supposed to provide Husky
rooters with a Rose Bowl con
| tender. What happened?
The two Midwestern powerhouses
j dished out rough football and pro
j duced the necessary scores, which j
j was expected. Just as the Cards
; supposedly profited from that Michi
i -;an experience, so did the Washing
tori players from their big ones.;
I Certainly the Cards can be no
tougher than the Gophers or the
Fighting Irish. And certainly the
Farm variation of the T presents no
1 more of a problem than Frank Lea
i hy's variety. But that Oregon State
. lo â–  , combined with a flu epidemic
\ and injuries to key players, may
Well have obliterated Husky hopes
for this year. In short, the Wash
in,!.,tomans must snap back against
I Stanford, or they're finished.
With bitter tears O'Deil crossed

off Hugh McElhenny from the list
of starters last week. Latest re
ports, however, have the sensational
tullback, who is more famous lor
his erudition with a football than
with the books, as a possible starter.
McElhenny is an outside man of the
game-buster proportions, as his 97-
yard kickoff return against Minne
sota will attest to.
With McElhenny on the shelf for
Notre Dame, big Henry Tiedemann
excelled, but he too, is a doubtful
starter due to a violent penicillin re
action.
Jack Seth, variously described as
Piston Legs" and "Helmet Smash
er" by Washington publicists, is the
Huskies' most consistent ground
gainer with a 3.1 average in (>8 tries.
Roland Kirkby, switched to half
froml'ull last spring, and Mel Davis,
ja bench-warmer last year who owns
; better than a five-yard average
I mainly garnered against OSC. pro-
I vide the other dangers on the
1 ground.
HITNKICII SHINES
irsut the Huskies use a T with in
numerable variations and the man
who can easily turn the tide in their
favor is much-publicized Don Hein
fit'h, a sophomore, hailed by many
as "the greatest quarterback on the
Coast since Gary Kerkorian." Hein
rich is a sleight-of-hand specialist,
but his passing has left much to be
desired with 10 completions in 25
attempts. The other Don, O'Leary,
not quite so astute as Heinrich in
the feeding-off department, has
been passing with uncanny accur
acy, owning a .579 percentage and
lour TD's via the air. Either one
is capable of a good afternoon and
should one come through the Card
ride home will be dismal.
The Husky flanks provide excel
lent targets for the aforementioned
passers. Slim Joe Cloidt, who nabbed
six passes for 122 yards against
OSC, leads the northern aggrega
tion with 14 completions and 218
yards on the season. Close behind
is lanky Fritz Apking with almost
200 yards gained on 11 completions.
INCONSISTENT LINE
The Husky line has played hot
and-cold ball so far, being ren
dered in tiny pieces and tossed out
;n the cold by Notre Dame and Min
nesota i'or a total of 56(5 yards, but
held more than their own against
the Utes and OSC. They lack depth,
but who on the Coast doesn't? Cen
ter Mike Michael provides the nu
cleus and is vaunted as one of the
better line-backers of the West.
Guards Charlie Gasson and Bill
Burnett have prvoen their worth,
but the tackle slot was sheared con
siderably by Notre Dame.
An indication of how strong the
Husky pass defense is can be as
certained from the records, which
show that Notre Dame did the most

j damage through the air, gaining only
107 yards, whereas the Cards hit
their low against powerful Michi-
S gan with a 110 yards. In short, it
| looks like another rough afternoon
for Stanford passers and receivers.
Whether Coach Odell. Yale's gilt
lo the PCC and along with Pappy
Waldorf rated as the Coast's top
! mentor by many, can supply the
| shot (not of penicillin) that will
enable the Huskies to roll on the
field as their paper potential per
mits is. of course, the essence of
: the question mark. This tilt, in many
j respects, is the big one for both the
Cards and Purple and Gold. A heal
thy McElhenny, a hot Heinrich, or
more Card bobbles can shatter ail
Farm Kose Bowl hopes for once
j and good.
