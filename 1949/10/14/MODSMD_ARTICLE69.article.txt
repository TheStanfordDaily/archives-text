## PEERLESS PREDICTIONS Pickers Tab Stanford, Trojans as Winners 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Ouch!
After last week's predictions, any
| body who reads today's Peerless
i (hah!) Pickers' prognostications
! should be given a complete psychi
| atric examination. But we'll call
| 'em anyway, for the pleasure of our
i more sadistic readers.
The Pickers' average, following
the catastrophic results of last Sat
urday's grid battles, has plummeted
from a whimpering .(537 to a sour
| .590. Of ten scribes calling the
! weekly shots, only Gil Jonas has
'shown the slightest tendency toward
j rationality. Gil leads the puck with
j i .727 score.
Th Stanford-UCLA debacle was,
; of course, the toughest blow of all.
! But OSC's yardless win over Wash
ington. Army's trample of Michi
gan, and the surprising antics of
| such underdogs as Colorfado A&M
•»nd USF, delivered further erush
! ing blows to what self-confidence
j we had left.
Anyway, that's water under the
: bridge now. We've a I erawlod out
1 from under the table (where we ran
into John Hall), adjusted our type
; writers, and plunged headlong itno
| another weekend of fearless peerless
j picking.
Perhaps this time any resem
blance between our choices and the
winners of tomorrow's games will
| be more than a coincidence:
Stanford - Washington: The In
j dians are one of the major reasons
j for our sickly average this season.
I Perhaps we're stubborn, but we're
stringing alon;> with the Indians
1 again this time. A unanimous bal
j lot for Marchie's men by 13 points.

I Oregon - Colorado: Neither team
' seems to be going anywhere in its !
home conferer.ce, but the Ducks |
have nearly the same squad that j
; tied for the Coast crown last year.
Oregon by 20.
C'al - USC. First the Bears lost j
| Jensen. Now Sarver and Schabarum
i have folded. And the Trojans are
j still the logical Rose Bowl choice.
It's unanimous again, USC by 10.
Michigan-Northwestern: The Wol
i verines will fce feeling mean this
j week. Even without Ortmann
they've got what it takes to ride
over Northwestern by 11.
Army - Harvard: One picker chose
the Cadets by 102 points. But the
consensus is more conservative:
Army by 31.
, L'C'LA - Santa Clara: The Bruins
! left the Farm physically fit, and
! they're due for a good day tomor
row. We pick 'em by 10.
Notre Damc-Tulane: This is the
j top battle of the day. Both are un
defeated and untied.The contest is
beinj> played up as a grudge match,
with '1 ttlane seeking revenge for
that wicked 1947 licking. They won't
get it, say the pickers, who choose
the Irish by 10.
