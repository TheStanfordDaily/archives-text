# Soccer Practice Points to Aggies
## 
### 
Under the pressure of the immi
nent approach of its first game,
j against the Cal Aggies Saturday, the
' soccer team has settled down seri
| ously to the business of scoring
, goals—with team play.
Alter an unrecognizable scries of
! high, aimless kicks and no parsing
, in the early weeks, the veterans are
i beginning to hit their stride.
Led by Captain Amos Salvador
• and Harry Havilio. the varsity has
| been scoring freely against the sec
i ond and third strings.
The team has also been strength-
I ened by the appointment of taciturn
Etem Barlas as assistant coach. He
j runs the scrimmages from the field
ant! has been valuable in teaching
; the younger members ol the squad
| the fundamentals of the game.
