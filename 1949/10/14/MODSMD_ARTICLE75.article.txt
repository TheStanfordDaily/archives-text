# Sweet Music For Study Spins From KZSU's Cage
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
Down the basement of Memorial
Hall, enclosed in a chicken-wire
structure, appropriately called a
"cage," sits KZSU's music director,
Kay McKenna.
Surrounding her and her stall is
KZSU's libra! y of 1,800 records.
In the shelves arc 1,600 popular,
150 semi-classical, and 50 classical
records. Using these, plus discs from
one other important source, Kay and
her staff supply music for 17 hours
and 35 minutes per week of KZSU
record shows.
The other important source is
Hage's Stanford Music Shop in Palo
Alto, which supplies records for
"Cardinal Classics," four hours of
classical music each week.

It is the job of Kay's stuff to sup
p'y each new record wtih file cai'ds,
six for each disc. They choose music
for about four hours each night, type
"formats" for announcers and engi
neers, and try to keep from dupli
cating records from night to night.
"Docs it keep you busy?" asked
this reporter.
"It does," smiled Kay. "It chives
me mad."
Roughly 7o per cent of KZSU's air
time is devoted to recorded music
shows.
"Your Stanford station" has found
that this kind of programming pays
off in listener value. In a Hooper
type survey held last spring quar
ter, KZSU claimed 21.8 per cent of
the campus radio audience, more
than any other station.
KZSU puts the accent on music
partly because "that's what the stu
dents want when they're studying."
says Program Director Chuck Black.
But there are other reasons. "Our
prime purpose is to train people for
work in commercial radio." she ex
plained. "Naturally we include mu
sic shows."

Station Manager Mary Hill said
thai most people who look for jobs
in radio are first shunted into music
shows. "Wt try to give them expe
rience in the tilings they arc most
likely to do when they get out."
Also, music shows call for less
lime and work than other shows.
KZSU's weekly comedy, "Rouph n'
Ready," uses about six actors, and
various typists and assistants. It re
quires four hours of rehearsal. The
simple recorded music show can be
prepared by one person and an
nounced by another.
Of the station's 1.800 records, 1,600

are "popular 01 ils 17 hours and
35 minutes ol recorded music, 13
hours and 5 minutes are '"popular."
The Jlooptr-t • "j)c survey showed,
however, that the "Cardinal Clas
sics" show, on the ;iii' from 8 to !•
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and
Thursday, is among KZSU's top
shows.
