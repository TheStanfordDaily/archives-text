# ‘Drive Slower’ Advise Police
## 
### 
Traffic on May.ield Avenue, near
the elementary school on the cam
pus, has been "entirely too fast,"
Police Chief Gordon Davis warned
yesterday.
Chief Davis said that children go
ing to and from school have had to
get out of the way of automobiles
in order to avoid being run down.
Automobiles should stop completely
and wait until the children have
crossed the street, he said.
Extreme caution is necessary,
Chief Davis advised, especially be
tween the hours of 0 a.m. and 2
p.m., when most children arc using
the crossings.
