# Improvements in Progress Cost University $176,000
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
An old landmark disappeared
from the campus Wednesday,
the victim of modern technol
ogy and an improved steam
system. Gone is the old smoke
stack from atop the steam plant
on Galvez.
The pipe, shortened because of its
unsightliness when Frost Amphi
theater was built, was the successor
to the famous 100-foot stack on the
Engineering corner which collapsed
; n the 1 !HM) earthquake.
NEW BOILER UMTS
The removal of the stfick was only
one phase of $178,000 in improve
ments which the University started
to make on the steam plant this
summer. Two boiler units, which
had turned out steam for University
residences since 1002, were torn out
and are being replaced with a new
1,000-horsepower unit.
When completed, four boilers will
turn out :>.OOO I oiler horsepower,
compared to the 1,800- horsepower
capacity reached last year. The in
stallation of four blower fans and
short smoke stacks, which will re
place the old landmark, will help
boo t the capacity.

area were placed on the system so

are contained in tunnels.

A preliminary survey of the cam

gineering students this summer, and
their report will be the basis for fu

An old landmark disappeared
from the campus Wednesday,
the victim of modern technol
ogy and an improved steam
system. Gone is the old smoke
stack from atop the steam plant
on Galvez.
The pipe, shortened because of its
unsightliness when Frost Amphi
theater was built, was the successor
to the famous 100-foot stack on the
Engineering corner which collapsed
; n the 1 !HM) earthquake.
NEW BOILER UMTS
The removal of the stfick was only
one phase of $178,000 in improve
ments which the University started
to make on the steam plant this
summer. Two boiler units, which
had turned out steam for University
residences since 1002, were torn out
and are being replaced with a new
1,000-horsepower unit.
When completed, four boilers will
turn out :>.OOO I oiler horsepower,
compared to the 1,800- horsepower
capacity reached last year. The in
stallation of four blower fans and
short smoke stacks, which will re
place the old landmark, will help
boo t the capacity.
