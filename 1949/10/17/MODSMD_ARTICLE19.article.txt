# Big Red Clicks, Downs Huskies in 40-0 Rout
## Husky Fumbled, Cardinal Scored 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
Slanford's Big Red Machine,
temporarily sidetracked for the
last two weeks, broke loose with
a rash of touchdowns Saturday
afternoon to crush the hapless
University of Washington Hus
kies, 40 to 0.
Coach Marchie Schwartz Indians j
could do no wrong in this contest. !
Their only fumble of the game came !
on the last play in the first half, and i
did no damage. There were no in- j
tcreepted passes to bog down Stan- j
ford scoring marches, as was the I
ease in the Michigan and UCLA I
games.
The final score came as a terrific
jolt to some 33,500 paying customers. I
They watched Washington drive to !
the Stanford 15 early in the first j
quarter, and it. seemed as though
' the Indians could not untrack them
! selves. Washington fans were look- j
j ing for a possible upset.

(i PLAYS—X!) YARDS
However, after an exchange of ,
punts, the Indians drove 89 yards j
in six plays to start the scoring j
parade. Boyd Benson accounted for j,
;Hi yards in four carries, but it was i
Bill DcYoung's smash through left
tackle for 48 yards that set up the
touchdown. Benson crashed through
j the same hole on the next play to I
! score from eight, yards out. Ker
! korian converted, and the rout was j
i on.
The Indians scored twice within
i two minutes in the second quarter,
both coming as the result of Wash- \
ington fumbles. Gary Kcrkorian
passed to Bill McColl from the eight
| yard line for the first Cardinal
1 touchdown of the period, but Kcr- '
S korian's placement was wido.
HUSKIES FUMBLE ON .">
A minute later Don Hcinrich fum
' bled while attempting to pass, and
Wes Poulson fell on the ball on the
Washington five. DeYoung powered
I over from the one-yard line on third
down, but Kcrkorian's conversion
| attempt was blocked.
Stanford left the field at halftimc
with a 19 to 0 lead, which made the
1 1,000 Stanford rooters and alumni
1 very happy. The Huskies, however. !
had an 11 1o 7 edge in first downs
1 during this half of the game.
TIIIKD-QUARTKR BLUES
The third quarter found rough
traveling for the Indians. Alter re
ceiving the kickofT, the Indians -
! gambled on fourth down, two to go
and lost the ball on the Washington
45. The Huskies kept possession of
the ball for most of the quarter, but

could not push over for a touch- j
down.
In the fourth quarter the Indians j
scored three more times on marches
of (ifi, fi7, and 40 yards. The scoring
plays found Bob White circling left ,
end from the 8, Bud Klein dancing i
over from the 12. and Klein again
pushing the pigskin over from the 2.
Kerkorian converted after all three
touchdowns.
RAGING INDIANS
The Indians just couldn't be dc- ;
nied. When Washington drove to j
the Stanford one-yard line in the
third quarter, the Indian forward
rose up to smite the Husky attack.
Jim Castagnoli broke through to
smear Hugh McElhcnny on fourth
down for a three-yard loss. McEl
hcnny had to be helped off the field
! after that one.
Schwartz gave all 37 of his stal
warts a good workout. The few who
hadn't been in the game prior to
the fourth quarter played practically
1 all of the final period.
Davcy Eield and Ken Peek played
brilliant defensive games, as they
wcer forced to come up and make
many, many stops. Field added to
his glory by making two leaping
pass interceptions of long passes.
Castagnoli and Jesse Cone played
well in the line.
SPEEDY BACKS
Stanford's flock of speedy backs
all ran hard and last. Benson and
DeYoung led the r•t hali attack,
while Klein. Andrews, and White
1 carried the burden in the second
! half.
DeYoung led the individual sta
i tistics with 08 yards gained in 8
carries. White and Klein each ac
j counted for !!(? yards.
Sophomore Gary Kerkorian called
a tremendous game, aiu." iived up to
his reputation for the first time this
season. He mixed his plays up very
well, and completed four out of four
passes in the first half. He also used
: the quarterback sneak to good ad

vantage, and picked up yards n>
three carrics.
Tom Shaw also looked very good
during his brief appearance in th<-
fourth quarter. He directed the team
<>7 yards in 13 plays for Stanford's
fifth touchdown. He completed three
passes in four attempts for 34 yard .
during the march. His other pass
was a 40-yard throw that fell just
short of the fleet Rupc Andrews on
the 10-yard line.
Dick Horn played a good share of
the game, but he did not meet with
the success that Kerkorian did. Hi
37-yard pass to John Banks in the
waning moments of the game was
the game was the longest comph 1
tion of the contest.

KEY MEN IIURT

! half, camc with great regularity
i Each team lost four key men in the
i rugged game.
Stanford iost three of its best.
1 line backers in tHo first half. Wes

i not known, but it is doubtful that
the four linemen will be ready f<>i
the Oregon State game next Satin -
! day.
Washington was even harder hit.
Jack Seth, their star right half, broke
his collarbone and will be out for
the remainder of the season. Roland
Kirkfcy reinjured his shoulder and
will be out for several weeks. Be
sides McElhcnny, lineman George
. Bayer and Bill Burnett were also
forced to the sidelines.
Stanford defensive strategy al
lowed Washington to complete man
short passes from their winged 'I'
formation. However, when the Hus
kies penetrated deep into Stanford
territory, the Indians back were able
ito move up and cover the Wi<sh-
I ington receivers very effectively.

and lost the ball on the Washington
45. The Huskies kept possession of
the ball for most of the quarter, but

could not push over for a touch- j
down.
In the fourth quarter the Indians j
scored three more times on marches
of (ifi, fi7, and 40 yards. The scoring
plays found Bob White circling left ,

over from the 12. and Klein again

touchdowns.
RAGING INDIANS
The Indians just couldn't be dc- ;
nied. When Washington drove to j
the Stanford one-yard line in the
third quarter, the Indian forward
rose up to smite the Husky attack.
Jim Castagnoli broke through to
smear Hugh McElhcnny on fourth
down for a three-yard loss. McEl
hcnny had to be helped off the field
! after that one.
Schwartz gave all 37 of his stal
warts a good workout. The few who
hadn't been in the game prior to
the fourth quarter played practically
1 all of the final period.
Davcy Eield and Ken Peek played
brilliant defensive games, as they
wcer forced to come up and make
many, many stops. Field added to

pass interceptions of long passes.
Castagnoli and Jesse Cone played
well in the line.
SPEEDY BACKS

all ran hard and last. Benson and
DeYoung led the r•t hali attack,
while Klein. Andrews, and White
1 carried the burden in the second
! half.
DeYoung led the individual sta
i tistics with 08 yards gained in 8
carries. White and Klein each ac
j counted for !!(? yards.
Sophomore Gary Kerkorian called
a tremendous game, aiu." iived up to
his reputation for the first time this
season. He mixed his plays up very
well, and completed four out of four
passes in the first half. He also used
: the quarterback sneak to good ad

vantage, and picked up yards n>
three carrics.
Tom Shaw also looked very good
during his brief appearance in th<-
fourth quarter. He directed the team
<>7 yards in 13 plays for Stanford's
fifth touchdown. He completed three
passes in four attempts for 34 yard .
during the march. His other pass
was a 40-yard throw that fell just
short of the fleet Rupc Andrews on
the 10-yard line.
Dick Horn played a good share of
the game, but he did not meet with
the success that Kerkorian did. Hi
37-yard pass to John Banks in the
waning moments of the game was
the game was the longest comph 1
tion of the contest.

quarter, and it. seemed as though

(i PLAYS—X!) YARDS
However, after an exchange of ,
punts, the Indians drove 89 yards j
in six plays to start the scoring j
parade. Boyd Benson accounted for j,
;Hi yards in four carries, but it was i
Bill DcYoung's smash through left
tackle for 48 yards that set up the
touchdown. Benson crashed through
j the same hole on the next play to I
! score from eight, yards out. Ker
! korian converted, and the rout was j
i on.
The Indians scored twice within
i two minutes in the second quarter,
both coming as the result of Wash- \
ington fumbles. Gary Kcrkorian
passed to Bill McColl from the eight
| yard line for the first Cardinal
1 touchdown of the period, but Kcr- '
S korian's placement was wido.
HUSKIES FUMBLE ON .">
A minute later Don Hcinrich fum
' bled while attempting to pass, and
Wes Poulson fell on the ball on the
Washington five. DeYoung powered
I over from the one-yard line on third
down, but Kcrkorian's conversion
| attempt was blocked.
Stanford left the field at halftimc
with a 19 to 0 lead, which made the
1 1,000 Stanford rooters and alumni
1 very happy. The Huskies, however. !
had an 11 1o 7 edge in first downs
1 during this half of the game.
TIIIKD-QUARTKR BLUES
The third quarter found rough
traveling for the Indians. Alter re
ceiving the kickofT, the Indians -
! gambled on fourth down, two to go
and lost the ball on the Washington
45. The Huskies kept possession of
the ball for most of the quarter, but

could not push over for a touch- j
down.
In the fourth quarter the Indians j
scored three more times on marches
of (ifi, fi7, and 40 yards. The scoring
plays found Bob White circling left ,
end from the 8, Bud Klein dancing i
over from the 12. and Klein again
pushing the pigskin over from the 2.
Kerkorian converted after all three
touchdowns.
RAGING INDIANS
The Indians just couldn't be dc- ;
nied. When Washington drove to j
the Stanford one-yard line in the
third quarter, the Indian forward
rose up to smite the Husky attack.
Jim Castagnoli broke through to
smear Hugh McElhcnny on fourth
down for a three-yard loss. McEl
hcnny had to be helped off the field
! after that one.
Schwartz gave all 37 of his stal
warts a good workout. The few who
hadn't been in the game prior to
the fourth quarter played practically
1 all of the final period.
Davcy Eield and Ken Peek played
brilliant defensive games, as they
wcer forced to come up and make
many, many stops. Field added to
his glory by making two leaping
pass interceptions of long passes.
Castagnoli and Jesse Cone played
well in the line.
SPEEDY BACKS
Stanford's flock of speedy backs
all ran hard and last. Benson and
DeYoung led the r•t hali attack,
while Klein. Andrews, and White
1 carried the burden in the second
! half.
DeYoung led the individual sta
i tistics with 08 yards gained in 8
carries. White and Klein each ac
j counted for !!(? yards.
Sophomore Gary Kerkorian called
a tremendous game, aiu." iived up to
his reputation for the first time this
season. He mixed his plays up very
well, and completed four out of four
passes in the first half. He also used
: the quarterback sneak to good ad

vantage, and picked up yards n>
three carrics.
Tom Shaw also looked very good
during his brief appearance in th<-
fourth quarter. He directed the team
<>7 yards in 13 plays for Stanford's
fifth touchdown. He completed three
passes in four attempts for 34 yard .
during the march. His other pass
was a 40-yard throw that fell just
short of the fleet Rupc Andrews on
the 10-yard line.
Dick Horn played a good share of
the game, but he did not meet with
the success that Kerkorian did. Hi
37-yard pass to John Banks in the
waning moments of the game was
the game was the longest comph 1
tion of the contest.
