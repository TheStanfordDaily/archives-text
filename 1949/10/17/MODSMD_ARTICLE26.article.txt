# It's Later Than We Think

Construction of the first unit of the new
Tresidder Union Building should begin within
the next year.
Contrary to popular opinion which has er
roneously tabbed the new union as a project
which will take form sometime around the
year 1960, the report of last year's ASSU
Union Planning Committee states that we
should be financially able to go ahead with
the construction of a restaurant and ballroom
in 1950 or 1951.
Funds collected through spring quarter to
failed approximately $200,000, and donations,
Union profits, and the "dollar per student per
quarter" collected with tuition should swell
the Union Building Fund to close to $300,000
before the year is over.
Financially, at least, we're all set. But will
we be ready to go otherwise?
Tryouts for this year's Union Planning
Committee were held Thursday afternoon in
the ASSU Excom room, and only a handful
of students, mostly freshmen, showed up. Is
everyone on the Farm too busy with studies
and other activities, or is it that the students
just don't care what goes into the new Union
Building?
This year's committee will be comprised of
eight or nine students, and ably headed by
Chairman Dan Stone. The group will consider
the report of last year's committee which con
cerned itself chiefly with broad policy mat
ters and overall planning, and then proceed
with more detailed work.
In brief, the '48 '49 committee recom
mended that:
1. The Union should not be constructed as
one building, but as a related group of build
ings. These separate structures would be
erected one at a time as funds became avail
able.

2. The first priority should be given to a
restaurant and a ballroom. Other things like
student office space and recreation lounges,
which are not so urgently needed, could come
later.
3. The traditional Stanford architecture of
buff walls, red tile roofs, and Romanesque
arches should be preserved.
4. Students, who generally have consider
able knowledge of ballrooms and the plan
ning and holding of dances, should do much
of the detailed planning of the ballroom.
Restaurant planning, however, should be left
to persons who have special knowledge of
restaurant construction and management.
5. It would be desirable to have at least
one University employee working on Union
problems full time. This person would furnish
continuity which would carry over from plan
ning to construction, to operation of facilities
when completed.
This year'.s committee need not be bound
by these recommendations, but must act on
them soon in order that more detailed work
be started. Problems of the location of the
Tresidder Union and the future use of pres
ent Union facilities must also be worked out
by this group.
Committee tryouts will continue this after
noon and tomorrow beginning at 3:15 in the
ASSU Exccm room.
If you wish to work on the committee, drop
over. It makes no difference whether you
have had experience in this type of work, or
whether you're just an interested student with
a lot of ideas. The only requirement is that
you have enough free time to participate fully
in the planning.

easily corrected on paper, but less so after
the concrete is poured."

continuity which would carry over from plan
ning to construction, to operation of facilities
when completed.
This year'.s committee need not be bound
by these recommendations, but must act on
them soon in order that more detailed work
be started. Problems of the location of the
Tresidder Union and the future use of pres
ent Union facilities must also be worked out
by this group.
Committee tryouts will continue this after
noon and tomorrow beginning at 3:15 in the
ASSU Exccm room.
If you wish to work on the committee, drop
over. It makes no difference whether you
have had experience in this type of work, or
whether you're just an interested student with
a lot of ideas. The only requirement is that
you have enough free time to participate fully
in the planning.
As last year's report said: "Mistakes are
easily corrected on paper, but less so after
the concrete is poured."
Construction of the first unit of the new
Tresidder Union Building should begin within
the next year.
Contrary to popular opinion which has er
roneously tabbed the new union as a project
which will take form sometime around the
year 1960, the report of last year's ASSU
Union Planning Committee states that we
should be financially able to go ahead with
the construction of a restaurant and ballroom
in 1950 or 1951.
Funds collected through spring quarter to
failed approximately $200,000, and donations,
Union profits, and the "dollar per student per
quarter" collected with tuition should swell
the Union Building Fund to close to $300,000
before the year is over.
Financially, at least, we're all set. But will
we be ready to go otherwise?
Tryouts for this year's Union Planning
Committee were held Thursday afternoon in
the ASSU Excom room, and only a handful
of students, mostly freshmen, showed up. Is
everyone on the Farm too busy with studies
and other activities, or is it that the students
just don't care what goes into the new Union
Building?
This year's committee will be comprised of
eight or nine students, and ably headed by
Chairman Dan Stone. The group will consider
the report of last year's committee which con
cerned itself chiefly with broad policy mat
ters and overall planning, and then proceed
with more detailed work.
In brief, the '48 '49 committee recom
mended that:
1. The Union should not be constructed as
one building, but as a related group of build
ings. These separate structures would be
erected one at a time as funds became avail
able.

2. The first priority should be given to a
restaurant and a ballroom. Other things like
student office space and recreation lounges,
which are not so urgently needed, could come
later.
3. The traditional Stanford architecture of
buff walls, red tile roofs, and Romanesque
arches should be preserved.
4. Students, who generally have consider
able knowledge of ballrooms and the plan
ning and holding of dances, should do much
of the detailed planning of the ballroom.
Restaurant planning, however, should be left
to persons who have special knowledge of
restaurant construction and management.
5. It would be desirable to have at least
one University employee working on Union
problems full time. This person would furnish
continuity which would carry over from plan
ning to construction, to operation of facilities
when completed.
