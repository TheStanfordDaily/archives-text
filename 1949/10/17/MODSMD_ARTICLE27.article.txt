# BULL SESSION

### JOHN BODNAR 
1 was lumbering back from the Library late one
r.ight when I heard the sound of an incantation: "Fire
burn and cauldron bubble . . . Just another fra
ternity man going through his rituals, 1 thought.
From the brush bounded a little man doing cart
wheels. Seeing me, he careened to a stop, and mo
tioned at me with the dead mice he held in his hand.
"Who who are you?" I asked as graciously as my
quaking knees would allow.
Corning closer, he whispered into my ear, "I make
the coffee that's served in the Cellar."
"Say, you're just (he man I want to see."
I'ietty bad stuff, isn't it?"
"I should say. Do you think I've got an iron-bound
esophagus?"
"I'm glad you like it."
"Like it?"' I screeched. "That stuff I wouldn't even
wish on my profs. How about some good coffee?"
"But friend, you don't understand," he said grasp
ing my lapels. "Anybody can make good coffee, but
it takes talent to make had coffee."
"Talent?"
"Why sure, I've been teaching my technique to
coeds and brides for years. 'Bad coffee every day
will keep the doctor in his pay,' that's my motto," he
chuckled.
"Well, maybe you've got something there." His
logic had me baffled.
"You can bet your bottom cup of coffee on that,"
he said, playfully nudging me in the ribs. "Let me
: how you how it's done."
We moved to a lighter spot, and I got a clearer
view of him. He stood about three feet high, wore

pantaloons of burlap and a dickie ol soggy napkins.
"Look here," he said pointing to a bag ol old shoes,
broken pottery, beer caps, and the scalp of an Encina
water-bagging victim. "These are the tools ol my
trade."
"(lolly, yours must be a noble profession.'
"Verily, forsooth, and indeed," he said. "I learned
those clever expressions from you clever college
boys."
"Holy smokes, you're educated, too.'
"Inconti overt ibly so, but enough of this jovial
P?.tter. 1 must to work." He loaded the cauldron
with the flotsam and began to stir it."I used dead
cats until the Village complained that I was cutting
la to tneir lood supply."
I was awestruck. No longer could I feel any antip
athy toward Cellar coffee, knowing how it was made.
"Double double, toil and trouble, fire burn and
cauldron I übble- I snuck into one of Miss Bailey's
Shapkespeare classes once," he said. The mystic
lites continued until he felt that the mixture had
i t ached the desired point of savoryness.
Tasting the mixture, he turned colors and con
vulsed. I was long in reviving him and when he did
come to, he looked up at me and said, "It is for
rare moments like these that an artist like myself
lives."
Tears clouded my eyes as I thought of his in
domitable spirit his artistic sense, his awful coffee.
To thin! that the only honor I had accorded this
genius was that at 10:03 every morning, I uncere
moniously spat out his coffee.

I was awestruck. No longer could I feel any antip

"Double double, toil and trouble, fire burn and
cauldron I übble- I snuck into one of Miss Bailey's
Shapkespeare classes once," he said. The mystic
lites continued until he felt that the mixture had
i t ached the desired point of savoryness.
Tasting the mixture, he turned colors and con
vulsed. I was long in reviving him and when he did
come to, he looked up at me and said, "It is for
rare moments like these that an artist like myself
lives."
Tears clouded my eyes as I thought of his in
domitable spirit his artistic sense, his awful coffee.
To thin! that the only honor I had accorded this
genius was that at 10:03 every morning, I uncere
moniously spat out his coffee.
1 was lumbering back from the Library late one
r.ight when I heard the sound of an incantation: "Fire
burn and cauldron bubble . . . Just another fra
ternity man going through his rituals, 1 thought.
From the brush bounded a little man doing cart
wheels. Seeing me, he careened to a stop, and mo
tioned at me with the dead mice he held in his hand.
"Who who are you?" I asked as graciously as my
quaking knees would allow.
Corning closer, he whispered into my ear, "I make
the coffee that's served in the Cellar."
"Say, you're just (he man I want to see."
I'ietty bad stuff, isn't it?"
"I should say. Do you think I've got an iron-bound
esophagus?"
"I'm glad you like it."
"Like it?"' I screeched. "That stuff I wouldn't even
wish on my profs. How about some good coffee?"
"But friend, you don't understand," he said grasp
ing my lapels. "Anybody can make good coffee, but
it takes talent to make had coffee."
"Talent?"
"Why sure, I've been teaching my technique to
coeds and brides for years. 'Bad coffee every day
will keep the doctor in his pay,' that's my motto," he
chuckled.
"Well, maybe you've got something there." His
logic had me baffled.
"You can bet your bottom cup of coffee on that,"
he said, playfully nudging me in the ribs. "Let me
: how you how it's done."
We moved to a lighter spot, and I got a clearer
view of him. He stood about three feet high, wore

pantaloons of burlap and a dickie ol soggy napkins.
"Look here," he said pointing to a bag ol old shoes,
broken pottery, beer caps, and the scalp of an Encina
water-bagging victim. "These are the tools ol my
trade."
"(lolly, yours must be a noble profession.'
"Verily, forsooth, and indeed," he said. "I learned
those clever expressions from you clever college
boys."
"Holy smokes, you're educated, too.'
"Inconti overt ibly so, but enough of this jovial
P?.tter. 1 must to work." He loaded the cauldron
with the flotsam and began to stir it."I used dead
cats until the Village complained that I was cutting
