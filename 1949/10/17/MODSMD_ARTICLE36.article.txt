Two and a half years ago inter
[ national activities on the Farm fol
lowed the same haphazard pattern
t typical of most universities. Today
the Stanford Institute of Interna
tiona) Relations is recognized
I throughout the world by students,
govei nments, and the Ulli tt*< 1 Na
tions,
The framework of the organiza
tion is being used as a model by
many other colleges throughout the
United States.
The lIR was set up in May 1947 to
co-ordinate student international ac-
I t iv it it's. It now includes six difl'er-
I ent committees which do everything I
{ front sending relief bundles abroad
to organizing high school interna
tional groups and giving parties
where Farm students from abroad j
can meet the American .students !
here.
The Institute of International He-
I
I lalions, impressive as the name
! sounds, is an nil-student organiza
; lion there are no laculty or admin
istration advisors unless the stu- j
dents specifically ask for their help
—and it includes every registered
student fit Stanford.
Working on the various commit
tees is as simple as walking into the
office at the rear of the Quad Shack
land saying, "What can I do this
1 afternoon?"
The six committees are:
SIKO Stanford International Re
lief Organization, which sends cloth
ing, books, school supplies, and othej
needed items to countries through
out the world.
UN Education Center—which dis
tributes information about the UN
and its accomplishments throughout

California by means of monthly
bulletins and student speakers.
Survey Committee — members of
which gather information on travel
and other conditions in foreign
countries. Last year they were in
charge of the student delegates lrom
the Western States for an NSA in
ternational conference in South
America.
Stanford Council on UNESCO
which gathers information on arid
helj >s students with foreign study
and travel problems.
Conference Committee — which
plans and conducts conferences
among colleges and high schools, and
Mnall campus discussions on inter
national problems.
International Club, or 'T' Club —
a social club for students from all
nations. It is open to all students
on campus, providing an opportunity
for foreign students and American
students to meet each other.
An independent committee con
nected by common activities with
the Institute of International Rela
tions is the Foreign Scholarship
Committee. This committee, origin
ated last year, has brought two
groups of six students from foreign

nations to study at Stanford on
scholarships. Money for the scholar
ships comes jointly from ASSU and
administration funds and provides
tuition, board and room, transpor
tation, and spending money.
