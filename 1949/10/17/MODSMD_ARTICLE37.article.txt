# Cal and Santa Clara Loom as Tough Foes
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Two upsets high lighted Coast grid
activities over the weekend. Cali
fornia and Santa Clara emerged as
surprise winners while USC and
UCLA were the stunned victims.
At Berkeley a crippled California
team, sparked by Frank Brunk's
102 - yard runback of a kiekoff,
dumped the Trojans 1(5 to 10. Five
backs, Brunk, Celeri, Montague,
Monachino, and Scott, carried the
entire offensive load for the Bears.
The fast-charging Bear line bot
tled up the vaunted Trojan ground
attack for most of the game. In fact
it was the Cal forwards who pro
vided the final two points as they
trapped Troy quarterback Wilbur
Robertson in his own end zone in
the final minutes of play.
CAL OUT-GAINED
For the Trojans it was a tough
one to lose, but the Bears were high
for this one and were not to be
denied. USC actually outgained Cal
by dint of yardage gained on passes,
but their inability to penetrate the
Bear line spelled defeat.
In Los Angeles the expected col
lapse of UCLA finally occurred.
Santa Clara, after a shaky start,
broke loose for two touchdowns in
the final period and went on to win

their fourth straight game 14 to 0.
The Bruins came within one yard
of scoring in the first period, but the
Drones stopped Johnson just short
of the goal on fourth down, and the
Bruins never came close again.
JOHNSON STOPPED
In fact Ernie Johnsan was smoth
ered most of the afternoon as his
average of —2.11 yards per carry
indicates. The Broncos were led
sy sub quarterback Johnny Pasco,
whose passing, running, and field
generalship enabled Santa Clara to
put together touchdown marches of
50 and 43 yards respectively.
The improvement of Santa Clara
means that Stanford faces three
tough games during the final five
weeks of the season. Oregon State
and Idaho can be written off as
second-rate competition.
The Beavers romped to a G3 to 14
win over lowly Montana last week
end at Corvallis. The Oregon Stat
ers are finally back at full strength
after a siege with the flu.
At Moscow Washington State de
feated Idaho 35 to 13 for the twenty
third consecutive time. One thing
can be said for the hapless Vandals
—they never stoft trying.

broke loose for two touchdowns in
the final period and went on to win

their fourth straight game 14 to 0.
The Bruins came within one yard
of scoring in the first period, but the
Drones stopped Johnson just short
of the goal on fourth down, and the
Bruins never came close again.
JOHNSON STOPPED
In fact Ernie Johnsan was smoth
ered most of the afternoon as his
average of —2.11 yards per carry
indicates. The Broncos were led
sy sub quarterback Johnny Pasco,
whose passing, running, and field
generalship enabled Santa Clara to
put together touchdown marches of
50 and 43 yards respectively.
The improvement of Santa Clara
means that Stanford faces three
tough games during the final five
weeks of the season. Oregon State
and Idaho can be written off as
second-rate competition.
The Beavers romped to a G3 to 14
win over lowly Montana last week
end at Corvallis. The Oregon Stat
ers are finally back at full strength
after a siege with the flu.
At Moscow Washington State de
feated Idaho 35 to 13 for the twenty
third consecutive time. One thing
can be said for the hapless Vandals
—they never stoft trying.
Two upsets high lighted Coast grid
activities over the weekend. Cali
fornia and Santa Clara emerged as
surprise winners while USC and
UCLA were the stunned victims.
At Berkeley a crippled California
team, sparked by Frank Brunk's
102 - yard runback of a kiekoff,
dumped the Trojans 1(5 to 10. Five
backs, Brunk, Celeri, Montague,
Monachino, and Scott, carried the
entire offensive load for the Bears.
The fast-charging Bear line bot
tled up the vaunted Trojan ground
attack for most of the game. In fact
it was the Cal forwards who pro
vided the final two points as they
trapped Troy quarterback Wilbur
Robertson in his own end zone in
the final minutes of play.
CAL OUT-GAINED
For the Trojans it was a tough
one to lose, but the Bears were high
for this one and were not to be
denied. USC actually outgained Cal
by dint of yardage gained on passes,
but their inability to penetrate the
Bear line spelled defeat.
In Los Angeles the expected col
lapse of UCLA finally occurred.
Santa Clara, after a shaky start,
broke loose for two touchdowns in
the final period and went on to win

their fourth straight game 14 to 0.
