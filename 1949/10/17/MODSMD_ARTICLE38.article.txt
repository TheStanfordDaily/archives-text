# Soccer Team Ties Aggies
## 
### 
A sensational last-minute goal by
second-string forward Rhoal, who ]
came in at left wing "to give the
starting line a rest," gained a 2-2 j
tie with the Cal Aggies on Stan
ford field Saturday.
The Aggies from Sacramento ,
scored early in the second half to ;
make the score 2-1 and the game j
looked like it would go into the
records that way when our "soc
cers" could not solve the Davis boys'
defense.
Then, with less than a minute.
Phoal receoved a precision pass
from one of his teammates and j
arched a low. slanting kick in from j
the left side.
Stanford's first goal was scored by
that amazing import from the Ar- '
gentine, Harry Havilio. The chunky, |
barrel-chested right inside >is all I
over the field, using his head and j
feet with equal co-ordination. He j
scored midway in the first half to
equalize a previous Aggie counter.
The outstanding player on either j
team was the Cards' two-year all
conference right halfback, Homi
Irani. Homi has been taking it easy |
in practice this year because of in
juries suffered in previous seasons.
But he gave it his all in the game
and it looks like the third straight j
yera of all - conference honors for
Irani.
