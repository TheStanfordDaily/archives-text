# Mermen Sink Trojans, 4 to 3
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
An inspired Stanford water polo
team, led by the Cards' ace swim
mer Ralph Sala, upset a highly rated
Southern California squad last Fri
day 4 to 3 and then, to make it a
perfect weekend, they downed Ful
lerton Junior College 5 to 3 Satur-*
day morning.
Sala, who was switched from
guard to forward only last week,
scored two beautiful goals in the
second half to sew up the Trojan
game for the once-defeated Cards.
Sala's clincher was a difficult
back - hand shot which completely
fooled the Trojan goalie. The point
put the Indians ahead 4 to 2, and
USC was never able to overcome
the lead.
The game was a rough one all the
way, with Stanford guards Captain
Ken Fox, Ernie Polte, and Hub
Stokely completely bottling up
Troy's usually high - scoring for
wards.
A particularly brilliant game was
turned in hy Fox, who held USC's
sprint ace Burns to a single goal.
FLETCHER SUPERB
Kim Fletcher, Indian goalie, also
performed remarkably in his posi
tion. He batted out many close
shots, and with the help of the Card
guards, kept the ball out of scoring
range most of the way through the
j contest.
It was forward Bob Frojan who
! gave the Indians a 2 to 1 half-time
l advantage. A 10-foot whip shot in
j the opening minutes by Frojan sent
i the Cards into the lead 1 to 0, and
I after USC had tied up the contest
; 1 to 1, he sent in* another point
i from the left-hand side late in the
second quarter.
After Sala had moved the score
up 3 to 1, to open the second half,
i Trojan veteran Ed Illsey made his
! second goal of the afternoon to
I close up the gap 3 to 2. This set the
stage for Sala's game-winning back
| hand shot.
A desperate point by the Trojans
in the waning moments of the game
| made the score 4 to 3. but the In
dians effectively controlled the ball
I for the rest of the contest.

ference between the two squads.
Sophomore Lloyd Dinkelspiel, a
star of the frosh team last year,
scored the Indians' two points in
the first half. Ernie Polte ran the
score to 3 to 0 in the beginning of
the third quarter with a beautiful
! 10-foot shot. Forward Don Wee

scoring Stanford's last two goals,
j Other men to see action in the
i Hornet contest were Bob Wycoff,

An inspired Stanford water polo
team, led by the Cards' ace swim
mer Ralph Sala, upset a highly rated
Southern California squad last Fri
day 4 to 3 and then, to make it a
perfect weekend, they downed Ful
lerton Junior College 5 to 3 Satur-*
day morning.
Sala, who was switched from
guard to forward only last week,
scored two beautiful goals in the
second half to sew up the Trojan
game for the once-defeated Cards.
Sala's clincher was a difficult
back - hand shot which completely
fooled the Trojan goalie. The point
put the Indians ahead 4 to 2, and
USC was never able to overcome
the lead.
The game was a rough one all the
way, with Stanford guards Captain
Ken Fox, Ernie Polte, and Hub
Stokely completely bottling up
Troy's usually high - scoring for
wards.
A particularly brilliant game was
turned in hy Fox, who held USC's
sprint ace Burns to a single goal.
FLETCHER SUPERB
Kim Fletcher, Indian goalie, also
performed remarkably in his posi
tion. He batted out many close
shots, and with the help of the Card
guards, kept the ball out of scoring
range most of the way through the
j contest.
It was forward Bob Frojan who
! gave the Indians a 2 to 1 half-time
l advantage. A 10-foot whip shot in
j the opening minutes by Frojan sent
i the Cards into the lead 1 to 0, and
I after USC had tied up the contest
; 1 to 1, he sent in* another point
i from the left-hand side late in the
second quarter.
After Sala had moved the score
up 3 to 1, to open the second half,
i Trojan veteran Ed Illsey made his
! second goal of the afternoon to
I close up the gap 3 to 2. This set the
stage for Sala's game-winning back
| hand shot.
A desperate point by the Trojans
in the waning moments of the game
| made the score 4 to 3. but the In
dians effectively controlled the ball
I for the rest of the contest.
