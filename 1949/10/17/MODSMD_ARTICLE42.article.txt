## Frosh Top UCLA, 6-0 Papooses' Record Intact at Fourteen 
### DICK KLEIN 
Coach Chuck Taylor maintained
his unbroken win streak Saturday
when his frosh charges barely
squeaked through a miserable 6-0
win over UCLA.
The victory string now stands at
14. Not a defeat since the war
stopped and freshman athletics were
resumed in the conference in 1947.
But if it's going to stand up any
longer, the Papoose tribe must pay
more attention to their mentor's
pigskin savvy.
The early moments of the game
provided the lone tally. After tSan
l'ord won the toss and elected to
kick, the Uclans were stopped cold.
The Papoose eleven then promptly
began to roll, but made their first of
a handful of bobbles deep in Btuin
territory.
BLOCKED KICK
The Westwooders failed to move
and tried a quick kick on third
down. The kick was blocked by
tackle Johnny Broderick. The
Uclans recovered. On fourth down
on their own 21, the harassed Bruins
tried another boot. Again the Card
line swarmed in, blocked the kick,
and the ball rolled into the end
zone. After a big scramble, the ball
ended up in the mitts of Norm Ma
noogian, stellar Papoose guard.
When Crist failed to kick the con
version, the six-point lead looked

I small, but it grew and grew as each
! team failed to muster an offense
• and the minutes ticked away.
Only Bruin threat came in the last
; period, when Areceneaux on a fake
pass play from the wing formation
| ran the ball from the 40 to the six.
A pass interception in the end zone
gave the Southern Branch boys the
ball on the one with a first down.
The first two downs were wasted
with line plunges for no gain, with
Manoogian and Jim Vic leading the
tacklers. Then Areeneaux was
| thrown back to the nine. On fourth
down, a well - planned Areeneaux
| pass was batted down by alert Stan
ford defenders.
Throughout the game technical
penalties continually bogged down
the Stanfords. Grounding out one
long gain after another, the Pa
pooses managed to have about one
third of their plays nullified by rule
| miscues. Primarily illegal use of the
hands errors accounted for the long
losses via the penalty route. At least
200 valuable yards were lost.
ARC'ENEAUX SHINES
As for the Brubabes, their plight
was even worse. With the excep
i lion of Whitney Areeneaux, a very
1 capable runner and fair passer, the
West wood crew lacked just about
everything. Throwing wild passes,
.12 of them altogether, all over
the Stadium turf, backs helplessly
| trying to escape Indian tacklers
were the main Bruin offensive
weapons.
The combination of Stanford pen
alties plus five Papoose fumbles,
and relatively few mistakes of their
own. kept the score down and the
game even but dull.
On the good side of the ledger,
■ the Indian line, especially the
| guards and tackles, were terrific.
Keeping the Brubabe attack thwart
ed at all times, the hard-charging
linemen opened holes that Skip
Crist, Wes Laubscher, and Loren
Hinkleman roared through nicely.
