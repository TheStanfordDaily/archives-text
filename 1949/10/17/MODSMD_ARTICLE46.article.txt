# Experts Discuss Germany
## 
### 
The military occupation of West
ern Germany has not lived up to
its potentialities in effecting a suc
cessful American administration.
This was the conclusion reached
by Dr. Fritz Epstein, Curator of the
Hoover Library's Central and East
i ern European collections, William
Marvin, special representative of the
i Library who has just returned from
[a year's visit in Germany, and Fritz
Margulies, Stanford foreign scholar
ship student from Germany. The
three experts held their discussion
J last week on the Stanford Round
| table program.
Marvin pointed out that the
American objectives are destruc

tion of war potential, denazification,
and democratization.
Dr. Epstein said denazification has
almost been completed, and it was
interesting to note that mere for
mer Nazis were retained in the
French and British zones in admin
istrative capacities than in the
American zone.
Although the three speakers were
loath to describe the former Ameri
can military occupation as a satis
factory enough picture, each seemed
to have more hope for the continu
ing period of occupation under the
civilian commission plan now in ef
fect.
