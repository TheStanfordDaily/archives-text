You can't force a man to like mu
sic, Dr. William L. Crostcn, head of
Stanford's Music Department, told
members of the Western College
Association gathered on the Uni
versity campus Saturday afternoon

"On the whole, I think that if a I
man has no taste for music, lie will
do well to let it alone," Professor
Crosten said, speaking on the topic
of developments in genera! educa
tion as applied to music courses. He
suggested two guides for a general
college music course: first, that stu- j
dents enrolled in the course have

joyment of the art.
Dean Clarence 11. Faust of the
Faculty of Humanities and Sciences
told delegates at the Association
