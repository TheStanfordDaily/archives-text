# SRI Leaders Explain Work
## 
### 
Two nationally known scientists j
who are directing work of the Stan- |
ford Research Institute will speak j
tomorrow night at. 7:30 at the Tues- j
day Evening Series.
The two scientists. Dr. J. E. Hob
son, executive director of SRI, and j
Dr. Cledo Brunetti, associate direc
tor, will speak, respectively, on the
role of the Institute in applied re
search and miniature radio equip
ment.
Both scientists have outstanding
records in research and each has j
been cited as ''The Outstanding j
Young Electrical Engineer of the ;
United States." Dr. Ilobson in 1040
and Dr. Brunetti in 1941.
Dr. Hobson was director of the ;
Armour Research Foundation of the
Illinois Institute of Technology be
fore coming to the SRI in March of
1948. While at Armour he super
vised the Foundation's development
of wire and tape sound recording.
Dr. Brunetti, one of the develop
ers of miniature radio equipment,
returned last week from Europe j
where he conducted a survey tor
the U.S. government of recent de
velopments in electronic techniques, j
During the war. Dr. Brunetti had
a leading part in the development
of the radar-guided bomb and the
radio - proximity fuse, two of the
U.S.'s major secret weapons.
He also played a major role in the
invention of the two-way wrist ra
dio and a radio transmitter which is
so small it can be slipped into a
lipstick cylinder.
Chairman for the program will be
