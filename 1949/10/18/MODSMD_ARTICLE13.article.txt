# Strains of Debussy Float From Woodpecker Lodge
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
If you hoar a familiar melody of j
Debussy around the Chappy office
one night, and you are told it is t
coming from the woodpeckers, do j
not shake your head in doubt. The !
music you arc healing is coming |
from Woodpecker Lodge, where the j
Stanford Orchestra is rehearsing.
Every Monday and Thursday j
night a group of students who arc j
very much interested in music, hut
who do not claim to be professionals i
or music majors, combine their tal- >
cnts under the direction of Sandor :
Salgo to prepare for a year of mu
sical presentations. Their first pro- j
gram, a concert with selections by |
Debussy, Haydn, and Vaughn-Wil
liams, will be held Sunday after
noon, December 4, at Memorial Au
ditorium.
LITTLE-KNOWN WORK
The most, unusual number will l)e (
"'L'Enfant Prodiguc" ('I he Prodigal
Son) by Claude Debussy, a little
known work of the composer, writ- !
ten when he was still a student. This j
was Debussy's first important work, i
which gave him the Prix de Pome ;
(an award which enabled him to j
study at Rome) and recognition as !
a composer. Auditions will be held '
for the parts of the two soloists, !

parts which are very difficult to
sing.
Two string orchestras will be used
for the presentation of R. Vaughn-
Williams' "Fantasia on a Theme of
Thomas Tallis." The string section
will be broken up into two orches
tras and a string quartet will also
he used. Williams, who is still liv
ing, is a contemporary leader of
English composers.
He was one of the first to bring
back musical fame to England after
many years of inactivity. This work,
which is one of his greatest, is a
free fantasy built on a theme of
Thomas Tallis, a composer of the
15th century.
lIAYDN SYMPHONY
Another selection will be Haydn's
Symphony No. 88 in G Minor. This
symphony, one of Haydn's 114, is
Ijcst known for its slow lyrical
movement.
The orchestra is planning to com
memorate the anniversary of Bach's
death, by devoting all of winter
quarter to the composer's works.
Spring quarter, in place of an op
era, the orchestra will present, a
festival of contemporary American
compositions in addition to a forum
of noted musical critics.
The man who will be leading all

this musical activity is Sandor Salgo,
new to Stanford as a musical direc
tor but already loved by the stu
dents as was his predecessor, Dr.
Jan Popper. Mr. Salgo, born in
Hungary, received his training in
Budapest and Berlin. He is a mem
ber of the Roth String Quartet in
addition to directing the Stanford
Orchestra.
I.NLAK(.i:i) CHAMBER UNIT
One of his main principles is that
the orchestra should be an enlarged
chamber unit, and he strongly em
phasizes the importance of playing
together as a group. Mr. Salgo, be
sides being a competent director,
charming and friendly, is especially
endeared to his students because of
his patience.
The orchestra is now composed of
about 50 students, the largest mem
bership in its history, and the most
promising according to George
Roule. general manager. There arc
some openings in Ihe string section,
while all the others arc filled.
These students and their director,
because of their splendid and in
dustrious work, are bringing musi
cal fame to Stanford besides provid
ing enjoyable music for the entire
student body. .
