## On Duty Volunteers View Home Games On Television, Drive New Firewagon 
### ART HENRY 
A new fire truck, an addition to j
the building, and a new television j
set arc among the recent improve-!
incuts at the Stanford Fire Depart- j
ment.
Designed mainly for grass and i
brush (ires, the new iruek once be- j
longed to the Stanford Physics De- J
pnrtment. It was a surplus Army ]
vehicle and was mounted with radar !
equipment.
The Fire Department took over
the truck and had its six-by-six ;
chassis fitted with a 1,000 - gallon i
tank, a 500-gallon-per-minute low- i
pressure pump, and a 60-gal!on- j
per-minute high-pressure fog pump, j
Other equipment on the vehicle j
includes a two-way radio set, 1,000 I
feet of 2Vfe-lnch hose, r»<)0 fret of 1' :- \
inch hose, I>oo feet of I-inch hose.!
and .">OO feet of high-pressure hose.
Because the new truck is much
larger than the small pumper for
merly housed in the building, a i
$1,200 ude'ition to the firchouse was
necessary on the west side. It j
houses the new truck in the front
while in the rear is a new study
room for members of the Fire De
partment.
Desks for six students and ample i
bookshelves are included in th»: !
study room. Student members of
the Fire Department formerly had
to do their studying in a more or
less haphazard manner on and
around the fire equipmnet.
Work on the addition was done by
the Corporation Yard with student
and regular firemen assisting. A
concrete vault, moved to make room
for the addition, is now in use at
the Microwave Laboratory,
Another important addition at

the Firchouse is a television set.
Because a full crew of men must be
on duty at all times, it was formerly
necessary for half the firemen to
miss the football game each week.
The members of the department
got together and all contributed to
buy a large television receiver, en
abling those on duty to see the
games.
Chief .John Marston said he hopes
to be able to add radio sets to the
two trucks now lacking that equip
ment.

and .">OO feet of high-pressure hose.
Because the new truck is much
larger than the small pumper for
merly housed in the building, a i
$1,200 ude'ition to the firchouse was
necessary on the west side. It j
houses the new truck in the front
while in the rear is a new study
room for members of the Fire De
partment.
Desks for six students and ample i
bookshelves are included in th»: !
study room. Student members of
the Fire Department formerly had
to do their studying in a more or
less haphazard manner on and
around the fire equipmnet.
Work on the addition was done by
the Corporation Yard with student
and regular firemen assisting. A
concrete vault, moved to make room
for the addition, is now in use at
the Microwave Laboratory,
Another important addition at

the Firchouse is a television set.
Because a full crew of men must be
on duty at all times, it was formerly
necessary for half the firemen to
miss the football game each week.
The members of the department
got together and all contributed to
buy a large television receiver, en
abling those on duty to see the
games.
Chief .John Marston said he hopes
to be able to add radio sets to the
two trucks now lacking that equip
ment.
