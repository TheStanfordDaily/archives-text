# Stern Stoves Cool Off As Steam Pipes Burst
## Major Leak Near 'Hard Luck Hall' Forces Return to Encina Commons 
### 
Disgruntled Stern Hall residents marched back to Encina for
their meal last night after the kitchen of the famous "Hard Luck
Hall" closed down from lack of steam, four meals after the ill
fated dining unit opened. The steam went off after breakfast as
workmen descended through manholes at the intersection of

♦Escondido and Galvcz to repair a
j major break in the steam line.
Hint of trouble came Sunday eve-
I ning when passers-by saw steam
j rising from the freshly packer earth
! of the ditch across the intersection,
but the leak was not discovered by
1 the Corporation Yard until a vio
j lent explosion was heard at (> a.m.
j yesterday.
Corporation Yard workers plan to
operate on the punctured line day
i and night in hopes of supplying
j steam to the hall within two days.
| Miss Christine Ricker, director of
1 University dining halls, said that all
| personnel and food supplies from
! the Stern kitchen were sent to the
| Commons, where Stem diners
1 feasted on a hot roast beef and
J mashed potato dinner last night—a
I banquet after a cold spaghetti lunch.
Eating club members at Encina
| joined the ranks of the disgruntled
when they were informed that their
dining room would be taken over
1 for general use again until Stern
; gets steam. Extended meal hours in
' the west line will prevail as they
; did before the Stern kitchen went
j into operation, with lunch served at
j 11:30 a.m. and dinner at 5:15 p.m.
Stern residents, aside from suffer
j ing the daily dawn and dusk hikes
J to Encina, will be vulnerable to the
j autumn chill for a few days more
j due to the lack of steam. Such a
hardship is not new to the residents,
j who have experienced a wide va
riety of inconveniences since tiny
| moved into the hall in September,
j Their kitchen, scheduled for com
! pletion last Sunday, managed to
open on time despite a damaging
I Hood in the basement when a gasket
j broke 011 a water softener.
Other difficulties arc well on their
j way to mend this week, according
! to Miss Patricia Davidson, resident
; director. Pay phones are already in,
I and the house phone and buzzer
i service will be hooked up today.
! Thursday linoleum workers start, to
I lay flooring in rooms in the two re
maining units, and all but the unit
; two lounge has linoleum. All desks
j and beds arc in. Miss Pat said, and
the rest of the furniture should ar
; rive Thursday.
The new kitchen, which served
i meals from Sunday brunch to Mon
day lunch, contains the latest equip-
I ment for preparing meals. Food
was placed in piping hot steam baths
to keep it warm while it was Ijcjng
served.
