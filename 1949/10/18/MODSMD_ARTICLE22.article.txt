# WEEKEND FLIGHT SUCCESSFUL
## Band Completes Mission; Returns from Huskyland 
### GORDON ADDISON 
With the echo of "Come Join the
Band'' still in their ears, the Stan
ford Hand in their chartered DC-4
dropped through the clouds above
the bay and glided to a halt on the
long runways of San Francisco Air
port late Sunday afternoon.
Three and a half hours before, the
musicians were loading tubas and
baggage on the plane at the Seatt.lc-
I Tacoma ' fairyland airport." For 2.")
of the 64 bandsmen who crowded
into the Western Airlines coach it
was the "cradle" trip.
Sinafc Friday night when a po
lice escort hustled the two band
buses into Seattle, the musicians
had enjoyed every moment in Husky
; land. At the banquet Friday night
j the crowd of alumni gathered in the
Athletic Club to sing and shout
with the yell leaders and the band
i which stormed up three flights of
J stairs to a drum cadence.
The morning of the game, the
i band waded through several inches
of mud to rehearse the half-time
stunts, and about noon they gath
! ered to yell foi the team as they
piled out of the bus near the dress
ing room.
Shortly before 2 p.m. the Stanford
Band started the National Anthem
and for the first time in Washing
ton's history-- at the suggestion of
i Stanford Director Julius Shuchat â€”
the crowd sang the "Star Spangled
Banner."
Any rooting that the fans at home
I heard over the radio probably came
| from the band. Only a few of the

alumni rooters knew the words to
"Stanford Forever and the Scalp
Song"; a few more could sing ''Come
loin the Band"; and most of them
remembered the words "Where the
Rol'ing Foothills Rise . . .'
The Stanford fans had two visi
tors during the course of the game.
One was a huge Husky dog, which
two equally huge Washington "zoo
keepers" led around with a rope.
The other attraction was the drum
majorette of the Washington band
known to everyone as "Gloria.' She
was the reason no one could tell
what formations the Husky band
was attempting during the half
time intermission.
After the 10 to 0 victory the band
climbed into two buses for the
Olympic Hotel, this time without a
police escort. One of the sidelights
of the trip which proved of interest
to the Indian band was the com
plicated Washington liquor law. The
bottle club was an unknown term
until the Seattle excursion.
The stay on the beautiful tree
covered Washington campus wasn't
the only thrill of the trip which the
student body helped finance. The
air trip with the sensations of emp
tiness as the plane dropped eleva
tion. the siuht of snow-covered Mt.
Rainier shining above the flulTy cu
mulus clouds, the panorama of the
b'ue Pugct. Sound stretching to the
north and the winding Columbia
River to the cast all arc imprinted
in the memories of the passengers.
Even Air Hostess Kuthy Baker.

who "enjoyed the trip more 'Ivhm
any other," won't be forgotten. "The
songs the fellows sang to nio were
very cute," the 22-year-old Wash
ington graduate said after seven
hours in the same plane with the
Stanford Band. There were three
other girls on the plane besides the
cute blonde hostess. All that and
the high altitude too.
