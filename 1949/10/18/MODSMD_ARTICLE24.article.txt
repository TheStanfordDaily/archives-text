# It's Your Decision
## 
### 
You, (lie Stanford student body, made an
important decision last week. You decided
that the Honor Code is working well and that
it cannot be strengthened by any regulation
arising out of a reinterpretation of the Code.
The Honor Code Standing Committee felt
that the Code could be strengthened in this
way. They suggested that the greatest strain
on the Honor Code is at the point where sec
ond and third-person responsibility ends
. , . . when an exam is taken out of the exam
ination room.
The Committee does not believe the Code is
weak at this point because of a lack of per
sonal honor, although most of the violations
reported do involve exams taken out of the
frxam room. Only a very small percentage of
those who take exams out will abuse the priv
ilege.
The weakness lies largely in the rumors
which sometimes result when six or seven
men take their exams to their fraternity house,
two or three leave the room together and go
to a room in Encina, another gets in his car and
drives .away with his exam. The rumors are
seldom based on fact, but the Committee is
of the opinion that some students become con
vinced that cheating took place and their faith
in the Honor Code is thus weakened.
The Committee suggested that this weak
link could be removed by a reinterpretation
of the Honor Code which would provide that
"if adequate seating is provided in the exam
ination room, exams will be taken out of the
room only with the permission of the instruc
tor."
Healizing that the success of any such
change in the Honor Code would rest upon
your wholehearted support, the Committee
sought the opinions of student leaders and
representatives of the University. An open
discussion was held and all of you were in
vited. Many came to express their ideas.
Excom reviewed the question and you were
represented there.
When the conclusions were drawn, it was
obvious that you feel that the Honor Code is
v/orking and that any change would represent

a step backwards. The proposed reinterpreta
tion was dropped.
You said, and we agree, that the suggested
reinterpretation would take the honor out of
the Honor Code .... that the Code should
remain a working ideal based on trust rather
than rules and regulations. This concept is the
very core of the Code.
But is the Honor Code working as well as
possible? Students do occasionally cheat on
exams, and not all aie reported. Every viola
tion is one too many.
If the Honor Code cannot be strengthened
from without by putting limitations on the trust
involved it can be strengthened from within
by your support.
First-person responsibility, to conduct your
self honorably in academic work, is the foun
dation of the Honor Code, but you have an
additional responsibility .... to encourage
otheis to do so. Students have been suspended
from the University because their fellow stu
dents failed to observe the pencil-tapping tra
dition.
If you should observe what seems to be
cheating in an exam, tap your pencil as a
warning. If the warning is heeded, you have
perhaps given a student a chance to think it
over, remember the Honor Code, and avoid a
hasty decision which he would later regret.
There has been no noticeable increase in
the number of Honor Code violations, but the
Code Committee's proposal has served to focus
attention once more on the fact that the system
can be improved.
The Honor Code stands for mutual trust
among students and between students and
faculty. That trust should not suffer when a
student takes his examination from the exam
room to a place where the tension is not so
great, where he may relax and do his best
work.
It is your decision, and we believe a wise
one, to keep the Honor Code a system based
on trust. And with this decision you have re
affirmed your faith in the Code and your re
sponsibility to keep it Stanford finest tradi
tion. — J L.

representatives of the University. An open
discussion was held and all of you were in
vited. Many came to express their ideas.
Excom reviewed the question and you were
represented there.
When the conclusions were drawn, it was
obvious that you feel that the Honor Code is
v/orking and that any change would represent

a step backwards. The proposed reinterpreta
tion was dropped.
You said, and we agree, that the suggested
reinterpretation would take the honor out of
the Honor Code .... that the Code should
remain a working ideal based on trust rather
than rules and regulations. This concept is the
very core of the Code.
But is the Honor Code working as well as
possible? Students do occasionally cheat on
exams, and not all aie reported. Every viola
tion is one too many.
If the Honor Code cannot be strengthened
from without by putting limitations on the trust
involved it can be strengthened from within
by your support.
First-person responsibility, to conduct your
self honorably in academic work, is the foun
dation of the Honor Code, but you have an
additional responsibility .... to encourage
otheis to do so. Students have been suspended
from the University because their fellow stu
dents failed to observe the pencil-tapping tra
dition.
If you should observe what seems to be
cheating in an exam, tap your pencil as a
warning. If the warning is heeded, you have
perhaps given a student a chance to think it
over, remember the Honor Code, and avoid a
hasty decision which he would later regret.
There has been no noticeable increase in
the number of Honor Code violations, but the
Code Committee's proposal has served to focus
attention once more on the fact that the system
can be improved.
The Honor Code stands for mutual trust
among students and between students and
faculty. That trust should not suffer when a
student takes his examination from the exam
room to a place where the tension is not so
great, where he may relax and do his best
work.
It is your decision, and we believe a wise
one, to keep the Honor Code a system based
on trust. And with this decision you have re
affirmed your faith in the Code and your re
sponsibility to keep it Stanford finest tradi
tion. — J L.
You, (lie Stanford student body, made an
important decision last week. You decided
that the Honor Code is working well and that
it cannot be strengthened by any regulation
arising out of a reinterpretation of the Code.
The Honor Code Standing Committee felt
that the Code could be strengthened in this
way. They suggested that the greatest strain
on the Honor Code is at the point where sec
ond and third-person responsibility ends
. , . . when an exam is taken out of the exam
ination room.
The Committee does not believe the Code is
weak at this point because of a lack of per
sonal honor, although most of the violations
reported do involve exams taken out of the
frxam room. Only a very small percentage of
those who take exams out will abuse the priv
ilege.
The weakness lies largely in the rumors
which sometimes result when six or seven
men take their exams to their fraternity house,
two or three leave the room together and go
to a room in Encina, another gets in his car and
drives .away with his exam. The rumors are
seldom based on fact, but the Committee is
of the opinion that some students become con
vinced that cheating took place and their faith
in the Honor Code is thus weakened.
The Committee suggested that this weak
link could be removed by a reinterpretation
of the Honor Code which would provide that
"if adequate seating is provided in the exam
ination room, exams will be taken out of the
room only with the permission of the instruc
tor."
Healizing that the success of any such
change in the Honor Code would rest upon
your wholehearted support, the Committee
sought the opinions of student leaders and
representatives of the University. An open
