# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
I'm sorry about being absent yesterday, and the
only thing I've got to say is—whatta weekend.
Being quite an athletic supporter, I got all excited
over having a championship fight, a Cal-TJSC foot-

ball game, and a '49er-Buffalo
l oot boll game thrown at me all
in one hunk.
The only trouble with the
whole thing was that somebody
made a mistake in telling me to
get my life savings down on El
Troje.
"Yeah, the Trojans are a shoo
in," lie said. "Naw, the Bears are
through," he said. "Hah, get the
ball foi Charlie, that's a laugh."
he said.

By six o'clock Saturday night I was penniless.
Charlie had the ball, JefT Cravath had the bill,
and 1 hud the bum—quietly beating his brains out.
But. don't worry, I've got something in the 7th
at Bay Meadows today that will even the count.

Horselovers, this is the kind of tip you dream
about. This nag will pay off like the Washington
Alums hunting for a new coach.
Rain or shine, this hayburner is ready to move, j
He's sharp like a Pal razor blade (I'll take my CUT
now, please). And he's got class.
Personally, I hope it rains because he goes best in j
the slop, and besides, a boy's best friend is his mud- :
der.
Happily, I tell you this is bis spot. The name of this :
Easy Monty i'- Mad Moment, but he's stepping so
far down in class they're calling him Dunce.
Mad Moment has been held buck like a cough in
church. But now his owner has given the word, and
it comes straight from the horse's mouth.
At the gate, Mad Moment will be 2U to 1, so get
your potatoes on this pony.
We'll both be on Easy Street. We can't miss.
Mad Moment is i. sure tiling. He has been given j
; n ultimatum. If lie loses, he won't be able to go j
home and face fodder.
Anyway, see you at the track.
