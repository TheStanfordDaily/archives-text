I wish to express my gratitude to the student body

Our first Carnival was even more of a success
than we had hoped for. The enthusiasm, co-opera- !

groping effort a gratifying one. We are of course j
pleased that we raised enough money for our schol
arship, but even more pleased with the manner in ;
which the entire How pitched in to make the "Big J

Thank you all students, administration, faculty,
