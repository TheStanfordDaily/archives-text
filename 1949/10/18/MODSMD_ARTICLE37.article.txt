Where do we go from here?
Injury-ridden California leads the PCC race for the Roses via 16 to 10
win over the favored USC Trojans. UCLA lost, to the surprise of but a
few of the Card gridders, to Santa Clara and may well lose to WSC up in
the Northland this week.
Oregon meets USC in Los Angeles this week. The loser of that tilt
con be counted out of the running. Both have lost a Conference game
and both can be expected to drop one more . . . . il Stanlord comes
through in the case of USC.
The way it looks from this corner, the Rose Bowl team may not be
decided until the afternoon of November 19, the day of the Big Game.
Undefeated Cal meets UCLA. WSC, Oregon, and Stanford in that order.
I can't understand what is keeping the Bears up there unless it is an
overabundance of spirit and a good line (plus more than a little luck). i
But the fact remains that Cal is the team to beat. Only Oregon and Stan
ford can be expected to give the Bears any trouble.
USC has yet to meet Oregon, Washington, Stanford, and UCLA. The
Trojans should have iitle trouble with the Huskies and Bruins. Again the
question mark hangs over a Stanford game. *
All of which brings us to the subject of Ciis article: Stanford and its
chances for the Rose Bowl.
I think the Cards can and will do it. Beat USC and Cal, that is. It is ;
taken for granted that they will beat OSC and Idaho. They meet a tough
Santa Clara outfit on the way but a loss there won't hurt too much . . . . j
if they win the other four games.
I base this Rose Bowl talk without having seen either Cal or USC play
this year. But I've seen the Cards in every game, including Saturday's
run-away.
Let's not fool ourselves by saying that the Indians are the best team in j
the Conference. They aren't. They are weak at guards and tackles. One \
o* - two more injuries in these departments could knock them out of the j
race. A weakened Washington team pushed 54 yards to the Card 1, when
Russ Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wcs Poulson were watching the game
from the bench. It was only bad luck on the part of Washington that
they did not score at that point. The Card line was pushed backward for
all of those 54 yards. The Huskies drew on offside penalty on the one
yard line that hurt. They had earned a TD.
But the will to win is there. It has been there but it got lost in the j
UCLA game. The Stanfords have the making of a winner. Marchie has
more backs than he can use. Second-stringers outplay the starters a
kood deal of the time. Guys like Rupe Andrews and Bill DeYoung come
up with great yards-per-carry averages, and they earn them. But then a !
fellow like Boyd Benson will come through with a great game and
Schwartz doesn't know who to start next week.
But it is the Card line that will take the team wherever it is going, j
It performs from great to poor. Last Saturday it was only mediocre. The j
Huskies gained 3.8 yards per rushing play. Only great play by Jim
Castagnoli, Dave Field, and Ken Peck kept the average that low.
A final word to those who have asked. After all is said and done |
.... the Cards did look good in Seattle. They caused the Washington
team to fumble and make had plays while they themselves were going
to town. But there isn't 40 points difference between the two teams.
Washington marched well, hut the pass interceptions hurt.
Below are some notes I jotted down during the game:
The Washington rooters really went to town before the game. They sang I
school song's for a good 45 minutes before the game started. They cheered j
a mutt dog that appeared on the field. He ran the length of the field and
finally crossed over the Stanford goal line. It later turned out that he
was the only Husky to do so that day.
The Stanford band was great. They marched very well before the game i
and their stunts during halftime set the Husky rooters to laughter. They I
formed a big umbrella and played "Stormy Weather." Then, as if to J
please the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, they formed a big sun with six :
rays and played "Blue Skies."
And it was with a warm feeling that we heard the strains of "Come
Join the Band" on Friday night. The music could be heard in the plush
lobby of the Olympic Hotel as the band marched down Fourth Avenue j
on its way to the Alumni meeting.

I After the game, the band marched
\ through the lobby of the hotel in a
tight formation to the alumni party
I that was being held there.
Dean Borba and assistants were
more than a little all right also.
Borba took complete charge of the
estimated 1.200 Card rooters and
alumni and had them singing and
cheering as if they were back on the 1
j Farm. Many favorable cormments j
i were heard both'on the band and
Borba.
Boyd Benson was the best back
on the field, offensively. Dave Field
broke the Husky's back with two
j beautiful interceptions, and Ken
Peck was great as a defensive back.
| Both deserve much credit
Emery Mitchell got off a 63-yard
quick kick on the second Stafford
! play of the game.
Bud Klein made the nicest run
of the game for his first touchdown.
Three men had their hands on him
but he danced away for the scorc.
.... Eill DeYoung had a good clay,
8 yards per carry. , Washington
i played over half the game with
only one of the four regular backs.
The loss of Jack Seth hurt.

lobby of the Olympic Hotel as the band marched down Fourth Avenue j
on its way to the Alumni meeting.

I After the game, the band marched
\ through the lobby of the hotel in a
tight formation to the alumni party
I that was being held there.
Dean Borba and assistants were
more than a little all right also.
Borba took complete charge of the
estimated 1.200 Card rooters and
alumni and had them singing and
cheering as if they were back on the 1
j Farm. Many favorable cormments j
i were heard both'on the band and
Borba.
Boyd Benson was the best back
on the field, offensively. Dave Field
broke the Husky's back with two
j beautiful interceptions, and Ken
Peck was great as a defensive back.
| Both deserve much credit
Emery Mitchell got off a 63-yard
quick kick on the second Stafford
! play of the game.
Bud Klein made the nicest run
of the game for his first touchdown.
Three men had their hands on him
but he danced away for the scorc.
.... Eill DeYoung had a good clay,
8 yards per carry. , Washington
i played over half the game with
only one of the four regular backs.
The loss of Jack Seth hurt.

Where do we go from here?
Injury-ridden California leads the PCC race for the Roses via 16 to 10
win over the favored USC Trojans. UCLA lost, to the surprise of but a
few of the Card gridders, to Santa Clara and may well lose to WSC up in
the Northland this week.
Oregon meets USC in Los Angeles this week. The loser of that tilt
con be counted out of the running. Both have lost a Conference game
and both can be expected to drop one more . . . . il Stanlord comes
through in the case of USC.
The way it looks from this corner, the Rose Bowl team may not be
decided until the afternoon of November 19, the day of the Big Game.
Undefeated Cal meets UCLA. WSC, Oregon, and Stanford in that order.
I can't understand what is keeping the Bears up there unless it is an
overabundance of spirit and a good line (plus more than a little luck). i
But the fact remains that Cal is the team to beat. Only Oregon and Stan
ford can be expected to give the Bears any trouble.
USC has yet to meet Oregon, Washington, Stanford, and UCLA. The
Trojans should have iitle trouble with the Huskies and Bruins. Again the
question mark hangs over a Stanford game. *
All of which brings us to the subject of Ciis article: Stanford and its
chances for the Rose Bowl.
I think the Cards can and will do it. Beat USC and Cal, that is. It is ;
taken for granted that they will beat OSC and Idaho. They meet a tough
Santa Clara outfit on the way but a loss there won't hurt too much . . . . j
if they win the other four games.
I base this Rose Bowl talk without having seen either Cal or USC play
this year. But I've seen the Cards in every game, including Saturday's
run-away.
Let's not fool ourselves by saying that the Indians are the best team in j
the Conference. They aren't. They are weak at guards and tackles. One \
o* - two more injuries in these departments could knock them out of the j
race. A weakened Washington team pushed 54 yards to the Card 1, when
Russ Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wcs Poulson were watching the game
from the bench. It was only bad luck on the part of Washington that
they did not score at that point. The Card line was pushed backward for
all of those 54 yards. The Huskies drew on offside penalty on the one
yard line that hurt. They had earned a TD.
But the will to win is there. It has been there but it got lost in the j
UCLA game. The Stanfords have the making of a winner. Marchie has
more backs than he can use. Second-stringers outplay the starters a
kood deal of the time. Guys like Rupe Andrews and Bill DeYoung come
up with great yards-per-carry averages, and they earn them. But then a !
fellow like Boyd Benson will come through with a great game and
Schwartz doesn't know who to start next week.
But it is the Card line that will take the team wherever it is going, j
It performs from great to poor. Last Saturday it was only mediocre. The j
Huskies gained 3.8 yards per rushing play. Only great play by Jim
Castagnoli, Dave Field, and Ken Peck kept the average that low.
A final word to those who have asked. After all is said and done |
.... the Cards did look good in Seattle. They caused the Washington
team to fumble and make had plays while they themselves were going
to town. But there isn't 40 points difference between the two teams.
Washington marched well, hut the pass interceptions hurt.
Below are some notes I jotted down during the game:
The Washington rooters really went to town before the game. They sang I
school song's for a good 45 minutes before the game started. They cheered j
a mutt dog that appeared on the field. He ran the length of the field and
finally crossed over the Stanford goal line. It later turned out that he
was the only Husky to do so that day.
The Stanford band was great. They marched very well before the game i
and their stunts during halftime set the Husky rooters to laughter. They I
formed a big umbrella and played "Stormy Weather." Then, as if to J
please the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, they formed a big sun with six :
rays and played "Blue Skies."

Huskies gained 3.8 yards per rushing play. Only great play by Jim
Castagnoli, Dave Field, and Ken Peck kept the average that low.
A final word to those who have asked. After all is said and done |
.... the Cards did look good in Seattle. They caused the Washington
team to fumble and make had plays while they themselves were going
to town. But there isn't 40 points difference between the two teams.
Washington marched well, hut the pass interceptions hurt.
Below are some notes I jotted down during the game:
The Washington rooters really went to town before the game. They sang I
school song's for a good 45 minutes before the game started. They cheered j
a mutt dog that appeared on the field. He ran the length of the field and
finally crossed over the Stanford goal line. It later turned out that he
was the only Husky to do so that day.
The Stanford band was great. They marched very well before the game i
and their stunts during halftime set the Husky rooters to laughter. They I
formed a big umbrella and played "Stormy Weather." Then, as if to J
please the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, they formed a big sun with six :
rays and played "Blue Skies."
And it was with a warm feeling that we heard the strains of "Come
Join the Band" on Friday night. The music could be heard in the plush
lobby of the Olympic Hotel as the band marched down Fourth Avenue j
on its way to the Alumni meeting.

I After the game, the band marched
\ through the lobby of the hotel in a
tight formation to the alumni party
I that was being held there.
Dean Borba and assistants were
more than a little all right also.
Borba took complete charge of the
estimated 1.200 Card rooters and
alumni and had them singing and
cheering as if they were back on the 1
j Farm. Many favorable cormments j
i were heard both'on the band and
Borba.
Boyd Benson was the best back
on the field, offensively. Dave Field
broke the Husky's back with two
j beautiful interceptions, and Ken
Peck was great as a defensive back.
| Both deserve much credit
Emery Mitchell got off a 63-yard
quick kick on the second Stafford
! play of the game.
Bud Klein made the nicest run
of the game for his first touchdown.
Three men had their hands on him
but he danced away for the scorc.
.... Eill DeYoung had a good clay,
8 yards per carry. , Washington
i played over half the game with
only one of the four regular backs.
The loss of Jack Seth hurt.

Where do we go from here?
Injury-ridden California leads the PCC race for the Roses via 16 to 10
win over the favored USC Trojans. UCLA lost, to the surprise of but a
few of the Card gridders, to Santa Clara and may well lose to WSC up in
the Northland this week.
Oregon meets USC in Los Angeles this week. The loser of that tilt
con be counted out of the running. Both have lost a Conference game
and both can be expected to drop one more . . . . il Stanlord comes
through in the case of USC.
The way it looks from this corner, the Rose Bowl team may not be
decided until the afternoon of November 19, the day of the Big Game.
Undefeated Cal meets UCLA. WSC, Oregon, and Stanford in that order.
I can't understand what is keeping the Bears up there unless it is an
overabundance of spirit and a good line (plus more than a little luck). i
But the fact remains that Cal is the team to beat. Only Oregon and Stan
ford can be expected to give the Bears any trouble.
USC has yet to meet Oregon, Washington, Stanford, and UCLA. The
Trojans should have iitle trouble with the Huskies and Bruins. Again the
question mark hangs over a Stanford game. *
All of which brings us to the subject of Ciis article: Stanford and its
chances for the Rose Bowl.
I think the Cards can and will do it. Beat USC and Cal, that is. It is ;
taken for granted that they will beat OSC and Idaho. They meet a tough
Santa Clara outfit on the way but a loss there won't hurt too much . . . . j
if they win the other four games.
I base this Rose Bowl talk without having seen either Cal or USC play
this year. But I've seen the Cards in every game, including Saturday's
run-away.
Let's not fool ourselves by saying that the Indians are the best team in j
the Conference. They aren't. They are weak at guards and tackles. One \
o* - two more injuries in these departments could knock them out of the j
race. A weakened Washington team pushed 54 yards to the Card 1, when
Russ Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wcs Poulson were watching the game
from the bench. It was only bad luck on the part of Washington that
they did not score at that point. The Card line was pushed backward for
all of those 54 yards. The Huskies drew on offside penalty on the one
yard line that hurt. They had earned a TD.
But the will to win is there. It has been there but it got lost in the j
UCLA game. The Stanfords have the making of a winner. Marchie has
more backs than he can use. Second-stringers outplay the starters a
kood deal of the time. Guys like Rupe Andrews and Bill DeYoung come
up with great yards-per-carry averages, and they earn them. But then a !
fellow like Boyd Benson will come through with a great game and
Schwartz doesn't know who to start next week.
