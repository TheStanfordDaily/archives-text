# Heavers' Potential Rated Strong, Despite Record
## Coach Taylor's Single Wing Attack Sparked by 24 Returning Lettermen 
### 
By 808 BKRNSTEIN
Coach Marchmont Schwartz's Red
Machine, now seemingly shifted into
high gear on its travels down the
Rose Bowl load, will do well to
heed the orange light awaiting them
- at this Saturday's intersection.
At first glance, LaVerne (Kip)
Taylor's Orange Beavers, from Ore
j gftn State College would seem to
■ present slight reason for caution.
The Beavers, for instance, booted
one to Cal by 41 to 0. UCLA blasted
them 35 to 13. Washington's eight
balled Huskies comp'etely outplayed
them even though the Taylormen
squeaked past by 7 to 3.
And the Staters' only bona-fide
victories of the year were at the
expense of Utah and Montana, nei
ther of which has yet been men
tioned as a logical contender for the
national title.
Nevertheless, quell that urge to
shout "breather" in connection with
the forthcoming Stadium battle.
SIMILAR TO BRUINS
Consider first the resemblance be
tween the Beavers' 1949 plight and
that of UCLA's Indian - scalping
Bruins. Oregon State, like UCLA,
has a brand-new coaching stall this
year.
Again like the Bruins, they have
a nearly all-veteran squad which in
1948 showed latent power which
was smothered for the better part
of the year under a blanket of in
ternal dissension.
Further, the Orangemen run their
plays from the same single wing
used by Red Sanders at the south
ern stronghold.
Once you've digested Ihose facts,
recall also that the dope sheet luts
proven itself definitely dopey in
Coast grid predictions all year.
But aside from such purely the
oretical reasoning, the Beavers cer
tainly have the manpower to pro
vide Stanford with a very rough af
ternoon indeed.
"24 LETTERMEN RETURN
Taylor inherited 24 letternien
from the now-departed Lon Stiner,
including no fewer than 12 squad
members who have already won
three varsity letters.
Outstanding member of this trip
le-monogrammed group is halfback
Ken Carpenter, a triple - threater
who specializes in broken field run
ning. Against Montana last week,
for example, Ken returned one
Grizzly punt for 67 yards and a
touchdown.
The Oregonians' other top offen
sive threat is Carpenter's runn'WVg
mate, soph Bill Shoffo'd. Sheffold
also had a fine day during the 6:» to
14 mangling of Montana, even man
aging to top Carpenter's 67 - yard
sprint with a 77-yard punt return
of his own.
The back field power is provided
by fullback Dick T wenge, who is
currently enjoying his fourth year
of line busting for the Corvallis
crew.
Up front, the Beavers' mainstays
are Tom De Sylvia at guard and

Arvid Niemi at tackle. Do Sylvia is
a 207-pound speedster, while Niemi
is (he anchor of the forward wall at
223 pounds.
CARPENTER SERIOUS THREAT
The Montana battle made clear
the fact that Taylor's offense does
not depend too heavily on any one
individual, even though Carpenter
is the most serious threat. Of the
nine touchdowns scored by the Or
ange that afternoon, only Carpenter
accounted for more than one.
The twisting scat - back scored
two. but the other seven were di
vided evenly among five other backs
and a pair of ends who tallied on
tosses by Carpenter and sub lull
back Andy Knudsen.
And incidentally, when the Stat
ers do score a touchdown, they're
pretty sure of that extra point. Stan
McGuire, who is listed as a right
end but rarely gets off the bench
except to boot the extras, sailed all
nine of his kicks through the posts
last Saturday.
