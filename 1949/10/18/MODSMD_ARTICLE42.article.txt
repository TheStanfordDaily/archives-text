# Injuries Hit Card Squad
## 
### 
The Washington victory has
turned out to be even more costly
than hitherto believed. The Cards
! turned out for yesterday's practice
| to find themselves short many more
| men than the four "knees."
j In addition to Russ Pomeroy. Dick
j Abraham, YVes Poulson. and A 1
Laakso, all of whom are out with
I knee injuries, Coach Schwartz
! missed Rupc Andrews, sprained
back; Dave Field, same injury; Bill
DeYoung, slight knee injury; and
! Holy Boruck, cold.
The extent to which Pomeroy,
j Abraham, Poulson. and Laakso are
injured is not yet known. Knee in
juries are always hard to measure
and it will not be until later in the
week that the coaching staff will
know who will and who will not
play Saturday.
All four men are important cogs
in the Red Machine. Pomeroy has
turned into a first-class line-backer
and has been groomed for tackle
| duties. Abraham is the third of the
t trio of "Cass, Abe and Russ, Line-
J backers Inc."
Poulson is an important tackle re
-1 serve. Laakso is Laakso and that
: says enough. His play Saturday, af
| ter being injured for two weeks,
was top flight. He may be available
j Saturday. His injury is the slight
j est of the four.
Schwartz indicated yesterday that
he has no false ideas about Oregon
; State being weak. He scrimmaged
! the second- and third-string varsity
, against the jayvees. Of all the left
j halfbacks, only Dick Broome was
available for duty yesterday. The
j rest are out with some type injury
|or another. Colds have also taken
j their toll.
Co - captain 'Jim Castagnoli was
I given the lineman of the week
! award for his work in Saturday's
i game. Jesse Cone received the same
| honor for his part of the UCLA
| Stanford contest.
