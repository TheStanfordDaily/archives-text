A little fellow selling rooters' cups
at the Stanford-Washington game
was having no luck. The Huskies
had lost three games in a row and

ignored him. He pulled his coat
closer to protect himself from the
winds blowing off Lake Washington
and looked at the sky.
Then with an impish grin, he
started to hawk his wares again only
now it was with the cry, "Get your
rooters' caps here. It isn't the spirit
you know, it's the seagulls."'
