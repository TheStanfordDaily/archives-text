WASHINGTON â€” Gen. Clifton B.
C'atcs, chief of the U.S. Marines, ac
cused the Army general staff today
of seeking to whittle down his fa
mous foa-to-shore assault corps into
a mere "police force."
The Army, he said, has already
grabbed all the money for amphibi
ous training so that the Marines will
not even be able to practice their
shore-storming specialty this year.
