# AFL Spurns Lewis
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€” The AFL high
command said today that John L.
Lewis' plan for a $2.500,000-a-week
war chest to finance the great steel
strike is "impossible and impracti
cable" while union labor is split
into rival camps.
AFL President William Green
called instead for a real merger of
AFL, CIO. and the United Mine
Workers to mobilise their economic
power.
Lewis had proposed that nine big
AFL unions and his own UMW con
tribute $230,000 a week each to help
win the steel strike being led by
CIO President Philip Murray.
