# TUESDAY SERIES
## Lilliputian Radio, SRI Made Clear 
### 
Dr. Cledo Bruneiti palmed a radio
transmitter the size of a cigarette
cflse, walked 15 feet from a standard
portable receiver on the stage, and
in a low voice broadcast an expla
nation of the 5-tubc transmitting set
he was using. His voice was clearly
audible to spectators at the rear of
Memorial Auditorium as well as the
rest of the audience of 400 which
attended last night's Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture.
Then, in succession, Dr. Brunetti
pulled from his coat pocket a trans
mitter imbedded in a plastic rect
angle the size of a penny matchbox,
a second one in a lipstick tube, a
3-tube set the size of a postage
stamp, and finally, a radio one-fifth
the size of a dime.
While industry has not yet made
use of the smaller of these Lillipu
tion models, their future application
to everyday life Ls within reason, Dr.
Brunetti said.
Dr. Brunetti, associate director of
the Stanford Research Institute, ex
hibited his inventions following a
description of Stanford's "cousin,"
the SRI, by Dr. J. E. Hobson, execu
tive director of the Institute. Fred
erick O. Glover, director of infor
mation, introduced the scientists.
Dr. Hobson explained the place of
the non-profit institute in relation
to the University. The institute was
developed in November 1946, and
opened in the spring of 1947 as a
public service to the government and
industry. SRI, employing a staff of
more than 260, works on research
jobs sponsored by industry, most of
it on the West Coast, and govern
ment agencies.
