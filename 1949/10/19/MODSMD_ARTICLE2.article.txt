WASHINGTON â€” Air Secretary
Symington today roundly de
nounced Navy critics who have
called the B-3G bomher a "billion
dollar blunder" and said they have
exposed some of this country's top
military secrets.
Testifying before the House
Armed Services Committee, Sy
mington urged a greater U.S. air
fleet to counter .Russia's possession
of the atomic bomb.
The Navy contends that its power
to carry the fight to a distant enemy
is being ruined under the unified
defense setup. The Navy claims
that its carriers such, as those sent
for the historic Doolittle bombing
onslaught against Tokyo, should
again play a major role in any fu
ture conflict. But the B-36 bomber,
Symington said, is "the surest way
to deliver the atomic bomb or any
other type of bomb, against any ag
gressor, and from our own shores."
