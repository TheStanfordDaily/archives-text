# REDS PUSH TOWARD ISLAND
## Whole World Trembles, Hong Kong Placid

Canton has fallen. The Chinese
i Communists are poised on the
boundaries of that tight little British
! colony of Hong Kong. The whole
world awaits the fate of the colony,
j The world is fearful that the Com
j munists wi'l attack Ilonu Kong- the
j whole world, that is. except the two
! million inhabitants of Hong Kong.
While the whole world trembled
| on our behalf, we in Hong Kong
| were wondering whether we should
j really be as seared as the rest of
; the world thinks we should be. The
top brass in England lias been send
ing troops and p'anes to Hong Kong
in the past few months. These 1
consider to be nothing more than a
' token force. If the Communists
j really want Hong Kong, they won't
have much trouble taking it. The
I Japanese did it with case in 1941.
1 However. I don't think the Comnui-
J nists will risk creating an interna
! tional situation at present by openly
attacking the colony.
They may, however, try to cause
internal troubles by the use of sub
versivc element That aspect of the
i situation has not escaped the atten
j lion of the Hong Kong government,
j and it has resulted in the formation
i of a special constabulary.
Meanwhile, the roar of the traf
t lie, the panting of the coolics, and
the smells of the waterfront, which

go to make up Hong Kong, will con
tinue to be. There will be the same
jostling crowds in the streets, peo
ple will still stop work at four for
their cups of afternoon tea, milling
multitudes will still foregather at
the scenic Repulse Bay each week
end. and the local blucbloods will
si ill jealously guard their exclusive
retreats on the summit of Victoria
Peak, for such is the apathetic, un
changing Orient.
The Communist occupation of
Canton has disrupted rail and liver
traffic between the two cities for the
time being. As 1 sec it, the only
people who will be seriously affected
will be tlie smugglers, river pirates,
and train bandits. They will un
doubtedly have to call an off sea
son. However, in a letter which he
sent to me just before the fall of
Canton, the Rt. Rev. N. V. Hal ward,
assistant bishop of the Diocese of
Hong Kong and South China, stated
that Canton will have a difficult
time, but it would not be long be
fore communications will be re
stored between the two cities.
I have also been asked quite often
what the Communists arc like.
I'rankly, I don't know. I have in
terviewed numerous people who
have alleged y been to the Commu
nist areas, and if they are all to be
believed, then the Communist gov
ernment of China is the most en
couraging. the most discouraging,
the most efficient. and the most dis
astrous government China has ever
had
