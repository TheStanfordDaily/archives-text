# The
						Critical Year
## 
### 
Excom members last week heard reports
from several of the delegates who represented
Stanford at the Second Annual National Stu
dent Congress held on the campus of the Uni
versity of Illinois this summer.
Tonight Excom will review the decision of
last year's Executive Committee to continue
ASSU affiliation with the National Student
Association.
An affirmative vote would commit the
ASSU to an appropriation of $331 for national
and regional annual dues. It would also en
tail underwriting the expenses of delegates
who would attend several regional assem
blies this year.
These appropriations should be made. The
chief expense of belonging to NSA, namely
the sending of delegates to the national con
gress, has already been incurred for this year.
Jt would be unwise for the ASSU to pull out
of the organization at this time.
But the issue, as we see it, is whether or not
the Stanford student body should continue its
membership in NSA after this year. Excom
members should begin thinking along these
lines if they are not doing so already. They
are the ones v/ho must decide come spring
quarter.
It follows, then, that this is a critical year
for NSA at Stanford. Whether we belong next
year or not should be determined largely by
what NSA is able to do for Stanford students
this year.
The National Students Association is a
group of some 800,000 college students banded
together through their 250 different schools to
promote such worthy ideals as academic free
dom and student rights, improved democratic
student government, international understand
ing and fellowship, and the guarantee of equal
rights in education to all regardless of sex.
race, religion, political belief or economic cir
cumstance. Stanford is able to be a part of
this program through its membership and its
dues.
NSA, on the other hand, should do some
thing for Stanford. To date it has not. We

derived practically no visible good from our
affiliation with the National Students Asso
ciation last year.
Paitially this is our fault, and partially it is
because NSA does not so well serve campuses
which have as much student freedom and
government as ours does.
The function of NSA on campus is to stimu
late consideration of national student policy,
to carry out such a national program as i3
relevant to the particular campus, and to make
available to all existing student organizaiions
the resources of the national association,
Last year NSA at Stanford fell down on all
three counts. After a beginning outburst of
enthusiasm the committee charged to do the
work fell apart and was never heard from
again.
To prevent the reoccurrence of such a hap
pening, a single NSA co-ordinator has been
appointed this year. This person will channel
NSA information and projects to existing or
ganizations or recommend the setting up of
new committees to study projects if suitable
ones do not exist.
Committees to study faculty-rating systems
and student employment are presently being
organized. Others will follow.
The second difficulty has been that the Stan
ford community is not well suited for the suc
cessful operation of NSA.
Backbone of NSA's campus program is the
Purchase Card System, but this project is not
feasible at Stanford because of the limited
number of merchants in the Palo Alto area. It
is better adapted to schools located in larger
cities where the system could be counted on
to bring additional student business to sub
scribing merchants.
Possibilities of aid in establishing different
phases of student government, another of
NSA's most important campus functions, are
also limited at Stanford.
Nevertheless, the delegates who attended
the national congress feel that NSA could still
be an important part of student life on the
Farm.
Either way, this is the critical year.
