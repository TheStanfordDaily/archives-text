### JOHN BODINAR 
Let's give Big Six for Rally Com. Being an en
thusiastic rooter in the true Stanford spirit, I felt
that I should do something for the team. I bow hum
bly when I pass the training quarters and cheer
wildly when the television camera is turned on me.
Somehow I felt this wasn't enough, so I went over
to join Rcijly Com, pom-pon in hand.
The office was a hustle of activity as I walked in.
Along the right wall there were six novices prac
ticing the business of waving pom-pons to the tune
of "Come Join the Band."
"No, no!" yelled the instructor. "Put more wiggle
into it. How do you expect us to beat Cal thus year
if you don't put all you've got into it?"
I nodded my head in agreement, Looking around
this dazzling atmosphere, I saw a coed garbed in
white sitting at her desk. Gee, a student leader, I
thought. My approach toward her desk was, I confess,
quiet and reserved, for I am that sort of person.
"Pardon me, Miss, but 1 . . . ." A frog caught in
my throat. Thank God it wasn't something bigger.
"Well, boy, what is it? Can't you see I'm busy?" I
felt that maybe she wasn't happy to see me.
"It's just that I—you see, I thought maybe . . . ."
"Speak up. you man. S;iy what you've got to say.
It's here in college that you should learn how to be
forceful, how to be a leader."
This woman has it, I thought. "Well, golly gee,
I d like to get on Rally Corn."
"YOU?" She surveyed me in a quick glance. "Are
you qualified?"
"I'm enrolled."

"There are 8.000 students enrolled. Do you think
that just anyone will do?"
"I guess not."
"Were you a wheel in high school? Have you been
chairman of any committees? Do you know anyone
on Upper Row?"
I cringed.
"Well, maybe you've got some good ideas. One of
our mo I reliable members, been on Rally Com for
six years, suggested that we ask Marchie to have
the boys on the bench wave pom-pons as long as
they're not doing anything else. Now, that sort of
idea makes progress, makes the world move."
"Well, I'm not very smart, but I've got an idea."
I looked languidly into her horn-rimmed glasses and
eyed the gleam on her saddle shoes, for I'm a devil
that way.
"Speak up, speak up."
I clutched at my pom-pon to gain coinage and
then spoke, "I thought that as long as you have girls
waving thtir pom-pons in front of the men's I'ooting
section, maybe I could wave my pom-pon in front
of the women's rooting section."
"You impudent male, you conceited—you, you.
To think of all the work I do and to have to put up
with you." A tear came into her eye. "I was happier
as president of the student body in high school."
"1 was only trying to be helpful," I said as I edged
toward the door, for I felt that she might throw a
yell-leader or something at me.
But I am undaunted in my desire to help Rally
Com. When you finish reading this paper, don't throw
it into the air. Pass it to the person on your right.

white sitting at her desk. Gee, a student leader, I
thought. My approach toward her desk was, I confess,
quiet and reserved, for I am that sort of person.
"Pardon me, Miss, but 1 . . . ." A frog caught in
my throat. Thank God it wasn't something bigger.
"Well, boy, what is it? Can't you see I'm busy?" I
felt that maybe she wasn't happy to see me.
"It's just that I—you see, I thought maybe . . . ."
"Speak up. you man. S;iy what you've got to say.
It's here in college that you should learn how to be
forceful, how to be a leader."
This woman has it, I thought. "Well, golly gee,
I d like to get on Rally Corn."
"YOU?" She surveyed me in a quick glance. "Are
you qualified?"
"I'm enrolled."

"There are 8.000 students enrolled. Do you think
that just anyone will do?"
"I guess not."
"Were you a wheel in high school? Have you been
chairman of any committees? Do you know anyone
on Upper Row?"
I cringed.
"Well, maybe you've got some good ideas. One of
our mo I reliable members, been on Rally Com for
six years, suggested that we ask Marchie to have
the boys on the bench wave pom-pons as long as
they're not doing anything else. Now, that sort of
idea makes progress, makes the world move."
"Well, I'm not very smart, but I've got an idea."
I looked languidly into her horn-rimmed glasses and
eyed the gleam on her saddle shoes, for I'm a devil
that way.
"Speak up, speak up."
I clutched at my pom-pon to gain coinage and
then spoke, "I thought that as long as you have girls
waving thtir pom-pons in front of the men's I'ooting
section, maybe I could wave my pom-pon in front
of the women's rooting section."
"You impudent male, you conceited—you, you.
To think of all the work I do and to have to put up
with you." A tear came into her eye. "I was happier
as president of the student body in high school."
"1 was only trying to be helpful," I said as I edged
toward the door, for I felt that she might throw a
yell-leader or something at me.
But I am undaunted in my desire to help Rally
Com. When you finish reading this paper, don't throw
it into the air. Pass it to the person on your right.
Let's give Big Six for Rally Com. Being an en
thusiastic rooter in the true Stanford spirit, I felt
that I should do something for the team. I bow hum
bly when I pass the training quarters and cheer
wildly when the television camera is turned on me.
Somehow I felt this wasn't enough, so I went over
to join Rcijly Com, pom-pon in hand.
The office was a hustle of activity as I walked in.
Along the right wall there were six novices prac
ticing the business of waving pom-pons to the tune
of "Come Join the Band."
"No, no!" yelled the instructor. "Put more wiggle
into it. How do you expect us to beat Cal thus year
if you don't put all you've got into it?"
I nodded my head in agreement, Looking around
this dazzling atmosphere, I saw a coed garbed in
white sitting at her desk. Gee, a student leader, I
thought. My approach toward her desk was, I confess,
quiet and reserved, for I am that sort of person.
