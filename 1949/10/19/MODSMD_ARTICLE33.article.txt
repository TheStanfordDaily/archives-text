## The 						Front Row 
### 
While Stanford was shearing the Shaggy Cog last Saturday, 1 was
sitting in Strawberry Canyon watching Bear bash Trojan.
It was enlightening.
Pappy''s Bears, although they have lost enough regulars to destroy two
ballclubs, are still a top football power. And USC's Trojans, jusl like
the notices said, are still rugged, loaded, and a tough team to beat.
Both teams have done, can, and will do a lot of damage to their foot
ball l'oes. And sadly enough, both teams remain on Stanford's uphill
schedule.
First in line, the USC meeting falls due on November 5 in the Coliseum,
and all Stanford's revived Rose Bowl talk should be held back until late
that afternoon.
Even after taking a final look at the scoreboard last week. I still can't
help feeling that USC will be tougher for Stanford than California. Per
haps, BOTH clubs will be 100 tough.
But, it looked to me as if Cal's Golden Bears were playing a bit over
their golden heads, and that J. N\ Cravath's Blundering Herd was play
ing right into their hands.
Both clubs made mistakes. Line play was vicious, by far the meanest
I've seen this season. Both clubs had their moments. Cal carried the
first half, and then Troy was having its own way in the second, that is,
until Frank Brunk and his blockers broke up the middle with a 102-yard
center plung^.
California gained an edge in quarterbacking, as Stanford's old cousin,
Bob Celeri, looked like a different man. His ability to hide the ball, pass,
and run himself out of holes, was the difference.
Celeri's main fault, as usual, was in his fading hack too deep to toss
the ball. A couple til i linemen such as Cappy Cook or Jess Cone
might ruin him.
SC's quarterbacking wasn't up to par. Jim "Mystic Powers discovered
early that he couldn't gain through the middle, but he didn't seem to take
the hint. He completely overlooked a short-passing game which would
have run the Bears dizzy.
Lefty Wil Robertson finally got the idea and engineered Troy's two
payoff drives, but after Brunk's run, he went to pieces. Of course, after
a run like that, anybody is apt to come up in pieces.
SC's power back, Boom-boom Bill Martin was disappointing. Every
where he went a stone wall preceded.
Ami if Trojan Boh Stilwell is an All-American end. then Indian Ken
Kose is All-Universe or All-Atmosphere.
Cal's spirit was at the heights. It will stay that way until somebody
knocks the Bear back down where he belongs. Waldorf has done a won
derful job in patching up gaps and firing up his boys, but it can't last
much longer.
Cal, even with a starting team half full of Ramblers, has forgotten how
to lose. If Oregon and UCLA fail to remind the Bears, then Stanford will
have a much more difficult task.
One thing is apparent. The race for roses is wide open again. Five
teams are still hanging around. You know them as well as I do. Cali
fornia, USC, UCLA, Oregon, and Stanford.
Don't count USC out. Wait until after the Oregon game Saturday be
fore saying anything rash. The Trojans get better as time goes by every
campaign.
And all isn't lost down at Westwood, although I never liked the Bruins
in the first place. But they lead the Conference with 3 and 0.
And if Stanford gets by USC, IF that is, it might be the Biggest Big
Game in recent years.
But how do you know which if will happen first?
I dunno, how are you picking 'em?

While Stanford was shearing the Shaggy Cog last Saturday, 1 was
sitting in Strawberry Canyon watching Bear bash Trojan.
It was enlightening.
Pappy''s Bears, although they have lost enough regulars to destroy two
ballclubs, are still a top football power. And USC's Trojans, jusl like
the notices said, are still rugged, loaded, and a tough team to beat.
Both teams have done, can, and will do a lot of damage to their foot
ball l'oes. And sadly enough, both teams remain on Stanford's uphill
schedule.
First in line, the USC meeting falls due on November 5 in the Coliseum,
and all Stanford's revived Rose Bowl talk should be held back until late
that afternoon.
Even after taking a final look at the scoreboard last week. I still can't
help feeling that USC will be tougher for Stanford than California. Per
haps, BOTH clubs will be 100 tough.
But, it looked to me as if Cal's Golden Bears were playing a bit over
their golden heads, and that J. N\ Cravath's Blundering Herd was play
ing right into their hands.
Both clubs made mistakes. Line play was vicious, by far the meanest
I've seen this season. Both clubs had their moments. Cal carried the
first half, and then Troy was having its own way in the second, that is,
until Frank Brunk and his blockers broke up the middle with a 102-yard
center plung^.
California gained an edge in quarterbacking, as Stanford's old cousin,
Bob Celeri, looked like a different man. His ability to hide the ball, pass,
and run himself out of holes, was the difference.
Celeri's main fault, as usual, was in his fading hack too deep to toss
the ball. A couple til i linemen such as Cappy Cook or Jess Cone
might ruin him.
SC's quarterbacking wasn't up to par. Jim "Mystic Powers discovered
early that he couldn't gain through the middle, but he didn't seem to take
the hint. He completely overlooked a short-passing game which would
have run the Bears dizzy.
Lefty Wil Robertson finally got the idea and engineered Troy's two
payoff drives, but after Brunk's run, he went to pieces. Of course, after
a run like that, anybody is apt to come up in pieces.
SC's power back, Boom-boom Bill Martin was disappointing. Every
where he went a stone wall preceded.
Ami if Trojan Boh Stilwell is an All-American end. then Indian Ken
Kose is All-Universe or All-Atmosphere.
Cal's spirit was at the heights. It will stay that way until somebody
knocks the Bear back down where he belongs. Waldorf has done a won
derful job in patching up gaps and firing up his boys, but it can't last
much longer.
Cal, even with a starting team half full of Ramblers, has forgotten how
to lose. If Oregon and UCLA fail to remind the Bears, then Stanford will
have a much more difficult task.
One thing is apparent. The race for roses is wide open again. Five
teams are still hanging around. You know them as well as I do. Cali
fornia, USC, UCLA, Oregon, and Stanford.
Don't count USC out. Wait until after the Oregon game Saturday be
fore saying anything rash. The Trojans get better as time goes by every
campaign.
And all isn't lost down at Westwood, although I never liked the Bruins
in the first place. But they lead the Conference with 3 and 0.
And if Stanford gets by USC, IF that is, it might be the Biggest Big
Game in recent years.
But how do you know which if will happen first?
I dunno, how are you picking 'em?
