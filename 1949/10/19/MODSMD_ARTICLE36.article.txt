# Washington Tilt Costly; Injuries Bench 3 Cards
## Indians Lead PCC in Total Offense; Rank Second to Cal in Defense 
### 
The gloomy prediction that Russ
Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wes
i Poulson would be lost to the Stan
lord football team was borne out
j yesterday with the doctor's ruling
! that al! three men must be kept out
;of action this week. All three have
i been measured for knee braces and
should be lit for next week.
Rupe Andrews is also out at this
time with a sprained baek. He may
or may noi go against OSC. That
will not be known until later this
week. Dave Field is in the rest
home with a bad cold to add to his
tore back troubles. He may get an
I OK to play later this week.
SERIOUS BLOW
The loss of the three linemen is
indeed a serious blow to the Reds.
Pomeroy and Abraham have been
top-flight linebackers thus far this
year and can ili be spared.
Though the injury list is long and
serious, the Cards can look to the
past with some cheerfulness.
Stanford still leads the Pacific
Coast Conference in total offense
and rushing offense, but the 'Cards
have dropped to fourth place in the
passing offense department.
I With the season half over, the In
dians have marked up a five-game
average of 378 yards per game in
1 the total offense division. The Cards
have gained 1.264 yards on the
ground and 529 in the air for a 1,893
total. Oregon is second with 1.824.
DEFENSE STILL GOOD
Stanford's defensive record is still
i good though the Cards rank second
to California in total defense, 1.007
i for the Bears and 1,09(5 for the In
j dians.
And the strange status in regard
jto individual statistics still holds
true. Though the Cards lead the
I league in total offense, not one Red
j shirt is included among the 10 top
backs. Oregon State's Ken Carpen
! ter leads the loop with a fine 109-
| yard average for five games.
It is only in the rushing and pass
j ing departments that the Indians
j have placed a mah. And then it is
j only an eighth-place spot in the
| rushing division. Harry Hugasian
! has gained 233 yards to tie with
; Jack Seth of Washington. The Card
Hipster has a 5.2 average, compared
Ito Seth's 3.2 yards per carry.
Stanford quarterback Gary Ker
korian is the only other Card to
rate mention in the top divisions.
He is in fifth place in the passing
division.
KERKORIAN HAS .511 AVERAGE
Kerkorian has thrown 23 passes
out of 45 tries for 251 yards and a
.511 average. The Conference rates
I the passers by their percentages and
Kerkorian thus rates fifth place,
though Cal's Bob Celeri has hit for
404 yards and ninth place.
Bud Klein is tied for filth place
in scoring with 30 points in five
games. Bill McColl has dropped to
fifth spot in the pass-receiving sec
; tion after leading the loop for sev-
I eral weeks.
He has caught 13 passes for 155
yards and two touchdowns. Joe
Coidt of Washington leads the de

parti nent with 17 catches for 244
yards.
Dave Field is third in the pass
interception class with four steals in
five games. Bill DeYoung is the
only other Card placed in the Con
ference books, with an eighth-place
90-yard punt return average. That
man Carpenter leads this class with
138 yards for five returns.
The reason the Cards lead the
league but have no men in the in
dividual races is of course obvious.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has used
so many different backs that no one
man has had a chance to break into
the statistical lead.
Rupe Andrews can lay claim to
an average of eight yards per carry
and Bill DeYoung is not much be
low this, but neither lad has gained
enough yards to put him up with
the leaders.


DICK ABRAHAM, sturdy Stan
ford line-backer, will be out of
action this week because of a knee
injury received in the Husky
same at Seattle last Saturday.
