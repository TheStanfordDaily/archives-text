# Heinecke Was Farm Grid Great
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
One of Stanford's greatest grid
iron stars of all time is Walt Hei
necke, who runs the Shell service
station on the campus.
Heinecke played for the Cardinals
from 1926 to 1929. Those were the
rough, tough days of intercollegiate
football when a man would play 60
minutes of ball and think nothing
of it.
During his freshman year, this
5-ft. 6-in., 168-lb. ball of fire called
signals from the quarterback post.
The next year, under Pop Warner,
Heinecke was switched to center,
and it was at this position that he
gained his greatest glory. The im
mortal Mr. Warner picked Walt as
the best center he had ever coached.
ARMY BLASTER 26-0
In 1927 the Indians lost only to
USC before going East to face the
vaunted West Point Cadets, who had
beaten lour of the top teams in the
country. It gave Heinecke one of
his greatest thrills when the Indians
returned home with a 26-0 victory
under their belts. The Farm squad
then polished off Pittsburgh, 7 to 6,
in the Rose Bowl to finish up a
highly successful year.
The 1928 season found several re
versals. but the Indians rose up to
tie mighty California 13-13. This
was the year that the Bears met
Georgia Tech in the Rose Bowl.
After the game the Stanford Daily
had this to say about Heinecke: "If
All-Americans are to be considered,
there was only one man on that field
Saturday who exhibited sufficient
worthiness for consideration. That
man was the little pugnacious cen
ter, Walt Heinecke, who again
proved himself a great center and
a great leader. He was the outstand
ing man of the game for consistency
on offense and defense. Not one of
the highly touted Bears, Lam,
Schmidt, Phillips, or Eisen, com
pared with Heinecke."
OUTPLAYS CAL CAPTAIN
In the 1929 Big Game the Indians
knocked California out of a Rose
Bowl invitation with an impressive
21-6 victory. To quote The Daily
after that game, "Walt Heinecke
clearly outplayed Captain Roy Rei
gals at center, and once again
proved that he is the best center on
the Coast." Reigals had more press
clippings, however, so was picked
on the majority of All-American
teams.
Walt was like so many other
Stanford grads who became so at
tached to the school during their
school days that they decided to
spend the rest of their lives on the
campus.
After a brief period as assistant
coach, he took over the Shell sta
tion on Embarcadero in 1932. Six
years later he took over as head man
at the campus station, where he has
been ever since.
Walt isn't the only star athlete at
the station. His assistant. Monte
Phyl, played shortstop for the Car
dinals from 1939 to 1941. He was
good enough to make the All-Time
Stanford Baseball Team.
