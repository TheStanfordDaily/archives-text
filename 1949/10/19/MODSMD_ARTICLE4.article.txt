# Coal-Steel Strikes
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The government
stepped lip its efforts to settle the
twin coal-steel strikes today. Both
disputes seem to be ncaring a show
down.
Unless mediation chief Cyrus N.
Ching makes headway in either
strike this week, there are strong
indications he will turn them over
to President Truman as hopeless.
Then Mr. Truman would decide
whether or not to use a Taft-Hart
ley court injunction or industry
seizure to get the strikers back to
work.
