### 
Rallying behind the running and
passing of Juke Preston, Delta Up
silon overcame an eight-point half
time deficit to down the Phi Kappa
Sigma Blacks 13-8 in a feature in
tramural grid contest yesterday.
The Blacks' intermission advan
tage looked commanding enough
until Preston's end skirts and aerials
to Norm Latlin and Mike Pelsinger
produced two scores in six minutes.
Preston's spot pass to center Jim
Caldwell accounted for the game's
lone conversion.
Banking solely on the strong l ight
arm of Lloyd Kelly, the Phi Kaps
completely dominated the first-pe
riod play. Ed Askev and Jim Mc-
Gillis were his receivers, as he en
gineered a scoring march on the
Blacks' first offensive effort.
When Ed Palette blocked Mike
Pelsinger's punt deep in the DU
end zone, the Blacks had an 8-0 lead
with but 10 minutes of playing time
elapsed.
The SAE's continued their win
ning ways at the expense of the Al
pha Delts 21-(i, even without the
services of Gay Bryan, thus main
taining their undefeated status.
The day's remaining meetings
found Village 310 overwhelming
Village 308 31-0. while Stern 1 and
2 played a scoreless deadlock with
Stern 3 and 4. Two scheduled games
were not played.
