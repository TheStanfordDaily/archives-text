# Fair Picture Tries Humor, Almost Hits
## 
### 
"P'ollow the Leader" is an excit
ing often played by Holly
wood producers. Once one -studio
has made a picture that "clicks,"

other studios hop
aboard the same
film strips.
Paramo un t
■started the ''hu
man" religious
pictures with
"Going My Way,"

and now Fox has picked up the
camera angles with "Come to the
Stable," now playing at the Park
Theater.
"Come to the Stable" is a good
picture which might be better if
it weren't trying so hard to be cute,
! vivacious, and chuckle-filled.
A paper-thin plot about the difii-
I culties of two nuns to build a hos
: pital is tied together by a series
of episodes. Several of these epi-
I sodes are lifted higher thnn the ma
! to rial warrants by fine performances
by Loretta Young, Elsa Lancaster,
! and Celeste Holm. Miss Holm, a
convert from Broadway music com
! edy, has been typed into serious
roles and for once, Hollywood re
verse casting has hit the jackpot.
Hitting the jackpot is. an apt
I phrase to describe one of the film's
! funniest scenes. Celeste Holm has
: distributed religious medals to the
film gangsters. A "miracle" occurs
i as one ol the tough guys slips the

medal into a penny gum machine
and is showered with gum. Scenes
like this and the game on the tennis
court seem spontaneously funny.
When humor is attempted from the
embarrassment laymen feel in the
presence of the nuns, the film ceases
to be funny. Miss Young's reckless
jeep-driving is placed on the nebu
lous borderline of being both funny
and slightly eml arassing.
The nuns overcome difficulties
heroically. They persuade a wicked
gangster to give them the property
tor their hospital; they induce the
Bishop to allow them to stay in
America; they are even deeded a
building by the hostile young song
writer. If you will accept the prem
ise that faith accomplishes every
thing, you can sit back and enjoy
t the film wholeheartedly. To me,
1 "Come to the Stable" is weaker than
"Going My Way" because it is con
j siderably less probable, without
! being a fantasy.

picture which might be better if
it weren't trying so hard to be cute,
! vivacious, and chuckle-filled.
A paper-thin plot about the difii-
I culties of two nuns to build a hos
: pital is tied together by a series
of episodes. Several of these epi-
I sodes are lifted higher thnn the ma
! to rial warrants by fine performances
by Loretta Young, Elsa Lancaster,
! and Celeste Holm. Miss Holm, a
convert from Broadway music com
! edy, has been typed into serious
roles and for once, Hollywood re
verse casting has hit the jackpot.
Hitting the jackpot is. an apt
I phrase to describe one of the film's
! funniest scenes. Celeste Holm has
: distributed religious medals to the
film gangsters. A "miracle" occurs
i as one ol the tough guys slips the

medal into a penny gum machine
and is showered with gum. Scenes
like this and the game on the tennis
court seem spontaneously funny.
When humor is attempted from the
embarrassment laymen feel in the
presence of the nuns, the film ceases
to be funny. Miss Young's reckless
jeep-driving is placed on the nebu
lous borderline of being both funny
and slightly eml arassing.
The nuns overcome difficulties
heroically. They persuade a wicked
gangster to give them the property
tor their hospital; they induce the
Bishop to allow them to stay in
America; they are even deeded a
building by the hostile young song
writer. If you will accept the prem
ise that faith accomplishes every
thing, you can sit back and enjoy
t the film wholeheartedly. To me,
1 "Come to the Stable" is weaker than
"Going My Way" because it is con
j siderably less probable, without
! being a fantasy.

"P'ollow the Leader" is an excit
ing often played by Holly
wood producers. Once one -studio
has made a picture that "clicks,"

other studios hop
aboard the same
film strips.
Paramo un t
■started the ''hu
man" religious
pictures with
"Going My Way,"

and now Fox has picked up the
camera angles with "Come to the
Stable," now playing at the Park
Theater.
"Come to the Stable" is a good
picture which might be better if
it weren't trying so hard to be cute,
! vivacious, and chuckle-filled.
