# Reds' Bomb Made in '47

LAKE SUCCESS, Oct. 18 (IP) â€”
Russia's Andrei Vishinsky, blasting
anew at a campaign to put Yugosla
via on the Security Council, said to
day that for Russia the atomic bomb
has been "a real weapon" since 1047.
He threatened "painful conse
quences" for the United Nations if
Yugoslavia wins a Security Council
;eat with American support over
Soviet-sponsored Czechoslovakia.
At a news conference Vishinsky
reminded reporters of the Tass com
munique of last September 25 which
disclosed that Russia has had an
atomic weapon since 1947.
This was the farthest Vishinsky
has gone in the current UN session
on Russia's possession of the A
bomb. On September 2.'1 he said the
United States has no monopoly on
the bomb but did not amplify the
statement.
Vishinsky declared in a statement
that the Eastern European countries
had picked Czechoslovakia for the
seat the Soviet Ukraine will give up
December 31 after a two-year term.
Yugos'avia's election, Vishinsky
said, would violate the UN charter,
break a gentlemen's agreement on
the allocation of seats, and further
aggravate East - West differences,
leading to "painful consequences."
