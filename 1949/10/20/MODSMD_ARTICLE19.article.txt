# Long Established Stanford Landmark Removed in Steam Plant Renovation
## 
### 
Last week drayers toro down one
of Stanford's long-established land
marks— the lofty smokestack atop
the steam plant across from the
Athletic Building.
Probably the tallest spire on cam
pus before completion of the Hoover
Tower, the stack was removed as i
part of a $17(5,000 master improve
ment project begun this summer to !
renovate the Farm's now-outmoded
steam plant, parts of which date I
back to as early as 1002.
The pipe was the successor to the j
100-foot stack on the engineering J
corner which collapsed in the 190(i j
earthquake. Later it was shortened
because of its unsightliness when
Frost Amphitheater was built.
Now decommissioned and lying on |
its side behind the steam plant, the j
old pipe will be replaced by four :
blower fans and a series of short j
smokestacks.
A new 1,000 - horsepower boiler
unit is also scheduled for installa
tion, replacing two 17-year-old boil- '
eis. Ultimately the four boilers
planned will turn out ,''.ooo horse
power as compared with the formei
1,800-horsepower capacity.
An old member of the Stanford
setting has disappeared — but has
b<'en well exchanged lor a more
modern unit pari of the Stanford
to be.


TIMBER! Workers are shown rcmo/ing the near-100-foot smoke
stack frcm atop the Stanford steam plant last Wednesday. The
removal is part of a $176,000 project begun this summer to
renovate the University's outdated steam plant, located on
Galvez Avenue across the street from the Department of Ath
letics.
