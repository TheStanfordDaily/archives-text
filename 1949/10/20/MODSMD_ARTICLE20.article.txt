### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (/P) — ,
Winter with all its trappings dc- ;
scended on California and the West !
this week.
A snow storm Tuesday, which
covered Mt. Diablo, Mt. Hamilton,
and much of the Skyline Boulevard
with a mantle of snow, shed the last ■
of its wintry flurries over the high
Sierra today.
In Northern California three
mountain roads were closed by the
snowfall, but the main California to
Nevada routes —U.S. Highways 40
and 50 —remained open.
WARMER WEATHER
Warmer weather, preceded by
early-morning frost, was forecast for
most of California today in the wake
of Tuesday's storm that brought un
seasonable rain, hail, snow, and high
winds to the state.
The cold snap that accompanied
the California storm brought new
record low temperatures for October
to many sections. In some instances
there was damage by the nippy
weather to vegetable and flower
crops.
Nevada, like California, was hit by
the storm and the Reno-Las Vegas
State Route 95 was partly blocked
Tuesday night by eight inches of
snow. At Las Vegas, where only
two days before business establish
ments shut off air - conditioning
units, the temperature dropped to
a chilly 33.
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
Fresno, in Central California, re
ported 30. the lowest October tem
perature on record. The frosty
weather damaged vegetables and
flower gardens and endangered Em
peror grapes.

yesterday included: 15 at Rlue Can
yon, in the Donner area: 28 at Paso
Robles; Salinas 37; Bakersfie'.d 39;
Sacramento 42; Oakland 43; San
Francisco 4fi; Los Angeles 48; and
San Diego 50.
On the coast high winds lashed
the seaboard. Trees were uprooted
and boats beached. Huge waves
boomed over the sea wall at Re
dondo Beach.
Frost experts warned citrus grow
ers of expected 25-degree tempera
tures in lowland groves, as residents
inspected the damage that hail, frost.
| rain, wind, and dust had done in the
1 last 24 hours.

Mountains, reported the low of 17
degrees and four inches of snow. It
