# On a Clean Nitery
## 
### 
Until the new Union, now still in the plan
ning stage, is built, the Nitery remains one
of the few central places on campus where
students can go for a Coke, bridge game, or
to study.
During the v/inter months, especially, it's
a good place for off-campus students to take
their lunches at noon-time and meet their
friends.
The Nitery should be a good lounge—
there's nothing actually wrong with it—there
are adeguate chairs, lighting, and a radio.
But the room is so dirty and messy most
of the time that it looks like a large family of
pack-rats inhabited it.
If students would take a few minutes to

put chairs back in place, throw their papers
in the trash cans, and replace Coke bottles,
there would be an immense improvement.
Furthermore, the Nitery looks as though no
one ever swept it. Last Saturday a conven- j
tion of high school editors met there at 4 p.m. ;
for refreshments before going home. Part of j
the purpose behind bringing the prepsters
down to the campus is to give them a favor
able impression of the campus.
We are sure that no high school would
ever tolerate the filth that littered the Nitery
Saturday afternoon.
If the students and administration would
co-operate, the Nitery could be a much more
pleasant lounge for many more people.- —M.K. j
