# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Poor old Rally Com.
Every Tom, Dick, and Bull Sessionist who comes
along likes to take a swat at this innocent group
of white sweaters.
So, feeling a little like that fellow who lived 1,940

years ago, I figured it was about
time somebody put in a good
word for them.
With this thought in mind I
walked over to the Western Civ
Libe yesterday to interview one
of the l'rush members, hoping
that perhaps I could uncover a
fresh virgin of what makes Rally
Com tick.
I came across my subject, a
little blonde in a white sweater,
who was thumbing through her

lecture syllabus which, strangely enough, was up
side down.
"Pardon me," I began simply, ''but your syllabus
is upside down."
"Certainly," she countered. "It's all part of Rally
Com policy to teach us to do everything the hard
way."
This stopped me for a moment, but I started out
on a new angle.

"What ever happened to those slogan stickers
Rally Com used to paste on all the car windows
before each game?' 1 I asked.
"People were Melting tired of MASHING THE PO
TATO. SHEARING THE SHAGGY DOG, and
PUNCTURING THE TROJAN," she admitted.
"That's probably tiue," I offered. "How's Rally
Com taking the cold weather?"
"Just fine, juit fine;" she said without emotion.
"We're working on a plan to have everyone with
red noses sit in a designated spot and make a block
"S" in the section Saturday,"
"That's hot,'' I "aid coldly.
And with that she went back to her syllabus arid I
went back to The Daily Shack. There must be some
thing good to say about RC, I thought to myself.
"Say whatlaya think of Rally Com?" I asked the
sports editor.
He belched twice, looked wildly lor the door, and
went for it fust- r than a Roble girl heading home
after a 10:25 kiss in the parking lot at Dinah's.
1 was disappointed when he didn't get as far as the
door, but 1 said out. loud, "I'm going to say some
thing good about Rally Com if it kills me."

"Pardon me," I began simply, ''but your syllabus
is upside down."
"Certainly," she countered. "It's all part of Rally
Com policy to teach us to do everything the hard
way."
This stopped me for a moment, but I started out
on a new angle.

"What ever happened to those slogan stickers
Rally Com used to paste on all the car windows
before each game?' 1 I asked.
"People were Melting tired of MASHING THE PO
TATO. SHEARING THE SHAGGY DOG, and
PUNCTURING THE TROJAN," she admitted.
"That's probably tiue," I offered. "How's Rally
Com taking the cold weather?"
"Just fine, juit fine;" she said without emotion.
"We're working on a plan to have everyone with
red noses sit in a designated spot and make a block
"S" in the section Saturday,"
"That's hot,'' I "aid coldly.
And with that she went back to her syllabus arid I
went back to The Daily Shack. There must be some
thing good to say about RC, I thought to myself.
"Say whatlaya think of Rally Com?" I asked the
sports editor.
He belched twice, looked wildly lor the door, and
went for it fust- r than a Roble girl heading home
after a 10:25 kiss in the parking lot at Dinah's.
1 was disappointed when he didn't get as far as the
door, but 1 said out. loud, "I'm going to say some
thing good about Rally Com if it kills me."

Poor old Rally Com.
Every Tom, Dick, and Bull Sessionist who comes
along likes to take a swat at this innocent group
of white sweaters.
So, feeling a little like that fellow who lived 1,940

years ago, I figured it was about
time somebody put in a good
word for them.
With this thought in mind I
walked over to the Western Civ
Libe yesterday to interview one
of the l'rush members, hoping
that perhaps I could uncover a
fresh virgin of what makes Rally
Com tick.
I came across my subject, a
little blonde in a white sweater,
who was thumbing through her

lecture syllabus which, strangely enough, was up
side down.
"Pardon me," I began simply, ''but your syllabus
is upside down."
"Certainly," she countered. "It's all part of Rally
Com policy to teach us to do everything the hard
way."
This stopped me for a moment, but I started out
on a new angle.
