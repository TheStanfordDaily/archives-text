# Armed Forces Feud
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Five - star Gen.
Omar N. Bradley told Congress to
day that the bitter row between the
armed services has done "infinite
harm" to the national defense, and
lie cautioned against setting the!
stage for another Pearl Harbor.
Tersely, the chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff advised all of the na
tion's fighting men to forget their
feuds and "get on with the job."
In solemn tones, Bradley declared
that if there had been greater team
work within the armed forces prior
to the last war, the catastrophe of
Pearl Harbor might never have hap- j
pened.
And the lesson of Pearl Harbor,
he said, should have taught all mili
tary men that our forces are all one
team, in the game to win regardless
of who carries the ball.
