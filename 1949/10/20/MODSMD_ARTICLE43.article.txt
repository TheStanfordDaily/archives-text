ROSES—For Those Who Are Prone To Dream: The Golden Bears of
the University of California will not go to the Rose Bowl this year, ll' |
they should tie with some team for the Pacific Coast Conference charn- j
pionship. The decision is, of course, left to the PCC iaculty representatives |
—as it is every year -who will take the Conferences annual tiouncing ■
from the Big Ten, but unless they renege on theix own ruling their choice j
won't be Cal on a tie. As you probably don't recall, these representatives j
voted last January that "in the future the team most recently in the i
Pasadena classic will step aside in case ot a tie.
Right now—with the season hall over —there are no less than five teams ,
in serious contention lor the Bowl: Undefeated Cal and UCLA (in Con- ,
ftrence play, that it), and the once-beaten lads ol Stanford, USC, and
Oregon. The betting odds wouldn't be too bad for either one, but Stan- !
lord, believe it or not, seems to have the schedule edge. All but Stanford
j ruts t play three of the big five this season, while the Indians get to skip
Oregon and must take on only Troy and Oskie.
Anil if the Sehwarztmen should go the distance, their Bowl chances j
are pretty darn good. If we should tie Cal, we go to the Rose Bowl. The
same if we tie USC and/or UCLA for the PCC crown. If we tie Oregon
— whoops!— Oregon gets to face the Golden Gophers.
Oregon has not been in the Rose Bowl since January 1, 1917. when they
)xat Pennsylvania, 14-0. Excepting last year, Oregon has come close to
tfoing only one other time: in 1933 Oregon lost one game and tied Stanford, j
which had lost a hearlbreaker to Washington, 0-6, for the crown. Mr. Tho
leau's excellent record book tells us that our Vow Boys were beaten in
the Bowl, 7-0, by Lou Little's surprising Lions of Columbia.
We hope that history doesn't repeat itself in reverse this year. Moral
ot' story: Root for Troy (as much as it hurts you) in next Saturday's
Coliseum classic.
Dis and Data Stuff Served With the Morning Flapjacks:
Li 1' Ol' Davey Field, who is playing his fourth year ol football for Stan
ford—including one year of JV—has never tallied a touchdown lor his
old Alma Mater. Dave likes being the team's top defensive ace, but he
would like to ling the bell once. Maybe he'll take one of those pass
interceptions back some day.
On the other side of the ledger is fullback Bud Klein. Bud is one of the
team's top scorers, v/ith live touchdowns so i'ar this season. His heart
breaking story is that, although he has averaged over a point a minute
for the time he's been in the ball game, he hasn't yet played hall' enough
time to earn his letter.
Movie Review on the Sports Page: The greatest cinema triumph since
"The Spirit of Stanford," is being screened tonight at 7:30 in the Ed. And.
A little dilly called "Washington vs. Stanford, 1949." It is a flick that is
.sure to please, amuse, and exalt all Cardinal screen patrons. Things to
watch lor include: Ken Peck (No. 4) getting in on nearly every tackle in
the first half. Davey Field (No, !>) making two pass interceptions that
were not so sensational as they were unbelievable. Billy DeYoung (No. 20)
nearly outrunning Washington's oh-so frustrated Hugh "I Play for Money
McElhenny who had the angle on him. Captain Jim Castagnoli (No. -14)
happily polishing off McElhenny on the last play of a fine goal-line stand.
Iloly Boruck (No. 45) playing good ball on a bad ankle. The best quar
tet-backing since the war by three Redshirts numbered 17, 54, and 41.
And Emery Mitchell's (No. 21) great (slightly better than magnificent)
(KJ-yard quick kick.
And best of all—from a movie-reviewer's standpoint—the grand clincher
and happy ending part of motioncinema: Buddy Klein (No. 22) happy
timing it in beautiful ballet style into the Husky end zone early in the
fourth stanza.
The photography work on this flick is ultra-exceptional, since the di
minutive size of the Seattle Stadium lets the camera get close enough to
the field to show the tears in the eyes of the "heavy," the purple-shirted
No. 32.
Good flick, don't miss it.
