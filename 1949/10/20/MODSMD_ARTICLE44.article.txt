## Beavers Leading Indians In Postwar Competition 
### EARL ODELL 
| Ever since 1938, when the Beavers !
I of Oregon State defeated Stanford j
i (i to 0. the Orangemen have been ol \
, the opinion that the modern Indians I
| yren't the equivalent of their an- j
! cestors.
i Up to that fateful day the Beavers
I had crossed the Card goal but nine !
: times in 12 games since the opener I
| in 1919 and had yet to win a single J
game, although they did manage to j
gel away with a scoreless tie in '37. !
According to all facts, figures, and i
i crystal balls the '38 game was to be |
iust another scrimmage as far as the j
Farmhands were concerned; but the i
Electricians' Union went on a vaca- •
; lion and someone got his wires [
!crossed.
Although the Indians collected 10 j
I more first downs than the Beaver
! men, e'eated 213 yards against j
I State's 108 and passed for 75 yards j
j without allowing a single connee- I
j tion for the opposition, the score j
i wound up at f> to 0 in favor of the j
[ orange-jerseyed men of the north. ]
STILL NO LUCK
To add insult to injury* the Bea
! vers came back in 1939 to win over
' the Cardinals 12 to 0. That was the
j day Frankie Albert made his debut
i on the varsity; but the "boys from '
| the Farm were outclassed coming
] and going and, with the poor show-

ing Stanford made that day, they
were lucky to hold Ihe score down.
The 1940 game, however, proved
to be an Indian of a difTerent color.
After being tied 7 to 7 at half-time,
the Big Red 'Machine began to roll,
racking up three more TD's to win
28 to 14.
On October 11. 1941, Oregon State
again lowered the boom, this time
on a Cardinal team reeking with the
scent of Roses. The Indians appeared
on the field with 12 consecutive
scalps neatly tucked in their hip
pads. They were "T"eeming with
strength in al! positions, and had Al
bert the Great and "Skeeter" Peter
Kmetovic along for good measure.
ADIEU TO ROSES
By all the rights they should have \
slaughtered Lon Stiner's weak ;
eleven; but after Kmetovic was I
packed ofl' in the early minutes of J
the game, the great Red team |
seemed to fall apart, and they left ■
the grid on the short end of a 10
to 0 score.
They were never the same after
that game and consequently lost j
their chance for the Rose Bowl trip. '
In 1942 the Farm hands trounced !
the Beavers 49 to 13 in partial re- ,
ta'iation, but the boys on the '41 '
team will never forget how many '

I dreams went out the window after
i the 1941 game against Oregon State.
In the post-war '4(5 game between
the l?ed and the Orange neither
team so much as breathed on either
j one of the goal stripes, and the sec
! ond scoreless tie between the two
i schools went into the record books.
I The last encounter between the
i Indians and the Beavers ;avv the
j Stinermen squeak by on the
; strength of a blocked kick with the
. linal score a sickening 13 to 7 for
I the Oregon Staters.
} With a win-loss record of 13 and 4
plus 2 ties. Stanford meets a Bea-
I ver team that is now tinder a new
J coach, Kip Taylor. Needless to say,
j the Injuns are out to scalp the Ben-
I vers for the 14th time.
