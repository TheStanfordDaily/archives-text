# Research Institute Gives Invaluable Technical Aid

### AL McCOMBS 
Four hundred campus residents braved a chilly trek to Me
morial Auditorium Tuesday evening to hear Dr. J. E. Hobson,
executive director of the Stanford Research Institute, explain
the 52,000,000-a-year work of his research organization. Stu
dents, scientific and otherwise, were noticeably in a minority.

Dr. Hobson's talk commemorated
lhe third anniveutary of the SRI,
which is the brainchild of the late
president, Dr. Donald B. Tresiddcr;
former Vice-President Alvin C. En
rich; and Atholi Mcßean, prominent
partner of the Gladding - Mcßean
Company, West Coast ceramics
manufacturers.
Mcßcan's interest in the research
project grew ,out of a desire among
West Coast industries to sponsor a
laboratory for their research, a
project over the financial heads of
any of the individual firms. Several
such labs had been developed in
the East and Midwest, but there was
none to serve the expanding West
Coast industry.
In November, 194(5, tlie SI!I was
established as a non-profit public
service project, financed to the tune
«112 $2,000,000 a year by various in
dustries and the government. All
research is confidential at the re
quest of the sponsoring firms, and
all patent rights go to the firms. The
Institute is governed by a board of
trustees, including 32 industrial, fi
nancial, and educational experts.
The president of the University is a
member of the board, along with
the president of the University
Board of Trustees.
The Institute was established in
the old administration building of
the Army's Dibble Hospital, taken
over by the University with the rest
of Stanford Village. The location of
the building at the Village offered a
twofold advantage: first, it was close
I enough to adequately serve the Uni
versity. yet far enough away so that
I it would not detract from the basic
j scientific training taught in the Uni
versity science and engineering
j schools. . * * *
According to Dr. Hobson, SRI is
1 self-supporting and financially inde
' pendent, and has just about cleared
its initial capital expense. A staff of
200 to 27. r > workers, half of them pro
j l'essionally trained, work for the In-
I stitutc at the Village and in the
two branches at Portland and Los
Angeles, as we'l as in the field.
Thirty per cent of the research is
•arrie I or for the government. SRI
i has in use laboratory equipment
valued at $750,000. The organization
' is operated like any industrial firm.
I Staff members are involved in field
research the world over. This Inst
i year they visited such places as Bra
zil, Ecuador, Alaska, and England,
aside from many areas in the United
States.
Aside from its scientific research,
the Institute does research in the
field of business and industrial eco
nomics, the only organization of its
kind to do so, Dr. Hobson believes.
