# Long Beach Notes Slipping Shoreline; Calls for Stanford Research Institute
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
When Long Beach harbor indus
' trialists discovered that their plants
1 wore due for a ducking, they turned
1 their heads north to the Stanford
i Research Institute. C; lifornia grape
growers, burdened with a crop cx
j cess, appealed to the SRI to solve
their headache, and a major airline
asked the Institute to a map for
them an economical route to Guate
mala. Such projects are only a
thimbleful when compared to the
; entire $2,000,000-a-year program of
research carried on by the Univer
sity's professional laboratory.
PROGRAM OUTLINED
Dr. J. F. Hobson, executive di
rector of tlx* institute, outlined this
program with colored slides in Me
morial Auditorium last Tuesday
night.
Research, said Dr. Ilobson. is
necessary for the maintenance of
the economic level and national se
curity. He then pointed out the
areas of invention which are wide
open for development. Among these
aer artificial lighting. the mechanics
of extreme pressures, graphic arts,
ceramics, food processing, texiiies,
and furnituVe making.
SRI surveys show that thi L >ng
Beach harbor shoreline is slipping
into the ocean at the rat" of one
•nd a hnlf feet a year, endangering
nill'ons of dollars worth of indus
trial euiprm nt perched on the har
bor ed'e.
I I (LAMA HON ATTEMPTS
Scientists from the institute's geo
logical di'dsjon came up with two
theories. On.' is that the drainage of
oil from the subsurface is can iiv<
the land to settle; the other, that
the upt ( i strata for some reason
arc settling and becoming more
compact With these two (henries in

mind, the SRI is attempting to find
a cure for the woes of the Long
Beach industrialists. Reclamation
and diking are now underway in
the area as a partial solution.
Los Angeles area industrialists
and health officers have come to the
institute for a solution lor the fam
ous Southland smog. SRI developed
special instruments to detect the
makeup of the smog and found that
40 different impurities were in
volved. Now. in a special 1 ack
yard testing chamber, they are at
tempting to ana'yze each impurity
to determine how it can be pre
vented.
Water contamination is another
problem being tackled by the SRI.
Other processes under continual de
vi lopment by the in tituto are
methods of using wood wastes, de
ioni/ation for watOr softening proc
esses. and more practical means of
delci mining the presence of oil in
the earth.
OTHER SKI WORK

chairman of the Department of Ge
ology and Geophysics, loaded down
with ice-testing equipment and
trudging across the face of a glacier
; »i Alaska appeared in various peri
odicals this last summer. Dr. Poul
ter led an expedition of SRI experts
across the Alaska ice flows to test
the thickness of individual niacins
lor the American Geogiaphieal So
ciety. His t sting methods were de
veloped at the South Pole on Byrd's
eeond expedition.
The behavior of aircralt antennas,
the CrUi-e of tumevogenic growths,
and the manufacture of glass ele
ments are other phases of SRI work
now underway.
In enn irurtinu sijace and couin

mcnt to carry out research, the SKI
planners provided for plenty of el
bow room. The drafting section of
ihe department of applied mechanics
takes up 1,800 square feet alone.
The precision gage laboratory is one
of the two in the Pacific Coast re
gion offering general industrial
service for testing master models for
mass production.
A 7,000-squarc-foot machine shop,
with an inventory value of almost
$400,000. serves all departments with
a potential work load capacity of
25.000 man-hours a year.
FROM ECONOMICS TO RADIO
The business and industrial eco
nomics division of the institute
delves into such problems as find
ing the most efficient channels for
the flow of industrial goods to the
consumer, since it has been deter
mined that . r )0 per cent of lite price
»l consumer's goods rises from sales
and marketing, while 40 per cent is
spent in the actual manufacture and
10 per cent in transportation.
California grapes pose a problem
for the stall' of the business eco
nomics department. More than
cnoii'.'h grapes have been produced
this year to take care of the wine
and lood needs of the country, plus
exports, so the SRI is trying to find
a new outlet for the crop.
Belter transportation and com
munication alto come under the re
search of the institute, which has
already turned out a new television
set adaptor and a TV transmitter
that cuts old equipment costs in
half.
One of the better known projects
being undertaken at SRI is the de
velopment of miniature radio- under
the direction of Dr. Cledo Drunetti.

PROGRAM OUTLINED
Dr. J. F. Hobson, executive di
rector of tlx* institute, outlined this
program with colored slides in Me
morial Auditorium last Tuesday
night.
Research, said Dr. Ilobson. is
necessary for the maintenance of
the economic level and national se
curity. He then pointed out the
areas of invention which are wide
open for development. Among these
aer artificial lighting. the mechanics
of extreme pressures, graphic arts,
ceramics, food processing, texiiies,
and furnituVe making.
SRI surveys show that thi L >ng
Beach harbor shoreline is slipping
into the ocean at the rat" of one
•nd a hnlf feet a year, endangering
nill'ons of dollars worth of indus
trial euiprm nt perched on the har
bor ed'e.
I I (LAMA HON ATTEMPTS
Scientists from the institute's geo
logical di'dsjon came up with two
theories. On.' is that the drainage of
oil from the subsurface is can iiv<
the land to settle; the other, that
the upt ( i strata for some reason
arc settling and becoming more
compact With these two (henries in

mind, the SRI is attempting to find
a cure for the woes of the Long
Beach industrialists. Reclamation
and diking are now underway in
the area as a partial solution.
Los Angeles area industrialists
and health officers have come to the
institute for a solution lor the fam
ous Southland smog. SRI developed
special instruments to detect the
makeup of the smog and found that
40 different impurities were in
volved. Now. in a special 1 ack
yard testing chamber, they are at
tempting to ana'yze each impurity
to determine how it can be pre
vented.
Water contamination is another
problem being tackled by the SRI.
Other processes under continual de
vi lopment by the in tituto are
methods of using wood wastes, de
ioni/ation for watOr softening proc
esses. and more practical means of
delci mining the presence of oil in
the earth.

The behavior of aircralt antennas,
the CrUi-e of tumevogenic growths,
and the manufacture of glass ele
ments are other phases of SRI work
now underway.
In enn irurtinu sijace and couin

mcnt to carry out research, the SKI

takes up 1,800 square feet alone.
The precision gage laboratory is one
of the two in the Pacific Coast re

service for testing master models for
mass production.

FROM ECONOMICS TO RADIO
The business and industrial eco

the flow of industrial goods to the
consumer, since it has been deter

and marketing, while 40 per cent is
spent in the actual manufacture and
10 per cent in transportation.
California grapes pose a problem
for the stall' of the business eco
nomics department. More than
cnoii'.'h grapes have been produced
this year to take care of the wine
and lood needs of the country, plus
exports, so the SRI is trying to find
a new outlet for the crop.
Belter transportation and com

that cuts old equipment costs in

One of the better known projects
being undertaken at SRI is the de

I I (LAMA HON ATTEMPTS
Scientists from the institute's geo
logical di'dsjon came up with two
theories. On.' is that the drainage of
oil from the subsurface is can iiv<
the land to settle; the other, that
the upt ( i strata for some reason
arc settling and becoming more
compact With these two (henries in

mind, the SRI is attempting to find
a cure for the woes of the Long
Beach industrialists. Reclamation
and diking are now underway in
the area as a partial solution.
Los Angeles area industrialists
and health officers have come to the
institute for a solution lor the fam
ous Southland smog. SRI developed
special instruments to detect the
makeup of the smog and found that
40 different impurities were in
volved. Now. in a special 1 ack
yard testing chamber, they are at
tempting to ana'yze each impurity
to determine how it can be pre
vented.
Water contamination is another
problem being tackled by the SRI.
Other processes under continual de
vi lopment by the in tituto are
methods of using wood wastes, de
ioni/ation for watOr softening proc
esses. and more practical means of
delci mining the presence of oil in
the earth.

across the Alaska ice flows to test
the thickness of individual niacins
lor the American Geogiaphieal So

The behavior of aircralt antennas,
the CrUi-e of tumevogenic growths,
and the manufacture of glass ele
ments are other phases of SRI work
now underway.
In enn irurtinu sijace and couin

mcnt to carry out research, the SKI
planners provided for plenty of el

takes up 1,800 square feet alone.
The precision gage laboratory is one
of the two in the Pacific Coast re

service for testing master models for
mass production.
A 7,000-squarc-foot machine shop,
with an inventory value of almost
$400,000. serves all departments with
a potential work load capacity of

FROM ECONOMICS TO RADIO
The business and industrial eco
nomics division of the institute
delves into such problems as find
ing the most efficient channels for
the flow of industrial goods to the
consumer, since it has been deter
mined that . r )0 per cent of lite price
»l consumer's goods rises from sales
and marketing, while 40 per cent is
spent in the actual manufacture and
10 per cent in transportation.
California grapes pose a problem
for the stall' of the business eco
nomics department. More than
cnoii'.'h grapes have been produced
this year to take care of the wine
and lood needs of the country, plus
exports, so the SRI is trying to find
a new outlet for the crop.
Belter transportation and com
munication alto come under the re
search of the institute, which has
already turned out a new television
set adaptor and a TV transmitter
that cuts old equipment costs in
half.
One of the better known projects
being undertaken at SRI is the de
velopment of miniature radio- under
the direction of Dr. Cledo Drunetti.

When Long Beach harbor indus
' trialists discovered that their plants
1 wore due for a ducking, they turned
1 their heads north to the Stanford

growers, burdened with a crop cx
j cess, appealed to the SRI to solve
their headache, and a major airline
asked the Institute to a map for
them an economical route to Guate
mala. Such projects are only a
thimbleful when compared to the

research carried on by the Univer

PROGRAM OUTLINED
Dr. J. F. Hobson, executive di
