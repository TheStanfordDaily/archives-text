# Indians Twenty-Point Favorites Over Beavers
## Pomeroy, Poulson, Abraham Out with Knee Injuries; Orangemen's Hopes Ride on Seatback Ken Carpenter 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's up-and-down Indian grid machine will find itself in the unfamiliar and unwanted
role of heavy favorite tomorrow when Oregon State headman "Kip" Taylor escorts his orange
shirted charges onto the Stadium turf for a 2:30 Conference appointment with the Redmen.
The Indians are pegged 20 points better than the northern invaders by the national form book.
And while such odds are apt to cause any coach at least a touch of uneasiness, Marchie

rSchwartz has particular reason fori
eyeing tomorrow's predictions with
.- lightly raised eyebrows.
KNEES, KNEES. KNEES
Schwartz announced yesterday |
that the Seattle-incurred trick knees
of Wes Poulson, Dick Abraham, and
Russ Pomeroy would definitely
sideline all three of these top per
lVi mers as far as the Beaver battle
is concerned.
In addition, the status of Rupe
Andrews and Dave Field is still in
question. Andrews injured his back
against the Huskies, while defensive
ace Field has both a bad cold and
sore back to hamper his activities. I
The Beavers, on the other hand,
should be at their best. The flu bu'j
j which sent 12 of the squad to the in
firmary prior to their 41-0 shel-
I lacking by Cal. has finally been ex
pelled, and their injury list is at
the lowest ebb of the year.
TOP LEAGUE BACK
The northerners will be sparked
in their fifth Conference start by
handyman Ken Carpenter, a twist
ing scatback * who leads all other
[ league ball-toters in the important |
matters of running and passing
j yardage.
Carpenter is a fourth-year per
former at halfback for the Staters,
and his play in his final season has
: prompted many an expert to pro- j
claim him the outstanding back on
the .Coast. a
The Beavers' other offensive stars ,
include Dick Twenge, another
three-time monogram winner who
j does a lot of spinning from Tay
lor's Michigan single-wing system;
Bill ShefTold, shifty Bend, Ore.,
sophomore and Carpenter's running
mate at half; quarterback Gene
Morrow, also a soph currently being
j hailed as the greatest passing possi
bility in the school's history: and
pass-catching end. Don Niblett. one
ot the team's high scorers.
NEW RECORD
The Beavers will tackle the In-
I dians fresh from the highest scoring
victory ever to enter the record
books of the Corvallis institution.
Carpenter was the hero of the rec
, ord-smashing t>3 to 14 rout of the
Montana Grizzlies last week.
In grinding the Grizzly, the Tay
-1 lormen tallied their second victory
of a busy league season. They've
also lost two, the opener to UCLA
by 35 to 13 and the other to the
j Golden Bears.
The Indians' opening offensive
, unit will find three changes from
the lineup that has started most of
I the season's games.
Schwartz's major strategic move,
occasioned by the dangerous weak -
i cning of the tackle slots due to in
juries. will send Al Laakso to the
I starting gate at the offensive left
■ end position to allow Bill McColl to
' | take over the defensive right tackle
j slot.
According to Schwartz, this move
. was prompted by McColl himself;
and the Farm headman expects the
big end to give a fine account of
himself at his new position.
"Bill is aggressive and strong
; enough to make up for his lack of
training at tackle," Schwartz said.
MORE CHANGES
Schwartz also released the infor
: ; mation that Bob Latham, a 200-
' j pounder who started the year with
lithe .Tayvce squad, will understudy
McColl tomorrow.

Other changes in the Farm per
sonnel will find Dick Lucas at left
'>uard and Boyd Benson at ri,'hl
half at the opening whistle.
Gary Kerkorian will open at
quarterback, but Schwartz says thai
j Dick Horn and Tom Shaw will see
some action, "if the complexion of
the game warrants it." The Indian
mentor made it clear, however, thai
passing Gary is his No. 1 quarter
back right now.
Ken Rose will open at the right
wing opposite Laakso, Gorily White
and Al Rau will be at the tackles.
1 Don Fix joins Lucas at guard, and
captain Jim Castagnoli will be al
! center.
All of these men are in top physi
i cal condition, with the exception of
Rau, whose efficiency is still ham
pered by an early-season rib-crack
ing.
I That word "knee" figures entirely
too prominently in Stanford grid
discussions.
Starting lineups should be as fol
lows:

The northerners will be sparked
in their fifth Conference start by
handyman Ken Carpenter, a twist
ing scatback * who leads all other
[ league ball-toters in the important |
matters of running and passing
j yardage.
Carpenter is a fourth-year per
former at halfback for the Staters,
and his play in his final season has
: prompted many an expert to pro- j
claim him the outstanding back on
the .Coast. a
The Beavers' other offensive stars ,
include Dick Twenge, another
three-time monogram winner who
j does a lot of spinning from Tay
lor's Michigan single-wing system;
Bill ShefTold, shifty Bend, Ore.,
sophomore and Carpenter's running
mate at half; quarterback Gene
Morrow, also a soph currently being
j hailed as the greatest passing possi
bility in the school's history: and
pass-catching end. Don Niblett. one
ot the team's high scorers.
NEW RECORD
The Beavers will tackle the In-
I dians fresh from the highest scoring
victory ever to enter the record
books of the Corvallis institution.
Carpenter was the hero of the rec
, ord-smashing t>3 to 14 rout of the
Montana Grizzlies last week.
In grinding the Grizzly, the Tay
-1 lormen tallied their second victory
of a busy league season. They've
also lost two, the opener to UCLA
by 35 to 13 and the other to the
j Golden Bears.
The Indians' opening offensive
, unit will find three changes from
the lineup that has started most of
I the season's games.
Schwartz's major strategic move,
occasioned by the dangerous weak -
i cning of the tackle slots due to in
juries. will send Al Laakso to the
I starting gate at the offensive left
■ end position to allow Bill McColl to
' | take over the defensive right tackle
j slot.
According to Schwartz, this move
. was prompted by McColl himself;
and the Farm headman expects the
big end to give a fine account of
himself at his new position.
"Bill is aggressive and strong
; enough to make up for his lack of
training at tackle," Schwartz said.
MORE CHANGES
Schwartz also released the infor
: ; mation that Bob Latham, a 200-
' j pounder who started the year with
lithe .Tayvce squad, will understudy
McColl tomorrow.

Other changes in the Farm per
sonnel will find Dick Lucas at left
'>uard and Boyd Benson at ri,'hl
half at the opening whistle.
Gary Kerkorian will open at
quarterback, but Schwartz says thai
j Dick Horn and Tom Shaw will see
some action, "if the complexion of
the game warrants it." The Indian
mentor made it clear, however, thai
passing Gary is his No. 1 quarter
back right now.
Ken Rose will open at the right
wing opposite Laakso, Gorily White
and Al Rau will be at the tackles.
1 Don Fix joins Lucas at guard, and
captain Jim Castagnoli will be al
! center.
All of these men are in top physi
i cal condition, with the exception of
Rau, whose efficiency is still ham
pered by an early-season rib-crack
ing.

, ord-smashing t>3 to 14 rout of the
Montana Grizzlies last week.
In grinding the Grizzly, the Tay
-1 lormen tallied their second victory
of a busy league season. They've
also lost two, the opener to UCLA
by 35 to 13 and the other to the
j Golden Bears.
The Indians' opening offensive
, unit will find three changes from
the lineup that has started most of
I the season's games.
Schwartz's major strategic move,
occasioned by the dangerous weak -
i cning of the tackle slots due to in
juries. will send Al Laakso to the
I starting gate at the offensive left
■ end position to allow Bill McColl to
' | take over the defensive right tackle
j slot.
According to Schwartz, this move
. was prompted by McColl himself;
and the Farm headman expects the
big end to give a fine account of
himself at his new position.
"Bill is aggressive and strong
; enough to make up for his lack of
training at tackle," Schwartz said.
MORE CHANGES
Schwartz also released the infor
: ; mation that Bob Latham, a 200-
' j pounder who started the year with
lithe .Tayvce squad, will understudy
McColl tomorrow.

Other changes in the Farm per
sonnel will find Dick Lucas at left
'>uard and Boyd Benson at ri,'hl
half at the opening whistle.
Gary Kerkorian will open at
quarterback, but Schwartz says thai
j Dick Horn and Tom Shaw will see
some action, "if the complexion of
the game warrants it." The Indian
mentor made it clear, however, thai
passing Gary is his No. 1 quarter
back right now.
Ken Rose will open at the right
wing opposite Laakso, Gorily White
and Al Rau will be at the tackles.
1 Don Fix joins Lucas at guard, and
captain Jim Castagnoli will be al
! center.
All of these men are in top physi
i cal condition, with the exception of
Rau, whose efficiency is still ham
pered by an early-season rib-crack
ing.
I That word "knee" figures entirely
too prominently in Stanford grid
discussions.

Stanford's up-and-down Indian grid machine will find itself in the unfamiliar and unwanted
role of heavy favorite tomorrow when Oregon State headman "Kip" Taylor escorts his orange
shirted charges onto the Stadium turf for a 2:30 Conference appointment with the Redmen.
The Indians are pegged 20 points better than the northern invaders by the national form book.
And while such odds are apt to cause any coach at least a touch of uneasiness, Marchie

rSchwartz has particular reason fori
eyeing tomorrow's predictions with
.- lightly raised eyebrows.
KNEES, KNEES. KNEES
Schwartz announced yesterday |
that the Seattle-incurred trick knees
of Wes Poulson, Dick Abraham, and
Russ Pomeroy would definitely
sideline all three of these top per
lVi mers as far as the Beaver battle
is concerned.
In addition, the status of Rupe
Andrews and Dave Field is still in
question. Andrews injured his back
against the Huskies, while defensive
ace Field has both a bad cold and
sore back to hamper his activities. I
The Beavers, on the other hand,
should be at their best. The flu bu'j
j which sent 12 of the squad to the in
firmary prior to their 41-0 shel-
I lacking by Cal. has finally been ex
pelled, and their injury list is at
the lowest ebb of the year.
TOP LEAGUE BACK
The northerners will be sparked
in their fifth Conference start by
handyman Ken Carpenter, a twist
ing scatback * who leads all other
[ league ball-toters in the important |
matters of running and passing
j yardage.
Carpenter is a fourth-year per
former at halfback for the Staters,
and his play in his final season has
: prompted many an expert to pro- j
claim him the outstanding back on
the .Coast. a
The Beavers' other offensive stars ,
include Dick Twenge, another
three-time monogram winner who
j does a lot of spinning from Tay
lor's Michigan single-wing system;
Bill ShefTold, shifty Bend, Ore.,
sophomore and Carpenter's running
mate at half; quarterback Gene
Morrow, also a soph currently being
j hailed as the greatest passing possi
bility in the school's history: and
pass-catching end. Don Niblett. one
ot the team's high scorers.
NEW RECORD
The Beavers will tackle the In-
I dians fresh from the highest scoring
victory ever to enter the record
books of the Corvallis institution.
