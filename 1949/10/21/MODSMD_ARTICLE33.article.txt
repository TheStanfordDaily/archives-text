# Winbigler Clues Queue Custom Under New Reg Line System
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
| The principle of queuing is as old
as history, nay, older.
For example, a recent Russian ex
pedition in eastern Georgia turned
up a faded cave-drawing of a pre
historic man dragging a lady gorilla
! ;nto a cleft in the rocks. To one
i side, three friends of the family
are standing in a row, expectantly
i looking on. Here, states the expe
ditions report, is clearly the first
j case of a line.
For centuries, armies have loved,
fought, died, and queued.
Today, we queue for football tick
ets, meals, books, and coffee. The
line, even here at Stanford, is as
traditional as the "Ladies' Public
Retiring Room."
All this is by way of preface to
; commemoration of a Stanford queue
that is rapidly receding into the past.
We mean the reg lines.
Prior to the war, registration was
an all-day, bring-your-lunch busi
; ness. It began outside the old Ad
i ministration Building, sometime
after midnight, and involved special
trips for seat cards, to the health
I service, the P.E. Department, the
fees office, back to the Administra
i tion Building, and, if you chose, to
the Frost Amphitheater to drop dead
j out of the way of things. This sys
tem existed before and during the
: war.
In 1940, however, the first wave
of returning vets hit Stanford like
a herd of friendly rhinoceri. Added
t to this was a total registration of
7,000, and the old system sagged
like a Cellar sandwich. They still
tell of a line, one end of which was
I stomping hell out of the potted
plants in the lobby of the Ad Build
j ing; the other end, cheering a pre
| season crew workout in the Palo
■ Alto Yacht Harbor.
By 11)47, a new system was in the
planning. The alphabetical system

was trotted out along more realistic
lines; pre-reg was sot up. The Pa
vilion and auditorium were pressed
into service. The system was gradu
ally centralized and the lines began
to vanish.
Key man in this revamped regis
tration system is A. Donald Win
bigler, Stanford's registrar. Mr.
Winbigler, an even-tempered, busi
nesslike fellow, has been at Stan
ford since 19*10, has been registrar
since 1945. His duties, aside from
registration, involve editing the
Buwloul, drying freshman tears, and
planning new and better systems of
registration. From his office, 810 of
the Temporary Building behind the
Education Building, he gazes out on
tnc Hoover Tower and contemplates
such radical innovations as a com
plete pre-registiation set-up, a fast
er moving set of registrations sta
tions, and, who knows?—perhaps
registration by telepathy.
Perhaps he could offer some ex
pert advice to the Bookstore!

Key man in this revamped regis
tration system is A. Donald Win
bigler, Stanford's registrar. Mr.
Winbigler, an even-tempered, busi
nesslike fellow, has been at Stan
ford since 19*10, has been registrar
since 1945. His duties, aside from
registration, involve editing the
Buwloul, drying freshman tears, and
planning new and better systems of
registration. From his office, 810 of
the Temporary Building behind the
Education Building, he gazes out on
tnc Hoover Tower and contemplates
such radical innovations as a com
plete pre-registiation set-up, a fast
er moving set of registrations sta
tions, and, who knows?—perhaps
registration by telepathy.
Perhaps he could offer some ex
pert advice to the Bookstore!
| The principle of queuing is as old
as history, nay, older.
For example, a recent Russian ex
pedition in eastern Georgia turned
up a faded cave-drawing of a pre
historic man dragging a lady gorilla
! ;nto a cleft in the rocks. To one
i side, three friends of the family
are standing in a row, expectantly
i looking on. Here, states the expe
ditions report, is clearly the first
j case of a line.
For centuries, armies have loved,
fought, died, and queued.
Today, we queue for football tick
ets, meals, books, and coffee. The
line, even here at Stanford, is as
traditional as the "Ladies' Public
Retiring Room."
All this is by way of preface to
; commemoration of a Stanford queue
that is rapidly receding into the past.
We mean the reg lines.
Prior to the war, registration was
an all-day, bring-your-lunch busi
; ness. It began outside the old Ad
i ministration Building, sometime
after midnight, and involved special
trips for seat cards, to the health
I service, the P.E. Department, the
fees office, back to the Administra
i tion Building, and, if you chose, to
the Frost Amphitheater to drop dead
j out of the way of things. This sys
tem existed before and during the
: war.
In 1940, however, the first wave
of returning vets hit Stanford like
a herd of friendly rhinoceri. Added
t to this was a total registration of
7,000, and the old system sagged
like a Cellar sandwich. They still
tell of a line, one end of which was
I stomping hell out of the potted
plants in the lobby of the Ad Build
j ing; the other end, cheering a pre
| season crew workout in the Palo
■ Alto Yacht Harbor.
By 11)47, a new system was in the
planning. The alphabetical system

was trotted out along more realistic
lines; pre-reg was sot up. The Pa
vilion and auditorium were pressed
into service. The system was gradu
ally centralized and the lines began
to vanish.
