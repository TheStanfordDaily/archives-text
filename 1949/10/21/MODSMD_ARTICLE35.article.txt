# PANIC I SAN ANGELO
## Farm's Own Polio Unit Meets Texas Emergency 
### JAN HANSON 
The town of San Angelo, Texas,
was bordering on panic. It was early
last June, the month when polio
is usually just beginning to appear;
but' San Angelo, with a population
of 30,000, already had 80 cases.
A wire from the county medical
| society brought the Stanford Polio
j Unit to the scene. From the 13th
l to the lßth of June, the unit worked
j with the local medical personnel,
j examining patients and discussing
j problems relating to acute and con
j valeseent care.
In the case of San Angelo, the
1 problem was mainly one of expand
ing the existing facilities and bring
ing in badly needed nurses and
physical therapists, as the city al
ready had excellent hospitals, cap
able doctors, and a highly organized
physical therapy department.
; But the very presence of the unit
; had a reassuring effect on the morale
| of the city. The frightened towns-
I people realized things were in cap
j able hands and that everything pos
| sible was being done.
I The Stanford Polio Unit is one of
j four such groups in the United
| States, all of which are sponsored
| and financed by the National Foun
! dation for Infantile Paralysis. The
! other three are at Harvard, North
western, and the University of Pitts
| burgh. A unit is usually composed
j of a medical director, a physical
| therapist, and an orthopedic nurse.
I The purpose of these units is to go
to epidemic areas and set up treat
| ment units, advising the local medi
j cal authorities on equipment, which
is fiown in by the National Foun
j dation, methods of treatment, and
j necessary personnel. Nurses are re-
I cruited and sent by the Red Cross,
and physical therapists by the
i American Physical Therapy Asso
ciation.
The units do not always find fa
cilities to work with that are as well
organized as those of San Angelo.
I Frequently, they have to organize
| complete hospitals, as was the case
j in North Carolina, where an old
■ army hospital was taken over and
rehabilitated.
Dr. William Northway, Assistant
; Dean of the Stanford Medical
| School, is the medical director of
j the Stanford group. Miss Lucille
j Daniels, head of the Stanford Physi
| cal Therapy Department, acts as
j physical therapist for the group,
j The trip to Texas this summer was
the first undertaken by the group
as a unit. However, members of
! the medical and physical therapy
! departments have frequently been
called into afflicted areas in the past.

I A giant from the National Foun
dation keeps the unit active and
! makes it possible for the Physical
j Therapy Department to keep an ex
; tra therapist on the staff to be avail
| able for emergency calls. They also
! finance a three-day course for phy
! sicians that is held once a year at
'■ I lie Stanford School of Medicine in
San Francisco.
These polio units are primarily
j teaching units. As a whole, the
! United States is becoming so well
| informed on the subject of polio that
| need for such units is decreasing.
