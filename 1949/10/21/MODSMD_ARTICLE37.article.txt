Stanford's rally banner, as usual, is among
the missing.
A telegram from UCLA's homecoming chair
man to ASSU President Hank Rosin reveals
that Stanford's cardinal and white bunting is
in the possession of the Bruin Homecoming
Committee, and the Uclans are anxious to re
'.urn it "in trade" for a UCLA Homecoming
Banner that Stanford students supposedly
made off with last year. The wire reads as
follows: •
HANK ROSIN, PRESIDENT ASSU:
WE HAVE A STANFORD BANNER IN OUR
POSSESSION AND DEFINITE INFORMA
TION THAT UCLA HOMECOMING FLAG IS
HELD BY DEKES ON YOUR CAMPUS STOP
I AM AUTHORIZED TO ARRANGE TRADE
MUST BE DONE BEFORE OCTOBER 21 STOP

As a suggestion, the UCLA Homecoming
Committee might have done well to look
rDund its own neighborhood before author

izing the retaliation snitching of the Stanford
banner.
The Daily has "definite information" that
the UCLA Homecoming Banner may now be
found somewhere around Los Angeles, and
would not be at all iurprised if it were to turn
up at the UCLA-USC game. As for our own
banner, we want it back.
And while we're on the subject we might
ask just how UCLA got our banner so easily?
Ever since the days when the immortal 21
risked life and limb to recover the Axe, Stan
ford has been an easy push for kleptomaniacs
from rival campuses.
Exact details of the latest larceny remain
clouded. Rumors have it that the bunting was
stolen from its hiding place in the Rally Com
office, but others say that it disappeared after
the UCLA Rally in Frost Amphitheater. The
only sure thing is that it's gone and UCLA
has it.
We might make an appeal that more care be
taken in the future to safeguard our valued
possessions, but such appeals made before
have always fallen on deaf ears.

God the Hoover Tower is nailed down."
