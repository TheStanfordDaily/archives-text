Bull Session
To the Editor:
What was the purpose behind Thursday's "Bull
Session?" To amuse or to try and stir Rally Com
into greater efficiency? Whatever it was, I'd say
it failed.
An article like that rarely does much good, nor
do I think it's appreciated too much. What do you
say we say something nice about somebody? It:
leaves a better taste in the mouth than does the type
of criticism Rally Com received.
Also, what say we clean up the language and the
jokes a bit?
