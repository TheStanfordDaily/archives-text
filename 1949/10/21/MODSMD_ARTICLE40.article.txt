# Sunday Evening Culture

To the Editor:
Being an alumnus does not predicate my losing un
interest in campus affairs. Rather, it permits a more
objective view with an unharried mind. I have two
questions that have come to my mind recently, and
I should iike to ask them.
First: although Stanford students are capable of
assimilating a large volume of culture in a short
period of time, how can they be expected to do it
whtn it requires their being in two places at once?
I refer to the Concert Series presentation of Mme.
Albanese this Sunday evening, when Dr. Johnston
informs us that wc are to have a speaker of unusually
high caliber, Mis. Gladys Walser, for Sunday evening
vespers. It appears from the reports that the Con
cert Series directors have made arrangements with

the Sunday Evening Movies chairman —why didn't
they consult the Chapel Board or one of the chap
lains? Or did they perhaps feel that those who attend
the vespers are hyper-emotional introverts who
would not be interested in grand opera?
Second: is the student body as a whole aware that
the living expenses of the foreign students among
us have been reduced to an inadequate minimum? I
don't mean to infer that these student-ambassadors
should be handed everything on a silver platter and
not have to work a little on the side for spending
money. But the joker is that they arc forbidden by
federal law to work, and may only do it under emer
gency circumstances. May I respectfully request
that this matter be investigated by a committee of
responsible students who are concerned about the
impressions of America that our foreign friends will
take home along with their degrees.
Remember that Stanford's actions arc jealously
followed by a greater number of people outside the
University than within its tiled arcades. To them it
is a single, living organism, occasionally mature, but
more often adolescent.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM W. HUNT, '-19
(Editor's Note: Mine. Alhanesc was originally
scheduled to appear here on a week night, but a
hitch in her tour schedule made it necessary that
she appear at Stanford this Sunday night or not at
all. Arrangements were made with the Sunday
Evening Movies chairman because both the con
cert and the movie were scheduled to he held at
the same place—Memorial Auditorium.)

money. But the joker is that they arc forbidden by
federal law to work, and may only do it under emer
gency circumstances. May I respectfully request
that this matter be investigated by a committee of
responsible students who are concerned about the
impressions of America that our foreign friends will
take home along with their degrees.
Remember that Stanford's actions arc jealously
followed by a greater number of people outside the
University than within its tiled arcades. To them it
is a single, living organism, occasionally mature, but
more often adolescent.

To the Editor:
Being an alumnus does not predicate my losing un
interest in campus affairs. Rather, it permits a more
objective view with an unharried mind. I have two
questions that have come to my mind recently, and
I should iike to ask them.
First: although Stanford students are capable of
assimilating a large volume of culture in a short
period of time, how can they be expected to do it
whtn it requires their being in two places at once?
I refer to the Concert Series presentation of Mme.
Albanese this Sunday evening, when Dr. Johnston
informs us that wc are to have a speaker of unusually
high caliber, Mis. Gladys Walser, for Sunday evening
vespers. It appears from the reports that the Con
cert Series directors have made arrangements with

the Sunday Evening Movies chairman —why didn't
they consult the Chapel Board or one of the chap
lains? Or did they perhaps feel that those who attend
the vespers are hyper-emotional introverts who
would not be interested in grand opera?
Second: is the student body as a whole aware that
the living expenses of the foreign students among
us have been reduced to an inadequate minimum? I
don't mean to infer that these student-ambassadors
should be handed everything on a silver platter and
not have to work a little on the side for spending
money. But the joker is that they arc forbidden by
federal law to work, and may only do it under emer
gency circumstances. May I respectfully request
that this matter be investigated by a committee of
responsible students who are concerned about the
impressions of America that our foreign friends will
take home along with their degrees.
