# S.F. Is Opium Clearing House

Every now and then news
items appear in the local press
reporting the capture of some
"notorious dope peddler" in
San Francisco. It is only natural
o find that San Francisco is the
learing house for opium com

o .e ior opium co ning into Amer
ica, so the British Colony of Hong
Kong is an entrepot for the inter
national opium smuggling racket in
the Far East. Ships and planes visit
Hong Kong daily from all parts of
the world, and many of them have
on board an illicit cargo of opium,
A proportion of the contraband is
consumed locally in the thousands
of opium divans which are tound ail
over the Colony. The divans flourish
in spite of strenuous attempts by the
authorities to suppress them. A di
van may be raided, but that same
divan will he in business again
within two or three hours of the
raid.
Funning opium divans is a lucra
tive business, tfnd prosecution of
their keepers is almost a daily fea
ture. of Hong Kong's police courts.

I People from all walks of life appear
j endlessly before magistrates for
"smoking.''
For a Hong Kong dollar, you can
purchase a small pot of opium in a
divan. Such a pot gives about four
pipefuls, and an average smoker re
quires about three pots per day. Be
cause of the large number of ad
dicts sent to prison, medical offi
cers there are permitted to admin
ister opium to convicts who cannot
o without the drug. They are given
"um dross in reducing doses with

The conflict in Chirta has caused
a number of high-class northern di

The bettor grade opium from India
is prepared and packed in small tins
for export to the United States. Fac
tories for manufacturing such ex
ports are very difficult to detect and
it is not easy for the authorities to
get at them. Such factories have
hidden cavities for hiding the opium
and the manufacturing implements
in case of raids. Few of them have
ever been successfully raided.
The preparation of the drug is
imple. The raw opium is boiled in
water and the scum which rises to
the surface is skimmed off with a
eather. The scum is then cither
ut into small pots ready for smok
ing in the local divans or sealed in
tins for export.
One recent attempt to smuggle
out an American-bound consign
ment of prepared opium was nipped
in the bud by the revenue depart
ment. The haul was packed in sev
eral hundred small tins, all properly
trademarked.
Hardly any poppies are grown lo
cally in that Isle of Fragrant
Streams, because the soil will yield
more profit from vegetables. How
ever, about a year ago, the au
thorities discovered the first case of
poppies being grown in the Colony.
Then, much to their disgust., they
found that there was no regulation
forbidding the growth of that plant.
A law was rushed through the legis
lature and since then only one other
case has been discovered on one of
the outlying islands.
