# SIRO Help Brings Hope To Needy Students Abroad
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Stanford International Relief Or
j ganization, better known as SIRO.
has for two years been spreading
good will and making the name of
Stanford known throughout the
world.
Organized formally as a comrpit
tee of the Institute of International
Relations, SIRO includes all Farm
students who help with Stanford re
i lief work for students of other na
j tions.
The main purpose of the organ
| ization, as put by Chairman Pat
Terry, is "Supplying student needs
{abroad."
j A portion of the funds collected
j in the annual SIRO drive is sent to
IWSSF (World Student Service
I Fund) and to the UN Appeal for
j Children. These organizations can
I use the money in such things as
! building rest centers or rebuilding
| schools and universities.
But most Stanford student "need
filling" is done directly. Students
traveling abroad in the summer and
persons who have recently lived in
foreign nations offer suggestions as
j to where goods should be sent.
It was in this way that Farm stu
| dents learned last year of the plight
|of the Free University of Berlin.
! SIRO then sent a large consignment

of books, clothes, and school sup
plies by air lift to the university.
There is a personal touch in
SIRO's work. Two years ago Stan
ford "adopted" the University of Na
ples and sent many supplies and
the funds with which to buy books
from Stanford students to the stu
dents at Naples. The University of
Naples Library has since been
named the Stanford Library in ap
preciation of this gesture.
But the personal touch goes fur
ther. Besides helping war-torn and
new universities and sending clothes
or other supplies to students and
families, SIRO tries to keep up a
personal correspondence with as
many foreign students as possible.
At the SIRO desk in the lIR of
fice is a large file of names of stu
dents of other countries. With the
names are listed the country, the
student's age and sex, and some of
the person's interests.
Anyboy who wants to correspond
with a student abroad may drop in
and look over the list. Often Farm
students have met their "pen and
ink friends" when traveling later.
Bill Haydcn, former Stanford stu
dent studying in Europe on a Ro
tary Scholarship this year, met
some people who knew of SIRO
through clothes sent them. He said
in a letter to friends on campus:
"You might tell SIRO that I've
met people who are wearing clothes
we sent to them. They certainly are
grateful for our help."
The work of college relief organ
izations is a factor in the way other
nations feel about the United States.
Says Macario Ruiz, Dean of Stu
dents at Lopez Jaena University in
the Philippines:
"Others say you , Americans are
imperialists, but that is not quite
true. If imperialism means extend
ing help to those who are needy,
if imperialism means spreading the
principles of Christianity, if imper
ialism means clothes for our bodies,
books for our libraries, renewed
hope in our hearts, then let you
be imperialistic."
