# Oregon Slate Boasts Veteran Team
## Beavers Had Early Season Trouble With New Formation; Ready Now 
### AL BERRY 
Coaches are prone to moan more than they are to dream, and
Indian backfield mentor Ray Hammett is no exception. "Oregon
State," says the genial coach, "is a very good football team."
And a quick glance at the OSC situation seems to verify his
suspicions.
The Beavers, who had trouble getting adjusted to Kip Taylor's

new style of play, seem finally to
have found themselves. They beat
Washington, before demoralization
set in at Seattle, 7-3, and to prove
that this was no fluke, they tram
pled poor old Montana with a GO
- spiee. Sixty points,
as any coach will tell you. is a lot
of points to make -even if you're
! running against blocking dummies.
For those who like statistics,
Washington completely overran the
Beavers in every department but
the total points scored, except for
punting. GSC averaged a nitty 40.!

game, as far as staticties go. They
made five more first downs thai,
the Grizzlies. They made six times
the yardage on the ground that
i Montana was able to muster, and
J made a hundred or so more total
j yards than their opponents.
The Beavers also looked good in
the passing department last Satur
day. They completed 11 out of 10
passes and intercepted five of Mon
tana's aerial efforts.
Going down the roster, man for
man, also shows the lads from Ore
gon to be very able contenders.
Ifalihacks—First and foremost is
Ken Carpenter, a 190-pound, six
foot senior, who is unquestionably
one of the best backs on the Coast,
and probably in the country. Car-
I penter does everything well, and
plays most of the game on both
offense and defense. This is his
fourth year of varsity football for
the Staters, and he celebrated it
j last week by running two Mon
j tana punts back for the treasured
j six points. Carpenter is also a good
j passer, a fine blocker, and a great
j kicker.
Dick Gray, at right halfback of
Kip Taylor's single wing, is also a
j four-year letteiman and is an ex
, tremely good reversing back, but is
j overshadowed somewhat in promi
j nence by the powerful man at left
halfback.
Fuflhaik—Dick Twenge is another
veteran who is playing his fourth
1 year at Oregon State. He weigh;
190 pounds, is a senior, and passes
, svell irom the spinning fullback spot.

| Gene Morrow, a sparkling 175-
pound, G-foot-2 sophomore from Hu
: Dalles. Morow gives promise of be
ng the best passer in Oregon
State's illustrious history. He is a

and an excellent blocker o.T of the
i single wing.
Center—Al Gray, a 21-year-old
junior, is a one-year letterman.

IfcO pounds. While not the best piv

Guards—OSC's best guard is team
j captain Tom De Silvia, who is also
I a four-year lettei man—with all four
j years on OSC's first string. De Silvia
• is a Butte, Montana, boy—aged 25
I—and weighs 215 on a 5-foot, 11-
ineh frame. The Beavers' other
| guard is Ed Carmichael, a 210-
pound, (i-foot, 2-inch senior from
(Modesto, California, who will be

j the hometown folks what he has
; learned in the northern institution.
Also playing (he guard spot will
! be Don Zarosinski, a scrappy little
1 170-pound sophomore who started

the Beavers their touchdown
drive against Washington by inter
cepting one of Don Henrich's fam
ous forward passes.
'tackles -Oregon State proudly
possesses three very excellent of
fensive tackles in OSC student body
president Jim Hanker, and veter
ans Jim Inglesby and Arvid Niemi.
Inglesby and Niemi seem to be cut
irom tiie same mold—both weigh
205, both stand 6 feet, 2 inches, both
are 23 years old, and both are one
year lettermen. The twins will
; robably get the stai ting nod over
the 212-pound Hanker.
I'.'nds—Right end Stan McGuire, in
addition to being an excellent pass
recciver, is al.su OSC's placekieker
and kickoff man. He is a two-year
letterman, weighs 192 pounds and
is a junior. The left end is Crait
McMickin, a 6-foot, 1-inch, 185-
ijound senior from Chehalis, Wash
ington. McMickin is a good tackier,
and excels on defense, but is also a
better-than-average offensive end.
That's the run down. An inter
pretation of the facts leads us to one
large conclusion. Oregan State i
not the best team west ol Minne
apolis, but they can be a dangerous
spoiler. Win or lose the Beavers
have the reputation of giving any
and all opponents 60. minutes ol
clean but rough, rugged football.
The Stanford game—which the sin
glewingers want to win very badly
—will be no exception.
As Ray Hamrnett put it: "We
ihould win, but it will be tough.
The guys have got to do a lot more
than simply go out and throw their
helmc-ts on the field."

possesses three very excellent of
fensive tackles in OSC student body
president Jim Hanker, and veter

Inglesby and Niemi seem to be cut

and kickoff man. He is a two-year
letterman, weighs 192 pounds and
is a junior. The left end is Crait
McMickin, a 6-foot, 1-inch, 185-
ijound senior from Chehalis, Wash
ington. McMickin is a good tackier,
and excels on defense, but is also a
better-than-average offensive end.
That's the run down. An inter
pretation of the facts leads us to one
large conclusion. Oregan State i
not the best team west ol Minne
apolis, but they can be a dangerous
spoiler. Win or lose the Beavers
have the reputation of giving any
and all opponents 60. minutes ol
clean but rough, rugged football.
The Stanford game—which the sin
glewingers want to win very badly
—will be no exception.
As Ray Hamrnett put it: "We
ihould win, but it will be tough.
The guys have got to do a lot more
than simply go out and throw their
helmc-ts on the field."

Coaches are prone to moan more than they are to dream, and
Indian backfield mentor Ray Hammett is no exception. "Oregon
State," says the genial coach, "is a very good football team."
And a quick glance at the OSC situation seems to verify his
suspicions.
The Beavers, who had trouble getting adjusted to Kip Taylor's

new style of play, seem finally to
have found themselves. They beat
Washington, before demoralization
set in at Seattle, 7-3, and to prove
that this was no fluke, they tram
pled poor old Montana with a GO
- spiee. Sixty points,
as any coach will tell you. is a lot
of points to make -even if you're
! running against blocking dummies.
For those who like statistics,
Washington completely overran the
Beavers in every department but
the total points scored, except for
punting. GSC averaged a nitty 40.!

kept Washington from getting int.

game, as far as staticties go. They
made five more first downs thai,
the Grizzlies. They made six times
the yardage on the ground that
i Montana was able to muster, and
J made a hundred or so more total
j yards than their opponents.
The Beavers also looked good in
the passing department last Satur
day. They completed 11 out of 10
passes and intercepted five of Mon
tana's aerial efforts.
Going down the roster, man for
man, also shows the lads from Ore
gon to be very able contenders.
Ifalihacks—First and foremost is
Ken Carpenter, a 190-pound, six
foot senior, who is unquestionably
one of the best backs on the Coast,
and probably in the country. Car-
I penter does everything well, and
plays most of the game on both
offense and defense. This is his
fourth year of varsity football for
the Staters, and he celebrated it
j last week by running two Mon
j tana punts back for the treasured
j six points. Carpenter is also a good
j passer, a fine blocker, and a great
j kicker.
Dick Gray, at right halfback of
Kip Taylor's single wing, is also a
j four-year letteiman and is an ex
, tremely good reversing back, but is
j overshadowed somewhat in promi
j nence by the powerful man at left
halfback.
Fuflhaik—Dick Twenge is another
veteran who is playing his fourth
1 year at Oregon State. He weigh;
190 pounds, is a senior, and passes
, svell irom the spinning fullback spot.
: Except for Carpenter, Twenge is
JSCs top offensive threat. Depth
is added to this spot by Andy Knud
j sen, a 195-pound Eureka, California.

football under his canvas belt.
Quartet liack — Again, t Stanford,
| Coach Taylor will probably start
| Gene Morrow, a sparkling 175-
pound, G-foot-2 sophomore from Hu
: Dalles. Morow gives promise of be
ng the best passer in Oregon
State's illustrious history. He is a
| very good T-formr tion quarterback
and an excellent blocker o.T of the
i single wing.
Center—Al Gray, a 21-year-old
junior, is a one-year letterman.

Guards—OSC's best guard is team
j captain Tom De Silvia, who is also
I a four-year lettei man—with all four
j years on OSC's first string. De Silvia
• is a Butte, Montana, boy—aged 25
I—and weighs 215 on a 5-foot, 11-
