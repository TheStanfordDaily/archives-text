WASHINGTON, Oct. L' 3 . (/P) — :
Britain and the United States are (
beginning to pull apart on the issue j
of recognizing the Communist gov- t
ernment of China.
Indications are that London may i
establish full diplomatic relations j
fairly soon.
Official Washington, on the other
hand, now regards recognition by j
the United States as months in the j
future.
Both the United States and Brit- i
ain use the same three-part measur- <
ing stick to determine whether or |
not any new government merits rcc- •
ognition. The standards are (1) how ,
much of its country's territory does I
it control; (2) how much popular j
support does it have; and (3) is it I
willing to shou'der the country's in- ;
ternational obligations?.
