# Dr. Brunetti Sees New Developments in Radio
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
The time is not far away when
students will be able to pack small
wire recorders to class and read the
morning paper while the little in
struments absorb the day's lecture.
However distracting this proced
ure may appear to the professor, it
is in prospect for students in the
not-too-distant future, according to
Dr. Cledo Brunctti, associate di
rector of the Stanford Research In
stitute.
DICK TKACY RADIO
Dr. Brunetti's efforts in devel
oping such an instrument through
SRI arc not an attempt to provoke
his associates. The small wire re
corder is only one of a string of
midget instruments being developed
in the field of electronics by the in
ventor of the "Dick Tracy" wrist
radio.
Among the fields in which the
inventions can be applied are
movies, aircraft, healing aid. radio,
and television. Dr. Brunctti sug
gested that doctors may someday
| keep track of their patients' health
by small radios attached to the body
to transmit pulse, breathing, and
heart beat.
CIIFAP AND RUGGEI)
The purpose of Dr. Brunetti's re
search is to find instruments which
arc small but rugged, cheap, and
serviceable. He met success along
this line during the war when he de
veloped the radio proximity fuse,
which explodes when it approaches
an object, and the radio-guided mis
sile.
The fuse was made possible
through the use of the painted wire,
! a fine thread of metal paint which
1 conduct > electricity as easily as a
copper wire.
Dr. Brunctti last Tuesday eve ning
gave his audience a formula for
making the paint sterling silver
I powder, linseed nil, und alcohol

mixed together and stenciled on the ,
instrument.
In 1941, Dr. Brunctti was cited j
the "Outstanding Young Electrical
Engineer of the United States." He
lived up to the honor by developing
the so-called, wrist radio, made
famous by Chester Gould in his
'Dick Tracy" strip.
DIME SIZI;
The size of a silver dollar, the
two-tube radio operates as an trans
mitter and a receiver. Dr. Brunctti
is now working on receivers that
range down to the size of a dime.
One of his larger ones, which can be
held in the fist, has been used to
make a eoast-to-coast broadcast.
The wire stenciling process is a
simple one, and fairly unskilled la
bor can easily produce 3,000 wiring
obs a day. Another important fea
ture of the midget radio is the use
of plasties. Many of Dr. Brunetti's
radios are solid oblongs of plastic
in which the wiring and parts have
been imbedded.
GIVEN TO HU MAN
One of the first of the small radio
models, a five-tube set the size of
a wallet, h.'S been presented to
President Truman, and the secret
crvice and White House staff use
similar ones while serving the Presi
dent.
For the intelligence service, Dr.
Brunctti has developed a broad
casting unit which fits into a cigaret
package and can broadcast 100 feet
without an antenna.
Dr. Brunctti predicts that moth
ers, wishing to play bridge next
door, will be able to attach re
ceiving units to the bald's crib to
tell him to go back to sleep when
he cries.
A similar device, he said, will per
mit late shoppers to turn off the
roast in the oven at home by remote
control.

students will be able to pack small

DICK TKACY RADIO
Dr. Brunetti's efforts in devel
oping such an instrument through
SRI arc not an attempt to provoke
his associates. The small wire re
corder is only one of a string of
midget instruments being developed
in the field of electronics by the in
ventor of the "Dick Tracy" wrist
radio.
Among the fields in which the
inventions can be applied are
movies, aircraft, healing aid. radio,
and television. Dr. Brunctti sug
gested that doctors may someday
| keep track of their patients' health
by small radios attached to the body
to transmit pulse, breathing, and
heart beat.
CIIFAP AND RUGGEI)
The purpose of Dr. Brunetti's re
search is to find instruments which
arc small but rugged, cheap, and
serviceable. He met success along
this line during the war when he de
veloped the radio proximity fuse,
which explodes when it approaches
an object, and the radio-guided mis
sile.
The fuse was made possible
through the use of the painted wire,
! a fine thread of metal paint which
1 conduct > electricity as easily as a
copper wire.
Dr. Brunctti last Tuesday eve ning
gave his audience a formula for
making the paint sterling silver
I powder, linseed nil, und alcohol

mixed together and stenciled on the ,
instrument.
In 1941, Dr. Brunctti was cited j
the "Outstanding Young Electrical
Engineer of the United States." He
lived up to the honor by developing
the so-called, wrist radio, made
famous by Chester Gould in his
'Dick Tracy" strip.
DIME SIZI;
The size of a silver dollar, the
two-tube radio operates as an trans
mitter and a receiver. Dr. Brunctti
is now working on receivers that
range down to the size of a dime.
One of his larger ones, which can be
held in the fist, has been used to
make a eoast-to-coast broadcast.
The wire stenciling process is a
simple one, and fairly unskilled la
bor can easily produce 3,000 wiring
obs a day. Another important fea
ture of the midget radio is the use
of plasties. Many of Dr. Brunetti's
radios are solid oblongs of plastic
in which the wiring and parts have
been imbedded.
GIVEN TO HU MAN
One of the first of the small radio
models, a five-tube set the size of
a wallet, h.'S been presented to
President Truman, and the secret
crvice and White House staff use
similar ones while serving the Presi
dent.
For the intelligence service, Dr.
Brunctti has developed a broad
casting unit which fits into a cigaret
package and can broadcast 100 feet
without an antenna.
Dr. Brunctti predicts that moth
ers, wishing to play bridge next
door, will be able to attach re
ceiving units to the bald's crib to
tell him to go back to sleep when
he cries.
