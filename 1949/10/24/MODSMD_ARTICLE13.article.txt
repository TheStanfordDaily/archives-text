# Albanese's Artistry Enthralls Audience
## 
### DIXIE BOOTH 
Dramatic singing and eye-catching glamour were combined
on the stage of Memorial Auditorium last evening with the re
cital of soprano Licia Albanese. It was the first Concert Series
presentation of the season.
The outstanding selections of the evening were four excerpts

'from operas with which she has be
come closcly identified.
In ''Ah, fors' e lui" and "Sempre
Libera" from Act I of "La Traviata"
by Verdi, Mme. Albanese, as Vio
letta, revealed the pure lyric colora
tura singing for which she is famed.
Her dramatic characterization dis
played remarkable power and con
trol, projected with ease in her na
tive Italian.
Mme. Albanese's top-ranking op
eratic ability was also convincingly
evident in "L'altra notte in fondo al
mar" from Act 111 of "Mefistofele"
by Boito. Her quick gestures, gasps
in the voice, and intense notes cre
ated the mood of demented Marghe
reta, who had killed both her child
and her bother.
Perhaps most representative of
Mme. Albanese's talent as a singing
actress were her two encores, the
aria from "Madame Butterfly" and
Miini's aria from "La Boheme." She
is. particularly familiar with the
leading role in Madame Butterfly,
having performed it for both her
Italian and her American operatic
debuts.
She has been called the most
beautiful and touching Mimi of mu
sical history, and most reasonably
so, in view of her rendition last
evening.
Her pieces throughout the entire
program were well received by an
appreciative audience that called
her back for bows after every num
ber,
Although Mme. Albanese seemed
to enjoy each and every piece, there
was a distinguishing quality about
her songs in Italian, especially
"Amarilli" by Caccini, "Sc Florindo
e fedcle" by Scarlatti, and the en
core, "Colombetta" by Puzzipczza.
The selections in French were no
tably light and coquettish, being
embellished with twinkling glances
Iby Mme. Albanese. Her French
| pieces were "Carnaval" by Four
j drain, "Clair de lune" by Szulc, and
! the popular "Les Fil!es dc Cadiz."
Remarkable change of pace and
j emotion was accomplished by Mme.
! Albanese in her songs in English.
| The passionate "In the Silence of
1 Night" by Rachmaninoff was fol-
I lowed by Tschaikovsky's tender
"Cradle Song" and the lusty "Floods
I of Spring" by Rachmaninoff.
Mme. Albanese also sang as en
cores "O mio bambino caro" by Puz
zipczza and "Star" by Richard Rog
ers.
