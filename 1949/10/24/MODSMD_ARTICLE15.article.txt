# Big Red Dams Beavers 27-7; Farm Plans for Homecoming
## Cards Never Really Put to Test By OSC Squad—Minus Big Ken 
### 
Twenty points, the bookmakers saic, and twenty points it
was.
Stanford beat the Orangemen from Oregon State College by
27 to 7 at the Stadium Saturday, just as they were supposed to do.
But coaches, players, and rooters alike were agreed that it

was hardly an impressive win.
There were some high spots for
the Card rooters, of course.
Like in the second quarter when
Bustling Boyd Benson picked a hole
through guard, cut to the right side
line behind Ken Rose's key block,
and raced 57 yards for the Indians'
longest scoring maneuver in many
u moon.
And that goal-to-goal drive at the
start of the second half, during
which Bud Klein forgot that he was
a third - string fullback and made
Hke an All-American.
But opportunities for uninhibited
cheering were denied the Card
rooting section for the major part
of the game, and the red side of the
ledger shows a much longer list of
entries.
BLOCKING WAS BAD
Blocking, as far as Stanford was
concerned, was almost non-existent
during the entire four quarters.
Twice in the opening period the
Farm attack bogged down within
the Staters' 10-yard line. Line play
in general was admittedly ragged.
But the biggest disappointment to
such fans as did turn out for the
battle was the disappearance of the
Beavers' highly touted Ken Car
penter after the first three plays of
the game.
Carpenter conceivably could have
made a whale of a difference in the
complexion of the contest. Ken is
the top back on the coast statisti
cally speaking;' and when he re
tired, the entire offensive burden
for the northern invaders was load
ed onto sophomores Jack Hoxie, Bill
Sheffold, and Gene Morrow.
OSC SOPHS KAGGEI)
Most obvious example of the sub
hall back's inexperience was his
bungling of a third-quarter kickoff,
when he almost never did decide
whether to run the ball or whether
the end zone offered more safety.
His indecision almost handed the
Indians two points right then.
As it turned out. it meant a touch
down for the Cards a few plays
later when Hoxie fumbled on the 14,
Bill DeYoung recovered, and Rupc
Andrews and Bob White parlayed
the break into a tally.
On the other hand, it was also
Hoxie who unleashed the long last
minute aerial that netted 80 yards
and allowed the Beavers to scoi-e
from the one - foot marker three
plays later.
STANFORD INJURIES
Stanford, 100, had its share of in
juries to hamper the cause. Russ
Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wcs
Poulson sat out the game in the

press box; and Bill DeYoung was
injured early and saw little action
the rest of the contest.
It is only fair, while noting that
Stanford did not perform like cham
pions, to record that the score could
have gone much higher than it did.
had Schwartz decided to confine his
attack to running plays.
But after three lightning - quick
tallies in the third quarter—made
rosvib'e by the Klein-sparked drive,
Bill DeYoung's recovery of the Hox
ie fumble 011 the Beaver 14-yard
line, and Jack Barnes' pass inter
ception and 18-yard run to the OSC
one - yard marker — Schwartz in
serted quarterback Dick Horn and
a host of other reserves with spe
cific instructions to practice their
passing game.
SO HORN PASSED
Even then, the Cards might have
have scored, had Horn's receivers
been more adept at hanging onto
some near-perfect tosses.
Soph wingman Wilbur Taylor
dropped one, for instance, that had
touchdown written all over it.
But additional scores were hardly
necessary, when all is said and done,
ind Marchie's sophomores will be
just that much better ofT for the
mistakes they made when they did
n't count.
Game-incurred injuries were at a
minimum for the Cards, trainer
Connie Jarvis staling that only the
condition of guard Dick Lucas is in
doubt, Lucas hurt his ankle late in
the battle, but the seriousness of his
injury will not be determined until
today.

BLOCKING WAS BAD
Blocking, as far as Stanford was
concerned, was almost non-existent
during the entire four quarters.
Twice in the opening period the
Farm attack bogged down within
the Staters' 10-yard line. Line play
in general was admittedly ragged.
But the biggest disappointment to
such fans as did turn out for the
battle was the disappearance of the
Beavers' highly touted Ken Car
penter after the first three plays of
the game.
Carpenter conceivably could have
made a whale of a difference in the
complexion of the contest. Ken is
the top back on the coast statisti
cally speaking;' and when he re
tired, the entire offensive burden
for the northern invaders was load
ed onto sophomores Jack Hoxie, Bill
Sheffold, and Gene Morrow.

Most obvious example of the sub
hall back's inexperience was his
bungling of a third-quarter kickoff,

As it turned out. it meant a touch
down for the Cards a few plays

Bill DeYoung recovered, and Rupc

for the northern invaders was load

Sheffold, and Gene Morrow.
OSC SOPHS KAGGEI)
Most obvious example of the sub
hall back's inexperience was his
bungling of a third-quarter kickoff,
when he almost never did decide
whether to run the ball or whether
the end zone offered more safety.
His indecision almost handed the
Indians two points right then.
As it turned out. it meant a touch
down for the Cards a few plays
later when Hoxie fumbled on the 14,
Bill DeYoung recovered, and Rupc
Andrews and Bob White parlayed
the break into a tally.
On the other hand, it was also
Hoxie who unleashed the long last
minute aerial that netted 80 yards
and allowed the Beavers to scoi-e
from the one - foot marker three
plays later.
STANFORD INJURIES
Stanford, 100, had its share of in
juries to hamper the cause. Russ
Pomeroy, Dick Abraham, and Wcs
Poulson sat out the game in the

press box; and Bill DeYoung was
injured early and saw little action
the rest of the contest.
It is only fair, while noting that
Stanford did not perform like cham
pions, to record that the score could
have gone much higher than it did.

SO HORN PASSED
Even then, the Cards might have
have scored, had Horn's receivers
been more adept at hanging onto
some near-perfect tosses.

dropped one, for instance, that had
touchdown written all over it.

Twenty points, the bookmakers saic, and twenty points it
was.
Stanford beat the Orangemen from Oregon State College by
27 to 7 at the Stadium Saturday, just as they were supposed to do.
But coaches, players, and rooters alike were agreed that it

was hardly an impressive win.
There were some high spots for
the Card rooters, of course.
Like in the second quarter when
Bustling Boyd Benson picked a hole
through guard, cut to the right side
line behind Ken Rose's key block,
and raced 57 yards for the Indians'
longest scoring maneuver in many
u moon.
And that goal-to-goal drive at the
start of the second half, during
which Bud Klein forgot that he was
a third - string fullback and made
Hke an All-American.
But opportunities for uninhibited
cheering were denied the Card
rooting section for the major part
of the game, and the red side of the
ledger shows a much longer list of
entries.
BLOCKING WAS BAD
Blocking, as far as Stanford was
concerned, was almost non-existent
during the entire four quarters.
Twice in the opening period the
Farm attack bogged down within
the Staters' 10-yard line. Line play
in general was admittedly ragged.
But the biggest disappointment to
such fans as did turn out for the
battle was the disappearance of the
Beavers' highly touted Ken Car
penter after the first three plays of
the game.
Carpenter conceivably could have
made a whale of a difference in the
complexion of the contest. Ken is
the top back on the coast statisti
cally speaking;' and when he re
tired, the entire offensive burden
for the northern invaders was load
ed onto sophomores Jack Hoxie, Bill
