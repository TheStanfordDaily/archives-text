# French Cabinet Crisis
## 
### 
PARIS â€” Georges Eidault, leader
of the middle-of-the-road Popular
Republicans (MRP), agreed tonight
to try to form ;i new French govern
ment. France has been locked in a
political crisis for 18 days, without a
cabinet.
Even among Bidault's colleagues
there is scant hope that he can suc
ceed, and the impasse might lead to
dissolution of Parliament and new
elections.
The situation seemed made to
order for Gen. Charles de Gaulle,
who long has been demanding new
elections to uive his own followers,
the French People's Rally (RPF), a
voice in the Assembly.
