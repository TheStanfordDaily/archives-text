Big Game Homecoming will center around the theme of "Stan
ford Tribe Pow-Wow" this year. For the first time in many years,
the Indian lore scheme will be used alone to carry out both float
parade and house decorations.

'groups must Rive noticc of their

fice from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from
1 to 5 p.m. tomorrow and Wednes
day.
Actual descriptions of the pro
posed decorations need not be mndc

"Stanford Tribe Pow-Wow" was
choscn for this year's theme because
it lends itself both to welcoming
back the alumni and visitors and to
depicting Stanford's intent to win
the Big Game, pointed out Home
coming Chairman Pete Slusscr.
PARADE ROUTE CHANGED
The float parade route has been
changed this year so that more peo
ple may witness the festivities and
floats may have larger dimensions.
The parade route will start from in
front of Encina on the Friday pre
ceding the Big Game at 7:15 p.m.
The line of march will continue past
the reviewing stand in front of the
Hoover War L,ibe, past the Law
Building, and ending in the parking
lot at the west end of the Chem
Building.
Six classifications arc again to be
made for the floats:
Sweepstakes, alumni perpetual,
men's division, women's division,
humor and originality, and execu
tion.
MORNING HOUSE JUDGING
House decorations will be judged
at 10 o'clock on the morning of the
Big Game. This will give houses
more time to work on their decora
tions and at the same time elimi
nate the problem of furnishing
i lighting.

I lems in house decorations has been
