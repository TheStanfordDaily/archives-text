# On Leaving the Old Folks at Home
## 
### 
Week by week more people are turning up
in the Stanford rooting section who are not
students here and probably never were.
Saturday we spotted several groups of "old
folks," not dressed in the typical white shirt
nnd rooter's cap attire and not willing to co
operate with yells.
How these people get in is hard to say.
Rally Com checks' student body fcardja of all
those entering at Gate I. However, the aisles
to the rooting section from the top apparently
are not so well guarded. Almost anyone can
walk from the refreshment stands into Sec
tions RR and S without question.
In the last two games there have not been
enough seats for all rooters, probably because
of space taken by these people who have no
business in the section. A 1 Masters says the
same number of tickets are printed as there
are seats in the rooting section.
But if people with general admission tick
ets crowd into the rooting section, student late
comers with a right to a seat are out of luck.
Rally Com should check student body
cards at the top of the men's section. Fur
thermore, the rooting section should be ex

tended as high as the press box, instead of
having several rows at the top for Stadium
subscribers, alumni, and other groups.
The problem will be more serious at the
Dig Game when many non-students will hold
rooters' tickets. Rooters' tickets are already
selling for at least $10. Many would rather
pocket the money and watch the game over
.'television.
When the tickets are sold to people of col
lege age, the problem is not so seious. But
when students buy rooters' tickets for their
mothers and fathers, things have gone too far.
USC has solved this problem by having
each student's picture on his student body
card, which is checked at the game. This is
probably not possible here. But since the per
son who sells the ticket loans his ASSU card,
with it, our cards mean nothing as identifi
cation.
Whether other identification should be re
quired at the Big Game is a question for
Rally Com to decide. But at the Big Game,
when spirit, card stunts, and yells are more
important than ever, students and no one else
should sit in the rooting section. —M.H.

comers with a right to a seat are out of luck.
Rally Com should check student body
cards at the top of the men's section. Fur
thermore, the rooting section should be ex

tended as high as the press box, instead of
having several rows at the top for Stadium
subscribers, alumni, and other groups.
The problem will be more serious at the
Dig Game when many non-students will hold
rooters' tickets. Rooters' tickets are already
selling for at least $10. Many would rather
pocket the money and watch the game over
.'television.
When the tickets are sold to people of col
lege age, the problem is not so seious. But
when students buy rooters' tickets for their
mothers and fathers, things have gone too far.
USC has solved this problem by having
each student's picture on his student body
card, which is checked at the game. This is
probably not possible here. But since the per
son who sells the ticket loans his ASSU card,
with it, our cards mean nothing as identifi
cation.
Whether other identification should be re
quired at the Big Game is a question for
Rally Com to decide. But at the Big Game,
when spirit, card stunts, and yells are more
important than ever, students and no one else
should sit in the rooting section. —M.H.
Week by week more people are turning up
in the Stanford rooting section who are not
students here and probably never were.
Saturday we spotted several groups of "old
folks," not dressed in the typical white shirt
nnd rooter's cap attire and not willing to co
operate with yells.
How these people get in is hard to say.
Rally Com checks' student body fcardja of all
those entering at Gate I. However, the aisles
to the rooting section from the top apparently
are not so well guarded. Almost anyone can
walk from the refreshment stands into Sec
tions RR and S without question.
In the last two games there have not been
enough seats for all rooters, probably because
of space taken by these people who have no
business in the section. A 1 Masters says the
same number of tickets are printed as there
are seats in the rooting section.
But if people with general admission tick
ets crowd into the rooting section, student late
comers with a right to a seat are out of luck.
