Seallle Alumni
To the Editor:
The Stanford alumni of the Northwest wish to
take the opportunity to thank the student body of
Stanford for its co-operation in sending the Stan
ford Band to Seattle in connection with the Wash
ington game. The band did an excellent job here and
made a wonderful impression on all of the alumni
here as well as on the more than 30,000 spectators at
the game. Much comment was heard reflecting most
favorably, not only on the band but on the Uni
versity and student body.
The band arrived Friday night in time to partake
in the pre-game festivities at our biennial football
banuet and certainly contributed to the success of
the affair. The old Stanford spirit was definitely at
its highest peak in Seattle and must have transmitted
itself by some mysterious means into the football
team the next day, for never before has a Stanford
team performed so well in the University of Wash
ington stadium.
As you can imagine, the Stanford alumni are very
proud of their team, their band, and their Uni
versity.

Hooting Sections
To the Editor:
Cannot the Stanford rooting scction use a little
discretion in timing its yells and it little considera
tion for the cash customers, who are distracted from
the game by a continuous raucous yelling by the yell
leader into the microphone, who evidently does not
realize he is talking into a loud-speaker, and whose
voice is magnified in volume far louder than neces
sary for the cheering section to hear him?
Yells are continually called for when the public
address system is reporting the previous play and
making important announcements of the results of
games played elsewhere and of alumni gatherings,
and these announcements cannot be heard by anyone
sitting within four or five sections of the rooters.
There is ample time for yells between these short
announcements and the subsequent play.
A ntw iow in judgment was registered at the
Washington-Stanford game in Seattle last week,
when a long Stanford yell was called for just as
the two university bands were assembled to play the
Star Spangled Banner, and they had played several
strains before the yelling ceased.
