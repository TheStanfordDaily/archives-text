# Back in ’95 Girls Had It Tougher
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
Freshman girls of (he Pioneer
Class of '95 had to be in at 9
every night.
But with the passing years
came a gradual relaxation of
restriction for women — thank
heavens, sigh the roughs!
The first invitation which Encina
extended to Ruble for a reception
and dance soon after the Univer
sity had opened in 1891 was refused
by the girls at a mass meeting be
cause they did not deem it proper
to dance at such an early date and
on such slight acquaintance. In 1911
when the women were first given
full control over social regulations,
the new Judicial Board of Women's
Conference began its work by tak
ing action on a girl for using pro
fanity.
NO UNCIIAPERONEI) MOTORING
The 1921 Social Regulations book
let stated that there would be "no
motoring unchaperoned alter dark
except as a means of transportation
between Palo Alto and the campus."
ft also forbade walking unchap
eroned in the hills after dark for
| parties of fewer than six. At this
' time girls were not allowed to at
tend student-sponsored off-campus
! dances, and needed permission from
the Dean of Women's oflice to go to
! uriy outside-sponsored function.
Girls were first allowed to smoke
in 1924, but only in their living
groups. It was then considered quite
unladylike to smoke in public, and
only in 19M4 were the final restric-
I tions against smoking on streets and
; campus lifted.
BOBBY SOCKS
It was not until 1941 that bobby
i ?ocks became an accepted part of
the Stanford woman's costume. In
i that year there was much debate
over whether their acceptance
! might constitute a violation of the
! Fundamental Standard, since Mrs.
Stanford had asked that girls be
properly dressed on Quad at the
same time that she had insisted that
there be no smoking on Quad.
Bobby socks were finally per
muted because of the silk shortage
j and their decided popularity, but
jonly alter a special meeting of
i Women's Conference and a tea to
get the opinions of faculty wives
I and alumnae.
i Commenting on the change to
short socks and the prevailing fad
of pigtails, Miss Yost, Dean of
Women at the time, stated that it
was "perfectly all right as long as
the girls themselves do not indicate
the trend of mind one usually as
sociates with braids and bobby
j socks."

Fashion - minded Stanford women
will hear hints on clothes, makeup, i
and shopping tonight from 7:130 to 8
on "Annette's Notebook.''
At S) o'clock William Avar's speech
will be broadcast by tape recording.
Agar, a United Nations director of
public information, will speak al
4:15 today in Cubberley Auditorium.

Freshman girls of (he Pioneer
Class of '95 had to be in at 9
every night.
But with the passing years
came a gradual relaxation of
restriction for women — thank
heavens, sigh the roughs!
The first invitation which Encina
extended to Ruble for a reception
and dance soon after the Univer
sity had opened in 1891 was refused
by the girls at a mass meeting be
cause they did not deem it proper
to dance at such an early date and
on such slight acquaintance. In 1911
when the women were first given
full control over social regulations,
the new Judicial Board of Women's
Conference began its work by tak
ing action on a girl for using pro
fanity.
NO UNCIIAPERONEI) MOTORING
The 1921 Social Regulations book
let stated that there would be "no
motoring unchaperoned alter dark
except as a means of transportation
between Palo Alto and the campus."
ft also forbade walking unchap
eroned in the hills after dark for
| parties of fewer than six. At this
' time girls were not allowed to at
tend student-sponsored off-campus
! dances, and needed permission from
the Dean of Women's oflice to go to
! uriy outside-sponsored function.
Girls were first allowed to smoke
in 1924, but only in their living
groups. It was then considered quite
unladylike to smoke in public, and
only in 19M4 were the final restric-
I tions against smoking on streets and
; campus lifted.
BOBBY SOCKS
It was not until 1941 that bobby
i ?ocks became an accepted part of
the Stanford woman's costume. In
i that year there was much debate
over whether their acceptance
! might constitute a violation of the
! Fundamental Standard, since Mrs.
Stanford had asked that girls be
properly dressed on Quad at the
same time that she had insisted that
there be no smoking on Quad.
Bobby socks were finally per
muted because of the silk shortage
j and their decided popularity, but
jonly alter a special meeting of
i Women's Conference and a tea to
get the opinions of faculty wives
I and alumnae.
i Commenting on the change to
short socks and the prevailing fad
of pigtails, Miss Yost, Dean of
Women at the time, stated that it
was "perfectly all right as long as
the girls themselves do not indicate
the trend of mind one usually as
sociates with braids and bobby
j socks."

Fashion - minded Stanford women
will hear hints on clothes, makeup, i
and shopping tonight from 7:130 to 8
on "Annette's Notebook.''
At S) o'clock William Avar's speech
will be broadcast by tape recording.
Agar, a United Nations director of
public information, will speak al
4:15 today in Cubberley Auditorium.
