# Freshman Football Team Downs Trojan Babes, 19-7
## Indians Run Wild In Third Quarter 
### AL BERRY 
i Stanford's "we - don't - know -
how-to-lose" freshman football
team showed a delightful lack
of originality Saturday as they
thumped the Trobabes by the
same old score all of the post
war frosh have beaten USC by,
19-7.
The Papooses, minus the services
of their finest offensive threat—
lullback Skip Crist who got knee
trouble last week, floundered badly
the first half and managed to look
only slightly better than the young
Trojans. The young Trojans looked
•terrible.
But on defense, it was a different
story for the Cards. Bolstered by a
pair of very excellent guards, Tom
Romano and Norm Manoogian,
Coach Chuck Toylor's defensive
team looked like a healthy granite
wall.
CARDS OPEN UP
It was in the third stanza, after a
pleasant repast of oranges, water
and chewing gum, that the yearlings
started looking like a football team.
The Southlanders obligingly fum
bled on their own 40, and quarter
back Joe St. Gome stayed on the
ground, alternately handing the ball
of! to halfbacks Peterson and Gar
giulo, and fullback Tom Dragna, a
guard moved to full to aid in re
placing the injured Crist. And it
was Dragna who rang up the first
tally, thundering his way into pay
dirt from the SC 12. The conversion
was wide.
Then the Cardinals discovered
that there are indeed many four
leaf clovers planted in the Coliseum
turf. An unidentified Trobabe fum
bled Lou Drapers kickolT, and
tackle John Broderick recovered lor
the Indians. Then speedster Dick
Gargiulo, the best running back of
the field Saturday, danced 38 yards
around light end, and the score was
12-0. Again the conversion was
wide.
TROBABES FUMBLE AGAIN
The Trobabes, not content with
being merely 12 points behind, fum
bled on their first play after the
kiekoff, and Hayden Leason re
covered for Stanford on the Trojan
20. Dragna boomed his way to the
five. Van Sant happily sped to the
one, where he was knocked out of
bounds, and A 1 Peterson scored
from there. Draper finally kicked
the afterpoint, and the white-shirted
freshmen led. 19-0.
The whole merry spree had taken
place in exactly six minutes.
TROJANS SCORE
The Trojans, incidentally, scored,
too. Just as the final gun called a
cessation to hostilities, SC quarter
back Neil Colgrove tagged a 24-
yard touchdown pass to end Bill
Freeman. SC kicked the afterpoint
and the final was 19-7.
Coach Chuck Taylor, who has yet
to play on or coach a team that has
lost to USC, was pleased by the out
come of the fracas, but thought that
his men had room for huge improve
ment, if they expected to stop the
tiny Spartans next week, or the
might Cal frosh the week after. Of
the latter tussle, Taylor consented
to state that it should prove to be
'interesting."

the first half and managed to look
only slightly better than the young
Trojans. The young Trojans looked
•terrible.
But on defense, it was a different
story for the Cards. Bolstered by a
pair of very excellent guards, Tom
Romano and Norm Manoogian,
Coach Chuck Toylor's defensive
team looked like a healthy granite
wall.
CARDS OPEN UP
It was in the third stanza, after a
pleasant repast of oranges, water
and chewing gum, that the yearlings
started looking like a football team.
The Southlanders obligingly fum
bled on their own 40, and quarter
back Joe St. Gome stayed on the
ground, alternately handing the ball
of! to halfbacks Peterson and Gar
giulo, and fullback Tom Dragna, a
guard moved to full to aid in re
placing the injured Crist. And it
was Dragna who rang up the first
tally, thundering his way into pay
dirt from the SC 12. The conversion
was wide.
Then the Cardinals discovered
that there are indeed many four
leaf clovers planted in the Coliseum
turf. An unidentified Trobabe fum
bled Lou Drapers kickolT, and
tackle John Broderick recovered lor
the Indians. Then speedster Dick
Gargiulo, the best running back of
the field Saturday, danced 38 yards
around light end, and the score was
12-0. Again the conversion was
wide.
TROBABES FUMBLE AGAIN
The Trobabes, not content with
being merely 12 points behind, fum
bled on their first play after the
kiekoff, and Hayden Leason re
covered for Stanford on the Trojan
20. Dragna boomed his way to the
five. Van Sant happily sped to the
one, where he was knocked out of
bounds, and A 1 Peterson scored
from there. Draper finally kicked
the afterpoint, and the white-shirted
freshmen led. 19-0.
The whole merry spree had taken
place in exactly six minutes.
TROJANS SCORE
The Trojans, incidentally, scored,
too. Just as the final gun called a
cessation to hostilities, SC quarter
back Neil Colgrove tagged a 24-
yard touchdown pass to end Bill
Freeman. SC kicked the afterpoint
and the final was 19-7.
Coach Chuck Taylor, who has yet
to play on or coach a team that has
lost to USC, was pleased by the out
come of the fracas, but thought that
his men had room for huge improve
ment, if they expected to stop the
tiny Spartans next week, or the
might Cal frosh the week after. Of
the latter tussle, Taylor consented
to state that it should prove to be
'interesting."
i Stanford's "we - don't - know -
how-to-lose" freshman football
team showed a delightful lack
of originality Saturday as they
thumped the Trobabes by the
same old score all of the post
war frosh have beaten USC by,
19-7.
The Papooses, minus the services
of their finest offensive threat—
lullback Skip Crist who got knee
trouble last week, floundered badly
the first half and managed to look
only slightly better than the young
Trojans. The young Trojans looked
•terrible.
