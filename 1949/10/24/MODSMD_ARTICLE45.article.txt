# UN Birthday Today Marks Fourth Year
## 
### RICHARD KELTON 
(Ed. note: Kclton is president
of the IIR at Stanford and region
al chairman of the California-Ne
vada-Iluwaii District of the N'SA.)
Today a cornerstone is going to
be placed in the framework of a new
building. It will undoubtedly be a
most impressive ceremony.
Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of
the United Nations, will place cop
ies of the United Nations Charter
and the UN Declaration of Human
Rights into this marble block, and
President Truman will give a sol
emn speech commemorating the
fourth year of the existence of the
United Nations.
It is a distraught world that gives
not able to establish universal se
-000,000 less than it costs the city of
New York to run its Department of
Sanitation, and then complains be
cause in the four years of its ex
istence the world organization has
failed to achieve a goal which man
kind has sought for centuries.
UN SUCCESSES
But while the United Nations was
not able to establish universa Ise
curity from war, it has in the past
year brought peace to Palestine,
caused the cessation of hostilities
over Kashmir in India, established a
truce in Indonesia, and averted
world conflict by resolving the Ber
lin blockade.
Meanfhile its specialized agencies
have been carrying on their contin
uous services, so necessary that they
are taken for granted. The Univer
sal Postal Union, the International
Civil Aviation Organization, and the
International Telecommunications
Union are functioning to integrate
the efforts of the nations in fields
where they' have rccognizcd that co
operation is essential.
Occasionally some of the agencies
make the back pages of newspapers
as they fulfill their appointed tasks.
The Food and Agriculture Organi
zation helped China by inoculating
500,000 head of cattle against the
black plague; then took disease-re
sistant strains of chestnut trees from
China to fight tree blight in Italy.
ONE WORLD AIM
UNESCO distributed $200,000,000
worth of supplies. The International
Children's Emergency Fund fed four j
and a half million children a couple
of billion meals. The World Health
Organization, fighting malaria, tu- i
bcrculosis, and general diseases
around the world, moved into Egypt; |
and stopped a cholera plague.
And the routine tasks continue.
In one week, meetnigs of various
agencies of the UN are held in Sin
gapore, Montevideo, Paris, and New
York. The world is the new scope !
of operation. Men who have given
an oath of allegiance to a new en
tity, superseding the nation, are
working for the organization. The
concept of "One World'' is taking
substance as the United Nations
continues its work.
There have been failures; some of j
them serious, indeed. It may be that j
the stone being laid in New York !
will become only the tombstone of l
this generation's hopes. But given
time, and luck, and above all sup
port. and confidence, this new organ- !
ization may grow to maturity, and i
the stone laid October 24. 1949, will
come to be regarded as another
milestone along the road toward a
peaceful world.

Today a cornerstone is going to
be placed in the framework of a new

most impressive ceremony.
Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of
the United Nations, will place cop

It is a distraught world that gives

UN SUCCESSES
But while the United Nations was
not able to establish universa Ise
curity from war, it has in the past
year brought peace to Palestine,
caused the cessation of hostilities
over Kashmir in India, established a
truce in Indonesia, and averted
world conflict by resolving the Ber
lin blockade.
Meanfhile its specialized agencies
have been carrying on their contin
uous services, so necessary that they
are taken for granted. The Univer
sal Postal Union, the International
Civil Aviation Organization, and the
International Telecommunications
Union are functioning to integrate
the efforts of the nations in fields
where they' have rccognizcd that co
operation is essential.
Occasionally some of the agencies
make the back pages of newspapers
as they fulfill their appointed tasks.
The Food and Agriculture Organi
zation helped China by inoculating
500,000 head of cattle against the
black plague; then took disease-re
sistant strains of chestnut trees from
China to fight tree blight in Italy.
ONE WORLD AIM
UNESCO distributed $200,000,000
worth of supplies. The International
Children's Emergency Fund fed four j
and a half million children a couple
of billion meals. The World Health
Organization, fighting malaria, tu- i
bcrculosis, and general diseases
around the world, moved into Egypt; |
and stopped a cholera plague.
And the routine tasks continue.
In one week, meetnigs of various
agencies of the UN are held in Sin
gapore, Montevideo, Paris, and New
York. The world is the new scope !
of operation. Men who have given
an oath of allegiance to a new en
tity, superseding the nation, are
working for the organization. The
concept of "One World'' is taking
substance as the United Nations
continues its work.
There have been failures; some of j
them serious, indeed. It may be that j
