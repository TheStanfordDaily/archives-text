The Centuries-Old Romance
Of Irish Linen
Ilandloom linen weaving is not a lost art in
Irelandâ€”from Lurgan, County Down, we've
brought the Aristocrat of linens, woven by
sons of sons of handloom craftsmen. Intri
cately patterned table damasks, lovely towels,
and exquisite handkerchiefs of sheerest linens
flow from these looms, and in the fields of
County Down grows the blue blossomed flax
that can be harvested but 14 times a century.
Handpicked and handcombed, only the finest
fibres are accepted by the hand weavers. We
offer with pleasure the fine work of these
craftsmen.
