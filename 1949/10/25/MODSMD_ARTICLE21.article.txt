# Agar Deplores Lack of Unity
## UN Publicity Chairman Emphasizes Organization's Vitality, Adaptability 
### 
The United Nations, although it has not yet been able to per
form the functions for which it was formed, has, in the four years
of its existence, had a very great effect in bringing world public
opinion tb bear on international problems.
This was the message that William Agar, director of the divi-

+sion of special services of the UN
I Office of Public Information, gave
in a talk yesterday afternoon in
Cubberley Auditorium. Hhis speech
j was sponsored by the Institute of
, International Relations as an ob
servance of United Nations Day, the
fourth birthday of the world or
j ganization,
The United Nations organization,
he emphasized, is only a machine,
j and in the end it will be "totally
| useless unless it is used for the pur
! pose intended." The UN was in
i tended to operate on a basis of
I unanimity, and there has not been
' nny unanimity.
j "The UN has not caused this polit
j ical rift betwrfn the Soviet bloc
j and the rest of the world," said
i Agar, "and it is an indication of the
j vitality of this young and growing

Delegate Warren Austin and As
sembly President Herbert Evatt,
Agar said, have expressed the opin
ion that it may turn out to be a
good thing that the UN had no force
behind it in its early days.
It has been compelled to act only
as a conciliator, and its methods arc

cessful in cases like those of Pal
