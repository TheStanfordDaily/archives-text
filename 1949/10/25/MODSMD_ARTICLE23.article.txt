# AWS Initiates New Program
## 
### 
Meetings between the vice-presi
dents, secretaries, and treasurers of
the various women's living groups
in the last two weeks mark the be
ginning of the newly-started AWS
orientation program, Diane Porter,
president of AWS Cabinet, ex
plained yesterday.
This is the first year the various
officers in each women's house have
met together to exchange ideas and
correct misconceptions about their
jobs. In the past each individual
area had its own leadership pro
gram, but this year AWS is spon
soring overall meetings in an effort
to unite the women students.
TREASURY MEETING
Treasurers of the women's living
groups met October 12 to discuss
common problems. Sally Foote,
AWS treasurer, explained the stu
dents' organizations fund to the
other treasurers. All living groups,
including women's Row houses,
draw from this fund, which is really
a monetary pool.
Miss Footc also went over the
AWS policy on women's residence
finances, which puts a $4 limit on
social dues.
The vice-presidents, meeting with
Jan Edwards, AWS vice-president,
last week, brought out the fact that
the job is widely different in each
living unit. Some vice-presidents
are also the social chairman, and
some take charge of the new girls,
as in Row houses.
ASSU STAY-A-WHILES'
The ASSU "stay-a-whiles," which
are put on every Wednesday, will
be handled in part by the vice
presidents this year. Betty Colket,
Union Residence, was elected per
manent co-chairman of these affairs.
Each vice-presidcnt will be a co
chairman of one "stay-a-while"
during her term of office.
How to take good minutes and
write business letters was discussed
at the secretaries' meeting last Fri
day with Carol Truman. AWS sec
retary. The idea that the secretary
is hostess of her house at meetings
there was also brought out.
The purpose of the AWS orienta
tion program, Miss Porter explained,
is first to allow individual areas to
get new ideas so that they might
grow in efficiency and scope, and
second, to disseminate information in
one place. The idea is not to make
things uniform, Miss Porter said, but
to have a way for houses to ex
change ideas.

at the secretaries' meeting last Fri
day with Carol Truman. AWS sec
retary. The idea that the secretary
is hostess of her house at meetings
there was also brought out.
The purpose of the AWS orienta
tion program, Miss Porter explained,
is first to allow individual areas to
get new ideas so that they might
grow in efficiency and scope, and
second, to disseminate information in
one place. The idea is not to make
things uniform, Miss Porter said, but
to have a way for houses to ex
change ideas.
Meetings between the vice-presi
dents, secretaries, and treasurers of
the various women's living groups
in the last two weeks mark the be
ginning of the newly-started AWS
orientation program, Diane Porter,
president of AWS Cabinet, ex
plained yesterday.
This is the first year the various
officers in each women's house have
met together to exchange ideas and
correct misconceptions about their
jobs. In the past each individual
area had its own leadership pro
gram, but this year AWS is spon
soring overall meetings in an effort
to unite the women students.
TREASURY MEETING
Treasurers of the women's living
groups met October 12 to discuss
common problems. Sally Foote,
AWS treasurer, explained the stu
dents' organizations fund to the
other treasurers. All living groups,
including women's Row houses,
draw from this fund, which is really
a monetary pool.
Miss Footc also went over the
AWS policy on women's residence
finances, which puts a $4 limit on
social dues.
The vice-presidents, meeting with
Jan Edwards, AWS vice-president,
last week, brought out the fact that
the job is widely different in each
living unit. Some vice-presidents
are also the social chairman, and
some take charge of the new girls,
as in Row houses.
ASSU STAY-A-WHILES'
The ASSU "stay-a-whiles," which
are put on every Wednesday, will
be handled in part by the vice
presidents this year. Betty Colket,
Union Residence, was elected per
manent co-chairman of these affairs.
Each vice-presidcnt will be a co
chairman of one "stay-a-while"
during her term of office.
How to take good minutes and
write business letters was discussed
at the secretaries' meeting last Fri
day with Carol Truman. AWS sec
retary. The idea that the secretary
