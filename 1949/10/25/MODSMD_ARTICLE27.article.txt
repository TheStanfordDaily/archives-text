# Revive the Revivals
## 
### 
Of the many social and intellectual pro
grams scheduled for students, one has been
particularly noticeable by its absence this
quarter the Revival Series of Ancient Films.
The Committee on Public Exercises met last
spring and decided to hold the Series winter
and summer quarters only. Several reasons
were advanced for this decision:
1. The students were too busy with other
activities during fall and spring quarters.
2. Cubberley Auditorium was completely
scheduled for most of the fall quarter, and
Memorial Auditorium was not suitable for pro
jection of this type of film.
3. The supply of old films was not unlim
ited, and repetition would soon start.
But of these reasons given by this commit
tee, only the second seems to be a valid one,
and this is not applicable during spring quar
ter.
A look at the record of sold-out series in

the past proves that enough students always
seem to have time to go to the movies. Fur
thermore, since the demand for tickets never
meets the supply, it would be sensible to start
a repeat of the entire group of films every
two or three years.
Naturally, it is too late to run the series this
quarter. The film library, however, needs only
two months' notice of a scheduled series, and
would be able to supply films for this coming
spring quarter. The Committee on Public Ex
ercises meets in the near future and prompt
action by them in securing films and reserving
the Cubberley Auditorium would make it pos
sible for the films to be shown during the
spring, as well as the winter and summer quar
ters.
The series, moreover, is integrated with
Speech and Drama Course 85, History and
Aesthetic Development of the Motion Picture,
and can be considered an educational benefit
to any student attending. â€”J.T.
