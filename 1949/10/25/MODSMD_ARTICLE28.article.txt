Letters to the Editor, otherwise known as Campus
Opinion, are ;in important part of this or any news
paper.
Said letters have always fascinated me, although
half the time — <kke the dead

hunting dojj they have no point.
I've always wanted to write a
letter to the editor, but staff
members aren't eligible, so I had
to cross Edit Board up with a
column called Bull Session which
today is really letters to Any
body.
Pat DeYoung
President of Rally Com
Stanford
Dear Pat,

I am led to believe that a few members of your
Rally Committee took offense over a recent Session
in which I joshed your White Sweaters. Honest, Pat,
if. was just josh. It was too bad there were those
who didn't understand that it was josh. Actually,
Rally Com has done a fine job this year, and that's
no josh.
The misunderstanding over last week's article grew
out of the fact that the associate editor on duty cut
out the last two lines of the story. If you remember,
I had started to say, "I'm going to say something good
about Rally Com if it kills me."
Then, it was to read:. "Remember our motto: . . . ,
deleted .... deleted .... Rally Com."
Oops, they cut it out again. I guess we'll never
get together. However, if anybody would like to
know what it was, just dial DA 2-2166 and ask for
thp motto.

Hank Rosin
ASSIJ President
Stanford
Dear Hank,
Your entire administration is going to fail worse
than a sociology student taking math unless you do
.something to get rid of the yellow jackets swarming
over the Cellar.
Hank, these bees have got to go. The cold weather
has killed off a few, but the tough ones remain. You
must make it Excom's beesness to solve this critical
problem.
Gene are the day when kwad-goers could gather
casually for cheer and comradeship over a cup of
white and a glazed donut. The bees are changing
Stanford custom, so get it on the agenda, will you.
Hank? Get it on the agenda.

Dear John,
Hot zam, your funnybook is coming out tomorrow
and I'm all excited. But a word of warning: Don't
sell a copy to Bob Moore, writer of letters to the edi
tor, defender of Rally Com, bomber of Bull Session,
and jerk.
Instead, I'm sending him a copy of Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs which will be more to his taste.
