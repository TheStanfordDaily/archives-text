Who goes to the Hose Bowl if there is a tie?
Lust week a Daily article said that the team longest away from the
Bowl, in case of a tie, gets the nod.
That didn't set quite right to some of us. We couldn't see the good
faculty representatives of the 10 Conference schools giving up their time
honored prerogative of choosing the team. They are to pick the team "most
representing the PCC." That can be taken to mean the second, third,
or last place team.
If the first statement were true, it meant that the faculty incn had
voted away their of vote. Huh-uh, Try again.
It took a call to Vic Schmidt's office to settle the question. But the
answer is just what we exepected.
I( is only in case of a tie vote liy the 10 faculty representatives that the
team that was in the Bowl last must step aside. So, regardless of the
standings at the end oi the season, it will be up to the 10 men, good and
true, to cast their ballots.
Where Does Thai Leave Us?
All of which brings us around to something that we were bound to hit
upon—Stanford's chances for the January 1 event in the light of Saturday's
games.
California is still top dog in my book. The Bears are now tied with
UCLA with a .'5 and 0 record. We of The Daily thought the Bruins would
lose out last Saturday and they darn near did. But they did win and
that only makes us wonder if we hadn't underestimated the Uclans.
But UCLA will be beaten. They have yet to play Cal and USC. I pick
them to lose both tilts.
So, who does the loyal Stanfordite rd?>t for this week? Why, Cali
fornia, of course.
Yep, much as we may not like to, we must hope that Cal beats UCLA
this week. The Bruins must have two Conference defeats if the Red
Machine is to roll on New Year's. This is the time for the first one.
USC travels to Seattle to participate in Washington's Homecoming Cele
bration. Here again, all Loyal Sons of the Red must root against a Cali
fornia team. But a USC win will not hurt the Cards too much if the In
dians come through next week against the same Trojans. That win is a
must if we are to scalp our Rose Bowl tickets.
Let's Get in the Act
Now to something that has been kicking around for some time but
hasn't seen the light of print nearly enough.
•In a few short weeks the Ail-American and All-Coast teams will be
selected. Stanford hasn't had an All-American since Chuck Taylor. Nor
have we hit the All-Coast list since Lloyd Merriman made the team
in 194G.
The Bay Area sports writers picked Oilie Matson and Eddie Laßaron as
the Area's outstanding candidates for Ail-American honors. Down in the
fine print, if you read that far, you might have noticed that they also
picked Stanford's Jim Castagnoli and Cal's Rod Franz for lineman honors.
1 would like to add Ken Rose's name to that of Castagnoli and dare
any writer to pick two finer men, offensively and defensively, on the whole
Coast. Then I challenge them to look over the nation and pick belters ones.
Cas's work has received some degree of praise. He deserves that and
much more. But Rose has gone almost unmentioned. He seldom drops a
pass, and looks very good while catching them. But—and this is the im
portant part—Rose is a great blocking end. Writers all too often overlook
this quality.
As it stands now, Fran Polsfoot of WSC has one end spot almost sewed
up. He made All-Coast last year and the Southern California writers
know of him. That is important.
Bob Stilwell of USC is being boomed for the other position. Well, as
our John Hall said, if Stilwell is All-Coast, then Rose is All-Universe or
All-Atmosphere. That pretty well expresses my sentiments, too.
Then, to make the subject even more confusing, how about Harry Hu
gasian for an All-Coast back? And after last week's game, let's add the
names of Bud Klein and Rupe Andrews.
It would seem we ought to get one of them on that darned All-Coast
team.
