# Bucking Broncs Will Be Hard to Halter As They Head for Season's Sixth Win
## Broncos Haven't Been Broken Since Bears Turned Trick in Season Opener 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Len Casanova's Bronco gridders from down the road a piece,
who hold a history-proven hex over Stanford football teams, will
have at least one additional factor on their side this year when'
they tackle the Indian gridders at the Stadium Saturday.
This time they have a mighty fine football team.
The Santa Clarans, never strict i

adherents to tHe good neighbor pol
iey, haven't been beaten by Stan
lord at the game of hit - and - run
since the days of Merriman, Ander
son, and company. Last year the
Broncos didn't seem to want to win
too badly; but the Indians, always
the gracious hosts, handed them a
27 to 14 victory on a platter of fum
bles.

the following week and almost re
! ceived a rude shock. In fact, they
1 did get a shock, but finally recov
' ered 26 to 13 by goini> all the way
i in one half after trailing at inter
' mission.
That left the outlook rather shaky
i for the battle of the Bruin at the
| Coliseum. Not only were the Bron
! cos apparently slipping from their
earlier peak, but the Westwooders
were fresh from a 14 to 7 win over
; Stanford. And anyone knows that
it takes the best to beat Stanford.
But the boys from the north were
not to be stopped that day. <*»

Casanova has a goodly number
of veterans back from that victori
ous I'J4B squad; and the positions
that were vacated by graduation
have been for the most part capably
filled by sophomores and returning
reservists.
LOST THREE
The quarterback position, to note ,
an outstanding example, was sup
posed to be one of the Broncs'
weakest spots this year when not
one, but three top-flight signal call
ers had sheepskins forced upon
them.
Into the breach stepped two lads
named Len Napolitano and John
Pasco to pass, run, and mastermind
the memories of the departed trio j
into oblivion.
Napolitano, among other feats, j
ranked as the outstanding individ- I
ual star in Sunday's Bronco victory
over Loyola, while Pasco was a
leading light in the upset win over
UCLA two weeks ago.
ONE ERROR
Santa Clara has made only one
serious mistake all year, that of
opening its season against Califor
nia. They dropped that one to the
Bears by 21 to 7; and although a few j
of their later performances have j
been below the Broncos' potentiali- j
ties, they haven't been beaten since.
I
San Jose came the closest of all |
their next five opponents to nab- j
bing the long end of the count, the
Spartans missing their chance for a
walk in the sun by but one point.
That was Santa Clara's second game
of the season, and they eked it out j
14 to 13 on an opportune Spartan j
fumble and a spectacular 50-yard j
punt return by halfback Marte For- !
mico.
Formico is a 138 - pound junior i
who answers to the title of "The '
Splendid Splinter."
Next, the Casanovans took a high
'y enjoyable trip to Fresno, where ,
tl ey mixed their sightseeing with a !
53 to 0 picnic over Fresno State.
MIGHTY CLOSE
Obviously pleased with their sue- j
cess in the minor leagues, the
Broncs took on Portland University j

Len Casanova's Bronco gridders from down the road a piece,
who hold a history-proven hex over Stanford football teams, will
have at least one additional factor on their side this year when'
they tackle the Indian gridders at the Stadium Saturday.
This time they have a mighty fine football team.
The Santa Clarans, never strict i

adherents to tHe good neighbor pol
iey, haven't been beaten by Stan
lord at the game of hit - and - run
since the days of Merriman, Ander
son, and company. Last year the
Broncos didn't seem to want to win
too badly; but the Indians, always
the gracious hosts, handed them a
27 to 14 victory on a platter of fum
bles.

the following week and almost re
! ceived a rude shock. In fact, they
1 did get a shock, but finally recov
' ered 26 to 13 by goini> all the way
i in one half after trailing at inter
' mission.
That left the outlook rather shaky
i for the battle of the Bruin at the
| Coliseum. Not only were the Bron
! cos apparently slipping from their
earlier peak, but the Westwooders
were fresh from a 14 to 7 win over
; Stanford. And anyone knows that
it takes the best to beat Stanford.
But the boys from the north were
not to be stopped that day. <*»

Casanova has a goodly number
of veterans back from that victori
ous I'J4B squad; and the positions
that were vacated by graduation
have been for the most part capably
filled by sophomores and returning
reservists.
LOST THREE
The quarterback position, to note ,
an outstanding example, was sup
posed to be one of the Broncs'
weakest spots this year when not
one, but three top-flight signal call
ers had sheepskins forced upon
them.
Into the breach stepped two lads
named Len Napolitano and John
Pasco to pass, run, and mastermind
the memories of the departed trio j
into oblivion.
Napolitano, among other feats, j
ranked as the outstanding individ- I
ual star in Sunday's Bronco victory
over Loyola, while Pasco was a
leading light in the upset win over
UCLA two weeks ago.
ONE ERROR
Santa Clara has made only one
serious mistake all year, that of
opening its season against Califor
nia. They dropped that one to the
Bears by 21 to 7; and although a few j
of their later performances have j
been below the Broncos' potentiali- j
