# Few Indians Hurt In Saturday Tilt
## 
### 
Because of many nuisance inju
ries received in the Oregon State
tilt last weekend, Stanford's varsity
gridders went through a light scrim
' mage yesterday before retiring to
i see the movies of the Beaver game.
Luckily enough, the Cards pulled
| through the conference game with
out a single serious injury. Halfback
I Ken Peck suffered bruised ligaments
' in the chest and a sore shoulder, but
he will be ready for the tough Santa
Clara contest Saturday.
Last week's bad knee cases, cen
; ter Dick Abraham and tackle Wes
Poulson, are still on the doubtful
| list for Saturday's game, pending an
! examination later this week. Guard
j Russ Pomeroy probably will see
limited action against the Broncos.
