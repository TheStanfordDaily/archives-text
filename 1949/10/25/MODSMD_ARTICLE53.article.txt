Talented Stanford women have j
another chance this year to com- i
pete as members of Mademoiselle
magazine's college board.
In a meeting Friday afternoon,
Miss Darcy Friedman, assistant col
lege board editor of Mademoiselle,
outlined the rules of this year's na
tionwide competition for junior edi
torships.
In the past Stanford has been rep
resented on the college board by
Joyce Oldham, '50, and Joan Max
well, '50. Earlier Barbara Shel!er,
'44, was a junior editor.
Any undergraduate woman may
enter the contest. A tryoutee must
submit a trial report on any new
phase of her campus's life before
November 1. If Ihe paper meets the
approval of Mademoiselle's editors,
she will become a member of the j
college board.
Once a board member, she will be j
assigned three articles, two on gen- [
eral subjects, which may be in the j
form of a project, pertaining to any j
collcgienne field.
Twenty coeds are selected to make \
an all - expense - paid trip to New |
York in June to work on the Au- ]
t»ust "college" issue.
Mademoiselle's address is 122 East
42nd Street, New York.
