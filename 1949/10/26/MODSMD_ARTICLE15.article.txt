## First Gold Discoverer Dies Pauper 
### 
The man who more than anyone !
else was responsible for the addition
of California to the Union died in
near poverty, the unhappy victim of |
both an unsympathetic American i
government and a horde of ravenous
pioneers who ransacked his property
nnd laid waste his land in their j
search for California gold.
This fact was revealed to a Tues- 1
day Evening Series audience last j
night by Geoffrey F. Morgan, Stan- :
ford 1010, who lectured on '"Sutter's I
Fort and Sutter's Gold."
John A. Sutter, the Swiss immi
grant on whose land gold was dis- ,
covered in 1848 to touch off the fa- i
mous Ca'ifornia Gold Rush, was at j
one time the owner of 150,000 acres j
of land and one of the most power- I
fill men in the Far West.
"He died in 1877,"' said Mr. Mor
gan, "practically a pauper after the j
government had confiscated two
thirds of his land and refused him a
$50,000 bonus as payment for the
many services he had rendered his j
country.
"Earlier, thousands of gold hunt- j
ers had stolen his cattle and his j
grain crops and left him without any I
means of paying the large number j
of debts he had incurred. James R.
Marshall, the man who actually dis- |
covered gold at Sutter's 'Mill, died in
poverty and misery."
Until he reached this unhappy '
state of affairs, Sutter had placed j
himself in the same class as Jay !
Gould and Leland Stanford, as one
of the smoothest, if slightly unscru
pulous, of American businessmen.
'In Europe, however," said Mr. J
Morgan, "he was a debt-ridden fu
gitive from justice who harbored an
intense dislike for his wife and five
children.
"He was, however, a kihdty man
with a large vision of things to come,
and the fact remains that he was
one of the leading figures in the
settlement of the West."
