# National Campus Club Given OK On Operations at Stanford
## Farm Committee Denies Endorsement Of Plan Opposed by Paly Merchants 
### 
Representatives of the highly
controversial National Campus
Clubs were yesterday given j
permission to operate on lhe
Stanford campus during the
coming year.
In allowing campus repre- j
sentatives, however, Student- j
Faculty Employment Commit
tee members made it clear that
they in no way approved or en
dorsed the clubs.
It was a surprise to many persons
that permission to operate at Stan
ford was granted at all. inasmuch as
the clubs are being vigorously op
posed by the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce and by other merchants'
groups throughout the country.
The campus clubs operate under
a system of privileged or "preferen
tial" discounts which are inconsist
ent with the "one-price" policies of
most Chambers and Better Business
groups.
NESS WAS FOUNDER
The NCC was founded at Stan
j ford last year by a former student,
Gordon Ness. Club members pay
| annual dues of $3 in return for
j which they arc issued a member
j ship card entitling them to trade at
designated Palo Alto business firms
j which give substantial discounts.
The three dollars is divided, not
! equally, between the representative
j who sells the membership, the cam
| pus manager, and Ness.
The move has been opposed on
j ethical grounds by many business
i men who feel that if merchants were
I called upon to give discounts of
from 10 to 10 per cent to substan
i tial numbers of people in the com
! munity it would undermine the en
tire system of retail business and
; wou'd give certain special privileged
| groups an unfair and unwarranted
i advantage over the general public
\ required to buy at accepted stand
\ ard prices.
BEYOND ETHICS
But in reaching its decision to
grant permission, the Employment
Committee felt that it was beyond
j its power to look into the ethical
j merits of the business.
The campus club representatives
comply with all the regulations re
| garding solicitation and business
I representation at Stanford, and
therefore permission to operate on
campus was granted.
The Stanford Club, formerly
known as the Campus Auto Club,
j has been operating here during the
| past ten months. Membership to
! taled 750 spring quarter and ap
proximately 500 of those members
have returned to school. An active
membership campaign is now under
way to recruit additional members.
A gas station, a garage, a shoe
! repair shop, a dry cleaning estab
lishment. an optometrist, and mcr
| chants selling men's wear, sporting
[ goods, and liquor are presently un
j der contract with the local club.
NOT COMPETITION
Palo Alto merchants oppose the
1 plan largely because of its multi
! price aspect and not because it in
voles one merchant underselling an
| other.
Chamber of Commerce attorneys
are presently investigaitng the lc
i gality of the plan with respect to the
; State Business and Professional
Code and to the Fair Trade Laws.
One of the provisions of the Busi
ness Code makes the giving of re
bates illegal and another provides
that a merchant who sells below
, rates set by manufacturers and dis
tributors is open to law suits by his
j competitors.
Largely through the efforts of
i Ness the plan has spread to approxi
mately HO other campuses since its
beginning here 10 months ago. Bet
ter Business groups in other cities
are opposing the club for the same
j reason as here, and the local Cham
i bcr of Commerce and the Dean of
Students' office have been flooded
with inquiries from as far away as
New York and Alabama.
DEAN CONTACTED
The Dean of Students has been
contacted because campus managers
have been free in their use of the
Stanford name during their selling
campaigns. Some of the letters re
ceived hint that Stanford University
! is understood to be backing the plan.
Managers on other campuses sign
contracts with Ness and pay $25 to
| him for the privi'ege of organizing
the club locally. Ness also receives
I a large portioivot every $3 member
j ship that is sold.
Since the National Campus Club

is incorporated under the laws of
the State of California as a "non
profit" organization, the profits art
divided in the form of large salaries
to Ness and his associates.


NATIONAL CAMPUS CLUB members are issued cards like this
which entitle them to special discounts at certain subscribing
business houses. The NCC and other similar' plans which pro
vide for preferential discounts are being opposed by Palo Alto
merchants.

The campus clubs operate under

groups.
NESS WAS FOUNDER
The NCC was founded at Stan
j ford last year by a former student,
Gordon Ness. Club members pay
| annual dues of $3 in return for
j which they arc issued a member
j ship card entitling them to trade at
designated Palo Alto business firms
j which give substantial discounts.
The three dollars is divided, not
! equally, between the representative
j who sells the membership, the cam
| pus manager, and Ness.
The move has been opposed on
j ethical grounds by many business
i men who feel that if merchants were
I called upon to give discounts of
from 10 to 10 per cent to substan
i tial numbers of people in the com
! munity it would undermine the en
tire system of retail business and
; wou'd give certain special privileged
| groups an unfair and unwarranted
i advantage over the general public
\ required to buy at accepted stand
\ ard prices.
BEYOND ETHICS
But in reaching its decision to
grant permission, the Employment
Committee felt that it was beyond
j its power to look into the ethical
j merits of the business.
The campus club representatives
comply with all the regulations re
| garding solicitation and business
I representation at Stanford, and
therefore permission to operate on
campus was granted.
The Stanford Club, formerly
known as the Campus Auto Club,
j has been operating here during the
| past ten months. Membership to
! taled 750 spring quarter and ap
proximately 500 of those members
have returned to school. An active
membership campaign is now under
way to recruit additional members.
A gas station, a garage, a shoe
! repair shop, a dry cleaning estab
lishment. an optometrist, and mcr
| chants selling men's wear, sporting
[ goods, and liquor are presently un
j der contract with the local club.
NOT COMPETITION
Palo Alto merchants oppose the
1 plan largely because of its multi
! price aspect and not because it in
voles one merchant underselling an
| other.
Chamber of Commerce attorneys
are presently investigaitng the lc
i gality of the plan with respect to the
; State Business and Professional
Code and to the Fair Trade Laws.
One of the provisions of the Busi
ness Code makes the giving of re
bates illegal and another provides
that a merchant who sells below
, rates set by manufacturers and dis
tributors is open to law suits by his
j competitors.
Largely through the efforts of
i Ness the plan has spread to approxi
mately HO other campuses since its
beginning here 10 months ago. Bet
ter Business groups in other cities
are opposing the club for the same
j reason as here, and the local Cham
i bcr of Commerce and the Dean of
Students' office have been flooded
with inquiries from as far away as
New York and Alabama.
DEAN CONTACTED
The Dean of Students has been
contacted because campus managers
have been free in their use of the
Stanford name during their selling
campaigns. Some of the letters re
ceived hint that Stanford University
! is understood to be backing the plan.
Managers on other campuses sign
contracts with Ness and pay $25 to
| him for the privi'ege of organizing
the club locally. Ness also receives
I a large portioivot every $3 member
j ship that is sold.
Since the National Campus Club

is incorporated under the laws of
the State of California as a "non
profit" organization, the profits art
divided in the form of large salaries
to Ness and his associates.


NATIONAL CAMPUS CLUB members are issued cards like this
which entitle them to special discounts at certain subscribing

NOT COMPETITION
Palo Alto merchants oppose the

! price aspect and not because it in
voles one merchant underselling an

Chamber of Commerce attorneys
are presently investigaitng the lc
i gality of the plan with respect to the
; State Business and Professional
Code and to the Fair Trade Laws.
One of the provisions of the Busi
ness Code makes the giving of re

tributors is open to law suits by his
j competitors.
Largely through the efforts of
i Ness the plan has spread to approxi
mately HO other campuses since its
beginning here 10 months ago. Bet
ter Business groups in other cities
are opposing the club for the same
j reason as here, and the local Cham
i bcr of Commerce and the Dean of
Students' office have been flooded
with inquiries from as far away as
New York and Alabama.
DEAN CONTACTED
The Dean of Students has been
contacted because campus managers
have been free in their use of the
Stanford name during their selling
campaigns. Some of the letters re
ceived hint that Stanford University
! is understood to be backing the plan.
Managers on other campuses sign
contracts with Ness and pay $25 to
| him for the privi'ege of organizing
the club locally. Ness also receives
I a large portioivot every $3 member
j ship that is sold.
Since the National Campus Club

is incorporated under the laws of
the State of California as a "non
profit" organization, the profits art
divided in the form of large salaries
to Ness and his associates.


NATIONAL CAMPUS CLUB members are issued cards like this
which entitle them to special discounts at certain subscribing
business houses. The NCC and other similar' plans which pro
vide for preferential discounts are being opposed by Palo Alto
merchants.


GORDON NESS
Representatives of the highly
controversial National Campus
Clubs were yesterday given j
permission to operate on lhe
Stanford campus during the
coming year.
In allowing campus repre- j
sentatives, however, Student- j
Faculty Employment Commit
tee members made it clear that
they in no way approved or en
dorsed the clubs.
It was a surprise to many persons
that permission to operate at Stan
ford was granted at all. inasmuch as
the clubs are being vigorously op
posed by the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce and by other merchants'
groups throughout the country.
The campus clubs operate under
a system of privileged or "preferen
tial" discounts which are inconsist
ent with the "one-price" policies of
most Chambers and Better Business
groups.
NESS WAS FOUNDER
The NCC was founded at Stan
j ford last year by a former student,
Gordon Ness. Club members pay
| annual dues of $3 in return for
j which they arc issued a member
j ship card entitling them to trade at
designated Palo Alto business firms
j which give substantial discounts.
The three dollars is divided, not
! equally, between the representative
j who sells the membership, the cam
| pus manager, and Ness.
The move has been opposed on
j ethical grounds by many business
i men who feel that if merchants were
I called upon to give discounts of
from 10 to 10 per cent to substan
i tial numbers of people in the com
! munity it would undermine the en
tire system of retail business and
; wou'd give certain special privileged
| groups an unfair and unwarranted
i advantage over the general public
\ required to buy at accepted stand
\ ard prices.
