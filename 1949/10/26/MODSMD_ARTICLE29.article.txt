# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Some time ago I requested a little help in acquiring
printable fables of the Farm. My plea went out, and
in time there were, scattered replies, some of which
caused quiet smiles, but none of which were actual
fables.

Instead, all concerned had taken
their own whack at turning out a
parade of gags, which is all right,
1 guess, except that I'm getting
tired of gagging. It's hard on the
throat.
Today I'm giving you, for free,
an example of what has been
coming in. I want you to realize
that this is the best of the bunch,
and that all rights have been
turned over to Bull Session by
willful consent of the inventors.

Pete Giothe, a frosh penman from Encina, has
this to say:
"We new frosh have had information of all sizes,
colors, and shapes bombarded at us. We've been told
what to do and what not to do. We've learned that
professors eat, breathe, and sleep, just like any other
human beings. And we've learned that a few years
back, the Egyptians and the Sumerians and the As
syrians and a bunch of others did a lot of things
which were supposed to have some effect on our
civilization.
However, there are further pertinent details of
living which Stanford has neglected to tell us. I
(Pete) believe that for a full appreciation of the Uni
versity you should know them.

First, it takes 1 ~r j (i! steps to walk from Encina to
Roble.
Second, there are Stanford Wimniin in Roble.
Third, it takes 1,561 steps to walk Irom Roble back
to Encina. (Hall: Most people run.)
Fourth, there are 272 lights on the ceiling of Mem
Aud. (Hall: I used to read dirty jokes during Civ
lectures.)
Fifth, a water bag thrown from the filth floor of
Encina attains a greater velocity than a water bag
thrown from the second floor.
Finally, it takes 1,456 steps to walk to the Post
Office. (Hall: and 20 minutes to cash the contents.)
After having added these startling facts to our
reservoir of knowledge, it is only fitting and proper
that we all jump for joy. One-two-three, all together
now, JUMP!!!
Thanks, Pete.
Next, a frosh girl from Roble, who must be taking
geology and reading her assignments came across
a certain paragraph on page 274 of her Physical
Geo!ogy book. She was supposed to be reading about
sedimentary rocks, but the description must have
reminded her of home because she hurried over to
ihe Daily Shack, book in hand, to read the contents:
"They are remarkably diversified in form; some
are spherical or elliosoidal, others are flat and rinc
shaped, and still others of extraordinarily odd and
fantastic shapes . . . ."
Ihe girl from Roble didn't leave her name. And all
I can say is that now you know what your last Blind
Date was a sedimentary rock.
