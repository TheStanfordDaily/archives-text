Agar Speech
To the Editor:
On Monday the students of Stanford had the op
portunity to hear an outstanding international civil
servant, namely Mr. William Agar, Director of Pub
lic Information for (he United Nations. The attend
ance was poor, to put it mildly. There were % peo
ple there and of this group I estimate that 30 of them
were people from the community around Stanford.
No excuses of "I didn't know" can he accepted. The
Daily did an admirable job on the publicity.
Stanford prides itself on its cosmopolitan atmo
sphere. Is this a way to show this sophistication?
The prolt ssors of the political science department
who teach the very thing that Mr. Agar was talking
about were conspicuous by their absence.
Let us look in on the Sunday movies that show the

enlightening antics of Harold Lloyd or the intellec
tual Jabber of Laurel and Hardy. Here is where we
find the crowds. Is this the result of a "Stanford
Education?"
Ihis is not the first time that such things have
happened. Do not the students realize that we now
have the same type of rseponsibility to the UN that
we have had toward the U.S. for the last 150 years:
that of Knowing our system so that we can criticize
constructively. 11 the UN fails, we can blame our
selves: we can say good-bye to all the little petty
things that seem of such great importance to us now
as they will all be forced to the wayside. Let us
realize that just because we come to Stanford for
nine months of each year, wo do not close ourselves
off from then t of the world for that period. We still
have duties as citizens and leaders of the country
and the world.
