# 'Pest Home' Opens For Mumps, 'Pox
## 
### 
Two cases of chickenpox and one
of mumps caused the unusually
early opening of the Isolation Hos
pital last week.
Lew Cunningham and E. E. New
hall were bedridden with chicken
pox, and Robert Adams had the
mumps.
All were one-week patients and
were dismissed yesterday.
