# Varsity Works Hard, Late; Preps for Santa Clarans
## Schwartz Stresses Running Practice; Card Injuries Still Unknown Element 
### 
In the roughest practice session seen in many a week, Stan
ford varsity gridders went through more than an hour of gruelling
scrimmage work in preparation for this week's tough game with
Santa Clara.
The past two years' contests have seen the Broncs high in spirit,

and it was very evident that Coach
Marchie Schwartz was also trying
to get his boys high for the all
important battle Saturday.
The varsity concentrated on run
ning plays, sending fleet halfbacks
for huge chunks of yardage, against
the jayvees. Rupe Andrews reeled

: off a 65-yard sprint which went all
I the way.
The combination of Kerkorian,
i Andrews, Benson, and DeYoung
■ looked particularly effective. Ben
! son, the Cards' leading ground
; gainer last Saturday against the
I Beavers, drove hard against the de-
I fensive jayvee unit.
Kerkorian, Horn, and Shaw all
I took turns running the tricky "T"
plays. Emery Mitchell, Card vet
j t rail fullback, looked speedier than
l he has all season, and scored once
I on a UO-yard end run play.
The varsity also practiced scoring
j inside the 10-yard line, which has
been a glaring Card weakness all
season.
Ken Peck, sturdy defensive half
back, did not suit up again yester
day, but probably will be ready to
j 140 against the Broncos. Tackle
Gordy White and Guard Dick Lucas
j took it easy yesterday because of
| minor injuries incurred in the OSC
:fracas.
The condition of the injured knee
j men is still unknown. Guard Russ
j Pomeroy and Linebacker Dick Ab
i raham may see limited action, but
tackle Wes Poulson probably will
! miss the Bronc contest Saturday.
