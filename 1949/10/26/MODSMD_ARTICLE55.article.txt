Stanford's Indians can junk Santa Clara Saturday only if they play
their best football.
If they perform as they usually do against Santa C lara, then the Caids
are a lost cause. To be specific, unless they re up for the Broncos, Stan
ford will get dumped faster than last week s garbage.
In 1948, Stanford played its worst game of the season against Santa
Clara to lose, 27 to 14.
In 1947, Stanford played its worst game of the season against Santa
Clara to lose, 13 to 7.
In 1!)4(Â», Stanford played its worst game of the season against Santa
Clara, hut was s:,vcd from defeat liy Uncle Lloyd Merriman's clulch
running, 3.*> to 2(i.
The Indians just don't get fired up over the prospect of meeting the ,
neighborhood Broncbs, and that my friends, has been a tragic blunder.
Because Santa Clara is ALWAYS ready for Stanford. The Broncos just
love to tromp on us Farm boys. And what success they have had!
Eight out of the last 11 battles have gone to Santa Clara. Stanford has
not looked as ridiculous against any other foe. Eight out <>l the last 11. !
That's pitiful.
Last season's effort was the rock bottom. Maybe. Last year Stanford ;
fumbled eight times, had three passes intercepted, and in general, made it
a complete gift to Santa Clara.
This season it should be different, IF the Cards decide to play football
against Santa Clara. IF they do, they have the ability to push the Broncos ;
right back to San Jose.
But you never can tell about these Stanford teams. Just when you i
think that they ought to be fired up and ready to massacre somebody, the |
Indians do a quick reverse, and come out looking like lambs ready to be
come chops.
But if ever a team should be after a win, this week should he the time, j
Santa Clara just finished polishing off baby-blue Bruin, 14 to none, in !
the L.A. Coliseum two weeks ago. With a win over the Broncs, Stanford
could somewhat atone for its 14-7 mistake to those same Bruins.
Then, too. there is some talk that Stanford is on the march again for
Pasadena. After the Santa Clara game, that talk might have some solid
foundation. It also could he reduced to a whisper.
Santa Clara is not a poor football team. Santa Clara never is, especially <
against Stanford. Like I say, Stanford must play its best football next
Saturday.
Anything less than that will prove disastrous.
