WASHINGTON - President Tru
man got a full report today on the j
worsening steel-eoa! crisis from Cy- ;
rus Chine, the government's media- |
tion chief, but the White House said
he still had no plans for taking a
direct hand in the two strikes. Then
was some speculation that the Pres
ident may call the steel industry
disputants to a White House confer
ence later this week.
Irving S. Olds, chairman of U.S
Steel Corp., reported no end to the
steel strike is "immediately in
sight." Olds told a news conference
in New York that U.S. Steel's strik
ing employees have already lost
$46,000,000 in wages.
