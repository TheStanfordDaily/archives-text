To start talking about going to
Europe next year when the Big
Game is stil! three weeks away
would usually be considered mighty
premature. But already HISO is
looming up as a super-record year
for travel to Europe.
Main reason why the Atlantic, es
pecially next summer, will resemble
El Camino Real about 5 o'clock Big
Game afternoon is that lf)50 is Holy
Year for the Roman Catholic
Church, and tens of thousands of
Catholics throughout the wor!d will
be making pilgrimages to Rome.
That, plus the attractive rates re
sulting from the recent devaluation
of European currency.
Therefore, this next hit of news
may not have a complete "be
licve-it-or-not" ring. A major
trans-Atlantic steamship company,
operating almost 50% of the space
to Channel ports, is completely
sold out in both Tourist (3rd)
Class at $150-slf>s and Cabin
(2nd) Class at $210-$225, east
bound in May, June, and July,
I and westbound in late August
| and September.
So the first suggestion we of the
| UNIVERSITY TRAVEL SERVICE
i have to offer to Stanfordites think
! ing of going to Europe next summer
is that they take advantage of our
j FREE SERVICE. Throughout your
| whole transaction there will be no
; charge for any assistance or serv
ices. Whatever the steamship or air
! liens say their fare is, that is the
! amount that you pay us for your
| reservation and ticket. Absolutely
! no payment is made until the lines
I offer us space—probably not before
; December —and then only a 25% de
j posit is required.
One other point before we come
J to our "piece de resistance." You
I will probably hear of or read
about the low - rate "student
ships." usually operated under our
own or foreign government aus
pices, handled through regular
steamship companies and thus by
the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE, as authorized agents
for all major lines. The one weak
point in the student ship program
has been—and continues to be for
i next year—the basic factor of un
| certainty as to whether they will
operate or not.
•
About this time you are probably
' saying, "Going to Europe next .sum
mer really looks 'tough' . . . think
j HI be smart and arrange my pro
! gram so that I can go over there
| during Spring Quarter . . . probably
be less crowded, prices won't be so
I high . . . and I'll be able to see 'Paris
i in the Spring,' sunbathe on the Ri
viera, ski at St. Moritz, spend Holy
1 Week at Rome . . . yes. and come
sto think of it, I've heard that
I Springtime in Europe is really the
j best time."
If your thoughts are going along
! those lines, then you're "in tune"
with the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE. so to speak. Believing
that many Stanfordites would want
ito take advantage of Stanford's
j "three quarters and summer ses
i sion" system, we have made special
[ arrangements for a Stanford stu
dent "Springtime in Europe" trip.
We feel these highlights will meet
! with your enthusiastic approval:
1. We'll fly from New York to
: Nice via T.W.A. Constellation,
| spending three days each in Lis
bon and Madrid. And we'll return
during the last week in May by
ship—either the "Nicuw Amster
dam" or "lie de France."
2. We'll be IN Europe a total of
65 days—over J) weeks—a good bit
longer than many summer tours.
3. To get away from what might
be called "itinerary regimenta
tion," we'll have four "Excursions
a la Carte." This means that the
first week in Mav, for instance,
you'll have a choice of spending a
week in the French Pyrenees
country, or the French Alps, or
in Alsace-Lorraine.
4. Individual desires will not be
ignored. To some the Passion Play
at Oberammergau will be a
i "must." Easter in Rome, a four
day visit to Ireland, or a full week
in Paris may be considered "tops"
! by others.
If this sounds good to you, contact
' our campus* representatives

and they'll be most happy to give
you any information you desire.
Then talk it over with your friends
who went to Europe this past year,
as we feel they will point out many
favorable aspects to our tour. And
finally, drop in and talk it over with
us here at the UNIVERSITY TRAV
j EL SERVICE at 539 Rani on a (the
"Stanford-red awning").
We'll be most happy to have you
make our office your European
travel-planning headquarters. De
spite the fact that you may have
to battle the "Fly-Down-to-USC"
crowd, we heartily suggest that you
make your initial visit in the near
future.

To start talking about going to
Europe next year when the Big
Game is stil! three weeks away
would usually be considered mighty
premature. But already HISO is
looming up as a super-record year
for travel to Europe.
Main reason why the Atlantic, es
pecially next summer, will resemble
El Camino Real about 5 o'clock Big
Game afternoon is that lf)50 is Holy
Year for the Roman Catholic
Church, and tens of thousands of
Catholics throughout the wor!d will
be making pilgrimages to Rome.
That, plus the attractive rates re
sulting from the recent devaluation
of European currency.
Therefore, this next hit of news
may not have a complete "be
licve-it-or-not" ring. A major
trans-Atlantic steamship company,
operating almost 50% of the space
to Channel ports, is completely
sold out in both Tourist (3rd)
Class at $150-slf>s and Cabin
(2nd) Class at $210-$225, east
bound in May, June, and July,
I and westbound in late August
| and September.
So the first suggestion we of the
| UNIVERSITY TRAVEL SERVICE
i have to offer to Stanfordites think
! ing of going to Europe next summer
is that they take advantage of our
j FREE SERVICE. Throughout your
| whole transaction there will be no
; charge for any assistance or serv
ices. Whatever the steamship or air
! liens say their fare is, that is the
! amount that you pay us for your
| reservation and ticket. Absolutely
! no payment is made until the lines
I offer us space—probably not before
; December —and then only a 25% de
j posit is required.
One other point before we come
J to our "piece de resistance." You
I will probably hear of or read
about the low - rate "student
ships." usually operated under our
own or foreign government aus
pices, handled through regular
steamship companies and thus by
the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE, as authorized agents
for all major lines. The one weak
point in the student ship program
has been—and continues to be for
i next year—the basic factor of un
| certainty as to whether they will
operate or not.
•
About this time you are probably
' saying, "Going to Europe next .sum
mer really looks 'tough' . . . think
j HI be smart and arrange my pro
! gram so that I can go over there
| during Spring Quarter . . . probably
be less crowded, prices won't be so
I high . . . and I'll be able to see 'Paris
i in the Spring,' sunbathe on the Ri
viera, ski at St. Moritz, spend Holy
1 Week at Rome . . . yes. and come
sto think of it, I've heard that
I Springtime in Europe is really the
j best time."
If your thoughts are going along
! those lines, then you're "in tune"
with the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE. so to speak. Believing
that many Stanfordites would want
ito take advantage of Stanford's
j "three quarters and summer ses
i sion" system, we have made special
[ arrangements for a Stanford stu
dent "Springtime in Europe" trip.
We feel these highlights will meet
! with your enthusiastic approval:
1. We'll fly from New York to
: Nice via T.W.A. Constellation,
| spending three days each in Lis
bon and Madrid. And we'll return
during the last week in May by
ship—either the "Nicuw Amster
dam" or "lie de France."
2. We'll be IN Europe a total of
65 days—over J) weeks—a good bit
longer than many summer tours.
3. To get away from what might
be called "itinerary regimenta
tion," we'll have four "Excursions
a la Carte." This means that the
first week in Mav, for instance,
you'll have a choice of spending a
week in the French Pyrenees
country, or the French Alps, or
in Alsace-Lorraine.
4. Individual desires will not be
ignored. To some the Passion Play
at Oberammergau will be a
i "must." Easter in Rome, a four
day visit to Ireland, or a full week
in Paris may be considered "tops"
! by others.

To start talking about going to
Europe next year when the Big
Game is stil! three weeks away
would usually be considered mighty
premature. But already HISO is
looming up as a super-record year
for travel to Europe.
Main reason why the Atlantic, es
pecially next summer, will resemble
El Camino Real about 5 o'clock Big
Game afternoon is that lf)50 is Holy
Year for the Roman Catholic
Church, and tens of thousands of
Catholics throughout the wor!d will
be making pilgrimages to Rome.
That, plus the attractive rates re
sulting from the recent devaluation
of European currency.
Therefore, this next hit of news
may not have a complete "be
licve-it-or-not" ring. A major
trans-Atlantic steamship company,
operating almost 50% of the space
to Channel ports, is completely
sold out in both Tourist (3rd)
Class at $150-slf>s and Cabin
(2nd) Class at $210-$225, east
bound in May, June, and July,
I and westbound in late August
| and September.
So the first suggestion we of the
| UNIVERSITY TRAVEL SERVICE
i have to offer to Stanfordites think
! ing of going to Europe next summer
is that they take advantage of our
j FREE SERVICE. Throughout your
| whole transaction there will be no
; charge for any assistance or serv
ices. Whatever the steamship or air
! liens say their fare is, that is the
! amount that you pay us for your
| reservation and ticket. Absolutely
! no payment is made until the lines
I offer us space—probably not before
; December —and then only a 25% de
j posit is required.
One other point before we come
J to our "piece de resistance." You
I will probably hear of or read
about the low - rate "student
ships." usually operated under our
own or foreign government aus
pices, handled through regular
steamship companies and thus by
the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE, as authorized agents
for all major lines. The one weak
point in the student ship program
has been—and continues to be for
i next year—the basic factor of un
| certainty as to whether they will
operate or not.
•
About this time you are probably
' saying, "Going to Europe next .sum
mer really looks 'tough' . . . think
j HI be smart and arrange my pro
! gram so that I can go over there
| during Spring Quarter . . . probably
be less crowded, prices won't be so
I high . . . and I'll be able to see 'Paris
i in the Spring,' sunbathe on the Ri
viera, ski at St. Moritz, spend Holy
1 Week at Rome . . . yes. and come
sto think of it, I've heard that
I Springtime in Europe is really the
j best time."
If your thoughts are going along
! those lines, then you're "in tune"
with the UNIVERSITY TRAVEL
SERVICE. so to speak. Believing
that many Stanfordites would want
ito take advantage of Stanford's
j "three quarters and summer ses
i sion" system, we have made special
[ arrangements for a Stanford stu
dent "Springtime in Europe" trip.
We feel these highlights will meet
! with your enthusiastic approval:
1. We'll fly from New York to
: Nice via T.W.A. Constellation,
| spending three days each in Lis
bon and Madrid. And we'll return
during the last week in May by
ship—either the "Nicuw Amster
dam" or "lie de France."
2. We'll be IN Europe a total of
65 days—over J) weeks—a good bit
longer than many summer tours.
3. To get away from what might
be called "itinerary regimenta
tion," we'll have four "Excursions
a la Carte." This means that the
first week in Mav, for instance,
you'll have a choice of spending a
