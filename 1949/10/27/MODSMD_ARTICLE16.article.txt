# Student Job Shortage Told
## 
### 
Eugene Dils, director of the Stan
ford Appointment Service, yester
day called attention to the shortage
of employment opportunities open
to students at the Student Employ
| ment Office.
He pointed out that there are a
j wide variety of skills and abilities
to be found among the many stu
j dents seeking part - time work
! through the office, but that not
' enough employers are taking advan-
I tage of this agency.
With the high costs of gaining a
j college education, and with the
j growing number of non-veterans
and veterans who have exhausted
j their GI benefits, Dils asserted that
i a part-time job is often the diffcr-
I ence between completing or not
I completing educational and voca
-1 tional plans.
As a reminder to campus and lo
[ cal employers, he cited a few of
the various skills offered by stu
' dents. Small business houses are
] offered bookkeepers, accountants,
j typists and stenographers, and sales
i persons. Larger firms may find cx
! pericnced cashiers, stock and ship
i ping clerks, as well as inventory and
I sales personnel.
Trained auto lubricating special
| ists, service station attendants, and
! car washers may be found among
j the student applicants. Housewives
may secure yard workers, house
cleaner's, baby sitters, music teach
ers, tutors, or chauffeurs, to list but
a few.
