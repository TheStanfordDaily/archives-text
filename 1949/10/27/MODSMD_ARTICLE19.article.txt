# Campus Soliciting Rule Discourages Burglaries
## 
### 
Regulations for soliciting on cam
pus were reviewed yesterday by the
Student-Faculty Employment Com
mittee in an effort to make students
aware of illegal soliciting.
No one is allowed actively to so-;
licit to students on campus. The
representative of a business or con
cession may make his services
known, but cannot go from door to
door and sell things. However, he
may solicit his wares to permanent
residents of the campus, such as
cooks.
This rule was made to protect the
students. In the past solicitors have
been known to return to the living
groups in which they have been
and steal the students' belongings.
Campus representatives from
businesses may have permission to

i display their wares only if they pe
j tition in writing to the Student
, Faculty Employment Committee.
Students may protect themselves
|by asking if the person has been
' cleared through the Student
! Faculty Employment Committee. If
; he or she has been cleared he will
;be able to produce a letter from
j the committee which tells him what
( he can and cannot do.
The committee only regulates the
' methods of contact of the solicitor
j and does not pass on the merits of
| the business he represents.
Laundry and newspaper services
are not subject to these regulations
as they are considered as public
services.
