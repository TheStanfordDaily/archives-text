# Dean Reviews Law Outlook
## 
### 
Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the Law
School spoke on opportunities for
law graduates in government serv
ice at the first bi-monthly dinner
meeting of the Crothers Club last
night.
Judge George Crothers and
Charles Henderson, former head of
the RFC and once senator from Ne
vada, were honored guests.
Dean Spaeth stated that there arc
great opportunities for lawyers in
the foreign service in the Depart
ment of State, the United Nations,
and the various international agen
cies. Work in this field offers one
a fascinating and interesting career,
but financial rewards are out of the
question, he said.
The Dean recommended that
those who enter the foreign serv
ice do so as a career, since one gets
very Utile practical experience from
working for the government in the
international field for a few years
and then going into private practice
or business.
