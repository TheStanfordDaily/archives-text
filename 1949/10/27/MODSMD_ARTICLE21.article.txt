# Hoover Seminar Reveals Russian Politburo Trends
## 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
Some intriguing and little-known
facts about Russia's leaders came to
light in the Hoover Library Seminar
last week. Each week research as
sistants working in the archives in
side the granite giant give an analy
sis of their special projects or spe
cific aspects of their field of study.
Last week George Schuyler, a
member of the Hoover Library Re
search Staff, reported on the Polit
buro, uiviritf general information on
the backgrounds of the 27 members
of the Politburo who have served
on this powerful governing commit
tee of the USSR's Communist Party
since 1017.
Thirteen villagers, nine towns
people, and three from the large
city areas of Moscow and Leningrad,
have served on the Politburo,
Schuyler reported. The Georgian
Republic, Stalin's home district, has
placed 15 per cent of the 27, al
though the republic has one and
one-half per cent of the total Soviet

I population.
"The trend is toward the village
born now," Schuyler said. "This is a
reverse of the general population
trend in Russia. The city men who
once served on the body arc dead
now."
Of the Politburo members, none
i came from a high social caste, nine
I came from a "middle caste," and
i 16 came from the "low caste."
The educational history of Polit
buro members shows that 10 had
been in universities (although not
necessarily graduated), five had had
elementary schooling, three had
been in higher grade schools, three
in trade schools, and two in high
schools. All the "deviationists" who
were killed in purges came from
the group with university back
grounds.
"Those with educations seem to
be frowned on," Schuyler said. "The
five with only elementary schooling
are highly regarded." Molotov is
the only man left on the Politburo

who has had a university educa
tion.
The average aye of the Politburo
j men has increased. In 15)17 it was
Now il is . r »(>. Nine of the for
| mer Politburo members have met
I unnatural deaths.
Schuyler said thai the Politburo is
very remote from the average Rus
sian. Russians know little about its
members. When Stalin dies, Schuy
! ler believes it is uncertain to sup
'pose that the Politburo members
( will hand over the reins to one man.
The trend now in the Politburo is
| to free members from other duties.
Earlier, they often had double jobs.
| NoW members are vice-premiers,
each responsible for a cluster of
ministries.
Schuyler summed up the present
| situation by saying that the trend
| is toward simpler backgrounds. The
switch from a metropolitan environ
ment to a rural one. From the theo
retical type of individual to the ac
tivist.
