Art Brown summarized his sur- j

vey among the Palo Alto merchant:,
in regard to the NSA purchase card
plan.
"The outlook is not very good in
Paly for the purchase cards," he re
ported. "The system cannot go into
effect until some basic change is
made in the Palo Alto economy."
C. OF C. FEELING
Brown said that most of his in
formation had been obtained from
the local Chamber of Commerce.
This group felt that the purchase
card system was all right in other
areas, but that it would disrupt th<-
economy in Palo Alto if put into
effect. Also, if one minority group
(students) were allowed to use the
card plan, other minorities such as
veterans and labor organizations
would soon be clamoring for similar
privileges.
Excom tabled the proposal until
further investigation could be made.
The local NSA group was given ;i
vote of confidence on its proposed
plan for activities here at Stanford.
The plan covered projects affecting
the administrative setup, student
life, educational problems, and in
ternational matters. It was the opin
ion of Excom that this was the first
concrete evidence shown by NSA as
to what it can and will do on cam
pus.

counts, posters, violations of election

Art Brown summarized his sur- j

vey among the Palo Alto merchant:,
in regard to the NSA purchase card
plan.
"The outlook is not very good in
Paly for the purchase cards," he re
ported. "The system cannot go into
effect until some basic change is
made in the Palo Alto economy."
C. OF C. FEELING
Brown said that most of his in
formation had been obtained from
the local Chamber of Commerce.
This group felt that the purchase
card system was all right in other
areas, but that it would disrupt th<-
economy in Palo Alto if put into
effect. Also, if one minority group
(students) were allowed to use the
card plan, other minorities such as
veterans and labor organizations
would soon be clamoring for similar
privileges.
Excom tabled the proposal until
further investigation could be made.
The local NSA group was given ;i
vote of confidence on its proposed
plan for activities here at Stanford.
The plan covered projects affecting

to what it can and will do on cam
pus.
