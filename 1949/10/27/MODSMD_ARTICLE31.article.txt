To the Editor:
At last, something is bein<* done for the consumer.

We, us consumers, have long been victimized in the
squeeze plays of Big Labor, Big Business, yes, and
even Organized Small Business. It has long been
necessary to give the little guy, who does the buying,
a small voice in what goes on in our economy.
Gordon Ne:;s, with his National Campus Club, is
pioneering a movement which has the embryo of
what not only students need, but what every con
sumer has long needed, the opportunity to act in
unison. Of course, the organized interests brand his
movement as against "our American way," but what
progressive movement wasn't?
Best of luck to you, Gordon, and keep up the good
work!
