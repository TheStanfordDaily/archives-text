# Bizarre Props In 'Begger' Fantacy
## 
### 
Memorial Auditorium, home of
the Stanford Players, is stretching
at the seams this week with a lively
assortment of bizarre props, cos
tumes, stage settings, harried stu
dents, and bleary-eyed professors as j
"Beggar on Horseback" enters the 5
last stages of preparation prior to its
staging November 3, 4, and 5.
The play, a satire on love versus
art, which was written 25 years ago
by George Kaufman and Marc Con
nolly, is scheduled for its first tech
nical rehearsal tomorrow night.
Aptly titled "a fantastic comedy,"
"Beggar on Horseback" is the story
of a struggling young musician who
must choose between love and mon
ey for the sake of art. This he does,
after a long dream pointing out the
hell of money and regimentation,
choosing, of course, love and art in !
poverty.
FANTASY SATIRE
The dream is written in the form
of a fantasy which offers Kaufman
and Connolly the opportunity to kid 1
the daylights out of head waiters, 112
dancing masters, theatrical court
rooms, the boorishness of the nou
veaux riches, and music turned out !
by factory methods.
Also included in the dream se
quence is a pantomime, "A Kiss in
Xanadu," which is an effective take
off on the monogamy and boredom !
of royal marriage.
Sets for the play are being de
signed by Wendell Cole and con
structed by members of the depart
ment's staging classes. According to
Cole, the scenery carries on the
play's not-too-subtle theme of bur
lesque. "Since there are nearly 15 j
scenes in the dream sequence j
alone," said Cole, "we are making ,
extensive use of projection settings.
This enables us to avoid slowing the '
production while making the sudden I
scene shifts."
PAINTED SETTING
Projection lighting uses a slide
machine which flashes hand-painted
ulass slides on a 60-foot-high cyclo
rama background. Much of the
scenery, as well as the slides, is be
ing painted by Cole himself and in
cludes, in stylized satire, an elevat- j
ing court bench, a colorful oriental (
setting, a court designed as a the- !
ater, and a "genuine" art factory.
Virginia Opsvig, head of the |
Speech and Drama Department cos
tume and makeup section, is dei
signing the costumes. The play in
volves the services of several pla
toons of waiters, wedding ushers,
dancing masters, and butlers. These
will be dressed, according to Miss
Opsvig, in various assortments of ;

! formal morning clothes and veils,
tuxedos and tights, and hand-paint
| ed, very precise moustaches. As
I stated above, the play is titled "a
! fantastic comedy."
F. Cowles Strickland, associate
I professor of speech and drama, is
j directing the play. According to
I Strickland the play is written as a
{ single unit without the convention
acts. There is one intermission.
Tickets for the play, which cost
$1.28, wlil j.>o on sale Monday at the
Memorial Auditorium box office and
the Peninsula Box Office in Palo
Alto.
