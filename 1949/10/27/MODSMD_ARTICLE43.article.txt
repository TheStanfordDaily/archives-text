## On The Bench 
### 
Excusc me for remembering, but this week I seem to recall a "pep
rally" held about a year ago in the Sunken Diamond. It was Rally Corn's
great pre-Santa Clara game effort. It was fine. They had a chap named
Horse-Trader Ed there, whose chief claim to fame was that he sold more
cars for higher prices than anybody who lived on campus.
I guess oP Ed meant well. He got up and delivered a few nasty re
marks about the school out Santa Clara way, its vile administration and
above all the ineptness of its football team. He sat down—finally—amidst
great applause.
The next speakers on the program were Bronco co-captains Vern Ster
ling and Hall Haynes. They appeared very calm as they eyed the suddenly
uncomfortable Horse Trader, and Sterling, speaker for both, simply said,
"We hope that we aren't quite as bad as this gentleman pictured us. Wo
will do our best to give you people a good game tomorrow."
That was Santa Clara's first victory of the weekend. The second one
came the next afternoon when a chap named Sterling completely de
molished the Stanford line, and another named Hall Hayries ran up and
down the field with grinding monotony.
Well, we have a better football team this year as well as a better Rally
Com, and the same two gentlemen—who will be trying for a repeat per
formance—should have a somewhat frustrated afternoon. But that isn't
the point of this column.
Spirit, Stanford, and the Dink
The point is one I've been tempted to try to make fof some time now—
especially after the dismal showing for the track team in the last spring
rally. Then after last week's sad display for the OSC rally, the great
Dink Templeton, who like a few of the juniors and most of the seniors
here can remember the days when "Stanford Spirit" was more than just
a memory or even a joke. Yep, strange as it may seem to some of you
fans, the old Stanford Spirit used to be a pretty fine thing. But we'll
skip the preaching for now, and simply quote a paragraph or two from
Templeton, who—as usual—knows what he is talking about.
"You can't blame them (the Stanford varsity) for not getting aroused
last Saturday. They go to a big rally Friday night. They parade indi
vidually through a spotlight with their names proclaimed, and fanfare.
Then when they all get set down on bleachers at one end of the basketball
Pavilion and the lights go on, they look out at an almost empty hall. Not
a soul o<i the whole floor. A couple of hundred hotshots on each side of
the gallery and no one on the end. Lord, what a letdown, and of course,
the whole squad felt like perfect fools.
"In my day we'd have gotten up and walked out. But the modern ath
lete is far more of a gentleman than we were. They take dirty wisecracks
at the old fiat house lunches without even inviting the funny guy out to
the field to put on a suit, and believe me it hurts plenty.
"Used to be a student body was heart and soul with the team, win
or lose. I guess it just isn't true any more. They're with 'em all right
when they win, but only if they beat a big enough opponent . . . ."
Of Mice, Men, and Pom-poms
The fault of last week's fiasco was not that of the much-beleaguered
Rally Committee. They planned a good show. They scheduled one of
the Bay Area's top speakers. The team, due to a time mixup, had not
received an ovation upon their triumphant return from Seattle. Still the
thousands of "football experts" who make lots of noisy comments on
Monday, couldn't be bothered to show up to try to give the team a boost.
When it became apparent that the crowd was going to be unbelievably
small, a group of the girl song leaders went up and down the Row to beg
the men to come on down "for the team." They were almost unanimously
told to "shove off." Stanford spirit.
Just what the team is supposed do to "earn" the students' support is
beyond me. The guys had just beaten a highly-touted Washington eleven
by 40 points the Saturday before. Too many of the students are very will
ing to cry if the team should lose, but not many are interested enough to
show up and yell when they win.
The students who did show up at the rally, happily enough, were great.
Their spirit was fine and their yelling raved what was left of the day.
To them goes much credit.
But the real credit, of course, goes to the team, which—it seems —is
determined to win ball games with or without the support of the students.
I think it would be easier for them if they attempted it with.
