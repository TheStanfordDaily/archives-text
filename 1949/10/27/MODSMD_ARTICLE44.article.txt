# Frosh Pigskinners Scrimmage In Search for Missing Offense
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
With two games remaining on :
their schedule, the undefeated Pa- |
pooses settled down to some of their
hardest work of the season. So far
this week, Coach Chuck Taylor has
been stressing offense in preparing
for Saturday's game with San Jose
State freshmen.
To open up the week's practice,
the frosh scrimmaged the varsity on
the main scrum field. Tuesday a
full-blast scrimmage between the l
various strings was uncorked. Noth- j
ing was held back, and the yearlings
worked each other over like Spar
tans.
Apparently satisfied with the
strong defensive showing his pres- j
ent squad has demonstrated in past j
games, Coach Taylor has been hit- i
ting offensive patterns "continually.
In not one winning game have the !
Papooses put together a real smooth
attack, including no fumbles, good
passing and receiving, and downfield
blocking.
Last night, the squad split up into ,
lines that worked out blocking as- j
signments and backfield combina- !

tions that ran through every play in
the frosh bag of tricks.
Quarterbacks Joe St. Geme and
Dave Eldredge alternated in the
signal-calling department. A lot of
time was spent on both long and
short pass plays, since any aerial at
tack at all has been weak.
Wes Laupbscher, Gick Gargiulo,
and Loren Hinkleman continued to
be the top ground gainers in the
yearling attack. At fullback, the
converted lineman, Tom Dragna,
still looks better and better each
day, filling in for the injured Skip
Crist.
Coming out of the Trojan game
last weekend with no new injuries,
the squad is in the best all-around
physical shape of the year. Only
Tommy Van Sant, whose ankle is
sitll bothering him, missed any work
this week.
The condition of Skip Crist, star
fullback who twisted his left knee
in the Brubabe game two weeks ago,
is still in the doctor's hands. The
Skipper has done no running and
been to no workouts for over a
week. Today the medics will decide
if he can start unlimbering his legs
again.
