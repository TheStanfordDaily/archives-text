## HISTORY LESSON Santa Clara Has Proven Rugged Foe 
### EARL ODELL 
When the Indians and the Brones
make a day of it on the local grid
field, the Good Neighbor Policy
ceases to exist!
With the :51st meeting of the back
yard rivals coming up this Satur
day, the boys from Santa Clara will
attempt to show the Cards that,
while they may not be in the same
league wih Stanford, they're in the
same class. The Redshirts, on the
other hand, are out to avenge the
eight defeats in the last eleven con
tests.
THE YEAR OF OUR LLOYD
Not since 194(5, when Lloyd Mer
riman. who could do no wrong with
a football, led the hapless Indians to
a 33 to 26 victory, has Stanford
scored a win over Santa Clara. The
Broncos, under Coach Len Casa
nova, have been an inspired ball
club in recent years, although it's
probable that the Cardinals had
more to do with their losses in 1947
and 1948 than Santa Clara did.
The '47 tilt was one of the poorest
games between the neighboring
schools to date. Neither team could
muster an offense, and their de
fenses were hardly worth mention
ing. Santa Clara only won by push
ing the pigskin over one more time
than Stanford. The final count was
13 to 7.
Last year the Indians fumbled
their way down the ladder of suc
cess. Eight fumbles, two of which
led directly to Bronco scores, coup
led with a pass defense which didn't
exist, gave Santa Clara a 27 to 14
win.
' WOW BOYS WON
Things were different in 1940
when the Farm hands, with their
brand new Model T, beat the Broncs
7 to 6. As it turned out, they were
the only team to turn the tide on
the Broncos that year. There was
no stopping the Card team that sea
son. though, as they were Pasadena
.bound.
Buck Fawcett made the longest
run of the series in the 1941 contest
with a 93-yard ramble, leading the
Injuns in a 27 to 7 victory over the
Broncos.
The 1942 fracas saw the Cardinals
as everyone's pre - game favorites
except a couple of Broncos called
Tony Freitas and Allyn Beals who,
that day, led their team in an upset
over Stanford.
Stanford holds the largest score
in the rivalry, having trounced the
Broncos 55 to (i in 1923.
The series to date finds the Stan
fords leading with 15 wins to Santa
Clara's 10. Only one tie appears in
the books: a 7 to 7 clash in 1934.
The Broncos take particular
pleasure in nipping whatever
dreams the Indians might have, and
usually play way over their heads.
Saturday's game will renew a lot of
old memories, for, although Santa
Clara has always been one of Stan
ford's friendliest opponents, they've
a!so been one of the toughest.

ing. Santa Clara only won by push
ing the pigskin over one more time
than Stanford. The final count was
13 to 7.
Last year the Indians fumbled
their way down the ladder of suc
cess. Eight fumbles, two of which
led directly to Bronco scores, coup
led with a pass defense which didn't
exist, gave Santa Clara a 27 to 14
win.
' WOW BOYS WON
Things were different in 1940
when the Farm hands, with their
brand new Model T, beat the Broncs
7 to 6. As it turned out, they were
the only team to turn the tide on
the Broncos that year. There was
no stopping the Card team that sea
son. though, as they were Pasadena
.bound.
Buck Fawcett made the longest
run of the series in the 1941 contest
with a 93-yard ramble, leading the
Injuns in a 27 to 7 victory over the
Broncos.
The 1942 fracas saw the Cardinals
as everyone's pre - game favorites
except a couple of Broncos called
Tony Freitas and Allyn Beals who,
that day, led their team in an upset
over Stanford.
Stanford holds the largest score
in the rivalry, having trounced the
Broncos 55 to (i in 1923.
The series to date finds the Stan
fords leading with 15 wins to Santa
Clara's 10. Only one tie appears in
the books: a 7 to 7 clash in 1934.
The Broncos take particular
pleasure in nipping whatever
dreams the Indians might have, and
usually play way over their heads.
Saturday's game will renew a lot of
old memories, for, although Santa
Clara has always been one of Stan
ford's friendliest opponents, they've
a!so been one of the toughest.
When the Indians and the Brones
make a day of it on the local grid
field, the Good Neighbor Policy
ceases to exist!
With the :51st meeting of the back
yard rivals coming up this Satur
day, the boys from Santa Clara will
attempt to show the Cards that,
while they may not be in the same
league wih Stanford, they're in the
same class. The Redshirts, on the
other hand, are out to avenge the
eight defeats in the last eleven con
tests.
THE YEAR OF OUR LLOYD
Not since 194(5, when Lloyd Mer
riman. who could do no wrong with
a football, led the hapless Indians to
a 33 to 26 victory, has Stanford
scored a win over Santa Clara. The
Broncos, under Coach Len Casa
nova, have been an inspired ball
club in recent years, although it's
probable that the Cardinals had
more to do with their losses in 1947
and 1948 than Santa Clara did.
The '47 tilt was one of the poorest
games between the neighboring
schools to date. Neither team could
muster an offense, and their de
fenses were hardly worth mention
ing. Santa Clara only won by push
ing the pigskin over one more time
than Stanford. The final count was
13 to 7.
