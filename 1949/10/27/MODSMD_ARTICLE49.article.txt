## 
### 
For the second straight day Coach
Marchie Schwartz sent the Card
varsity gridders through an hour
long scrimmage in preparation for
Saturday's rough battle with the j
Santa ClarS Broncos.
No major mishaps occurred dur
ing the scrimmage, although right :
end Bruce Van Alstyne was !
knocked out cold for a short pe
riod.
The Card freshmen provided the |
defense for the great variety of var- 1
sity running and passing plays, j
Halfback Rupe Andrews again
looked good on end runs, and Bud |
Klein's cuts and slices off tackle had |
the frosh completely fooled.
Meanwhile, the jayvees were run- j
ning Santa Clara plays against the j
first-string defensive unit, and ran |
the Bronc plays almost too well. !
Huge chunks of yardage were reeled 1

off by the slick jayvees, both on end
runs and plays down the middle.
The defensive team, however, was
minus first - string halfbacks Ken
Peck and Davy Field, both of whom
I are out with slightly injured backs,
i Peck and Field are expected to be
ready for the Bronco tussle Satur
, day. Both defensive stars were in
j uniform today — but for exercising
purposes, not for contact work.
