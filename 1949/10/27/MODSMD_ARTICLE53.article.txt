# Mural Volleyball Schedule Changed
## 
### 
Ray Dean, the genial assistant
head of intramurals, made some
changes, announcements, and proc
| lamations today.
The change, which he wanted
I called to the attention of all mural
| managers, was that henceforth
| "there will be only one volleyball
game scheduled on each court rath
er than the two as previously sched
uled." This, Dean pointed out, will
; make a change in days for all re-
I maining games. "Intramural mana-
I gers wiil please check the board for
| new days and new time schedules."
Dean also pointed out that all sec
ond-round matches in minor sports
must be played off by this Friday
afternoon. /
