# Residents Dine at Home In Luxurious Surroundings
## 
### 
Chief chef Benton Sorrell and his 16 assistants turned out their
18th consecutive meal in Stern Hall kitchen this morning, and
from all appearances, the hard luck days are over. For residents
of the hall, reading their morning paper over a breakfast of cereal,
oranges, bacon, and snails, the walk to Encina Commons and

long meal lines is just a bad |
memory.
Miss Mary Van Allen, dining hall j
director, still has her lingers crossed.
Remembering the day of the four- -j
foot flood and the four-day shut j
down because of lack of steam, she !
said cautiously, "We only live from j
meal to meal."
Chef Sorrell and his crew, aided !
by 31 mashers at meal time, work in j
spacious quarters with modern
kitchen facilities. Each department
has its own nook or room — the
bakery, butcher shop, salads, des
serts.
THE KITCHEN SINK
The only thing fastened down in
j the huge kitchen is the sink. All
j other apparatus is movable so a
! change in the layout can be made, |
come the time when they build an- i
other unit like Stern on the other I
I side of the kitchen.
Objects of the cooks' delight are
| the mechanical potato peeler and
j meat slieer, the walk-in refrigera-
I tors and deep freeze, and the ice
j boxes for salads, which open from
; both sides. The soup is still stirred I
with a paddle, however.
Food supplies are kept in the large
basement of the kitchen, which be- j
came flooded a few days before the
kitchen was scheduled to open.
I Supplies are taken up and down in |
j an elevator. Five rooms near the I
kitchen are available to some of the
J stall members for living quarters.
330 SERVED
The hashers have a spacious {
locker room and a dining hall of ]
; their own, as do the cooks. The |
j dishwashers roll racks of dishes into '
j the dishwashing machine on port- I
: able carriages.
Three hundred thirty students. 100
of them from Crothers or off cam- |
pus, are served in two meal lines.
A spring tray loader pops the meal
1 trays up one by one, as the diners
j start through the line. They are
' served from electrically-heated food
I tables which can be individually
controlled for temperature, a change

from the steam tables used in other
halls.
The whole dining unit was con
structed with possible table service
in mind. Diners eat in colorful,
soundproof rooms from tables both
round and square. Miss Van Allen
keeps fresh Mowers on each table.
The latest dignitaries to be served
at Stern were Judge George E.
Crothers, prominent alumnus;
Frank B. Henderson, former U.S.
Senator from Nevada; and Dean
Carl B. Spaeth of the Stanford Law
School, who dined there last night.
Miss Van Allen is a graduate of
Baldwin-Wallace College at Berea,
Ohio. She comes to Stanford from
a dining room position at Oborlin
College. Her assistant is Miss Doro
thy Banghart, who studied dietetics
at Stanford Lane Hospital in San
Francisco.

at Stanford Lane Hospital in San
Francisco.
Chief chef Benton Sorrell and his 16 assistants turned out their
18th consecutive meal in Stern Hall kitchen this morning, and
from all appearances, the hard luck days are over. For residents
of the hall, reading their morning paper over a breakfast of cereal,
oranges, bacon, and snails, the walk to Encina Commons and

long meal lines is just a bad |
memory.
Miss Mary Van Allen, dining hall j
director, still has her lingers crossed.
Remembering the day of the four- -j
foot flood and the four-day shut j
down because of lack of steam, she !
said cautiously, "We only live from j
meal to meal."
Chef Sorrell and his crew, aided !
by 31 mashers at meal time, work in j
spacious quarters with modern
kitchen facilities. Each department
has its own nook or room — the
bakery, butcher shop, salads, des
serts.
THE KITCHEN SINK
The only thing fastened down in
j the huge kitchen is the sink. All
j other apparatus is movable so a
! change in the layout can be made, |
come the time when they build an- i
other unit like Stern on the other I
I side of the kitchen.
Objects of the cooks' delight are
| the mechanical potato peeler and
j meat slieer, the walk-in refrigera-
I tors and deep freeze, and the ice
j boxes for salads, which open from
; both sides. The soup is still stirred I
with a paddle, however.
Food supplies are kept in the large
basement of the kitchen, which be- j
came flooded a few days before the
kitchen was scheduled to open.
I Supplies are taken up and down in |
j an elevator. Five rooms near the I
kitchen are available to some of the
J stall members for living quarters.
330 SERVED
The hashers have a spacious {
locker room and a dining hall of ]
; their own, as do the cooks. The |
j dishwashers roll racks of dishes into '
j the dishwashing machine on port- I
: able carriages.
Three hundred thirty students. 100
of them from Crothers or off cam- |
pus, are served in two meal lines.
A spring tray loader pops the meal
1 trays up one by one, as the diners
j start through the line. They are
' served from electrically-heated food
I tables which can be individually
controlled for temperature, a change

from the steam tables used in other
halls.
The whole dining unit was con
structed with possible table service
in mind. Diners eat in colorful,
soundproof rooms from tables both
round and square. Miss Van Allen
keeps fresh Mowers on each table.
The latest dignitaries to be served
at Stern were Judge George E.
Crothers, prominent alumnus;
Frank B. Henderson, former U.S.
Senator from Nevada; and Dean
Carl B. Spaeth of the Stanford Law
School, who dined there last night.
Miss Van Allen is a graduate of
Baldwin-Wallace College at Berea,
Ohio. She comes to Stanford from
a dining room position at Oborlin
College. Her assistant is Miss Doro
thy Banghart, who studied dietetics
at Stanford Lane Hospital in San
Francisco.
