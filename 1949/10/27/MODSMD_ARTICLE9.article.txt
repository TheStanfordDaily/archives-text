# Nixon to Address future Lawyers
## Legislator Reviews House Cases in Mem Aud Today 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Congressman Richard Nixon, member of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee, will present The Case for Congres
sional Investigating Committees" to Law School students and
faculty in Memorial Auditorium at 10 this morning.
Before the talk Nixon will meet members of the Stanford fac-

ulty at an informal coffee hour in
the lobby of the Union at 9 a.m.
Nixon will be introduced by Dean
Carl 13. Spaeth of the Law School
and Lewis Fenton, president of Mil
ler Inn of Phi Delta Phi, legal fra
ternity, which is sponsoring the pro
gram.
Congressman Nixon, junior Re
publican member of the committee,
is touring California discussing the
results of the committee's investiga
tions during the last session of Con
gress. He will explain how the com
mittee was able to assist the De
partment of Justice in indicting Al
ger Hiss for perjury in connection
with the famous "Pumpkin Papers"
found on Whitaker Chambers' farm
in Maryland.
COPLON TRIAL
The committee also assisted in
convicting Judith Coplon in the
espionage trial in New York. Nixon
will comment on the conviction of
the 11 top Communists in New York
as well as upon Judge Medina's de
cision.
Other anti-Communist prosecu
tions such as that of Harry Bridges,
president of the Longshoremen's
Union, and the case of the 10 Holly
wood writers now pending in the
federal courts will be discussed.
Nixon, an honor student at Duke
University Law School, and for
merly a practicing attorney in Cali
fornia, represents the 12th Congres
sional District in Los Angeles Coun
ty. He defeated former Rep. Jerry
Voorhis in the 1946 election. He has
been mentioned as the possible Re
publican nominee for the Senate
seat of Sheridan Downey.
In answering much of the criti
cism that has been leveled at the
Un-American Activities Committee,
Nixon has emphasized three funda
mental considerations which he feels
make his committee essential at this
time.
First, the committee was organ
ized to write legislation to prevent
the expansion of Communist activ
ities in the United States. As a re
sult, the Mundt-Nixon Bill was
passed by the House of Represen
tatives in an effort to direct the
glare of newspaper publicity upon
Communist activities.
WATCHDOG DUTY
Srcond. the committee has served
as "watchdog" over federal agencies
entrusted with the duty of enforcing
anti-espionage laws. Through this
function, the committee was able to
uncover the activities of Alger Hiss,
trusted adviser to the late President
Roosevelt and confidante of states
men and Supreme Court justices.
Third, the committee has kept the
American public informed of the in
ner workings of Communist efforts
to infiltrate American labor and
schools.
Nixon will also comment on
changes in committee function and
policy since such public figures as
Rep. Martin Dies of Texas, Rep.
John Rankin of Mississippi, and
Rep. J. Parncll Thomas of New Jer
sey have ceased to be members.
