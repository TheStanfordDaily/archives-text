# U.S. Communists Willing To Support Cause -- Nixon
## Congressman Speaks Here 
### JIM THURBER 
The Communists in the United
States are willing to do anything
to support their cause, even es
pionage with the definite chance
j of exposure, Congressman Rich
| ard Nixon, member of the House
Jn-American Activities Commit
tee, told law students and faculty
yesterday.
"The Communists thoroughly and
honestly believe in the principles of
their party," Nixon continued. "All
but two of them charged with es-
I pionage by Elizabeth Bentley were
born in the United States, and not
one of them received any money
for his work.
"Although their numbers are
small, they arc able, smart, college
trained people."
In his lecture on the problems of
I congressional investigating eommit

tees, Nixon used the Alger Hiss per
jury trial as an example of the exe
cution of the duties ot congressional
committees.
These committees have three main
functions, he said.
1. To conduct hearings to deter
mine what kind of legislation Con
gress should enact.
2. To supervise and act as a check
and balance on the administrative
branches of the government. This is
important, as an administrative
branch is unwiljing to investigate
To keep informed as
to what is going on. This is often
considered as one of the most im
portant functions of congressional
committees.
These tfuties were well carried
out in the Alger Hiss investigation.
An amendment was added to the
Espionage Law changing the stat
ute of limitations tr> 10 years in
stead of the < riginal three. If this
had been in effect earlier. Hiss
could have been tried for espio
nage instead of perjury. As it was,
the time lapse between the arts of
espionage and the bringing of the
suit was beyond that allowed by

the existing law.
Hiss was not tried for treason be
cause he was not aiding an enemy
of the United States.
Furthermore, by means of the
trial, the public was informed that
where you have Communists in po
sitions of power, you have potential
traitors.
"The documents supposedly given
to Hiss by Chambers for transmis
sion to the various Communist rings
were of utmost importance to the
United States," Nixon said.
"Seven of them arc still so secret
that their disclosures might endan
ger the security of the United States.
Moreover, a foreign power having
any one page of tremendous assort
ment of documents would have been
able to break the American code at
any time."
Nixon went into the case history
of the Hiss trial, and described the
events leading up to the Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee investiga
tion.
He stressed the fact that his com
mittee handled the case, since the
FBI has no power to prosecute and
the Department of Justice was re
luctant to handle cases involving its
own administrative branches.

considered as one of the most im

committees.
These tfuties were well carried
out in the Alger Hiss investigation.
An amendment was added to the
Espionage Law changing the stat
ute of limitations tr> 10 years in
stead of the < riginal three. If this
had been in effect earlier. Hiss
could have been tried for espio
nage instead of perjury. As it was,
the time lapse between the arts of
espionage and the bringing of the
suit was beyond that allowed by

the existing law.
Hiss was not tried for treason be
cause he was not aiding an enemy
of the United States.
Furthermore, by means of the
trial, the public was informed that
where you have Communists in po
sitions of power, you have potential
traitors.
"The documents supposedly given
to Hiss by Chambers for transmis
sion to the various Communist rings
were of utmost importance to the
United States," Nixon said.
"Seven of them arc still so secret
that their disclosures might endan
ger the security of the United States.
Moreover, a foreign power having
any one page of tremendous assort
ment of documents would have been
able to break the American code at
any time."
Nixon went into the case history
of the Hiss trial, and described the
events leading up to the Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee investiga
tion.
He stressed the fact that his com
mittee handled the case, since the
FBI has no power to prosecute and
the Department of Justice was re
luctant to handle cases involving its
own administrative branches.
The Communists in the United
States are willing to do anything
to support their cause, even es
pionage with the definite chance
j of exposure, Congressman Rich
| ard Nixon, member of the House
Jn-American Activities Commit
tee, told law students and faculty
yesterday.
"The Communists thoroughly and
honestly believe in the principles of
their party," Nixon continued. "All
but two of them charged with es-
I pionage by Elizabeth Bentley were
born in the United States, and not
one of them received any money
for his work.
"Although their numbers are
small, they arc able, smart, college
trained people."
In his lecture on the problems of
I congressional investigating eommit

tees, Nixon used the Alger Hiss per
jury trial as an example of the exe
cution of the duties ot congressional
committees.
These committees have three main
functions, he said.
1. To conduct hearings to deter
mine what kind of legislation Con
gress should enact.
2. To supervise and act as a check
and balance on the administrative
branches of the government. This is
