# Student Colds, Rife at Start Of Quarter, Now Decreasing
## 
### 
Since the beginning of school, ap
proximately two-thirds of the stu
dent body have had colds, but this
i.s no more than usual, according to
Dr. George H. Houck, the director
of the Health Service.
At the present, acute respiratory
infections are less numerous and
less frequent than during the be
j ginning of school, Dr. Houck said.
He estimated that more than 50 per
cent but less than 75 per cent of the
j students have had colds.
Following general patterns, colds
i are at an all-time low during July
i and August, the health director ex
j plained.
At the beginning of school, there
is an outbreak of colds which
reaches its height around the third
week, and then recedcs. The colds
at this time are mild. The second
peak comes just after Christmas va
| cation. Thereafter, the number of
j colds steadily declines.
"This pattern is in accord with our
experience in previous years," said

I Dr. Houck.
When most of the students were
veterans, however, there were fewer
acute respiratory infections and
communicable diseases, said Dr.
Houck. As a result of military serv
ice and close contact with many
people, the veterans built up a high
degree of resistance to them.
Dr. Houck recommended the fol
lowing care for colds:
Get plenty of sleep, keep warm,
and avoid chilling. The student
should also drink two to four quarts
of fluid daily, and take two aspirin
tablets every four hours if needed
lo relieve aching and headache.
Gargling and spraying with anti
septics are usually useless because
neither one gets rid of the bacteria
or viruses in the membranes of the
j nose and throat.
If such complications as high fe
j ver, ear ache, persistent cough, or
nain in the chest or face arise, the
student should go to the Health
Service immediately.
