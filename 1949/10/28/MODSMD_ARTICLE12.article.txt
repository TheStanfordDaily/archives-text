### 
With more fuel accumulated now
than in previous years at this time,
the class of '53 is well on the way
to having the "best" Big Game Bon
fire yet. John Daggett, bonfire chair
man, said yesterday.
Working Monday and Thursday
afternoons, groups of freshmen have
Collected wood from torn - down
houses, junk piles, lumber yards,
and housing developments.
Dried-up Lake Lagunita is grad
ually being tilled by the telephone
poles, packing boxes, brush, and
sundry old lumber, and there's more
to come, Daggett said.
Al! available sources are being
canvassed to get materials for the
annual conflagration. This year's
plan calls for the biggest Big Game
Bonfire in the history of Stanford,
40 feet high and 80 to 100 feet across,
the chairman boasted.
Actual construction on the "Bear
incinerator" will begin soon.
