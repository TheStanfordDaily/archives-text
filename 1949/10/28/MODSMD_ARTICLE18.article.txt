# AWS Gives Women's Living Groups A One-Thirty Closing Each Quarter
## 
### 
Each women's living group will be |
allowed one night every quarter
when they may remain open until
one-thirty with no signing out fol
iate leaves required until that time,
AWS Cabinet decided yesterday
afternoon.
Houses which wish to remain open ;
until 1:30 more than once during
the quarter may petition to Worn- J
en's Council. Women who wish to
take 2:30 late leaves the same night
do not have to sign out for them
until 1:30 under the above rule.
This is approximately the same
idea set up under the lockout sys
tem. The problem brought up by j
Women's Council Chairman Eloise I

Beil was whether or not to require
the women to sign out for a late
leave the night that the house was
to remain open until 1:30. It was
.decided that she docs not have to
sign out.
Another matter discussed at
Cabinet meeting yesterday was
whether to count partial assess
ments in women's houses for social
activities as regular assessments
which require a three-fourths vote
of house members. A committee was
set up to investigate this problem.
The planning group for the Gai
eties refreshment committee was
also released. Members are Jean
Bridenbaugh, Barbara Thompson,
Alice Hubeer, and Sally Beach.
