CLEVELANDâ€”Leftist labor lead
er Harry Bridges hinted tonight of
a peace overture aimed at narrowing
the breach between his Longshore
men's Union and the CIO in advance
of the CIO convention.
It was the second apparently con
ciliatory move by a left-wing CIO
affiliate threatened with expulsion
at the convention here next week.
The other was by the United Elec
trical Workers.
