# Cards Chosen Over Broncos
## Indian Gridders Given 12 Points Over Visitors in Tomorrow's Clash 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Santa Clara's unpre'dictable Broncos, the upset kings of the Pa
cific Coast, invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow at 2:30 to battle
Coach Marchie Schwartz's determined Redmen, who are seeking
revenge against their perennially tough neighbors.
Strangely enough, the Indians are the odds-makers' choice to

Twin the mythical Peninsula cham
pionship by 12 points. The Broncoc-,
liowever, like the underdog's ni
as witnessed by their 14 to 0 upris
ing against the previously unde
feated UCLA Bruins two Saturdays
■ ago.
A crowd of 50,000 is expocted to
be on hand to see the dark horse
Rose Bowl candidate meet the top
independent eleven of the Coast.
ROUGH GAME EXPECTED
Stanford, ty no means, is taking
this important game lightly. Coach
Schwartz this week has been send
i ing the team through long, rough
scrimmages to get the Indians men
tally and physically in top shape
for the Bronc battle tomorrow.
Hustle and pep have been the or
der of the day for the Cards in both
offensive and defensive drills this
past week.
Down at Santa Clara, Coach Len
Casanova is prepping his men for a
grueling tilt tomorrow, and there's
no denying that the Santa Clarans
will also be "high" for the tradi
tional game.
INJURIES HIT BOTH TEAMS
However, both teams have been
I hard hit by injuries to key players.
Card linemen Dick Abraham and
Wes Poulson will definitely be out,
while rugged Russ Pomeroy may see
limited action against the Bronc
charges.
Halfbacks Ken Peck and Dave
Field have been unable to scrim
mage this past week. Both men,
however, are slated to start in their
defensive secondary positions, with
the all-important task of breaking
up Santa Clara's superior pass game.
In addition, sophomore end Jack
Rye, who has been out all week with
a lingering cold, is on the question
able list. In case Rye is unable to
play, A 1 Laakso may have to fill
in on both offense and defense.
INJURED TACKLES TO START
The Broncos' first-string tacklc
Tom Payne and John Hock, hot]
missed the Loyola contest last wee'
end, and missed scrimmage thi
week. Coach Casanova, howeve:
lists both men as starters.
Hall Haynes, considered o
the best running backs on the Coas .
received a back injury in the ru~ r ec
Loyola fracas last Sunday, but it's
a good bet that he will be in there
tomorrow, doing his best to make it
three straight for the Santa Clarans.
The Broncos, this season, have n 1
played one game according to pre
game expectations. They lost to
California by two touchdowns in
the season's opener, in a game th t
was rated a tossup.
14 TO 13 OVER SPARTANS
Next the Broncs eked out a 14 to
13 victory over a San Jose teorr
! that had been slaughtered by Sta. -
j ford, 49 to 0, the week before.
Rated a two-touchdown favorite
over Fresno State, Santa Clara sud
denly opened up and trounced the
Fresnans, 53 to 0. The next Satur
day they won an unspectacular two
touchdown win over Portland,
which set the stage for the surpris
ing upset of the UCLA Bruins.
Last Sunday, the Broncos were
cool again, as they staved off a last
half Loyola threat to win, 27 to 19.
Will they be hot again tomorrow?


RUPE ANDREW'S
—First-string starter
That is what 50,000 people are com
ing out to see.
ANDREWS SPARKLES
Halfback Rupe Andrews, who
leads the Indian ball carriers in
yards gained per carry, has spar
kled in scrimmages this week, and
wil! probably see plenty of action
tomorrow.
Bill DcYoung, who has a slight
case of water on the knee, will al
ternate with the Cards' powerful
veteran Emery Mitchell at the full
back spot.

Big Bill McCoLl will again fill in
at the defensive right tackle posi
j tion, which was weakened by the
j loss of Wes Poulson two weeks ago;

| .
Reserve center Gordon Rice was
given the outstanding lineman of
j the week award for his showing
in last Saturday's game with the
Oregon State Beavers.

McColl will also take a turn at
left end, though A 1 Laakso is slated
to start at the wing position.
Gary Kerkorian, Stanford's slick
soph quarterback, will run the In
dians' T formation from the quar
terback spot, for the third straight
week.

grueling tilt tomorrow, and there's
no denying that the Santa Clarans
will also be "high" for the tradi
tional game.
INJURIES HIT BOTH TEAMS
However, both teams have been
I hard hit by injuries to key players.
Card linemen Dick Abraham and
Wes Poulson will definitely be out,
while rugged Russ Pomeroy may see
limited action against the Bronc
charges.
Halfbacks Ken Peck and Dave
Field have been unable to scrim
mage this past week. Both men,
however, are slated to start in their
defensive secondary positions, with
the all-important task of breaking
up Santa Clara's superior pass game.
In addition, sophomore end Jack
Rye, who has been out all week with
a lingering cold, is on the question
able list. In case Rye is unable to
play, A 1 Laakso may have to fill
in on both offense and defense.
INJURED TACKLES TO START
The Broncos' first-string tacklc
Tom Payne and John Hock, hot]
missed the Loyola contest last wee'
end, and missed scrimmage thi
week. Coach Casanova, howeve:
lists both men as starters.
Hall Haynes, considered o
the best running backs on the Coas .
received a back injury in the ru~ r ec
Loyola fracas last Sunday, but it's
a good bet that he will be in there
tomorrow, doing his best to make it
three straight for the Santa Clarans.
The Broncos, this season, have n 1
played one game according to pre
game expectations. They lost to
California by two touchdowns in
the season's opener, in a game th t
was rated a tossup.
14 TO 13 OVER SPARTANS
Next the Broncs eked out a 14 to
13 victory over a San Jose teorr
! that had been slaughtered by Sta. -
j ford, 49 to 0, the week before.
Rated a two-touchdown favorite
over Fresno State, Santa Clara sud
denly opened up and trounced the
Fresnans, 53 to 0. The next Satur
day they won an unspectacular two
touchdown win over Portland,
which set the stage for the surpris
ing upset of the UCLA Bruins.
Last Sunday, the Broncos were
cool again, as they staved off a last
half Loyola threat to win, 27 to 19.
Will they be hot again tomorrow?

ANDREWS SPARKLES
Halfback Rupe Andrews, who
leads the Indian ball carriers in
yards gained per carry, has spar
kled in scrimmages this week, and
wil! probably see plenty of action
tomorrow.
Bill DcYoung, who has a slight
case of water on the knee, will al
ternate with the Cards' powerful
veteran Emery Mitchell at the full
back spot.

Big Bill McCoLl will again fill in
at the defensive right tackle posi
j tion, which was weakened by the
j loss of Wes Poulson two weeks ago;

Reserve center Gordon Rice was
given the outstanding lineman of

in last Saturday's game with the
Oregon State Beavers.

McColl will also take a turn at

The Broncos, this season, have n 1
played one game according to pre
game expectations. They lost to
California by two touchdowns in
the season's opener, in a game th t
was rated a tossup.
14 TO 13 OVER SPARTANS
Next the Broncs eked out a 14 to
13 victory over a San Jose teorr
! that had been slaughtered by Sta. -
j ford, 49 to 0, the week before.
Rated a two-touchdown favorite
over Fresno State, Santa Clara sud

Fresnans, 53 to 0. The next Satur
day they won an unspectacular two
touchdown win over Portland,
which set the stage for the surpris
ing upset of the UCLA Bruins.
Last Sunday, the Broncos were
cool again, as they staved off a last
half Loyola threat to win, 27 to 19.
Will they be hot again tomorrow?

ANDREWS SPARKLES
Halfback Rupe Andrews, who
leads the Indian ball carriers in
yards gained per carry, has spar
kled in scrimmages this week, and
wil! probably see plenty of action
tomorrow.
Bill DcYoung, who has a slight
case of water on the knee, will al
ternate with the Cards' powerful
veteran Emery Mitchell at the full
back spot.

Big Bill McCoLl will again fill in
at the defensive right tackle posi

j loss of Wes Poulson two weeks ago;

Reserve center Gordon Rice was
given the outstanding lineman of
j the week award for his showing
in last Saturday's game with the
Oregon State Beavers.

McColl will also take a turn at
left end, though A 1 Laakso is slated
to start at the wing position.
Gary Kerkorian, Stanford's slick
soph quarterback, will run the In

Santa Clara's unpre'dictable Broncos, the upset kings of the Pa
cific Coast, invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow at 2:30 to battle
Coach Marchie Schwartz's determined Redmen, who are seeking
revenge against their perennially tough neighbors.
Strangely enough, the Indians are the odds-makers' choice to

Twin the mythical Peninsula cham
pionship by 12 points. The Broncoc-,
liowever, like the underdog's ni
as witnessed by their 14 to 0 upris
ing against the previously unde
feated UCLA Bruins two Saturdays
■ ago.
A crowd of 50,000 is expocted to
be on hand to see the dark horse
Rose Bowl candidate meet the top
independent eleven of the Coast.
ROUGH GAME EXPECTED
Stanford, ty no means, is taking
this important game lightly. Coach
Schwartz this week has been send
i ing the team through long, rough
scrimmages to get the Indians men
tally and physically in top shape
for the Bronc battle tomorrow.
Hustle and pep have been the or
der of the day for the Cards in both
offensive and defensive drills this
past week.
Down at Santa Clara, Coach Len
Casanova is prepping his men for a
grueling tilt tomorrow, and there's
no denying that the Santa Clarans
will also be "high" for the tradi
tional game.
INJURIES HIT BOTH TEAMS
However, both teams have been
I hard hit by injuries to key players.
Card linemen Dick Abraham and
Wes Poulson will definitely be out,
while rugged Russ Pomeroy may see
limited action against the Bronc
charges.
Halfbacks Ken Peck and Dave
Field have been unable to scrim
mage this past week. Both men,
however, are slated to start in their
defensive secondary positions, with
the all-important task of breaking
up Santa Clara's superior pass game.
In addition, sophomore end Jack
Rye, who has been out all week with
a lingering cold, is on the question
able list. In case Rye is unable to
play, A 1 Laakso may have to fill
in on both offense and defense.
INJURED TACKLES TO START
The Broncos' first-string tacklc
