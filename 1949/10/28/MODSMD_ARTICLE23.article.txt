# Nehru to Appear In San Francisco
## 
### RUSTAM D. LALKALA 
On Sunday the Bay Area footlights will focus on the figure of
an elderly man, a cultured patriot with a Cambridge accent, lu
minous eyes, and a magnetic smile. The following day San Fran
cisco will have the opportunity of listening to him.
This man, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India.

today commands the love of 350
million of his countrymen and the
admiration of the world.
One can understand the panic of
some Americans at the arrival of
any foreign minister or diplomat.
"Must be for another loan!" Nehru
has come not for another loan, but
"to strengthen the growing ties of
friendship between America and
India." We do have something in
common. . America is playing a role
of leadership in the West which
Nehru's India will soon play in the
East.
INSPIRING PERSON
Nehru has virtually no competitor
for the title "most charming head of
state in the world." You leave liis
presence like a battery from a
charging station.
This man has captured the hearts
of his people. They love him and,
yet, often they cannot understand
him. For Nehru has his feet shoved
into the earth of the East, and his
head stuck up into the clouds of tin*
West.
Educated at Harrow and Cain
bridge, he wears American clothes
and is probably more comfortable
with his English than with his Hin
dustani. As he himself has said: "I
have become a queer mixture of the
East and the West; out of place
everywhere, at home nowhere."
OTHER REQUIREMENTS
Unfortunately for the Pandit, he
has to be judged not as a charming
individual but as the head of the
second most populous state in the
world. What the situation in India
requires is not the charm of a Nehru
but the political mastery of a Roose
velt and the ruthless core of a Lenin.
Sharing F.D.R.'s capacity for in
spiring his supporters, the Pandit
has greater difficulty in harnessing
their power. His enemies accuse him
of allowing himself to be dominated
by the die-hards and capitalists of
the Indian Congress, of having be
trayed the masses for whom once
he fought so well.
Yet it is remarkable how much
Nehru has achieved within the short
span of two years. Communal strife
in India has ended; the feudal
princely states are abolished. Huge
schemes are under way for the

erection of steel and aluminum
plants, cement and paper mills, and
factories for the manufacture of
automobiles and planes.
NEHRU COURAGEOUS
Jawaharlal is loved iri India not
so much for his brilliance, perhaps
not for his political sagacity, but for
his broad appealâ€”the human touch.
In all Indian homes they tell stories
of his daring and courage, of his
youthful enthusiasm and impetuos
ity.
During the communal riots in
Delhi, Nehru rushed about in a jeep
directing operations. It is difficult to
visualize Harry Truman or Clement
Attlee doing that.
Some weeks bpick children from
a school in Japan wrote saying that
they had never seen an elephant.
Promptly the Prime Minister sent
them one- "a gift from India to the
children of Japan."
At international conferences in
India, Nehru can be seen adjusting
microphones, laying tablecloths, and
ushering guests.
