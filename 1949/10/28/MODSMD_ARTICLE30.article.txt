# Stanford Village Once Was Site Of Miracles by Army's Surgeons
## 
### RALPH HANDY 
Stanford Village has undergone
quite a change since the wartime
years when it was the Army's 2,775-
bed Dibble General Hospital. The
body is the same, but the features
are considerably altered.
In 1943, expanding its Pacific
Coast hospital facilities to care for
the heavy casualties of the Pacific
Theater, the government took over
120 acres of the old Timothy Hop
kins Estate. In February, 1944, after
the expenditure of some $5,000,000,
the installation was ready to receive
its first patients.
Named in honor of Colonel John
Dibble, one of the first army medical
officers to lose his life in World War
11, the hospital was formally dedi
cated on March 2, 1944.
PLASTIC SURGERY
Here, in what is now a huge Uni
versity residence, the army estab
lished one of the eight plastic sur
gery centers in the nation. Wounded
men came from the Pacific theater,
and at Dibble mere humans per
formed miracles in repairing what—
one war past—would have been re
garded as hopeless cases.
Using new techniques and devel
oping newer ones as they went
along, army medicos did their best
to repair war's damage.
Vocational and avocational re
habilitation played a large role in
the program, too, for without men
tal health the work of even the finest
surgeon is practically wasted.
Dibble was also set up as one of
two army blind centers dealing not
only with surgical treatment of in
jured eyes, but with instruction in
Braille and vocational rehabilita
tion for servicemen hopelessly
sightless. A familiar sight on the
streets of Palo Alto were the pairs

of Dibble patients, one with band
aged eyes, the other, seeing, but
often using a crutch.
RED CROSS TRAINS
Long trains of olive green Pull
mans with their vivid red crosses on
white squares soon became an
everyday sight to Peninsula resi
dents. Temporarily gone were the
days of rooters 1 specials and trains
of holiday-bound students. By the
time of Dibble's closing the patients
totaled 16,268.
The last patients were either dis
charged or transferred to other hos
pitals by June 15, 1946. By June 30,
the army had closed its affairs and
the few remaining administrative
personnel were shipped out.
Stanford, during that summer of
1846, was preparing to welcome the
largest student body in its history
for the autumn quarter. Attendant
with this expected record enroll
ment were a number of problems,

not the least of which was housing.
In the light of this, the late Presi
dent Tresidder gambled on being
able to secure the defunct Dibble
from the government in order to use
it as a University residence. The
gamble paid off, and on August 1,
194G, the Federal Public Housing
Authority handed Dibble General
Hospital to Stanford University.
Under the agreement with the
FPHA, Stanford was to prepare
quarters for single students, while
the FPHA was to be responsible for
the alteration of wards into one
and two-room apartments for mar
ried students. Stanford is to bear
the cost of the Village's upkeep and
its eventual razing.
The name "Stanford Village"
evolved as a result of a Daily-spon
sored contest shortly after the Uni
versity acquired the property. The
name, which won a $25 prize for
Kenneth W. Herrick, won out over
such items as "Last Resort," "Stan
vetford," "Casa Adjunta de Stan
ford," and"The North Forty."
