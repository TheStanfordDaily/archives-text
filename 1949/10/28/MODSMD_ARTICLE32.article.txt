# Band Planning Elaborate Animated Stunts for Santa Clara, SC Games
## 
### 
The Stanford Band, looking ahead
to next week's trip to USC, will pre
sent its first moving half-time stunt
of the season at the Santa Clara
game tomorrow. The 80-piece band
has mapped out tentative formations
for the Coliseum appearance which
will follow the general theme of a
"Day on the Farm," and will con
sist of several animated movements.
Yesterday afternoon's rehearsals
revealed plans which call for a
smiling and a frowning jack o' lan

tren in tomorrow's game. Also on
the program will be a block "SC"
with a cross in honor of Santa Clara,
the letters "GIVE" in honor of the
Community Chest campaign, and a
giant Falo Alto rpdwood tree, as a
salute 1o Star lord rooters.
All half-time stunts are being co
ordinated with Rally Com so the
card stunts can supplement the for
mations of the band on the field.
The band is also scheduled to ap
pear tonight at the Santa Clara rally
in the Pavilion.
