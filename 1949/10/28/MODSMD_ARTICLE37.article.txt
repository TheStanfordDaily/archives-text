# Teeth in the Election Laws
## 
### 
Excom, al its meeting Wednesday niglit, took
action to end the farce that has been student
elections since expense accounts and elec
tioneering were first authorized two years ago.
Candidates are allowed election expense ac
counts of $10 for most offices and $15 for the
two top ASSU positions. All office-seekers
have been required to turn in expense accounts
to the election board telling how much of that
amount was actually spent, and how.
In effect, many candidates haven't bothered
to turn them in, and legally there wasn't much
Election Board could do about it.
Excom put real teeth into the election code
Wednesday night.
In the future a candidate who fails to turn in
an expense account will be referred to either
Men's or Women's Council with a recommen
dation that he be given five hours of labor at
the Con Home.
A three-man Election Judgment Board has

been organized to consider violations. If a can
didate is judged to have submitted an inaccur
ate account or exceeded his expense allowance
he will be referred to the appropriate Council.
Equally forceful regulations will go into ef
fect concerning election posters and the distri
bution of campaign material.
Posters of the type that defaced the campus
last year will not be allowed. Instead, bulletin
boards for this campaign material will be
placed at convenient spots on campus by the
Election Board, but only before final elections.
Handbills may be distributed only in living
groups.
These rules should cure most of the ailments
resulting from the allowance of campaign ex
penditures; they also channel electioneering
away from campus-defacing posters and into
more desirable forms.
Such regulations are necessary if electioneer
ing in student body elections is to be allowed
at all.
