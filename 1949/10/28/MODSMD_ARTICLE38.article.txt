Things have come to a pretty past. A pretty past
but a dismal future.
Stanford is about to lose one of its favorite tra
dition -that of the 90-cent dinner at Carlun's. It's
,id but true. That's because Lel'ty Bartlet, creator
<1 hamburger steak what am, green salad what am,
> u lie bread what am, and pie a la mode what am, is

not renewing his sub-lease and
i pullim: up steaks (sometimes
: pelled stakes) on Sunday.
The carved tables, juke box,
marble games, and beer will still
be there, but without Lefty's
sji nius on the food end, the old
place just won't be the same.
With Lefty at the helm, indiges
tion was never acute, it was al
ways beautiful.
Among other things, Lefty has
riven the college student the

lr;f price deal from Alaska to Lower California.
For ten cents less than a dollar you could get
;i dinner of veal cutlets or hamburger steak (with
onions heaped higher than a chronic Martini drink
er), barked up by garlic bread (bring your own life
savers), tremendous amounts of green salad, and a
couple of Joe Louis handfuls of French-fries. That's
the truth, so help me.
Besides that. Lefty serves the best berry pic a la
mode in this part of the world. Plenty of pie and
two scoops of vanilla for the same price as Chappie.
11 also serves coffee that is coffee, and in these
<i. \ of dishwater substitutes, it's a rare treat.
Lefty also had a habit of giving away 20 free din
iiei:; ' ach week to his customers. Any time a person
bought a meal he was presented with a ticket, and
if his number were drawn on Tuesday or Friday, he
was awarded a pair of Annie-O'akley New York cuts
complete with trimmings.
This was the kind of deal that I kept telling my
-1 II was too good to last, and so it didn't. So now I

yet great big puddles around my eyes thinking al:out
what will happen after he leaves.
The only consolation is that he may open a new
place of his own soon. In fact, Lefty told me last
night that he expects to be doing just that any day
now, and when he does, all of his regular specialties
will be continued.
That's enough for me—l'll be in line when the
doors first open.

More word on the dismal future takes lis down to
Dinah's where another tragic thing has happened.
Beer has been upped a nickel per, and there ain't
no more gong. Owner Eddie took these drastic steps
because people have lifted 20 of Dinah's atmosphere
lamps. This makes Eddie mad. So, mad Eddie ups
the price on beer and says no more bell.
There's a condition and a reward. When people
stop lifting lamps, the price will be dropped again
and the bell will ring.
Two drinks reward will be presented to anybody
who brings back a lamp (no questions asked) or
presents information leading to the capture of any
lamp. (Study lamps will not do and only original
Dinah's atmosphere lamps will be accepted.)
All I can say is that Stanford beer drinkers have
gone to the dawgs, but I may be barking up the
wrong tree. But, when persons start snitching lamps
instead of guzzling brew, it must signify something.
At any rate, if those lamps don't stop disappearing
and if Eddie stays mad, and if that nickel tariff re
mains intact, and if they (Bill, Suds, and Melba)
don't start kicking that gong around, L'Ommie's and
Rainor Oaks and other atmosphere opponents arc
going to get unusually busy.
Chile or no chile.

For those of you who were waiting for the word on
Big Game dating, you'll just have to wait a little
longer. As yet, I haven't been able to find a gurl
who isn't taken, but on Monday we'll get down to
business with all those remaining. Oink-oink.
