To the Editor:
I have read the letter of Mr. William W. Hunt's
in the Campus Opinion column of the Stanford Daily,
i'Yiday, October 21, and would like to clarify a point
til fact stated in that letter.
Mi Hunt stated that, "foreign students arc for
hiddfii by federal law to work and may only do so
under emergency circumstances."
Ft would be well to review the classifications of
•as under which foreign students may enter the
I t :u d States and may be present on our campus.
;i ie generally live types of visas: the student
\i.vi, the temporary visitor visa, the quota immi
grant vi a. non-quota visa (all nations of the Wcst
rn Hemisphere), non-quota professors, teachers,
and ministers.
There is no restriction on the gainful employment
with regard to (he last three classifications, in fact,
i'a\y arc expected to be self-supporting. The two
other classifications have ccrtain restrictions with
i '4ard to employment. The temporary visitor, visa
i ification ii-2, may not work unless specifically
lated on the visa that their purpose for entry into
t; United States entails an occupation during their
\ '-i( wheh would require remuneration. An example
of ihis would be a teacher's assistantship. It should
e recognized at this point, that even though a tcm-
I iary visitor's visa is granted, other than the speci

fied stated purpose, the individual may apply for
exemption from the restriction and such exemption
would in most cases be granted, if the purpose is
reasonable to the statement of application.
The student visa, classification 4-E, is restricted in
the following manner: a person granted a student
visa is considered, in fact must be, a full-time stu
dent, carrying a minimum of nine to JO units of
work on a full-time basis. Without reference to
units, an individual with such a visa may earn such
funds as necessary for living expenses, provided such
employment does not change the individual's classi
fication as a student. He may also work where it is
necessary as practical training under his occupation
as a student. Also, during the summer vacation when
the normal school year is interrupted, he may have
gainful occupation when he intends and docs return
to his normal study occupation during the next
school year. It should be remembered that under the
student visa, these three conditions of employment
are pi rmissive and must be applied for in writing,
stating the facts under which it is necessary to work.
I realize this letter is fairly lengthy, but I believe
that, the number of foreign students in our institu
tion, who are interested in their position as an alien
on our campus, requires a clear-cut statement of
facts to clarify the short statement made by Mr.
Hunt.

i'a\y arc expected to be self-supporting. The two
other classifications have ccrtain restrictions with
i '4ard to employment. The temporary visitor, visa
i ification ii-2, may not work unless specifically
lated on the visa that their purpose for entry into
t; United States entails an occupation during their
\ '-i( wheh would require remuneration. An example
of ihis would be a teacher's assistantship. It should
e recognized at this point, that even though a tcm-
I iary visitor's visa is granted, other than the speci

fied stated purpose, the individual may apply for
exemption from the restriction and such exemption
would in most cases be granted, if the purpose is
reasonable to the statement of application.
The student visa, classification 4-E, is restricted in
the following manner: a person granted a student
visa is considered, in fact must be, a full-time stu
dent, carrying a minimum of nine to JO units of
work on a full-time basis. Without reference to
units, an individual with such a visa may earn such
funds as necessary for living expenses, provided such
employment does not change the individual's classi
fication as a student. He may also work where it is
necessary as practical training under his occupation
as a student. Also, during the summer vacation when
the normal school year is interrupted, he may have
gainful occupation when he intends and docs return
to his normal study occupation during the next
school year. It should be remembered that under the
student visa, these three conditions of employment
are pi rmissive and must be applied for in writing,
stating the facts under which it is necessary to work.
I realize this letter is fairly lengthy, but I believe
that, the number of foreign students in our institu
tion, who are interested in their position as an alien
on our campus, requires a clear-cut statement of
facts to clarify the short statement made by Mr.
Hunt.

I have read the letter of Mr. William W. Hunt's
in the Campus Opinion column of the Stanford Daily,
i'Yiday, October 21, and would like to clarify a point
til fact stated in that letter.
Mi Hunt stated that, "foreign students arc for
hiddfii by federal law to work and may only do so
under emergency circumstances."
Ft would be well to review the classifications of
•as under which foreign students may enter the
I t :u d States and may be present on our campus.
;i ie generally live types of visas: the student
\i.vi, the temporary visitor visa, the quota immi
grant vi a. non-quota visa (all nations of the Wcst
rn Hemisphere), non-quota professors, teachers,
and ministers.
There is no restriction on the gainful employment
with regard to (he last three classifications, in fact,
i'a\y arc expected to be self-supporting. The two
other classifications have ccrtain restrictions with
