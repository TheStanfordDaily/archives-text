Stanford graduates who have
made names for themselves in the

anything at all?
John Steinbeck, class of '24, wrote
one story published in the "Stanford
Spectator" which strongly recalls
the sharp reality of "Grapes of
Wrath." Gertie, the main character,
decides to leave her Filipino hus

heads floating in the fire barrel in
which she bathed. She was the only
character in the story ever to at
tempt to take a bath.
