# SALVATIERRA HAVEN
## Women's Rest Home Relief For Ailing Stanford Coeds 
### PAT PAYNE 
On Salvatierra Street amid a
cluster of trees, is a prim, brown
shingled house, which proclaims
over its front door, "Women's Rest
Home." An institution unique
among universities, the rest home
provides free care to all Stanford
girls who may need it.
The home can accommodate up
to 10 girls with colds, poison oak,
or light infections, or those recuper
ating from more serious ailments.
The average duration of a girl's stay
is two and a half days, but cases
have been known to stay as long as
an entire quarter. Quiet is usually
maintained in the vicinity of the
home, but occasionally a group will
serenade, as does Hurlburt House
when one of its residents is ill.
Patients at the home must be ad
mitted and released by the Health
Service doctors who call regularly
once a day. Only registered Stan
ford women may he admitted; how
ever, a UCI-A girl was cared for
the weekend of that game. Usually
no callers except family members
arc allowed, although poison oak
victims may be freely visited. Like
the Health Service under which it
works, the care at the home is with
out charge, although certain medi
cines, such as penicillin, must be
paid for.
Nearly M) years ago, the present
rest home was built by a Stanford
student and his wife and used as
their private residence. The build
ing is still privately owned and is
rented by the Stanford Mothers'

j Club. Twenty-live years ago, be
i cause of overcrowded conditions at
the then-small Palo Alto Hospital,
the home was started by an inter
ested local resident.
It is now sponsored and supported
by the Mothers' Club which raises
money for it with two annual fetes.
One is scheduled for this Friday and
will feature a program and dessert
in the Frost Amphitheater. A Phmi
tom Party, for which tickets are sold
but which is never held, will pro
vide additional funds during the
spring quarter.
The home is directed by Mrs.
George H. Murray, a practical
nurse. Mrs. Murray was born and
raised on the Stanford campus, since
her father, a building contractor,
constructed many of the original
structures on the campus. Although
she did not attend the University
herself, her husband was a graduate.
Now a veteran of 10 years at the
home, she professes to find even
the serenades enjoyable.
