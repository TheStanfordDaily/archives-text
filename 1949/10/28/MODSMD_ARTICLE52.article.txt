# Stanford Research Works For U.S. National Defense
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
Stanford University today is
the center for nearly $1,400,000
worth of government-sponsored
research. Stanford believes that
such research is making a bet
ter University, as well as ac
complishing its own purpose.
The program began in the summer
of 194ti. Before that Stanford had
held government contracts for re
search. In the year 1941-42, how
ever, they only amounted to $78,-
205.42, as compared to the 1948-49
total of $1,383,155.84.
The reason for this sudden up
swing was the discovery made dui -
ing the war that the United States'
first line of defense is in the labora
tories. Work in pure theory, with
out ony thought of practical appli
cation, led to the atomic bomb. The
wartime Office of Scientific Re
search and Development, headed by
Dr. Vannevar Bush, was the first
agency to deal with this kind of
research.
By the time the Stanford program
was started, the functions of the
OSRD had been turned over to per
manent agencies such as the Office
of Naval Research in the Depart
ment of the Navy. The ONR is the
source of many of Stanford's con
tacts, including the one for the
atom-smasher now being con
structed in the microwave labora
tory.

The work being done at Stanford
is, of course, only a part of a na
tion-wide program, and many other
universities throughout the coun
try arc involved. The money is usu
ally supplied in the form of con
tracts which extend over a period
of several years.
Basic research is the keynote of
the program. The projects are not
undertaken with any definite, fore
seeable end in mind, and this fact
marks the difference between basic
and applied research. The govern
ment ties few strings to its money
fewer than most private industries
do when awarding research con
tracts.
The army and air force as well
as the navy are sources of Stan
ford's contracts and grants, as arc
the' Bureau of Standards, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, and the
U.S. Public Health Service. The
projects into which the money goes
vary as much as the agencies that

supply the money. A large share
| of these projects arc in the School
of Engineering.
RADIO RESEARCH
In electrical engineering, work is
i being done both with ultra-short
j waves and high frequencies and
1 with longer-wave radio, including
projects in radio navigation and ra
-1 clio telephony. New types of radio
| tubes arc being investigated, and
I the behavior of insulating materials
is (estcd in the Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory.
Mechanical engineering is a large,
inclusive field. There vibration
problems arc being tackled, and
work in heat transfer at supersonic
speeds. Theoretical mathematics
plays a large part in studies of air
craft design and of the behavior of
metals under loads. "Non-linear
mechanics 1 ' is a new and theoretical
field with a big future.
More study of metals is made in
the School of Mineral Sciences,
where experiments determine the
behavior of steel, alloys, and other
j materials at high temperatures.
Probably the best known of all
these research projects is the one
being carried on the microwave lab
oratory. The linear accelerator,

mentioned above, is a new type of
atom-smasher, and is expected to
open new fields in nuclear physics.
lONOSPHERE STUDY
Stanford operates, for the Bureau
of Standards, one of several sta
tions in the country for the study of
the ionosphere. The day-by-day
findings of these groups are put to
gether to form a world "weather
map" by which predictions can be
made of the probable efficiency of
various frequencies in transoceanic
radio signals.
Other groups arc working in
medicine and psychology, and there
are many projects in chemistry,
physics, engineering, mathematics,
and statistics.
Stanford, because of its size, is
well fitted to do this type of work.
Less pressure on the teaching staff,
due to the fact that the student body
is not oversized, means more oppor
tunity to do research and do it well.
But the University receives as many
benefits as it gives.
Under this program scientists can
choose the line of research they
wish most to pursue and pursue it
with complete freedom. Graduate
scientists take part in these proj
ects, and students can benefit from
the fact that Stanford is a center
for the advancement of knowledge
as well as its dissemination.

physics, engineering, mathematics,
and statistics.
Stanford, because of its size, is
well fitted to do this type of work.
Less pressure on the teaching staff,
due to the fact that the student body
is not oversized, means more oppor
tunity to do research and do it well.
But the University receives as many
benefits as it gives.
Under this program scientists can
choose the line of research they
wish most to pursue and pursue it
with complete freedom. Graduate
scientists take part in these proj

the fact that Stanford is a center
for the advancement of knowledge
as well as its dissemination.
Stanford University today is
the center for nearly $1,400,000
worth of government-sponsored
research. Stanford believes that
such research is making a bet
ter University, as well as ac
complishing its own purpose.
The program began in the summer
of 194ti. Before that Stanford had
held government contracts for re
search. In the year 1941-42, how
ever, they only amounted to $78,-
205.42, as compared to the 1948-49
total of $1,383,155.84.
The reason for this sudden up
swing was the discovery made dui -
ing the war that the United States'
first line of defense is in the labora
tories. Work in pure theory, with
out ony thought of practical appli
cation, led to the atomic bomb. The
wartime Office of Scientific Re
search and Development, headed by
Dr. Vannevar Bush, was the first
agency to deal with this kind of
research.
By the time the Stanford program
was started, the functions of the
OSRD had been turned over to per
manent agencies such as the Office
of Naval Research in the Depart
ment of the Navy. The ONR is the
source of many of Stanford's con
tacts, including the one for the
atom-smasher now being con
structed in the microwave labora
tory.

The work being done at Stanford
is, of course, only a part of a na
tion-wide program, and many other
universities throughout the coun
try arc involved. The money is usu
ally supplied in the form of con
tracts which extend over a period
of several years.
Basic research is the keynote of
the program. The projects are not
undertaken with any definite, fore
seeable end in mind, and this fact
marks the difference between basic
and applied research. The govern
ment ties few strings to its money
fewer than most private industries
do when awarding research con
tracts.
The army and air force as well
as the navy are sources of Stan
ford's contracts and grants, as arc
the' Bureau of Standards, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, and the
U.S. Public Health Service. The
projects into which the money goes
vary as much as the agencies that

supply the money. A large share
| of these projects arc in the School
of Engineering.
RADIO RESEARCH
In electrical engineering, work is
i being done both with ultra-short
j waves and high frequencies and
1 with longer-wave radio, including
projects in radio navigation and ra
-1 clio telephony. New types of radio
| tubes arc being investigated, and
I the behavior of insulating materials
is (estcd in the Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory.
Mechanical engineering is a large,
inclusive field. There vibration
problems arc being tackled, and
work in heat transfer at supersonic
speeds. Theoretical mathematics
plays a large part in studies of air
craft design and of the behavior of
metals under loads. "Non-linear
mechanics 1 ' is a new and theoretical
field with a big future.
More study of metals is made in
the School of Mineral Sciences,
where experiments determine the
behavior of steel, alloys, and other
j materials at high temperatures.
Probably the best known of all
these research projects is the one
being carried on the microwave lab
oratory. The linear accelerator,

mentioned above, is a new type of
atom-smasher, and is expected to
open new fields in nuclear physics.

the ionosphere. The day-by-day
findings of these groups are put to

oratory. The linear accelerator,

mentioned above, is a new type of
atom-smasher, and is expected to
open new fields in nuclear physics.
lONOSPHERE STUDY
Stanford operates, for the Bureau
of Standards, one of several sta
tions in the country for the study of
the ionosphere. The day-by-day
findings of these groups are put to
gether to form a world "weather
map" by which predictions can be
made of the probable efficiency of
various frequencies in transoceanic
radio signals.
Other groups arc working in
medicine and psychology, and there
are many projects in chemistry,
physics, engineering, mathematics,
and statistics.
Stanford, because of its size, is
well fitted to do this type of work.
Less pressure on the teaching staff,
due to the fact that the student body
is not oversized, means more oppor
tunity to do research and do it well.
But the University receives as many
benefits as it gives.
Under this program scientists can
choose the line of research they
wish most to pursue and pursue it
with complete freedom. Graduate
scientists take part in these proj
ects, and students can benefit from
the fact that Stanford is a center
for the advancement of knowledge
as well as its dissemination.
Stanford University today is
the center for nearly $1,400,000
worth of government-sponsored
research. Stanford believes that
such research is making a bet
ter University, as well as ac
complishing its own purpose.
The program began in the summer
of 194ti. Before that Stanford had
held government contracts for re
search. In the year 1941-42, how
ever, they only amounted to $78,-
205.42, as compared to the 1948-49
total of $1,383,155.84.
The reason for this sudden up
swing was the discovery made dui -
ing the war that the United States'
first line of defense is in the labora
tories. Work in pure theory, with
out ony thought of practical appli
cation, led to the atomic bomb. The
wartime Office of Scientific Re
search and Development, headed by
Dr. Vannevar Bush, was the first
agency to deal with this kind of
research.
By the time the Stanford program
was started, the functions of the
OSRD had been turned over to per
manent agencies such as the Office
of Naval Research in the Depart
ment of the Navy. The ONR is the
source of many of Stanford's con
tacts, including the one for the
atom-smasher now being con
structed in the microwave labora
tory.

The work being done at Stanford
is, of course, only a part of a na
tion-wide program, and many other
universities throughout the coun
try arc involved. The money is usu
ally supplied in the form of con
tracts which extend over a period
of several years.
Basic research is the keynote of
the program. The projects are not
undertaken with any definite, fore
seeable end in mind, and this fact
marks the difference between basic
and applied research. The govern
ment ties few strings to its money
fewer than most private industries
do when awarding research con
tracts.
The army and air force as well
as the navy are sources of Stan
ford's contracts and grants, as arc
the' Bureau of Standards, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, and the
U.S. Public Health Service. The
projects into which the money goes
vary as much as the agencies that

supply the money. A large share
| of these projects arc in the School
of Engineering.
RADIO RESEARCH
In electrical engineering, work is
i being done both with ultra-short
j waves and high frequencies and
1 with longer-wave radio, including
projects in radio navigation and ra
-1 clio telephony. New types of radio
| tubes arc being investigated, and
I the behavior of insulating materials
is (estcd in the Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory.
Mechanical engineering is a large,
inclusive field. There vibration
problems arc being tackled, and
work in heat transfer at supersonic
speeds. Theoretical mathematics
plays a large part in studies of air
craft design and of the behavior of
metals under loads. "Non-linear
mechanics 1 ' is a new and theoretical
field with a big future.
More study of metals is made in
the School of Mineral Sciences,
where experiments determine the
behavior of steel, alloys, and other
j materials at high temperatures.
Probably the best known of all
these research projects is the one
being carried on the microwave lab
oratory. The linear accelerator,

mentioned above, is a new type of
atom-smasher, and is expected to
