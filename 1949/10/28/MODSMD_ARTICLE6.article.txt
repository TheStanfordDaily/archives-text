# Nationalist Claims

### 
CHUNGKINGâ€”The Chinese Na-!
tionalists announced today they had !
killed 20,000 and captured 4,000
Communist troops who invaded
Chinmen Island, just east of Red
captured Amoy.
If correct, this would be the big
gest single Nationalist victory since
the fighting north of the Yangtze
last April.
Neutral observers believed that
the Nationalists had won some sort
of victory but probably not on the
scale described.
