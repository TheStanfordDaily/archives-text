# Cards, Bears, and Trojans Slated to Win, Say Pickers
## 
### 
How good can we get?
That's the question going the
rounds with the Daily's Peerless
Pickers this week after iust Satur
day's record.
The record itself was 12 out of 15
games but in so tailing, the Pickers
tabbed SMU over Kentucky. We
missed by calling WSC over UCLA
but felt very good when the Cou
gars led 14 to 0. Kansas over Okla
homa A&M was the other miss.
But this is the week we separate
the pickers from the guessers. We
call 20 games instead of 15 and they
are all tough. (Well, some of them
are.)
Stanford by 12 points, the bookies

say. Phooey, we say. This game
should be even all the way. Tht
Broncos boast the best tackles on the
Coast and an all-around tough line
to boot. But we shut our eyes
choose a number, and come up with:
Stanford by 9.
Cal can, must, and will do it. Beat
UCLA, of course. This could be
close and maybe we are letting
wishful thinking enter into the act
but we call: California by 13, unani
mous.
Homecoming, Smomecoming. In
Seattle Washington hosts the USC
Trojans. Stanford beat the Huskies
by 40 points but we only call: the
Trojans by 12. Unanimous again.
Oregon travels to meet lowa and
our lorm chart goes out of the Con
ference to pick lowa by 3. Four ol
eleven pickers stick by the Ducks.
Oregon State evidently didn't im
press the gang, for they turn on the
Beavers in their tilt with YVSC. Cou
gars by 10.
Harvard will win this week. Af
ter five losses in a row the Crimsons
will come through, we say. Harvard
Â»ver Iloly Cross by G.
It was a 7 to 4 vote but it now is
l sure thing. We tab Wisconsin over
Indiana in what may very well go
the other way. But; the Pickers are
Peerless. Wisconsin by
The next one is a puzzler. We
voted 10 to 1 to pick Idaho over
Portland. Who wa3 the lone dis
senter? Why, it was no less than the
'eader of the pack with a .750 aver
tge, Bob Bernstein. Anyway, Idaho
by 15.
Michigan over Illinois by IS
Montana over Montana State by !)
Minnesota over Purdue by 16
St. Mary's over Drake by 13
USF over Nevada by 14
Cornell over Columbia by 13
Notre Dame over Navy by 27
North Carolina over Tennessee by
11
Ohio State over Northwestern by
2
SMU over Texas by fi
Dartmouth over Yale by 1
College of Pacific over San Jose
by 13
