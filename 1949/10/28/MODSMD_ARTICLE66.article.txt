# Stanford Mermen Slate Two Games
## 
### 
The College of the Pacific Tigers
and the Olympic Club, two of the
most dangerous water polo teams in
the Bay Area, will meet Coach Tom
Haynie's Stanford mermen in non-
Conference games this weekend.
The COP Tigers tackle the Cards
at 3:30 this afternoon, while the
â€¢Winged "O" team from San Fran
cisco battles the locals at 10 a.m.
tomorrow morning.
The Olympic Club, led by their
ace forward. Ed PudalofT, riddled a
strung California water polo team,
11 to 8, earlier this v/eek, with Ru
dalofT personally scoring six goals.
Stanford dropped a 4 to 2 de
cision to the Bears last Saturday at
Berkeley, and now have a Confer
ence record of 1 win against 2 de
feats. However, a double win this
weekend over the two tough non-
Conference opponents, could defin
itely put the Cards back on the win
ning road.
Probable starters for Stanford in
clude: Ralph Sala, Bob Frojen, and
Don Weeden at forward; Ken Fox,
Ernie Polte, and Hub Stokely at
guards; and Kim Fletcher at goalie.
