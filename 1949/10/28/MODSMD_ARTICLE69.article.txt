# Sterling, Haynes, and Wraith Lead Rugged Broncos; Loss to California Only Mar on Santa Clara's Record
## Cardinals Hold Five-Game Advantag But Look for First Win in Three Yea 
### AL BERRY 
Santa Clara's booming Broncos, who seem to be able to bo
everybody but Cal, will be entertained tomorrow by what roote
hope will be a "high" Stanford eleven. The Broncs, who
lose their opener to the Bears, have been very unkind to the
Peninsula neighbors the last two years or so. In 1947 they mac

the Redshirts look, remarkably bad
by thudding them, 13-7, and last
season they made themselves look
remarkably good by handing the
Cards their second worst defeat of
the year, 27-14.
BLASTED UCLA
And to really top things off this
year, the Santa Clara team —for
orneriness' sake—blasted UCLA by
two touchdowns in the Coliseum.
It was the same UCLA team which
had disgraced Stanford the week
before.
Yep, the Indians have every right
to be "high" for this one. But, then,
so will the Broncs, who would
rather beat Stanford than go to
heaven.
Unfortunately for Stanford, San
ta Clara has, from a personnel
standpoint, a team that is capable
of winning tomorrow, if they man
age to get the proper number of
breaks, and fill the weaker chunks
in their squad. This is borne out by
the statistics of their UCLA suc
cess story. The Broncs, in that en
gagement, managed 16 first downs
to the Bruins' 3; they made 227
yards to 127, and completed 50 per
cent of their passes. In other words,
Santa Clara beat UCLA in every
department, including the score
board, which read 14-0.
The rundown of the Bronco per
sonnel goes this way:
HAYNES TOP BACK
Halfbacks—Hall Ilaynes, at left, is
truly one of the finest backs on the
Coast this year. Weighing 180, and
fast, Haynes was second in the na
tion in punting last year, getting
beat out by North Carolina's Jus
tice by one-half yard. His kicks
rate a consistent 40-plus yards every
; week. So far this season in the ball
carrying department, Haynes has
averaged 4.09 yards per carry and
has gained 373 yards in 78 attempts.
At the right halfback spot stands
i the very able replacement for Vein
Hare, who finally graduated last
year, a 180-pound lad named Gene
DeFilippis. DeFilippis is a fine run
ner, and holds down the blocking
assignments of the right half posi
tion like the 24-year-old senior vet
eran he is.
Fullback—Saxon Wraith, a 185-
pound junior from Chico, will prob
ably get the nod for the starting
line-buster post tomorrow. Wraith
is averaging a sturdy 5.86 yards per
carry this year, picking up 384 yards
in 65 carries. Only once this year
has the thundering Wraith been
thrown for a loss—for three yards
against Cal.
PASCO TO START
Quarterbacks —Here is the "crit
ical" spot in the Santa Clara eleven.
With the graduation of the three
senior pilots, A 1 Martin, Bill Sheri
dan, and Moe Chavez, Coach Len
Casanova has had to beat the bushes
for ql:s. And the two he came up
with, Johnny Pasco and Len Napo
lilano have lost only one ball game
for him this year, so must be labeled
at least sufficient. The starter
against Stanford tomorrow will
probably be Pasco who did most of
the duty work against the Bruins,
and batted .500 for that game.
Pasco and Napolitano have alter
nated hot and cold this year, but
one has always been "on" while the
other had his "of!" day. Stanford
rooters can hope that both of them

hit and "off day tomorrow, I
what will happen if both of tin
are "on?"
Ends The loss of All-Coaster 1
lery Williams has done great dai
age to the Broncos' pass-catehi
offense this year, but in the bloc
ing and tackling department t
present Santa Clara wingmen ;
more than slightly sufficient. I)
White, a 6-foot 1-inch youncst
from Seattle, and Monty Osbo
who stands 6 feet 2 inches, a sen
from Pasadena, were particulai
outstanding against UCLA. Lri
Johnson, who had a generally b
lime anyway, did riot make a 11
dime around the Bronco ends.
TACKLES HEALTHY
Tackles —Although plagued by i
juries in this position all year, tlu
is a disturbing rumor afoot that
Bronc tackles will be full of Ilea
when 2:30 tomorrow rolls aroui
If so, 204-pound Tom Payne (
relation) and 211-pound John Ho
may give trouble to Stanfor
speedy halfbacks. Both lads ;
seniors and are thus getting th
last crack at Stanford, which \\
make tomorrow's tussle extra apj
tizing—if they can win.
Guards—This, as any five-yej
old will tell you, is the Santa CI;
"Bingo, bank-night, extra-set-c
dishes, wow" position. Here, right
the center of things, will be t
Broncos' two game captains for t
morrow, 194 (plus)-pound Vt
Sterling, and 193-pound John I)
zanica from Redwood City. Mai
many words of flowing prose h;i
been penned about the rugged St(
ling whose center-smashing tact
were responsible for beaucoup 1
dian fumbles last year, and in I
long run responsible for beauco
Bronco touchdowns. Like the tac
les, both guards are seniors a
are getting their last "crack" at t
Big Red Machine.
Center—This position was or
thought to be a Bronco weak sp
what with the loss of the fine I
Renna and his replacement Mic 1,
Adza. But that was a pre-sea.
worry, today Coach Casanova smi
over his pivot spot and the reas
for his smiling is 197-pound J
Canelo, a senior from San Franci;
who has—as the sports scribes 112
it—"come through." Canelo is
good defensive linebacker and e
eels in carrying out his offensi
blocking assignments.
NINE SENIOR STARTERS
Thus, we have a word picture
the fighting Bronco squad t
Stanford fndians must face tome
row. They are a good, well-balanc
team, with only one first-game li
behind them. They want to bt
Stanford very badly. They ha
much experience, with nine of t
eleven starters seniors. They ha
great defensive strength in th
sterling Sterling-led line, and t
fine punting of 40-yard Hayn
Their offense has been good—th<
seniors have failed to score oi
twice in the three years they've c
vorted for the Santa Clara red a
white.
They are a very good football tea
and while they are not favored

deny they'll take a lot of beating
