## 
### DICK KLEIN 
With this one last hurdle standing
in the way before the Cal tilt, the
all-conquering Card freshman foot
ball machine will clash with the
willing but. weak San Jose State
souad tomorrow morning. Kickoff is
11:30.
The young Spartans boast a me
diocre record. Last weekend, the
Staters bb A a 4G to 20 decision to
USF, committing 11 fumbles in the
60-minutp time limit. With not too
much offensive strength, the Pa
pooses' powerful forward wall
shou'd attain turn the trick.
Two speedy scatbacks are the
main Spartan offensive threats.
Halfbacks Scarcey Miles and Wiley
McLain both scored on long break
away sprints against their last op
ponents. Miles on a 92-yard kick
off return, and McLlain tallied on a
(jfj-yard sprint around end on the
first play of the game.
This will be the frosh's fifth game
of the season. It could be their six
teenth victory in a row. The Pa
pooses have run up 79 points in
their four lilts, but have allowed
only a mere 33 markers for all the
opponents. Not one team has been
able to score more than 13.

Station KZSU will broadcast (he
Stanford Freshmen vs. San Jose
Stale Frosh football game tomor
row morning. AI Day will be at j
the microphone at 11:15 over SSO
kiloc voles.

No practice was held yesterday j
afternoon, as Coach Chuck Taylor
decided the team had worked hard
enough the first three days of the
week. "I thought I'd give the boys
a rest, and let them study a bit.
They're ready for the game."
In good physical shape, the Card
babes will reign as heavy favorites.
Only Skip Crist and Tommy Van
Sant will miss the Spartan contest.
Crist is still a probable for the "Lit
tle Big Game" next weekend, while
Van Sunt has developed an old mus
cle ache in the thigh. He may be
able to work a little bit on defense
tomorrow.
A new backfield combination will
be in for the kickoff. Al Peterson,
who has finally caught up after
missing some early action with an
injured leg, pets a starting call at
one of the halfback spots. The reg

ulars, Joe St. Geme, Dick Gargiulo,
and Tom Dragna, improving full
back, make up the top foursome.
Naturally looking ahead to their
biggey with the also undefeated
California freshmen next weekend,
the Papooses have an inside track
for their third straight mythical
freshman championship. About to
morrow's game, Taylor said, "We'll
have to play good ball and be up
mentally. We shouldn't have too
much trouble."

(jfj-yard sprint around end on the
first play of the game.
This will be the frosh's fifth game
of the season. It could be their six
teenth victory in a row. The Pa
pooses have run up 79 points in
their four lilts, but have allowed
only a mere 33 markers for all the
opponents. Not one team has been
able to score more than 13.

Station KZSU will broadcast (he
Stanford Freshmen vs. San Jose
Stale Frosh football game tomor
row morning. AI Day will be at j
the microphone at 11:15 over SSO
kiloc voles.

No practice was held yesterday j
afternoon, as Coach Chuck Taylor
decided the team had worked hard
enough the first three days of the
week. "I thought I'd give the boys
a rest, and let them study a bit.
They're ready for the game."
In good physical shape, the Card
babes will reign as heavy favorites.
Only Skip Crist and Tommy Van
Sant will miss the Spartan contest.
Crist is still a probable for the "Lit
tle Big Game" next weekend, while
Van Sunt has developed an old mus
cle ache in the thigh. He may be
able to work a little bit on defense
tomorrow.
A new backfield combination will
be in for the kickoff. Al Peterson,
who has finally caught up after
missing some early action with an
injured leg, pets a starting call at
one of the halfback spots. The reg

ulars, Joe St. Geme, Dick Gargiulo,
and Tom Dragna, improving full
back, make up the top foursome.
Naturally looking ahead to their
biggey with the also undefeated
California freshmen next weekend,
the Papooses have an inside track
for their third straight mythical
freshman championship. About to
morrow's game, Taylor said, "We'll
have to play good ball and be up
mentally. We shouldn't have too
much trouble."
