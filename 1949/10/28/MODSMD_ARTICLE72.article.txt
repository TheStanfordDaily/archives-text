# Golfers' Tourney Deadline Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day for golfers
to qualify for the University "win if
you lose" tournament, Coach Bud
Finger announced.
..To date, 20 aspirants have turned
in scores, with low being Culton
Ingram's 75. The highest score so
far is 122, but less experienced
players are urged to compete, if
only for the chance to play against
golfers.
Pairing off for the first round will
be made according to the qualifying
scores and will be posted at the pro
shop on Monday, Finger said.
