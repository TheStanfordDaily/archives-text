# Bookstore Has Colorful History
## Co-op Sees 52nd Year 
### DEAN HOLMAN 
Whether you are a new freshman
at Stanford or a veteran of many
quarters on the Farm you have un
doubtedly, already this quarter,
made use of the Stanford Bookstore.
In fact, wou probably made one or

j more of the 15,000 sales which took
place during the first week of the
[ quarter.
The Bookstore has been serving
i the Stanford Family since the
spring of 1897, and has grown with
the University from a $40,000 a year
business in 1900 to over a $0,000,000
I business in 1948.
In the few years following the
j opening of the University in 1891, a
I small book shop, run by students,
| was in operation in a shack located
] in front of the place where the main
j library now stands. The services of
| the little shop soon proved far in
! adequate for the needs of the school,
so in 1897 President Jordan appoint
ed a group of professors to investi
gate the situation.
$15,000 STOKE
The professors borrowed $15,000
' and built the first Stanford Book-
J store. It was located on the corner
where the Journalism Building now
stands. That original bookstore
building was moved several feet
west when the Journalism Building
was built, and is now known as the
Stanford Daily Shack.
The store soon outgrew the small
! building, and the board of directors
received permission to build a larger
building on the site of the store's
present location. The new building
was occupied in 1906, just two
months before the earthquake,
j Damage as the result of that dis
turbance consisted of a few cracked
I walls and a lot of fallen plaster.
There were two buildings then
i which now are one. The one in front.
I a single room, was the Bookstore.
| The one in back, separated from the
other by an alley, and where the
j Bookstore office now is, fronted on
\ Escondido Street and was a candy
| and ice cream store run by Ernest
j "Sticky" Wilson, who now owns a
similar business in Palo Alto. The
opposite end of this rear building,
I where the Bookstore stock room and
receiving department now are, was
then Green's Grocery Store.
GROWING PAINS
By 1929 the Bookstore was again
I pressed for room. The rear building
was leased from the University and
joined to the front building as it is

I now. At Ibis time the typewriter
| and general book departments were
added, and the stationery depart
i ment added more novelties.
Many things were once carried by
the store which arc not handled to
) day. For a time, toilet articles, mag
| azines, and gym clothes were once
J carried. Also, at one time, all grad
; uates had to buy their own caps and
i 'towns, and these were available at
' the Bookstore at prices ranging from
i $15 up, depending on the material.
Former University President Bran-
I ner ordered a silk one for which he
paid a modest $130.
BANKERS' HOURS
In 1914 the Bookstore provided
j space from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. for a
j representative of the Palo Alto Bank
(since bought out by the American
{ Trust Co.) to handle withdrawals
. and deposits, and to cash checks for
| the students. This service was dis
continued in 1917 bccause the ex
pense was too high.
It was decided at the outset that
the Bookstore, established "for the
| benefit of the faculty and students,"
: would be of the co-op type, utiliz
ing the rebate system. Relatively
! few other college bookstores are run \
In this way.
The Stanford Bookstore is unique
| in that no one owns it, other stores
j being owned either by the Univer
i sity or the associated student body,
j At Stanford a group of 27 profes- 1
i sors, each having paid a dollar for !
! the privilege of being in the group, !
! elect five of their number to serve
i as a board of directors.
FOR 49 YEARS
The treasurer for the organization j
j is Miss Frances R. Layse, who was |
j hired as bookkeeper for the book- :
I store in 1900 because she had a j
typewriter and the Stanford Book- !
store Incorporated, did not. Miss I
Layse still hole's that position, al- j
though she no longer has the type- j
writer. The board of directors se- i
lects the manager who is respon
sible for the actual running of the j
! Bookstore.
During the store's 52 - year his
! Tory burglary was attempted twice.
; Both times the safe was the objec
j tive, and both times the would-be
thief was caught by the watchman.

Whether you are a new freshman
at Stanford or a veteran of many
quarters on the Farm you have un
doubtedly, already this quarter,
made use of the Stanford Bookstore.
In fact, wou probably made one or

j more of the 15,000 sales which took
place during the first week of the
[ quarter.
The Bookstore has been serving
i the Stanford Family since the
spring of 1897, and has grown with
the University from a $40,000 a year
business in 1900 to over a $0,000,000
I business in 1948.
In the few years following the
j opening of the University in 1891, a
I small book shop, run by students,
| was in operation in a shack located
] in front of the place where the main
j library now stands. The services of
| the little shop soon proved far in
! adequate for the needs of the school,
so in 1897 President Jordan appoint
ed a group of professors to investi
gate the situation.
$15,000 STOKE
The professors borrowed $15,000
' and built the first Stanford Book-
J store. It was located on the corner
where the Journalism Building now
stands. That original bookstore
building was moved several feet
west when the Journalism Building
was built, and is now known as the
Stanford Daily Shack.
The store soon outgrew the small
! building, and the board of directors
received permission to build a larger
building on the site of the store's
present location. The new building
was occupied in 1906, just two
months before the earthquake,
j Damage as the result of that dis
turbance consisted of a few cracked
I walls and a lot of fallen plaster.
There were two buildings then
i which now are one. The one in front.
I a single room, was the Bookstore.
| The one in back, separated from the
other by an alley, and where the
j Bookstore office now is, fronted on

Whether you are a new freshman
at Stanford or a veteran of many
quarters on the Farm you have un
doubtedly, already this quarter,
made use of the Stanford Bookstore.
In fact, wou probably made one or

j more of the 15,000 sales which took
place during the first week of the
[ quarter.
The Bookstore has been serving
i the Stanford Family since the
spring of 1897, and has grown with
the University from a $40,000 a year
business in 1900 to over a $0,000,000
I business in 1948.
In the few years following the
j opening of the University in 1891, a
I small book shop, run by students,
| was in operation in a shack located
] in front of the place where the main
j library now stands. The services of
| the little shop soon proved far in
! adequate for the needs of the school,
so in 1897 President Jordan appoint
ed a group of professors to investi
gate the situation.
$15,000 STOKE
The professors borrowed $15,000
' and built the first Stanford Book-
J store. It was located on the corner
where the Journalism Building now
stands. That original bookstore
building was moved several feet
west when the Journalism Building
was built, and is now known as the
Stanford Daily Shack.
The store soon outgrew the small
! building, and the board of directors
received permission to build a larger
building on the site of the store's
present location. The new building
was occupied in 1906, just two
months before the earthquake,
j Damage as the result of that dis
turbance consisted of a few cracked
I walls and a lot of fallen plaster.
There were two buildings then
i which now are one. The one in front.
I a single room, was the Bookstore.
| The one in back, separated from the
other by an alley, and where the
j Bookstore office now is, fronted on
\ Escondido Street and was a candy
| and ice cream store run by Ernest
j "Sticky" Wilson, who now owns a
similar business in Palo Alto. The
opposite end of this rear building,
I where the Bookstore stock room and
receiving department now are, was
then Green's Grocery Store.
GROWING PAINS
By 1929 the Bookstore was again
I pressed for room. The rear building
was leased from the University and
joined to the front building as it is

I now. At Ibis time the typewriter
| and general book departments were
added, and the stationery depart
i ment added more novelties.
Many things were once carried by
the store which arc not handled to
) day. For a time, toilet articles, mag
| azines, and gym clothes were once
J carried. Also, at one time, all grad
; uates had to buy their own caps and
i 'towns, and these were available at
' the Bookstore at prices ranging from
i $15 up, depending on the material.
Former University President Bran-
I ner ordered a silk one for which he
paid a modest $130.
BANKERS' HOURS
In 1914 the Bookstore provided
j space from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. for a
j representative of the Palo Alto Bank
(since bought out by the American
{ Trust Co.) to handle withdrawals
. and deposits, and to cash checks for
| the students. This service was dis
continued in 1917 bccause the ex
pense was too high.
It was decided at the outset that
the Bookstore, established "for the
| benefit of the faculty and students,"
: would be of the co-op type, utiliz
ing the rebate system. Relatively
! few other college bookstores are run \
In this way.
The Stanford Bookstore is unique
| in that no one owns it, other stores
j being owned either by the Univer
i sity or the associated student body,
j At Stanford a group of 27 profes- 1
i sors, each having paid a dollar for !
! the privilege of being in the group, !
! elect five of their number to serve
i as a board of directors.
