# Eating Clubs Make New Building Plans
## 
### 
Representatives o( the Farm's
eating clubs met last Friday
afternoon with Dr. Wallace Ster
ling to discuss the possibility of
a new building on campus to
house all seven of the clubs.
Highlight of the meeting was the
presentation to Dr. Sterling of "A
Supplementary Report on Proposed
Eating Club Buildings at Stanford
University," as prepared by the Ex
ecutive Board of the Eating Club
Building Committee.
Dr. Sterling has promised to give
the report careful consideration and
to present it to the Board of Trus*
tees for further action.
The University, in combination
with eating club alumni, would
probably finance the project, the re
port declared. Such a loan as would
be offered by the University would
be amortized by the combined clubs
over a period of years.
LOCATION UNDECIDED
Location of the proposed building
is yet a matter to be decided on by
the clubs and the University, added
Sargc Littlehale, president of Inter
club Council.
Entailed in the report, which it
seen l y eating club members as a
basis for further discussion of the
building problem, is a tentative esti
mate of $135,000 to cover total cost
of an L-shapcd building, complete
with separate kitchen, dining, and
operational facilities for all the
clubs.
Prepared during the summer un
der the supervision of William 11.
McPherson, chairman of the Execu
tive Board of the Eating Club
Building Committee, the report in
cludes a detailed study outlining the
operational expenses of the would
be building for one quarter.
"This additional information," the
report states, "has been prepared to
show that the proposed construction
is not only feasible in all respects
but also to show that it has been
worked out in such detail that now
only administration approval is
necessary for construction to begin."
PREVIOUS REPORT
Friday's report was intended to
supplement another of a more gen
eral nature prepared and submitted
by the Building Committee last
spring. It was largely duiing last
spring quarter that promotion for a
building "all their own" began
among eating club members.
Before the last war, the clubs did
have their own eating facilities in
a separate unit called the "Little
Quad," located where the Toyon
Hall parking lot is now. The "Little
Quad," however, was torn down and
sold by the University four years
ago.
Since that time, the clubs have
been eating at Encina, where over
crowded conditions have precluded
the establishment of private dining
rooms.
Previously, their own separate
dining room-lounge combination fa
cilities in the "Little Quad" pro
vided members with a place t<>
spend many minutes of the day eat
ing, reading the papers, and hull
sessioning.
SEPARATE ROOMS
This quarter's current report in
cludes similar plans for separate
rooms for each club, whereby the
tables in any dining hall may be
pushed aside and the room con
verted into a lounge for off-time
social activities.
Included in the style of architec
ture planned for the new building is

the Stanford tradition of stucco
walls, a tile roof, and asphalt floor
covering on concrete. Estimates of
construction co&ts were made by a
San Francisco contracting firm.
In preparing the report on the
proposed building, the Eating Club
Building Committee worked in close
conjunction with All Brandin, Uni
versity business manager, Warren
M. Turner, fraternity accountant,
and Christine Ricker, director of
University dining halls.

be offered by the University would
be amortized by the combined clubs
over a period of years.
LOCATION UNDECIDED
Location of the proposed building
is yet a matter to be decided on by
the clubs and the University, added
Sargc Littlehale, president of Inter
club Council.
Entailed in the report, which it
seen l y eating club members as a
basis for further discussion of the
building problem, is a tentative esti
mate of $135,000 to cover total cost
of an L-shapcd building, complete
with separate kitchen, dining, and
operational facilities for all the
clubs.
Prepared during the summer un
der the supervision of William 11.
McPherson, chairman of the Execu
tive Board of the Eating Club
Building Committee, the report in
cludes a detailed study outlining the
operational expenses of the would
be building for one quarter.
"This additional information," the
report states, "has been prepared to
show that the proposed construction
is not only feasible in all respects
but also to show that it has been
worked out in such detail that now
only administration approval is
necessary for construction to begin."
PREVIOUS REPORT
Friday's report was intended to
supplement another of a more gen
eral nature prepared and submitted
by the Building Committee last
spring. It was largely duiing last
spring quarter that promotion for a
building "all their own" began
among eating club members.
Before the last war, the clubs did
have their own eating facilities in
a separate unit called the "Little
Quad," located where the Toyon
Hall parking lot is now. The "Little
Quad," however, was torn down and
sold by the University four years
ago.
Since that time, the clubs have
been eating at Encina, where over
crowded conditions have precluded
the establishment of private dining
rooms.
Previously, their own separate
dining room-lounge combination fa
cilities in the "Little Quad" pro
vided members with a place t<>
spend many minutes of the day eat
ing, reading the papers, and hull
sessioning.
SEPARATE ROOMS
This quarter's current report in
cludes similar plans for separate
rooms for each club, whereby the
tables in any dining hall may be
pushed aside and the room con
verted into a lounge for off-time
social activities.
Included in the style of architec
ture planned for the new building is

the Stanford tradition of stucco
walls, a tile roof, and asphalt floor
covering on concrete. Estimates of
construction co&ts were made by a
San Francisco contracting firm.
In preparing the report on the
proposed building, the Eating Club
Building Committee worked in close
conjunction with All Brandin, Uni
versity business manager, Warren
M. Turner, fraternity accountant,
and Christine Ricker, director of
University dining halls.
Representatives o( the Farm's
eating clubs met last Friday
afternoon with Dr. Wallace Ster
ling to discuss the possibility of
a new building on campus to
house all seven of the clubs.
Highlight of the meeting was the
presentation to Dr. Sterling of "A
Supplementary Report on Proposed
Eating Club Buildings at Stanford
University," as prepared by the Ex
ecutive Board of the Eating Club
Building Committee.
Dr. Sterling has promised to give
the report careful consideration and
to present it to the Board of Trus*
tees for further action.
The University, in combination
with eating club alumni, would
probably finance the project, the re
port declared. Such a loan as would
be offered by the University would
