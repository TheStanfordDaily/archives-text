# Broncos Tie Stanford In Hard-Fought Game
## Line Play Excels In 7 to 7 Deadlock 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
In a hard-fought, well-played
gridiron contest, Coach Marchie
Schwartz's Indians and Coach
Lcn Casanova's Bucking Bron
cos battled to a 7 to 7 deadlock,
thus leaving the mythical Penin
sula championship still unde
cided.
Rugged defensive line play, great
pass catching, and excellent putting
highlighted 60 minutes of tin ill
packed football. However, crucial
fumbles cost both teams many scor
ing opportunities.
FUMBLES, FUMBLES
Standford's fleet right halfback,
Boyd Benson, lost the hall three
times in the first half, although he
led the Card ball carriers with 50
yards gained in 11 carries.
Similarly, usually reliable Bronc
halfback Hall Haynes fumbled on
the Card 1-yard line early in the
second quarter, and it was recovered
by Stanford's steady guard, Jesse
Cone. The fumble cost the Broncos
a "sure" touchdown.
Midway in the fourth quarter,
when the Indians were leading 7 to
0, Cone intercepted a partially
blocked Napoiitano pass, and the

slippery pigskin once again changed
hands, as Cone fumbled and Santa
Clara recovered on the Indian 25-
yard line.
A penalty and live plays later, the
Broncos tied up the game.
INDIANS DRAW FIRST BLOOD
Stanford hit pay dirt late in the
third quarter on a 7H-yard march
with Quarterback Gary Kerkorian
scoring from 3 yards out.
The Indians took over on their

own 24-yard line, after holding
Santa Clara on downs. Kerkorian
passed to Ken Rose in the tight flat
for 9 yards to 33. Harry Hugasian
hit center for 7 more, and then KeÂ»
korian threw to A 1 Laakso for 10 to
the midfield stripe.
Kerkorian passed to Rose again
for 7 yards, Benson hit right guatd
for 5 more, and Santa Clara lost 5
yards for offside.
After Bud Klein was held foi no
gain, Hugasion went through center
for three, and Benson through right,
guard for 5, and a Kerkorian to
Rose pass netted the Cards a first,
down on the Santa Clara 3.
On first down, Kerkorian took the
ball over himself for the Cards' first
touchdown, and a minute later he
made his conversion attempt good,
to make the score Stanford 7, Santa
Clara 0.
BRONCOS ROAR
The Broncos, however, came roai
ing back, and drove from their own
26 to the Stanford 10. With fourth
down and only one yard to go, Sant.t
Clara took too much time in thr
huddle, and was penalized 5 yards.
This set the stage for Cone's inter
ception, and subsequent fumble,
which the Broncos recovered on the
27.
Stanford then lost 5 yards for de
laying the game. In five plays, which
included an 11-yard run by Napoli
tano himself, Santa Clara scored.
Joe Vargas kicked the tying point.
The Cards, for the first time this
season, received the opening kick
off, and then started off like a ball
of fire. Opening huge holes in the
rugged Bronco line, the Indians
drove 77 yards in 12 plays all the
way down to the Santa Clara 5.
With first down and goal to go on
the 5, Boyd Benson, who had cai
ried the pigskin most of the distance,
fumbled, and the Broncos' alert end
Don White recovered.
RUGGED LINE PLAY
Rugged line play kept the offense
down on both sides. Stanford gained
122 yards on the ground to the op
ponents' 107, but Santa Clara out
passed the Indians, 174 to 117.
The first downs were 16 to Ij ui
afov rof the Broncos.
Bill McColl played an outstanding
game at defensive tackle for the In
dians. Gordy Rice, who once played
ball for Santa Clara, helped cut,
down the running attack of his for -
mer schoolmates as a standout In
dian linebacker.
Right end Ken Rose played a su
perb game for the Indians, catching
Kerkorian passes at will, and placing
himself in contention for All-Coast
honors.
Stanford at one time on defense
used three ends, Bruce Van Alstyne,
Al Laakso, and Bill McColl, and
thred centers, Gordy Rice, Jack
Barnes, and Jim Castagnoli. Santa
Clara's hard-running backs were
pretty well held in check by the
stalwart Card defenders.
