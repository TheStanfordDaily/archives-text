"What to Do About the Soviet

Streit is the author of "Union
Now" and an advocate of a federal
union of the free democracies.
A former special correspondent

1939 has devoted all his time to the
Federal Union piogram, Streit will
be introduced by an old friend, Dr
Graham Stuart, Stanford professoi
of political science, whom he met in
League of Nations days.
It was after covering the League
of Nations in Geneva from 1929 to
1939 as a Times special correspond
ent that Streit, aware of the
League's weaknesses and also of the
urgent needs of the world situation,
wrote his now-famous book "Union
Now with Britain."
In subsequent editions published
in 1941 and 1948, the book was re
titled "Union Now."
A graduate of the University of
Montana and a Rhodes Scholar,
Streit attended the United Nations
conference in San Francisco in 1945
as a delegate from the Federal Un
ion organization.
This year, with former Supreme
Court Justice Owen J. Roberts and
other associates, he founded the At
lantic Union Committee, whose pur
pose is to promote a study of the
possibility of forming a closer union
between the free democracies al

ready, associated by treaty in the
North Atlantic Alliance.
For many years Streit has been
editor of the monthly magazine
"Freedom and Union." In addition,
he has made innumerable addresses
all over the country and participated
in many radio forums and other
public meetings.
