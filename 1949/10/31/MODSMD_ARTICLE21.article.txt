Forum tickets have arrived to take
care of all written requests, local
manager David Hansen reported
yesterday.
The number of tickets put on sale
last Wednesday and Thursday was
insufficient to take care of the de
mand. Names were taken of all those
in line, with the hope that additional
tickets could be obtained.
"Notices as to where tickets may
be obtained will be sent to all those
who signed the list," Hansen said.
"Then, if there are any tickets re
maining, they will be put on general
sale."
