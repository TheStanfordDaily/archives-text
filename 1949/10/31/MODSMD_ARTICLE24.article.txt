# Campus Opinions Must Be Signed
## 
### 
A number of interesting "Letters to the Edi
tor" have been placed on our desk in recent
days, but they continue to lie there, unpub
lished, for the reason that they have not been
signed.
All letters must be signed in the author's
own handwriting. This is our one standing
rule regarding the Campus Opinion column.
The name will be withheld from publication
if so requested.
The Campus Opinion space is open to any
student, faculty member, or other reader. It
js open for criticism of anything printed in the
Daily, for espousal of any of the presently con
testing viewpoints on national and interna
tional problems, for letters suggesting im
provements in any part of Stanford; in fact, for
almost anything the reader wishes.

As much space as possible will be devoted
to Campus Opinion, but letters should be kept
within reasonable limits. We reserve the right
to edit all letters of over 150 words.
Drop your letters in the mail box addressed
to the Editor or bring them around to the
Shack.
