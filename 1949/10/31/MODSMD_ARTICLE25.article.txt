# Bees, Bees, Bees...

Bees, wasps, and yellow jackets still pester
us wherever we go. The cold weather got a
few of them, but now that it's warm again
they're back worse than ever.
A friend has suggested that each student
take it upon himself to kill five bees. Five
times 8,000 equals 40,000 bees eliminated.
It's the best plan we've heard to date.
