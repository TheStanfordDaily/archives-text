Okay, men, here it is. The word on Big Game dat
ing. Best you should have stayed in bed this morn
ing.
Counting today, there are just exactly 20 more
shopping days until Big Game Weekend, but already

the song of the season has be
come, "Where Are You Now That
I Need You?"
What I mean to say simply is
that available dating material
seems to be as scarce as gin-and
jnice in Stanlord Chapel.
Let's face it. This is one time
the Stanford Woman has got it.
She's been signed, sealed, and
piomised since before last Easter,
and unless you were in line way
back when, your chances are

about as good as Menlo JC's against Army.
On Big Gaine night you figure to be as alone as
a man in a woman's powder-room at Santa Clara.
There are several reasons for this tragic situation,
the main one being that for tradition's sake, a Stan
foid Woman is supposed to foot or pay half the tab
or expense for all Big Game celebrating.
Thus, the Stanford Man who is usually content to
say, "Yah, that pig—l wouldn't be caught dead with
her,' every year about this times changes his tune to,
"Hello, you nice Stanford Girl, how about you and
ii:e for Big Game and all the trimmings?"
Actually, Big Game dating has become a competi
tive sport and is as rugged as playing football in the
Big Ten. Even the teams with the cleverest offensive
attacks and the deepest reserve strength have trouble.
But, don't give up yet. You've got 20 days to
reverse some previous decisions. All it takes is good

looks, healthy bank-roll, good personality, good
background, healthy bank-roll, good intentions, and
finally—healthy bank-roll.
However, if none of these character attributes fit
your description, you still have the following alterna
tives:
A Get a .32 revolver (with a silencer to be
smooth) and do what Chaparral should have done
long ago—end it all. Better yet, read Bull Sessions,
it'll kill you.
B Laugh the whole thing off as a mistake.
Make up some gags about Stanford Women, such as:
She was only u printer's daughter, but I didn't like
her type; or, she was only an electrician's daughter,
but she shocked everyone around her. By that time,
everybody will know why you are dateless.
C See your dentist and switch to Colgate's,
and by all means, don't be half-safe.
D Hurry down to Palo Alto High School, and
remember—Better to pay the whole bill and know
what you're getting than to pay half and get what
you're knowing.
E Go down fighting. Get a Quad-Quad-
Quad-Quad (that's what it says on the cover) and a
Bawlout, and start dialing the numbers. Bull Ses
bion's hot tips are on pages 153, 172, and 99.
G And finally, as a last resort, try this one
last attempt. Single out your choice, preferably in
front of the Cellar, walk casually up to her and say
simply, "Wonka's the name. Warren G. Wonka."
If that doesn t do it, nothing will. As a matter of
fact, it probably won't, and like I said at the begin
ning, best you should have stayed in bed.
But before you pull the covers up over your head,
let me join you in shouting a slight change of a
favorite frosh saying, "To Hell With Stanford Wom
