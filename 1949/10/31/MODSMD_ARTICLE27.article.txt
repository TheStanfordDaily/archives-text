Three cheers for A 1 Berry for asking the question
in his column last Thursday, "Where is the old 'Stan
ford Spirit'?" In this same vein, I'd like to make one
constructive suggestion.
Stop ridiculing Rally Com.
Originally, the criticism of Rally Com was con
tractive, then humorous, and so it was taken by
Rally Com and those of us who have been around
here lor awhile. Bui the poor, misguided classes of
• and s!i have seen Rally Com held up to nothing
but ridicule since they arrived on the Farm, and so
the feeling is slowly spreading that going out of your
way to show spirit, attend rallies, or support the
team is tabu .... you just aren't a true "rough"
this year unless you're indifferent.
No, I'm not a member of Rally Com. In fact, I'm
one of the first to point out that Rally Com can
:,tan«J an awful lot of CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, but
in a school such as ours the football team can't help
> ut feel and reflect the attitude of the student body.
Therefore, if the student body is indifferent'and has
little respect for the organization that is in charge of
fostering, guiding, and co-ordinating student support
for the team, well may you ask, "Where is the old
'Stanford Spirit'?"
I, therefore, suggest that the Daily take the lead in
topping this indifference trend, as well as the idea
that anything "Rah-Rah" or anything connected
with supporting the team is to be shunned. Instead
of bickering among ourselves, let's use all of our
energies toward winning the two most important
Karnes of the season . . . . SC and Cal.
