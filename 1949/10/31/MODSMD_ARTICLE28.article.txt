Let's cut the weekly extra-point entertainment

provided by the yell leaders. The stunt is out of
place whether mocking those who pray to Almighty
God or done in earnest anticipation. Many of us do
not try to please our God, but with respect for Him
and those who do, let's stop the antics and support
the team.
