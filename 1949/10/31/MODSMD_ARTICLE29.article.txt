# Hamburger Steak
## 
### 
To the Editor:
After reading John Hall's "Bull Session" in Fri
day's Daily, I was amazed at what lengths a person
could go just to fill up space. Judging from Mr.
Hall's remarks, I seriously doubt whether he has
ever been what one might call a "regular" customer
at Carlun's.
Stanford is NOT about to lose a favorite tradition
that of the 90-cent dinner at Carlun's. Lefty Bartlet
is NOT the creator of the hamburger steak, green
.salad, garlic bread, and pie a la mode which have
made Carlun's a Stanford favorite. The truth is that
Lefty Bartlet neither created any of the Carlun's
favorites nor is he responsible for the reasonable
pi ices (hamburger steak used to be 80 cents). The
real credit for Carlun's meals and prices must go to
that amiable bartender and owner, Emil, who intro
duced the menu several years ago when he pur
chased the establishment.
II Lefty Bartlet wants to open a place of his own,
more power to him. But as for me, I'll stick with
Emil as 1 have done for the past three years. I might
also suggest that John Hall apologize to Einil for his
article in Fridays Daily. Emil is pretty sore about
the whole affair. BILL BLESSING
P.S. Carlun's will be closed today tor houseclean
ing, but will be open Tuesday with the same menu,
prices, and cooks—less Lefty Bartlet.
