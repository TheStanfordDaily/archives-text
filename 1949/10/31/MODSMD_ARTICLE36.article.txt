# Skunk Enters Theta Chi Zoo; Brothers' Ghast, Polecat Too
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
Fast becoming known as a me
nagerie, the Theta Chi house sported
a new addition Friday when a way
ward skunk sought refuge in the
fraternity's garage.
Since the beginning of fall quar
ter, the Theta Chi brothers have
played nursemaid to three cats. Last
week, a bird resembling a goose
frolicked on their lawn. Then, on
Friday, the lonesome polecat ap
peared and sent the brothers into an
uproar.
The black and white visitor first
announced himself at G a.m. As
pledge Joe Chez left for his hashing
job, he saw a furry bundle at the
corner of Arguello Street and Al
varado Row. Chez made the cus
tomary mistake.
CAT, HELL
"At first I thought it was a cat,"
he admitted. "It looked sick. It was
shivering. Then I realized it was a
skunk, but since I had to go hash
I left it there."
Thus rebuffed by his first host, the
skunk was not heard from again
till about 10 a.m. As Bob Miller
strolled into the eight-car garage, he
stopped short, ran back upstairs, and
sounded the alarm.
"Everybody in the house was ex
cited," said President Walt Varellas.
"We didn't know what to do."
Theta Chi's left their books, news
paapers, and radios, and rushed to
the garage. The polecat lay in the
middle of the floor, shaking as if he
were sick. Cautiously the brothers
moved around him.
"Don't touch him," said someone.
"If you pick him up by the tail—"
said someone else.
Then someone said, "What about
the cars?"
CARS TAKEN OUT
Motors roared and cars shot out of
the garage at super speeds. "The
skunk jumped up in the air several
times, tail high," said Varellas. "Ev
erybody ran for the doors."
But for some reason, the potent
animal did not use his chief weapon.
The boys reappeared. There was no
scent, but something had to be done.
Larry Fink called the Palo Alto
Animal Shelter.
"Say Bub," he reported. "We've
got a skunk in our garage."
"Say, Bub," retorted a voice.
"You got troubles."
POLICE CALLED
The shelter refused to handle the
case, but recommended the campus
police. Varellas called Police Chief
Gordon Davis. Davis had no advice,
but said he would send a man later.
After an hour's wait, with no po
lice, the brothers sought out, then
neighbor, Mrs. Twitty, wife of Vic
tor C. Twitty, professor of biology.
She called her husband at the Biol
ogy Building.
Professor Twitty warned that it
would be dangerous to touch the
animal and recommended, since it
was sick, that it be etherized.
All this time, Theta Chi's were
arriving from class, dropping thier
books at the words, "Hey, there's a
skunk in the garage," and foining
the gathering crowd.
SKUNK ETHERIZED
Ether was procured from the Biol
ogy Department, and just at noon
the skunk, surrounded by
soaked cotton, was covered by a
cardboard box.
Around 1:30 p.m., Chief Davis
drove by and announced that a
truck rom the Corporation Yard
was on its way.
The truck arrived. The driver
lifted the unconscious skunk into

the truck bed. Relieved, the Theta
Chi hosts watched the truck disap
pear down the road, their uninvited
guest presumably on its way to the
hills.
Now quite serene, and quite with
out animals, the Theta Chi's shrug
and say that the fact that their
pledges were in the middle of "work
week" had nothing to do with the
Case of the Theta Chi Skunk.

Engineering majors won't want to
miss Stanford Sadie tonight at 10:30.
Tonight Sadie will wrap her sex
around such subjects as magnetos,
armatures, and large charges.

middle of the floor, shaking as if he
were sick. Cautiously the brothers
moved around him.
"Don't touch him," said someone.
"If you pick him up by the tail—"
said someone else.
Then someone said, "What about
the cars?"
CARS TAKEN OUT
Motors roared and cars shot out of
the garage at super speeds. "The
skunk jumped up in the air several
times, tail high," said Varellas. "Ev
erybody ran for the doors."
But for some reason, the potent
animal did not use his chief weapon.
The boys reappeared. There was no
scent, but something had to be done.
Larry Fink called the Palo Alto
Animal Shelter.
"Say Bub," he reported. "We've
got a skunk in our garage."
"Say, Bub," retorted a voice.
"You got troubles."
POLICE CALLED
The shelter refused to handle the
case, but recommended the campus
police. Varellas called Police Chief
Gordon Davis. Davis had no advice,
but said he would send a man later.
After an hour's wait, with no po
lice, the brothers sought out, then
neighbor, Mrs. Twitty, wife of Vic
tor C. Twitty, professor of biology.
She called her husband at the Biol
ogy Building.
Professor Twitty warned that it
would be dangerous to touch the
animal and recommended, since it
was sick, that it be etherized.
All this time, Theta Chi's were
arriving from class, dropping thier
books at the words, "Hey, there's a
skunk in the garage," and foining
the gathering crowd.
SKUNK ETHERIZED
Ether was procured from the Biol
ogy Department, and just at noon
the skunk, surrounded by
soaked cotton, was covered by a
cardboard box.
Around 1:30 p.m., Chief Davis
drove by and announced that a
truck rom the Corporation Yard
was on its way.
The truck arrived. The driver
lifted the unconscious skunk into

the truck bed. Relieved, the Theta
Chi hosts watched the truck disap
pear down the road, their uninvited
guest presumably on its way to the
hills.
Now quite serene, and quite with
out animals, the Theta Chi's shrug
and say that the fact that their
pledges were in the middle of "work
week" had nothing to do with the
Case of the Theta Chi Skunk.

Engineering majors won't want to
miss Stanford Sadie tonight at 10:30.
Tonight Sadie will wrap her sex
around such subjects as magnetos,
armatures, and large charges.

Fast becoming known as a me
nagerie, the Theta Chi house sported
a new addition Friday when a way
ward skunk sought refuge in the
fraternity's garage.
Since the beginning of fall quar
ter, the Theta Chi brothers have
played nursemaid to three cats. Last
week, a bird resembling a goose
frolicked on their lawn. Then, on
Friday, the lonesome polecat ap
peared and sent the brothers into an
uproar.
The black and white visitor first
announced himself at G a.m. As
pledge Joe Chez left for his hashing
job, he saw a furry bundle at the
corner of Arguello Street and Al
varado Row. Chez made the cus
tomary mistake.
CAT, HELL
"At first I thought it was a cat,"
he admitted. "It looked sick. It was
shivering. Then I realized it was a
skunk, but since I had to go hash
I left it there."
Thus rebuffed by his first host, the
skunk was not heard from again
till about 10 a.m. As Bob Miller
strolled into the eight-car garage, he
stopped short, ran back upstairs, and
sounded the alarm.
"Everybody in the house was ex
cited," said President Walt Varellas.
"We didn't know what to do."
Theta Chi's left their books, news
paapers, and radios, and rushed to

arriving from class, dropping thier
books at the words, "Hey, there's a
skunk in the garage," and foining
the gathering crowd.
SKUNK ETHERIZED
Ether was procured from the Biol
ogy Department, and just at noon
the skunk, surrounded by
soaked cotton, was covered by a
cardboard box.
Around 1:30 p.m., Chief Davis
drove by and announced that a
truck rom the Corporation Yard
was on its way.
The truck arrived. The driver
lifted the unconscious skunk into

the truck bed. Relieved, the Theta
Chi hosts watched the truck disap
pear down the road, their uninvited
guest presumably on its way to the
hills.
Now quite serene, and quite with
out animals, the Theta Chi's shrug
and say that the fact that their
pledges were in the middle of "work
week" had nothing to do with the
Case of the Theta Chi Skunk.

Engineering majors won't want to
miss Stanford Sadie tonight at 10:30.
Tonight Sadie will wrap her sex
around such subjects as magnetos,
armatures, and large charges.

Fast becoming known as a me
nagerie, the Theta Chi house sported
a new addition Friday when a way
ward skunk sought refuge in the
fraternity's garage.
Since the beginning of fall quar
ter, the Theta Chi brothers have
played nursemaid to three cats. Last
week, a bird resembling a goose
frolicked on their lawn. Then, on
Friday, the lonesome polecat ap
peared and sent the brothers into an
uproar.
The black and white visitor first
announced himself at G a.m. As
pledge Joe Chez left for his hashing
job, he saw a furry bundle at the
corner of Arguello Street and Al
varado Row. Chez made the cus
tomary mistake.
CAT, HELL
"At first I thought it was a cat,"
he admitted. "It looked sick. It was
shivering. Then I realized it was a
skunk, but since I had to go hash
I left it there."
Thus rebuffed by his first host, the
skunk was not heard from again
till about 10 a.m. As Bob Miller
strolled into the eight-car garage, he
stopped short, ran back upstairs, and
sounded the alarm.
"Everybody in the house was ex
cited," said President Walt Varellas.
"We didn't know what to do."
Theta Chi's left their books, news
paapers, and radios, and rushed to
the garage. The polecat lay in the
middle of the floor, shaking as if he
were sick. Cautiously the brothers
moved around him.
"Don't touch him," said someone.
"If you pick him up by the tail—"
said someone else.
Then someone said, "What about
the cars?"
CARS TAKEN OUT
Motors roared and cars shot out of
the garage at super speeds. "The
skunk jumped up in the air several
times, tail high," said Varellas. "Ev
erybody ran for the doors."
But for some reason, the potent
animal did not use his chief weapon.
The boys reappeared. There was no
scent, but something had to be done.
Larry Fink called the Palo Alto
Animal Shelter.
"Say Bub," he reported. "We've
got a skunk in our garage."
"Say, Bub," retorted a voice.
"You got troubles."
POLICE CALLED
The shelter refused to handle the
case, but recommended the campus
police. Varellas called Police Chief
Gordon Davis. Davis had no advice,
but said he would send a man later.
After an hour's wait, with no po
lice, the brothers sought out, then
neighbor, Mrs. Twitty, wife of Vic
tor C. Twitty, professor of biology.
She called her husband at the Biol
ogy Building.
Professor Twitty warned that it
would be dangerous to touch the
animal and recommended, since it
was sick, that it be etherized.
All this time, Theta Chi's were
arriving from class, dropping thier
books at the words, "Hey, there's a
skunk in the garage," and foining
the gathering crowd.
