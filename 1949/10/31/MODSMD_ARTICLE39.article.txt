Oct. 22, 1949
Dear Shirley and Jack,
We've enjoyed our trip so
much we haven't had time to
write sooner.
Can't begin to tell you how
delightful it is to travel in Eu
rope between the heavy tourist
seasons. Since leaving the
"Farm" we have had swell ac
commodations, marvelous con
nections, and glorious time.
We've actually seen what Eu
rope is really like minus clouds
of tourists.
We thought it silly to take a
quarter oft and come to Europe
but Dad told us he had done it
when he was at Stanford. When
we went into the Street Travel
Service we discovered Grace
Bungey had planned Dad's trip,
so we felt we were in the best
of hands.
Mrs. Bungey has travelled all
over Europe and been arrang
ing trips for Stanford students
for 19 years so we got the best
advice possible. The whole trip
has been as smooth as walking
across the Quad.
She showed us that travelling
out of season we got better
space and greater selection of
accommodations. It we wanted
to fly we could save $172 each
by going between October and
April, which appealed to Dad as
well as us.
She arranged the most im
portant parts of our trip and
then tipped us off on how to get
along on our own and save
money. We were fascinated by
the ease of it all but Dad merely
mumbled about experience
making ihings easier.
She and her staff, who have
lived in England and the Conti
nent, gave us many useful tips
that have saved us time and
money. They know all the lit
tle things about Europe that
only people who have lived
there can know, such as the
best and most economical ho
tels and restaurants.
We can't urge you too strong
ly to go in and see her right
away so you can make plans to
come over in the spring or even
earlier.
See you in Paris this Spring!
