# Frosh Rout San Jose State For Sixteenth Straight Win
## Powerful Papooses Roll Up 525 Yards In 34 to 7 Victory Over Spartan Frosh 
### DICK KLEIN 
The record book opened wide Saturday morning, as the Stan
ford freshmen rumbled over a weak San Jose State, 34 to 7. The
score could have been worse; the Papooses were that superior.
In winning their fifth game of the season, the Class of '53's
footballers upped Coach Taylor's three-year win streak to a ter
rific sixteen. I

Scoring on three long passes and
two short line bucks, the Cardbabes
dominated the play throughout the
60 minutes of play. Three different
signal-callers threw the six-point
passes — two to Bob Thompson and
the other to Dick Sawyer, both sub
ends. Halfbacks Loren Hinkleman
and Bill Heilbron tallied the other
markers.
STATISTICS SHOW EDGE
The Papoose offense was so pow-
erful that by halftime they had
rolled up 219 yards on the ground
and 106 through the air. To add to
the hopelessness of the State cause,
the highly regarded frosh forward
wall yielded only two first downs in

on the 37. One play took the ball
to the !>. r ), and then Bill Culton, third
Papoose quarterback, pitched a pin
pointer to Sawyer for the final score
of the gume. Draper made both
kicks on the last two scores.
Cleaning the bench, Coach Taylor
allowed the fourth-stringers to keep
the ineffective Spartans in check.
Linebacker Don Talcott intercepted
a pass to put out the only remaining
State threat.

the whole first half, and those came j
in the final four minutes before in- I
termission. The Spartans worked I
hard, very hard, and managed to rip j
off one more first down in the sec
ond half.
JORDAN RUNS WELL
Right half Ernie Jordan, a very
clever runner, was the only good
thing the State rooters could cheer
about. In the second quarter, Jor
dan, on a quick opener, packed the
pigskin 51 yards for his team's only
score. Miles, a sub fullback, con- j
verted and made the score 14-7, as j
close as the Spartans got. Until Jor
dan was wrecked in the fourth I
quarter, he had rolled up most of |
the State yardage.
On the Indran side of the ledger, |
everything was going smoothly, j
Downfield blocking was sharp, line j
)lay was rugged, and running and i
passing were sharp and smart. Only I
blot on the day's outing was the five
Card fumbles, four of them lost.
lIEILBRON SCORES
Tackle John Broderick, who j
played a bang-up game, recovered !
a San Jose fumble on their 32 to set
up the first touchdown. On the!
Cards' second play of the game, A 1 ■
Peterson raced 27 yards to the one.!
Heilbron rammed it over for the j
score. Lou Draper converted for j
7-0.
In the next quarter, the Papooses I
took the ball on the 25 and drove to j
the State 44 with Dick Gargiulo!
making long gains through wide
holes in the center of the line. From i
there, Dave Eldredge threw perfect- '
ly to Thompson, who gathered the :
wineskin on the 20 and swept into j
the clear for the second score. Dra- i
per converted again. Then Jordan j
made his run to make the score 14-7. 1
Another Spartan fumble erased
their only sustained drive, when
Norm Manoogian bounced on the j
loose ball on the eight. Long runs j
by Tom Dragna and Gargiulo set up j
another long pass to A 1 Peterson, j
who stumbled to the two as the gun j
ended the half.
BIG THIRD QUARTER
A St. Gome-to-Thompson flip that \
went for 38 yards opened the third
quarter's three-touchdown barrage.
Draper's kick was no good. The
Papooses drove to the five after San
Jose was forced to kick. Hinkleman
pushed it over when the line opened I
a huge hole.
After the kick-off, State fumbled
