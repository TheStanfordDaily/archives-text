# USC, Idaho and Cal Blast Weekend Foes
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
All three of Stanford's remaining
football opponents turned in wins
Saturday, two of which serve as
warnings to Card Rose Bowl talk.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia, next on the schedule for the
Indians, was given some moments of
worry but came back to beat Wash
ington by a 40 to 28 margin.
Again it was the running of Bill
Martin and the passing of quarter
back Jim Powers that turned the
trick for the Trojans. Powers threw
his tenth touchdown pass of the
year. He has completed 62 passes
thus far this season, 1!) of them com
ing in this game. lie threw 2(i times.
Troy led 20 to 0 at one time, fell
behind 28 to 27, and then bounced
back to win with two lasl-quarter
touchdowns.
Washington's Don Heim ich proved
that the Trojans' pass defense was
not the best when lie scored two
markers by the aerial route in less
than a minute arid a half.
Idaho rolled to a 49 to 21 win over
Portland University, the same team
Santa Clara had trouble downing 20
to 13. Halfback Bob Mays scored
twice on runs of 45 and (i! 5 yards.
Jim Hatch hit out for a 71-yard tally
in the last period.
California came through in grand
style to beat UCLA 35 lo 21. Again
it was "genius" Bob Celeri who
sparked the Bears to the win that
was a must for both teams as well
as Stanford. Stanford entered into
the picture via the back-door route.
For it was this loss that put the

Bruins in the once-defeated-in-con
ference - play class with USC and
Stanford, It kept alive the slim
hopes of the Cards that they can
go to the Rose Bowl, assuming they
heat the Trojans and California.
Cal amassed a grand total of 423
yards by rushing and passing to
UCLA's 332. The Bears ran off 84
plays to the Bruins' 56, and marked
up 22 t(j 8 first downs.
And it was UCLA Coach Red
Sanders, the man who would make
no comparisons after the Bruin-
Card game, who said, "I don't think
anybody will stop that club (Cal).
Nobody. Right down to the end of
the season."
Are they still going to play the
Big Game this year?
Southern California has defeated
Stanford in 1G out of 27 games
played. The only tie was in 1927.
