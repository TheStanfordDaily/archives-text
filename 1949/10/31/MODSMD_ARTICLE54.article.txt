## 
### 
A priceless copy of the Tibetan
Tripitaka, sacred canon of Bud
dhism, is now in the Stanford Uni
versity Library, President Wallace
Sterling announced yesterday.
The edition of the Tripitaka, only
complete one of its kind in the
Western world, has just been Riven
to the University by a Buddhist
monk in Japan.
The Tripitaka is as important to
Buddhists and scholars of the Orien
tal world as an untranslated Greek
or Latin document about the teach
ings of Christ would be to the West- |
ern world.
200 YEARS OLD
The 200-year-old Tripitaka, called
the Derge edition because it was
printed in the Derge Monastery in I
Tibet, is a translation in classical
Tibetan of Buddhist scriptures writ
ten in Indian languages. Many of
the original documents of these
scriptures have long been lost.
Tripitaka means "three baskets" in
Sanskrit and is derived from the
tradition in India and Ceylon of col
lecting in baskets ancient documents
worshipped by Buddhists.
TO BE RETRANSLATED
Retranslation of the Derge edition
into Sanscrit, original language of
these ancient documents, will give
the world a copy of the canons as
originally written. Contents of
these canons, much of which is still j
a copy of this catalogue.
translated into languages in use to
day.
This Tripitaka was given by the
Dalai Lama, the head Buddhist
monk in Tibet, to a Japanese Bud
dhist monk who, in 1922. left Tibet,
after ten years of study, to teach in
his native country. The monk cata
logued the work, and Stanford has
in the 1730'5.
WOOD TYPE USED
The Tripitaka arrived at the Uni
versity from Tokyo in 30 boxes con
taining 300-odd volumes of the can
on, each 4V-> inches wide and 20
inches long. Each book consists of
from 300 to 500 leaves of tough, un
glazed paper printed from wooden
blocks. These blocks were destroyed
20 years ago during hostilities be

tween Tibet and China in the Derge
area, where the book was printed
in the 1930 s.
The volumes are well preserved,
possibly because the paper was
made, it is said, from the root of a

j poisonous plant which insects will
I not attack.
The donors and the University arc â– 
hoping that the Tripitaka will at- ,
tract Buddhist scholars from al! cor- j
ncrs of the world for research.
