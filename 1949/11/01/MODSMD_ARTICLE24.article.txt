# Be It Ever So Breezy
## There's No Place Like Home 
### 
Sigma Nu actives registered quite
a shock Saturday when they re
turned home from the foot bail game
and discovered the contents of their
first floor orderly set up on the front
lawn.
The cars in front of the house
were painted in watercolors, silver
ware and glasses removed, blankets
were hanging from the trees, a
bridge table was set up for playing,
and the 40-foot, dining table was
assembled on the front porch.
This is the first time a pledge
walkout has been staged at Stan
ford. It was inspired by the Sigma
Nu pledge trainer, who claims the
walkout is a tradition with their
fraternity all over the country. In
the words of the trainer, "There's
no damage, the fellows just turn
things over and inside out."
The pledges left in a group for
points unknown, but the actives
were due for a night of hardship
and shock. The cooks were released
for the weekend, razor blades were

confiscated, fuses removed, and dia
phragms were taken out of (he tele
phones.
If this cherished Sigma Nu tradi
tion becomes a permanent thing at
Stanford, the actives have reminded
the pledges that "they aren't above
exercising vendetta."
