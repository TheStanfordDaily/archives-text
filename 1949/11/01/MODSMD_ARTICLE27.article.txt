# A 						New Slant on Roofs
## 
### 
Last spring there was quite a hullabaloo
raised over the question of roofs at Stanford.
Hundreds of alumni and students wrote in to
The Daily and the Alumni Review, the majority
stating that they favored the continuation of
the traditional tiles in future Stanford archi
tecture.
However, Stern Hall now stands as a tribute
to modern architecture. This did not mean that
the Board of Trustees, who make the final de
cision in all such matters, completely disre
garded the wishes of the rest of the Stanford
Family. By the time the question was brought
to the attention of students and alums, plans
had been made and building was already un
derway on Stern.
The issue is not dead now, however, since
the new Student Union plans are now becom
ing a reality. Eldridge T. Spenser, who is di
rector of University planning, submits plans of
future buildings to the Board. Mr. Spenser says
that the Board chooses on the basis of tradition,
demand, and money available for each unit
built.
In the case of the roofs, tradition and demand
seem to be decidedly in favor of the tiles. But
the money available is another story. For
Crothers Hall, the Judge specifically appro
priated funds for a tile roof.
Lagunita Court, a graceful example of com
bination of the old and new, was built in the

days when building costs were considerably
less than this year. Mr. Spenser says that he
doubts if the Board would approve a budget for
a building as extravagant as Lag today.
It all boils down to the tact that work may
begin in a year or so on the new Union, and
many people will probably be unhappy about
the style of architecture chosen. For it looks as
if tile roofs will almost definitely be out of the
question because of the great increase in cost
necessary for this antiquated material.
In addition to the initially high cost of tile, it
costs a great deal to keep repaired because
only a thin layer of "skin" under the tile keeps
the roof from leaking. This layer melts with
high degrees of heat, and since the tile intensi
fies the temperature, Stanford now has a large
number of leaking roofs.
Since tile roofs seems to be quite impractical
lor future building, we'd like to see a style of
architecture which retains as much of the charm
of Stanford as possible. We are sure that com
petent architects can design a Union which will
not only have the useful and practical features
of modern architecture as embodied in Stern,
but will also be in harmony with the rest of the
University.
Since no plans for the new building have as
yet been made, now is the time for students
and alumni to voice their preferences in the
matter. â€”M.K.
