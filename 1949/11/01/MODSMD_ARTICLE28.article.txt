### JOHN HALL 
Monday's wash was still drying yesterday, so I
just got around to hailing it in today:
Okay! Okay. Okay!
Let's have reel two of the Carlun's Caper, this

being a sequel to last week's
Lefty Bartlet story.
Lefty is gone, but business is
still going on as usual. Hambur
ger steak what-am is still 90
cents and is still being served.
Einil and Mike, the original pro
prietors and regular bartenders,
have simply taken over both
sides of the business. Both Emil
and Mike are nice guys.
They will maintain all the
same specialties in the food de-

partment, and the exact same waitresses and cooks
will serve the meals.
So, don't ring down the Carlun's curtain. The
show is still very much going on. Ernil and Mike
have always given Stanford students a good deal.
They will continue to do so.

In reference to Bill Blessing's blast in Letters To,
I'd just like to say: Bill, you don't have to call me
Mr. Hall. We've known each other for three years.
We hashed together at old Encina Commons. This
•Is the friendly Farm. So, just call me John.

Did you hear the story about the president of a
local tong who was putting on the personality for a
feminine guest during a recent exchange at his
house?
It seems that his brother hashers were getting
tired of his well-polished hosting and Elsa Maxwell
entertainment program, so they decided to ruffle
him a little. he v/as giving with the smooth talk
and munching a platter of lima beans all in one
breath, he happened to glance down at his plate to
find a human eye staring up at him.
As he gulped and ran for the door, the hashers
doubled up with laughter. One of them had slipped a
glass eye into his beans.

Does anybody remember a yell which the rooting
section used to give for the football team when
things got really tough in a game? It wasn't the
Old Spell, and it wasn't the Go Team, and it wasn't
the Chant.
They called it the Axe-Yell.

Consider the washing hauled in and ironed with
this last bulletin. Beer remains a nickel higher and
there's still no bell at Dinah's. However, three
lonesome lamps have reappeared and no more have
disappeared.
So, c'mon, Eddie—loosen up!
