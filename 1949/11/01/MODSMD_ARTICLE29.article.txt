To the Editor:
It has been my pleasure, for a good number of
years, to sit in, and next to the Stanford rooting sec
tion at football games. That is, my pleasure, up to
last Saturday. After Stanford fumbled at the end of
the long drive which started the game, I thought a
California rooting section had taken over our side of
the field. It was that quiet.
Although Stanford put on a defensive battle that
was outstanding in its play, the rooting section
seemed to have collapsed at the end of the first few
plays of the game. Our offense, hampered by some
bad breaks, and held in check by a better-than
average Santa Clara team, had difficulty in rolling.
What a letdown that first fumble must have been to
the team! It amazed me that we did not lose the
j tame when Santa Clara was urged on and on, time
and time again by their little rooting section, which
completely drowned out our own section.
The sooner the students stop reading the sports
pages, which have put a green, sophomore team on
the spot since before the season opened, and judge

the team on its potentials, then perhaps they can
get back the spirit which is so cold. Think of what
has been expected of this team, even before a game
was played, and ask yourself why—because they
were terrific as frosh. II we had a good senior team,
how many of the sophs now playing could have
cracked the senior line-up? Darned few. It's a big
jump from frosh to varsity ball.
As for the fumbling. A lot of good professors are
imparting their knowledge to you fellows daily.
When you have a test, do ALL of you make A's, or
do you lumhle once in awhile? Think it over, and
look ahead to the next, one, two, and maybe three
years. Give your team and your coaches a break.
They're human as you and I. Why expect them to
be of genius caliber every Saturday of the month?
I know the famine has been long, but it will pass.
I've suffered with the rest of you. However, unless
the Stanford rooting section can change its present
attitude toward the team, this student body will go
down in my book, and in those many sitting around
me Saturday, as having the distinction of showing
the most decided lack of spirit ever displayed on
the Farm.

do you lumhle once in awhile? Think it over, and
look ahead to the next, one, two, and maybe three
years. Give your team and your coaches a break.
They're human as you and I. Why expect them to
be of genius caliber every Saturday of the month?
I know the famine has been long, but it will pass.
I've suffered with the rest of you. However, unless
the Stanford rooting section can change its present
attitude toward the team, this student body will go
down in my book, and in those many sitting around
me Saturday, as having the distinction of showing
the most decided lack of spirit ever displayed on
the Farm.

To the Editor:
It has been my pleasure, for a good number of
years, to sit in, and next to the Stanford rooting sec
tion at football games. That is, my pleasure, up to
last Saturday. After Stanford fumbled at the end of
the long drive which started the game, I thought a
California rooting section had taken over our side of
the field. It was that quiet.
Although Stanford put on a defensive battle that
was outstanding in its play, the rooting section
seemed to have collapsed at the end of the first few
plays of the game. Our offense, hampered by some
bad breaks, and held in check by a better-than
average Santa Clara team, had difficulty in rolling.
What a letdown that first fumble must have been to
the team! It amazed me that we did not lose the
j tame when Santa Clara was urged on and on, time
and time again by their little rooting section, which
completely drowned out our own section.
The sooner the students stop reading the sports
pages, which have put a green, sophomore team on
the spot since before the season opened, and judge

the team on its potentials, then perhaps they can
get back the spirit which is so cold. Think of what
has been expected of this team, even before a game
was played, and ask yourself why—because they
were terrific as frosh. II we had a good senior team,
how many of the sophs now playing could have
cracked the senior line-up? Darned few. It's a big
jump from frosh to varsity ball.
As for the fumbling. A lot of good professors are
imparting their knowledge to you fellows daily.
When you have a test, do ALL of you make A's, or
do you lumhle once in awhile? Think it over, and
look ahead to the next, one, two, and maybe three
years. Give your team and your coaches a break.
