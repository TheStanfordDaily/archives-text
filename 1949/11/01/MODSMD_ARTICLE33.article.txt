The SIRO drive—Stanford's an
nual and only relief drive—starts
next Monday. The goal set for this
year's drive is $12,000.
Funds collected from the drive
will be divided in a 60-30-10 per
centage ratio. The largest portion,
60 per cent, will be divided between
the UN Appeal for Children, the
World Student Service Fund, and
the Stanford Educational Rehabili

The United Nations Appeal for
Children is an agency which sup

homes for many war orphans and
other homeless children.

FOREIGN STUDENT AID

WSSF is a student-supported or
ganization which supplies necessi
ties to students throughout the
world and helps to establish and
maintain sanatoriums and other
such institutions.

Richard Thomas, regional direc
tor of the World Student Service
Fund for the region which in
cludes California, is on the Stan
ford campus this week. lie will
be at several campus meetings,
and anyone interested in meeting
him should contact the lIR office,
Pat Terry, SIRO co - chairman,
said.

The Stanford Educational Reha
bilitation Fund is used by SIRO for
direct aid to students and other per
sons of foreign nations. It was goods
provided through this fund which
were sent to the University of Na
ples two years ago and 1o the Free
University of Berlin last winter.
ASSU FLOATING FUND
Ten per cent of the $12,000 SIRO
hopes to collect will be allotted to
the ASSU Floating Fund. From this
pool comes money to be contributed
to various national drives through
out the year such as the March of
Dimes and the Cancer Fund.
Through this plan Stanford students

are saved the nuisance of contribut
ing to several relief fund drives
throughout the year. It all comes
from the SIRO drive.
The final 30 per cent of the drive
funds goes to the Palo Alto Youth
Fund. Besides its regular Commu
nity Chest activities, the Youth
Fund substantially helps maintain
the Stanford chapter of the YWCA
and a student employment service.
