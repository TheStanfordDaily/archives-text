# HOLLYWOOD TRIES HARD
## Realism Rings True In Navy Carrier Epic 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
"Task Force," saga of victory
through carrier power, tries hard to
be a documentary film and succeeds
â€”almost too well.
The picture, now playing at the
Stanford Theater, deals first with

the casual, un
(eventful early
years of Gary
Cooper in a Navy
and sunk
'by a stroke of the
pen in 1920. This
episodic account

of the struggle to build naval power
between 1918 and 1941 is so slow
paced the audience begins to squirm
on the hard theater seats.
However, the documentary qual
ity of the film is realistic, particu
larly when aided by official naval
battle pictures of the war; camera
and episodes blend to make the
struggle for security into a compact
movie, as authentic as the hard grey
aircraft carriers the film deals with.
Unfortunately the documentary
quality of the film sinks into the
blue Pacific when the camera is
turned to the private life of Cooper.
Producer Wald seems to have feared
his "war story" didn't hold enough
interest to please his audience.
He has added a "love interest,"
Jane Wyatt, who at first refuses to
marry another naval flier. As no
one but Cooper is particularly in
terested in whether she marries or
not, the love story weakens the film.
It seems contrived and out of place
with the film's realism. Even the

camera work is fuzzier and less con
vincing.
The acting is universally authen
tic. Cooper is believable as a war
time admiral and peacetime lieuten
ant. Walter Brennan, as a sympa
ethetic fire-eater, turns in his usual
polished performance. Wayne Mor
ris is surprisingly calm and less col
legiate than usual.
