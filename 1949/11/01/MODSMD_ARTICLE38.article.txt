# ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO
## Sports Scribes to Boom Celeri for All-American 
### AL BERRY 
For years the Pacific Coast's insistence on having their own All-
American, has been approaching the ludicrous. Yesterday, it
reached the ridiculous.
An Associated Press story, by Russ Newland, brought news that
will make Stanford rooters slightly ill, and football fans all over

the country long for basketball
season.
It's Bub Celeri for All-American.
The AP story, which commented
on Cal's happy dance over the un
happy Bruins last week, said in
part, "Members of the Northern
California Football Writers' Asso
ciation voted today to support Uni
versity of California quarterback
bob Celeri as a candidate for All-
American honors."
"Al Weston, secretary of the
Southern California Football Writ
ers' Association, telephoned that his
group had also voted to back Ce
leri."
LEISER LEADS WAY
The proclamation camc on the I
heels of a Bill Leiser article in the
San Francisco Chronicle that called
the capable California quarterback
a "genius," "the greatest collegiate
T-l'ormation quarterback in the
country without a doubt," and a
few other flattering but dubious ti
tles. Leiser, however, made no men
tion of Army quarterback Arnold
Galiffia, Notre Dame's Bob Wil
liams or even USC's "Mystic" Pow
ers, who has set all kinds of Tro
jan passing records.
Nor did it mention California's
schedule, which does not include
any of the nation's top elevens.
To make the day perfect—for in
consistency, at least —the Northern
California writers voted the first
annual Glenn (Pop) Warner Award
to an outstanding Pacific Coast
player, to College of Pacific quar
terback Eddie Leßaron. They did
not, however, comment on how one
Coast quarterback could be All-
American, while another quarter

back was the "outstanding player,
on the Pacific Coast."
MATSON, LEBANON DROPPED
Two weeks ago, the local writers
voted to support USF's Ollie Mat
son, and Leßaron for the glory po
sition, but these, of course, are being
dropped in favor of the Cal signal
caller.
The AP story went on: "Califor
nia Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf
who coached the great Otto Gra
ham at Northwestern, compared Ce
leri on even terms."
The Association's decision .might
well be termed a personal success
for Chronicler Bill Leiser who in
recent years has led the publicity
campaign for two othe worthy All-
American candidates: St. Mary's
Herman Wedemeyer — during the
war years, and last season's base
ball-playing Jack Jensen.
In the UCLA game last week, the
Cal quarterback, now headed for
great things, set two U of C records.
His 12 completed forward passes set
a new mark for a single game by a
California :nan. He also set rec
ords in total yardage in passing of
214 and the most yards in total of
fense of 225.
Although the Stanford Daily
Sportwriters have expressed respect
for the Cal signal-caller, they gave
little indication at this point that
they will follow the lead of their
professional brethren in pushing
him for anything so fabulous as
All-American.

Cal quarterback, now headed for
great things, set two U of C records.
His 12 completed forward passes set
a new mark for a single game by a
California :nan. He also set rec
ords in total yardage in passing of
214 and the most yards in total of
fense of 225.
Although the Stanford Daily
Sportwriters have expressed respect
for the Cal signal-caller, they gave
little indication at this point that
they will follow the lead of their
professional brethren in pushing
him for anything so fabulous as
All-American.
For years the Pacific Coast's insistence on having their own All-
American, has been approaching the ludicrous. Yesterday, it
reached the ridiculous.
An Associated Press story, by Russ Newland, brought news that
will make Stanford rooters slightly ill, and football fans all over

the country long for basketball
season.
It's Bub Celeri for All-American.
The AP story, which commented
on Cal's happy dance over the un
happy Bruins last week, said in
part, "Members of the Northern
California Football Writers' Asso
ciation voted today to support Uni
versity of California quarterback
bob Celeri as a candidate for All-
American honors."
"Al Weston, secretary of the
Southern California Football Writ
ers' Association, telephoned that his
group had also voted to back Ce
leri."
LEISER LEADS WAY
The proclamation camc on the I
heels of a Bill Leiser article in the
San Francisco Chronicle that called
the capable California quarterback
a "genius," "the greatest collegiate
T-l'ormation quarterback in the
country without a doubt," and a
few other flattering but dubious ti
tles. Leiser, however, made no men
tion of Army quarterback Arnold
Galiffia, Notre Dame's Bob Wil
liams or even USC's "Mystic" Pow
ers, who has set all kinds of Tro
jan passing records.
Nor did it mention California's
schedule, which does not include
any of the nation's top elevens.
To make the day perfect—for in
consistency, at least —the Northern
California writers voted the first
annual Glenn (Pop) Warner Award
to an outstanding Pacific Coast
player, to College of Pacific quar
terback Eddie Leßaron. They did
not, however, comment on how one
Coast quarterback could be All-
American, while another quarter

back was the "outstanding player,
on the Pacific Coast."
MATSON, LEBANON DROPPED
Two weeks ago, the local writers
voted to support USF's Ollie Mat
son, and Leßaron for the glory po
sition, but these, of course, are being
dropped in favor of the Cal signal
caller.
The AP story went on: "Califor
nia Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf
who coached the great Otto Gra
ham at Northwestern, compared Ce
leri on even terms."
The Association's decision .might
well be termed a personal success
for Chronicler Bill Leiser who in
recent years has led the publicity
campaign for two othe worthy All-
American candidates: St. Mary's
Herman Wedemeyer — during the
war years, and last season's base
ball-playing Jack Jensen.
