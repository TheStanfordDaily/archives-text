### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 31 (/P) â€” The
San Francisco '49ers, a full game
behind the Brooklyn - New York
Yankees and Cleveland Browns in
the All-America Football Confer
ence race, have just about clinched
the league's statistical championship.
After nine games, the '49ers have
a comfortable lead in total offense,
due largely to their running attack,
and in scoring.
Cleveland drew up closer to San
Francisco in total offense before
those teams clashed last Sunday,
but while the Browns were winning
the game, 30-28, the '49ers domi
nated the statistics, gaining 477
yards ta Cleveland's 400. That gave
San Francisco a season average of
395.7 yards a game to Cleveland's
384.5. Buqalo retained third with
343.G yards.
