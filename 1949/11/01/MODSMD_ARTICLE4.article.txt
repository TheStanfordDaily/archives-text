WASHINGTON â€” Four Congress I
members today jointly accused Sec
retary of Defense Johnson and Sec
retary of the Navy Matthews of re
sorting to "trickery, broken pledges,
and smear tactics" in the row over
national defense.
They denounced what they
termed "injustices" in the firing of
Admiral Louis E. Denfeld as chief of
naval operations after his critical
testimony against high defense poli
cies during recent hearings before
the House Armed Services Commit
tee.
