# ROSES ARE RED...
## Troy, Card Bout Is 'Big One' for Both 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's footballers have a
couple of 7 to G defeats to avenge
this year; and they're hoping to
make payment on the first install
ment of the double debt this Satur
day at L.A.'s giant Coliseum.
But Jeff Cravath has a gang of
rough and tough gridders down at
USC who are definitely capable of
running the Cards into even deeper
debt.
The Trojans are in much the same
position as Stanford, still clinging to
a thin mathematical hope of getting
to Pasadena after being upset by a
state school in early conference
play.
The southerners could still make
the grade, by beating both Stanford
and UCLA, if the Cards subsequent
ly obliged by waxing California's
bruising Bears, the only team to
push El Trojan to the wrong side
of the scoreboard this year.
That would leave Troy tied with
Cal, and while not insuring them of
a romp in the Roses, would at least
make the whole thing possible.
Stanford, of course, must also win
if it is to keep alive its faint flame
of hope.
A TIE IS NO GOOD
Neither will be satisfied with less
than a win, either, for a knotted
count in Los Angeles Saturday
would eliminate both teams from
further contention.
Cravath's crew was heavily fa
vored for the Coast crown before the
season started and except for a men
tal lapse of some 20 seconds in Ber
keley three weeks ago, they've done
a good job of living up to their rave
notices.
That one mistake occurred when
the Trojans, suddenly converted
into spectators after powering their
way to a 10 to 7 lead over the Bears,
watched fascinated while Frank
Brunk trotted 102 yards for the
touchdown that eventually shattered
the white horse 16 to 10.
They also have a 13 to 13 tie With
Ohio State blemishing their record.
But if the Cards fall right, they
might get a chance to make up for
that one. It takes a bit of calis
thenics of the imagination to figure
it, but it's entirely possible for USC
to face State in Pasadena.
The Trojans' T attack relies pri
marily on the functioning of their
aptly named quarterback, Jim Pow
ers. Jim has been tossing his weight
around, and footballs too, in Con
ference activities for three years
now, but he reached his peak of
passing efficiency last Saturday
against the Washington Huskies.
No' less than six, count 'em, toss

ing records wore bettered or
equaled by the mystic one while he
and his mates were busy out-mara
thoning the Huskies 40 to 28.
Jim tied one conference mark
when he heaved his tenth scoring
pass of the year, a record which he
should break before too many Sat
urdays hence.
POWERS IS RECORD-BUSTER
He also set five new ones by ac
counting for 293 yards by passing
during the contest; figuring in the
longest (90 yards) pass play in con
ference history; completing 19
pitches in one game and (52 in one
season; and attempting more aerials
(2G) than anyone else has ever tried
in a single afternoon. ,
On the ground, fullback Billy
Martin, another third - year man,
should carry the brunt of the load
for the Trojans. Martin is only 5 ft.
8 in. high, but he weighs better than
200 pounds and uses every single
one of them when he ploughs a
line.
Veterans-Jim Bird at right tackle
and George Davis at center form the
main anchorage in the forward wall.
Bird, incidentally, buckles the scales
at 230 pounds.
Bob Stillwell is another lad per
forming for his third year at right
end. Stillwell gained All-Coast rec
ognition in 1948.


JACK RYE, sturdy Stanford de
fensive end, will be one of the
men that Coach Marchie Schwartz,
expects to stop the potent run
ning attack of the CSC Trojans in
the Coliseum this Saturday. Rye
is bouncing back with happy ease
from the foot injury he sustained
in last week's Bronco tilt.

men that Coach Marchie Schwartz,
expects to stop the potent run

the Coliseum this Saturday. Rye
is bouncing back with happy ease
from the foot injury he sustained
in last week's Bronco tilt.
Stanford's footballers have a
couple of 7 to G defeats to avenge
this year; and they're hoping to
make payment on the first install
ment of the double debt this Satur
day at L.A.'s giant Coliseum.
But Jeff Cravath has a gang of
rough and tough gridders down at
USC who are definitely capable of
running the Cards into even deeper
debt.
The Trojans are in much the same
position as Stanford, still clinging to
a thin mathematical hope of getting
to Pasadena after being upset by a
state school in early conference
play.
The southerners could still make
the grade, by beating both Stanford
and UCLA, if the Cards subsequent
ly obliged by waxing California's
bruising Bears, the only team to
push El Trojan to the wrong side
of the scoreboard this year.
That would leave Troy tied with
Cal, and while not insuring them of
a romp in the Roses, would at least
make the whole thing possible.
Stanford, of course, must also win
if it is to keep alive its faint flame
of hope.

Neither will be satisfied with less
than a win, either, for a knotted
count in Los Angeles Saturday

Cravath's crew was heavily fa

a good job of living up to their rave
notices.
That one mistake occurred when
the Trojans, suddenly converted
into spectators after powering their
way to a 10 to 7 lead over the Bears,
watched fascinated while Frank
Brunk trotted 102 yards for the
touchdown that eventually shattered
the white horse 16 to 10.
They also have a 13 to 13 tie With
Ohio State blemishing their record.

that one. It takes a bit of calis

to face State in Pasadena.

That one mistake occurred when
the Trojans, suddenly converted
into spectators after powering their
way to a 10 to 7 lead over the Bears,
watched fascinated while Frank
Brunk trotted 102 yards for the
touchdown that eventually shattered
the white horse 16 to 10.
They also have a 13 to 13 tie With
Ohio State blemishing their record.
But if the Cards fall right, they
might get a chance to make up for
that one. It takes a bit of calis
thenics of the imagination to figure
it, but it's entirely possible for USC
to face State in Pasadena.
The Trojans' T attack relies pri
marily on the functioning of their
aptly named quarterback, Jim Pow
ers. Jim has been tossing his weight
around, and footballs too, in Con
ference activities for three years
now, but he reached his peak of
passing efficiency last Saturday
against the Washington Huskies.
No' less than six, count 'em, toss

ing records wore bettered or
equaled by the mystic one while he
and his mates were busy out-mara
thoning the Huskies 40 to 28.
Jim tied one conference mark
when he heaved his tenth scoring
pass of the year, a record which he
should break before too many Sat
urdays hence.
POWERS IS RECORD-BUSTER
He also set five new ones by ac
counting for 293 yards by passing
during the contest; figuring in the
longest (90 yards) pass play in con
ference history; completing 19
pitches in one game and (52 in one
season; and attempting more aerials
(2G) than anyone else has ever tried
in a single afternoon. ,
On the ground, fullback Billy
Martin, another third - year man,
should carry the brunt of the load
for the Trojans. Martin is only 5 ft.
8 in. high, but he weighs better than
200 pounds and uses every single
one of them when he ploughs a
line.
Veterans-Jim Bird at right tackle
and George Davis at center form the
main anchorage in the forward wall.
Bird, incidentally, buckles the scales
at 230 pounds.
Bob Stillwell is another lad per
forming for his third year at right
end. Stillwell gained All-Coast rec
ognition in 1948.


JACK RYE, sturdy Stanford de
fensive end, will be one of the
men that Coach Marchie Schwartz,
expects to stop the potent run
ning attack of the CSC Trojans in
the Coliseum this Saturday. Rye
is bouncing back with happy ease
from the foot injury he sustained
in last week's Bronco tilt.
