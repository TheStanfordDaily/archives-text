# Cardbabes, Cubs to Tangle
## 
### 
Hie Bear-hungry Papoose football
squad settled down to their final
week of practice in preparation for
their Little Big Game with the Cali
fornia freshmen next weekend.
Scheduled for Saturday in Memo
rial Stadium, the traditional frosh
classic will decide the mythical
freshman championship among the
California colleges. The Cubs have
dropped only one game, while the
Papooses are still in the undefeated,
untied class.
Last Friday, the UCLA Brubabes
stole a little thunder from the Card
babes by downing Cal, 47-20. The
Westwooder.s outgained the famed
"All-Saints" backfield 234 yards to

48 on the ground. Cal ace and full
back Johnny Olszewski was held to
a mere 16 yards.
For comparison, the Cards a
coupfe of Saturdays ago nipped the
Brubabes (5-0. It was not one of the
j Papooses' better performances.
