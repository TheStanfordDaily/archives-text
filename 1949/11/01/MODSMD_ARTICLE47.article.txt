# Cal Raiders Foiled
## Delta Chi's Spring Trap on Brothers 
### WALLY WHITE 
It was II p.m. Thursday, an ordi
nary week night. The phone rang
at the Delta Chi house.
"Hello, boys," said a female voiee.
"I thought I'd warn you that Delta
Clii's from Cal are eoming to raid
your house."
The anonymous caller hung up. A
half-hour later a long-distance call,
from the Berkeley campus, echoed
her warning.
Delta Chi's set to work. Used to
brotherly throat-slitting, they de
vised a p an to trap their marauding
brothers. With Jim Kurfess, Al
Balch, and President Vern Jones
camped on the first floor, they re
tired.
At 3:30 a.m., a car glided to a si
lent stop in front of the Delta Chi
liou.se. Three men slipped from the
car, climbed Delta Chi's brick steps,
and entered the front door.
THE JIG WAS UP
Directly in front of them, on the
mantel, three golden trophies glim
mered in the moonlight. One of the
raiders reached out—
Crash! The clang of metal on
metal rang through the room. Two
Cal men leaped for the door. The
third, not satisfied, grabbed the
mantel clock and started to follow.
It was too late, and the three Stan
ford brothers were upon him.
"The trap?" said Henry Mack.

"That was simple enough. We put I
all our good trophies away and set
out three old ones. Then we at
tached black thread to the trophies.
At the other end of the thread a
spoon was set to fall into a pot."
Two of the three Cal Delta Chi's, j
with three others waiting in the car, j
escaped.
SCALPING PARTY
By now most of the house was
awake. With glee, amateur barbers
shaved the raider's scalp. On the
top of his "noggin" they painted the
Greek letters for Delta Chi; on the
back, a red "S."
At noon Friday, the prisoner's
worried brothers appeared from Cal j
and asked for his release. After a
hurried house meeting, the Stanford
boys decided to let the bald one go. i
"After all," said Jones with a
smile, "he had to go down to the
UCLA game the next day."
