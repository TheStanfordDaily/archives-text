AFRICAN AGREEMENT
Details of the secret agreement

He recalled the storm of disap
proval which rose when the agree
ment became public, pointing out
that the State Department could not
expain its moves for fear of reveal
ing the African invasion plans.
Material for the volume was gath
ered from Professor Stuart's expe

memoirs of other officials.
LONDON SCOOPED
The author found that Washington
knew World War had started be
fore London did.
State Department files show that

William Bullitt, ambassador at Paris,
phoned President Roosevelt direct.
Roosevelt then called Secretary Hull
who phoned Ambassador Kennedy
in London. Kennedy told Hull that
the British government had not
been informed of the start of the
war.
Professor Stuart denounces politi
cal control over the Department of
State, writing: "A successful Ameri
can foreign policy can hardly be ex
pected when the President accepts
the questionable advice of self-seek
ing politicians instead of the objec
tive counsel of experienced experts
of the Department of State."
