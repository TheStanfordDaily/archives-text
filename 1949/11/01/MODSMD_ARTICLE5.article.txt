I'ARIS â€”Paul G. Hoffman, Mar
shall Plan chicf, urged upon West
ern Europe today the removal of
trade quotas, monetary barriers, and
all tariffs to create a single market
of 270,000,000 Europeans for mass
production industry.
This, he said, was necessary for
two reasons:
1. To give new impetus to support
in the United States Congress for
Marshall Plan appropriations until
1952.
2. To avoid leaving Europe at the
end of the Marshall Plan in "pre
carious balance with the dollar
area."
