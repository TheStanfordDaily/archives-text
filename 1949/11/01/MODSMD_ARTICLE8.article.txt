# NEHRU SPEAKS
## Cal Hears Top India Statesman 
### JOAN SEAVER RUSTAM D. LALKAKA 
A ( fanfare of rolling drums
ushered Pandit Jawaharlal Neh
ru, Prime Minister of India, be
fore 10,000 enthusiastic specta
tors crowding the Hearst Greek
Theater, Berkeley, at 11 a.m.
yesterday.
Informally addressing Governor
Warren, President Sproul, and the
many students present, the Pandit
pleaded for greater conformity in
j ideals and actions among nations of
the world. Peoples will go far astray
i unless they draw for guidance from
| the basic moral truths on which
I both the Indian and American re
i publics were founded.
"We live in an age of paradox,"
Nehru said. "We talk of peace and
prepare for war . . . we talk of in
; ternationalism and one world, and
yet. nationalism and narrow preju
dices govern our policies. We move
from one temporary expedient to
another, achieving nothing of per
manence."
ASIA'S ROLE
Emphasizing the supreme impor
tance in world history of "the re
naissance of Asia," Nehru pointed
j out that Asia will inevitably play a
i major and ever-increasing role in
world affairs, both political and eco
j nomic.
Nehru outlined the principal ob
jectives in the Asiatic situation
as political emancipation, economic
improvement, and elimination of ra
cial inequality.
In reference to the ever-present
economic factor in India's struggle
for freedom, the need for relieving
the masses from suffering and want,
he recalled Gandhi's supreme ambi
tion . . . "to wipe every tear from
every eye. What are politics and all
our arguments worth if we do not
have this end in view?"
Leaving a wildly applauding au
-1 dience, won by his ideals and per-
I sonality, the Indian Premier pro
! ceeded to address a reception given
by the Indian community and stu
dents of California later in the af
ternoon. In deference to the cos
mopolitan audience, he spoke infor-
I mally both in his Cambridge Eng
lish and in Hindustani.
OBJECTIVES IMPORTANT
"The present generation in India,"
he said, "is condemned to hard la
bor." Nehru asserted that the
wealth, the constitution, the bill of
rights of a country arc not as impor
tant as the obectives in view and the
quality of human material. Valu
able objectives together with the
hard labor to which Indian youth
is committed are bound to bear
fruit.
The cordial Pandit concluded the
reception by inviting all Indian chil
dren in the audience to the stage to
meet his attractive sister and
daughter. An onrush of handshak
ing compatriots climaxed the last
day in the California phase of Neh
ru's "voyage of discovery."
