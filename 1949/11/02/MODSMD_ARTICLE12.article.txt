## Streit Asks 'Union Now' 
### 
"Federal union of the North At
lantic democracies iL> the solution
whereby we may prevent ruin of
the United States, either by the
atom bomb or by economic crash."
This statement was issued by
Clarence Streit, author of "Union
Now" and member of the newly
formed Atlantic Union Committee,
to a Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence of some 700 persons assembled
last night in Memorial Hall.
Title of Mr. Streit's lecture was
"What to Do About the Soviet
Atomic Bomb." He was introduced
by Dr. Graham Stuart, Stanford
professor of political science, who
described the speaker as "the orig
inator and most tireless advocate for
union of the western democracies."
Referring to such a free demo
cratic nation as the United States,
Mr. Streit said, "The slower a na
tional will is in forming, the more
safeguards it gives to the world that
it will not use its weapons of war
during peacetime."
Conversely, in reference to an au
tocratic state such as the Soviet
Unibn, he said, "No political sys
tem can possibly facilitate attack on
another nation in peacetime as
easily as a dictatorship."
Mentioning that the free democra
cies of the world must play the in
ternational game "with their cards
face ufc> on the table," Mr. Streit
continued:
"They (the free democracies) will
win only if they have so strong a
hand that none can beat it. They
must cease playing their aces against
each other and pool their strength
jn the formation of a common free
government."
