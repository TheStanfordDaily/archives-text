# H. 'Beau' Caen Signs His New 'Baghdad' Book
## 
### 
Armed with a smile and a
pen, Herb Caen, columnist and
author, invaded the Farm yes
terday and spent many hours
talking to students and auto
graphing copies 'of his new
book, "Baghdad-By-The-Bay."
From 12 noon until long after 2
p.m., a continual line of people in
front of the Stanford Bookstore kept
forming to meet the columnist.
After signing innumerable copies of
his book, Caen commented, "My
thumb has got a hole worn in it;
this is such a HARD fountain pen."
Just as Caen was about to leave, an
old man hurried up and asked that
a book be autographed for his 96-
year-old wife, who was an ardent
admirer of Caen's column.
In "Baghdad-By-the-Bay," which
is almost entirely concerned with
San Francisco, Stanford is honored
with mention of Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Also in connection with Stanford,
Caen commented yesterday that he

The Bookstore still has auto
graphed copies of Herb Caen's

had hoped for more football vic
tories. But his prediction for the Big
Game is gratifying â€” California 7,
Stanford 14. Caen also mentioned
that he was looking forward to the
Big Game, because he felt sure that
there would undoubtedly be some
good items for "It's News to Me,"
his column on notable happenings,
resulting from the Big Game week
end.
Also reminiscent of life at Stan
ford is Caen's description of the life
that a columnist leads. Caen de
scribes a columnist as a man who is
expected to be on the job for 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Caen added further, "As a column
writer, I take my life in my hands
and run around town all day, and
then sit down and write stuff that
even embarrasses me."
The gathering of the material is
the difficult job in writing a col
umn, according to Herb Caen. Caen
has about 20 very reliable sources
for his information, and the rest of
his news he gathers himself or is
provided by obliging citizens.
"Thank Heaven for people who like
to see their name in print," com
mented Caen.
Columnist Caen told of the most
interesting person whom he had met
on his personal appearances for his
new book. In the book section of a
San Francisco department store, a
woman requested that Mr. Caen
write something sentimental for her
old aunt in the Middle West. Caen
obligingly wrote a whole page to
the old aunt. The woman thanked
him, read over the message, and
then proceeded to tear out the page,
which she crumpled and threw
away. Caen still cannot decide what
brought on the woman's reaction.
When asked why he chose the
name "Baghdad-Bv-lhc-Bay" for
his book, Caen replied that Bagh
dad is a romantic city, and that San
Francisco is also romantic with its
spires, bridges, and morning and
evenings fogs.
Caen is unmarried, and says that
with his jrib he just doesn't have
time to get married. He went to
school in Colorado, and then came
out to California to work on a Sac
rarnento paper. After "Sacramento,
Caen went to work on the San
Francisco Chronicle, and has been
(here ever since.
