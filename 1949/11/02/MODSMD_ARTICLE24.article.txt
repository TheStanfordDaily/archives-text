# At Last, A Concrete Plan
## 
### 
A comprehensive program for Stanford par
ticipation in the National Student Association
was laid before Excorn last week. It is the first
such plan to be presented during more than a
year of membership in NSA.
Campus NSA Co ordinator Barbara Levison
outlined this year's program as follows:
1. Campus participation will be directed by
a general committee consisting of a member
from Excorn and a member from Cardinals in
addition to the NSA co-ordinator who is ap
pointed by Excom. A representative from
AWS may be added to this group.
2. Additional committees will be appointed
from time to time to install certain NSA educa
tional and student life projects which are suit
able for successful operation on this campus.
Projects like a used textbook exchange and
the investigation of faculty-rating systems fall

in this class. Wherever possible, such pro
grams will be channeled to existing organiza
tions.
3. The committee's files on student activities
at other colleges and universities will be open
to all students. These records should prove in
valuable to organizations which have their
counterpart on other campuses. The commit
tee will also co-sponsor events involving other
campuses such as art exhibits, dance groups,
and inter-campus intramural playoffs.
4. National policies of NSA will be spot
lighted during winter guarter. Campus dis
cussion will give representatives to regional
and national assemblies an idea of how the
student body feels on issues like academic
freedom and federal aid to education.
In brief, that's the program. It has the unani
mous backing of Excom. It's up to us to make
it work.
