# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
For some people Wednesdays come easy. But for
me, they're all dark, dull, dead days. What I mean
to say simply is that there just isn't a thing to do.
I guess I could wait until tonight and go down to

watch the frosh march in the an
nual pajamarino, but after read
ing about what they've done to
that thing, I couldn't stand it.
I could go to Excom meetings
and try to look like a student
leader, but that would be ridicu
lous. 1 should live so long.
I could go over to the Book
store and get a book autographed
by Herb Caen, but he was there
yesterday and besides, I'd rather
buy 35 Eskimo Pies.

I could go to the Libe and study for my Social
Organizations midterm, but that would really be
pushing things.
I could go to the barber and get a hair-cut, but
if I do I guess I should get them all cut.
I could go to the Engineering Corner and cast a
ballot in today's primary, except that only freshmen

are eligible and I said To Hell With '51 a long time
ago.
I could go to the Post Office and see if I had any
mail, but I'd probably find a letter from somebody
saying how much he hated me, how dirty I am, how,
unfair, and gosh, that would make me cry.
I could go over behind the Beta House and practice
the axe-yell. Then, when Big Game comes around,
I'll impress everyone by being the only person to
know it.
I could make up a joke like, "When was the first
walking stick used?" Answer: It was in the days of
Adam and Eve. Eve gave Adam a little cain. Retort:
Didn't she give him another when she was Abel.
Conclusion: I could make up a joke.
I could go down to Paly and play the parking me
ters, but I hear that those things are fixed and never
pay off.
I could call it a day and forget it because I know
what a dull day Wednesday is and shouldn't fight it.
I should rest.
But before I do, I could pull this out of the type
writer, hand it to the editor, and call it a Bull
Session.

yesterday and besides, I'd rather
buy 35 Eskimo Pies.

I could go to the Libe and study for my Social
Organizations midterm, but that would really be
pushing things.
I could go to the barber and get a hair-cut, but
if I do I guess I should get them all cut.
I could go to the Engineering Corner and cast a
ballot in today's primary, except that only freshmen

are eligible and I said To Hell With '51 a long time
ago.
I could go to the Post Office and see if I had any
mail, but I'd probably find a letter from somebody
saying how much he hated me, how dirty I am, how,
unfair, and gosh, that would make me cry.
I could go over behind the Beta House and practice
the axe-yell. Then, when Big Game comes around,
I'll impress everyone by being the only person to
know it.
I could make up a joke like, "When was the first
walking stick used?" Answer: It was in the days of
Adam and Eve. Eve gave Adam a little cain. Retort:
Didn't she give him another when she was Abel.
Conclusion: I could make up a joke.
I could go down to Paly and play the parking me
ters, but I hear that those things are fixed and never
pay off.
I could call it a day and forget it because I know
what a dull day Wednesday is and shouldn't fight it.
I should rest.
But before I do, I could pull this out of the type
writer, hand it to the editor, and call it a Bull
Session.

For some people Wednesdays come easy. But for
me, they're all dark, dull, dead days. What I mean
to say simply is that there just isn't a thing to do.
I guess I could wait until tonight and go down to

watch the frosh march in the an
nual pajamarino, but after read
ing about what they've done to
that thing, I couldn't stand it.
I could go to Excom meetings
and try to look like a student
leader, but that would be ridicu
lous. 1 should live so long.
I could go over to the Book
store and get a book autographed
by Herb Caen, but he was there
yesterday and besides, I'd rather
buy 35 Eskimo Pies.
