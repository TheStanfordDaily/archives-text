# CAMPUS OPINION
## Extra Points 
### 
To the Editor:
Don't these freshmen hold anything sacred? All
the bitter games we have lost by extra point margins
(e.g, Cal, USC last year) and Master Goodwin is
sacrilegious enough to jest at the fervent prayers of
our yell leaders. Better he should add his petitions
to theirs.
