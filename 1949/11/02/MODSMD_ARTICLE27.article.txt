To the Editor:
It is bad enough that a university bookstore and
l university newspaper should promote such chau
vinistic, sub-literary clap-trap as, f'l instance, Herb
Caen's "Baghdad-By-The-Bay." The offense be
comes worse in light of the fact that nothing similar
has ever been done lor such serious efforts as, f'rex
ample, Boris Ilyin's "Green Boundary," Jane Eck
lund's "The Only Gift," Richard North's "Revolt in
Si:n Marcos," or the volumes "Poets of the Pacific"
and "Stanford Short Stories," all of which were
written at this University, some with the help of
Stanford fellowships and literary prizes. They have
all received critical comment, much of it favorable,
and will in the long run do a great deal more for the
Farm than, f'rinstance, either Rally Com or (he Big
Red Machine.
No Beaucaens to you.
