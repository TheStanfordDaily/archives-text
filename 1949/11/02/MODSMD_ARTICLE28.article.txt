# Rooters' Rating Test
## 
### 
To the Student Body, c/o the Editor:
With what I hope is the last scathing letter re
Rally Com, "Rooting" Section, et al, I make this
earnest attempt to place the blame for you know
what where it belongs—with YOU, dear reader, the
lethargic, fault-finding member of the rooting sec
tion. This doesn't apply to all of you, but, if the shoe
fits, beat yourself on the head with it. And a hearty
slap on the back to the few who have the guts to

stand on their own two lungs and yell amid apathy
and sell-righteous criticism.
Rally Com is trying to do a good job, but, must I
say it, they do need your support. Dean Borba is a
competent showman, a sincere leader, and a well
meaning guy. All the members of Rally Com want
to do their best, in fact, some of the coeds are fairly
bursting with enthusiasm. (Go ahead, ya punks,
make a moral issue out of that!) But what kind of
a "tank town" are they playing to?
Take this self-searching quiz—score one for each
affirmative answer.
1. Do I cheer even when things aren't peachy
keen?
2. Do I give a damn who wins anyway?
If so, have I the intestinal fortitude to cheer
alone?
4. Do I try to follow the cheer leaders?
5. Could I do as well as they do?
6. Could I do half as well?
7. Do I?
Score—7, Rally Com members; C-4, good rooters;
.1-2, schmos; 1, schnooks; 0, Letters-to-the-Editor
gripers about Rally Com.
To most of you with good intentions I'd say, if you
want to sit in the rooting section, root; if not, g'wan
home. I also have a message for those misguided
quibblers, ably headed by Dan Goodwin, Class of '53
(He should live so long), who dig down deep, I mean
really deep, for some trifle to misconstrue and be
come indignant about. They may come and I'll
whisper it in their ears. I'm sure they'll find it real
inspiring.

meaning guy. All the members of Rally Com want
to do their best, in fact, some of the coeds are fairly
bursting with enthusiasm. (Go ahead, ya punks,
make a moral issue out of that!) But what kind of
a "tank town" are they playing to?
Take this self-searching quiz—score one for each
affirmative answer.
1. Do I cheer even when things aren't peachy
keen?
2. Do I give a damn who wins anyway?
If so, have I the intestinal fortitude to cheer
alone?
4. Do I try to follow the cheer leaders?
5. Could I do as well as they do?
6. Could I do half as well?
7. Do I?
Score—7, Rally Com members; C-4, good rooters;
.1-2, schmos; 1, schnooks; 0, Letters-to-the-Editor
gripers about Rally Com.
To most of you with good intentions I'd say, if you
want to sit in the rooting section, root; if not, g'wan
home. I also have a message for those misguided
quibblers, ably headed by Dan Goodwin, Class of '53
(He should live so long), who dig down deep, I mean
really deep, for some trifle to misconstrue and be
come indignant about. They may come and I'll
whisper it in their ears. I'm sure they'll find it real
inspiring.

To the Student Body, c/o the Editor:
With what I hope is the last scathing letter re
Rally Com, "Rooting" Section, et al, I make this
earnest attempt to place the blame for you know
what where it belongs—with YOU, dear reader, the
lethargic, fault-finding member of the rooting sec
tion. This doesn't apply to all of you, but, if the shoe
fits, beat yourself on the head with it. And a hearty
slap on the back to the few who have the guts to

stand on their own two lungs and yell amid apathy
and sell-righteous criticism.
Rally Com is trying to do a good job, but, must I
say it, they do need your support. Dean Borba is a
competent showman, a sincere leader, and a well
meaning guy. All the members of Rally Com want
to do their best, in fact, some of the coeds are fairly
bursting with enthusiasm. (Go ahead, ya punks,
make a moral issue out of that!) But what kind of
