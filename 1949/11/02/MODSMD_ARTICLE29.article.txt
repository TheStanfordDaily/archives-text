# Ride Signs
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Your recent editorial regarding ride signs at Palm
Drive on campus produced an improvement. Hope
same will be possible on Village end.
The signs have completely disappeared as of today.
First the Campus one over the weekend, and the
Palo Alto one today.
Can you notify the powers (hat be?
