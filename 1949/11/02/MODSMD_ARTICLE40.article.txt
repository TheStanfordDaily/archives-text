Indians 'Fired of Trojan Drought;
From Here On In, li s A!I or Nought
This nervous disease of the typewriter which has been whipping out
USC victory stories has got to go. That's what 1 wrote at the end of last
spring quarter.
That was after Stanford had finished its most dismal year in history
against the men from Southern California. The Indians had dropped four
straight in basketball*, bad loct three straight in baseball, had been hu
miliated in tennis and golf, had missed even in swimming, and had blown
the track meet.
Beyond that, they had lost to Troy in football, to make it a year
of complete drought.
As yet, except for the water polo win over Troy, Stanford has not done
much to rid itself of the disease of the Terrible Trojan.
But on Sautrday iri the Los Angeles Coliseum, the football-playing
branch of the Indian Tribe will get a clear shot at the Thundering Herd.
One shot will do it.
News Clippings Not Fluttering to Men of Troy
But it will take Hopalong Cassidy's aim to knock USC out of the way
and end this sickness. The Trojans are not about to make a present ol
this one. Besides, Cravath has a better ballclub down there than the
season, records and the newspaper clippings indicate.
USC, not Celeri and California, should be leading the PCC race right
now. The Trojans have a better team than California. They will be tougher
for Stanford to beat than California.
So, Saturday's struggle is the pitch for the moon. It's the jackpot ques
tion in advance. It's the deal with all the chips on the table. It's the now
-01-never crucial, and anybody who would tell you otherwise, is a long
way from the other side of left.
It's a good sipn that the largest traveling root-root section in Stanford
histoiy is heading south. The rioters can help.
It's also a favorable condition to be playing this one in the Coliseum,
because for Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian, Bob White, Dick Horn, Wes
Poulson, Russ Pomeroy, and Gordy Rice, it's going to be homecoming and
tune to impress the folks.
Southern (lal Favored lint Injuns Can Upset
Odds favor the Trojans. But odds are odd. Sometimes good, fired-up
football teams make monkeys out of odds.
A single man such as Rupe Andrews could make southern sportswriters
embarrassed over their early-season All-American shoutings for USC's
ends, Hal Hatfield and Bob Stillwell.
Andrews, for a man who receives a lot of praise, doesn't get enough.
How about .that play in the Santa Clara game when Kerkorian gave Rupe
a pitchout in the end zone. Before Rupe even got the ball tucked under
his arm, two Broncos were on him and it looked like a sure safety.
But he supplied the Andrews magic and shook loose to get the tall back
into the playing field. If it had been anybody else, Santa Clara would have
won the game, 9 to 7.
The return of Poulson, Pomeroy, and Abraham—the Three Knees —will
be further insurance of a top Stanford effort on Saturday.
And finally, a corny and time-worn substance, that old Stanford Spirit
is going to rise up Saturday to end the sickness, to wash out the drought,
to cure for sure this menace of the Terrible Trojan. Past or no past,
that's the way I'm picking it this week.
If you don't believe me, you're probably right.
