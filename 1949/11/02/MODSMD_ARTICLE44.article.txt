# Frosh Cage Squad Cut to 25 Members
## 
### 
Frosh Basketball Coach Bob Bur
nett yesterday surveyed his squad
of 25, now in its third week of fall
drills, and summarized optimisti
cally:
"Though we may lack the indi
vidual standouts that sparked the
once - defeated 1948-49 team, we
have the material and team depth
to give a good account of ourselves
this coming season."
The yearlings take to the hard
woods thrice this quarter, opening
with Antioch High on December 1.
They then enjoy a Christmas re
cess, returning for the bulk of their
18-game campaign in January. Top
ping the slate are four traditional
tilts with California's Cubs.
Since the inception of practice 15
days ago, Burnett has gleaned the
nucleus of the 1949-50 Papooses
from the original turnout of 55. Five
more arc to get the axe before the
December 1 tip-off.
A pair of former Lowell High ca
sabans, Bill' Stevenson and Fritz
Fenster, should prove mainstays in
the frosh attack, according to Bur
nett. Stevenson, a center, towers at
six feet six inches. Fenster is a
six-foot one-inch guard.
Another top contender for a guard
post is George Ziainovich from Del
ano High. Dave Steward and Jack
Cosgrove were deemed "good for
ward candidates" by Burnett. Six
foot four-inch Steward is from San
Rafael High, while Cosgrove hails
from Los Angeles.
Other leading candidates named
by the frosh mentor were:
Bob Thorsen, Chicago; Wayne
McClusky, St. Louis; Bob Mace,
Dickson, Calif.; and Paul Johnson,
El Monte.
