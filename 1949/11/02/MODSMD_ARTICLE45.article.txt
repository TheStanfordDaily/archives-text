# Three Injured Frosh Return For Cal Game
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor's hopes for a
full strength lineup seemed brighter
yesterday afternoon as the freshman
gridders prepped for Cal. Only
three men failed to operate in the
scheduled scrimmage.
Skip Crist, wearing a brace on his
knee, stayed out of the rough stuff,
and continued to loosen up his legs.
Out for two weeks, the burly half
back will scrimmage this afternoon
to test the healed knee wrench.
"I sure would like to get into that
Cal game," the Skipper hoped. "It
feels all right; I just won't lie able
to cut one way. I guess I'll have to
go through 'em."
Another back who sat out last
Saturday's game, Tommy Van Sant,
spent the practice by sprinting the
sidelines with Crist. Van Sant's
pulled thigh muscle should be okay
for the Bear crucial, and his top de
fensive halfbaeking will be a definite
strengthener.
Still nursing a bruised right ankle
which took him out of the San Jose
game, Carter Pyle, who played well
on the line, was the third sideliner.
His ankle is not serious enough to
keep him from getting into the Little
Big Game. Pyle also expects to
scrimmage today.
A 1 Peterson, who broke into the
starting lineup at halfback, re
bruised his leg. Never completely
healed, the injury is not too serious.
No other men complained of any
aches or pains, and barring any mis
haps during the remainder of the
week, the Papooses will be at peak
shape.
Last night, the entire squad was
shown a couple of reels of last year's
Cal - Stanford frosh football game.
Coach Taylor explained, "We
wanted the team to see the Cal sys
tem. It's just about the same."
