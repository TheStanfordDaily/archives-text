## SIRO Sponsors Drive to Aid European Students With TB 
### 
Leysin, Switzerland, has established a number of sanatoriums
which deal specifically with selected European university stu
dents who have been afflicted with tuberculosis but could re
cover with the proper treatment.
Only a small portion of the students who apply can be handled,

these few being selected on the
basis of their future potential lead
ership concerning European recov
ery programs. Students majoring in
law, political science, medicine, and
engineering are Riven priority, from
which group selections are made ac
cording to scholastic average and
qualities of leadership.
This service for European stu
dents is supported by students in
the United States through an organ
ization known as the World Stu
dent Service Fund. WSSF appeals
only to students and professors, and
its funds are used expressly for stu
dents and educators in other coun
tries. The organization is sponsored
by the National Student Association
and by religious groups of all de
nominations.
At Stanford, WSSF operates
through the Stanford International
Relief Organization, which raises a
part of its funds in its annual fall
drive, now under way.
An international organization, the
Wor'd Student Relief, administers
funds from WSSF and from similar
groups in 19 other countries. Aid is
distributed according to need and is
not touched by governmental au
thority, but directly by World Stu
dent Relief.
The tuberculosis sanatoria repre
sent only one aspect of the work be
ing done. The many others include
rest homes for students distin
guished because of abilities as lead
ers, medical aid, and the supplying
of books and equipment.
An outstanding example of the
way in which the World Student
Relief program works is the case of
Yugoslavia. Although still in need
of aid themselves, Yugoslav students
feel that they have progressed to a
point where they can help students
in other countries, and have volun
teered to do so.
The main purpose of the WSSF
program is not simply one of char
ity. In aiding the future leaders of
Europe and Asia, they are paving
the way for world recovery.
