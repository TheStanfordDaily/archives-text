## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 2 (/»»)—'The
University of California's famed
Campanile is tumbling down —so
state officials voted today to spend
$15,000 to find out how to put it
together again.
But not until State Finance Di
rector James S. Dean suggested at
a Public Works Board meeting:
"Let Stanford paint it red. The
paint migth hold it."
Dean made his remark with a
laugh after University Controller
James H. Corley declared that
"quite sizeable chunks" of granite
facing arc falling off the tower—
and that a fence has been built
around Hs base to keep people at a
safe distance.
Assembly Speaker Sam Collins,
Fullerton, a board member, asked
just what the Campanile is used for
and winced at Corley's estimate that
it may cost $300,000 to re-face the
tower.
Straight-faced, Collins asked:
"Couldn't the pieces that arc fall
ing off be sold for souvenirs?"
Told that the Campanile serves
as a landmark for the university,
Collins asked if it couldn't be lo
cated without it.
Finance Chief Dean suggested to
Collins that he introduce a bill in
the legislature to have to tower
torn down.
"Just let, it fall," answered the
Southern California!!.
University Engineer R. A. Weaver
followed by testifying that unless
the tower is reconditioned the only
alternative is to raze it.
And then Collins joined the rest
of the board to vote the $15,000 for
the Golden Bear. He blamed "pres
sure" for his decision.
