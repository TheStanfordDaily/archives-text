## New Service To Make Ski Reservations 
### 
Permission to operate on the
Stanford campus was given to Stu
dents Ski Service at a meeting of
the Student - Faculty Employment
Committee yesterday.
Students Ski Service has been or
ganized to help students at all of
the universities and colleges in the
Bay Area. Through the service, stu
dents will be able to place reserva
tions with practically every ski
lodge in Northern California. There
will be no extra charge to the stu
dent.
The service will be able to make
reservations until the Tuesday be
fore the weekend, for the benefit of
skiers who decide to go to the Sier
ras at the last minute.
Students who wish to ski need
only to call the Stanford campus
representative. A down payment
must be placed wtili him by Wed
nesday of the week. The Stanford
representative is Dave McKean. He
may be contacted at Alpha Delta
Phi. His phone number is DA
3-8771.
At the present time, Students Ski
Service is making reservations for
Echo Chalet and Squaw Valley over
the Thanksgiving weekend, and for
lodges at Donner Summit, Echo
Summit, and Lake Tahoe over the
Christmas vacation. Stanford's holi
day begins on December 16.
Students Ski Service was organ
ized this year by two Stanford stu
dents, Hu Fox and Bob Berka. The
service operates on a 10 per cent
commission from the lodges where
reservations are made.
From time to time, busloads will
be organized to take students to the
snow. Right now a trip is being
planned to Echo Chalet over
Thanksgiving by Dave McKcan.
