# Excom Calls For By-Law Clarification
## 
### 
Excom yesterday called for an in
terpretation by the Law School of
the ASSU by-law which provides
minimum unit requirements for
Men's Council candidates."
The by-law states that a candidate
for the Council must have completed
105 units of work, but 135 units were
required of the candidates nomi
nated for next week's election to fill
the Council post recently vacated
when Fred Cummings resigned.
Cummings was elected last winter
quarter, having completed 105 units,
and took office spring quarter with
120 units. At present he has com
pleted 135 units and this was set up
by Election Board as minimum re
quirement for candidates to fill his
post on Council until the end of
winter quarter.
Cummings yesterday told Excom
that the requirement should be 120
units, since that was understood to
be the requirement for taking office
on Council. Excom then voted to
reopen the nominations, setting up
the lower minimum.
Excom later rescinded this mo
tion after Cliff Carlsen, Election
Board chairman, stated if the
nominations were reopened there
would probably be enough addition
al nominations to make a second
primary election necessary.
Nominations will continue to be
closed pending Excom action fol
lowing the Law School interpreta
tion of the controversial by-law.
Excom unanimously approved the
primary election results. It also re
vised the by-law governing duties
of the Activities Reviewing Com
mittee to read "will co-ordinate and
promote campus social activities."
Stricken from the by-law was the
clause which made it the duty of the
committee to "formulate social prac
tices and procedures."
Jan O'Brien and Tim Michaud
explained that the committee is not
set up to handle such a responsibil
ity and recommneded that a new
committee be formed for this pur
pose.
Rewritten Encina Club constitu
tion was approved by Excom, as was
a modification of the Roblc Hall
quiet hours. Also approved were
revisions of the WAA constitution
providing for additional officers, to
be a recording secretary, a corre
sponding secretary, and a publicity
director.
Flying Club award was again re
viewed by Excom and rejected
pending a new recommendation by
the Flying Club coach that the
Winged "S" be awarded.
Excom heard reports on the SIRO
drive and on the debate team's plans
for participation in the Western
Speech Association meeting at Stan
ford.
The following open dances were
approved: Stern Hall open house,
2:30 to 5 p.m., November 13; Chinese
Club off-campus dance, November
19; Phi Sigma Kappa dance, Janu

Rewritten Encina Club constitu
tion was approved by Excom, as was
a modification of the Roblc Hall
quiet hours. Also approved were
revisions of the WAA constitution
providing for additional officers, to
be a recording secretary, a corre
sponding secretary, and a publicity
director.
Flying Club award was again re
viewed by Excom and rejected
pending a new recommendation by
the Flying Club coach that the
Winged "S" be awarded.
Excom heard reports on the SIRO
drive and on the debate team's plans
for participation in the Western
Speech Association meeting at Stan
ford.
The following open dances were
approved: Stern Hall open house,
2:30 to 5 p.m., November 13; Chinese
Club off-campus dance, November
19; Phi Sigma Kappa dance, Janu
ary 7.
Excom yesterday called for an in
terpretation by the Law School of
the ASSU by-law which provides
minimum unit requirements for
Men's Council candidates."
The by-law states that a candidate
for the Council must have completed
105 units of work, but 135 units were
required of the candidates nomi
nated for next week's election to fill
the Council post recently vacated
when Fred Cummings resigned.
Cummings was elected last winter
quarter, having completed 105 units,
and took office spring quarter with
120 units. At present he has com
pleted 135 units and this was set up
by Election Board as minimum re
quirement for candidates to fill his
post on Council until the end of
winter quarter.
Cummings yesterday told Excom
that the requirement should be 120
units, since that was understood to
be the requirement for taking office
on Council. Excom then voted to
reopen the nominations, setting up
the lower minimum.
Excom later rescinded this mo
tion after Cliff Carlsen, Election
Board chairman, stated if the
nominations were reopened there
would probably be enough addition
al nominations to make a second
primary election necessary.
Nominations will continue to be
closed pending Excom action fol
lowing the Law School interpreta
tion of the controversial by-law.
Excom unanimously approved the
primary election results. It also re
vised the by-law governing duties
of the Activities Reviewing Com
mittee to read "will co-ordinate and
promote campus social activities."
Stricken from the by-law was the
clause which made it the duty of the
committee to "formulate social prac
tices and procedures."
Jan O'Brien and Tim Michaud
explained that the committee is not
set up to handle such a responsibil
ity and recommneded that a new
committee be formed for this pur
pose.
