# 'Beggar' to Open Tonight
## Kenny Cast In Top Role 
### 
The Stanford Players open
their 1949-50 dramatic season to
morrow night with a full-fledged
production of the Kaufman and
Connelly farce, "Beggar On
Horseback." The play is sched
uled for performance in the
Memorial Auditorium with cur
tain time set at 8:15. Repeat per
formances will be given on Fri
day and Saturday nights.
"Beggar On Horseback," which
was originally produced on Broad
way in 1924, is the Stanford Players'
first production of a comedy during
the regular season for several years.
The presentation tomorrow night
marks the first of a series of three
comedies that have been planned
for this season.
FANTASTIC COMEDY
The play, aptly sub-titled "a fan
tastic comedy," is the story of a
struggling musician who must
choose between true art and pov
erty or financial security through
marriage to the somewhat flighty
daughter of a "widgit" manufac
turer. The choice is made after a
series of dream sequences which
disclose to the young musician his
fate if he hooks up with the socially
and culturally incompatible "wid
git" family.
Around the dream sequences,
George Kaufman and Marc Connelly
have built a vex*y penetrating satire
of the nouveau riche and modern
society in general. The result is a
set of broad and devastating comic
situations.
CAST OF 50
Heading a cast of nearly 50, parts
are William Kenny, in the role of
the harried hero, Neil Mcßae; and
Ann Guilbert and Hope Sterling as
the two women he must choose be
tween.
Other featured players in the cast
are Lewis Jfosse as the newly-rich
"widgit" manufacturer, Ann Law
der as his wife, and George Denny
as their son, Homer.
Also included in the cast are Jane
Mac Arthur, Carol Eller, Jane Allen,
Jeffrey Kurz, Frank Wolff, Walter
Minninger, Stanley Pyron, Woody
Paulin, Ralph Stevens, Richard
Jones, Guy Lamme, Robert Decker,
Nicholas Gilroy, William Oyler,
Richard Cox, John Stackpole, and
Richard Scothorn.
F. Cowles Strickland, associate
professor of speech and drama, is di
recting the play. According to Mr.
Strickland, the Stanford company
has tried to carry out the theme of
the farce as fully as possible.
NEW TECHNIQUES
Since the dream sequence moves
swiftly from scene to scene without
the traditional drops for changes,
the Stanford Players are employing
several new theatrical techniques.
For example, much of the scen
ery is being hung on ropes from the
top of the stage so that it may be
lowered and raised quickly as it is
needed. Another innovation is the
use of Linnebach lamps to project
large hand-painted slides onto a cy
cloramic backdrop.
Sets for the play have been de
signed by Wendell Cole. Costuming
and makeup is under the direction
of Virginia Opsvig.
Tickets for the play, at 90 cents,
are available at the Memorial Audi
torium box office. All seats are re
served.


WILLIAM KENNY, as the harrassed Neil Mcßae, attempts to talk himself out of another amusing
situation with the "widgit" daughter and mother, played by Ann Guilbert and Ann Lawder.
These three will appear with nearly 50 other students in the three-day presentation of "Beggar
On Horseback." The student dramatists will present the fantastic comedy tonight, tomorrow, and
Saturday in the Little Theater. ' —photo by Dave Rosenthal

marks the first of a series of three
comedies that have been planned
for this season.
FANTASTIC COMEDY
The play, aptly sub-titled "a fan
tastic comedy," is the story of a
struggling musician who must
choose between true art and pov
erty or financial security through
marriage to the somewhat flighty
daughter of a "widgit" manufac
turer. The choice is made after a
series of dream sequences which
disclose to the young musician his
fate if he hooks up with the socially
and culturally incompatible "wid
git" family.
Around the dream sequences,
George Kaufman and Marc Connelly
have built a vex*y penetrating satire
of the nouveau riche and modern
society in general. The result is a
set of broad and devastating comic
situations.
CAST OF 50
Heading a cast of nearly 50, parts
are William Kenny, in the role of
the harried hero, Neil Mcßae; and
Ann Guilbert and Hope Sterling as
the two women he must choose be
tween.
Other featured players in the cast
are Lewis Jfosse as the newly-rich
"widgit" manufacturer, Ann Law
der as his wife, and George Denny
as their son, Homer.
Also included in the cast are Jane
Mac Arthur, Carol Eller, Jane Allen,
Jeffrey Kurz, Frank Wolff, Walter
Minninger, Stanley Pyron, Woody
Paulin, Ralph Stevens, Richard
Jones, Guy Lamme, Robert Decker,
Nicholas Gilroy, William Oyler,
Richard Cox, John Stackpole, and
Richard Scothorn.
F. Cowles Strickland, associate
professor of speech and drama, is di
recting the play. According to Mr.
Strickland, the Stanford company
has tried to carry out the theme of
the farce as fully as possible.
NEW TECHNIQUES
Since the dream sequence moves
swiftly from scene to scene without
the traditional drops for changes,
the Stanford Players are employing
several new theatrical techniques.
For example, much of the scen
ery is being hung on ropes from the
top of the stage so that it may be
lowered and raised quickly as it is
needed. Another innovation is the
use of Linnebach lamps to project
large hand-painted slides onto a cy
cloramic backdrop.
Sets for the play have been de
signed by Wendell Cole. Costuming
and makeup is under the direction
of Virginia Opsvig.
Tickets for the play, at 90 cents,
are available at the Memorial Audi
torium box office. All seats are re
served.


WILLIAM KENNY, as the harrassed Neil Mcßae, attempts to talk himself out of another amusing
situation with the "widgit" daughter and mother, played by Ann Guilbert and Ann Lawder.
These three will appear with nearly 50 other students in the three-day presentation of "Beggar
On Horseback." The student dramatists will present the fantastic comedy tonight, tomorrow, and
Saturday in the Little Theater. ' —photo by Dave Rosenthal
