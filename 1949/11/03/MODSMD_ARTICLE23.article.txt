Clad in gaudy pajamas, the men
of the Class of '53 marched to Roble
last night to start the annual Fresh
man Pajamarino.
After gathering at Encina at 7, the
men and the Stanford Band pro
ceeded to Roble, where freshman
women from Branner and off-cam
pus towns were also gathered. Dur
ing the first part of the program
the men and women serenaded each
other with alternate songs.
The rest of the program was de
voted to a rally for the Frosh Little
Big Game this Saturday. After the
members of the team were intro
duced, the freshmen gave two yells.
The first, given by the girl, was
punctuated with cries of "Louder!"
from the boys. The boys yelled next
and the girls shouted back in re
venge.
Following the rally, the freshmen
adjourned to Encina for dancing un
