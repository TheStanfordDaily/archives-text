# That Cellar Coffee
## 
### 
Eesides the weather, another thing that
everybody talks about and nobody does any
thing about is Cellar coffee.
The coffee sold outside at the snack bar isn't
so bad, except lor the bees, but the brew
served inside defies description.
What's the trouble? The same popular brand
of coffse is used in both places. Yet one tastes
like coffee and the other tastes like hell.
V/e understand the urns that hold the coffee
served downstairs are in bad shape, to say the
least. In fact, the protective nickel finish inside

them has worn off, leaving the copper base next
to the coffee.
The coffee, held for several hours at high
temperatures in this way, reacts chemically
with the copper. The result is a compound that
is little more like coflee than salt is like sodium.
The solution seems to be a new urn, or urns.
If nickel coffee cannot finance them, perhaps
money can be found elsewhere. Maybe an urn
fund would have to be set up.
Surely, at least, when the restaurant in the
Tresidder Union is built, it will have new urns
and good coffee. â€”M.H.
