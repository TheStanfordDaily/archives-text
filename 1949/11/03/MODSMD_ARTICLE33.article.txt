# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
As of now, United States Highway No. 101 is be
ginning to come alive with red jackets, Stanford style
Cadillacs, and those animal-like things called stu
dents. Together, they have started the annual pil-

grimage to the Southland.
There is some question as to
whether or not the Stanl'ord-USC
varsity football game is the fea
ture attraction.
The first place people are land
ing is the New Embassy Room at
the plushy and lushy Ambassa
dor Hotel.
They tell me that it's going to
be a great party and rally and
everything. Dean Borba will be
there for the rally part, as will

coaches Marchie and Jeff, and sports-scribe Dick
Hyland. For the party part, there will be vast as
sortments of old grads and just us plain old students.
What I mean to point out is that everybody who is
anybody will be there at the Embassy Room between
the hours of 6:30 and 9:30 tomorrow night.
It figures to be the greatest get-together since those
guys back in the Dark Ages put on a jolly-up called
the Crusades.
At the Embassy, they're serving sandwiches, real
regular drinking fluids, songs, pep-talks, and 10 to 1
odds that the Indians will upset the Trojans.
And finally, I have it on good authority that the
Stanford Axe-Yell will be given. Hot Zam, that I've
got to see.
I'll meet you there.

Tlie mass-move to the Los Angeles region is al
ways a sure-fire party-time. But those spots listed
in The Daily yesterday were strictly from hunger,
and that's what you'll be suffering from by Sunday,
night if you hit any of them on Friday or Saturday.
There's nothing like a little check from the Grove,
Slapsie Maxie's, Charlie Foy's, or the Mocambo to
ruin a good weekend.
So, at great expense and research, I have come up
with another "L.A. Roundup," more appropriate for
the paupers, and designed to give any sucker an even
break.
I've also got a code: B is for bar, D is for dump, E
is for eeeow, and J is for joint, which all of them are:
EDDIE'S OASIS—A reel-reet place. located on
Western Blvd., near Trojan-town. Just ask any drunk
which way to go. Lots of class with a floor-show that
is guaranteed. Frankie Laine got his start here.
Don't let the smoke bother you, oxygen tents can be
rented at the -bar. Rate B, D, J.
FLAPS DOWN—On a hill, usually windy and high.
No floor-show, no floor, no waitresses, no tables, but
the drinks are cheap. That is if you don't mind pay
ing 30 cents for Scotch and soda. Rate: E.
ACE CAlN'S—Near Hollywood Blvd. on Western
Avenue. They make noise here, among other things.
It's always best after a few tilts of the elbow. Rate:
Bring your own aspirin.
THE FLAMINGO—On La Brea off Sunset, but
you've been to enough places already. Go home be
fore they find you in that disreputable condition.
Better yet, go back to the Embassy Room—the old
grads will just be getting warmed up.
That's hall for today.
