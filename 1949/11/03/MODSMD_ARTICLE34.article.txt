Big Game Dates
To the Editor:
Mr. John Hall must replly mean it when he says
"To hell with Stanford women," in Monday's Bull
Session. He must not even want them to have any
fun Big Game night. His statements are definitely
misleading.
He says that the Stanford women are all dated up
lor Big Game night. Last year at this time Bull Ses

sion came out with the same attitude. And the result
was that a large number of girls stayed home that
night. Many girls missed Big Game night who had
dates almost every other Friday and Saturday nights
of the year.
Standard jokes are sometimes more harmful than
amusing.
