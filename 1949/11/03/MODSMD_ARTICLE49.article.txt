## Our Spirit Is Lax, That Is True; But We Have No Right to Be So Blue

This week's AP football poll rates the USC Trojans number 12 in the
country with 110 votes. UCLA is way down the line with two points.
Stanford isn't mentioned.
Yet, the bookies have called it USC by 8 over Stanford this Saturday.
Figure it out, I can't.
but then the polls and the pre-season guessers are so often wrong, so
very wrong.
This was Stanford's year, many of the San Francisco writers claimed.
The Curds were Ro:;e Bowl tagged from the start by many. Most of these
writers had never even seen the Cards play, or practice, since the 11)48
Big Came.
Mostly Sophs, Keincmhei'
So what happens? The student body expects great things, never stop
ping to think that 15 members of the squad were sophomores and that five
lit those would be playing first-string ball.
Then the Cards go on to pile up a four-win, two-loss, one-tie record.
The student body relaxes. By this time they had expected the Indians to
be all-victorious. Well, maybe they could have lost to Michigan, is the
thought.
Then the reaction sets in. Letters to the Editor, Daily columns, and talks
about the campus, ;:l! take up the subject, "What is the matter with the
rooing section?"
Two of the letters to the editor, those by Phil Duffy and Seotty Shane,
woiild do credit to a first-rate psychologist. Of course, the lack of real
action in the looting section is to be blamed on each and every individual
in that rooting section.

One of the reasons for this lack of pep, spirit, or whatever it is that is
lacking, is the aforementioned pre-season write-ups. Stanford had, and
has, a good ball club. But not a great team. Not yet. I think we are still
fi year away from fielding a team that will go all the way. This year's frosh
squad, while boasting no great individuals, is a sound team. The backs are
not of the 11*48 variety, but the line is one of the best yet.
Thus far this year, the varsity has been coasting. What I mean is, the
rough road is ahead. USC and Cal are tough. Observers at the Cal-USC
game tell me that USC was really the better team. They should have
won that game.
So this week we travel south to meet that USC team. For three years
now the.Cards have played their best game in the Coliseum.
They Loved Us in L.A.
Will we do it Saturday? If so we will win. The Cards have their best
game yet within them. If they win Saturday, I think they will win the
rest.
And they will win if we are behind them all the way. Stanford has a
line reputation in the Southland. Our teams and rooting sections have
been at their best there.
Here is a sample of the impression we left on the last trip. Frank Lowery
of the Inglewood Daily News had this to say after the 1948 UCLA game:
"It has been a long time since I lived in Northern California and I'd
forgotten that the students up there seem to display more pep and imagi
nation at football games than our local rooting sections.
"BuLit was brought home Saturday at the Coliseum when a small
hunch *ii Stanford rooters, plus their band, even had the Bruin fans with
them for their efforts. Yell leaders in hula skirts, Indians prancing
around, pom-pons waving, card stunts, a band that was seldom quiet,
and tin? most enthusiastic bunch of kids you ever wanted to see.
"This, despite the fact that Stanford had won only ONE game in the
past two years. Maybe we're too sophisticated down here, or maybe we
just don't care."
Which gives us something to think about. So let's stop thinking we have
to have a world-beater before we show our appreciation.
This year's team is far and away better than last year's outfit. But that
doesn't make it great. We are getting back up there after a long, hard
1 it j 111. Many of us seniors hoped that this would be the year. Maybe it
will. But if we don't make the Rose Bowl this year .... we had no busi
ness asking for it in the first place.
And one last request .... please, please, give the Axe Yell down
South. A whole generation is growing up around us that will never know
the thrill of hearing a Stanford rooting section giving out with one of
the most famous yells in the land.

One of the reasons for this lack of pep, spirit, or whatever it is that is
lacking, is the aforementioned pre-season write-ups. Stanford had, and
has, a good ball club. But not a great team. Not yet. I think we are still
fi year away from fielding a team that will go all the way. This year's frosh
squad, while boasting no great individuals, is a sound team. The backs are
not of the 11*48 variety, but the line is one of the best yet.
Thus far this year, the varsity has been coasting. What I mean is, the
rough road is ahead. USC and Cal are tough. Observers at the Cal-USC
game tell me that USC was really the better team. They should have
won that game.
So this week we travel south to meet that USC team. For three years
now the.Cards have played their best game in the Coliseum.
They Loved Us in L.A.
Will we do it Saturday? If so we will win. The Cards have their best
game yet within them. If they win Saturday, I think they will win the
rest.
And they will win if we are behind them all the way. Stanford has a
line reputation in the Southland. Our teams and rooting sections have
been at their best there.
Here is a sample of the impression we left on the last trip. Frank Lowery
of the Inglewood Daily News had this to say after the 1948 UCLA game:
"It has been a long time since I lived in Northern California and I'd
forgotten that the students up there seem to display more pep and imagi
nation at football games than our local rooting sections.
"BuLit was brought home Saturday at the Coliseum when a small
hunch *ii Stanford rooters, plus their band, even had the Bruin fans with
them for their efforts. Yell leaders in hula skirts, Indians prancing
around, pom-pons waving, card stunts, a band that was seldom quiet,
and tin? most enthusiastic bunch of kids you ever wanted to see.
"This, despite the fact that Stanford had won only ONE game in the
past two years. Maybe we're too sophisticated down here, or maybe we
just don't care."
Which gives us something to think about. So let's stop thinking we have
to have a world-beater before we show our appreciation.
This year's team is far and away better than last year's outfit. But that
doesn't make it great. We are getting back up there after a long, hard
1 it j 111. Many of us seniors hoped that this would be the year. Maybe it
will. But if we don't make the Rose Bowl this year .... we had no busi
ness asking for it in the first place.
And one last request .... please, please, give the Axe Yell down
South. A whole generation is growing up around us that will never know
the thrill of hearing a Stanford rooting section giving out with one of
the most famous yells in the land.
This week's AP football poll rates the USC Trojans number 12 in the
country with 110 votes. UCLA is way down the line with two points.
Stanford isn't mentioned.
Yet, the bookies have called it USC by 8 over Stanford this Saturday.
Figure it out, I can't.
but then the polls and the pre-season guessers are so often wrong, so
very wrong.
This was Stanford's year, many of the San Francisco writers claimed.
The Curds were Ro:;e Bowl tagged from the start by many. Most of these
writers had never even seen the Cards play, or practice, since the 11)48
Big Came.
Mostly Sophs, Keincmhei'
So what happens? The student body expects great things, never stop
ping to think that 15 members of the squad were sophomores and that five
lit those would be playing first-string ball.
Then the Cards go on to pile up a four-win, two-loss, one-tie record.
The student body relaxes. By this time they had expected the Indians to
be all-victorious. Well, maybe they could have lost to Michigan, is the
thought.

won that game.
So this week we travel south to meet that USC team. For three years
now the.Cards have played their best game in the Coliseum.
They Loved Us in L.A.
Will we do it Saturday? If so we will win. The Cards have their best
game yet within them. If they win Saturday, I think they will win the
rest.
And they will win if we are behind them all the way. Stanford has a
line reputation in the Southland. Our teams and rooting sections have
been at their best there.
Here is a sample of the impression we left on the last trip. Frank Lowery
of the Inglewood Daily News had this to say after the 1948 UCLA game:
"It has been a long time since I lived in Northern California and I'd
forgotten that the students up there seem to display more pep and imagi
nation at football games than our local rooting sections.
"BuLit was brought home Saturday at the Coliseum when a small
hunch *ii Stanford rooters, plus their band, even had the Bruin fans with
them for their efforts. Yell leaders in hula skirts, Indians prancing
around, pom-pons waving, card stunts, a band that was seldom quiet,
and tin? most enthusiastic bunch of kids you ever wanted to see.
"This, despite the fact that Stanford had won only ONE game in the
past two years. Maybe we're too sophisticated down here, or maybe we
just don't care."
Which gives us something to think about. So let's stop thinking we have
to have a world-beater before we show our appreciation.
This year's team is far and away better than last year's outfit. But that
doesn't make it great. We are getting back up there after a long, hard
1 it j 111. Many of us seniors hoped that this would be the year. Maybe it
will. But if we don't make the Rose Bowl this year .... we had no busi
ness asking for it in the first place.
And one last request .... please, please, give the Axe Yell down
South. A whole generation is growing up around us that will never know
the thrill of hearing a Stanford rooting section giving out with one of
the most famous yells in the land.
This week's AP football poll rates the USC Trojans number 12 in the
country with 110 votes. UCLA is way down the line with two points.
Stanford isn't mentioned.
Yet, the bookies have called it USC by 8 over Stanford this Saturday.
Figure it out, I can't.
but then the polls and the pre-season guessers are so often wrong, so
very wrong.
This was Stanford's year, many of the San Francisco writers claimed.
The Curds were Ro:;e Bowl tagged from the start by many. Most of these
writers had never even seen the Cards play, or practice, since the 11)48
Big Came.
Mostly Sophs, Keincmhei'
So what happens? The student body expects great things, never stop
ping to think that 15 members of the squad were sophomores and that five
lit those would be playing first-string ball.
Then the Cards go on to pile up a four-win, two-loss, one-tie record.
The student body relaxes. By this time they had expected the Indians to
be all-victorious. Well, maybe they could have lost to Michigan, is the
thought.
Then the reaction sets in. Letters to the Editor, Daily columns, and talks
about the campus, ;:l! take up the subject, "What is the matter with the
rooing section?"
Two of the letters to the editor, those by Phil Duffy and Seotty Shane,
woiild do credit to a first-rate psychologist. Of course, the lack of real
action in the looting section is to be blamed on each and every individual
in that rooting section.
(ii)od, Kill Nol (jlreal
One of the reasons for this lack of pep, spirit, or whatever it is that is
lacking, is the aforementioned pre-season write-ups. Stanford had, and
has, a good ball club. But not a great team. Not yet. I think we are still
fi year away from fielding a team that will go all the way. This year's frosh
squad, while boasting no great individuals, is a sound team. The backs are
not of the 11*48 variety, but the line is one of the best yet.
Thus far this year, the varsity has been coasting. What I mean is, the
rough road is ahead. USC and Cal are tough. Observers at the Cal-USC
game tell me that USC was really the better team. They should have
won that game.
So this week we travel south to meet that USC team. For three years
