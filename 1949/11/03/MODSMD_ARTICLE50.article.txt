# Soccer Team Heads South
## 
### 
Encouraged by the surprise ad
dition of sensational lineman Tom
my Bell, who just turned out for
practice this week, the soccer team
moves south this Saturday to see
what's Bruin in Westwood.
However, Coach Etem Barlas is
doubtful about another lineman,
Alex Echavaria, who injured an
ankle during practice last week.
Uomi Irani, who injured his head
two weeks ago against Santa Clara,
announced that he is ready to play
despite the lack of practice. The
two-year all-conference man will
captain the team.
Tom Bell, slated to start at cen
ter forward, has the unusual asset
of high school experience. He is
always-.-Â® scoring threat. His bril
liant play of one week earned him
the trip.
Harry Havilio, who also was in
jured ib the Santa Clara game, has
been Healthy for several days and is
in goofT playing shape. Harry of the

, head and toe will be a key in Bruin
] land.
This trip marks the first time a
| Stanford soccer team has ever jour
neyed to Los Angeles. Neither have
j the Indian hooters ever played
| UCLA (or USC).
The traveling squad will include
j 21 players. Team spirit is very high
! for the trip, especially among resi
| dents of Los Angeles.
Said Chuck Malouf, goalie, "If we
lose this one I won't dare go home."
Give 'em the axe, the axe, the axe.
Give 'em the axe, the axe, the axe.
Give 'em the axe, give 'em the aex,
give 'em the axe, where? Right in
the neck, the neck, the neck . . .
Remember?
