# Troy Holds Slight Edge In Thrill-Packed Grid Series
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Saturday's tussle in the Los Angeles Coliseum will mark the 30th
anniversary of the Stanford-USC clambake and, aside from the Big
Game, the toughest and hardest-fought game of the year.
Although the Trojans hold 15 wins over the Cards against Stan
ford's 13, with a 13 to 13 tie in 1927, the Thundering Herd from

Southern Cal once made an Indian
team great and gave them national
recognition. That was back in 1933,
the year of the famous Vow.
In 1931 and '32, USC had the
greatest football team in the coun
try, having amassed an impressive
string of 27 victories in that time,
and it was every coach's dream, as
it is with Notre Dame today, to have
his boys knock over the "Thunder
ing Herd."
The Troy men minced the Cards
by a 19 to 0 count in 1931 and in '32
overpowered a Stanford eleven by
a score of 13 to 0.
A VOW IS BORN
At the beginning of the 1933 grid
season the sophomore members of
the Injun grid team decided to take
matters into their hands and. then
and there, made a vow never to be
defeated by the Trojans so long as
they wore the Stanford Red.
At the time, to the football world,
is sounded nothing short of ridicu
lous, by the Vow Boys soon proved
that they were serious by snapping
the Troy winning steak that year,
13 to 7. /
Not to be stopped, the Cards came
back in 1934 to take complete charge
of the game, winding up on the long
end of a 16 to 0 count.
The 1935 game was to be the big
one. It would make or break the
now-famous "sophomore vow," and
everyone waited nervously and
breathlessly for the outcome.
END OF A PERFECT VOW
For 59V2 minutes it was a score
less, see-saw battle, neither team
relinquishing the ball long enough
to do any good.
Then, with Stanford in possession
on the Troy 13-yard line, with 30
seconds to go, "Monk" Moscrip split
the uprights from but a few yards
in from the sideline, to give the In
dians a 3 to 0 win and end a perfect
vow.

Chuck Taylor proved that crime
1 does pay when, in 1942, he stole the
ball from the Trojan flash, Mickey
McCardle and jaunted 40-odd yards
to a touchdown and a Cardinal vic
| tory, 14 to 6.
ANOTHER VOW
The humiliated McCardle, not to
j be outdone, made a vow that he
would return to avenge the thiev
ery; and he did, in 1946, which
turned out to be one of the greatest
; games of the series.
Stanford took an early lead, only
to have USC come booming back to
j overpower the Indians in the last
I quarter to win, 28 to 20.

try, having amassed an impressive
string of 27 victories in that time,
and it was every coach's dream, as
it is with Notre Dame today, to have
his boys knock over the "Thunder
ing Herd."
The Troy men minced the Cards
by a 19 to 0 count in 1931 and in '32
overpowered a Stanford eleven by
a score of 13 to 0.
A VOW IS BORN
At the beginning of the 1933 grid
season the sophomore members of
the Injun grid team decided to take
matters into their hands and. then
and there, made a vow never to be
defeated by the Trojans so long as
they wore the Stanford Red.
At the time, to the football world,
is sounded nothing short of ridicu
lous, by the Vow Boys soon proved
that they were serious by snapping
the Troy winning steak that year,
13 to 7. /
Not to be stopped, the Cards came
back in 1934 to take complete charge
of the game, winding up on the long
end of a 16 to 0 count.
The 1935 game was to be the big
one. It would make or break the
now-famous "sophomore vow," and
everyone waited nervously and
breathlessly for the outcome.
END OF A PERFECT VOW
For 59V2 minutes it was a score
less, see-saw battle, neither team
relinquishing the ball long enough
to do any good.
Then, with Stanford in possession
on the Troy 13-yard line, with 30
seconds to go, "Monk" Moscrip split
the uprights from but a few yards
in from the sideline, to give the In
dians a 3 to 0 win and end a perfect
vow.

Chuck Taylor proved that crime
1 does pay when, in 1942, he stole the
ball from the Trojan flash, Mickey
McCardle and jaunted 40-odd yards
to a touchdown and a Cardinal vic
| tory, 14 to 6.
ANOTHER VOW
The humiliated McCardle, not to
j be outdone, made a vow that he
would return to avenge the thiev
ery; and he did, in 1946, which
turned out to be one of the greatest
; games of the series.
Stanford took an early lead, only
to have USC come booming back to
j overpower the Indians in the last
I quarter to win, 28 to 20.
Saturday's tussle in the Los Angeles Coliseum will mark the 30th
anniversary of the Stanford-USC clambake and, aside from the Big
Game, the toughest and hardest-fought game of the year.
Although the Trojans hold 15 wins over the Cards against Stan
ford's 13, with a 13 to 13 tie in 1927, the Thundering Herd from

Southern Cal once made an Indian
team great and gave them national
recognition. That was back in 1933,
the year of the famous Vow.
In 1931 and '32, USC had the
greatest football team in the coun
try, having amassed an impressive
string of 27 victories in that time,
and it was every coach's dream, as
it is with Notre Dame today, to have
