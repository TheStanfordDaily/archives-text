## PRACTICE Poulson Out; Abe, Russ In 
### 
Wes Poulson has been ruled out
of both the USC and Idaho games
but Dick Abraham and Russ Pom
eroy will be ready for near full-time
duty against the Trojans.
Such was the word that came out
of yesterday's football practice. For
the third night in a row the Cards
put in time under the lights. And
for the third night there was no of
fensive contact for the varsity.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has re
frained from offensive scrimmage
because of the long injury list, but
he has pitted his charges against the
junior varsity and freshman teams
in defensive work.
Practice observers came away
with the opinion that the Cards have
no intention of trying to dent the
big Trojan line by plunges.
Instead the Indians have turned
to the tricky stuff and passes. If
such turns out to be the case, the
gamÂ£ may well turn into an aerial
duel, for in Jim Powers the Tro
jans have the best passer in the
Conference. The Mystic One has hit
(i2 out of 10 attempts thus far this
season.
Schwartz has announced that he
will start a backfield made up of
Gary Kerkorian, Bill DeYoung,
Harry Hugasian, and Bob White.
With Rupe Andrews available for
immediate duty, this combination
will give the Cards about as much
speed as the team can muster.
In the line, the Card mentor will
go with Ken Rose and Bill McColl
at ends, A 1 Rau and Gordon White
at tackles, Don Fix and Dick Lucas
at guards, and Jim Castagnoli.
