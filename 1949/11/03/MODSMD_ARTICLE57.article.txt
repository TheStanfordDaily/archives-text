# Freshmen Prep for Cal Game
## 
### 
The final scrimmage of the week
and the season will wind up the
Papoose preparations for the Little
Big Game with the California
freshmen.
Working hard on defensive pat
terns to stop the famed "All-Saints"
attack, the first string spent yester
day afternoon on defense. Jim Vic,
Johnny Broderick, and Norm Ma
noogian looked especially effective
plugging up holes and stopping
plays.
Willie Barmore, Tom Dragna, and

Cal Cottriell were also sharp on the
defense in the line-backing depart
ment. Joe St. Geme, top quarter
back, pitched tent in the secondary
as the safety.
Skip Crist returned to full action
in the afternoon scrimmages. Ap
parently in good shape, Skip worked
at the offensive fullback spot. His

blocking was particularly effective,
taking a couple of men with him on
several trips. As far as ball-carry
ing went, Crist roared through the
center of the line effectively.
In the backfield with Skipper
were Tony Garrett, John Baker, and
signal - caller Bill Culton. Going
through Cal plays and then trying
plenty of passing, this new combi
nation worked well. The running <>l
Baker was especially sharp, as he
broke into the clear with good open
field ability.
After the scrimmaging, the entire
squad-did wind-sprints and then the
kickers stayed overtime getting off
some long punts. Tonight Coach
Taylor expects to stress defensive
patterns again.
