# Tito Warns Albania
## 
### 
BELGRADE â€”In a note just short
of an ultimatum, Yugoslavia tonight
sternly "cautioned" little Albania to
live up to its treaty obligations with
Marshal Tito's country.
The note demanded in the most
abrupt terms that Albania "answer
(his note in the shortest possible
time."
It listed a long series of complaints
against Albania.
