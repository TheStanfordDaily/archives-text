# Indians, Trojans Clash in Southland Crucial
## New Secret Pass Defense For Indians 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
Tomorrow is the make or
break day for the Stanford In
dians.
For it is on the morrow that the
Cards meet what may well turn
out to be their toughest oppon
ent of the season, in a game that
will decide which team will be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
lace. Game time is 2:15 in the
Memorial Coliseum in Los An
geles.
This is a once-defeated-in-six
starts USC team that the Indians
have to heat to stay in the run
ning for the Conference lead. The
professional odds makers are giving
13 points and saying that the Tro
pans will still be once-defeated
when the teams quit the field.
30TH RENEWAL
But this 30th renewal of the Stan
ford-USC traditional would line up
as a thriller even without the scent
of roses.
Both teams have fine defensive
lines and sparkling offensive units.
Stanford boasts a 353 yards-per
game offensive average to the next
place Trojan average of 319 yards.
It is in the defensive teams that
the Cards seem to have the edge
Stanford has given up but 237
yards per game to USC's 323.
POWERS TOPS
Mystic Jim Powers is the answer
And it is against the expected aerial
attack of Powers that the Cards have
prepared themselves this week.
Actually, Stanford's pass defense
record is pretty good. The Cards
have allowed 63 completions out of
150 attempts for a 112 yards-per
game average.
This Powers fellow, though, could
upset the whole rose cart. So Coach
Schwartz and staff have devised some
new defense formations to stop his
offerings.
What they are can not be told here
but it is sufficient to say that they
have not been used in the past three
years by Stanford.
GARY ON DEFENSE
Gary Kerkorian, for one, has been
shifted to defensive duties in addi
tion to his offensive chores. Ker
korian will play defensive halfback
to make use of his ball-hawking
ability.
Jim Castagnoli, Dick Abraham,
and Gordy Ricc will work as middle
line backers with Dave Field and
Ken Peck in the secondary. The
Schwartzmen have made no secret
of the fact—they are out to stop
Powers.
The Trojan running attack has not
been overlooked in the preparation
aganist the passing attack. The
Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.
I'OULSON OUT
All in all the Cards are at near
top strength for this game. There are
many nuisance injuries, but only
tackle Wcs Poulson is definitely out
of action.
The return to action of Pomc
roy will give the Cards much needed
defensive strength at the guard spot.
The giant USC line averages near
220 pounds, and therefore Stanford
needs every bit of help possible lo
strengthen its line.
Bill McColl will again see double
duty at offensive left end and de
fensive right tackle. McColi's size
enters into the situation here.
Schwartz figures that 217-pound
McColl will stand a better chance
of stopping the ground slants of the
likes of Martin than some of hb
lighter mates. Big Bill won the line
man of the week award last Satur
day for his defensive work.
SOUTHLAND TO SEE ROSE
Ken Rose will start at right end.
This game will give the Card senior
his chance to perform before the
southern football writers and prove
| the value his Farm fans ciaim for
him.
/\nd Rau and Gordon White will
open at the tackle spots, with Don
Fix and Hart Cook at guards. These
four men, and their defensive coun
! terparts, seem to have a good day's
i work in store, if they are to handle
the behemoths of USC.
Jim Castagnoli will go at center,
i The steady veteran is one of the few
linemen who will see near full-time
! tluty.
WHITE TO START
Bobby White is the surprising
! nomination for starting right half
back. The slim junior from Glendale
! ( ad the best day of his collegiate
j career in the Coliseum last year, and
I fie coaching staff hopes he will re
peat tomorrow. Boyd Benson is next
in line at the right half spot.
Hustling Harry Hugasian will
start at left half and Bill DeYoung
will get the nod for fullback duties.
DeYoung, handicapped for the past
two weeks with a sore knee, has been
| primed for the end-skirting job that
I v/ill be needed if the Card up-the
-1 center plays are going to work to
morrow.
Gary Kerkorian is the starting
quarterback. Last week, for the
first time this season, the slick ball

handler headed the Stanford offen
sive for the lull GO minutes. Tomor
row he will have the added burden
of playing on defense.
POMEROY BACK
So goes the offensive lineup. De
fensive men the likts of Pomeroy,
Jack Barnes, Jesse Cone, Hal Wal
ker, Biuce Van Alstyne, A 1 Laakso
and Jack Rye, will be the real

heroes of the action if Powers can
be rushed and the USC attack
stopped.
That, in part, is the story of the
Stanford-USC game of tomorrow.
What we have not mentioned here
is the bitter rivalry that exists be
tween the two schools. This game is
exceeded only by the Big One in
the eyes of the hall players.
Then too, many of the Card sopho
mores were rushed violently by the
Trojans when they wore prep stars in
the Los Angeles area. Theirs is a
"homecoming" effort.
For the first time they will be
seen by the home folks in the Car
dinal of the Stanford varsity. They
would like to win before them.
The traveling squad is as follows:
Ends: A! Laakso. Bill McColl, Dan
Mervin, Ken Rose, Jack Rye, Wil
bur Taylor, Bruce Van Alstyne.
Tackles: Chuck Hokanson, A 1 Rau,
Hal Walker, Gordon White. Guards:
Jesse Cone, Hart Cook, Don Fix,
Joe Jacob, Dick Lucas, Ru.ss Pom
eroy. Centers: Dick Abraham, John
Barnes, Jim Castagnoli, Gordon
Rice.
Backs: Rupe Andrews, Boyd Ben
son, Holy Boruck, Bill DeYoung,
Dave Field, Dick Horn, Harry Hu
gasian, Gary Kerkorian, Bud Klein,
Marv Melloway, Emery Mitchell,
Ken Peck, Tom Shaw, Eric South -
wood, Bob White, Bob Griffin.


BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE, Stan
ford's regular defensive left end,
will have his hands full tomorrow
when the Indians meet USC in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.

I v/ill be needed if the Card up-the
-1 center plays are going to work to
morrow.
Gary Kerkorian is the starting
quarterback. Last week, for the
first time this season, the slick ball

handler headed the Stanford offen
sive for the lull GO minutes. Tomor
row he will have the added burden
of playing on defense.
POMEROY BACK
So goes the offensive lineup. De
fensive men the likts of Pomeroy,
Jack Barnes, Jesse Cone, Hal Wal
ker, Biuce Van Alstyne, A 1 Laakso
and Jack Rye, will be the real

heroes of the action if Powers can
be rushed and the USC attack
stopped.
That, in part, is the story of the
Stanford-USC game of tomorrow.
What we have not mentioned here
is the bitter rivalry that exists be
tween the two schools. This game is
exceeded only by the Big One in
the eyes of the hall players.
Then too, many of the Card sopho
mores were rushed violently by the
Trojans when they wore prep stars in
the Los Angeles area. Theirs is a
"homecoming" effort.
For the first time they will be
seen by the home folks in the Car
dinal of the Stanford varsity. They
would like to win before them.
The traveling squad is as follows:
Ends: A! Laakso. Bill McColl, Dan
Mervin, Ken Rose, Jack Rye, Wil
bur Taylor, Bruce Van Alstyne.
Tackles: Chuck Hokanson, A 1 Rau,
Hal Walker, Gordon White. Guards:
Jesse Cone, Hart Cook, Don Fix,
Joe Jacob, Dick Lucas, Ru.ss Pom
eroy. Centers: Dick Abraham, John
Barnes, Jim Castagnoli, Gordon
Rice.
Backs: Rupe Andrews, Boyd Ben
son, Holy Boruck, Bill DeYoung,
Dave Field, Dick Horn, Harry Hu
gasian, Gary Kerkorian, Bud Klein,
Marv Melloway, Emery Mitchell,
Ken Peck, Tom Shaw, Eric South -
wood, Bob White, Bob Griffin.


BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE, Stan
ford's regular defensive left end,
will have his hands full tomorrow
when the Indians meet USC in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Tomorrow is the make or
break day for the Stanford In
dians.
For it is on the morrow that the
Cards meet what may well turn
out to be their toughest oppon
ent of the season, in a game that
will decide which team will be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
lace. Game time is 2:15 in the
Memorial Coliseum in Los An
geles.
This is a once-defeated-in-six
starts USC team that the Indians
have to heat to stay in the run
ning for the Conference lead. The
professional odds makers are giving
13 points and saying that the Tro
pans will still be once-defeated
when the teams quit the field.
30TH RENEWAL
But this 30th renewal of the Stan
ford-USC traditional would line up
as a thriller even without the scent
of roses.
Both teams have fine defensive
lines and sparkling offensive units.
Stanford boasts a 353 yards-per
game offensive average to the next
place Trojan average of 319 yards.
It is in the defensive teams that
the Cards seem to have the edge
Stanford has given up but 237
yards per game to USC's 323.
POWERS TOPS
Mystic Jim Powers is the answer
And it is against the expected aerial
attack of Powers that the Cards have
prepared themselves this week.
Actually, Stanford's pass defense
record is pretty good. The Cards
have allowed 63 completions out of
150 attempts for a 112 yards-per
game average.
This Powers fellow, though, could
upset the whole rose cart. So Coach
Schwartz and staff have devised some
new defense formations to stop his
offerings.
What they are can not be told here
but it is sufficient to say that they
have not been used in the past three
years by Stanford.
GARY ON DEFENSE
Gary Kerkorian, for one, has been
shifted to defensive duties in addi
tion to his offensive chores. Ker
korian will play defensive halfback
to make use of his ball-hawking
ability.
Jim Castagnoli, Dick Abraham,
and Gordy Ricc will work as middle
line backers with Dave Field and
Ken Peck in the secondary. The
Schwartzmen have made no secret
of the fact—they are out to stop
Powers.
The Trojan running attack has not
been overlooked in the preparation
aganist the passing attack. The
Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.
I'OULSON OUT
All in all the Cards are at near
top strength for this game. There are
many nuisance injuries, but only
tackle Wcs Poulson is definitely out
of action.
The return to action of Pomc
roy will give the Cards much needed
defensive strength at the guard spot.
The giant USC line averages near
220 pounds, and therefore Stanford
needs every bit of help possible lo
strengthen its line.
Bill McColl will again see double
duty at offensive left end and de
fensive right tackle. McColi's size
enters into the situation here.
Schwartz figures that 217-pound
McColl will stand a better chance
of stopping the ground slants of the
likes of Martin than some of hb
lighter mates. Big Bill won the line
man of the week award last Satur
day for his defensive work.
SOUTHLAND TO SEE ROSE
Ken Rose will start at right end.
This game will give the Card senior
his chance to perform before the
southern football writers and prove
| the value his Farm fans ciaim for
him.
/\nd Rau and Gordon White will
open at the tackle spots, with Don
Fix and Hart Cook at guards. These
four men, and their defensive coun
! terparts, seem to have a good day's
i work in store, if they are to handle
the behemoths of USC.
Jim Castagnoli will go at center,
i The steady veteran is one of the few
linemen who will see near full-time
! tluty.
WHITE TO START
Bobby White is the surprising
! nomination for starting right half
back. The slim junior from Glendale
! ( ad the best day of his collegiate
j career in the Coliseum last year, and
I fie coaching staff hopes he will re
peat tomorrow. Boyd Benson is next
in line at the right half spot.
Hustling Harry Hugasian will
start at left half and Bill DeYoung
will get the nod for fullback duties.
DeYoung, handicapped for the past
two weeks with a sore knee, has been
| primed for the end-skirting job that
I v/ill be needed if the Card up-the

Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.
I'OULSON OUT
All in all the Cards are at near
top strength for this game. There are
many nuisance injuries, but only
tackle Wcs Poulson is definitely out
of action.
The return to action of Pomc
roy will give the Cards much needed
defensive strength at the guard spot.
The giant USC line averages near
220 pounds, and therefore Stanford
needs every bit of help possible lo
strengthen its line.
Bill McColl will again see double
duty at offensive left end and de
fensive right tackle. McColi's size
enters into the situation here.
Schwartz figures that 217-pound
McColl will stand a better chance
of stopping the ground slants of the
likes of Martin than some of hb
lighter mates. Big Bill won the line
man of the week award last Satur
day for his defensive work.
SOUTHLAND TO SEE ROSE
Ken Rose will start at right end.
This game will give the Card senior
his chance to perform before the
southern football writers and prove
| the value his Farm fans ciaim for
him.
/\nd Rau and Gordon White will
open at the tackle spots, with Don
Fix and Hart Cook at guards. These
four men, and their defensive coun
! terparts, seem to have a good day's
i work in store, if they are to handle
the behemoths of USC.
Jim Castagnoli will go at center,
i The steady veteran is one of the few
linemen who will see near full-time
! tluty.
WHITE TO START
Bobby White is the surprising
! nomination for starting right half
back. The slim junior from Glendale
! ( ad the best day of his collegiate
j career in the Coliseum last year, and
I fie coaching staff hopes he will re
peat tomorrow. Boyd Benson is next
in line at the right half spot.
Hustling Harry Hugasian will
start at left half and Bill DeYoung
will get the nod for fullback duties.
DeYoung, handicapped for the past
two weeks with a sore knee, has been
| primed for the end-skirting job that
I v/ill be needed if the Card up-the
-1 center plays are going to work to
morrow.
Gary Kerkorian is the starting
quarterback. Last week, for the
first time this season, the slick ball

handler headed the Stanford offen
sive for the lull GO minutes. Tomor
row he will have the added burden
of playing on defense.
POMEROY BACK
So goes the offensive lineup. De
fensive men the likts of Pomeroy,
Jack Barnes, Jesse Cone, Hal Wal
ker, Biuce Van Alstyne, A 1 Laakso
and Jack Rye, will be the real

heroes of the action if Powers can
be rushed and the USC attack
stopped.
That, in part, is the story of the
Stanford-USC game of tomorrow.
What we have not mentioned here
is the bitter rivalry that exists be
tween the two schools. This game is
exceeded only by the Big One in
the eyes of the hall players.
Then too, many of the Card sopho
mores were rushed violently by the
Trojans when they wore prep stars in
the Los Angeles area. Theirs is a
"homecoming" effort.
For the first time they will be
seen by the home folks in the Car
dinal of the Stanford varsity. They
would like to win before them.
The traveling squad is as follows:
Ends: A! Laakso. Bill McColl, Dan
Mervin, Ken Rose, Jack Rye, Wil
bur Taylor, Bruce Van Alstyne.
Tackles: Chuck Hokanson, A 1 Rau,
Hal Walker, Gordon White. Guards:
Jesse Cone, Hart Cook, Don Fix,
Joe Jacob, Dick Lucas, Ru.ss Pom
eroy. Centers: Dick Abraham, John
Barnes, Jim Castagnoli, Gordon
Rice.
Backs: Rupe Andrews, Boyd Ben
son, Holy Boruck, Bill DeYoung,
Dave Field, Dick Horn, Harry Hu
gasian, Gary Kerkorian, Bud Klein,
Marv Melloway, Emery Mitchell,
Ken Peck, Tom Shaw, Eric South -
wood, Bob White, Bob Griffin.


BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE, Stan
ford's regular defensive left end,
will have his hands full tomorrow
when the Indians meet USC in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Tomorrow is the make or
break day for the Stanford In
dians.
For it is on the morrow that the
Cards meet what may well turn
out to be their toughest oppon
ent of the season, in a game that
will decide which team will be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
lace. Game time is 2:15 in the
Memorial Coliseum in Los An
geles.
This is a once-defeated-in-six
starts USC team that the Indians
have to heat to stay in the run
ning for the Conference lead. The
professional odds makers are giving
13 points and saying that the Tro
pans will still be once-defeated
when the teams quit the field.
30TH RENEWAL
But this 30th renewal of the Stan
ford-USC traditional would line up
as a thriller even without the scent
of roses.
Both teams have fine defensive
lines and sparkling offensive units.
Stanford boasts a 353 yards-per
game offensive average to the next
place Trojan average of 319 yards.
It is in the defensive teams that
the Cards seem to have the edge
Stanford has given up but 237
yards per game to USC's 323.
POWERS TOPS
Mystic Jim Powers is the answer
And it is against the expected aerial
attack of Powers that the Cards have
prepared themselves this week.
Actually, Stanford's pass defense
record is pretty good. The Cards
have allowed 63 completions out of
150 attempts for a 112 yards-per
game average.
This Powers fellow, though, could
upset the whole rose cart. So Coach
Schwartz and staff have devised some
new defense formations to stop his
offerings.
What they are can not be told here
but it is sufficient to say that they
have not been used in the past three
years by Stanford.
GARY ON DEFENSE
Gary Kerkorian, for one, has been
shifted to defensive duties in addi
tion to his offensive chores. Ker
korian will play defensive halfback
to make use of his ball-hawking
ability.
Jim Castagnoli, Dick Abraham,
and Gordy Ricc will work as middle
line backers with Dave Field and
Ken Peck in the secondary. The
Schwartzmen have made no secret
of the fact—they are out to stop
Powers.
The Trojan running attack has not
been overlooked in the preparation
aganist the passing attack. The
Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.

WHITE TO START
Bobby White is the surprising

Gary Kerkorian is the starting
quarterback. Last week, for the
first time this season, the slick ball

handler headed the Stanford offen
sive for the lull GO minutes. Tomor
row he will have the added burden
of playing on defense.
POMEROY BACK
So goes the offensive lineup. De
fensive men the likts of Pomeroy,
Jack Barnes, Jesse Cone, Hal Wal
ker, Biuce Van Alstyne, A 1 Laakso
and Jack Rye, will be the real

heroes of the action if Powers can
be rushed and the USC attack
stopped.
That, in part, is the story of the
Stanford-USC game of tomorrow.
What we have not mentioned here
is the bitter rivalry that exists be
tween the two schools. This game is
exceeded only by the Big One in
the eyes of the hall players.
Then too, many of the Card sopho
mores were rushed violently by the
Trojans when they wore prep stars in
the Los Angeles area. Theirs is a
"homecoming" effort.
For the first time they will be
seen by the home folks in the Car
dinal of the Stanford varsity. They
would like to win before them.
The traveling squad is as follows:
Ends: A! Laakso. Bill McColl, Dan
Mervin, Ken Rose, Jack Rye, Wil
bur Taylor, Bruce Van Alstyne.
Tackles: Chuck Hokanson, A 1 Rau,

BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE, Stan
ford's regular defensive left end,
will have his hands full tomorrow
when the Indians meet USC in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Tomorrow is the make or
break day for the Stanford In
dians.
For it is on the morrow that the
Cards meet what may well turn
out to be their toughest oppon
ent of the season, in a game that
will decide which team will be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
lace. Game time is 2:15 in the
Memorial Coliseum in Los An
geles.
This is a once-defeated-in-six
starts USC team that the Indians
have to heat to stay in the run
ning for the Conference lead. The
professional odds makers are giving
13 points and saying that the Tro
pans will still be once-defeated
when the teams quit the field.
30TH RENEWAL
But this 30th renewal of the Stan
ford-USC traditional would line up
as a thriller even without the scent
of roses.
Both teams have fine defensive
lines and sparkling offensive units.
Stanford boasts a 353 yards-per
game offensive average to the next
place Trojan average of 319 yards.
It is in the defensive teams that
the Cards seem to have the edge
Stanford has given up but 237
yards per game to USC's 323.
POWERS TOPS
Mystic Jim Powers is the answer
And it is against the expected aerial
attack of Powers that the Cards have
prepared themselves this week.
Actually, Stanford's pass defense
record is pretty good. The Cards
have allowed 63 completions out of
150 attempts for a 112 yards-per
game average.
This Powers fellow, though, could
upset the whole rose cart. So Coach
Schwartz and staff have devised some
new defense formations to stop his
offerings.
What they are can not be told here
but it is sufficient to say that they
have not been used in the past three
years by Stanford.
GARY ON DEFENSE
Gary Kerkorian, for one, has been
shifted to defensive duties in addi
tion to his offensive chores. Ker
korian will play defensive halfback
to make use of his ball-hawking
ability.
Jim Castagnoli, Dick Abraham,
and Gordy Ricc will work as middle
line backers with Dave Field and
Ken Peck in the secondary. The
Schwartzmen have made no secret
of the fact—they are out to stop
Powers.
The Trojan running attack has not
been overlooked in the preparation
aganist the passing attack. The
Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.
I'OULSON OUT
All in all the Cards are at near
top strength for this game. There are
many nuisance injuries, but only
tackle Wcs Poulson is definitely out
of action.
The return to action of Pomc
roy will give the Cards much needed
defensive strength at the guard spot.
The giant USC line averages near
220 pounds, and therefore Stanford
needs every bit of help possible lo
strengthen its line.
Bill McColl will again see double
duty at offensive left end and de
fensive right tackle. McColi's size
enters into the situation here.
Schwartz figures that 217-pound
McColl will stand a better chance
of stopping the ground slants of the
likes of Martin than some of hb
lighter mates. Big Bill won the line
man of the week award last Satur
day for his defensive work.
