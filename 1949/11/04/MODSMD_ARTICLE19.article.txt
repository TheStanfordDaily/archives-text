# Indians, Trojans Clash in Southland Crucial
## New Secret Pass Defense For Indians 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
Tomorrow is the make or
break day for the Stanford In
dians.
For it is on the morrow that the
Cards meet what may well turn
out to be their toughest oppon
ent of the season, in a game that
will decide which team will be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
lace. Game time is 2:15 in the
Memorial Coliseum in Los An
geles.
This is a once-defeated-in-six
starts USC team that the Indians
have to heat to stay in the run
ning for the Conference lead. The
professional odds makers are giving
13 points and saying that the Tro
pans will still be once-defeated
when the teams quit the field.
30TH RENEWAL
But this 30th renewal of the Stan
ford-USC traditional would line up
as a thriller even without the scent
of roses.
Both teams have fine defensive
lines and sparkling offensive units.
Stanford boasts a 353 yards-per
game offensive average to the next
place Trojan average of 319 yards.
It is in the defensive teams that
the Cards seem to have the edge
Stanford has given up but 237
yards per game to USC's 323.
POWERS TOPS
Mystic Jim Powers is the answer
And it is against the expected aerial
attack of Powers that the Cards have
prepared themselves this week.
Actually, Stanford's pass defense
record is pretty good. The Cards
have allowed 63 completions out of
150 attempts for a 112 yards-per
game average.
This Powers fellow, though, could
upset the whole rose cart. So Coach
Schwartz and staff have devised some
new defense formations to stop his
offerings.
What they are can not be told here
but it is sufficient to say that they
have not been used in the past three
years by Stanford.
GARY ON DEFENSE
Gary Kerkorian, for one, has been
shifted to defensive duties in addi
tion to his offensive chores. Ker
korian will play defensive halfback
to make use of his ball-hawking
ability.
Jim Castagnoli, Dick Abraham,
and Gordy Ricc will work as middle
line backers with Dave Field and
Ken Peck in the secondary. The
Schwartzmen have made no secret
of the fact—they are out to stop
Powers.
The Trojan running attack has not
been overlooked in the preparation
aganist the passing attack. The
Southerners have a bevy of fine run
ning backs and arc led by the Con
ference's leading scorer, fullback Bill
Martin.
I'OULSON OUT
All in all the Cards are at near
top strength for this game. There are
many nuisance injuries, but only
tackle Wcs Poulson is definitely out
of action.
The return to action of Pomc
roy will give the Cards much needed
defensive strength at the guard spot.
The giant USC line averages near
220 pounds, and therefore Stanford
needs every bit of help possible lo
strengthen its line.
Bill McColl will again see double
duty at offensive left end and de
fensive right tackle. McColi's size
