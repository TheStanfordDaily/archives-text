# BERKELEY BLUE LAWS
## Cal Winos Thirst as Booze Is Banned 
### 
Prohibition has dampened
University of California spirits!
There is no joy on Berkeley's
! "row" today, for liquor has
struck out. A declaration by
I
University authorities Wednes
day reaffirmed an almost-for

gotten rule of no alcoholic bev
erages on campus.
The restatement of rules was ac
companied by a letter from Presi
dent Robert G. Sproul, and was
mailed out to all living group presi
dents. The decree also outlawed the
maintenance of bars in houses, and
specified that chaperones must be
present at mixed parties.
Fraternity men, wearing black
arm bands and shedding dry tears,
staged demonstrations of protest
along Piedmont Avenue.
One house erected an outdoor bar
under a banner reading: "Liquida
tion—Everything must go!"
Other residences were decorated
with signs proclaiming: "Sinners Re
pent Sproul's Report"; "Raccoon
and Flasks Sold Here"; and "First
the Loyalty Oath, Now Temperance,
What's Next, Sex?"
An unhappy fraternity man poured
a bottle of bonded bourbon down
the kitchen sink and put up a sign:
j "City Sewer System Overloaded by
| 200 per cent."
Strains of "Blue Champagne,"
"Cool Water," "Cigareets, Whuskey,
and Wild, Wild Wimmen," blared
from windows up and down the row.
(n front of one house a bugler
| "Taps."
Rumors of a protest rally and a

march on Sproul's house were
squelched Wednesday evening, how
ever, when student body president
Dan Coelho and Mark Dingwell, head
of the Interfraternity Council visited
each house and asked inhabitants to
co-operate with the university de
cree.
"I'm very proud of the way ihc
student body responded to our re
quest," Coelho said. "There was no
police intervention and the entire
matter was handled by student lead
ers."
Coelho added that he believed the
students had a legal right to protest
because of the procedure used in
in sending out the decrees.
A meeting of living group presi
dents has been scheduled for
Wednesday, at which time the ad
ministration will explain the reaf
firmation.
Yesterday the row, minus its signs,
settled down to quiet resignation.
Ceneral opinion in the Chi Phi
House was that the decree was prob
ably for the best, as there were a
lot of minors living there. As one
member said, "There is nothing we
can do about it. It has been on the
books and pending for a long time."

Rumors of a protest rally and a

march on Sproul's house were
squelched Wednesday evening, how
ever, when student body president
Dan Coelho and Mark Dingwell, head
of the Interfraternity Council visited
each house and asked inhabitants to
co-operate with the university de
cree.
"I'm very proud of the way ihc
student body responded to our re
quest," Coelho said. "There was no
police intervention and the entire
matter was handled by student lead
ers."
Coelho added that he believed the
students had a legal right to protest
because of the procedure used in
in sending out the decrees.
A meeting of living group presi
dents has been scheduled for
Wednesday, at which time the ad
ministration will explain the reaf
firmation.
Yesterday the row, minus its signs,
settled down to quiet resignation.
Ceneral opinion in the Chi Phi
House was that the decree was prob
ably for the best, as there were a
lot of minors living there. As one
member said, "There is nothing we
can do about it. It has been on the
books and pending for a long time."
Prohibition has dampened
University of California spirits!
There is no joy on Berkeley's
! "row" today, for liquor has
struck out. A declaration by
I
University authorities Wednes
day reaffirmed an almost-for

gotten rule of no alcoholic bev
erages on campus.
The restatement of rules was ac
companied by a letter from Presi
dent Robert G. Sproul, and was
mailed out to all living group presi
dents. The decree also outlawed the
maintenance of bars in houses, and
specified that chaperones must be
present at mixed parties.
Fraternity men, wearing black
arm bands and shedding dry tears,
staged demonstrations of protest
along Piedmont Avenue.
One house erected an outdoor bar
under a banner reading: "Liquida
tion—Everything must go!"
Other residences were decorated
with signs proclaiming: "Sinners Re
pent Sproul's Report"; "Raccoon
and Flasks Sold Here"; and "First
the Loyalty Oath, Now Temperance,
What's Next, Sex?"
An unhappy fraternity man poured
a bottle of bonded bourbon down
the kitchen sink and put up a sign:
j "City Sewer System Overloaded by
| 200 per cent."
