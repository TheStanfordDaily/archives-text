# More Than 100 Books Disappear Yearly; Library Recovers Most of Literature
## 
### LOIS DEIMEL 
Nearly 105 books .disappear from
the general circulation stacks of the
library during the autumn, winter,
and spring quarters. By efficient re
covery methods, the library gets all
but about 16 back.
Libe employees check all living
groups to pick up lost books. Often

books will show up after the be
ginning of the fall quarter as stu
dents must return books before reg
istering.
Books in the main reading room
and bound periodicals in the peri
odical room are missing more often
than books from the stacks. Some
80 books a year are taken from the
main reading room.
The lost bound periodicals and
books turn up in strange places.
Often Paly merchants return library j

books left in their stores, and bis- [
tros across San Francisquito Creek 1
find their share of the wandering'
literature.
Several ways of illegal appropria
tion of books have been used re
cently. The common method is to
refuse to return borrowed books.
Some people take books out of
stacks with their stack permits and
don't sign them out. Others take
books which are already out, and
some people even use aliases in
signing for books.
Stanford students should remem- j
ber that use of the library bene
fits all students, and every time j
students walk off with material thai j
belongs to the library, the usefulness
of the library for research is im
paired.
Joseph Beloli, chief of the library
referense division, has a word of
comfort for the undergraduates, who
are often thought to be the chief
library offenders. He said that (he
loss of books goes up 40 per cent
during the summer quarter, when
most students at Stanford are teach
ers back for additional college work.
