# Farm Made Unique By Variety of 112 Trees

### WALT MENNINGER 
Incorporating many thousands
of trees and shrubs which rep
resent more than 150 different
species, the Stanford campus is
unique as one of trees and turf
rather than lawns.
From the original forest of firs,
pines, redwoods, and oaks, the num
ber and species of timber have
increased steadily so that today
trees from all parts of the world
flourish on the University grounds.
Senator Stanford first conceived
the idea of a campus of trees. In
1882, he established the Stanford
Arboretum, a place where trees and
shrubs could be cultivated for sci
entific and educational purposes. In
this manner, the University founder
hoped to bring together every tree
and shrub that would grow in Cali
fornia.
OAK ANI) COTTONWOOD
Of the native trees on the campus,
the noble oaks are predominant.
Among other plentiful native trees
are buckeye, willow, cottonwood,
sycamore, and coast redwood.
The magnificent eucalyptus trees

i furnish the background for the ar
boretum, the larger part of which is
j located off Palm Drive. Since they
thrive in this climate, the eucalypti
claim the largest number of sur
vivors of any imported tree, and
they provide the characteristic note
I and tone of the Arboretum.
MONTEREY FIR
Another interesting "foreign"
' North American tree is the Santa
Lucia fir whose native habitat is in
the mountains of Monterey County.
Of the two specimens on the Uni
versity grounds, the most distinctive
is on the southwest grounds of the
Pavilion, towering high above the
neighboring area.
Trees from other continents are
scattered over the campus. The
araucaria tree from South America,
whcse ancestors lived 20 million
years ago, may be seen along the
wa'k between the History Corner
and Hoover Library. Along 'this
same walk are the cedar of India
and the Atlas cedar from Morocco.
Colorful members of the "Stanford
forest" are the Japanese magnolias
and the flowering peaches and
plums in the garden around Frost
Amphitheater. In the springtime,
before any leaves are on the trees,
the magnolias bloom in a spectacu
lar display, and soon afterward the
peaches ana plums steal the scene.
OVERNIGHT GROWTH
Of interest are the stories behind
j some of the campus trees. The olive
j trees in Frost Amphitheater have
an extraordinary history, since they
were planted overnight. It was dis
covered the day before the first
commencement exercises in the
amphitheater that the bench on
which the Trustees were to sit was
facing the sun and not shaded.
Immediate orders were given to
the gardener to put in some shade
trees and, luckily enough, the gar
dener knew of some grown olive
trees which could be planted there.
By working all night, the grounds
j crew managed to get the planting
done a half-hour before the gradua
-1 tion began.
Representing the Class of '95, the
I present "Pioneer Oak" is another
I historical tree. It is the second of
its kind, as the original, planted by
the Class of '95 upon their gradua
tion, died in 1945. The Class of '45
designated the new oak to take its
place.
The University used to be able to
boast of trees planted by historically
famous personages. John Hay, Ben
jamin Harrison, and Theodore
j Roosevelt planted trees on the cam
i pus, but ironically enough, all these
' trees have since died or been taken
' out. â€¢
