# CIO Left Wing Loses
## 
### 
CLEVELAND -Left-wing opposi
tion, led by Harry Bridges, was
beaten down today in its effort to
change the ClO's stand on interna
tional political and labor affairs.
The CIO convention reaffirmed its
support of America's foreirn po'icy,
embracing 11 jo Marshall Plan, the
United Nations, and the Atlantic
Pact.
It also backed the CIO executive
board for pulling the organization
out of the World Federation of
Trade Unions which the board said
is Communist-jdominated.
