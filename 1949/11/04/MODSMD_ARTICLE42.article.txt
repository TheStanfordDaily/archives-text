# Think It Over
## 
### 
The largest football migration in Stanford his
tory—nearly 4,000 rooters —hits the roads for
L.A. this weekend.
It'll be a great party. Almost everybody'll be
there. Just like moving the Quad south and set
ting it up again inside the Coliseum. Before
and after the game there'll be rallies, parties,
plenty of food and drink.
It would be a shame if an accidental death
were to spoil this weekend.
Yet, that's just what may happen if we don't
take it easy on the highways.

It's a long, tough trip. We're in a hurry to
get down, even more of a hurry to get back.
We've been up most of the night before.
What better circumstances could Death ask?
To improve the odds a bit, take a raincheclc
on that "one last drink." Pull off the highway
and take a nap if you feel drowsy. Slow down.
What's your hurry anyway? The campus will
still be there when you get back.
Remember: other people are trusting you
with their lives. Think it over, then slow down.
See 'ya Monday.
