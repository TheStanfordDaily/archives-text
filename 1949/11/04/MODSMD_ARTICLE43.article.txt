### JOHN HALL 
Actually, I've got no kicks. I'm finished with mid
terms, have a USC rooter's ticket in my hip pocket,
am still plus in the Bawlout, and was on hand when
they reinstated the bell at Dinah's the other nieht.

So, happy and carefree, I
walked into The Daily Shack,
singing "Why don't you haul off
and love me," and think what
a nice afternoon it was.
That's the last thing I remem
ber. The rest was blurred. Two
pairs of hands reached out,
grabbed me around the neck, and
began shaking me like a vanilla
malt with two scoops of choco
late ice-cream.
"Quiet, you bum," several fe-

male voices echoed. "We want a word with you."
"Okay, gills,"- I said, being generous.
"Listen, you crumb, where did you get the bright
idea that all Stanford women had been dated for
(he Big Game since last Easter?" the first voice
asked.
'112 made it up all by myself," I laughed.
"I don't think you see things clearly," said the
second voice as she tossed dirt in my eyes.

"Ych, you've ruined my whole year," said the third
voice.
"We'll never get dates now," said the fourth.
"I hate you," said the fifth.
"Me too," said the sixth.
About this time I could sec that it was going to Ix;
a one-sided conversation, so I pulled myself together
and bogarted, "Listen, sweetheart, there's only three
types of Stanford women—liars, damn liars, and those
who say they haven't got dates for the Big Game."
"Quit trying to be funny," they shouted, as they
kicked me in the stomach. "Look at us —what do you
think we arc?"
I looked closely. I was confused, but after birding
into the waste-paper basket, I confessed, "I admit it,
you're Stanford women all right."
"That's better," they said simply. "Now what arc
you going to do about it?"
"Me," I asked naively. "There's nothing I can do
right now. I have to leave for the USC game, and I
won't be back until Monday morning."
"Well, at least you could tell the men that there're
still a lot of us nice women left and all they have
to do is whistle and that they still have 16 days to
do it in, and we'll be glad to pay half and everything."
"Yeah, I guess I could do that," I said.

"We'll never get dates now," said the fourth.
"I hate you," said the fifth.
"Me too," said the sixth.
About this time I could sec that it was going to Ix;
a one-sided conversation, so I pulled myself together
and bogarted, "Listen, sweetheart, there's only three
types of Stanford women—liars, damn liars, and those
who say they haven't got dates for the Big Game."
"Quit trying to be funny," they shouted, as they
kicked me in the stomach. "Look at us —what do you
think we arc?"
I looked closely. I was confused, but after birding
into the waste-paper basket, I confessed, "I admit it,
you're Stanford women all right."
"That's better," they said simply. "Now what arc
you going to do about it?"
"Me," I asked naively. "There's nothing I can do
right now. I have to leave for the USC game, and I
won't be back until Monday morning."
"Well, at least you could tell the men that there're
still a lot of us nice women left and all they have
to do is whistle and that they still have 16 days to
do it in, and we'll be glad to pay half and everything."
"Yeah, I guess I could do that," I said.

Actually, I've got no kicks. I'm finished with mid
terms, have a USC rooter's ticket in my hip pocket,
am still plus in the Bawlout, and was on hand when
they reinstated the bell at Dinah's the other nieht.

So, happy and carefree, I
walked into The Daily Shack,
singing "Why don't you haul off
and love me," and think what
a nice afternoon it was.
That's the last thing I remem
ber. The rest was blurred. Two
pairs of hands reached out,
grabbed me around the neck, and
began shaking me like a vanilla
malt with two scoops of choco
late ice-cream.
"Quiet, you bum," several fe-

male voices echoed. "We want a word with you."
"Okay, gills,"- I said, being generous.
"Listen, you crumb, where did you get the bright
idea that all Stanford women had been dated for
(he Big Game since last Easter?" the first voice
asked.
'112 made it up all by myself," I laughed.
"I don't think you see things clearly," said the
second voice as she tossed dirt in my eyes.

"Ych, you've ruined my whole year," said the third
voice.
"We'll never get dates now," said the fourth.
"I hate you," said the fifth.
"Me too," said the sixth.
