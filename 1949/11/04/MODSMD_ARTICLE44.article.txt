# CAMPUS OPINION
## National Campus Clubs 
### 
To the Editor:
Fie: National Campus Club article in October 26
issue of the Stanford Daily.
It is surprising to me that this story, based in part
on conjecture and employing such opinionated and
inaccurate phrases as "large portion" and "large sal
aries," did not have a byline indicating that the con
tent was the writer's views and feelings, and not en
tirely fact.
The most flagrant and libelous violations of truth
were the statements:
"Ncs:; also receives a large portion of every $3 mem
bership that is sold" and,"the profits are divided in
the form of large salaries to Ness and his associates."
For the past 10 months, neither myself nor any of
the other national officers have received any salary
whatsoever from the NCC (or its predecesors). I've
had to go over $1,500 in debt personally just to meet
living costs. NCC has advanced me some expense
mqney, but even this has averaged less than $2 daily
during the entire 10-month period. And THIS your
writer called a "large salary."
The "large portion" of the $3 membership fee that
"I" get is indicated in the normal breakdown below:
65 per cent to campus managers (out of which ad
vertising costs, salesmen's commissions, etc., are paid).
10 per cent to field representatives (persons inter
viewing and selecting the campus managers).
25 per cent to the National Office (out of which the
expense of promoting NCC on a nationwide scale is
paid first. These expenses are naturally high at first,
but in about a year the groundwork will be laid. Then
there will be enough left over to set up substantial
scholarship funds at the universities where NCC is in
operation. The amount of the funds will depend di
rect ly upon the numebr of students at each univer
sity who are NCC members).
What's Ness getting out of it, then?
This is a logical question, and I'll give you a straight
answer. When I first started NCC in January (called
at first CO-OP AUTO CLUB, then CAMPUS AUTO
CLUB) it was with the purpose of earning enough
money to complete my senior year at Stanford. I
have to eat, and I still wish to complete that final
year, so I will expect to receive a salary of $3,600 be
ginning the first of next year. If this is unreasonable
and "large," then I stand corrected. (Mind you, I have
yet to receive any salary).
The scholarships will not be awarded merely be
cause 1 wouldn't know what to do with the money
that would be collected from membership fees on
campuses throughout 39 states. Like most Americans,
I could find plenty of uses for it. The reason is prin
cipally because our reception at various universities
throughout the country was oftentimes negative until
the administration could see that our organization had
a worthwhile purpose and was not set up merely to
"make money off the students."
So, with this in mind, we decided to incorporate a
non-profit organization. We will draw only a rea
sonable salary (as will be voted to us by a board of

directors), and the rest of the money will be turned
over to scholarship funds.
If it is bad to give college students a chance to
save money on their everyday essentials (laundry,
dry cleaning, clothing, car upkeep, etc.); if it is bad
to give students a chance to work their way through
school; if it is bad to award scholarships to deserving
students; THEN, we arc bad.
