# Forgotten Men

Who's responsible? It happened last year when the
Stanford varsity football team traveled to the Army
game, and our first and second team players who had
been injured were left home.
This year it's the USC game and they're doing it
again. Evidently whoever is responsible doesn't feel
any obligation to the members of the football team.
If a boy gets injured and is forced to miss a few games
of competition, he may as well plan on buying tickets
to see those games bccausc you can bet your bottom
dollar that Alfred Masters isn't going to give the
player complimentary tickets to the game, let alone
take him with the team.
You'd think, however, if the ganic was being played
in an injured player's home town that lie would be
given complimentary tickets for his family, and at
least allowed to suit-up, even though it was to sit on
the bench, so he could travel with his teammates in
stead of begging his fraternity brothers for a last
minute ride when the news that he was the "for
gotten man" reached him. But if that's what you
think, that's about all that has been done about it.
The two planes that have been chartered to take
fjhe team to L.A. have room to spare for dozens of
iinjured men and the married players' wives as well.
In fact, that was the promise before the season. But
the varsity lost a few. Now the extra seats arc being
sold.
So remember, if you sec a forlorn looking individual
limping through Blackwcll's Corners .... give him
a ride. He's probably an ex-member of the varsity
football team.
