To the Editor:
This letter is not written to argue with "Name
Withheld" over the literary merits of "Baghdad-By-
The-Bay." Rather, it is to remind him that the Book
store belongs to us, the students. Such promotions as
Caen's bring in business, which creates a larger turn
over, that in turn, means more profit.
The profit goes to us in the form of rebates. Our
rebates will also be swollen by the fact that a large
number of those persons purchasing at such promo
tions will not cash in their rebates. In short, let's not
let considerations of literary purity stand in the way
of good business sense. Cheers to the Bookstore di
rectors for their promotion of "Baghdad-By-Thc-
Bay."
