# German Student Lost War Years; Now Betters International Relations
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
"The four years that I served
in the German army were the
lost years of my life, for in that
period I lost the idealism of
youth and grew old."
Fritz Margulies, exchange student
from Munich, Germany, was drafted
into the army shortly before the
invasion of France.
In 1939, shortly before his induc
tion, Fritz and a French student,
spent the summer bicycling through
France. The boys had become
friends during an exchange in which
Fritz had been studying in France,
while the other attended the Uni
versity of Munich. They could not
believe the approaching war would
interrupt their friendship. But two
weeks later the French boy returned
home, where he later died of star
vation, while Fritz became a cor
poral in the Signal Corps.
When Fritz returned home from
the war he found a new Munich.
The city was filled with ruins and
filled with people who did not feel
responsible for what had happened,
but instead realized with bitterness
what Hitler had done to them.
LACK OF FOOD
Germany was in the throes of un
employment and a scarcity of food.
Jobs were hard to find, but Fritz

managed to get a job installing
phones through his experience with
in the signal corps. He then sought
employment with the American
Military Government, because he
was interested in what the occupa
tion was going to do and he wanted
to further his knowledge of French
and English.
LEFT GOVERNMENT JOB
He left his job with the govern
ment to study political science at
the University of Munich. .At the
university he discovered the Ger
man students were completely iso
lated in respect to the conditions of
the outside world. He and two
other friends established an Inter
national Students Club to deal with
the inadequacies in student housing
and to make contacts with foreign
students.
Switzerland, because of its neu
trality during the war and its exten
sive international activity, was the
first to help in exchanging letters,
students, and in establishing inter
national camps. Soon Britain,
France, Belgium, the United States,
and other countries were partici
pating.
CONTACTS HELP
Fritz's contacts with the military
government helped in obtaining per
mits for the foreign students. The
scope of the international club so
increased that it was turned over
to the official student body, which
built up similar projects.
Fritz feels that the American gov

ernment was objective in its atti
tude toward the dismantling of Ger
man industries, although at times it
was careless in tearing down indus
tries that could have been useful in
the peace. He described the cur
rency reform carried out by the oc
cupation as an overnight success, in
which the black market was thrown
out and the value of goods restored.
EXCHANGE SCHOLARSHIP
Since the department of political
science was very inadequate at Mu
nich, Fritz applied for an exchange
scholarship in the United States.
(Outdated textbooks and lack of
materials arc vital problems in Ger
man schools and universities.) He
received a scholarship at Stanford
and an opportunity to study at Yale
in the summer.
After completing a year's work at
Stanford in the Political Science De
partment, Fritz will return to Ger

many to work in the educational
field of politics. He has a plan for
helping the German students out of
the isolated state, by sending an ex
change of recordings of discussions
on important problems of the day.
In this way the German students
will be able to hear what the Ameri
can students are thinking and vice
versa.
Fritz has found a feeling of friend
ship at Stanford which he hopes he
can relay to his fellow men in Mu
nich and in so doing pave the way
lor a lasting peace.
