# On Your Dial-880
## 
### 
'Don't sit at home tonight and wish
you were in Los Angeles. Instead,
flip that dial to 880 and ask the
KZSU engineers to play soothing
music. They'll play your favorite
tunes, and they're as near as your
telephone.

While you're hitting the hooks
Sunday at 9 p.m., listen to "Music
for Studying." Announcer Ted Cloo
nan will make himself unobtrusive
while playing Eddie Duchin's
"S'wonderful," Harry James' "Stella
by Starlight," and other study - in
ducing melodies.
At 9:45 Miss Elizabeth Crandall,
director of Lagunita Court, will be
interviewed on "Meet Your Cam
pus." This program is the first of a
new series on which campus per
sonalities will be interviewed every
week.
