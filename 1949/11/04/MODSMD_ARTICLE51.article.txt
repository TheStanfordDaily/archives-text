# 'Beggar' -- Fantastic Satire
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
Fine satire in these touchy
days deserves a good word.
Fine theatrical satire, a com
modity of which there is never
quite enough, deserves a special
commendation.
And fine theatrical satire was the
meat of the Stanford Players' pro
duction of ."Beggar on Horseback,"
which opened a three-night run in
the Memorial Auditorium last night.
"Beggar on Horseback," written
by the Broadway wags, George
Kaufman and Marc Connelly, is a
thoroughly devastating crack at the
state of American middle-class cul
ture, with side pokes at theatrical
courtrooms, the vacuity of big busi
ness, as well as the boorishness of
civilized humanity in general.
SATIRE IS COMPLETE
Being a broad and not too gentle
burlesque, Kaufman and Connelly's
farce reaches for its success not in
subtlety (although to some people
satire is always a little too subtle),
but in the width and completeness
of its satire. Everything in sight is
lampooned here, from the sancti- |
mony of justice to the pompousness
of professional politics.
It was this quality of broad and
thorough burlesque that the Stan- J
ford Players caught lust night and |
played to the hilt.
Heading the cast of players were
Hope Sterling and William Kenney,
who stood for the side of culture
and gentle manners. Though Sad
dled with most of the straight lines,
Miss Sterling had no trouble look
ing very pretty and convincing as
the ingenue, and Kenney showed a
thorough stage presence.
CHARACTERS CAST WELL
The prime target of the satire is,
of course, the Cady family, all of
whom, in the Stanford production,
were well cast. Ann Guilbert, who
is a fine comedienne, did an excep- j
tionally fine job as the raucous
voiced and flighty Gladys Cady. Her ■
mugging, the "cunning" lilt of her
voice, and her "melting brown"
glances were superb.
Lewis Fosse, as the trumpet- !
voiced "widgit" manufacturer, and
Anne Lawder, as his hymn-singing
"chair-bound" wife were also ex
cellent. And George Denny, as Ho
mer, the obnoxious son, succeeded ;

in being thoroughly obnoxious.
Jerry Lanfield did a fine repre
sentation of the hero's close friend,
especially in his mimicry of a chi
chi French head waiter and of jury
foremen.
Nicholas Gilroy as Jerry, and Miss
Hey and Miss You were fine, as
were, generally, the various platoons
of waiters, butlers, dancing masters,
and usher-bridegrooms.
The pantomime, "A Kiss in Xana
du," with music written by Deems
Taylor, was a sly dig at royal mar
riage, and can speak very well for
itself.
COSTUMES DID SATIRE
The costumes by Virginia Opsvig
and the stylized scenery and sets
by Wendell deserve special men
tion. Both were in strict and hi
larious keeping with the theme of
the play. Those who intend to see
the play are asked only to look
around and see how much in keep
ing.
A surprise which comes just lie
fore the intermission was funny as
hell. It wouldn't do to reveal it.

Weaknesses of the production
were lew. There was an occasional
tendency on the part of all the cast
to talk too fast. Some of the
and actions, which were evidently
intended to bring laughs, were not
brought clearly across to the audi
ence. And a few scenes did not re
ceive the full treatment they de
served.
These shortcomings were, how
ever, set aside by such superb sit
uations as the nightclub satire, the
directors' meeting, and especially
the courtroom scene.
If you like comedy, even remote
ly, the play is entertaining. If you
do not, then stay home.

dled with most of the straight lines,
Miss Sterling had no trouble look
ing very pretty and convincing as
the ingenue, and Kenney showed a
thorough stage presence.
CHARACTERS CAST WELL
The prime target of the satire is,
of course, the Cady family, all of
whom, in the Stanford production,
were well cast. Ann Guilbert, who
is a fine comedienne, did an excep- j
tionally fine job as the raucous
voiced and flighty Gladys Cady. Her ■
mugging, the "cunning" lilt of her
voice, and her "melting brown"
glances were superb.
Lewis Fosse, as the trumpet- !
voiced "widgit" manufacturer, and
Anne Lawder, as his hymn-singing
"chair-bound" wife were also ex
cellent. And George Denny, as Ho
mer, the obnoxious son, succeeded ;

in being thoroughly obnoxious.
Jerry Lanfield did a fine repre
sentation of the hero's close friend,
especially in his mimicry of a chi
chi French head waiter and of jury
foremen.
Nicholas Gilroy as Jerry, and Miss
Hey and Miss You were fine, as
were, generally, the various platoons
of waiters, butlers, dancing masters,
and usher-bridegrooms.
The pantomime, "A Kiss in Xana
du," with music written by Deems
Taylor, was a sly dig at royal mar
riage, and can speak very well for
itself.
COSTUMES DID SATIRE
The costumes by Virginia Opsvig
and the stylized scenery and sets
by Wendell deserve special men
tion. Both were in strict and hi
larious keeping with the theme of
the play. Those who intend to see
the play are asked only to look
around and see how much in keep
ing.
A surprise which comes just lie
fore the intermission was funny as
hell. It wouldn't do to reveal it.

Weaknesses of the production
were lew. There was an occasional
tendency on the part of all the cast
to talk too fast. Some of the
and actions, which were evidently
intended to bring laughs, were not
brought clearly across to the audi
ence. And a few scenes did not re
ceive the full treatment they de
served.
These shortcomings were, how
ever, set aside by such superb sit
uations as the nightclub satire, the
directors' meeting, and especially
the courtroom scene.
If you like comedy, even remote
ly, the play is entertaining. If you
do not, then stay home.
Fine satire in these touchy
days deserves a good word.
Fine theatrical satire, a com
modity of which there is never
quite enough, deserves a special
commendation.
And fine theatrical satire was the
meat of the Stanford Players' pro
duction of ."Beggar on Horseback,"
which opened a three-night run in
the Memorial Auditorium last night.
"Beggar on Horseback," written
by the Broadway wags, George
Kaufman and Marc Connelly, is a
thoroughly devastating crack at the
state of American middle-class cul
ture, with side pokes at theatrical
courtrooms, the vacuity of big busi
ness, as well as the boorishness of
civilized humanity in general.
SATIRE IS COMPLETE
Being a broad and not too gentle
burlesque, Kaufman and Connelly's
farce reaches for its success not in
subtlety (although to some people
satire is always a little too subtle),
but in the width and completeness
of its satire. Everything in sight is
lampooned here, from the sancti- |
mony of justice to the pompousness
of professional politics.
It was this quality of broad and
thorough burlesque that the Stan- J
ford Players caught lust night and |
played to the hilt.
Heading the cast of players were
Hope Sterling and William Kenney,
who stood for the side of culture
and gentle manners. Though Sad
dled with most of the straight lines,
Miss Sterling had no trouble look
ing very pretty and convincing as
the ingenue, and Kenney showed a
thorough stage presence.
