WASHINGTON John L. 1-cwis
appealed to Gov. Henry Schricker of j
Indiana to renew his effort to ar- j
range negotiations in the." current
coal strike. Schricker replied that
is "probably would be useless" to try j
again. Indiana coal men declined
yesterday the Governor's bid to
meet with Lewis' Mine Workers'
Union.
Other producers viewed the Lewis I
move as a dividc-und-conquer stra
egy advanced in hopes of getting an i
agreement that could be pressed on
operator groups in other sections of (
the country.
