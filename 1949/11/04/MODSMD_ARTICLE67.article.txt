# Card, Bear Frosh Vie Tomorrow
## 'Little Big Game' at Berkeley Features Coast's Top Frosh Teams 
### DICK KLEIN 
The Stanford freshmen, boasting a clean slate and a well-bal
anced football squad, will make a bid for their third undefeated
season in a row, when the Papooses meet the Cal Cubs tomorrow
morning. Kickoff in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium is set for 11.
With both teams loaded with former prep stars and varsity grid

hopefuls, the gime rates a toss-up
The undefeated Cordbabes may lie
tabbed a slight favorite, but when
these two rivals tangle in the tradi
tional "L ittle Big Game," odds mean
very little.
Coach Chuik Taylor's Papooses
have already scored wins over the
Stanford Jayvees, Santa Clara frosh,
UCLA frosh, USC frosh, and the San
Jose State frosh last weekend.
CUBS IMPRESSIVE
The Cub record is nearly as im
pressive, with wins over San Mateo
JC, USC frosh, and St. Mary's frosh
before losing last week to the UCLA
yearlings. The score of that game
was 44 to 20. The Cards tripped the
Brubabes, 7 to 0.
The in'ury factor can be knocked
out of the figuring, as both rival
teams enter the annual affair in top
condition. Both have important men
returning to action for the game.
Tom Greenleaf, quarterback and
defensive ace, will be ready for duty
in the Cub backfield. He has been
out with an ankle injury.
CRIST AT FULL
Top gainer and biggest scoring
threat, Skip Crist, former Palo Alto
School star, will open at full
back for the Papooses after missing
both the SC and State encounters.
A twisted knee has kept the Skip
per out, but he is okay and ready.
Farm stars A 1 Peterson, a fine of
fensive halfback, and Tommy Van
Sant, clever defensive back, have also
received the medic's okay for Satur
day's game.
In the Cal lineup, fullback Johnny
Olszewski has ':een the main offen
sive threat, but the Westwooders
stopped him cold. John only netted
14 yards last week. Other backfield

tarters are Bill Mais, John Peterson,
and Dean O'Hare, who all went to
St. Anthony's High School in Long
Beach with Olszewski.
Mais is an excellent passer and
amnio signal-caller, while O'Hare
and Peterson are fast, capable of
breaking loose any time.
GLICK RUGGED
Strong point in the forward wall
is Steve Click, former all-Stste of
California guard from Beverly Hills.
Steve tips the scales at an even 200
pounds and is plenty rugged.
Already proving itself as a solid
defense, the Papoose line is one of
ihe strongest in Farm frosh history.
Sparked by two 220-pound tackles,
John Broderick and Jim Vick, and
>,uard Norm Manoogian, the big line
has had the biggest share in keeping
the season's record clear of defeats.
ST. GEME, ELDKEDGE AT QB
The brunt of the improving Pa
poose offensive falls on Joe St. Geme
and Dave Eldredge, while Billy Cul
ton will also see some action at quar
terback. St. Geme gets the call to
morow after his good performance
last weekend. Sub ends Dick Saw
yer and Bob Thompson expect to
be on the receiving end of a lot of
those aerials.
Giving the Bear-hungry squad a
rest this afternoon, Coach Taylor
predicted, "We're ready. The boys
know what to expect, and we can
win it."
The victory over the Cal Cubs
would give Coach Taylor his 17th
win in a row, and his third unde
feated season since the war when
freshman sports were resumed here
at Stanford.


NORM MANOOGIAN, stellar frosh guard, will lead a rugged
Yearling line against the Bear Cubs in Berkeley's Memorial Sta
dium tomorrow morning at 11.
