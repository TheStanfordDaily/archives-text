# Quarterback Jim Powers Heads Host of Southern Cal Stalwarts
## 
### AL BERRY 
Tomorrow, just two and a half
hours after the sun has passed the
meridian, the white - shirted Red
Machine will venture out on the
°reen-painted turf of the Los Ange
les Coliseum to do battle with a
team that many pre-season pickers
had tabbed as possible national
I champions.
And the Trojans of USC might
well be living up to their pre-sea
son hopes had they not flubbed
against an unusually excited Ohio
State team in Los Angeles, and then
got themselves tangled up in the
four-leaf clovered turf of Straw
! berry Canyon.
The Trojans that Stanford vil!
meet tomorrow are a good, big,
grinding, and sometimes excruciat
ingly lucky football team. Their
line, as always, is big and experi
enced. Their backs are built like
tackles, and can run 'ike frightened
bulldozers. They are good, they
bow that they are good, and
have developed the commendable
habit of winning.
TROY DEEP
If the Indians are to take Troy to
morrow they must somehow be able
to face and hold, if not beat, the
waves and waves of eaually good
Trojan linemen that will flow in a
constant energetic stream between
the (wo opposing quarterbacks.
They must be able to stop the
deadly pin-point passing of USC's
fine qb, Jim Powers, and stall the
thundering thrusts of fullback Bill
; Martin — who has scored at least
j once in every game this year, end
who tallied twice against Notre
Dame last year.
If the Cardinal team can do this,
| or even come reasonably close to
doing this, they will beat USC to
morrow afternoon.
POWERS, MARTIN GREAT
And, to reiterate, the two gentle
| men they must stop are Powers and
[ Martin — two of the nation's most
deadly backs. To make it much
more sporting (i.e., difficult), these
two gentlemen will have nine more
very capable chaps doing their level
best to see that they aren't stopped.
Troy will move out to war against
the Stanford warriors with a legion
that sets up like this:
Quarterback: Here is the heart of
the USC football team —Jim "Mys
tic" Powers. Powers, in the past,
has been on the beaucoup erratic
! side, but his consistency and his
I genius have picked up tremendous
ly this year.
So tremendously, in fact, that one
j of the Stanford scouts has referred
f"to him as the best quarterback on
j the coast. Many LA writers have
j gone further—they think he is an
i All-American. And Powers' record
| almost substantiates it.
Fullback: This is another high
j spot on the Trojan machine, and is
I very ably held down by All-Coast
candidate Bill Martin. Martin is
USC's hardest-hitting back, and the
best line backer that Stanfordites
will see since Quist and Kempthorn.
! Martin weighs a lusty 200. and hails
from Alhambra High, where he
rrrade "Player of the Year" for the
CIF in 1944. The "Battleship" cur
rently leads the PCC scorers with
nine (count 'em—nine) touchdowns
and a tidy total of 54 valuable
j points.
Halfbacks: Here is a very strong
Trojan position, but it is impossible
to state exactly who will start for
Troy at either place. Jay Roundy
and Art Battle, names that need
little glossing, will start if they are

in shape.
But the remarkable pair have had
injury trouble: Rountly has had the
miseries all season, and Oregon—il
they accomplished little else—man
aged to knock Battle out for a coup
le of games.
But the 'oss of these men is hardly
noticeable with splendid — very
splendid—flashers like Bill Bowers,
Al Cantor, Pat Duff. Johnny Wil
liams, and Johnny Fouch of Santa
Ana.
All are flashes, all are dangerous,
and it would take a book to inves-

tigate their potentialities. Williams
is the lad who danced that 70-some
odd punt return against Oregon.
Cantor was on the receiving end
of a 90-yard pass play in Seattle.
Fouch, Duff, and Bowers were the
three most highly rated prep backs
the coast has seen. USC is strong in
this position.
Ends: Bob Stillwell was pre-rated
an All - American. Most observers
now seem to have given up that
idea, but he is a cinch All - Coast.
Rugged on defense, and a splendid
blocker, the 200-pound 6-footer is
probably the most able wingman
that the Indians have yet faced.
Holding down the left end of the
big Trojan line is Hal Hatfield, a
(i - foot - one, 205 - pound letterman
from Hermosa Beach. Hatfield is no
Stillwell, but is no bum either.
Tackles: USC, this year, is the
proud possessor of exactly 445
pounds of mean, aggressive tackle.
Of this:, 230 pounds is ably supplied
by Jiin Bird, a lad who has his
share of varsity letters at the south
ern school.
Bird looked his best against the
Irish last season, and has been one
of the best tackles on the coast all
season. The other weighty subject
in the Trojan line is Chuck Peter
son, who alternates with the equally
efficient Volney Peters, who out
weighs him by one pound—2l6.
Guards: Last week against Wash
ington the Trojans only used five
guards, but all of them were big.
The starters, Jess Swope and Paul
McMurtry, balance each other out
nicely, each weighing in at 225
pounds.
The best example of the solidarity
of the Trojan guard squad came in
the Oregon game, when five times in

the first half USC made goal-line
' stands.
Oregon ful back Bob Sanders, a
fair-enough lad in his own ac
tually bounced back like he was
hitting a rubber band when he
tested the goal-line ruggedness of
Messrs. Swope and McMurtry.
Centers: Last year Center Boyd
Hachten made second - string All —
Coast. This year be is riding the
bench and watching 195 - pound
George Davis, from Redwood City,
fii'ht the gridiron wars from the
pivot post.
Davis hrs three ye.'trs of experi
ence' with the Trolley-Trackers. He
is dfnendable anil u good down
field blocker.
Stanford, in spite of Trojan man
power, can beiit USC tomorrow.
They cm pass them. They can run
them. But they are going to have an
exceedingly interesting time at-
I tempting it.


WILBUR ROBER TSON, signal -
calling understudy to Southern
Cal's Jim (Mystic) Powers, will he
out of the Card-Troian tilt tomor
row with a broken jaw.

Ends: Bob Stillwell was pre-rated
an All - American. Most observers
now seem to have given up that
idea, but he is a cinch All - Coast.
Rugged on defense, and a splendid
blocker, the 200-pound 6-footer is
probably the most able wingman
that the Indians have yet faced.
Holding down the left end of the
big Trojan line is Hal Hatfield, a
(i - foot - one, 205 - pound letterman
from Hermosa Beach. Hatfield is no
Stillwell, but is no bum either.
Tackles: USC, this year, is the
proud possessor of exactly 445
pounds of mean, aggressive tackle.
Of this:, 230 pounds is ably supplied
by Jiin Bird, a lad who has his
share of varsity letters at the south
ern school.
Bird looked his best against the
Irish last season, and has been one
of the best tackles on the coast all
season. The other weighty subject
in the Trojan line is Chuck Peter
son, who alternates with the equally
efficient Volney Peters, who out
weighs him by one pound—2l6.
Guards: Last week against Wash
ington the Trojans only used five
guards, but all of them were big.
The starters, Jess Swope and Paul
McMurtry, balance each other out
nicely, each weighing in at 225
pounds.
The best example of the solidarity
of the Trojan guard squad came in
the Oregon game, when five times in

the first half USC made goal-line
' stands.
Oregon ful back Bob Sanders, a
fair-enough lad in his own ac
tually bounced back like he was
hitting a rubber band when he
tested the goal-line ruggedness of
Messrs. Swope and McMurtry.
Centers: Last year Center Boyd
Hachten made second - string All —
Coast. This year be is riding the
bench and watching 195 - pound
George Davis, from Redwood City,
fii'ht the gridiron wars from the
pivot post.
Davis hrs three ye.'trs of experi
ence' with the Trolley-Trackers. He
is dfnendable anil u good down
field blocker.
Stanford, in spite of Trojan man
power, can beiit USC tomorrow.
They cm pass them. They can run
them. But they are going to have an
exceedingly interesting time at-
I tempting it.


WILBUR ROBER TSON, signal -
calling understudy to Southern
Cal's Jim (Mystic) Powers, will he
out of the Card-Troian tilt tomor
row with a broken jaw.
Tomorrow, just two and a half
hours after the sun has passed the
meridian, the white - shirted Red
Machine will venture out on the
°reen-painted turf of the Los Ange
les Coliseum to do battle with a
team that many pre-season pickers
had tabbed as possible national
I champions.
And the Trojans of USC might
well be living up to their pre-sea
son hopes had they not flubbed
against an unusually excited Ohio
State team in Los Angeles, and then
got themselves tangled up in the
four-leaf clovered turf of Straw
! berry Canyon.
The Trojans that Stanford vil!
meet tomorrow are a good, big,
grinding, and sometimes excruciat
ingly lucky football team. Their
line, as always, is big and experi
enced. Their backs are built like
tackles, and can run 'ike frightened
bulldozers. They are good, they
bow that they are good, and
have developed the commendable
habit of winning.
TROY DEEP
If the Indians are to take Troy to
morrow they must somehow be able
to face and hold, if not beat, the
waves and waves of eaually good
Trojan linemen that will flow in a
constant energetic stream between
the (wo opposing quarterbacks.
They must be able to stop the
deadly pin-point passing of USC's
fine qb, Jim Powers, and stall the
thundering thrusts of fullback Bill
; Martin — who has scored at least
j once in every game this year, end
who tallied twice against Notre
Dame last year.
If the Cardinal team can do this,
| or even come reasonably close to
doing this, they will beat USC to
morrow afternoon.
POWERS, MARTIN GREAT
And, to reiterate, the two gentle
| men they must stop are Powers and
[ Martin — two of the nation's most
deadly backs. To make it much
more sporting (i.e., difficult), these
two gentlemen will have nine more
very capable chaps doing their level
best to see that they aren't stopped.
Troy will move out to war against
the Stanford warriors with a legion
that sets up like this:
Quarterback: Here is the heart of
the USC football team —Jim "Mys
tic" Powers. Powers, in the past,
has been on the beaucoup erratic
! side, but his consistency and his
I genius have picked up tremendous
ly this year.
So tremendously, in fact, that one
j of the Stanford scouts has referred
f"to him as the best quarterback on
j the coast. Many LA writers have
j gone further—they think he is an
i All-American. And Powers' record
| almost substantiates it.
Fullback: This is another high
j spot on the Trojan machine, and is
I very ably held down by All-Coast
candidate Bill Martin. Martin is
USC's hardest-hitting back, and the
best line backer that Stanfordites
will see since Quist and Kempthorn.
! Martin weighs a lusty 200. and hails
from Alhambra High, where he
rrrade "Player of the Year" for the
CIF in 1944. The "Battleship" cur
rently leads the PCC scorers with
nine (count 'em—nine) touchdowns
and a tidy total of 54 valuable
j points.
Halfbacks: Here is a very strong
Trojan position, but it is impossible
to state exactly who will start for
Troy at either place. Jay Roundy
and Art Battle, names that need
little glossing, will start if they are

in shape.
But the remarkable pair have had
injury trouble: Rountly has had the
miseries all season, and Oregon—il
they accomplished little else—man
aged to knock Battle out for a coup
le of games.
But the 'oss of these men is hardly
noticeable with splendid — very
splendid—flashers like Bill Bowers,
Al Cantor, Pat Duff. Johnny Wil
liams, and Johnny Fouch of Santa
Ana.
All are flashes, all are dangerous,
and it would take a book to inves-

tigate their potentialities. Williams
is the lad who danced that 70-some
odd punt return against Oregon.
Cantor was on the receiving end
of a 90-yard pass play in Seattle.
Fouch, Duff, and Bowers were the
three most highly rated prep backs
the coast has seen. USC is strong in
this position.

now seem to have given up that
idea, but he is a cinch All - Coast.

[ Martin — two of the nation's most
deadly backs. To make it much
more sporting (i.e., difficult), these
two gentlemen will have nine more
very capable chaps doing their level
best to see that they aren't stopped.
Troy will move out to war against
the Stanford warriors with a legion
that sets up like this:
Quarterback: Here is the heart of
the USC football team —Jim "Mys
tic" Powers. Powers, in the past,
has been on the beaucoup erratic
! side, but his consistency and his
I genius have picked up tremendous
ly this year.
So tremendously, in fact, that one
j of the Stanford scouts has referred
f"to him as the best quarterback on
j the coast. Many LA writers have
j gone further—they think he is an
i All-American. And Powers' record
| almost substantiates it.
Fullback: This is another high
j spot on the Trojan machine, and is
I very ably held down by All-Coast
candidate Bill Martin. Martin is
USC's hardest-hitting back, and the
best line backer that Stanfordites
will see since Quist and Kempthorn.
! Martin weighs a lusty 200. and hails
from Alhambra High, where he
rrrade "Player of the Year" for the
CIF in 1944. The "Battleship" cur
rently leads the PCC scorers with
nine (count 'em—nine) touchdowns
and a tidy total of 54 valuable
j points.
Halfbacks: Here is a very strong
Trojan position, but it is impossible
to state exactly who will start for
Troy at either place. Jay Roundy
and Art Battle, names that need
little glossing, will start if they are

in shape.
But the remarkable pair have had
injury trouble: Rountly has had the
miseries all season, and Oregon—il
they accomplished little else—man
aged to knock Battle out for a coup
le of games.
But the 'oss of these men is hardly
noticeable with splendid — very
splendid—flashers like Bill Bowers,
Al Cantor, Pat Duff. Johnny Wil
liams, and Johnny Fouch of Santa
Ana.
All are flashes, all are dangerous,
and it would take a book to inves-

tigate their potentialities. Williams
is the lad who danced that 70-some
odd punt return against Oregon.
Cantor was on the receiving end
of a 90-yard pass play in Seattle.
Fouch, Duff, and Bowers were the
three most highly rated prep backs
the coast has seen. USC is strong in
this position.
Ends: Bob Stillwell was pre-rated
an All - American. Most observers
now seem to have given up that
idea, but he is a cinch All - Coast.
Rugged on defense, and a splendid
blocker, the 200-pound 6-footer is
probably the most able wingman
that the Indians have yet faced.
Holding down the left end of the
big Trojan line is Hal Hatfield, a
(i - foot - one, 205 - pound letterman
from Hermosa Beach. Hatfield is no
Stillwell, but is no bum either.
Tackles: USC, this year, is the
proud possessor of exactly 445
pounds of mean, aggressive tackle.
Of this:, 230 pounds is ably supplied
by Jiin Bird, a lad who has his
share of varsity letters at the south
ern school.
Bird looked his best against the
Irish last season, and has been one
of the best tackles on the coast all
season. The other weighty subject
in the Trojan line is Chuck Peter
son, who alternates with the equally
efficient Volney Peters, who out
weighs him by one pound—2l6.
Guards: Last week against Wash
ington the Trojans only used five
guards, but all of them were big.
The starters, Jess Swope and Paul
McMurtry, balance each other out
nicely, each weighing in at 225
pounds.
The best example of the solidarity
of the Trojan guard squad came in
the Oregon game, when five times in

the first half USC made goal-line
' stands.
Oregon ful back Bob Sanders, a
fair-enough lad in his own ac
tually bounced back like he was
hitting a rubber band when he
tested the goal-line ruggedness of
Messrs. Swope and McMurtry.
Centers: Last year Center Boyd
Hachten made second - string All —
Coast. This year be is riding the
bench and watching 195 - pound
George Davis, from Redwood City,
fii'ht the gridiron wars from the
pivot post.
Davis hrs three ye.'trs of experi
ence' with the Trolley-Trackers. He
is dfnendable anil u good down
field blocker.
Stanford, in spite of Trojan man
power, can beiit USC tomorrow.
They cm pass them. They can run
them. But they are going to have an
exceedingly interesting time at-
I tempting it.


WILBUR ROBER TSON, signal -
calling understudy to Southern
Cal's Jim (Mystic) Powers, will he
out of the Card-Troian tilt tomor
row with a broken jaw.
Tomorrow, just two and a half
hours after the sun has passed the
meridian, the white - shirted Red
Machine will venture out on the
°reen-painted turf of the Los Ange
les Coliseum to do battle with a
team that many pre-season pickers
had tabbed as possible national
I champions.
And the Trojans of USC might
well be living up to their pre-sea
son hopes had they not flubbed
against an unusually excited Ohio
State team in Los Angeles, and then
got themselves tangled up in the
four-leaf clovered turf of Straw
! berry Canyon.
The Trojans that Stanford vil!
meet tomorrow are a good, big,
grinding, and sometimes excruciat
ingly lucky football team. Their
line, as always, is big and experi
enced. Their backs are built like
tackles, and can run 'ike frightened
bulldozers. They are good, they
bow that they are good, and
have developed the commendable
habit of winning.
TROY DEEP
If the Indians are to take Troy to
morrow they must somehow be able
to face and hold, if not beat, the
waves and waves of eaually good
Trojan linemen that will flow in a
constant energetic stream between
the (wo opposing quarterbacks.
They must be able to stop the
deadly pin-point passing of USC's
fine qb, Jim Powers, and stall the
thundering thrusts of fullback Bill
; Martin — who has scored at least
j once in every game this year, end
who tallied twice against Notre
Dame last year.
If the Cardinal team can do this,
| or even come reasonably close to
doing this, they will beat USC to
morrow afternoon.

Hachten made second - string All —
Coast. This year be is riding the
bench and watching 195 - pound
George Davis, from Redwood City,
fii'ht the gridiron wars from the
pivot post.
Davis hrs three ye.'trs of experi
ence' with the Trolley-Trackers. He
is dfnendable anil u good down
field blocker.
Stanford, in spite of Trojan man
power, can beiit USC tomorrow.
They cm pass them. They can run
them. But they are going to have an
exceedingly interesting time at-
I tempting it.


WILBUR ROBER TSON, signal -
calling understudy to Southern
Cal's Jim (Mystic) Powers, will he
out of the Card-Troian tilt tomor
row with a broken jaw.
Tomorrow, just two and a half
hours after the sun has passed the
meridian, the white - shirted Red
Machine will venture out on the
°reen-painted turf of the Los Ange
les Coliseum to do battle with a
team that many pre-season pickers
had tabbed as possible national
I champions.
And the Trojans of USC might
well be living up to their pre-sea
son hopes had they not flubbed
against an unusually excited Ohio
State team in Los Angeles, and then
got themselves tangled up in the
four-leaf clovered turf of Straw
! berry Canyon.
The Trojans that Stanford vil!
meet tomorrow are a good, big,
grinding, and sometimes excruciat
ingly lucky football team. Their
line, as always, is big and experi
enced. Their backs are built like
tackles, and can run 'ike frightened
bulldozers. They are good, they
bow that they are good, and
have developed the commendable
habit of winning.
TROY DEEP
If the Indians are to take Troy to
morrow they must somehow be able
to face and hold, if not beat, the
waves and waves of eaually good
Trojan linemen that will flow in a
constant energetic stream between
the (wo opposing quarterbacks.
They must be able to stop the
deadly pin-point passing of USC's
fine qb, Jim Powers, and stall the
thundering thrusts of fullback Bill
; Martin — who has scored at least
j once in every game this year, end
who tallied twice against Notre
Dame last year.
If the Cardinal team can do this,
| or even come reasonably close to
doing this, they will beat USC to
morrow afternoon.
POWERS, MARTIN GREAT
And, to reiterate, the two gentle
| men they must stop are Powers and
[ Martin — two of the nation's most
deadly backs. To make it much
more sporting (i.e., difficult), these
two gentlemen will have nine more
very capable chaps doing their level
best to see that they aren't stopped.
Troy will move out to war against
the Stanford warriors with a legion
that sets up like this:
Quarterback: Here is the heart of
the USC football team —Jim "Mys
tic" Powers. Powers, in the past,
has been on the beaucoup erratic
! side, but his consistency and his
I genius have picked up tremendous
ly this year.
So tremendously, in fact, that one
j of the Stanford scouts has referred
f"to him as the best quarterback on
j the coast. Many LA writers have
j gone further—they think he is an
i All-American. And Powers' record
| almost substantiates it.
Fullback: This is another high
j spot on the Trojan machine, and is
I very ably held down by All-Coast
candidate Bill Martin. Martin is
USC's hardest-hitting back, and the
best line backer that Stanfordites
will see since Quist and Kempthorn.
! Martin weighs a lusty 200. and hails
from Alhambra High, where he
rrrade "Player of the Year" for the
CIF in 1944. The "Battleship" cur
rently leads the PCC scorers with
nine (count 'em—nine) touchdowns
and a tidy total of 54 valuable
j points.
Halfbacks: Here is a very strong
Trojan position, but it is impossible
to state exactly who will start for
Troy at either place. Jay Roundy
and Art Battle, names that need
little glossing, will start if they are

in shape.
But the remarkable pair have had
injury trouble: Rountly has had the
miseries all season, and Oregon—il
they accomplished little else—man
aged to knock Battle out for a coup
le of games.
But the 'oss of these men is hardly
noticeable with splendid — very
splendid—flashers like Bill Bowers,
Al Cantor, Pat Duff. Johnny Wil
liams, and Johnny Fouch of Santa
Ana.
All are flashes, all are dangerous,
and it would take a book to inves-

tigate their potentialities. Williams
is the lad who danced that 70-some
odd punt return against Oregon.
Cantor was on the receiving end
of a 90-yard pass play in Seattle.
Fouch, Duff, and Bowers were the
three most highly rated prep backs
the coast has seen. USC is strong in
this position.
Ends: Bob Stillwell was pre-rated
an All - American. Most observers
now seem to have given up that
idea, but he is a cinch All - Coast.
Rugged on defense, and a splendid
blocker, the 200-pound 6-footer is
probably the most able wingman
that the Indians have yet faced.
Holding down the left end of the
big Trojan line is Hal Hatfield, a
(i - foot - one, 205 - pound letterman
from Hermosa Beach. Hatfield is no
Stillwell, but is no bum either.
Tackles: USC, this year, is the
proud possessor of exactly 445
pounds of mean, aggressive tackle.
Of this:, 230 pounds is ably supplied
by Jiin Bird, a lad who has his
share of varsity letters at the south
ern school.
Bird looked his best against the
Irish last season, and has been one
of the best tackles on the coast all
season. The other weighty subject
in the Trojan line is Chuck Peter
son, who alternates with the equally
efficient Volney Peters, who out
weighs him by one pound—2l6.
Guards: Last week against Wash
ington the Trojans only used five
guards, but all of them were big.
The starters, Jess Swope and Paul
McMurtry, balance each other out
nicely, each weighing in at 225
pounds.
The best example of the solidarity
of the Trojan guard squad came in
the Oregon game, when five times in

the first half USC made goal-line
' stands.
Oregon ful back Bob Sanders, a
fair-enough lad in his own ac
tually bounced back like he was
hitting a rubber band when he
tested the goal-line ruggedness of
Messrs. Swope and McMurtry.
