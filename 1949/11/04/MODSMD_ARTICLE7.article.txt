# Stanford Student Expelled
## 
### 
A man has been expelled from the
University following his conviction
by Men and Women's Councils of a
second Honor Code violation.
The recommendation of expulsion
came in a joint meeting of the two
I odies (acting as Council for Stu
dent Control) with Dean Kimpton
Octobcr 20. It was the last of a
series of three meetings involving
two Honor Code cases.
In the other case two men charged
with cheating on Geology examina
tions taking out of class were acquit
ted for lack of evidence. In view of
the impossibility of securing third
person testimony, the similarity in
the students' test papers was con
sidered insufficient to prove beyond
doubt that cheating had occurred.
'[ he facts of the case which cul
minated in expulsion involved cheat
ing alleged to have taken place in a
classroom during a mathematics
exam. A striking similarity appeared
between the papers of two students
for the first part of the test during
which time the men were seen to
occupy adjacent scats. The students
were separated later and their tests
showed no further resemblance.
After hearing testimony by profes
sors in the department and by the
student himself, the Council decided
that there was no reasonable doubt
of guilt. It recommended unquali
fied dismissal from the University,
the penalty customarily attached to
conviction of a second violation of
the Honor Code.
Also discussed at the meeting was
the general problem of penalties in
view ef reccnt failure to reinterpret
the Code. The view was expressed
that penalties for Honor Code vio
lation-; should depend upon the ex
tent of rules permitting overseeing
of the Code's cfTectivencss.

Councils were: Men's Council—Fred
Cummings, chairman; Jack Barnes,
Gay Bryan, Kim Fletcher, and Dick
Kilncr; Women's Council — Doris
