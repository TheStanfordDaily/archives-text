# Does German Nationalism Threaten Peace of World?
## 
### 
Neo-Nazicm â€” a fascism as
pure as that of the Hitler regime
-is being tolerated and con
doned today in Germany, Erika
Mann, noted author and corre
spondent told an overflow audi
ence yesterday afternoon in the
Memorial Auditorium Little
Theater.
The Germans, Miss Mann pointed
! out, have not keen chastened by
their defeat in World Wet!' 11. To
day. trading on American hatred and
fear of Communism, they are again
raising their voices in the familiar
slogans of Hitler's Nazis, and the re
sult is a sudden regrowth of irra
j tional, hysterical nationalism which
J will have a serious consequence in
| Europe and in the world.
Until two years ago, Miss Mann
I stated, the rebuilding of Germany,
| even under the supervision and eco
j nomic backing of the United States,
| was defeated by the passive resis
; tance of the Germans themselves.
Miss Mann illustrated the rise of
an unrebulTed Germany with figures
from the recent Western German
I election. The Communists captured

I only 15 seats, while the "splinter
i right, pure fascist" parties won 117.
In comparing the totalitarian sys
t terns of Fascism and Communism,
Miss Mann noted an external simi
larity of methods. Yet, the original
and ultimate aim of Communism,
however far it has been neglected in
Russia, is toward a better life and
I progress for the mass of the people
To combat this "continuing crisis,'
[ states Miss Mann, we Americans
j must become the real champions of
j peace and progress; we must set up
! a more realistic Marshall Plan ad
j ministered by the United Nations;
j we must foster world trade; and we
j must acknowledge the real meaning
I of "One World," an acknowledgment
I based on the realization that all the
! governments of the world need not
1 be modeled after our own.
"The United States must nuide the
j world, not attempt to buy it."
Miss Mann's speech was presented
i under the auspices of the Stanford
: Creative Writing Center. For the
I past week, Miss Mann has been en
gaged in consultation with the Cen
| ter's writing classes. Her visit to
Stanford was made possible through
j a fund set up by the American
' Council of Learned Societies.
