## Atomic Energy Control 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, Nov. 6 (/I 1 ) â€”The
problem of atomic energy control
comes into the open in the United
Nations tomorrow after weeks of
unsuccessful, secrct six-power talks.
The 59 - nation special political
committee will begin open discus
sion on a report of 10 weeks of dead
locked meetings by the United
States, Britain, France, China, Can
ada, and Russia. But efforts to sway
the Russians to the majority view
favoring international control and
inspection appear doomed to failure.
