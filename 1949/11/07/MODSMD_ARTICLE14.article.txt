# Indians Scalp USC Trojans, 34 to 13
## Star-Lit Rallies, Halftime Circus Mark Weekend 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The mind is still a little
fogged after a hilariously won
derful weekend; but a few per
sistent memories stand out in
the midst of the confusion
The only emotion, of course, was
that of amazement. Wide-eyed, stu
pefying amazement.
Trojan rooters and members of the
L.A. press were the most shocked.
But more than a few Stanford
rooters were seen pinching them
selves, too.
HORSE LAUGII
Two or three southern scribes did
get the horse-laugh on their col
leagues by predicting the Card win.
One of them, naturally enough, was
Dick Hyland, who once caught a 60-
yard pass that clinched an even
more stunning upset victory over the
same Trojans. That was in 1926,
when Troy had a center named JcfT
Cravath.
One writer summed up the situa
tion by writing that the Trojan ma
chine went into backromatic Satur
day.
Those USC rally boys staged an
extravagant production for their
homecoming celebration. They baked
a gorgeous cake with all the trim
mings. Which must have made it
very disappointing when it fell with
such a thud.
SIX-RING CIRCUS
F'rinstancc, the Brothers Ringling
would have felt a pang of envy
watching that six-ring halftime exhi
bition.
Could be that the Figucroans even
overdid the whole thing. It was a
wee bit hard for any one individual
to keep his attention focused on the
float parade, numerous leggy women,
dancing Indians, two bands, multi
card stunts, and what have you, ali
at one time.
The Trojan Knights also outdid
themselves the night before the
game, when they arranged a five
hour rally done up in true Holly
wood style.
STARS APPEAR
Peggy Lee, Marie Wilson, Jerry
Lewis, Dean Martin, Buddy Baer,
and William Demarest arc a few of
the stars who contributed their tal
ents to Troy's ill-fated cause.
Ex-pug Baer, incidentally, has re
cently turned night-club singer; and
his two numbers were checringly
received by the Trojan guys and
gals
Stanford had a rally Friday night,
too, cunningly combined with a
cocktail party at the Ambassador
Hotel.
JefT and Marchie were there,
each complimenting the other's foot
ball team, but the Hollywood stars
were missing.
But when it's all snid and done, it
was the Marchicmcn who made the
weekend such a howling success.
They blocked, they tackled, they
sped, just like we knew they could
all the time.
They played the game we've been
waiting for since way back when.
And even made the waiting seem
worthwhile.

to keep his attention focused on the
float parade, numerous leggy women,
dancing Indians, two bands, multi
card stunts, and what have you, ali
at one time.
The Trojan Knights also outdid
themselves the night before the
game, when they arranged a five
hour rally done up in true Holly
wood style.
STARS APPEAR
Peggy Lee, Marie Wilson, Jerry
Lewis, Dean Martin, Buddy Baer,
and William Demarest arc a few of
the stars who contributed their tal
ents to Troy's ill-fated cause.
Ex-pug Baer, incidentally, has re
cently turned night-club singer; and
his two numbers were checringly
received by the Trojan guys and
gals
Stanford had a rally Friday night,
too, cunningly combined with a
cocktail party at the Ambassador
Hotel.
JefT and Marchie were there,
each complimenting the other's foot
ball team, but the Hollywood stars
were missing.
But when it's all snid and done, it
was the Marchicmcn who made the
weekend such a howling success.
They blocked, they tackled, they
sped, just like we knew they could
all the time.
They played the game we've been
waiting for since way back when.
And even made the waiting seem
worthwhile.
The mind is still a little
fogged after a hilariously won
derful weekend; but a few per
sistent memories stand out in
the midst of the confusion
The only emotion, of course, was
that of amazement. Wide-eyed, stu
pefying amazement.
Trojan rooters and members of the
L.A. press were the most shocked.
But more than a few Stanford
rooters were seen pinching them
selves, too.
HORSE LAUGII
Two or three southern scribes did
get the horse-laugh on their col
leagues by predicting the Card win.
One of them, naturally enough, was
Dick Hyland, who once caught a 60-
yard pass that clinched an even
more stunning upset victory over the
same Trojans. That was in 1926,
when Troy had a center named JcfT
Cravath.
One writer summed up the situa
tion by writing that the Trojan ma
chine went into backromatic Satur
day.
Those USC rally boys staged an
extravagant production for their
homecoming celebration. They baked
a gorgeous cake with all the trim
mings. Which must have made it
very disappointing when it fell with
such a thud.
SIX-RING CIRCUS
F'rinstancc, the Brothers Ringling
would have felt a pang of envy
watching that six-ring halftime exhi
bition.
Could be that the Figucroans even
overdid the whole thing. It was a
wee bit hard for any one individual
to keep his attention focused on the
float parade, numerous leggy women,
dancing Indians, two bands, multi
card stunts, and what have you, ali
at one time.
