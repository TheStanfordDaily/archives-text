UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA students demonstrate against
an official order handed down by President Robert G. Sproul,
banning bars in fraternity houses and other collegiate organiza
tions at Berkeley. This ruling also affects the UCLA, Davis,
and Santa Barbara branches of the university. Students arc
rebelling against this new law, but it looks like everyone, in
cluding Oskie, will find himself on the wagon from now on.
