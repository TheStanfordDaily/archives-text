# Bonfire Fuel Blazes After Early Col Raid
## 
### 
The Pre-Big Game raids have started.
The wood for the Big Game Bonfire was set on fire Friday
night, and only quick action by the Fire Department prevented
the entire supply from being destroyed.
A freshman driving by Lake Lagunita spotted the flames and

traced to call the Fire Department.
While he was on his way, the cam
pus patrol car also saw the fire and
radioed in the alarm.
The firemen arrived shortly after
getting the call at 9:35 p.m. and
doused the blaze with more than
3,000 gallons of water.
Another student who arrived on
the scene shortly after claimed he
saw two men running towards La
gunita Hall, but a check of the sur
rounding territory failed to reveal
any invaders.
Several girls in Casa Granada re
ported that a strange car had been
parked in back of Lagunita every
night around 9:30 for the past week,
but, so far, no tangible evidence as
to the raiders' identities has been
uncovered.
Work on the Big Game Bonfire
usually doesn't start until a week
or so before the Cal game, but this
year, due to the limited availability
of wood, the freshmen started right
after the quarter began.
For the past several weeks they
have been out almost every after
noon gathering scrap wood.
Cal men have tried year after year
to set, the bonfire ablaze prema
turely. but have so far been unsuc
cessful.
In 1947, they constructed a time
bomb inside a log. and managed to
place the log in the pile as it was
being constucted.
The bomb went off as planned, but
it had been placed on the outside
of the bonfire, and the flames were
easily extinguished by alert frosh.
Last year, three Cal raiders again
tried to burn the fire, but were
caught by the frosh guards, tried,
sentenced, punished by having their
heads shaved, and then released.
The bonfire is a traditional event
of the Big Game Rally.
