# Coal Tieup Continues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” High govern
ment officials tonight seriously
weighed creation of a Presidential
fact-finding board to hammer at the
tightly jammed coal strike if this
week's mediation efforts fail.
Roughly a week has been assigned
for last-ditch efforts to end the
seven weeks' tieup. The picture
was black. No settlement talks were
even hinted between operators and
union.
