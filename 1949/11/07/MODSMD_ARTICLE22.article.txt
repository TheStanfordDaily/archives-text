SAN BERNARDINO. Nov. G (SP)~
Five Pasadena City College youths,
chained together in a fraternity
hazing spree, were rescued today
after spending eight hours in freez
ing weather in the mountains with
burlap for clothing.
After being dumped out, chained
together and their bodies plastered
with pancake flour, molasses, and
crankcaso oil, the five told sheriff's
deputies that they hiked three miles
down the San Bernardino Mountains
to a store, where aid was summoned.
They said it was part of a fraternity
initiation.
Temperatures had dropped to 150
degrees and the youths were attired
only in bits of burlap. They were
taken to the county jail, cleaned up
and turned over to their parents.
