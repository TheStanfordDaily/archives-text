# Cards Bulldoze SC Out of Race For Rose Bowl
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Rose Bowl would you say?
Could be. Yes, it most cer
tainly could be.
Stanford thoroughly trounced
USC, 34 to 13, Saturday in the
Los Angeles Coliseum in what
this reporter considers to bs
Ihe climax to three years of foot
ball rebuilding on the Farm.
No fluke victory this. Though the
Cards did get the breaks, the win
was the result of hard, rock and
sock football, the likes of which we
too seldom see here.
As a result of the victory, Stan
ford's Bowl stock is on the rise.
Idaho and California are next in
line. If the Cards take both of these
teams they may well find themselves
in the January classic.
A id il the Indians can play up to
their performance of Saturday, the
Cards are in.
Led by co-captain A 1 Rau, the
Caids put on an offensive show that
had the Coliseum's 1949 record col
lege crowd of 70.041 gasping. Rau
was truly a leader. It was his fine
work that sprang more than one
Card back loose for long gainers.

The Stanford football team was
greeted at San Francisco Airport
yesterday by its number one
rooter—Dr Wallace Sterling. The
President of the University shook
hands with each player and con
gratulated him on his individual
play in the USC game.

The contest was complete, with
long runs, thrilling pass plays, and
what have you. But to the 4,000
Stanford rooters the biggest thing
was the sharp blocking and tackling
shown by the Cards.
"Our best game of the year," com
mented Schwartz after the game. It
was all of that. Never has this re
porter seen Stanford play football
in such a fashion.
That the Card line was great is
made evident by a look at the sta
tistics. Stanford gained 301 yards on
running plays while holding the Tro
jans to a mere 68 yards.
Pick out a Stanford lineman and
you have a star. If you want names,
try Jesse Cone, Bruce Van Alstyne,
Russ Pomeroy, Jim Castagnoli, and,
of course, Rau.
But it is hardly fair to the rest of
the team to single out even these
men. For it a team victory all
the way.
Inspired' is the word for the play
of the Cards. Backs were falling
forward when they were hit, always
working for that extra foot.
The scoring plays are known to
most of the Farm Family by now,
but it is sufficient to say that Bob
White repeated, no — bettered, his
1948 performance in the Coliseum.
His mates set him loose on the
Stanford 23-yard line and the Card
junior went the rest of the way by
himself—76 yards—for the first Stan
ford score.
Six minutes later, still in the sec
ond quarter, Bill DeYoung returned
a Powers punt 62 yards for the sec
ond marker. It was on this play that
Schwartz said he "Saw six good
blocks." And good blocks there were,
Stanford led 20 to 0 at halftime by
a Kerkorian to Rose pass from 16
yards out.
It was in the third quarter that
the Trojans came to life and out
played the Indians. Quarterback Jim
Powers hit for pass after pass to
run up a good part of his 290-yard
total. USC marched and passed
