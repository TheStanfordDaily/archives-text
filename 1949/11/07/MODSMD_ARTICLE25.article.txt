# Give to Stanford Relief Drive
## 
### 
This week we are being asked to give gen
erously to the Stanford Relief Drive. This is
our opportunity to help support nearly every
worthwhile charity.
Winter quarter we have the Red Cross drive,
and in the spring the Convalescent Home
drive. But the Stanford Relief Drive is the com
prehensive one, covering local, national, and
foreign charities.
Our goal is $12,000 .... about $1.50 per
student. By foregoing a couple of movies, an
afternoon at Rosotti's, we can substantially
help to alleviate the misery and suffering that
is still very much in evidence all over the
world, not only abroad but right in our own
backyard.
OI the money we give, 60 per cent will go to
our foreign committments. And they are com
mittments. The Stanford student body has
pledged itself to support the University of Na
ples and those students and educators who
have broken away from the Communist-domi
nated University of Berlin and are earnestly
trying to establish a new university where
they can enjoy freedom of thought and
speech.
Part of this 60 per cent, through SIRO, will
provide food and clothing for the needy of a
still-stricken Europe. And if you don't believe
this aid is needed, just talk to a few of the
Stanford students who have been abroad re
cently. Part of our donations, through the
United Nations Appeal for Children, will help
to give bread and butter and hope to the next
generation .... the generation that we hope
will make this a better world in which our chil
dren can live without fear and privation. With
out having to fight.

Through the Stanford Relief Drive, then, we
are helping tellow students. John Cole, travel
ing secretary for the World Student Service
fund, put it this way:
"These students consider it a privilege to
live in that hell, because they are getting a
university education so that they can be the
leaders of the world qf tomorrow."
Our help will mean less hell and more edu
cation.
Half as much money, 30 per cent, will go
into our own backyard, to the Palo Alto Com
munity Youth Fund. This fund provides oper
ating money for the Stanford YWCA, the Boy
and Girl Scouts, Veterans Employment and
Service Council, the YMCA, the Family Serv
ice Association, and the Youth Co-ordinating
Council.
Here we are helping to keep neighbors
healthy and happy and to provide a good
environment for their children.
The remaining 10 per cent of our donations
goes to the Emergency Floating Fund to sup
port national charities such as the Community
Chest, the March of Dimes, and Cancer, and
to provide help when disaster strikes in the
form of floods, storms, and fires.
But these charities receive help from all over
the United States; therefore we are giving the
greatest share of our help to those needy and
worthwhile agencies, foreign and local, that
receive less help.
The display in the Stanford Bookstore win
dow hits the nail squarely on the head . . . .
"They Still Need You."
So give to the Stanford Relief Drive, gen
erously. There is no better investment, for we
are investing in a better world. â€”J.L.
