# Chinese Communism Viewed by Bottorff
## 
### JULIE DOCKSTADER 
"You could never I ell an officer
from a soldier," said John Bottorff
about the Communist army. "Stand
ards of living were almost, the same
for both."
Mr. and Mrs. BottorfT were in a
zone of Communist occupation dur
ing their two-year stay in Peking,
China, as representatives of the
Hoover Institute and Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. Their
purpose was to collect current liter
ature which would plug the holes in
the background of the recent Com
munist-Nationalist struggle.
At one time, Oottorff bicycled
along the Communist lines in search
of headquarters, where he hoped to
find propaganda pamphlets and lit
erature of interest to the library.
However, he said, this trip was un
successful.
For over a month, officers of a
Communist engineering company
were quartered in the Bottorff home,
where they became more like
friends than conquerors. When the
officers left, they gave the Bottorffs
some Communist propaganda litera-

lure in exchange for family photo
graphs.
Mr. Eottorff was favorably im
pressed by the actions and attitudes
of the Communist army. Although
the present army leaders are trying
to formalize the military system,
while the Bottorffs were in Peking
it was marked by its democratic as
pects.
Every night the various squads
held squad meetings at which they
discussed subjects such as "How We
Can Improve Relations with the
Populace." They have had some
success in improving social condi
tions in Peking.
There is no organized reaction to
the Communist forces, according to
Mr. Bottorff, and no possibility of
any organization within the area
trying to push out the Communist
government, because there is noth
ing that can be offered to take its
place.
Mr. Bottorff first went to China
with the Army OSS in 1945. After
his discharge he stayed on as a civil
ian worker, later returned to the
United States for a few months, and
then went back to China, where he
met. his wife. They were married
on December 27, 194(5, and Eve, the
Bottorffs' daughter, was born in Pe
king in 1948.
Mr. Bottorff brought his bride to
Peking, where he did graduate work
in Chinese and Occidental history at
Yenching University. In 1947 Mrs.
Bottorff was appointed Hoover Li
brary representative when Mr. and
Mrs. Arthur Wright, of the Stanford
History Department, left for the
United States. Mrs. Wright is now
curate of the Hoover Library col
lection. Later, Mr. Bottorff was also
appointed a representative.

ards of living were almost, the same
for both."
Mr. and Mrs. BottorfT were in a
zone of Communist occupation dur
ing their two-year stay in Peking,
China, as representatives of the
Hoover Institute and Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. Their
purpose was to collect current liter
ature which would plug the holes in
the background of the recent Com
munist-Nationalist struggle.
At one time, Oottorff bicycled
along the Communist lines in search
of headquarters, where he hoped to
find propaganda pamphlets and lit
erature of interest to the library.
However, he said, this trip was un
successful.
For over a month, officers of a
Communist engineering company
were quartered in the Bottorff home,
where they became more like
friends than conquerors. When the
officers left, they gave the Bottorffs
some Communist propaganda litera-

lure in exchange for family photo
graphs.
Mr. Eottorff was favorably im
pressed by the actions and attitudes
of the Communist army. Although
the present army leaders are trying
to formalize the military system,
while the Bottorffs were in Peking
it was marked by its democratic as
pects.
Every night the various squads
held squad meetings at which they
discussed subjects such as "How We
Can Improve Relations with the
Populace." They have had some
success in improving social condi
tions in Peking.
There is no organized reaction to
the Communist forces, according to
Mr. Bottorff, and no possibility of
any organization within the area
trying to push out the Communist
government, because there is noth
ing that can be offered to take its
place.
Mr. Bottorff first went to China
with the Army OSS in 1945. After
his discharge he stayed on as a civil
ian worker, later returned to the
United States for a few months, and
then went back to China, where he
met. his wife. They were married
on December 27, 194(5, and Eve, the
Bottorffs' daughter, was born in Pe
king in 1948.
Mr. Bottorff brought his bride to
Peking, where he did graduate work
in Chinese and Occidental history at
Yenching University. In 1947 Mrs.
Bottorff was appointed Hoover Li
brary representative when Mr. and
Mrs. Arthur Wright, of the Stanford
History Department, left for the
United States. Mrs. Wright is now
curate of the Hoover Library col
lection. Later, Mr. Bottorff was also
appointed a representative.
