# Relief Drive Helps World Student Fund
## 
### 
Some of the money Stanford stu
dents contribute to this week's re
lief drive will go to help university
students in other parts of the world
help themselves.
The World Student Service Fund,
one of the recipients of relief drive
money, provides food, medical sup
plies, and school equipment to uni
versity students in China and Eu
rope; and it provides these things
with money collected from students
and professors only.
Students in some of the hardest
hit countries of Europe are now on
the giving, not the receiving, end of
World Student Relief money. Polish
students are working four to 16
hours a day, in some cases, to earn
money to aid those who are not so
far along on the road to rehabilita
tion.
WSSF gives students badly need
ed rest as well as material aid. Rest
centers have been established where
selected students go for two weeks
of relaxation and healthful environ
ment. There they participate in sem
inars and discussion groups, never
forgetting their responsibility and
privilege in being future leaders ol
the world.
"This Is Their Story," a movie
outlining some of the work of World
Student Relief, will be shown as a
short subject with next Sunday's
movie in Memorial Auditorium.
