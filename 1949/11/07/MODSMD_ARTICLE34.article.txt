# THE 						STANFORD CHIMES
## Carillon Is Belgian Gift 
### JOY HAAS 
The carillon atop Hoover Library
Tower rang out for the first time this
quarter to herald the inauguration J
of Dr. Wallace Sterling as filth pres
ident of Stanford University.
The history of the carillon began |
in l'Jl4 with a telephone call. A
harried American consul in London :
put through a call to Herbert Hoo
ver, young Stanford engineer, ask- |
ing for help in getting thousands of
stranded Americans back to their
homes. He completed this task so .
capably that he was made adminis
trator of relief to the people of Bel- !
gium and Northern France.
HOOVERS FRIENDSHIP
This aid, continuing through the ;
Belgian reconstruction period, laid
the foundation of friendship be
tween the two nations, that was !
later to be expressed in the gift ca
rillon from Belgium.
Marcel Michiels originally cast the
carillon in Tourai, Belgium. It was j
presented to Stanford University in
1941, after being exhibited in the
Belgian Pavilion of tin* Now York |
World's Fair, 19:59-40.
Inscribed in the stone shaft of 1
Hoover Tower are these words: |
"The Carillon is a gift to Stanford
University from the Belgian Amer
ican Educational Foundation, with
which are associated the Belgian j
University and Educational Foun- :
dution, recipients of endowment I
funds from the Commission for l.c- j
lief in Belgium, 1914-1919."

The 155 bells plus ilie electric clock i
weigh IK,OOO pounds, and are ur- |
ranged in the tower to a height of 19 !
feet. Below the bells is a room con- !
tain ing the keyboard or clavier; a
large electrically driven drum can |
be used to play the bells automati- |
cally with the clock. This drum |
contains 7,400 holes, and will play
almost any type of selection suitable |
for the carillon.
In previous years James R. Law
son, who studied in the tradition of
Belgian carillonneurs, played the j
carillon every weekend. Raymond
Sanders, assistant in the speech and

arama oepanment, now plays tor
special occasions while Mr. Lawson
is on a leave of absence studying in
Belgium.
"I ring fur peace" is inscribed in
Latin on the largest of the bells, in
the library tower that is dedicated
as a challenge to war.
