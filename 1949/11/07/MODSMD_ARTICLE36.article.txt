## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Coach Chuck Taylor's hus
tlin' Papooses handed their
youthful mentor his third unde
feated season last Saturday by
overpowering the Cal frosh 27
to 14 in Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium.
Stanford's former All - America
guard received a thundering volley
of well - deserved cheers when he
entered the locker room after the
game. He praised the team as a
whole and congratulated them for a
"great game." This was the third
consecutive victory in the Little Big
Game for the Cardbabes, who de
feated the Bear Cubs 33 to 27 in
1947 and 30 to 0 last year.
A hard-charging Papoose forward
wall added to a potent backfield
gave the Cardbabes a 27 to 0 supe
riority midway in the final quarter.
CAL STOPPED
A rugged defense, led by a pair of
outstanding guards, Norm Manoo
gian and Tom Romano, stopped Cal's
touted "Big Four" backfield cold.
The passing combination of quarter
back Bill Mais to end George Pe
lonis was the only consistent threat
the Bear Cubs showed all afternoon.
The excellent signal - calling and
good passing of Stanford's Joe St.
Geme was ably seconded in all de
partments by Dave Eldredge. The
methodical, hard - driving runs of
frosh halfbacks A 1 Peterson and
Dick Garguilo and of captain and
fullback "Skip" Crist far outshone
the erratic efforts of Cal's Mais,
Keough, Peterson, and Olszewski.
After an exchange of punts in the
first quarter, the Papooses took over
on their own 45. On two successive
plays Dick Garguilo slashed through
guard for two first downs to the Cal
30-yard line. A 1 Peterson went for
six through center, but Skip Crist
was stopped twice and the Cubs
took over on their 20.
STANFORD SCORES
A Cal punt and two fumbles later
— one by each squad — found the
Yearlings on California's 44, after an
11 - yard gain by Peterson. Gains
through the line by Bill Heilbron,
Crist, and Peterson took the ball to
the 23. From there St. Geme passed
to end Bob Thompson for the first
score. Lew Draper converted for
his first of three during the game,
while St. Geme held.
SCORE AGAIN
The Cubs' Mais received the kick
off, but again Cal couldn't organize
an offense and punted to the Stan
ford 45. Peterson made 13. and one
play later, nine more yards. The
same pass play that scored before
clicked again as Thompson scored
on a toss from St. Geme which was
good for 29 yards. Draper made the
score: Stanford 14, Cal 0.
Four plays after the kinkoff the
Papooses took over on their own 42.
An 18-yard gainer by Peterson and
three driving runs by Heilbron took
the pigskin to the 10. Cal stopped
the attack there, but a fumble by
Mais, recovered by Allen Hanner on
the four, put Stanford in scoring po
sition again.
Three yards by Captain Crist and

a tallying quarterback sneak by St.
Gemo made the score 20 t<j 0 just
as the fourth quarter began.
CAL SCORES
Mais took to the air after Cal re
ceived the kiekoff, but the attack he
started soon wilted. Stanford took
over in Cal territory and four short
plays later a 25-yard bootleg pass
from Dave Eldredge to end Bob
Norris was good for another six
points. Draper did the honors to
make it 27 to 0.
After this final humiliation the
Bear Cubs finally got hot and scored
two touchdowns within two minutes.
Mais passed to Keough for the first
from 35 yards out, and tossed to the
same man for 20 yards and the sec
ond score. Keough went all out and
kicked both extra points.

started soon wilted. Stanford took
over in Cal territory and four short
plays later a 25-yard bootleg pass
from Dave Eldredge to end Bob
Norris was good for another six
points. Draper did the honors to
make it 27 to 0.
After this final humiliation the
Bear Cubs finally got hot and scored
two touchdowns within two minutes.
Mais passed to Keough for the first
from 35 yards out, and tossed to the
same man for 20 yards and the sec
ond score. Keough went all out and
kicked both extra points.
