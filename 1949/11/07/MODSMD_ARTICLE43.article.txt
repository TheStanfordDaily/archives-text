In a wide-open, high-scoring con
test in Encina Pool Friday after
noon, the Papoose water poloists
staved off a last-half rally to edge
Sequoia High, 16 to 14.
Stanford's right guard, George
Mowat, took scoring honors with
seven tallies. Ken Cardwell, flashy
Cherokee forward, followed closely
with six.
The first half belonged to the
Cardbabes, who left the pool during
the intermission ahead by 12 to 3.
Seven points by the visitors in the
third period closed the gap so much
that the yearlings had to quit their
position - shifting tactics and settle
down. The fourth quarter was about
nip arid uck on the scoring, with Se
quoia taking a 4-3 advantage. This
wasn't enough to topple the Stanford
lead, however.
It was a great day for goalie Jerry
Van Bergen, recently elected frosh
team captain. The consistent Van
not only made several fine saves but
even scored a point during the third
period when he was playing sprint.
The Stanford swimmers now sport
a record of seven victories in eight
starts.

The Stanford varsity water polo
team returned from the Southland
last night, having split two confer
ence games, and thereby giving up
their last hope for the conference
water polo championship.
After easily beating the UCLA
Bruins 5 to 2 Friday afternoon, the
Card team lost to a strong Southern
Cal team, 9 to 3, Saturday morning.
In Friday's tussle at Westwood
pooJ, Stanford completely dominated
the play, never relinquishing an
early 1 to 0 lead. Forward Ralph
Sala led the scorers with three goals.
In the second game, the Indiana
were the victims of a second-half
Troy splurge which netted the Tro
jans six goals, many of which were
long shots.
The water poloists wind up their
conference play this weekend with a
game against the league - leading
California Bears Saturday morning

. at Encina pool.
In addition they have scheduled
I a return match with the Olympic
i Club Thursday in the club's San
| Francisco pool.
