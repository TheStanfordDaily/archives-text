NEW... DIFFERENT...
BETTER in every way!
It's a pleasure to present Slifaffrr'i
new Touchdown, for this is the
pen you've always hoped to own.
The easiest pen in the world to
fill, Touchdown also gives you the
• m«ot host-writing satisfaction
you've ever experienced. Truly
new —delightfully different— ,
better by far in every perfectly
performing feature! Touchdown
can't be matched at any price,
yet you can own one lor as little
as $10.00.
