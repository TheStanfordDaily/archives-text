# Frosh Needed To Police Pyre, Increase Fuel
## 
### 
To protect Stanford from more
Cal raids, the pre-Big Game campus
policing by the freshmen will begin
Friday of this week, Dick Hughes,
head sponsor for Encina, announced.
The freshman wings will sign up
this week for policing hours.
Because of the Cal raid last Fri
day night which set fire to the bon
fire fuel, more freshmen than ever
are needed to work on the Oskie
funeral pyre, said the bonfire chair
man, John Daggett. All members of
the class of '53 who are available
are requested to meet Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons at 1:30 in front
of Encina Hall.
Work on the bonfire has steadily
increased in tempo, Daggett contin
ued. The supply of wood and brush
in dried-up Lake Lagunita is in
creasing, and already the draft
trenches have been dug.
Encina freshmen in Wings 2E and
3E were commended for their work
on the Bear incinerator. Wing 2E
was responsible for the digging of
the trenches, and 3E was outstand
ing in their collection of fuel.
Construction in earnest of the an
nual conflagration will begin next
week with the arrival of telephone
poles supplied by the telephone
company. With the poles support
ing the structure, it is planned to be
the largest in the history of Stan
ford.
