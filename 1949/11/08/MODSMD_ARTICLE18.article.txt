# KISSIN' ROCK GONE
## SF Blarney Stone Vanishes 
### Associated Press 
Somebody's stolen the Blarney
Stone!
Or rather, the chip off tbe old
limestone block that was flown from
the Ould Sod to become the most
kissed attraction at St. Mary's Ca
thedral Festival and Bazaar in San
Francisco.
The 15 - pound lapidary wonder,
crimson with lipstick, was reported
missing about midnight Saturday. It
had reposed in a plaster of paris set
ting in the basement auditorium of
the cathedral, where more than a
thousand lips had left, hopeful im
prints on the limestone â€”at 25 cents
for adults and a dime for children.
"Around midnight, when every
body had had a kiss, I went to rub
off the lipstick," reported Jim Cum
mins, custodian of the rock, "and by
golly, it wasn't there!"
The police were inclined to regard
the story with a stony eye, but
Commissioner J. Warnock Walsh,
who inspected the basement prem
ises inch by inch, uncovered nothing
resembling the stone except, the ca
thedral's granite foundations.
Cummins later revealed that he
may have been the victim of a hoax
when he imported the famed hunk
of rock.
