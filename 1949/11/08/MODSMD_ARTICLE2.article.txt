# Lewis Fines Upheld
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” For a second
time, the Supreme Court upheld
today the contempt-of-court fines
with which the government in the
past has cracked down on walkouts
by John L. Lewis' United Mine
Workers.
The action came at a time when
the White House is weighing the
possible use of the same Taft-Hart
ley Act procedure again in an at
tempt to halt the current 49-day-old
work stoppage in soft coal mines.
The court acted indirectly in up
holding $1,420,000 fines imposed on
Lewis and his union as a result of
the 1948 walkout.
