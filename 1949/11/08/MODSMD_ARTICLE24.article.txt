# Dailies Will Sell For Nickel Today; Tags Bring $209
## 
### 
Stanford's annual autumn re
lief drive got underway yester
day with a sale of tags on cam
pus. Today, containers have
been placed at the distribution
points for The Daily in the vari
ous living groups, and students
are asked to deposit a nickel
contribution to the relief drive
as they pick up their papers.
Yesterday, $209.04 was collected
from the sale of tags. Solicitors
pledged a total of $107.50 at a rally
last Thursday, an average of $4.50
per capita.
The goal for the drive is $12,000.
Progress will be represented by an
exhibit to be set up today in front
of the Cellar. Against a background
on which the relief drive motto,
"They Still Need You," has been
painted, six steps have been ar
ranged, each representing $2,000
toward the goal.
Trudy, a doll representing a Euro
pean student, and right now in bare
feet and ragged clothing, has been
placed on the first step. As the fund
nears its goal, Trudy will move up
the steps and become a little more
dressed up in each stage, representing
a move from poverty to a reasonable
standard of living.
Solicitors are now at work collect
ing individual contributions and
pledges in the living groups. Wednes
day dime contributions will be col
lected at dinner. Thursday is service
day, when students will charge dimes
or nickels for every service they per
form for other students, and con
tribute the money to the relief drive.
Friday the YWCA will hold a food
sale, and Saturday night is the annual
student-faculty talent show for the
benefit of the relief drive.
Local, national, and international
functions are all performed by this
drive, the only Stanford dFive cover
ing all three fields.
