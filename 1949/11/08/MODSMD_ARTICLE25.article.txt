Things are looking up for Charles
Moulds, local haberdasher and one
of Stanford's most enthusiastic sup
porters. The Monday following Big
Game may see a considerable in
crease in his volume of necktie sales.
The reason for these improved
prospects can be laid to the Indians'
amazing win Saturday over the Tro
jans of Southern Cal.
Last September, following Stan
ford's one-sided win over San Jose
State, Moulds ordered a large ship
ment of neckties. Three weeks later
UCLA walked over the Indians 14-7
and Moulds was forced to store his
ties away.
"Maybe they'll sell better next
year," he said, but now he doubts
whether he'll have to wait until next
year.
On each necktie is a picture of
Injun Joe driving a little car to the
Rose Bowl.
