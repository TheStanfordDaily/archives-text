# Something More Substantial
## 
### 
Prestige and glory go a long way, but they
don't pay those first-of-the-month bills.
What we'ie driving at is that Stanford's stu
dent body president and vice-president are
among the few such office-holders who re
ceive nothing more substantial than honor for
their hard work.
These executive jobs are practically full
time, and the prexy and veep have trouble
enough trying to get their studying done, so
that making a little spending money becomes
nigh-on-to-impossible.
It's conceivable that only those students who
can afford not to hold a part-time job can afford
to run for the two top student offices.
Stanford, moreover, seems to be one of the
few West Coast universities which hasn't as
yet answered this problem. Cal pays their
president $500 a year, and even little Redlands
gives their $300.
The ASSU president now has at his disposal

a $500 per year expense account, but this goes
only lor such items as trips, etc., which he
must make in line with his duties. He is al
lowed to spend none of the money for per
sonal use.
Furthermore, we compensate many of our
student leaders already. All the publication
heads receive some sort of salary.
The danger, of course, of paying student of
ficers is that people will be attracted to the jobs
for the money alone. We think that to prevent
this the amount should be fairly nominal—
something to help out, but not a huge profit
making deal.
In conclusion, we think that just for an arbi
trary sum, let's say $50 a month for president
and $35 for vice-president, is not too much to
pay these hard-working leaders.
Such an expense could not be budgeted into
the ASSU expenditures this year, but we think
it could be taken care of in the future without
too much strain. —M.K.
