# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
I just got my voice back!
And that's a good thing because I still have a lot of
shouting to do. What a game. What a rooting section.

What a weekend. What a pleasure.
To put it in the Southland's fa
vorite words, the game was fabu
lous. To put it in Rally Corn's
words, the Troy let was flushed. To
put it simply, Stanford was great.
To put it in the books, Stanford 34,
USC 13.
Those who have modestly
skipped over the game as being
just ail important step along the
path to roses should be cuffed
gently over the ear. The game was
a chapter in itself.

It marked the first time since 1!')42 tnat btamord has
beaten the Trojans in football.
It marked the first time since Jefferson Newell Cra
vrilh has fcetn head coach that USC has lost a Con
ference clash by more than one touchdown.
It marked the first time this season that Dean Borba
has dusted ofi' the Axe-Yell.
It marked the first time I ever fainted.
* * •+
The football prowess displayed by the Indians last
Saturday will be enough to keep Jim Reynolds, Dick
Ifyland, and other assorted Los Anyeles alums happy
for many USC games to come.
MuLt important, Stanford won the baligame the hard
way The Cards beal a well prepared USC football
machine. They did it both offensively and defensively
and with the most diversified and powerful attack
demonstrated by a West Coast team this season.

The rooting section was in great form. Thunder
struck when Bob-the-White-Flash took his 76-yard
lump in the second quarter, all the section could do
was ynll.
By the time Bill DeYoung was sprinting his 55-
yarder, the rooters had dug a little deeper. Two gentle
men in front of me had ripped their shirts off their
backs and had tossed them into the air, and some others
had wildly discarded root-caps. I settled for my news
paper, which I didn't like anyway, because some liar
had rated SC's end Hal Hatfield over Indian Ken Rose.
At halftime it was really a wonder that Stanford

came up with any card-stunts at all. Most of the cards
had been knocked off the bottom of the seats during
the second-quarter onslaught, and it was only guess
work as to what went where.
But USC, as usual, was red hot in the circus depart
ment of the contest. They topped everything off with
af routine starring a Trojan Knight, mounted on a
White Horse, charging around the Coliseum track.
It all seemed sort of futile to me, and I'm sure every
body would have been more interested if the White
Horse had been in the bottle where all good White
Horse really belongs.
The second half put Stanford to a real test. USC was
fired up and all out to roar back into the contest. But
the Cards combined two terrific goal-line stands; tre
mendous defensive work by Russ Pomeroy, Ken Peck,
Dave Field, and Gordy Rice; and finally, brilliant run
ning and passing, to completely subdue the futile at
tacks of the Trojans.
One maneuver in particular was typical of the heads
up game Stanford was playing. With a fourth and one
in their own territory, the Cards were expected to
keep legitimate with a punt to keep their lead safe.
But when they broke from the huddle and lined up
in (he regular tee, it. was apparent that they weren't
going to kick. So, the Trojan safety man came running
in full speed to cover the play. That was his mistake,
because Emery Mitchell neatly Lifted a quick-kick
over his head, arid SC was pushed back around its own
10-yard line.
When you can get away with a fourth-down quick
kick when you are leading by 20 points, you have
pulled a last one.
Furthermore, and beyond that, the speed of Bob
White, Bill DeYoung, and Rupe Andrews was dazzling.
The blocking by A) Rau, Ken Rose, Bruce Van Al
styne, Gordy White, and Don Fix was superb. Van
Alstyne came up with the most beautiful block I've
ever seen when he helped clean out a path for De-
Young's six-point touchdown return.
Gary Kerkorian called his finest game, threw his
neatest passes, and helped make the defense what
it was.
Harry Ilugasian was the best runner on the field,
hut what the hell, why go on any more. Like I said
at the beginning, lo put it simply, STANFORD WAS
GREAT.

I just got my voice back!

just ail important step along the
path to roses should be cuffed
gently over the ear. The game was
a chapter in itself.

It marked the first time since 1!')42 tnat btamord has
beaten the Trojans in football.
It marked the first time since Jefferson Newell Cra
vrilh has fcetn head coach that USC has lost a Con
ference clash by more than one touchdown.
It marked the first time this season that Dean Borba
has dusted ofi' the Axe-Yell.
It marked the first time I ever fainted.

The football prowess displayed by the Indians last
Saturday will be enough to keep Jim Reynolds, Dick
Ifyland, and other assorted Los Anyeles alums happy
for many USC games to come.
MuLt important, Stanford won the baligame the hard
way The Cards beal a well prepared USC football
machine. They did it both offensively and defensively
and with the most diversified and powerful attack
demonstrated by a West Coast team this season.

The rooting section was in great form. Thunder
struck when Bob-the-White-Flash took his 76-yard
lump in the second quarter, all the section could do
was ynll.
By the time Bill DeYoung was sprinting his 55-
yarder, the rooters had dug a little deeper. Two gentle
men in front of me had ripped their shirts off their
backs and had tossed them into the air, and some others
had wildly discarded root-caps. I settled for my news
paper, which I didn't like anyway, because some liar
had rated SC's end Hal Hatfield over Indian Ken Rose.
At halftime it was really a wonder that Stanford

came up with any card-stunts at all. Most of the cards
had been knocked off the bottom of the seats during
the second-quarter onslaught, and it was only guess
work as to what went where.
But USC, as usual, was red hot in the circus depart
ment of the contest. They topped everything off with
af routine starring a Trojan Knight, mounted on a
White Horse, charging around the Coliseum track.
It all seemed sort of futile to me, and I'm sure every
body would have been more interested if the White
Horse had been in the bottle where all good White
Horse really belongs.
The second half put Stanford to a real test. USC was
fired up and all out to roar back into the contest. But
the Cards combined two terrific goal-line stands; tre
mendous defensive work by Russ Pomeroy, Ken Peck,
Dave Field, and Gordy Rice; and finally, brilliant run
ning and passing, to completely subdue the futile at
tacks of the Trojans.
One maneuver in particular was typical of the heads
up game Stanford was playing. With a fourth and one
in their own territory, the Cards were expected to
keep legitimate with a punt to keep their lead safe.
But when they broke from the huddle and lined up
in (he regular tee, it. was apparent that they weren't
going to kick. So, the Trojan safety man came running
in full speed to cover the play. That was his mistake,
because Emery Mitchell neatly Lifted a quick-kick
over his head, arid SC was pushed back around its own
10-yard line.
When you can get away with a fourth-down quick
kick when you are leading by 20 points, you have
pulled a last one.
Furthermore, and beyond that, the speed of Bob
White, Bill DeYoung, and Rupe Andrews was dazzling.
The blocking by A) Rau, Ken Rose, Bruce Van Al
styne, Gordy White, and Don Fix was superb. Van
Alstyne came up with the most beautiful block I've
ever seen when he helped clean out a path for De-
Young's six-point touchdown return.
Gary Kerkorian called his finest game, threw his
neatest passes, and helped make the defense what
it was.
Harry Ilugasian was the best runner on the field,
hut what the hell, why go on any more. Like I said
at the beginning, lo put it simply, STANFORD WAS
GREAT.

I just got my voice back!
And that's a good thing because I still have a lot of
shouting to do. What a game. What a rooting section.

What a weekend. What a pleasure.
To put it in the Southland's fa
vorite words, the game was fabu
lous. To put it in Rally Corn's
words, the Troy let was flushed. To
put it simply, Stanford was great.
To put it in the books, Stanford 34,
USC 13.

The football prowess displayed by the Indians last
Saturday will be enough to keep Jim Reynolds, Dick
Ifyland, and other assorted Los Anyeles alums happy
for many USC games to come.
MuLt important, Stanford won the baligame the hard
way The Cards beal a well prepared USC football
machine. They did it both offensively and defensively
and with the most diversified and powerful attack
demonstrated by a West Coast team this season.

The rooting section was in great form. Thunder
struck when Bob-the-White-Flash took his 76-yard
lump in the second quarter, all the section could do
was ynll.
By the time Bill DeYoung was sprinting his 55-
yarder, the rooters had dug a little deeper. Two gentle
men in front of me had ripped their shirts off their
backs and had tossed them into the air, and some others
had wildly discarded root-caps. I settled for my news
paper, which I didn't like anyway, because some liar
had rated SC's end Hal Hatfield over Indian Ken Rose.
At halftime it was really a wonder that Stanford

came up with any card-stunts at all. Most of the cards
had been knocked off the bottom of the seats during
the second-quarter onslaught, and it was only guess
work as to what went where.
But USC, as usual, was red hot in the circus depart
ment of the contest. They topped everything off with
af routine starring a Trojan Knight, mounted on a
White Horse, charging around the Coliseum track.
It all seemed sort of futile to me, and I'm sure every
body would have been more interested if the White
Horse had been in the bottle where all good White
Horse really belongs.
The second half put Stanford to a real test. USC was
fired up and all out to roar back into the contest. But
the Cards combined two terrific goal-line stands; tre
mendous defensive work by Russ Pomeroy, Ken Peck,
Dave Field, and Gordy Rice; and finally, brilliant run
ning and passing, to completely subdue the futile at
tacks of the Trojans.
One maneuver in particular was typical of the heads
up game Stanford was playing. With a fourth and one
in their own territory, the Cards were expected to
keep legitimate with a punt to keep their lead safe.
But when they broke from the huddle and lined up
in (he regular tee, it. was apparent that they weren't
going to kick. So, the Trojan safety man came running
in full speed to cover the play. That was his mistake,
because Emery Mitchell neatly Lifted a quick-kick
over his head, arid SC was pushed back around its own
10-yard line.
When you can get away with a fourth-down quick
kick when you are leading by 20 points, you have
pulled a last one.
Furthermore, and beyond that, the speed of Bob
White, Bill DeYoung, and Rupe Andrews was dazzling.
The blocking by A) Rau, Ken Rose, Bruce Van Al
styne, Gordy White, and Don Fix was superb. Van
Alstyne came up with the most beautiful block I've
ever seen when he helped clean out a path for De-
Young's six-point touchdown return.
Gary Kerkorian called his finest game, threw his
neatest passes, and helped make the defense what
it was.
Harry Ilugasian was the best runner on the field,
hut what the hell, why go on any more. Like I said
at the beginning, lo put it simply, STANFORD WAS
GREAT.

I just got my voice back!
And that's a good thing because I still have a lot of
shouting to do. What a game. What a rooting section.

What a weekend. What a pleasure.
To put it in the Southland's fa
vorite words, the game was fabu
lous. To put it in Rally Corn's
words, the Troy let was flushed. To
put it simply, Stanford was great.
To put it in the books, Stanford 34,
USC 13.
Those who have modestly
skipped over the game as being
just ail important step along the
path to roses should be cuffed
gently over the ear. The game was
a chapter in itself.

It marked the first time since 1!')42 tnat btamord has
beaten the Trojans in football.
It marked the first time since Jefferson Newell Cra
vrilh has fcetn head coach that USC has lost a Con
ference clash by more than one touchdown.
It marked the first time this season that Dean Borba
has dusted ofi' the Axe-Yell.
It marked the first time I ever fainted.
