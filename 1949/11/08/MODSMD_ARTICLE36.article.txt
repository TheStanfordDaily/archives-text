# Cardinals Expands; Add New Committee
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
"Something new lias been added!"
This year that phrase has become
the slogan of Cardinals.
"Cardinals is a service organiza
tion," explained its president, Mick
ey Hefter, "and this quarter we are
trying to expand its services by
giving each member a year-round
job in addition to his other duties."
Under this new plan standing
committees have been created to
take care of services such as the
Activities Agency, campus tours,
football movies, and the enforce
ment of new regulations for the
bulletin boards on Quad.
WORK WITH NSA
Cardinal representatives are also
working with NSA to obtain infor
mation about NSA projects in other
schools, and with the ASSU Activi
ties Reviewing Committee which
formulates social policies and proce
dures.
A publicity committee has been
created to work with chairmen of all
Cardinal-sponsored events in plan
ning and conducting publicity cam
paigns.
"We hope that students will call
on these committees for whatever
help or information they need,"
Hefter said.
MEMBERS LISTED
Students wishing the services of
any of these committees should con
tact a member of Cardinals. Mem
bers this year are: Nan Cornel!, La
gunita; Chuck Getchell, ATO; Jo
Lyons, Roble; Tim Michaud, Sigma
Chi; Joyce Oldham, Manzanita;
Paula Smith, Storey; Pete Slusser,
Alpha Delt; Downing McKee, ATO;
Don Wells, Sigma Chi; and Hefter,
Encina.
Ever since its establishment in
1934 by a new ASSU constitution,
Cardinals has been one of the bus-

I iest organizations on campus. Be
sides supervising the Pre-Reg and
Rally Committees, it is in charge of
Homecoming, Sadie Sawkins, Big
Game festivities, Back to the Farm,
the Red Cross and Con Home drives,
and a $1,000 subsidized all-campus
affair such as the Benny Goodman
dance last winter.
"The purpose of Cardinals," Hef
ter added, "is to work for the bet
terment of the school as a whole by
promoting and co-ordinating cam
.pus affairs, and taking charge of any
functions not handled by other
agencies."
WHO ARE CARDINALS?
Cardinals is composed of ten sen
iors and juniors chosen by outgoing
members and Excom. Selections are
based on previous service, initiative,
and ideas, and appointees must have
a C average.
"It is a mistaken idea that Car
dinals does all the work for the
events it sponsors," Hefter said.
"One of the aims of the organization
is to give students a chance to par
ticipate in school affairs."
The Cardinal office in the Union is
open Monday through Friday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and students are
welcome to attend the regular meet
ings Tuesday at 7:15 p.m.
The oldest known map in the
world was produced about 4.500
years ago. A clay tablet unearthed
in ruins 200 miles north of the site
of Babylon, it is now preserved in
the Semitic museum of Harvard
University.
