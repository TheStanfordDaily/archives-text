## Better Yet Stanford Should Play All Its Games in That Wonderful Coliseum 
### 
1 hereby propose, suggest, urge, recommend, advocate, and ask that all
Stanford home games be played in the Los Angeles Coliseum from this date
on.
No kidding. The Cards come through like the nation's best in that little
playing field. Besides, think of all the fine parties we could have.
I don't really think the powers that be will take to my suggestion, but it
deserves mentioning. Our boys, each one of them .... Southern California
lad or tlot .... seems to play his best down there.
Take Al Rau, for example. I've watched that fellow for three years now
and I can't remember seeing him play better ball. Modern day lootball is
lunny. We watch the offensive ends and backs. They are more or less in
Ibe clear down there and we can see them. Then comes the defensive team.
The P.A. system lets us know, and it is often wrong at that, who makes the
tackle. Guards and tackles come in for their mention on defense.
Offensive Lineman Neglected
lint who sees, 01 pays tribute, to the poor offensive guard or tackle. A
.' lory may say that the Card line opened big holes, etc., but it seldom tells
you who was really good in the line. Why? Because a sports writer usually
doesn't see the offensive line play of the guards and tackles either. The
coaches can see il in the movies on Monday and can rate their players
off that.
I think Ran was the best lineman on the field. It was his blocking while
leading the end runs thai shook the Card backs loose. He was great.
Clordy White is another fellow who isn't getting his due praise. Last year
White played on defense a good deal of the time. We noticed him while he
was making the tackles. This season he is played on offense. We don't see
.' 0 much of him, too many guys between bis block and the ball carrier.

But I'm still wondering about Saturday's game. I still think it was the
best Stanford game I've seen in three years. But the Los Angeles writers
were all wet in their writeups of the game.
One writer went so far as to say, "the Trojans were never in the game,
not al all."
I didn't gel that impression during the third and fourth quarters. They
outplayed us then. In fact, if our defense hadn't held on three goal line
stands, that score would have been turned about a bit. Our pass defense, as
per usual, was not good. That Powers guy is good. Granted. Some of those
passes were right on the button. You don't stop those.
II was only when the Cards were driven down to their 30 or thereabouts
that the pass defense clicked. Remember, Powers personally threw for 290
yards. USC only got 08 more.
And two of bis throws were dropped. They had TD written all over them.
And .... USC ran off 80 plays to Stanford's 74. I don't think that means
l hey were never in the game.
But the Cards did play good ball. That is the point I'm trying to make.
USC was tough and we beat them. Not as soundly as the score might indi
cate. The Trojans got a little panicky in the last quarter and tossed the ball
around too much. Abraham intercepted on the SC 33 and we scored with
one second to go.
SC fullback Bill Martin ranks with Michigan's Dick Kempthorn as a
linebacker in my book.
This was the first game he didn't score in. It was also the first time
Stanford had been scored upon by a pass play.
By the way. The Cards also fumbled four times. That could have hurt.
For those of you who didn't make the trip. The Axe Yell was finally
given. I understand it wasn't heard over the radio. The USC band started
up at the same time.
Jeff C'avath summed up the game rather well when he said, "Stanford
out-rawHUs a little and out-blocked us a little. But we got the hell beat
out of us." He went on to say that Stanford could beat Cal.
Beat Cal, What Then?
And if we beat Cal? Well, it can't be said lor sure that we could get
the Bowl bid. We should, but you never know. UCLA must be beaten.
Why not this week? Washington could do it.
Oregon would do Stanford a favor by dumping Cal at the same time.
It could happen.
Idaho can again prove to be ihe bugaboo. Watch that team.
Those northern schools love to knock over Stanford, USC, Cal, and
UCLA. We tool, it on the chin in 1947. We outgained the Vandals all over
the place, but lost, 19 to 10. Remember?
That win will live forever in the minds of the Idaho boys. A homecoming
• ign later said, "Honest, Folks, We Beat, Stanford!" Dixie Howell was
being boomed for governor of the state after that game.
'J his week's game will be the closing contest for Idaho. A whole sea
on's efforts will be put into this last one. A win over Stanford will just
about make the season for Idaho. A couple of good passes, a long run or
two, several Stanford fumbles at the wrong time, a Stanford puss inter
cepted""." . . . and Idaho wins again. It could happen.

But I'm still wondering about Saturday's game. I still think it was the
best Stanford game I've seen in three years. But the Los Angeles writers
were all wet in their writeups of the game.
One writer went so far as to say, "the Trojans were never in the game,
not al all."
I didn't gel that impression during the third and fourth quarters. They
outplayed us then. In fact, if our defense hadn't held on three goal line
stands, that score would have been turned about a bit. Our pass defense, as
per usual, was not good. That Powers guy is good. Granted. Some of those
passes were right on the button. You don't stop those.
II was only when the Cards were driven down to their 30 or thereabouts
that the pass defense clicked. Remember, Powers personally threw for 290
yards. USC only got 08 more.
And two of bis throws were dropped. They had TD written all over them.
And .... USC ran off 80 plays to Stanford's 74. I don't think that means
l hey were never in the game.
But the Cards did play good ball. That is the point I'm trying to make.
USC was tough and we beat them. Not as soundly as the score might indi
cate. The Trojans got a little panicky in the last quarter and tossed the ball
around too much. Abraham intercepted on the SC 33 and we scored with
one second to go.

But I'm still wondering about Saturday's game. I still think it was the
best Stanford game I've seen in three years. But the Los Angeles writers
were all wet in their writeups of the game.
One writer went so far as to say, "the Trojans were never in the game,
not al all."
I didn't gel that impression during the third and fourth quarters. They
outplayed us then. In fact, if our defense hadn't held on three goal line
stands, that score would have been turned about a bit. Our pass defense, as
per usual, was not good. That Powers guy is good. Granted. Some of those
passes were right on the button. You don't stop those.
II was only when the Cards were driven down to their 30 or thereabouts
that the pass defense clicked. Remember, Powers personally threw for 290
yards. USC only got 08 more.
And two of bis throws were dropped. They had TD written all over them.
And .... USC ran off 80 plays to Stanford's 74. I don't think that means
l hey were never in the game.
But the Cards did play good ball. That is the point I'm trying to make.
USC was tough and we beat them. Not as soundly as the score might indi
cate. The Trojans got a little panicky in the last quarter and tossed the ball
around too much. Abraham intercepted on the SC 33 and we scored with
one second to go.
SC fullback Bill Martin ranks with Michigan's Dick Kempthorn as a
linebacker in my book.
This was the first game he didn't score in. It was also the first time
Stanford had been scored upon by a pass play.
By the way. The Cards also fumbled four times. That could have hurt.
For those of you who didn't make the trip. The Axe Yell was finally
given. I understand it wasn't heard over the radio. The USC band started
up at the same time.
Jeff C'avath summed up the game rather well when he said, "Stanford
out-rawHUs a little and out-blocked us a little. But we got the hell beat
out of us." He went on to say that Stanford could beat Cal.
Beat Cal, What Then?
And if we beat Cal? Well, it can't be said lor sure that we could get
the Bowl bid. We should, but you never know. UCLA must be beaten.
Why not this week? Washington could do it.
Oregon would do Stanford a favor by dumping Cal at the same time.
It could happen.
Idaho can again prove to be ihe bugaboo. Watch that team.
Those northern schools love to knock over Stanford, USC, Cal, and
UCLA. We tool, it on the chin in 1947. We outgained the Vandals all over
the place, but lost, 19 to 10. Remember?
