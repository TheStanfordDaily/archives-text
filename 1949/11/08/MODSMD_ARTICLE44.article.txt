# Vandals Remember Upset Win Over Stanford in 1947
## Northerners Vie For Fourth Win 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
There's only a small obstruction
lying in the path of the Red Ma
chine this week on its trek clown the
Rose Bowl road.
But as anyone knows, even a
small nail can cause a flat.
Dixie Howell's Idaho Vandals, a
team that has won by as much as
79 to 0 (against Willamette) and
lost by as much a:> 7 to 56 (against
Texas), will arrive in these parts
this weekend with a two-year-old
memory uppermost in their minds.
It's the remembrance of a 19 to 16
victory oer the same Indians in the
1947 opener.
That was an upset, too, although
the Cards eventually proved that it
wasn't too much of an upset by
dropping every game on their sea
son's schedule.
The boys from south of the Pan
handle have won three and dropped
four so far this year. Like so many
football teams, sometimes they play
good, sometimes they play bad.
They started out the year playing
good against some rather poor com-

petition. That was the Willamette
massacre, in which Idaho grabbed a
halftime lead of 38 to 0, then calm
ly added 41 points in the fourth
quarter for the amazing total of 79.
For the next three weeks, the
Vandals found themselves on the
receiving end of some bloody do
ings, as Oregon set them down 41
to 0, Texas romped by the afore
mentioned 5G to 7, and Washington
State outclassed their cross-border
neighbors 35 to 13.
Following that one, Idaho put to
gether a two-game win streak by
walloping Montana 47 to 19 and
Portland 49 to 21.
Then, just last Saturday while
Stanford was celebrating USC's
homecoming in the Coliseum, they
were outclassed by Oregon State 35
to 25.
They almost upset the Beavers at
Moscow by grabbing an early 12 to
0 lead, but Ken Carpenter proved
the difference as OSC pulled away
in later moments.
The Vandals' offensive punch de
pends primarily upon a superb
corps of speedy halfbacks, all of
whom can either run or pass the
pellet with equal efficiency.
Their fleet fivesome consists of
Bob Mays, Jerry Diehl, Jim Hatch,
Johnny Brogan, and Glenn Chris
tianâ€”all halfbacks, and all lovers of
the long breakaway run.
Mays, for example, scored twice
against Portland on 45- and G3-yard
jaunts.
Hatch trotted 71 for another score

against Portland.
Diehl went 53 yards against Mon
tana.
Christianson hoofed it 02 yards
into Willamette's end zone.
Brogan's longest isn't as spectacu
lar as his mates'; but he did rack up
a 25-yard six-pointer against Port
land.
