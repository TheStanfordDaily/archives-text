The "experts" have noticed us,
men.
Stanford is now the 17th best col
lege football team in the nation, ac
cording to the weekly Associated
Press poll of those who are supposed
to know.
The reason for the sudden jump
from oblivion to national ranking is,
of course, last Saturday's Coliseum
barbecue in which the Indians
roasted and devoured a Trojan
horse that had occupied the 12th
stable the week before.
There were no major shakeups in
the ratings, with Notre Dame still
way out in front on 137 of the 161
first-place votes. That amounts to
roughly 84 per cent of the ballots,
about the same as it has been run
ning for weeks. The Irish took over
the lead from Michigan on the sec
ond week of the pool, and opened
up a wide gap in the third week.
