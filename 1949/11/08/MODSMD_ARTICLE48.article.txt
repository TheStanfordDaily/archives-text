A DU PONT PROCESS CONVERTS
FURFURAL INTO A CHEMICAL
FOR MAKING NYLON
One of the fascinating tilings about
nylon is the unlikely sounding raw
materials that go into it. Popu
larly, nylon is said to be made from
coal, air and water. This is because
originally, in developing its chemi
cal intermediates, chemists used ben
zene (from coal), ammonia (from air
and water), and oxygen (from air).
But Du Pont is always looking for
new ways of doing things. After the
discovery of nylon in 1934, research
men immediately began looking for
alternative ways of making the two
main intermediates —adipic acid and
hexamethylenediamine. In 1935,
when nylon was still in the labora
tory" stage and three years before its
commercial debut, they started work
on the possibility of using furfural
in the process.

Furfural has been used in the chem
ical industry for 25 years, but it is
little known to the layman. A tan
colored liquid with a faint bitter
almond odor, it is made from a wide
variety of agricultural by-products.
Among these are corncobs and hulls
of cottonseed, oats, rice—all available
in practically unlimited quantities
from America's farms.

14 Years of Research
and Development
It seems a far cry from corncobs to
nylon, and it was. The development
from the first small-scale laboratory
experiments to the present full-scale
plant cost 14 years of time and about
five million dollars. But it enabled
chemists to produce large quantities
of adiponitrile, the compound from
which hexamethylenediamine is
made, by an economical process
which uses natural materials that
are in continuous supply.
In the new process, furfural isco?i
verted by a series of steps to 1,4-di
chlorobutane. The next step explains
in part why Du Pont undertook the
project in the first, place. As pro
ducers of cyanides, they had sodium

cyanide available for converting the
1,4-dichlorobutane into adiponitrile.
The final product, hexamethylene
diamine, is then reacted with adipic
acid to make nylon "salt." Still more
processing and the salt becomes yarn,
and the nylon flake used by the
plastics industry.
Opportunities at Du Pont
In many scientific fields
This is an excellent example of the
interesting work in industrial organic
chemistry carried on at Du Pont. It
required the technical knowledge and
skill of highly trained research and
development men, including organic
and physical chemists; chemical, me
chanical, civil and electrical engi
neers, and others.
Only a large company with ample
resources in men and money could
afford to engage in research of such
magnitude. To the young college
graduate, Du Pont offers the broad
est of opportunities in many scientific
fields, along with the advantages of
working directly with a small group
of associates.
Keynote of Du Pont personnel
policy is promotion from within on
a competitive merit basis. A con
scientious effort is made not only
to choose college-trained people of
promise, but to develop each indi
vidual as rapidly as possible.
