# Prof Tells of Brazil Tour
## 
### BOB RIGNEY 
From G,(>oo miles southeast of Palo
Alto in another United States, the
United States of Brazil, Professor
John J. Johnson of the History De
partment has recently returned after
five months of travel and study.
Professor Johnson has been doing
research on transportation as a factor
in regionalism, and traveling in
large parts of The Brazil which fig
ures in world affairs. He was more
than ever impressed with the fact
that there is not one Brazil, but many
Brazils.
There is the highly provincial Rio
Grande do Sul which progresses
slowly, the northeast area which
languishes due to transportation and
health problems, and the Parana re
gion which is moving rapidly ahead
jn agriculture and education.
Alii TRANSPORTATION
Air transportation has been par
ticularly emphasized to connect those
various parts of Brazil. But Proles
tor Johnson feels that Brazil's trans
portation problem has been greatly

overemphasized and that she has put
too much in air transportation at the
expense of roads and railroads.
Rio de Janeiro, though one; of the
most beautiful cities of the world,
leaves much to be desired. The cyni
cism of the inhabitants, the lack of

sustained effort, and the general feel
ing of superiority seem to result in
the city's failure to assume its full
burden of responsibilities.
The paternalistic labor practices of
several decades ago seem to be re
vived in Sao Paulo where the indus
trialists attempt merely to appease
the laborer rather than make him a
responsible member of society. How
ever, the Paulistas take great pride
in the fact that their state supplies
two-thirds of the national revenues.
NEXT PRESIDENT
When Professor Johnson left,
everyone was wondering who would
win the presidency of this highly
centralized country in the coming
elections. Although no one was sure,
the name most commonly mentioned
was that of Ademar Barros, an able
politician if nothing else.
Although Brazil has numerous
problems, compared to the rest of
Latin America she has great poten
tials. Her progress during the next
few years will be determined in part
by the developments in neighboring
countries and world trade, but
mostly by the will of her people and
their ability to work for the com
mon interest, Dr. Johnson said.
Professor Johnson has also in the
past received several fellowships to
travel in the U.S. and South America.
As a result of these studies, he has
published the book, "Pioneer Teleg
raphy in Chile," and several maga
zine articles.
