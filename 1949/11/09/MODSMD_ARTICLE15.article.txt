## Lehman Defeats Dulles; Proposition No. 2 Leads 
### Associated Press 
NEW YORK, Nov. 8 (AP) —A tide of Democratic votes swept
Herbert H. Lehman into the U.S. Senate and re-elected William
O'Dwyer mayor, retaining the party's control of the nation's
largest city tonight.
Lehman, four times Governor of New York nd a strong sup-

porter of President Truman's "FaiH
Deal," had a margin of over 235,000
votes over Republican Senator John
Foster Dulles. The Lehman-Dulles
fight attracted wide national inter
est as the first major test of the
"Fair Deal" since the 1948 Presiden
tial election.
Fifty-nine-year-old O'Dwyer, the
Irish-born cop who rose to be mayor
of the nation's largest city, won an
easy re-election over Newbold Mor
ris, Republican-Liberal-Fusion, who
conceded defeat, and Communist
backed Representative Vito Marcan
tonio after one of the rowdiest New
York City campaigns in years.
Marcantonio, running under the
banner of the left-wing American
Labor Party, placed a bad third.
The Democratic sweep was a blow
for Republican Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey, who had urged Morris' elec
tion and had campaigned hard for
Dulles.

Late returns last night showed
California's Proposition No. 2 having
a good chance of being passed, as
"yes" votes on the welfare revision
initiative totaling 475,256 votes to
392,652 against out of 6,557 precincts.
In San Francisco, John F. Shelley,
California State Federation of La
bor president and a Democrat,
seemed assured of election in the
Fifth Congressional District to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of
Republican Richard J. Welch.
New Jersey voters re-elected Gov.
Alfred E. Driscoll, Republican, over
Democrat Elmer H. Wcnc, a Hague
defeat.
In Texas, special election returns
showed the defeat of proposed
amendments to repeal the poll tax,
provide annual legislative sessions,
and allow women to serve on juries.
In California, the school bonds
proposition, daylight saving time,
and the boost in state legislators'
pay also seemed to be getting the
nod.
