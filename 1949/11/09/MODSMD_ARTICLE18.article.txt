dent of Phi Delta Phi, will be at
tended by the Law School faculty,
members of the student body, and
other interested persons.
Mrs. Douglas will be introduced
by Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the Law

the fraternity to limit her lecture to
one hour without a question period.
She will discuss her experiences
in Congress where she was a mem

When she was there she attempted
to find a workable solution to this
critical problem of the Colorado
River water supply.

L'Omelette which will be attended
by members of the law faculty.
