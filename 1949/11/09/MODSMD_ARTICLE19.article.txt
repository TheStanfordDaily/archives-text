# Home Trend Is Easeâ€”Neutra
## 
### 
The modern architect's effort to de
velop a self-service, chore-free home
is symbolic of the whole trend of
contemporary architecture.
This was the professional opinion
voiced by internationally-famous ar
chitect Richard J. Neutra at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture. He spoke in Memorial Audi
torium to an audience of more than
a thousand.
"Architectural trends arc being
conditioned by our rapidly changing
way of life," declared Neutra. "The
general disappearance of domestic
service, for instance, has resulted in
a need for informal and convenient
homes."
Other changes have resulted from
the ever-increasing complexity of
modern-day living he said.
"Today we arc surrounded by
mixed terms, attitudes, and prac
tices," Mr. Neutra explained, "and
there is a great need for compre
hensive planning in the confused
world we are living in. It is the duty
of the architect to design both for the
order of the world and the happiness
of the individual."
At the start of his talk, Mr. Neutra
paid an architect s trioute to tue
Stanford campus.
"It is one of the loveliest planes I
have ever been,"he said, "and I have
traveled seven times around the
world."
