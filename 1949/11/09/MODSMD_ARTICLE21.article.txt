Charges of illegal electioneering
were brought today against Rex D.
Johnson, a candidate for the Gradu
ate Excom seat. Another candidate
had protested that handbills bearing
his name had appeared in the Cub
berley Education Building and in the
Business School, contrary to election
regulations in the ASSU Constitution.
The Election Judgment Board,
composed of Election Board Chair
man Cliff Carlsen, men's halls Excom
representative Gregg Bemis, and
member of Women's council Marilyn
Lewis, immediately held a hearing cn

entirely legal procedure, but that he

was totally unaware of the illegal
distribution. The Board, in a 2 to 1
vote, held that he was guilty of illegal
electioneering, on the grounds that a
candidate is fully responsible for his
campaign, whether it is conducted in
its entirety with his knowledge and
consent or not.
The Board declined to assign any
punishment to Johnson. The consti
tution gives them power only to dis
qualify a candidate, but not to mete
out any lesser punishment. The
Board felt that such a penalty was
not justified, since this is the first
election to be conducted under the
new rule, and since the violation was
held to be not deliberate.
The Board called for a review by
Excom of the by-law in question be
fore it should take further action in
the case.
Election Board advises all students
who wish to vote for a write-in can
didate to mark an "X" in the square
opposite the candidate's name to
avoid invalidating the ballot.
