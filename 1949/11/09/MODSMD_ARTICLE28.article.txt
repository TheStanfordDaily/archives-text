Stanford's lower division curriculum, sub
stantially unchanged since 1920, has come in
for its share of criticism.
Some students have pronounced it too gen
eral with "nothing you can get your teeth
into," while others have criticized it on the
grounds that it isn't broad enough.
We don't know which side, if either, is right.
But then, neither does anyone else.
The Faculty Committee on Lower Division is
working on the problem, however, and that's
why all juniors are being required to take the
Grandate Record Examination on November
22 and 23.
The idea is that juniors who have just fin
ished lower division work should be in the
best position to indicate how much value their
first two years of college work has been to
them. luniors who completed their first two
years elsewhere will also be included in the
Exam but this factor will be weighed in the
evaluation of the results.
The faculty committee, working with an
ASSU committee on curriculum, hopes to find
out just how much students retain of required
courses like biology and foreign languages;
what good, if any, engineering students get
from their study in lower division social sci
ence courses; whether former Western Civ
students know more about the history of civ
ilization than do students attending other uni
versities.
Ey employing IBM machines the committee
will be able to compare the scores of Stanford
students as to sex, age, major field of study,
scores on the General Aptitude Test, the
amount of work taken in a particular depart
ment, and in dozens of other ways. The norms

of scores made at other universities are also
available for comparison as are the national
norms.
In short, the results of this test should give
the Committee on Lower Division just about all
the information it needs for any contemplated
overhauling of curriculum.
That's why it's so important that all juniors
at Stanford take the tests. Anything less than
complete participation will give an undepend
able sample which might lead to erroneous
conclusions.
Scores of the tests will be treated as confi
dential but each student will be allowed to
see his marks and compare them to the Stan
ford, the regional, and the national averages.
The tests should be of great aid to the indi
vidual in telling which fields he is weak in.
The exam thus affords each junior an oppor
tunity for personal evaluation also.
Scores will be on fUe at the national office
of the Educational Testing Service in New
York, and at the student's option will be for
warded to any graduate school of his choice.
The results will not be entered in Stanford rec
ords or have any influence on future grades
or recommendations.
If you do not expect to continue formal study
after graduation your test record will prove a
helpful answer to the vague guestion, "What
did I learn in college?" If you are a senior
who expects to pursue graduate or profes
sional study, your record will reveal your
status with respect to those with whom you
will compete in the graduate school and in the
various professions.
This service ordinarily costs $10. You get it
for nothing.
