# Karras Leads Big Nine Ball Carriers
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 8 f/P) â€” Johnny
Karras, perhaps Illinois' most sensa
tional halfback since Red Grange,
can set a new Big Ten Individual
ground-gaining record by smashing
46 yards against Ohio State Satur
day.
The slashing, power - running
sophomore has averaged almost 125
yards rushing in five league games.
So his chances of cracking the 1944
record of t!G9 yards by Ohio State's
Les Horvath seem sure-fire.
Not only has Karras with his 624-
yard aggregate become the fifth
back in modern conference history
to gain over GOO yards in a single
league season, but his per-carry av
erage of 7.6 yards in 82 attempts
tops that of any recent ball-toting
star.
