## Midweek Musings 
### 
I'm almost afraid to relate this story, afraid that it might hex us.
But it's far too interesting to keep to myself.
It's the story of the 1935 Stanford football team, a team whose gridiron
fortunes so closely resemble those of the Marchiemen of this year.as to ren
der the tale almost unbelievable.
And the best part is that my story has a rosy ending.
The Grayson-led Vow Boys of 1935 thought they had the makings of a
Rose Bowl team when the season opened. And their optimism seemed justi
fied when they rolled up the curtain with an impressive shutout romp over-
San Jose State.
They started slow in that game, then snowed the Spartans under with a
flurry of fourth-quarter scores. Just like the Marchiemen.
Dropped One to Bruins
They opened their Conference season at home a few weeks later against
a definitely underdog UCLA squad. The Westwooders won, and the Rose
Bowl gleam was dimmed. Just like the Marchiemen.
The Monday following the losing UCLA battle, the Stanford Daily sports
staff, following the lead of big brother newspapers in the region, pointed out
that although the Bruins had won on the scoreboard they were soundly
thrashed in the matter of statistics.
For those Cardinals of 1935 outgained the Bruins by more than 100 yards
and nearly tripled the southerners' first down production. Just like the
Marchiemen.
Stanford bounced back after that defeat. They traveled to Seattle and shut
out the Huskies, and they licked USC in the Coliseum. Just like the Marchie
men.
In fact, when Big Came time rolled around, they hadn't lost another Con
ference game. Just like the Marchiemen.
(]«1 Undefeated
They played the Big Game on the Farm that year, as the Marchiemen will
do 10 days hence. And they played a California team that hadn't been beaten
all season, one that was leading the Conference and was favored to make the
Pasadena trek. Just like the Marchiemen.
Stanford won the 1935 Big Game. They won it decisively by 13 to 0. That
left the Indians and Bears all tied up for the Coast title. But Stanford felt
it deserved the Rose Bowl bid, and the Conference officials did too.
Vow Boys Invited
On the Monday following the Big Game, the Vow Boys were invited to
participate in that season's Pasadena spectacle.
Just like the Marchiemen?

Now that we've taken a possible peek into the future, let's wander back
into the past, back once again to that beautiful sunny day in Los Angeles.
Back to last Saturday.
Reams and reams of copy concerning the Coliseum clambake have been
edited, and devoured by a hungry Stanford student body, so I won't dwell on
the subject. Just two short items.
To the L.A. sportscribe who wrote that Stanford nearly pushed the Tro
jans out of the stadium in the third quarter and then finished the job in the
last period: Take a look at the second half statistics. You'll find that USC
outgained the Indians 252 yards to 127 in the final two heats.
To almost anyone: The statistics reveal another interesting, if unimportant,
fact. Troy was penalized a total of one yard during the entire contest. Their
only penalty, for an offside infraction, came at a time when the Marchiemen
were in possession on the Figueroans' two-yard line, just prior to Stanford's
fourth touchdown.

Pasadena trek. Just like the Marchiemen.
Stanford won the 1935 Big Game. They won it decisively by 13 to 0. That
left the Indians and Bears all tied up for the Coast title. But Stanford felt
it deserved the Rose Bowl bid, and the Conference officials did too.
Vow Boys Invited
On the Monday following the Big Game, the Vow Boys were invited to
participate in that season's Pasadena spectacle.

Now that we've taken a possible peek into the future, let's wander back
into the past, back once again to that beautiful sunny day in Los Angeles.
Back to last Saturday.
Reams and reams of copy concerning the Coliseum clambake have been
edited, and devoured by a hungry Stanford student body, so I won't dwell on
the subject. Just two short items.
To the L.A. sportscribe who wrote that Stanford nearly pushed the Tro
jans out of the stadium in the third quarter and then finished the job in the
last period: Take a look at the second half statistics. You'll find that USC
outgained the Indians 252 yards to 127 in the final two heats.
To almost anyone: The statistics reveal another interesting, if unimportant,
fact. Troy was penalized a total of one yard during the entire contest. Their
only penalty, for an offside infraction, came at a time when the Marchiemen
were in possession on the Figueroans' two-yard line, just prior to Stanford's
fourth touchdown.
I'm almost afraid to relate this story, afraid that it might hex us.
But it's far too interesting to keep to myself.
It's the story of the 1935 Stanford football team, a team whose gridiron
fortunes so closely resemble those of the Marchiemen of this year.as to ren
der the tale almost unbelievable.
And the best part is that my story has a rosy ending.
The Grayson-led Vow Boys of 1935 thought they had the makings of a
Rose Bowl team when the season opened. And their optimism seemed justi
fied when they rolled up the curtain with an impressive shutout romp over-
San Jose State.
They started slow in that game, then snowed the Spartans under with a
flurry of fourth-quarter scores. Just like the Marchiemen.
Dropped One to Bruins
They opened their Conference season at home a few weeks later against
a definitely underdog UCLA squad. The Westwooders won, and the Rose
Bowl gleam was dimmed. Just like the Marchiemen.
The Monday following the losing UCLA battle, the Stanford Daily sports
staff, following the lead of big brother newspapers in the region, pointed out
that although the Bruins had won on the scoreboard they were soundly
thrashed in the matter of statistics.
For those Cardinals of 1935 outgained the Bruins by more than 100 yards
and nearly tripled the southerners' first down production. Just like the
Marchiemen.
Stanford bounced back after that defeat. They traveled to Seattle and shut
out the Huskies, and they licked USC in the Coliseum. Just like the Marchie
men.
In fact, when Big Came time rolled around, they hadn't lost another Con
ference game. Just like the Marchiemen.
(]«1 Undefeated
They played the Big Game on the Farm that year, as the Marchiemen will
do 10 days hence. And they played a California team that hadn't been beaten
all season, one that was leading the Conference and was favored to make the
Pasadena trek. Just like the Marchiemen.
