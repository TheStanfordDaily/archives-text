# Gridders Prepare For Idaho Contest
## 
### 
Only eight practice sessions re
main on the schedule of the Stan
ford football team after yesterday's
light workout â€” three more this
week and five next week.
Coach#Marchie Schwartz gave his
charges a turn at dummy scrim
mage, line work, running drills, and
then called it a day.
Jack Rye was the only regular
missing from the drills but the lat
est word is that the ace defensive
end will be ready for the California
game. Earlier it was feared that his
knee injury would sideline him for
the rest of the season.
Statistics released by the PCC of
fice yesterday showed Emery Mitch
ell leading the confernece punters
with a 40.9 average. Ken Rose and
Bill McColl rate fourth and seventh
respectively in the pass-catching de
partment.
Rose has caught 21 passes for 253
yards and McColl has 17 catches for
192 yards.
Gary Kerkorian dropped from
fourth to fifth place in the passing
section. His average is now .523,
24 points below his average last
week. He has completed 46 out of
88 tries with 10 interceptions.
The Cards still have no repre
sentatives in the total offense and
rushing offense departments. Jim
Powers of USC leads Bob Celeri of
California in the former with 1,144
to 1,052 yards.
