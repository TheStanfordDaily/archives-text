# Students Present Weekly Service

The weekly Candlelight Service
will be held tonight in Memorial
Church from 9 to 9:30 p.m.
The informal devotional consists
of prayer, meditation, and organ
music. Students read the lessons,
say the prayers, and light the can
dles.
Students interested in taking part
in the service should contact Ron
Handel, chairman of the Candlelight
Service committee, at the Zeta Psi
house.
