# Branner Tops Relief Drive Goal
## 
### 
Stanford's fall relief drive
swings into its third day today.
Yesterday, solicitors turned in
$208.96, and $33.58 was col
lected through the "nickel
Daily" scheme. Both these to
tals are incomplete, Anna Kutz,
chairman of solicitation, added.
Branner Hall is the first group to
go 100 per cent. All of the 183 girls
in Branner have now contributed to
the drive.
Today, students will be asked to
pay a dime for their dinner. So
licitors will collect contributions for
the drive in the living group dining
halls.
FOUR MORE DAYS
"There are only four days left to
bring the funds up to the $12,000
goal," said Pat Terry, co-chairman of
the Stanford International Relief Or

ganization. She urged erch student to
contribute or pledge whatever he
feels to be his share, and asked so
licitors to turn in their monpy each
day as they collect it.
Tomorrow service day activities
will benefit the drive, and tomorrow
j night at 9 p.m. SIRO will present a
j half-hour variety show over KZSU,
entitled "Relief from Stanford."
Friday, the YWCA will sell food,
the proceeds to go to the relief drive,
and Saturday night's studcnt-faculty
talent show is for the benefit of the
drive.
SIXTY PER CENT OVERSEAS
Sixty pe cent of the funds collected
will be divided among three inter
national relief agencies — the World
Student Service Fund, which aids
students and professors in Europe
and Asia; the UN Appeal for Chil
dren; and the Stanford Educational
Rehabilitation Fund, which is ad
ministered by the Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization, and gives
aid to the University of Naples and
the Free University of Berlin, link

j ing Stanford personally with students
I throughout the world.
The Palo Alto-Stanford Commu
nity Youth Fund, the equivalent of
the Community Chest in this area, re
ceives 30 per cent of the funds. The
other 10 per cent goes to the ASSU
Floating Fund, out of which the
ASSU contributes to such drives as
the polio and cancer campaigns. This
j fund eliminates the need for campus
solicitations for such charities.


"THEY STILL NEED YOU," the theme of the Stanford Relief Fund Drive, is aptly illustrated in
the Bookstore window display. The drive, now in its third day, will provide money for needy
children both at home and abroad, the World Student Service Fund and other charity funds.
