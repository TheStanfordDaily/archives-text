# Offer Help— For a Price!
## 
### 
The whole Stanford student body
is asked to turn mercenary tomor
row—for the benefit of the fall re
lief drive.
Anna Kutz, chairman of solicita
tion for the relief drive, suggests
that no student do any service free,
but charge a fee for every favor, to
be contributed to the drive.
For giving a ride to the Quad, a
five - cent charge is sugested; to
Paly, 10 cents. For lending a car,
a 25-cent rental could be charged.
Other services suggested arc:
carrying books, five cents; lending
an article of clothing, five cents; for
doing laundry, Paly prices; haircut,
25 cents.
Note copying would be worth 10
cents. Each item of food a student
gives away could bring in five cents.
Other services are waking up, five
cents; making beds, five cents each;
cleaning shoes, five cents—if they're
dirty, especially saddles, 10 cents.
Anything else that could bring in
money for the drive, even if it's not
on this list, is all right, too, Miss
Kutz added.
