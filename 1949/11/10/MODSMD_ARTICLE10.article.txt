# Vets' Checks Due by Dec. 5
## 
### 
Veterans al Stanford who arc won
dering when their subsistence checks
will arrive can count on receiving
their payments by December 5.
According to information received
by Walter J. Findeisen of the Office
of Veterans' Co-ordinator at Stanford
from the Veterans Administration
regional office in San Francisco, five
per cent of Stanford veterans were
paid by November 5, another 35 per
cent will receive subsistence checks
by November 20, and another 55 per
cent by December 5.
After a veteran receives his first
check, he can count on receiving sub
sistence payments regularly at the
first of each month while he is en
rolled during the school year, ac
cording to the Veterans Office.
The delay in payment at the be
ginning of fall quarter results from
the jamming of Veterans Offices with
records of thousands of students ap
plying for subsistence from colleges
and universities in the area.
A few checks will l>e delayed longer
than December 5 because of the flood
of applications in the San Francisco
office, and becausc some veterans de
layed transferring their records to
San Francisco.
