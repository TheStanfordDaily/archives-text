# Purse Lifter Robs Students
## 
### 
A purse-snatcher, working in the j
early evening, has robbed two Stan- j
ford students in the past three days. !
A 8 p.m. Tuesday a man grabbed a
purse from a girl walking in front of
the Oaks residence. Neither she nor
three other girls present could give
h description of the thief.
Monday evening at about the same
time a man jumped from the bushes
on the Roble driveway and snatched
a purse from one of two girls walk
ing on the sidewalk.
Folice Chief Gordon Davis said
that because of the swiftness of the j
robberies and the darkness, no de- \
.sci iplion of the thief was available.
