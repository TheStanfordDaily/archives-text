# Lewis Stops Strike
## 
### 
JOHN L. LEWIS dramatically
callcd time out in the soft coal
strike today during the 52nd day
of the stoppage.
His order, directing 380,000 idle
bituminous miners to resume bi
tuminous production at once—until
November 30—struck a highly opti
mistic note in the s'owing hum of
the nation's economy.
Lewis said the reasons for the sur
prise move were "public conven
ience" and "to enhance the remote
possibility of an agreement being
reached" between the UMW and
coal operators.
