## Study Lags As Blackout Hits Farm 
### 
London has nothing on us! A
full-scale blackout was lowered on
approximately half of the campus
last night between 6:30 and 8 p.m.,
much to the distress of students
studying for mid-terms.
Lights went off in most of the
residences on the Row for a few
minutes, and some of the big dorms
fared worse.
The lights were out at Encina for
an hour and a half, a cause for
much merriment according to reli
able reports.
At Roble last night the girls were
in the midst of their quarterly
birthday dinner when the lights
went out. The result, dinner by
flashlight! Lagunita fared the same
as Roble, and one particularly ea
ger Lagunitaite sought shelter in the
offices of The Stanford Daily, the
only place she could find a light to
study by.
The reason for the lack of power
lay in a single short-circuit on one
of the poles outside of the Chemistry
Building. By 7:45 full service was
restored.
