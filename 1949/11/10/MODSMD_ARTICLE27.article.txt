# Spaeth Out-Raced By Berkeley Prof
## 
### 
Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the Stan
ford Law School knows what it feels
like to hitchhike.
It was reported in the Fresno Bee
recently that the car in which the
Stanford dean was driving to a pub
lic appearancc at Fresno State Col
lege broke down, and he and his
companion, Dr. R. Gordon Agnew of
the University of California Medical
Center, had to thumb a ride from
Kerman to Fresno.
When Cal's Dr. Agnew outsprinted
him by at least 15 yards running to
the car which stopped to give them
a lift, Dean Spaeth remarked:
"I hope that is not prophetic of a
certain event that comes up soon"
(the Big Gamp).
