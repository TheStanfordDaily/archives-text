# Some Call It 'Borrowing'
## 
### 
This business of "bike borrowing" seems to
be turning into a Stanford tradition. Not ex
actly the kind of worthwhile tradition you'd
expect to find on a ifniversity campus, either,
where we're all supposed to be fair examples
of the "reasonable man" they talk about in
lav/ courses.
Somehow it seems reasonable to us that a
student should be able to park his bike and,
after class or the next morning, find it where
he left it.
Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Every day
Chief Davis gets two or three reports of bikes
that have been "borrowed" and not returned,
the Campus Bike Shop hears the same old
story, and countless other bikes are found by
their owners in obscure corners of the campus
after prolonged searching.
Most of the "borrowing" occurs in the Quad
vicinity, particularly in front of the Library,
it seems that students are just too tired or hur
riod to walk, so they appropriate the nearest
means of transportation, a bike. It doesn't mat
ter whose bike. And of course it's expendable
once they get where they're going. Often
' borrowed" bikes are found at the end of Palm
Drive. The far end.
Over 400 Stanford students use bikes. Their
activities are often scheduled according to
i. ike-time, not foot time. A lot of them are busy
. . . . they have to get around in a hurry.

And none of them have time to spend hours
looking for stolen property.
There are two solutions to the problem, both
practical. One has to do with bicycle locks,
which sell for as little as 35 cents. It is a fact
that the "borrowed" bikes are always un
locked.
The other has to do with an old saying that
goes "Honesty is the best policy." Or was it
"Do unto others . . . ."? Remember? —J.L.
