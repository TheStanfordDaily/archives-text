# A 						Cal Rooter Speaks

The following gem appeared Monday in the
Letters to the Editor column of the Daily Cali
fornian, a tabloid throwaway published for the
20,000 students who get their schooling in
Strawberry Canyon:
"To the Editor:
"This may be a bit premature, but (get away,
Pappy) may we suggest that George Briggs
and the ticket staff make some sort of plan for
efficient distribution of Rose Bowl tickets now.
"Let's not wait 'til too late again. We can at
least be ready with some sort of system that
doesn't reguire our presence in a line for 12
hours.
"How about utilizing the tickets booths at
Memorial Stadium to divide up the crowd, or
handle the whole thing by mail?"
Sounds like a good plan. Let Cal have the
system. We'll distribute the tickets.
