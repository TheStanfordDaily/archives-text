# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
This morning's Session really should have a special
title. Something such as "The Crazy Card Caper" or
he Case of the Reappearing Post Card" or if you pre
fer something conservative, "Who Done It?"

it all started on a dark, stormy
i iternoon just about two years ago
today. A few of us were sitting
around the copy desk here at the
D;;ily Shack, quietly sipping coke
arid water, and waiting for some
thing to break.
One o! the two sports reporters
w;i singing '"I he Gypsy" as that
Vi'!- before "Mule Train" saw life,
. nd the rest of us were trying to
t!i nk of mean things to say about a
California football player named
Jack Jenst n.

Well, to make a short story a little longer as is often
>'■ ne here at The Daily, the postman (who actually
<k < n't always ring twice), came by and delivered us a
112 , t ard very similar to the one pictured above.
S lid postcard was full of abuse for The Stanford
I 11 y"• attitude toward said Jensen. It was really quite
f'liiny, and we all laughed a short ha-ha, and pinned
it to the wall wheie everybody could read it and also
lau <h a short ha-ha. We figured that would be all
t lie re was to it. But we were wrong.
Because the damn postcards have become a steady
I here at the Shack. About every other week for
two years now they have shown up as regular as a Sal
Hepatica user.
They always contain complaints concerning the
''t.-.nford rooting section and spirit, and are full of half-
I'.ted ob:,( i vations such as "It would have done the
112 ; .nford squad and adherents good to hear the Bears
student.* and large body of rooters really show sincere
jubilation upon learning the progress and result of

Stanford's victory over Southern California Saturday.
The democratic skillful Chuck Taylor was grand and
happy to see 10,(J00 pro and con rooters in Memorial
Stadium at 11 o'clock—the Stanford Freshmen was
surprised and delighted different story at Palo Alto
2.A) souls watched the San Jose State Freshmen play
thanks to the lazy dormitory lounge-lizards of Stan
ford. Blast the slovenly, sleepy ingrates "
(This quote was taken from the latest card which
arrived yesterday. The card pictured above arrived a
week ago yesterday.)
I wouldn't bother you with all this prattle, except
that 1 have taken it upon myself to find out who this
refugee from a booby-hatch is and why. It's the Sam
Spade in me, I guess, but it's too late now to stop using
Wildroot Cream Oil.
Oetting Lack to the clues, these cards are always
printed in the same style, crowded and jumbled into
the space on a penny postcard. The cards are never
si ned, but. are always mailed from San Francisco. Half
of the time they are written in broken English and
seem to be the work ol an eight- to 12-year-old boy.
But the vocabulary used contradicts this assumption.
It is obvious that the author of the cards leads the
Stanford Daily and has seen Stanford's football team
in action at least three times this season.
What I want to know simply is who is the looney?
Is it the editor of the Daily Cal just trying to needle us?
Is it Will Connolly of the Chronicle? Is it some dis
l i untied tryoutee who got turned down by Rally Com?
Who is it?
Bull Session will offer one Harold's Club silver dol
lar to ; ny person or peisons tevealing information
leading to the identification of oui Mysterious Corre
spondent.
If you've j'ot nothing el: e to do, look into il will you'*
I'm just dying to know Just dying.
