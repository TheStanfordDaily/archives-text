While the San Francisco sports scribes are arguing in their own childish
mannei just who the\ should choose to lose to Army's GalilTa ior an All —
American ratiiv. ni ny people who know more than a little about the
autumn j aim an on-lei ins., just why these gentlemen of the press insist
on overlooking: a lad who is far and away the best football player on the
Pacific ('• ast Ken I\'< .•». my friends, is just that, but somebody has fallen
down rather badly in Ken's publicity campaign, without which no gridster
even as v:eat .• Kin has a prayer for national recognition. Rose, in
ether word: can co right on being the best in these parts and receive no
mere than a Incal i at on the back unless some professional scribe can
lotj>et his politii 1 in" and start looking at a piece of real gridste'r.
I, personal ■>, watched and wondered when, on silcceding weekends, the
2(15-1m 111!(I. -lo.it-ni:fee senior racked and ruined two All-American
tackle candidates, Houston (Harvard) and Alvin Wistert (Michigan),
and still nchods bothered to pick up the banner for him.

As of this week. Ken stands but
fourth in the Conference in pass
receiving and has seoiied but twice.
But it must be rem entered that he
is playing on a club that is known
as a "running team." And il any ol
the scribes have ever noticed the In
dian end block, they niay even now
—have some idea of just why Stan
ford is a "running tfam." And, at
least, he has obviously outplayed
every end he's faced this year.
1 don't know whether Ken gives
two hoots or not about; an All-Amer
ican rating or even an All-Coaster.
He, like the rest of tlwj team, is pri
marily interested in winning football
games, and to blazes, with the per
sonal bows. But he deserves it, and I,
for one, want to hear someone say so.
So, yesterday I elevated my poster
ior from its well-grooved spot on the
lench and toddled mp to Stanford
Coach Marehie Schwartz. "Coach," 1
said, "what do you think of Ken Rose
as a football player?" My pen was
poised anxiously.

"Ken Rose," the coach said, with startling firmness, "is tfie best end west
of (lie [Mississippi—both offensively and defensively."
By the time 1 had picked up my pen, the head man was busy devising a
way to stop the Idaho offense, so I turned away to the next nearest author
ity, Ray Harnmett. assistant coach. "Kenny," Ray looked down at me, "is
the best end I've seen this year. And, including our game pictures, the only
teams 1 haven't seen on the Coast are St. Mary's, USF. COP, and Oregon.
At this point assistant coach Dutch Ferhing became helpful. "I agree with
Ray, and I've seen Oregon."
I began to warm to my subject about this time, and approached head line
coach Phil Bengtson. In response to my query, Phil leaned Ixtck and started
talking. "Well," he said. "Iven is the best blocker we've bad since I've been
here. And he has a sure pair of hands—as nice a pair of hands as I've seen
tin any pass-catcher. And while lie's not the speed-burner type, Ken is
hard and elusive runner." I remembered what Dutch Fehring had once
told me: "When Ken catches the ball he knows what to do with it. I've never
seen him fail to make yardage from the point of reception to the point ol
tackle."
So I nodded sagely to Phil, and he went on, "Don't forget that Ken is an
excellent punter, and although we're not using him for that this year, he
helped us somewhat last season. I would say that Ken is definitely the best
all around end I ve seen this year. Why don't you talk to Mai Elward
about him Mai's the end coach, you know."
While seeking out Mai who was head coach and athletic director at
Purdue for l.'> years ! bumped into the genial Dutch Fehring again, and
once more the conversation got around to Stanford's best senior lineman.
Dutch still had some interesting things to say, "Ken is easily the best line
blocker on the squad and a fine pass receiver, of course. And I don't know
of any end that can block with him. And I think think that he is one of our
very best pro-lootball prospects."
By the time I found Mai Elward I had so many "rave notices" about Ken
that I was almost hoping that the end coach—who played end himself along
with Knute Rockne at Notre Dame —would have something bad to say
about the 22-y< ar-old Indian wingman. No such luck. "Mai," I said, "tell
me something about Ken Rose.''
"I could talk a l< ng time on Ken Rose," he said. "As far as the general
public is concerned, Rose is the most underrated end in the country. An
end usually ha.- to be spectacular for the public, who sit in the stands and
never see one block from another. In all my experience with ends, Rose
is trie be: t hlockc r I have eve) seen, and as for pass-receiving, 112 have seen
none better.
At this point I interrupted Mai to remind him that he himself, had coached
several more (ban hi share ol All-American ends. But my arguments not
withsitandin' ti e • • nial little end coach would not revise his statement.
"Rose i that y.uotl he said. "The way he handled Houston and Wistert
show just h'w to d his line blocking is. 11 is pass-catching, when we've had
to pass, has been excellent. We haven't played him much on defense this
year, but he is one of our best defensive ends. He punts well, and helped us
out a great deal last year after Mitchell got hurt."
"From the v.; \ you tell it, Mai," I said, "it makes Ken sound like a pretty
great end.
IMsd grinned lip al me, "<!e is. Al, he is."
