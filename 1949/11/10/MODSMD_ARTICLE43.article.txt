# UNBEATEN BY INDIANS
## Dixie Howell to Return To Farm; Cards Prepared 
### JOHN HALL 
Dixie Howell, the man from Ala
bama and Idaho, and the man who
has never lost to Stanford, may find
it a little bit difficult to keep that
record intact next Saturday when
his Vandals invade Stanford Sta
dium.
But, it can be assured that the
so-far successful Dixie isn't bring
ing his boys all the way down from

Moscow without planning to give it
;i try. Dixie seems to have a way
with Stanford.
Ilowell has had two shots at the
Cards. The first time was when he
played with Alabama againt Stan
lord in the 1935 Rose Bowl classic.
He was good enough that day to
pass and run his club to a 29-13 win
over the Vow Boys and establish a
total offense performance that still
stands in Rose Bowl records.
lIOWFLL SUCCESSFUL AGAIN
The next time Howell tangled
with Stanford was in 1947. By that
time he had become head coach of
Idaho. He brought his club down
for a season opener against tht In
dians who were counting upon the
usual Idaho breather.

But Howell stunned the Redskins
with a 19-1G upset and hurried back
to Idaho to rest upon his laurels.
Now, the conference officials have
beckoned him Stanford - way once
again, and Dixie is ready to oblige.
His thin Idaho squad will not be
rated a chance against Stanford, al
though the Vandals have shown
sparks of offensive power enough to
bother anybody. In fact, the little
Idaho boys lead the Pacific Coast in
rushing offense with an average of
271 yards per, and are second in
total offense.
Marchic Schwartz and Ray Ham
met t say they greatly fear the Dixie
Vandals, but perhaps they are eas
ily frightened. At any rate, the
coaching staff had the Indians dead
serious out in the rain last nigh,t
and both the offensive and defensive
units were given plenty of work.
Headman Schwartz missed prac
tice, as he was confined to his home
again with a bad cold.
INJURY I.IST SMALLER
Stanford's injury list was growing
smaller by the hour, and most en
couraging word was that Jack Rye.
defensive left end, will definitely
not be out lor the season as previ
ously stated. Rye has been giving
his knee the whirlpool treatment,
and has recovered rapidly enough
to be pronounced ready for the Big
Game.
Bob White was trying to run off
his hip pointer last night, jogging
laps and then trying a little light
offensive work against the dummies.
Dave Field's back is in playing
shape, but he probably will be held
out of the Idaho game, ;< ; will (iary
Kerkorian (sore shoulder), Rusk
Pomeroy (shoulder), and IJob

Rain or shine, the Indians should
axe the Howell jinx Saturday, and
take home their sixth game ball of
the season.

the Trojans last Saturday, has

week due. to a shoulder injury
sustained while tackling one of
CSC "s formerly highly touted
backs.
