# 'T' Formation: The Story Of Mr. Shaughnessy's Baby
## 
### HOWARD SEARS 
As any student of Stanfordology
can recall, 1940 was a great year in
Stanford football. That was the year
of Ail-American Frankie Albert, and
"Big Chief" Norm Standlee, and all
the rest; the year that a Cardinal
team, completely missed by pre
season guessers, walked over nine
opponents into the Rose Bowl and
the National Championship.
But, 1940 made a more lasting
mark of football history in general.
Clark Shaughnessy, then Indian men
tor, unveiled to a skeptical pigskin
world, the radical Stanford T forma
tion.
The evolution of this style of of
fense, which has dominated gridiron
play from sand-lots to stadiums for
the past decade, can be traced to the
very origin of football itself. In the
days of Walter Camp it was charac
teristic of the offensive team to es
tablish three of its backfield men in
a line parallel to the forward line
and to place the fourth back between
the two lines.
As time progressed, however, the
'i formation lost favor in football cir
cles and was generally replaced by
other forms. But, late in the 1930's
there were some who believed that
the efficiency of defensive strategy
over offense had become so great as to
crowd the hot-shot passers arid run
ners of yore out of the limelight.
MR. SIIAUOHNESSY AND TIIE T
Among these people were Shaugh
nessy, who was coach at Chicago, and
(Jeorge Halas, president and coach of
the Chicago Bears professional team.
In 1939, gridiron students will re
member the Big Ten became the Big
Nine when Chicago University gave
up the ghost after a terrifically poor
season. The Bears were still clinging
to the antiquated T, and clinging just
as tenaciously to the National League
cellar.
So it was that Shaughnessy and
Halas, in desperation, got together
and fostered the modern T formation
emphasizing speed and deception as
an answer to the mighty defensive
teams of the day.
In September of 1940 Shaughnessy
had replaced Tiny Thornhill, who had
led the Indians to a near winless '39
season, and began to teach his new
system on the Farm. The win-starved
Cardinals collected their first scalp in
over a year when they humbled the
University of San Francisco in the
Reason's first game.
The reactions of the experts, who
•Mttickeri Slanloid as a second-rate

outfit, were immediate but not unani
mous. Comments ranged from "fluke"
to the "dawn of the greatest revolu
tion in football history."
The fact remained that Big Red had
gone over, around, and through USF
in unheralded manner, and it con
tinued to go over, around, and
through opponents all season until he
brought home the National Cham
pionship.
MR. HAEAS AND THE T
At the same time George Halas'
Bears had run high, wide, and hand
some through the nation's pro circles
and T'ed themselves a championship.
When the 1941 season rolled around
the T formation was the center of
much controversy. However, it was
now established and recognized as a
part of the game. Some sportswl iters
howled that it would only work for
. uch spectacular players as Sid Luck
man, quarterback of the Bears, and
Albert of the Indians.
Major Pat Hanley, coach of Boston
College, said, "The T just isn't adapt
able to any squad. It needs a super
quarterback and a strong center of
the line. (In most T systems there is
a total of 15 spins the qb must exe
cute besides Marrying the ball him
self.)
Major Ilaniey continued to use the
double wing back at Boston, but the T
was spreading. All over the country
colleges, high schools, and pro teams
were striving to cash in on the glory
that was Stanford's and the Bears'.
Some of the attempts could be called
little more than foolish, but by 1944
over 50 per cent of the colleges were
starting their gridiron alphabet with
T.
MR. EVERY COACH AND THE T
Variations and modifications to the
Stanford system were in time de
veloped, with varying degrees of suc
cess, to add new terms to football jar
gon. Lou Little, at Columbia, came
out with the "Split T"; Michigan's
Fritz Crisler used the "Unbalanced
T", Nebraska, Minnesota, and lowa
employed the "Part-time T," while
the Boston professional Yanks
worked on the "QT."
Since the war the football cycle
seems to be gradually swinging back.
In many schools the T has been re
placed or modified beyond recogni
tion. The single wing is becoming
more popular than ever, and new sys
tems are springing up. In general, it
can still be said that the Shaughnessy
T remains the basis of conventional
football in the United States today.

and fostered the modern T formation
emphasizing speed and deception as
an answer to the mighty defensive
teams of the day.
In September of 1940 Shaughnessy
had replaced Tiny Thornhill, who had
led the Indians to a near winless '39
season, and began to teach his new
system on the Farm. The win-starved
Cardinals collected their first scalp in
over a year when they humbled the
University of San Francisco in the
Reason's first game.
The reactions of the experts, who
•Mttickeri Slanloid as a second-rate

outfit, were immediate but not unani
mous. Comments ranged from "fluke"
to the "dawn of the greatest revolu

The fact remained that Big Red had
gone over, around, and through USF
in unheralded manner, and it con
tinued to go over, around, and
through opponents all season until he
brought home the National Cham
pionship.

At the same time George Halas'
Bears had run high, wide, and hand
some through the nation's pro circles
and T'ed themselves a championship.
When the 1941 season rolled around
the T formation was the center of
much controversy. However, it was
now established and recognized as a
part of the game. Some sportswl iters
howled that it would only work for
. uch spectacular players as Sid Luck
man, quarterback of the Bears, and
Albert of the Indians.
Major Pat Hanley, coach of Boston
College, said, "The T just isn't adapt
able to any squad. It needs a super
quarterback and a strong center of
the line. (In most T systems there is
a total of 15 spins the qb must exe
cute besides Marrying the ball him
self.)
Major Ilaniey continued to use the
double wing back at Boston, but the T
was spreading. All over the country
colleges, high schools, and pro teams
were striving to cash in on the glory
that was Stanford's and the Bears'.
Some of the attempts could be called
little more than foolish, but by 1944
over 50 per cent of the colleges were
starting their gridiron alphabet with
T.
MR. EVERY COACH AND THE T
Variations and modifications to the
Stanford system were in time de
veloped, with varying degrees of suc
cess, to add new terms to football jar
gon. Lou Little, at Columbia, came
out with the "Split T"; Michigan's
Fritz Crisler used the "Unbalanced
T", Nebraska, Minnesota, and lowa
employed the "Part-time T," while
the Boston professional Yanks
worked on the "QT."
Since the war the football cycle
seems to be gradually swinging back.
In many schools the T has been re
placed or modified beyond recogni
tion. The single wing is becoming
more popular than ever, and new sys
tems are springing up. In general, it
can still be said that the Shaughnessy
T remains the basis of conventional
football in the United States today.
As any student of Stanfordology
can recall, 1940 was a great year in
Stanford football. That was the year
of Ail-American Frankie Albert, and
"Big Chief" Norm Standlee, and all
the rest; the year that a Cardinal
team, completely missed by pre
season guessers, walked over nine
opponents into the Rose Bowl and
the National Championship.
But, 1940 made a more lasting
mark of football history in general.
Clark Shaughnessy, then Indian men
tor, unveiled to a skeptical pigskin
world, the radical Stanford T forma
tion.
The evolution of this style of of
fense, which has dominated gridiron
play from sand-lots to stadiums for
the past decade, can be traced to the
very origin of football itself. In the
days of Walter Camp it was charac
teristic of the offensive team to es
tablish three of its backfield men in
a line parallel to the forward line
and to place the fourth back between
the two lines.
As time progressed, however, the
'i formation lost favor in football cir
cles and was generally replaced by
other forms. But, late in the 1930's
there were some who believed that
the efficiency of defensive strategy
over offense had become so great as to
crowd the hot-shot passers arid run
ners of yore out of the limelight.
MR. SIIAUOHNESSY AND TIIE T
Among these people were Shaugh
nessy, who was coach at Chicago, and
(Jeorge Halas, president and coach of
the Chicago Bears professional team.
In 1939, gridiron students will re

that was Stanford's and the Bears'.
Some of the attempts could be called
little more than foolish, but by 1944
over 50 per cent of the colleges were
starting their gridiron alphabet with
T.
MR. EVERY COACH AND THE T
Variations and modifications to the
Stanford system were in time de
veloped, with varying degrees of suc
cess, to add new terms to football jar
gon. Lou Little, at Columbia, came
out with the "Split T"; Michigan's
Fritz Crisler used the "Unbalanced
T", Nebraska, Minnesota, and lowa
employed the "Part-time T," while
the Boston professional Yanks
worked on the "QT."
Since the war the football cycle
seems to be gradually swinging back.
In many schools the T has been re
placed or modified beyond recogni
tion. The single wing is becoming
more popular than ever, and new sys
tems are springing up. In general, it
can still be said that the Shaughnessy
T remains the basis of conventional
football in the United States today.
As any student of Stanfordology
can recall, 1940 was a great year in
Stanford football. That was the year
of Ail-American Frankie Albert, and
"Big Chief" Norm Standlee, and all
the rest; the year that a Cardinal
team, completely missed by pre
season guessers, walked over nine
opponents into the Rose Bowl and
the National Championship.
But, 1940 made a more lasting
mark of football history in general.
Clark Shaughnessy, then Indian men
tor, unveiled to a skeptical pigskin
world, the radical Stanford T forma
tion.
The evolution of this style of of
fense, which has dominated gridiron
play from sand-lots to stadiums for
the past decade, can be traced to the
very origin of football itself. In the
days of Walter Camp it was charac
teristic of the offensive team to es
tablish three of its backfield men in
a line parallel to the forward line
and to place the fourth back between
the two lines.
As time progressed, however, the
'i formation lost favor in football cir
cles and was generally replaced by
other forms. But, late in the 1930's
there were some who believed that
the efficiency of defensive strategy
over offense had become so great as to
crowd the hot-shot passers arid run
ners of yore out of the limelight.
MR. SIIAUOHNESSY AND TIIE T
Among these people were Shaugh
nessy, who was coach at Chicago, and
(Jeorge Halas, president and coach of
the Chicago Bears professional team.
In 1939, gridiron students will re
member the Big Ten became the Big
Nine when Chicago University gave
up the ghost after a terrifically poor
season. The Bears were still clinging
to the antiquated T, and clinging just
as tenaciously to the National League
cellar.
So it was that Shaughnessy and
Halas, in desperation, got together
and fostered the modern T formation
emphasizing speed and deception as
an answer to the mighty defensive
teams of the day.
In September of 1940 Shaughnessy
had replaced Tiny Thornhill, who had
led the Indians to a near winless '39
season, and began to teach his new
system on the Farm. The win-starved
Cardinals collected their first scalp in
over a year when they humbled the
University of San Francisco in the
Reason's first game.
The reactions of the experts, who
•Mttickeri Slanloid as a second-rate

outfit, were immediate but not unani
mous. Comments ranged from "fluke"
to the "dawn of the greatest revolu
tion in football history."
The fact remained that Big Red had
gone over, around, and through USF
in unheralded manner, and it con
tinued to go over, around, and
through opponents all season until he
brought home the National Cham
pionship.
MR. HAEAS AND THE T
At the same time George Halas'
Bears had run high, wide, and hand
some through the nation's pro circles
and T'ed themselves a championship.
When the 1941 season rolled around
the T formation was the center of
much controversy. However, it was
now established and recognized as a
part of the game. Some sportswl iters
howled that it would only work for
. uch spectacular players as Sid Luck
man, quarterback of the Bears, and
Albert of the Indians.
Major Pat Hanley, coach of Boston
College, said, "The T just isn't adapt
able to any squad. It needs a super
quarterback and a strong center of
the line. (In most T systems there is
a total of 15 spins the qb must exe
cute besides Marrying the ball him
self.)
Major Ilaniey continued to use the
double wing back at Boston, but the T
was spreading. All over the country
colleges, high schools, and pro teams
were striving to cash in on the glory
that was Stanford's and the Bears'.
