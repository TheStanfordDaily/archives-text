# Irish Vs. Tarheel Tussle Brings Memories of 1946
## 
### WHITNEY MARTIN 
NEW YORK, Nov. 11 (/P> â€” The !
crowd will be there. Some 7C>,000 t
admirers of perft. tion will shuffle \
their way into Yankee Stadium next
Saturday to watch Frank Leahy's
Notre Dame team demonstrate how
football should be played.
The sparring partner will be
North Carolina, and we have an idea !
even ardent North Carolina fans are j
hoping only that their team loses j
only by a respectable score, say two j
or three touchdowns.
Sure, the crowd will be there. The
magic name of Notre Dame assures
lhat. But it won't be a jabbering, !
eager-eyed crowd tingling with an
ticipation of a spirited contest with I
a doubtful outcome.
It won't be, for instance, a crowd j
choked up with excitement as was
the crowd which jammed the sta
dium three years ago today to see
what probably was the most publi- I
cized game of this generation.
ONCE UPON A TIME
On Nov. 9, 194G, Army and Notre
Dame played what proved to be |
their last game in New York fori
some time, and everything leading i
up to that game built up a tremen
dous interest throughout the coun- |
try.
In addition to the natural rivalry
developed through the years, the
element of revenge entered the pic
ture, as well as a showdown to
prove whether or not the Army
team developed by Coach Earl Blaik
during the war was as great as many
believed, and many didn't believe.
The preceding two years Notre
Dame had taken some horrible
beatings from the Cadets. Humili
ating defeats which clamored for
retribution. The war - weakened
Irish just couldn't match the man
power of the machine from up the
Hudson.
v-'v it would be different, Notre

i Dame followers gloated. The war
1 was over, Leahy was back directing
t the Irish team, and returning serv
ice men provided him with ample
i material. Let's see what Doc Blun
chard and Glenn Davis, near the end
of their great careers at West Point,
could do aaginst real competition.
