# UNBEATEN AND UNTIED
## 
### 
Both teams came up for the game
unbeaten and untied. Notre Dame
had the best defensive record, with
on!y 18 points scored against it in
five games. Army had yielded SG.
But Army had Blanchard and Davis,
who would offset Johnny Lujack,
Leahy's "coach of the field," and
would outspeed the hefty and potent
Notre Dame line which boasted such
great performers as George Connor
and Ziggy Czarobski.
The 0-0 tie was a vindication for
both teams. Notre Dame succeeded
in pretty well bottling up Davis and
Blanchard, and Army proved it was
as touch and rugged as was be
lieved by stopping the offense of the
admittedly great Notre Dame squad.
One memory of that game stands
out above all others. That is the
picture of Lujack. renowned prima
rily for his passing ability and field
generalship, tackling Blanchard in
the clear when the burly halfback
came charging down the field with
only Lujack standing in the way of
a touchdown which would have
meant the ball game.
So it will be Notre Dame again
Saturday, and it's a pity it isn't
Army in the other corner. The set
up for the game would have many
things in common with the setup for
that 194G encounter — both teams
unbeaten and untied, both stand
outs in the nation. The crowd will
be there, but it will be a crowd
coming to view a masterpiece of ex
hibition.
