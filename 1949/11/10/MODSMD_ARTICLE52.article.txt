## Idaho Brought Much Woe To Farm Upon Last Visit 
### EARL ODELL 
The last time Stanford played Idaho
in 1947 the Vandals helped themselves
to a victory handed to them on a
golden platter. The platter was com
posed of an Indian sieve-like pass de
fense, 110 yards worth of penalties,
and trimmed with lots of fumbles.
Alter the game, the potato-pickers
went home to run their coach for gov
ernor, taking 19 points with them and
leaving 1U for the hapless Farmhands.
Until that unspeakable year, the
Vandals had touched the Cardinal
goal only twice in the series which
began in 1923, with the Indian team
beating the Idahoans 17 to 7, although
the Vandal pass attack kept the In
juns worried all day.
Never a powerful tean\the Vandals
have/ nevertheless, given the Reds
some bad moments and have always
been regarded with wariness. The
boys from the north are, and always
have been, an explosive team, and are
ready at all times to take advantage
of any break that comes their way.
Although Stanford defeated the
vaunted Vandals 3 to 0 in 1924, the
game was turned into an Indian vic
tory by the Idahoans themselves,
who fumbled on the one-foot line.
Card Cuddeback's 17-yard place kick
early in the fourth frame was all that
saved the game for the Farm eleven.
This Saturday the Vandals could
repeat their '47 performance, but, ac
cording to past records, the Indians
would have help them to give Idaho
a victory.
