## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9 (/J') â€”The
proposed "Little World Series" will
top the discussion tomorrow of Pa
cific Coast League directors at their |
annual fall meeting.
The post-season series would put
the Coast League pennant winner
against the winner of another triple-
A class circuit, the International
League or the American Associa- j
tion. Those loops will discuss the
matter at meetings next week.
The PCL 1950 schedule may be j
held up until a decision is reached
on the series, said Clarence Row
land, league president.
Paul Richards, new Seattle mana- 1
ger, and Red Kress, incoming at I
Sacramento, are expected to attend |
for a formal welcoming.
