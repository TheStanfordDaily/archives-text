A new type cf auto or truck en- j
nine, using hot gases to turn a tur- !
bine, may be the outgrowth of to ts
being conducted at Stanford on a j
German-developed Junkers "free
piston" Diesel compressor.
This crankless engine, which runs |
well on low-grade oil, can in prin- j
ciple be made in any size from that :
of an auto engine up to the size of |
the largest Diesel.
Stanford engineers say that its ad
vantages over other engines are that
it is light, almost free of vibration,
and is inexpensive to build, operate,
and maintain.
The particular engine tested in the '
Mechanical Engineering Department \
under the direction of Professor A. I
L. London was formerly used as an
air compressor in a German sub- ,
marine and was given to Stanford
through the courtesy of the U.S. Bu
reau of Ships to stimulate research I
and development of free piston sys- j
terns on the West Coast.
Professor London says that the de- .
sign of the engine, which is char
acterized by extreme mechanical |
simplicity, makes it suitable for use
either as an air compressor or as an
all-purpose prime mover.
Tests on the engine, carried out by i
W. H. Chamberlain of Menlo Park, j
graduate student in mechanical en
gineering, confirm German perform
ance claims that it would take 70 ;
cubic feet a minute of free air and
compress it to 3,000 pounds per square j
inch of compressed air.
As a piime mover, Professor Lon
don explained, such an engine would
produce hot exhaust gases—roughly i
at a pressure of 100 pounds per
square inch—and these gases would j
drive a turbine which in turn would
drive a shaft.
Theoretically the free-piston Die- j
scl-turbine prime mover has a higher
thermal efficiency than the modern
Diesel.
The vibration-free qualities of the ;
engine are demonstrated by the fact ! j
that one can successfully balance a j
coin on edge on the engine while it
is in operation. j [
