# Crankless Diesel Engine, Easily Operated, Tested by Farm Engineering Department
## 
### 
The Stanford work, sponsored by
the Office of Naval Research, is aimed
at analyzing the thermodynamic and
dynamic design aspects of both the
air compressor and prime mover
types of free-piston systems.
Curiously enough, the engineers
point out, the free-piston engine is

not new. It was invented some 20
years ago by a Frenchman named
Rault de Pescara, who is still carry
ing on. extensive development work
in France.
| Recent interest in the engine was
| inspired by both German and French
I successes in making use of the engine.

The German Junkers system tested
at Stanford is a single-cylinder, 40-
horsepower, opposed-piston Diesel,
operating on a two-stroke cycle, with
four steps of air compression. The
j system is designed to produce com-
I pressed air for torpedo launching.


THIS GERMAN-DEVELOPED Junkers "free-piston" Diesel may offer engineering answers to
the problems of how to develop a turbine engine for automobiles or trucks. The model pictured
here in a Stanford laboratory is an air compressor but the engine can also be designed as a
power gas generator for a turbine. Here (left to right) Captain W. E. Rafert, army ordnance; A.
L. London, Stanford professor of mechanical engineering; and William H. Chamberlain ex
amine the crankless engine. Rafert (of Indianapolis, Ind.) and Chamberlain (of Menlo Park)
are graduate students doing research work on the engine under Professor London's direction.
