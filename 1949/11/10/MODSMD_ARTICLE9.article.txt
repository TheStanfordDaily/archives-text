# Honor Code Discussed By Excom
## 
### 
Excom last night recom
mended that efforts be made to
obtain a uniform interpretation
of the Honor Code in all depart
ments of the University, espe
cially in regard to taking exam
inations out of the classroom.
A report by Cole Manes, chairman
of the Honor Code subcommittee on
r acu'ty - student relations, showed
that there was no thoroughly con
sistent policy in the various schools.
In the Mathematics and Physiol
ogy departments, the rule generally
is that examinations must be taken
in the classroom unless the student
has some incapacitating illness.
PROFESSOR DECIDES
Other departments, including Hu
manities and Sciences, leave the
matter to the individual professor.
They usually do not prohibit taking
examinations out of c'ass, but prefer
that they be written in the exami
nation room.
Excom felt that since the proposed
reinterpretation of the Honor Code
to prohibit the taking of exams out
of classrooms was withdrawn sev
eral weeks ago, students should be
given the privilege of taking exam
inations out of the classroom in all
departments.
The constitution of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People was approved last
night. The term "colored people''
here refers to persons of all minor
ity races and crec.s.
NO POLITICAL ACTION
The association was restricted
on'y in that it must not become a
political action group, since these
are not allowed on campus. The as
sociation, nationally, has taken
stands on political issues.
The purpose of the group, as stat
ed in the constitution, is to "pro
mote the civic, economic, education
al, and social betterment of colored
people, and to work for the better
ment of all races and religions."
Constitutions for the Music Lis
tening Room and Stern Hall Club
were also approved.
Excom heard a report by Blaine
Hardy, foreign scholarships chair
man. Hardy said he did not antici
pate making additional requests for
money from Excom or other groups
this year.
