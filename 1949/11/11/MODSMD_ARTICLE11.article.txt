# Farm Aids U. of Berlin
## 
### 
Just a year ago this month the
Free University of Berlin opened its
doors to 2,200 students. Today it has
an enrollment of 4,000 with a waiting
list of 4,000 more.
The Free University v/us estab
lished through the efforts of students
who dropped from the old Univer
sity of Berlin in I lie Russian Sector
for political reasons. In seven months
these students found buildings, or
ganized a library, found professors,
raised the several million marks
necessary, and set up an admissions
office with high standards for their
new university.
The university has a liberal arts
curiculum, a medical school and a
law school among other courses of
study.
But when winter set. in last year,
students at the university began lo
feel the pinch along with other Ber
lin civilians. All supplies were com
ing in by air lift to beat the block
ade.
Importance and necessity of air lift
supplies is exemplified by a state
ment in a report of the AMG:
"Because of the need for conserv
ing every possible ton of air lift space
for the German civilian economy,
luxury, and other non-essential items
were excluded from the requirements
of the occupational personnel and
items of lesser essentiality were kept
to a bare minimum."
Some of the air lift during the worst
ci isis, though, came in marked spe
cifically for the Free University of
Berlin. This was a shipment of some
two tons of food, clothing, books, and
school supplies sent from Stanford.
In a special drive last winter Farm
[students collected the supplies. Funds
to buy the books were taken from the
SIRO Educational Rehabilitation
Fund one of the recipients of the
present Stanford Relief Drive money.
Says Iracy Strong, just returned
from Berlin, "The greatest thing that
the Berlin 'students obtained from
this shipment was a boost in morale
llrom the recognition of their work by
students of the Western world. Their
greatest eagerness is to know what it
j going on outside Germany."
