### 
Berkeley had visitors early yes
terday morning.
At 3:10 a.m. six representatives
>112 the class of '53 crept past Bov/lcs
Hall carrying $26 worth of "Cardinal
red" paint. An hour later, the Cal
"C" was once again the victim of
the Indians.
Four carloads of frosh left Eneina
at 11 Wednesday night determined
to retaliate for the Cal raid last
week. While three of the cars were
stopped by police, the fourth, armed
with brooms and the paint, accom
plished its goal.
The raiders told a vivid story.
"After a final meeting with the other
cars at 1:30, wc went alone and
mixed the paint among the frater
nity houses. A gallon of the mixture
was dumped on some fiat steps.
"Then we left the car and went
up the hill to the "C." Everything
was quiet and tense. We watched
for guards in the cyclotron tower
about 50 feet away from the "C,"
but we discovered none. Immedi
ately we did the job without speak
ing to each other.
"During the painting, an empty

car was knocked over, and it went
rattling down the hill. Although wc
were ready for anything, nothing
happened. There were no guards
anywhere. As soon as we were fin
ished, we went back to the car and
headed home."
Meanwhile excitement reigned on
the Farm when the cry went out,
"Cal men on campus!" At 11 Wed
nesday night, as the Indian raiding
party left for Berkeley, other En
cina men were rallying to protect
the campus.
Groups of freshmen hunted for
the "foreigners" on campus until
about 2:30. No Bearmen were
caught. The official campus policing
begins tonight.
