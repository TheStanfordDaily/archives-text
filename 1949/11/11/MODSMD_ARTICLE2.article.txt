PITTSBURGH â€” The great steel
strike of J tonight neared an end
as the United States Steel Corpora

Lawyers for union and company
worked all day polishing up the
pension and insurance agreement
which may be signed tomorrow.
Peace between the union and U.S.
Steel would mean the virtual end
of the 41 -day-old strike. The com

about one-third of the country's
steel.
