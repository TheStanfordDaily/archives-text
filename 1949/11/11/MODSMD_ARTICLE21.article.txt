# Women to Get 3:30 Leaves
## 
### 
Three-thirty late leaves for Big
Game night and petitioning for par
ticipant late leaves were discussed at
AWS meeting yesterday afternoon.
Plans were also reviewed for the
AWS Nurses' Tea set for next Thurs
day from 3:30 to 4:30 and for food
sales at the Gaieties performances
next week.
Each Stanford woman is entitled to
take a 3:30 late leave Big Game night,
Saturday, November 19, instead of a
1:30 late leave, Doris Cooper, chair
man of Women's Council said. This
will count as a 1:30 leave off her
quota. An overnight can be changed
to a 3:30 if a woman wishes to come
home before that hour.
PARTICIPANT LEAVES
Participant late leave permits will
be granted to second and third quar
ter freshmen, sophomore, and jun
ior women, if after they have used up
one-third of their leaves on activities
they petition to Council for any more
that they require. Seniors have not
been granted this privilege since they
have unlimited late leaves.
Members of AWS Cabinet dis
cussed the question of whether to al
low the juniors to petition for par
ticipation leaves above their quota
of 55 late leaves per quarter. But
since many juniors give a lot of time
to campus activities, it was thought
that they might limit those activities
if they were forced to use social late
leaves for them.

ing pie-nursing students, nurses
from the Nursing School in San
Francisco, and AWS Cabinet mem
bers will be present at the AWS
