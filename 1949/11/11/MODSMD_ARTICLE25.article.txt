# Idaho Is Next On Card List
## Vandals Rated at Top Strength; Stanford Is Given Heavy Advantage 
### JOHN HALL 
Step nine of the 10-step trail along the Road to Roses will be at
tempted tomorrow afternoon when Stanford's USC-smashing In
dians will entertain the four-time-losing Idaho Vandals.
It will be the last hurdle for the Cards on the way to setting the
stage for the Biggest Big Game since 1935, and Stanford is heavy

favorite to clear that barrier and axe
Idaho by 26 points.
KickofT is set for 2 p.m. (15 minim ,
earlier than usual) with a prelim
inary clash between Stanford Bravi ,
and San Francisco City College
scheduled for 11 a.m. There will also
be a half-time contest between the
Lumpe Lions Boys' Clubs.
But the entire bargain-day bill will
probably not lure more than 12,00!)
fans to Stanford Stadium, as all hands
expect the Cards to knock the Ho
out of Ida and waltz into the
Game one week hence with all the
blue chips on the table.

Willamette, 79-0.
Idaho is set to shoot the work:;.
Howell's Maybe-T, a combination
between the old Notre-Dame box and
the Stanford T, is just beginning to
click. Last week it fooled Oregon
State enough for Idaho to roll up 25
points and hinted that it could do
the same against anybody.
SCHWARTZ IS WORRIED
But Stanford is ready for this on. .
And, after all, Idaho is Idaho. But
don't tell that to Marchie Schwartz.
He's worried. He's still thinkint.,
about the 1947 game when A 1 Rau had
his leg broken and when five other
Cards were put out of commission.
Another afternoon of injuries such
as those could put Stanford on the
ropes for good, and with several
gridders still nursing (JSC bruises,
the .situation becomes deadly serious.
Thus, Schwartz and his henchmen
have been taking no chances. They
have run off a week of sincere prac
tice sessions, and are ready to give
Idaho the best they've got.
However, a new backfield consist
ing of Dick Horn at quarter, Holy
Boruck at left half, Boyd Benson at
half, and Bud Klein at full, will
see heavy duty and might even draw
the starting assignments.
The regular defensive and oflensive
lines should remain the same. End
Jack Hye will be out, and Russ Pome

NURSING USC INJURIES
Backs who will get needed rest to
morrow include David Field, Bob
White, and Gary Kerkorian. All
three were .shaken up in the USC al
lair, but could go if needed.
Halfback Boyd Benson, who has
gained the reputation ol "either lum
l.liiig or scoring a touchdown," will
probably carry most of the offensive
loud. Benson is one of the finest run
ning backs on the Coast. He runs
hard, fast, and low, being the most
diflicult Card back to bring down.
Another of Stanlord's top runners,
fullback Bud Klein, should get back
into the scoring column tomorrow.
Klein, as tricky and clever a runner
as can be found, sat. out both the USC
and Santa Clara games.
CONFERENCE STATISTICS
Idaho will bring with them the
Conference statistics books which
piove that they have the best ground
offense on the Coast, but Stanford has
the best ground defense, so some
body is going to have to give.

seem that Idaho-will do the giving.

Step nine of the 10-step trail along the Road to Roses will be at
tempted tomorrow afternoon when Stanford's USC-smashing In
dians will entertain the four-time-losing Idaho Vandals.
It will be the last hurdle for the Cards on the way to setting the
stage for the Biggest Big Game since 1935, and Stanford is heavy

favorite to clear that barrier and axe
Idaho by 26 points.
KickofT is set for 2 p.m. (15 minim ,
earlier than usual) with a prelim
inary clash between Stanford Bravi ,
and San Francisco City College
scheduled for 11 a.m. There will also
be a half-time contest between the
Lumpe Lions Boys' Clubs.
But the entire bargain-day bill will
probably not lure more than 12,00!)
fans to Stanford Stadium, as all hands
expect the Cards to knock the Ho
out of Ida and waltz into the
Game one week hence with all the
blue chips on the table.
HOWELL JINX
All hands that is, cxcept Alaban ;t
Dixie Howell and his 37 Vandals, who
will arrive in Palo Alto this after
noon, determined to repeat their 19-
16 win of 1947 and keep the Howell
Jinx intact.
It will be Idaho's final contest of
the year, and the Moscow men ars
fired up to make liars out of the odd. -
makers. They figure to fcc at top
strength for the first time since then
season opener when they humbled
Willamette, 79-0.
Idaho is set to shoot the work:;.
Howell's Maybe-T, a combination
between the old Notre-Dame box and
the Stanford T, is just beginning to
click. Last week it fooled Oregon
State enough for Idaho to roll up 25
points and hinted that it could do
the same against anybody.
SCHWARTZ IS WORRIED
But Stanford is ready for this on. .
And, after all, Idaho is Idaho. But
don't tell that to Marchie Schwartz.
He's worried. He's still thinkint.,
about the 1947 game when A 1 Rau had
his leg broken and when five other
Cards were put out of commission.
Another afternoon of injuries such
as those could put Stanford on the
ropes for good, and with several
gridders still nursing (JSC bruises,
the .situation becomes deadly serious.
Thus, Schwartz and his henchmen
have been taking no chances. They
have run off a week of sincere prac
tice sessions, and are ready to give
Idaho the best they've got.
However, a new backfield consist
ing of Dick Horn at quarter, Holy
Boruck at left half, Boyd Benson at
half, and Bud Klein at full, will
see heavy duty and might even draw
the starting assignments.
The regular defensive and oflensive
lines should remain the same. End
Jack Hye will be out, and Russ Pome
n>y will see only limited action. Oth
ei wise, no changes.
NURSING USC INJURIES
Backs who will get needed rest to
morrow include David Field, Bob
White, and Gary Kerkorian. All
three were .shaken up in the USC al
lair, but could go if needed.
Halfback Boyd Benson, who has
gained the reputation ol "either lum
l.liiig or scoring a touchdown," will
probably carry most of the offensive
loud. Benson is one of the finest run
ning backs on the Coast. He runs
hard, fast, and low, being the most
diflicult Card back to bring down.
Another of Stanlord's top runners,
fullback Bud Klein, should get back
into the scoring column tomorrow.
Klein, as tricky and clever a runner
as can be found, sat. out both the USC
and Santa Clara games.
CONFERENCE STATISTICS
Idaho will bring with them the
Conference statistics books which
piove that they have the best ground
offense on the Coast, but Stanford has
the best ground defense, so some
body is going to have to give.
And after taking a look at Van Al
styne, Poulson, Pomeroy, Castagnoli,
Cone, Walker, and Laakso, it would
seem that Idaho-will do the giving.
Step 10 coming up.
