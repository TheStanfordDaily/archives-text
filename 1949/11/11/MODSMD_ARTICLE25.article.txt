Step nine of the 10-step trail along the Road to Roses will be at
tempted tomorrow afternoon when Stanford's USC-smashing In
dians will entertain the four-time-losing Idaho Vandals.
It will be the last hurdle for the Cards on the way to setting the
stage for the Biggest Big Game since 1935, and Stanford is heavy

between the old Notre-Dame box and
the Stanford T, is just beginning to
click. Last week it fooled Oregon
State enough for Idaho to roll up 25
points and hinted that it could do
the same against anybody.
SCHWARTZ IS WORRIED
But Stanford is ready for this on. .
And, after all, Idaho is Idaho. But
don't tell that to Marchie Schwartz.
He's worried. He's still thinkint.,
