# Pinch Yourself, Mr. Sullivan

Mr. Prescott Sullivan, a sports writer for the
San Francisco Examiner and author of a daily
column appropriately titled "The Low Down,"
reached into the bottom of the barrel yesterday
morning and came up with a lew pearls of wis
dom on the Big Game ticket situation.
Sources close to Mr, Sullivan have informed
him that certain elements of the Stanford
alumni group are unhappy over the fact that
some 3,000 Buck-of-the-Month Club members
are entitled to buy four ducats apiece while
A 1 Masters has shaved grads with paid-up
Alumni Association receipts in their pockets to
two.
Many of these Buck-a-Month Clubbers, the
column goes on to say, are not Stanford peo
ple, and some might even be California guys
who hope Stanford chokes, but who gladly
bounce $12 in dues so as to be sure to be there
when, and if, it happens.
Correct on all counts, Mr. Sullivan. Or, as
Ihe saying goes, "so far, so good."
But before we go any further, let's get our
feet on the ground with a few facts about the
Buck-of-the-Month Club.
The group consists of about 3,000 members
who chip in 12 bucks a year to help pay the
freight for Stanford athletes. Every cent of this
amount is spent on tuition. None of it goes for
shiny automobiles, or clothes, or room and
board, or even books. Even the postage stamp
that mails out the monthly Club Bulletin is
bought with other funds.
The Club is needed because of the large dif
ferential between tuition at Stanford and the
amount collected at most other schools on our
schedule. Athletes must pay at least $65 of the
tuition themselves while the balance is taken
care of in varying amounts by Buck-of-the-
Month subscriptions.
This figure of $65 was agreed upon many
years ago by Robert Gordon Sproul, president
of the University of California, and the late Dr.
Hay Lyman Wilbur of Stanford. Tuition at Cal
is $65 against $GOO at Stanford and Sproul said

he didn't care how much of the differential was
taken care of as long as athletes ptid at least
$65. This figure was subsequently put onto
the Conference code as the minimum tuition
which athletes must pay in any grant-in-aid
plan.
Approximately 60 Stanford athletes, not all
of them football players, are aided by the pro
gram each year. In spite of this assistance, at
least 90 per cent of them are making a financial
sacrifice to attend Stanford because they could
find a better deal elsewhere. You don't have to
be an "insider" to know that.
Now then, if what you're proposing, Mr. Sul
livan, is that Club members be chopped back
to two tickets each and that their high priority
which gives them "good seats" on about the
five-yard line be taken away, forget it.
You're a dreamer. The old grads have a valid
argument, sure, but let's be realistic for a min
ute.
Suppose that Buck-of-the-Month ticket priv
ileges were cut fc> the bone and membership
fell, as it inevitably would. Who would foot the
tuition bill for deserving athletes who meet all
but the financial requirements?
The alumni? We doubt it. At least they
haven't shown any inclination to underwrite
the scholarship program as yet.
Membership in the Club would gladly be
limited to Stanford grads if enough wished to
belong, but not enough do yet. Until that time
comes, membership will continue to be strictly
a business proposition for the 30 or so per cent
non-alumni members—a trade of $12 a year for
ticket privileges to Stanford games.
Without the Buck-of-the-Month Club or some
other group which is inclined to carry at least
part of the tuition load, Stanford would soon
become a third-rate athletic power—in the same
class with Willamette and Fresno State. Then,
you and I wouldn't care to see the Big Game.
In fact, there wouldn't be a Big Game at all.
Pinch yourself, Mr. Sullivan. Wake up. It
was only a bad dream.
