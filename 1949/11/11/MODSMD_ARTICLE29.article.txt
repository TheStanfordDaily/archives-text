# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Lei",'; something unusual this morning. Let's just
pass out a few odds and ends and not say anything
mean about anybody. After all, it's the end of the
week and elections are over.

First, thanks to some extensive
mearch, 1 have uncovered the
original shaggy-dog story: A Kan
sas City bartender happened to
pick up a year-old copy of the
London Times one day in his bar
rcom, and found therein a personal
ad offering a £10 reward for the
return of a very shaggy dog to its
owner in Bishop's Bowes, Essex.
Ten minutes later he stumbled
over the shaggiest damn pup you
tver saw. Being the kind of a

man who plays hunches, he promptly bundled the ca
nine under his arm, took the Twentieth Century to
New York, the Queen Mary to Southampton, and a
limousine to Bishop's Bowes.
In keen anticipation, he sought out the lady who had
advertised, and rang her bell. She answered herself.
"You lost a shaggy dog, madam," he reminded her,
holding up the pooch. "Would this be it?"
"Good heavens, no," she cried. "It wasn't THAT
; hai/gy"—and she slammed the door in his face.
Well, now that I've uncovered it, I'll take it back
; nd bury it.

From the Mailbag: English Instructor Jack Fink
contributed the following line which he overheard as
he passed by the locker-room on the way home from
the Stanford-Santa Clara football game. He figured
after hearing said statement that OURS is definitely

not a dese, dem, and dose squad. One oi Stanford's
battered, tough-looking linemen was remarking to a
teammate, "We had a sterling opportunity to win,
but we failed to capitalize on our opportunities;"
Okay, that's what the man said.

From Walt Gamage of the Palo Alto Times and his
column, Sport Shots: "Herbert Hoover certainly knew
what he was doing when he helped save the starving
Armenians after the first World War, for the Armen
ians certainly came back to save Stanford."

Big Game Week action has started already, as I
have inside word that a group of Stanford roughs,
using intricate plans, a platoon of four cars, and 32 gal
lons of paint, turned the Big "C" into a red blot last
Wednesday night when they invaded the Berkeley
Hills, without a casualty.

Finally, a little chart work concerning the psychol
ogy students:
HOW WE SEEM TO HOW WE SEEM
OURSELVES TO OTHEHS
retiring anti-social
cheerful frivolous
witty . corny
frank insulting
enthusiastic fanatical
just hard-hearted
funny peculiar

Let's face it, fans, if was really tough squeezing this
stuff out today. But at least, 1 didn't use a lousy gag
about mashing the Idaho potato. See you at the game.
