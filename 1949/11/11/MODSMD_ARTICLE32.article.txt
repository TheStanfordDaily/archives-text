# Village Shows Movie Sunday
## 
### 
Sunday night at Stanford Village
the Village Film Society will present
the sixth in the current Sunday
night "Art in Cinema" series.
The program wi I begin with the
unusual color film "Fiddle Dee Dee,"
in which the artist, Norman McLar
en, has painted his impressions of
the tune "Listen to the Mocking
Bird." The film has been called
rhythm in color and was awarded
first prize in the Music and Arts Di
vision of the World Festival ol Films
in Chicago.
Don Eikenberry, manager of the
series, reports that no camera was
used in the making of "Fiddle Dee
Dee." The process is as direct a:
that of an artist using pigment on
canvas and having it reproduced in
color.
Also selected by the film society
are excerpts from "Macbeth," with
Wilfred Lawson as Macbeth and
Kathleen Nesbitt as Lady Macbeth
In addition, the film classic "Lydia,"
with Merle Oberon and Joseph Cot
ten, will be presented.
