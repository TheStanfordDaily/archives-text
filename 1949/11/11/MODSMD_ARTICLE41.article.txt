# Daily Reporter Sees All; Fire Alarm Routs Roble
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
"Shade up, window down, light on,
door open — shade, window, light
There it went again, that enemy of
sandmen, the Roble fire alarm. The
quiet night, disturbed only by the
overtime chatter of three or four
typewriters, suddenly took on the
aspect of early morning as lights
flickered in the windows, lighting up
the front lawn.
LIGHTS, ACTION
Several slammed their windows
and then looked doubtfully across
the court where other girls were
flapping coats around them. In a
third-floor window one of the shades
remained down and the silhouetted
figure of the roomer inside went
through crazy gyrations as she
stormed about the room.
Inside the hall, the first maiden
rounded a corner and flopped into an
overstuffed chair, all set to finish the
dream that the fire bell had blotted
out.
Then more poured into the lobby;
at first they were quiet, and then
realizing their feminine responsibil
ity, they started to chatter.
About this time the curtains,
which shielded me from the drowsy
eyes of the bewildered Roble women,
became stuffy, so I peered out for a
breather.
FASHION, 2 A.M. VERSION
They looked like pickaninnies, with
little kinky sprouts of hair sticking
out of curlers and ribbons. Some of

the hair-dos obviously were styled
after Chief Black Hawk or Pow
hatan. Or maybe the precedent was
set by the Chinese who bound their
heads.
One who was standing in the cor
ner with a bandana cocked over one
eye, watched her roommate do deep
knee bends — certainly a Stoic at
tempt to demonstrate her waking-up
ability. I was impressed.
Some of the Roble inmates were
literally poured into huge overcoats;
most had abandoned the fur coat fad
which appeared earilcr in the fire
drill season. Replacing the furs were
a group of nondescript tweeds, gab
ardines, and red rain coats.
And Miss Hoyle, or whoever dic
tates fashion decorum on such oc
casions, would have been dismayed
with the crop of pajamas. They
weren't the gaudy broadcloths, or the
Chinese silks which lit up the streets
the night of the Pajamarino.
AND SO TO BED
Then came the "all-clear signal,"
and Lack up the steps they trudged—
this time in one big herd, with no
stragglers.
With all the fire captains, and lieu
tenants, and just plain privates sent
back to the beds, the leader of them
all scratched her head as she marked
3 minutes and 20 seconds on her
mind—no doubt thinking of the next
time when the girls must knock off
those 20 extra clicks of the second
hand.
But please, Dody, don't make it 2
a.m. next time!
