# Art Students Hear Neutra On Education

"All professions arc training peo
ple for metropolitan locations. This
is a terrible indictment of univer
sities," Richard Neutra told a group
of students in the Art Department
yesterday.
Neutra, an outstanding architect,
warned of Ihe trend in education
that draws people to trade centers,
confines them to concentrated areas.
This is a challenge to architects, he
said, because they are "engaged to
expand the human habitat."
Another unique observation on
education was that although a stu
dent's judgment is something to be
cultivated, "there are things to be
learned and the other must wait."
Neutra named as the first essential
of education perfcct confidence in
the teacher. He questioned the value
of a student's doubting a 'cellist or
brain surgeon during his instruction
in 'cello playing or brain surgery.
Applying this to Frank Lloyd
Wright's method of teaching, he said,
"The trouble is . . . he produces
people who are inspired. They are
not necessarily capable. They are
seldom geniuses."
Neutra, whose designs stretch
from the Los Angeles suburbs to
Italy to the Far East, said the archi
tect should be 95 per cent educator.
Beyond building a house or housing
project, the architect should explain
the requirements for living with it,
"so people will take the pride in it
they take in their new Buick."
Asked his opinion of Stern Hall,
Neutra would commit himself no
further than: "It is—it is—an at
tempt to break away from the tra
ditional."
