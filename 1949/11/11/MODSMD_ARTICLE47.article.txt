# Pickers Name Indians, Bears, Bruins, and Irish
## 
### 
The Peerless Pickers were thrown
for another lon« loss last week, and
we're about ready to kick and send
hi the defensive platoon.
Maybe it's the Stanford spirit we
hear so much about, maybe it's
stubbornness, and maybe it's just
plain stupidity, but we're buck for
more. To reverse an old line, you
can't lose all the time.
For the record, the season's aver
age now stands at .727. That's pret
ty poor, but we have one consolation
in that we were practically the only
sheet to predict the Coliseum upset
last Saturday.
We handed out five bum steers,
however, and the average dropped
by a couple of percentage points.
fn any event, there's always a
chance that the department lias a
little readership left; so here we go
again:
Stanford - Idaho: The men who
make the odds give the Vandals 28
points and a recommendation to re
turn to their potato-picking. The
pickers are a little more conserva
! tive: 20 points and a request not to
damage any of our boys for the
Big Game.
Cal-Oregon: Number one on the
list of upsets we'd most like to see.
Grudgingly, Ca! by 10.
UCLA-Washington: Number two
on said list. If they were playing in
Seattle, we'd call the Huskies. But
in the Coliseum, it's the Bruins by
O
Oregon State - Michigan State.
j Those who should know say that
Michigan State gave Notre Dame its
hardest battle of the year. That's
M ood enough for us. Michigan State
by 21.
Minnesota - Pittsburgh: Minnesota
will have two scouts viewing the
Stanford-Idaho game. Thank you,
Minn, and we'll return the compli
ment: Gophers by 14. •
Michigan - Indiana: We've seen
Ortmann. Michigan by 21. .
Notre Dame - North Carolina:
Choo - Choo, you ain't got enough
steam." The Irish should do it by 20.
In other West Coast battles, the
Pickers like Santa Clara over St.
Mary's by 11 in the Little Big Game,
' and USF by 14 over Tulsa.

In the East, it's Brown seven
points better than Harvard; Prince
ton by 14 over Yale; Army to
trounce Penn by 16; and Cornell by
15 over Dartmouth.
The major Southeastern contest
of the clay will see Georgia Tech trip
Alabama by 4, or so say (he Pickers.
In the Southwest, it's Texas by 13
over TCU; Rice by 10 over Texas
A&M; and SMU by 8 over Arkansas.
Ohio State and Wisconsin are
tabbed to take the Big Nine cru
cials, the Buckeyes by 7 over Illi
nois and the Badgers by (J over lowa.
And the parting shot: Oklahoma
by 14 over Missouri.

ment: Gophers by 14. •
Michigan - Indiana: We've seen
Ortmann. Michigan by 21. .
Notre Dame - North Carolina:
Choo - Choo, you ain't got enough
steam." The Irish should do it by 20.
In other West Coast battles, the
Pickers like Santa Clara over St.
Mary's by 11 in the Little Big Game,
' and USF by 14 over Tulsa.

In the East, it's Brown seven
points better than Harvard; Prince
ton by 14 over Yale; Army to
trounce Penn by 16; and Cornell by
15 over Dartmouth.
The major Southeastern contest
of the clay will see Georgia Tech trip
Alabama by 4, or so say (he Pickers.
In the Southwest, it's Texas by 13
over TCU; Rice by 10 over Texas
A&M; and SMU by 8 over Arkansas.
Ohio State and Wisconsin are
tabbed to take the Big Nine cru
cials, the Buckeyes by 7 over Illi
nois and the Badgers by (J over lowa.
And the parting shot: Oklahoma
by 14 over Missouri.
The Peerless Pickers were thrown
for another lon« loss last week, and
we're about ready to kick and send
hi the defensive platoon.
Maybe it's the Stanford spirit we
hear so much about, maybe it's
stubbornness, and maybe it's just
plain stupidity, but we're buck for
more. To reverse an old line, you
can't lose all the time.
For the record, the season's aver
age now stands at .727. That's pret
ty poor, but we have one consolation
in that we were practically the only
sheet to predict the Coliseum upset
last Saturday.
We handed out five bum steers,
however, and the average dropped
by a couple of percentage points.
fn any event, there's always a
chance that the department lias a
little readership left; so here we go
again:
Stanford - Idaho: The men who
make the odds give the Vandals 28
points and a recommendation to re
turn to their potato-picking. The
pickers are a little more conserva
! tive: 20 points and a request not to
damage any of our boys for the
Big Game.
Cal-Oregon: Number one on the
list of upsets we'd most like to see.
Grudgingly, Ca! by 10.
UCLA-Washington: Number two
on said list. If they were playing in
Seattle, we'd call the Huskies. But
in the Coliseum, it's the Bruins by
O
Oregon State - Michigan State.
j Those who should know say that
Michigan State gave Notre Dame its
hardest battle of the year. That's
M ood enough for us. Michigan State
by 21.

Stanford-Idaho game. Thank you,
