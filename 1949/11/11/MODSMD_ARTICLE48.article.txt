tailback Charlie Justice said today
"It doesn't look like I'll play" Sat
urday against Notre Dame in New
York.
Coach Carl Snavely said the pres
ent condition of Justice's bad ankle
"means that Charlie won't play."
"However," Snavely added, "in
juries of this type sometimes re
spond to treatment more quickly
than expected."
Justice p'ayed for some time last
week against William and Mary af
ter he had received the injury.
"After 11 years of playing foot
ball," Justice said, "it's really
tough to miss the game you've al
ways dreamed of playing. It will be
the first game I have ever missed
because of an injury."
Justice said his ankle felt "all
right when I walk on it, but it
really hurts when I try to run."
