# Veteran Tackles Kiilsgaar Overgaard Lead Idahoan
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The 37-strong Idaho traveling squad which Coach Dixie
brings to town this afternoon has established a markedly
luster record in its gridiron dealings this season.
But a quick survey of the personnel of the squad reveals <
a few individual stars who could make trouble for the Inc

tomorrow. 1
The Vandals are particularly po
tent in the backtield, as is well at
tested by (he fact that Idaho cQr
rently leads the Conference in the
matter of rushing offense and is sec
ond only to Cal's Golden Bears in
total offense.
It is in the line, and mainly the
center of the line, that most of How
ell's headaches originate. Dixie's
centers and guards are light and in
experienced. And while the first
string tackles are perfectly capable
of handling themselves, this posi
tion suffers from lack of depth.
But let's take a look at the situa
tion position by position:
End —This ]>osition was consider
ably bolstered by the return this
year of Orville Barnes, G-ft. 4-in.
pass snagger who played an impor
tant role in the 1947 upset of Stan
ford. Barnes went on to place 12th
in the nation in pass receiving in
1947, but took a leave of absence in
1948.
The other wingmen who will carry
George Ballew and Dick LeDuC,
both (5 ft. 2 in. and capable receivers.
Tackle — Howell has a> couple of
three-year lettermen here but not
much to back them up. The names
of the veteran duo are Kiilsgaard
and Overgaard.
They're both seniors, G ft. 3 in.
tall, and weigh 220 pounds. You can
tell them apart because Carl Kiils
gaard will do the coin-flipping for
the northerners. He's the captain of
the team.
Guard—Here's where the Vandal
trouble starts. Steve Douglas, who
played GO minutes at right guard
against Oregon State last week, is a
5-ft. 10-in. sophomore who shows
promise but definitely isn't big time
yet.
Roy Colquitt and Tom Trees, who
trade off at the left guard slot, have
the experience; but they, too, lack
the weight a lineman needs.
Center—Here, again, the lack of
poundage is apparent. Tom Am
brose, a two - year letter winner,
shares the duties with Verne Bax
ter. They're good men. bnt both are
under the 200-pound mark.
Quarterback — Strength plus in
this position. Ted Diehl generally
starts; he's the main mastermind of
Howell's "Maybe -T" attack. But
Jim Hammond, like Diehl a two
year letterman, is also a mighty
adroit ball handler.
Then there's Max Glaves, who is
the top passer on the team in his
sophomore year.
And it's possible we still haven't
named the !ad who will start tomor
row; for Keith Bean, a 175-pounder
from a town called Sweet, Idaho, got
the initial nod against OSC last
week and could be the top man to
morrow.
Halfback — Speed, speed, speed.
John Brogan and Jim Hatch are the
first two; but Jerry Diehl, Bob
Mays, and Glen Christian are also
constant breakaway threats.
Every one of these lads has bro
ken loose for at least one long scor
ing jaunt this season. They're the
ones to watch tomorrow; they've got
what it takes to upset our rose cart.
Fullback—A sophomore, Ken Lar
sen, leads the pack here. Ken is G
ft. 2 in., 197 pounds, and he's the
knee-action type of fullback.
Another sophomore, A 1 Shireman.
and junior King Block will spell
Larsen when necessary.

It is in the line, and mainly the
center of the line, that most of How
ell's headaches originate. Dixie's
centers and guards are light and in
experienced. And while the first
string tackles are perfectly capable
of handling themselves, this posi
tion suffers from lack of depth.
But let's take a look at the situa
tion position by position:
End —This ]>osition was consider
ably bolstered by the return this
year of Orville Barnes, G-ft. 4-in.
pass snagger who played an impor
tant role in the 1947 upset of Stan
ford. Barnes went on to place 12th
in the nation in pass receiving in
1947, but took a leave of absence in
1948.
The other wingmen who will carry
George Ballew and Dick LeDuC,
both (5 ft. 2 in. and capable receivers.
Tackle — Howell has a> couple of
three-year lettermen here but not
much to back them up. The names
of the veteran duo are Kiilsgaard
and Overgaard.
They're both seniors, G ft. 3 in.
tall, and weigh 220 pounds. You can
tell them apart because Carl Kiils
gaard will do the coin-flipping for
the northerners. He's the captain of
the team.
Guard—Here's where the Vandal
trouble starts. Steve Douglas, who
played GO minutes at right guard
against Oregon State last week, is a
5-ft. 10-in. sophomore who shows
promise but definitely isn't big time
yet.
Roy Colquitt and Tom Trees, who
trade off at the left guard slot, have
the experience; but they, too, lack
the weight a lineman needs.
Center—Here, again, the lack of
poundage is apparent. Tom Am
brose, a two - year letter winner,
shares the duties with Verne Bax
ter. They're good men. bnt both are
under the 200-pound mark.
Quarterback — Strength plus in
this position. Ted Diehl generally
starts; he's the main mastermind of
Howell's "Maybe -T" attack. But
Jim Hammond, like Diehl a two
year letterman, is also a mighty
adroit ball handler.
Then there's Max Glaves, who is
the top passer on the team in his
sophomore year.
And it's possible we still haven't
named the !ad who will start tomor
row; for Keith Bean, a 175-pounder
from a town called Sweet, Idaho, got
the initial nod against OSC last
week and could be the top man to
morrow.
Halfback — Speed, speed, speed.
John Brogan and Jim Hatch are the
first two; but Jerry Diehl, Bob
Mays, and Glen Christian are also
constant breakaway threats.
Every one of these lads has bro
ken loose for at least one long scor
ing jaunt this season. They're the
ones to watch tomorrow; they've got
what it takes to upset our rose cart.
Fullback—A sophomore, Ken Lar
sen, leads the pack here. Ken is G
ft. 2 in., 197 pounds, and he's the
knee-action type of fullback.
Another sophomore, A 1 Shireman.
and junior King Block will spell
Larsen when necessary.
The 37-strong Idaho traveling squad which Coach Dixie
brings to town this afternoon has established a markedly

tomorrow. 1
