# '53 Water Poloists Challenge Cal Cubs
## 
### 
The Papoose water poloists will
write the Pnal and most important
chapter to their impressive season
tomorrow morning at 10 in Eneina
Pool.
With a record of seven wins in
eight starts, the Yearlings will be
out to avenge their only defeat suf
fered so far, against the Berkeley
Bear Cubs. The Cubs were on the
long end of a 10 to 7 count several
weeks ago in a hard-fought game
up at the victors' home pool.
The improved Cardbabes hope to
stop the pressing offensive the Cubs
showed; especially the accuracy ol
such men as and Pollisier,
who scored four telling points each
in the last encounter.
Pete Col? and Irwin Johnson of
the frosh have led the scoring pa
rade all season and will be relied
on again tomorrow to carry the
brunt of the offensive.
