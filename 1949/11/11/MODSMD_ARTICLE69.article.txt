# 'Pinky' Shows Realistic Moral Choice
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
A "moral choice" confronts most
of the heroes of stage dramas, but
rarely in the movies is a leading
character allowed to resolve a ma
jor problem. The film is usually
neatly stacked so that only one
choice may he made.
The fact that the heroine of
"Pinky," now playing at the Stan
ford Theater, makes what is closest
to a moral choice that Hollywood

allows is another
gold star pasted
on a film that is
entitled to quite
a few.
From the time
Pinky, who has
passed for white,
returns to her
dirty Negro

home in the South until she decides
whether to stay or return North,
there is a possibility that she may
decide cither way. Story complica
tions, such as the illness of an old
white aristocrat, do not twist her

decision; they merely delay it for
several reels.
The film's second gold star is
jumbo size. The most vulgar, most
disliked character in the picture is
a Negro. Intolerance is such a com
bustible subject that Catholics, Ne
groes, Jews, and other minority
groups have only been portrayed as
honest, honorable, kindly members
of a community. This is as obviously
ridiculous as the view that all Ne
groes arc illiterate, lazy manual la
borers.
Unfortunately gold stars do not
peep from each of the picture's film
strips. A Hollywood ending, com
plete with cheerful bells and the
happy faces of innocent children,
makes the audience choke on its
popcorn.
Several discussions about God,
contrived moonlight strolls, and
mournful train whistles would have

been better 011 the cutting room
floor. And, unfortunately, flaws in
an above-average picture are twice
as noticeable as holes in a horse
oater.
Acting on the part of Jeanne
Crain, Ethel Barryniorc, and at
times Ethel Waters is impressive.
The use of sounds — particularly
during Pinky's first night home—is
superior to any Hollywood film of
the year.
All in all, Director Kazan has
made a pictui'e far superior to the
saccharine and sticky "Gentleman's
Agreement" for which he won the
Academy Award two years back.
