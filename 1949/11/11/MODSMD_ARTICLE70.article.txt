### 
Students who park their auto
biles in the lot between Encina Hall
and the Hoover Library do so in
violation of University parking reg
ulations, Policc Chief Gordon Davis
warned yesterday.
"This lot is not a designated park
ing area, and citations will be issued
if drivers continue to park there,"
Davis said.
Many drivers who have received
citations for this and other violations
have failed to report to the policc
station.
Failure to settle the citation with
the Policc Department within three
days may result in a penalty being
added to the original fine. If car
ried over until the end of a quarter
there will be delay in the student's
registration until he has paid the
fine.
Chief Davis announced that he
will soon begin sending postal cards
reminding tardy violators of their
citation. Anyone receiving this no
tice will have to pay the overdue
penalty.
Drivers are urged to bring in their
citations as soon as they arc rc
ccivcd, and to check glove compart
ments for old citations that may
have been forgotten.
