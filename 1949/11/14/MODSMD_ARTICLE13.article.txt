### 
(Editor's Note: The following contract was made by the ASSU presi
dent and the ASUC president last year at Big Game time. Student Body
President Hank Rnsin reminds all students that this non-aggression pact
with California is still in effect.)
In order to avoid any occurrence that might endanger the
friendly relations that have existed between our Universities for
so many years, and in order to maintain the fine sportsmanship
that has been the tradition of our "Big Game," we, the represen
tatives of our student bodies, so hereby resolve:
(a) That there shall be no "invasions" by the students of either
University of the campus of the other, and that students partici
pating in such violations will be subject to severe discipline.
(b) That each student body will undertake to educate its mem
bers in the weeks preceding the "Big Game" to observe the spirit
of the foregoing resolution, and to exercise every possible mea
sure to prevent any incident arising that may lead to its violation.
