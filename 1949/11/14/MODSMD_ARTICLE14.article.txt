### 
Final elections will be held Wednesday for the officcs of Men's Council
member and graduate Excom representative. ,

the Men's Council race to have been a primary, and held the results of
the other contest invalid.

ballot, plus the top two write-in can-*
didates, will be on the final ballot.
Charges of illegal electioneering

winning candidate, he could not be
disqualified. For these reasons, Ex

again.
Both elections will be conducted on
the preferential system.
