# SIRO Drive Lengthened
## 
### 
The Stanford Relief Drive is being
! extended for another week. The rea
son for this, according to Pat Terry,
drive co-chairman, is that receipts
from the drive so far total only $2,800
j â€”almost $10,000 short of the $12,000
| goal.
Many solicitors still have not
turned in their envelopes. Miss Terry
urges that they do so at once. En
velopes may be turned in every
| afternoon from 3:30 to 5:15, down-
I stairs in the Women's Clubhouse.
The main reason she gave, how
! ever, for the low total at the end of
, the week, is that many members of
the student body simply have not
contributed or signed pledges yet.
She reminded them that they need
I not donate any money now. Stu
dents may sign pledges to pay any
i time between today and February 1.
Only two living groups have gone
100 per cent in contributions. These
j are Branner and Lathrop. Few re
l ceipts have come in from off-campus
i students yet. Men's fraternities are
lowest on the list. Many have made
no reports or donations at all.
A booth where off-campus students
may pay pledges will be in operation
again this week every day from 9 to
3 in front of the Cellar.
Proceeds from the student-faculty
talent show Saturday night made up
about $450 of the total funds collected
to date. Pat Terry stated that she felt
j the show was a success, not only from
that, standpoint, but also as enter
tainment.
"The audience was very receptive,"
i she said, "and the professors were
I wonderful as peanut vendors and ice
cream salesmen .... not to mention
the talent they displayed on the
, stage."
