# Give 'Em the Axe
## 
### 
Although the axe yell has been given just
once this season, there has been plenty of dis
pute and confusion regarding its use.
There are at least two schools of thought on
the matter. One group wants the yell reserved
for use at the Big Game only. Others think it
should be given in any game where the team
needs that extra "push."
Clearly, the yell should not be given indis
criminately. A large part of its effectiveness
comes from the fact that it is not used often.
Another factor limiting its use is the time
element. Since the yell is long, it can be given
only in time-outs or between quarters.
We missed more than one good chance to
give the yell. In the UCLA game, for instance.
The Bruins were leading by a and
Stanford had the ball — first and 10 on the
UCLA 40.

UCLA took time out, giving us a perfect
chance for the axe yell. Yet, when Dean Borba
asked the rooting section if they wanted to
give it, he got answer of "No-No."
If that wasn't a time for the yell, what is?
How "sacred" is the axe yell, anyway? Cal
uses it against us, and a good many high
schools use it regularly. Why should Stan
ford, the originator of the yell, restrict its use
to one game a year?
Frankly, this seems silly to us. It's our yell;
let's use it. Not in the "easy" games, like last
Saturday. But give it in a tight spot in any
close game when time permits.
The matter should be settled long before
next fall. Let's not spend another season argu
ing about using the yell; in 1950, let's "give
'em-the-axe!" —M.H.
