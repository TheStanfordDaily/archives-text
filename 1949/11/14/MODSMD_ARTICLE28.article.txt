# CAMPUS OPINION
## Relief Drive 
### 
To the Editor:
"For a people richly endowed with the blessings of
life and in a position of world leadership, Americans
lu< k a sen.se of-resporisibility." This comment, which
112 had heard uttered by Americans and non-Americans
alike, remained a moot question in my mind until the
onset of the SIRO drive; now I am afraid I would avree.
What is meant by a "sense of responsibility?" It is a
quality more easily illustrated than defined. It is pres
ent in the case of the Chinese students who, themselves
exit ting on one bowl of rice per day, worked to con
tribute $4,000 for World Student Relief. It is present in
the needy Polish students who have held part-time
jobs and given as much as IG-hours-worth of their
weekly pay to student relief agencies. It exisLs in the
person of Naseem Beg, a Pakistanian law student who
forsook his studies in order to devote all of his time to
relief work, and is now on the verge of tuberculosis
from lack of food and sleep.
To what extent does this quality exist at Stanford?
It is absent in the case of the Stanford student who,
existing on three nourishing meals per day, refuses to
contribute the price of one dinner at Dinah's to the
s'ine cause. "Give a buck, then pass the buck" is the
typical sentiment here. On the other hand, many of us
Mavo as much as 50 cents to send our band to Seattle.
'I hat means, in material terms, that the condition of
our fellow students and consequently the kind of
world we're going to live in, means only twice as much
to ns a:: the presence of our band at an off-campus
football game for three hours on a Saturday afternoon.
Doe;- all thi make sense in your terms? It doesn't
in mine!
