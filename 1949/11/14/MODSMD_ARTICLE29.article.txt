To the Editor:
Now that Sigmund Engel is out of the way. the time
ha* wiiiie, 1 feel, to turn our attentions lo tiie bandit
n • 'M.nsihk- for the graft, fraud, and misrepresentation
in the operation of the so-called Village Film Society.
My mounting ire reached its boiling point last Sun
day night, when I was unfortunate enough to attend
what turned out to be, among other outrages, a fourth
rate cartoon plainly labeled (!) "For Home Use Only—
Commercial Use Forbidden By Law."
And since my good American money is irretriev
ably tied up in a season ticket, I face the prospect of
vitting through several other low-grade atrocities
(which the "management" has exercised its "discre
tion" in substituting for thr> films advertised when 112
bought the ticket) or staying away, altogether which
I shall probably do.
Foi the benefit of those who may not know about
Ihi.-; neat little swindle, however, l.e forewarned:
