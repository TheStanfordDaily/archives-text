# Election Rally
## 
### 
To tlic- Editor:
Let's call this sour apples, however, I want it under
stood that this is written before the election, but the
complaint still stands, win, lose, or draw.
Election Board decided to have a rally for the candi
dates for M n's Council and graduate representative
to Kxcom, this I believe was thought up according to
the member there approximately one weak before it
was to be-Â«taged. The total publicity for this rally was
a short insert in jin article in the Tuesday (November
8) Daily, and a piece of binder paper with the notice
over the dcoi of the Village dining hall.
I realize that there is a great deal of unfortunate
apathy toward elections, however, I don't believe this
accounts for the attendance of only one (1) person,
who showed up 20 minutes late, after the candidates
present decided that it was just so much wasted time,
and had left, and the member of Election Board had
taken down the loudspeaker and locked up the audi
torium.
Oddly enough, this person who had turned up was
a member of the Village Activities Committee, who
said that that organization had not even been notified,
and that he had seen the notice at the dining hall. He
had a legitimate* reason for hi:, tardiness, which he

surely didn't need.
I will say that the idea of having it at the Village
was good, but the time conflicted with the Tuesday
Evening Series (effectively, although not in hours) a
talk and slides on pack trips by a man at the Village,
which sounded very interesting, and also at least one
house meeting that I know of.
Personally, I think something much more effective
could have been, and should be in the future, arranged.
