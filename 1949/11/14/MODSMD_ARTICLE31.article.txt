# Parking Regulations

To the Editor:
About a year ago Police Chief Davis warned that all
cars parked in the strip between the Temporary Build
ings and the Main Library parking lot would be tagged
for parking violations. The story was that "adequate
room must be left for fire engines to go between the
buildings." Okay, we swallowed that one.
Now we are warned about the lot behind the Hoover
Library. What's the reason this time? Don't give us
the old fire-engine gag again.
It is perfectly apparent that there is not adequate
parking space on the campus. I have spent 10 minutes
some mornings looking for a place to park ("Ijeave it
home?" I live in Menlo Park). It would seem that if
students U*ke the risk of getting their cars stuck in the
mud in such lots, that is their worry, not Davis'.
If there is some sensible reason for not parking in
this lot, let us in on it, Gordy. "Not a designated park
ing area" sounds to me very like "keep off the grass."
It seems that 1 read somewhere that the function of
the police is to service the citizenâ€”well, I'm a citizen.
Is this service?
