To the Editor:
Printed on page one of the Friday Daily is an article
"Encina Freshmen Retaliate, Cal "C" Painted Cardinal
Red."
'n the course of this article it is casually commented
"During the painting an empty car was knocked over
and it went rattling down the hill." No further com
ment is made.
This writer is vitally interested in ascertaining if
the type of inexcusable, hoodlum vandalism is con
doned by the Daily as "School Spirit," a supposedly
laudable, harmless competitive atmosphere of Stan
lord, might conceivably wish their paper to take a
definite stand on such an important issue that today
was seemingly glossed over.
