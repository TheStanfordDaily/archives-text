# student-Faculty Show

### 
To the Editor:
We'd like to take this chance to say a few words
about a wonderful show. Tlwit show was the SlRO
sponsorcd Student-Faculty production. It was pre
sented Saturday night in the Ed Aud as a charity af
fair for the current SIRO' drive.
Performed before a very small segment of the Farm
student body, it was one of the greatest. Not only was
it wood entertainment and an enjoyable experience, but
it was still another show of the now supposedly for
gotten Stanford Spirit.
While students and your columnists have been en
gaged in a continual crossfire of words over the Rally
Com, the lack of spirit in the stands at ball games, and
general absence of that old moxie called Stanford Spirit
on the Farm campus, a few of us were given a big
shot in the arm. The way Dr. Winbigler and his wife.
Deans Kinipton, Brown, and Balch, and all the pro
fetors joined in and let go wilh a whole of a show,
actively demonstrated that we're very lucky to have
such a terrific group of administrators and faculty.
There aren't too many universities that would have
put on such a Student-Faculty show.
What with the Big Game coming up and everything
in general on the Farm returning to where it should
be, let's show ourselves that we've still got the old
Stanford Spirit. Because, for sure, our administration
and faculty have it and aren't afraid fo show it.
