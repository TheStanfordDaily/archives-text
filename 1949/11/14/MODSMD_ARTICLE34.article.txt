FRESHMEN ARE URGED to come out and help build the bonfire in Lake Lagunita this afternoon
and every afternoon at 1 this week. Work began in earnest yesterday afternoon on the pyre,
which is to be lighted at the Big Game rally Thursday night. Following a meeting in the En
cina lounge at noon yesterday, frosh put the bottom framework and braces on the fire, and the
draughts were completed. Freshman women did their part in encouraging the men to work.
At 3:30, a group of women drove past Encina with horns blaring urging the freshmen to work.
