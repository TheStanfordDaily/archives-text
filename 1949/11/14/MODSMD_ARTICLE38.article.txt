# Cal Raiders Caught; Shaved by Freshmen
## 
### 
Four Cal men with shaved heads
were the fruit of the frosh campus
policing early Saturday morning.
Spotted near the stadium by a car
load of '53 guards, the intruders
were rounded up and sent to Encina
where the barbers went to work.
Freshmen Dick Borda, John Brod
erick, Skip Crist, Boh Mathias, and
Doug Pinto were the efficient po
licemen. They said that Mathias first
noticed some persons climbing over
the stadium fence as the group drive
past about 1:30 Saturday morning.
During an interrogation, the Cal
men claimed they were from Paly
High, and that they didn't really
mean to do anything.
Because the intruders couldn't
identify Crist, who was a Paly High
iootball star last year, the frosh
started to take them over to En
cina. At that ime, one of the raiders
balked and tried to escape. In the
ensuing struggle he was hurt, and
taken to the hospital.
In the Encina lounge, the other
three were well barbered.
Early Sunday morning other in
truders were caught and sljaved, but
it was learned later they were from
Paly High. "This was a regrettable
error," said Freshman President
Dick Weismann, "but they were
raising a disturbance, and they could
not positively prove they were not
from Berkeley."

To report any Cal raiders, call
DA .1-8975 or DA 3-8884. These
are the pay phones in Encina lob
by, so keep ringing until your call
