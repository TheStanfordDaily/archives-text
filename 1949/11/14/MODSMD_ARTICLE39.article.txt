It was with clean, workmanlike, almost professional precision that Cali
fornia beat Oregon, 41 to 14. The job was done in such a manner that any
Stanford men in the crowd of 78,000 could only sit back and wonder.
This 1945) Cal team is, in my opinion, better than either the 1947 or '48
teams. It is more rounded, stronger on defense, and has a passing attack
that the other teams lacked. All this was present Saturday, though quar
terback Bob Celeri was available for only part time duty.

About this guy Celeri. I hadn't seen him play since the Rose Bowl, and
couldn't quite believe that he was all the sports writers have claimed. Satur
day, bad leu or not, he was darn good.
lie hides the ball with the best of the collegians. lie limped back to throw
his passes, was rushed rather well, but still completed them when they
rountd. A well Celeri will give the Cards no end of trouble. A slightly
gimpy Celeri will do.
Cal was and is not 27 points belter than Oregon. But, as one scout in the
Cal press box remarked, "This Cal team amazes me, it is only as good as
it has to be." That just about sums it up.
Good Breaks
Those three quick touchdowns, three in a little over two minutes, come by
breaks. But it is only fair to say that Cal's defensive line put the pressure
on that caused the breaks. A 19-yard Oregon kick gave the Bears the ball
nn the Oregon 20. One gilt.
An Oregon fumble, (Referee Jim Cain gave with a slow whistle on this one)
MiiVe Cal the ball on Oregon's 17-yard line. Another TD followed.
Behind, 114 to 14, Oregon gambled on a pass Irom its own 29. Cal's Eric
Sehultz intercepted and went 32 yards for the third score in two minutes.
That is the kind of ball club the Bears will throw at Stanford on Saturday.
It is an explosive team. Jim Monachino is a halfback de-luxe. He works
oh-so-well on the quick openers. He averaged 9.1! yards on nine carries.
But the item in the Bear attack that must have frightened every Stanford
nan in the Stadium was the passing arm of one Bob Celeri. He hit lelt end
l)i,n Begovich on the Otto Graham special- down 10 or 15 yards, cut to the
sideline, and get the ball just before you go out of bounds. Begovich is
,' ix-one and 19f>. That play may cause M. Schwartz and Company much,
much trouble. Celeri also used it on Cal's first touchdown.
Are Tliey Offsides?
Let me here enter the argument about Cal's line charge. Either Cal has
the best timing of any team I have ever seen, or they are offside on nine out
</l 10 plays. 1 think they are offside. The whole line leans with the snap of
ih« ball; the ends seem to be off before the ball. The calling of this infrac
tion was spotty and inconsistent. This point will come up during and after
the Big Game.
Cal is a sound team. Its defenisve unit rushed Oregon's passer from start
tu finish. 1 wondered all through the game —how will Stanford's pass pro
tection work against the likes of Len Jones, Bobby Dobbs, anil company.
'I he Bear defense shifted from an overshifted six to a straight six to a five
three, etc. The linebackers filled in well. Any runs through the line will
have to be quick, sine, and with excellent blocking.
Cal flanked the Duck ends rather well. Stanford's ends will be another
story.
Now That Big Game
In fact, the whole Big Game will be another story. The Big Game is the
Great Equalizer. Cal should be favored by 12 to 14 points. Oddsmakers re
member the '47 and '48 odds and are acting thusly.
Notwithstanding the fact that Cal has 25 seniors on the squad—veterans
almost to the man —Stanford's relatively younger team can beat the Bears.
But it will take the supreme effort.
As the one and only Dink Templeton said at halftime, '"They (the Bears)
don't scare me."
They do scare me. I don't think they scare the Cards, though.
