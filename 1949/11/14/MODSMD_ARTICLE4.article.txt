### 
WASHINGTON -A B-17 carrying
Vice-President Barkley came within
50 feet of a collision with an ad
vertising blimp over the Pentagon
Thursday night, Boiling Air Force
Base disclosed tonight.
Barkley's plant was near a landing
at National Airport en route from
Paducah, Kentucky. It passed so
near the top of the blimp that the
exhaust flashes from the B-17's en
gines reflected from the skin of the
gas bag.
