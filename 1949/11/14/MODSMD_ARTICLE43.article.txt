# Cal Bears Sink Tankers, 5-2
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
After beating the Olympic Club
5 to 3 Thursday, and outscoring El
Camino Junior College 12 to 8 on
Friday, the Stanford varsity water
polo team dropped a hard-fought 5
to 2 decision to the PCC champs,
the California Bears, last Saturday.
After two Cal tallies early in the
first half, Card captain Ken Fox
dribbled the length of the pool to
put in a goal for the Indians, which
made the score 2 to 1.
However, a few seconds before the
end of the half, a 75-foot shot by
Cal's Herb Steiner drifted by the
Stanford goalie and increased the
Bears' lead to 3 to 1 at half time.
The Cards' only moment of glory
in the final two periods was forward
Don Weeden's beautiful 15-foot lob
shot over the outstretched arms of
Bear goalie Rod Lindquist early in
the fourth stanza. Two more Cal
goals made the final score read Cali
fornia 5. Stanford 2.
NEW CHAMPS
California's victory gave the Bears
the undisputed conference cham
pionship. Southern Cal placed sec
ond, Stanford third, and UCLA
fourth.
Thursday night's battle with the
Olympic Club in San Francisco
marked Stanford's first victory over
the club in four years of play. The
final score was 5 to 3 in favor of
the Cards.
In Friday afternoon's contest with
El Camino Junior College at Encina
Pool, Varsity Coach Tom Haynie
substituted freely in the Indians' 12
to 8 victory. This was the highest
total of points the Cards have scored
this season.
