# JV Gridders Crush SF, Get Set for Cal Ramblers
## 
### 
The Stanford junior varsity scored almost at will Saturday to spill the
San Francisco's State junior varsity, 4(i to 14. The lop-sided affair was a
preliminary game to the Indian-Idaho tilt in the Stanford Stadium.

+ Brave Coacli Jim Cox did not
suit his first-string players i'or this
game, with the exception of quar
terback Jack Bickel and lineman
j Owen Powell, who handled the day's
J place-kicking duties. Bickel played
j on offense during the first half and
j then gave the engineering post over
to Oliver Norville.
The first Brave tally came on the
second play of the game when half
back Bill McKay wiggled into the j
end zone from the opponents' 15.
FIRST OF TIIE BOBBLES
i
Powell's conversion was good, and j
the jayvees kicked off to State. A
minute later San Francisco Lobbied
the ball and Stanford recovered on
the visitors' 18 - yard line. Jerry
j Owens scored on a line buck. Pow
; ell failed on his conversion attempt.
The next Stanford score came in
the second period when the alert
Braves nabbed another fumble on
Stale's nine, and Gordy Chan drive
over for the points.
Still another State fumble and a
blocked kick paved the way for |
Stanford's two third-quarter scores.
McKay and Chan ran these over,
and Powell added both extra points.
SOME LONGIES TOO
In the final canto fullback Bill i
Eddy climaxed a 60-yard Brave
drive with the sixth Stanford tally.
Odens ended the day's performance
with a thrilling 70-yard jaunt be
hind fine blocking.
The visitors didn't get into the
scoring column until the last pe
riod when they racked up a pair of
touchdowns. The second of these
was a 70 - yard solo by Ronald
Bloom. Bloom's running, tackling,
and especially his vicious blocking
stood out in an otherwise weak
team. Wayne Allbie added the ex
tra points to both San Francisco
touchdowns.

scoring column until the last pe
riod when they racked up a pair of
touchdowns. The second of these
was a 70 - yard solo by Ronald
Bloom. Bloom's running, tackling,
and especially his vicious blocking
stood out in an otherwise weak
team. Wayne Allbie added the ex
tra points to both San Francisco
