# Rep. Douglas Favors 160-Acre Limit
## 
### 
The traditional 160-acre limit on
water rights should be retained,
Representative Helen Gahagan
Douglas said in a speech on Califor
nia water problems Friday niyht in
Memorial Hall.
The 160-acre limit, which makes
it impossible for a farmer to get

water from federal projects for more
than this amount of land, is a good
one, Mrs. Douglas said.
ALL SHOULD BENEFIT
She stated that all the people
should benefit from tax - supported
projects, such as the California Cen
tral Valley Authority, and that
large landholders should not be able
to gain the major part of the water
available.
In stressing the seriousness of the
California water problem, Repre
sentative Douglas 6aid that many
communities are already threatened
by not only the lack of low-cost ir
rigation, but of any available water
at all.
"In many places the wells arc
pumping air instead of water on
three out of four strokes," she add
ed, mentioning specifically Orange
Cove.

There is not enough water to go
around, she stated, and in saying
that the 160-acre limit, which was
imposed by Congress in 1904, should
be retained, she said she thought
more people would benefit if large
holders were not allowed to take
more than their share of the water.
CENTRAL VALLEY
The San Joaquin and the Sacra
mento Valleys must be considered
as one "central valley" in order to
make full use of water available,
Mrs. Douglas said.
Since the Sacramento Valley con
tains two-thirds of the water, and
the San Joaquin two-thirds of the
irrigable land, the water should be
stored for irrigation in dams such
as Friant.
A Central Valley Authority for
this 500-mile area will build reser
voirs and canals to irrigate at a low
cost the 3.000,000 acres of land not
now under cultivation.
INDUSTRY SUFFERS
Mrs. Douglas stressed the fact that
industry as well as griculture will
suffer if water and power plans are
not carried out. She gave the power
shortage of last winter as an ex
ample.
Mrs. Douglas, who is a represen
tative in Congress, praised Herbert
Hoover and former Representative
Richard C. Welch of San Francisco
for their work in this field.
Her talk was the second in a se
ries sponsored by Phi Delta Phi,

it impossible for a farmer to get

water from federal projects for more
than this amount of land, is a good
one, Mrs. Douglas said.
ALL SHOULD BENEFIT
She stated that all the people
should benefit from tax - supported
projects, such as the California Cen
tral Valley Authority, and that
large landholders should not be able
to gain the major part of the water
available.
In stressing the seriousness of the
California water problem, Repre
sentative Douglas 6aid that many
communities are already threatened
by not only the lack of low-cost ir
rigation, but of any available water
at all.
"In many places the wells arc
pumping air instead of water on
three out of four strokes," she add
ed, mentioning specifically Orange
Cove.

There is not enough water to go
around, she stated, and in saying
that the 160-acre limit, which was
imposed by Congress in 1904, should
be retained, she said she thought
more people would benefit if large
holders were not allowed to take
more than their share of the water.
CENTRAL VALLEY
The San Joaquin and the Sacra
mento Valleys must be considered
as one "central valley" in order to
make full use of water available,
Mrs. Douglas said.
Since the Sacramento Valley con
tains two-thirds of the water, and
the San Joaquin two-thirds of the
irrigable land, the water should be
stored for irrigation in dams such
as Friant.
A Central Valley Authority for
this 500-mile area will build reser
voirs and canals to irrigate at a low
cost the 3.000,000 acres of land not
now under cultivation.
INDUSTRY SUFFERS
Mrs. Douglas stressed the fact that
industry as well as griculture will
suffer if water and power plans are
not carried out. She gave the power
shortage of last winter as an ex
ample.
Mrs. Douglas, who is a represen
tative in Congress, praised Herbert
Hoover and former Representative
Richard C. Welch of San Francisco
for their work in this field.
Her talk was the second in a se
ries sponsored by Phi Delta Phi,
legal fraternity.
The traditional 160-acre limit on
water rights should be retained,
Representative Helen Gahagan
Douglas said in a speech on Califor
nia water problems Friday niyht in
Memorial Hall.
