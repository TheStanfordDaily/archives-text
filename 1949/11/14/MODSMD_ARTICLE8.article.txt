# Indians Smother Vandals In Nine-Touchdown Rout
## 
### JOHN HALL 
A three-way race to the death is all that's left of the 1919 foot
ball season.
It's a race that will be funneled into a wild, roaring finale next
Saturday when Stanford meets California in the Big Game, knd
when UCLA meets USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum.

Stanford, California, and UCLA set
the stage for this fiery finish when all
three ran past Conference opposition
last Saturday with slashing one-sided
victories.
The Cartls, with Dick Horn and
Tom Shaw waving mystic wands,
waltzed past Idaho's hapless Vandals,
here in the Stadium, with a nine
touchdown outburst to establish a
new Stanford Conference scoring
record, 63 to 0.
CAL, UCLA WIN
California, trailing 7 to 0 at the
end of the first quarter in Berkeley,
came back to blast Oregon from all
sides, 41 to 14, and UCLA, fresh and
eager after a week's "rest, muzzled
the Washington Husky, 47 to 26, in
Los Angeles.
So, the stage is set. The Big Game
rush is on, and the Rose Bowl —
among other things—is at stake.
At the moment, the Golden Bear is
in the driver's seat. But three things
could happen. First, all Cal needs is
another one-point Big Game win to
become automatic.
Second, the Cards will be a cinch
if they drop the Bears, and USC
whips the Bruins.
Third, the whole race will become
a scrambled mess if Stanford beats
Cal, and UCLA takes Troy. If that
happens, you can put on a blindfold,
flip a coin, and guess. That's all.
NO SERIOUS INJURIES
The Indians came out of the Idaho
romp in good shape, except for Ken
Peck's bruised knee and a Gordon
Rice shoulder injury. Otherwise, no
damage done.
Moreover, Gary Kcrkorians nine
straight conversions were sweet to
see, especially in the face of the two
previous Big Games (21-18 and 7-6),
which have been lost because of bad
toes.

Stanford could have punished Ida
ho even more severely if it had
wished. Instead, 42 griddcrs were
used, and only one pass was thrown
in the final quarter.
NINE TOUCHDOWNS
As it was, the scoring parade went
like this:
1. Dick Horn hit Ken Pose with a
bullet jump-pass from three yards
out. Eric Southwood's fine running
set up the score. .
2. Bill McColl made a jumping,
diving, rolling catch of Horn's 25-
! yard fling to land in the end zone.
Bill DcYoung had scampered 51 yards
to put the ball in position.
3. Harry Hugasian broke Idaho into
bits with a scries of slashing runs,
starting from his own 12. Harry
finally went over with a 9-yard
spurt around his own left end.
4. The officials got into the act this
time, Rave Stanford a pass-interfer
ence first down on the Vandal 15,
then called a personal foul on Idaho
and placed thn ball on the 2. Mitchell

rammed it over on the first try.
5. Harry Hugasian, slithered into
the secondary, and then went into
high gear, racing 74 yards for the .six
points.
0. Tom Sahw, with Vandals all over
his back, threw the nicest pass of the
afternoon, hitting Boyd Benson right
on the button in the end /.one from 26

yards away. Dick Gacdtki, Indian
tackle, had stolen the ball from Idaho
to put it in position.
7. Tow Shaw unlimbered again,
tossed first to Wilbur Taylor—nice
catch on the Idaho 12. Then, Tom hit
Dan Mervin, all by himself, in the
end zone with the payoff.
Craby Legs Bud Klien took Bob
May's punt on his own 45, walked a
tight-rope clown the sideline for 20
yards, then cut toward the middle,
danced past several pair of Vandal
arms, and scooted over the goal on
the end of a nice 55-yard runback. It
was the second week in a row that a
Stanford safety man has run back a
punt for a touchdown. More encour
agement.
9. Dan Mervin took a Shaw pass on
the 15, turned in some neat foot
work and romped untouched into
paydirt.
TWO TD's CALLED BACK
Besides those things, Bill DcYoung
ran 91 yards to a score, only to have
jl called back on a holding crime.
The same thing happened to Benson,
who went 21 for a touchdown, only
to have it erased because of offsides.
Rupc Andrews might have gone all
the way on one sprint, but he slipped
while trying to out-maneuver the
Idaho safety man, and had to settle
for 50 yards. Andrews, who owns the
best ball-packing average on the In
dian squad, has yet to score his first
1949 touchdown.
It was Stanford's .sixth win of the
season, their fourth shut,-out, and whs
their highest scoring total since they
pummeled UCLA. R2-0, in 1925.
Now, that Big Game.

Stanford safety man has run back a
punt for a touchdown. More encour
agement.
9. Dan Mervin took a Shaw pass on
the 15, turned in some neat foot
work and romped untouched into
paydirt.
TWO TD's CALLED BACK
Besides those things, Bill DcYoung
ran 91 yards to a score, only to have
jl called back on a holding crime.
The same thing happened to Benson,
who went 21 for a touchdown, only
to have it erased because of offsides.
Rupc Andrews might have gone all
the way on one sprint, but he slipped
while trying to out-maneuver the
Idaho safety man, and had to settle
for 50 yards. Andrews, who owns the
best ball-packing average on the In
dian squad, has yet to score his first
1949 touchdown.
It was Stanford's .sixth win of the
season, their fourth shut,-out, and whs
their highest scoring total since they
pummeled UCLA. R2-0, in 1925.
Now, that Big Game.
A three-way race to the death is all that's left of the 1919 foot
ball season.
It's a race that will be funneled into a wild, roaring finale next
Saturday when Stanford meets California in the Big Game, knd
when UCLA meets USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum.

Stanford, California, and UCLA set
the stage for this fiery finish when all
three ran past Conference opposition
last Saturday with slashing one-sided
victories.
The Cartls, with Dick Horn and
Tom Shaw waving mystic wands,
waltzed past Idaho's hapless Vandals,
here in the Stadium, with a nine
touchdown outburst to establish a
new Stanford Conference scoring
record, 63 to 0.
CAL, UCLA WIN
California, trailing 7 to 0 at the
end of the first quarter in Berkeley,
came back to blast Oregon from all
sides, 41 to 14, and UCLA, fresh and
eager after a week's "rest, muzzled
the Washington Husky, 47 to 26, in
Los Angeles.
So, the stage is set. The Big Game
rush is on, and the Rose Bowl —
among other things—is at stake.
At the moment, the Golden Bear is
in the driver's seat. But three things
could happen. First, all Cal needs is
another one-point Big Game win to
become automatic.
Second, the Cards will be a cinch
if they drop the Bears, and USC
whips the Bruins.
Third, the whole race will become
a scrambled mess if Stanford beats
Cal, and UCLA takes Troy. If that
happens, you can put on a blindfold,
flip a coin, and guess. That's all.
NO SERIOUS INJURIES
The Indians came out of the Idaho
romp in good shape, except for Ken
Peck's bruised knee and a Gordon
Rice shoulder injury. Otherwise, no
damage done.
Moreover, Gary Kcrkorians nine
straight conversions were sweet to
see, especially in the face of the two
previous Big Games (21-18 and 7-6),
which have been lost because of bad
toes.

Stanford could have punished Ida

in the final quarter.
NINE TOUCHDOWNS
As it was, the scoring parade went
like this:
1. Dick Horn hit Ken Pose with a
bullet jump-pass from three yards
out. Eric Southwood's fine running
set up the score. .
2. Bill McColl made a jumping,
diving, rolling catch of Horn's 25-

Bill DcYoung had scampered 51 yards
to put the ball in position.
3. Harry Hugasian broke Idaho into
bits with a scries of slashing runs,
starting from his own 12. Harry
finally went over with a 9-yard
spurt around his own left end.
4. The officials got into the act this
time, Rave Stanford a pass-interfer

then called a personal foul on Idaho
and placed thn ball on the 2. Mitchell

rammed it over on the first try.
5. Harry Hugasian, slithered into

high gear, racing 74 yards for the .six
points.
0. Tom Sahw, with Vandals all over

afternoon, hitting Boyd Benson right
on the button in the end /.one from 26

yards away. Dick Gacdtki, Indian
tackle, had stolen the ball from Idaho
to put it in position.
7. Tow Shaw unlimbered again,
tossed first to Wilbur Taylor—nice
catch on the Idaho 12. Then, Tom hit
Dan Mervin, all by himself, in the
end zone with the payoff.
Craby Legs Bud Klien took Bob
May's punt on his own 45, walked a
tight-rope clown the sideline for 20
yards, then cut toward the middle,
danced past several pair of Vandal
arms, and scooted over the goal on

and placed thn ball on the 2. Mitchell

rammed it over on the first try.
5. Harry Hugasian, slithered into
the secondary, and then went into
high gear, racing 74 yards for the .six
points.
0. Tom Sahw, with Vandals all over
his back, threw the nicest pass of the
afternoon, hitting Boyd Benson right
on the button in the end /.one from 26

yards away. Dick Gacdtki, Indian
tackle, had stolen the ball from Idaho
to put it in position.
7. Tow Shaw unlimbered again,
tossed first to Wilbur Taylor—nice
catch on the Idaho 12. Then, Tom hit
Dan Mervin, all by himself, in the
end zone with the payoff.
Craby Legs Bud Klien took Bob
May's punt on his own 45, walked a
tight-rope clown the sideline for 20
yards, then cut toward the middle,
danced past several pair of Vandal
arms, and scooted over the goal on
the end of a nice 55-yard runback. It
was the second week in a row that a
Stanford safety man has run back a
punt for a touchdown. More encour
agement.
9. Dan Mervin took a Shaw pass on
the 15, turned in some neat foot
work and romped untouched into
paydirt.
TWO TD's CALLED BACK
Besides those things, Bill DcYoung
ran 91 yards to a score, only to have
jl called back on a holding crime.
The same thing happened to Benson,
who went 21 for a touchdown, only
to have it erased because of offsides.
Rupc Andrews might have gone all
the way on one sprint, but he slipped
while trying to out-maneuver the
Idaho safety man, and had to settle
for 50 yards. Andrews, who owns the
best ball-packing average on the In
dian squad, has yet to score his first
1949 touchdown.
It was Stanford's .sixth win of the
season, their fourth shut,-out, and whs
their highest scoring total since they
pummeled UCLA. R2-0, in 1925.
Now, that Big Game.
A three-way race to the death is all that's left of the 1919 foot
ball season.
It's a race that will be funneled into a wild, roaring finale next
Saturday when Stanford meets California in the Big Game, knd
when UCLA meets USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum.

Stanford, California, and UCLA set
the stage for this fiery finish when all
three ran past Conference opposition
last Saturday with slashing one-sided
victories.
The Cartls, with Dick Horn and
Tom Shaw waving mystic wands,
waltzed past Idaho's hapless Vandals,
here in the Stadium, with a nine
touchdown outburst to establish a
new Stanford Conference scoring
record, 63 to 0.
CAL, UCLA WIN
California, trailing 7 to 0 at the
end of the first quarter in Berkeley,
came back to blast Oregon from all
sides, 41 to 14, and UCLA, fresh and
eager after a week's "rest, muzzled
the Washington Husky, 47 to 26, in
Los Angeles.
So, the stage is set. The Big Game
rush is on, and the Rose Bowl —
among other things—is at stake.
At the moment, the Golden Bear is
in the driver's seat. But three things
could happen. First, all Cal needs is
another one-point Big Game win to
become automatic.
Second, the Cards will be a cinch
if they drop the Bears, and USC
whips the Bruins.
Third, the whole race will become
a scrambled mess if Stanford beats
Cal, and UCLA takes Troy. If that
happens, you can put on a blindfold,
flip a coin, and guess. That's all.
NO SERIOUS INJURIES
The Indians came out of the Idaho
romp in good shape, except for Ken
Peck's bruised knee and a Gordon
Rice shoulder injury. Otherwise, no
damage done.
Moreover, Gary Kcrkorians nine
straight conversions were sweet to
see, especially in the face of the two
previous Big Games (21-18 and 7-6),
which have been lost because of bad
toes.

Stanford could have punished Ida
ho even more severely if it had
wished. Instead, 42 griddcrs were
used, and only one pass was thrown
in the final quarter.
NINE TOUCHDOWNS
As it was, the scoring parade went
like this:
1. Dick Horn hit Ken Pose with a
bullet jump-pass from three yards
out. Eric Southwood's fine running
set up the score. .
2. Bill McColl made a jumping,
diving, rolling catch of Horn's 25-
! yard fling to land in the end zone.
Bill DcYoung had scampered 51 yards
to put the ball in position.
3. Harry Hugasian broke Idaho into
bits with a scries of slashing runs,
starting from his own 12. Harry
finally went over with a 9-yard
spurt around his own left end.
4. The officials got into the act this
time, Rave Stanford a pass-interfer
ence first down on the Vandal 15,
then called a personal foul on Idaho
and placed thn ball on the 2. Mitchell

rammed it over on the first try.
