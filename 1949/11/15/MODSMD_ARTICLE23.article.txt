## UC, Cards Storm City After Rally 
### 
The streets of San Francisco were
choked off last night by a rooting
horde of Stanford and Cal partisans
as they conducted a giant Big Game
rally in the downtown blocks.
The fesivities opened at the Em
porium on Market Street. The crowd
wound its way through the streets
to the Chronicle, noted stronghold
of Stanfordite sportswriters, to the
Call-Bulletin building, through Un
ion Square, and up to Nob Hill's
Fairmont Hotel.
High spirits of the massed upris
ing of Card and Bear grid fans re
sounded again and again from the
usually stately walls of the Fair
mont. Rooters predicted a new high
in Big Game spirit as they steeled
their vocal cords for Saturday's big
effort in Stanford Stadium.
At the Chronicle, Sports Editor
Bill Leiser gave the throng three
major picks for this week's end
season grid tilts. He predicted a
Stanford win in the Big Game,
called for USC to take the measure
of UCLA in the Coliseum, and fig
ured Ohio State to represent the Big
Ten in the Rose Bowl.
Leading the rally were the Stan
ford Phi Delt band, the Cal Theta
Dclt quartet, Farm head yell leader
Dean Borba and assistant yell lead
ers Jim Scott and Frank Rohner,
Cal head cheer leader Don Ball,
ASSU proxy Hank Rosin, ASUC
president Danny Coehlo, Stanford
homecoming chairman Pete Slusser,
and Cal homecoming director Car
ney Campion. The Phi Delt band
was carried up the precipitous slopes
of The Hill in a bright red truck
driven by Campion.
The only major damage reported
done by the high spirits was sus
tained by the throats of the cele
brants.
