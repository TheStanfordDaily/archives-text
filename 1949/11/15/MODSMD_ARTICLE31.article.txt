# '53ers' Vigil Too Rugged Says Davis
## 
### 
Freshmen guarding the campus
are being too aggresive, warns Police
Chief Gordon Davis.
Several minor collisions have been
caused at blocks on campus roads,
and much undue alarm has also re
sulted. Davis said that in addition to
hundreds of students being incon
venienced, many visitors to the cam
pus and several taxicabs have been
searched.
"We appreciate the enthusiasm of
the students in guarding the campus,"
Davis said, "but we arc afraid the
present pattern is laying them open
to serious consequences."
Davis recommended (hat freshmen
post guards at strategic spots on cam
pus rather than on the roads.
According to frosh reports, no Cal
men visited the campus Sunday
night, but fraternity men, Paly High
students, and an '"Old Grad" were
active keeping the freshman police
busy.
An "Old Grad" went around leav
ing various notes over the Farm say
ing, "For shame, frosh. This could
have been paint." The fraternity
men were present at the Bonfire and
also at other campus points.
At the Bonfire, the frosh chased
and caught some of the pretending
Bear raiders. Early in the morning
some excitement was caused when
some intruders were suspected to be
in the bushes bordering Lagunita,
but a' thorough search which was
undertaken revealed none.
Otherwise, there was no excite
ment for the freshman guards.
