# Why Penalize Mr. Zobler?
## 
### 
In any election, the candidate at the bottom
of the ballot has one strike against him at the
start.
Why? Because a voter who knows none of
the candidates for a given office typically votes
for the top name, or one of the top names, and
almost never picks a candidate near the bottom.
Under the preferential system of voting used
here, the disadvantage is multiplied.
♦Here, the voter who does have a first choice
may not have a second, third, and fourth choice.
Examination of ballots cast shows that these
voters often mark their ballots diagonally,
either up or down.
So the man at the bottom also loses most of
the second- and third-place votes that fall to
other candidates by chance alone.
There are at least two solutions:
1. Rotate the order of the names on the bal

lot. In an election like tomorrow's, with two
offices and four candidates for each, this would
be fairly simple. Each person would be placed
first, second, third, and fourth on 25 per cent of
the ballots.
For tomorow's election, this would cost about
$10 more. For a primary election, with an un
limited number of candidates for each office,
this procedure would probably be mathe
matically and financially impossible.
2. Assign the positions on the ballot by
chance. This would cost no more. It has the
slight disadvantage of making it harder for the
voter to locate his choice in a primary, when
10 candidates or more compete for an office.
Some system should be devised, however.
A man should not be penalized because his
name, alphabetically, appears at the bottom of
the ballot. — M.H.
