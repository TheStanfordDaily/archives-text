# CAMPUS OPINION
## Relief Drive 
### 
To Ui<e Editor:
Perhaps you'd like to know that an alumnus thinks
the student-faculty SIRO show was outstanding from
every angle. It isn't often you get the double satis
faction of contributing to a worthy charity and at the
same time seeing a show that is worth more than the
price of admission.
Such joint student-faculty ventures also contribute
toward making Stanford a better place. This is just a
suggestion; if the SIRO drive falls short, I'm sure a
repeat performance of the show would till Memorial
Aud:toiium now that the trial has been such-a success.
