To the Editor:
In reference to Joan Witzman's letter concerning
the SIRO drive, I agree heartily that much criticism is
due Americans and Stanford students in particular
for their apathy in relation to such things as World
Student Relief. However, I think even more criticism
is due the sponsors of the relief drive for alloting 30
per cent to the Palo Alto Youth Fund.
If the hardships of foreign students are what they
are made out to be by SIRO, how can SIRO detour
SO per cent of the funds to a prosperous community
like Palo Alto? If you ask me, it's a had rider on a
good bill.
If I didn't know that foreign students really need my
dollars, sponsors of the SIRO drive would have an
extremely difficult time convincing me so when their
allocjtjoxi of funds is so inconsistent with the spirit of
the drive.
Herein, 1 think, lies one reason for the lack of en
thusiasm towards the annual SIRO fund-raising cam
paign.
