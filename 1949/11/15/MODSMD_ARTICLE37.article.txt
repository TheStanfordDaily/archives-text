# Axe Yell
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Having read Mel Hoffman's article "Give 'Em the
Axe this morning, I would finally come out of my
hell of eight years at Stanford to explain why some
: tudents protest at giving the Axe Yell.
Before the war, and long before that, it was always
the tradition only to give the Axe Yell at Stanford if
we had the Axe. It's logical, for giving the Axe Yell
without the Axe seems rather ridiculous. Also, when

ever California had the Axe it was always their pre
rogative to give the yell at the Cal Game. It was tough
tt» sit there and listen, but how dynamic it was to win
the game and toast the Bears with the yell afterwards.
It seems rather peculiar that Dean Borba and the
Rally Com didn't inform the students of this tradition.
However, I just wanted to bring this issue to the fore.
In the long run, whether we give the Axe Yell with
or without the Axe, i.s up to the ASSU.
