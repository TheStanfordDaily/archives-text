# Excom Election
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Excom is acting illegally!
Excom has declared last week's election for gradu
ate Excom invalid "due to charges of illegal elec
tioneering brought aganist the winning candidate, Rex
Johnson," even though Excom exonerated Johnson
personally of the charges. Excom has stated that a
new election must be held this Wednesday.
Excom admits that there is no article in the Consti
tution upon which to base its decision to invalidate an
election because of actions of persons other than the
candidate. There is, furthermore, no provision in the
Constitution allowing Excom to authorize a new elec
tion in this case.
The Constitution under which Excom operates is
like all constitutions in that it sets down rules for the
governing body to follow. These rules are established
to eliminate the exercise of personal preferences in de
cisions.
A constitution makes the law. If the constitution is
silent on an issue, it is necessary to change the con
stitution; it is not a function of Excom to develop an
ex post facto law to take care of the immediate situa
tion. A government run by means of ex post facto
laws, or according to the whims or preferences of the
governing body (which is the same thing) is not a
democratic government, and it is, therefore, contra
dictory to (he fundamental principles of Stanford.
I ;-ay that Excom has no authority to invalidate the
recent election for graduate Excom under the consti
tution as it now stands.
Greg Bemis, an Excom representative, has stated
publicly, "We cannot penalize Johnson for our own
mistake." I say that, by forcing him to undergo an
other election, Excom IS in fact penalizing Johnson.
I say that this is wrong, and I protest.
