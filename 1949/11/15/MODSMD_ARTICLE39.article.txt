# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Big Game tension is already mounting to a fever
pitch.
Good old tension. Good old fever pitch. The En
' ina patrols making like the FBI with two-way radios,

signal systems, and searchlights,
are out in force, checking each car
to make sure that things remain
sincere.
The bonfire builders are piling
things higher and higher — just
like conditions in certain columns
you read.
The Phi Delt Band, the only one
of its kind, can be seen and heard
starting to unlimber for it,s annual
effort.
Row decorations are gaining

ioim, ana floats for the Friday night Parade are be
ginning to take shape.
Persons over at Mem And are looking haggard,
• Liggt red, and ragged, what with the '49 Gaieties about
I ) ; et under way.
And oh yes, Chaparral's Big Game special hits the
lit w :tand.s at 8 tomorrow morning.
For some people, all this tension is fine and good. It
all leads up to something called a football game and
lias a meaning.
But as far as I'm concerned, all these tension special
ists shouldn't have gone to the trouble. For me, it'i;
to be the worst Big Game of all time.
I HAVEN'T GOT A TICKET!
Imagine my embarrassment. Here 1 am, a good,
clean-cut American boy, plus in the Bawlout, with a
rceipt tor 200 dollars in my pocket, but with an un
punched i tudent body card in my hand.
I was simply one of those poor gooks who didn't
get over to the basketball pavilion some time back to

stand in line for a ducat, and by the time I got around
to .such action, all tickets were as gone as a Holly
wood Boulevard jazz-hound.
Up until yesterday, I hadn't given up hope. But I'm
just about at the end of my rope.
I kept telling myself that something would turn up.
First, I ran to the sports editor of The Daily.
"Sir and captain," I said. "What has happened to
the four press tickets we get for Big Game?"
"What do you mean WE?" he asked simply, while
counting several large, green bills over and over.
I cleveily remembered that the sports editor of the
Quad was an old friend who might be able to help.
I ran to the Quad office.
"I'm desperate," I admitted. "I'm Dick," he said,
missing my point.
"No-no, you don't get it!" I cried. "I've got to get a
ticket for the Big Game. Look at me, it's your old pal.
I've worked on The Daily for three years, covered
basketball in the rain, football in the cold wind, base
bull in the heat, track in the Stadium, and wrestling
in the sweat. All for The Daily. And what do they do?
They turn me out."
"Easy-easy-easy," said the Quad man, trying to
put over a point. "Your troubles are over. I can help
you on one condition."
"What's that,'' 1 opened.
"Twenty-five bucks," lie said coldly, as he eyed my
gold ring.
"Forget it, you cheap, dirty, slinking, lousy rat,"
was all I could think to say.
So, here 1 am. Ticket less and helpless. I've got
only one slim chance left.
"PROGRAMS, PROGRAMS .... YOU CAN'T
TELL ONF PLAYER I-HOM ANOTHER WITHOUT
A PROGRAM . . . ."

For some people, all this tension is fine and good. It
all leads up to something called a football game and

But as far as I'm concerned, all these tension special

to be the worst Big Game of all time.
I HAVEN'T GOT A TICKET!
Imagine my embarrassment. Here 1 am, a good,
clean-cut American boy, plus in the Bawlout, with a
rceipt tor 200 dollars in my pocket, but with an un
punched i tudent body card in my hand.
I was simply one of those poor gooks who didn't
get over to the basketball pavilion some time back to

stand in line for a ducat, and by the time I got around
to .such action, all tickets were as gone as a Holly
wood Boulevard jazz-hound.
Up until yesterday, I hadn't given up hope. But I'm
just about at the end of my rope.
I kept telling myself that something would turn up.
First, I ran to the sports editor of The Daily.
"Sir and captain," I said. "What has happened to
the four press tickets we get for Big Game?"
"What do you mean WE?" he asked simply, while
counting several large, green bills over and over.
I cleveily remembered that the sports editor of the
Quad was an old friend who might be able to help.
I ran to the Quad office.
"I'm desperate," I admitted. "I'm Dick," he said,
missing my point.
"No-no, you don't get it!" I cried. "I've got to get a
ticket for the Big Game. Look at me, it's your old pal.
I've worked on The Daily for three years, covered
basketball in the rain, football in the cold wind, base
bull in the heat, track in the Stadium, and wrestling
in the sweat. All for The Daily. And what do they do?
They turn me out."
"Easy-easy-easy," said the Quad man, trying to
put over a point. "Your troubles are over. I can help
you on one condition."
"What's that,'' 1 opened.
"Twenty-five bucks," lie said coldly, as he eyed my
gold ring.
"Forget it, you cheap, dirty, slinking, lousy rat,"
was all I could think to say.
So, here 1 am. Ticket less and helpless. I've got
only one slim chance left.
"PROGRAMS, PROGRAMS .... YOU CAN'T
TELL ONF PLAYER I-HOM ANOTHER WITHOUT

Big Game tension is already mounting to a fever
pitch.
Good old tension. Good old fever pitch. The En
