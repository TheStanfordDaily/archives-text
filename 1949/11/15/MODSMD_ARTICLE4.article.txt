# Coal Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON—Th« government
dropped a broad hint today that it
may act after a day or so to stop a
new coal strike December 1 unless
John L. Lewis and coal operators
make a fast peace move.
Because of the lack of any signs
of compromise, Ching was reported
to feel there wasn't much use for
him to arrange federal - sponsored
negotiations.
It was known the White House
was thinking of setting up a fact
finding board to recommend a set
tlement as was done in the steel
strike dispute, or invoking the Taft-
Hartley Act's emergency proce
dures.
