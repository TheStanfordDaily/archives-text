# R. Valentino Loves, Villain Riots at Park
## 
### AL BERRY 
"The Eagle"and "The Villain Still
Pursued Her," which are currently
causing a small riot at the Park
Theater, may or may not be good
motion pictures. But they form just
about as unusual a double bill as
these tired old eyes have viewed for
come time.
"The Eagle," a silent flicker, is
worth while because it portrays the
late, and evidently great, Rudolph
Valentino at his best. Valentino
doesn't need sound to aid him in his
romantic pursuits, and the sheer
force of his personality will prob
ably be enough to keep even the
most cynical of moviegoers happily
occupied. The picture itself is a
museum piece, and even if it weren't
entertaining (which it is), it would
be well worth while as such.
The plot deals with a young Cos
sack (Rudolph) who is ousted from
the services of Catherine the Great
because of an understandable reluc
tance to make love (mad passionate)
to the old hag. Catherine, in a frus
trated mood, signs his death war
rant and finds herself a new boy-—a
captain who to make general.
Rudolph, meanwhile, dashes off
to avenge his father's robbery, and
consequent death. He takes the
guise of a Robin Hood-like charac
ter called The Eagle and generally
has a fine time raising havoc with
the villain.
All goes well for a while, but then
—as the director would have it—
he falls madly in love with the
"heavy's" daughter. Complications
and love set in, but all live happily
ever after.
The other hunk of celluloid is a
more modern dilly done in a more
old-fashioned way. "The Villain
Still Pursued Her" is the screen ver
sion of "The Drunkard," and is just
as hammed up (intentionally) on the
screen as it is on the stage. It is
with this picture that the riot makes
; ts entrance into the Park.
This melladrammer is really poor,
unless you happen to he in a joyoUs
mood, c; just nuts enough to like
something like this. But if you do
have the proper qualifications, it is
a gay, boisterous motionflicker.
