# Cards Will Face Strongest Defensive Line on Coast
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Every Tuesday morning in this
space we write about the team
Stanford is to play during the cur
rent week.
We relate such things as our op
ponents' season's record, the type of
attack they use, and who their stars
areâ€”the point being that the aver
age reader might need his memory
refreshed on such pertinent mat
ters.
That leaves us with an unusual
problem this week. For any half
hearted reader of sports pages
knows all about California's Golden
Bears, their stars, and their record.
What bona-fide fan, for example,
does not already know that the
Bears are undefeated this year, and
that they are currently rated as the
fourth best team in the country?
Who, Indeed?
Or who could be so ignorant as to
be unaware of the fact that Cal's
T-formation attack is spearheaded
by magician Bob Celeri? Any rough
could tell you that the 170-pound
quarterback is the greatest ball
handler, passer, and "bootleg" artist
in recent Berkeley history.
He'l! know all about Celeri's nom
ination by the Northern California
sports writers as their All-American
candidate. And he realizes that Ce
leri is currently hobbling around on
an injured ankle which, however,
should be all cured by Saturday.
He knows, too, that Pappy Wal
dorf lias a lot of other good backs on
his squad: lads like Jim Monachino,
Frank Brunk, and Pete Schabarum.
He knows that Brunk played the
lead in the outstanding performance
of the year, a 102-yard kiekoff re
turn which led to the Strawberry
Canyon defeat of USC one month
ago today.
He knows that Monachino and
Schabarum are big, last pi led rivers

who are without peers in the matter
of denting rival lines.
He's already read about the re
turn of blond Jackie Swaner, an
All - Conference halfback in 1948,
who was the second member of the
famed Royal Jack combination.
By Heart
He realizes that the California de
fensive line is the roughest, tough
est, and meanest on the Coast. He's
been hearing the names of All-
American Rod Franz, place - kick
specialist "Truck" Cullom, tackle
Jim Turner, linebacker Les Richter,

iind all the other beefy Bear defend
ers, until he knows them by heart.
He knows that Waldorf's crew of
wingmen, built around such steady
performers as Norm Pressley, Dan
Begovich, and Bob Minahen, forms
what is probably the second best
collection of ends in the Conference.
He knows that they're good, but not
as good as Marchie's flankers.
The green sheet has already in
formed him that Cal will be fresh
from a 41 to 14 rout of Oregon's hap
less Ducks, who were supposed to
give the league leaders a tough bat
tle but faded completely before the
onslaught of that terrific Berkeley
line.
And nothing could be clearer to
our Stanford rough than the fact
that Saturday's game will decide
who goes to the Rose Bowl. He's
got the mathematical situation down
cold.
So what is there to write about?
