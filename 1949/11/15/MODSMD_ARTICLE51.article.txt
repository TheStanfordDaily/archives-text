# Gridders Calm As Big Game Fever Mounts
## 
### 
With a magical Frank Pierson
scouting report in his hip pocket,
Headman Marchie Schwartz started
serious practice last night for next
Saturday's all-important Big Game.
Despite the noise and clamor which
have already spread over the campus,
the gridders remained calm and
deadly determined last night.
To a man, they believe they can
whip California; and with this newest
Pierson scouting report on the scene,
they feel doubly sure of finally up
setting the odds.
Pierson is the man who came out
of nowhere in 1947 to give the Indiuns
the inspiration they needed to rise
to the heights in face of 10 to 1 odds
to play California oft' its feet, only
to lose in the dying moments, 21 to 18.
Greatest worry to Schwartz yester
day was the size of his injury list.
Don Fix, offensive guard, and Hal
Walker, defensive tackle, both are
laid up with the miseries and will
not be able to suit up until next
Saturday. Fix is ailing with a
sprained ankle, and Walker is both
ered by a bad charley horse.
Besides these latest injuries,
Schwartz figures that Dave Field,
Jack Rye, Ken Peck, Gordon Rice,
and Bob White are not in good
enough physical condition to undergo
heavy scrimmage this week.
However, the Headman hopes to
schedule a good scrimmage tomorrow
afternoon, especially for the offensive
ball-carriers. Gary Kerkorian, who
drilled extra minutes on placements
last night, will continue more of the
same all week.
Barring casualties in practice,

Stanford should be iji good shape by
Saturday. Assistant trainer, Robert.
Newell, stated yesterday that "the
squad should be 100 per cent ready
by the Big Game."
Practice this afternoon will be
worked around setting up special de
fenses for California, with concen
tration being centered upon the
various scouting reports Schwartz
has in his possession.
