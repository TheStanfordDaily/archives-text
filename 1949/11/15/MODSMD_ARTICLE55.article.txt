# Stanford Engineers Are Testing Device To Stabilize Vessels in Rough Water

Stanford engineers are helping to
develop a ship stabilizer that will
take the roll out of rolling seas.
Joseph H. Chadwick Jr., Stanford
| graduate student in engineering, is
j now observing tests of the stabilizer
on the Peregrine in rough water off
Norfolk, Va.
Theory of the stabilizer was de
veloped more than a decade ago by
Dr. Nicholas Minorsky, acting pro
fessor of mechanical engineering at
Stanford during 1947-49.
A model, named the "U.S.S. Mi
norsky," was built at the New York
Naval Shipyard in 1938. Experi
ments with the model in the ship
yard's materiel laboratory led Navy
engineers to build a device which
is now being tested aboard the

minesweeper U.S.S. Peregrine off
the coast of Virginia.
Two large tanks are installed on
opposite sides of the ship. The tanks
are partially filled with water, and
| the bottoms are connected across
the ship by a duct.
The instant the ship begins to
roll, a sensitive instrument called an
angular accelerometer flashes a sig
nal to pumping equipment which
forces water through the transfer
duct to the tank on the side where
the roll started, thus leveling he
ship.
By shifting the water from one
tank to the other, Navy engineers
expect to cut a ship's rolling at sea
i by as much as 80 per cent.

In 1947 the model was brought to
Stanford, where Professor Minorsky
was serving on the engineering fac
ulty. Two graduate students in en
gineering, Albert J. Morris of Red
wood City and Joseph H. Chadwick
Jr. of Palos Verdes, reassembled the
device and placed it in operation
under the direction of Dr. Minorsky.
