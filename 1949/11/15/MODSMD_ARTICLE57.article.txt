# Fellowships Offered By Research Corp.
## 
### 
Part of the one million dollars
distributed so far this year by the
Research Corporation was given to
Stanford to further the study of
asymmetric reductions.
The money for this project will be
used to give fellowships to two
graduate chemistry students for fur
ther study and investigation.
These students, working on an in
vestigation begun by Dr. Harry S.
Mosher in 1947, will attempt to re
produce a trick of nature by pro
ducing an optically active com
pound. Nature uses enzymes, organ
ic compounds whose mechanism of
reaction is not yet understood, to
change the compounds of the human
body to optically active products. If
their experiments are successful
they may be able to draw a parallel
between the action of laboratory re
agents and .catalysts and the action
of enzymes.
Research Corporation was found
ed in 1912 and gives its money to
such projects as will extend man's
scientific knowledge to the benefit,
immediate or eventual, of mankind.
It receives its money from patents
held on the synthesis of vitamin 8,,
the cleansing of industrial gases, and
other processes.
