Men's Council
The Men's Council runoff was
I necessitated by the failure to obtain
ja majority in last week's election.
Excom ruled that since the prefer
ential system was not used on that
occasion and the required majority
j was not obtained, and since write-in
i candidacies had been officially sanc
tioned, the election constituted a
I primary.
Excom also ordered the graduate
Excom representative contest be re
run, due to an incident of illegal elec
tioneering before last week's elec
tion. The winning candidate's cam
paign leaflets had been illegally dis
tributed without his knowledge. Ex
com felt that he was not responsible,
i and ruled the election results void.
The Men's Council vacancy was
I created by the resignation of Council
chairman Fred Cummings.
New Grad Post
The graduate Excom delegate post
was recently created by Excom under
an ASSU constitutional provision
which gives Excom the power to
create a second seat for a graduate
student. The winner will sit with,
not replace, Hank Grandin, present
graduate representative.
Under a new election rule, only
students enrolled in graduate divi
sion will be eligible to vote for that
| oriice.
All men students in the University,
regardless of class, may vote for
Men's Council.
Candidates arc also urged to sub
