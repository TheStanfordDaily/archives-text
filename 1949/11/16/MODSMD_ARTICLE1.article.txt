LAKE SUCCESS, Nov. 15 (/P) -
ion today of monstrous hypocrisy in
Yugoslavia accused the Soviet Un
talking peace before the United Nu- |
tions while carrying on a campaign j
against Marshal Tito.
Canada and China joined in an at
tack on the so-called peace propo- j
sals Moscow has presented to the |
UN. Canada declared the Kremlin i
should disband Communist fifth col- j
umns in foreign countries. China
said the Moscow proposal "adds in
sult to injury." The proposal is that
the Soviet Union join the United j
States, Britain, France, and China in
a compact for peace.
