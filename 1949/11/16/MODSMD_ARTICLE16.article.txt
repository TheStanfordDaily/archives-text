# Oskie Balls Up On TV Record
## 
### 
The Stanford Indian ha* just dis
covered that the dirty Golden Bear
is grimier than usual. This time the
Bear was roaring over the loss of a
sound track for a Cal TV show.
Yesterday . which ihcidcntaMy
was the day of the TV show . . .
Bay Area papers told the sad talc
of how a young man, horribly dis
guised as a Cal student, entered the
premises of the student union and
walked ofl with the sound track. In
timation: Stanford students.
But a couple of curious Stanford
students started wondering where
the other set of discs were and
whether Cal students could really
be dumb enough to let someone
walk off with these prized posses
sions.
So these couple of curious Stan
ford students decided to investigate
the matter. They found that myste
riously the sound track had been
found in time for the telecast ... in
fact, it had never left Cal. The show
had been all ready to tfo since Mon
day, and the whole story was just
another Cal-typc publicity stunt.
But Cal slipped up there, too . . .
the story didn't carry the time of
the telecast . . . Poor Cal.
