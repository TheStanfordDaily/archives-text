### JOHN HALL 
Have you got your Big Came tie yel?
Doctor Sterling, the big chief, has his.
Dean Borba, the cheer-man, has his.

Bill Swigart, lord of The Daily Shack, has his,
AI Masters, the man with the money, has his.

And oven old Rah-Rah Hall has
his.

What I mean to say simply is
that Charlie Mould's red-red ties
with the painted Indian driving
down the Road to Roses, could
turn out to be the greatest spirit
raising gimmick since Will Irwin
hatched the original Axe Yell.
Charlie Moulds is the happy
haberdasher who had :>o much en
thusiasm for the 1949 Indian foot
ball squad that he went out and

ordered a batch of these Rose Bowl ties before the
:.eason even started.
For awhile, just after the Michigan game, for in
stance, he felt kind of weepy about the whole affair;
but, all of a sudden, just after the USC game, for in
stance, things began to look rosy.
These ties are just what the 1949 Big Game needed.
They will offer that extra spark, that mark of mid
week togetherness that should help push the gridders
to their first victory over California since 194G, and put
them in the Pasadena Rose Bowl for the first time since
194 U.
Incidentally, before we go much further, let me

point out simply that Hall hasn't sold out to the com
mercial enterprises. Like the blind umpire, I calls 'em
the way I sees 'em. And like the caught crook, I paid
the full price.
Bull Session, policy is to pass on all good deals that
are uncovered in the process of living the life oi a
Stanford student.
So, back to the Road to Roses. Anybody who wants
to pick up one of these ties can do so by hitting the
Charlie Moulds' Men's Shop on California Avenue in
Mayfield. To make it easy, it's just across from the
Mayfield Theater'.
I paid two-fifty for mine, but upon presentation ol
a student body card, you can get yours for just two
filty. Moulds lias more deal for you. For fifty cents
more you can get a pair of red socks thrown in and a
chance at TWO FREE BIG CAME TICKETS.
In fact, any three-dollar purchase in the joint will
get you a chance on those two tickets. And please, il
you win the tickets and decide not to sell them lor 75
bucks, remember me. I'm the guy who still hasn't got
a ducat.
Dean Borba has suggested that everybody should
get together and weur the ties at the same time. For
instance, on Thursday. Thursday on Quad. Thursday
at the bonfire. Thursday at the Gaieties.
Well, that about covers it. Rah-rah. See you on
Quad, and don't worry if you see some guy with his
tongue hanging down to his belt.
It'll just be me with my Big Game tie.
