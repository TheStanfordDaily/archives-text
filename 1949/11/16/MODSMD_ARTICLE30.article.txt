To the Editor:
As an interested observer, I have been watching the
progress of the Big Game bonfire. I have found it
rather disappointing. I have always understood that
the indication of the quality of a freshman class is its
bonfire. It this is true, then this class is not a very
good one. I understand that repeated attempts to get
the men to work on Tuesday afternoon failed. Also,
the fire is supposed to he way behind schedule. II this
state of affairs continues, the fire will be a Hop and
so will the class of '53.
