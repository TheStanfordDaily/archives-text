To tho Editor:
We wish that Pat Ryan Jr. had one of A 1 Capp's
''Kigmes" at his disposal when his "mounting ire
leached its boiling point" in regard to the selections
presented by the Village Film Society.
The cartoon mentioned by the writer of last Mon
day's letter was supplied the Society by a film library
ai part of the program for which the Society paid the
full exhibition price, not the home showing rate. As
to the quality of the cartoon, that is a matter of opinion.
Some we know enjoyed it and appreciated the subtle
humor, however, it is purely a matter of taste.
In the past the Society has presented what the Se
lection Committee considered to be outstanding films,
among them being "Of Mice and Men," "The Beach
comber," and the French film, "Generals Without But
tons." These could hardly be considered "low grade
atrocities."
On the subject of program changes, only one major
change has been made this quarter and we feel with
good reason. "The Iron Duke" was replaced by the
film "Lydia," after the Selection Committee learned
that the only prints available to the Society had a very
pooi sound recording.
As a non-profit organization, the Village Film So
ciety is not, needless to say, seeking to swindle anyone
and it there is anyone else feeling as Pat Ryan seemed
to be, he is certainly entitled to a refund for his series
ticket. A refund has been offered to Pat Ryan which
he has declined with the statement that he would like
to see some more of the films to be presented this
quarter. We are glad that his "ire which reached the
boilint- point" has cooled somewhat.
We feel that the Film Society is furthering the cul
tural and entertainment opportunities in Stanford Vil
lage. We know that we have made mistakes and blun
ders, and we welcome any suggestions and criticisms
which can he directed to the secretary, Dr. Gabor
Pviaikus, 21(5 Stanford Village.
