# Relief Drive

To the Editor:
Because of an editorial policy, which is understand
able, that will not permit me to write a column lor
The Daily, 1 feel i must use this means to clear up a
m isunderstand ing.
The Belief Drive, which is now in progress, is ac
tually the Stanford Belief Fund Drive, not SlÃŸO's
own drive. SIBO, because it receives the largest per -
centage of the funds raised and because it expressed
the desire, was given the right to engineer and conduct
the drive by the Executive Committee.
Therefore, it is perfectly right that part of the money
from the Stanford Belief Fund Drive should go to
other charities which the Executive Committee feels
are worthy of contribution. We give '10 per cent to the
Palo Alto Community Chest, 10 per cent is kept in an
Emergency Floating Fund to handle national charities
whose drives arise throughout the year, and 60 per
cent goes for foreign relief to be administered by SIBO.
In keeping with the policy of one major drive a quar
ter, that is, for the fall quarter the Stanford Relief
Fund Drive (or the SIBO Drive as it has been mis
named), the Bed Cross Drive in winter quarter, and
the Convalescent Home Drive in spring quarter, we
have hoped to eliminate a constant appeal to the Stan
ford student.
