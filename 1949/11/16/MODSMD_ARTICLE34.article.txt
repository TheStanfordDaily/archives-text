# Excom Election
## 
### 
To the Editor:
1. Excom did NOT act illegally.
2. Excom did NOT exonerate Johnson from the
charges of illegal electioneering.
3. Contrary to Mr. Belden's statement, there IS an
article in the constitution authorizing Excom to call
a special election when needed. (Article V, section 1,
paragraph c: "The Executive Committee shall call such
special elections as may be necessary.")
4. Under the present constitution and by-laws Ex
com had two choices:
(a) Disqualify Johnson for his illegal electioneering,
giving the position to the second-place candi
date. (Would this he penalizing Johnson, Mr.
Belden?)
or
(b) Excom could rule that inasmuch as the by-laws
contained rio ruling as to what should be done
in the case of a candidate whose well-wishers
violated the rules for him, the only fair ruling
for both Johnson and the other candidates was
to have another week of campaigning followed
by an election.
I am not sure where you could have gotten your
information, Mr. Belden, hut I hope this clears up the
issue at hand.
