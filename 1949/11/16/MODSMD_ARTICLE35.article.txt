# Big Game Dates
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We happen to know that a good third of the girls
at Ho bit? are without dates big Game night. We hope
the boys can take a hint. It will be a shame to see all
our friends, hoys and girls, sitting home that night.
Incidentally, we don't feel that John Hall is qualified
to write about this situation, since Mr. Hull is married
and therefore has no Big Game date problem.
So, get on the ball, guys. There's still time to remedy
this situation 1 ,et's make it couples instead of stags.
