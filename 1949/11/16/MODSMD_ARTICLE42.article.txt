## 
### 
"I never was any good at taking j
pictures," exclaimed Dr. Frederick j
Spiegelberg after an enthusiastic
audience of over 1,100 persons fin
ished applauding his illustrated lec
ture on "India, 1949" last night at
Memorial Auditorium.
"I used a simple little Ansco cam
era and neither light meter nor ex
posure meter. 1 just took aim and
shot."
Yet (lie 9(5 colored slides taken
I earlier this year in India by Dr.
Spiegelberg and flashed on the
screen last night "would have been
a credit to any professional photog
rapher," Dr. John W. Dodds, Stan
lord English professor who intro
duced the speaker, remarked after
ward.
A faculty member of the Depart- 1
ment of Asiatic and Slavic Studies
! here, Dr. Spiegelberg returned last
J July 1 from a six-month tour of
India, where he took some 500 pie-
I tines of Indian cities, villages, uni
versities, and Buddhist and Hindu
| spiritual leaders, "only 20 of which
j 1 was dissatised with."
Returning with added insight on
the answer to the question "Is ln
! dia spiritually alive today?" Dr.
Spiegelberg observed:
"Indian spirituality is surviving
. . . but is threatened all around by

j modern doctrines imported from the
| West."
Dr. Spiegelberg participated last
I night in the regular weekly program
of the Tuesday Evening Series.
