It's terrifying to think about it, but UCLA's Bruins, the football team no
body likes, might wind up with the roses that everybody else wants.
The Bruins, who have failed to impress anybody this season, nevertheless
have dropped only one league contest, and if they could manufacture an
impressive win over Troy, while Stanford dumps Cal, Joe Bruin would rate
a definite chance.
As a matter of fact, the Bruins don't figure to beat USC, which is Stan
ford's extra incentive for going after California.
But, neither did the Bruins hgure to win the basketball title last winter.
However, they did; and it was in the much the same manner as they are
going about this Rose Bowl business.
If you remember that far back, UCLA was considered to bo only a second
rate cage squad. They had speed and spirit and kept winning games, but it
was mutually agreed by all that the Bruins couldn't last.
They went into the final two games of the season against USC boasting
a one-game advantage, but the Trojans were favored to whip them into
line, and walk off with the title.
UCLA won both games, humiliated USC, dumbfounded the experts, and
won themselves a title.
They might be able to do the same thing on Saturday.
Troy Gri<!<l<'i*s Have lo (ioiue Through!
However, USC's Terrible Trojans will be ready to shoot the proverbial
works. Jay Merry-Go Roundy is returning to action for the first time since
the Ohio State game. He is Troy's speed back, the man they needed against
California.
Besides that, Jim Powers will be gunning for the Conference passing and
lol.il offense records. Against the Uclan secondary, which is none too sharp
on such matters, Cousin Jim could have himself a day.
You don't have to worry about USC's line. Bruin fullback Cliff Schroeder
won't go far up the middle, and Ernest Johnson will have to he at his very
host to go around.
Yet, USC might not be spiritually set. Two lough knocks from California
and Stanford, a physical beating from Ohio State, and a prospective trip to
South Bend, might have the Trojans reeling with the miseries.
But still, the Figueroa boys should rally around for the UCLA game. It is
(heir I3i.n Game, in fact, it is called the Biggest Game by Los Angeles type
writer hams.
So, let's string along with the Trojans, and hope that they string along
with us.
Al least, the motto this week, as well as being "BEAT CAL," should he
"AND LITTLE CAL, TOO . . . ."
IJijj; Game a Winner-Take-All Proposition
Now, for Stanford's real problem. Saturday's Big Game should be the
final .say as to whom goes where. It should be a winner-take-all proposition.
Who's going to win? Sports Editor Breier, last Monday, scribbled some
thing to the effect that the 1949 California squad is better than either the
19<17 or '48 .clubs. That factor, to me, seems impossible.
I saw the Bears beat USC, 1(5 to 10. Neither did they look like the better
team, nor did they look like a great team. They have added a better passing
game and more team spirit to the improvement side of the ledger, but other
than that, nothing is better and much is worse.
California does not have a break-away threat such as Jack Jenson any
more. They did for a while with Charles Sarver, but he was put on the blink
early in the season. Jack Swaner, who recently returned to the wars, could
supply that punch, but Swaner has been too long out of action.
The center of the Cal line, with Franz, Turner, Cullom, Richter, and De-
Jong is still plenty tough, but then so is the center of the Stanford line,
which has held its own with the best in the business. Better than that,
Stanford's line has had the best of the best in the business.
It boils down to this: Cal is no better than last season, Stanford is.
I think that Stanford is two touchdowns better.
