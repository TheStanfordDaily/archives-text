Tho Big Red polo team split its
two-game series with New Mexico
Military Institute last weekend. A 1
Scherer, No. 3 in the Indian lineup,
was high scorer for the match with
an eight-point total to his credit.
In the first game, played on the
campus polo field, NMMI fired to
quick ones in the first chukker and
maintained the lead to win by a
score of 8 to 6.
Monday's game, played at San
Mateo, threatened to be a repeat
performance when NMMI took an
early lead, but the Indians hit the
warpath to scalp their opponents 10
to 8.
