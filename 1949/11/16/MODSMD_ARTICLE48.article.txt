yesterday. Los Angelean Dick Hy
land was even present.

could not have been foo enlighten
ing. The practice session was much
the same as the (50 some that have
gone before.
Marchie Wary of Injuries
Coach Marchie Schwartz divided
the time equally between offense
and defense, but abstained from
contact work for the second night in
a row. He indicated, however, that
the Cards might have a go :it light
scrimmage work tomorrow.

length of the practice and its inten
sity.
Walker and Fix to Play
Tlie footballers labored long alter
the lights were turned on and after j
the early part of the workout, they
