"Operation Scalp," begun last
night, will continue for the next
three nights.
To keep the campus informed on
the raiding situation, station KZSU
will remain on the air all night to
night, tomorrow, and Friday nights.
The campus station began its all
night vigils last night, when KZSU
engineers set up shop in the Encina
lounge to broadcast recorded music
and any raiding or scalping news
that might occur.
While Cal prisoners (if any)
squawk and squirm, a KZSU an
nouncer will give a running descrip
tion of their head - shaving, said
Program Director Chuck Black. In
terviews with members of the frosh
defense organization will be held
from time to time.
The station will present its usual
program schedule from 7 to 11 p.m.
From 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., controls will
be switched to Encina.
