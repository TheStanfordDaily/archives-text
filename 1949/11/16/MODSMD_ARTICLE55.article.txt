Two more Berkeley Bears felt the
j wrath of the freshman barbers yes-
I terday morning. The victims were
fraternity men from Cal who were
apprehended while waiting for their
! cohorts to pick them up.
Six members of the '53 guards
were active in the capture. Rudy
Buchser, George Burtness, Cal Cot
j triel, and Chuck Denny, cruising in
Buchser's car, and Daan van Alder-
I werelt and Roger Morris, on bi
! cycles, caught the intruders in a
cafe just oft campus.
''The fellows first claimed they
were San Jose State fraternity
pledges left there to be captured and
shaved," Buchser related. "When
asked where they were going, one
.said San Francisco, while the other
at the same time pointed toward San
Jose.
"They were trapped by their own
| words, when they could not give the
San Jose State football scores, and
tell where the campus was located.
After this blunder, we took them to
Encina lounge to be sheared."
The raiders finally admitted that
they were seniors who had come up
with two carloads of fraternity men
j from Cal, and that they had been
! left off to infiltrate into the cam
pus. They said oil was poured on
the Pavi'ion lawn in the form of a
"C."
It was discovered too late that the
Bcarmen were waiting for their
companions when they were picked
up.
Encina was alerted at 6:45 Monday
night when a gasoline attendant in
i San Mateo called and reported some
I Cal cars on their way. The only ac
tion besides the capture was a two
hour chase after a supposed Cal car,
but it was a false alarm.
