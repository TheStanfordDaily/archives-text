Preferential Election
The election will be conducted un
. der a preferential system. Students
will vote for their first, second, and
third choices. Election Board Chair
man CI ill Carlson points out that a
voter will not find it to the advan-
I tage of his candidate to make only a
first choice, as his second and third
choices are counted only if there is
| no majority on the fii'st tally and his
j candidate is dropped as low man.
The preferential system works like
I this:
The first choice votes of each of
i the four candidates are counted. If
j no one has the required majority,
the lowest man is dropped, and his
ballots arc distributed among the re
maining three candidates according
to the second choices marked thereon.
If there is not yet a majority, the
lowest man is dropped, and his bal
lots are distributed between the re
maining two contenders according to
' the second choices, or the third
' choices if the seconds are for the
I candidate first dropped.

All members of Election Board
arc instructed to report to room eR,
Education Building, at 4 p.m. today
to count votes.

No write-in votes are counted in a
final preferential election.
The Men's Council election was
necessitated by the resignation of
Council Chairman Fred Cummings.
The winner will serve until the end
of winter quarter.
Write-ins Now on Ballot
The election last Wednesday for
the Men's Council scat was declared
a primary by Exeom. It had been in
tended to be a final, but since write
in candidacies had been officially al
lowed, and since there was no ma
jority, the final is being held today.
The two candidates who appeared on
last week's ballot, plus the top two
write-in candidates, arc on today's
I ballot.
Excom also declared the results of
the graduate Exconi race void. Cam
paign literature of the winning can
didate had been illegally distributed
ajid displayed, but Excom did not
feel it fair to disqualify him. That
candidate did not know of the illegal
campaigning on his behalf, and the
ASSU constitution and election by
laws provided not for fixing of re
sponsibility in such a case.
The new graduate Excom reprc
-1 sentativc will he the second graduate
student on Excom. The ASSU consti
tution provides for two such scats if
Excom finds the graduate enrollment
high enough to warrant it.
Only men enrolled in the graduate
division may vote for graduate Ex
com representative. All men in the
i University may vote for Men's Coun-
I cil.
