Catchy tunes? Fancy dances?
Risque jokes? And that Big Game
spirit? You bet! The 1949 Big Game
Gaieties has it. Certainly the open
ing night audicncc agrees.
Stu Hyde as Dad Rango, Ann
Guilbert and Ann Lawder as the
"between scenes" girls, George Den
ny and Frank WolfT in several parts,
Bill Kcnney as the boy his best
friends told, Scotty Doggett and his
nimble fingers, and a host of fine
singers and dancers stole the bulk
of the handclaps.
Carol Eller's choreography was
above the amateur level. Colorful
costumes designed by Marilyn Ra
binovich were effective throughout
and especially in the New Old Hei
delberg scene.
Dick Hay deserves double laurels
for his lighting design and for 'AMI
sets he dreamed up with Dick C;
ler. Sets and lighting, by the W
ranked above any seen in the G;
tics since they were resumed a
( the war.
One thing that made this y<
Gaieties above average was that
individual skits wree not dra,
out but built up to a climax
then stopped. The whole show
a lively, fast-moving pcrforman*
The worlpl premiere of the i
"Once in a Lifetime" by Milt Ht
Stanford '21, was strictly a coiv
tional love ballad and not quit#
to expectations. The best son;
the show was "Ebony Dawn"
Jane Smith, which was sung and
ecutcd beautifully by Willard I
year and a troupe of dancers.
The orchestra accompamm
sounded too loud at. times, but
was probably caused by the j.
acoustics in Memorial Auditori
All six directors deserve a g
share of the credit for the sho
success, with special mention go
to Jim Haran for over-all directi
Bill Barnes for capable handling
the musical score, and Bill Kibby
technical direction.
