# Sports Scribes From Far and Wide Look with Great Interest to Saturday
## 
### 
Every year the cry goes out, "This is the biggest Big Game of all time."
But this year that may well be true for, if the official notice of newspapers and sports writers is
any indication, the Big Game has "arrived."
Athletic News Director Don Liebendorfer has been beseiged by newspapers as far away as Min
neapolis—all want to cover the game that may well decide which team will be the PCC represen-

-tative in the Rose Bowl on January 2.
The game will be played on that date
because the first falls on a Sunday
next year.
All Los Angeles papers will staff
the game. Usually these papers are
content to use the wire services or a
local correspondent for our Big
Game. They have one of their own
in the Southland.
And it is more than just a guess
that every radio in the Stadium this
week will he tuned to the USC
UCLA crucial. The Bruins need this
one in the worst way. The L.A.
bookies evidently don't feel the Tro
jans are so "powerless," for they have
established USC a 7-point favorite.
Back in the Bay Area, the local
oddsmakers have called it Cal, 10
to 7 or even at seven points.
Every major newsreel service will
be represented in the Stadium Satur
day. In addition to the KGO-TV
broadcast, the game will be beamed
across the nation to members of the
160-station CBS network which de
cide to carry the contest. Walter
"Red" Barber will be the sports
caster. The Pacific Coast states, Ida
ho, Montana, and Nevada will be
"blacked out" for this broadcast.
All of which adds color to the al
ready colorful Stanford-California
football game. But the gridders

be the last regular practice on their
home grounds. Today the squad wilt
drill for just over an hour and then
depart for an "unknown destination"
to rest up for Saturday.
Today's practice will consist of
dummy work for 20 minutes and run
ning drills without pads for the re
mainder of the period. That will
complete a week on no-contact work.
The injury picture was brightened
somewhat yesterday with the reap
pearance in uniform of Don Fix and
Hal Walker. Neither lad took part in
the dummy scrimmage work but both
should be ready for the Bears.
Schwartz ran a mixture of fresh
men. and varsity players in Califor
nia plays against his first string de
fensive units. Pass patterns and boot
leg plays made up the majority of the
"Cal" team's offerings.
And again it was work under the
lights for (he Cards. Russ Pomeroy
was given a chance to play all three
of the positions he may be called upon
to fill Saturday.
The big junior will sec action as
defensive linebacker and defensive
left tackle. He will also double,

right guard.
