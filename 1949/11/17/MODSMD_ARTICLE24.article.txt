Cliff Dektar, sports editor of the University of
Southern Califonia Daily Trojan, made the fol
lowing remarks in his column "On The Field,"
following Stanford's victory over USC:
"There are many other factors in winning
football games besides coaching.
"Most important is YOU MUST HAVE FOOT
BALL PLAYERS!
"Under the present PCC 'sanity' or perhaps
better named 'insanity' code, the Trojans ap
parently cannot compete with the other Con
ference schools. It appears that everyone in
California, openly or under the table, is out
bidding and outpromising SC.
'One lad who went from the Southland to
the lands of the Northwest, and whose name
isn't McElhenny, replied to SC's offers:
" 'Why, 1 just can't turn down — - 's offer.
It's just too good.'
"If we are to have good lootball teams, the
coaches must be given adequate material to
work with.
"Does SC have adequate material?
"Answer that one yourself.
"A person who should know tells us that the
Trojans had a list of 18 freshman football pros
pects they wanted.

"How many did they get?
"THREE.
"With apologies to our alumni, who are gen
erous like all good alumni, we hear recurrent
reports that the alumni are not working to
gether. That's one big reason why Stanford
comes south almost with more Southern Cali
fornians 011 the team than SC.
"And Cal —Jim Lamhofer describes the large
number of high school lads shaking hands
with Pappy Waldorf in the Cal dressing room
after the Cal-UCI.A game. Who brought them
there, Mr. Schmidt? Why, well-wishers, of
course.
"Bluntly, the PCC 'sanity' code is a farce
and apparently no one besides SC in the larger
schools is observing it. What do Washington,
UCLA, Cal, and Stanford care about a few hun
dred bucks in fines—they have the players!
"An SC coach whose name we won't men
tion, says that when he goes to watch his old
high school play football he's afraid to talk to
the kids. The PCC watches HIM too closely
becuse he's from SC! But someone's taking
those kids to see Pappy Waldorf, and if Jim
Reynolds isn't a Stanford angel for his recruit
ing, we don't know what to call him."
Ripley would be interested in this.
