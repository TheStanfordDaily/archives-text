# Self-Perpetuation Is Not a Privilege
## 
### 
Since when, we'd like to know, do the mem
bers of Men's Council decide who is qualified
to serve with them on the Council and who is
not?
After nominations for the vacant Council
post were closed last week, the present mem
bers of our ASSU judiciary talked it over and
came up with the idea that the nominees were
not Council material.
After an attempt to reopen the nominations
had failed, our representatives on Council took
it upon themselves to round up write-in candi
dates for the office and actively support them
in the election.
Council's action, whether in good faith or not,
exerted an unfair influence on the election. It is
neither the duty nor the privilege of any elec
tive ASSU body to choose, or attempt to
choose, it'j own members. Self-perpetuation in
any elective office is directly opposed to the
principles of democracy.
Any student may run for an ASSU office pro
viding he meets the requirements set forth in
the ASSU Constitution. The voters choose the
man they want. The voters may be influenced
by the opinions of others and by campaigning,
but they should never be subject to the influ
ence of those who hold official positions in our
student government. â€”J.L.
