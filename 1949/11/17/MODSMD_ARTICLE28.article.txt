To the Editor:
After serious consideration of the Big Game Night
date prob'em, as evidenced by recent letters to the
editor, we, (he charter members of the Luncheon
Businessmen and Clean-Cuts Discussion Society, have
worked out a solution to this dilemmaâ€”simple and
sure-fire.
Each Roble girl interested in obtaining a date for
Big Game Night (or any other night) submit:
1 A photograph
2. A financial statement, or
3. Both
to the above society- address dishroom, Village Dining
Hall, Stanford University, California.
The facts will be carefully and impartially reviewed
by our society and dates assigned on the bagis of the
the above data and any additional data the applicant
might supply (possession of car or fake ID, willingness
to supply lux or tickets to dance, etc ).

The society does not assume any responsibility for
the appearance or conduct ol any of the escorts pro
vided, and guarantees only that they are male, human,
and presently enrolled at Stanford.
fn anticipation of many eager replies, we remain.

To the Editor:
For the "Six Roble Girls" and the unfortunate one
third of the Roble inmates, 1 humbly offer a solution
to their problem. Instead of criticizing John Hall and
asking those who don't know them (but probably
would like to) to "remedy the situation," they might
remedy their own predicament with a date bureau.
Or is that considered too degrading!
Certain factions at "Gal" don't think so, and have
Successfully operated one for years.
