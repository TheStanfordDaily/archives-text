# History Marked by Futile Cal Attempts to Prevent Bonfire
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
Undaunted by Cal threats, raids, and bombs, the annual Bonfire,
oldest of the Big Game traditions, has never failed through the
years to be the climax of the Big Game rally.
The 51-year-old tradition received its initiation in 1898 when
some Roble girls decided the living room was too small for their
rally. They moved outdoors wheref

they were kept warm by a fire which
was fixed by some gallant Zetes.
Ironically enough, Stanford suf
fered its first Big Game hiss that
year, 0 to 22.
After the rally iu 1900, a bonfire
was lighted on the baseball field, and
the rooters spent their time doing
fancy stunts for the first all-campus
celebration. The reaction that year
was a 5 to 0 vic tory for the Cards.
Big C Fence
Featured in the 1904 Bear funeral
pyre was Cal's esteemed "Big C"
fence which was carted around the
Bay in retaliation for the Axe theft
five years earlier. The fence was
burned as a "hoodoo" and the Indians
walloped Oskie 18 to 0.
"One of the most wonderful rallies
in the history of Stanford" was the
Daily Palo-Alto description of the 1911
Cardinal lire which took place that
year on the Inner Quad. Its effect on
the football squad was negligible as
Cal won, 21 to 3.
Alter making unsuccessful "air
raid" attempts to bomb the bonfires
of 1920 and 11)22, Cal burned the fire
to the ground for the first time in
1925. They accomplished this feat
after slipping through when the
guards ' were changing shifts. The
next day, classes were dismissed, and
another fire was ignited on schedule.
Time Bomh
A time bomb did the trick for Cal
once aguin in 1928, but the aroused
student body cut classes and in 36
hours they had amassed a second
bonfire. Lighted on time at the rally,
it was one of the most successful of
all Oskie incinerators. The Indian
eleven then tied the Bears, keeping
them from winning the Conference
championship.

! Perhaps the most triumphant rally
and bonfire ever held heralded the
return of the Axe in 1935. More than
10,000 rooters joined in the festivities,
and the celebration was complete
when the Big Game ended at Cards
13, Cal 0.
Highlights for the many years of
annual bonfires are numerous and
varied. In 192'J, NBC broadcast the
rally over its Pacific Coast network.
I Students gave up studies for three
days in 1932 to gather materials, and
the cost of the pyre was $700.
Bonfire Cancellation
That caused the cancellation of the
lire in 1933, but it was resumed in '34
when the entire University spent one
day collecting fuel for the fire, and
the cost was kept at $100.
Two freshmen, Philip Kellerman
and . Douglas Bryan, gained immor
tality when they discovered a dis
guised Cal incendiary bomb in the
193(i pyre, and thus thwarted another
attempt to light the bonfire prema
turely.
As a precautionary measure against
sabotage, 19.39's blaze was a "certified
bonfire," when every piece of fuel for
the fire was checked by the seniors.
Fires of recent years have featured
Oskie in effigy, a roadsign from the
Berkeley campus prominently placed
on top, and barrels of explosive mag
nesium shavings.

As a precautionary measure against
sabotage, 19.39's blaze was a "certified
bonfire," when every piece of fuel for
the fire was checked by the seniors.
Fires of recent years have featured
Oskie in effigy, a roadsign from the
Berkeley campus prominently placed
on top, and barrels of explosive mag
nesium shavings.
Undaunted by Cal threats, raids, and bombs, the annual Bonfire,
oldest of the Big Game traditions, has never failed through the
years to be the climax of the Big Game rally.
The 51-year-old tradition received its initiation in 1898 when
some Roble girls decided the living room was too small for their
rally. They moved outdoors wheref

they were kept warm by a fire which
was fixed by some gallant Zetes.
Ironically enough, Stanford suf
fered its first Big Game hiss that
year, 0 to 22.
After the rally iu 1900, a bonfire
was lighted on the baseball field, and
the rooters spent their time doing
fancy stunts for the first all-campus
celebration. The reaction that year
was a 5 to 0 vic tory for the Cards.
Big C Fence
Featured in the 1904 Bear funeral
pyre was Cal's esteemed "Big C"
fence which was carted around the
Bay in retaliation for the Axe theft
five years earlier. The fence was
burned as a "hoodoo" and the Indians
walloped Oskie 18 to 0.
"One of the most wonderful rallies
in the history of Stanford" was the
Daily Palo-Alto description of the 1911
Cardinal lire which took place that
year on the Inner Quad. Its effect on
the football squad was negligible as
Cal won, 21 to 3.
Alter making unsuccessful "air
raid" attempts to bomb the bonfires
of 1920 and 11)22, Cal burned the fire
to the ground for the first time in
1925. They accomplished this feat
after slipping through when the
guards ' were changing shifts. The
next day, classes were dismissed, and
another fire was ignited on schedule.
Time Bomh
A time bomb did the trick for Cal
once aguin in 1928, but the aroused
student body cut classes and in 36
hours they had amassed a second
bonfire. Lighted on time at the rally,
it was one of the most successful of
all Oskie incinerators. The Indian
eleven then tied the Bears, keeping
them from winning the Conference
championship.

! Perhaps the most triumphant rally
and bonfire ever held heralded the
return of the Axe in 1935. More than
10,000 rooters joined in the festivities,
and the celebration was complete
when the Big Game ended at Cards
13, Cal 0.
Highlights for the many years of
annual bonfires are numerous and
varied. In 192'J, NBC broadcast the
rally over its Pacific Coast network.
I Students gave up studies for three
days in 1932 to gather materials, and
the cost of the pyre was $700.
Bonfire Cancellation
That caused the cancellation of the
lire in 1933, but it was resumed in '34
when the entire University spent one
day collecting fuel for the fire, and
the cost was kept at $100.
