# Truman on Coal Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The deadlocked
coal dispute was put in President
Truman's hands today for action.
With a new coal strike threatened
in two weeks, Cyrus S. Ching, Fed
eral Mediation Service director,
turned the whole contract dispute
over to Mr. Truman as hopeless.
A quick White House decision was
expected, possibly tomorrow, in an
effort to prevent a new mine walk
out on December 1.
