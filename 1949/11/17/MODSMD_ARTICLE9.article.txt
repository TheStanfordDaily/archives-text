# Cal Leaflets Hit at Morale
## 
### 
"DEFEAT is at hand. Miserable,
ignominious, despicable, ruthless,
cruel, crushing subjection " — read
the opening lines of Cal propaganda
leaflets dropped in front of Farm
student residences yesterday.
The leaflets, printed in bright blue
ink, went on to say:
. . All is lost. If you submit
meekly we will treat you kindly—
make loving pets of you. You may
even become glorious CALIFOR
NIA'S 9th campus! You too can have
a loyalty oath and become world
famous. Liquor may be banned here
too! . . .
"IS IT NOT ATTRACTIVE? All
this we offer and more! But you
must surrender now! Do not delay!
If you refuse you will be over
whelmingly destroyed on the fatal
19th of NOVEMBER!"
Promising a return visit if they
did not hear of Stanford's uncon
ditional surrender by tonight, the
marauders signed themselves as
"The Immoral 21, representatives of
THE WORLD'S GREATEST UNI
VERSITY — University of Califor
nia."
The papers arc believed to have
been dropped from cars in front of
the various dormitories, although
nobody has yet reported actually
seeing them dropped.
