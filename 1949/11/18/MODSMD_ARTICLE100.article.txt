# Card Jayvees to Meet Cal Ramblers In Tomorrow's Big Came Preliminary
## 
### HOWARD SEARS 
Stanford's junior varsity football
squad is ready to move against their
arch rivals, the Cal Ramblers, tomor
row at 11 a.m. in the Big Game pre
liminary.
The Ramblers are rated as favorites
in tomorrow's game, but the locals
can see a victory, as they remember
the last time they met the Berkeley
reserves. Then, in 1947, the Braves
acted in true Stanford-Cal tradition;
they threw the predictions aside and
came from behind four times to up
set the visitors, 32 to 27.
The Braves have won three games
while losing two this year. The sea
son opener was a defeat at the hands
of their brother freshmen team after
the jayvees had had only three days
of practice. Since then, spirit and de
termination, along with good poten
tial ability, have rounded the team
into a smooth offensive and defen
sive unit.
Last week Coach Jim Cox's men
showed their power and scoring
punch by romping over San Francisco
State jayvees, 4G to 14. At the same
time the Ramblers were dealing
Humboldt State a 47 to 20 beating.

Stanford shut out Humboldt !>2 to (),"
several weeks ago.
The California team is a difficult
one to analyze. They have a squad
of over GO, and it is not uncommon for
them to play two games on the same
day, using entirely different players
in each game. One team plays at
Berkeley preliminary to the Bear
game, while the other one is on the
road. Altogether they have lost only
two games this season.
The Brave squad is an entirely
| different sort of organization. Some
j of the players, like quarterback Jack
Bickel, tackle Don Lucas, and others
I are definite prospects for next year's
Indians, but the majority of the boys
are the hardworking ones who have
J kept coming out lo practice all sea
son, knowing there is little possibility
of playing varsity ball.
The team has spent many of its
afternoons working with the Cardinal
eleven, setting up defensive patterns
and the like at the expense of their
j own practice time.
| It is this spirit of determination the
jayvees have shown all year that may
bring them through to a victory to
j morrow. Despite Cal's tremendous
reserve strength, the Braves feel that
they are able to match them in abil
ity at almost every position.
Bickel has proven himself as an
[able passer and quarterback in his
last few games. Tommy Rickards,
Jerry Odens, and Bill McKay are
clever and hard to stop at halfback,
j However, the locals may sorely miss
the services of sicklisted half Dean
Shephard. He was rate 1 a: one of
the team's most constant scoring
threats.
Erv Yancey, Bob Scott, and Jack
Rivenberg are the Braves' best at the
, end posts. Lucas and Ed Taylor re
inforce the tackle spots in creditable
I fashion. Both of these men have
played exceptional hall this year, and
| have helped to round the line into a
rough and well-co-ordinated body.
