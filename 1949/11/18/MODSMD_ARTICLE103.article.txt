According to The Daily of 1929,
Cal's only score in the Big Game
which Stanford won, 21 to 6, occur
red when "Benny Lom took a pass
from center, walked back about five
yards, tore off a few minutes' sleep,
counted the number of spectators in
the bleachers, and suddenly upped
and tossed a bullet pass to Bob
Thornton over the goal for six points."
