# Only Four Gridders Left in Pro Ranks
## 
### NORM RITTER 
Eleven former Stanford Big Game
| gridders have entered the play-for
j pay ranks during the pa.st nine sea-
I sons. Of these, only four are still on
' professional payrolls.
Undoubtedly the most highly her
| aided of the lot is that trio in the
| spangles of San Francisco's colorful
| '49crs—Frankie Albert, Norm Stand
j lee, and Bruno Banducci.
The fourth was also a "Wow Boy"
' in the great '40 aggregation. lie is
Vic Lindskog, No. 1 center in the
j rock-ribbed Philadelphia Eagles' for
! ward wall, which set a new league
| defensive standard last year. Only
j seven touchdowns were scored on the
j ground against the NFL's Eastern Di
! vision titlists in '48, and Lindskog re
ceived all-league mention for his
stellar play.
Surely the exploits of Albert, foot
j hall's inimitable "Prince" of quarter
! backs, and his Indian alumni team
mates need no introduction.
He came to the '49ers in 1946 as a
charter member of the infant All-
America Conference. On his tran
| script were Ail-American ratings in
; 1940 and '41 and an enviable record in
I service play with St. Mary's Pre
j Flight.
Ilis frosh and soph campaigns un
-1 der the big top were very satisfactory
—but not brilliant.
In 1948 he hit the jackpot. His team
! almost did. Cleveland's awe-inspir
| ing Browns once again stole the
league diadem from under the nose

of the Shawmen, but Albert snatched
a.few individual honors from his old
nemesis, Otto Graham.
Throws for 20 TD's
He eclipsed Sid Luckman's all-time
major league mark of 27 touchdown
passes in a season when he threw 29.
Hh cor:iph lion percentage of .583
(151 out of 264), was tops for the
season as was the '49ers total offensive
| mark of 5,770 yards.
Dame fortune had chosen to smile
j upon his ex-Indian teammates ear
lier. Big Bruno Banducci had been
! a sophomore "Wow Boy."
In the '4f)ers initial campaign he
i became an immediate sensation as
; both an offensive and defensive
J guard. "Mr. Guard" was the monick
er the applauding scribes tacked on
i the 225-pound, five-foot 10-inch
j scrapper from Richmond.
He was nosed out by Cleveland's
Bill Willis and Los Angeles' ancient
Bill Radovich for all-league honors
in 1940, but in '47 he landed on the
mythical eleven without a dissenting
vote.
Bruno Fades
But he had swilt.ly reached his
| peak. A painful shoulder separation
slowed him down perceptibly, and
| now he relieves the succeeding "Mr.
Guard." Visco Grcich.
Norm Standlee too had made a
meteoric ascent to the very pinnacle
of the profession when he joined the
i pros in 1941. He and his Card back
; field mate, Hugh Gallarneau, joined
George Halas' Chicago Bears and im
j mediately became the big guns of the
| most devastating grid attack in his
tory.
Gallarneau returned from the war
I to the Bear administrative staff;

Standlee re-donned his togs to de
fend his "greatest fullback" title from
Cleveland's Marion Motley. He was
terrific in 1946-47, slowed some in
'48, and has now given away on of
fense to Joe Perry.
Cox to '49ers
Big Hank Norberg, an Indian from
1940-42, was a crack defensive wing
man with the San Franciscans in '40
and '47, Jim Cox, present Farm jay
vee mentor, came off the fine '40 Stan
ford eleven to win a guard post with
the '49ers last year.
Two more "Wow Boys" took post
grad knocks on pro turfs. Two-time
All-American Chuck Taylor was one
of the few greats on the now-defunct
Miami Seahawks of 1940.
Pete Kmetovic, the fourth man in
the '40 backfield, played with the
postwar Detroit Lions before joining
the coaching ranks.
Fred Boensch and Bill Hachten of
the Merriman era, each had a one
year stint in the NFL. Boensch was
a popular Washington tackle before
being traded and subsequently drop
ped by the Los Angeles Rams. Hach
ten manned a guard spot for the New
York Giants.
Thus goes the story of the ever
shrinking line. It seems that the four
"old prcs," who have survived all the
game's hazards, are now posed with
the final problem. All are pressing 30,
and the scythe of Father Time is
sharper than any axe wielded by any
coach at any time.

Throws for 20 TD's
He eclipsed Sid Luckman's all-time
major league mark of 27 touchdown
passes in a season when he threw 29.
Hh cor:iph lion percentage of .583
(151 out of 264), was tops for the

Dame fortune had chosen to smile

lier. Big Bruno Banducci had been

In the '4f)ers initial campaign he
i became an immediate sensation as
; both an offensive and defensive
J guard. "Mr. Guard" was the monick
er the applauding scribes tacked on
i the 225-pound, five-foot 10-inch
j scrapper from Richmond.
He was nosed out by Cleveland's
Bill Willis and Los Angeles' ancient
Bill Radovich for all-league honors
in 1940, but in '47 he landed on the
mythical eleven without a dissenting
vote.
Bruno Fades
But he had swilt.ly reached his

Guard." Visco Grcich.
Norm Standlee too had made a
meteoric ascent to the very pinnacle
of the profession when he joined the
i pros in 1941. He and his Card back
; field mate, Hugh Gallarneau, joined
George Halas' Chicago Bears and im
j mediately became the big guns of the
| most devastating grid attack in his
tory.
Gallarneau returned from the war
I to the Bear administrative staff;

Standlee re-donned his togs to de
fend his "greatest fullback" title from
Cleveland's Marion Motley. He was
terrific in 1946-47, slowed some in
'48, and has now given away on of
fense to Joe Perry.
Cox to '49ers
Big Hank Norberg, an Indian from
1940-42, was a crack defensive wing
man with the San Franciscans in '40
and '47, Jim Cox, present Farm jay
vee mentor, came off the fine '40 Stan
ford eleven to win a guard post with
the '49ers last year.
Two more "Wow Boys" took post
grad knocks on pro turfs. Two-time
All-American Chuck Taylor was one
of the few greats on the now-defunct
Miami Seahawks of 1940.
Pete Kmetovic, the fourth man in
the '40 backfield, played with the
postwar Detroit Lions before joining
the coaching ranks.
Fred Boensch and Bill Hachten of
the Merriman era, each had a one
year stint in the NFL. Boensch was
a popular Washington tackle before
being traded and subsequently drop
ped by the Los Angeles Rams. Hach
ten manned a guard spot for the New
York Giants.
Thus goes the story of the ever
shrinking line. It seems that the four
"old prcs," who have survived all the
game's hazards, are now posed with
the final problem. All are pressing 30,
and the scythe of Father Time is
sharper than any axe wielded by any
coach at any time.

But he had swilt.ly reached his

slowed him down perceptibly, and

Guard." Visco Grcich.
Norm Standlee too had made a
meteoric ascent to the very pinnacle
of the profession when he joined the
i pros in 1941. He and his Card back
; field mate, Hugh Gallarneau, joined
George Halas' Chicago Bears and im
j mediately became the big guns of the
| most devastating grid attack in his
tory.
Gallarneau returned from the war
I to the Bear administrative staff;

Standlee re-donned his togs to de
fend his "greatest fullback" title from
Cleveland's Marion Motley. He was
terrific in 1946-47, slowed some in
'48, and has now given away on of
fense to Joe Perry.
Cox to '49ers
Big Hank Norberg, an Indian from
1940-42, was a crack defensive wing
man with the San Franciscans in '40
and '47, Jim Cox, present Farm jay
vee mentor, came off the fine '40 Stan
ford eleven to win a guard post with
the '49ers last year.
Two more "Wow Boys" took post
grad knocks on pro turfs. Two-time
All-American Chuck Taylor was one
of the few greats on the now-defunct
Miami Seahawks of 1940.
Pete Kmetovic, the fourth man in
the '40 backfield, played with the
postwar Detroit Lions before joining
the coaching ranks.
Fred Boensch and Bill Hachten of
the Merriman era, each had a one
year stint in the NFL. Boensch was
a popular Washington tackle before
being traded and subsequently drop
ped by the Los Angeles Rams. Hach
ten manned a guard spot for the New
York Giants.
Thus goes the story of the ever
shrinking line. It seems that the four
"old prcs," who have survived all the
game's hazards, are now posed with
the final problem. All are pressing 30,
and the scythe of Father Time is
sharper than any axe wielded by any
coach at any time.

Eleven former Stanford Big Game
| gridders have entered the play-for
j pay ranks during the pa.st nine sea-
I sons. Of these, only four are still on
' professional payrolls.
Undoubtedly the most highly her
| aided of the lot is that trio in the
| spangles of San Francisco's colorful
| '49crs—Frankie Albert, Norm Stand
j lee, and Bruno Banducci.
The fourth was also a "Wow Boy"
' in the great '40 aggregation. lie is
Vic Lindskog, No. 1 center in the
j rock-ribbed Philadelphia Eagles' for
! ward wall, which set a new league
| defensive standard last year. Only
j seven touchdowns were scored on the
j ground against the NFL's Eastern Di
! vision titlists in '48, and Lindskog re
ceived all-league mention for his
stellar play.
Surely the exploits of Albert, foot
j hall's inimitable "Prince" of quarter
! backs, and his Indian alumni team
mates need no introduction.
He came to the '49ers in 1946 as a
charter member of the infant All-
America Conference. On his tran
| script were Ail-American ratings in
; 1940 and '41 and an enviable record in
I service play with St. Mary's Pre
j Flight.
Ilis frosh and soph campaigns un
-1 der the big top were very satisfactory
—but not brilliant.
In 1948 he hit the jackpot. His team
! almost did. Cleveland's awe-inspir
| ing Browns once again stole the
league diadem from under the nose

of the Shawmen, but Albert snatched
a.few individual honors from his old
nemesis, Otto Graham.
Throws for 20 TD's
He eclipsed Sid Luckman's all-time
major league mark of 27 touchdown
passes in a season when he threw 29.
Hh cor:iph lion percentage of .583
(151 out of 264), was tops for the
season as was the '49ers total offensive
| mark of 5,770 yards.
Dame fortune had chosen to smile
j upon his ex-Indian teammates ear
lier. Big Bruno Banducci had been
! a sophomore "Wow Boy."
In the '4f)ers initial campaign he
i became an immediate sensation as
; both an offensive and defensive
J guard. "Mr. Guard" was the monick
er the applauding scribes tacked on
i the 225-pound, five-foot 10-inch
j scrapper from Richmond.
He was nosed out by Cleveland's
Bill Willis and Los Angeles' ancient
Bill Radovich for all-league honors
in 1940, but in '47 he landed on the
mythical eleven without a dissenting
vote.
