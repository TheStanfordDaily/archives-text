# BIRTHDAY
## Stadium To Observe 28th 
### 
Tomorrow will I c the twenty
eighth birthday for Stanford Stadium.
It was on November 1!), l'J2l that
California's Wonder Team came to
town to help dedicate the Stadium,
With a Rose Bowl bid hanging in
the balance, the Bears chalked up
a 42 to 7 win and rolled cn into Pasa
dena.
Completion of the Stadium less
than six months after the ground
breaking v/as an outstanding engi
neering feat.
The plans for the Stadium were
originally drawn up by three Stan
ford professors in the engineering
department. Plans were immediately
started to raise the money by sub
scriptions. The construction contracts
were awarded in the middle of May,
and the wcrlc of setting up labor
camps began immediately.
Wilbur Breaks Ground
Ground-breaking ceremonies took
place on June 1, 1921. After a meet
ing at the Assembly Hall, the student
fcody paraded out t.:> the site of the
Stadium, led by the Stanford Band.
As the late Dr. J'av Lyman Wil
bur, then President rf the Univer
sity, turned the first spade of sod,
he said, "As I put this spade into
the soil of the Stanford Farm I hope
that it will start a new era for Stan
ford. May this Stadium always
stand a symbol to good sportsman
ship and clean manhood."
The spade that Dr. Wilbur used
that day took the place of The Axe,
which at that time was still in the
custody of the University of Cali
fornia. The Spade Yell v/as written,
which served in place of the Axe
Yell until the Axe was recovered by
the immortal 21 of Sequoia Hall.
Stadium First a Horseshoe
When the Stadium was first com
pleted, it was in the shape of a per
fect horseshoe holding 65,000 people.
It was the largest Stadium in the West,
at that time.
In 1924 the Southern end was par
tially closed in. Stanford's Sunken
Diamond now rests in the hole that
was cxcavated to provide the dirt
for the expansion. Fourteen rows of
seats were added to the top of the
Stadium in 1927 to bring it to its
present day capacity of 90,000 people.
From 1527 to it was the largest,
privately owned stadium in the coun
try. This year the University of
Michigan enlarged its staciium to hold
97.000 spectators to surpass Stanford.
Tomorrow's game will be the
twelfth renewal of hostilities between
California and Standord on the Sta
dium turf. To date the Indians have
claimed six Bear scalps with Bears
taking home a win five times.

Wilbur Breaks Ground
Ground-breaking ceremonies took
place on June 1, 1921. After a meet
ing at the Assembly Hall, the student
fcody paraded out t.:> the site of the
Stadium, led by the Stanford Band.
As the late Dr. J'av Lyman Wil
bur, then President rf the Univer
sity, turned the first spade of sod,
he said, "As I put this spade into
the soil of the Stanford Farm I hope
that it will start a new era for Stan
ford. May this Stadium always
stand a symbol to good sportsman
ship and clean manhood."
The spade that Dr. Wilbur used
that day took the place of The Axe,
which at that time was still in the
custody of the University of Cali
fornia. The Spade Yell v/as written,
which served in place of the Axe
Yell until the Axe was recovered by
the immortal 21 of Sequoia Hall.
Stadium First a Horseshoe
When the Stadium was first com
pleted, it was in the shape of a per
fect horseshoe holding 65,000 people.
It was the largest Stadium in the West,
at that time.
In 1924 the Southern end was par
tially closed in. Stanford's Sunken
Diamond now rests in the hole that
was cxcavated to provide the dirt
for the expansion. Fourteen rows of
seats were added to the top of the
Stadium in 1927 to bring it to its
present day capacity of 90,000 people.
From 1527 to it was the largest,
privately owned stadium in the coun
try. This year the University of
Michigan enlarged its staciium to hold
97.000 spectators to surpass Stanford.
