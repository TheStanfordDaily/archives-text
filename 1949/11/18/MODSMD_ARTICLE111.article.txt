# Rallies Foster Red Tradition
## 
### 
The first Big Game rally, in 1898,
was the start of many traditions.
Women in those clays were required
to occupy gallery seats only, and no
! one was allowed in the rooting sec
tion without his student body card
I and a rooter's cap. The practice of
burning an enormous bonfire, then
performed on the baseball Held, was
initiated during the earliest rallies.
A good part of the rally in 1!)08 was
carried on in the inner quad, where
j speeches by the coaches and gradu
| ate students were the highlight of
j the evening. Streamers of red 'n
| white crepe paper all but covered
j the ground on which the rooters ser
pentined.
In 1918 rally spirit had risen to a
peak, and rooters began to put more
into their celebration. The SATC
! (Students Army Training Corps)
inarched into the assembly to the
tunc of "Sons of the Stanford Red,''
amid an avalanche of streamers from
i the galleries. Coach Livernash's only
statement conccrnin j; the pep of the
| rooters was: "If you boost the team a.i
you've done before, California's blue
will turn green with envy, and if you
I yell like you have tonight, I have little
I doubts that Cal's gold will turn ycl
; low!"
Pranksters set off the big game pyre
:a day ahead of schedule in 1928, and
the entire structure had to be rebuilt
in a day's time, much to the indigna
tion of long-sulTering Frosh.
