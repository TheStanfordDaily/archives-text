## 
### Howard Sears 
These days in any grid game, Big j
or otherwise, it becomes obvious j
that the football field and its im- j
mediately surrounding area have be
otv.' more than a space set t.sidc j
to allow 22 young men to pursue an
[ inflated spheroid.
As spectators have observed every ;
Saturday a host of persons are on |
the sidelines and in the space around j
the field. The functions of all these '
people c.re varied and complex, and j
I ten bring confusion to the layman j
in the strtnds.
Tomorrow, for instance, one will |
see about 50 press cameramen. They
will fce allowed anywhere, except,
on the actual playing field, during
the first quarter. After that they i
will he directed to stay clear of the
players benches between the 35 yard
lines.
Closely allied to the cameramen
are several motorcycle messengers
whose job it will be to rush pic
i tures as soon as they arc taken from
j the field to San Francisco papers.
Television cameramen and crews
r<dd another half dozen to the total,
and the telephone crews directing J
the scoreboards, public address sys- j
i tcm and reporting to the press box l
i account for four more.
To keep fans back during the game
!;0 student police will be spaced at
intervals around the perimeter of the |
j field and ten uniformed police will
| guard the main stairways.
All of these together with officials, j
timekeepers, various coaches, train- |
ors, managers, physicians, and a few I
others make over 175 people with of- |
ficial business on the field. Each team |
[ will have over 40 players suited to j
i bring the grand total nearly 300.
