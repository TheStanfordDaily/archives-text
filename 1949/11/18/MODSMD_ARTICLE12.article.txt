# BERKELEY BELL TOWER
## Cracking Campanile Houses Bones, Causes Headache to Stale Budget 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Campanile, Cal's famed splin
ter landmark, has such a bad case of
failing granite and yawing walls that
the state legislature has voted $15.000
for Repairs. An official report places
' the casualty list as "427 stones."
Meanwhile California engineers
have dropped plumb lines down the
ddes of the ailing toothpick to meas
ure any twists or leans the tower
may develop. The top of each plumb
line is attached to the end of a long
I plank, strong, limber boards which
resemble nothing .so much as diving
boards. In noting this similarity, The
Daily Californian, suggests the ob
! vious course for liquorless students
j and disloyal professors.
The tower, which began crack

ing up in 1927, today houses a set of
rope-operated bells and a collection
of paleontolic bones. According to
one source, the bones are the re
mains of the '09 (1509) football team
which was crashed by Stanford that
year, 44 boulders to nothing.
In 1947, Stanford men barely failed
to hang a block S on Ihe side clock.
The story has it that the skeleton
of the left half on the third floor
tripped the climber.
At all odds, as the Big Game ap
proaches, public interest in the tall
white elephant is declining.
As -one Stanford rooter put it,
"Moor the damn thing to the Bay
Bridge and let's get on with the
game."
