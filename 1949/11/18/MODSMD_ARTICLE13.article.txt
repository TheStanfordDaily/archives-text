# War Halts Stanford Football So Cal Turns on Little Brother
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Even during the war years when !
the big red machine had been tempo
rarily stowed away in the garage,
Big Game rivalry was rolling as
usual.
| Stanford was invited by their East
| Bay rivals to attend the Cal-UCLA j
j game in 1943. Maybe this invitation
I came about because members of the
I weaker sex are friendlier, but, in any
| case, Loth the ASSU and ASUC
presidents were girls.
Down on the Farm, students re- ;
! :->ponded like a tornado, much to the
| surprise of all concerned. Within a
1 half hour, the first block of 800 ticâ€”
| kets sent from Berkeley was sold j
! out. Requests for more were made,
I and by game time a total of 1270 |
tickets had been sold. Stanford stu

dents also cornered the market of
a'l rooter's caps and pom-poms in
the area.
Biff ( lame Rally
A Big Game rally with the tradi
tional bonfire was planned. It dif
fered from the usual rally in that
one of its purposes was to teach Cal
and UCLA songs and yells so that
Stanford could non-partisaniy .sup
port both rootitir.; sections.
On Saturday morning and after
noon, streams of students poured
across the Bay Bridge, probably to
the amazement of the toll collectors
who thought they could rest from
the northern invasions for a lew
years.
The newly organized Stanford
band, composed largely of military
personnel stationed on campus, added

its music to that of tlie other bands.
And Stanford displayed good sports
manship as it rooted for both teams.
Down on the field distributed be
tween the two teams were over a
dozen players who once had worn
cardinal jerseys.
No Axe
Although the axe was not in evi
dence at the game, old time rivalry
was far from hidden as the Cal
stands came over to serenade the
Stanford (and UCLA) side after the
game.
The precedent having been set in
1i)43, the following year Stanford
again accepted Cal's invitation to
attend their homecoming game this
time with USC. The axe was dis
played at the rally.
That year the Injun tribe was far
better organized. The Indians per
formed card stunts at half time, the
cards being supplied by Cal. Events
of the weekend were climaxed with
the pom-pon prom, an all campus
dance.
