# Loyalty Oath, Prohibition Are Chief Cal Grievances
## Faculty Objects To Anti-Red Rule 
### 
The California campus is in the
j national limelight over the determi
| nation of the Board of Regents to
make all faculty members and em
ployees sign a loyalty oath. The pur
pose of this oath is to assure that
there are no Communists in the uni
versity.
The document adopted by the
Board of Regents stated that the
university is dedicated to the search
for truth and is full exposition and
that the Regents' primary obligation
is to stand steadfastly for this free
j dom and at the same time share with
| the faculty the responsibility of keep
ing the university free from those
who would destroy its freedom. It
states further that Communist policy
is determined to gain control over
thoughts and expression of thoughts
by the individual.
To the observer on campus it
seems that both students and fac
ulty object, although over CO per
cent of faculty members have signed
the oath.
An academic senate of faculty
| members has been formed to oppose
the Board of Regents. It was given
the support of the Executive Com
mittee of the ASUC in its stand
1 against signing.
The following arguments have
j been presented against the oath:
1. It is a definite breach of aca
demic freedom.
2. Communists would not hesi
tate to sign, so the effectiveness is
lost.
3. As a public relations measure
it is a failure, ft intimates that
there are Communists on the cam
pus.
4. A rule already exists which
prohibits the university from hir
ing Communists.
5. It is a violation of the state
constitution which requires only
I the oath of allegiance as qualifica
tion for teaching.
What the outcome of the dispute
. will be is difficult to say. The Board
' of Regents holds fast to its belief
I that the oath will protect education
1 from those who would seek to de
i stroy freedom of the mind. The aca
; demic senate is just as determined
! in its opposition.
