# Students Weep, Toss Out Bars
## 
### DICK MOORE 
What's been the biggest topic of
| bull sessions on the Cat campus for
! the past few weeks, other than the
Big Game? a long faced frater
t nity man whom you'll find crying
I into his orange juice and he'll tell
you "Not even !5.2 is left."
On "black Wednesday," Nov. 2, in-
I nocent looking letters addressed to
lull living groups turned out to be
atomic bombs against an old Cali
! i'ornia institution. Among other rules,
j which the administration claimed ha.l
| been in existence but were not
enforced, was the unwelcome 1-c,
"No intoxicating beverages shall be
J served by such groups at any lunc
j tion, regardless of where it is held."
Fraternity reaction was fast. By
I afternoon lawns had blossomed into
| displays against the liquor ban, and
protesting posters appeared by the
dozens. One read "First the Loyalty
Oath, Now the Temperance Ruling
Next: Sex? Another, "Anyone Seen
Our Old Granddad?" Bar:; were
j torn out of cellars and placed on
j the lawn to serve lemonade and
J grape juice which hadn't fermenled.
A sorority sent a '.illy of the valley
j to the Phi Sig house wrapped in a
| black mourning band. The Phi Sigs
1 sent back lour roses.
President (ii)jec(s
Even the student-body president
Dan Coelho was taken by surprise,
! and commented in the Daily Cali
| lornian, "I disagree completely with
I the procedure followed by the Uni
i versity Wednesday. I am disap
j pointed in the administration. We
j consider ourselves ad nils, account -
! able to the President and the Re
| gents. But in this matter they've
| looked at us as kids."
Coelho made the rounds of about
j 20 houses and talked to the students
j urging them not to make any demon-
I strations. His efforts must have
worked, for the signs quickly came
down and most of the fraternity
houses agreed to follow the regula
| tions without further comment. By
j Friday only a few remnants of the
j reaction could be found. One of these
I posters was se v en over a water foun
j Lain and read, "University Approved,
j 0 per cent by content."
"Like Adolescents"
Although the posters disappeared,
the feelings did not. One fraternity
| man, in an interview with the Daily,
| said, "They treat us like adolescents
| on the liquor problem and expect us
: to act like adults during Big Game
! week. It won't work."
So the question exists whether the
liquor ban will succeed in stopping
vandalism or cause more trouble.
i Most student opinion believes the
; administration has made a mistake
in the abruptness and timing of the
injunction, and many are just plain
! sad.
Whatever the case is, Big Game
j week is gloomy in more than one
way for the teetotaling Californians
| as they try to follow the prophetic
words of tlve slogan, "Cheer up with
! 7-Up."
