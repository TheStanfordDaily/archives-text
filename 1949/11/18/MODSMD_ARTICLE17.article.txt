## 
### 
The Civil Aeronautics Authority
asks ihat no nonessential aircralt
fliyhts be made over the Stanford
University Stadium area during
Saturday's Big Game with the Uni
versity of California.
Tom Barber, CAA supervising
agent in Palo Alt'), has made a
written requestâ€”to be posted at all
airports in the area- that all flyers
avoid this district unless their flights
are absolutely necessary.
CAA regulations provide that air
craft flying over a congested area
observe a minimum of 1.000 feet.
