# Farm Rooters Sit on Sunny Side Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford will take the sunny side
of the stadium tomorrow. Women
rooters will enter Gate A and sit in
Section E. Men rooters and couples
will enter Gate I, the men sitting
in Sections DD and D and couples
in CC and C.
All rooters must wear white and
present student body cards.
Police Chief Gordon Davis warned
on-campus students not to attempt
to drive to the game. Before the
game roads leading from campus to
the stadium will be blocked in the
Stern-Toyon area. After the game
all roads will be open, and traffic
will be directed at all intersections.
No cars will be allowed to park
on Arguello, which runs from the
stadium, past Stern, and meets the
Row at Russell House. Since this is
the main artery back to campus, it
must be kept open.
Traffic from the Row to Palo Alto
will be directed past the Engineer
ing corner and behind Memorial
Church to the Chemistry Building
and thence to Palm Drive.
Residences are asked to see that
as many students as possible park
their cars in Jots behind the resi
dences, so that their guests may use
the front, parking places.
