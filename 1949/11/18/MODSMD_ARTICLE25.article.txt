# Sequoia 21 Immortal Part of Farm History
## 
### BARBARA METZGER 
Top secret! Those were the key
words of the Immortal 21. For four
years the 21 men from old Sequoia
Hall, headed by ringleader Don
Kropp, organized attacks to regain
the Stanford Axe.
Three times the attacks were un
successful. In '27 Moroni Jameson
actually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank but he couldn't break
away. In '28 the Axe custodian fell
on the Axe when he was tackled,
and the delay gave the frosh time to
surge forward making escape im
possible. In '29 the Stanfordites
were recognized.
But it was on Tuesday, April 1,
1930, that they met to plan an April
Fool's hoax considered one of the
most ingenious gang raids ever car
ried out in the Bay Area. The plan:
to recapture the Stanford Axe, held
by Berkeley for 31 years. Fake cam
eramen were to be stationed near
the American Trust Company Bank
when the urmored car containing the
Axe would return from a rally in
the Greek Theater.
