# Task Force
## 
### 
At 4:30 Thursday afternoon three
cars slid out from behind the Stan
ford Mausoleum, the final meeting

place. Each driver had his orders,
Eric Hill was to proceed to Alston
Way, east of Shattuck Avenue, and
join the Cal frosh in their march to
the bank to get the Axe. Berry Li
ken's car was bound for South
Berkeley where the fellows hastened
to the Greek Theater. Kropp and
Jim Trimmingham went to Oakland,
and rented a Buick roadster from
Hertz Drive-Yourself Service.
At the rally ihe 21 men edged into
the heart of the bowl so they could
get near the Axe, Howard Avery
was almost kicked out for igniting
a broom which he was swinging
merrily during the Cal hymn.

Ten minutes before the rally
closed five Indians sneaked out.
They were the fake cameraman,
Ray Walsh; Warren Gage; Trim
mingham, driver of the get - away
car; Art Miller; and Kropp.
They drove to the bank and rigged
up the camera in the rumble seat
just before the black, steel-covered
Studebaker drove up carrying the
Axe, its custodian Norm Horner,
an armed guard, and the driver.
"A Good Shot"
Fake cameramen kept shouting
"Let's have a good shot at the Axe!"
The frosh guards grinned and posed,
but Horner stayed in the armored

car. Just as he stepped out, Avery
pounced from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe away, and passed
it through several hands to Loof
bourow.
Loofbourow tucked the Axe under
his brown sweater and walked to
the camera car. Trimmingham

] stepped on the gas and zipped back
to campus in 50 minutes.
Miller threw a tear gas bomb in
front of the bank, scattering the
crowd and giving Kropp and Miller
time to ransack the armored car to
make sure they had got the real
Axe.
