If you would be a pigskin gambler,
Hear this word of my advice—
Anyone can be in error once,
But only fools will be wrong twice.
The odds on last year's Stanford game
Were a fearsome ten-to-one;
And this year, much like last
We got by, lucky, with an extra One.
So get you up to Reno,
Be a denizen of its gambling joints,
But when the Big Game rolls around,
For gosh sake DON'T GIVE POINTS!!!

For the fifty-second time the football teams
of Stanford and California will clash on the
football field tomorrow afternoon in a contest
known to alumni and sports enthusiasts around
the world as the Big Game.
This tradition of a Big Game is an amazing
thing—almost fantastic. The idea that winning
this one football game can make a successful
season out of an otherwise all-losing one is a
source of wonderment to outsiders who have
been schooled in the tradition of win 'em all
or else.
It's little wonder that whenever Stanford and
Cal people get together, regardless of the sea
son, the question will always arise, "Who's
going to win the Big Game?"
There's been some fine football played be
tween these two teams. The 1924 game in
which Stanford scored two field goals, a touch
down, and a conversion in the closing minutes
to gain a 20 to 20 tie, has been called the
greatest of all time. The thrill of the '47 game
will always stand out in our minds. Names like
Grayson, Shipkey, Cuddeback, and Corbus
have become immortal in Big Game competi
tion.
Yet, whether the two teams are fighting it out
for the right to represent the West in the Rose
Bowl as they will tomorrow, or whether they're
battling to stay out of the Conference Cellar,
it's still the Big Game for thousands of alumni
scattered throughout the world.
That's because the Big Game stands for a
spirit, a tradition, an undefinable something
that's more than just a football game.
We've noticed a new spirit around the cam
pus this week—a spirit of pride and confidence
in our team. Others have noticed it too and

have made comments on it. We're not out for
a moral victory this year—to lose, but with
honor. We're going to win, and there's barely
a person on the campus who'll toll you dif
ferent.
Good luck, Big Red. Get that Axe!
We know you can. We know you will.

greatest of all time. The thrill of the '47 game
will always stand out in our minds. Names like
Grayson, Shipkey, Cuddeback, and Corbus
have become immortal in Big Game competi
tion.
Yet, whether the two teams are fighting it out
for the right to represent the West in the Rose
Bowl as they will tomorrow, or whether they're
battling to stay out of the Conference Cellar,
it's still the Big Game for thousands of alumni
scattered throughout the world.
That's because the Big Game stands for a
spirit, a tradition, an undefinable something
that's more than just a football game.
We've noticed a new spirit around the cam
pus this week—a spirit of pride and confidence
in our team. Others have noticed it too and

have made comments on it. We're not out for
a moral victory this year—to lose, but with
honor. We're going to win, and there's barely
a person on the campus who'll toll you dif
ferent.
Good luck, Big Red. Get that Axe!
We know you can. We know you will.
If you would be a pigskin gambler,
Hear this word of my advice—
Anyone can be in error once,
But only fools will be wrong twice.
The odds on last year's Stanford game
Were a fearsome ten-to-one;
And this year, much like last
We got by, lucky, with an extra One.
So get you up to Reno,
Be a denizen of its gambling joints,
But when the Big Game rolls around,
For gosh sake DON'T GIVE POINTS!!!

For the fifty-second time the football teams
of Stanford and California will clash on the
football field tomorrow afternoon in a contest
known to alumni and sports enthusiasts around
the world as the Big Game.
This tradition of a Big Game is an amazing
thing—almost fantastic. The idea that winning
this one football game can make a successful
season out of an otherwise all-losing one is a
source of wonderment to outsiders who have
been schooled in the tradition of win 'em all
or else.
It's little wonder that whenever Stanford and
Cal people get together, regardless of the sea
son, the question will always arise, "Who's
going to win the Big Game?"
There's been some fine football played be
tween these two teams. The 1924 game in
which Stanford scored two field goals, a touch
down, and a conversion in the closing minutes
to gain a 20 to 20 tie, has been called the
greatest of all time. The thrill of the '47 game
will always stand out in our minds. Names like
