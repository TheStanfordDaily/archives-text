# A 						Word of Praise to '53; Let's Keep the Slate Clean

Vandalism, regardless of agreements be
tween Stanford and California, seems to be an
inevitable by-product of the Big Game hysteria.
Attempts are always made to paint and burn
marks of school spirit on the foe's campus.
The Stanford freshmen have for years taken
the responsibility of preventing any such dam
age on our campus, and this year the Class of
'53 deserves credit for one of the finest guard
ing jobs we've seen.
Elaborate patrols and warning systems have
developed from the guarding tradition, and this
year's frosh haven't lacked for ideas. They set
up radio cars, two-way radios at key guard
posts, even a master radio control and a 24-hour
telephone operator for the reporting of raids.
In short, the situation is well in hand, thanks
to the Class of '53.
However, there is always the danger of over
enthusiasm, and serious accidents have re
sulted in the past. So far this year, no personal
injuries have been reported, other than a few
shaved* heads, although there have been sev
eral minor traffic accidents that resulted from
sheer over-enthusiasm.
The record is good so far ... . careful
driving and common sense can keep Big Game
spirit from getting out of hand.
