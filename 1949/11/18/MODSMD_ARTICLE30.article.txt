# 'Biggest' Big Game Edition
## 
### 
Today's 16-page Big Game Edition is the
largest ever printed by The Daily.
Much credit is due Sports Editor John Breier
and his fine staff for its preparation. Bob
Bernstein, Norm Ritter, Howard Soars, and Jack
Little were particularly helpful.
We wish also to acknowledge the photo
graphic assistance of Dick Keeblc.
