# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
We give you this morning a complete, up-to-the
minute, exacting roundup of current, last-minute bed
lam called BULL SESSION'S BIG GAME BULLE
TINS:
FLASH, FROM THE FOOTBALL FRONT: The odd

odds-makers in the City say Cali
fornia by 3-5. Subtract that from
the 1947 and '48 odds and game
scores, and you get Stanford win
ning by 62 points. That makes
Idaho one point better than Cali
fornia.
Stanford's football team went
through its last regular practice
in typical fired-up Big Game
fashion. That's enough for me. I
hope it's enough for Pappy.

FLASH, FROM THE FACULTY FRONT: The
raatest maneuver in faculty ran-ra:i history took
place last Wednesday morn, when Rixford Snyder
opened his Canadian History lecture with "I had a
ad dream last night that California defeated Stanford
n the Big Game.because the Bonfire Rally was lacking
) students couldn't attend because they had to
-ly for a Friday morning history exam. This is a

terrible thing.. I therefore propose that Ihe exam be
cancelled and everybody turn out for the rally
After the 15-minute demonstration had died down
and the strains of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow" had
hit their last chord, Snyder went on to finish his lec
ture. But, his contribution to Big Game Week will
live on forever.
FLASH, FROM THE DATE FRONT: Ruble girls
are screaming for dates. Casa Ventura girls are
screaming for dates. Durand girls arc screaming for
dates. Just to mention a few. So, if there are any
males around who would like a screaming date, just
hit any of the above-mentioned spots.
FLASH. FROM THE BONFIRE FRONT: Just like
a Chesterfield last night. Just like a Chesterfield.
FLASH, FROM THE TICKET FRONT: Anybody
want to buy a ticket? I've got four extra.
FLASH, FROM THE GAIETIES FRONT: Like the
Big Game Chaparral, like the Big Game bonfire, like
the Big Game air invasion of Cal, like the Big Game
Week campus protection by Encin.-i, THIS YEAR'S
EDITION OF THE GAIETIES IS THE BEST OF ALL
TIME. Could that mean something?
FLASH, FROM THE PARADE 1 RONT: It goes to
night. It goes tonight. It goes tonight.
FLASH, FROM THE DAILY FRONT: Hall just
fainted from all the excitement.

cancelled and everybody turn out for the rally
After the 15-minute demonstration had died down
and the strains of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow" had
hit their last chord, Snyder went on to finish his lec
ture. But, his contribution to Big Game Week will
live on forever.
FLASH, FROM THE DATE FRONT: Ruble girls
are screaming for dates. Casa Ventura girls are
screaming for dates. Durand girls arc screaming for
dates. Just to mention a few. So, if there are any
males around who would like a screaming date, just
hit any of the above-mentioned spots.
FLASH. FROM THE BONFIRE FRONT: Just like
a Chesterfield last night. Just like a Chesterfield.
FLASH, FROM THE TICKET FRONT: Anybody
want to buy a ticket? I've got four extra.
FLASH, FROM THE GAIETIES FRONT: Like the
Big Game Chaparral, like the Big Game bonfire, like
the Big Game air invasion of Cal, like the Big Game
Week campus protection by Encin.-i, THIS YEAR'S
EDITION OF THE GAIETIES IS THE BEST OF ALL
TIME. Could that mean something?
FLASH, FROM THE PARADE 1 RONT: It goes to
night. It goes tonight. It goes tonight.
FLASH, FROM THE DAILY FRONT: Hall just
fainted from all the excitement.

We give you this morning a complete, up-to-the
minute, exacting roundup of current, last-minute bed
lam called BULL SESSION'S BIG GAME BULLE
TINS:
FLASH, FROM THE FOOTBALL FRONT: The odd

odds-makers in the City say Cali
fornia by 3-5. Subtract that from
the 1947 and '48 odds and game
scores, and you get Stanford win
ning by 62 points. That makes
Idaho one point better than Cali
fornia.
Stanford's football team went
through its last regular practice
in typical fired-up Big Game
fashion. That's enough for me. I
hope it's enough for Pappy.

FLASH, FROM THE FACULTY FRONT: The
raatest maneuver in faculty ran-ra:i history took
place last Wednesday morn, when Rixford Snyder
opened his Canadian History lecture with "I had a
ad dream last night that California defeated Stanford
n the Big Game.because the Bonfire Rally was lacking
) students couldn't attend because they had to
-ly for a Friday morning history exam. This is a

terrible thing.. I therefore propose that Ihe exam be
cancelled and everybody turn out for the rally
