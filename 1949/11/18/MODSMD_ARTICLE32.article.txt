# Colorful Activities Highlight Game Celebrations of Past and Present
## Band Shows Teamwork 
### GORDON ADDISON 
On a table-top gridiron are born
the colorful Stanford Band forma
tions which share the limelight in the
half-time periods of the Indian's foot
ball games.
This is only one part of the process
which is climaxed with intricate ma
neuvers at 3:30 every Saturday after
noon. When the theme for the band
stunts is dreamed up over a pitcher
of beer, in an art appreciation class,
or at the Sunday Evening Movie se
rials, the planning procedure always
takes the same general form.
The band tacticians, known as the
formations committee, gather around
the table in the band house. The table
top, painted in special "Stadium
grass-green" is marked with white
lines and end zones. The rest of the
equipment consists of graph drawing
paper and a group of miniature white
checkers labeled IG, 68, 7H, etc.,
representing each band member.
From then on the number of pos
sible formations is limited only by
the ingenuity of the committee who
slides the checkers into various de
signs.
Planning Stunts
Only 20 men in the 80-piecc band
have to know the half-time stunt.
The pictures are planned so that each
row moves as a unit, with the two
end men being the leaders and the
others trailing along Indian fashion.
Tuesday nights the formations
move off the planning table and on
to the practice field. For three hours
the musicians, armed with instru
ments and heavy coats, trudge around
the lighted varsity football field,
learning the stunt for the following
Saturday.
The lines, already drawn for var
sity scrimmages, arc yard-marked
with shoes boxes so the 20 row lead
ers will know exactly where to form
the outline for each formation.
The moving stunts which the In
dian Band plans for the most impor
tant games arc the most difficult. In
the Santa Clara game, it was the
frowning Jack O'Lantern which
winked arid smiled; at USC, it was a
moving pump handle and a horse
with moving legs which pulled a free
wheeling "surrey with the fringe on
top."
Jack's Stunts
As Jack Blumberg, the "madman"
behind most of the complex forma
tions, decides whether the band
should kneel for each stunt, the
chemistry majors arc solving other
problems. Greatest of these was the
creation of a cloud of smoke when
the band ignited and fired a cannon
which it formed at the UCLA game
last year. After reading up on the art
of pyrotechnics, one of the tubas pro
duced a railroad torch which did the
job.
There arc always problems which
interfere with rehearsals, such as labs
scheduled for Thursday afternoon
and Saturday morning when the
band puts in another three hours of
marching time, before the game.
There is also the Irish setter that
barks at the ack-ack fire of the drum
section and grabs at the pant leg of
his favorite clarinet player. One
night "Red" had to be banished from
the field, and the band closcd the
gates for a "secret practicc."
The result—no secret plays—but a
military band which struts down the
field at the speed of 180 steps per
minute, half again faster than the
standard army cadence.

interfere with rehearsals, such as labs
scheduled for Thursday afternoon
and Saturday morning when the
band puts in another three hours of
marching time, before the game.
There is also the Irish setter that
barks at the ack-ack fire of the drum
section and grabs at the pant leg of
his favorite clarinet player. One
night "Red" had to be banished from
the field, and the band closcd the
gates for a "secret practicc."
The result—no secret plays—but a
military band which struts down the
field at the speed of 180 steps per
minute, half again faster than the
standard army cadence.
On a table-top gridiron are born
the colorful Stanford Band forma
tions which share the limelight in the
half-time periods of the Indian's foot
ball games.
This is only one part of the process
which is climaxed with intricate ma
neuvers at 3:30 every Saturday after
noon. When the theme for the band
stunts is dreamed up over a pitcher
of beer, in an art appreciation class,
or at the Sunday Evening Movie se
rials, the planning procedure always
takes the same general form.
The band tacticians, known as the
formations committee, gather around
the table in the band house. The table
top, painted in special "Stadium
grass-green" is marked with white
lines and end zones. The rest of the
equipment consists of graph drawing
paper and a group of miniature white
checkers labeled IG, 68, 7H, etc.,
representing each band member.
From then on the number of pos
sible formations is limited only by
the ingenuity of the committee who
slides the checkers into various de
signs.
Planning Stunts
Only 20 men in the 80-piecc band
have to know the half-time stunt.
The pictures are planned so that each
row moves as a unit, with the two
end men being the leaders and the
others trailing along Indian fashion.
Tuesday nights the formations
move off the planning table and on
to the practice field. For three hours
the musicians, armed with instru
ments and heavy coats, trudge around
the lighted varsity football field,
learning the stunt for the following
Saturday.
The lines, already drawn for var
sity scrimmages, arc yard-marked
with shoes boxes so the 20 row lead
ers will know exactly where to form
the outline for each formation.
The moving stunts which the In
dian Band plans for the most impor
tant games arc the most difficult. In
the Santa Clara game, it was the
frowning Jack O'Lantern which
winked arid smiled; at USC, it was a
moving pump handle and a horse
with moving legs which pulled a free
wheeling "surrey with the fringe on
top."
Jack's Stunts
As Jack Blumberg, the "madman"
behind most of the complex forma
tions, decides whether the band
should kneel for each stunt, the
chemistry majors arc solving other
problems. Greatest of these was the
creation of a cloud of smoke when
the band ignited and fired a cannon
which it formed at the UCLA game
last year. After reading up on the art
of pyrotechnics, one of the tubas pro
duced a railroad torch which did the
job.
There arc always problems which
interfere with rehearsals, such as labs
scheduled for Thursday afternoon
and Saturday morning when the
