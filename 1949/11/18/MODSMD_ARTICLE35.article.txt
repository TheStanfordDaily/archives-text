# Cardinal Waves From Carmel To Marin Tomorrow
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
That Cardinal will be waving from
Marin County to Carmel tomorrow
night.
When the final gun sounds, Stan
ford rooters (and Cal rooters too) will
scatter to hotels, night clubs, and
mountain chatcaus to celebrate the
biggest weekend of the year.
In the old days, when red tile roofs
sheltered only 4,000 students, the
Farm moved en masse to Monterey.
There, in resorts by the bay, Stan
ford students sang songs of victory
or, if the team had lost, muttered,
"next year!"
Now, however, with the population
doubled, Stanford has expanded its
celebration area. San Francisco ho
tels will be the scene of much cheer
ing and singing. Many fraternities
will go halves with their Cal brothers
and stage a joint celebration. Other
groups will take to the hills, visiting
popular Peninsula eating and dancing
places.
Many Indians will stay at home and
attend the Big Game dance in the
pavilion, the only all-campus function
that night.
But, unhappily for the Stanford fe
male and her reputation, a large share
of the Farm's beauties will stay at
home on the big evening. A Daily
checkup of 1948 showed that "one
third of the women on campus who
go out regularly on weekends DO
NOT have dates Big Game night." If
past experience is guide, this phe
nomenon will occur again.
As to the Stanford woman who does
have a date tradition says that she
will pay half the tariff. But of late,
many Stanford couples have point
edly ignored this custom. Roughs
who feel that their girls consume too
much, however, can always point out,
"It's an old tradition."
Whichever team wins, the Cardi
nal and the Blue and the Gold will
spread themselves thick over the bay
area. And they won't hesitate to tell
those who do not watch television
about the Big Game of 1949.
