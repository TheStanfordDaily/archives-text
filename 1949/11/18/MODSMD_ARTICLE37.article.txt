# Dad Had Day Yelling For LSJU, Ow Wow Oi!

### JOAN HARZFELD 
Notables of the 90s were stolidly
seated in the Quad beneath a canopy
of American flags, when the Stanford
Class of 1891 burst out with:
"Wah Hoo! Wah Hoo!
L! S! J! U!
Stanford!"
Assembled dignitaries were upset,
and the Lclatid Stanfords registered
disapproval. But despite them all, the
Stanford students had come up with
the first organized yell of the Uni
versity. No one knows who thought
it up; it had been passed around din -
ing the ceremony by word of mouth.
Even in 1891 there was Stanford-
Cal rivalry. Naturally, the U of C
came in for a great deal of razzing
from the roughs on the Farm. One
example is the chant: "Hah, Hah, Hah,
Ca'iforn-yah!" The period of this,
and other old high school yells came
before the university had decided on
its permanent colors, cheers, and
songs.
Rush the Ball
The weeks before the first Big Game
found Stanford without a fight song,
so Pember S. Castleman, '95, came
through with "Rush the Ball Along."
This rousing number had the privi
lege of being Stanford's first real
song. It was quickly followed by
"Eleven Men With a Pigskin Bag,"
written by Martin W. Sampson, an
assistant professor in the English De
partment.
Between 1895 and 1905 well-wish
ers had contributed 81 songs to
LSJU. Even David • Star Jordan,
first Stanford president, offered a
number entitled "A Football Song."
If Stanford lost the Big Game, the
melody for the song would be "Dust,
Ashes, Dead and Done With."
Stanford's hymn had a quiet and
unassuming birth in 1892. Professor
and Mrs. Albert W. Smith, who col-

I a bora led on the piece, tried it out
oil dinner guests. The assembled
guests unanimously okayed "Hail,
Stanford, Hail."
Siren Yell
The history of Stanford's yells
passed through a very gawky adoles
cent stage. The so-called Siren Yell
was just one of the many that flour
ished and faded. The Siren went like
this:
"I-—S—J—Uwec
<)w Wow-Oi Yoi—
l,_S. J—u u Wee
Ow WOW OI YOI (rise/'
Finally in 1896 "Give 'em the axe"
was conceived to irritate Cal, and to
replace the former ineffective "sis
boom ball's." Will Irvin, '00, was the
brains behind the now immortal Axe
Yell. He was inspired by Aristo
phanes' classic Greek play "The
Frogs," in which a chorus repeat
edly chants, "Brek-ek-koax-koax."
