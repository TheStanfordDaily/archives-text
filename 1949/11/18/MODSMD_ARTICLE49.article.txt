# UCLA Bowl Hopes Still Flicker; Face SC in Coliseum Classic
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 f/P).—
I The amazing Bruins ol UCLA and
i the Troians of Southern California
J wind up the major college prid cam
j paign here tomorrow in a cross
i town duel that carries a faint but
J hopeful whiff of roses from Pasa
dena's famed bowl.
The hisqest odor of La Rose per
fume will prevail up north, where
California's unbeaten Beftrs invade
Palo Alto to meet a bowl-threaten
ing Stanford eleven.
The oidy hope down here rests on
a UCLA victory over Southern Cal
coupled with a Stanford win over
California.
That would throw the Pacific
Coast Conference Hose Bowl race
into a three-way tie and at least
i give UCLA a chance in the confer
ence balloitng;
Regardless of, the bowl aspects,
this one here tomorrow shapes up,
as usual, as one of those Hatfield
and McCoy affairs. Some 75,000 on
lookers, about evenly divided in
their affections, are due to witness
the struggle in Memorial Coliseum.
Ordinarily, USC would be firm
favorites. But Coach Jeff Cravath
has been plagued by many injuries,
the latest being the hardest blow of
all—loss of his No. 1 T-quarterhack,
Jim Powers.
Shoved into the spot is his No. 4
| quarterback, untested Dean Schnei
der, Nos. 2 and quarterbacks hav
ing already been lost via a broken
jaw and an appendectomy.
USC stlU has some fine ball car
riers, notably fullback Bill Mar
tin. But Troy's running attack has
been sadly secondary to passing all
season, and power was the leading
passer in the conference.

Coach Henry (Red) Sanders, on
the other hand, fields a team that
has won six out of eight starts, los
ing only to California in the con
ference, and has combined explo
sive scoring tactics wili good old
fashioned tackling and blocking.
Sanders never has commanded
much line depth, and the Bruin pass
defense seems to be full of holes.
But the popular Sanders has some
splendid weapons in halfbacks Er
nie Johnson. Joe Mat*vin, Howard
Hansen, fullback C 1 i Schroeder,
and the leading pass catcher in (he
school's history, ham-banded Bob
Wilkinson.
The game shapes Hp as Trojan de
fense vs. UCLA offense.
