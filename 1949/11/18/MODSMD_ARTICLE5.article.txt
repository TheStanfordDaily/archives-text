# "Now Boys" Meet California; Stage Set for Rose Bowl Bid
## 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
All the toil and effort of the 1949 football sea
son, of three years of play, will go into one final
60-minute period called simply "The Big Game."
The chips are down, the practices finished,
and the Stanford Indians are ready to gamble
for the ultimate in football, the bid for the Rose
Bowl, in the Fifty-Second renewal of the Stan
ford-California football game.
Sitting in on the struggle will be a jam-packed
crowd of over 92,000 in Stanford Stadium. Over
100,000 more persons are expected to witness
the contest by radio and television.
Twice in the last two years the Cards have
been hopeless underdogs in the betting circles.
Twice those Indians have played Cal off its feet
only to lose because an errant football did not
find its way between the goal posts.
This year the surprising Stanfords find them
selves seven-point underdogs against unbeaten
California, a team that ha 3 steamrollered its way
to nine straight wins and 19 victories in its last
20 games.
Challenging this fine string of wins is the Big
Red of Stanford. After traveling the tortuous
road of nine games and several early break

downs, the Machine has hit the straightaway and
is heading full steam against the one remaining
obstacle on the road to the Rose Bowl.
Whether the Cards will make the coveted post
season affair is of great concern to each and
every Stanford man and woman, but oversha
dowing all glamor of the bowl is the one and
only Big Game.
Past records have proven to mean little or
nothing when these two schools meet on the
gridiron.
The 1949 edition finds a Stanford team, picked
to wind up no better than third or fourth in the
PCC in pre-season guesses, rated twelfth in the
nation and pitted against third-place California.
Whether the Cards can win tcmorrow is now
in the hands of the players themselves. All week
long they have been briefed on Cal plays, pass
patterns, and everything that fine scouts such as
assistant coaches Dutch Fehring and Mai El
ward can pick up.
Now it is up to the Whites, Kerkorians, Raus,
Cones, and the little-known men who so often
are the key to Big Game wins.
