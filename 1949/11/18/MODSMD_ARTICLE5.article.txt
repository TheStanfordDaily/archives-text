# "Now Boys" Meet California; Stage Set for Rose Bowl Bid
## 
### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
All the toil and effort of the 1949 football sea
son, of three years of play, will go into one final
60-minute period called simply "The Big Game."
The chips are down, the practices finished,
and the Stanford Indians are ready to gamble
for the ultimate in football, the bid for the Rose
Bowl, in the Fifty-Second renewal of the Stan
ford-California football game.
Sitting in on the struggle will be a jam-packed
crowd of over 92,000 in Stanford Stadium. Over
100,000 more persons are expected to witness
the contest by radio and television.
Twice in the last two years the Cards have
been hopeless underdogs in the betting circles.
Twice those Indians have played Cal off its feet
only to lose because an errant football did not
find its way between the goal posts.
This year the surprising Stanfords find them
selves seven-point underdogs against unbeaten
California, a team that ha 3 steamrollered its way
to nine straight wins and 19 victories in its last
20 games.
Challenging this fine string of wins is the Big
Red of Stanford. After traveling the tortuous
road of nine games and several early break

downs, the Machine has hit the straightaway and
is heading full steam against the one remaining
obstacle on the road to the Rose Bowl.
Whether the Cards will make the coveted post
season affair is of great concern to each and
every Stanford man and woman, but oversha
dowing all glamor of the bowl is the one and
only Big Game.
Past records have proven to mean little or
nothing when these two schools meet on the
gridiron.
The 1949 edition finds a Stanford team, picked
to wind up no better than third or fourth in the
PCC in pre-season guesses, rated twelfth in the
nation and pitted against third-place California.
Whether the Cards can win tcmorrow is now
in the hands of the players themselves. All week
long they have been briefed on Cal plays, pass
patterns, and everything that fine scouts such as
assistant coaches Dutch Fehring and Mai El
ward can pick up.
Now it is up to the Whites, Kerkorians, Raus,
Cones, and the little-known men who so often
are the key to Big Game wins.
Coach Marchie Schwartz named a starting
lineup of Bill McColl and Ken Rose at ends, Gor-
don White and /\l ltau at tackles, Don
Fix and Dick Lucas at guards, Jim
Castagnoli at center, Bob White and
Harry Hugasian at half, Bill DeYoung
at full, and Gary Kcrkorian at quar
terback.
Those are the starters. They are
the men who will carry a good part
of the offensive load. Several will be
called upon for defensive duties, too.
But, for the first time in his Stan
ford coaching career, Schwartz can
come close to matching the powerful
Bears in team strength.
So when the Bears corrc up with
the ball, the defensive unit will enter

Coast against ground attacks. But
they rate eighth in pass defense.
Looming like a dark shadow over
all pie-game talk is the vaunted Cal
line. USC and UCLA coaches Jeff
the game. Here lies, many observ
ers think, the key to a Card win to
morrow.
Can this defensive team hold the
Cal offense? Will Bob Celeri be
rushed so that he cannot complete
the long aerials? Can they slop his
bootlegs?
Past records indicate the Indians
will stop the rushing attack. They
have the best defensive record on the

Cravath and Red Sanders have gone
on record favoring the Bears "be
cause they have a better line.'
Coach Lynn Waldorf's lines, both
of them, have been rated among the
top three of the country. Again come
the questions: "Can the Cards pierce
and stop that line?" If they can,
Stanford will win the Big Game.
With these thoughts in mind, the
game shapes up as a Stanford team
runnings the ends in every shape and
form. Speedsters Bill DeYoung and
Rupe Andrews will see service here.
Bob White and Harry Hugasian will
enter into the act with quick thrusts
over and off tackle. Back of these
attacks will loom the passing threat
of Gary Kerkorian to Ken R-jse and
Bill McColl.
The Card attack will not stop with

the basic plays, but they must be
the tools by which Kerkorian opens
up the Bear defense for the special
plays put in by Schwartz this week.
Then there is the old reliable,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch kicks with
the best in the nation. His blocking
has freed more than a few Card backs
for long gainers.
If the Indians need three yards for
a first down or TD, Mitch will get the
call. He might well have been the
difference between victory and defeat
if he had been able to play last year.
Bill McColl might get the call to
show his field goal kicking abilities.
Both he and Kerkorian are able to
score the three-pointer from up to 30
yards out. Might come in handy.
But, all in all, it looks as if the team
that gets the breaks will win the
game. A fumble, dropped pass, pen
alty, any one of these can win or
loi.e the game.

All the toil and effort of the 1949 football sea
son, of three years of play, will go into one final
60-minute period called simply "The Big Game."
The chips are down, the practices finished,
and the Stanford Indians are ready to gamble
for the ultimate in football, the bid for the Rose
Bowl, in the Fifty-Second renewal of the Stan
ford-California football game.
Sitting in on the struggle will be a jam-packed
crowd of over 92,000 in Stanford Stadium. Over
100,000 more persons are expected to witness
the contest by radio and television.
Twice in the last two years the Cards have
been hopeless underdogs in the betting circles.
Twice those Indians have played Cal off its feet
only to lose because an errant football did not
find its way between the goal posts.
This year the surprising Stanfords find them
selves seven-point underdogs against unbeaten
California, a team that ha 3 steamrollered its way
to nine straight wins and 19 victories in its last
20 games.
Challenging this fine string of wins is the Big
Red of Stanford. After traveling the tortuous
road of nine games and several early break

downs, the Machine has hit the straightaway and
is heading full steam against the one remaining
obstacle on the road to the Rose Bowl.
Whether the Cards will make the coveted post
season affair is of great concern to each and
every Stanford man and woman, but oversha
dowing all glamor of the bowl is the one and
only Big Game.
Past records have proven to mean little or
nothing when these two schools meet on the
gridiron.
The 1949 edition finds a Stanford team, picked
to wind up no better than third or fourth in the
PCC in pre-season guesses, rated twelfth in the
nation and pitted against third-place California.
Whether the Cards can win tcmorrow is now
in the hands of the players themselves. All week
long they have been briefed on Cal plays, pass
patterns, and everything that fine scouts such as
assistant coaches Dutch Fehring and Mai El
ward can pick up.
Now it is up to the Whites, Kerkorians, Raus,
Cones, and the little-known men who so often
are the key to Big Game wins.
Coach Marchie Schwartz named a starting
lineup of Bill McColl and Ken Rose at ends, Gor-
don White and /\l ltau at tackles, Don
Fix and Dick Lucas at guards, Jim
Castagnoli at center, Bob White and
Harry Hugasian at half, Bill DeYoung
at full, and Gary Kcrkorian at quar
terback.
Those are the starters. They are
the men who will carry a good part
of the offensive load. Several will be
called upon for defensive duties, too.
But, for the first time in his Stan
ford coaching career, Schwartz can
come close to matching the powerful
Bears in team strength.
So when the Bears corrc up with
the ball, the defensive unit will enter

Coast against ground attacks. But
they rate eighth in pass defense.
Looming like a dark shadow over
all pie-game talk is the vaunted Cal
line. USC and UCLA coaches Jeff
the game. Here lies, many observ
ers think, the key to a Card win to
morrow.
Can this defensive team hold the
Cal offense? Will Bob Celeri be
rushed so that he cannot complete
the long aerials? Can they slop his
bootlegs?
Past records indicate the Indians
will stop the rushing attack. They
have the best defensive record on the

Cravath and Red Sanders have gone
on record favoring the Bears "be
cause they have a better line.'
Coach Lynn Waldorf's lines, both
of them, have been rated among the
top three of the country. Again come
the questions: "Can the Cards pierce
and stop that line?" If they can,
Stanford will win the Big Game.
With these thoughts in mind, the
game shapes up as a Stanford team
runnings the ends in every shape and
form. Speedsters Bill DeYoung and
Rupe Andrews will see service here.
Bob White and Harry Hugasian will
enter into the act with quick thrusts
over and off tackle. Back of these
attacks will loom the passing threat
of Gary Kerkorian to Ken R-jse and
Bill McColl.
The Card attack will not stop with

the basic plays, but they must be
the tools by which Kerkorian opens
up the Bear defense for the special
plays put in by Schwartz this week.
Then there is the old reliable,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch kicks with
the best in the nation. His blocking
has freed more than a few Card backs
for long gainers.
If the Indians need three yards for
a first down or TD, Mitch will get the
call. He might well have been the
difference between victory and defeat
if he had been able to play last year.
Bill McColl might get the call to
show his field goal kicking abilities.
Both he and Kerkorian are able to
score the three-pointer from up to 30
yards out. Might come in handy.
But, all in all, it looks as if the team

Then there is the old reliable,
Emery Mitchell. Mitch kicks with
the best in the nation. His blocking
has freed more than a few Card backs
for long gainers.
If the Indians need three yards for
a first down or TD, Mitch will get the
call. He might well have been the
difference between victory and defeat
if he had been able to play last year.
Bill McColl might get the call to
show his field goal kicking abilities.
Both he and Kerkorian are able to
score the three-pointer from up to 30
yards out. Might come in handy.
But, all in all, it looks as if the team
that gets the breaks will win the
game. A fumble, dropped pass, pen
alty, any one of these can win or
loi.e the game.

All the toil and effort of the 1949 football sea
son, of three years of play, will go into one final
60-minute period called simply "The Big Game."
The chips are down, the practices finished,
and the Stanford Indians are ready to gamble
for the ultimate in football, the bid for the Rose
Bowl, in the Fifty-Second renewal of the Stan
ford-California football game.
Sitting in on the struggle will be a jam-packed
crowd of over 92,000 in Stanford Stadium. Over
100,000 more persons are expected to witness
the contest by radio and television.
Twice in the last two years the Cards have
been hopeless underdogs in the betting circles.
Twice those Indians have played Cal off its feet
only to lose because an errant football did not
find its way between the goal posts.
This year the surprising Stanfords find them
selves seven-point underdogs against unbeaten
California, a team that ha 3 steamrollered its way
to nine straight wins and 19 victories in its last
20 games.
Challenging this fine string of wins is the Big
Red of Stanford. After traveling the tortuous
road of nine games and several early break

downs, the Machine has hit the straightaway and
is heading full steam against the one remaining
obstacle on the road to the Rose Bowl.
Whether the Cards will make the coveted post
season affair is of great concern to each and
every Stanford man and woman, but oversha
dowing all glamor of the bowl is the one and
only Big Game.
Past records have proven to mean little or
nothing when these two schools meet on the
gridiron.
The 1949 edition finds a Stanford team, picked
to wind up no better than third or fourth in the
PCC in pre-season guesses, rated twelfth in the
nation and pitted against third-place California.
Whether the Cards can win tcmorrow is now
in the hands of the players themselves. All week
long they have been briefed on Cal plays, pass
patterns, and everything that fine scouts such as
assistant coaches Dutch Fehring and Mai El
ward can pick up.
Now it is up to the Whites, Kerkorians, Raus,
Cones, and the little-known men who so often
are the key to Big Game wins.
Coach Marchie Schwartz named a starting
lineup of Bill McColl and Ken Rose at ends, Gor-
don White and /\l ltau at tackles, Don
Fix and Dick Lucas at guards, Jim
Castagnoli at center, Bob White and
Harry Hugasian at half, Bill DeYoung
at full, and Gary Kcrkorian at quar
terback.
Those are the starters. They are
the men who will carry a good part
of the offensive load. Several will be
called upon for defensive duties, too.
But, for the first time in his Stan
ford coaching career, Schwartz can
come close to matching the powerful
Bears in team strength.
So when the Bears corrc up with
the ball, the defensive unit will enter

Coast against ground attacks. But
they rate eighth in pass defense.
Looming like a dark shadow over
all pie-game talk is the vaunted Cal
line. USC and UCLA coaches Jeff
the game. Here lies, many observ
ers think, the key to a Card win to
morrow.
Can this defensive team hold the
Cal offense? Will Bob Celeri be
rushed so that he cannot complete
the long aerials? Can they slop his
bootlegs?
Past records indicate the Indians
will stop the rushing attack. They
have the best defensive record on the

Cravath and Red Sanders have gone
on record favoring the Bears "be
cause they have a better line.'
Coach Lynn Waldorf's lines, both
of them, have been rated among the
top three of the country. Again come
the questions: "Can the Cards pierce
and stop that line?" If they can,
Stanford will win the Big Game.
With these thoughts in mind, the
game shapes up as a Stanford team
runnings the ends in every shape and
form. Speedsters Bill DeYoung and
Rupe Andrews will see service here.
Bob White and Harry Hugasian will
enter into the act with quick thrusts
over and off tackle. Back of these
attacks will loom the passing threat
of Gary Kerkorian to Ken R-jse and
Bill McColl.
The Card attack will not stop with

the basic plays, but they must be
the tools by which Kerkorian opens
up the Bear defense for the special
plays put in by Schwartz this week.
