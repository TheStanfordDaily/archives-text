# Pickers Tab Annual Cannes; Choose Cards by 3 Points
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
That low, eerie moan peculiar to
football prognostics tors reached its
peak of intensity this week when
The Daily's Peerless Pickers, al
ready battered and bruised by a
long season of startling upsets, un
dertook this week's job of picking
the winners of the many grudge
battles which grace tomorrow's na
tional grid schedule.
Foremost battle of the string of
traditionals, of course, is the one
which will take place on the Farm's
southern 40, the "biggest" Big Game
between California and Stanford.
And the Pickers would gladly
trade their .731 season's average,
which isn't too bad a record con
sidering the contrary qualities of the
1949 season, just to he right on this
one game.
Yes, the Pickers have nominated
Stanford to jerk the bowl of roses
from under the nose of the unde
feated Golden Bear. Not only did
they pick the Indians, but they did
it unanimously.
One emotional scribe even tabbed
Stanford to win by 42 points, but his
case was attributed to too much
reading of Eggs Manske's opinions.
Consensus: Stanford by 3.
Also of g»~eat interest to the local
fans will be the Coliseum contest
featuring USC's Power-less Trojans
and the horseshoe-bedecked Bruins
from UCLA. Here again, it is pos
sible that personal sentiment had a
big hand in influencing the decision,
but the Pickers call USC by 3.
In the northlands, two more an
j cient rivalries will be renewed when
| Oregon tackles the giant - killing
! Beavers of Oregon State and Wash
ington engages Washington State in
I a battle of losers.
Let's call it Oregon by 2 in spite
of the Beaver - Spartan memories,
i and the Huskies by 7 over their
| Pu'lman cousins.
That's all for the Coast, so now for
j a quick swing across the country to
see what's happening elsewhere:
Michigan-Ohio State: The big "O"
would like a Western trip, but this
is the tough way of getting it. The
Wolverines, who should cop their
i third consecutive Big Nino title, look
! 8 points better.
Minnesota - Wisconsin: Old Minn
also has that Pasadena gleam in its
j eyes. And it looks pretty bright
Irom here. Minnesota by 13.
II! inois-North western: Northwest
! prn hit its peak against Michigan
| but hasn't been consistent since.
The Illini by 4. .
Purdue-Indiana: Tab the Boiler

makers to steam through by 11.
Oklahoma - Santa C lara: The na
tional line calls Oklahoma by 19, but
that Bronco line looked good enough
to us to shave that figure to 10.
Notre Dame-Iowa: Good ole Irish
greatest little average boosters
you ever saw. Noire Dame by 35.
Harvard-Yale: The old, old clas
sic. Even so, it's hard to believe
that even the respeetnve schools'
freshmen could get excited over this
one. But that doesn't make it any
easier to pick a winner. Previous
records mean nothing, but that's all
we have to go on. So call il Yah'
by 8.
In other majors, the Pickers tab:
Dartmouth over Princeton by 9.
Virginia over Tulane by 2.
North Carolina over Duke by (!.
Kentucky over Tennessee by 7.
SMU over Baylor by 10.
Missouri over Kansas by 4.
Pitt over Penn State 10.
St. Mary's over Sen' Jose Stale
by 1.
Itice over TCU by 10.

That low, eerie moan peculiar to
football prognostics tors reached its
peak of intensity this week when
The Daily's Peerless Pickers, al
ready battered and bruised by a
long season of startling upsets, un
dertook this week's job of picking
the winners of the many grudge
battles which grace tomorrow's na
tional grid schedule.
Foremost battle of the string of
traditionals, of course, is the one
which will take place on the Farm's
southern 40, the "biggest" Big Game
between California and Stanford.
And the Pickers would gladly
trade their .731 season's average,
which isn't too bad a record con
sidering the contrary qualities of the
1949 season, just to he right on this
one game.
Yes, the Pickers have nominated
Stanford to jerk the bowl of roses
from under the nose of the unde
feated Golden Bear. Not only did
they pick the Indians, but they did
it unanimously.
One emotional scribe even tabbed
Stanford to win by 42 points, but his
case was attributed to too much
reading of Eggs Manske's opinions.
Consensus: Stanford by 3.
Also of g»~eat interest to the local
fans will be the Coliseum contest
featuring USC's Power-less Trojans
and the horseshoe-bedecked Bruins
from UCLA. Here again, it is pos
sible that personal sentiment had a
big hand in influencing the decision,
but the Pickers call USC by 3.
In the northlands, two more an
j cient rivalries will be renewed when
| Oregon tackles the giant - killing
! Beavers of Oregon State and Wash
ington engages Washington State in
I a battle of losers.
Let's call it Oregon by 2 in spite

That's all for the Coast, so now for
j a quick swing across the country to

Michigan-Ohio State: The big "O"
would like a Western trip, but this
is the tough way of getting it. The
