### 
Hut the Heel line is (bin unci a lev/ early game injuries would upset the
rose cart. As it is, Bill McColl unci Russ Pomeroy, and probably Jim Cas
tagnoli will have to see double duly. An injury to a defensive backfield man
would put the strain on Bobby White, Gary Kerkorian, and Bill DeYoung.
Several years ago this double-duty stuff was expected of each and every
man on the squad. Comes the platoon system and we all start worrying be
cause a man may have to play more than just on offense. But if the other
team can play two teams against you, your boys have a pretty hard time
keeping up with the onrush of fresh men.
One last word to all the alums that have wandered back to the Farm for
Homecoming and the Big Game. Some of you have been away for a few
years, some for many. Our school's appearance has changed somewhat,
what with the Hat roots and all. but tomorrow you can expect to see some
thing that has remained through the years.
And that, of course, is the Stanford Spirit. Come what may the the Big
Game, win or lose, you'll thrill to the Axe Yell given by members of the
Family.
Cal will probably give the yell tomorrow but it won't sound right coming
from that side of the field.
