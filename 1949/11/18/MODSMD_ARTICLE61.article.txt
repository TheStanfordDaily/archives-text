fensive matters.
The Indians have rolled up a grand
total of 3.395 yards by both rushing
and passing in their nine games to
date, which averages out at 377.2
yards per contest. Cal's average is
360.9 for each of its nine games.
As might be expected, the Cards
gained their statistical advantage on
the ground by outrushing the Bears
2,314 yards to 2,060. Cal closed part
of the gap by gaining 1,188 in the air
as compared with Stanford's 1,081.
It is interesting to note' however,
that Stanford's completion average is
higher even though total passing
yardage is less. The Indians made
good with 81 of their tosses for a
.445 percentage; the Bears completed
only 60 for a .420 average.
Cal managed to gain more yardage
on their smaller number of comple
tions by making each completed toss
good for an average of 19.8 yards,
while the Cards' average pitch has
tained but 13.4 yards.
Defensively, the Golden Bears have
held their opponents to an average of

2.12. G yards per game. They've trav
eled backward for a total of 2,094
yards, 1,261 by rushing and 833 by
passing.
Sianlord's defenders have allowed
2,2.")3 yards to be gained against them,
which gives their opponents an aver
age of 248.1 yards gained.
But in the breakdown of these de
fensive figures into rushing and pass
ing, it should be noted that Stanford
has allowed less yardage on the
ground while falling behind in pass
defense.
The Indians have allowed 1,037
yards by rushing and 1,140 by pass
ing.
