### JOE CUSICK 
Don E. Lietendorfer, the man be- j
hind the scenes in the Department of
Athletics, has been turned into one
of Stanford's "unwritten traditions"
[ since he art ived on the Farm 29 years
i ago.
The genial host of the Stadium
| press box took over the job of ath
letic publicist even before he gradu
ated in 1925. Sis-official title is News
Service Director for the Department
of Athletics, and under that heading
he combines over a half-dozen tasks,
I all nearly full-time jobs in them- j
: selves.
Don handles the edition of all the
tickets, programs, informational bul- j
lctins to high schools, and the Buck- ;
j of-the-Month Club bulletin; operates I
j the athletic film exchange, arranges
| speaking engagements for the
coaches, and travels a week in ad
j vance of most Stanford teams to
' make the necessary arrangements. |
â€¢ In this capacity, Don believes he has j
| traveled about two and a half times
| around the world.
Born in New Brighton, Pcnnsyl- ,
vania. Don moved to Modesto when !
he was eight. He lives now in Wood- j
side with his wife, a graduate of San j
Jose State College, and his two sons,
Don E., Jr., a Stanford freshman, and 1

Terry, nged three.
While at Stanford, Don was a mem
ber of the Breakers eating club and
one of the original freshman spon
sors at Encina. He was editor of The
Daily in 1924 and sports editor of the
Quad the same year. A member of
Sigma Delta Chi, journalism frater
nity, he al::o wrote for "Spectator"
and "Illustrated Review."
During the war Don was connected
with athletic publicity for the Navy
for a time. He entered as a full lieu
tenant and went inio reserve status as
a commander. In his 45 months' duty
he spent some time at San Diego, St.
Mary's Pre-Flight. and with the Staff
Headquarters of the 12th Naval Dis
trict in San Francisco.
Until the UCLA game this year,
Don had announced every major ath
letic contest from Stanford Stadium
since the public address system was
installed in li' 29. Because his services
were needed more in the press box,
he gave up his long standing duty to
a commercial announcer. But that
afternoon, undergrads and alums
alkie, looked up when they heard a
strange voice announcing the team
lineups, and asked: "Where's Don
Liebendorfer?" Everybody knows
'im.
