# Cal, Stanford Soccer Teams Renew Series
## 
### BILL MORLEY 
The soccer team has not had a suc
cessful season this fall but as in all
Stanford-Cal games, records must be
scrapped, burned, or completly dis
regarded in predicting the outcome.
To be more exact, Etem Barlas'
hooters, with a record of 1 tie and 4
losses, will take the field at 10 a.m.
tomorrow against a strong, unde
feated California team.
r ihe Cards will enter the game un
derdogs, but because Cal will he the
other team, with an even chance to
win.
Chan ing coaches in midseason is
'sometimes hard for a team to read
ust to, and the less of an outstanding
star, such as Homi Irani, a two-year
all-Con.erence man, for virtually the
whole season, might be considered
the final blow.
On the brighter side, liarry Ila
vilio, Amos Salvador, and Tat Bel
knap have been outstanding.
Belknap especially has helped the
team. He is almost certain to make
all-Conference. Tat and John Price
are what makes the team's defense
much its strongest weapon.
Up in front, of course, is where
frani's absence has hurt most. The
accurate passes from his center-hall
position were counted on to start

many of the team's attacking thrusts.
Since Horni's injury, Coach Barlas
has fcei n forced to move At::os Sal
vador from center forward to cen
ter half.
Robbing Peter to pay Paul has
come up with the usual result. The
forward line has never teen abl< to
Keep up a consistent attack. The
team has not scored over two goals
n a game all season.
Tom Bell, a lix-hmrm who has
taken over Salvador's forward posi
tion, came out in midseasen and has
been able to practice very liu.f be
cause of a heavy schedule. Still, he
looks good al times. He scored Stan
ford's (.nly goal in the UCLA disaster.
