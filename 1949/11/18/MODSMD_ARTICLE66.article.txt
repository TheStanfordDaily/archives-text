# '46 Axe Robbery Is Still Mystery
## 
### 
Six men wearing Stanford jackets
and flying jackets came into the Cel
lar just before closing at 10:25 on
April 28, 194G. They subdued the lone
student at work behind the counter,
tiled the chains which attached a
case to the wall. ' »aded the case on
the hack of a black '38 Chevrolet
pickup truck, and disappeared.
Immediately the Stanford campus
was in an uproar: the Axe had teen
stolen. It had been displayed in the
case in the Cellar since Stanford had
taken possession of it by winning the
1942 Big Game. There had been no
Big Game since—the 1945 team, Stan
ford's first since the war, had played
only two foes, Stockton Air Base tak
ing the place of Cal as the main con
test.
Though the identity of the raiders
was unknown, Cal students were
naturally suspected, and negotiations
lor the recovery of the missing trophy
were opened between Stanford and
Cal campus leaders. By a previous
agreement between the two schools,
the Axe was to be obtained only by
winning the Big Game, and expulsion
was to be the penalty for a student
from either school stealing it.
On October 8 the Axe reappeared.
A mysterious phone call to the Palo
Alto police revealed that the Axe
would be found in the back of a pa
trol car parked outside the station.
It was recovered, minus the case,
and returned to Stanford in time to
be displayed at the rally before the
first post-war Big Game in Novem
ber.
