# Pappy's '19 Golden Bears Boast New "Will to Win'
## Blue and Gold Horde Seeks Seventeenth Straight Pacific Coast Conference Victory 
### AL BERRY 
California's often victorious varsity is a very good football team.
This they have proven time and again this year. But their great
ness, and they have often been called great, is entirely dependent
upon tomorrow's Big Game. California is vitally interested in
proving their greatness, in keeping the axe, in going to the Rose

Bowl, and, in general, acquiring all |
of the wonderful treats that go with

victory tomorrow.
With this thought in the twenty
two collective minds that compose
the Golden Bear first string platoons,
California's football machine will
have a new wear on tomorrow. A
weapon that has been vitally and
notably lacking in all of the post
war Big Game engagements —a real
desire to win. Cal will try to show
all concerned that "Stanford spirit"

is not confined to just this one small
segment of the San Francisco Penin
sula. And this new California
"spirit" will show on the Stanford
scoreboard.

The reason for Cal's being "up"
for this may very well be entwined
in the fact that no less than ten of
the first fourteen Bear linemen will
be playing their last Big Game. They
want to leave on a note of triumph—
with the sound of heavenly trum
phets and the happy crunch of splin
tering scats.
this year the Bears know that j
Stanford can match them sometimes I
in spades—in almost every depart
ment. They haven't had to be up. I
I hey figured, for the previous con- :
tests, but they expect a super-bang- 1
dish-special tomorrow, and they in- j
tend.to be prepared.
Individually the Californians are j
not as rough, tough, capable and gen- I
orally nasty as they have been the
previous seasons, but their fine team i
work and team inspiration make j
tlicm just as dangerous as ever. Their j
famous line charge, legal or not i
(and the officials—generally—have j
thought it legal), is a masterpiece of
team timing. It is, at any rate, caus
ing Cal to win ball games.
A rundown of the first offensive ;
string brings some old, memory-rid
den names back into Indian promi
nence. and these arc spiced with
some newcomers who may someday
he likewise remembered, revered, !
and hated.
Offensive Ends: The left wingman,
Dan Begovich, is an example of re- i
placement come through that has i
characterized the invaders all seu- !

soi). Begovich is now listed as one j
of Chl's two favorite pass receivers, j
He is the host, offensive end on the
squad. And while Cal is not a "pass
ing team," the 193-pound, 6' 1" sen
ior, is a constant threat in the long
pass department. The prc-season ex
perts rated Bcgovich as "a capable
rep'acement."
The right end spot is held down by
the lightest man on (he Berkeley
squad—l7s pound Roy Ward, a jun
ior from Newport Beach. Ward is
not yet. the offensive end that Bego- I
vich is, but Ihe 5' 10" junior is very '
fast, and with Boots Erb passing, he
is capable of picking off some long ;
ones.
Offensive Tackles: Jim "Truck"
Cullom, whose twinkling toes has
brought about four disasterous Big
Game points these last two lean j
years, needs no introduction to the j
Indian reader. Cullom comes into the i

fray with a cozy 308 playing min
utes under his immense belt. The
225-pound Piedmont lad won't be
around to cause us disaster anymore,
but his last one—he hopes—will be
his big one. Cullom is a capable of
fensive tackle, as the amount of
game time listed indicates.
The right tackle position is car
ried on the shoulders of one of the
more publicized of the California
linemen—the tidy 235-pound pack
age known as Jim Turner. Turner,
who was injured most of last sea
son, was one of the big "ifs" in
California hopes. Me got well enough
to smell the Pasadena Roses last year,
and he gave a creditable job against
the Northwestern line. He blocks
well, and pulls out fast. An all
around good lineman.
Offensive Guards: Two familiar
names here, the 502 total playing
minutes for ail-American Rod Franz
and Ray DeJong. Of the two, Franz
is by far the better guard, and easily
the best guard on the coast. Franz's
offensive blocking is four notches
better than excellent, and he is ex
tremely fast in pulling out and nail
ing his opponent. Franz is big (205
pounds), fast (for a lineman) and is
playing his last crack at his Stan
ford opponents.
is the very excellent re
placement for Big Jon Baker who
(ina'ly graduated last year. He does
everything that Franz docs, and with
only a slightly less efficiency. He
stands 5' 10", and matches the other
guard on the scales at 205 pounds.
Offensive Center: Is probably the
weakest spot in the Cal offense.
George Stathakis, a 195 pound sopho
more, has occasionally looked bril
liant; but inexperience can kill a
center, and it hasn't aided Stathakis
any. He does, however, do his job,
and while his punt formation passes
have not been awfully consistent,
his T-formation work is good, and
his blocking comparable to the rest
of the California line.
Offensive Ouartcrhaek: Here is the
little piece of machinery that makes
the Golden Machine run like a Swiss
watch. His name is Bob Ccleri, and
even his best friends—who watched
him work last year—can't believe
that it is the same old Celery-head

who is doing what he is doing. Cc- .
lcri is unquestionably the most val
uable player on the Cal team, and
without his happy antics the Golden
Bears might very well have spent
this season vieing with WSC and
Idaho for the conference damp spot.
He runs, he kicks, he passes, and
he makes Cal win football games.
Celeri's value to his team, as well
as his running ability cannot be over
estimated.
As one Los Angeles writer put it,
"Celeri's pants were the color of the
ball, and the ball was the color of
Celeri's pants. And the UCLA var
sity didn't know which was going
which way."
Behind Rapid Robert is long pass
ing Boots Erb, who has been around
the Cal campus for a very long time,
and is still not mistaken very often
for an ail-American. He is a good j
long passer, but without the number |
one boy in the game, Charley Erb's
best efforts can't, make California a
football team.
Offensive Left llaifback: And here
we find the number two man on the
Bear team, the 185-pound Frank
Brunk, who gained something akin
| to Blue and Gold immortality with
j his very famous IG2 yard romp
J against the Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia. Brunk, also a senior, is—
| after Ccleii-the best runner on the)
Cal team. While not fast, he is a i
! very hard runner, and is the Berk- !
; leyites' favorite ball carrier. But be- j
| hind Brunk, there is a decided lack !
of depth in the left half spot of this j
; segmont of the California Public j
j School System.
Offensive Right Halfback: When
the Jack named Swaner received his i
knee injury, a fullback named Jim
Monachino was moved into the right
half spot to help out until Jack got
walking right again. Now that
Swaner is back on the ball club, it |
is exceedingly doubtful that he will j
be able to push the hard-blocking
j junior out of his position, Mona- !
j chino has played good ball this [
: year, and has gradually approached j
i Brunk himself as a ball handler. |
And although Brunk is still doing
most of the pass receiving, Mona
chino is doing more than his share
of the line smashing.

Offensive Fullback: Heic another
j junior, little (185) Pel Sehabarum
from Covina is making niekles. Some
may remember Pete as the guy who j
nearly lip,set the Papooses'.s peifcct
1047 season, by racing up and clown
the Berkeley turf. He was plagued i
by injuries last year, but i:. now—
Waldorf thinks—ready to do some
more racing against the Stanford
Indian. Sehabarum is an excellent |
passer, and is generally described j
as "swivel-hipped" in his line buck- \
ing.
'Ilie defensive line consists of I've ,
seniors, a junior, a sophomore, and !
about. 1,500 pounds of equally dis
! tributed weight. The defensive
j backs, of whom the most outstand- ;
1 ing is Billy Montague, are fast and
j proficient at their work. The de
| fense, as a whole, as been excel- I
J lent, allowing their nine opponents
to glean but about 233 yards per
game against them. By way of com
parison, Cal's offense had managed
to gain nearly a 375 yard average j
per game.
