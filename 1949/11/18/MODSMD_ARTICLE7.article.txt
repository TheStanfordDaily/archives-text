## Ten-Pound Axe Adds a Ton of Spirit To Half-Century of Bear-Card Rivalry 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Two years ago on the eve of the
Big Game, a red-haired but almost
bald alumnus jumped from his ban
quet table in one of San Francisco's
plush hotels to shout the words
"Give 'em the axe!"
The celebrating old-timers shout
ed their approval as "Red," the for
gotten yell-leader, whipped off his
coat, tore loose a dress tie, and
waved his arms in the movements
of the Stanford Axe Yell. The room
echoed with the sound of earnest but
aged voices trumpeting the words of
the familiar yell.
The axe for which these alumni
and many others were cheering,
rested that year in the Stanford Uni
versity Cellar. Today the colorful
weapon is cached in the University
of California's Stephens Union. To
morow night this same axe may rest
in either location.
The object of the two schools' at
tention for the past 50 years is a
stubby, red-handled axe with a
chrome-plated cutting edge about 8
inches long. The 10-pound weapon is
mounted on a polished mahogany
board.
Origin Uncertain
The origin of the axe is uncertain,
but the occasion for its debut was
the second baseball game of the
Stanford-California series in 1899. It
v/as on the eve of April 15, when the
game was to be held, that Billy Erb,
Stanford's cheer leader, hit on the
idea of symbolizing the Axe Yell
which Will Irwin had written three
years before, with a real axe.
It is believed that Erb and his co
horts copped the rustic weapon from
a junk heap in the old forge shop—
probably dropped originally by some
old lumberman. The cheer leader
splashed some red paint over the long
handle and sprinted to the rally
where the first Big Game bonfire was
already shooting sparks into the air.
It occurred to the roughs that only
a sharpened axe would be a sign of
victory on the morrow, so with grind
tone in hand, the group polished up
the cutting surface. Then with one
hefty blow of the weapon, Erb sliced
oT the head of the blue and gold
bear effigy amidst frenzied cheering
from the throng of students dancing
around the flaming pyre.

The following day the axe failed in
its role as a Stanford victory symbol,
for the Bear horsehiders handed the
Farm team a 9 to 7 defeat. Erb, who
amused the Stanfords all afternoon
by cutting blue and gold ribbon with
the axe on a chopping block, was also
cutting the tempers of the blue and
gold rooters.
After the gnme, the plotting Bears
headed for Carl Hayden, who was left
in charge of the axe. Tom McFadden,
a Stanford tackle, sensing the con
spiracy, joined his fellow student in
the ensuing brawl, but the Berkeley
ites overpowered the duo and
sprinted off with "Stanford's Axe."
It took Jim Hopper, Cal's "wonder
quarterback," and several UC track
men to relay the axe outside the
confines of the baseball field. At one
time Ernest Strout, a Stanford hur
dler, joined in the relay, but when
he failed to "pass the baton" and
headed off the track, Hopper nailed
him with a flying tackle and re
covered the pilfered weapon.
San Francisco Chase
The chase went down the streets
of San Francisco as the axe-napers
switched from a horse-drawn de
livery wagon to a dilapidated street
car. As they Hed through Chinatown,
Hopper and his cronies stopped in a
butcher shop and got part of the
bunglesome axe handle cut off.
When I hey reached the Ferry
Building the place was swarming
with Stanford roughs who were frisk
ing all the ferry passengers. One of
the party who had an overcoat
whisked the axe under it and spot
ting a friendly Cal coed, took her and
the axe under his arm. With ro
mance in his eyes he boarded the
ferry unsuspected by the Stanford
shore patrol.
For 31 years the axe rested in the
vaults of a Berkeley bank and was
brought out only for the annual axe
rally. Every attempt to recover it—
even the fantastic retaliatory kid
naping of the Cal senior fence—failed
until on the morning of April 3, 1930,
the Stanford campus awoke to the
cry of, "We've got the axe!" Three
inch headlines in a 3 a.m. extra of
the Stanford Daily spread the words
"Axe Regained" to the breakfast
chow lines.
"Immortal 21"
The "Immortal 21" became cam
pus heroes overnight as word of their
shoplifting job reached the students.
Under the guise of photographers
seeking special shots at the axe as it
was taken from an armored car, the
Farm invaders had exploded some
flash bulb tear gas bombs and grab
bing the axe, had hustled down the
Peninsula in rented limousines.
The venture had reached an em
bryonic stage several times during
the previous four years, but there
was always a hitch in the plans which
nullified any chance of an axe
scapade in Berkeley.
When it appeared that the axe

j rivalry might reach revolutionary
proportions, the two schools agreed to
a compromise by which the winner
of the Big Game would be awarded
j the axe for the ensuing year.
This tradition continued until the
; war years when Stanford dropped
football and with it the axe rivalry.
| California, who had lost the last Big
Game in '42, was anxious to estab
lish some other legal method of
bringing the immortal axe back to the
Bear lair.
> Indians Balk
A contest for selling war bonds
seemed logical, but the Indians would
have none of that. The Big Game and
the axe rivalry had become one of
the many traditions which Stanford
j cherished.
Three times the Dirty Golden Bear
disregarded the Indian's peace pipe
; and stole ihe axe from its case in the
Stanford Cellar. Three times, Cal au
thorities sent the kleptomaniacs back
to return the treasured axe.
In the summer of 1948, the broken
glass of the case which had held the
! axe in Cal's Stephens Union her
-1 aided the sixth and most recent theft
of the axe. This time a Stanford stu
dent spotted the gleaming blade lean
ing against a tree near the Stanford
Golf Course —apparently where the
culprit decided to empty the "hot"
1 goods.
The record of axe thefts stands,
then, at 4 to 2 in favor of UC. But
the record for the Big Game scores
shows Stanford topping Cal 23 times,
! coming out on the short end 20 times,
and playing to a stalemate in 8 games.
When the California and Stanford
' teams play tomorrow—they will be
i playing not only for the axe, but also
j for the continuation of a rivalry
which signifies the highest in sports
manship, respect, and tradition —all
of which the Stanford Axe sym
bolizes.

A contest for selling war bonds
seemed logical, but the Indians would
have none of that. The Big Game and
the axe rivalry had become one of
the many traditions which Stanford
j cherished.
Three times the Dirty Golden Bear
disregarded the Indian's peace pipe
; and stole ihe axe from its case in the
Stanford Cellar. Three times, Cal au
thorities sent the kleptomaniacs back
to return the treasured axe.
In the summer of 1948, the broken
glass of the case which had held the
! axe in Cal's Stephens Union her
-1 aided the sixth and most recent theft
of the axe. This time a Stanford stu
dent spotted the gleaming blade lean
ing against a tree near the Stanford
Golf Course —apparently where the
culprit decided to empty the "hot"
1 goods.
The record of axe thefts stands,
then, at 4 to 2 in favor of UC. But
the record for the Big Game scores
shows Stanford topping Cal 23 times,

and playing to a stalemate in 8 games.
When the California and Stanford

Two years ago on the eve of the
Big Game, a red-haired but almost
bald alumnus jumped from his ban
quet table in one of San Francisco's
plush hotels to shout the words
"Give 'em the axe!"
The celebrating old-timers shout
ed their approval as "Red," the for
gotten yell-leader, whipped off his
coat, tore loose a dress tie, and
waved his arms in the movements
of the Stanford Axe Yell. The room
echoed with the sound of earnest but
aged voices trumpeting the words of
the familiar yell.
The axe for which these alumni
and many others were cheering,
rested that year in the Stanford Uni
versity Cellar. Today the colorful
weapon is cached in the University
of California's Stephens Union. To
morow night this same axe may rest
in either location.
The object of the two schools' at
tention for the past 50 years is a
stubby, red-handled axe with a
chrome-plated cutting edge about 8
inches long. The 10-pound weapon is
mounted on a polished mahogany
board.
Origin Uncertain
The origin of the axe is uncertain,
but the occasion for its debut was
the second baseball game of the
Stanford-California series in 1899. It
v/as on the eve of April 15, when the
game was to be held, that Billy Erb,
Stanford's cheer leader, hit on the
idea of symbolizing the Axe Yell
which Will Irwin had written three
years before, with a real axe.
It is believed that Erb and his co
horts copped the rustic weapon from
a junk heap in the old forge shop—
probably dropped originally by some
old lumberman. The cheer leader
splashed some red paint over the long
handle and sprinted to the rally
where the first Big Game bonfire was
already shooting sparks into the air.
It occurred to the roughs that only
a sharpened axe would be a sign of
victory on the morrow, so with grind
tone in hand, the group polished up
the cutting surface. Then with one
hefty blow of the weapon, Erb sliced
oT the head of the blue and gold
bear effigy amidst frenzied cheering
from the throng of students dancing
around the flaming pyre.

The following day the axe failed in
its role as a Stanford victory symbol,
for the Bear horsehiders handed the
Farm team a 9 to 7 defeat. Erb, who
amused the Stanfords all afternoon
by cutting blue and gold ribbon with
the axe on a chopping block, was also
cutting the tempers of the blue and
gold rooters.
After the gnme, the plotting Bears
headed for Carl Hayden, who was left
in charge of the axe. Tom McFadden,
a Stanford tackle, sensing the con
spiracy, joined his fellow student in
the ensuing brawl, but the Berkeley
ites overpowered the duo and
sprinted off with "Stanford's Axe."
It took Jim Hopper, Cal's "wonder
quarterback," and several UC track
men to relay the axe outside the
confines of the baseball field. At one
time Ernest Strout, a Stanford hur
dler, joined in the relay, but when
he failed to "pass the baton" and
headed off the track, Hopper nailed
him with a flying tackle and re
covered the pilfered weapon.
San Francisco Chase
The chase went down the streets
of San Francisco as the axe-napers
switched from a horse-drawn de
livery wagon to a dilapidated street
car. As they Hed through Chinatown,
Hopper and his cronies stopped in a
butcher shop and got part of the
bunglesome axe handle cut off.
When I hey reached the Ferry
Building the place was swarming
with Stanford roughs who were frisk
ing all the ferry passengers. One of
the party who had an overcoat
whisked the axe under it and spot
ting a friendly Cal coed, took her and
the axe under his arm. With ro
mance in his eyes he boarded the
ferry unsuspected by the Stanford
shore patrol.

mounted on a polished mahogany
board.
Origin Uncertain
The origin of the axe is uncertain,
but the occasion for its debut was
the second baseball game of the
Stanford-California series in 1899. It
v/as on the eve of April 15, when the
game was to be held, that Billy Erb,
Stanford's cheer leader, hit on the
idea of symbolizing the Axe Yell
which Will Irwin had written three
years before, with a real axe.
It is believed that Erb and his co
horts copped the rustic weapon from
a junk heap in the old forge shop—
probably dropped originally by some
old lumberman. The cheer leader
splashed some red paint over the long
handle and sprinted to the rally
where the first Big Game bonfire was
already shooting sparks into the air.
It occurred to the roughs that only
a sharpened axe would be a sign of
victory on the morrow, so with grind
tone in hand, the group polished up
the cutting surface. Then with one
hefty blow of the weapon, Erb sliced
oT the head of the blue and gold
bear effigy amidst frenzied cheering
from the throng of students dancing
around the flaming pyre.

The following day the axe failed in
its role as a Stanford victory symbol,
for the Bear horsehiders handed the
Farm team a 9 to 7 defeat. Erb, who
amused the Stanfords all afternoon
by cutting blue and gold ribbon with
the axe on a chopping block, was also
cutting the tempers of the blue and
gold rooters.
After the gnme, the plotting Bears
headed for Carl Hayden, who was left
in charge of the axe. Tom McFadden,
a Stanford tackle, sensing the con
spiracy, joined his fellow student in
the ensuing brawl, but the Berkeley
ites overpowered the duo and
sprinted off with "Stanford's Axe."
It took Jim Hopper, Cal's "wonder
quarterback," and several UC track
men to relay the axe outside the
confines of the baseball field. At one
time Ernest Strout, a Stanford hur
dler, joined in the relay, but when
he failed to "pass the baton" and
headed off the track, Hopper nailed
him with a flying tackle and re
covered the pilfered weapon.
San Francisco Chase
The chase went down the streets
of San Francisco as the axe-napers
switched from a horse-drawn de
livery wagon to a dilapidated street
car. As they Hed through Chinatown,
Hopper and his cronies stopped in a
butcher shop and got part of the
bunglesome axe handle cut off.
When I hey reached the Ferry
Building the place was swarming
with Stanford roughs who were frisk
ing all the ferry passengers. One of
the party who had an overcoat
whisked the axe under it and spot
ting a friendly Cal coed, took her and
the axe under his arm. With ro
mance in his eyes he boarded the
ferry unsuspected by the Stanford
shore patrol.
For 31 years the axe rested in the
vaults of a Berkeley bank and was
brought out only for the annual axe
rally. Every attempt to recover it—
even the fantastic retaliatory kid
naping of the Cal senior fence—failed
until on the morning of April 3, 1930,
the Stanford campus awoke to the
cry of, "We've got the axe!" Three
inch headlines in a 3 a.m. extra of
the Stanford Daily spread the words
"Axe Regained" to the breakfast
chow lines.
"Immortal 21"
The "Immortal 21" became cam
pus heroes overnight as word of their
shoplifting job reached the students.
Under the guise of photographers
seeking special shots at the axe as it
was taken from an armored car, the
Farm invaders had exploded some
flash bulb tear gas bombs and grab
bing the axe, had hustled down the
Peninsula in rented limousines.
The venture had reached an em
bryonic stage several times during
the previous four years, but there
was always a hitch in the plans which
nullified any chance of an axe
scapade in Berkeley.
When it appeared that the axe

j rivalry might reach revolutionary
proportions, the two schools agreed to
a compromise by which the winner
of the Big Game would be awarded
j the axe for the ensuing year.
This tradition continued until the
; war years when Stanford dropped
football and with it the axe rivalry.
| California, who had lost the last Big
Game in '42, was anxious to estab
lish some other legal method of
bringing the immortal axe back to the
Bear lair.
> Indians Balk
A contest for selling war bonds
seemed logical, but the Indians would
have none of that. The Big Game and
the axe rivalry had become one of
the many traditions which Stanford
j cherished.
Three times the Dirty Golden Bear
disregarded the Indian's peace pipe
; and stole ihe axe from its case in the
Stanford Cellar. Three times, Cal au
thorities sent the kleptomaniacs back
to return the treasured axe.
In the summer of 1948, the broken
glass of the case which had held the
! axe in Cal's Stephens Union her
-1 aided the sixth and most recent theft
of the axe. This time a Stanford stu
dent spotted the gleaming blade lean
ing against a tree near the Stanford
Golf Course —apparently where the
culprit decided to empty the "hot"
1 goods.
The record of axe thefts stands,
then, at 4 to 2 in favor of UC. But
the record for the Big Game scores
shows Stanford topping Cal 23 times,
! coming out on the short end 20 times,
and playing to a stalemate in 8 games.
When the California and Stanford
' teams play tomorrow—they will be
i playing not only for the axe, but also
j for the continuation of a rivalry
which signifies the highest in sports
manship, respect, and tradition —all
of which the Stanford Axe sym

Two years ago on the eve of the
Big Game, a red-haired but almost

"Give 'em the axe!"
The celebrating old-timers shout

A contest for selling war bonds
seemed logical, but the Indians would
have none of that. The Big Game and
the axe rivalry had become one of
the many traditions which Stanford
j cherished.
Three times the Dirty Golden Bear
disregarded the Indian's peace pipe
; and stole ihe axe from its case in the
Stanford Cellar. Three times, Cal au
thorities sent the kleptomaniacs back
to return the treasured axe.
In the summer of 1948, the broken
glass of the case which had held the
! axe in Cal's Stephens Union her
-1 aided the sixth and most recent theft
of the axe. This time a Stanford stu
dent spotted the gleaming blade lean
ing against a tree near the Stanford
Golf Course —apparently where the
culprit decided to empty the "hot"
1 goods.
The record of axe thefts stands,
then, at 4 to 2 in favor of UC. But
the record for the Big Game scores
shows Stanford topping Cal 23 times,
! coming out on the short end 20 times,
and playing to a stalemate in 8 games.
When the California and Stanford
' teams play tomorrow—they will be
i playing not only for the axe, but also
j for the continuation of a rivalry
which signifies the highest in sports
manship, respect, and tradition —all
of which the Stanford Axe sym
bolizes.

Two years ago on the eve of the
Big Game, a red-haired but almost
bald alumnus jumped from his ban
quet table in one of San Francisco's
plush hotels to shout the words
"Give 'em the axe!"
The celebrating old-timers shout
ed their approval as "Red," the for
gotten yell-leader, whipped off his
coat, tore loose a dress tie, and
waved his arms in the movements
of the Stanford Axe Yell. The room
echoed with the sound of earnest but
aged voices trumpeting the words of
the familiar yell.
The axe for which these alumni
and many others were cheering,
rested that year in the Stanford Uni
versity Cellar. Today the colorful
weapon is cached in the University
of California's Stephens Union. To
morow night this same axe may rest
in either location.
The object of the two schools' at
tention for the past 50 years is a
stubby, red-handled axe with a
chrome-plated cutting edge about 8
inches long. The 10-pound weapon is
mounted on a polished mahogany
board.
Origin Uncertain
The origin of the axe is uncertain,
but the occasion for its debut was
the second baseball game of the
Stanford-California series in 1899. It
v/as on the eve of April 15, when the
game was to be held, that Billy Erb,
Stanford's cheer leader, hit on the
idea of symbolizing the Axe Yell
which Will Irwin had written three
years before, with a real axe.
It is believed that Erb and his co
horts copped the rustic weapon from
a junk heap in the old forge shop—
probably dropped originally by some
old lumberman. The cheer leader
splashed some red paint over the long
handle and sprinted to the rally
where the first Big Game bonfire was
already shooting sparks into the air.
It occurred to the roughs that only
a sharpened axe would be a sign of
victory on the morrow, so with grind
tone in hand, the group polished up
the cutting surface. Then with one
hefty blow of the weapon, Erb sliced
oT the head of the blue and gold
bear effigy amidst frenzied cheering
from the throng of students dancing
around the flaming pyre.

The following day the axe failed in
its role as a Stanford victory symbol,
for the Bear horsehiders handed the
Farm team a 9 to 7 defeat. Erb, who
amused the Stanfords all afternoon
by cutting blue and gold ribbon with
the axe on a chopping block, was also
cutting the tempers of the blue and
gold rooters.
After the gnme, the plotting Bears
headed for Carl Hayden, who was left
in charge of the axe. Tom McFadden,
a Stanford tackle, sensing the con
spiracy, joined his fellow student in
the ensuing brawl, but the Berkeley
ites overpowered the duo and
sprinted off with "Stanford's Axe."
It took Jim Hopper, Cal's "wonder
quarterback," and several UC track
men to relay the axe outside the
confines of the baseball field. At one
time Ernest Strout, a Stanford hur
dler, joined in the relay, but when
he failed to "pass the baton" and
headed off the track, Hopper nailed
him with a flying tackle and re
covered the pilfered weapon.
San Francisco Chase
The chase went down the streets
of San Francisco as the axe-napers
switched from a horse-drawn de
livery wagon to a dilapidated street
car. As they Hed through Chinatown,
Hopper and his cronies stopped in a
butcher shop and got part of the
bunglesome axe handle cut off.
When I hey reached the Ferry
Building the place was swarming
with Stanford roughs who were frisk
ing all the ferry passengers. One of
the party who had an overcoat
whisked the axe under it and spot
ting a friendly Cal coed, took her and
the axe under his arm. With ro
mance in his eyes he boarded the
ferry unsuspected by the Stanford
shore patrol.
For 31 years the axe rested in the
vaults of a Berkeley bank and was
brought out only for the annual axe
rally. Every attempt to recover it—
even the fantastic retaliatory kid
naping of the Cal senior fence—failed
until on the morning of April 3, 1930,
the Stanford campus awoke to the
cry of, "We've got the axe!" Three
inch headlines in a 3 a.m. extra of
the Stanford Daily spread the words
"Axe Regained" to the breakfast
chow lines.
"Immortal 21"
The "Immortal 21" became cam
pus heroes overnight as word of their
shoplifting job reached the students.
Under the guise of photographers
seeking special shots at the axe as it
was taken from an armored car, the
Farm invaders had exploded some
flash bulb tear gas bombs and grab
bing the axe, had hustled down the
Peninsula in rented limousines.
The venture had reached an em
bryonic stage several times during
the previous four years, but there
was always a hitch in the plans which
nullified any chance of an axe
scapade in Berkeley.
