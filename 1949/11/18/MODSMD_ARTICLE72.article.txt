As the fifty-second Big Game un
fold:; on the Stadium greensward

the gridiron.
Photographers, sportswriters and
sportsmen, conference officials, uni

and telegraph operators sit elbow to
elbow, performing their separate
and varied tasks that go to make up
a national grid classic.
Arriving from every football

Don Liebendorfer, the Farm's
genial Athletic Newa Director,

host and co-ordinator. His job is to
see to it that each reporter and edi
tor receives his corresponding seat,
that programs and running statis
tics are passed out, and that sand
i wiehe;; and drinks are served to each
! of Stanford's guests.
Coaches, Too
Among the numerous events tak
ing place in the weather-protected
! and business-like station, the most

! bench telephone conferences that
j are continually going on. Usually
I Line Coach Phil Bengtson uses the
j built - in, high - powered binoculars
j and Assistant Coach Hay Hammett
j interprets the action and issues the
instructions over the telephone.
Whenever his Forty-Niners are
i appearing in San Francisco, Frankie
! Albert sits in on the master-mind
ing. He helps Hammett and Bengt
j son uncover weaknesses in the op
ponents' defensives and find new
. play patterns to spring on the next
Stanford offensive series.
Telegraph and Teletype
To keep up with the pounding
typewriters and early deadlines of
the big newspapermen, Western Un-
I ion maintains many operators who
telegraph the copy every few min
! utes. Teletype machines clatter
; constantly, pouring in news of other
| games.
Hival teams and future opponents
have top scouts working over every
Stanford move, doping out new
means for a win. Still others sit in
| the official sanctuary with no other
| pressing job than to enjoy the great
, rivalry of two battling football
I elevens.
