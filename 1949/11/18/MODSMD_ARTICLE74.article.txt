Who will be the soph stars on next
year's grid machine? What mem
bers of this year's undefeated frosh
will make the big jump to varsity
players in a single season?
Sophs A-Plenty
Tomorrow, when the Big Reds
take to the Stadium turf to meet
California in he '"Battle for the
Roses," many standouts will be
sophomores. The good record for
the present season would have been
impossible without the '52ers' val
uable performances. •
Now what about this year's fresh
men? Under the superb handling of
Coach Chuck Taylor, the Papooses
rolled up another unbroken chain of
victories. Of the wealth of talent on
the current yearling outfit, Coach
Taylor feels that the guards and
tackles showed the greatest promise
for future varsity assignments.
John and Norm
Topped by John Broderick and
Norman Manoogian, the line was
outstanding offensively and defen
sively. Both boys appeared in every
starting lineup and never failed to |
turn in a good performance.
Broderick is a 220-pound tackle
from Bever'y Hills, fn high school,
his size helped him crack the first
string, but it has been here on the
Farm that big John has suddenly
developed into a top-notch prospect.
He has recovered several fumbles
and blocked opponents' kicks for the

Papooses.
Norm, who is destined to join the
r.nks of his fellow Shish-kabobers
fiugasian and Kerkorian in the
hearts of Stanford rooters, has ca
pably lived up to liis advance repu
tation. A former all-city of Los An
geles prep from Dorsey High School,
the Manoog was the lightest man on
the fordward wall. But his aggressive
play and ability to dope out plays in
advance help him pile up opposing
ball-carriers la! day long.
Lots More
Backing up these two were a
whole brace of almost as outstand
ing guards and tackles. Jim Virk,
Tom Romano, Al Planner, Ken
Downey, Carter Pyle, and Hayden
Leason would all make any college
coach happy.
Future Fullback
fn the backßeld, Frank "Skip"
Crist was the brightest prospect. A
bruising fullback who drives hard
and fast, Skip may be the answer for
real power in the line-busting spot
in the Indian T-formation. The
Skipper, a product of Palo Alto
High, suffered an injured knee and
had to sit out two freshman contests,
but he came back belter than ever
to captain the Papoo:»cs in the "Little
Big Game."
Al Peterson, Dick Cargiulo, and
Bill Heilbron were '53's top runners
in the halfback positions. Peterson,
who suffered an early-season injury,
never was in top physical shape.

Broderick is a 220-pound tackle
from Bever'y Hills, fn high school,
his size helped him crack the first
string, but it has been here on the
Farm that big John has suddenly
developed into a top-notch prospect.
He has recovered several fumbles
and blocked opponents' kicks for the

Papooses.
Norm, who is destined to join the
r.nks of his fellow Shish-kabobers
fiugasian and Kerkorian in the
hearts of Stanford rooters, has ca
pably lived up to liis advance repu
tation. A former all-city of Los An
geles prep from Dorsey High School,
the Manoog was the lightest man on
the fordward wall. But his aggressive
play and ability to dope out plays in
advance help him pile up opposing
ball-carriers la! day long.

Backing up these two were a
whole brace of almost as outstand
ing guards and tackles. Jim Virk,
Tom Romano, Al Planner, Ken
Downey, Carter Pyle, and Hayden
Leason would all make any college
coach happy.
Future Fullback
fn the backßeld, Frank "Skip"
Crist was the brightest prospect. A
bruising fullback who drives hard
and fast, Skip may be the answer for
real power in the line-busting spot
in the Indian T-formation. The
Skipper, a product of Palo Alto
High, suffered an injured knee and
had to sit out two freshman contests,
but he came back belter than ever
to captain the Papoo:»cs in the "Little
Big Game."
Al Peterson, Dick Cargiulo, and
Bill Heilbron were '53's top runners
in the halfback positions. Peterson,
who suffered an early-season injury,
never was in top physical shape.
Who will be the soph stars on next
year's grid machine? What mem
bers of this year's undefeated frosh
will make the big jump to varsity
players in a single season?
Sophs A-Plenty
Tomorrow, when the Big Reds
take to the Stadium turf to meet
California in he '"Battle for the
Roses," many standouts will be
sophomores. The good record for
the present season would have been
impossible without the '52ers' val
uable performances. •
Now what about this year's fresh
men? Under the superb handling of
Coach Chuck Taylor, the Papooses
rolled up another unbroken chain of
victories. Of the wealth of talent on
the current yearling outfit, Coach
Taylor feels that the guards and
tackles showed the greatest promise
for future varsity assignments.
John and Norm
Topped by John Broderick and
Norman Manoogian, the line was
outstanding offensively and defen
sively. Both boys appeared in every
starting lineup and never failed to |
turn in a good performance.
