# Big Game Marks Finale For 15 Senior Gridders
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Fifteen Stanford gridders will be playing their last Big Game,
and perhaps their last game for the Farm, when the latest chapter
in the cross-Bay feud is written into the books tomorrow after
noon.
Heading the list of departing pigskinners are the 1949 co-

captains, Al Ran and Jim Castajnoli.
Both boys will be completing their
second year of first string duty; and
both have established themselves as
All-Coast contenders in their final
->eason.
Han has served "primarily on of
fense this year, hitting his peak of
efficiency two weeks ago in the Coli
seum against USC. Much of the
credit lor that upset Indian victory
was credited to the fine* blocking of
Rau, particularly on Stanford's dev
astating end sweeps.
Cas (Joes, Too
,Casta£noli is the spearhead of one
of the finest line-backing corps on the
Coast, arid has been a wizard all sea
son at diagnosing the opposition's of
fense. Cass is but a junior, but has
run his string of eligibility to the hilt.
The oldest veteran, from the stand
point of years of service, who will be
setting sail in the civilian sea come
sheepskin time is four-year per
former Mickey Titus.
Mickey was a star halfback on (lie
11)46 Stanford eleven, but a plague of
injuries has kepi his playing time at
a minimum since then.
Three Ends, Also
One of the positions which will be
hardest hit by graduation is at end,
where Marchie Schwartz will bid a
sad farewell to no less than three top
i flight wingmen. They are Ken Rose,
i Al Laakso, und Dan Mervin.
Rose, the Turlock titan who has
been named by Schwartz as the "best
end west of the Mississippi," is among
the Conference leaders in pass re
ceiving; but he has been just as valu
able to the Indians as a blocker and
defensive ace.
Laakso is one of the best blockers
and tacklers on the squad, despite his
comparatively light weight of 17:)
pounds.
Mervin lettered in both 1947 and
1948, but the injury jinx slowed him
down this year; and he saw less ac
tion than in the two previous seu
' sons.
Lose Peck, Field
The defensive halfback slots will
also provide the Card mentor with
some replacement headaches come
1950, for both Ken Peck and Dave
: Field, the Midget Maulers, will be
i among those not present next au
i lumn.
The two 160-pounders have been
! invaluable on defense all year, con
sistently delighting Farm rooters
with their precision tackling.
Rupe Andrews, also a halfback but
| strictly an offensive specialist, grad
uates along with Peck and Field.
; Rambling Rupert, who will trot the
! 440 for Stanford next spring, is one
| of Schwartz's fleet halfback corps.
FB Spot Hit Hardest
But it is the fullback slot that will
I receive the most concentrated rid
j dling by the diploma barrage.
Emery Mitchell and his famous
i knee brace are leaving.
Trojan-killer Bill DeYoung will
graduate.
And Bud Klein, who was at his

shiniest against Oregon State, will
complete the coup d'etat when he
gathers in his sheepskin.
'1 hat's quite a blow for any coach
to lake. Mitchell was once being
boomed for All-American before the
Army manhandled his knee; De-
Young is a hard-hitting, fast-moving
powerhouse who turned in some of
the Indians' longest runs of the year;
;uid Klein, while suffering from the
misfortune of playiny behind two
such top-flight backs, proved on
numerous occasions that, he can really
pack the mail when given a chance.
A trio of three-year performers in
the Card line complete the list of de
partees.
They are Jack Barnes und John
Hosekrans, bcl i centers, although
Rosie has seen some action at tackle,
and Dun Fix, an even-200-pounder
whose reliable play has earned him
the first-string right guard position
for two full years.

Coast, arid has been a wizard all sea
son at diagnosing the opposition's of
fense. Cass is but a junior, but has
run his string of eligibility to the hilt.
The oldest veteran, from the stand
point of years of service, who will be
setting sail in the civilian sea come
sheepskin time is four-year per
former Mickey Titus.
Mickey was a star halfback on (lie
11)46 Stanford eleven, but a plague of
injuries has kepi his playing time at
a minimum since then.
Three Ends, Also
One of the positions which will be
hardest hit by graduation is at end,
where Marchie Schwartz will bid a
sad farewell to no less than three top
i flight wingmen. They are Ken Rose,
i Al Laakso, und Dan Mervin.
Rose, the Turlock titan who has
been named by Schwartz as the "best
end west of the Mississippi," is among
the Conference leaders in pass re
ceiving; but he has been just as valu
able to the Indians as a blocker and
defensive ace.
Laakso is one of the best blockers
and tacklers on the squad, despite his
comparatively light weight of 17:)
pounds.
Mervin lettered in both 1947 and
1948, but the injury jinx slowed him
down this year; and he saw less ac
tion than in the two previous seu
' sons.
Lose Peck, Field
The defensive halfback slots will
also provide the Card mentor with
some replacement headaches come
1950, for both Ken Peck and Dave
: Field, the Midget Maulers, will be
i among those not present next au
i lumn.
The two 160-pounders have been
! invaluable on defense all year, con
sistently delighting Farm rooters
with their precision tackling.
Rupe Andrews, also a halfback but
| strictly an offensive specialist, grad
uates along with Peck and Field.
; Rambling Rupert, who will trot the
! 440 for Stanford next spring, is one
| of Schwartz's fleet halfback corps.
FB Spot Hit Hardest
But it is the fullback slot that will
I receive the most concentrated rid
j dling by the diploma barrage.
Emery Mitchell and his famous
i knee brace are leaving.
Trojan-killer Bill DeYoung will
graduate.
And Bud Klein, who was at his

shiniest against Oregon State, will
complete the coup d'etat when he
gathers in his sheepskin.
'1 hat's quite a blow for any coach
to lake. Mitchell was once being
boomed for All-American before the
Army manhandled his knee; De-
Young is a hard-hitting, fast-moving
powerhouse who turned in some of
the Indians' longest runs of the year;
;uid Klein, while suffering from the
misfortune of playiny behind two
such top-flight backs, proved on
numerous occasions that, he can really
pack the mail when given a chance.
A trio of three-year performers in
the Card line complete the list of de
partees.
They are Jack Barnes und John
Hosekrans, bcl i centers, although
Rosie has seen some action at tackle,
and Dun Fix, an even-200-pounder
whose reliable play has earned him
the first-string right guard position
for two full years.
