# Veteran Cards Help Chances
## 
### 
When the 52nd Big Game gets un
der way tomorrow, Stanford's sopho
more Redskins will have a host of
Big Game veterans to keep them
.sleady and headed in the right di
rection.
Among the Stanford gridders who
have played against California in the
last two close ones are:
DAVE FIELD—A defensive spe
cialist who rises to great heights in
this annual contest. Field, 153 pounds
of tackling dynamite, was a lead
ing reason why Cal did not run up
scores on the Cards in '47 and '48.
Last season, he pounced on a Cal
fumble in the air to run it back for
a touchdown, only to have it ruled
out on a quick whistle. He also came
up with a one-handed interception
of a Jensen pass that was a highlight
of the game.
KEN HOSE — Tomorrow will be
Ken's second Big One. He scored the
Card touchdown last season, taking a
jump pass from Tom Shaw and run
ning over two Bears for the score.
JIM CASTAGNOLI—Cass was one
of Stanford's outstanding defensive
cogs last season. He will be ready to
give with more of the same tomor
row.
KFN PECK—was missing from last
year's scene, but was very much in
evidence in the 1947, 21-18 fight.
Still doing a top defensive job.
DON FIX Old reliable will be
shirting his third Big Game. Fix is
.i great offensive blocker.
TOM SIIAW — Called one of his
best games against Cal last season.
Passed to Ko.se for the touchdown.
DAN MERVTN—wiII be seeing ac
tion in his third Big Game. Warmed
up for Ibis crucial with a two-touch
down performance against Idaho.
Mervin is a great receiver, but has
not seen too much duty this season.
GORDON WHITE-His second Big
Game. Is a steady man. Is a blocking
genius. Set up Stanford's score last
season when he recovered Paul
Keckley's fumble.
808 WHlTE—carried the ball 12
times in his first Big Game, picking
up 41 yards for his efforts. Was in
the ball game in the last seconds, try
in;? for a game-winning trick pass
play touchdown.
