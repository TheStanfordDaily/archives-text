No. Name Wt Ht. Pos. Hf. Wt. Name No.
3 McCOLL 217 6-4 LER 6-2 190 MINAHEN 81
McColl is the biggest man on the squad. Pass-catcher deluxe, Rye and Laakso will
share job. Both are defensive standouts. Rye is deadly pass-rusher, but bad knee may
bother him.
Minahen starting only because Pressley is hampered by mid-season injuries. Entire
position is weakened because of injuries and graduation losses.
23 WHITE, C. 216 6-1 LTR 6-4 235 TURNER 79
White is sharp blocker. A key man on clearing way for ground attack. Walker will
see most of defensive action, his number "7" can be spotted on almost every pile-up.
Turner is inspirational leader. Despite a tremendous string of injuries, he has re
turned for his fourth year, and has been a mainstay of forward wall. He plays with a
brace on knee. Len Jones, 217-pound Negro, plays the defensive post here. He is
rough on getting after the passer and a hard man to move out. Herb Schmalen
berger, at 198, is the lightest man in this position.
I
40 LUCAS 194 6-1 LCR 6-1 205 FRANZ 67
Lucas is improving rapidly. Didn't play frosh football, and just recently switched
over from basketball. Cone is defensive genius. A sophomore, he has already made
several All-Coast selections. Hart Cook will share offensive duties with Lucas, is a
hard, low charger, and a good man on leading plays.
Franz is two-time All-American. Waldorf says Franz is the hardest-charging de
fensive guard he has ever coached. He's good. So is his defensive understudy, Bobby
Dodds. Dodds is a two-year letterman, a senior.
I
44 CAS'CNOLI 207 6-0 C 6-2 215 RICHTER 50
Cass is rough and tough. Both offense and defense. Backs up line with Dick Abra
ham and Gordon Rice. Together they have made Stanford's defense the best on the
Coast.
Richter is another rough and tough customer. Made-over fullback, fits right into line
backing job. George Stathakis moves in when Cal goes on the defensive and is a
fine line-backer. A soph. In fact, four of the five centers are sophomores. Average
weight hits close to 205 pounds.
42 FIX 200 5-10 RCL 5-10 205 DeJONC 66
Fix is oldest man in lineup, starting his 26th game. Dependable and steady. Pomeroy,
a defensive rock, will divide time.
DeJong is fine blocker. Was understudy to Baker last season. They call him the
bomber. Forrest Klein, all 210 pounds of him, fills in on defense. Klein is one of five
I veterans in the seven-man Ca! guard spot. Ray Solari and Jim Price share part-time
i duty here. Both are juniors with one year of varsity experience.

I
23 RAU 199 6-2 RTL 5-11 225 CULLOM 77
Rau is steady. Quick and agile, he is a vicious blocker. Position will be greatly
strengthened if Wes Poulson is ready for heavy defensive duty.
Cullom's toe is Card nemesis. For two years he has been the difference. He is a hard
man to move around. Len Jones will see some action here, too. 210-pound Roy
Muehlberger starts if Cal kicks off. He is a two-year veteran and another hard man
to take out of the play. All in all, the tackle positions are oneof Cal's strongest.

a
26 ROSE 206 6-3 REL 6-1 193 BECOVICH 87
Rose is top offensive end on West Coast. Schwartz has celled him the best blocking
end he has ever coached. Rose is also a demon on pass-receiving. Van Alstyne will
handle defense. Van crashes like a two-ton truck.
Another position for the Bears which has greatly been weakened. Cunningham
would have been here, but was declared ineligible. Begovich is good receiver and alert.
He is one of Celeri's favorite targets. He knows what to do after receiving the ball.
Watch him. Bob Minahen takes over on defense. Was a rock against Oregon last
week. Norm Pressley and Glenn Stern will also see action here. Pressley is a senior
with one year of varsity work.
25 HUCASIAN 180 6-3 REL 5-11 185 M'NCHINO 55
Hugasian, Andrews, and Field make this Stanford's strongest position. The Hipster
runs through. Rupe runs around. Davey tackles anything near him.
Monachino is made-over fullback. May be replaced by regular Jack Swaner, who has
looked good in the last two games after recovering from a knee injury. Both lads
block well, but Monachino shines on quick openers and end runs. Bill Montagne,
I a two-year veteran, handles the defensive work. Is alert, quick-reactingâ€”a "fine
I pass defender.

66 WHITE, B. 174 5-1 1 RHL 5-11 185 BRUNK 40
White is inspirational runner. Broke up SC game with 80-yard romp. Is fast and
tough. Ken Peck will pick up defense. Peck is a specialist, alert, fast, and deadly.
Brunk has been a leading threat all season. Hero of the USC game, with 102-yard run.
Billy Main and Charlie Sarver both should have been here but are missing. Brunk is
one of Celeri's best receivers. Burr's brother, Paul Baldwin, plays on defense. He
went G8 yards for a touchdown last week against Oregon on a punt return. He comes
up well on runs but can be passed over, or at least has been thus far this year.
I
20 DeYOUNC 200 6-1 F 5-11 185 SCHABR'M 32
DeYoung is the Big Train. A lightning-fast bulldozer. Goes wide with the best.
Mitchell gives position depth, strength, and is leading punter in the PCC. Bud Klein
is next in line, only because DeYoung and Mitchell are on the team. Klein is one of
the cutest runners on the squad. He may go if given a chance.
Schabarum is a swivel-hipped line-plunger. Has been a rugged ball-packer for
Bears cause. Pappy used seven men in this position last week. Eric Schultz seems to
be one of the best there, but Rube Navarro runs well after early injuries. Don
Robison is a soph Hash here.
I
17 K'RK'RIAN 180 6-1 Q 5-11 170 CELERI 22
Kerkorian is dangerous from anywhere. Is a gambler, but smart. His passing is
unusually deadly. He's the cog. Horn may see some action if Kerkorian tries de
fense, too. Tom Shaw is next in line.
Celeri is the Cal offense. Ask Bill Leiser. He runs, passes, and punts. He's an unpre
dictable gambler. A great field-general. He will meet his stiffest test tomorrow.
If injuries sideline him, Boots Erb will take over. Erb looked good last week after
playing second string most of the year. Both men like to pass and will do so.
Watch out, Dave, Ken, Gary, and Bill.
