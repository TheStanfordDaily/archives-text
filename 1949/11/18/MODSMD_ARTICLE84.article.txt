won nine straight games this year.
Chief among the returnees, from
the Cards point of view anyway, is
big Jim Cullom. This is the lad who
had kicked four out of four tries
for-points in the last two years, to
give his team the margin of victory
over Stanford.

Franz and Jack Swaner, were around
last year. In fact, this will be the
fourth Big Game for the duo.

last year for a 2.3 average. He, Pete
Schabarum, and quarterback Bob
Celeri are the only backfield men who
played in last year's contest.

last year and by so doing broke the
California record for total points
made in a season, G6. Cullom's con
version gave him the Cal conversion
record for a year, 21.
Celeri threw seven passes and
completed two for 20 yards. He car
ried the ball four times for an 8.2
average. Schabarum did not carry
the ball.

1948, 7 to 6 game. Both are one
year lettermen.

returning tackles, while Pay DeJong,

are one-year monogram winners.

Of the 51 men listed in the above
roster, only 12 played in last year's
Stanford-California game. Of the 15
missing from that Cal team, six were
first-stringers.
Yet, this is the Bear outfit that has
won nine straight games this year.
Chief among the returnees, from
the Cards point of view anyway, is
big Jim Cullom. This is the lad who
had kicked four out of four tries
for-points in the last two years, to
give his team the margin of victory
over Stanford.
Two other Cal stalwarts, Rod
Franz and Jack Swaner, were around
last year. In fact, this will be the
fourth Big Game for the duo.
Swaner carried the ball 12 times
last year for a 2.3 average. He, Pete
Schabarum, and quarterback Bob
Celeri are the only backfield men who
played in last year's contest.
Swaner scored Cal's touchdown
last year and by so doing broke the
California record for total points
made in a season, G6. Cullom's con
version gave him the Cal conversion
record for a year, 21.
Celeri threw seven passes and
completed two for 20 yards. He car
ried the ball four times for an 8.2
average. Schabarum did not carry
the ball.
George Souza and Norm Pressley
are returning Hankmen from the
1948, 7 to 6 game. Both are one
year lettermen.
Cullom, Herb Schmalenberger, are
returning tackles, while Pay DeJong,
Forrest Klein, Ray Solari, and Franz
are back from the guard spot.
