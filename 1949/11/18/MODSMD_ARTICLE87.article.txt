# Liebendorfer: '47 Game For Downright Drama
## 
### TOM WIEDER 
The relative merits of past Big
Games will be argued at the Cellar,
at reunions, in barrooms ,and wher
ever Stanford and Cal rooters meet.
The 1947 Big Game will receive a
99 percent vote among the younger
bloods of the Farm, but those who
have been around since the days of
Andy Kerr and Clark Shaughnessy
are not so sure.
Don Liebendorfer, athletic public
ity director, has a hard time decid
ing between the '24 and '47 Big Games.
"I guess for downright drama
throughout an entire game the one of
1947 would get my vote. Most of the
di'ama in the '24 Big Game came in the
last five minutes. Even with the score
against us in '47 we looked better."
'48 Game Thrills Sterling
Dr. Sterling has only seen a few of
the Big Games, but the '48 Game gets
his nod.
"I hadn't seen a Big Game for over
10 years, ever since Moscrip and
Grayson beat Cal for the Vow Boys
back in 1935. It wasn't arranged for
me to come up from Pasadena until
the last minute, so it was exciting
just to get to another Big Game. For
sheer thrills I'll have to take the '48
game."
Ernie Hipp and L. F. Mayrhofer
have been around the composing
room of the Daily backshop since the
early 'twenties, and they'll never for
get the Game of 1924.
"That was the year Pop Warner
came out from Pittsburgh," they ex
plained. "Nevers had a couple of bad
ankles and lie couldn't play at all.
But after Cal had led Stanford for
almost the whole game, the Cards
pushed over two touchdowns in the
last couple of minutes. Cuddeback
kicked the extra point to end it up
20-20."
'35 Game Exciting
Mr. Gunther, manager of the Cel
lar, picks the Big Game of 1935 as
number one in his book.
"We got off to a great start, push
ing over two touchdowns in the first
half. Grayson and Moscrip just took
the heart right out of Cal, and the
Bears never did get back in the ball
game. They were passing all over,
especially in the fourth quarter, but
we held them off and won 13-0."
Blackie at the Encina Store holds
the 1933 game as the most outstand
ing. That was the thriller which saw
a Grayson pass to Moscrip win the
game for Stanford, 7-3, in the last

minutes of a game that was all but
lost.
There you have it. But all these
will be forgotten when Stanford and
California meet again Saturday. Stan
ford rooters, from freshman to presi
dent, will have another Big Game to
argue about for a long time to come.
