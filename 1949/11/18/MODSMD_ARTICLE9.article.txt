# CAL STUDENT BODY
## ASUC Signs Up Members Every Year 
### 
Take the number of Stanford stu
dents, multiply by two and a half,
and you have the student body of
the University of California. To cone
with that many students would be
a full time job for their leaders even
if they ciian't have to v.orry about
tests and homework also.
The ASUC, which i.-, equivalent to
Stanford's ASSU has a membership
of 20,000. In comparison to our
method at the Farm where every
student is automatically a member of
the ASSU, students i.t California
must voluntarily join the ASUC.
Only 3,500 out of 23,500 have failed
to buy student-body cards which
cost $12.50.
The Executive Committee is at the
head of the government and has the
same general functions as our Ex
com. The student-body president
works through the Executive Com
mittee and coordinates the activities
q1 five boards which carry the bur
den of administrative problems. A
NSA staff committee advises the
Executive Committee and the presi
dent.
12 Members
In contrast to the voting proce
dure at Stanford, living groups play
no part in the election of candidates
for the Executive Committee. There
are twelve voting members on the
committeeâ€”nine students, one fac
ulty member, one alumnus, and the
university president.
Since the student-body president
aod vice-president are automatic
members, there are seven seats open
for- student candidates. All are titled
representatives-at-large and run for
office with no qualifications regard
ing their residence.
Joint Judiciary
In the place of Stanford's Men and
Women's Councils, California has a
Student Judicial committee which
judges all major violations and passes
its decisions to the university for
final decision. One of the more com
mon punishments is the loss of one's
student-body card. Direct responsi
bility for enforcing social regulations
falls to the house presidents, and
their burden is greater now than
before due to the liquor ban.
Late hours for women are much
more liberal than those at Stanford,
but there are still those girls who find
themselves locked out in the Berke
ley fog at 2:31 in the morning. Mi
nor cases such as this are not han
dled by the Student Judicial Com
mittee but go before a women's
board.
