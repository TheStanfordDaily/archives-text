# Biggest Big Game in 52-Year Rivalry Will Have Audience of Over 175,000
## 
### 
Fifty-two years of football rivalry
will explode in Stanford Stadium to
morrow when California's Golden
Bears invade the Barm for the 194!)
I Big Game.
A sell-out crowd of more than 90,-
i 000 persons will witness this strug
gle, as will 35,000 television fans.
And perhaps 50.000 more will listen
to Red Barber in a nation-wide ra
dio broadcast, the first of its kind in
j Stanford Stadium.
So, without a doubt, it will be the
j biggest Big Game of all time, reach
| ing its greatest audience, and holding
the key to the heavenly gate of foot
: ball—the Rose Bowl.
But don't tell tiiar :o any oid grads
; tomorrow, because they'll tell you
that all the Big Games arc the
greatest ever, and if you offer argu
ment, they will refer you back to
j some of the old days.
They'll be talking a'jout Ernie
Nevers, Prank Albert, Murray Cud-,
deback, Ted S'nipkey, Monk Moscrip,
Jim Lawson, Dick Hyland, Bill Hoff
man, and Bobby Grayson.
And they will have plenty to say.
[ You will hear about the games in
which the Redskins didn't rate a
chance, but fell back on that old
I Stanford Spirit, and whipped down
the big boys from Berkeley. To put
j you in shape for such goings-on,
: watch out for the following:
1892—The first Big Game, it was in
the spring that Stanford dared to
; challenge the heavier, more experi-
I cnccd men from California. The game
was played in San Francisco, with
the Bears being heavy favorites. But,
here it is in black and white: Stan
ford won, 14-10.
1924 — Walter Camp and many

other critics called it the greatest
game of all time. The Bears were
working on a five-year win streak,
and were expected to keep things
going. With only 10 minutes on the
| clock and the Bears out in front, 20
ti 6, it looked like a closed transac
; tion. But, Stanford exploded with a
tremendous comeback. Ted Shipkey
made an impossible catch in the end
zone to start the fireworks. Then, on
J the last play, Murray Cuddeback
j turned in his great touchdown catch,
I and with the game already over,
Cuddeback booted the tying point,
20-20.
1925 —Ernest Nevers finally broke
! the string for sure with a day of un
! stoppable plunging and running, 27
to 14.
1926 —Things get better and better.
Dick Hyland bounced 48 yards to an
early touchdown to spark a 41 to 6
I effort which still stand as Stanford's
most one-sided Big Game victory.
However, highest score of the series
came three years later, Stanford 41
to California 0.
1935—This was the last year of the
| Vow Boys and their most convincing
J win over California, who had gone
| into the game a slight favorite be
cause of an unbeaten season to that
point. Two tremendous 80-yard
drives by Stanford spelled disaster
for California in the first half. Jimmy
Cofiis and Bobby Grayson scored the
touchdowns, Stanford 13 to 0.

1940 Albert the Great monkeyed
around quite a bit with his Bear
friends, but finally handed of! to
Kmetovic and Gallarneau for two
! scores and a tough 13 to 7 verdict.
1946 —A ins ley Bell, Wayne Erick
j son, and Bob Anderson ganged up
! to lead Stanford to a 25 to 6 Big Game
! romp, the last time Stanford was able
j to handle the Bears.
1917 — The Give -'L:n - the - Axe
\ Game. The Cards were despised 10
to 1 underdoes, but they stunned Cal
| with a second-half onslaught that had
I the Bears reeling. The Indians scored
! three times to lead, 18 to 14, with only
; three minutes remaining. It looked
j for certain that the Cards, losers of
I eight straight games, had accom-
I plished a miracle.
But, just as hopes were highest, a
j dazed and delirious Stanford root
ing section watched helplessly as a
Cal sub halfback, Paul Keckley, took
a cross-field pass from Jack Jensen
and sprinted over GO yards for the
game-winning score. Final was 21 to
18.
1918 Jim CuHorn's toe cheated the
Card for the second consecutivc year,
7 to 6.
1949—Gary Kerkorian kicked nine
straight conversions last Saturday
| against Idaho.
There were approximately 8,000,-
J 000 pianos out of tune at Big Game
' time in 1926.
