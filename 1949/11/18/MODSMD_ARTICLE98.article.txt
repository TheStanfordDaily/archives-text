As I press-reported the first 21 Big
Games, have witnessed some 700 grid
iron, rugby, association, and Gaelic '
Football contests, and 4.> years ago
developed football charts, my pres- j
ent comments, flown across continent
from Washington, may have reader
interest immediately preceding this
41st California-Stanford meeting for j
the Big Game.
Prior to the use of the shift in 1906, !
to foster more open rugby, the heavi
est Big Game varsity was Stanford's
1894 eleven, averaging 178; and the
heaviest individual players were Hag
gard, '95, 226-pound center; Carle, '98,
212-pounds, both of Stanford, and
Overall, '03, 201-pound California J
guard. , . .
The first Big Game was delayed one
hour because both teams forgot to j
provide a football.
On the night of the 1894 Big Game,
Whitehouse, '96, former Stanford
varsity tackle, and Rosenfeld, '95,
sub-halfback, were seriously bullet- l
wounded and the face of McMillan,
'97, former varsity guard, was grazed
by a third bullet from a revolver fired
at close range by a disgruntled Cali
fornia undergraduate. Since there
! were no deaths, the affair was hushed
j up and settled out of court.
At the 1896 Big Game, an incipient
I riot, started by California students at
tacking and wrecking the Stanford
score-board, was stopped by inrush
ing police.
The following year the roof over
the center section reserved for the
"society" set, hammocked down and
tobogganed three urchins, causing a
near panic, so officials promptly
stopped the game four minutes early,
with Stanford near a touchdown.
At the last of the Thanksgiving Big
Games, in 1907, 14 spectators were i
killed by the crash-in of a skylight
atop the roof of a nearby glass works, j
where about 50 "dead-heads" were
assembled.

near panic, so officials promptly
stopped the game four minutes early,
with Stanford near a touchdown.
At the last of the Thanksgiving Big
Games, in 1907, 14 spectators were i
killed by the crash-in of a skylight
atop the roof of a nearby glass works, j
where about 50 "dead-heads" were
assembled.

As I press-reported the first 21 Big
Games, have witnessed some 700 grid
iron, rugby, association, and Gaelic '
Football contests, and 4.> years ago
developed football charts, my pres- j
ent comments, flown across continent
from Washington, may have reader
interest immediately preceding this
41st California-Stanford meeting for j
the Big Game.
Prior to the use of the shift in 1906, !
to foster more open rugby, the heavi
est Big Game varsity was Stanford's
1894 eleven, averaging 178; and the
heaviest individual players were Hag
gard, '95, 226-pound center; Carle, '98,
212-pounds, both of Stanford, and
Overall, '03, 201-pound California J
guard. , . .
The first Big Game was delayed one
hour because both teams forgot to j
provide a football.
On the night of the 1894 Big Game,
Whitehouse, '96, former Stanford
varsity tackle, and Rosenfeld, '95,
sub-halfback, were seriously bullet- l
wounded and the face of McMillan,
'97, former varsity guard, was grazed
by a third bullet from a revolver fired
at close range by a disgruntled Cali
fornia undergraduate. Since there
! were no deaths, the affair was hushed
j up and settled out of court.
At the 1896 Big Game, an incipient
I riot, started by California students at
tacking and wrecking the Stanford
score-board, was stopped by inrush
ing police.
The following year the roof over
the center section reserved for the
"society" set, hammocked down and
tobogganed three urchins, causing a
near panic, so officials promptly
stopped the game four minutes early,
with Stanford near a touchdown.
