HALFTIME WAS STANFORD'S TIME TO HOWL, and the In
juns did with a perfect afternoon of card stunts. But the 7 to 6
halftime lead was not to last, although at this point you couldn't
have told that to a single person among the 8,000 rooters who
formed the section.


"I GOTCHA," SAYS BIG BILL McCOLL, as he goes up for a
second-quarter Kerkorian pass. McColl, who played the best
game of his collegiate career against the Bears last Saturday,
figured prominently in Stanford's two and one-half quarters of
offensive power. Cal's Bill Montagne is rushing up to make
Ihe stop.


TURNING BACK THE PAGES to 1946 cover of Chaparral earned
Lathrop and Alpha Kappa Lambda the first-place trophy in the
women's division for Homecoming Decorations. The score back
in 1946 was 25 to 6, Stanford winning. It was a nice idea.
