# Nationalist Cleavage
## 
### 
IION(■ KONG —Li Tsung-jen, Na
tionalist China's acting president,
flew to this British colony and en
tered a nursing home late today.
It appeared as a major develop
ment in his split with Generalissimo
Chiang Kai - shek — a deepening
cleavage that has set the National
ists to bickering among themselves
while the Communists steadily con
tinue their conquest of China.
Although Li insisted he hoped to
return to duty as soon as a serious
stomach ailment permitted, he
handed his job over to Premier Yen
Hsi-shan, and the Hong Kong press
said he might go to the United j
States.
