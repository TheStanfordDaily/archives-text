## 
### 
OSLO, Norway A Dutch plane
with 150 Jewish refugee children
aboard was given up as lost, today
and fear was expressed that it had
crashed in a wild forest and lake
area only a mile from Oslo.
Hundreds of searchers combed the
forests around Oslo in the rain and
darkness for a sign of the plane,
which a'jo carried a crew of four
and two Swedish nurses. The hunt
was concentrated on Lake Gjers
jocn, a mile southeast of Oslo, where
a sharp flash of light followed by
an explosion had been reported.
Aero Holland, owners of the
plane, announced at The Hague that
it considered the plane lost and rel
atives of the Dutch crew were so
informed.
