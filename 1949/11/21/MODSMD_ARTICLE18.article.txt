# Forensic Meet Begins Today
## 
### 
It's going to be hard to get a word
in edgewise at Stanford today, to
morrow, and Wednesday.
For 400 debaters from 50 univer
sities and colleges in 11 Western
states will be holding the 15th meet
ing of the Western Speech Associa
tion Student Congress and Debate
Tournament.
The tournament, which will be the
forensic counterpart of a three-ring
circus, will match the West's out
standing student debaters in compe
tition in debating, extemporaneous
and impromptu speaking, oratory,
after-dinner speaking, and a novel
"experimental speaking" contest in
which the student will be considered
to be applying for a job.
The activities will open with a
student congress at 9 this morning
in Memorial Hall. The congress,
broken down into committee and
general sessions, will discuss the
problems of American relations with
the Orient.
This same theme will be the sub
ject of the debate competition in
which the question will be "Re
solved, that the United States should
establish a Marshall Plan for the
Orient."
The Stanford committee in charge
of arrangements for the tournament
includes Tom Brand, debate man
ager, general chairman; Mary Kil
bourne, assistant chairman; Profes
sor James Gordon Emerson, faculty
host in charge of student and faculty
hospitality; David Grant, acting de
bate coach for the fall quarter,
speech contests; and William Smith,
assistant debate coach, housing. Pro
fessor Leland Chapin was prelimi
nary chairman for general planning
done during the summer quarter.
