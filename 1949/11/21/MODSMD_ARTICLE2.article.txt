# Traffic Tieups, No Accidents
## 
### 
Big Game traflic created all-time
records on Peninsula highways Sat
urday, but despite numerous jam
ups, there were no major accidents.
Five hours before game time, ears
had piled up bumper to bumper
from Redwood City to Palo Alto on
three different highways. Bayshore,
seeing the largest jams, was almost
equaled by E! Camino and Skyline
Boulevard.
The Highway Patrol at Redwood
City reported numerous rear - end
collisions and locked bumpers, but
said the slow speed of the cars pre
vented any serious accidents.
Traflic following the game failed
to reach the pre-game peak, and all
highways were reported cleared by
6:30 p.m.
