# Cal Line Swamps Cards, Shatters Hopes—33 to 14
## 
### JOHN BREIER

There is a saying in the coaching profession that you can't win
if you don't have the horses.
Stanford didn't have the horses, Cal did; and that just about
sums up the 1949 Big Game. For the record it was Cal 33, Stan
ford 14.

What that score does not tell is that the Indians were very much

in the game until the Bears loosed
many, many "horses" in the third
quarter to swamp the outmanned
Stanfords.
And now all the Cards have to fall
back on is the usual "next year"
mutterings and a very poor anti-cli
max in a January 2 game with the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
Whether or not this game is to be
played will be decided this afternoon
when Athletic Director A 1 Masters
meets with a representative of the
island school.
Rude Awakening
The loss was a hard blow to Stan
ford fans who had been led to be
lieve that their boys could meet the
strong, well - coached Cal line on
even terms. It wasn't in the books.
The Bear victory came as a result
of what are called "the bread and
butter plays of the T" —quick open
ers. It was just brute force, little
or no deception attempted, that
jammed the tiring and injury-ridden
Stanfords backward for three
touchdowns in the third quarter.
The big Bear guards and tackles
handled their opponents with ease
in that period to spring Jack Swa
ner and Jim Monachino loose on
long gainers.
Ahead at Half
It is true that Stanford led 7 to
6 at half-time and 14 to 13 in the
third period, but the issue was re
moved from the realm of doubt
when the hard - charging Cal line
went to work thereafter.
And this was the Cal team that
had been riddled with injuries and
graduation losses. This was the
team that Pappy Waldorf and his
fine staff built back up to win every
game and the Rose Bowl bid. This
was the team that outplayed and
outspirited the Cards to end anoth
er unbeaten season.
There were some moments of joy
for the Cardinal and White. Bobby
White, a lad who wouldn't give up,
Bill McCoil, he who played like the
All-American he must someday be
come, Russ Pomeroy, defensive gi
ant until injuries sidelined him—
these men will be back for another
year. The tragic part is that men
such as Ken Rose. Rupe Andrews,
Jim Castagnoli. A 1 Rau, Emery
Mitchell, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and
Don Fix ended their football days
without a win over the Blue and
Gold.
White, Rose Shine
But topping all Red efforts was
the work of Bob White and Ken
Rose. White carried the ball nine
times for an 8.2 average. He con
nected for two out of two passes to
boot. A few more Bob Whites and
Stanford might be celebrating.
If any end ever turned in an All-
Coast or better performance, Ken
Rose did so Saturday. Rupe An-
