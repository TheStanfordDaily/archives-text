# Cal Line Swamps Cards, Shatters Hopes—33 to 14
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Daily Sports Editor
There is a saying in the coaching profession that you can't win
if you don't have the horses.
Stanford didn't have the horses, Cal did; and that just about
sums up the 1949 Big Game. For the record it was Cal 33, Stan
ford 14.

What that score does not tell is that the Indians were very much

in the game until the Bears loosed
many, many "horses" in the third
quarter to swamp the outmanned
Stanfords.
And now all the Cards have to fall
back on is the usual "next year"
mutterings and a very poor anti-cli
max in a January 2 game with the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
Whether or not this game is to be
played will be decided this afternoon
when Athletic Director A 1 Masters
meets with a representative of the
island school.
Rude Awakening
The loss was a hard blow to Stan
ford fans who had been led to be
lieve that their boys could meet the
strong, well - coached Cal line on
even terms. It wasn't in the books.
The Bear victory came as a result
of what are called "the bread and
butter plays of the T" —quick open
ers. It was just brute force, little
or no deception attempted, that
jammed the tiring and injury-ridden
Stanfords backward for three
touchdowns in the third quarter.
The big Bear guards and tackles
handled their opponents with ease
in that period to spring Jack Swa
ner and Jim Monachino loose on
long gainers.
Ahead at Half
It is true that Stanford led 7 to
6 at half-time and 14 to 13 in the
third period, but the issue was re
moved from the realm of doubt
when the hard - charging Cal line
went to work thereafter.
And this was the Cal team that
had been riddled with injuries and
graduation losses. This was the
team that Pappy Waldorf and his
fine staff built back up to win every
game and the Rose Bowl bid. This
was the team that outplayed and
outspirited the Cards to end anoth
er unbeaten season.
There were some moments of joy
for the Cardinal and White. Bobby
White, a lad who wouldn't give up,
Bill McCoil, he who played like the
All-American he must someday be
come, Russ Pomeroy, defensive gi
ant until injuries sidelined him—
these men will be back for another
year. The tragic part is that men
such as Ken Rose. Rupe Andrews,
Jim Castagnoli. A 1 Rau, Emery
Mitchell, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and
Don Fix ended their football days
without a win over the Blue and
Gold.
White, Rose Shine
But topping all Red efforts was
the work of Bob White and Ken
Rose. White carried the ball nine
times for an 8.2 average. He con
nected for two out of two passes to
boot. A few more Bob Whites and
Stanford might be celebrating.
If any end ever turned in an All-
Coast or better performance, Ken
Rose did so Saturday. Rupe An-
Drews was just a little all right too.
Better than eight yards per carry
for the Rupert.
For the record, the scoring went
as follows:
Cal scored first just as many had
predicted, by a long pass to a man
completely in the clear. Frank
Brunk ran 15 yards after catching a
40-yard toss by Bob Celeri. Cal (!.
Stanford 0.
First Indian TD
Bob White romped 1(5 yards for
the first Card marker after Russ
Pomeroy had recovered a Bear fum
ble on the Cal 1(5. Stanford 7, Cal (».
Cal boomed 79 yards by runs of
Swaner and Monachino, behind
great Bear blocking. Swaner went
over from the 1. Cal 12. Stanford 7.
Stanford came back on a 76-yard
march with Andrews doing most of
the work. Eric South wood scored
from the 6. Stanford 14, California
12.
From here on it was all Cal. Jim
Monachino went 84 yards to the
Stanford 4. Swaner went over two
plays later. California 19. Stanford
14.
Swanar ended a 67-yard march
by going over from the 2. Cullom
made the second conversion of four.
Cal 2(5. Stanford 14.
Last Onslaught
California went 71 yards in the
last four minutes of play for the
last TD of the day. Final score: Cal
Stanford 14.
A few breaks along about five
minutes before the half and the
score might have been a bit differ
ent. It was here that Card halfback
Harry Hugasian fumbled on the Cal
3 after a 61-yard Stanford march.
Again in the fourth period a
"break" went against the Cards
when Eric Southwood's l!)-yard TD
jaunt was called back when Don
Lucas was cought for illegal use of
the hands.
But even if these events had not
come about it is doubtful that the
Cards would have won. Hard as it
is lor a Stanford man to say it, Cal
was much the better team.
Attack Choked
Coach Waldorf played his ends in
such a fashion that the vaunted Card
wide attack was stopped when it
was needed most. Only the great
blocking of Mitchell and Rau gave
the Indians any yardage on those
plays.
In the end it was California's su
perior line play and corresponding
Stanford injuries that made the dif
ference. Stanford lost the full use
of Gordon White in the first quar
ter. Pomeroy was to follow, as was
Gordon Rice. Rice suffered a broken
leg.
These injuries hurt. But the loss
of Wes Poulson, Chuck Ilokanson,
and the reinjury of Hal Walker left
Schwartz with only Rau and Dick
Gaedtke available for offensive
tackle duty. Don Lucas, who nid
played with the Braves in the pre
liminary, was pressed for varsity
duty.
So another Big Game is in the
books. The Axe remains with Cali
fornia for at least another year. The
coaches take to another banquet cir
cuit and the undergraduates >ay,

sums up the 1949 Big Game. For the record it was Cal 33, Stan
ford 14.

What that score does not tell is that the Indians were very much

in the game until the Bears loosed
many, many "horses" in the third
quarter to swamp the outmanned
Stanfords.
And now all the Cards have to fall
back on is the usual "next year"
mutterings and a very poor anti-cli
max in a January 2 game with the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
Whether or not this game is to be
played will be decided this afternoon
when Athletic Director A 1 Masters
meets with a representative of the
island school.
Rude Awakening
The loss was a hard blow to Stan
ford fans who had been led to be
lieve that their boys could meet the
strong, well - coached Cal line on
even terms. It wasn't in the books.
The Bear victory came as a result
of what are called "the bread and
butter plays of the T" —quick open
ers. It was just brute force, little
or no deception attempted, that
jammed the tiring and injury-ridden
Stanfords backward for three
touchdowns in the third quarter.
The big Bear guards and tackles
handled their opponents with ease
in that period to spring Jack Swa
ner and Jim Monachino loose on
long gainers.
Ahead at Half
It is true that Stanford led 7 to
6 at half-time and 14 to 13 in the
third period, but the issue was re
moved from the realm of doubt
when the hard - charging Cal line
went to work thereafter.
And this was the Cal team that
had been riddled with injuries and
graduation losses. This was the
team that Pappy Waldorf and his
fine staff built back up to win every
game and the Rose Bowl bid. This
was the team that outplayed and
outspirited the Cards to end anoth
er unbeaten season.
There were some moments of joy
for the Cardinal and White. Bobby
White, a lad who wouldn't give up,
Bill McCoil, he who played like the
All-American he must someday be
come, Russ Pomeroy, defensive gi
ant until injuries sidelined him—
these men will be back for another
year. The tragic part is that men
such as Ken Rose. Rupe Andrews,
Jim Castagnoli. A 1 Rau, Emery
Mitchell, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and
Don Fix ended their football days
without a win over the Blue and
Gold.
White, Rose Shine
But topping all Red efforts was
the work of Bob White and Ken
Rose. White carried the ball nine
times for an 8.2 average. He con
nected for two out of two passes to
boot. A few more Bob Whites and
Stanford might be celebrating.
If any end ever turned in an All-
Coast or better performance, Ken
Rose did so Saturday. Rupe An-
Drews was just a little all right too.
Better than eight yards per carry
for the Rupert.
For the record, the scoring went
as follows:
Cal scored first just as many had
predicted, by a long pass to a man
completely in the clear. Frank
Brunk ran 15 yards after catching a
40-yard toss by Bob Celeri. Cal (!.
Stanford 0.
First Indian TD
Bob White romped 1(5 yards for
the first Card marker after Russ
Pomeroy had recovered a Bear fum
ble on the Cal 1(5. Stanford 7, Cal (».
Cal boomed 79 yards by runs of
Swaner and Monachino, behind
great Bear blocking. Swaner went
over from the 1. Cal 12. Stanford 7.
Stanford came back on a 76-yard
march with Andrews doing most of
the work. Eric South wood scored
from the 6. Stanford 14, California
12.
From here on it was all Cal. Jim
Monachino went 84 yards to the
Stanford 4. Swaner went over two
plays later. California 19. Stanford
14.
Swanar ended a 67-yard march
by going over from the 2. Cullom
made the second conversion of four.
Cal 2(5. Stanford 14.
Last Onslaught
California went 71 yards in the
last four minutes of play for the
last TD of the day. Final score: Cal
Stanford 14.
A few breaks along about five
minutes before the half and the
score might have been a bit differ
ent. It was here that Card halfback
Harry Hugasian fumbled on the Cal
3 after a 61-yard Stanford march.
Again in the fourth period a
"break" went against the Cards
when Eric Southwood's l!)-yard TD
jaunt was called back when Don
Lucas was cought for illegal use of
the hands.
But even if these events had not
come about it is doubtful that the
Cards would have won. Hard as it
is lor a Stanford man to say it, Cal
was much the better team.
Attack Choked
Coach Waldorf played his ends in
such a fashion that the vaunted Card
wide attack was stopped when it
was needed most. Only the great
blocking of Mitchell and Rau gave
the Indians any yardage on those
plays.
In the end it was California's su
perior line play and corresponding
Stanford injuries that made the dif
ference. Stanford lost the full use
of Gordon White in the first quar
ter. Pomeroy was to follow, as was
Gordon Rice. Rice suffered a broken
leg.
These injuries hurt. But the loss
of Wes Poulson, Chuck Ilokanson,
and the reinjury of Hal Walker left
Schwartz with only Rau and Dick
Gaedtke available for offensive
tackle duty. Don Lucas, who nid
played with the Braves in the pre
liminary, was pressed for varsity
duty.
So another Big Game is in the
books. The Axe remains with Cali
fornia for at least another year. The
coaches take to another banquet cir

many, many "horses" in the third
quarter to swamp the outmanned
Stanfords.
And now all the Cards have to fall
back on is the usual "next year"
mutterings and a very poor anti-cli
max in a January 2 game with the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
Whether or not this game is to be
played will be decided this afternoon
when Athletic Director A 1 Masters
meets with a representative of the
island school.
Rude Awakening
The loss was a hard blow to Stan
ford fans who had been led to be
lieve that their boys could meet the
strong, well - coached Cal line on
even terms. It wasn't in the books.
The Bear victory came as a result
of what are called "the bread and
butter plays of the T" —quick open
ers. It was just brute force, little
or no deception attempted, that
jammed the tiring and injury-ridden
Stanfords backward for three
touchdowns in the third quarter.
The big Bear guards and tackles
handled their opponents with ease
in that period to spring Jack Swa
ner and Jim Monachino loose on
long gainers.
Ahead at Half
It is true that Stanford led 7 to
6 at half-time and 14 to 13 in the
third period, but the issue was re
moved from the realm of doubt
when the hard - charging Cal line
went to work thereafter.
And this was the Cal team that
had been riddled with injuries and
graduation losses. This was the
team that Pappy Waldorf and his
fine staff built back up to win every
game and the Rose Bowl bid. This
was the team that outplayed and
outspirited the Cards to end anoth
er unbeaten season.
There were some moments of joy
for the Cardinal and White. Bobby
White, a lad who wouldn't give up,
Bill McCoil, he who played like the
All-American he must someday be
come, Russ Pomeroy, defensive gi
ant until injuries sidelined him—
these men will be back for another
year. The tragic part is that men
such as Ken Rose. Rupe Andrews,
Jim Castagnoli. A 1 Rau, Emery
Mitchell, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and
Don Fix ended their football days
without a win over the Blue and
Gold.
White, Rose Shine
But topping all Red efforts was
the work of Bob White and Ken
Rose. White carried the ball nine
times for an 8.2 average. He con
nected for two out of two passes to
boot. A few more Bob Whites and
Stanford might be celebrating.
If any end ever turned in an All-
Coast or better performance, Ken
Rose did so Saturday. Rupe An-
Drews was just a little all right too.
Better than eight yards per carry
for the Rupert.
For the record, the scoring went
as follows:
Cal scored first just as many had
predicted, by a long pass to a man
completely in the clear. Frank
Brunk ran 15 yards after catching a
40-yard toss by Bob Celeri. Cal (!.
Stanford 0.
First Indian TD
Bob White romped 1(5 yards for
the first Card marker after Russ
Pomeroy had recovered a Bear fum
ble on the Cal 1(5. Stanford 7, Cal (».
Cal boomed 79 yards by runs of
Swaner and Monachino, behind
great Bear blocking. Swaner went
over from the 1. Cal 12. Stanford 7.
Stanford came back on a 76-yard
march with Andrews doing most of
the work. Eric South wood scored
from the 6. Stanford 14, California
12.
From here on it was all Cal. Jim
Monachino went 84 yards to the
Stanford 4. Swaner went over two
plays later. California 19. Stanford
14.
Swanar ended a 67-yard march
by going over from the 2. Cullom
made the second conversion of four.
Cal 2(5. Stanford 14.
Last Onslaught
California went 71 yards in the
last four minutes of play for the
last TD of the day. Final score: Cal
Stanford 14.
A few breaks along about five
minutes before the half and the
score might have been a bit differ
ent. It was here that Card halfback
Harry Hugasian fumbled on the Cal
3 after a 61-yard Stanford march.
Again in the fourth period a
"break" went against the Cards
when Eric Southwood's l!)-yard TD
jaunt was called back when Don
Lucas was cought for illegal use of
the hands.
But even if these events had not
come about it is doubtful that the
Cards would have won. Hard as it
is lor a Stanford man to say it, Cal
was much the better team.
Attack Choked
Coach Waldorf played his ends in
such a fashion that the vaunted Card
wide attack was stopped when it
was needed most. Only the great
blocking of Mitchell and Rau gave
the Indians any yardage on those
plays.
In the end it was California's su
perior line play and corresponding
Stanford injuries that made the dif
ference. Stanford lost the full use
of Gordon White in the first quar
ter. Pomeroy was to follow, as was
Gordon Rice. Rice suffered a broken
leg.
These injuries hurt. But the loss
of Wes Poulson, Chuck Ilokanson,
and the reinjury of Hal Walker left
Schwartz with only Rau and Dick
Gaedtke available for offensive
tackle duty. Don Lucas, who nid
played with the Braves in the pre
liminary, was pressed for varsity
duty.
So another Big Game is in the
books. The Axe remains with Cali
fornia for at least another year. The
coaches take to another banquet cir

max in a January 2 game with the
University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
Whether or not this game is to be
played will be decided this afternoon
when Athletic Director A 1 Masters
meets with a representative of the
island school.
Rude Awakening
The loss was a hard blow to Stan
ford fans who had been led to be
lieve that their boys could meet the
strong, well - coached Cal line on
even terms. It wasn't in the books.
The Bear victory came as a result
of what are called "the bread and
butter plays of the T" —quick open
ers. It was just brute force, little
or no deception attempted, that
jammed the tiring and injury-ridden
Stanfords backward for three
touchdowns in the third quarter.
The big Bear guards and tackles
handled their opponents with ease
in that period to spring Jack Swa
ner and Jim Monachino loose on
long gainers.
Ahead at Half
It is true that Stanford led 7 to
6 at half-time and 14 to 13 in the
third period, but the issue was re
moved from the realm of doubt
when the hard - charging Cal line
went to work thereafter.
And this was the Cal team that
had been riddled with injuries and
graduation losses. This was the
team that Pappy Waldorf and his
fine staff built back up to win every
game and the Rose Bowl bid. This
was the team that outplayed and
outspirited the Cards to end anoth
er unbeaten season.
There were some moments of joy
for the Cardinal and White. Bobby
White, a lad who wouldn't give up,
Bill McCoil, he who played like the
All-American he must someday be
come, Russ Pomeroy, defensive gi
ant until injuries sidelined him—
these men will be back for another
year. The tragic part is that men
such as Ken Rose. Rupe Andrews,
Jim Castagnoli. A 1 Rau, Emery
Mitchell, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and
Don Fix ended their football days
without a win over the Blue and
Gold.
White, Rose Shine
But topping all Red efforts was
the work of Bob White and Ken
Rose. White carried the ball nine
times for an 8.2 average. He con
nected for two out of two passes to
boot. A few more Bob Whites and
Stanford might be celebrating.
If any end ever turned in an All-
Coast or better performance, Ken
Rose did so Saturday. Rupe An-
Drews was just a little all right too.
Better than eight yards per carry
for the Rupert.
For the record, the scoring went
as follows:
Cal scored first just as many had
predicted, by a long pass to a man
completely in the clear. Frank
Brunk ran 15 yards after catching a
40-yard toss by Bob Celeri. Cal (!.
Stanford 0.
First Indian TD
Bob White romped 1(5 yards for
the first Card marker after Russ
Pomeroy had recovered a Bear fum
ble on the Cal 1(5. Stanford 7, Cal (».
Cal boomed 79 yards by runs of
Swaner and Monachino, behind
great Bear blocking. Swaner went
over from the 1. Cal 12. Stanford 7.
Stanford came back on a 76-yard
march with Andrews doing most of
the work. Eric South wood scored
from the 6. Stanford 14, California
12.
From here on it was all Cal. Jim
Monachino went 84 yards to the
Stanford 4. Swaner went over two
plays later. California 19. Stanford
14.
Swanar ended a 67-yard march
by going over from the 2. Cullom
made the second conversion of four.
Cal 2(5. Stanford 14.
Last Onslaught
California went 71 yards in the
last four minutes of play for the
last TD of the day. Final score: Cal
Stanford 14.
A few breaks along about five
minutes before the half and the
score might have been a bit differ
ent. It was here that Card halfback
Harry Hugasian fumbled on the Cal
3 after a 61-yard Stanford march.
Again in the fourth period a
"break" went against the Cards
when Eric Southwood's l!)-yard TD
jaunt was called back when Don
Lucas was cought for illegal use of
the hands.
But even if these events had not
come about it is doubtful that the
Cards would have won. Hard as it
is lor a Stanford man to say it, Cal
was much the better team.
Attack Choked
Coach Waldorf played his ends in
such a fashion that the vaunted Card
wide attack was stopped when it
was needed most. Only the great
blocking of Mitchell and Rau gave
the Indians any yardage on those
plays.
In the end it was California's su
perior line play and corresponding
Stanford injuries that made the dif
ference. Stanford lost the full use
of Gordon White in the first quar
ter. Pomeroy was to follow, as was
Gordon Rice. Rice suffered a broken
leg.
These injuries hurt. But the loss
of Wes Poulson, Chuck Ilokanson,
and the reinjury of Hal Walker left
Schwartz with only Rau and Dick
Gaedtke available for offensive
tackle duty. Don Lucas, who nid
played with the Braves in the pre
liminary, was pressed for varsity
duty.
So another Big Game is in the
books. The Axe remains with Cali
fornia for at least another year. The
coaches take to another banquet cir
cuit and the undergraduates >ay,
with more or less conviction, de
p< nding upon their knowledge of
the game, "Next year,"
