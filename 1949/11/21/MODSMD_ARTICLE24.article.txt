# No Classes Tomorrow??
## 
### 
It seems unfair to us that juniors, who will be
"excused" from classes for the next two morn
ings to take the Graduate Record Exam, must
make up the work they miss if the instructor
should decide that those classes will meet any
way.
To round up and copy the notes for as many
as six lectures is a lot of work, yet that's ex
actly what may happen to a lot of juniors whose
teachers refuse to dismiss classes.
The committees charged with setting up the
Graduate Record testing schedule ruled that all
those required to take the exam would be ex
cused from classes tomorrow and Wednesday
mornings, but nothing was said about whether
classes would be dismissed or not. This was
left to the option of the individual inslructors,
and rightfully so as they are in the best position
to know the relative number of juniors in their
classes and to judge the necessity of meeting
with their students on those two days.
It appears now, however, that an unex
pectedly large number of classes will meet
even though more than half the students regis
tered in them will be "excused" to take the
exam.

This idea of having to be in two places at
once doesn't make sense to us, and since the
results of the Graduate Record Exam will be
used to better the academic curriculum at
Stanford, it seems like discrimination against
the juniors to require them to make up their
classwork.
At least one professor has suggested that his
students take the makeup on the required exam
when it is given next week, but this is not
legally possible as petitions to take the makeup
were due in the Dean of Students' Office last
Wednesday.
We're not suggesting that teachers dismiss
all their classes, regardless of the number of
juniors involved, or the necessity for meeting
with the students on those two mornings. If an
instructor's lecture schedule is so crowded
that important material cannot possibly be pre
sented at a later date, then by all means the
class should meet.
But each professor should carefully review
his own situation and then decide whether to
dismiss or not accordingly.
Perhaps the number of sets of notes to be
copied can be cut from six to one or two.

way.
To round up and copy the notes for as many
as six lectures is a lot of work, yet that's ex
actly what may happen to a lot of juniors whose
teachers refuse to dismiss classes.
The committees charged with setting up the
Graduate Record testing schedule ruled that all
those required to take the exam would be ex
cused from classes tomorrow and Wednesday
mornings, but nothing was said about whether
classes would be dismissed or not. This was
left to the option of the individual inslructors,
and rightfully so as they are in the best position
to know the relative number of juniors in their
classes and to judge the necessity of meeting
with their students on those two days.
It appears now, however, that an unex
pectedly large number of classes will meet
even though more than half the students regis
tered in them will be "excused" to take the
exam.

This idea of having to be in two places at
once doesn't make sense to us, and since the
results of the Graduate Record Exam will be
used to better the academic curriculum at
Stanford, it seems like discrimination against
the juniors to require them to make up their
classwork.
At least one professor has suggested that his
students take the makeup on the required exam
when it is given next week, but this is not
legally possible as petitions to take the makeup
were due in the Dean of Students' Office last
Wednesday.
We're not suggesting that teachers dismiss
all their classes, regardless of the number of
juniors involved, or the necessity for meeting
with the students on those two mornings. If an
instructor's lecture schedule is so crowded
that important material cannot possibly be pre
sented at a later date, then by all means the
class should meet.
But each professor should carefully review
his own situation and then decide whether to
dismiss or not accordingly.
Perhaps the number of sets of notes to be
copied can be cut from six to one or two.
