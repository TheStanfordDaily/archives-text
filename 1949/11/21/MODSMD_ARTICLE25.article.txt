# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
"THE SADDEST WORDS I EVER DID HEAR
WERE THOSE THAT SAID, 'WAIT 'TIL NEXT
YEAR!
This was an original poem, originated by the author
at 3 a.m. Sunday in the St. Francis Hotel, room 727,
among several highly sympathetic friends, who were

also making up poems, among
other things. .
The saddest part of the whole
idea is that there are many of us
who will not be back to see it. Oh,
we might be able to buy a ticket
and sit in on it, but nothing will be
the same.
But, those persons who can af
ford to say such a tiling as WAIT
'TIL- NEXT YEAR might have a
point.
At that time, Stanford will have

seniors who as frosh never lost a game to USC, UCLA,
Santa Clara or California.
At that time, Stanford will have juniors who as
frosh never lost a game to USC, UCLA, Santa Clara,
or California.
At that time, Stanford will have sophomores who as
frosh never lost a game to USC, UCLA, Santa Clara,
or California.
I point this out for the benefit of those who keep
saying that Stanford lacks the horses, doesn't have the
material, or doesn't get enough athletes to match win
records with the above schools.
No reflection on the Big Game. Two good football
teams met last Saturday. One got red hot with a
crushing ground attack in the second half and one
got tired.

But, away from football. Have you ever been to a
Dcily stuffing party?
Th;.t question may be misleading. In the first place,
what I mean to really ask is not whether you have
ever been to a daily stuffing party because what I'm
talking akeut is not held every day. Also, you might
think that stuffing has something to do with Thanks
giving, and that certainly is not the case at this time.

But, that is neither here nor there. What I'm .trying
to talk about is a Daily, a daily newspaper, stuffing,
one paper into another, party.
Actually, it's an occasion when all the members of
The Daily staff get together about 4 a.m. in the morning
to put together a special edition such as came out last
Friday morning in honor of the Big Game.
Mostly, it's a bunch of people doing nothing, only at
this time, they all get together in the same room to
do it.
So, now with the background, let's start again. Ever
been to a Daily stuffing party? It's rather entertaining
in a crude sort of way. The first thought that comes
to mind upon attending is that you shouldn't have.
However, once you are there at four in the morning
it is silly to go home, so at least you are here.
Of course, that statement always raises a few jokes
from the jokers in the crowd because nobody is sure
whether you are really here or there. But, that isn't
as important as you may think.
The best thing about it is that lots of Bull Session
material is uncovered at such affairs. People make
jokes. Of course, as everybody knows, people have
done this since the Stone Age, or before that, for that
matter. For instance:
"I gotta gag for you," said one little frosh girl. "It's
aKout coffee."
"This coffee tastes like mud—it was ground this
morning," she said, as she started giggling a hysterical
sort of giggle.
"That's great," 1 said. "I've got a gag for you, too."
And I stuffed five spare Dailies down her throat.
Another joker walked up. "Here's a fresh slant for
you. Why not run a blank space with your picture in
the middle better yet, run the blank space in the
ccnter of your picture."
"Thanks," I said humbly, while all the time I wanted
to smash him in the face.
Oh well, all's fair. The main thing to remember in
attending a Daily stuffing party is to ' ■">ep a stiff upper
lip, a smile on your face, and a warm shirt on your
hack. This is also important if you are digging for
gold in Alaska.
