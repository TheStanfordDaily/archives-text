# CAMPUS OPINION
## Foreign Scholarships 
### 
To the Editor:
While still in the United States, I wish to express
my thanks and sincere appreciation to the organiza
tions and individuals whose efforts made possible the
Foreign Scholarship Plan of 1948-49 under which I
had the opportunity of studying at Stanford last, aca
demic year.
My thanks are addressed especially to the University
Administration, ASSU, lIR, and SIRO, who all worked
so hard to make the program a success and to the
three grand fraternities, Phi Delta Theta, Theta Xi,
and Chi Psi, who all took a really brotherly care of
my personal welfare. A better arrangement would
hardly have been possible and I feel that the frater
nity fellowship I enjoyed made an essential part of
of the satisfaction I felt during my stay at Stanford.
There are so many groups to thank for their co
operation: I agunita Club, Union Residence, Class of
'49, pills of Lathrop, Manzanita, and Hurlburt houses
(practically the whole Row!), and the Highly Learned
Ladies of Hilltop House (where I enjoyed so many good
dinners!). All the individual students of both sexes
who contributed to the enjoyment of my leisure ac
tivities may I t sure that I often remember them with
great warmth.
Though not any more among your gav crowds, I
expect to see many of you in my native Helsinki some
day, if not next summer so at least during the Olympic
Grime Festivities of 1952. Every Stanfordite is always
welcome to contact me at the address below. I par
ticularly expect to see my fraternity buddies with
their beer mugs in my fair home toWn. I for my part
will try to create some of the old atmosphere of

Dinah's though wo will have to do without good old
Melba.
Once more: Thank you, everyone!
With best wishes for the continuous success of the
Scholarship Plan,
Yours,
