To the Editor:
In reference to the letter to the editor, dated No
vember 16, on the subject of the Frosh Bonfire being a
fizzle and ditto the frosh class, I have something to
add if I may. It is this: 1 have just come from the
I onfire and the upperclassmen I know tell me it is
the biggest and the best that they have seen in three
years at Stanford. At the moment of this writing, it is
almost completed, 100 all in the space of two short
days.
1 would have written this yesterday when the sub
ject was a bit warmer, but I wanted to wait so that I
could say that this is THE BIGGEST AND BEST
BONFIRE YET, anil that misguided individual whose
opinion was that our class could very well be a flop
if conditions did not change may snuggle back into
his bearskin and rest his warped mind.
There has never been any doubt in any of our minds
that the Class of '53 is the greatest thing to hit Stan
ford since the Vow Boys in '33, so I hope that the upper
classes will not feel ashamed of their efforts in pre
vious y< ars when they are out there at the Big Game
rally witnessing our contribution.
We've got a damn good class and we are all proud
of it and the job it did.
