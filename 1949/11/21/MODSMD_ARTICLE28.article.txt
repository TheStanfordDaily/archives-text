# Irvine Studies Europe Crisis
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The apathy of France, the courage
of England .... these are the atti
tudes apparent in the rebuilding of
two great European nations today.
This is the opinion formed by Dr.
William Irvine, professor in the Eng
lish Department, who was in Eu
rope early this summer on sabbatical
leave.
"The English deeply feel the re
sponsibility which is theirs in the
present crisis to determine whether
England is to become a second-class
nation," Dr. Irvine observed. "They
have determination and the faith
that they will win.
"The French, on the other hand,
appear to have lost faith and hope in
the future of France," he said.
England Endures
The general feeling in England is
one of hanging on and enduring
hardship while the nation is getting
back on its feet. While one hears
scattered criticism, there is no wide
spread dir.content. Most Englishmen
seem to think the Socialists will win
the next election, and there is little
scapegoating, or feeling that a change
of administration v/ould cure every
thing.
Of the peopie Dr. Irvine talked to
during his stay in Great. Britain most
thought that the Labor government
was solid with the people principally
because of the socialized health pro
gram. The main objection to the
plan is that debtors are taking undue
advantage of it, reports the Laborite
organ, the New Statesman and Na
tion.
Rule Without Glamour
The Labor government does not
carry any glamor, however; Attlee,
for instance, does not have the per
sonal following and affection which
Churchill had.
A nation subsisting on a diet which
allows the weekly meat equivalent of
about one lamb chop per person,
feels that the devaluation of the
pound is necessary to give England
a momentary advantage in foreign
markets. The British realize that in
the long run this will mean a virtual
cut in wages, however, since prices
will rise and wages will remain the
same.
The problem which Great Britain
faces is to support her population
and still retain her prewar strength.
Most leaders say that to do this the
country will probably have to have
a permanent subsidy from the United
States. In the meantime, the British
are studying American production
techniques to modernize their indus
tries.
Empty Fields
The destruction in London was
greater than Dr. Irvine had expected.
Although most of the rubble has
been cleared away, large fields in
the heart of the city, such as those
around St. Paul's Cathedral, are a
constant reminder of the war.
While in London Dr. Irvine did
research at the imperial College of
Science on T. H. Huxley, the man
who defended Darwin against a hos
tile nineteenth century.
Irvine's book, "The Universe and
C.8.5.," the story of an unknown
Irishman who had a passion for re
form and became one of the world's
leading thinkers, was published this
month. This is the first full account
of George Bernard Shaw, whose
penetrating wit touched most con
temporary subjects.
Four years ago when Dr. Irvine
began writing the book, he sent the
first two chapters to Shaw. The ex
plosive footnotes which Shaw re
turned with the manuscript have
been incorporated into the book.
