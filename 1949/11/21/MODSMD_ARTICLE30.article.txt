# Frosh Thwart Cal Raiders; Paly High Gets Revenge
## Nine Bear Invaders Nabbed Friday By Radio-Equipped '53 Patrolmen 
### WALT MENNINGER 
The apprehension and shaving of nine more Cal raiders last
Friday morning after the rally climaxed the Big Game freshman
campus policing. The frosh tonsorial parlor in Encina lounge gave
its economical "all for nothing" haircuts to a total of 15 visitors
from Berkeley.

Much credit for the efficient guarding of the Farm goes to the

members of the .Stanford Radio Club i
who contributed their time and j
equipment. Aiding the frosh who
originally thought of the idea, the
club members first used handi-talk- !
ie units, and then 10 - meter fre
quency modulation Army surplus
radios.
Friday morning's raiders were j
captured on the Quad, and in front j
of (he Memorial Auditorium. One
group of i v ur intruders was seized
when they produced California stu
dent body cards as identification.
Wednesday night, scalpings by j
Paly High students were the evil J
that threatened the '53 guards. Two J
freshmen were trapped and shaved i
by 42 Paly High students in retali- j
ation for the accidental shaving of I
local high school students disturb
ing the campus earlier last week.
Lured into a trap, the two fresh
men in their car were converged on
by six carloads of Paly students. A
bumper was torn off the Stanford
car, a wrench thrown through the
door, and a fender was denied. The
captors next took the frosh to a rock
quarry where the barbering took
place.
While the freshmen were being j
scalped, Stanford student Norman j
Callaway had a unique adventure
with some Cal raiders. While he
was standing by the Village sign
at the end of Palm Drive, a beat-up
'39 Olds carrying five people pulled
up.
Though thinking it. odd that the I
only empty space was in the middle
of the rear seat, Callaway got, in. He
became quite suspicious when he
noticed a Cal sticker on the wind
shield, and he was sure they weren't
Stanford students when they got on
El Camino.
Callaway asked to get out at Ra
venswood Avenue, but his request
was denied. "Things are tough all
over, buddy," the ringleader replied. ;

"We were sent clown here to do you
guys some dirt, and we got thwarted
by all those motorized freshmen. We
gotta bring something back, and
you're it."
Taking few chances on losing
their prize, the kidnappers stopped
for no red lights. To calm the wor
ried Callaway, the invaders prom
ised a fine dinner at the Sigma Nti
house, and painted a rosy picture of
what awaited him at Berkeley.

Frosh in their guarding of the campus from Cal raids last week.
Using army surplus radios, the members of the Stanford Radio
Club operated the equipment. The central station was located at
Encina, and other radios were on the Quad, around Lake La
gunita, and in cruising cars.
