# Braves Overturn Ramblers On Last-Minute Pass Play
## Jayvees Overcome 21-point Deficit To Score Surprising 26 to 21 Triumph 
### 
All was not lost on that Black Saturday.
Coach Jim Cox's Stanford Braves gave the Red an even break
in the stadium's Saturday activities when they staged a game up
hill rally to defeat California's heavily favored Ramblers by a
score of 26 to 21.
They did it in true Big Game style by tallying the winning score

in the final minute of play. Quarter
back Jack Bickel and end Bob Scott,
who were the big guns for the
Braves all afternoon, climaxed the
stirring comeback with a six-yard
jump pass for the final touchdown.
Scott Stores Clincher
When Scott crossed the final
murker with the scoreboard clock
showing but 25 seconds' playing
time remaining, it placed the Ram
blers on the wrong end of a final
score for the first time since the
1947 Braves turned the trick two
years ago.
The winning drive was made pos
sible by a Rambler fumble on their
own 18-yard line with 90 seconds
left. Luke Phillips was the errant
Bear, anil Owen Powell the alert
Brave who pounced on the bounding
Madder.
Two line plunges moved the Jay
vees to Cal's 6-yard line. From
there, Bickel tossed to Scott for the
score.
Itamhlers Score Early
Things looked black indeed early
in the battle when the Ramblers
counted three rapid touchdowns in
the first ten minutes of the first
quarter, all on long passes.
But that ended the Ramblers'
walk in the sun for the day. The
vaunted Rambler attack was unable
to penetrate the Brave line after
the first five plays of the game, and
the rest of the story was all Stan
ford.
The Jayvees bounced back in the
second quarter on a Bickel - Scott
maneuver good for 20 yards and a
six-pointer. Powell booted the sev
enth, and it was 21 to 7 at the in
termission.
Pass Play Clicks
Again in the third period the
Braves drove successfully with
Bickel this time tossing the clincher
to halfback John Banks. The scor
ing play covered the final 28 yards
of the march.
Powell missed this time and the
score remained 21 to 13 until five
minutes- before the final gun. At
this point the Braves' Bill McKay
climaxed a 40-yard drive by gallop
ing over tackle and into the end
zone from H yards out.
Powell added his second conver
sion to move Stanford within one
point of their cross-bay rivals, and
that's the way it stood when the
Braves were handed their last-min
ute break.
Bickel and Scott were the offen
sive standouts for the Braves, with
Scott also turning in a creditable
defensive performance.
Line Play Excels
But it was the effective Brave line
play that spelled the real difference.
The play of guard Bernie Tokarz
was the- most notable, but the en
tire forward wall was impregnable
after the early moments.
Probably the most surprising per
formance was that of halfback Jerry
Odens, who is playing his first year
of organized football with the Jay
vee squad.
Saturday's win completes the
Brave schedule. The Jayvees lost
their first two games of the season,
then closed the year with four con
secutive wins.
