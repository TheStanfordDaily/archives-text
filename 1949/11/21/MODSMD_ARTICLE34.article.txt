# Bear Squad Joyful After Indian Tilt
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
You'd think they had just beaten
Notre Dame, those blue - shirted
Bears. They were a happy, howl
ing, hilarious bunch. And I guess
you couldn't blame them: they had
just proven (o themselves, and 90,000
others, that the 1949 California foot
ball team is one of the greatest
ever. . . .
The name of Bill Leiser was heard
over and over again as the Bears
clanked happily into their locker
room. "Guess that'll hold Leiser for
a while," was the most frequent
comment. . . .
Once inside, the victors were lav
ish with their cheers. We didn't
count the "hip, hip, hoorays" that
resounded from the cramped dress
ing room, but there must have been
at least one for every member of
the team. Pappy got three of them.
He also got the game ball from eo
captains Franz and Turner. It was
Waldorf's first game ball. . . .
Celeri Praises McColl
Both Pappy and Bob Celeri were
quick to state that Stanford was the
best team they had played all year.
Celeri was especially lavish in his
praise of Bill McColl, who played a
lot of tackle and a lot of end for
the Indians.
"That McColl is a hell of an end,"
is the way Cal's bootleg artist put
it."He finally tired late in the
second half after we had been run
ning over him all game. But who
wouldn't?"
Yes, who wouldn't? . . .
Blond Jackie Swaner, the "old
man" who wasn't supposed to be
very dangerous Saturday because of
a season-long knee injury, but who
shattered the Red line all afternoon
with his explosive line plunges, was
naturally enough a very happy boy.
Indians Tire
"That was my fourth Big Game,"
Swaner said, "and our first decisive
win in all that time. We were get
ting darn tired of those Stanford
moral victories. Stanford played a
good ball game, no question about
it, but I think they tired in the third
quarter."
That was a pretty safe state
ment. . . .
Happy Pappy could speak only of
his "game gang of kids" as he
chewed merrily at the tip of n
smallish stogie.
"You've got to hand it to that
gang," he chanted over and over.
"Things really looked tough at the
half. Brunk was through because of
a pulled leg muscle, Robison turned
up with a badly hurt hand, Van
Heuitt was suffering from a very
bad cold, and we were behind 7
to (J. I never saw such a game
rally." . . .
Fry Gets Credit
Much of the credit for that third
quarter splurge, according to Pappy,
is due to his backfield assistant, Wes
Fry.
"Wes suggested last week using
Jim (Monachino) at left half in case
anything happened to Brunk. It
really paid off today." . . .
The subject of Monachino was one
of Waldorf's favorites. "Jim has
played fullback, left half, and right
half at various times this season. In
fact, he's played at least two posi
tions in five different games." . . .
The ex-Northwestern mentor sin
gled out Russ Pomeroy, Al Rau, Bob
White, and Emery Mitchell as turn
ing in outstanding jobs for the
Cards.
"Also, I thought Horn directed
them nicely," he added. . . .
Bears Have Improved
But Pappy couldn't stay off the
subject of California for long.
"It's certainly been an interesting
season for us," he commented. "We
never thought we'd be going to the
Bowl. We definitely weren't a good
team at the start. But the defense
has picked up fine, and the kids
have really learned to block and
run.
And those tackles of ours have
been improving all year. Turner and
Cullom have done great jobs for
us." . . .
It was inevitable that someone
should ask the Bear coach to com
pare his current squad with his
Rose Bowlers of 1948.
"They're totally different teams.
Last year, the boys did things the
conventional way. This year, even I
don't know what's gonna happen
next.
"It's a funny thing, but we don't
seem to be able to gain 10 yards at
a time. We'll go along getting no
where, then all of a sudden some
body breaks loose for 80 yards."
But Pappy admitted that those 80-
yard runs didn't make him very
mad. . . .
