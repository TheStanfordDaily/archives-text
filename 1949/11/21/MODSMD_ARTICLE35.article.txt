# Monachino Spoils Card Victory Plan

### JOHN BREIER 
"Monachino!"
That was the first word Marchie
Schwartz uttered as he sat down to
face the usual after-game questions
by the sportswriters.
"Every time I looked up that
number 35 was doing something."
Schwartz said. "And by the way,"
he added, "that Cal outfit is a good
team â€” plenty of explosive power.
They never did run as well as they
did today."
"Just too much power up front,
just too much power."
Then he settled down to answer
the questions.
Cal, Michigan Even
"Cal against Michigan?" Well, if
Ca! played the way it did today it
would do u good job. Cal can match
Michigan in strength but the Michi
gan line is a little more active."
He said that Gary Kerkorian had
been injured a little but that he had
intended to use Dick Horn anyway.
"We wanted his long passing.
"We knew at half-time that, even
though we were leading, we would
have to score at least twice more.
We didn't, they did."
Schwartz Praises Fix
Schwartz paid tribute to Don Fix.
"That kid hadn't practiced all week,
yet he went out there and played
a whale of a game."
He singled out Ken Rose, A 1 Rau,
and Bill McColl for special mention.
In the dressing room the players
seemed to be trying to avoid the
many alums and friends who crowd
ed in to offer words of encourage
ment.
Some threw clothing and equip
ment in an effort to release pent-up
emotion. All were tired, those who
had played as well as those who had
not.
Some did not start to undress for
some time after entering the dress
ing room.
Honolulu Trip
Talk of the proposed trip to Ho
nolulu drifted about the room to
meet with varying opinions. More
than one player expressed dissatis
faction with the jaunt.
"That means we will have to stay
in shape for about six weeks more.
To hel! with it!" said one.
"Maybe it would be a good thing
for the kids," said one senior, "but
I don't want any part of it. I haven't
been home very much as it is."
To a man the Cards expressed re
spect for the Cal line and runners.
But most of them just shook their
heads and refused comment as to
specific players or plays.
The shock of the game score was
still with them.
