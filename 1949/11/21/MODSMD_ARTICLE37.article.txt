# Crowd Welcomes Ohio State Squad
## 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 20 (/P)â€”
Ohio State's Rose Bowl hopefuls
were welcomed back to Columbus
early today by the v/iklest, happiest
crowd to swarm over downtown
streets since V-J Day of World War
Two.
The Bucks will forget about foot
ball for the coming weeks before
starting preparations for the trip to
Pasadena in mid-December.
But, from the looks of things in
the downtown area this morning,
Columbus won't forget about it for
one second. Thousands and thou
sands of fans thronged the streets to
welcome home the first Buckeye
bowl candidates since ,1920.
A pre-season favorite, Minnesota,
shut out Ohio State, 27-0, but in the
next two games lost to both Michi
gan and Purdue. It was Ohio State's
only defeat.
