SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (£>)—
A post-season grid contest between
Sunta Clara and College of the Pa
cific was considered a likely possi
bility todnv.
The two teams would meet Sat
urday, December 10, at Kezar Sta
dium here and would be sponsored
by the San Francisco Press Club.
Proceeds of the game, above a
guarantee to each team, would go
to the Press Club's Journalism
Scholarship Fund for local high
school students.
President Robert E. Burns of
College of the Pacific indicated his
undefeated team with its outstand
ing quarterback, Eddie Le Baron,
would accept the challenge.
He said the team favors the game.
'"We want to play the strongest
team we can find in the nation. We
think Santa Clara is one of the
strongest," he said.
Santa Clara's Broncos were en
route home from their 28-21 defeat
at Oklahoma Saturday.
In Oklahoma City, a scout for the
Orange Bowl at Miami said after
the game that the Broncos might re
ceive a bid to play in the Orange
Bowl next New Year's.
Santa Clara was reportedly re
ceptive to a bid for the December 10
game but had hinged its acceptance
on the outcome of the Oklahoma
game.
Governor Earl Warren and San
Francisco Mayor Elmer Robinson
both expressed enthusiasm for the
contest and sportswriters predicted
it would mean a sellout for the
GO,OOO-seat stadium.
The game would match the COP
Tigers with their star, "Excellent
Eddie" Le Baron, against the Bron
cos and their talented halfback, Hall
Haynes.
