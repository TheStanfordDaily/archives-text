# Gaieties Crowd Sees Best Pre-Game Gag
## 
### 
I What may have been the cleverest
I stunt of Big Game festivities was
' carried out during the finale of
Thursday night's performance of the
Gaieties.
A large painted sign depicting a
Bear strangling an Indian was low
ered from the ceiling of Memorial
Auditorium directly over the au
dience amid a shower of blue and
gold confetti. Printed on the sign
was "With men who know football
best, it's Cal, 107-0."
The sign was dropped from a slot
in the ceiling above the edge of the
balcony originally designed for a
curtain which could be lowered to
divide the auditorium in two, but
whiqh is no longer used.
Several persons had climbed up
to the beams above the ceilings dur
ing the excitement of the finale and
had rigged up a system of strings
so that the sign and confetti could
be dropped from a safe distance.
The persons were at first identi
fied as Stanford students as they
were recognized when they left the
stage and lost themselves in the
audience following the show. But a
search uncovered a box from an
Oakland store which had contained
the materials, along with an enve
lope addressed to the editor of the
Daily Californian.
Since not many people know
about the existence of the slot in the
ceiling or how to get to it, it is
possible that the culprits were once
Stanford students. .
