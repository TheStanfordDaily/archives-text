# Health Committee Working on Plans For New Center
## 
### 
The Health Committee, which
works closely with the Health Serv
ice, has been making plans for a new
student Health Center. Kenneth
Cundy, chairman of the committee,
emphasized that there has been no
definite commitment on the part of
the University as yet. Plans arc still
in the formative stage, he said.
The committee has also investi
gated the causes of intramural sports
injuries which have been numerous.
The Health Committee is now work
ing on a plan to cut down the num
ber of injuries for next year, Cundy
explained.
Aiding him in this work arc Joan
Pomeroy, assistant chairman, and
Fred Warren, Portland Hollc, May
bell Zobcl, and Stan Dawson.
The Health Service has recently re
ceived a large amount of human
gamma globulin, a blood by-product
provided through the Pacific head
quarters of the American Red Cross
for a controlled study of infectious
mononucleosis.
This marks the first time that an
adequate large-scale study of the ad
ministering of this drug has been in
augurated.
Results may take at least one year
to give conclusive proof of the value
of this treatment. Therefore, no
definite information about human
gamma globulin can be made avail
able until then. Infectious mononu
cleosis is the chief time-losing dis
ease of young people of college age.
Dr. Houck, director of the Health
Service, has recently completed a
paper on infectious mononucleosis
which will be published in the next,
few weeks in the "American Journal
of Medicine," said Cundy.
