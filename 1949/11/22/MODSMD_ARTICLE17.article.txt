## Elections, Relief Drive On Agenda 
### 
Several proposed amendments to
election by-laws, designed to avoid
complications similar to those en
countered in this month's elections,
will be considered by Excom to
night. The meeting is ta 7:15 in the
Old Union.
Amendments were discussed last
week by Excom, but were tabled
and put into committee for further
consideration.
One problem was that of ille
gal electioneering. Alternatives dis
cussed last week included automatic
disqualification of the candidate,
disqualification if the electioneering
was done by friends but not if done
by some opponent, and lesser pun
ishments.
The other problem arose when
neither candidate for Men's Coun
cil got a majority in the final elec
tion because of the votes given the
several write-in candidates.
At present, if only two candidates
fie, they do not participate in the
primary, and there is no preferen
tial voting in the final election.
Excom will also consider which
organization or group should handle
the Stanford Relief Fund Drive next
fall.
This year the drive was handled
by SIRO, and resulted in confusion
of the drive as a SIRO drive. Ac
tually only 60 per cent of the money
raised goes to international relief
agencies.
