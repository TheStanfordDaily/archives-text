# Exams Will Be Given Juniors in Mem Aud Today and Tomorrow
## Tests Planned to Cover General Education of University Student 
### 
The Graduate Record Examination will be given to juniors this
morning and tomorrow from 8 to 12 in Memorial Auditorium.
Students who took all their lower division work at Stanford, or
who transferred at the beginning of this quarter are required to
take the test.
Those who took more than 20 units at another school and trans-

f ' erred to Stanford before this quar
ter do not have to take the exam.
Make-up tests will be given Dec. 2
and 3, from 1 to 5 p.m. the first day
and 8 to 12 the second. Only those
who petitioned may take the make
up.
The examination is one of gen
sral education, including general
lathematics, physical sciences, bio
ogical sciences, social studies, lit
rature, arts, effectiveness of expres
ion, and vocabulary.
A substantial background of
; knowledge is required for the test,
but on the whole there is no require
ment for remote and detailed infor
mation, Gary MilJs, of the Lower
Division office, said.
Since 1946, 45,000 students have
taken the exam, and in many uni
versities a full transcript of the score
is required for admission into gradu
ate school.
The fee is usually $10 for the test,
but Stanford is paying it here. Stu
dents may write to Educational Test
ing Service, 43"t West sDth street,
New York 19, for transcripts of their
I scores.
The main purpose for giving the
test, Mills said, is to gain some facts
j for future decisions concerning lower
| division.
Scores on the tests will be given
out when the results are correlated.
Those who have questions about
the exam should see Mills, in room
5, temporary building B, Lower Di
vision office.
