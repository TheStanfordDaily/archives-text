# Trustee Word Awaited On Eating Club Building
## 
### 
Word from the University's Board
of Trustees on the proposed new
building for the eating clubs will
probably await the beginning of
next quarter, according to Sarge
Littlehale, Interclub Council presi
dent.
L.ittlcha'e said the board failed to
discuss the question at their No
vember meeing, and that it would
probably come up at the meeting
next month.
Thice weeks ago the combined
clubs presented a "Supplementary
Report oji Proposed Eating Club
Buildings at Stanford University"
to Dr. Wallace Sterling, University
president.
Dr. Sterling promised at the time
to Rive the report careful consider
ation and present it to the board for
further action.
Right now, Littlehale said, the
report is "at the level where it has
to be discussed by the Board of
Trustees" before the clubs can go
ahead with any plans.
As presented three weeks ago, the
report called for an L-shaped build
ing complete with separate kitchen,
dining, and operational facilities for
each club. Location of the building i
was not specified although a tenta
tive estimate of cost was set at
$135,000. The building would not
provide living quarters for club
members.

The report was prepared last,
summer under the direction of Wil
liam H. McPherson, chairman of the
executive board of the Eating Club
Building Committee.
