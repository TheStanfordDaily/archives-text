# So That It Won't Happen Again
## 
### 
By now the results of the Stanford Fall Relief
Drive have become a matter of concern to a
good many persons and organizations on cam
pus.
The goal was fixed at $12,000. In two full
weeks, SIRO, the organization charged with
conducting the drive, was not able to collect
more than a quarter of this amount. SIRO's for
eign committments will not be met; the Stan
ford YWCA's budget is in danger; Women's
Row Excorn is up in arms because the job of
collecting money on the Row was thrown in
its lap without any instructions as to the pur
poses of the drive or methods of collecting.
Something was wrong, and now is the time
to evaluate the drive so that the same mistakes
won't be made next year.
A special committee of Excom met to discuss
the problem yesterday afternoon and will re
port its findings to Excom tonight. Included in
the report will be the following points:
1. The Drive should be conducted by an or
ganization not financially interested in the die
bursement of the proceeds. Because the drive
was conducted for the ASSU by the Stanford
international Relief Organization, many per
sons got an erroneous impression that it was
solely a SIRO drive for international relief, and
if they were not interested in international re
lief they did not contribute. It is felt by the

committee that Cardinals should conduct the
drive just as it runs the Red Cross and Con
Home Drives and that the organizational work
should be done by a committee headed by a
Cardinals member.
2. The major emphasis of the drive should
be on living group collections. Making stu
dents dig up guarters for tags, nickels for
Dailies, and dimes for dinners day after day
creates more ill-will than the small amount of
money so collected will justify. Students who
know that they will be hit only once or twice
during the drive will contribute much more
willingly. However, the Student-Faculty Talent
Show is telt to be a worthwhile project, and
should be continued.
3. Living group contributions lagged be
cause collectors were not properly oriented be
fore they started. Many of them had no idea
of what the money collected was to be used
for, and as a result they took no interest in their
work. Their collections showed it.
4. The actual goal for the drive was approxi
mately $B,OG(J, but a higher figure was an
nounced for the psychological effect. This is
ridiculous.
5. Under no conditions should the drive last
more than one week. The last two drives have
been extended into a second week, but this
extra time is not felt to be needed.
