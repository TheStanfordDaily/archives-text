# Orchids instead of Roses
## 
### 
Now we have nothing in common with the
sons of the Blue and Gold except that we are
both students at California universities, but the
boisterous, obnoxious conduct of the California
rooting section Saturday made us wish we
could crawl into a corner and hide until the
whole thing was over.
Press box seats are ordinarily considered to
be the best in the house, but after 10 minutes
behind that rooting section we would have
been glad to swap ours for one down near the
tunnel where the 220-yard dash is started.
It has always amazed us that persons of col
lege age would act the way Cal rooters are
noted for acting, but that's neither here nor
there right now.
What particularly annoyed us was the tre
mendous amoujnt of verbal abuse given Chron
icle Sports Editor Bill Leiser for his prediction
that Stanford would win the game by 10 points.
A newspaperman should be subject to a cer
tain amount of criticism for what he puts in
print, but certainly not of the kind handed out
by the Cal rooters Saturday.
The California yell leaders began the after
noon by suggesting that Leiser had no father,
and the gangsters that cheer for Cal took it
from there. All this, mind you, was in the pres
ence of a number of women in upper stands
and in the press box.
Leiser's Chronicle colleague, Will Connolly,
commented on the incident and said that the

ribbing wasn't vicious; that Cal won and every
body on this side felt generous and forgiving.
That's not the way we heard it. but we're glad
Leiser isn't holding a grudge. A lesser man
might not have written such a fair story of the
day's happenings as he did.
* + *
The Stanford yells were terrific Saturday, as
were the card stunts and Band formations. As
a matter of fact, the whole weekend was a
roaring success —except for the game itself.
The Gaieties, the float parade, the Big Game
rally, and the house decorations are the best
that we have seen in four years at Stanford.
The student body should take a bow for an out
standing job,
* * *
More orchids are due the freshman class for
their part in guarding the campus and building
the bonfire. To our knowledge, not a bit of
damage was done by Cal raiders. The enthus
iasm shown by the members of the class of '53
in fulfilling their task proves that the prewar
spirit of freshman class unity is returning.

In giving credit for fine work on The Daily's
Big Game Edition last Friday, we failed to men
tion the name of our cartoonist, Bud Edwards.
Bud's work will long be remembered as one of
the highlights of Volume 116 of The Daily.
Thanks a million.

In giving credit for fine work on The Daily's
Big Game Edition last Friday, we failed to men

Bud's work will long be remembered as one of
the highlights of Volume 116 of The Daily.
Thanks a million.
Now we have nothing in common with the
sons of the Blue and Gold except that we are
both students at California universities, but the
boisterous, obnoxious conduct of the California
rooting section Saturday made us wish we
could crawl into a corner and hide until the
whole thing was over.
Press box seats are ordinarily considered to
be the best in the house, but after 10 minutes
behind that rooting section we would have
been glad to swap ours for one down near the
tunnel where the 220-yard dash is started.
It has always amazed us that persons of col
lege age would act the way Cal rooters are
noted for acting, but that's neither here nor
there right now.
What particularly annoyed us was the tre
mendous amoujnt of verbal abuse given Chron
icle Sports Editor Bill Leiser for his prediction
that Stanford would win the game by 10 points.
A newspaperman should be subject to a cer
tain amount of criticism for what he puts in
print, but certainly not of the kind handed out
by the Cal rooters Saturday.
The California yell leaders began the after
noon by suggesting that Leiser had no father,
and the gangsters that cheer for Cal took it
from there. All this, mind you, was in the pres
ence of a number of women in upper stands
and in the press box.
Leiser's Chronicle colleague, Will Connolly,
commented on the incident and said that the

ribbing wasn't vicious; that Cal won and every
body on this side felt generous and forgiving.
That's not the way we heard it. but we're glad
Leiser isn't holding a grudge. A lesser man
might not have written such a fair story of the
day's happenings as he did.

The Stanford yells were terrific Saturday, as
were the card stunts and Band formations. As
a matter of fact, the whole weekend was a
roaring success —except for the game itself.
The Gaieties, the float parade, the Big Game
rally, and the house decorations are the best
that we have seen in four years at Stanford.
The student body should take a bow for an out
standing job,
