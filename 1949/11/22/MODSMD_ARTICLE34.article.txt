# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
The firit time I saw Frankie Laine lie was singing in
a two-bit dive called Eddie's Oasis in tlie worn-out
southwest sector of Los Angeles. That was two years

a g°.
Laine was great, lie sang in
the smoke in the middle of a
crowded room and he was great.
And he was ugly. His nose was
too long, and his head was too
bald, and the rest of him didn't
look much better. But, he could
sing, and he put over a sorig like
nobody's business.
His paycheck couldn't have
been very large because if it had
Lcen, he would have been singing
some place else. But whether it

was for peanuts or plenty, Laine put his all into every
song. That was his style.
The last time I saw Frank ie Laine he was singing
in the plushy Venetian Room in San Francisco's finest
bar hotel, the Fairmont. That was one week ago.
Laine was different. He sang in the middle of a big
distinguished looking room and he was different. He
wore a toupee that improved his looks, and his suit
was right out of Esquire. And his singing sounded ,

like it. It was still plenty good, but in the Venetian
Room, it wasn't, quite sincere enough.
But Frankie can afford to relax. For one week's
work at the Fairmont he picked up four thousand
bucks, and that was only because the Venetian Room
had signed him a year in advance before ''That
Lucky Old Sun" and "Mule Train" hit the market.
Originally, Laine made the jump from the tramp
circuit to plush because of a Iresh rendition ol a
terrific song called "That's My Desire." When the
Mercury record of that number was released, P rankie
Laine was made overnight. But, he stayed with the
smoke for quite a spell.
During that period he turned out "Shine," "Black
and Blue," "By the River S iinte Marie," and "Sunday
Kind of Love," all smoke music and good enough to
carry him to one of the top positions among the na
tion's male vocalists.
At the present time his recording of "Lucky Old
Sun" is the best-selling record in the nation, and
"Mule Train" is already among the top 10.
So, Laine can afford to relax. People like his voice.
'I hey like his records—and justly so. He still puts
a lot of stuff into his work.
But his singing now lacks that sincerity that comes
from working for peanuts in a smoke-filled crowd.
I just thought you might like to know.
