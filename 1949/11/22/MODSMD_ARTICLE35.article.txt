To the Editor:
Perhaps you have been in ,a position where you
have borrowed romething, and intending to return
it, find the borrowed object is missing. Approaching
the original owner is not an enjoyable task.
The Breakers Eating Club is in such a position this
morning. The bell from our float, "Pasadena Special,"
was disengaged from the float while the latter was
parked in the lot adjoining the Chemistry Building
last Friday night.
We would deeply appreciate it if the party now in
possession of the bell, having had three days of ring
ing ecstasy, would contact me so that we might return
the hell to its rightful owners.
