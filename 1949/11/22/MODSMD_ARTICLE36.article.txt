# Cal-C.O.P. Game
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Conference policy frowns upon a California-COP
pos!-season game? That's too bad, because after losing
to Stanford Saturday, and COP on December 3, the
Conference would probably look a lot different.
The Chronicle is right! A school the size of Cal
should have a spirit at least as big as its student body.
They ought to play COP in the interests of good sports
manship, even if it means defying Conference policy,
ruining their record, and dropping a chance for the
Uose Bowl.
After all, isn't college football still an amateur
spoil?
