# Acting Poor, Plot Sordid In 'Beyond the Forest'
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Amidst the tangled underbrush
in "Beyond the Forest" are a mur
der, a suicide, an illicit love affair,
and an attempted abortion. Warner
Brothers, in trying to get exciting
climax from this sordid mess, has
failed dismally. The forest in the
film resembles splintered toothpicks.
The stars who have lost their way
among the toothpicks do not aid the

driveling inani
ties of a plot
about "those evil
ones who end up
112 like the Scor
f pi on, in mad
fury stinging
theins e Iv e s

to eternal death."
Bette Davis, a messy neurotic with
a persistently whiny voice and cu
riously contorted facial expressions,
seems bent on portraying "an evil
woman" by making herself as ugly
as possible externally and attempt
ing little characterization.
A shot of caffeine might have
livened up the emotionless mumblng
of Joseph Cotten, her long-suffer
ing, good-lellow husband. To the
audience the most interesting ques-

tion the picture raises is not if Bette
is to pay for her sins but why the
devil Cotten ever married her.
David Brian, as the lover who left
school in the second grade and is a
millionaire in spite of it, manages to
inject some energy into his portrayal
but appears more spoiled than .stub
born. The other characters are
tossed into Miss Davis' life seeming
ly just to prove by their goodness
how bad she Is.
The most surprising thing about
"Eeyond the Forest" is the quality
of the photography. In spots it al
most lifts the scrubby plot to the
level of exciting melodrama. In Chi
cago, when Bette Davis has refused
money from her lover, the camera
turns her Might through the bars
and streets of the city into a breath
less, climactic live minutes.
Unfortunately, nothing could save
a film in which a dramatic punch
line is "You're something for the
birds, Rosa, something for the
birds," repeated three times.
