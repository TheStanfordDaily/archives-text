# Cagers Grab Spotlight; Season Opens December 1
## Dean Narrows Squad to Twenty-five As Cards Practice Fast-Break Game 
### JOHN HALL 
the boys who bounce the leather balloons and run around im
modestly in short pants will step into the campus limelight during
the next eight days as they prepare for their December 1 basket
ball opener against College of Pacific.
t ast-break scrimmages will be the order of the day during this

eight - day period, with Headman
Everett Dean and first mate Boh
Burnett continuing to sort the men
from the boys.
This narrowing-down process has
been taking place since November 1
when the Pavilion doors first swung
open for the beginning of practice
with 47 candidates on hand.
The original turnout has now
been reduced to 25, and the var
sity is stepping on the gas.
Fast Break
Dean will use a different style of
attack this season. Alter losing Dave
Davidson, Bill Stephenson, and Bob
Lewis, he decided to junk his for
mer slow-break system and employ
a strict speed offense.
So far in practice that has meant
extra work for Gus Chavalas, Jack
O'Sullivan, and Jim Walsh, who ap
pear to be the ablest in getting down
court like a Mel Pattun.
Chavalas will bo used as the im
portant center man in the swift and
speed methods, and he will be pass
ing off to such men as Walsh, Marv

Gelber, and Bruce Iverson, all good
fast-break men.
George Yardley, Stanford's con
tender for all-coast honors this sea
son, will probably be used as a trail
er in the last break, and as a guard
on defense. When the fast break
1 doesn't work. Yardley will switch
I spots with Chavalas and back to
! Ins regular forward spot.
Twice (he Distance
That means that George will have
to cover twice the distance on de
fense, and that factor stands out as
being one of the big question marks
as to the success of Dean's new ma
: chine. If Yardley can handle all this
| extra duty and continue to maintain
! his high scoring offensive ability, it
will be a step in the right direction.
Another important part of the
bieak will be built around centers
Ralph Carver and Jim Ramstead,
who must get up on the boards to
get the hall and make that all-im
portant first pass out.
The offense should work like this:
Stanford's on defense, say with Gel
ber and Yardley at guards, Carver
at center, and Chavalas and Walsh
at forwards.
Gus Gallops
Carver goes up on the backboard
for the ball, gets it and in one mo
tion hooks it out to Chavalas at the
edge of the key. Chavalas dribbles
full speed, which he can do with the
best, and roars into the opposite end
of the court. Right with him on dif
ferent sides are Walsh and Gelber,
giving Stanford a 3 on 2 situation.
Chavalas then stops at the foul
line, and when one of the defenders
challenges him, he passes off to the
vacated territory, say to Gelber, who
lays the ball in the bucket, and
Stanford gets a big two. Of course,
there are several ariations.
But that's the way it works, or at
!east that is the way it is supposed
to work.
If the Cards can make this speed
stuff click, and key men Yardley,
Chavalas, and Gelber keep intact for
the whole season, Everett Dean will
have himself a good hustling ball
club and another contender for the
Southern Division crown.

with 47 candidates on hand.
The original turnout has now
been reduced to 25, and the var
sity is stepping on the gas.
Fast Break
Dean will use a different style of
attack this season. Alter losing Dave
Davidson, Bill Stephenson, and Bob
Lewis, he decided to junk his for
mer slow-break system and employ
a strict speed offense.
So far in practice that has meant
extra work for Gus Chavalas, Jack
O'Sullivan, and Jim Walsh, who ap
pear to be the ablest in getting down
court like a Mel Pattun.
Chavalas will bo used as the im
portant center man in the swift and
speed methods, and he will be pass
ing off to such men as Walsh, Marv

Gelber, and Bruce Iverson, all good
fast-break men.
George Yardley, Stanford's con
tender for all-coast honors this sea
son, will probably be used as a trail
er in the last break, and as a guard
on defense. When the fast break
1 doesn't work. Yardley will switch
I spots with Chavalas and back to
! Ins regular forward spot.
Twice (he Distance
That means that George will have
to cover twice the distance on de
fense, and that factor stands out as
being one of the big question marks
as to the success of Dean's new ma
: chine. If Yardley can handle all this
| extra duty and continue to maintain
! his high scoring offensive ability, it
will be a step in the right direction.
Another important part of the
bieak will be built around centers
Ralph Carver and Jim Ramstead,
who must get up on the boards to
get the hall and make that all-im
portant first pass out.
The offense should work like this:
Stanford's on defense, say with Gel
ber and Yardley at guards, Carver
at center, and Chavalas and Walsh
at forwards.
Gus Gallops
Carver goes up on the backboard
for the ball, gets it and in one mo
tion hooks it out to Chavalas at the
edge of the key. Chavalas dribbles
full speed, which he can do with the
best, and roars into the opposite end
of the court. Right with him on dif
ferent sides are Walsh and Gelber,
giving Stanford a 3 on 2 situation.
Chavalas then stops at the foul
line, and when one of the defenders
challenges him, he passes off to the
vacated territory, say to Gelber, who
lays the ball in the bucket, and
Stanford gets a big two. Of course,
there are several ariations.
But that's the way it works, or at
!east that is the way it is supposed
to work.
If the Cards can make this speed
stuff click, and key men Yardley,
Chavalas, and Gelber keep intact for
the whole season, Everett Dean will
have himself a good hustling ball
club and another contender for the
Southern Division crown.
the boys who bounce the leather balloons and run around im
modestly in short pants will step into the campus limelight during
the next eight days as they prepare for their December 1 basket
ball opener against College of Pacific.
t ast-break scrimmages will be the order of the day during this

eight - day period, with Headman
Everett Dean and first mate Boh
Burnett continuing to sort the men
from the boys.
