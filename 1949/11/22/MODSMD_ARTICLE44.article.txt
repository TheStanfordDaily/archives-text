There are many sad memories from Saturday last, hut to mo the sad
dest of all is that of seeing Ken Rose, Kupe Andrews, and Hill DeYoung
out there for the last time.
I've seen many seniors in their last game, and many are the times that
I've wished they had one more season. But never has the loss of men such
as these been so disheartening.
I can't help but feel that these three guys were only beginning, only
getting started in the game of football. All three came from junior colleges.
All three played but two years for Stanford. All three are of All-Coast or
better caliber.
The loss of men such as Emery Mitchell and Jim Castagnoli will probably
hurt more than the loss of Rose, Andrews, and DeYoung. But the latter
just don't seem to have reached their peak.
The postwar football scene was a strange one, to say the least. All five
of the above men came to Stanford from junior colleges. All five were
stars for the Cards. Inference?
But the JC's aren't coming through with players as before. The veteran
enrollment is down and the better preps are being rushed by th.e colleges.
From now on it is up to the freshmen. In fact, that was true this season.
So, where do we go from here? (Probably to Hawaii.)
Changes in Order
One thing I will say. Stanford will not win consistently against major
competition until some changes are made in the coaching psychology.
Stanford is going to depend more and more on sophs for line material
from here on out. Chuck Taylor handles the boys only one year. It is up
to someone else to take over after that.
And this is where the rub rubs.
Stanford lost to Michigan, California, and tied Santa Clara this year.
Toss out the UCLA game. It was a fluke.
And why did we lose to those teams? Superior lino play, nothing else.
And when the season is over and we look back, who are the stars? Back
field men, and an end or two.
It is an unhealthy situation at best. We lost every time we meet a team
with a rough line.
And next year? A starting offensive end, tackle, center, guard are lost.
Add two good defensive ends, a defensive tackle, and several good subs
and the picture isn't too bright.
Granted that Cal has more "horses." (Yes, John, horses.) Why is it
that year in and year out the Bears come through with superior lines?
Good coaching is the cause. They are taught to play the game as it should
be played—rough and tough, hurt the other guy, honestly, but get him
out of the game.
And who had all the line injuries on Saturday last? Stanford, of course.
Cal Line Great
I had seen the Cal-Oregon game when I wrote this column last week.
I tried to say, in a roundabout way, that Cal had just too much for the
Cards. There was a chance that Stanford could win, but just how I couldn't
foresee.
That Cal line was a splendid machine. It got off on or before the ball
every time. It did so again last week, much to the woe of Stanford. It will
do so next year, even if the Bears lose every lineman. That's the kind of
oiganization Pappy has over there.
Now is as good a time as ever to tip the lid to ol' Pappy. He's tops on
the Coast. He suffered greater losses than the 1947 Stanford team and
came up with a winner. Granted again, he has more to draw from, but
he does come up with a winner.
How does he do it? Superior staff work is my guess.
It is my opinion that Marchie Schwartz is as good a coach as any on
the Coast—as an individual. lie doesn't have the staff that Waldorf has.
A line coach has to be good. His boys have to like him and want to play j
for him. Chuck Taylor and Jim Cox are prime examples of this type of
coach.
Many is the time I've seen the Jayvees and Frosh come over and scrim- |
mage the Jim and Chuck are right in there working with their j
boys. And they put up a darn good fight. They stop the varsity line for j
two or three plays until the bigger and more experienced boys finally !
break through for a long run. Then, they stop them again for a while.
Not So With Varsity
Unfortunately, this is not the case with the varsity. Sure, they looked 1
good against the Trojans; scored a couple of quick TD's and then hung on !
as the Trojans pushed them around.
This column today isn't something that is a spur-of-the-moment piecc.
I wrote it in the middle of the season and then did not publish it. We
still had a chance to move on and win. It would only have divided the
team and started trouble.
It won't start trouble now. Marchie Schwartz is a loyal man. That is
only one of the qualities that you must admire about him. He will be the
last to go out and get a line coach who can fire up his boys and produce
the kind of line that is needed to win if you are going to play Army, j
Michigan, California, not to mention USC and UCLA.
This is probably one of the last columns that I will write about football, j
I had hoped I would never have to write it. But I now know that Stanford j
will continue to be a second-rate team until certain changes are made. I
I think it is evident what changes I mean.
The above is a personal opinion. It must be taken as such. I've been
closely associated with the team for three years, and this is one thing I
am sure of.
As a further check, ask the players.
