# Group Plans Co-op House
## 
### HOPE JOHNSON 
Alpha Phi Omega, Stanford serv
ice fratertiity, has taken a concrete
step to improve housing conditions
for ofT-campus students. The proj
ect was planned on a "co-operative"
basis, its aim being to obtain a co
op house on campus at minimum
expense.
Chairman of the co-op project was
Bill Gullikson, and committee mem
bers were Barry Mosher, Gene
Thomson, and Hailcy Clcwc.
Last year Gullikson with the aid
of the committee members visited
Cal where an elaborate co-op sys
tem is in existence. After inquiring
at one typical co-op house they
found that the average cost of room
and board was $35 a month plus a
few hours of work a week. The
committcc then approached Dean
Kimpton and President Sterling,
who were highly in favor of the
project itself. They also encouraged
the idea of having a co-op house on
campus. However, due to crowded
conditions, it seems impossible at
the present time.
Alpha Phi Omega has succeeded
in establishing the "Zcta Co-op
House" off-campus and will contin
ue operation, if successful, in fu
ture years. Expenses arc now about
$50 a month per student including

room and board. Eating arrange
ments are such that one dinner a
day is prepared by a cook while the
other meals are prepared individu
ally by the students.
Work is divided between a man
ager, cook, and food-buyer, with
others helping with kitchen duty.
