# SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
## Monteux Captivates With Berlioz, Strauss 
### JACK LITTLE 
Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony, something less
than encouraged by the sight of
gaping vacancies in the orchestra
scats, presented the first of three
scheduled concerts last night in the
Memorial Auditorium.
Fortunately, the chilling effect of
unoccupied seats was reflected only
in the opening bars of the overture,
"The Roman Carnival" by Berlioz,
and the first slow surveyal of the
audience by Monteux, bringing a
squirm of something akin to embar
rassment to the symphony-goers as
the conductor's gaze hesitated on
the vacancies.
The San Francisco Symphony, al
ways magnificent, presented one of
the finest concerts it has ever be
stowed upon Stanford, and the au
dience, pei haps apologizing for it
self, was soundly appreciative.
"The Roman Carnival," the prelude
to the second act of Berlioz' opera
"Benvenuto Cellini," carried the
concert-lovers well into the web of
fascination that Monteux' superb
conducting so (lawlessly weaves.
The opening theme, stated by the
English horn, is one of Cellini's love
songs in the opera, moving into the
second and final theme, a gay,
whirling blend of color taken from
llie Roman Carnival theme in the
second act of the opera, ended on a
level of gamboling festivity that
found Montuex the complete master
of bis audience.
"Concerto for Violin and Orches
tra, in D Major," Opus 77, hy
Brahms, found conccrtmastcr Naoum
Blinder filling every requirement of
a master in the role of soloist. His
tremendous stature as a violinist
was repeatedly acclaimed by an
ovation which returned him again
and again to the stage.

Claude Debussy's "Iberia" was
presented with great, sensitivity by
the San Francisco Symphony. Its
three parts, "In the Streets and by
the Wayside," "The Odors of Night,"
and"The Morning of a Festival
Day" are best described in the
words of Manuel de Fa'la: "Echoes
of the villages . . . seems to float
in a crystalline atmosphere filled
with scintillant sunshine; the intox
icating magic of Andalusian nights,
the gaiety of people on a holiday
marching and dancing . . . our imag
ination, constantly stimulated, is en
chanted by the intense expressive
ness and rich shading of this power
ful music."
The concert reached a sweeping,
powerful climax with "Death and
Transfiguration" by Richard Strauss,
rich'y interpreted by San Fran
cisco's beloved conductor.
As usual, the orchestra was strik
ingly set off by a background of
grimy, stained, thrown - together
sections of cardboard.

As usual, the orchestra was strik
ingly set off by a background of
grimy, stained, thrown - together
sections of cardboard.
Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony, something less
than encouraged by the sight of
gaping vacancies in the orchestra
scats, presented the first of three
scheduled concerts last night in the
Memorial Auditorium.
Fortunately, the chilling effect of
unoccupied seats was reflected only
in the opening bars of the overture,
"The Roman Carnival" by Berlioz,
and the first slow surveyal of the
audience by Monteux, bringing a
squirm of something akin to embar
rassment to the symphony-goers as
the conductor's gaze hesitated on
the vacancies.
The San Francisco Symphony, al
ways magnificent, presented one of
the finest concerts it has ever be
stowed upon Stanford, and the au
dience, pei haps apologizing for it
self, was soundly appreciative.
"The Roman Carnival," the prelude
to the second act of Berlioz' opera
"Benvenuto Cellini," carried the
concert-lovers well into the web of
fascination that Monteux' superb
conducting so (lawlessly weaves.
The opening theme, stated by the
English horn, is one of Cellini's love
songs in the opera, moving into the
second and final theme, a gay,
whirling blend of color taken from
llie Roman Carnival theme in the
second act of the opera, ended on a
level of gamboling festivity that
found Montuex the complete master
of bis audience.
"Concerto for Violin and Orches
tra, in D Major," Opus 77, hy
Brahms, found conccrtmastcr Naoum
Blinder filling every requirement of
a master in the role of soloist. His
tremendous stature as a violinist
was repeatedly acclaimed by an
ovation which returned him again
and again to the stage.

Claude Debussy's "Iberia" was
presented with great, sensitivity by
the San Francisco Symphony. Its
three parts, "In the Streets and by
the Wayside," "The Odors of Night,"
and"The Morning of a Festival
Day" are best described in the
words of Manuel de Fa'la: "Echoes
of the villages . . . seems to float
in a crystalline atmosphere filled
with scintillant sunshine; the intox
icating magic of Andalusian nights,
the gaiety of people on a holiday
marching and dancing . . . our imag
ination, constantly stimulated, is en
chanted by the intense expressive
ness and rich shading of this power
ful music."
The concert reached a sweeping,
powerful climax with "Death and
Transfiguration" by Richard Strauss,
rich'y interpreted by San Fran
cisco's beloved conductor.
