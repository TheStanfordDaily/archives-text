# J. Arthur Rank's "Red Shoes" Rated Second Only to "Hamlet"
## 
### AL BERRY 
If I awience Olivier hail not hren
io gracious as to make "liamlct,"
'The Keel Shoes"—now at the Park
wolilH easily have heen the best mo
tion picture of last year. There are

some wlu> think it
whs, anyway.
Once or twice,
perhaps, in ;i st i inn
of decade's does a
reviewer find a
picture that is
worth all (lie lin -
adjectives he
can throw at it.
31 eat, magnificent,
wo n (Ie r I ii I.and

whatever else Mr, Roget can I rid to
refer In the few things in the world 1
that are better than good. "The Ker!
Shoes" is cue of those iackpot.s.
Sometimes a picture is good enter
tainment, and occasionally it is a j
pretty , wonderful experience. "The
Red Shoes" is that, too.
In short, we liked the picture.
Warmly Human
The story tells ol a slim, red-headed
girl with glorious blue eyes who j
wants to dance—to be the world's
greatest ballerina. She wants to j
prove to the world and to herself that
she has that certain spark of great
ness that makes an artist great and

i! I other.'; merely imitators.
The fact that she is eventually .suc
cessful is only pari of the story. There
arc those who guide her, those who
love her, and those who admire her,
and all of them mingle into the movie
in such a way that few of lis who
have seen it can think of it. as just
a movie.
High point of this picture is the
ballet, ilself the dance of the Red
Shoes. Any breathless superlative
would seem trite in trying to de
scribe it. 'lhc music, which is di
rected by Sir Thomas Beecham, is
not of the type you will go away
humming. Ratlicr, it adds to yet
blends into the crescendo of sound,
color, and beauty that is "lite Red
Shoes.
Spontaneous Acclaim
One of the best tributes that can
lie paid to this particular sequence
occurs spontaneously every night at
the Park Theater. Although the bal
let. occurs in the middle of the pic
ture, the audience—every night since
its first showing- has burst into ap
plause at the completion of it, just
as though the cast were actually there
on the stage taking bows. It is that
good, it is that powerful.
The very fact that the picture deals
with ballet is likely to frighten away
a few of the more rabid sport fans,

who like myself- are prone to think
of ballet, in the same light as modern
art, stamp collecting, and Wagne:
symphonies. But if ballet in the
flesh is like it. is in celluloid, maybe
the long-hairs have got something
and how do you get to be one?
Superb Acting
The names of the cast, won't mear
much to the typical non ballet-lov
ing American screen patron unti
after they see the picture. Then |he\
may mean a great deal. Ballerina
Moira Shearer does an unbelievably
wonderful job portraying the girl who
wants to dance. Anton Walbrook, one
of Britain's top performers, is terri
fyingly great as the man who guide. l
her destinies. And to complete the
triangle is Marios Goring, who ha.
been connected with nearly everj
other top-ranking J. Arthur Rank
production since the war. The sup
poi ting cast is composed of tin
world's leading ballet-ers, and
oddly enough couldn't be better.
The photography and color arc
verging on the indescribable. Aik
we've plumb run out of adjectives
anyway. The picture is tops, so g<
see it, and then you, too, will realize
why we have had so much trouble
reviewing it. Just what can you say
about a picture this good?
