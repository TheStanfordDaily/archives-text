# Excom Rules Primary Elections Mandatory
## Electioneering Amendment Tabled As Discussion Reaches Stalemate 
### 
All candidates will compete in a primary election in the future,
even if only two or three persons file for the office, Excom decided
last night.
If any candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in the
primary, which will not be preferential, he will win the election

♦at that time. Otherwise, a final elec
tion will be held on the preferential
system for the top four, or less, can
didates.
After an extended discussion, an
amendment designed to curb illegal
electioneering was tabled until next
week. Maximum penalties of 22 hours
at the Con Home for a candidate who
campaigned illegally, and 15 hours
for some other person who admitted
having electioneered illegally without
the candidate's consent, were con
sidered.
Excom also considered disqualifica
tion of the candidate in flagrant cases.
Marv Tincher, Daily business man
ager, remarked that Excom seemed
to be missing the basic point on elec
tioneering.
The emphasis should be on effective
policing of the campus, he said, not
on the punishment of the candidate
at some later date. Campaign sign.)
must be seen to be effective, he added,
and the trouble can be largely cor
rected at the outset if the signs are
; quickly taken down.
The amendment failed to obtain
the necessary three-foui'ths vote,
largely because of disagreement as to
what should be done if a friend shou'd
admit putting up signs, in a flagrant
case.
Here, the friend would receive 13
hours at the Con Home, but the can
didate, who otherwise might have
been disqualified, could possibly win
| the election.

Excom voted than an easily-under
: stood list of rules be mailed to each
I candidate. A section clarifying the
! status of write-in candidates was
i added to election by-laws.
Excom voted to delegate the Stan
| ford Relief Fund Drive to Cardinals
next year. Cardinals at present han
dles the Red Cross Drive winter
quarter and the Con Home Drive
spring quarter.
Pat Terry, chairman of the drive
(handled by SIRO this year), made
several recommendations for next
year's drive. These were that solici
tors should be chosen and fully
i oriented in the spring, that the drive
should be held earlier in the quarter,
and that the SIRO chairman should
work with Cardinals in handling the
drive.
It was also suggested that solici
i tors be chosen from existing organ
izations, such as Alpha Phi Omega
; and YWCA, rather than from volun
! teers. It was also felt that constant
small collections of dimes and nickels
was undesirable, but that more effort
: should be made for more thorough
| living group collections.
Alpha Phi Omega has planned a
i ride-for-home box in the Main Li
brary lobby, which should be in op
eration Monday. This box will have
cubicles for each state, and persons
desiring rides may leave slips there.
Excom voted approval of this project.
The question of a salary for the
ASSU president was considered and
referred to a committee. The YWCA
report was postponed until next
week. Details of a Special Social
Committee Organization were riven
to Excom by Jan O'Brien, ASSU vice-
I president.

Excom voted to delegate the Stan

next year. Cardinals at present han
dles the Red Cross Drive winter
quarter and the Con Home Drive
spring quarter.
Pat Terry, chairman of the drive
(handled by SIRO this year), made
several recommendations for next
year's drive. These were that solici
tors should be chosen and fully
i oriented in the spring, that the drive
should be held earlier in the quarter,
and that the SIRO chairman should
work with Cardinals in handling the
drive.
It was also suggested that solici
i tors be chosen from existing organ
izations, such as Alpha Phi Omega
; and YWCA, rather than from volun
! teers. It was also felt that constant
small collections of dimes and nickels
was undesirable, but that more effort
: should be made for more thorough
| living group collections.
Alpha Phi Omega has planned a
i ride-for-home box in the Main Li
brary lobby, which should be in op
eration Monday. This box will have
cubicles for each state, and persons
desiring rides may leave slips there.
Excom voted approval of this project.
The question of a salary for the
ASSU president was considered and
referred to a committee. The YWCA
report was postponed until next
week. Details of a Special Social
Committee Organization were riven
to Excom by Jan O'Brien, ASSU vice-
I president.

All candidates will compete in a primary election in the future,
even if only two or three persons file for the office, Excom decided
last night.
If any candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in the
primary, which will not be preferential, he will win the election

♦at that time. Otherwise, a final elec
tion will be held on the preferential
system for the top four, or less, can
didates.
After an extended discussion, an
amendment designed to curb illegal
electioneering was tabled until next
week. Maximum penalties of 22 hours
at the Con Home for a candidate who
campaigned illegally, and 15 hours
for some other person who admitted
having electioneered illegally without
the candidate's consent, were con
sidered.
Excom also considered disqualifica
tion of the candidate in flagrant cases.
Marv Tincher, Daily business man

to be missing the basic point on elec

policing of the campus, he said, not
on the punishment of the candidate
