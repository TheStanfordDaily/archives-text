Sunday afternoon a student's father arrived
on campus on his way to the Philippines. He
knew that his daughter was living on campus,
but he didn't know her address. After two
hours' investigation, including futile calls to
all v/omen's residences, he was forced to race
to the airport to catch his plane, and never did
see his daughter. Apparently she lived in a
private home.
This is another example to support our pre
vious plea for having campus files open 24
hours a day. Now that the Bawlouts have been
distributed, the problem is partially taken care
of, but the Bawlout came out only yesterday,
and the quarter is two-thirds over.
Until the Bawlout is published, there is no
way to get information about students from 5
p.m. to 8 a.m. and on the weekends.
Two solutions present themselves to this
problem:
1. Leave the University switchboard open
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This would take
care of long distance calls as well as local
queries.
2. Make up microfilm strips of information
cards of all students and distribute these strips

around the campus.
One, all-inclusive page would be placed in
the reg book. A master microfilm copy would
be made with all 8,000 information cards on it.
Prints of this master film would then be taken
and distributed. Viewers could be purchased
for around $40, or made at home for under $10.
New names could be added to the strips with
only scissors and Scotch tape.
These microfilms would also end the con
stant requests by campus groups for an infor
mation page in the fall quarter reg book.
One, general information page could be
placed in the reg books, instead of the present
number of almost identical pages, and this
page could be microfilmed and distributed to
anybody who was willing to pay the print cost,
about $20 each.
The process is cheap, fast, and could be com
pleted within a week after the start of school.
If one of these strips were placed in the Fire
House, which is open and attended 24 hours
a day, a visitor to the campus would be able to
locate students at any time of the day or night.

This is another example to support our pre
vious plea for having campus files open 24
hours a day. Now that the Bawlouts have been
distributed, the problem is partially taken care
of, but the Bawlout came out only yesterday,
and the quarter is two-thirds over.
Until the Bawlout is published, there is no
way to get information about students from 5
p.m. to 8 a.m. and on the weekends.
Two solutions present themselves to this
problem:
1. Leave the University switchboard open
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This would take
care of long distance calls as well as local
queries.
2. Make up microfilm strips of information
cards of all students and distribute these strips

around the campus.
One, all-inclusive page would be placed in
the reg book. A master microfilm copy would
be made with all 8,000 information cards on it.
Prints of this master film would then be taken
and distributed. Viewers could be purchased
for around $40, or made at home for under $10.
New names could be added to the strips with
only scissors and Scotch tape.
These microfilms would also end the con
stant requests by campus groups for an infor
mation page in the fall quarter reg book.
One, general information page could be
placed in the reg books, instead of the present
number of almost identical pages, and this
page could be microfilmed and distributed to
anybody who was willing to pay the print cost,
about $20 each.
The process is cheap, fast, and could be com
pleted within a week after the start of school.
If one of these strips were placed in the Fire
House, which is open and attended 24 hours
a day, a visitor to the campus would be able to
locate students at any time of the day or night.

Sunday afternoon a student's father arrived
on campus on his way to the Philippines. He
knew that his daughter was living on campus,
but he didn't know her address. After two
hours' investigation, including futile calls to
all v/omen's residences, he was forced to race
to the airport to catch his plane, and never did
see his daughter. Apparently she lived in a
private home.
