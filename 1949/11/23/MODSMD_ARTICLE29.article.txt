(Editor's Note: When space does not permit the
printing cf an entire story, it is the custom to cut it,
beginning at the bottom. For that reason news
writing style demands that the important facts be
gotten oJT first, leaving the less important details to
the last. The Cal Haiders story was cut from the bot
tom, hut important facts were unintentionally re
moved in the cutting. The last two paragraphs were
as follows:
Callaway's opportunity to escape came in Redwood
City when a woman driver pulled out in front of the
Cal car. As the car screeched to a stop, he lunged
for the door. The C a linen resisted fiercely, but Cal-
Lway escaped.
"I vvas pleased," said Callaway. "I don't know
about them."
