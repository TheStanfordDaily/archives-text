### 
To the Editor:
As members of an institution of "higher learning'
we ou-'ht to learn something from the Cal-Stanford
fame. The team played a whale of a game; they may
have made a few mistakes—anybody here who hasn't
made any today?
They played just as hard a game as Ca!—isn't it
Q;:ite possible Cal was a mite luckier? No matter what
scribes and others may say, there is an element of
luck in football—as in every other game in this life—
irom guessing what a prof will ask on an exam to how
your date will react to the next move. In short, nobody
on the team wanted to lose the game. They played in
a manner that showed it. Let's give 'em their due
credit.
Most of life is being able to take defeat—from that
di hed out in a football game to that encountered in
business, so:
Again, let's get off the team's back. They're carrying
enough of a load as it is!
