# Council Election

To the Editor:
In regard to the pre-Big Game editorial, "Is Self*
1 erpetuation a Privilege," I don't know whether i!
would have helped or hindered any candidate had
Men's Council supported one or another of them in
that election, but the fact is that we supported none of
them. Ihe editorial states, "Alter an attempt to reopen

nominations had failed, our representatives on Council
took it upon themselves to round up write-in candi
dates for the office and actively support them in the
election." The move to "round up" write-in candidates
was actually made before the attempt to reopen nomi
nations and was the result of the same motive.
A great many students expressed to me a sincere
desire to have someone else on the ballot, and since I
felt they should have that opportunity, I was among
those (riot Council members) who encouraged write
in candidates, and I asked Excom to formally reopen
nominations. The editorial writer admits that the pro
posal to reopen nominations was made with no refer
ence whatsoever to the qualifications of either of the
then candidates or of those who wanted a place on
the ballot.
As to the other members of Council or myself "ac
tively supporting" any candidate in the election, we
decided not to campaign, either individually or col
lectively, for respective preferences if any and ex
pressly avoided any acts which might be interpreted
as individual or collective endorsement of any candi
date.
Self-perpetuation is not a privilege, nor is it a possi
bility in a democracy. If Men's Council had nomi
nated and endorsed any candidate, he would undoubt
edly have lost innumerable votes, as voters resent
above all being told how to vote by other officers. But
if a substantial number of voters want to back another
candidate or candidates not on the ballot, I think it is
not only a privilege but a duty to see that they have
that opportunity, which act could hardly be termed
"directly opposed to the principles of democracy."
