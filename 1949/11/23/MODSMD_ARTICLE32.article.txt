# Terrible Situation
## 
### 
To the Editor:
If, as The Daily editorial said, the Cal rooting section
was "obnoxious," then what was the Stanford section
when it suggested that Oskie has no father, and when
a large j art of it greeted the newsreel cameraman and
other annoying factions with obscene gestures? Every
body was obnoxious, and we don't see why The Daily
didn't give Loth sides to this very, very terrible situa
tion.
If, as Bud Nutting, '53, said, this was "the biggest
and best bonfire yet," then the word "yet" must have a
new meaning. r lhe class of '50 fire was bigger and
better in every way. The whole thing was set on fire
at once, for one thing—and the flames must have gone
twice as high. However, there is no doubt that '53's
fire was the biggest and best we have seen this year.
Congratulations to '53 for being the best thing to hit
Stanford since '52.
