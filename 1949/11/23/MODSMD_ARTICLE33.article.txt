WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 f/P) —
Pu.isia's progress in mastering the
secrets of the atom may have a de
cisive influence in shaping a new
.'tomic energy partnership agreement
a-'! ong the United States, Britain, and
(!anada.
Ji; loinatic authorities said today
tli; t. the atomic explosion in Russia
had made it more important than ever
for the We:;l to build up its atomic
I • nb stockpile as rapidly a.s possible.
This view evidently will he ad
vanced by the United States in nego
tiations with Britain and Canada as

an urgent argument for continuing to
concentrate the production of atomic
explosives in this country without
any cut in the supply of raw materials
coming here.
The State Department announced
today that the second round of "ex
ploratory atomic energy conversa
tions" representatives of the
three countries will be opened next
Monday. The first round was held in
Washington in late September.
At issue is revision of the war-born
partnership of the three Western

Powers in atomic secrets and devel
opment of the first atomic bomb.
What seems likely, according to
American informants, is that Presi
dent Truman will seek congressional
sanction to give Britain and Canada
more information than they have
heretofore received.
Britain and Canada, for their part,
are expected to continue supporting
maximum allocations of uranium ore
to the United States—even though in
the end they may not obtain all the
! information they would like to have.
