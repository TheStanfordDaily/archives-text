Under present planning the ROTC
program should eventually reach an
annual output of 22,000 commis
sioned officers.
This prediction was made by
Brigadier General Wendell West
over, executive officer for reserve
and ROTC affairs, In an address to
the 24th biennial convention of the
National Society of Scabbard and
Blade at the William Penn Hotel in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, early this
month.
Gen. Westover stressed the impor
tance that the Department of Na
tional Defense is placing on the new
ROTC programs, Air, Naval, and
Army alike.
ROTC in Majority
During World War 11, he pointed
out, approximately 100,000 ROTC
graduates served in ranks from sec
ond lieutenant to brigadier general.
An analysis of five combat divisions
showed that 52 per cent of the lieu
tenant colonels, 83 per cent of the
majors, and 70 per cent of the cap
tains were reserve officers, the ma
jority having received their com
missions via the ROTC program.
At a luncheon on November 5, the
convention heard Colonel Robert M.
Thurston, from the office of the
Chief of the Air Force RO'I'C divi
sion, discuss recent changes and
plans in his department. The Air
Force desires to raise the percent
age of its junior officers holding
Bachelors' degrees, lie said. In line
with this, recent reductions in the
number of reserve officers on active
duty were made to make room for
Air ROTC graduates desiring tem
porary tours of active duty, particu
larly those desiring regular active
duty.
Blind Date Ball
The convention, which ran from
November 3 through November 5,
was attended by about 130 delegates
from 89 universities throughout the
United States. Host universities
were the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Tech, and Duquesne Uni
versity.
A military ball was held in the

Pittsburgh Room of the William
Penn Hotel on November 4. Blind
dates for the occasion were supplied
to the delegates by the offices of the
deans of women of the three host
universities. Forms had been sent to
the delegates asking for "desired
height," "color hair," and "any other
specifications." Selections were made
accordingly, and the results were
pleasing (surprisingly enough under
the circumstances) to most of the
delineates, including this reporter.
With the regular business of the
convention disposed of, complemen
tary tickets to the Ohio State-Pitt
football game were handed out No
vember 5, and the assemblage for
mally adjourned with a banquet
that night.
