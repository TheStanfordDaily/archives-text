# Verdict on Ward Due
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Chinese
Communists reported today that
their "people's court" at Mukden has
finished an investigation and will
give a verdict on American Consul
General Angus Ward and four
members of his staff "in a matter of
days."
This first word on their fate was
received by the State Department
and gave new urgency to American
efforts to free the five from jail who
were charged with beating a Chi
nese employee of the consulate.
There appeared to be little doubt
that the Western governments
would go along with Acheson's plea
for international action in freeing
the five, but there was a big ques
tion whether Moscow would join in
bringing pressure on its Chinese
protege.
