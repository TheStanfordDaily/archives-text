## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Two members of Delta Upsilon
| from the University of British Co
[ lumbia visited their Farm brothers
| last week, staying overnight at the
chapter house and relating their ex
periences while touring around the
country.
Joe Nold and Rod Nixon made the
stopover while en route to I-os An
geles on the first leg of a bicycle
journey which will take them across
the United States, to the Bahamas
and Cuba, and eventually to Europe.
Riding their English-built Rudgc
lightweights, the two Vancouver bi
cyclists clocked their 1,200 th mile
coming up Palm Drive. Ea ( .h bike is
loaded with 40 pounds of equipment,
including sleeping bags, a tent, par
kas, cooking utensils, and personal
gear. They ditched a four-inch-thiek
Webster's dictionary in Seattle,
figuring the extra weight wasn't
worth the information the Y.째' ume
contained.
Time Oil From Faw
Both are juniors in the pro-law
I curriculum at the University of
i British Columbia, and expect to re
turn next fail when their interconti
nental bike excursion is finished.
Nixon and Nold left Vancouver
October 8 in a heavy downpour, clad
only in shorts and their Navy parkas.
They passed through Seattle, Taco
ma, and Olympia on their way to
| Portland, making about 65 miles a
clay, which average they have main
tained all the way.
South of Portland they turned oil
U.S. 99 and continued down the
| Coast Highway, 101. Nold considered
[ this stretch along the Oregon sea-
I coast the most scenic country they
have yet passed through. Not to be
rude, they conceded California to be
| a beautiful state, but made the ob
i servation that everything seemed to
be quite parched.
Stopped at S.F.
The travelers stayed for a few days
j in San Francisco, and confessed they
j were glad to leave. The city's hills
| aren't conducive to bike-riding.
! Nixon and Nold stayed overnight at
i the Cal D.U. House, toured that cam
pus, and heard Pandit Nehru speak

in the Greek Theater last Monday.
The two Canadian students are
i now headed for L.A. where they
plan to spend several days visiting
friends and lying on the beach, view
ing the Southern California scenery
I which they have heard so much
1 about. They arc then going to ship
their bikes to sonic point in Texas,
j pick them up there, and continue to
New Orleans.
After the Trip, a Book
After visiting the Crescent City,
they will head for Miami, which they
expect to make by winter. When
they complete a side trip to the Ba
hamas and Cuba, they will travel to
Europe. They intend to tour the
Continent and the British Isles also
on their bikes.
Nold, and his partner Nixon, are
keeping a journal of their experi
ences, which now fills many pages
| of a battered notebook. They have
j made arrangements with local B.C.
I publishers and hope to sec their ad
ventures in print some day. Many
papers along their route have given
publicity to their novel feat. The
pair expect to travel over 25,000
miles in the next year, and more
than 15,000 of those will be on their
bicycles.
