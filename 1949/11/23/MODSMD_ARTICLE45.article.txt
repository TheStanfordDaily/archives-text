# BOB BERNSTEIN
## Midweek Musings 
### 
Frankie was boiling. In a real stew. I could tell when he didn't try to
short change me on my first beer.
It was a shame, too. He had been so elated over Cal's win last Saturday
that I thought he'd be happy for months. He had even set out some free
bowls of Monachino cherries, as he called them. Frankie was never good at
spelling, and I didn't want to spoil his happiness by setting him straight.
But something was wrong now, no doubt about it. I asked him about it.
"What's your trouble, Frankie." Always original, that's me.
"Sportswriters, if you'll excuse the expression, that's what's wrong. Did
you see this?" He threw a grimy sports page on a grimier bar for my further
edification.
I looked at the article in question.
"So what? It's just the AP All-Ivy League team."
"Yeah, but Huston ain't on it, man, Huston ain't on it. Is that robbery, or
ain't it?"
The Same Huston
He was referring, of course, to Howard Huston, Harvard's giant tackle,
who was being boomed so heartily for All-American at the season's in
fancy. The same Huston who made BSy Area fans sit up and take notice
even while his team was being thoroughly shellacked by Stanford.
1 reminded Frankie of the All-American fanfare that surrounded Hus
ton's name earlier in the year.
"Sure, that was when they all said Harvard would have a good year. Now
just because his team turned out lousy, the sportswriters act like they'd
never heard of him. So what if Harvard can't lick Paducah Highl That
don't mean Huston isn't the best tackle in the country.
"These all-star teams give me a pain anyway. Most of the bums that pick
'em probably haven't seen a game all year. And if they did, their opinions
wouldn't mean any more than anybody else's."
On COP
That led to a discussion of College of the Pacific, and their rooters' frus
tration over the possibility that Bill Leiser might think more of Bob Celeri's
quarterbacking than he does of Eddie Leßaron's.
"Swarming all over the Chronicle's oHiee isn't gonna make Leßaron a
better football player. And Leiser's saying so wouldn't do it either."
Frankie continued. "Why, those birds would rather have Leßaron picked
on All-America than have their team picked for a bowl game. What kind
of sense does that make?"
I was being kept busy nodding my head at everything Frankie said, so
he kept talking.
"That poor Leiser really gets it from all sides. Cal hates him cuz he picked
Celeri for All-American, and Stanford hates him cuz Cal gets a bigger play
in the Green."
At this point Frankie ran down, I had another beer, and two California
students who had been celebrating since Saturday night, finally passed out
arid were shoved in a back room.
Oli, the Bums!
That kept Frankie busy for a few moments, but he was back quickly with
some more gripes on the all-star situation.
"When those newspaper bums don't put a player like Ken Hose on any
of the first three All-Coast teams, you know their teams can't mean much.
"Rose should probably be rated ahead of Bill McColl, who did make the
first team. McColl has the makings of All-American, sure enough, but Rose
was more valuable this year. There might be a few yuys around that come
close to him at catching passes, but those same ones can't block in the same
stadium with Rose."
I reminded Frankie that Rose had just been chosen on Collier's All-Coast
lineup, the only Stanford player to do so.
"Everybody's gonna be right part of the time," he countered, "but both
Collier's and INS left Monachino off their teams, Oregon's got a great tackle
named Dougherty that nobody's even mentioned, Washington .... ah,
what's the use."
Yes, Frankie is confused. And I can't help but wonder if he'll last until
Christinas, by which time some half-million groups and individuals will
have chosen their half-million "official" All-Alls.
