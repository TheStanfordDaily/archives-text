# McColl and Castagnoli Make All-Coast Eleven
## Hugasian and Gordy White Place On Second and Third Team Rosters 
### 
Stanford captured two position on the International News Serv
ice's All-Pacific Coast football team released yesterday with Jim
Castagnoli and Bill McColl taking top honors at center and end.
McColl, a 217-pounder from San Diego, playing his first year on
the varsity, was tagged by the INS as "one of the brightest sopho-

more ends to come along in a good
many years." Not only has McColl
developed into one of the best pass
catchers on the Coast in the last few
games, but he also managed the de
fensive tackle chores for the Indians
late in the season and came close
more than once to becoming a ()0-
ininute man.
Jim Castagnoli, playing his last
year under the Cardinal colors, has
been mentioned by sportswriters up
and down the Coast for AU-American
honors. Cas played inspirational ball
the entire season, and was Stanford's
greatest "workhorse" in both the cen
ter of the line and at linebacker.
Harry Hugasian, who was the most
consistent ground-gainer for the
Cards, landed on the second team.
Gordy White, for his great block
ing at the tackle spot, won his spurs
on the third team.
For the first team, INS selected Mc-
Coll and Wilkinson (UCLA) at ends,
Turner and Cullom (both of Cali
fornia) at tackles, Franz (Cal) and
Sterling (Santa Clara) at guard, Cas
tagnoli at center, Leßaron (College
of Pacific) at quarterback, Carpenter
(Oregon State) and Johnson (UCLA)
at halfbacks, and 01 lie Matson (Uni
versity of San Francisco) at fullback.
