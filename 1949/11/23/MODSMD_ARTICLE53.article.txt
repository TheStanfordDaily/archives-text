# Card Rugby Practice Starts; Season to Open in January
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Rugby—that great game of organ
ized confusion once again steps into
the spotlight now that the football
season has officially ended. Informal
practice has already started despite
the fact that the season doesn't get
underway until the second week in
January.
Last season, the Indian ruggers won
7 games and dropped only one, hut
the single defeat was hard to take,
since it came at the hands of Cali
fornia. The Cards have failed to whip
the Bear ruggers since before the
war, but Coach Chuck Taylor seems
to think that this may be the big year
for revenge.
Twenty-eighl lettermen will be re
turning from last year's squad, in
cluding such stalwarts as John Rose
krans, Mike Spiro (captain), Darrhl
Dentoni, Ralph Davidson, Vance
ShefTey, Sam Halstead, Boyd Benson,
Sarge Littlehale, John Banks, and
Pete Peckham. The chief losses
through graduation were Marty
Feldinan, Bob Lindsay, and Ed Culin.
Need Placekicker
Benson is being groomed for the
scrum half slot left vacant by Lind
say's departure, but Taylor's big
problem is to find a placekicker to
fill in for Culin. It is hoped that Bill
McColl will decide to turn out and
supply the educated toe which is so
vitally needed.
As yet the schedule has not been
drawn up, but it will definitely in
clude the Olympic Club, University
Club, Menlo Ramblers, Petaluma,
and UCLA. The team may take a
trip either to British Columbia or
south for the UCLA game, but as yet
no definite arrangements have been
made. The British Columbians are
coming down to play Cal 011 March 11,
so Stanford will probably schedule a

game with the Canadians that week
end.
No Eligibility Rules
If the turnout is large enough, Tay
lor is thinking of using the platoon
system—that is, substituting and en
tirely new unit every 20 minutes. In
addition, there will probably be a
JV schedule.
For those interested in turning out
lor rugby, there are no rules 011 eli
gibility; the only requirement is that
you be enrolled in the University.
The team practices from 3 to 5, live
days a week for the first two weeks
of winter quarter and thereafter only
three days a week.
The usual P.E. credit of one unit,
and a possible circle "S" provide ade
quate compensation.
