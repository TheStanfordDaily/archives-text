# La 						Piere Reports On Studies In Germany
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN 
There can be no doubt about the
; resistance t:ie Nazi occupation forces
in Western Europe encountered from
Ismail communities —it was fierce, re
lentless and well organized.
'1 his is how Stanford sociologist
Richard LaPiere sums up his find
-1 injs after a four-month study of
small town resistance to the German
I occupation.
With his wife, Professor LaPiere
traveled in England, France, Italy,
I Switzerland, Belgium, arid Holland
I during spring and summer quarters.
| He was on his sabbatical leave.
His studies, concentrated mainly in
: France, convinced him that a major
j sociological investigation of commu
j nily resistance to Nazi methods of
! social control is feasible.

"The resistance these people of
fered was tremendous. However, it
was not always the sensational bomb
planting, bridge destroying type so
often connected with underground
movements," LaPiere said.
Resistance Passive
"Instead," he added, "it was a
never-ending series ol minor bot
tlenecks and slowdowns in food col
lections and war industries—not
glamorous but highly effective and
frustrating."
Among the main reasons for the
resistance movement's great success,
La Pi ere lists the supreme co-opera
tion among the people. This co-op
eration, he surmised, was due to the
presence of an actual crisis and tan
gible enemy.
As for collaborationists, the Stan
ford professor said they either left
the country or won back some de
gree of community acceptance.
"it must be remembered that there
were different degrees of collabora
tion. Evryone was at least forced to
pretend to co-operate with the Ger
mans to some extent," he remarked,
European recovery, according to
LaPiere, is progressing nicely, with
the life of the people on the daliy
scale better than is generally be
lieved.
U.S. Misconceptions
He blames the distorted view many
Americans have of the European
standard of living upon a tendency
of American newspapermen to judge
Europe by prewar American stand
ards.
Communism, besides the local
committee, plays a minor role in the
people':; lives as contrasted to the
American preoccupation with the
subject, LaPiere said.
A universal similarity among
Western Europeans is their bitter
hatred of the Germans. "Some peo
ple were so anxious to show their
contempt for the "beast-like huns"
that 1 had trouble sifting exaggera
tion from facts," he said.
"No, I saw few Americans and did
little sightseeing," LaPiere answered
in reply to a question. "This was a
trip to see people, not tilings."

'1 his is how Stanford sociologist
Richard LaPiere sums up his find
-1 injs after a four-month study of
small town resistance to the German
I occupation.
With his wife, Professor LaPiere
traveled in England, France, Italy,
I Switzerland, Belgium, arid Holland
I during spring and summer quarters.
| He was on his sabbatical leave.
His studies, concentrated mainly in
: France, convinced him that a major
j sociological investigation of commu
j nily resistance to Nazi methods of
! social control is feasible.

"The resistance these people of
fered was tremendous. However, it
was not always the sensational bomb
planting, bridge destroying type so
often connected with underground
movements," LaPiere said.
Resistance Passive
"Instead," he added, "it was a
never-ending series ol minor bot
tlenecks and slowdowns in food col
lections and war industries—not
glamorous but highly effective and
frustrating."
Among the main reasons for the
resistance movement's great success,
La Pi ere lists the supreme co-opera
tion among the people. This co-op
eration, he surmised, was due to the
presence of an actual crisis and tan
gible enemy.
As for collaborationists, the Stan
ford professor said they either left
the country or won back some de
gree of community acceptance.
"it must be remembered that there
were different degrees of collabora
tion. Evryone was at least forced to
pretend to co-operate with the Ger
mans to some extent," he remarked,
European recovery, according to
LaPiere, is progressing nicely, with
the life of the people on the daliy
scale better than is generally be
lieved.
U.S. Misconceptions
He blames the distorted view many
Americans have of the European
standard of living upon a tendency
of American newspapermen to judge
Europe by prewar American stand
ards.
Communism, besides the local
committee, plays a minor role in the
people':; lives as contrasted to the
American preoccupation with the
subject, LaPiere said.
A universal similarity among
Western Europeans is their bitter
hatred of the Germans. "Some peo
ple were so anxious to show their
contempt for the "beast-like huns"
that 1 had trouble sifting exaggera
tion from facts," he said.
"No, I saw few Americans and did
little sightseeing," LaPiere answered
in reply to a question. "This was a
trip to see people, not tilings."
