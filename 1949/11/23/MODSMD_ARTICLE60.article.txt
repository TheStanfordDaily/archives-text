# Farm Players to Present 'Street Scene'
## 
### 
The student production of "Street
Scene," a play by Elmer I-iice, is
scheduled for presentation on No
vember 30, 111, December 1, and 2
in the Stanford Little Theater. Tick
ets are now on sale at the Memorial
Auditorium box office.
The play, a 1929 Pulit/.er prize
winning production on Broadway, is
being directed by Morton Zieve, a
graduate dramatics student, to ful
fill part of the requirements set up
by the Speech and Drama Depart
ment for the M.A. degree.
According' to Zieve, "Street
Scene" is playwright Rice's attempt
to duplicate on the stage, the aims
of the numerous sociological novels
which appeared during the 1920'5.
"Slice of Life"
"The play was written," said
Zieve, "in the form of what is known
as the 'slice of life' technique. Rice
has attempted to capture with pho
tographic realism the lives and ac
tions of a group of lower class New
Yorkers during a 24-hour period,
it is this naturalism along with Rice's
message of freedom for the individ

ual that we are trying to portray."
To achieve this spirit, playwright
Rice wrote into the play several
short walk-on parts and small con
versational incidents which are noL
connected with the plot of the play
but which set the stage as an ac
tually reproduced "street scene" un
folding its many life stories in front
of a brownstone tenement in Brook
lyn.
Realistic Devices
Another method Rice employs for
achieving realism is the use of ac
tual dialects that are found in the
cosmopolitan city of Brooklyn.
There is an Italian musician with a
German wife. Living on the ground
floor of the tenement is a Jewish
Russian refugee with radical lean
ings. fn the basement live a Swedish
janitor and his wife. With these, are
the many offshoots of the broad
mouthed Brooklyn accent.
Naturalism has also been carried
into the setting and the costumes.
Though the play was written in 1929,
Zieve and his staff decided, in light
of the current return of fashions and

j world political unrest, not to pro-
J duce the play as a period piece.
When Elmer Rice wrote "Street
Scene," he was already a successful
playwright, in 1923 his unique play,
"The Adding Machine," was a smash
hit on Broadway.
Problems of Production
In the summer of 1928, Rice could
find no one who would produce his
play because of the difficulties in
volved. Finally Rouben Mamoulian
consented to direct it. However,
during one of the rehearsals, he
"went out to get a cigar, and never
came back."
Rice himself finally took over the
direction duties, his first professional
try in that capacity, and the play
opened in January, 1929. It became
j an immediate success, winning the
! Pulitzer Prize in Drama for that
| year.
| The Stanford production of
| "Street Scene" is the first presenta
| tion in the Bay Area since 1935 when
the Palo Alto Community Theater
I produced it.
