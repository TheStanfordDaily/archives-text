Chips Ofl' The Old Benchley, by Rob
ert Benchley. Harper and broth
ers, $3. Illustrated: Gluyas Wil
liams.
"Being simply a person who writes
little articles sporadically and with
no distinction, I am forced to have
something on my mind about which
lo write. When I write a thing, I do
it because 1 have something faintly
vital burning within me which I feel
it my simple obligation to the State
to express."
Thus wrote Robert Benchley in a
slyly modest self-evaluation.
The "faintly vital burning," how
ever, took any number of forms.
There was, for example, Benchley
the Crusader.
Then, there was Benchley, the
friendly letter-writer. From a night
club, on the "back of a check, he
once wrote: "Dear Bank, Having a
wonderful time, wish you were here.
I.ove to all, Bob." The check was,
of course, cashed.
"Funny That Way"
Benchley was also an informal his
torian. By way of preface to a schol
arly study of the Queen Anne period
he stated flatly: "The other day while
cleaning out my desk, I came across
a lot of old snow."
Benchley was, to swipe a phrase,
all things to many men. "I am," he
said, "funny that way." And indeed
he was.
Just how funny can he readily
seen in the new collection of Bench
ley pieces published last month by
Harper and Brothers under the title

| "Chips OfT the Old Benchley."
These short essays, collected by his
j wife and illustrated by the inimitable
Giuyas Williams, provide a varied
collection of some of the best ol
1 Benchley's writings.
For example, he tolls of a now
theory of behavioral happiness which
! is wrapped up in the glands. "Any
j one singing 'For He's a Jolly Good
Fellow" does not face the facts
| squarely. The words should go: 'For
j he lias jolly good glandular secre
tions, which nobody can deny'."
Based on Ridiculous
Benchley humor needs no explana
tion. His apparently aimless little
pieces, obviously the work of a
troubled but earnest social citizen,
are as finely crafted as poetry.
The humor seems to be based upon
a rather penetrating sense of the ri
diculous, which might be couched in
any form from pointed satire to the
indignant and evidently not very
literary remarks of an ardent writer
of letters to the editor.
The result is as funny as gravy
down a deep plunging neckline.
Here is a man who can be terribly
worried about the state of American
whippet racing, about how Cicero
I would fare in the U. S. Senate, about
' why professors insist on being stuffy
regarding superstitions which have
been scientifically proven true, about
flower-namers, and about the over
hearing silence of secretaries taking
letters.
Here, in a word, is Benchley, which
| is certainly enough of a word.
