# Guild Shows 'Quartet,' Presenting Four Excellent Maugham Stories
## 
### DUANE SPILLSBURY 
"Quartet," the J. Arthur Rank
production which is billed as Som
erset Maugham's farewell to his mo
tion picture public, is currently en
tering its third week at the Guild
Theater.
The picture is composed of four of
Maugham's favorite short stories,
each directed by a different direc
tor, but all produced by Sidney Box.
The first of the novelettes takes a
whimsical crack at some of the 20th
century Victorian precepts about not
gambling, not lending money, and
not associating with strange women.
A young lad who disregards all
three points in his father's advice
comes out the better by about 100,-
000 francs.
Number two, which is the weak
est, tells the story of the son of a
wealthy English family who shocks
his family by wanting to take up
piano-playing in a professional vein.
When he fails to achieve his aim, he
kills himself. The actor is a little
too stiff-faced to portray the disil
lusioned youth.
The third story is a superb delin
eation of a British lower middle
class family which takes delight in
flying kites on the Common. The
picture of the viciously protective
mother and the indecisive son who
"escapes" by flying and designing
kites is real and penetrating with
out being a psychiatric autopsy.
Maugham doesn't insult his audi
ence or thrill hypochondriacs as
Hollywood has been doing lately.
The last story is the best. It is
the story of an English colonel
whose wife writes "earthly, passion
ate" poetry about the love affair of

a middle-aged woman and a young
man. To the colonel, everything ex
cept prize bulls and an occasional
nefarious weekend in London is a
'/'crashing bore." When the little
j woman's book of poetry runs into
j the sixth edition, the colonel suffers
the horrors of hell until he discov
ers—but there's no use telling the
ending, which is indeed a fine touch
upon which to end a fine movie.
