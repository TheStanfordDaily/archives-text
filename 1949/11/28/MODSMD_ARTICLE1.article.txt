## Vice-Consul Released 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (/P) â€”
Chinese Communists at Mukden
have released Vice-Consul William
N. Stokes and ordered the entire
American consulate staff deported,
the State Department announced to
day.
The deportation order was issued
by a Communist people's court in
connection with a spy trial yester
day in which ten Chinese, Japanese,
and Koreans were sentenced, the
announcement said.
Stokes was an enforced "observ
er" at the trial. This accounted for
the fact that he was taken from the
consulate by Communist authorities
and kept away for approximately
seven hours.
