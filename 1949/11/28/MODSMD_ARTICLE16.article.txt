# Southland Men Donate Music

The Stanford Band received a j
railway expressed "turkey" over the
holiday in the form of a $3,000 music
library. The gift represents dona
tions from about 30 San Diego busi
nessmen, several of whom are grad
uates of the Stanford Law School.
The gift library was inspired by
Horace A. Moody, a nationally
known musician of past years, who
read an article in The Daily in Oc
tober which said: "The Stanford
Band owns $200 worth of worn-out
music which is handled by one part
time student musician."
Moody, who incidentally has a son
in the band, heard the band on the
USC trip and went home "amazed
that a band could function the way
the Stanford Band did with such an
inadequate library.
Moody located and purchased a
music library formerly started by
the James Military Band in the
Philippines and continued by the
famous Westlake Band of Los An
geles.
Although the library has been in
active for about eight years, there
fore lacking some of the modern
compositions, the standard conceit
selections are a'l present. 1 here's
everything from Ippolotow - Iva- \
now's "Caucasian Sketches" to light j
operas like "New Moon," and from !
Victor Herbert to Rudolph Friml.
Julius Shuchat, director of the |
Stanford Band, said "the music is in
marvelous condition and is well cat
alogued." He plans to combine the
few good compositions of the dusty
old library with the gift library and
organize the music in a special room
at the Knoll.
Tentative plans call for a special
concert to be given in the spring, in
recognition of the gift library. The
program will consist entirely of
overtures, wa'tzes, marches, and se
lections from the new collection.
In addition to the contributions of
IVIr. and Mrs. Horace Moody, the fol- \
lowing graduates helped buy the li
