## 
### 
Last, week, Farm students re
ceived in their mailboxes a sheet of
Christmas seals with a letter from
the Santa Clara County Tubercu
losis Association.
This was the beginning of the an
nual Christmas seal sale, which is
the only means by which the asso
ciation raises its funds.
The funds received in this Christ
mas drive are used to fight tuber
culosis through X-ray examinations,
health education, and research. Last
year !)5 per cent of the money raised
here remained within California, for

the use of the state and local tuber
culosis associations with which the
Santa Clara group is affiliated.
The year-round tuberculosis con
trol program last year found 74 pre
viously unsuspected active cases of
tuberculosis through mass chest X
rays; 25,591 persons were examined.
Christmas seal sale funds also paid
for health educators who worked
with the people of the community
to acquaint them with the facts
about tuberculosis, which kills more
people between the ages of 15 and
34 than any other disease.
