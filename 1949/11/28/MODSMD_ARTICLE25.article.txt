# Tickets Sell Fast to Rice's 'Street Scene'
## 
### 
"Street Scene," the three-act play
by Elmer Rice to be given this
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, is a sell-out as far as the
last two nights are concerned.
Scats for Wednesday and Thurs
day nights are still available, said
Morton Zieve, director. Tickets are
on sale at the Memorial Auditorium
box office every day from 9-12 and
1-5. They cost 60 cents apiece.
The play, a three-act production
taking place in New York in the
present, will be held in the Studio
Theater in Memorial Auditorium.
Jane McArthur will play Rose
Maurrant, a young girl of 20, in the
slums of New York. The situation in
the play finds her family breaking
up. Her mother, played by Jean Mc-
Campbell Cowley, wife of Stanford
Professor Cowley, is having an af
fair with Steve Sankey, played by
William Roscoe.
The play takes place within the
period of one "day. Technical Di
ractor Marion Cohen has a four
story building constructed as a set,
complete with real windows, inter
iors, sidewalk, and cellar.
Jeffrey Kurz plays Mr. Maurrant,
Rose's father. Monte Himmelbaum
takes the part of Sam Kaplan, a
young student who is in love with
Rose. Rose herself is not certain she
loves Sam, however.
The play, described as a "slice of
life" by Director Zieve, has two con
current themes. One is Ihe affair be
tween Rose's mother and Steve San
key; the other is the love of Sam
Kaplan for Rose.
Lou Lapin plays Mrs. Fiorentino,
and Frank Wolff plays her husband,
an Italian music teacher living in the
ame building with Ihe Maururants.
M. Fiorentino is a jovial, laughing
character.
Dorothy Wyman lakes the part of
Mrs. Jones, a snoopy, busy gossip.
There are 48 characters in "Street
Scene." The play is of an experi
mental nature in the construction of
the plot and its development.
