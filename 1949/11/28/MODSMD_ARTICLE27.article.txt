WASHINGTON Nov. 27 (AP)
— The National Interfraternity
Conference wants college fra
ternities to eliminate from their
charters any bars to member
ship for racial or religious rea
sons.
An anti-bias resolution was
adopted by a 36 to 3 vote late yes
terday. Nineteen fraternities did not.
The conference has been sensitive
to criticism which arose when some
chapters were penalized by their na
tional Greek-letter organizations for
oledging Negro members.
The anti-bias stand, which repre
sents a turnabout in policy, resulted
from an undergraduate movement in
New England. Some of the Midwest
"Big Ten" universities and other
colleges joined in the campaign dur
ing the three-day meeting here.
The proposal adopted recommends
that fraternities which restrict mem
bership "to a sectional or religious
or other qualifying group .... take
such steps as they may elect to elim
inate such selectivity provisions."
The wording was that of a reso
lutions committee, which watered
down some of the sharper language
of the original proposal, by Alex
ander Goodman of Baltimore, a
member of Pi Kappa Alpha.
The statement emphasizes that
many fraternities have no racial or
religious barriers, that the Interfra
ternity has no authority over the
rules of the affiliated fraternities, and
that membership questions are
strictly matters for the fraternities
to decide.
The resolution, therefore, is purely
advisory.
William J. Barnes, of New York
City, a member of Theta Xi, was
elected the new conference chair
man at yesterday's closing session.
