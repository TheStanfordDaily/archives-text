# Once Again—Protection Inadequate
## 
### 
Protection of the campus at night is a feature
which the University is definitely slipping up
on.
Purse-snatching in the Casa Ventura area is
becoming a fairly common occurrence. The
lack of lights in this isolated part of the campus
adds to the danger of walking there at night.
Students who attend classes at the Knoll are
forced to walk up and back by only the light
of the moon. The central part of the campus is
better lighted, but even the Row is pretty dark.
Through the years there have not been too
many crimes at Stanford brought on by this
cause, but do we need something gory to re
mind the University that it's not too r.afe to have
most of the campus blacked out every night?
Added to the general darkness, there is only
one campus patrol car on duty each night. This
officer can often be found at the Ryan I.ab when
something happens on the Quad.
Committees recommend continuously that
something be done to remedy this situation,
but the University so far has not .seen fit to do
SJO.
In passing, we might also mention that we
are glad that v/hen we called the Stanford po
lice yesterday it was only routine business,
since no one seemed to be home.
We guess it could be made a rule, as at Cal,
that women students cannot walk alone on the
campus at night, but it would seem much more
in keeping with the Stanford Family tradition
to make ours a safe school 24 hours a day.
