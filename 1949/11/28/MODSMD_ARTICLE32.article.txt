# BOE Embarrasses Bruins; Finds UCLA Not University
## 
### 
The University of California (Southern
Branch) woke up one morning last week to find
that it was not a university in the eyes of the
law. This embarrassing bit of information came
out of a State Board of Equalization hearing on
the licensing of a liquor establishment within a
mile and a half of the Westwood campus.
This is what the San Francisco Chronicle had
to say on the incident:
"For years a thirsty UCLA student has had
to walk a mile and a half to find a brass rail.
This separation of Plato and Bacchus on the
southern campus was based on a state law
which prohibited the licensing of a liquor es
tablishment within a one-and-a-half-mile radius
of a university. (Exceptions are the University
of California at Berkeley, where the radius is
one mile, and Cal Aggies at Davis, where it is
three miles.)
'Last week during a State Board of Equaliza
tion hearing on a license request near the West
wood campus, Hugh Strachan, attorney for the
Board, came up with some embarrassing news.
In the eyes of the state's penal laws concerning
liquor enforcement, UCLA was not a university
because it did not have 500 students in resi
dence on the campus. As a consequence, the
license was granted. ,
It was a rude blow to Bruin pride, but it
would save a lot of walking."
