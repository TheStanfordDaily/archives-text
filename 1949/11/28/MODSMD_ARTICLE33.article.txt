# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
After Thanksgiving it up for a whole week, I re
turned to campus last night to find ....
Nothing in particular ....
Except a Robie girl still moaning about not having

a EG date because some blank
ety-blank bull-sessionist had dis
illusioned her followers ....
And also, a newly-tinted Daily
Shack, done in light and dark
shades of green, which is all right
if you are either Irish or have
ever keen seasick, or like fresh
paint on your fingers after you
have tested to make sure that the
signs are honest ....
And also, a discarded and bat
tered Frosli Book which a lonely

] rat clubber had purchased so that he couid uncover
dating mateiiai, only to become thoroughly disgusted
when he found out that his first choice had used only

her BEST head when having her picture clicked . . .
And also, that Bawlouts have been increased two
bits in price, which is outrageous, unjust, and per
fectly in accord with most other things around us
And also, a full-fledged battle (shades of St. Mary's
Jim Phelan and California's Frank Wickhorst) being
waged between the Stanford Daily sports staff and
certain elements of their football coaching staff ....
And also, that nobody accomplished much during
the past week because they were hanging around a
bunch of turkeys ....
And also, that basketball season is about to take
up where football left off ....
And also, that term reports are due, that my books
have a familiar looking film called dust covering
them, and that there are exactly 15 days until finals
But, like I say, I found nothing in particular.
