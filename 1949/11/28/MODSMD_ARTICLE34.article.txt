## Balanced Diet 
### 
To the Editor:
Why worry about the cost of living when you can
get 51.206 calories, enough food for one for 30 days
for $10.25.
Here is a list of the food I used, which checked 18
per cent protein, 19 per cent fat, and 62.5 per cent
carbohydrates:
Twenty-four quarts of buttermilk; 7V> cans, 14U,
ounces, condensed milk; 2 loaves of bread; 4'A lbs"
flour; 1 lb. corn meal; 2 lbs. margarine; 3 lbs. sugar;
2 6-:;z. glasses jelly; 4 lbs. 4 oz. bananas; 2 lbs. fresh
pears; 1 lb. 13 oz. can pears; 6'/ 2 lbs. apples; 5V 2 lbs.
canned peaches; 1 oz. barley; 1 lb. lentils; l'/ 4 lbs.
navy beans; 2M> lbs. green peppers; l'/ 2 Its. carrots;
4 oz. onions; 2 8-oz. cans tomato sauce; 8 oz. oatmeal;
4 oz. dried figs; 12 oz. macaroni; 12 oz. split peas;
1 lb. potatoes. May this selection of food help some
of the students through college on a better balanced
diet.
