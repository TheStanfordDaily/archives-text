# SIRO Drive
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In Tuesday's Daily there were two editorials: one
praising Stanford students for their magnificent job
in building floats and decorating houses (and spend
ing huge sums in doing this); and another condemning
SIRO lor asking for 10-cent voluntary contributions
for tags. It's an awfully queer set of values. Appar
ently relief drives are not important to Stanford stu
dents who are concerned with REALLY important
things like bonfires and bands.
The administration of the drive was described as
the sole cause for the poor returns. Thus nut only is
a gross over-simplification, it is untrue. Among the
many other reasons for the comparative failure of the
drive may be cited: 1) War is no longer foremost in
our minds. People no longer feel the urgency of
maintaining world peace. 2) The long overdue vet
trans checks. 3) Local and international causes were
combined in a single drive when it would have been
far more satisfactory for all concerned to separate
them.
Solicitation is the biggest problem in every drive.
We were very sorry to hear that Women's Row was
up in arms because they didn't know anything about
the drive. It should be noted here that there were
two well publicized meetings held for all solicitors.
All the solicitors who attended found out about their
duties and the purposes of the drive. If the Row
houses knew nothing about the drive, it was nobody's
fault but their own.
Now let's look at the special events, such as dime
dinner and tag day. All these contributions are
strictly voluntary and are meant to be a painless
method of contributing to the drive. They are ad
mittedly of less importance than the personalized
solicitation and if they actually do create ill will, we

shall have fewer in the future. However, when people
make a big issue out of a relatively minor matter, it
could easily be just another opportunity to rationalize
general distaste of relief drives as such.
The organization of the drive wasn't perfect, but it
would have been sufficient if there were any social
consciousness at Stanford.
