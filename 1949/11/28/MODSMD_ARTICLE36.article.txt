To the Editor:
Congratulations on Breier's article of November 22.
Around the campus, I have often heard complaints
about Stanford's football, but no one desired to place
the blame. Breier did this in such a tactful way that
he deserves the congratulations of the whole student
body.
In the past year and in the coming two years, we
have had and will have the finest football material
on the Coast. Our fine last last year, which was sec
ond highest to Washington for violating the purity
code, and three consecutive undefeated freshman
teams prove this. Let's not waste this material! In
doing so we appear as fools in the eyes of the other
Conference schools.
As Mr. Breier pointed out, we defeated only one
major league opponent this year, and our failures on
the three others—Michigan, Santa Clara, and Cal—
were all due to lack of a tough line. It is easy to
point out that we had few good linemen, but whose
fault is this? If the varsity line were so thin, why
was the JV line so strong—strong enough to beat
Cfil? The point is that we have to have a rough and
tough coach to develop these men into varsity ma
terial. That the size, ability, and willingness are
there is proved by the success of these men under
Jim Cox and Chuck Taylor; that the training neces
sary after the jump to the varsity is not, is proved
by failures against all teams with good lines.
