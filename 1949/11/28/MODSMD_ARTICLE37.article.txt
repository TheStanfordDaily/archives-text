To the Editor:
I would like to take this means to thank the Asso
< iated Students as well as the Speech and Education
Departments in particular, for their wonderful co
operation in helping the Debate Society put over the
Western Speech Association Debate Tournament. All
of the forensic participants enjoyed their stay on the
Stanford campus very much, and expressed their
thanks for the help which so many of the student
and University organizations gave them.
This, the largest forensic tournament to be held on
the Pacific Coast this year, was a success from the
point of view of all concerned. The credit for its suc
cess belongs to the University as a whole, and
speaking for the Stanford Debate Society as well as
the Western Speech Association, I wish to express
our appreciation and thanks for the noble work
that was done.
