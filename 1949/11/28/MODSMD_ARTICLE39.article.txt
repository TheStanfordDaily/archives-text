# III-Treatment and Despair Is Lot of Chinese Soldier
## 
### DAVID WONG 
The Communists are yaining the upper hand in China, not be
cause their armies are qood, but because the Nationalist armies
are bad.
Nowhere in the world are soldiers treated the way they are in
the Nationalist armies. Perhaps to call them soldiers is a misnomer.

The men who go to make up the Na
tionalist armies no more resemble
soldiers than a herd of elephants re
sembles a chorus of ballet dancers.
While it is considered an honor to
be able to serve in most armies, it is
considered a disgrace to serve in the
Nationalist Army. Soldiers are feared
and hated by the people. Soldiers
loot and plunder wherever they go.
They bully and rob. They wreck
restaurants and theaters which re
fuse them free food and entertain
ment. They are fond of gun play
and frequently throw bombs in
public places.
Free Food or Starvation
However, in spite of all this, one
cannot blame the soldiers entirely.
They only bully as they are bullied.
They only demand free food and
drinks because they are virtually
starved. They only rob and loot be
cause their pay cannot buy the barest
necessities of life.
I have interviewed numerous sol
diers and ex-soldiers of the Na
tionalist armiesâ€”many of them de
serters.
One of the soldiers I interviewed
went to school with me in Malaya.
He returned to China at the end of
the war and there he was attracted
by a recruiting drive for "educated
young Chinese to form the occupa
tion force in Japan."
He enlisted, but got no further
than an army depot near Shanghai,
where for months he was forced to
do the work of coolie. He was fed
on a wretched diet and constantly
beaten with rifle butts because he
"couldn't work fast enough." Fi
nally he deserted.
"Honorable Discharge"
Discontent is by no means limited
to the soldiers. Many officers are

also dissatisfied with conditions. One
former colonel obtained an "hon
orable discharge" from the army by
bribing the doctor to certify him as
physically disabled. He said he could
not get a discharge otherwise, and
he was just sick of seeing the condi
tions under which his men existed.
According to one Nationalist sol
dier who deserted to the Communist
Army, and finally deserted from
them,he wanted no part of the civil
war because, regardless of which
side he was on, he would be killing
his own countrymen. In explaining
why he joined the Communists, he
said:
"If I have to fight, it is better to
fight on a full stomach."
The continuous defection of troops
is worrying the army authorities.
There is evidence of press gangs
being used to rope in new "recruits."
No one knows the exact strength of
the Nationalist Army, because it is
the practice among most of the army
commanders to add fictitious names
to their rolls. They can then pocket
the pay alloted to the imaginary men
by the Central government. Graft
and corruption are so rampant among
higher army officials that often sup
plies for the soldiers are sold en
block and the proceeds pocketed by
the few.
With conditions are they are, how
can the soldiers be expected to have
a will to fight, and how can the Na
tionalists hope to win?
