### JOHN BREIER DAILY SPORTS EDITOR 
Last week I came out with the stand that Stanford would remain a sec
ond-rate football team as long as certain coaching methods remained in
i fleet. I narrowed it down to one individual, the head line coach.
Since then two San Francisco papers picked up the "news and com
mented on it. Neither one hit what I think to be the center ot the contro
versy.
One columnist printed part of this column. That is a dangerous business.
It is so easy to pick out the "meaty" parts of a piece and yet leave out
the motivating thought.
My criticism is not with the 1949 football season. It is with head line
coach Phil Bengtson and his work during the last three seasons. I've
been close to the team during thai period, and know whereof I speak.
If Stanford lacks the horses, and I believe it does—up to a point—then
it is the job of the line coach to develop men to meet the situation, Bengt
son is not the man for this job.
Before I wrote last week's piece, I asked many of the linemen what
they thought of Bengtson. Six or seven came out with comments such as,
"He's no good; he doesn't help me as an individual; he never- tells me
v/hat I'm doing wrong, etc." (I'll elaborate on this later.)
N«il one said, ''He's a swell guy, I like him, he has done me a lot of
good."
Mos( of them replied, and this is the heart of the whole controversy,
' Well, I don't know. I don't have much against him .... He's all right,
I guess. He has never done me any great harm, etc."
And that is exactly what players should not think about a line coach
II is a lukewarm attitude at best, and not one that makes for rough, tough
line play.
The approval lust week's column received among the student body was
t-) be expected. These are the men and women who have seen Stanford
lines play poor, yes poor, ball lor the last three years. How often fans
have left the Stadium asking, "Why is there blocking, why
can't we spring our backs loose for long runs?"
Improvement in '49? Who Caused II?
And this year? Yes, the story was a bit different. The blocking was
good in spots. Several times we sprang White and DeYoung loose. But
when we ran up against a team with a rough, hard-charging line, we lost
Stanford fans look to the USC game as the highlight of the season.
There, for a time, it looked as if Stanford finally could block and tackle.
And who was responsible for that showing? Not Phil "I know what
you are doing wrong, but it's a secret" Bengtson. No. It was a quiet
spoken new arrival who, when he sees that a player is not catching on,
takes the individual aside and shows him the right way to carry out
(he block or penetrate the defense.
That man is "Dutch" Fehring. Nobody bothers to find out his first name.
After his first week as assistant line coach, the players knew they had a
man who both knew and could teach line play.
In fact, they thought so much of him that they gave him, not the head
line coach, the game ball for his work in the downfall of Troy. That game
meant a lot to the players. They won it and the first person they credited
with the win was "Dutch," who had planned the defense and told the
boys just what to do.
My complaint, that is just what it is, is not against Bengtson's football
knowledge. He might have it. It is rather against the way he handles new
men.
Interesting thought .... Stanford is weak in reserves. Cal is strong
in reserves. Yet Jim Cox's Braves, Stanford's fourth and fifth strings,
beat Cel's fourth and fifth strings, 26 to 21. Where else but in the fourth
and fifth strings should reserve strength show up.
Mentioning names of Braves who I think could and should have been
playing varsity ball would only embarrass the boys. But they are typical
examples of Bengtsonism.
If Filbert doesn't like the boy's way of play, speed, he is sent to the
jayvees. Stanford never cuts a man from the squad. A better coach would
spend some time with the player. Invite him to come out of practice a
little before the rest of the boys and spend 10 or 20 minutes with him. Of
course, that means the coach would have to come out early. Oh well, to
heck with it, let's plead "no reserves."
I am only here pointing out the cause for the effect Stanford fans have
been seeing for the past three years. I could say four years, but I myself
had no connection with the team in 1946. Since then I have attended
rnulti practice sessions.
One S.F. writer comments that Stanford did not see fit to complain
when, in 1947, it last every game. No. and The Daily did not complain in
print last year. There were high hopes of a successful 1949 season. But
it did not materialize.
True we ended up with a 6-3-1 record. But the losses and tie were to
teams that play football the way it is meant to be played. If Stanford is
to compete with the nation's best, it must play the game their way—and
most of those games are won up front.
Up to Student Hotly
But I. for one. hesitated to act in the middle of the season. Nothing can
be gained but to disrupt the task of playing football.
Now it is different. If Stanford is to win, now is the time to effect a
change—if it is needed. I think it is. I think most of the student body
wants a change. At least many of the members have told me so.
And will there be a change? Aye, here is the crux of the argument. I
can only hope so. It is up to Marchie Schwartz and A 1 Masters to make
the move. They will do so only if they know that the student body and
alumni are dissatisfied. Maybe not even then. That is the way things are
lun around here. The alumni are not too happy about that arrangement,
and the support of the school lags for that reason. They would like to
have more of a say if they are to contribute money and effort. But that
i.s another story.
My contention is that Stanford will not win under the present set-up.
I hale to see good frosh line material "promoted" into the hands of such
as Bengtson. These boys have much to learn. They need an under
standing teacher, one who will take the time to point out their individual
faults and praise them when they do well.
And, they should be given the chance to play under someone they can
like, someone they can want to play for, someone who can develop them.
I suggest Chuck Taylor, Jim Cox, or "Dutch" Fehring.
