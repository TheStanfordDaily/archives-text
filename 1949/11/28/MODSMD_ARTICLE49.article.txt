# Indian Basketball Squad Opens Season Thursday
## COP Tests Cards in First Contest; San Jose, Stewart Chevrolet Follow 
### 
Stanford's varsity cage men will
romp into their last lap of pre-sea
son practice sessions this afternoon
when they get together for their
usual 4 to 6 o'clock workout in the
Pavilion.
The Indians will open their 1949-
50 basketball season on the home
Hoor next Thursday niglit against
the College of Pacific Tigers, and
will then go on to complete a hectic
fii-st week with San Jose State on
Saturday night and Stewart Chev
rolet on Tuesday.
It will be the first time in three

years that Stanford has not first
nighted with an easy opener against
the alumni, but because of a new
conference ruling which prohibited
any games before December 1,
Coach Dean wanted to make sure
his men got a true test in their first
trip to Ihe post. Thus, he dropped
the alums in favor of COP.
The Tigers, riding the crest of an
accentuated athletic program, as
evidenced in their football product,
figure to floor an equally potent cage
quintet as well.'
Last season College of Pacific gave
Stanford a bad enough time of it
as it was, but blond George Yardley
kept the hoop hot with a 22-point
evening, which final'y brought
Stanford a G5-56 win, although the
contest was in constant doubt.
This time out, the Stockton boys

promise to offer even more worries.
In fact, Stanford's entire first week
of scheduled games stacks up ns a
rugged ride. Both San Jose State
and Stewart Chevrolet lost lone
pointers to the Reds last year, and
will be back with bigger and better
attacks this time.
But that's just what the Cards
want. They've got a new fast-break
offense to try out, and they want to
do so against the strongest opposi
tion they can find.
