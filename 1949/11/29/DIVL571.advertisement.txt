J. Paul Sheedy* Switched to Wildroot Cream-Oil
Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test ?
YOU'D never guess to see him now, but just two weeks ago
there was a sad, forlorn look in Sheedy's heady eyes. People
picked on him because his hair looked like he was moulting.
Not a gal on catnpus would even carrion a conversat ion with
him. Then he bought a bottle of Wildroot Cream-Oil hair
tonic and he's been a gay old bird ever since. Non-alcoholic
Wildroot containing Lanolin keeps hair neat and well groomed
all day long. Relieves annoying dryness, removes the loose
ugly dandruff that can make you a social outcast. So if your OuZyi
hair is giving you trouble, set your corpse for the nearest drug EfSSgl !
or toilet goods counter and get a bottle or tube of Wildroot ( 112 TraTj J,
Cream-Oil hair tonic. And ask your barber for professional nt I
implications. Its the best treatment your hair cadaver get. v
