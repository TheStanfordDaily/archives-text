## Nationalists Halt Reds 
### 
CHUNGKING, Nov. 28 (A*)â€” De
sperate Chinese Nationalist defenders
today cheeked the Red rush on this
chaotic capital less than 20 miles
from Chungking's gates, the govern
ment asserted.
The reprieve will give the few top
officials still in Chungking time to
fly tomorrow to Chengtu. That city,
170 miles to the northwest, will be
the government's next stopping
place.
As far as is known, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek still is here direct
ing the city's defenses. Planes wait
at the airport to take him and other
leaders away.
