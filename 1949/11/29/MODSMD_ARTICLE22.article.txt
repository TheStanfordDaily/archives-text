Celebrating its third anniversary
November (Â», the West's only non
profit. public service and app'ied re
search center, the Stanford Research
Institute, has mushroomed into a $2
million a year activity which is still
growing.
When SI?I was launched three
years ago it occupied three rooms
in the "Physics Building. Now, at its
present location, at the east en
trance to Stanford Village, it covers
45,000 square feet of laboratories
and administration ofTices and has
a staff of 255 employees, mostly
technical personnel.
In its brief history the Institute
has worked on 80 major projects, 45
having been completed, and the re
maining 35 in various stages of de
velopment. Some 20 per cent of
its work is for the government. Re
cently comp'cled was SRl's first
project, research on the genetics and
physiology of guayulc, a shrub un
der development as a source of nat
ural rubber. The result is a new
technique for grafting new hybrids,
and a more complete understanding
of the manner in which rubber is
"manufactured" in guayule.
Business Promotion
In 11)48, at the same time that
three senior faculty members and a
prominent alumnus were urging the
administration to establish a re
search institute, businessmen were
canvassing leading West Coast in
dustrialists in the interests of a flex
ible research organization that could
furnish the diverse technical serv
ices needed in the Pacific states.
These two groups got together and
the Stanford Research Institute re
sulted.
The present list of 30 members of
the SRl's board of directors reads
like a list from "Who's Who in West.

Coast Business and Industry." A
few notables are: Donald W. Doug
las Jr., vice-prcsidcnt, Douglas Air
craft Co.; W. P. Fuller Jr.. chair
man of the board. W. P. Fuller Co.;
R. G. Follis, vice-chairman. Stand
aid Oil of California; William L.
Stewart Jr., executive vice-presi
dent, Union Oil Co. of California;
Mark R. Sullivan, president, The
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Co.; and Lingan A. Warren, presi
dent, Safeway Stores Inc.
Sterling Is Head
Chairman of the SRI board is Dr.
Wallace Sterling, and vice-chairman
is Stanford's vice-president, Louis
B. Lundborg. Although prominent
University lenders are active on the

Institute's board of directors, there
is no financial tie with the Univer
sity.
Once started, the Institute was the
recipient of some worthy and valu
able gifts such as the private labo
ratory and library of the late Dr.
Frederick G. Cottrell. and a valu
able loan including an electron mi
croscope capable of magnifications
up to 50,000 diameters. On lease
from the Army's Ordnance Depart
ment, SRI has over a quarter-mil
lion dollars' worth of accurate meas
urement equipment for its Precision
Gage Laboratory.
In addition to its facilities for at
tacking scientific problems, the SRI j
can also tackle problems of an eco- j

lomic nature through its Depart
ment of Business and Industrial
Economics.
Recent Studies
Among recent activities have been
studies of fruit marketing and dis
tribution, a cost study on personne
training methods, and the recom
mendation to a Bay Area city that it
improve its docking and warehous
ing facilities.
As a nonprofit organization, thf
Stanford Research Institute does its
work on a cost plus overhead basis
and at the age of three now stand'
as an established, independent in
stitution contributing in good meas
ure to the economic development of
industry, the West, and the nation.


THE STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE, here pictured, is the scene of a number of projects solv
ing present-day scientific problems. Located in Stanford Village, the SRI was founded in 1948
by a group of prominent alumni and West Coast businessmen.
