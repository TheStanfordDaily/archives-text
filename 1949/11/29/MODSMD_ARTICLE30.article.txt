# On Correcting Concert Conditions
## 
### 
Last week's concert by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra was one of the finest ever
presented in the Memorial Auditorium. It is
unfortunate that the program was marrod by
conditions that could easily be corrected.
In the first place, the makeshift shell provided
as a background for the orchestra amounts to
nothing less than an affront to the audience and
orchestra alike. Acoustically, it is necessary
that such a shell be provided to project to the
audience the full tonal beauty of the orchestra.
But it is unforgiveable that the shell is discol
ored, dirty, and in every way unsightly.
It does not seem to us that the Committee on
Public Exercises would be overextending itself
if it were to arrange for a new, attractive paint
job on the shell.
Secondly, there were countless unoccupied
seats in the orchestra section, a situation that
is surprising at a University where so many are
supposedly appreciative of the arts. Perhaps
many students who would have attended had

left the campus for Thanksgiving. Maybe the
concert followed too closely after the Big Game
festivities.
Then again, is $2.40 for an orchestra seat
100 steep for Stanford students?
It is a fact that ticket sales in Palo Alto fell
far below expectations. This has been offered
as a possible reason for the unsold orchestra
seats.
In view of this, plus the fact that the balcony
was jam-packed, it would seem logical that
concert tickets are over-priced. The concerts
are presented at Stanford and should be pri
marily for the enjoyment and appreciation of
Stanford students.
If the Committee on Public Exercises cannot
fill the Auditorium at present ticket prices for
such an outstanding attraction as the San Fran
cisco Symphony, they should lower the prices.
Better to have a sell out at lower prices and
permit more people to enjoy the concerts, than
to have empty, unappreciative seats at higher
prices. J.L.
