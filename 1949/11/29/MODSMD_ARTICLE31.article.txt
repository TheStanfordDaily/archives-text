# CAMPUS OPINION
## Village Activities Committee 
### 
To the Editor:
In a recent letter to the editor of The Daily com
menting on the failure of the Village Election Rally, it
was implied that the Village Activities Committee was
in some way responsible for the lack of an audience.
Such was not the case. The VAC was by-passed
entirely by those conducting the elections.
At this time, we would like to take the opportunity
to note the lack of co-operation between the various
campus organizations and the Village. The VAC
was set up for the purpose, among other things, of
facilitating and co-ordinating matters pertaining to
the social and political life of the Village. VAC has
at least one representative in each building in the
Village, close contact with The Daily and the Menlo
Park Recorder, besides being organized to handle all
matters through our central office located in the coun
selor's office in the Administration Building of the
Village. Office hours are 2-3 p.m., daily. Our phone
number is DA 3-9451, Extension 53.
If campus organizations will consult us pertaining
to Village activities, the VAC will be more than
willing to place at their disposal VAC publicity and
office facilities.
Here's for closer co-operation in the future. Let's
not have another election foul-up!
