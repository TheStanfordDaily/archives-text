# Relief Drive

To the Editor:
One important factor has been overlooked in the
recent Hurry of criticism against the Stanford Relief
Fund Drive. That is that a large minority of Stanford
students—those who live off-campus—were never
personally solicited, to my knowledge.
A goal is set in terms of the total enrollment. Even
if every person in the Village or in on-campus resi
dences were contacted, which was not the case, only
three-fifths of the enrollment would have been per
sonally solicited. It is not surprising that the goal
was not reached.
