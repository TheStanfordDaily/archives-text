# Rent I Decontrol
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The telegram below was sent yesterday to Gov
ernor Warren by my landlady. As one graduate stu
dent concerned, and on behalf of many others in the
same position, I wish to use The Daily as a medium
of publicity to ask University officials to study the
local housing situation as it affects students before
decontrol becomes a fact and causes undue hardship
on those of us who have no local franchise and no
way to void the burden of rent increases which surely
will be shifted to us. In the meantime, an official tele
gram to the governor requesting delay* of action on
the resolution would be appropriate at this late date.
