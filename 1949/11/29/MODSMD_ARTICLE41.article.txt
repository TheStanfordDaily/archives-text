Of every 11 persons who go to the
Scabbard and Blade 'lurkey Shoot
tomorrow, Thursday, or Friday, one
of them will win an order for a
turkey that will be good any time
between now and Christmas.
The shoot will take place at the
ROTC rifle range, beyond the soccer
field and the varsity tennis courts,
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on each of the
three days. Signs will be posted
pointing out the way to the shooting
grounds.
Women will be given the advan
tage of being able to shoot from the
prone position while men will be re
quired to kneel or sit. As a conces
sion to neophyte shooters, the nov
ices may choose to use a "garbled"
target, in which the scores will be
so jumbled as to provide an element
of chance.
Each $1 ticket will entitle the
contestant, any student or faculty
member, to two shots.
Judges of the contest will be Dr.
Raymond D. Harriman, Dean of
Classics; Colonel James V. Collier,
U.S.A.; Lt. Col. Samuel E. Vaughan,
U.S.A.; Major Clifford F. Quilici,
U.S.M.C; and Major Jacob A Huch
inson, U.S.A.F.
