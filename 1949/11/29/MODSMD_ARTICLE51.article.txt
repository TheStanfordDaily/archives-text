# Varsity Sliced to Twelve For Opener Against COP
## Gasaba Season Opens Thursday 
### 
Two important developments af
fected yesterday's basketball session
as Stanford prepared for its Thurs
day night opener against College of
Pacific.
I irst, Everett Dean posted his of
ficial varsity squad list, which sliced
his team total to 12, including five
seniors, two juniors, and five soph
omores.
Second, Harry the Hipster Huga
sian reported lor his first afternoon
of cage work. Hugasian, who was a
prep sparkler in basketball as well
as football, did not play the former
as a frosh. so yesterday was his first
official entry into the Stanford cage
picture.
With the Braves
Hugasian was placed immediately
with the Braves, but if he shows
enough stuff he will be upped to
the front ranks. Those close to the
scene believe that Harry will be of
great aid to the cagers later in the
season. He is a natural athlete, has
a good shooting eye, and possibly
could be an important reserve for
the strength-sapping fast break.
Other developments were also
breaking last night. Dean an
announeed that tonight and to
morrow night will he "big scrim
mage mollis." He also nominated
a tentative first string consisting
ot George Yard ley and Jim Walsh
at forwards, Ralph Carver at cen
ter, and Gus Chavalas and Marv
Gelber at guards.
Should Start
These five men will undoubtedly
be in the starting lineup against
College of Pacific, though Dean ex
pects to use speed men Gay Bryan
and Jack O'Sullivan right along
with the starters.
Thursday night's opener will be
accompanied by two prelims, as the
Stanford Braves meet Modesto at
6, and the Stanford frosh hook up
with Antioch High in an afternoon
game.
The varsity and Braves squad lists
are as follows:
Varsity team — Gary Andrews,
Gay Bryan, Ralph Carver, Gus
Chavalas, Dick Clegg, Ron Garver,
Marv Gelber, Bruce Iverson, Jack
O'Sullivan, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh, and George Yardley.

Two important developments af
fected yesterday's basketball session
as Stanford prepared for its Thurs
day night opener against College of
Pacific.
I irst, Everett Dean posted his of
ficial varsity squad list, which sliced
his team total to 12, including five
seniors, two juniors, and five soph
omores.
Second, Harry the Hipster Huga
sian reported lor his first afternoon
of cage work. Hugasian, who was a
prep sparkler in basketball as well
as football, did not play the former
as a frosh. so yesterday was his first
official entry into the Stanford cage
picture.
With the Braves
Hugasian was placed immediately
with the Braves, but if he shows
enough stuff he will be upped to
the front ranks. Those close to the
scene believe that Harry will be of
great aid to the cagers later in the
season. He is a natural athlete, has
a good shooting eye, and possibly
could be an important reserve for
the strength-sapping fast break.
Other developments were also
breaking last night. Dean an
announeed that tonight and to
morrow night will he "big scrim
mage mollis." He also nominated
a tentative first string consisting
ot George Yard ley and Jim Walsh
at forwards, Ralph Carver at cen
ter, and Gus Chavalas and Marv
Gelber at guards.
Should Start
These five men will undoubtedly
be in the starting lineup against
College of Pacific, though Dean ex
pects to use speed men Gay Bryan
and Jack O'Sullivan right along
with the starters.
Thursday night's opener will be
accompanied by two prelims, as the
Stanford Braves meet Modesto at
6, and the Stanford frosh hook up
with Antioch High in an afternoon
game.
The varsity and Braves squad lists
are as follows:
Varsity team — Gary Andrews,
Gay Bryan, Ralph Carver, Gus
Chavalas, Dick Clegg, Ron Garver,
Marv Gelber, Bruce Iverson, Jack
O'Sullivan, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh, and George Yardley.
