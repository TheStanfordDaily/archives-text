## The
						Front Row The
						Rumblings Are Mounting; So Let's Take a Good Look at the Past Record 
### 
As of now, Stanford's football coaching staff—Minnesota Phil Bengtson
in particular—is being placed in the middle of a nasty and unpleasant
controversy. It is unfortunate, but it is necessary.
Rumblings of dissatisfaction, first seeing life in small gatherings of sec
ond-guessing Monday mourners, has been gathering steam steadily, and
yesterday the rumble burst into a full-fledged roar.
Such noise, of course, was prompted by Sport.-. Editor John Breier's
columns of yesterday and a week ago Tuesday. Breier stated that Stan
ford would remain a second-rate football team as long as present coaching
methods remained in effect.
Let me hasten to add that he was not the first nor the only person to feel
this way. However, I do not believe that centering the entire situation
upon Phil Bengtson is right. Bengtson is an assistant. Good or bad, he is
an assistant.
It is the job of the head coach and the athletic director to make sure
that the assistants are the right men. Marchie Schwartz is the head coach.
Al Masters is the athletic director. If the staff is a failure, then they are
failures.
It is unfortunate that punk undergraduate writers must come out and
criticize men known and respected in their profession. It does not look
good. But it is apparent that something must be said. It should also be
apparent that these feelings have not sprung up overnight. For many per
sons, these thoughts have been nursed along for a period of from two to
to three years.
So, it is time .for a good healthy discussion of the facts. That type of
thing never hurt anybody. Presidents of nations face elections regularly.
Prime ministers can be removed by a majority vote. Baseball managers
face rejection every time they lose. So do football coaches.
If they are not getting results, out they go. If they are getting results,
they get a vote of confidence. It's a healthy situation.
No More Gushing
Those persons who remember the Frank Wickhorst incident at California
and who always say, "No-no, not here at Stanford," are not quite getting
the right slant. It is not the same situation. I, for one, am sick of the"He
Loses But They Love Him" type of sticky goo we are supposed to gush
out here on the Farm.
We want to win. Just as much as California. And as much as USC.
And as much as UCLA. All three of which demand that Iheir coaches
always get the best results.
So, let's talk about it. If Schwartz and his staff are judged to be getting
the best possible results, then give them a vote of conlidence and get
behind them. If not, as past records seem to indicate, remove them or see
that necessary changes are made.
Marchie's records are in black and white. Since taking over as headman
in 1942, he has in five years won only 22, lost 25, and tied 2.
Even Tiny Thornhill, whose record during his last five years was con
sidered to be the poorest in Stanford's football history, was not that bad.
In that period, Thornhfll won 18, lost 21, and tied 5. And Tiny, at least,
had three earlier Rose Bowl teams to fall back on.
In 1939, whei. Thornhill had failed to produce, the powers-that-be finally
lose above those same "NO MATERIAL" cries of loyal defenders and
bounced him. They were rewarded the very next season with 10 wins
and an undfeated untied, Rose Bowl champ.
During Schwartz's five-year reign, Stanford has suffered many disap
pointments. Never has a team been so hot and cold, so unpredictable, so
up and down, so unreliable as Stanford has been under the present staff.
A Few Outstanding Blue k Marks
The following stand out as low spots:
1. Stanford dropped every game in 1947, including a 19-1G loss to Idaho,
which ranks as Stanford's most miserable football failure.
2. Uninspired and sloppy play throughout 1948, and especially against
San Jose State, a team against which the Cards barely eked-out in the
final moments, 2G-20.
3. Seemingly unnecessary losses in 1948 to Washington State (14-7) and
to Santa Clara (27-14), games in which Stanford turned in poor, listle. s
football.
4. A pathetic intersectional record, with a 43-0 loss to Army and 49-13
and 27-7 losses to Michigan standing out.
5. This season's loss to UCLA (14-7).
These are only the outstanding black marks. Others could point out
many more. What is the cause? Certainly, it isn't the coaching alone.
Schwartz, Bengtson, Fehring, Elward. and Hammett are good sound football
men. They played the game. They played it well. And they know it well.
But, something is wrong with their product. Some say it is because
Stanford lacks material. I can't go along with that. Stanford has had three
straight undefeated frosh teams, has not lost a jayvee game to California
in three seasons, and has received its share of the best JC transfers in
these parts. (Rupe Andrews, Jim Castagnoli, Ken Rose, Hart Cook, Bruce
Van Alstyne, and Russ Pomeroy. Not to mention Gordon Rice who switched
from Santa Clara.)
Why does Stanford always end up "LACKING THE DEPTH," "NOT
HAVING THE PUSH UP FRONT," or (I hate this term) "LACKING THE
HORSES"??
Horses? We've got 'em. Maybe Stanford just needs somebody to saddle
'em. Sometimes a change in jockeys can turn a plug into a Seabiscuit.
Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just takes a long time to get started.
