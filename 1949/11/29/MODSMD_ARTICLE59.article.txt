# Bakery Proceeds Go To Farm Con Home
## 
### CARYL HARMS 
Plump people with a yen for cream puffs and chocolate cake
have found a conscience-easer in the new Stanford Convalescent
Home Bakery in San Francisco.
Every pastry sold at the 710 Post Street shop provides a con
tribution to the Con Home here on campus, for all the bakery's

profits are turned over to that insti
tution.
The bakery is the idea of the San
Francisco Auxiliary to the Stanford
Convalescent Home and is its first
full-time project. Early this fall the
group began to investigate the possi
bilities of opening a bakery that
would operate on a sound paying
basis and raise funds for the Home.
Old Shop Redone
They located the Old Vienna Pas
try Shop, closed since January, and
learned that it was formerly oper
ated by the Plantation. Arrange
ments were made to rent it from the
Plantation and to have the latter's
baker do the baking right in the
building, directly behind the shop.
Five thousand invitations were
sent out to announce the shop's
opening on October 18. Bakery cus
tomers found new coats of paint and
new showcases insid", along with
volunteer salesgirls—members of the
Auxiliary — dressed in neat white
uniforms with the legend "Stanford
Convalescent Home" on the lapels.
Confection Variety
The new bakery offers every type
of confection, and also fills orders for

wedding, birthday, and holiday
cakes, for baked hams, turkeys, small
sandwiches for teas, and canapes for
cocktail parties.
Open hours are Tuesday through
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Auxiliary members are required to
give half a day, once a month to the
shop, where two salesgirls arc on
duty at all times. Mrs. Walton Law
rence is general chairman of the
bakery project.
Among the Auxiliary's other en
terprises to raise money for the Home
is its annual, highly popular, spring
Barn Dance, which will continue to
be one of its major undertakings,
along with the bakery.
