WASHINGTON —An engineering
plan for a. plant designed to create
the scarce atomic materials that
make the A-bomb explode has been
put on paper, the Atomic Energy
Commission said today.
The AEC declared that prelimi
nary work toward construction of an
actual "experimental breeder"—or
creator - of atomic materials is start
ing immediately. Dr. Lawrence Haf
stad, director of the Commission's
reactor program, declared that the
designers were confident it would
work.
