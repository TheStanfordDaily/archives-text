# 'Secret's Out! KZSU's "Sadie' Reveals Identity
## 
### 
Stanford Sadie, KZSU's most I
carefully guarded secret, revealed
her true name last night as she
fried the seductress' role for the last
time.
Carle Forslew, a junior from La
throp, tossed her blonde tresses and
told all. The tall, blue-eyed lass
with the deep, enchanting voice has
been sending shivers up male spines
for the last quarter.
"Yes," said Carle yesterday,"I
have some comments on the job.
But they aren't printable."
Carle, the sixth Sadie, was chosen
at the beginning of fall quarter
when she walked into the KZSU
studios on a dare. After she had
tried out, she was amazed to hear
the words, "You're Stanford Sadie."
Sadie's identity was seriously
threatened only once this quarter.
On the night of her first broadcast,

said Carle, a band of freshmen tried j
to raid the studio. They were re- j
pulsed before they reached her, but '
one of them saw her name on a |
notebook. He threatened to tell the
world. Thinking quickly, the KZSU
staff signed him as a member and
swore him to secrecy.
Tryouts for a new seductress will
be held at the beginning of next |
quarter and will be announced in |
The Daily.
