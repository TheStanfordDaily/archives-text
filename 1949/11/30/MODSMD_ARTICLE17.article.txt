# Four Students Brave Mt. Shasta in Storm
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Four Stanford students huddled
together for 18 hours Thanksgiving
Day in the thin, raw air of 12,000
feet when they were trapped by a
raging blizzard on Ml. Shasta.
Dwighl Crowder led the members
of the Alpine Club who pitched a
two-man mountain tent on a tiny
ledge hewn out of a ridge summit*
Wind velocity was so great that it
threatened to blow the lent off the
precipice to a glacier 1,000 feet be
low.
(•asoline Freezes
The only protection the party had
from the extreme cold was a tiny
gasoline stove that was constantly
being upset by the wind billowing
up under the canvas floor. Their
gasoline supply froze into a jelly,
said they found tlieir ice axe out
side the tent with two inches of ice
coating the head.
They skied to the height at which
the climb began, l;ut were turned
back 2,000 feet short of the summit.
Karl StaufTer, a member of the ex
pedition, said, "It woidd have been
suicide to try to go on, but I hope
that we can go back and finish the
climb some day."
Turkey and Wind
The holiday spirit was preserved
in a hut at the base of the mountain

where they prepared for the 14,000-
foot climb willt (lie aid of turkey
and all the trimmings.
Six climbers from the Alpine
Club, Dave Marrah, Sherman Leh
man, Dick Stark, Nick C'ineh, Hugh
DrWitt, and John Mowal, had ex
cellent weather for their trip to
Castle r 'rags, but their Thanksgiving
appetites suffered with pemmican,
emergency rations, and crackers.
This group successfully com
pleted ;i first ascent to an unclimbcd
pinaccle which they named Stark
Tower after Dick Stark and the ac
tual slackness of the rock. It, is ap
proximately 6,000 feet in height.
The climbers c aimed another first,
when ihey pitched camp higher than
anyone had ever camped in that
area before. Their location made
possib'e the ascent of two peaks,
Index Finger and Knife Blade.

coating the head.

that we can go back and finish the
climb some day."
