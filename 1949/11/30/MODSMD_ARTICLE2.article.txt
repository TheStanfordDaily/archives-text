# Cominform Hits Tito
## 
### 
MOSCOW â€” The Comlnform en
joined Communists everywhere to
day to back an all-out effort to un
seat Yugoslav Premier Marshal Tito.
It called, too, for a decisive struggle
against Titoists in the party ranks.
Far from yielding to any qualms
of national Communist elements, the
Cominform demanded strict disci
pline everywhere. It declared it was
the "international duty" of all Com
munists to aid to the utmost those
Yugos'av workers fighting for a res
urrection of orthodox Communist
doctrine in Yugoslavia.
