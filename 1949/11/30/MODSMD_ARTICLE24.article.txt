# Chorus Best In Fast, Loud Movements
## 
### HOLLY HASTE 
A recital of varied and challenging
works was given by the University
Chorus last night as one of the usual
Tuesday Evening Series features.
The program was well chosen to
display the youthful exuberance of a
group of ,for the most part, untrained
singers. The vitality of the men's
sections was especially marked.
Only on occasion, however, did the
program attain the precision and so
nority necessary for a truly artistic
result.
The troupe of nearly 200 singers
was most at ease in the fast-moving
and spirited selections, Handel's "The
Foolish Lover," and the "Working
Chorus" from Benjamin Britten's
opera, "Peter Grimes."
The most ambitious undertakings
were the three selections from Bach's
"Mass in B Minor." Any professional
chorus has trouble meeting the re
quirements of this work, and consid
ering all factors, last night's perform
ance was adequate.
The various sections of the chorus
were too absorbed in their own parts
to feel what the other sections were
doing, and the result was not one of an
organic whole as Bach intended it.
The singers seemed not quite aware
of what they were building towards
in the contrapuntal passages. How
ever, there were portions of the
"Crucifixus" that were excellent.
There was much lacking in the
contemplative and quieter parts of
the program. The "Palestrina Sanctus
et. Hosanna" did not achieve the sim
plicity and purity called for in this
early religious music.
The most successful selection was
the group of numbers from "La Be'le
Hellene" by Offenbach.
The chorus performed its part well
and the four soloists were well aware
of the dramatic sequence and ful
filled it. Harold Schmidt's directing
techniques seem a bit theatrical oc
casionally, but he held the attention
of his singers.
