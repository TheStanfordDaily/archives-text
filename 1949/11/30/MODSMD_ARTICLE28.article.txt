ment slips.
Lists Work Well
The class list system is working
very well," said Registrar H. Donald
Winbigler yesterday."It was felt that
the system would be simpler and
more efficient than the seat card
method, and the net result would be
the same."
Under this plan, class lists for both
divisions must be signed at the Nitery
for all courses which formerly would
have required seat cards. The stu
dent will be assured of a place in
these classes.
The Nitery will be open for gradu
ate and upper-division students from
8:30 a.m. to noon and from 1 to 4:30
p.m. today.
