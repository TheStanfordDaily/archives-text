# Honor Code Policy
## 
### 
The Daily has been questioned as to the in
tent behind running the cartoon captioned "An
Honest Man Ain't Gotta Chance" in yesterday's
paper. Many persons have taken the view that
The Daily was making a backhanded slap at the
Honor Code.
As a matter of fact, nothing could be further
from the truth, but the idea that so many people,
including the Honor Code Standing Commit
tee, have taken it seriously, makes it necessary
that we explain ourselves.
The cartoons are drawn by Dick liibler, a
student at the University of Kansas. He syndi
cates them to college newspapers all over the
country in the same way that features like
"They'll Do It Every Time" and "Dick Tracy"
are syndicated to metropolitan papers.
Bibler's " Worthal" cartoons are bought in lots
of 50. We think they make a worthwhile addi
tion to The Daily. Most readers will agree.
The 'Honest Man" cartoon run yesterday is

one of the few received that is not applicable to
the situation at Stanford but it was run anyway
because we had paid for it, and because we be
lieved that most people, understanding that it
was not a specially-drawn local product, would
appreciate the humor in it. To some extent we
were mistaken.
The Daily wishes to apologize for any con
fusion the cartoon may have caused. Like the
rest of the campus, we are 100 per cent btehind
the Honor Code. We believe it to be one of
Stanford's finest traditions.
The fact that a cartoon which makes a sap
out of a person who stays up all night studying
lor an exam in hopes of passing it honestly,
should be appropriate on so many campuses
that someone would syndicate it. is something
that should be brought to the attention of every
Stanford student.
At Stanford an honest man does have a
chance. We're glad that he does. Let's keep
it that way.
