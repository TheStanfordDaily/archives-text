# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Every once in a while I get pangs of remorse con
cerning my role iri life. What 1 mean to say simply is
that writing Bull Session is not all that it is cracked
up to be. There comes a time when you feel like you
need a chanae.

So, when a friend of mine sug
gested the other day that drama
would be nice, I had half a mind to
go over to Mem Aud and try out
for one of those plays you read
about. But then I thought to my
self— who would want anybody
with half a mind?
However, I've always been in
terested in drama. Just the other
day I had a great idea for an orig
inal play starring nothing but

Stanford women. It could be called "PlGmaiion."
So much for drama. I guess I could really do some
thing constructive and hit the Libe for a little study
time.
I notice that it's about time for such action as that
famous Best Seller—The Time Schedule i:; once again
with us.

The thought is terrifying. It seems like only yes
terday that I bought my Looks, looked at my rebates,
and then tossed the works into the closet to allow the
worms to get down to business.
I'm so happy with my present classes. I wish it was
like the SAC and we never had to change. I've got
one prof who is really a great guy. Actually, he should
be an optometrist—every time he has a couple of
glasses, he makes a spectacle of himself .
So much for study. It was a strain just talking
about it.

There's a story floating around The Daily Shack
about one of the funniest typographical butches of
recent times.
It concerns the Temple University News, which was
explaining the availability of a new campus building.
"Toilets are available in the gymnasium building only.
II you are interested in arrangements for reservations,
contact the office of the dean of students for written
approval."
All I've got to say is: maybe things aren't so bad
at Stanford after all.
