To the Editor:
In the past week The Daily sports editor has written
some uncomplimentary things about the Stanford
coaching staff. He has indicated in his articles,that the
Stanford football team agrees with him in his stind.
The team does not agree with him—some individuals
may—but the team does not.
We, the team, weald like to ask The Daily sports
editor to refrain from using us us a background for
his articles. If he has found some bali players who
agree with him, let him quote them directly, but we
violently object to anyone using the team's name —
directly or by inference—to carry on a personal grudge
battle against one of our coaches.
We are not denying John Breier's right to say what
he wants when he wants to. But we do protest against
his intimating that we share his views. We do not,
and we would like to go on record as saying so.
Signed for the team and with the permission of
the team:
