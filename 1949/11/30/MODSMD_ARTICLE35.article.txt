Do you believe the Saturday Evening Post? We

don't, John Hall doesn't, Breier is doubtful, but unfor
tunately many of our alumni do. Do you love "him"
even though we're playing for Pineapples instead of
Roses? Let's define this indefinite "something" that
should be done. We need a new coach and competent
assistant coaches. If we do this "something" now, we
can make our Pasadena reservations for next season
at the same time. How long are we going to be told

Apparently everyone else, including the team, is
content to let this program of coach-crucifying go on
unchecked. However, please let a graduate student
raise a quiet voice of protest. As Hall pointed out, the
team lost every game in 1947, had a hard time working
out a tough schedule last year, and this year muffed
one to UCLA. Now to me, that looks like progress.
And again, from national obscurity last year, the team
has 1 isen to 12th in the nation. That still appears to be
progress. A look at the conference statistics notes the
team first and second in offense and defense. And in
conference standings, its second ranking above a team
that defeated Michigan State, a school of some fame.
As to the Cal and Michigan losses, where's the dis
honor there? All who saw the games recognized them
as second and fifth in the country, and justly so.
Note the number of Ail-Americans and such like that
have sprung from those two lines.
We can sympathize with frustrated .seniors who want
to spend their days telling their kids of the "immortal"
teams that played while they attended blessed old S.U.
But more concern is due the coaches, whose profes
sional careers can he ruined by a couple of immature
sports writers. Have patience. That outfit's coming
along.
