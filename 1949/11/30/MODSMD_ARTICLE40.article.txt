# ON WAY TO BOWL
## 'Tain't Like Before,' Cal Sighs in Reminiscence 
### AL McCOMBS 
"Tilings aren't what they used to
be!" is the cry that echoes from the
portals of the modern Greek tem
ples which line Piedmont Avenue in
Berkeley; but it is a subdued cry,
because no one cares much if they
aren't, since Cal won the Big Game
and is going to the Rose Buwl.
Big Game week was pretty quiet
this year, particularly the two days
and nights before the Big Event. The
Axetravaganza, Cal's counterpart of
the Big Game Gaieties, was a flop,
and the Homecoming parade had to
be held in broad daylight. The
Berkeley police cracked down after
last year's fiasco in Strawberry Can
yon.
A Chilly Night
With the liquor ban on hard, a
fellow didn't even have a chance to
warm himself by a street bonfire.
The men managed to light two, but
dared not add fuel lest they be
carted away to the local hoosegow.
One chilled individual was carted
oft after poking the embers with a
stick. Two others were taken into
custody for sipping beer on a street
corner.
Nevertheless, the traditional ale
Mowed like water up on the hill be
low the Cyclotron, where sopho
mores carried out their traditional
Big "C" guarding duties by the case.
Even some Stanford lads were in
vited to share the brew alter show
ing up innocent and paintless.
Scalp or Go?
Monday morning the Daily Cal
announced the good news with a
black four inches of WE GO! on the
front page, and Dr. Sproul gave his
kids a pat on the back for behaving
themselves and not making the city
fathers mad this year.
It is doubtful whether the migra
tion to the south on New Year's
will be as big as last year. Many
students are anxious to scalp their
ducats.
'lihick Sambo' Squall
Even the issue over "black Sam
bo" has quieted down. After turn
ing down a motion which claimed
racial discrimination in a local soda
lountain, the ASUC Store Commit
tee, which has no counterpart here,
passed a resolution that "Little
Black Sambo" should be barred
from the student bookstore.
* The committee claimed the chil
dren's classic caricatured a minority
group and was unfit to be read by
children. The motion was then re
ierred to the ASUC Executive Com
mittee for final action.

After the committee heard repre
sentative Dick Van Houten' de
nounce the move as a "hypocritical,
bald, publicity - seeking idea," it
turned thumbs down on the motion.
Meanwhile, all 12 copies of the book
in the campus co-op were sold after
collecting dust for years.
