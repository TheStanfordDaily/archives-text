# NIGHT ASSISTANT RETIRES
## Mrs. Mort Recalls 22 Years at Roble Door 
### GORDON ADDISON 
There is one Stanford woman who
has, with few exceptions, taken six
"2:3o's" a week for 22 consecutive
years.
Although she has never attended
a Western Civ class or waved a
pom-pom as a Stanford student, she
has become one of the ever-popular
personalities within the Stanford
family through her traditional role
as "night housemother" at Koble
Hall. This woman is Mrs. Ina Mort.
Today she still checks in the frosh
girls at night just as she did for
many of their mothers in the early
'?o's. Although she tries to remain
in the background as the freshman
women's activities continue, she re
tains a niche in the memory of stu
dents who have completed their
school years on the Farm.
Rush From Trolley
She began her work in 1916 as
day desk clerk in Old Roble, now
Sequoia. In l'JlB, when the hall,
which housed women of all classi
fications, was moved to its present
location, she recalls that the total
women's enrollment in school was
only 500.
Those were the days, she said,
when the couples made their last
rush to the door from the old Too
nerville Trolley, or in some cases,
even a horse and buggy.
Through the years, though, the
Roble night assistant remarked, the
most common excuse for lockouts
was "Hat tires and car trouble."
Old 10 p.m. Rule
In noting the difference in social
regulations in those days and pres
ent times, Mrs. Mort said the latest
leave in the '20's was 1 a.m., and in
Old Roble, the standard closing time
was 10 p.m.
She noted the change in skirt
length, along with the coeds' neck
line, as the most obvious style

change. In the early '20's she said i
the dresses of the women students
covered all but about two inches of |
their legs and then moved higher i
until they were almost at knee level.
Then the drop came, and now the
curve seems to be sloping up some
what, she added. The earlier fash
ions of "Stanford Sadie" called for
high cover-up-the-neck dresses.
From 1924 to 1927, Mrs. Mort was
on leave, but when she returned the
next year, she started night duty
six days a week—and has continued
ever since.
All the Worries
Along with Miss Gladys Keane,
Roble director, Mrs. Mort takes tin
place of the girls' mothers. When
girls are late, they worry until the
girls arrive "home." In some cases,
Miss Keane must make phone calls
to check on the girls' absence.
Ten hall directors have come and
gone, but Mrs. Mort has remained
on. This quarter, however, is her
last. She plans to rest in a small
apartment in Clareinont.
She says she will always remem
ber the fine traditions of Roble,
which have been so much a part of
her life—the Aloha dinner and pro
gram, the birthday dinner, and the
girls' excitement at Big Game time.
When it was mentioned that "dead
week" would start next Monday, she
said rather wistfully, "Only a few
more days . . ." Then romes her last
finals week and Christmas vacation
in Roble—but certainly not the last j
in her memories.
