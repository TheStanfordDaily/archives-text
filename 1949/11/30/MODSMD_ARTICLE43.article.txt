All this talk on football coaches and Stanford's football team has gone far
beyond the point I intended to make last week.
First, in regard to the letter to the editor on page two of today's Daily:
Never have 1 intended any remark of mine to represent the attitude of
the team as a whole. In the first place, that would be quite impossible.
There is divided feeling among them as well as anyplace else.
But I do know what some members think. 1 have my own thoughts on the
matter. Of course I can't print the names of any of the team members to
whom I have talked. Sophs and juniors would never see action again in
the Red of Stanford if I attributed certain remarks to them.
As most of the readers of The Daily know, the opinions expressed in the
sports columns are those of the writer. I have definite opinions as to the
merits of Phil Bengtson as a coach. I think I have made that clear.
Second, the story has gone the rounds that 1 have a personal grudge
against Bengtson. This is not true. Let me tell a short story.
1 have had the opinion for over two years that Bengtson is not a good
line coach. So, before the UCLA game, I wrote a column about how the

team was going to lose to the Bruins r
because of superior line play on the •
part of UCLA. I was going to run \
the column on Monday with the nota
tion that it had been written the :
Wednesday before.
But we did not lose to UCLA in
quite the manner I had expected. So j
the column was not printed. I did, !
however, write another piece con- ■
cerning the line play of Stanford over ;
the years. That Monday night Bengt- ,
son and myself had a lew words in '<
the presence of some of the team
members. He had asked what I had 112
meant with the "Where do we go
from here" comment in Monday's
paper.
My column was in the process of
being set up over at The Daily. That
column pretty well explained my
opinion. I cculd see no reason to ban- <
ter words in front of the players.
Bengtson did. I left.
So grew the thought that I had a
personal grudge against Bengtson.

Keep in mind the fact that I had already written the column before the
"words."
An hour later I withdrew the column from the paper, for I thought it
would be best to wait until alter the football season. End of story.
Now it is after football season.
And now I am engaged in a campaign to remove said line coach from the
Stanford coaching staff. Friend John Hall went a little further.
From the reaction I have seen from the student body, I think a great
portion of them are with me. I may be wrong. For three years now, we of
Stanford have been treated to poor blocking and tackling. It did improve
this year. The students are fed up. They have been for some time.
Now they (we) want action. I lay a good deal of the trouble at Bengtson's
feet. Many students go further. Be that as it may, some action should
be taken.
The Stanford Athletic Control Board is the logical unit to move. I sug
gest the gentlemen get together and talk it over. Our representatives are
Noel Belin. fialph Sala, and Hank Rosin. Those of you who want action:
see them, and let them know how you feel.
One last apology to the team. If my remarks have been written so that I
have painted a picture of 40-some players frothing at the mouth with hate
for Bengtson, it was not intended. My contention is that he does not com
mand the good will, drive, and ability necessary to produce a line that is
needed in a top-fiight football team.
I again say that Stanford will not win consistently, regardless of all the
talent that is brought in, against teams with rough lines. Too much Card
line talent will be lost because of personal dislikes, and poor coaching. The
jayvees and frosh will continue to win against Cal, USC, and UCLA. But
the varsity will go on losing to those same teams.
A story in this morning's Examiner comes out in favor of Bengtson. Phil,
it seems, is responsible for Stanford's brilliant defensive record. The Cards
were second in the conference in rushing defense. Phil caused this.
What the noted Mr. Sullivan fails to add is, that though Stanford was
second in the loop in rushing defense, it was eighth in pass defense.
Not the least reason for this was the 5-3-3 defense used by the Indians.
Schwartz played his linebackers right up in the slots to choke oft' the
opponents' running attack. At times the Cards used a 5-4-2 defense. To stop
running attacks, of course. So what happens, they pass us to cfeath.
Then too, Stanford did play such greats as San Jose State, Idaho, Harvard,
Oregon State (without Ken Carpenter), and Washington (which lost three
star backs in the first half).
Yes, the Stanford ground defense was great. But the passing defense
suffered because of it. Only two poorer teams in the conference.

Schwartz played his linebackers right up in the slots to choke oft' the
opponents' running attack. At times the Cards used a 5-4-2 defense. To stop
running attacks, of course. So what happens, they pass us to cfeath.
Then too, Stanford did play such greats as San Jose State, Idaho, Harvard,
Oregon State (without Ken Carpenter), and Washington (which lost three
star backs in the first half).
Yes, the Stanford ground defense was great. But the passing defense
suffered because of it. Only two poorer teams in the conference.

PHIL BENGTSON
All this talk on football coaches and Stanford's football team has gone far
beyond the point I intended to make last week.
First, in regard to the letter to the editor on page two of today's Daily:
Never have 1 intended any remark of mine to represent the attitude of
the team as a whole. In the first place, that would be quite impossible.
There is divided feeling among them as well as anyplace else.
But I do know what some members think. 1 have my own thoughts on the
matter. Of course I can't print the names of any of the team members to
whom I have talked. Sophs and juniors would never see action again in
the Red of Stanford if I attributed certain remarks to them.
As most of the readers of The Daily know, the opinions expressed in the
sports columns are those of the writer. I have definite opinions as to the
merits of Phil Bengtson as a coach. I think I have made that clear.
Second, the story has gone the rounds that 1 have a personal grudge
against Bengtson. This is not true. Let me tell a short story.
1 have had the opinion for over two years that Bengtson is not a good
line coach. So, before the UCLA game, I wrote a column about how the

team was going to lose to the Bruins r
because of superior line play on the •
part of UCLA. I was going to run \
the column on Monday with the nota
tion that it had been written the :
Wednesday before.
But we did not lose to UCLA in
quite the manner I had expected. So j
the column was not printed. I did, !
however, write another piece con- ■
cerning the line play of Stanford over ;
the years. That Monday night Bengt- ,
son and myself had a lew words in '<
the presence of some of the team
members. He had asked what I had 112
meant with the "Where do we go
from here" comment in Monday's
paper.
My column was in the process of
being set up over at The Daily. That
column pretty well explained my
opinion. I cculd see no reason to ban- <
ter words in front of the players.
Bengtson did. I left.
So grew the thought that I had a
personal grudge against Bengtson.

Keep in mind the fact that I had already written the column before the
"words."
An hour later I withdrew the column from the paper, for I thought it
would be best to wait until alter the football season. End of story.
Now it is after football season.
And now I am engaged in a campaign to remove said line coach from the
Stanford coaching staff. Friend John Hall went a little further.
From the reaction I have seen from the student body, I think a great
portion of them are with me. I may be wrong. For three years now, we of
Stanford have been treated to poor blocking and tackling. It did improve
this year. The students are fed up. They have been for some time.
Now they (we) want action. I lay a good deal of the trouble at Bengtson's
feet. Many students go further. Be that as it may, some action should
be taken.
The Stanford Athletic Control Board is the logical unit to move. I sug
gest the gentlemen get together and talk it over. Our representatives are
Noel Belin. fialph Sala, and Hank Rosin. Those of you who want action:
see them, and let them know how you feel.
One last apology to the team. If my remarks have been written so that I
have painted a picture of 40-some players frothing at the mouth with hate
for Bengtson, it was not intended. My contention is that he does not com
mand the good will, drive, and ability necessary to produce a line that is
needed in a top-fiight football team.
I again say that Stanford will not win consistently, regardless of all the
talent that is brought in, against teams with rough lines. Too much Card
line talent will be lost because of personal dislikes, and poor coaching. The
jayvees and frosh will continue to win against Cal, USC, and UCLA. But
the varsity will go on losing to those same teams.
A story in this morning's Examiner comes out in favor of Bengtson. Phil,
it seems, is responsible for Stanford's brilliant defensive record. The Cards
were second in the conference in rushing defense. Phil caused this.
What the noted Mr. Sullivan fails to add is, that though Stanford was
second in the loop in rushing defense, it was eighth in pass defense.
Not the least reason for this was the 5-3-3 defense used by the Indians.
Schwartz played his linebackers right up in the slots to choke oft' the

Noel Belin. fialph Sala, and Hank Rosin. Those of you who want action:
see them, and let them know how you feel.
One last apology to the team. If my remarks have been written so that I
have painted a picture of 40-some players frothing at the mouth with hate
for Bengtson, it was not intended. My contention is that he does not com
mand the good will, drive, and ability necessary to produce a line that is
needed in a top-fiight football team.
I again say that Stanford will not win consistently, regardless of all the
talent that is brought in, against teams with rough lines. Too much Card
line talent will be lost because of personal dislikes, and poor coaching. The
jayvees and frosh will continue to win against Cal, USC, and UCLA. But
the varsity will go on losing to those same teams.
A story in this morning's Examiner comes out in favor of Bengtson. Phil,
it seems, is responsible for Stanford's brilliant defensive record. The Cards
were second in the conference in rushing defense. Phil caused this.
What the noted Mr. Sullivan fails to add is, that though Stanford was
second in the loop in rushing defense, it was eighth in pass defense.
Not the least reason for this was the 5-3-3 defense used by the Indians.
Schwartz played his linebackers right up in the slots to choke oft' the
opponents' running attack. At times the Cards used a 5-4-2 defense. To stop
running attacks, of course. So what happens, they pass us to cfeath.
Then too, Stanford did play such greats as San Jose State, Idaho, Harvard,
Oregon State (without Ken Carpenter), and Washington (which lost three
star backs in the first half).
Yes, the Stanford ground defense was great. But the passing defense
suffered because of it. Only two poorer teams in the conference.

PHIL BENGTSON
All this talk on football coaches and Stanford's football team has gone far
beyond the point I intended to make last week.
First, in regard to the letter to the editor on page two of today's Daily:
Never have 1 intended any remark of mine to represent the attitude of
the team as a whole. In the first place, that would be quite impossible.
There is divided feeling among them as well as anyplace else.
But I do know what some members think. 1 have my own thoughts on the
matter. Of course I can't print the names of any of the team members to
whom I have talked. Sophs and juniors would never see action again in
the Red of Stanford if I attributed certain remarks to them.
As most of the readers of The Daily know, the opinions expressed in the
sports columns are those of the writer. I have definite opinions as to the
merits of Phil Bengtson as a coach. I think I have made that clear.
Second, the story has gone the rounds that 1 have a personal grudge
against Bengtson. This is not true. Let me tell a short story.
1 have had the opinion for over two years that Bengtson is not a good
line coach. So, before the UCLA game, I wrote a column about how the

team was going to lose to the Bruins r
because of superior line play on the •
part of UCLA. I was going to run \
the column on Monday with the nota
tion that it had been written the :
Wednesday before.
But we did not lose to UCLA in
quite the manner I had expected. So j
the column was not printed. I did, !
however, write another piece con- ■
cerning the line play of Stanford over ;
the years. That Monday night Bengt- ,
son and myself had a lew words in '<
the presence of some of the team
members. He had asked what I had 112
meant with the "Where do we go
from here" comment in Monday's
paper.
My column was in the process of
being set up over at The Daily. That
column pretty well explained my
opinion. I cculd see no reason to ban- <
ter words in front of the players.
Bengtson did. I left.
So grew the thought that I had a
personal grudge against Bengtson.

Keep in mind the fact that I had already written the column before the
"words."
An hour later I withdrew the column from the paper, for I thought it
would be best to wait until alter the football season. End of story.
Now it is after football season.
And now I am engaged in a campaign to remove said line coach from the
Stanford coaching staff. Friend John Hall went a little further.
From the reaction I have seen from the student body, I think a great
portion of them are with me. I may be wrong. For three years now, we of
Stanford have been treated to poor blocking and tackling. It did improve
this year. The students are fed up. They have been for some time.
Now they (we) want action. I lay a good deal of the trouble at Bengtson's
feet. Many students go further. Be that as it may, some action should
be taken.
