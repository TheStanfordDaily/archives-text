# COP Cagers Boast Unique Double-Post Attack Plan
## 
### NORM RITTER 
The College of Pacific's Tigers
come to the Farm tomorrow with a
new twist in the Tiger's tai!—the
double-post system. This unique at
tack is relatively new to the college
hoop fan, having been chiefly con
fined to the pros in recent years.
Genial Bengal mentor Chris
Kjeldsen decided to give it a try
after watching the rapid develop
ment of center Howard Pearce in
his soph campaign. By the season's
end he had virtually two centers,
six-foot seven-inch Pearce and sen
sational Bill Wirt, a six-foot four
inch kingpin under the basket. As
a sophomore in 1948-49, Wirt posted
a 12-point average in 27 games.
For speed Kjeldsen still has Hank
Pfister and Jim Enos, who came in
with the present COP sports dy
nasty in 1946 and have been around
ever since. Pfister's forte is his cat
like defensive play and long set
shots. Enos excels as a play-maker.
The fifth man in the attack will be
playing his first collegiate game. II
may be either Jim Denton or Brit
Smith, ex-Stockton College aces, or
both depending upon the condition
of Pearce's ailing knees.
The double-post has all the vari

ations of the single - pivot system
with additional screening advan
tages offered by the second man in
the key. This also places another
man near enough the basket for ef
fective offensive rebounding.
The use of two pivots allows the
figure-eight to he woven around al
ternate centers with equal effective
ness on each side of the key.
It could go something like this:
Pfister and Enos advance the ball
from the back court and pass quick
ly to Wirt, who moves out to the
foul line. He may either drive for a
lay - up, shoot from a screen by
Pearce, hook from the foul lihe, or
pass off to Pearce.
He may also move out of the key
and set up the figure-eight or pass
out to the center guard, who has
shifted into the corner to relieve de
fensive pressure on the pivot man.
Prospects of bettering last year's
14-13 won-lost record are so de
pendent upon the Wirt-Pearce com
bination that the staunches! of Tiger
roooters are none too optimistic.
There is such an absolute dearth
of reserves that Kjeldsen will be
scraping the bottom of the barrel to
find a seventh man to cope with
Stanford's tiring fast break.

ations of the single - pivot system
with additional screening advan
tages offered by the second man in
the key. This also places another
man near enough the basket for ef
fective offensive rebounding.
The use of two pivots allows the
figure-eight to he woven around al
ternate centers with equal effective
ness on each side of the key.
It could go something like this:
Pfister and Enos advance the ball
from the back court and pass quick
ly to Wirt, who moves out to the
foul line. He may either drive for a
lay - up, shoot from a screen by
Pearce, hook from the foul lihe, or
pass off to Pearce.
He may also move out of the key
and set up the figure-eight or pass
out to the center guard, who has
shifted into the corner to relieve de
fensive pressure on the pivot man.
Prospects of bettering last year's
14-13 won-lost record are so de
pendent upon the Wirt-Pearce com
bination that the staunches! of Tiger
roooters are none too optimistic.
There is such an absolute dearth
of reserves that Kjeldsen will be
scraping the bottom of the barrel to
find a seventh man to cope with
Stanford's tiring fast break.
The College of Pacific's Tigers
come to the Farm tomorrow with a
new twist in the Tiger's tai!—the
double-post system. This unique at
tack is relatively new to the college
hoop fan, having been chiefly con
fined to the pros in recent years.
Genial Bengal mentor Chris
Kjeldsen decided to give it a try
after watching the rapid develop
ment of center Howard Pearce in
his soph campaign. By the season's
end he had virtually two centers,
six-foot seven-inch Pearce and sen
sational Bill Wirt, a six-foot four
inch kingpin under the basket. As
a sophomore in 1948-49, Wirt posted
a 12-point average in 27 games.
For speed Kjeldsen still has Hank
Pfister and Jim Enos, who came in
with the present COP sports dy
nasty in 1946 and have been around
ever since. Pfister's forte is his cat
like defensive play and long set
shots. Enos excels as a play-maker.
The fifth man in the attack will be
playing his first collegiate game. II
may be either Jim Denton or Brit
Smith, ex-Stockton College aces, or
both depending upon the condition
of Pearce's ailing knees.
The double-post has all the vari

ations of the single - pivot system
with additional screening advan
tages offered by the second man in
