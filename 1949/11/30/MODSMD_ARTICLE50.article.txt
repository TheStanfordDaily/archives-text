# 'Please Sign The Pledge..'
## Code Dates From 1921 
### ART HENRY 
"Please sign the honor statement"
is a phrase that becomes very famil
iar to Stanford students as mid
terms and finals roll around.
But that request has not always
been a part of examination instruc
tions. It took 30 years of hard work
by those who believed in and fought
for the Honor Code before it became
a Stanford tradition.
And it is only because present
Stanford students believe in and

I support the system that they con-
J tinue to enjoy its benefits.
When the University opened in
1891 there was no Honor Code or
student government. Faculty com
mittees were appointed to govern
student affairs, and examinations
were proctored.
An honor system proposed in 1904
was abandoned because it was be
lieved that it would work only
under student government, which
was still opposed by the administra
tion.
Weak Government
In 1912 the student body was giv
en limited control over its affairs,
though still under faculty supervi
sion. And in 1915 President Bran
ner appointed faculty members to
act as watchdogs over the student
committees.
Later in 1915 David Starr Jordan,
then chancellor, said student gov
ernment was satisfactory. "The chief
weakness," he said, "arises from lack
of interest." The students reacted to
this statement with increased de
mands for an honor system.
A form of honor code had been in
itiated by the Law School before this
time. Continued demand by stu
dents and faculty resulted in other
departments adopting similar sys
tems. In 1915 failure of the History
Department to support the move
ment was a setback, but many con
tinued to push the plan.
Veteran Demand
Veterans returning from World
War I strongly condemned cheating
in examinations. They maintained
the only answer to cheating was an
honor system established and sup
ported by the students.
A comparison of proctoring at
Harvard and the honor system at
Princeton was published in the
Stanford Illustrated Review of April
1921. The article stated: "Proctoring
keeps students honest, the Honor
Code makes them honest."
Finally on May 24, 1921, the Daily
Palo Alto, forerunner of the Stan
ford Daily, announced: "The Stan
ford faculty, acting upon a petition
from the students, has approved a
plan for an honor system through
out the University. The Honor Sys
tem will be put in effect in finals in
July."
The First Trial
The basic plan of the system was
similar to the plan now. Instructors
were to leave the room during tests,
and violations were to be reported
by the students. Charges were heard
and penalties given by a student
elected committee, subject to appeal
to the president of the University.
The plan was readily accepted, but
in 1924, dissension developed be
cause instructors were turning in
more violations than were the stu
dents. The general spirit of the sys
tem grew throughout the campus,

however, and the Code has survied
to the present.
The late Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
former president and chancellor, ex
plained the system as follows: "The
Honor Code worked because it was
a system with a system. The Code
would have failed if the initiative
had not been placed on the student.
Within the resulting development of
mental character lies the system's
strength."

tion.
Weak Government
In 1912 the student body was giv
en limited control over its affairs,
though still under faculty supervi
sion. And in 1915 President Bran
ner appointed faculty members to
act as watchdogs over the student
committees.
Later in 1915 David Starr Jordan,
then chancellor, said student gov
ernment was satisfactory. "The chief
weakness," he said, "arises from lack
of interest." The students reacted to
this statement with increased de
mands for an honor system.
A form of honor code had been in
itiated by the Law School before this
time. Continued demand by stu
dents and faculty resulted in other
departments adopting similar sys
tems. In 1915 failure of the History
Department to support the move
ment was a setback, but many con
tinued to push the plan.
Veteran Demand
Veterans returning from World
War I strongly condemned cheating
in examinations. They maintained
the only answer to cheating was an
honor system established and sup
ported by the students.
A comparison of proctoring at
Harvard and the honor system at
Princeton was published in the
Stanford Illustrated Review of April
1921. The article stated: "Proctoring
keeps students honest, the Honor
Code makes them honest."
Finally on May 24, 1921, the Daily
Palo Alto, forerunner of the Stan
ford Daily, announced: "The Stan
ford faculty, acting upon a petition
from the students, has approved a
plan for an honor system through
out the University. The Honor Sys
tem will be put in effect in finals in
July."
The First Trial
The basic plan of the system was
similar to the plan now. Instructors
were to leave the room during tests,
and violations were to be reported
by the students. Charges were heard
and penalties given by a student
elected committee, subject to appeal
to the president of the University.
The plan was readily accepted, but
in 1924, dissension developed be
cause instructors were turning in
more violations than were the stu
dents. The general spirit of the sys
tem grew throughout the campus,

however, and the Code has survied
to the present.
The late Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
former president and chancellor, ex
plained the system as follows: "The
Honor Code worked because it was
a system with a system. The Code
would have failed if the initiative
had not been placed on the student.
Within the resulting development of
mental character lies the system's
strength."
(For editorial comment on the
Honor Code, see page 2.)
"Please sign the honor statement"
is a phrase that becomes very famil
iar to Stanford students as mid
terms and finals roll around.
But that request has not always
been a part of examination instruc
tions. It took 30 years of hard work
by those who believed in and fought
for the Honor Code before it became
a Stanford tradition.
And it is only because present
Stanford students believe in and

I support the system that they con-
J tinue to enjoy its benefits.
When the University opened in
1891 there was no Honor Code or
student government. Faculty com
mittees were appointed to govern
student affairs, and examinations
were proctored.
An honor system proposed in 1904
was abandoned because it was be
lieved that it would work only
under student government, which
was still opposed by the administra
tion.
