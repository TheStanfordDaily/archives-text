# Turkey Shoot Contest Opens This Morning
## 
### 
Tojjay is the first day of the Scab
bard and Blade Turkey Shoot. The
contest is open to all students and
faculty.
Winners will receive turkeys. For
the worst score, there will be
awarded one chicken.
The ROTC rifle range will be open
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today, to
morrow, and Friday.
Each contestant will get two shots
for each $1 ticket. Ammunition,
targets, and rifles will be furnished.
The women may shoot from the
prone position; the men will have to
use the sititng or kneeling position.
Contestants may bring their own
rifles if they arc .22 caliber, and if
the sight has no glass.
Those who are less proficient
marksmen may use a garbled target
upon which the numbers on the
rings are mixed up, thereby raising
the possibility of a higher score. The
better shots may use the conven
tional target.
As each 11 persons buy tickets,
they will be divided into groups, and
their scores will be graded only
against the other 10 persons in their
group. If particular houses or other
groups want to compete against each
other for a turkey, they should pre
sent their names together so they
will be in the same group.
Tickets are available at the range,
the ASSU office, the ROTC office,
and from most Scabbard and Blade
or rifle team members.
