# Excom to Discuss By-Law Revision
## Amendment Advocated 
### 
The proposed electioneering
amendment to the by-laws of the
ASSU constitution will be re
viewed by Excom tonight. The
amendment was tabled at last
week's Executive Committee
meeting.
The amendment is designed to
curb illegal electioneering and to
provide a remedy for the possibility
of a friend of a candidate taking the
blame for such electioneering to
avoid disqualification of the candi
date.
Last week Excom considered
maximum penalties of 22 hours at
the Convalescent Home for candi
dates guilty of illegal campaigning
and 15 hours for other persons who
campaign illegally without the can
didates' consent.
Excom committee on the proposed
amendment includes Fred Ten Eyck,
Gregg Bemis, Jim Dodd, and Jerry
Hill.
Excom will discuss the ski movie
which had been planned to raise
money for the Stanford ski team.
The Committee on Public Exercises
has notified the ASSU that such a
project would have to be underwrit
ten by the ASSU and handled
through regular ASSU committees.
In addition, it must be "of signifi
cance to the student body as a
whole."
Excom will meet at 7:15 in the
Excom room, Old Union.
