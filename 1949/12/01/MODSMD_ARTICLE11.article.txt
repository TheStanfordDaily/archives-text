# Law School Opening Set For February
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Begun in October 1948 and now 90
per cent completed, Stanford's new,
near-million-dollar Law School will
probably be ready for occupancy
sometime early next February.
Workers are now doin-4 last-stage
carpentry, mechanical, and painting
work on the three-story project
which is a complete remodeling job
of the Farm's 46-year-old former
Administration Building.
The building is scheduled to be
turned over to the University 'on
February 1, said Eldridgc 1. Spencer,
University director of planning, yes
terday. At that point, University of
ficials will take over and move chairs,
lockers, desks, books, and other
equipment into the school.
"Moving of the volumes alone will
probably take from a week to 10
days," said Seraphim Post, assistant
to University Business Manager Alf
Brandin. On the whole, Post said,

the dispatch of rrloving operations
will depend on the speed of sup
pliers.
Post said that, in so far as the pres-*
ent Lav/ School has no classroom fa
cilities of its own, most of the
school's classroom equipment will ke
new. Old office desks and furniture,
however, will be refinished by the
Corporation Yard for transferral to
new offices.
Should moving operations be com
, pleted by February 15, total comple
tion of the building will be one and
one-half months ahead of its original
building schedule of 18 months.
Described by Dean of the Law
School Carl B. Spaeth as one of the
finest physical plants for law instruc
tion in the country, the new school's
facilities will include:
Large Iccture halls, classrooms, a
moot court room, an enlarged law
library, faculty offices, rooms for
consultation and graduate research,
enlarged Law Review quarters, and
reading ropms.
In the basement, a lounge, locker
i room, and vault will be included.
'I he moot courtroom, especially
[applicable to a legal atmosphere, will
' feature a judge's bench, witness
| chair, jury box, counsel table, and
j spe' tntors' se: Is.
Built within the oulor shell of the
| old Administration Building lfter the
j interior of that building was torn out,
j I lie new ■ tructui e was constructed
I with an eve to withstanding such
shocks as might rc:.ult from carth
; quakes.
Including three floors with mezza
; nine levels al ove the first and sec
ond storie:, the new school will have
a stick spare of 200,000 volumes, (52,-
000 square feet of floor area, and a
'seating capacity of 200 in its reading
rooms. Ihe main lovlure room will

Workers are now doin-4 last-stage
carpentry, mechanical, and painting
work on the three-story project
which is a complete remodeling job
of the Farm's 46-year-old former
Administration Building.
The building is scheduled to be
turned over to the University 'on
February 1, said Eldridgc 1. Spencer,
University director of planning, yes
terday. At that point, University of
ficials will take over and move chairs,
lockers, desks, books, and other
equipment into the school.
"Moving of the volumes alone will
probably take from a week to 10
days," said Seraphim Post, assistant
to University Business Manager Alf
Brandin. On the whole, Post said,

the dispatch of rrloving operations
will depend on the speed of sup
pliers.
Post said that, in so far as the pres-*

school's classroom equipment will ke

however, will be refinished by the
Corporation Yard for transferral to
new offices.
Should moving operations be com
