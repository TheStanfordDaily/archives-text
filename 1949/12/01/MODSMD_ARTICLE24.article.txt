# Cards Will Open Basketball Season Tonight
## Cards Clash With COP; Braves To Play Modesto 
### JOHN HALL 
Here we go again!
Everett Dean's fast-breaking men from the Farm are set to roll off their starting blocks tonight to
meet College of Pacific in the initial outing of the 1949-50 basketball season.
Tipoff is set for 8, with a Stanford Braves-Modesto JC prelim scheduled at 6:15. Admission is free.
It will mark the beginning of Everett Dean's tenth year as head coach, as the sophomore-sprinkled

varsity gets under way for its first
along a 24-game path.
San Jose State on Saturday and
Stewart Chevrolet on Tuesday are
next in line for the Cards.
Tonight's opener should answer
several important question marks:
1. It will be the first test for the
new all-out fast break.
2. It will be the first time in four
years that Stanford has gone to the
post without Dave Davidson, Bill
Stephenson, and Bob Lewis.
3. It will mark the first varsity
trials for Stanford's five outstanding
sophs — Jim Walsh, Jim Ramstead,
Ron Carver, Bruce Iversen, and Gary
Andrews—who as frosh last sea cn
were rated as being one of the finest
first-year quintets in Stanford his
tory.
4. Finally, it will be the 1519-50
uncovering of giant George Yardley.
who is roaring at full speed once
again, after a mid-season knee in
jury ruined his chances for Ail-
American honors last year.
Stanford's hopes for a successfu
season will be built around Dean's
new speed machine and the three
veterans, George Yardley, Gus Cha
valas, and Marv Gelber.
Heads Up
If co-captains Yardley and Gus
Chavalas play at peak form through
out the season, and if Marv Gelber
stays healthy, the trio will form a
backbone for a good, heads-up kali-

dents.

club.
Stanford's starting lineup, an
nounced by Dean last night, consists
of Yardley and soph Jim Walsh at
forwards, Ralph Carver at center,
and Chavalas and Gelber at guards.
Toss up
Dean said that it was tossup be
tween Carver and soph Jim Ram
stead for the starting center spot,
but that the nod went to Carver be
cause of his added experience.
College of Pacific, boasting a height
edge over Stanford, will use a dou
ble-post offense, featuring Bill Wirt
(6-4), who dunked in 12 points per
contest last season, and Howard
Pearcc (6-7).
Besides these two giants, Tiger
coach Kris Kjeldson will also have
the use of speeders Hank and
Jim Enos, two boys who ran Stan
ford ragged last year before finally
tiring to lose, 65-56.
Red Hot Practice
Jim Denton rounds out the COP
I quintet. A sophomore, Denton earned
his first string job with some red
hot practice performances last weak.
Stockton fans rate this season's
club over last year's team, although
they fear that lack of reserve power
will weaken them to the Stanford
[ speed attack. However, about that,
! Everett Dean isn't so sure.
Quick Boys
But he will throw plenty of speed
:at the Tigers. Centered around the
lightning dribbler, Gus Chavalas, the
Card quick-boys, Jim Walsh, Marv
Gelber, Jack O'Sullivan, Ron Carver,
and Bruce Iversen, will be seeing
plenty of action.
Stanford's practice sessions during
the past week have demonstrated
clearly that the Cards can and will
run with the ball.
Jim Walsh, the only soph to crack
the opening lineup, has been improv
ing every day, and he figures to be
one of Stanford's most important
scoring threats. He has caused en

thusiastic comment from all those
who have watched him in action so
far this season.
Jim Ramstead, the second sopho
more to be sniffing at a starting po
sition, is also showing effective stuff
around the key.
Outstanding development in Inst
night's session was the appearance of
white basketball shoes, which will
also Ret their first test against COP.
The all-white shoes are something
new with the Indians.

club.
Stanford's starting lineup, an
nounced by Dean last night, consists
of Yardley and soph Jim Walsh at
forwards, Ralph Carver at center,
and Chavalas and Gelber at guards.
Toss up
Dean said that it was tossup be
tween Carver and soph Jim Ram
stead for the starting center spot,
but that the nod went to Carver be
cause of his added experience.
College of Pacific, boasting a height
edge over Stanford, will use a dou
ble-post offense, featuring Bill Wirt
(6-4), who dunked in 12 points per
contest last season, and Howard
Pearcc (6-7).
Besides these two giants, Tiger
coach Kris Kjeldson will also have
the use of speeders Hank and
Jim Enos, two boys who ran Stan
ford ragged last year before finally
tiring to lose, 65-56.
Red Hot Practice
Jim Denton rounds out the COP
I quintet. A sophomore, Denton earned
his first string job with some red
hot practice performances last weak.
Stockton fans rate this season's
club over last year's team, although
they fear that lack of reserve power
will weaken them to the Stanford
[ speed attack. However, about that,
! Everett Dean isn't so sure.
Quick Boys
But he will throw plenty of speed
:at the Tigers. Centered around the
lightning dribbler, Gus Chavalas, the
Card quick-boys, Jim Walsh, Marv
Gelber, Jack O'Sullivan, Ron Carver,
and Bruce Iversen, will be seeing
plenty of action.
Stanford's practice sessions during
the past week have demonstrated
clearly that the Cards can and will
run with the ball.
Jim Walsh, the only soph to crack
the opening lineup, has been improv
ing every day, and he figures to be
one of Stanford's most important
scoring threats. He has caused en

thusiastic comment from all those
who have watched him in action so
far this season.
Jim Ramstead, the second sopho
more to be sniffing at a starting po
sition, is also showing effective stuff
around the key.
Outstanding development in Inst

white basketball shoes, which will
also Ret their first test against COP.
The all-white shoes are something
new with the Indians.
Here we go again!
Everett Dean's fast-breaking men from the Farm are set to roll off their starting blocks tonight to
meet College of Pacific in the initial outing of the 1949-50 basketball season.
Tipoff is set for 8, with a Stanford Braves-Modesto JC prelim scheduled at 6:15. Admission is free.
It will mark the beginning of Everett Dean's tenth year as head coach, as the sophomore-sprinkled

varsity gets under way for its first
along a 24-game path.
San Jose State on Saturday and
Stewart Chevrolet on Tuesday are
next in line for the Cards.
Tonight's opener should answer
several important question marks:
1. It will be the first test for the
new all-out fast break.
2. It will be the first time in four
years that Stanford has gone to the
post without Dave Davidson, Bill

Here we go again!
Everett Dean's fast-breaking men from the Farm are set to roll off their starting blocks tonight to
meet College of Pacific in the initial outing of the 1949-50 basketball season.
Tipoff is set for 8, with a Stanford Braves-Modesto JC prelim scheduled at 6:15. Admission is free.
It will mark the beginning of Everett Dean's tenth year as head coach, as the sophomore-sprinkled

varsity gets under way for its first
along a 24-game path.
San Jose State on Saturday and
Stewart Chevrolet on Tuesday are
next in line for the Cards.
Tonight's opener should answer
several important question marks:
1. It will be the first test for the
new all-out fast break.
2. It will be the first time in four
years that Stanford has gone to the
post without Dave Davidson, Bill
Stephenson, and Bob Lewis.
3. It will mark the first varsity
trials for Stanford's five outstanding
sophs — Jim Walsh, Jim Ramstead,
Ron Carver, Bruce Iversen, and Gary
Andrews—who as frosh last sea cn
were rated as being one of the finest
first-year quintets in Stanford his
tory.
4. Finally, it will be the 1519-50

again, after a mid-season knee in

American honors last year.
Stanford's hopes for a successfu
season will be built around Dean's
new speed machine and the three
veterans, George Yardley, Gus Cha
valas, and Marv Gelber.
Heads Up
If co-captains Yardley and Gus
Chavalas play at peak form through
out the season, and if Marv Gelber
stays healthy, the trio will form a
backbone for a good, heads-up kali-
