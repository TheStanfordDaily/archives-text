# Student Hashing Committee
## 
### 
Every now and then we hear a complaint
about the hashing system at Stanford. Most of
the objections are directed at the method of
hiring hashers.
We haven't heard many complaints, and gen
erally we think it's a good system. But never
theless, peihaps it might be well to look over
the whola thing and clear up any misconcep
tions that exist.
Last spring a member of Excom proposed
that a student committee be set up to review
hashing applications.
! This'person deplored the fact that many stu
dents who are financially able to support them
selves were holding down hashing jobs while
others who need the work to stay in school
were biding their time on waiting lists.
We agree with this view, but only up to a
point.
Need should always be the most important
criterion for hiring hashers, but in criticizing
the method of selection at Stanford, one should
always keep in mind that the business of serv
ing meals is just that—a business.
Meals are served in University dining halls
at definite hours, and it's elementary to say that
hashers must be there at that time. If class
schedules and other time conflicts make it im
possible that the most needy applicants work
during the hours that are open, then it's obvious
that students with a lesser need should be
hired.
The idea that a student committee is needed
lo review hashing applications also bothers us.
' To decide whether John Jones or Jim Smith

needs a hashing job the most is about as tough
as they come. It's questionable if a student
committee, even with its superior insight into
student problems, could do a better job than
the University Dining Hall Staff is doing now.
A prospective hasher must fill out a student
employment form which requests information
on his physical status, car ownership, experi
ence, need of work, and family aid before his
application will be considered. If he does not
fill it out truthfully, there is practically no way
to check.
Then too, it would be difficult to get students
to serve on a committee which must work while
school is not in session. Applications are re
viewed about the first of September.
But the fact that such misconceptions about
hashing do exist makes it apparent that there
is a need for the substitute committee which
Excom set up this year—a committee to look
into hashing problems as a whole. This group
will investigate hiring policy, hours, compara
tive wages, and conditions of dismissal. Its
findings will be reported to Excom which will
make recommendations to the University Din
ing Hall Director if any problems are found to
exist.
It seems only right that hashing—a job that
employs nearly one-tenth of the students of
campus—should come under some kind of stu
dent surveillance. Complaints and suggestions
for improvements should be addressed to the
Hashing Committee, ASSU Office, or to the
Editor of The Daily.

' To decide whether John Jones or Jim Smith

needs a hashing job the most is about as tough
as they come. It's questionable if a student
committee, even with its superior insight into
student problems, could do a better job than
the University Dining Hall Staff is doing now.
A prospective hasher must fill out a student
employment form which requests information
on his physical status, car ownership, experi
ence, need of work, and family aid before his
application will be considered. If he does not
fill it out truthfully, there is practically no way
to check.
Then too, it would be difficult to get students
to serve on a committee which must work while
school is not in session. Applications are re
viewed about the first of September.
But the fact that such misconceptions about
hashing do exist makes it apparent that there
is a need for the substitute committee which
Excom set up this year—a committee to look
into hashing problems as a whole. This group
will investigate hiring policy, hours, compara
tive wages, and conditions of dismissal. Its
findings will be reported to Excom which will
make recommendations to the University Din
ing Hall Director if any problems are found to
exist.
It seems only right that hashing—a job that
employs nearly one-tenth of the students of
campus—should come under some kind of stu
dent surveillance. Complaints and suggestions
for improvements should be addressed to the
Hashing Committee, ASSU Office, or to the
Editor of The Daily.
Every now and then we hear a complaint
about the hashing system at Stanford. Most of
the objections are directed at the method of
hiring hashers.
We haven't heard many complaints, and gen
erally we think it's a good system. But never
theless, peihaps it might be well to look over
the whola thing and clear up any misconcep
tions that exist.
Last spring a member of Excom proposed
that a student committee be set up to review
hashing applications.
! This'person deplored the fact that many stu
dents who are financially able to support them
selves were holding down hashing jobs while
others who need the work to stay in school
were biding their time on waiting lists.
We agree with this view, but only up to a
point.
Need should always be the most important
criterion for hiring hashers, but in criticizing
the method of selection at Stanford, one should
always keep in mind that the business of serv
ing meals is just that—a business.
Meals are served in University dining halls
at definite hours, and it's elementary to say that
hashers must be there at that time. If class
schedules and other time conflicts make it im
possible that the most needy applicants work
during the hours that are open, then it's obvious
that students with a lesser need should be
hired.
The idea that a student committee is needed
lo review hashing applications also bothers us.
