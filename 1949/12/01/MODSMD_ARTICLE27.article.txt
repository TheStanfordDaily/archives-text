# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Hold it! Time out! Hold it!
I didn't mind when somebody called Bull Session
inane drivel.
I didn't mind when somebody called the Front Row

immature and impatient.
I didn't mind when the editor
suggested that I should drown
myself by singing "Trees" at the
Dog Show.
I didn't mind when they said I
should go ouc for basketball and
let them bounce me around.
I didn't mind when they said I
ought to go to UCLA because I'm
always down at Dinah's, Brewin'.
I didn't mind when they
laughed me and said it was easy

fo me to get pinned because I had the head tor it.
I didn't mind when they threatened to make me
read my own Bull Sessions.
1 didn't even mind when they accused me of being
a dog because 1 kept back to tin- Saturday Eve
ning Post.
t>ut now, they have come up with the insult 1 can
not endure. They could have blasted me, blistered
iif, or banned me I would have smiled .'imply and

asked for more.
So why—how could they—call me "John Breier's
stooge?" This is too much. I surrender, toss in the
towel, raise the white flag. I'm licked. I quit.
* * *
But, don't go away. I've got u fable for you, written
by someone else. (Cut out that cheering or you won't
get it.) It's pre-BG, but it's good enough to dig out
of the grave.
It seems that a certain Western Civ section whs
discussing the beginnings of Christianity. My re
search man wasn't paying much attention at the time,
but he came to in time to realize that the instructor
was asking "And what was it that this voice from
on high was saying?"
Evidently he was talking about the Lirth of Christ,
but fiom somewhere in the back of the room came
the answer, "BEAT CAL," and that was all for the
day. The guy who thought it was funny didn't want
his name mentioned.
■¥ * *
C'ne more item. This is undoubtedly the greatest
music review ever to have been written:
"An amateur string quartet played Brahms here
last evening. Brahms lost "
'I hat's Hall, brother.

Evidently he was talking about the Lirth of Christ,
but fiom somewhere in the back of the room came
the answer, "BEAT CAL," and that was all for the
day. The guy who thought it was funny didn't want
his name mentioned.

C'ne more item. This is undoubtedly the greatest
music review ever to have been written:
"An amateur string quartet played Brahms here
last evening. Brahms lost "
'I hat's Hall, brother.

Hold it! Time out! Hold it!
I didn't mind when somebody called Bull Session
inane drivel.
I didn't mind when somebody called the Front Row

immature and impatient.
I didn't mind when the editor
suggested that I should drown
myself by singing "Trees" at the
Dog Show.
I didn't mind when they said I
should go ouc for basketball and
let them bounce me around.
I didn't mind when they said I
ought to go to UCLA because I'm
always down at Dinah's, Brewin'.
I didn't mind when they
laughed me and said it was easy

fo me to get pinned because I had the head tor it.
I didn't mind when they threatened to make me
read my own Bull Sessions.
1 didn't even mind when they accused me of being
a dog because 1 kept back to tin- Saturday Eve
ning Post.
t>ut now, they have come up with the insult 1 can
not endure. They could have blasted me, blistered
iif, or banned me I would have smiled .'imply and

asked for more.
So why—how could they—call me "John Breier's
stooge?" This is too much. I surrender, toss in the
towel, raise the white flag. I'm licked. I quit.

But, don't go away. I've got u fable for you, written
by someone else. (Cut out that cheering or you won't
get it.) It's pre-BG, but it's good enough to dig out
of the grave.
It seems that a certain Western Civ section whs
discussing the beginnings of Christianity. My re
search man wasn't paying much attention at the time,
but he came to in time to realize that the instructor
was asking "And what was it that this voice from
on high was saying?"
