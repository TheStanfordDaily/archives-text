To the Editor:
Yes, "it is unfortunate that punk, undergraduate
writers must come out and criticize men known and
respected in their profession." Also it i:> true that, "it
does not look good," especially when a man of
Marchie Schwartz's stature ir» placed at the mercy of
John Hall, whose inane drivel in past "Bull Sessions"
puts the maturity of his judgment in issue.
There may be some merit in what Breier and Hall
say, however, their writings want in objectivity. They
point only to the worst in the record and totally ignore
the bent. Maybe Phil Bengteon isn't a > Ov,d coach, but
l< t me remind Mr. Hall that he produced an All —
American in Chuck Taylor, and in Viv Lindslcog and
Bill Haehten, if memory serves me correct ! y. He has
produced numerous All-Coast linemen, Ed Stamm
; nd Jim Castagnoli, among others. The pro ranks
have been, at one time or another, filled with Bengt
son-tutored linesmen. In addition to some of the
above people, the pros have seen tin services o! Bruno
iianducci, Jim Cox, Hank Norl.erg, Fred Meyers, and
n any more. In the interest of accuracy, I suggest that
our crusading reporters interview these men. They
mp the experts who can best pass on Bcngtson's
qualifications. In any event, Schwartz inherited
Bcngtson. It wasn't considered cricket to refuse a
veteran his old job —remember? Marchie is not the
type of man who seeks a scapegoat, and I cannot
picture his firing Phil Bengt on with a "Sorry, Buddy,
but the wolves are howling, so you've got to go,"
even if we assume thai he has that much control of
the situation under our new SAC setup.
Why all the fuss, anyway? We won six games. The
Michigan loss was no disgrace, nor was the Santa
Clura tie. True, we should have won the UCI.A
i ame, but that is the only one we dropped when we
should have won. As for Cal, the result could easily
have been reversed if our third touchdown had not
I "ii called hack. A piece <>112 bad luck, but certainly
lot the fault of the coaching staff.
'J hough still around, I played frosh hall under
ThornhiU's regime, and put in two years under
!• laughnessy whin Schwartz was backfield coach. I
. m personally convinced that Marchie stands head and
shoulders above his predecessors. He is not only a
gi'eat coach, but also is a student of human nature,
and above all, a gentleman. Anyone can look good

while winning, But Marchie has withstood the test
of a real leader—he held his boys together and was
magnificent in defeat when lesser men would have
given up the ghost.
God spare us from another football automaton like
his predecessor, who failed to maintain good team
morale even with a Rose Bowl championship.
It ien't "sticky goo," Mr. Hall, when I say that the
loss of Marchie Schwartz would be practically ir
replaceable. He always has a word of encouragement
whether the player be first or fifth string. Just as
accumulating money isn't the most important thing
in life, so a winning score isn't the most important
thing in football. However, we won our share this
year.
