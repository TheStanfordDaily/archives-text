To the Editor:
Over a year ago, I indulged in some "letters to
the editor" which were not published by The Daily,
but received attention elsewhere. My theses were:
"1. We should not fire a coach but hire a Presi
dent." I am pleased that we have.
"2. On the basis of results, SAC is far inferior to
the old BAC."
"3. But that is not all, 'the time is overripe for an
investigation of the athletic situation at Stanford.' It
still is. In athletics, generally, our results, both on
the scoreboard and otherwise, are not all that we
could hope for. Nor is comparison with Stanford of
tin past very flattering. Let's investigate everything
in the athletic set-up."
