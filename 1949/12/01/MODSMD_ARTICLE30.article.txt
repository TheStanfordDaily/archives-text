To the Editor:
With regard to recent suggestions by members of
The Daily sports stafi of the need for change in the
chooPs coaching personnel, we would like to murmur
our disapproval of the principle of the thing. We
like to win football games, too, but we don't feel
that it is the place of "punk undergraduate writers"
to uairp the offices of the Board of Trustees, the
President of the University, the Director of Athletics,
and the coaches themselves.
