# Stanford Professor Recommends U.S. Follow Hands-off Policy in Far East
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
A "hands-off" policy towards
China on the part of the United
States was emphatically recom
mended by Professor Gordon F.
Ferris, professor of biology and
curator of entomological collec
tions at the Stanford Museum
who recently returned from the
Far East.
Professor Ferris went to China to
make a collection of scale insects,
but his experiences while doing so
led him to the strong conviction
that the U.S. would do best to leave

China alone. Having talked to nu
merous Chinese and Americans in
the Orient, he maintains that this
country has nothing to gain and
everything to lose in further sup
port of China's Nationalist govern
ment.
Loss Negligible
He believes that the loss of China
as an ally in the event of war would
be negligible. Because the Chinese
have no offensive power whatsoever
—no arms, no navy, etc. — Uncle
Sam would only have to support
China in a losing fight against Rus
sia. The principal loss if the Reds
should succeed in controlling the
vast land would be a loss to the
prestige of American ideals, in that
450,000,000 people would thus fall
under Communist sway.
"This country's initial mistake was
in supporting Chiang Kai-Shek," as
serts the curator. He says that the
civil war was mainly a matter of
getting rid of the Nationalist gov
ernment, and that the U.S. should

have treated the incident simply as
a civil war and nothing else. The
people he met in China spoke of the
American program of financial aid
as "Operation Rathole."
Aid Europe
Instead of wasting men and ma
teriel in the Far East, the professor
advocates that the United States de
vote its attention to aiding Europe
through the Marshall Plan, for he
feels certain that Europe, not Asia,
will be the primary trouble spot of
the world.
Professor Ferris, who has been on
the Stanford faculty since 1917, went
to China in October of 1948 under
the Fullbright Act research pro
gram of the U.S. State Department.
For the next eight months, he and
his wife, assistant curator of the
Dudley Herbarium at Stanford, gath
ered insect and plant specimens in
Southeast China, the only part of
the nation which was not engulfed
by the civil war. He returned pre
maturely in June of this year, bring
ing back with him what he describes
as the largest collection of scale in
sects ever taken from that area.
The couple also spent some time at
Formosa, Kunming, Hong Kong, and
at Lingnan University in Canton.
Their work took them into bandit
infested country, but it was the un
settled political conditions of the
county which necessitated their early
return to the United States.

advocates that the United States de
vote its attention to aiding Europe
through the Marshall Plan, for he
feels certain that Europe, not Asia,
will be the primary trouble spot of
the world.
Professor Ferris, who has been on
the Stanford faculty since 1917, went
to China in October of 1948 under
the Fullbright Act research pro
gram of the U.S. State Department.
For the next eight months, he and
his wife, assistant curator of the
Dudley Herbarium at Stanford, gath
ered insect and plant specimens in
Southeast China, the only part of
the nation which was not engulfed
by the civil war. He returned pre
maturely in June of this year, bring
ing back with him what he describes
as the largest collection of scale in
sects ever taken from that area.
The couple also spent some time at
Formosa, Kunming, Hong Kong, and
at Lingnan University in Canton.
Their work took them into bandit
infested country, but it was the un
settled political conditions of the
county which necessitated their early
return to the United States.
A "hands-off" policy towards
China on the part of the United
States was emphatically recom
mended by Professor Gordon F.
Ferris, professor of biology and
curator of entomological collec
tions at the Stanford Museum
who recently returned from the
Far East.
Professor Ferris went to China to
make a collection of scale insects,
but his experiences while doing so
led him to the strong conviction
that the U.S. would do best to leave

China alone. Having talked to nu
merous Chinese and Americans in
the Orient, he maintains that this
country has nothing to gain and
everything to lose in further sup
port of China's Nationalist govern
ment.
Loss Negligible
He believes that the loss of China
as an ally in the event of war would
be negligible. Because the Chinese
have no offensive power whatsoever
—no arms, no navy, etc. — Uncle
Sam would only have to support
China in a losing fight against Rus
sia. The principal loss if the Reds
should succeed in controlling the
vast land would be a loss to the
prestige of American ideals, in that
450,000,000 people would thus fall
under Communist sway.
"This country's initial mistake was
in supporting Chiang Kai-Shek," as
serts the curator. He says that the
civil war was mainly a matter of
getting rid of the Nationalist gov
ernment, and that the U.S. should

have treated the incident simply as
a civil war and nothing else. The
people he met in China spoke of the
American program of financial aid
as "Operation Rathole."
