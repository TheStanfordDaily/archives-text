# THE DU PONT DIGEST FOR STUDENTS OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
## CARBON MONOXIDE... FRIEND OF MAN Thanks to high-pressure synthesis, it now leads a useful life 
### 
To the man on the street, earbon
monoxide is just a poisonous gas that
sometimes causes tragic deaths when
it escapes from the exhaust of an
automobile or from a poorly tended
furnace.
Outside of the chemical field, few
people arc aware that, properly used,
it is a very real friend of man. In the
last 25 years, during which catalytic

and high-pressure chemical tech
niques have been highly developed,
carbon monoxide has become a key
stone of industrial synthesis.
Scientists have found that under
the proper conditions of high press
ure and temperature, carbon mon
oxide, in combination with other
substances, can be converted to a
variety of' useful products. These or
their derivatives range from an acid
used in tanning hides to the spar
kling plastics in milady's boudoir.

You'd hardly associate carbon mon
oxide with anti-freeze. But at tem
peratures from 1300 to 450° C. and
under pressures of 1500 to 15,000
pounds per square inch, carbon mon
oxide and hydrogen unite to form
methanol —a colorless liquid from
which is made "Zerone" anti-rust
anti-freeze for automobiles. From
methanol and carbon monoxide as
raw materials, ethylene glycol for
"Zfcrex" anti-freeze is produced.

Plastics and Anti-Freeze
Methanol is used also to make a
large number of compounds such as
formaldehyde and methyl metha
crylate. The former goes into urea
and phenol-formaldehyde plasties for
light fixtures, radio cabinets, hard
ware, utensils, and electrical equip
ment. The latter is the basic mate
rial for "Lucite" acrylic resin with
its many uses.

The reaction of methanol with
carbon monoxide leads to acetic acid,
which is a well-known industrial
chemical. By the same synthesis but
substituting ethanol for methanol,
propionic acid is obtained. From it
come the "Myeoban" sodium and
calcium propionates that retard
mold and rope in bakery products.
Synthesis in the Future
Today Du Pont manufactures some
120 different items that are partly
or wholly dependent upon elevated

pressures. However, the possibilities
have by no means been exhausted.
Just recently, for example, chemists
have been learning how to use ear
bon monoxide in "up-grading" cer
tain petroleum hydrocarbons to give
interesting alcohols. One of these,
3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, is prepared
from diisobutylenc by reaction with
carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
College-trained men and women
interested in working in this field at
Du Pont may share in discoveries as
outstanding as any yet achieved.
Because of the wide scope of
Du Font's activities, young graduates
in many different fields have oppor
tunities to select the careers that
prove to suit them best as their abili
ties and interests develop.
