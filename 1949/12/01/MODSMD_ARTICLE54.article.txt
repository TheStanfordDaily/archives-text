# Fijis Tie firemen; ATO Matches SAE
## Intramural Football War Stalemated As Glass, Greenleaf Star for Houses 
### 
Two intramural football classics i
were fought to ties yesterday, when
the Fijis matched the Firehouse, 13 j
to 13, and ATO I fought the SAE i
Purples to a 7 to 7 standstill.
Throughout the first half, both the
ATO's and the SAE's held each j
other for little Rains, and no touch- j
downs. In the second half, however, j
the Purples caught fire and Frank
Cuselly's passes took the team deep
into ATO territory. The first taily of
the game was then made on a pass
play from Casella to Jim Brett. This
same combination also completed
the conversion. The ATO's soon
started on the road to retaliation,
however, and a long series of short
passes and runs was climaxed by a
touchdown pass from Clayton Neili
to Don Glass. Bob Masters then tied
up the ball game ont he conversion
pass from Neill.
Pfyl to Pl y I Scores
The Firehouse boys started off the j
scoring in their game, when Monte
Pfyl crossed the goal line on a run
ning play. A long series of runs
made possible by effective downfield
blocking set up the tally, but the
try lor point was missed and the
score stood at 6 to 0. The Fijis lost
no time, however, in evening up the
odds. John Horth caught a pass
from Skip Kent, and, outdistancing
would-be tacklers, went for a score.
The extra point was missed, and the
score was again even.
Firehouse took to the air in the
second period and a pass from

Monte Pfyl to his brother Frank set
the firemen out in front again. The
conversion was made on a pass play
by the same combination.
In the last minutes of the game
Bi!l Greenleaf of the Fijis inter
cepted a pass, deep in his own ter
ritory, and went all the way for an
other tally. Greenleaf's pass was
good to Jack Porter for the conver
sion, and the nal score stood at 13
to 13.
