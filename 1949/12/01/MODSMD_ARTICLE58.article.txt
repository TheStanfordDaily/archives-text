### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 30 Joe
(Flash) Gordon, Cleveland Indians
second baseman and. an old hand in
the majors, today gave an example
of how a ballplayer should look for
a job.
Gordon wants to leave the ma
jors and play ball in the Pacific-
Coast League so he can be closer to
homeâ€”Oregon.
After he learned the Sacramento
Solons were interested in him, Gor
don today called up a pal of his,
Bartley Cavanaugh, Sacramento city
manager. Cavanaugh said Gordon
asked about the distance from home
plate to the left field wall in the
Solons' stadium and he also asked
the direction of the prevailing winds
over the ball park.
