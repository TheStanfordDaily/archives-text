Mitch, Rupe, Al, Cas, Don, Hal, Ken, Davy, Peck, Untie Dan, Train,
Laakso, Moose, Mickey, Buddy, Johnny .... A bunch of names. A bunch
oi guys that you and I have cheered for and at for many autumns. Good
football players. Good guys. I like them, and hate to see them go, but
I'm not going to cry about that light now.
Rather, I'm going to write about their last season for Stanford. In short,
here comes a recap of the 1949 football season—for better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer.
And as a matter of fact, I think that we had a darn good season. On the
surface, the 6-3-1 figures don't look wonderfully impressive, but when
you get right down to nickels and dimes, the season was a good one. The
best, I think, since 1940.
1o gel the unpleasant things out of the way first, the team lost to: (1)
Michigan, the co-champions of the Big Nine-10; (2) A post-Michigan misery
to a good UCLA squad; (3) and to California, which ended its season rated
the second-best team in the nation.
We were tied, via the fumble route, by Santa Clara, the Orange Eowl
contender, which lost only to the nation's No. 2 and 3 teams.
On the win side of the ledger, the cocky boys from "little punk San Jose"
were tagged, 49-0, and the next week we eked-out a narrow one from
Harvard, 44-0. As the editor of the Harvard Crimson put it, "Stanford
foUnd a small hole at our tackles which extended to the sidelines." The
next week was Michigan, the week alter UCLA. Then, just as the rooting
section began to squirm behind its flash cards, they learned to hate us
in Seattle, 40-0. It was the highest score run up again a U of W team in
Seattle since the last time Stanford did it—in 1893.
The next game saw the Indians trounce Oregon State, 27-7. Then came
Santa Clara, and then came the jackpot.
As I left the Coliseum late in the afternoon of November 5, I had one
wonderful thought in mind, "They love us in Los Angeles." This wasn't
exactly the truth, because there are a number of people who don't .like
us at all down there, ,but at any rate we beat the Trojans, 34-13.
Idaho was the dirtiest Lull club we played last year. Final score: G3-0.
Then came Cal.'
Stanford: P(](] Offensive Leader
Stanford led the PCC in total offense; was third—behind Cal and Ore
gon—in total defense, and was second—to Cal—in ground defense. (Mon
tana led the Coast in pass defense, but then who has to pass to beat Mon
tana?)
Team statistics read this-away: Stanford made 166 first downs to their
opponents' 145, made 2,481 yards to the opponents' 1,477, and had 508 yards
in punt returns to their opponents' 206. We lost the ball 17 times on
fumbles to our opponents' 15.
The varsity this year broke a Stanford team scoring record that has
stood since 1929. The Schwartzmen scored 292 points to their opponents'
101. The '29 aggregation had scored 288 points in 11 games.
High score man for the Indian squad was quarterback Gary Kerkorian,
who came up with a grand total of 56 points—three touchdowns, one field
goal, and 35 extra points. Boyd Benson was second in scoring for the Cards
with 42 points. Bud Klein tallied for 36, Harry Hugasian for 30. Emery
Mitchell and Boh White were tied with 24 points apiece, and Bill DeYoung,
Bill McColl, and Ken Rose each scored 18 points for the Big Red. Dan
Mervin got in there for 12.
'Eight-Yard' Andrews Pares Harks
In the rushing department, seven Stanford backs averaged over five
yards per carry, and these were led by speedster Rupe Andrews, who
boomed out a fancy eight-per-try. "Eight-yard" Andrews lugged the mail
40 times for a total ot 338 yards. Behind Andrews was game buster Boh
While, who ripped off 6.2 yards per try, and then "The Big Train" Bill
DeYoung, who averaged 6.1 yards per carry. Harry Hugasian averaged
5.6, Eric Southwood hit 5.4, Bud Klein danced for 5.2, and Boyd Benson
went for 5.1 in 60 carries.
Fullback Emery Mitchell—who rates as one of the greatest collegiate
fulls I have ever seen—led the Conference in punting. While Mitch's spe
cialty was cutting down rival ends like a scythe in a wheatfield, he punted
40 times for an average of 40.9 yards. Behind Mitch in the punting de
partment in the PCC were SC's Jim rowers (10.4), Carpenter of OSC (39.1),
and WSC's Don Paul (37.9).
A run-down of the Conference statistics puts Stanford players in this
position: Mitchell, first in punting, Rose, third—to Montana's Bauer and
Oregon's Robinson—in pass receiving. McColl behind UCLA's Wilkinson
—was fifth in pass -receiving. Dave Field, defensive ace, was third in pass
interceptions. Bill DeYoung was fifth in punt returns. Gary Kerkorian
was second in placekicking. Hugasian was seventh in the Conference in
rushing. Kerkorian was fourth in passing.
And we just beat the blazes out of USC.
I guess this column has been too statistical to be really deadly, but it
sure as heck has some facts in it. And it says a few things you might
like to know.
