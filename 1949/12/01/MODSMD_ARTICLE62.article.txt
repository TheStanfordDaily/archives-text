# 49ers Will Play Yankees!
## Strike Ends; Team To Play Sans Bonus 
### AL BERRY 
San Francisco's Forty-Niner football team, in a near-all-night
meeting last night, decided to forget their financial difficulties with
their owners, and to keep on paying their obligation to the fans.
It was one of the few times in pro-rank history that the people
who yell their lungs out were considered more important than the

almighty dollar. Hut the Forty- I
Nitiers are that kind of a football '
team.
They stated this in a press release |
given by telephone to The Daily late ;
last night. They also stated their
firm belief that the business princi- ;
pies involved in their demand for
monetary compensation for playing
next Sunday's AAC playoff witli the j
New York Yankees was in all ways
fair and just. They also left no doubt
that they had been 100 per cent be- j
hind their representatives to the I
owners, Norm Standlee and Lennie
Eshmont, when the pair presented
the team's demands to the owners.
The official statement is as follows: I
"It is the unanimous decision of
the Forty-Niner football team that
our first and most important obliga
tion is to the fans who have sup
ported us so loyally. We leel the j
same gratitude to our coaching staff.
"The matter of business principles
which brought about the difference
of opinion between the squad and
the ownership is something that is j
definitely secondary in the hearts ot
the team as compared with our ob
ligation to our fans. We have, there
fore, elected to enter next Sunday's
contest with a most determined will
to win."
"The San Francisco Forty-Niner
squad would like it definitely under
stood that Norm Standlee and Len
nie Eshmont were merely expressing
the sentiments of the entire squad
and not necessarily their own views
on the subject.
"We still feel our principles in
volved in requesting remuneration
for Sunday's game was most fair and
sound, since all of us were under the
impression at the time we signed our
1949 contracts that compensation for
this game would be forthcoming."
And thus a great football team

gave its answer to their owners' very
abrupt ultimatum of yesterday after
noon. Arid thus a very unpleasant
situation that threatened to shake
;.he very foundations ol the All —
America Conlerence was solved.
The argument started yesterday
when Coach Buck Shaw's lootball
team did not report lor their morn
ing practice session at Menlo Park.
Team Captain Norm Standlee and
veteran halfback Lennie Eshmont,
at the same time, were informing
'49er co-owners Tony and Vic Mo
rabito that the team had voted to
"strike" for an undisclosed sum of
extra spending money before meet
ing the Yankees in the AAC play
off in Kezar Sunday.
Although it was not released, at
the time, just what the players' de
mands were, several sources were
ready to speculate. Some talk said
that they were demanding a Hat $500
per player. But later the Morabitos
said the players had asked for one
game's pay—which would mean an
added one-twelfth of each gridster's
contract.
But yesterday the Morabito
brothers were abrupt and definite
in their stand. In a statement re
leased to the Associated Press, the
Morabitos said: "We've given them
until 9:30 tomorrow morning to
show up for practice in uniform at
Menlo Park and, if they do not do
it, they are to turn in their suits,
the season is over, we will forfeit
our game to the Yankees, and that
is hie end of it. This is not a bluff.
We're not kidding."
Sunday's game will determine
whether the '49ers or the Yankees
would play the winner of the Cleve
land Brown-Buffalo Biil game for
the league championship.
