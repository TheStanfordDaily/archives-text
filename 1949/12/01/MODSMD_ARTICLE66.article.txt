# Cravath Tabs Ohio St. Over Cal Rose Bowl
## 
### 
TULSA, Nov. 30 (/P> â€” Take it
from a fellow who suffered against
j both, Ohio Stale will beat California
in the Rose Bowl January 2.
That's the opinion of Jeff Cravath,
I Southern California coach, whose
eleven lied Ohio State, 13-13, and
; lo: t to California, 10-10, on a last
minute touchdown run of 100 yards.
Cravath, visiting friends here to
| day, said "Ohio State almost chased
us out of the park. Much as I'd like
to see Lynn's (Lynn Waldorf) team
j win, I think Ohio State will grab it.
They've got great running backs. We
played California on even terms, upd
might have won."
