Students who wisli u send Christ- |
! mas pat kages or cards abroad but j
; have no personal acquaintances in j
foreign countries, may obtain ad
dresses and names at the SIRO of- |
fice.
CARE packages may be sent j
through SIRO, or students may send j
gifts directly to the name and ad- j
dress they select, according to Don !
Makosky, SIRO co-chairman.
If CARE packages are sent, the
Post Oflice guarantees delivery by
Christmas time. However, the Post i
| Office has refused to guarantee
Christmas time delivery of any indi- i
j vidual packages sent abroad this late, !
Persons at the 11R office have of
| fered to suggest appropriate items
to be included in an individual pack-
I age.
CARE packages costing either
| $4.75 or $10 contain various things, j
j There are seven or eight types, com- j
posed of different kinds of foods, one :
i with blankets, and one with books.
Several corridors at Branner have I
| already chosen names from the SIRO |
files and are sending CARE pack
| ages.
