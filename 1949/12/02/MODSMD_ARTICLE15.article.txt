## Frosh, Soph Pre-Reg Is In Progress 
### 
Final figures on pre-registra
tion for upper-division and grad
uate students released yester
day by Registrar H. Donald Win
bigler showed that approxi
mately 3,100 students had turned
in their study lists.
Winbigler estimated that this figure
represented a slight increase in the
usual prc-reg totals. However, he
said that after final registration next
January, upper-division and gradu
ate totals would probably reach about
5,400.
Lower-division students pre-reg
today and continue through Tuesday.
Today is the final day for student
adviser meetings, during which stu
dents fiil out their official study list
for approval of advisers.
Pre-reg officials alerted students
once more about the newly-insti
tuted class list system which replaces
the use of seat cards. Class lists must
be signed at the Nitery.
The following procedure, which is
included in the Winter Quarter Time
Schedule should be followed by stu
dents:
1. See your adviser today for ap
proval and signature of your official
study lists.
2. If study lists include any courses
requiring seat cards, si(?n the appro
priate class list at the Nitery during
the time assigned to you on appoint
ment slips.
3. Turn in official study list, in per
son, to a registration clerk at the
Nitery.
If any lower-division student did
not receivc an appointment slip
through the mail, he should go to
room 55, Temporary Building B.
The Registrar's Office announced
that grades for returning students
will be enclosed in the Reg Books
available on Reg Day, January 3.
Students not returning winter
quarter who want their grades sent
to them should leave a self-addressed
stamped envelope at room 60, Tem
porary Building A.
