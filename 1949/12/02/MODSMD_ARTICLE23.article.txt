# Italians Ignore Strike Summons
## 
### 
ROME, Dec. 1 (JP) —The vast ma
jority of Italian workers ignored the
Communist call for a 24-hour gen
eral strike today. Activity was al
most normal except among heavy
industries of the north, seat of the
party's main strength.
The strike was called by the Com
munist-led General Confederation
of Labor (CGIL) to protest the
death of two peasants in southern
Italy in a brush with police Tuesday.
Government officials said the
strike was a failure, cxccpt in the
north. They called it a "Communist
political demonstration." Though
the CGIL appealed yesterday to all
workers to join the strike "against
the barbarous massacres in the
south," a spokesman issued a quali
fication today.
"The strike was not intended to
paralyze the nation," he tod a re
porter. "It w.is only a limited pro
test."
It, appeared to impartial observers
to be comparable to the eight-hour
walkout called by the CGIL Oct. 28,
which also proved widely disregard
ed. Thai strike, too, was arranged to
protest bloodshed in the south.
