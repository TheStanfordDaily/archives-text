# Cagers Crush COP, 75-49
## Yardley, Chavalas Shine in Card Hoop Frenzy 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's all-white cagers, breezing the entire distance,
grabbed the COP Tigers by the tail last night and tossed them for
a lop-sided, 75-49, loss.
A capacity-Pavilion crowd watched Everett Dean's new speed
machine run through its season debut with amazing ease as a

Chavalas-Yardley scoring combina-'
tion completely overwhelmed the
tired Tigers.
big Gecrge Yardley, never looking
better, repeated last season's effort
against COP by dumping in 22 points,
mostly off passes from Gus Chavalas.
George score from close in and from
far out, and brought "ahhh's" from
the crowd with his driving "stuff"
shots.
Fast-Dribbling (ius
But it was Gus Chavalas who stole
the first-night show. Only hitting 2
points for himself, the fast-dribbling
Chavalas turned in one of the finest
play-making passing games ever wit
nessed in the Pavilion cracker-box.
With the score at 14 to 6, Chavalas
started the landslide with pass-off
scores to Yardley and Marv Gelber,
dumped in a 25-foot push shot, and
then, caught in a jam under the
bucket, he passed behind his back to
Yardley who flipped over his shoulder
to make it 22-6 before COP could
take a second breath.
Free Throw
That's how hot the Indians were

last night. From the opening moment
when Marv Gelber scored a free
throw until the final gun when Jack
O'Sullivan did the same, Stanford
successfully peppered the hoop from
all angles.
Kris Kjeldson's Tigers just couldn't
stay with the swift. Hank Pfister and
Howard Pearce managed to ring up
7- and 6-point totals, but otherwise
no COP man was able to score more
than two buckets.
Marv Gelber and Jim Walsh, both
playing prominent roles in the suc
cessful fast-break and in controlling
Ac boards, whipped in 11 points
apiece for runners-up honors in the
scoring.

on his 12-man squad, including Gary
Andrews who also played in the jun
ior varsity prelim.
It was one of those nights when
everything seems to go just right.
Ralph Carver and Jim Ramstead took
turns at running the key, with the
rugged Carver showing very well in
the early moments of both halves.
Looked Sharp
As a whole, Stanford's starting unit,
that of Yardley and Walsh at for
wards, Carver, at center, and Cha
valas and Gelber at guards looked
sharper in this season's opener than
Stanford did last year.
There's more hustle and ball
hawking. Gone is the fancy poise,
but this club looks as though it will
develop into a good scrapping out
fit.
However, things might be different
tomorrow night when Stanford runs
into San Jose State who last night
conquered the Bay Area kings, USF,
in a convincing 43-38 upset.
