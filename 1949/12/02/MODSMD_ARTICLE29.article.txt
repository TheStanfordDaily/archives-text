# Weekend Spent Studying Underground Mysteries
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Exploring underground is the
weekend work of the Stanford Grotto
of the National Speliological Society.
Six members of the club summed
up a total of 12 hours underground
last weekend exploring the little
known Lost Soldier's Cave in the
southern part of Sequoia National
Park.
Such weekend excursions as this,
held two or three times a quarter,
are actually more than a jaunt to look
at caves. Most of the members go in
order to study geology and biology
underground, as A 1 Leviton, one of
the charter members put it. They ex
plore and map the eaves and take
photographs of many of the forma
tions.
200 Feet Down
Equipped with climbing ropes and
carbide lamps, the group penetrated
the Lost Soldier's cave to a depth of
200 feet, descended vertical shafts,
and crawled through hundreds of
feet of winding passageways.
They were unable to completely
explore the cave, however, for their
equipment—rope and tackle—was not
adequate to meet with a 300-foot
drop-off encountered in the lower
level of the cave.

The Cave Clubbers observed many
colorful formations in the limestone
cave. They also found an orange and
black cave salamander and many
long-eared hats hanging from the
ceiling.
The group found items o! biological
interest last year, too. G'n an excur
sion into Mercer's Caverns com
mercial caves in northern California
—the Stanford Club found some small
rabbit bones and small cave spiders.
In a nearby cave they also found
Indian relics - bones and beads.
Besides the biology and geology
students, there are some members
who go along just for the fun of
climbing about in caves and the ex
citement of scaling the smooth, slip
pery cave walls.
Local Organization
The local Grotto has been in exist
ence since last November, when it
was organized by four students here.
The National Speliological Society it
self is only nine years old.
NSS files which contain informa
tion of all sorts about caves through
out the nation have been compiled
through just such excursions as the
members of the local Grotto take.
These files were of great importance
during the last war when many un
derground caves were used for stor
age.
Since its organization last year, the
Stanford Grotto has explored 15 dif
ferent caves in California.
Participating in last week's excur
sion were Chet Wrucke, Bill Moore,
Art Lunge, Ed Dunehy, Neal Bosticle,
and Bob Hackman.
