# On Your Dial-880
## 
### 
With "Friday Night Request
Time" from 7 to 11 tonight, KZSU
engineers will lower the curtain on
autumn quarter broadcasting.
Until January 8, 1950, 880 on your
dial will present nothing but static.
On that date, the campus station will
regain its voice and begin airing
music, comedy, drama, sports, news,
special features, and commercials.
Signups ioi- staff positions will be
taken January 4 and 5. Tryouts for
next quarter's Stanford Sadie will
be held at the same time.
