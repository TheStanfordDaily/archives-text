# Capture of Swatow Ends Linen Trade
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Not so many people noticed the
obscure little item in the press re
cently announcing the fall of the
town of Swatow to the Chinese Com
j munists. The fall of Swatow did not
only mean that the Chinese Com
munists were once more victorious.
It also meant that, women through
out America will have to pay higher
prices for those fine embroidered
handkerchiefs to which they have
been accustomed, for Swatow, a
small seaport some 180 miles from
the British Colony of Hong Kong, is
the home of embroidered handker
chiefs.
Each year about five million yards
of fine linen and 44,000 pounds of
embroidery yarn are imported to
Swatow for the manufacture of
handkerchiefs. The materials are
made into some 24,000,000 women's
handkerchiefs and more than a mil
lion men's handkerchiefs. More
than 90 per cent of the finished prod
ucts are exported to the United
States; the remainder goes to Eng
land, Australia, Canada, Switzerland,
Cuba, and other .countries.
But witn tne Communists now in
control, further supplies of hand
kerchiefs cannot be assured, and this
uncertainty regarding future supplies
has already pushed the prices up for
stocks of handkerchiefs which ar*j
now in the hands of American deal
ers.
Commission in Chefoo
When the Communists took over
Chefoo, the home of embroidered ta
blecloths and luncheon sets in North
ern China, they set up a commission
and forced manufacturers to sell
them all the finished products at a
certain fixed price. The manufac
turers were paid in "The People's
Money" which, of course, was not
recognized outside Communist areas.
Even within the Communist areas,
workmen refused to accept the Com
munist money and demanded pay
ments for work in a more stable
currency.
The manufacturers naturally suf
fered heavy losses, and as a result,
some of the goods were smuggled to
Hong Kong by junks and then re
exported to various parts of the
world. Some of the Swatow manu
facturers are of the opinion sim
ilar tactics might be adopted if the
Communists set up a commission in
Swatow.
No Factory
There is a total of 120 drawnwork
firms registered in Swatow, and ap
proximately 600,000 people in the vi
cinity are engaged in the trade.
However, Swatow cannot be, con
ceived as a town sprawling with
manufacturing plants and factories.
On the contrary, not a single em
broidery factory can be found there.
The only places resembling factories
are the places where the finishing
touches such as laundering and
packing of the handkerchiefs are
done before they are exported.
The embroidery work on the hand
kerchiefs is not done by a regular
stafi of workmen. The work is done

entix'ely by farmers and their fam
ilies during their spare moments, es
pecially in between harvests. The
farmers in the vicinity take on this
part-time work in order to augment
the meager income from their crops.
Agents employed by the various
firms make their rounds of the
farms, bringing the farmers the ma
terials for their work and collecting
the finished products.
Before the town of Swatow actu
ally fell to the Communists, Commu
nist guerrillas .were already in pos
session of most of the areas sur
rounding the town. Throughout the
period preceding the fall of the
town, the moving to and fro of the
agents was not hampered in any
way by the Communists. Occasion
ally the Communists would examine
the goods, but they never confis
cated any of them. Some of the
agents declared that the Communists
were often helpful in protecting them
against bandits.
Cost of Production
The quality of the handkerchiefs
varies greatly. The cost of labor on
the cheapest types of handkerchiefs
is about 35 cents per dozen. The cost
rises steadily until it reaches $50 per
dozen for the most expensive hand
kerchiefs. By the time these ex
pensive handkerchiefs reach the re
tail market in America, they sell for
as much as $20 each. The workman
ship on these handkerchiefs is so
delicate the people engaged in mak
ing them continuously usually go
partially blind within live years.
The embroidery trade has centered
around Swatow for so long that it is
now impossible to shift it elsewhere.
In the first place, all the skilled
workmen are around Swatow, and in
the second place, nowhere can labor
and production costs be as low as in
that area. One Swatow firm did at
tempt to start a drawnwork factory
in Hong Kong, however. The com
pany persuaded a number of Swa
tow farmers to go to Hong Kong,
but the high wages paid to the work
men there because of the high cost
of living, and the high cost of pro
duction, soon put the company out
of business. Therefore, until the
Communist regime is recognized by
America, it is unlikely that there will
be any further supplies of the hand
made handkerchiefs.
