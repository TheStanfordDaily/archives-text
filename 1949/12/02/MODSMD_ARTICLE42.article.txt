The Cap and Gown calendar sale,
held each year to raise funds for
scholarships for two Stanford women,
is still in progress.
The sale has been very successful,

been sold directly on campus and by
mail order to alumnae throughout
the country. This year the Hoover

to send to its representatives all over
the world.
