# An Insufficient Offering?

### 
An extraordinarily large number of com
plaints have reached our desk that there just
aren't enough upper-division courses being of
fered next quarter.
As we remember, it's always been tough to
find the right courses to take during winter
quarter as compared with autumn and spring
when more non-prerequisite courses are of
fered. But this year, in many cases at least,
students have found it almost impossible to fill
their programs with courses that they want to
take, or that are related to their major.
Complaints have come most often from po
litical science, sociology, econ, and history stu
dents.
We've checked around a bit, and the"I
might as well drop out of school winter quar
ter" attitude seems to be pretty widespread.
We asked for opinions at the ASSU Excom
meeting last night, and got the same answers.
It's difficult to understand why courses
should be in such short supply during winter
quarter, and this winter in particular.
It may be just the imaginations of many of

those who are ready to graduate, and who have
already taken nearly all the subjects they need
and want. But after listening to so many sob
stories from students who are having trouble
getting enough units to complete their major,
we're beginning to doubt it.
The answer may be that although there are
approximately the same number of upper-di
vision courses offered during winter as there
are in fall or spring, the proportion of continua
tion courses —courses requiring the comple
tion of a prerequisite for admission—is sub
stantially greater.
This means that a student who takes the first
course in a series in the fall, and then who
wishes to drop the group and pick up some
other subject during winter quarter will have
difficulty finding another course which he
needs because so many of them require pre
requisites that he has not taken.
This is our theory, but we are not qualified
to call it more than that. We wish the depart
ment heads would check into the matter with
an eye toward opening up more courses next
quarter.
