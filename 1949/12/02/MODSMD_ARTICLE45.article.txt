# Football Coachesâ€”Conclusion
## 
### 
The Stanford Athletic Council will meet
Saturday, December 10, to discuss the contro
versy that has centered around the football
coaching staff.
We're glad that this thing, messy as it is,
will finally be pulled into the open and dis
cussed sensibly over a conference table.
The Daily has been instrumental in focusing
the attention of the student body on this dispute
which has smouldered behind the coaches'
back for the past two years, but we're not ex
actly proud of it.
Our point is that many students have ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the coaching staff
as a whole or in part, and we feel that it is the
function of The Daily to serve as a sounding
board for student opinion on the controversy.
It is regrettable that the whole thing has gotten
so out of hand that persons on both sides have
lost sight of the original issue.
The fact remains that Stanford's football rec

ord under the present coaching staff is not im
pressive, and that some students would like to
see a change. Anything said beyond that can
only be labeled as opinion.
When opinions are expressed, there is much
to be said for Marchie Schwartz and his assist
ants as well as what has already been said
against them.
The proper place for those opinions to be
expressed is around the SAC conference table
where representatives of the student body, the
faculty, and the alumni can meet and discuss
the whole problem rationally.
Because the Stanford Athletic Council, as it
now exists, has no power to take direct action
it does not mean that we will have heard the
end of the controversy once it has been dis
cussed by this body, but it certainly will help.
The sooner this thing can be cleared up the
better. It is regrettable that such a conference
could not have been scheduled at an earlier
date.
