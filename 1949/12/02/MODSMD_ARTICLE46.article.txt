To the Editor:
In reply to a graduate student's letter finding "prog
ress" in the Big Red Machine's rise from national ob
scurity in 1947-48, the latest Associated Press grid
poll places Stanford not 12th in the nation as stated, but
an "also ran" 25th. For all practical purposes, this
might be termed obscurity.

To the Editor:
Freedom of the press has always been an eagerly
sought privilege; it is unfortunate that the same seek
ers of freedom have not always been as eager in
st arching out the responsibility of the press as well.
It is my earnest belief that the responsibility of the
press in matters of truth, fair play, and decency have
been flagrantly violated in the Daily recently by your
s; oi ts editor, one John Breier, in his vituperative at
tacks upon Mr. Bengtson. It is my contention that he
s deliberately lied about this matter, since it began
Ly in3idiously subverting facts and twisting state
r. tnts. By brazen innuendo and a hypocritical con
cern for his sources of information, he has tried to
rake a personal feud appear like a public service in
the public prints.
Item No. 1: In 1946, Breier turned out for football
here and was assigned to tho Braves. By his own ad-
he "probably" couldn't have amounted to very
h as a lineman. One day Bengtson strolled over
a'.ch the Braves and according to Breier, "He
1 d us like dogs."
' -m No. 2: In the spring of 1949 in the coach's office,.
L'. n r ;tson rnd Breier, in a heavy and asinine argument,
exchanged harsh words about the 1947 football team,
Breier insisting (as he still does) that the team that
year should have employed the single-wing system
instead of the T-formation. (Bengtson was a single
wing tackle at Minnesota.)
Item No. 3: In the fall of 1949 at a blackboard session
for the team. Bengtson requested Breier to leave (he
did) because he could no longer tolerate Breier's in
terference and sarcasm concerning Bengtson's au
thority and control over the team.
Item No. 4: In the fall of 1948 and 1949 on the football
practice fields—and I wish I had a nickel for every time
it happened—Breier continuously plagued Bengtson
about why he didn't play Schmoe or Schnok or Pickle
hcad instead of White or Rau or Castagnoli. Breier
insisted that these amiable but left-footed friends of
his were being wasted on the Braves; Bengtson would
patiently reply that he would continue to play the
men he considered superior. And so on, ad infinitum,
ad nauseum.
Perhaps this is not enough evidence to convince

Breier that, he is fighting a grudge battle anil 1 know
Breier would deny it though he were being burned
at the stake, which unfortunately can't happen any
more—but then I am not that fond of hi.s pipe to have
been constantly by his side so as to have observed him
every time he made a damn fool of himself.
By his own criterion of qualification to pontificate
in this matter, since he has observed the team for
three years and knows whereof he speaks, let me coun
ter with this: Mayfield Ike has watched Stanford teams
practice for 25 years or more, and should be at least
eight times more qualified to give a considered opinion.
And I doubt if even Breier in his most vindictive opin
ion would say he knows more of football than Bengt
son. And yet he knows of many boys who should be
playing ahead of the men Bengtson uses on the varsity.
Breier points out that Stanford earned its mark of
being the second best defensive team in the PCC
against a rushing attack at the expense of its pass de
fense. He conveniently forgot to add that 10 teams
managed to score only three touchdowns by passes.
If the Stanford line played so poorly all season as
his criticism of the line coach insists, perhaps some of
the blame should be rightly laid at Breier's door.
Maybe Bengtson would have been able to spend more
time teaching the linemen if he hadn't had to spend
as much time devising defenses against Breier.
