# Relief Drive

### 
To the Editor:
In her letter Miss Engvall states that the totals of
the Fall Relief Drive could have been raised by con
tacting every off-campus student personally for con
tributions to the drive.
I certainly agree to this idea. However, looking
through the ASSU files on off-campus students, the
drive personnel found almost three thousand mimes
and addresses, some as far north as San Francisco,
and some as far south as San Jose. In order to contact
these people personally, almost 300 solicitors would
have been needed. As Miss Engvall pointed out, so
licitation in the living groups was not what it should
have been for a successful campaign. Taking three
hundred solicitors away from the total number would
have made on-campus solicitation much worse, if not
impossible.
The ASSU files were used to make up a list for
sending letters to each off-campus student, and there
was a booth at the Union and the Post Ollice to take
donations.
Thanks to Miss Engvall for showing enough interest
in the drive to give her suggestions and criticisms.
