# 'Street Scene' Rated Success Despite Handicap of Small Space
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
"Street Scene," Elmer* Rice's
graphic and realistic portrait of New
York tenement life, received an en
thusiastic and generally tense per
formance Wednesday night by the
Stanford Players under the direc
tion of Morton Zieve.
The theme of Rice's Pulitzer Prize
play seemed to be that it matters
not what the individual does in this
world but rather what he is. And,
according to Rice, everyone is only
what he makes himself in his strug
gle to rise above his fears and his
environment in a rather vicious
modern civilization.
The villain of the piece is the en
vironment, in this case the slums of
New York's Ninth Avenue. It's a
pretty brutal and all-encompassing
villain.
Enthusiastic Interpretation
The Stanford Players' production
of "Street Scene" was an enthusi

astic attempt to reproduce Rice's
slice of vicious sociology with all the
irony, defeat, and sense of futility
that the playwright intended.
Occasionally the production strove
too hard for striking a dramatic ef
fect or forewarning symbol at the
expense of subtlety, and once in a
while the enthusiasm of the players
tended to destroy the audience at
tention rather than sharply focus it.
The concentration of many players
in the small space of the Little The
ater emphasized this weakness.
Little Theater Confining
The acting took on an unfair arti
ficiality, unfair in that while the ac
tion was excellently directed and
portrayed for "Street Scene," it was
thus not right for the Little Theater.
The feeling came that you were not
sitting on an opposite curb viewing
an unfolding "street scene," but
rather that you had stepped into a
make-up room and had caught the
actors undressed or reading their
lines for effect.
This feeling persisted despite the
finely constructed set which was a
superb piece of realistic yet con
densed scenery.
The principals, however, stood up
quite well, despite this handicap, in
what were some very difficult roles.
Tense Moments
It was the touches, though, that
made the play. For example, the
climax of the shooting was beauti
fully done. There are probably few
more tense moments in current dra
matic literature than the one pre
ceding the discovery of Mrs. Maur

rant's infidelity. The climaxes were
well directed and executed, as was
the mounting political argument on
the steps of the tenement. Perhaps
the best group portrait was tiiat of
the Joneses. Hal Burdick Jr. did
well by an excellently written part.
And the two Anns, Ann Guilbert
and Anne Lawder, were excellent,
as usual, in bit parts. These three
seemed to be able to cast character
with single lines, and were the only
ones in the cast who could swear
without seeming to be conscious of
the dirty words involved.
