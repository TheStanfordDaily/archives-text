# Tryouts Set For Comedy
## 
### 
Tryouts for the musical comedy
"Connecticut Yankee" have been
tentatively scheduled for the first
week of the winter quarter. Times
and plates will be announced at a
later date.
Written by Rodgers and Hart,
"Connecticut Yankee" marks the
first musical comedy produced at
Stanford since 1942.
The production calls for a cast of
20, a chorus of 40, a dance group
of 20, and a 22-piece orchestra.
According to F. Cowles Strick
land, director of the play, tryouts
are open to anyone in the Univer
sity. Strickland particularly stressed
the fact that singers, dancers, or
members of the orchestra need have
no professional experience.
He did stipulate, however, that
members of the University Chorus
or University Orchestra will not be
able to try for parts. The Univer
sity Band is the only one of the
musical organizations which does
not have conflicting performances.
