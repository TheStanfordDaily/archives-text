II()N(i KONG —The Red armies of
China, v/ith their foes in flight from
fallen Chungking, were striking out
today in an attempt to crush the last
Nationalist government resistance
on the mainland.
Only in the south, on the front
west of Canton, was there any hint
of Nationa'ist resistance. A Chinese
press dispatch said a big battle was
in progress there. Ther«* was no
confirmation elsewhere.
The Communists raced out from
Chungking along the road to Cheng
tu, the new refugee Nationalist cap
ital 170 miles to the Northwest.
