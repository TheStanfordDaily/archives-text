# Professor and Two Students Take Flight South of Border
## 
### 
Professor Alfred R. Sumner of
Stanford always did like to travel by
air, but now he's more convinced than
ever that flying is the thing.
Dr. Sumner, Professor Paul F.
Griflin, and two students in the Geog
raphy Department at Stanford, made
an aerial field trip to Lower Cali
fornia and Northern Mexico last
weekend. They flew in Dr. Sumner's
Stainson 165-horsepower, four-place
cabin plane.
The party left the Palo Alto Airport
early Wednesday afternoon and
crossed into Mexico on Thanksgiving
Day after spending the night at Palm
Springs. Because of inaccurate in
formation given them, they failed to
x'each Hermosillo, inland city and
capital of the Mexican state of So
nora.
Darkness forced them to make a
landing in a dry lake bed that night.
Dr. Sumner decided the next morning
that it would not be safe to attempt a
take-ofT with the entire party aboard;
so he made a solo flight to Hermo
sillo.
It took him 14 minutes to fly to the
city, but it took him more than four
hours to return in a friendly farm'
er's car to pick up his companions,

after bumping across the roadless
terrain of the Sonoran desert.
The party returned to Hermosillo
and then made the return trip to Palo
Alto by air by way of the Gulf of
California, Bakersficld, and Salinas.
Georgraphy students making the
trip were Henry W. Beecher Jr., for
mer American vice-consul in Hun
gary, and Oric C. Adcock, senior from
Nebraska.
Dr. Sumner is scheduled to teach
a course at Stanford during the win
ter quarter entitled "The Geography
of Aviation."
