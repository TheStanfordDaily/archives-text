"Maison Frangaise," came the tele
phonic salutation of DA 3-3733. "A
qui voulcz-vous parler?"
"Uh .... excuse me. I thought
this was the Oaks." The receiver
clicked with finality, leaving the
startled inmate of the French House
to sufTcr once more from the growing
pains of internationalism.
Ever since the beginning of autumn
quarter, the comfortable brown
house, hidden from the Firehouse and
Post Office by a cluster of oaks, has
been dedicated to the pursuit of all
things French (with due respect to
the Fundamental Standard).
The hall has become a gallery of
French scenes and colorful maps; |
Time, Life, and The Saturday Eve
ning Past have been replaced by Air
France Magazine and Le Gargon as
living room reading matter; many of
the notices on the house bulletin
board arc in French.
At dinner in Union's dining room,
reserved tables are filled nightly with
16 "parley-ing" mademoiselles; only
when the conversation becomes un
usually interesting are lapses into
English permitted.
Twice a week the Maison's charm
ing French R.A.-instructor, Mrs. A.,
H. Diamond, holds conversation
classes expressly for her "jeunes
femmes."
In addition to its November 13 de
but—a tea honoring the French Con
sulate of San Francisco as well as
Stanford officials—Maison Frangai.se
has hostessed the University French
Department at after-dinner coffees.
There are unofficial and less ob
vious manifestations of the Conti
nental air known only to frequent
French House visitors. On cool au
tumn nights the musty odor of in
cense—purported to recreate the at
mosphere found in French cathedrals
—would put to shame the average
Chinese opium den.
Daily calesthenies are done to the
rhythm of Gallic chants, while paint
ings by Picasso, Monet, and Gaugin
line bedroom walls once dotted with
Big Game ticket stubs and menus
from Dinah's.
With each passing week Maison
Frangaise has gained in prestige and
good will. Avid, if unofficial, sup
port has come to it from the Insti
tute of International Relations, whose
president frequently visits the house
to deliver impeccably his single
French phrase (gleaned from a per
fume bottle): "Montrez-moi!"

has hostessed the University French
Department at after-dinner coffees.
There are unofficial and less ob
vious manifestations of the Conti
nental air known only to frequent
French House visitors. On cool au

cense—purported to recreate the at
mosphere found in French cathedrals
—would put to shame the average
Chinese opium den.
Daily calesthenies are done to the
rhythm of Gallic chants, while paint

line bedroom walls once dotted with
Big Game ticket stubs and menus

With each passing week Maison
Frangaise has gained in prestige and
good will. Avid, if unofficial, sup

"Uh .... excuse me. I thought
this was the Oaks." The receiver
clicked with finality, leaving the
startled inmate of the French House
to sufTcr once more from the growing
pains of internationalism.
Ever since the beginning of autumn
quarter, the comfortable brown
house, hidden from the Firehouse and
Post Office by a cluster of oaks, has
been dedicated to the pursuit of all
things French (with due respect to
the Fundamental Standard).

living room reading matter; many of

board arc in French.
At dinner in Union's dining room,
reserved tables are filled nightly with
16 "parley-ing" mademoiselles; only
when the conversation becomes un
usually interesting are lapses into
English permitted.
