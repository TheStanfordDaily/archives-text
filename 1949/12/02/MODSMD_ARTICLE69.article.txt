# AWS Raises $127 For Scholarship
## 
### 
About $127 was cleared by AWS in
the Gaieties food sales, Diane Porter,
president of AWS, said at Cabinet
meeting yesterday.
This is over half the amount that
must be made during the year to
make up the AWS Scholarship. A
fashion show will be given Spring
Quarter to raise the rest of the money.
Activities of NSA were outlined
by Timmy Levison at the meeting.
She pointed out that NSA and AWS
can get together by having the house
presidents explain the NSA plans to
the women in the houses.
Some of these plans include an
intercollegiate ticket bureau, a choral
festival, discussion groups on na
tional NSA policy, setting up women's
housing according to majors, and
having women's inter-house ex
changes.
