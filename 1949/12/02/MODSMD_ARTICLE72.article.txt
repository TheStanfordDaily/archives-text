# Gridders Will Leave Dec. 29
## 
### 
Athletic Director A 1 Masters an
nounced last night that the travel
ing squad for Stanford's Pineapple
Bowl appearance against the Uni
versity of Hawaii on Jon. 2 had not
been completed at that time.
Masters explained that many of
the team members have not as yet
disclosed their post - season plans.
Some of the Indian gridders are ex
pected to accept invitations to the
annual Shrine East - West game at
Kezar Stadium December 31 which
would, of course, exclude these men
from the Bowl game.
Stanford's team will depart from
San Francisco on December 29,
probably via Pan - American Air
lines. The entire party will number
40 persons, and the team will be
quartered at the Koyal Hawaiian
Hotel during the island visit.
They will also fly home, accord
ing to present plans, leaving Hono
lulu the night of January 4.
