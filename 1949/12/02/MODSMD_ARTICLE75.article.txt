# Braves Whip Modesto JC
## 
### PETK GROTHE 
Stanford's basketballing Braves
got off to an auspicious start last
night as their superior depth and
speed enabled them to pound out a
58 to ?,2 win over Modesto Junior
College.
The first half was nearly even as

the Braves left the court with a
21 to 17 advantage. However, the
second stanza was a different story
as Paul Matson, Harry Hugasian, and
Gary Andrews sank baskets in pre
cision-like style.
Modesto sprang to a 4 to 1 lend
in the opening minutes, but their
glory was short-lived as Matson,
Andrews, arid Paul Watson went to
work. After five minutes of play,
the jayvees had a lead that they
were never to relinquish.
The visitors remained in conten
tion for the first half, but they were
never able to come closer than three
points to the pace set by the Braves.
The Braves came back in the sec
ond half a revitalized team. Seven
minutes into the second stanza, Mat
son and Hugasian combined for sev
en straight points and catapulted
Stanford into a 33-22 lead. After
that it was all Stanford as the fast
break attack rolled into high gear.
Matson, the 6-ft. 3-in. center, was
hi'gh point man as he accounted for
15 digits, five of them via the free
throw route. Forward Andrews was
next in line for the Braves as he
iluilked up 11 points. Hugasian lived
up to advance notices as he ac
counted for six points in his 10-min
ute stint.
The Braves will lock horns with
Santa Rosa JC tomorrow night and
then will take on Marin JC the fol
lowing Tuesday.
