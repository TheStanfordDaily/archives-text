By NORM HITTER
Stanford's frosh cagers overcame a
| fust and scrappy Antioch High quin
tet 43 to 30 yesterday afternoon in
the initial outing of their 18-game
campaign.
The Papooses play the hosts' role
in the Pavilion again tomorrow
night when they meet Fremont High
of Oakland, preliminary to the Stan
ford-San Jose State tilt. Tip-off is
6:15 p.m.
Paced by the ball - hawking of
George Zaninovich and excellent re
bounding by Dave Seward, Bob
Burnett's neophytes held the Contra
Costa preps in check throughout the
second half.
The visitors had pressed to within
a field goal of the frosh at inter
mission, 15 to 17.
The frosh played without the
services of their ace pivot-man, Bill
Stevenson, who v/as occupied with
an afternoon lab.
Burnett made an experimental
step by playing the game according
to the proposed rule change which
would prohibit stopping of the clock
by substitution during the final two
minutes of play.
Advocates of this suggested
amendment to the NCAA statutes
feel that it would give the trailing
team a better chance of getting back
into the ball game.
Under such a rule, substitutions
in the final two minutes could take
place only after the referee had
stopped the clock; time may not be
called by the coach.
In addition, no player shall be
ejected via the five-foul route, nor
shall an offended team be given the
option of declining the penalty in
order to gain possession of the ball.
Alter 15 personal fouls have been
called against a team, each ensuing
foul will award the offended player
two free throw attempts.
The Papooses and the Braves will
play their subseouent games under
these specifications when rival
teams concur.
