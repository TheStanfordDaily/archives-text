Wheel! Things have broken wide open on the coaching front.
Well, Stanlord is an institution lor higher learning. I'm learning. I'm
learning, rather quickly, that nothing students say means much at Stanford.
Oh, there will hi- many to snort, "What the heck dees lie mean, 'st...dents,'
that's just his own opinion."
I don't think so. It's a l'unny thing, but since Tuesday a week ago I've
bad hundreds, yes hundreds, ol students tell me that I was c ! oinr; the right
thing. Yet the letters to the editor have come from those who disagree.
That's natural, but it doesn't express the will of the majority of students
who have been around long enough to know what is going on.
I'm learning. I now know an excellent defense to toss at those who com
plain against any of my views. I shall from this day forth cry, "Personal
grudge. That's all, personal grudge."
This "personal grudge" thing has really gone the rounds. St;;n r ord has
a very good 'press,'" evtn among the IP.arst sports pages. They are quick
tc take up the false, believe me it is very false, cry of grudge fight to cover up.
It is being brought back to me that some er; (while supporters are very
quick to drop out when the pressure is put on. That's also to be tx.jeeU'd.
But it makes one wonder.
I have only tried to express n.y opinion as to one of the ma or causes of
Stanford's po;.>r record in the past five football seasons—22 win::, 25 iosses,
and 2 ties. All too many times have I left u Stanford game disgusted with
poor blocking and tackling.
My purpose has been t"o improve Stanford football. That and on ! y that.
My criticism of Phil Bengtson has been as a college line coach, not ol the
man. 1 don't think he can properly handle soph material. I don't think his
cold manner and lack of spirited coaching is good lor a college team.
If my comments improve his future techniques in any way I'll con ider
them worthwhile. We will know next year, yes next year, for lie will still
t c around. This year's lrosli line has been rated the best in the last three
years by no less an authority than freshman coach Chuck Taylor.
As to the letter from Erwin Farkas, I'll not stoop to reply to such a collec
tion of vile mistruths.
