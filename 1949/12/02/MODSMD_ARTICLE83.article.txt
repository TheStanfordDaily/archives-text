# Uniforms Replaced Farm Levis As Campus Pitched Into War
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
When the bombing of Pearl
Harbor pushed America into
war, Stanford also quickly con
verted "for the duration." The
Farm settled down to blackouts,
Red Cross work, and classes of
khaki-clad army trainees.
On Monday morning, a sober
President Raymond Lyman Wilbur
urged the student body to remain
in school as long as possible. He
reasoned, "An engineering student
designing a plane which wiil travel
twenty miles per hour faster is
worth 10.000 men in uniform."
A few days after the Pearl Harbor
attack, blackout instructions were
issued, saving drives were planned,
certain departments were expanded
Uj include government war projects,
and special utility courses were
added.
The first blackout was held that
fa'l quarter of 1941. Although En -
cina lagged behind the rest of the
campus in responding to the signal,
university officials praised the stu
dents for their fine cooperation.
Blackout Problems
Blackouts brought new problems
to the campus. Provisions had to
be made so that students could con
tinue their studies unhampered by
the intermittent spells of darkness.
Dean of Women, Mary Yost, made a
request that men should not be al
lowed in women's residences during
blackouts.
"It's not that the women are in
hospitable or unsocial," she said,
"but that they are too hospitable and
sociable."
Stanford's exterior began to change.
Sand bags and shovels were common
sights on campus. Army planes used
the polo field for air communications
tests. Beginning of the quarter leg
lines couldn't, compare with queues
of men registering for the draft, and
all students over eighteen signed up
for ration books. The Soph Carnival
theme was "Fight the Japs." Carless

Wednesdays found students walking
to classes instead of riding.
Sailors in Branncr
By fall quarter 194?., Stanford was
not quite as optimistic about the
war as before, and together with the
rest ol the nation, settled down for
a long struggle. That year brought
the last Big Game for the duration,
the Navy in Branner (then a men's
hall), the first woman student bocy
president, soldiers in Sequoia, Bran
ner, Toyon, and Encina.
Uniforms predominated every
where. Marching columns were a
familiar sight on Quad. A more
widespread physical education pro
gram was begun when results of a
physical fitness .survey showed that
one-third of the Stanford roughs
were unfit for service.
Pleas came for students to help
in crnneries, harvesting, and fruit
picking. Even Encina was short
handed in the kitchen and asked
men to work in shifts on K.P. Stu
dents signed pledges for eight hours
of war work each month.
Swing Shift Classes
The third year of war, 1943,
brought swing shift classes, with
drawal of all Stanford teams from
sports, lunch skipping for blood
donations, conversion of the Nitery

into a canteen, WAC occupation of
the ex-presidential mansion.
The class of '44 was the first class
entirely affected by the war. Many
students speeded up their curricu
lum in order to be able to graduate
early. Elections were all mixed up.
No one was quite sure who was
qualified to run in class elections.
Instructions were, "Vote for the
candidate you would run against if
you were running." Senior class of
ficers were all girls.
A Big Game rally was held as
usual to fire up the Stanford spirit,
although the Big Game wasn't held.
licat the Bears
Authentic Big Game rivalry was
continued, however, when Cal chal
lenged the Farm to a war bond
drive. They offered the Axe as
prize, but after serious considera
tion, Excom vetoed the idea. A Cal
banner was substituted for the
prize. Proportional ratios were es
tablished in order to smooth out the
different sizes of the student bodies.
"Bonds to Beat the Bears" became
the campus slogan. Stanford won
the contest and the banner prize.
When D-Day was celebrated, the
ratio was 1.05 women to 1 men.
But when the war ended, it returned
to normal.
