# Naval Reserve Officers Advised To Confirm Permanent Reserve Status
## 
### 
Promotions for 56,541 inactive Na
val Reserve officers are under ad
visement by selection boards in
Washington, but local authorities to
day warned Bay Area officers that
they must confirm permanent Re
serve status before they will be con
sidered for new rank.
There are approximately 20,000
inactive Naval Reserve officers liv- j
ing in this area. Only 50 per cent of i
them have established permanent

post-war Naval Reserve rank.
Since all war - time promotions
were temporary, officers must ac
knowldege by oath their highest
rank obtained in order to be con
sidered eligible for the new pro
motions.
In San Francisco, permanent sta
tus may be confirmed in the Naval
J Reserve recruiting office in the Fed
j cral "Office Building. The telephone
! number is MArket 1-3828, Ext. 3fil.
