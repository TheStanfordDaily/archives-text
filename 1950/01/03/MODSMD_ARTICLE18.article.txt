# Ohio Staters Edge Out Golden Bears With Field Coal in 17-14 Rose Bowl
## 
### 
PASADENA, Jan. 2 (/P) Ohio
I State scored a history-making field
j goal in the final two minutes of a
bitterly fought battle in the Rose
Bowl today to defeat, a gallant Cali-
I fornia team, 17 to 14, and once again
! the banners of the Big Ten tri
umphed over the Coast Conference.
Right end Jim Hague, whose
place kick against. Michigan brought
Ohio State to this 3fit.h annual clas
sic, brought the Buckeyes safely
through it.
There was one minute and 55 sec
onds remaining in the struggle, the
score was tied at 14-14, and a rec
ord crowd of 100,052 onlookers sat
| in breahtlcss silence as Ohio State
got ready for its last chance to win
the game.
Center Jack Lininger had the hall
I on California's 10-yard stripe, Dick
1 Widdoes took it on the pass and put
jit down on the 17Me-yard mark.
First Field Goal to Win Game
Hague, a senior from Rocky
River, 0., stepped calmly into it.
The ball sailed through, it was good,
j and crashing down came the dreams
of the Golden Bears for victory in
[ this fourth thrust by the Coast
against the powerful elevens of the
| Big Ten.
It was the first time in this daddy
i of all Bowl games that it had been
j decided by a field goal.
It was the grand climax, prosaic
in its mechanical execution, electri
| fying in its effect, that brought a
j virtula end to a game that was stub-
I bornly fought from beginning to
I end.
Lady Luck played no favorites

today. She had little truck with
either team.
Bucks Cash In
California scored first, in the sec
ond quarter, and held a 7-0 lead at
the half. The Buckeyes, robbed or
robbing themselves in no loss than
four scoring threats in the first, half,
cashed in on two breaks and went
ahead momentarily, 14-7, in the
third quarter.
California exploded immediately,
tied the count, and the two elevens,
the pride of the Coast, the co-cham
pions from the Mid-West, rocked on
into hte fourth and final quarter.
This dramatic outcome, with time
running out, was an even sadder
blow to the Golden Bears, because
just a year ago Northwestern
scored a winning touchdown in the
final four minutes of a contest just
as close as this one.
Ohio Line Wins It
Hague was the winning hero. He
shared honors with his mates of the
baekfield, fullback Fred (Curly)
Morrison ,t.hc big ground gainer of
the day, who scored the first Buck
eye touchdown, with Jerry Krall, a
halfback, who scored the other. And
all shared laurels with a charging
Buckeye line that kept the Golden
Bears in trouble all this cloudy af
ternoon, and who actually set the
scene foe the winning field goal.
The Bears held for three downs,
and then came the fourth down and
the field goal.
It. was that, same line that set the
scene for Ohio State's second touch
down.
Blocked I'imt
Celeri was back deep in Califor
nia territory and tried to punt. Big

Bill Trautwein hurled his 237-
pound frame at Celeri, blocked the
punt, and Jack Lininger fell on the
ball on liie California six.
It took four plays before Morri
son rammed across from two feet.
Waldorf sent in Charlie (Boots) Erb
out.
Late in the contest. Coach Lynn
at the quarterback spot. Erb got the
Bears on a long drive but one of his
long passes was intercepted and
that ended the threat.
It would have been quite a story
had young Erb emerged the hero.
His father, Charlie Erb, was the
quarterback on the "wonder team'
at California which shut out Ohio
State, 28-0, way back in 1921.
For the current young Bucks, this
victory was wonderful revenge for
that team of long ago.
The statistics were all on Ohio
Stale's side. They made 1!) first
downs to 12. They made 13 of those
first downs and still couldn't score
in the first half.
They outrushed Cal, 221 to 133
yards, but the Bears outgained them
in tlie air, 106 to 34.
