# McColl Stars as Triple Threat; Heaves 68-Yard Pass in 74-20 Win
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford waltzed around with the hula-hula Hawaiians for three
quarters yesterday afternoon in the Pineapple Bowl, and then
went completely berserk with a 42-point fourth quarter to win in
a romp, 74-20.
As was expected by the 18,000 wind-scattered fans, Stanford's
swift and speedy Indians had an easy time of it. However, the home fans
had their moments when Hawaii surprisingly closed the gap to 26-20 early
in the third quarter.
But at that point, the Cards put on the gas with a weird assortment ol
trick-plays, gag-plays, intercepted passes, recovered fumbles, and straight
forward running.
Halfback Dave Field, used for two seasons strictly as a defensive specialist,
and who had not scored a touchdown for Stanford in three years of varsity
play, took a last-second pass from Emery Mitchell to climax the scoring with
the final touchdown.
Rupe Andrews, Jack Barnes, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and Holy Boruck hit
paydirt for the first times this season during the Tribe's 11-touchdown and
8-conversion spree.
Allin all, it was a wild afternoon of football, one in which the scoring list
looked more like a basketball box, with Fullback Bill DeYoung nablfcing
highpoint honors with 13. He was followed closely by Gary Kfcrkorian with
10.
Stanford hardly needed their three Shrine players—Ken Rose, Emery
Mitchell, and Jim Castagnoli—who flew in specially just in time to play.
Castagnoli, banged up in the East-West battle, wasn't allowed to suit up,
but he was on hand to collect his smootch and lei.
Sophomore end Bill McColl, wowing the spectators with a versatile display
of running, passing, and kicking, was perhaps the outstanding performer of
the day. McColl ran, he passed, he kicked a point after touchdown, and he
kicked off. He also attempted a 55-yard field goal that was almost good.
Making like Notre Dame's Leon Hart, McColl started packing the ball up
the middle early in the contest. McColl surpassed even the tremendous All-
American Hart when he unleashed his 68-yard heave that left the Honolulu
patrons gasping.
He passed to Stanford's eighth touchdown when he took a handoff from
the quarterback, faded back to his own 20, and then fired a tremendous
heave which landed in Holy Boruck's hands somewhere in the vicinity of
the 10-yard line. Boruck took the ball on the dead run and trotted into ihe
end zone.
For the records—pass the Bromo-Seltzer, please—the scoring went like
this:
I—Emery Mitchell punchcd over the first Stanford touchdown of 1950 from
five yards out to climax a drive that had gone 47 yards in 5 plays. Kerkorian
converted.
2—Rupert Andrews, who set up the second TD with a beautiful 25-yard
scamper, finally scored his first touchdown of the season with a burst over
tackle from the five. Kerkorian missed. «
3 —Dick Horn quarter-sneaked over from the one. Kerkorian connected.
4—Ken Rose grabbed a Horn shot from 34 yards out and whipped over
the goal for 26. Horn missed the try.
s—Gary5—Gary Kerkorian sneaked over from the one to climax a drive that went
77 yards in 13 plays. He made the try again.
6—Bill DeYoung plunged over from the three. The conversion was missed,
score now reading 39-20.
7—Bill DeYoung bounccd right back with another TD plunge from the
same distance away. Horn booted the 46th point.
B—Hobbling Holy Boruck got under Bill McColl's whopping 68-yard toss
to score his first TD of the season.
9—Ken Peck, playing his first offensive ball in Stanford togs, scored on a
pitch-out from the five, after Dan Mervin had set up the score with an inter
cepted pass on the 10.
10—Center Jack Barnes, getting into the act which he started against
Idaho, but couldn't quite hit paydirt, finally got his touchdown off an inter
ception as he rambled to 66. Horn connected for 67.
11—And finally, Dave Field, the 156-pound defensive giant from Pauls
Valley, Oklahoma, took a last-play pass from the old pro, Emery Mitchell,
and scored his first touchdown of his collegiate career. Mitchell handed
the ball to DeYoung for the extra point, and DeYoung smashed over from
the two.
And that was the season. Happy New Year!

Stanford waltzed around with the hula-hula Hawaiians for three
quarters yesterday afternoon in the Pineapple Bowl, and then
went completely berserk with a 42-point fourth quarter to win in
a romp, 74-20.
As was expected by the 18,000 wind-scattered fans, Stanford's
swift and speedy Indians had an easy time of it. However, the home fans
had their moments when Hawaii surprisingly closed the gap to 26-20 early
in the third quarter.
But at that point, the Cards put on the gas with a weird assortment ol
trick-plays, gag-plays, intercepted passes, recovered fumbles, and straight
forward running.
Halfback Dave Field, used for two seasons strictly as a defensive specialist,
and who had not scored a touchdown for Stanford in three years of varsity
play, took a last-second pass from Emery Mitchell to climax the scoring with
the final touchdown.
Rupe Andrews, Jack Barnes, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and Holy Boruck hit
paydirt for the first times this season during the Tribe's 11-touchdown and
8-conversion spree.
Allin all, it was a wild afternoon of football, one in which the scoring list
looked more like a basketball box, with Fullback Bill DeYoung nablfcing
highpoint honors with 13. He was followed closely by Gary Kfcrkorian with
10.
Stanford hardly needed their three Shrine players—Ken Rose, Emery
Mitchell, and Jim Castagnoli—who flew in specially just in time to play.
Castagnoli, banged up in the East-West battle, wasn't allowed to suit up,
but he was on hand to collect his smootch and lei.
Sophomore end Bill McColl, wowing the spectators with a versatile display
of running, passing, and kicking, was perhaps the outstanding performer of
the day. McColl ran, he passed, he kicked a point after touchdown, and he
kicked off. He also attempted a 55-yard field goal that was almost good.
Making like Notre Dame's Leon Hart, McColl started packing the ball up
the middle early in the contest. McColl surpassed even the tremendous All-
American Hart when he unleashed his 68-yard heave that left the Honolulu
patrons gasping.
He passed to Stanford's eighth touchdown when he took a handoff from
the quarterback, faded back to his own 20, and then fired a tremendous
heave which landed in Holy Boruck's hands somewhere in the vicinity of
the 10-yard line. Boruck took the ball on the dead run and trotted into ihe
end zone.
For the records—pass the Bromo-Seltzer, please—the scoring went like
this:
I—Emery Mitchell punchcd over the first Stanford touchdown of 1950 from
five yards out to climax a drive that had gone 47 yards in 5 plays. Kerkorian
converted.
2—Rupert Andrews, who set up the second TD with a beautiful 25-yard
scamper, finally scored his first touchdown of the season with a burst over
tackle from the five. Kerkorian missed. «
3 —Dick Horn quarter-sneaked over from the one. Kerkorian connected.
4—Ken Rose grabbed a Horn shot from 34 yards out and whipped over
the goal for 26. Horn missed the try.
s—Gary5—Gary Kerkorian sneaked over from the one to climax a drive that went
77 yards in 13 plays. He made the try again.
6—Bill DeYoung plunged over from the three. The conversion was missed,
score now reading 39-20.
7—Bill DeYoung bounccd right back with another TD plunge from the
same distance away. Horn booted the 46th point.
B—Hobbling Holy Boruck got under Bill McColl's whopping 68-yard toss
to score his first TD of the season.
9—Ken Peck, playing his first offensive ball in Stanford togs, scored on a
pitch-out from the five, after Dan Mervin had set up the score with an inter
cepted pass on the 10.
10—Center Jack Barnes, getting into the act which he started against
Idaho, but couldn't quite hit paydirt, finally got his touchdown off an inter
ception as he rambled to 66. Horn connected for 67.
11—And finally, Dave Field, the 156-pound defensive giant from Pauls
Valley, Oklahoma, took a last-play pass from the old pro, Emery Mitchell,
and scored his first touchdown of his collegiate career. Mitchell handed
the ball to DeYoung for the extra point, and DeYoung smashed over from
the two.
And that was the season. Happy New Year!

Stanford waltzed around with the hula-hula Hawaiians for three
quarters yesterday afternoon in the Pineapple Bowl, and then
went completely berserk with a 42-point fourth quarter to win in
a romp, 74-20.
As was expected by the 18,000 wind-scattered fans, Stanford's
swift and speedy Indians had an easy time of it. However, the home fans
had their moments when Hawaii surprisingly closed the gap to 26-20 early
in the third quarter.
But at that point, the Cards put on the gas with a weird assortment ol
trick-plays, gag-plays, intercepted passes, recovered fumbles, and straight
forward running.
Halfback Dave Field, used for two seasons strictly as a defensive specialist,
and who had not scored a touchdown for Stanford in three years of varsity
play, took a last-second pass from Emery Mitchell to climax the scoring with
the final touchdown.
Rupe Andrews, Jack Barnes, Dave Field, Ken Peck, and Holy Boruck hit
paydirt for the first times this season during the Tribe's 11-touchdown and
8-conversion spree.
Allin all, it was a wild afternoon of football, one in which the scoring list
looked more like a basketball box, with Fullback Bill DeYoung nablfcing
highpoint honors with 13. He was followed closely by Gary Kfcrkorian with
10.
Stanford hardly needed their three Shrine players—Ken Rose, Emery
Mitchell, and Jim Castagnoli—who flew in specially just in time to play.
Castagnoli, banged up in the East-West battle, wasn't allowed to suit up,
but he was on hand to collect his smootch and lei.
Sophomore end Bill McColl, wowing the spectators with a versatile display
of running, passing, and kicking, was perhaps the outstanding performer of
the day. McColl ran, he passed, he kicked a point after touchdown, and he
kicked off. He also attempted a 55-yard field goal that was almost good.
Making like Notre Dame's Leon Hart, McColl started packing the ball up
the middle early in the contest. McColl surpassed even the tremendous All-
American Hart when he unleashed his 68-yard heave that left the Honolulu
patrons gasping.
He passed to Stanford's eighth touchdown when he took a handoff from
the quarterback, faded back to his own 20, and then fired a tremendous
heave which landed in Holy Boruck's hands somewhere in the vicinity of
the 10-yard line. Boruck took the ball on the dead run and trotted into ihe
end zone.
For the records—pass the Bromo-Seltzer, please—the scoring went like
this:
I—Emery Mitchell punchcd over the first Stanford touchdown of 1950 from
five yards out to climax a drive that had gone 47 yards in 5 plays. Kerkorian
converted.
2—Rupert Andrews, who set up the second TD with a beautiful 25-yard
scamper, finally scored his first touchdown of the season with a burst over
tackle from the five. Kerkorian missed. «
3 —Dick Horn quarter-sneaked over from the one. Kerkorian connected.
4—Ken Rose grabbed a Horn shot from 34 yards out and whipped over
the goal for 26. Horn missed the try.
s—Gary5—Gary Kerkorian sneaked over from the one to climax a drive that went
77 yards in 13 plays. He made the try again.
6—Bill DeYoung plunged over from the three. The conversion was missed,
score now reading 39-20.
7—Bill DeYoung bounccd right back with another TD plunge from the
same distance away. Horn booted the 46th point.
B—Hobbling Holy Boruck got under Bill McColl's whopping 68-yard toss
to score his first TD of the season.
