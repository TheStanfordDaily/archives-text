### 
LONDON. Jan. 2 (A')â€” Egyptians
elect a new Chamber of Deputies to- (
morrow. The reported romance of
King Farouk with a brown-haired
beauty of 1(5 may be one of the major i
imponderables in the voting.
The story, as dazzling as any that |
ever came from the pages of the !
Arabian Nights, is that the ponderous '
monarch first saw Narriman Sadek
while she was shopping for an en- |
uagement ring with her young fiance,
Zaki Hachian, 27-year-old United j
Nations diplomat. The king immcd
iatcly lost his heart, the stories .said. ,
and promised her the throne that
once was Cleopatra's despite the j
girl's declaration that she still loved
Hachian.
The implication that the king had
come between two young lovers j
among his subjects was denied by the
Egyptian Embassy in Washington,
but the story has not been denied
that he wants to marry the girl and
has fixed the wedding date.
