# The
						Big Rush Is On
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Stanford's 24 fraternities
will open their doors to a host of prospective
brothers, and the time-honored tradition of
rushing will begin again.
For two hectic, bewildering weeks rushing
will be intensive. Many of you, mostly frosh
and transfers, are going to make important de
cisions; whether or not to join a fraternity and,
if so, which one.
Your decision is certaiji to have a profound
effect on your college life and a noticeable in
fluence on your post-campus life. It must be a
decision based upon careful consideration of
every relevant factor, and you alone are quali
fied to judge. It's your decision.
The question of whether or not to join a fra
ternity can only be answered by taking a good,
long look at yourself. Some are just not tem
permentally suited to fraternity life. In a fra
ternity, more than any other campus living
group, you've got to be able to give and take,
accept your responsibilities along with your
privileges.
You don't have to be a rah-rah, dyed-in-the
wool extrovert, but you do need an active de
sire to get along with people. The fraternity
offers its members many privileges, and in re
turn rightfully exacts certain obligations. Co
operation, unselfishness, and responsibility are
the keystones of fraternity life.
Some of you will fully measure up to these
qualifications and yet have no desire to join a
fraternity. At Stanford, as you doubtless have
discovered by now, fraternity membership not
generally looked upon as a mark of the elite.
Unlike many other universities there is no stig
ma, social or otherwise, attached to the non
fraternity man. Many of our outstanding cam
pus leaders have not belonged to fraternities.
If you do want to join a fraternity, your prob
-Icm will be to choose the group which you "fit
in with" best. Remember that you will be liv
ing with that group during the rest of your

stay at Stanford .... look for the group, both
actives and pledges, with interests and atti
tudes similar to your own. The fraternity will
be looking you over with the same criteria in
mind.
Your choice of a fraternity should take into
consideration the physical plant of the house,
room and board bills, quality of the food
served, and the academic record. But above
all, choose not where you want to live, but who
you want to live with.
The rushing schedule set up by Interfrater
nity Council provides the opportunity for each
of you to visit every fraternity at least once
during the four evening open house periods.
Take a good look at every house and don't
be unduly prejudiced by the fact that a member
of your family or a friend belonged to a certain
fraternity.
Don't fall all over yourself trying to make an
impression on the brothers; just act natural.
Remember that fraternities are just as anxious
to pledge likely prospects as you may be to
be pledged.
The decisions to be made are important and
often difficult. An error in judgment by either
you or a fraternity can result in a very unhappy
situation.
Critics of the present rushing system argue
that it is too confused and hectic to make a wise
decision possible. The very existence of fra
ternities proves otherwise.
If you're not sure you want to join a frater
nity, give careful consideration to the eating
clubs. These clubs, while not so formally or :
ganized as fraternities and providing fewer
conveniences, boast a bond of friendship and
mutual activities and interests which many pre
fer to fraternity life.
Whatever the outcome, you will find rushing
a pleasant time .... worthwhile for the many
friends you will make and the broader per
spective of Stanford life which you will gain.
