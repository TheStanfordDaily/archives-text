### JOHN HALL 
Old 1949 is all washed up.
So we start all over again. Wo begin a new year,
and better than that—a half century.
As is in the best of tradition at this time of the sea-

son, most persons connected with
journalist and the recording of
public events like to mull over the
bright spots of the past year and
pick out the highlights.
You get the 10 best movies, the
10 best-dressed women, the 10
best books, the 10 best actors, the
10 best football games, and so on
down the line until all possibilities
are exhausted.
But as yet, nobody has pre
uentllrl o licit 10 hiiiouuf

sen tea a list ot tne iu biggest ? # #
schmoes. The reason is obvious. There are so many
.schmoes walking around these days that it is very
difficult to select just a few.
However, after extensive research and balloting, the
following list has been put together. My apologies if
the entries included do not coincide with your own
choices. If you feel slighted you may write a letter
in care of the editor with your personal selection, but
before you do, please check the top of this column for
correct spelling.
Without further ado. here for you are the 10 biggest
schmoe.s of 1!>49:
I—Westbrook Pegler
2—Shirley Temple
—Carl Kraushaar
4—Yasmin Khan
s—Shirley May France
(► —Mickey Cohen
7—laraine Day
B—Roberto Rossellini
9——Hob Celeri
10—Jacque Mercer
Old Mean-words Westbrook Pegler won hands down
the honor of being top schmoe of the year. For over a
decade Pegler's vile and petty sniping at the Roose
velts has put him in fine position for the honor. But
his latest attack, that of proving to his readers that
Franklin carried on a sideline romance with a former
secretary of Eleanor's, clinched things.

Shirley Temple, too, has been in the schmoe running
for several years. Her repeated putrid performances
in picture after picture sharpened her for the schmoe
winning statements she made about husband John
Agar in search of a divorce.
Number three honors were grabbed in a fast finish
by Cry-Baby Karl Kraushaar, a basketball represen
tative of the UCLA Bruins. Kraushaar's penny-ante
moaning and whining lust February in the Stanford
Pavilion had almost been forgotten until he forged
back onto the scene with more of the same against
USF in the Cow Palace last month.
Yasmin Khan's 1949 appearance explained a lot of
things, and although the Aly passed out cigars, all 100
percent Americans were passing out when they heard
how they tagged Rita's second kid—Yasmin.
Schoolgirl Shirley May France, who flunked the
English Channel test after weeks and weeks of stalling
around in France, didn't come close to rating all the
publicity which was heaped on her bulky shoulders.
Really the nicest schmoe on the list is badman
Mickey Cohen. He just stole a few bucks, beat up ;i
few mugs, and cussed out u few LA cops.
Undoubtedly the worst "big-time" movie of the year
was "Without Honor" (the producer really was) .stal -
ling Laraine Day. Leo's Laraine should stick with the
Giants. Her performance in this flick was the most
uninspiring, sickening mess ever turned out by any
body associated with baseball.
Roberto Rossellini, who really might be a great guy,
gets a schmoe-nod because he took so much credit con
cerning the direction of Paisan, a really poor picture.
However, his slick work with Ingrid almost kept him
off the list.
Bob Celeri had to go somewhere on this list. He's
still a celery-head.
I*ist but not least, as the saying goes, is Arizona's
18-year-old Miss America Jacque Mercer. She tossed
in the towel when she married a home-town romeo.
Jacque wouldn't have had a chance against blonde
Frances Cloyd of San Diego in the Mrs. America race.
So, that's it. The Big Ten, and now we're all set to
proceed with the future. No fanfare, please.
Like they used to say in the colony HAPPY NUDF,
YEAR.
