WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (/P)â€”Use
of American armed forces, if neces
sary to keep Formosa out of Chi
nese Communists' hands was advo
cated today by former President
Herbert Hoover and Senator Tall
(K., Ohio).
They contended such a policy is
needed to safeguard this country's
own security.
Hoover said the United States not
only should use its naval power to
protect ihe big island stronghold
but also lesser islands which Chiang
Kai-shek's forces ace seeking to de
fend along the South China coast.
He declared such a step would
help erect a "wall against Commu
nism in the Pacific" and offer a
"continuing hope of sometime turn
ing China in the paths of freedom
again."
In the wake of that appeal Sena
tor Taft told a news conference that
the administration should consider

immediately establishing air and
naval bases on Formosa.
He declared that such a move
should be taken through the United
Nations, but that if the UN did
not approve "then we should act on
our own."
"If we have the Nationalists' ap
proval," he said, "then there would
be no difficulty about the legality
of the move."
President Truman is reported to
have decided against use of U.S.
armed force to safeguard Formosa,
but this matter is exected to come
up for further review after the joint
chiefs of staff confer with Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur in Japan next
month.
