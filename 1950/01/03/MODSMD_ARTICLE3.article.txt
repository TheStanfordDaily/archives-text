# U.S. China Policy Hit

### 
LONDON â€” Three of Britain's
leading papers strongly criticized
Washington's China policy today
and said they feared it would strain
the Anglo-American partnership.
Their declarations were made at
the start of the week in which many
observers expect Britain formally to
announce recognition of Communist
China. The comment was in con
nection with reports from Washing
ton that, far from recognizing the
Peiping regime of Communist Mao
Tze-tung, the United States may
give some further moral or other
aid to Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek in defending the island of For
mosa.
