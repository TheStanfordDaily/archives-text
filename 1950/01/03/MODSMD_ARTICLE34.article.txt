# Foreign Directory Published
## 
### 
All offices of the American Ex
press Company now have available
for reference to tlic public a com
prehensive directory of foreign uni
versities.
The directory, compiled last year
by Amrici'n Express researchers,
and revised and enlarged this year,
was undertaken because of the
great demand for a single source of
information on foreign universities
due to the unprecedented number
of American students now studying
abroad.
In addition to the directory, cop
ies of "To Study Abroad" are avail
able. This is a pamphlet summariz
ing the educational opportunities
furnished to American students in
foreign lands, and containing addi
tional information on tuition, living
costs, and admission requirements.
