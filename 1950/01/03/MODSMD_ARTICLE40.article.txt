# Run for Hoop Crown to Begin Friday; Card Cagers Win 2, Lose 3 Over Holidays

### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's basketballing Indians,
witli their sights leveled on next
Friday night's Southern Division
opener against USC in Los Angeles,
are looking back today at the rec
ords of their recent Yuletide cage
efforts.
After taking a brief look at the
Northwest's idea ol basketball,
namely Washington and Oregon,

and then coming home to the Cow
Palace for intersectional tiffs with
Minnesota and Texas A&M, the
Cards considered themselves lucky
to grab off two out of five and bring
their season total to five wins in
nine starts.
Sparked by the fast - improved
sophomores, Jim Walsh and Jim
Iiamstead, and leaning heavily on
the high - scoring flinging arm of
George Yard ley, Stanford tipped

Oregon 70-67 and outbid the Texas
boys, 55-49.
But, that was as far as the suc
cess story ran. In a return bout,
Oregon retaliated with a 58-51 win,
a night later in Seattle, Washington
roughed it up for a 62-56 verdict,
and last Friday Minnesota edged
the Cards in a 67-65 overtime affair
at the Cow Palace.
The Washington and Minnesota
games could have gone either way.
Stanford kept right with the Hus
kies until the final minutes, and the
Cards led Minnesota by 16 points at
one time, only to see their lead col
lapse when Gopher Whitey Skoog
started to click with his famous
shooting eye.
So, the season total reads with
wins over College of Pacific, San
Jose State, Olympic Club, Oregon,
and Texas A&M. Down in small
print are the losses to the Stewart
Chevrolets, Oregon, Washington,
and Minnesota.
George Yardley, the big blond
from Balboa, was the loudest noise
in the holiday scoring parade.
Yardley whipped in 24 points
against Oregon for his top perform
ance of the year. He also tossed up
19 against Washington and 16
against Minnesota to bring his total
to 137 for a 15.2 average.
Probably even more pleasing to

Card followers has been the rapid
progress of soph sparklers Jim
Walsh and Jim Ramstead. Walsh
has been an all - around offensive
specialist, ball-hawking on the open
floor, roughing it up on the back
boards, and shooting well for a total
of 99 points for the number two
spot in team scoring.
Center Ramstead, who was rated
on even terms with veteran Ralph
Carver when Farm hands departed
for turkey and cranberries, defi
nitely secured himself a starting
role with solid work against Stew
art Chevrolet (1(5), Oregon (14), and
Minnesota (14).
Stanford has been plagued by an
assortment of slight ailments which
have been helped along by various
knee guards, back braces, and a few
miles of adhesive tape.
Jim Walsh has been bothered by
an infected boil on his knee, Gel
ber just shook off an earlier foot
injury, Chavalas continues to be
hampered by a tricky nerve above
his knee, and Ralph Carver was
bedded down over the weekend
with the flu.
Sunday, Everett Dean had his
hoys out for a scrimmage against
San Jose State. No score was kept,
but the Dcanmen got in some
needed work for the fast-approach
ing USC and UCLA contests next
weekend.
