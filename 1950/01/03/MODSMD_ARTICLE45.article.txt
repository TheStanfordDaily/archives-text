### 
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 3 (/P)â€”Some
of the nation's 480,000 United Mine
Workers began work today on
schedule.
By the end of the day, industry
and UMW spokesmen expect most
diggers will be back on the short
work week decreed by their chief,
John L. Lewis.
There have been recurrent re
ports that a big - scale walkout
would materialize today. So far,
there's ittle to back them up.
Only in Illinois is there evidence
of an imminent work stoppage.
Fred S. Wilkey, secretary of the the
Illinois Coal Operators' Association,
says 50 per cent of mine manage
ments have been notied by local
union officials that the men would
not work.
But Hugh White, president of
UMW's District 12 at Springeld, 111.,
indicated he expects the miners to
resume production.
The same situation holds true in
the big coal - producing states of
West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
