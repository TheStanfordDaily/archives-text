HONG KONG — Ihe American
freighter Flying Arrow's scheduled
sailing for mine- threatened Red
Shanghai was postponed tonight to
Jan. 5, with the attitude of the un
easy crew still open to debate.
A spokesman for the Isbrandtscn
Line, ship owners, said none of the
crew had signed off and the ma
jority had given assurances they
would make the voyage.
A spokesman for the U.S. consu
late said, however, the State De
partment had sent instructions to
authorize signing off any who
wished—provided they could satisfy
the consulate and Hong Kong au
thorities that they had passage
home.
