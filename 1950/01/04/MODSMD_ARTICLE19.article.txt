# Farm Gets Face Lifted
## 
### 
While most Stanford students va
cated the campus during Christmas
vacation, Corporation Yard employ
ees remained to make many im
provements on the Farm.
Under the direction of a new head
gardener, Dick Schroder, much of
the rubbish along Palm Drive and
in the Arboretum was cleared away.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said this job
had not been done for several years.
As part of an extensive tree
planting program, many new oak
trees were planted along Escondido
Road and Galvez Street near Croth
ers and Stern Halls. Plans call for
a new shipment of Chinese elms
from Southern California.
The first touches on a face-lifting
job near the Micro-wave Labora
tory consist of landscaping and pav
ing.
The parking lot next to the
Chemistry Building was graded and
several loads of crushed rock were
rolled down.
Blacker said his department is
making a survey to examine the in
terior condition of all campus
buildings and classrooms. He sug
gested that a plan might be devised
to divide the total cost for annual
building improvements over five
years.
