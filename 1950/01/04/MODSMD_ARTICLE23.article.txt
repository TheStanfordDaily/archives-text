# Open Houses Tonight Start Formal Rushing
## Row to Host Frosh Four Nights; 'Unlimited Contact' Begins Friday 
### 
for the first time this school year, freshmen and first-quarter
transfers will have a chance to view Stanford's 24 residence,
Greek-letter fraternities "from the inside."
They will be hosted by the Row men tonight, tomorrow, and
Friday nights from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m., and one evening next week,

as the four-night open house pro
gram officially inaugurates this
year's formal rushing season.
At 9:15 Friday night, open rushing
with "unlimited contact between
rushees and fraternity men." will be
gin, lasting till Wednesday night,
Jan. 18 at 7:30 p.m., when rushees
will sign formal pledge cards fol
lowing preference dinners.
Walt Varellas, Interfraternity
Council chairman, emphasized the
fact last night that, although anyone
may visit the houses on any of the
prescribed open-house nights, fresh
men entering Stanford this quarter
may not participate in further rush
ing activities this quarter. (The
above is a correction of yesterday's
rushing story.)
Only freshmen who have com
pleted one quarter's residence at
Stanford (summer quarter ex
cepted) may be rushed throughout
the 12-day period, he continued.
Men may not be pledged unless
their academic standing is above
minus 10, Varellas quoted from the
rushing rules.
Two requests concerning rushing
procedures have been issued by the
Encina sponsors in cooperation with
Miss Ellene Sumner, resident direc
tor of the hall, as follows:
1. It is requested that fraternity
men cease contact in Encina with
freshmen after 11 p.m. during rush
ing season;
2. It is requested that fraternity
men conduct business with freshmen
outside their rooms unless definitely
invited intd the room.
These requests have been formu
lated in an attempt to halt the un
necessary bothering of those fresh
men not being rushed at the time,
Varellas explained. He said he
would probably call a council meet
ing on Thursday to discuss the re
quests.
With the opening of "unlimited
contact" Friday night, fraternities
will begin entertaining prospects at
such functions as invitational
dances, stag parties, and dinners
and luncheons.
Although fraternities may pledge
any eligible man during the "open
season," such pledges are not bind
ing until Jar> 18 when formal pledge
cards are signed.
Should a man break his pledge to a
fraternity following formal pledge
night, he cannot pledge another fra
ternity for a period of six months.
If the fraternity breaks the pledge,
the man may join another house at
any time.
Varellas said that formal pledging
follows directly after preference
dinners this year because of the
trouble experienced last year during
the overnight period between the
dnners and formal pledging.

Stanford (summer quarter ex
cepted) may be rushed throughout
the 12-day period, he continued.
Men may not be pledged unless
their academic standing is above
minus 10, Varellas quoted from the
rushing rules.
Two requests concerning rushing
procedures have been issued by the
Encina sponsors in cooperation with
Miss Ellene Sumner, resident direc
tor of the hall, as follows:
1. It is requested that fraternity
men cease contact in Encina with
freshmen after 11 p.m. during rush
ing season;
2. It is requested that fraternity
men conduct business with freshmen
outside their rooms unless definitely
invited intd the room.
These requests have been formu
lated in an attempt to halt the un
necessary bothering of those fresh
men not being rushed at the time,
Varellas explained. He said he
would probably call a council meet
ing on Thursday to discuss the re
quests.
With the opening of "unlimited
contact" Friday night, fraternities
will begin entertaining prospects at
such functions as invitational
dances, stag parties, and dinners
and luncheons.
Although fraternities may pledge
any eligible man during the "open
season," such pledges are not bind
ing until Jar> 18 when formal pledge
cards are signed.
Should a man break his pledge to a
fraternity following formal pledge
night, he cannot pledge another fra
ternity for a period of six months.
If the fraternity breaks the pledge,
the man may join another house at
any time.
Varellas said that formal pledging
follows directly after preference
dinners this year because of the
trouble experienced last year during
the overnight period between the
dnners and formal pledging.
for the first time this school year, freshmen and first-quarter
transfers will have a chance to view Stanford's 24 residence,
Greek-letter fraternities "from the inside."
They will be hosted by the Row men tonight, tomorrow, and
Friday nights from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m., and one evening next week,

as the four-night open house pro
gram officially inaugurates this
year's formal rushing season.
At 9:15 Friday night, open rushing
with "unlimited contact between
rushees and fraternity men." will be
gin, lasting till Wednesday night,
Jan. 18 at 7:30 p.m., when rushees
will sign formal pledge cards fol
lowing preference dinners.
Walt Varellas, Interfraternity
Council chairman, emphasized the
fact last night that, although anyone
may visit the houses on any of the
prescribed open-house nights, fresh
men entering Stanford this quarter
may not participate in further rush
ing activities this quarter. (The
above is a correction of yesterday's
rushing story.)
Only freshmen who have com
pleted one quarter's residence at
Stanford (summer quarter ex
cepted) may be rushed throughout
the 12-day period, he continued.
