# Now's the Time to Get Started
## 
### 
The beginning of a new year is the best time
to take stock and ask yourself ' just what am I
contributing to Stanford?"
This campus provides the opportunity to
participate in dozens of extracurricular activi
ties —each of which adds its bit to a whole,
known as the Stanford Community. Are you
doing your share of extracurricular work, or do
you just go to school here?
Most organizations on campus are crying for
more students to help them in expanding their
activities or to take part of the load off of some
of the students now participating. This seems
like a good time, therefore, to take stock of
yourself and determine if you have a little ex
tra time to participate and to help make the
Farm a better place to go to school.
We're speaking particularly to the 300 new
students who are in their first quarter at Stan
ford—the ones who haven't had much of a
crack at life on the Farm yet. But we're not
forgetting the freshman who decided to forego
activities his first quarter just to see how the
grades come out, or the older students who
have never quite gotten started on activities.
Stanford supports a wide range of extracur
ricular activities —diversified enough to put to
good use the interests of nearly every student
on campus. The ASSU publishes its own daily
newspaper, humor magazine, and yearbook. If
you like to write, take pictures, draw, or are
interested in business and advertising, there's
a spot for you on the staff of one of these three
publications.

For those interested in voice training there's
radio station KZSU, and the large number of
theatrical productions staged by Ram's Head
and the Speech and Drama Department.
If student government or the planning and
staging of parties and dances suits your fancy
there's a number of ASSU and class commit
tees for which you might qualify. In addition,
there's a band, an alpine club, religious clubs,
a debate team, a choir and glee club, a camera
club, a Rally Committee, a geography club,
and a YWCA. The lIR offers a job for the inter
nationally minded. In short, there's an almost
countless number of places where a student
may find his niche and make new friends in
exchange for a few hours of his time each week.
Times have changed from the day when
there was an activity man, and there was the
student, and ne'er the twain shall meet. Now
adays activities are regarded as an important
phase of one's college life, and many univer
sities have expressed this changed feeling by
renaming them "co-curricular" activities.
You can put in just about as much time on
activities as you want -anywhere from a few
hours a week to almost a full time job -but the
saying that you get out just what you put in
pretty well holds.
The best time to get started is now. There's
a list of the heads of the various campus organ
izations in the back of the Bawlout. Phone
them or, better still, go see them in person.
You'll be doing your school and yourself a
favor.

a debate team, a choir and glee club, a camera
club, a Rally Committee, a geography club,
and a YWCA. The lIR offers a job for the inter
nationally minded. In short, there's an almost
countless number of places where a student
may find his niche and make new friends in
exchange for a few hours of his time each week.
Times have changed from the day when
there was an activity man, and there was the
student, and ne'er the twain shall meet. Now
adays activities are regarded as an important
phase of one's college life, and many univer
sities have expressed this changed feeling by
renaming them "co-curricular" activities.
You can put in just about as much time on
activities as you want -anywhere from a few
hours a week to almost a full time job -but the
saying that you get out just what you put in
pretty well holds.
The best time to get started is now. There's
a list of the heads of the various campus organ
izations in the back of the Bawlout. Phone
them or, better still, go see them in person.
You'll be doing your school and yourself a
favor.
The beginning of a new year is the best time
to take stock and ask yourself ' just what am I
contributing to Stanford?"
This campus provides the opportunity to
participate in dozens of extracurricular activi
ties —each of which adds its bit to a whole,
known as the Stanford Community. Are you
doing your share of extracurricular work, or do
you just go to school here?
Most organizations on campus are crying for
more students to help them in expanding their
activities or to take part of the load off of some
of the students now participating. This seems
like a good time, therefore, to take stock of
yourself and determine if you have a little ex
tra time to participate and to help make the
Farm a better place to go to school.
We're speaking particularly to the 300 new
students who are in their first quarter at Stan
ford—the ones who haven't had much of a
crack at life on the Farm yet. But we're not
forgetting the freshman who decided to forego
activities his first quarter just to see how the
grades come out, or the older students who
have never quite gotten started on activities.
Stanford supports a wide range of extracur
ricular activities —diversified enough to put to
good use the interests of nearly every student
on campus. The ASSU publishes its own daily
newspaper, humor magazine, and yearbook. If
you like to write, take pictures, draw, or are
interested in business and advertising, there's
a spot for you on the staff of one of these three
publications.

For those interested in voice training there's
radio station KZSU, and the large number of
theatrical productions staged by Ram's Head
and the Speech and Drama Department.
If student government or the planning and
staging of parties and dances suits your fancy
there's a number of ASSU and class commit
tees for which you might qualify. In addition,
there's a band, an alpine club, religious clubs,
a debate team, a choir and glee club, a camera
club, a Rally Committee, a geography club,
and a YWCA. The lIR offers a job for the inter
nationally minded. In short, there's an almost
