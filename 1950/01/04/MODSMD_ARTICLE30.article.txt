# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL DAILEY 
Big Jawn Hall was jawin' on the other end of the
phone:
"So listen, William, here's what we'll do on this
Bull Session deal: I'll write it one day, and you write
it the next."
"But listen, Jawn," I argued, "I don't know whether

I can still write Bull Sessions any
more. I'm afraid the 'touch' might
be gone. It's been so long. I won't
know where to begin."
"Well, lemme see. Why don't you
start out with the old reg day ma
larkey? You know .... the stuff
about Stanford being a barber shop
with a $200 clip job."
"Well, okay," I said. "I'll see if I
can get Lack into the swing with
an easy one like that. Let's see . . >

. . 1 can hit 'em with a few gags about how much
money it costs to go to Stanford. I can tell 'em about
a friend of mine who is working his way through
school selling chopped baby food. Of course the field
is rather limited. After all, how many people have
chopped babies? .... and . . .
"Bill, wait a minute, boy!" This from the other end
of the line.
". . . . and I can tell 'em about how 1 don't have
to worry about finances. My father made a lot of
money last year. But then the government took away
his printing press . . . ."
"Bill, boy . . . ."
". . . . or I can tell them about the people in the
reg line who were moaning about their grades. One
guy standing next to me was so despondent that he

was going to commit suicide by jumping ofT the top
of George Yardley and . . . ."
"Wait a minute, Bill. George might not like . . . ."
". . . . or how about the one about the rich old
guy living here at Stanford. This old guy is so rich
that his hearing aid is equipped for both AM and
FM . . . ."
"Bill "
". . . . Or I might even throw in the one about the
rich birds here at Stanford. Why, just the other day
I saw a robin making a deposit on a new Buick . . . ."
"Willy ..."
. or I can give them something on my philoso
phy about money. My philosophy is: What is money?
After all, it won't buy happiness. But then, on the
other hand, what is happiness? It won't, buy money!
"Hold it, Dailey!"
". . . . or why don't I tell them about the imper
sonations 1 learned over Christmas vacation. I've got
a great impersonation of Roberto Rossellini. I did it
the other night and I was so convincing that my case
comes up in the morning."
"Gosh darn it, Dailey, will you shut up for a min
ute!"
, "Sure, Jawn. Whatsa mallei? Don't you like my
gags?"
"Bill, maybe you had better not. try to write again."
"But, Jawn. I'm just getting warmed up."
"Well, okay, BUI. If you want to do it again, we'll
alternate like we planned. So long."
How about that wise guy trying to intimate that
my jokes are no good. He just hates me because-my
picture is prettier than his.
