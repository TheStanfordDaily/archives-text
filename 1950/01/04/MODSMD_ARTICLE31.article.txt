# CAMPUS OPINION
## Flying Club Raid 
### 
To the Editor:
The members of the Stanford Flying Club who
participated in the pamphlet-bombing raid on the
California campus have, up to this time, remained
siient as to the latest action taken by the Berkeley
authorities. However, since this whole incident has
been carried to a rather ridiculous climax, I believe
that the student body of Stanford should be presented
with the actual happenings and facts of the case.
The complaint issued under Berkeley law charged
us with "careless and reckless flight and endangering
life and property." There is absolutely no basis to
this charge whatsoever. I personally briefed all par
ticipating pilots as to a safe altitude that was to be
maintained at all times over Cal's campus, and also
a diagramed flight-plan was outlined previous to the
take-off for safety purposes.
In anticipation of trouble, and also unknown to
Berkeley authorities at the time, we brought along
with us on the actual raid a Civil Aeronautics Au
thority Flight Examiner. This CAA man, in a pre
vious hearing swore that no planes were flying below
a minimum altitude for safe flight. According to fed
eral law, it is up to the discretion of the pilot when
he is over populated areas to keep and maintain
enough altitude so as to allow him to make a safe
forced-landing in the event of engine failure. All
of our planes over Cal could have easily made it to
open fields for the purpose of a forced-landing should
it have been necessary. A lav/ such as that should
take precedence over local ordinances, for it would
be impossible for a pilot to be cognizant of local laws
concerning flight altitudes of every single city he
may fly over.
One other point should be brought out also, and
that is the fact that not only has the Stanford Flying
Club "bombed" the Cal campus in the previous two
years, but also plenty of advance notice was given on
this year's attack Had the Berkeley authorities fell

so strongly against a Big Game maneuver such as we
had organized, there was no reason why they could
not have issued an injunction or restraining order
against us. News of the raid was publicized in radio
and newspapers for two days before the actual attack.
Every man who possesses a pilot's license is well
aware of CAA laws and the necessity and importance
of upholding thein. Private aviation has a black
enough name as it is, and no pilot is going inten
tionally to violate laws that would cause the suspen
sion of his license and lead to possible fine and jail
sentence. For the purpose of participating in a harm
less Big Game project, seven Stanford pilots were
not going to forfeit their licenses; and with this fact
in mind, every conceivable safety measure was taken
and utilized at the time.
The raid this year saw 150,000 pamphlets fall upon
Berkeley and a total of 10 planes participating. This
is three times the magnitude of previous years, and
it is quite possible that the city authorities of Berke
ley felt that there were too many planes over their
city at one time, and that 150,000 leaflets was too
much propaganda to be consumed by its inhabitants.
But never should they have charged us with careless
and reckless flying a charge that we all vehemently
deny.

with us on the actual raid a Civil Aeronautics Au
thority Flight Examiner. This CAA man, in a pre
vious hearing swore that no planes were flying below
a minimum altitude for safe flight. According to fed
eral law, it is up to the discretion of the pilot when
he is over populated areas to keep and maintain
enough altitude so as to allow him to make a safe
forced-landing in the event of engine failure. All
of our planes over Cal could have easily made it to
open fields for the purpose of a forced-landing should
it have been necessary. A lav/ such as that should
take precedence over local ordinances, for it would
be impossible for a pilot to be cognizant of local laws
concerning flight altitudes of every single city he
may fly over.
One other point should be brought out also, and
that is the fact that not only has the Stanford Flying
Club "bombed" the Cal campus in the previous two
years, but also plenty of advance notice was given on
this year's attack Had the Berkeley authorities fell

so strongly against a Big Game maneuver such as we
had organized, there was no reason why they could
not have issued an injunction or restraining order
against us. News of the raid was publicized in radio
and newspapers for two days before the actual attack.
Every man who possesses a pilot's license is well
aware of CAA laws and the necessity and importance
of upholding thein. Private aviation has a black
enough name as it is, and no pilot is going inten
tionally to violate laws that would cause the suspen
sion of his license and lead to possible fine and jail
sentence. For the purpose of participating in a harm
less Big Game project, seven Stanford pilots were
not going to forfeit their licenses; and with this fact
in mind, every conceivable safety measure was taken
and utilized at the time.
The raid this year saw 150,000 pamphlets fall upon
Berkeley and a total of 10 planes participating. This
is three times the magnitude of previous years, and
it is quite possible that the city authorities of Berke
ley felt that there were too many planes over their
city at one time, and that 150,000 leaflets was too
much propaganda to be consumed by its inhabitants.
But never should they have charged us with careless
and reckless flying a charge that we all vehemently
deny.

To the Editor:
The members of the Stanford Flying Club who
participated in the pamphlet-bombing raid on the
California campus have, up to this time, remained
siient as to the latest action taken by the Berkeley
authorities. However, since this whole incident has
been carried to a rather ridiculous climax, I believe
that the student body of Stanford should be presented
with the actual happenings and facts of the case.
The complaint issued under Berkeley law charged
us with "careless and reckless flight and endangering
life and property." There is absolutely no basis to
this charge whatsoever. I personally briefed all par
ticipating pilots as to a safe altitude that was to be
maintained at all times over Cal's campus, and also
a diagramed flight-plan was outlined previous to the
take-off for safety purposes.
In anticipation of trouble, and also unknown to
Berkeley authorities at the time, we brought along
with us on the actual raid a Civil Aeronautics Au
thority Flight Examiner. This CAA man, in a pre
vious hearing swore that no planes were flying below
a minimum altitude for safe flight. According to fed
