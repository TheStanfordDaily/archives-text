# Ride Tradition
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Thursday night., at five o'clock, while wailing for n
ride at the campus end of Palm Drive, by the pickup
sign, I counted 49 (forty-nine) consecutive automo
biles which failed to stop at either the Village or Palo
Alto signs.
At this time of year when time is so valuable, I
think a public reminder is in order. It's supposed to
h< a tradition.
