What are Stanford's basketball prospects for the 1950 Southern Division
hoop chase? This question is on everybody's mind now, and we should
h; ve a fair idea after this weekend's tussles with USC and UCLA.
The Indians' pre-season record of five wins and four losses does not even
compare with last season's 10-1 record for the same period. However, in
many ways the Indians are a better-balanced club than they were last year,
and certainly will present an aggregation of ball players that will make the
l ame more interesting for their fans.
Not Too Bright
Repressing all optimistic tendencies, we must place the Indians no better
than third in the Conference race. The UCLA Bruins look like the team to
beat in the Southern Division. The Bruins lost only Chuck Clutska and
Hon Pearson from their 1949 championship team, and Coach Johnny
Wooden has found capable replacements for them in Ralph Joeckel and
Eddie Sheldrake. The Bruins' pre-Conference record was very good, with
victories over CCNY and Illinois, defending Big 9 champions, being the
most impressive. In fact, UCLA was the only western team to hold its own
with the eastern bigshots.
(JSC's rough and tough Trojans also rank above Stanford. The Trojans
have virtually the same team they had last year when they were nosed out
by the Bruins. USC has been far from impressive so far this year, but the
piessure boys from Figueroa are always tough to beat in their own league.
The California Bears appear to be in for another lean year. The Bears
managed to win only one Conference game last year, and they arc destined
to meet the same fate again. The Bears seem to have a lot of spirit, but the
personnel is just not there.
Having disposed with the other three teams, let's analyze the situation at
Stanford in a little more detail. Coach Everett Dean's team lacks the expe
rience it has had for the last three years. Two sophomores are already en
trenched in the starting lineup, and a third, Harry Hugasian, may well earn
a starting berth before the season progresses much farther. If these boys
can continue to play top notch basketball under pressure, the Indian out
look will he brighter.
Better For Specs
The Indians' new fast break ofl'ense will definitely make the game more
exciting lor the spectators. Stanford has shown that it can score points.
However, in doing so they seem to have forgotten their defense. A last
break team is not effective if it is unable to get back in time to cover its
defensive area. Several of the team members apparently have not learned
thi.s, or else they are just too tired to keep up such a torrid pace.
Twice the Indians have run up commanding leads in the first ten minutes.
Against Oregon they led 30 to 20 after only one quarter of the game had
been completed. They appeared unbeatable. In the scond half Oregon tied
the game at 67-all, but three Stanford free throws brought victory to the
locals. Against Minnesota the Indians scored 2G points in the first eight
minutes and they again appeared unbeatable. In the second half, however,
the Gophers tied the score and won in the overtime period. The Indians
just couldn't keep up that torrid pace.
In viewing si\ of those nine games, we have come up with the following
opinions:
1. George Yardley has developed into a great basketball player. This is
proven by the fact that the Birdman is criticized whenever he fails to rack
up 1(j points. His long reaching arms have made him deadly on the back
boards, and at times his shooting is phenomenal. The big question, however,
is how long can Yardley last in one game before succumbing to his sinus
trouble. Against Oregon Yardley played the entire second half the first
night, and could hardly walk of? the court. The next night his effectiveness
was drastically reduced.
2. Big Jim Kainstead may become the most consistent man on the team.
He hits the boards very hard for an inexperienced sophomore, and is a
steady pointmaker. His only poor game was against Washington when he
obtained four fouls in the first half, and was able to play only 30 seconds
in the second half before fouling.
3. Jim Walsh may not be as steady as it first appeared. However, he is
still the best shot on the squad, and his aggressiveness is something that
Stanford has not seen since before the war. Walsh also appears to be the
smoothest man on the squad. He was known as "pretty boy" to the fans at
Eugene and Seattle.
4. Co-captain (ins Chavalas has not yet hit his stride. Thus far the In
dians have missed his long range shooting ability. At present this appears
<o be the weakest link in the chain, but once Gus hits his stride the team
will be tremendously improved.
5. Marv Gelher is Stanford's main threat from far out. His two-handed
push shot is deadly at times, and his aggressiveness is tops. What Marv
l.icks in team spirit he makes up in skill.
6. The two-minute rule is a farce. It has the effect of cutting a 40-minute
basketball game to 38 minutes. It ruins the game for the spectators, and
does not help the amge in any way. If you like to leave the game early,
however, it is a good rule.
All in all it looks like a thrilling season. Not much is expected of the
Indians, which maens the team has everything to gain and very little to lose.
This is the situation the team likes.

Repressing all optimistic tendencies, we must place the Indians no better
than third in the Conference race. The UCLA Bruins look like the team to
beat in the Southern Division. The Bruins lost only Chuck Clutska and
Hon Pearson from their 1949 championship team, and Coach Johnny
Wooden has found capable replacements for them in Ralph Joeckel and
Eddie Sheldrake. The Bruins' pre-Conference record was very good, with
victories over CCNY and Illinois, defending Big 9 champions, being the
most impressive. In fact, UCLA was the only western team to hold its own
with the eastern bigshots.
(JSC's rough and tough Trojans also rank above Stanford. The Trojans
have virtually the same team they had last year when they were nosed out
by the Bruins. USC has been far from impressive so far this year, but the
piessure boys from Figueroa are always tough to beat in their own league.
The California Bears appear to be in for another lean year. The Bears
managed to win only one Conference game last year, and they arc destined
to meet the same fate again. The Bears seem to have a lot of spirit, but the
personnel is just not there.
Having disposed with the other three teams, let's analyze the situation at
Stanford in a little more detail. Coach Everett Dean's team lacks the expe
rience it has had for the last three years. Two sophomores are already en
trenched in the starting lineup, and a third, Harry Hugasian, may well earn
a starting berth before the season progresses much farther. If these boys
can continue to play top notch basketball under pressure, the Indian out
look will he brighter.
Better For Specs
The Indians' new fast break ofl'ense will definitely make the game more
exciting lor the spectators. Stanford has shown that it can score points.
However, in doing so they seem to have forgotten their defense. A last
break team is not effective if it is unable to get back in time to cover its
defensive area. Several of the team members apparently have not learned
thi.s, or else they are just too tired to keep up such a torrid pace.
Twice the Indians have run up commanding leads in the first ten minutes.
Against Oregon they led 30 to 20 after only one quarter of the game had
been completed. They appeared unbeatable. In the scond half Oregon tied
the game at 67-all, but three Stanford free throws brought victory to the
locals. Against Minnesota the Indians scored 2G points in the first eight
minutes and they again appeared unbeatable. In the second half, however,
the Gophers tied the score and won in the overtime period. The Indians
just couldn't keep up that torrid pace.
In viewing si\ of those nine games, we have come up with the following
opinions:
1. George Yardley has developed into a great basketball player. This is
proven by the fact that the Birdman is criticized whenever he fails to rack
up 1(j points. His long reaching arms have made him deadly on the back
boards, and at times his shooting is phenomenal. The big question, however,
is how long can Yardley last in one game before succumbing to his sinus
trouble. Against Oregon Yardley played the entire second half the first
night, and could hardly walk of? the court. The next night his effectiveness
was drastically reduced.
2. Big Jim Kainstead may become the most consistent man on the team.
He hits the boards very hard for an inexperienced sophomore, and is a
steady pointmaker. His only poor game was against Washington when he
obtained four fouls in the first half, and was able to play only 30 seconds
in the second half before fouling.
3. Jim Walsh may not be as steady as it first appeared. However, he is
still the best shot on the squad, and his aggressiveness is something that
Stanford has not seen since before the war. Walsh also appears to be the
smoothest man on the squad. He was known as "pretty boy" to the fans at
Eugene and Seattle.
4. Co-captain (ins Chavalas has not yet hit his stride. Thus far the In
dians have missed his long range shooting ability. At present this appears
<o be the weakest link in the chain, but once Gus hits his stride the team
will be tremendously improved.
5. Marv Gelher is Stanford's main threat from far out. His two-handed
push shot is deadly at times, and his aggressiveness is tops. What Marv
l.icks in team spirit he makes up in skill.
6. The two-minute rule is a farce. It has the effect of cutting a 40-minute
basketball game to 38 minutes. It ruins the game for the spectators, and
does not help the amge in any way. If you like to leave the game early,
however, it is a good rule.
All in all it looks like a thrilling season. Not much is expected of the
Indians, which maens the team has everything to gain and very little to lose.
This is the situation the team likes.
What are Stanford's basketball prospects for the 1950 Southern Division
hoop chase? This question is on everybody's mind now, and we should
h; ve a fair idea after this weekend's tussles with USC and UCLA.
The Indians' pre-season record of five wins and four losses does not even
compare with last season's 10-1 record for the same period. However, in
many ways the Indians are a better-balanced club than they were last year,
and certainly will present an aggregation of ball players that will make the
l ame more interesting for their fans.

(JSC's rough and tough Trojans also rank above Stanford. The Trojans
have virtually the same team they had last year when they were nosed out
by the Bruins. USC has been far from impressive so far this year, but the
piessure boys from Figueroa are always tough to beat in their own league.
The California Bears appear to be in for another lean year. The Bears
managed to win only one Conference game last year, and they arc destined
to meet the same fate again. The Bears seem to have a lot of spirit, but the
personnel is just not there.
Having disposed with the other three teams, let's analyze the situation at
Stanford in a little more detail. Coach Everett Dean's team lacks the expe
rience it has had for the last three years. Two sophomores are already en
trenched in the starting lineup, and a third, Harry Hugasian, may well earn
a starting berth before the season progresses much farther. If these boys
can continue to play top notch basketball under pressure, the Indian out
look will he brighter.
Better For Specs
The Indians' new fast break ofl'ense will definitely make the game more
exciting lor the spectators. Stanford has shown that it can score points.
However, in doing so they seem to have forgotten their defense. A last
break team is not effective if it is unable to get back in time to cover its
defensive area. Several of the team members apparently have not learned
thi.s, or else they are just too tired to keep up such a torrid pace.
Twice the Indians have run up commanding leads in the first ten minutes.
Against Oregon they led 30 to 20 after only one quarter of the game had
been completed. They appeared unbeatable. In the scond half Oregon tied
the game at 67-all, but three Stanford free throws brought victory to the
locals. Against Minnesota the Indians scored 2G points in the first eight
minutes and they again appeared unbeatable. In the second half, however,
the Gophers tied the score and won in the overtime period. The Indians
just couldn't keep up that torrid pace.
In viewing si\ of those nine games, we have come up with the following
opinions:
1. George Yardley has developed into a great basketball player. This is
proven by the fact that the Birdman is criticized whenever he fails to rack
up 1(j points. His long reaching arms have made him deadly on the back
boards, and at times his shooting is phenomenal. The big question, however,
is how long can Yardley last in one game before succumbing to his sinus
trouble. Against Oregon Yardley played the entire second half the first
night, and could hardly walk of? the court. The next night his effectiveness
was drastically reduced.
2. Big Jim Kainstead may become the most consistent man on the team.
He hits the boards very hard for an inexperienced sophomore, and is a
steady pointmaker. His only poor game was against Washington when he
obtained four fouls in the first half, and was able to play only 30 seconds
in the second half before fouling.
3. Jim Walsh may not be as steady as it first appeared. However, he is
still the best shot on the squad, and his aggressiveness is something that
Stanford has not seen since before the war. Walsh also appears to be the
smoothest man on the squad. He was known as "pretty boy" to the fans at
Eugene and Seattle.
4. Co-captain (ins Chavalas has not yet hit his stride. Thus far the In
dians have missed his long range shooting ability. At present this appears
<o be the weakest link in the chain, but once Gus hits his stride the team
will be tremendously improved.
5. Marv Gelher is Stanford's main threat from far out. His two-handed
push shot is deadly at times, and his aggressiveness is tops. What Marv
l.icks in team spirit he makes up in skill.
6. The two-minute rule is a farce. It has the effect of cutting a 40-minute
basketball game to 38 minutes. It ruins the game for the spectators, and
does not help the amge in any way. If you like to leave the game early,
however, it is a good rule.
All in all it looks like a thrilling season. Not much is expected of the
Indians, which maens the team has everything to gain and very little to lose.
This is the situation the team likes.
What are Stanford's basketball prospects for the 1950 Southern Division
hoop chase? This question is on everybody's mind now, and we should
h; ve a fair idea after this weekend's tussles with USC and UCLA.
The Indians' pre-season record of five wins and four losses does not even
compare with last season's 10-1 record for the same period. However, in
many ways the Indians are a better-balanced club than they were last year,
and certainly will present an aggregation of ball players that will make the
l ame more interesting for their fans.
Not Too Bright
Repressing all optimistic tendencies, we must place the Indians no better
than third in the Conference race. The UCLA Bruins look like the team to
beat in the Southern Division. The Bruins lost only Chuck Clutska and
Hon Pearson from their 1949 championship team, and Coach Johnny
Wooden has found capable replacements for them in Ralph Joeckel and
Eddie Sheldrake. The Bruins' pre-Conference record was very good, with
victories over CCNY and Illinois, defending Big 9 champions, being the
most impressive. In fact, UCLA was the only western team to hold its own
with the eastern bigshots.
