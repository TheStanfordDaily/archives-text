## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€”The Sta'.c De
partment disclosed belatedly today
that the Chinese Nationalists have
put the issue of saving Formosa di
rectly up to the administration with
an urgent new plea for American
aid.
Ambassador Wellington Koo sub
mitted the plea December 23. He
asked in a formal memorandum for
military support, the unfreezing of
nearly $100,000,000 once earmarked
for China, and the dispatch of mili
tary, political, and economic advis
ers to help save Formosa from con
quest by the Chinese Communists.
