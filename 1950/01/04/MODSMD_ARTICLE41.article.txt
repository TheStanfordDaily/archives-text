# Varsity Works For Loop Opener
## 
### 
Pushed out of the Pavilion by a
few thousand students stampeding
through registration yesterday, the
Farm's varsity cagers were forced
into Encina Gym last night to set up
a satisfactory system to cope with
the twin terrors from the south
land, USC and UCLA, whom they
will take on this weekend.
Seeing as how the Dixie Division
cage scamper roars off the blocks
Friday night, Everett Dean is going
to have to bring his boys along with
a rush to ready them for the Tro
jans, who have beaten the Indians
eight straight times in two years,
and the Bruins, who are tabbed by
the experts as being the team to
beat.
