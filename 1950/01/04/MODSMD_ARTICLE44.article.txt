# ROSE BOWL
## Bear Bungle Similar to '29 
### 
PA'SADENA. Jan .3 (/Pi — Twen
ty-one years after Roy Riegels ran
the wrong way, Rose Bowl gridiron
fates have dealt harshly with anoth
er California center.
Sophomore Charley Harris' low
pass with about two minutes left
to play was blamed by some ob
servers for California's 17-14 defeat
by Ohio State yesterday. Bob Ce
leri, back to punt, juggled the ball,
ran c!ear across the eld, and finally
kicked left - footed —10 yards and
out of bounds on Cal's 13.
Four plays later Jim Hague boot
ed the field goal that gave Ohio
State the game.
Cal Coach Lynn Waldorf, how
j ever, refused to let Harris shoulder
j the blame.
"We had to use Charley after
j George Stathakis, our offensive reg
ular center, was hurt in the first
half. But you can't criticize the boy.
He's been a fine center all year, and
that could happen to anybody. Ce
leri himself told me that he should
have handled that ball."
Either way, it was another tough
break for the Bears, who never will
: forget the 1929 game when Riegels
' raced f>o yards with a fumble to
[ ward his own goal, finally to be
tackled by a teammate on his own
2. A blocked punt then gave Geor
gia Tech an 8-7 victory.
