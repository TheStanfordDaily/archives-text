# Village Has Many Changes Since 1946
## 
### 
The Stanford Village today is as
unlike the Village of 1946-47 as it
was unlike the old Dibble General
Hospital which preceded it. The
only real disadvantage in Village
life today is that it is still a long
way to class.
But even the distance has become
relatively less today as the "share
the - ride" policy — combined with
the fact that nearly half the Vil
lagers own cars—has greatly alle
viated the transportation problem.
The Village, in fact, has assumed
almost country - club - like propor
tions with game rooms, bowling al
leys, a swimming pool, a gymna
sium, a clothing store, and a restau
rant.
Where once the living conditions
were little better than over-crowd
ed barracks, students now have an
option of living in either single,
double, triple, or quadruple rooms.
And the rates are reasonable: $35
per quarter suffices for the quad
ruples and the rent rises propor

tionally up to $(50 per quarter for
the single rooms. The Village fur
nishes these rooms with lockers and
wardrobes, and many of the quar
ters are supplied with outdoor
sleeping porches.
One of the "pride and joys" of
the Village today is the gracious
abundance of Bendix washers (at
10 cents a crack) which are always
available.
The Village was once brutally
over-crowded. Now there is a de
cided lack of students there. The
area was originally built to accom
modate 1,200 people and during the
post - war boom many more were
jammed in. Today there arc less
than 1,000 enjoying the comforts of
the "New Stanford Village."


STREAMLINED LIVING at the Stanford Village includes the efficient cafeteria-style chow line
for man-sized portions of food.
