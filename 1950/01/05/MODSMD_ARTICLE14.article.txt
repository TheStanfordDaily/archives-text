CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS heading for Yosemite National Park and winter sports were stalled
for several hours Tuesday when an unexpected storm deposited some five inches of snow. This
scene is near Bass Lake, north of Fresno in the Sierra foothills. Yosemite reports 12 inches of dry
and powdery snow on the valley floor, with 47 inches at Badger Pass. â€”AP Wirephoto
