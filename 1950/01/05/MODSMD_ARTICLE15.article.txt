# But, Baby, It's Cold...!

An iced Quad and the chilly
| greeting, "I'm freezing," met re
j turning Farm students this quar
: ter as minimum morning tem
peratures nestled at 27 degrees.
Despite the statistics, which say
last year's hay lift and citrus loss
! winter was just as cold, students
j from Los Angeles and Montana alike
[ claimed it was "colder than ever."
Nipped noses, bruised knees and el
bows fr®m the slippery walks, and
J cars "dead" for lack of anti-freeze
| were in evidence as the campus
skidded into winter quarter.
Police Chief Gordon Davis re
ported several minor accidents be
cause of ice on roads near campus,
j He warned students and faculty to
' be particularly careful of ice on
| Mayfield road between the golf
course and the bridge.
As usual, ski enthusiasts got the
j last laugh on the weather, however,
! as they looked forward to a good
snow weekend. Yosemite reported
| 12 inches of dry and powdery snow
j on the valley floor, with 47 inches
at Badger Pass. Ski Club members
may still secure reservations for
this weekend. A report of snow con
ditions for other vicinities was not
expected until later in the week.
Statewide Cold
Elsewhere in the state, Southern
California growers were not en
couraged by tonight's forecast of
continued freezing weather, with a
good chance of snow in foothill
towns.
Lemons and oranges were lul early
loday in spots of Los Angeles and
San Bernardino counties.
Damage to citrus was probably
! the greatest of this season, said Har
old J. Ryan, Los Angeles County
agricultural commissioner, but early
i reports did not indicate losses any-
I where near those of last January's
| deep freeze, which ran into the mil
i lions.
Considerable loss was feared lo
; truck crops in the Coarhella and Im
| perial valleys, as well.
Snow came to many parts of
; Northern California. The flakes
[sprinkled downtown San Jose for
| the first time since 19!52.
! Modesto streets were whitened as
were those at Sacramento, the state's
capital. At. other points ice covered
pools and shallow ponds.
Almost all weather stations in

| California reported minimum tem-
I pcraturcs below the freezing mark.
Crops Hard Hit
Temperatures in the 20\s destroyed
nearly 50 per cent of the artichoke
buds and all late commercially- I
| flowers in some sections of San Ma
teo County, on the San Francisco i
Peninsula, agricultural sources said. !
Streets took an icy coating in San
| Mateo and Marin counties in the |
San Francisco Bay Area following |
an early morning shower, causing j
scores of minor traffic accidents and
injuries to pedestrians.
San Mateo County hospitals re-
I ported 33 persons came in for treat- j
merit for broken bones and sprains !
\ suffered in spills on the ice. And in
j that county more than 100 cars were j
| involved in skids and minor col
i lisions, but no serious injuries were
j reported.
In Marin County, some roads were
too slick for use until after sand had
i been spread on the icc. School buses
were delayed or heJd up for safety
i reasons. The Lagunitas School, with
! 300 pupils, closed for the day when j
the school's six teachers reported :
they were held up by the icc.
There was snow for a while on Ml.
i Diablo, cast of Oakland, and on Mt.
Hamilton near San Jose. In the East
! Bay Area, a dozen persons were hurt j
when they fell on the icy sidewalks. !
Snow All Around
Snow flurries were reported at :
J Santa Rosa and Vallejo, and Stock- i
I ton received its first complete j
j ground covering of whiteness in 19
I years.
A warning on hazardous highway j
conditions in Central and Northern ]
California higher levels was issued j
by the California State Automobile j
Asoeiation. The use of chains was \

advised in all shaded areas, even
those that have been sanded.
A moderate storm was moving
toward tho east, bringing snow to the
Sierra and the high plateaus.
This will result in general clearing
over California on Thursday, the
forecast said, but added "it will re
main abnormally cold, however."
On the desert the mercury dipped
| to 15 at Palmdale and 17 at Indio.
j A dense pall of black smudge
smoke hung over the Greater Los
Angeles area throughout the day.
j It was just a year ago that the city's
all-time low of 27.8 was recorded.
The weather bureau reported that
! a storm which dumped four inches
| of snow on Portland, Oregon, was
also due tonight and could bring a
| repeat of last year's scene, when
j snowmen were built on suburban
j front lawns.
