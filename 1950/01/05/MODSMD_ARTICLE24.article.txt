## 
### 
President Truman, launching the
l!). r >o political campaign, delivered
his annual Slate of the Union mes
sage to the opening session of Con
gress yesterday.
In ;i G,OOO-word report to the joint
Scnatc-llouse session, he asked for
his program of increased social se
curity, civil rights legislation, medi
cal insurance, repeal of the Taft-
Hartley labor law, and more unem
ployment compensation.
He predicted that in the next 50
years the nation's production will
be quadrupled, increasing it to an
unprecedented trillion dollars a
year. He likewise predicted that
the income of the average American
family would be about $12,000 in
the year 2000 three times what il
is now.
Housing legislation to aid the
middle class family, another year of
rent control, curbs on monopoly,
federal aid to let the states "main
tain adequate schools," a national
science foundation, and approval of
the Brannan farm plan were among
other recommendations made by
the President.
He added, furthermore, that au
thority for the c'raft must be con
tinued. Il is not being used now

and expires in June. And the way
many members of the House Armed
Services Committee talk, it stands a
good chance of expiring then with
out any efforts to keep it going," he
said.

and cautious Democratic approval
of some proposals greeted the Pres

Ijeader Joe Martin circulated a
statement saying the Presidential j
report should be labeled a message j
on "The State of Socialism."
The "moderate amount" of new
taxes requested by Mr. Truman
conflicted with Democratic tax j
leaders' demands for cuts in spend
ing, and Southern Democrats came
out as usual against the civil rights
proposal. Senate Democratic Leader
Scott Lucas stated that there was
"nothing unexpected" in the mes
sage and admitted that there were
some "highly controversial" propo
sals in the program, saying that it
would be hard to tell what Congress
may do about them.

future of thr United Nations but at

President Truman, launching the
l!). r >o political campaign, delivered
his annual Slate of the Union mes
sage to the opening session of Con
gress yesterday.
In ;i G,OOO-word report to the joint
Scnatc-llouse session, he asked for
his program of increased social se
curity, civil rights legislation, medi
cal insurance, repeal of the Taft-
Hartley labor law, and more unem
ployment compensation.
He predicted that in the next 50
years the nation's production will
be quadrupled, increasing it to an
unprecedented trillion dollars a
year. He likewise predicted that
the income of the average American
family would be about $12,000 in
the year 2000 three times what il
is now.
Housing legislation to aid the
middle class family, another year of
rent control, curbs on monopoly,
federal aid to let the states "main
tain adequate schools," a national
science foundation, and approval of
the Brannan farm plan were among
other recommendations made by
the President.
He added, furthermore, that au
thority for the c'raft must be con
tinued. Il is not being used now

and expires in June. And the way
many members of the House Armed
Services Committee talk, it stands a
good chance of expiring then with
out any efforts to keep it going," he
said.
