# Touring Frosh Inspect Houses
## Greek-Letter Fraternities Start Rushing Weeks With Open Houses 
### 
Several hundred freshmen started flocking to the 24 fraternity
houses last night to get their first taste of Stanford rushing. The
open houses marked the first evening of a four-night program
which will acquaint freshmen and transfers with the Greek-letter
fraternity men.
Dick Hughes, head sponsor at Encina, estimated that about 75

per cent of the freshmen had headed
up the Row during the rushing
hours.
Most houses enteitained the Class
of '53 with refreshments, tours of
the houses, and games. Nearly 100
men signed the guest books at each
fraternity house, Walt. Varellas,
president of Interfraternity Council,
said.
Allot Times
He urged all frosh to allot a cer
tain amount of time to each house so
as many houses as possible can be
covered.
Several fraternities reported that
the crowds were somewhat lighter
in the houses which are not located
directly on Lasuen. It was expected
that freshmen would visit these
more tonight.
The rushing program will con
tinue tonight, tomoiTow night and
next week. Houses will be open
from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m.
Some confusion has resulted over
who is eligible to attend the open
houses. Although newly-registered
freshmen are not eligible to pledge
until the end of the quarter, Varellas
said any freshman men are welcome
to visit the houses. This will give
everyone an equal chance to become
acquainted with the fraternity sys
tem.
Open Rushing
Open rushing is scheduled to be
gin tomorrow night at 9:15. It will
continue till the night of Jan. 18
when rushees will sign forma!
pledge cards following the prefer
ence dinners.
Although open rushing, which
means "unlimited contact between
rushees and fraternity men," will
begin tomorow evening, Encina
sponsors have requested that frater
nity men not remain in Encina after
11 p.m. during the rushing season.
Also they have requested the frater
nities to conduct business with
freshmen outside their rooms unless
definitely invited into the room.
Fraternities may pledge any eli
gible man after Friday night, but
pledges are not binding until Jan. lb
when the fox-mal pledge cards are
signed.
Qualifications
The qualifications for potential
pledges are one quarter's residence
in the University other than summer
quarter. If men do not qualify they
must wait until the first of spring
quarter to pledge. This applies to
men in their second quarter of resi
dence whose first quarter at Stan
ford was summer quarter, and to
frosh new this quarter.
Sophomore transfers may not
pledge or move into a house until
after one quarter's residence in the
University, but junior transfers may
move in or pledge at any time.
Most of the Row houses said they
had been kept busy getting the
houses in shape for the early rush
ing which follows registration so
closely. Several fraternities sported
new paint jobs for the rushing sea
son.
Varellas said it was important that
formal rushing begin immediately
bccause so many freshmen had come
in contact with fraternity men dur
ing vacation.

had been kept busy getting the
houses in shape for the early rush
ing which follows registration so
closely. Several fraternities sported
new paint jobs for the rushing sea
son.

ing vacation.
