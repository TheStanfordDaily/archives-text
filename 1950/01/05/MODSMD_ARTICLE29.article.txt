# All Hoodlums Aren't on Screen
## 
### 
It is regrettable that we must call the attention
of the student body to the subject of hoodlum
ism and vandalism at the Sunday Evening
Movies.
We are aware that there are students in our
midst who get a kick out of throwing huge pa
pei airplanes, confetti, and toilet paper about to
amuse their schoolmates. To be able to build a
paper airplane which is bigger, faster, and
which travels farther than ones constructed by
other students in the auditorium brings them a
great amount of personal pleasure and satisfac
tion.
We are also aware that there are budding en
gineers among us who possess sufficient in
born mechanical know-how to dismantle a com
plex theater seat, even in the darkness of
Memorial Auditorium.
We dislike to interfere with pleasure or to
stifle genius and so heretofore have said noth
ing. As long as no one gets hurt it's no skin off
our nose.
The University, however, has taken a differ
ent view of the situation and has made it quite
clear that the Sunday Evening Movies will be
discontinued if such acts of rowdiness are not
halted in short order.
We have letters on our desk written to the
ASSU by the heads of the Speech and Drama
Department and the Committee on Public Ex

ercises, showing concern over the mess in
which Sunday evening crowds are leaving
Memorial Hall. One of the letters points out
that the damage done to Ihe Auditorium by one
Sunday movie audience is far greater than the
wear and tear caused by a whole season of
stage productions and concerts. Furthermore,
the extra work of cleaning up large amounts of
paper from every part of the hall and the stage
keeps the already overworked janitor from per
forming many of his other duties during the
early part of the week.
The ASSU has been given responsibility for
correcting these conditions, with the threat that
if the situation is not improved the series may
have to be discontinued.
The ASSU is concerned because it derives a
certain amount of its annual income from the
movie series, even by charging the low price
of twenty cents a head.
The Daily is concerned because we believe
the series performs a worthwhile function on
the Stanford campus. •It is something that
should be continued.
We hope that the student body as a whole
will also become concerned. The conduct of
the audience at this Sunday's show will, in
large part, determine whether the movie series
will be continued through the remainder of the
year.

The ASSU has been given responsibility for
correcting these conditions, with the threat that
if the situation is not improved the series may
have to be discontinued.
The ASSU is concerned because it derives a
certain amount of its annual income from the
movie series, even by charging the low price
of twenty cents a head.
The Daily is concerned because we believe
the series performs a worthwhile function on
the Stanford campus. •It is something that
should be continued.
We hope that the student body as a whole
will also become concerned. The conduct of
the audience at this Sunday's show will, in
large part, determine whether the movie series
will be continued through the remainder of the
year.
