WASHINGTON The government
today ordered many railroads to
slash their passenger service one
third in a new emergency step to
conserve the nation's coal supplies.
The throttle-down command was
issued by the Interstate Commerce

was necessary because coal stocks
are dwindling as a result of the
three day work week John L.
Lewis decreed for his United Mine
Workers last December.
