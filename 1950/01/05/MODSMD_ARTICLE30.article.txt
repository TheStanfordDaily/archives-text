# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
It might be a New Year, but here at Stanford it's
still the same old Farm.
There were those same old grade moans in the
same old Reg lines, and it was the same old rush to

the same old Bookstore. '
And the same old sheep were
standing in that same old first
day line, and the same old wise
boys were making the same old
remarks.
The same old classes were be
ing jammed with the same old
overflows, and the same old last
minute switching of rooms was
l>eing carried out in the same old
haphazard fashion.
Already, the same old letters

to the same old editor were starting to cuss out the
same old people.
And—God help the same old Roble girls it's still
the same old Bull Session.

But, it's great to be back, and freeze or no freeze, it'.s
going to be a red-hot winter.
The Betas are back, the Frat-clubs are beating the
bushes for new blood, the basketball boys are due to
deliver, the sophomore class is planning soon to put on
the Second Annual Gurl Game, and finals aren't com
ing up for 10 more weeks.
Oh yeah, and by the way, I almost forgot to men
tion it—and I should have lust Monday so as to pre
pare you for the shock that Bill Dailey Ls once again
going to start tossing gags at you like you used to
hear way back in the Stone Age.
Dailey will fill this space every other morning with
the best that his writers have to offer. He's really sort
of a poor man's Bob Hope, but that's a silly compari
son, because concerning Dailey there's really no hope
at all.
He's the kind of guy who, if given enough rope
would do something knotty.
But, he's been going plus too many points lately,
and Bull Session has been prescribed as a sure cure.
So, as Robinson Crusoe said, I'll miss you Friday.
