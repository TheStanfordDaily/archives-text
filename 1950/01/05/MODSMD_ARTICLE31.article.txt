Westbrook Pegler

To the Editor:
Although much of yesterday's Bull Session was in
offensive, frankly I resent the author's very serious
protest against Westbrook Pegler, for it reflects the
belief of many who have benefited from the New Deal
that there is something intrinsically sacred in the per
sons not only of FDR, but also of Eleanor and the
children. v
'1 hat the Koosevells are far from godlike is testified
by Prof. Charles A. Beard, John Flynn, and the rather
scandalous actions of several of the second generation
Hoosevelts.
Now it matters not whether one likes or dislikes the
Democratic Party and New Deal or even whether he

believes Beard, Flynn, and Pegler; but it is hardly fair
to criticize a political columnist simply for making
allegations which do not jibe with one's own opinion
of the Koosevelts, and as a newspaperman himself,
John Hall should realize this.
Westbrook Pegler sincerely believes that Franklin
and Eleanor Roosevelt were and still are dangerous
demagogues and he is willing to report sordid, per
sonal incidents of their peculation and misconduct, at
the risk of criticism himself, in order to dispel the il
lusion that the Roosevelt clan embodies all things
noble and infallible.

P. S. Wherefore the ugly and unsportsmanlike (cel
ery head; salute to Bob Celeri? What fault does Hall
impute to him except that he played winning football
against the Stanford team?
