## On The Bench 
### 
California's performance against Ohio State in the Pasadena "classic
made one wonder what would have happened Big Game-wise il the men
between the ends on the Indian team hadn't all been injured. The Buckeyes
handled the Californians like they were playing Sequoia High, and Reck
less Hubert Celeri—"the most improved player on the Coast —showed that
he had not improved quite enough to drive his ball club to victory over the
first really good ball club the Bears had faced.
Santa Clara, on that first day of the season, was not a good (i.e., very good)
club when they met Cal. The Broncs had to come a long way from Straw
berry Canyon to become the team that tied Stanford, lost to Oklahoma by
one TD, and slaughtered powerful Kentucky last Monday in the Orange
Bowl. Stanford sans the services of l'omeroy, Por.lson, Tex White, Abraham,
llokanson. It ice. and without the top services of charley-horser Hal Walker,
was not a good football team the third and fourth quarters.
Hut—vvhoa—this started out to be a rah-rah-California column. The
Hears did a great job this season, and 1 for one would like to go on record
as saying so. They were one of the finest "come through' ball clubs that
it has ever been my misfortune to view. They came up with more of that
stuff called desire than is normal for any grid club, and it is almost unbe
lievable to think that a Cal team had it. Hut had it they did.
Pappy Waldorff's Golden Bears suffered material losses that might very
have folded up a lesser bunch of guys. Jensen —remember him?—went pro.
Jack Swancr wrecked his knee. Hilly Main was declared ineligible. QH
Krick.sou graduated. And there went the '4!) Rose Bowl backfield, even be
fore the season started.
Things got worse instead of better. Cunningham—whom Californians, at
least, had thought was pretty good—was declared ineligible. Sou/.a. easily
the best defensive end on the Coast, caught an injury. And there Cal was—
backless, endless, but with four good—very good—guards and tackles.
So the Bears started building. They took a guy who, in 1948, had been
nothing less than a happy hamburger and made a good quarterback out ot
him. They dug up an unknown named Charlie Sarver and almost made him
another Jensen. They tore out the bottom ol the barrel and came up with a
guy named Begovich, and made him one of the top five ends on the Coast.
Sarver got a Mitchell-like knee in the Wisconsin game, and the team quar
terback—the clown of 1948 —Hob Celeri came through and became a
deadly offensive threat.
And Cal won ball games. They won nine straight and went into the Big
game with an injured Celeri. The Golden Bears came through again. Mo
nachino—until then an average junior back—ran like an angry fire truck,
and Jack Swancr got his knee in shape lor one last—slightly terrible (to
Stanford) —appearance.
Cal was lucky to go all the way. They were lucky to have a "'good" sched
ule. They were lucky against USC, and they were lucky with the Indian in
jury list. But most of all I think they were lucky to have a team with so
much desire, so much guts if you will, to go out and keep on winning ball
games.
Ohio State did not beat a very good football team last Monday afternoon.
Cal was never that. But Ohio did beat a team with a lot of heart. And that
is the finest thing I can say about any ball club.
All hail, California.

was not a good football team the third and fourth quarters.
Hut—vvhoa—this started out to be a rah-rah-California column. The
Hears did a great job this season, and 1 for one would like to go on record
as saying so. They were one of the finest "come through' ball clubs that
it has ever been my misfortune to view. They came up with more of that
stuff called desire than is normal for any grid club, and it is almost unbe
lievable to think that a Cal team had it. Hut had it they did.
Pappy Waldorff's Golden Bears suffered material losses that might very
have folded up a lesser bunch of guys. Jensen —remember him?—went pro.
Jack Swancr wrecked his knee. Hilly Main was declared ineligible. QH
Krick.sou graduated. And there went the '4!) Rose Bowl backfield, even be
fore the season started.
Things got worse instead of better. Cunningham—whom Californians, at
least, had thought was pretty good—was declared ineligible. Sou/.a. easily
the best defensive end on the Coast, caught an injury. And there Cal was—
backless, endless, but with four good—very good—guards and tackles.
So the Bears started building. They took a guy who, in 1948, had been
nothing less than a happy hamburger and made a good quarterback out ot
him. They dug up an unknown named Charlie Sarver and almost made him
another Jensen. They tore out the bottom ol the barrel and came up with a
guy named Begovich, and made him one of the top five ends on the Coast.
Sarver got a Mitchell-like knee in the Wisconsin game, and the team quar
terback—the clown of 1948 —Hob Celeri came through and became a
deadly offensive threat.
And Cal won ball games. They won nine straight and went into the Big
game with an injured Celeri. The Golden Bears came through again. Mo
nachino—until then an average junior back—ran like an angry fire truck,
and Jack Swancr got his knee in shape lor one last—slightly terrible (to
Stanford) —appearance.
Cal was lucky to go all the way. They were lucky to have a "'good" sched
ule. They were lucky against USC, and they were lucky with the Indian in
jury list. But most of all I think they were lucky to have a team with so
much desire, so much guts if you will, to go out and keep on winning ball
games.
Ohio State did not beat a very good football team last Monday afternoon.
Cal was never that. But Ohio did beat a team with a lot of heart. And that
is the finest thing I can say about any ball club.
All hail, California.
California's performance against Ohio State in the Pasadena "classic
made one wonder what would have happened Big Game-wise il the men
between the ends on the Indian team hadn't all been injured. The Buckeyes
handled the Californians like they were playing Sequoia High, and Reck
less Hubert Celeri—"the most improved player on the Coast —showed that
he had not improved quite enough to drive his ball club to victory over the
first really good ball club the Bears had faced.
Santa Clara, on that first day of the season, was not a good (i.e., very good)
club when they met Cal. The Broncs had to come a long way from Straw
berry Canyon to become the team that tied Stanford, lost to Oklahoma by
one TD, and slaughtered powerful Kentucky last Monday in the Orange
Bowl. Stanford sans the services of l'omeroy, Por.lson, Tex White, Abraham,
llokanson. It ice. and without the top services of charley-horser Hal Walker,
was not a good football team the third and fourth quarters.
