# Card Five Leaves Tonight To Meet LA Cage Killers
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Everett Dean's 12 barons of
bounce, holding high hopes of eras
ing a two-year basketball jinx, will
board the Southern Pacific Lark at
9:42 tonight, heading for Los An
geles and a two-game session with
USC and UCLA.
Stanford will be joined by Cal's
Golden Bears on the trek to smog
land, and when the cap gun finally
bangs to open the 1950 Southern
Division cage derby tomorrow
night, fireworks will be set off from
both ends of town.
First explosion will take place at
the Pan Pacific when the Indians

run smack into All-American Bill
Sharman and the USC Trojans. At
the same time, Cul's cellar-dwellers
will be first-nighting against the de
fending champs from ,UCLA over in
Westwood Gym. On Saturday night
the Tribe and Bears will switch
barns and opponents.
As of last night, Dean's Indians
appear to be at top strength for the
first time since the College of Pa
cific season opener. Center Jim
Ramstead, who has been trying to
shake a loaded schnoz by sleeping
nights at the Rest Home, is the only
doubtful entry to the sick - list.
However, even Ramstead has been
well enough to go full speed in the
afternoon drills.
Stanford will need all the
strength it can muster for the Tro
jans, who seem to be even tougher
for the Deanmen than the cham
pion Bruins.
Troy, with jockey Bill Sharman
at the whip, has dumped the In
dians eight straight times, and what
with the same club back from last
year and an added home-court ad
vantage to boot, the Sam Barry
boys will be heavy faorites to notch
number nine.
In addition to Sharman, whose top
performances this season include
'27-point efforts against Canisius and
Loyola, Uncle Sam Barry will start
burly Stan Christie at the center
slot, speeder Tom Riach at the oth
er forward, and guards Bud Doty

and Bob Kolf, all of whom saw con
siderable service last year.
Koll' and Doty serve as the tradi
tional Barry guardsmen. They play
it tough, as does Christie, who needs
no introduction to Bay Area enthu
siasts.
USC ran into trouble during its
recent New York stand aaginst LIU,
and the New Yorkers called Shar
man and the Trojans the sourest
crates of lemons ever shipped out
from the West Coast. But USC is
noted for its lackadaisical pre-con
fprence play, and will undoubtedly
be ready to roll tomorrow night.
Besides, anybody who calls Shar-

man a lemon is a sour grape him
self.

USC has also got gorilla Joe
White, Byron Van Alstyne, and a
hook-shooting forward, A 1 Lamont,
who can cause lots of damage on
the right nights.
So, the Cards have their work cut
out for them. To make matters
worse, win or lose, they have to in
vade the Westwood Gym Saturday
night to meet the champ in his own
corner. And the Westwood corner
is a place UCLA likes to be. The
Bruins haven't dropped a game in
their own barn for over two years.
Everett Dean indicated last night
that his starting team would be the
same that went against Minnesota
and Texas A&M last week in the
Cow Palace, meaning George Yard
ley and Jim Walsh at the forwards,
Jim Ramstead at center, and Marv
Gelber and Gus Chavalas at the
guards.
Harry Hugasian, who is flying in
with the football team at 7:30 this
morning, will just about have time
to wash his hands and buy his books
before joining the basketball squad,
at the depot tonight.
The 12-man varsity includes:
.. Forwards — George Yardley,
Jim Walsh, Jack O'Sullivan, Ron
Garvr, and Gay Bryan.
Centers — Jim Ramstead and
Ralph Carver.
Guards — Marv Gelber, Gus
Chavalas, Harry Hugasian, Bruce
Iverson, and Dick Clegg.
