ANNAPOLIS, Md., Jan. 4 (/I 5 ). —
Eddie J. Erdelatz and top Navy ath
letic officials conferred most of this
afternoon without deciding whether
he will become the Naval Acad
emy's new football coach.
The discussions were suspended
tonight. They will be resumed ■ to
morrow with the former assistant
Navy coach and present aide to
Coach Buck Shaw of the San Fran
cisco '49ers.
Until the Academy announces to
the contrary, the oG-year-old Erde

latz remains the only official pros
pect to succeed Coach George
Sauer, who quit last Friday.
Erdleatz flew East from the West
Coast this morning. He returned to
the Academy, where he was end
coach from 1945 through 1947, with
Capt. Howard Caldwell, director of
athletics.
"We have to see what he wants
and tell him what we want," Cald
well said going into a conference
with Erdelatz.
Prior to Erdelatz's arrival an
Academy spokesman said, "If the
situation works out amicably, Er
delatz will be signed as head coach."
Erdelatz arrived wearing a sum
mr weight suit and observing, "It's
warmer here than in California,
anyway."
