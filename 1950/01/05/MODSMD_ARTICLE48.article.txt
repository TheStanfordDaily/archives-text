NEW YORK, Jan. 4 (A J ) â€” St.
John's of Brooklyn, a smooth,
poised club with victories over the
winners of last seasons two big
national tournaments, today was
ranked the top college team of the
nation in the Associated Press's first
basketball poll of the campaign.
The Brooklyn Redmen, who were
toppled from the unbeaten list last
night by a red-hot CCNY quintet,
54-52. nosed out Kentucky's once
beaten Wildcats in the battle of the
ballot box.
A small school with a murderous
schedule, St. John's downed the
NCAA champions, Kentucky, and
the National Invitation Tourney
kingpins, San Francisco, en route to
its sweep of its first 12 games.
San Francisco, incidentally, now
has been beaten four times, and is
ranked 'way down. The Dons (5-4)
will have to spurt all the way from
now on to make any of the main
March tourneys.
The top teams (first-place ballots
in parentheses, and records includ
ing Tuesday night's games):
Rec. Pts.
1. St. John's (30) ... 12-1 <i%
2. Kentucky (11) ... 7-1 630
