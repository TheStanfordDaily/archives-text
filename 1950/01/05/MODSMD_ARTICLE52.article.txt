# Fine Satire Presented in Paly
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Straw Hat Revue Company,
a small and extremely versatile
group of ex-collegians, is currently
playing in the Palo Alto Commu
j nity Center one of the funniest
original revues ever to lay a local
! audience in the aisles.
The keynote of all this hilarity
i is satire, satire of everything from
dough - kneading radio commenta
j tors to the most bored of all bored
tenors. And socko satire it is. There
i is a casual psychiatrist who stands
, on his head and swan-dives around
I his office while counseling a pa
tient. There is a company of bi
zarre and enthusiastic musicians, a
bass horn, a trombone, a clarinet, a

drum, a piano, all manner of gongs,
be'.ls, whistles, groans, and burps,
which bring to life an old German
beerhall overture with all the finesse
and twice the enthusiasm of a Sal
vation Army band. The music from
the Pinole Music Society comes out
surprisingly full to the galloping ac
companiment and full-roaring di
rection of its leader, Mrs. Eldred
B!odgett.
But the prime sketch of the whole
evening is the operetta, "The Ways
of Love" or "Pretty Mitzi," which
is a takeoff on every wheezy, sleazy
production of wilted, mildewed
story-in-song ever to send the
peasantry into the arms of Commu
nism. Subtitled disarmingly a sa
tiric operetta, "The Ways of Love"
scoops up all the impossible devices
and situations of stock operetta and
browns them slowly and lovingly
over a hot fire of burlesque. Not
one trick is missed.
The bored and very mechanical
tenor sings his dulcet songs of love
straight at the ceiling, while the
dainty soprano screeches into a high
obligato and gets her hands stuck
in the Prince's (tenor) festooned
costume. The chorus puts its wood

en smiles and unisoned cheers into
a rousing song about there always
being a Humbuggia, the proud na
tion of their birth.
But no reviewer, regardless of
his enthusiasm, can rcount the hu
man - but - there - there stiff -
upper-lip story of Eric and Mitzi
anything like the Straw Hat Revu
ers can play it. Nor can he capture
the flavor of the fine and not over
done lampooning of screwy human
ity.
But I can say for an evening of
laugh - a - minute entertainment,
even at $1.80 a throw, you'll have
to go a long way to do better than
the Straw Hat Theater.
