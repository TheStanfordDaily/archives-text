## Dead Week Parties, Ski Films Tabled 
### 
A motion which would forbid so
cial functions during dead week
except for closed Christmas parties
fall quarter was tabled by Excom
last night.
If passed, the proposal would
have replaced an amendment voted
last quarter allowing small closed
parties over by 10 p.m. during dead
week.
The change was proposed because
it was feared that by allowing these
parties, Excom would be "opening
the gate" to all kinds of dead week
activities, and the purpose of dead
week would be defeated.
The amendment voted by Excom
last quarter was prompted by a de
sire to legalize small Christmas par
ties. Last night's proposal would
forbid dead week parties in all
quarters except fall quarter. An
other motion, which would have
made all functions — including
Christmas parties—illegal, was de
feated.
Also tabled, by a 5-4 vote, was
a proposal to have the ASSU spon
sor a Ski Club movie this quarter.
Any proceeds from the showing
would be used to help finance the
ski team.
In order for the event to be held,
the ASSU would have to back the
showing financially in the event all
expenses were not met. Questions
of the constitutionality of the move,
and the dangers in setting a prece
dent. were discussed.
Student Manager John Lilicnthal
announced the tentative distribu
tion of the proceeds from the Fall
Relief Drive. Net income from the
drive was about $3,745.98. With
$66.60 available from Bookstore re
bates, 1948-49, the total available is
$3,812.58.
Sixty per cent of this total, or
$2,287, would go to foreign relief;
•30 per cent, or $1,143.50, to the Palo
Alto Community Chest; and 10 per
cent, or $382.08, to the floating fund.
May 19 was voted a closed date
for the Spring Show in Memorial
Auditorium.
