DEAR S I UDEN I S,
THIS IS LIKE WRITING A PERSONAL NOTE ON A BILL
BOARD. I KNOW,
BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE I HAVE FOR YOU
I HAVE PREPARED A SPECIAL DINNER
FOR YOU. I FEEL YOU AND YOUR DATE WILL
LIKE MY "CHICKEN WITH WALNUTS" MADE
WITH DICED BREAST OF CHICKEN WITH
SQUARES OF TENDER BAMBOO SHOOTS.
DICED COLORADO PASCAL CELERY, AND BUT
TON MUSHROOMS, FLAVORED WITH SWEET
SOYA SAUCE AND HALVES OF WALNUTS.
SERVIED IN ROMANTIC CANDLELIGHT WITH
YOUR FAVORITE REFRESHMENT.
AND BEST OF ALL .... THE DINNER IS PRICED
RIGHT ($1 .35) SO THAT YOU WILL HAVE ENOUGH "LET
TUCE" LEFT FOR THAT DATE.
CORDIALLY
Hem
