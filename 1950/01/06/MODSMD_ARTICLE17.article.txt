# Open Rushing to Start
## Row Men Permitted In Encina 
### 
Open rushing among the 24
Greek-letter fraternities and
freshmen is scheduled to get
under way tonight at 9:15 im
mediately following the open
houses. This marks the first time
this school year that fraternity
men have been allowed in En
cina or been allowed unlimited
contact with the freshmen.
For the third consecutive evening
men's Row houses will be open from
7:15 to 9:15.
House officers reported last night
that "even more freshmen than the
night before" were signing the reg
isters. Many of the prospective
pledges traveled up the Row in
groups. The Interfraternity Council
suggested that this might fce hin
dering some of the men from meet
ing the maximum number of actives.
Next Week
Next week most of the fraternity
houses will invite freshmen to vari
ous lunches and dinners to get a
closer look at them. Fraternity of
ficers urged the new men to take
time before accepting a pledge pin.
One more open house has been set
for next Wednesday night when, it
is hoped, the Class of '53 will com
plete the rounds of the fraternities.
The Interfraternity Council will
meet at 4 p.m. today to discuss last
minute rushing problems before the
"open season" starts tonight.
Some confusion still remains over
who is eligible to take part in rush
ing. The Stanford Fraternity Rush
ing Rules state "only freshmen who
are eligible for rushing and who
have completed one quarter other
than summer quarter, in residence
at Stanford, may be pledged on the
announced formal pledge date or
thereafter.
Regulations
These regulations do not keep
first-quarter freshmen from taking
part in the rushing program, only
from pledging, Walt Varellas, presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council,
emphasized.
Formal pledge cards will be signed
January 18. Until that time pledges
are free to change their minds, Va
rellas said.
Encina authorities reminded fra
ternity men that open rushing i; to
stop at 11 p.m. and actives are not
to enter the frshman rooms unless
specifically invited.
