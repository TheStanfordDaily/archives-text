# Dead Week Parties
## 
### 
Ai;k anyone who has transferred here from
.'m'.lher university, and he'll tell you our "dead
vvocik" is a great thing to have. It is not a Uni
versity rule, however, but has been set up by
i.'ie students, and the administration backs
them up.
Last month, Excom passed a by-law amend
ment which would allow small closed parties,
over by 10 p.m., during dead week. Before
tins was passed, no social functions were to be
Ir-W in the six days preceding final examina
tions.
The change sounds innocent enough. But
'Dean Kimpton, in a letter to Jan O'Brien, ASSU
vice-president, expressed a fear that it might
mark the beginning of the end of dead week.
The Music and Drama Departments, to name
one group, frequently want to schedule re
hearsals and programs during dead week.
And professors would like to give quizzes.
Dean Kimpton wrote:
"We in this office have consistently fought
various faculty and administrative groups to

pievent uny encroachment on the dead week
period .... I greatly fear that the action of
Excom will open the matter up and the faculty
will claim th.it if social affairs can be held, then
certainly academic affairs can be held, too."
Excom came up with two proposals on the
matter Wednesday night.
1. Allow Christmas parties fall quarter, but
no parties the other thiee quarters. This would
still fail to hold the line, but the break would
be smaller.
2. Allow no social functions at all during the
six days preceding finuis. Christmas parties, if
held during that period, would be illegal.
Problems of enforcing ASSU regulations might
be increased.
Mdny need that week before finals to catch
up, or do some extra reviewing to pull up their
grades. The faculty may see little difference
between Christmas parties and Christmas re
hearsals. One thing may lead to anotherâ€”we
shouldn't let dead week slip away from us.
M.H.
