And now ....
II your daily schedule here at
i(hool is anything like mine, you
I • )bably don't get much time for
n iding many magazines or lis—
i aing to the radio. 1 know I
don't. By the time I eat (?),
drink (pardon the expression),

■ leep (ha!), and t,tudy (ha! ha!), there is never much
lime left for stealing comic material from the nel
/orkers or for filching quips from the mags.
Howi ver, during the Christmas holi da/e, 1 spent
. i it tie time perched on my radio (a good trick if yon
e n do it), arid I albo whiied away a few careless mo
ments (between race results) perusing the latent p,ej i
- rlicals. Periodicals: That's a huckster tenn meaning
'Let's put some short stories in hete, S;.m. to fill out
tin space between stocking ads ''
Most of the radio comics are pretty r-ad day.':,
flikf two columnists named Hall and Dailey). Hei»-,
however, are .several goodies, which 1 rather liked.
Woh Hope, commenting on the recent secret wad
ding of Clark Cable and Lady Sylvia: "You knov/
vhat a secret wedding is. That's a ceremony where

the Parson isn't Louella."
Victor Borge, recalling his boyhood days in Den
mark: "One day my father came home and found me
in front of a roaring fire. That made my lather very
mad, as we didn't have a fireplace."
Groucho Marx talking about his playwright friend,
Robert Sherwood: "Bob Sherwood, who is very tall
(G feet, 5 inches), has gotten quite annoyed with peo
ple asking him 'How's the weather up there?' Now
every time somebody pulls that on him, he spits in
their eye and tells them that it's raining."
Speaking of (irouchu Marx, he is now connected
with production that is even funnier than his humor
book "The Communist Manifesto." Seriously, just for
a me meat, 1 caine out ot the dark long enough last
Wednesday to discover that, lie is the quizmaster on a
giveaway show eal led "You Bet Your Life" (CBS,
Wed., (! p.m., PST).
Normally there is no one who hales giveaway shows
more than I do, but this is a little different deal.
There are only three pairs of contestants in the entire
half-hour, mainly because Marx spends so much time
pulling gags on the contestants, lie makes the ma
terial sound like it. is all ad lib, which, of course, it
isn't. The results are really quite hilarious, unlike
the very sad quizmustei performances presently being
turned in by another 01.l timer, Hddie Cantor, on
"Take It or Leave It."
I! you Ibtefi to the Marx .- how and like it, you have
my permrv ion to 'ay you r»*ad about it hi-re. II you
don't like it, you have my permission to write a letter
to thn editor I can't lei Westbrook tfel too far ahead
of me in ront« • t!
