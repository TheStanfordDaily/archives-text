# Stanford Scientists Describe Recent Discoveries at Annual Convention
## New Microscope, Atom Smasher, and Polio Facts Featured: Naturalists' Society Discusses Bugs 
### AL McCOMBS 
While Stanford students put aside
academic worries and headed home
to await Santa Claus and the Mew
Year, numbers of scientists and en
gineers gathered on the Farm for
their annual winter conventions.
The Stanford electronic scientists !
had a field day at the American j
Physical Society meeting. On the '
29th, Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick, origi- ;
ziatoi of the X-ray microscope, un
veiled a more powerful model of his
brainchild which is designed to give
magnification of 50 to 100 diameters.
Although the X-ray microscope is ;
still in the laboratory stage, the I
new, finely finished model is a far j
cry from the crude instrument Dr.
Kirkpatrick first introduced. j
The new instrument, Dr. Kirk
patrick announced, has a resolving
power comparable to many micro- |
scopes operated with ordinary light.
'1 his power, which provides a dis
tinct image, is more important than!
magnification, the Stanford scientist I
said.
Record Set
The following day the society
heard that the Farm's new atom
smasher, the electron linear accel
erator, had set a world's record by
producing 25 million electron volts
at. only 14 left ol jt.s 160-foot length.
The record - producing instrument
was a 15-foot prototype model of
the linear accelerator which is now j
being constructed in the Microwave 1

i'olio Study
Stanford doctors had their say
last, month when the winter edition
of the Stanford Medical Bulletin
appeared. Three doctors studied the
eccentric characteristics of a polio
epidemic in San Diego and made
live conclusions.
The doctors observed that there 1

was some evidence of a link be
tween mean temperature and the
peak of incidence of polio cases. In
San Diego the doctors found that
rigorous isolation of cases and
quarantine of exposed persons is
both logical and advisable.
They further found that the high
est proportions of cases came in
communities where the population
increased the greatest since 1040,
but were surprised to find that the
long-time residents suffered out of
proportion to the newcomers.
Contacts Investigated
Doctors Henrik L. Blum, William
C. Chiapella, and Alex M. Lesem,
the investigating scientists, said that
known contacts with other polio
victims occurred to a large extent in
some communities but rarely in
others. Swimming, trips, and over
exertion, suspicious factors in epi
demics, showed up infrequently in
San Diego case histories.
The fifth conclusion was that age
and sex played an important role in
the type of cuke and severity of at
tack. Children up to two years and
over ltJ suffered more than the 'A to
15 age group. More males than fe
males died in the epidemic studied,
but females got twice as many cases
and were more apt to have para
lyzed limbs.
Three other doctors announced

the use ol f'AS, para-aminosalicylic
acid, with streptomycin as an effec
tive weapon against tuberculosis.
The new drug is still in the proving
stage, but its use in Bay Area hos
pitals has indicated its effectiveness.
Naturalists Meet
The Western Society of Natural
ists descended upon the campus on
December 28, and were enlightened
during the next three days on dow
ers and bees, conservation, and the
Paramecium bursaria. Dr. Verne
Giant of Stanford pointed out the
role of the bee in molding the struc
ture, color, and variety ol today's
flowers because of the little insect's
honey gathering.
Conservation, genetics, and the
natural history of invertebrates
were subjects of panel discussion.
The tiny organism Paramecium
bursaria was presented for its abil
ity to reproduce itself with eight
sexes. Certain varieties of the or
ganism were said to be poisonous to
other sensitive organisms.
Dr. Douglas H. Campbell was
honored on his 90th birthday here
on December hi. Dr. Campbell, pro
fessor - emeritus of botany and a
contemporary of Stanford's first
president. Dr. David Starr Jordan,
is the only living member of the
pioneer faculty.

some communities but rarely in
others. Swimming, trips, and over
exertion, suspicious factors in epi
demics, showed up infrequently in
San Diego case histories.
The fifth conclusion was that age
and sex played an important role in
the type of cuke and severity of at
tack. Children up to two years and
over ltJ suffered more than the 'A to
15 age group. More males than fe
males died in the epidemic studied,
but females got twice as many cases
and were more apt to have para
lyzed limbs.
Three other doctors announced

the use ol f'AS, para-aminosalicylic
acid, with streptomycin as an effec
tive weapon against tuberculosis.
The new drug is still in the proving
stage, but its use in Bay Area hos
pitals has indicated its effectiveness.
Naturalists Meet
The Western Society of Natural
ists descended upon the campus on
December 28, and were enlightened
during the next three days on dow
ers and bees, conservation, and the
Paramecium bursaria. Dr. Verne
Giant of Stanford pointed out the
role of the bee in molding the struc
ture, color, and variety ol today's
flowers because of the little insect's
honey gathering.
Conservation, genetics, and the
natural history of invertebrates
were subjects of panel discussion.
The tiny organism Paramecium
bursaria was presented for its abil
ity to reproduce itself with eight
sexes. Certain varieties of the or
ganism were said to be poisonous to
other sensitive organisms.
Dr. Douglas H. Campbell was
honored on his 90th birthday here
on December hi. Dr. Campbell, pro
fessor - emeritus of botany and a
contemporary of Stanford's first
president. Dr. David Starr Jordan,
is the only living member of the
pioneer faculty.
While Stanford students put aside
academic worries and headed home
to await Santa Claus and the Mew
Year, numbers of scientists and en
gineers gathered on the Farm for
their annual winter conventions.
The Stanford electronic scientists !
had a field day at the American j
Physical Society meeting. On the '
29th, Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick, origi- ;
ziatoi of the X-ray microscope, un
veiled a more powerful model of his
brainchild which is designed to give
magnification of 50 to 100 diameters.
Although the X-ray microscope is ;
still in the laboratory stage, the I
new, finely finished model is a far j
cry from the crude instrument Dr.
Kirkpatrick first introduced. j
The new instrument, Dr. Kirk
patrick announced, has a resolving
power comparable to many micro- |
scopes operated with ordinary light.

tinct image, is more important than!
magnification, the Stanford scientist I
said.

i'olio Study
Stanford doctors had their say
last, month when the winter edition
of the Stanford Medical Bulletin
appeared. Three doctors studied the
eccentric characteristics of a polio
epidemic in San Diego and made
live conclusions.
The doctors observed that there 1

was some evidence of a link be
tween mean temperature and the
peak of incidence of polio cases. In
San Diego the doctors found that
rigorous isolation of cases and
quarantine of exposed persons is
both logical and advisable.
They further found that the high
est proportions of cases came in
communities where the population
increased the greatest since 1040,
but were surprised to find that the
long-time residents suffered out of
proportion to the newcomers.

Doctors Henrik L. Blum, William
C. Chiapella, and Alex M. Lesem,
the investigating scientists, said that

i'olio Study
Stanford doctors had their say
last, month when the winter edition
of the Stanford Medical Bulletin
appeared. Three doctors studied the
eccentric characteristics of a polio
epidemic in San Diego and made
live conclusions.
The doctors observed that there 1

was some evidence of a link be
tween mean temperature and the
peak of incidence of polio cases. In
San Diego the doctors found that
rigorous isolation of cases and
quarantine of exposed persons is
both logical and advisable.
They further found that the high
est proportions of cases came in
communities where the population
increased the greatest since 1040,
but were surprised to find that the
long-time residents suffered out of
proportion to the newcomers.
Contacts Investigated
Doctors Henrik L. Blum, William
C. Chiapella, and Alex M. Lesem,
the investigating scientists, said that
known contacts with other polio
victims occurred to a large extent in
some communities but rarely in
others. Swimming, trips, and over
exertion, suspicious factors in epi
demics, showed up infrequently in
San Diego case histories.
The fifth conclusion was that age
and sex played an important role in
the type of cuke and severity of at
tack. Children up to two years and
over ltJ suffered more than the 'A to
15 age group. More males than fe
males died in the epidemic studied,
but females got twice as many cases
and were more apt to have para
lyzed limbs.
Three other doctors announced

the use ol f'AS, para-aminosalicylic
acid, with streptomycin as an effec
tive weapon against tuberculosis.
The new drug is still in the proving
stage, but its use in Bay Area hos
pitals has indicated its effectiveness.
Naturalists Meet
The Western Society of Natural
ists descended upon the campus on
December 28, and were enlightened
during the next three days on dow
ers and bees, conservation, and the
Paramecium bursaria. Dr. Verne
Giant of Stanford pointed out the
role of the bee in molding the struc
ture, color, and variety ol today's
flowers because of the little insect's
honey gathering.
Conservation, genetics, and the
natural history of invertebrates
were subjects of panel discussion.
The tiny organism Paramecium
bursaria was presented for its abil
ity to reproduce itself with eight
sexes. Certain varieties of the or
ganism were said to be poisonous to
other sensitive organisms.
Dr. Douglas H. Campbell was
honored on his 90th birthday here
on December hi. Dr. Campbell, pro
fessor - emeritus of botany and a
contemporary of Stanford's first
president. Dr. David Starr Jordan,
is the only living member of the
pioneer faculty.
