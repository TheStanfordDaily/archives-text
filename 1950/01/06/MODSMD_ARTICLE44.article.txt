# Extensive Heating System Warms Many 'Farmhouses'

jjCoat collars turned up, mittened
hands carrying new textbooks, and
frosty breaths appearing in liltle
puffsâ€”that's the picture on campus
as the cold streak continues. On
Quad, students hurry from class to
class, while in dormitories, they
huddle around radiators.
All these radiators are connected
indirectly to the "Stanford hearth,"
the steam plant. Here four huge
boilers supply enough steam to heat
radiators nearly 20 hours a day.
At 3:30 a.m. one of the four fire
men starts lighting the fires, and by
5, the dormitories are receiving full
heat. In a cold streak such as this
week's, the 20 - foot - high boilers
evaporate over a million pounds of
water per day. This is about four
times the amount of water boiled in
the steam plant in early October,
Frank Thommen, who has been
foreman of the steam plant for the
past 30 years, explained.
The steam is piped underground

from the steam plant to a tunnel
running from Encina, across the
Quad, to Sequoia Hall. A new line
to Stern Hall was completed ear
lier this fall, and lateral lines ex
tend from the tunnel to the men's
and women's dorms.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said future
plans call for the extension of a
new steam transmission system,
similar to Stern's, to Lagunita and
Roble.
The main steam plant does not
heat the Row residences, but the
Corp Yard handles heating for the
women's Row houses with individ
ual heating units.
To keep the water steaming these
days, the firemen sa}', they must use
9,000 gallons of fuel oil a day. Ear
lier in the year the boilers are heat
ed by surplus PG&E gas, but when
this runs out, oil is used to help
during the cold winter months.
A large 540 - horsepower boiler
was just installed in the steam plant

last month to replace two small ones
which dated back to 1902. One
small one, which has helped keep
Farm radiators sizzling since 1906,
now remains. In addition to the
new boiler, there are two other
large ones which can boil 40,000
pounds of water each hour when
operating at maximum efficiency.
Thommen said it would be im
possible to heat all parts of the
buildings in the Quad, so radiators
have been concentrated in certain
special classroom areas. At present
a survey is being made to discover
which rooms need heat at given
hours, thereby conserving heat.
This year, as many hot shower
addicts may have noticed, the hot
water remains hot later at night.
Last year the boilers were turned
off at 9 p.m. The hot water is now
available until after 10:30, when the
steam plant goes to bed for. the
night. However, during finals week,
the steam is maintained past 11
i o'clock for the late shower-goers.
