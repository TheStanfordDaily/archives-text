# Sunbaked Gridders Return From Islands
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Thirty-four sunbaked football players, clad in straw hats and
highly-colored aloha shirts, arrived at the San Francisco Airport
yesterday morning after spending six fun-packed days in roman
tic Hawaii.
The 40-degree temperature at the airport was quite a shock to

the Stanford team, which had be
ninic accustomed to a soothing tem
perature of 70 to 75 degrees in the Is
lands.
Gone, for a while at least, were
the days of surfboard riding, canoe
ing, and moonlight swimming at fa
mous Waikiki Beach in Honolulu.
The Cardinal team, which, inci
dentally, won the Pineapple Bowl
;ame, 74 to 20, last Monday, arrived
it Honolulu Airport at 0:45 in the
:,.oming December MO, after a pleas
nt nine-hour flight from the main
land.
Lcis and Kisses
Despite the early hour, (lie team
was given an official Hawaiian wel
come with the University of Hawaii
coeds supplying the traditional car
nation lt*is and kisses.
Soon after, with sirens screaming,
the police escorted the Stanford
- roup to the swanky Royal Hawaiian
Hotel, where the team was to re
t.ian for the duration of the trip.
The boys wasted no time heading
. Iraight for the white sand of Wai-
I iki Beach. The team was in swim
i. ing before most of the guests had
; wakened for breakfast.
Pineapple (ialore
After a delicious lunch which in
i uded iced Hawaiian pineapple,
I ineapple salad, pineapple frappe,
: .id a pineapple sundae, the team
was taken to the Punahou School
football field, where they ran
through signals in sweat suits.
The footballers also had a light
.vorkout on Punahou field Saturday
in preparation for the game Monday.
The game itself was played on an
• xtremely blustery day, which found
■ ale-like gusts of wind up to 40 miles
j er hour. The strong wind helped
Chuck Hokanson's kickoffs bounce
into the bleachers, and it also helped
!Jill McColl's tremendous touchdown
I ass to Holy Boruck, which traveled
.i!) yards in the air from the line of
• crimmage.
Sideline Play
The sensational play, which was
made up on the sidelines, thrilled
the 18,000 fans, who also witnessed
flawless conversion kicking.
Defensive halfback Davey Field,
who had spent three years on the
Stanford team without scoring a
touchdown, made the Indians' elev
enth and last six-point effort on a
pass from quarterback Emery
Mitchell with only a few seconds re
maining in the game. For his out
standing play, Field was given the

game football.
! The Hawaiian hospitality is as good
as people say it is—and the Univer
j sity of Hawaii was a perfect host.
; Included in the team's many activ
ities were a tour of the island, an
alumni banquet, and a gala New
j Year's Eve celebration at the Royal
' Hawaiian.
The Stanford group spent most of
(he last two days at the beach ac
quiring a last-minute Hawaiian tan.
However, in their efforts, a few of
the boys achieved the "broiled lob
ster" look.
The entire Stanford party included
] the 34 gridders. Mr. and Mrs,
: Schwartz, Mr. and Mrs. Masters,
! Dean and Mrs. Kimpton, Connie
I Jarvis, Phil Bengtson, and yours
I truly.

.vorkout on Punahou field Saturday
in preparation for the game Monday.
The game itself was played on an
• xtremely blustery day, which found
■ ale-like gusts of wind up to 40 miles
j er hour. The strong wind helped
Chuck Hokanson's kickoffs bounce
into the bleachers, and it also helped
!Jill McColl's tremendous touchdown
I ass to Holy Boruck, which traveled
.i!) yards in the air from the line of
• crimmage.
Sideline Play
The sensational play, which was
made up on the sidelines, thrilled
the 18,000 fans, who also witnessed

who had spent three years on the
Stanford team without scoring a
touchdown, made the Indians' elev
enth and last six-point effort on a
pass from quarterback Emery
Mitchell with only a few seconds re
maining in the game. For his out
standing play, Field was given the

game football.
! The Hawaiian hospitality is as good
as people say it is—and the Univer
j sity of Hawaii was a perfect host.
; Included in the team's many activ
ities were a tour of the island, an
alumni banquet, and a gala New
j Year's Eve celebration at the Royal
' Hawaiian.
The Stanford group spent most of
(he last two days at the beach ac
quiring a last-minute Hawaiian tan.
However, in their efforts, a few of
the boys achieved the "broiled lob
ster" look.
The entire Stanford party included
] the 34 gridders. Mr. and Mrs,
: Schwartz, Mr. and Mrs. Masters,
! Dean and Mrs. Kimpton, Connie
I Jarvis, Phil Bengtson, and yours
I truly.
Thirty-four sunbaked football players, clad in straw hats and
highly-colored aloha shirts, arrived at the San Francisco Airport
yesterday morning after spending six fun-packed days in roman
