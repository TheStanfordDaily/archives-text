# Card Boxing Team Bolstered
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity boxing team,
under the direction of Coaeli Ray
Lunny, started rounding into shape
yesterday after the holidays. This
year's seven-match season will open |
January 13 when the Cardinal mitt- i
men meet California at Berkeley.
Though very strong in some I
weight divisions, Lunny's boys will ;
have to forfeit all their 125- and
130-lb. matches unless some new
men turn out. Five lettermen are
returning from last year's squad, j
The addition of three Intramural
(Novice) Tournament champions,
Dave Oberlin, Don Enberg, and
Jack Bickel, will give the team
needed strength in the heavier
brackets.
Here's how the team looks at this
time:
Heavyweight— Dave Oberlin will
take over the post this season that
has been vacated by Mike Pelsinger,
who is out for the season after a
serious ankle operation. Oberlin, |
an aggressive, slugging fighter, ran j
up an impressive record in the Nov
ice Tourney with two TKO's and a j
knockout.
Light - heavyweight — Jim Ham
mond, a varsity boxer with two
years' experience, will be joined
this season by two novice cham
pions, Don Enberg and Jack Bick
el. Enberg, the most impressive

fighter the tourney has produced,
scored two knockouts and a TKO to
win his golden glove. Bickel, now
1 overweight, won the middleweight
division after facing tough tourney
j competition.
Middleweight Bill Sharp, victor
iin last December's All-U 165-lb.
fracas and a boxer with two years'
! experience, will be top man in this
J weight, followed by hard-punching
i Bob Wulff, runner-up novice mid
| dleweight.
Senior welterweight Two good
fighters in the persons of A 1 Ander
son and John Colton will fill this
weight division. Colton is a com
parative newcomer who has shown
quite a bit of promise. Anderson,
varsity boxer last year, lost to Wil
lie Altus, who is now ineligible, in
the All-U.
Welterweight This well-fortified
bracket boasts two of the best box
ers on the squad, Jose Rael and
! Karl May. Rael was undefeated as
a lightweight last year and May lost
|n split decision to him in the All-U.
i Lightweight The 135—1b. division
\ will also be strong Ibis season. Jay
Savage heads the list but will be
closely followed by Bob Baker and
newcomer Gene Hudson. Savage
decisioned Baker in the All -U.
Hudson was a semi-finalist in the
Novice Tourney.
