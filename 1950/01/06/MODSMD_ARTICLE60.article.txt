# Card Ruggers Start Practice
## 
### 
The 1950 edition of the Stanford
rugby team hit the practice field for
the first time yesterday and Coach
Chuck Taylor was greeted by a
turnout of GO ruggers, a number
which will be swelled considerably
when some of the footballers join
the squad.
As yet the schedule has not been
drawn up, but the first game is a
week from Saturday, and there is a
possibility of a trip cither to Can
ada or Los Angeles.
The best news of theday was pro
vided by Ed Culin, who unexpect
edly returned for another quarter.
Culin is the place-kicking special
ist, and Taylor would have been
hard pressed to replace him if he
had failed to return. Most serious
losses through graduation from last
year's squad are Marly Feldman, Al
Morris, and Bob Lindsay.
Stanford wil! again be a member
of the Northern California Rugby
Union, which includes Pctaluma,
the Olympic Club, Menlo Ramblers,
University Club, and the University
of California. In addition the In
dians will probably have games
with British Columbia and UCLA.
The squad will be divided into a
varsity and a junior varsity, with
each team participating as a unit in
the regularly scheduled games.
Returning lettermen include Mike
Spiro (captain), Sarge Littlehale,
Ralph Davidson, Ed Culin, Sam
Halstead, Darrhl Dentoni, Pete
Peckham, Pat DeYoung, Dick
Hughes, Bill Geary, Boyd Benson,
and Vance Sheffey.
