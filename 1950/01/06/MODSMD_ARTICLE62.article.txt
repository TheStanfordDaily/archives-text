# Cardinal Quintet Opposes USC, UCLA In 1950 Southern Division Inaugurals
## 
### JOHN HALL 
They're off and running—or at
least they will be tonight when
Everett Dean's Indians invade the
Pan Pacific Auditorium in Los An
geles to swap blows with USC':
burly Trojans in the initial outing oi
the 1950 Southern Division season.
Dean packed his 12-man varsity
aboard the Lark late last night, ant
they were scheduled to arrive in Lot
Angeles at 8 this morning, at. which
time they will go directly to tin
Chapman Park Hotel to set up head
quarters for the weekend.
TipolT for tonight's USC battle
is scheduled for Sr.'lt). U will he
piped out to the B: y Area radio
fans by Station KSi i).
Tomorow night the Tribe moves
into the jinxed Westvvood Gym to
mix things up with UCLA. TipolV
will take place at (he san e time,
but the radio dial changes to
KROW.
Stanford will go into tonight's
opener as definite underdog, as USC
is boasting an eight-game win streak
over the Dean men, and will be led
by the deadly Bill Sharmari.
Second Night Jinx
Things won't pick up much tomor
row night either, as in UCLA, the
Cards face the defending champs,
must meet them in their own corner,
and will be doing so on that old
Slaniord bugaboo — The Second
Night.
Preparation for the weekend
meetings has been unusually difficult
because the Bruins and Trojans rep
resent such different playing styles.
USC employs a slow-break, ball
control offense, which is built around
the one-man carnival—Bill Shar
man. The Trojans very seldom get
too excited over anything, and would
rather wear a team down by crunch
ing it to pieces on the boards than
by running up and clown the floor.
Speedy Bruins
UCLA is the exact opposite. The
Bruins fire around like a lit fuse,
with an offense made up of five wild
and weird scramblers — Stanich.
Sawyer, Sheldrake, Joekel, and
Kraushaar.
However, the Stanford dribble ex
perts will treat both Bruin and Tro
jans the same in one respect—they
will go fast and keep going until they
make or break themselves.
Against Troy, the Cards have the
Sharman headache, which at the
moment has been passed off on
Marv Gell.er, who will follow the
Figueroa ace everywhere he goes.
If Gelber can do a good job on
Sharman, Stanford must rate a
chance to upset the favored Troys.
Stanford's scoring attack should be
more varied than the last time the

Cards and Troys met. Now, instead
of heaping the whole load on Yard
ley, who was supposed to carry the
digit duties all by himself last sea
son in the Southland series, the
Tribe can now threaten with the
eagle-eyed Jim Walsh, and the im
proving Jim Ramstead.
All three have been splitting the
scoring chores in the lasl few games,
with Yardley setting the pace with
an average of 15 per, Walsh next
with 11 per, and Ramstead a con
sistent 9 each time out.
There was one last-minute change
in Stanford traveling squad, with
sophomore Gary Andrews replacing

■ speed merchant Gay Bryan, who has
been ailing with an impacted wis
dom tooth and hasn't been able t<j
work out regularly.
The starting lineups:
STANFORD pos. USC
Yardley f. Sliarman
Walsh f. Riacli
Ramstead e, Christie
Gelher g. IJoty
Chavalas g. Koll'
STANFORD pos. UCLA
Yardley f. Sawyer
Walsh f. Joekel
Ramstead c. Kraushaar
Gel Iter g. Sheldrake
Chavalas g. Stanich


JIM RAMSTEAD, Stanford's 6-foot, 5-inch sophomore center, is
being counted upon to carry a large share of the Indians' scor
ing burden this weekend as the Cards open the Southern Di
vision season against USC and UCLA.
