II something is stolen from
you in mystic Tibet, your wor
ries do not end with the cap- j
ture of the thief.
The thief is duly punished but.)
nl(boiivh you are the aggrieved parly, j
you are al o fined for your cu'e- I
les n:'s.s. Furthermore, whatever i
war: stolen from you, if recovered, is :
confiscated on the ground that it
con litotes an object of temptation.
That is fine aspect of ju lice in
Tilxd, according to Professor Li
Y u -1. of Yemching University, I'f i- j
pin , wit'n whom ! had an exclusive !
Jnlei vie w upon his return from Tibet
lifter rroic than three years' cultuini
survey work there.
There is no death penalty in Tibet, J

nothing more serious than having his

The lamaseries in Tilul have
wax "d rich through their I rack* mo
nopoly o! exorchm. For this service,
the lamas are royally entertained
with lood and are paid fat fees. If
the man dies, the lama:, ascribe his
death to oversirinin j and prescribe
further service's to cleanse his sou ;
otherwise, ihey declare, the dead
man will lie reincarnated as an ani
mal.
To Ie called a flog or a skrnk is
had cnou'.'h, the Tibetans think, but
lo be re I on as on£ is a prospect
none relishes. The coftly (Hit ification
ervicc explains why often the entire
properly of a dead man is donated
by hi., iamily to a b ma cry.
Gifts (if Gold
The gold and precious sloii" userl
in Ihe eoivlruction of the pagoda
arc partly brought from China and
India, and partly obtained in the
orrn ol 'tills lrom pilgrims to the
lamaseries. Although Tibet has to'd
and othei n tural resources, the Ti-
I elan government will not allow
I,llem to be mined bees use of an an
cient superstition which says thai if
the natural resources are removed,
the oner y of the earth will be weak

'•lops and disease among the people.
In Tibet, nobody calls a chair a
i chair. T here are three levels of
speech the ordinary, the honorific,
and the super-honorific. In ordinal y
language, a chair is tailed a "re
ceiver of hut locks." Tue honorif.c
t. nn is "hi :h uiatlres." If the super
honorific description is desirable,
then it is called a "golden t none."
Family Names
Tibetans' names convey no sug
gestion of family lineage. A baby
takes its surname from the house in
which il is I orn. For example, you
may be born in 1 he; Porcelain Mug
Fa' lory. A Buddhist name is given
lo you, and by the time your par
rut. finifh you may l>e known by
something like "Long Life and Pros
peiity Porcelain Mug Factory."
| In the troubled world of today,
Tibetans think theirs is the safest
country. They believe the country is
protected lrom harm by a guardian
| spirit which is even a match for
modern combat aire rail. During the
war, many pianos crashed in 'I ibct,
occurrence,* wnieh <,nly served to
I tieiiithen this belief.
Alter the first American pi.nr.*

Some Tibetans swore thai they saw
the plane being attacked by a dra
