# IIR Poll Seeks Campus Opinion On Past Projects
## 
### 
A Iwo-pagc questionnaire put out,
by the lIR Survey Committee is
now circulating on the campus. The
questionnaire lists the major proj- j
eels which have been effected by |
the lIR during the past few years.
It asks students to nile Ihem on a
scale from "excellent" to "not worth
while."
Through this poll the lIR is at
j tempting to learn what opinions ami
! suggestions ils membcrs-at-large
the Stanford student body have in
mind. Suggestions for future im- j
I provemcnt are also solicited.
The poll is constructed much as
the large national polls are, using
j a carefully selected sample cover
j ing about 3.75 per cent of 1 lie stu
j dent body. Though the results of
; the survey will be computed on the
basis of the weighted sample, an
additional 700 questionnaires will be
j distributed among the student body.
All Stanforditcs interested in
helping with the surveyâ€”as well as
with a handbook for Stanford stu- I
i dents going to Europe next sum
j mcr- -may become members of the
! Survey Committee, according to
i Joan Wit/man, committee chairman.
The first meeting of the quarter
will be on Wednesday at 4:15 in the
lIR office. Interested students who
cannot attend the meeting are asked
; to contact Miss Witzman at the of
i fiee either today or Friday between i
' 5 and (i p.m.
