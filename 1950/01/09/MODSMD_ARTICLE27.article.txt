# A 						New Policy on Letters
## 
### 
Just before Christmas vacation we received
a ' Letter to the Editor" from a student who had
observed that drivers were being lax about
picking up riders at the traditional ride stations.
At the end of the letter was the request "please
withhold my name."
Six students recently signed a letter which
praised the Student-Faculty Talent Show held
in connection with the Fall Relief Drive. They
also requested that their names be left off
should the letter be printed.
A student wrote in to remind the campus of
the Big Game "Dutch treat" tradition. Name
withheld by request.
Six other readers criticized the football coach
ing staff from the Campus Opinion column but
requested that their names be left out of it.
This is but a sample of the alarmingly large
number of "Letters to the Editor" that we have
received this volume that have concluded with
the familiar phrase "please withhold my
name."
Some of these requests were justified, but
most of them, we believe, were not. The au
thors merely preferred to remain anonymous
because it seemed like the easiest thing to do.
Nevertheless, all of them were printed without
names because that was our policy.
Letters to the Editor" are the lifeblood of a
sound editorial policy for any newspaper. An
editor, acting as the spokesman for his readers,

ran al best only put into print what he believes
the majority ol his readers are thinking. The
reader himself is the only one who can tell
what he actually is thinking. That is why a
reader's opinion column has no substitute as a
device for airing both sides of a controversy, or
for expressing new views and ideas.
The Daily has always devoted as much space
as is necessary to print all of the letters that we
receive which are suitable for publication from
the standpoint of good taste and public interest.
We believe that in many cases a reader's opin
ion, honestly expressed, can do as much toward
the molding of public opinion as the most
stylishly worded editorial.
Stanford Daily readership surveys, showing
that a remarkably high percentage of students
regularly read the Campus Opinion column,
have borne out this belief.
In exchange for space in our editorial col
umns we have only required that the letters be
written with sincerity. We question the sin
cerity of the opinion of a person who does not
wish his name connected with it.
We are therefore announcing a new policy
on letters. In the future names will be with
held from publication only when we deem it
necessary to protect the author. The opinions
of a reader who does not feel strongly enough
about them to have his name connected will
not be printed.
