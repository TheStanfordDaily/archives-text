# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
This isn't Alaska, or California in '49, but you won't
he able to tell the difference during the next few
days because—as the gold miners and Walt Varellas
once said —the RUSH is on.
Rushing is to the fraternity

system what reproduction is to
the human race.
What I mean to say simply is
that Stanford's two dozen fiat
clubs (fraternities, that is) are
right now beating an 8-lane high
way to the doors and floors of old
Encina. In a word, the brothers
are on the prowl.
And there's nothing as danger
ous as a hungry frat man out on
the prowl. His hand is a little

gladder, his story a little sadder, his smile a little
toothier, and his pledge pin a little loosier.
But, it's all very harmless, and good for the soul
they say. So, no matter how much the fraternities
moan, rushing is here to stay.
The fundamental motiatino is to get a better class
than "those dirty Zetes" or "those dirty Fiji.*:" or
"those dirty Delts," as the case may be.
To accomplish this greedy purpose, all the frats
spend great amounts of time designing offensive at
tacks to grab off as many nuggets as possible.
A nugget Ls a rushee who has money, a personality,
athletic ability (such as an all-city or all-state foot
ball, basketball, or baseball player), and must be

wanted by at least five other frats. Above all, that's
the clincher. If other frats want him, he's the one to
get.
To lead this attack on the Encina eligibles, each fra
ternity selects an ace salesman who is called the Rush
Chairman. This character must possess several out
standing qualities, such as stubbornness, doggedness,
a good memory, stubbornness, a polished line, and a
little stubbornness.
He's got to be the kind of character who will never
believe that a nugget won't take at least ONE more
pin, or won't hand back the couple he's already been
tagged with.
My tong &ot off pretty lucky. We got a boy who is
so stubborn he removed the backspace key from his
typewriter. He just won't quit. He's honest, too.
He'll wine and dine a prospect, promise him the House
Manager's job inside of two quarters, get down on his
knees and beg, and then he'll say sincerely, "We
didn't want him, anyway. He wouldn't have fit in
with the group."'
Me, 1 take a dim view of all this running around,
exaggerated promise making, and wholesale distri
bution of pledge pins.
It's all rather disgusting and I won't have anything
to do with it.
The only thing 1 want to say is—listen, Mathias,
(■'mere and sit down for a minute. I got a deal for you.

didn't want him, anyway. He wouldn't have fit in
with the group."'
Me, 1 take a dim view of all this running around,
exaggerated promise making, and wholesale distri
bution of pledge pins.
It's all rather disgusting and I won't have anything
to do with it.
The only thing 1 want to say is—listen, Mathias,
(■'mere and sit down for a minute. I got a deal for you.
Me and the brothers were talking and we decided
that

This isn't Alaska, or California in '49, but you won't
he able to tell the difference during the next few
days because—as the gold miners and Walt Varellas
once said —the RUSH is on.
Rushing is to the fraternity

system what reproduction is to
the human race.
What I mean to say simply is
that Stanford's two dozen fiat
clubs (fraternities, that is) are
right now beating an 8-lane high
way to the doors and floors of old
Encina. In a word, the brothers
are on the prowl.
And there's nothing as danger
ous as a hungry frat man out on
the prowl. His hand is a little

gladder, his story a little sadder, his smile a little
toothier, and his pledge pin a little loosier.
But, it's all very harmless, and good for the soul
they say. So, no matter how much the fraternities
moan, rushing is here to stay.
The fundamental motiatino is to get a better class
than "those dirty Zetes" or "those dirty Fiji.*:" or
"those dirty Delts," as the case may be.
To accomplish this greedy purpose, all the frats
spend great amounts of time designing offensive at
tacks to grab off as many nuggets as possible.
A nugget Ls a rushee who has money, a personality,
athletic ability (such as an all-city or all-state foot
ball, basketball, or baseball player), and must be

wanted by at least five other frats. Above all, that's
the clincher. If other frats want him, he's the one to
get.
To lead this attack on the Encina eligibles, each fra
ternity selects an ace salesman who is called the Rush
Chairman. This character must possess several out
standing qualities, such as stubbornness, doggedness,
a good memory, stubbornness, a polished line, and a
little stubbornness.
He's got to be the kind of character who will never
believe that a nugget won't take at least ONE more
pin, or won't hand back the couple he's already been
tagged with.
My tong &ot off pretty lucky. We got a boy who is
so stubborn he removed the backspace key from his
typewriter. He just won't quit. He's honest, too.
He'll wine and dine a prospect, promise him the House
Manager's job inside of two quarters, get down on his
knees and beg, and then he'll say sincerely, "We
didn't want him, anyway. He wouldn't have fit in
with the group."'
