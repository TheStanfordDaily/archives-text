# Marines Take Over 'Sequoia' Screen In Showing Bloody Capture of Iwo Jima
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
From the hulls of Montezuma
down the bloody jungle paths trod
by movie infantry, paratrooper, and
seabees come celluloid marines. The
only difference is their destination
-•"The Sands of Iwo Jima."
To placid Australia for training
come raw marine recruits. They

are whipped into shape by blood
and-thunder Sergeant John Wayne,

the muddy'
beaches of Ta
rawa, and some

last to stand at j

attention amid deadly bullets as the
Mag is raised on Mount Suribachi.
Academy Award Bid
Republic's bid for an Academy
Award, now playing at the Sequoia
Theater, gains immensely from
some good action shots, a strong ami
thoroughly believable performance
by John Wayne, and a plot that is
less heroic than most war films.
Unhappily the plot gets tangled in
a taffy-like mass of sub-plots and j

sub-s'ub-plols which have a lot in
common with sub - plots in other
Hollywood movies. These include
Wayne's unhappy domestic life and
the dislike of John Agar, who is the
son of Wayne's late lire-eating com
mander, for the rough, tough life.
Agar, who seems to have no more
acting ability than his estranged
wife, cannot be swallowed by the
audience; who must receive him as
an "intellectual."
Film Stumbles
Jr> its most dramatic moment,

was a hazardous task in which three
teams of men failed and were shot.
In the film Wayne's squad stands
motionless on the Jap-inlested hill
while the flag is effortlessly raised.
"Sands of Iwo Jima" is a would
be epic that is hardly epical but is a
tidy, slightly belter than average
war film.
