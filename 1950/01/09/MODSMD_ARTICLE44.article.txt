# Varsity Hoopsters Drop Two Games in Southland
## 
### 
Stanford's Southland-jinxed Indians returned to the Farm late
last night after a disastrous Southern Division debut this weekend
against USC and UCLA.
The Card cagers will waste no time in getting back into the Pa
vilion this afternoon to start warming up for Friday night's odds-

even clash with California, who got
the same double-dousing treatment
from the Los Angeles clubs this
weekend.
Sharman Hits 31
USC's Trojans coasted in on Bill
Sharman's 31-point spree to romp
past the Deanmen Friday night in
the Pan Pacific, 715 to SH.
Saturday night, UCLA put on the
pressure alter a 139-iM deadlock at
halltime to wallop Stanford, 71 to
55, in Westwood Gym.
The two defeats marked the In
dians' 9th straight to Troy, their 4th
to UCLA, and brought their season
total to 5 wins and (J losses. It was
al.so the third straight year that
Stanford has gotten off to a disap
pointing start in league play.
The USC game was strictly no
contest. Sharman and A 1 Lamont, a
transfer from Sacramento JC, saw to
that with a fine shooting display
which jumped Troy into a wire to

wire lead. Sharman's 31 points sur
passed Luisetti's Southern Division
high of 30, and was only 5 points
away from Ralph Vaughn's high of
36.
Brightest spot of the first night loss
was Brucd Iverson's holding Shar
inun scoreless in the last five min
utes. That feat was considered to be
almost great until Jim Payne of Cali
fornia held Sharman scoreless for 25
minutes just one night later.
Yardley, Walsh High Scorers
George Yardley t .nd Jim Walsh
paced the first-night scoring for the
Tribe, as George dunked 16, and Jim
followed closely with 15. Yardley
also contributed 13 digits against the
Bruins for a two-night total of 29.
Sharman's 39 is the only figure
topping Yardley, with Lamont's 25,
and UCLA's Ed Sheldrake's 26 close
behind.
Ed Sheldrake's 21-point perform
ance against the Carols help UCLA
considerably, after Stanford had
pushed the Bruins into a knot dur
ing the last five minutes of the first
half.
But coining out for the second half,
Stanford couldn't hit its shots, and a
combination of wild passes and
UCLA ball control destroyed the In
dians.

Sharman Hits 31
USC's Trojans coasted in on Bill

past the Deanmen Friday night in
the Pan Pacific, 715 to SH.
Saturday night, UCLA put on the
pressure alter a 139-iM deadlock at
halltime to wallop Stanford, 71 to
55, in Westwood Gym.
The two defeats marked the In
dians' 9th straight to Troy, their 4th
to UCLA, and brought their season
total to 5 wins and (J losses. It was
al.so the third straight year that
Stanford has gotten off to a disap

The USC game was strictly no
contest. Sharman and A 1 Lamont, a
transfer from Sacramento JC, saw to
that with a fine shooting display
which jumped Troy into a wire to

wire lead. Sharman's 31 points sur
passed Luisetti's Southern Division
high of 30, and was only 5 points
away from Ralph Vaughn's high of
36.
Brightest spot of the first night loss
was Brucd Iverson's holding Shar

almost great until Jim Payne of Cali
fornia held Sharman scoreless for 25
minutes just one night later.

Sharman Hits 31
USC's Trojans coasted in on Bill
Sharman's 31-point spree to romp
past the Deanmen Friday night in
the Pan Pacific, 715 to SH.
Saturday night, UCLA put on the
pressure alter a 139-iM deadlock at
halltime to wallop Stanford, 71 to
55, in Westwood Gym.
The two defeats marked the In
dians' 9th straight to Troy, their 4th
to UCLA, and brought their season
total to 5 wins and (J losses. It was
al.so the third straight year that
Stanford has gotten off to a disap
pointing start in league play.
The USC game was strictly no
contest. Sharman and A 1 Lamont, a
transfer from Sacramento JC, saw to
that with a fine shooting display
which jumped Troy into a wire to

wire lead. Sharman's 31 points sur
passed Luisetti's Southern Division
high of 30, and was only 5 points
away from Ralph Vaughn's high of
36.
Brightest spot of the first night loss
was Brucd Iverson's holding Shar
inun scoreless in the last five min
utes. That feat was considered to be
almost great until Jim Payne of Cali
fornia held Sharman scoreless for 25
minutes just one night later.
Yardley, Walsh High Scorers
George Yardley t .nd Jim Walsh
paced the first-night scoring for the
Tribe, as George dunked 16, and Jim
followed closely with 15. Yardley
also contributed 13 digits against the
Bruins for a two-night total of 29.
Sharman's 39 is the only figure
topping Yardley, with Lamont's 25,
and UCLA's Ed Sheldrake's 26 close
behind.
Ed Sheldrake's 21-point perform
ance against the Carols help UCLA
considerably, after Stanford had
pushed the Bruins into a knot dur
ing the last five minutes of the first
half.
But coining out for the second half,
Stanford couldn't hit its shots, and a
combination of wild passes and
UCLA ball control destroyed the In
dians.
