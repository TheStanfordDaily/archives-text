THREE TOP GOLFERS, whose prospects on golf's money trail are altered by the return of Ben
Hogan to tournament play, weigh their chances as they watch his game on a Los Angeles, Calif.,
course. They are, from left, Bob Hamilton, Cary Middlecoff, and Chuck Congdon, watching
Bantam Ben putting on the sixth green during a practice round for the $15,000 Los Angeles
Open Tournament. Hogan was badly injured in an automobile accident last February. He shot
a 73 on opening day of the tournament, and then roared back with a 3-under-par 69 his second
day out. â€”AP Wirephoto
