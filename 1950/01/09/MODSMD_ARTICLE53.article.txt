## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 8 (JP).—Play
in the third round of the Los An
geles Open Golf Tournament was
canceled today because of rain. Ben
Hogan, in ius third day on the
comeback trail, shot a four-over-par
75.
More than half the field had fin
ished, most of the players with high
scores, when the committee in
charge called oft the play for the
day.
The tournament will be resumed
tomorrow, if possible. All scores
will revert back to the 3G-hole to
tals.
Pace - setting Jerry Barber of
Pasadena shot a 73 today, one of the
best rounds recorded. He led the
field with a 54-hole score of 210.
Bruce McCormick of Hollywood,
one of the better amateurs, shot one

of his worst rounds of golf—a 90.
Practically all of the players de
manded cancellation. Barber, how
ever, played well and putted flaw
lessly. He shrugged his shoulders
when asked if he was disappointed
at the cancellation. He said he will
be on hand whenever play resumes.
The deciding factor in the com
mittee's decision was Hogan's ina
bility to ford a barranca (that's
Spanish for dry gulch) on the 11th.
The gully was running' with three
feet of water.
