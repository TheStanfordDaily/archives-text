The payoff to player I, i.e., the expected outcome for fixed pure strategies
of / and //, is then
v(i(x); z) = X [ w(.v, /(.v); z)dx. (J)

HOW TO CLEAN UP AT POKER—This is a page from a report on the great American indoor
sport, made by Dr. Richard Bellman, Stanford math professor, and Dr. David Blackwell, Howard
University mathematician. This little gem is here presented in the form of easily comprehensible
formulae. If properly clipped and prepared in the best cribnote form, it is guaranteed to improve
your luck in those all-night sessions.
