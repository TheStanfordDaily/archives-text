# Scientists Analyze Draw Poker
## 
### 
Trying to bluff at cards may
be a waste of effort—it might be
easier to relax and let the cards
do the bluffing for you.
This is what two mathemati
cians suggest after making a sci
entific study of two-handed po
ker in which they have reduced
the intangible element of bluff
ing to mathematical formulas.
They are Dr. Richard Bellman,
associate i rofessor of mathematics
at Stanford, and Dr. David Black
j well, head of the mathematics de
partment at Howard University.
Their study was conducted for
! the Rand Corporation of Santa
: Monica in a new branch of mathe
matics, the theory of games devel
oped by Dr. John von Neumann of
the Institute of Advanced Studies
: at Princeton.
Struggle for Existence
By looking into the methods men
| use to play such games as stud po
ker, mathematicians expect to come
| up with some new insights on man's
struggle for existence.
They believe that the theory of
games, with icertain modifications,
will be useful in explaining eco
nomic and business behavior—buy
ing, selling, investing, etc.
Dr. Bellman also said that the
theory is applicable to scientific ex
perimentation, if nature is regarded
as an adversary who conceals
knowledge from the investigator.
The researcher can by applying this
method determine the best way to
do his testing.
In their paper Dr. Bellman and
Dr. Blackwell deal only with a sim
plified poker game of two hands, but
they suggest that their study may
be applicable to common variations
of fhe game, which they plan to in
vestigate in the future.
Poker Strategy
The mathematicians divide poker
strategy into two categories and
term them "pure" and "mixed." The
player who uses a pure strategy
fohows a particular course oi ac
tion whenever ho receives certain
cards. The mixed strategist mixes

the available courses of action in
certain ways determined by the
cards he receives.
But actually only pure strategy is
needed in a continuous game. That
is, a mixed strategy of bluffing real
ly isn't necessary.
They explain it this way:
"In a continuous game, one al
lows the game, which furnishes a
random card, to do the bluffing. If
the cards are dealt at random (hon
estly and after fair shufflitv:), any
lurther randomization furnished by
bluffing is superfluous."
Cards lHuir
This doesn't mean there isn't any
bluffing, however. The player bluffs
uniformly by letting the cards do
the work. Here is an example:
Smith and Jones arc playing a
one-draw game, and each may even
know the other's strategy. What
Smith does not know is what cards
Jones draws, nor does Jones know
what cards Smith draws. These
drawn cards serve each player as a
bluff which is unsolvable and makes
any other bluffing unnecessary.
And if Smith, a bluffer, should
deviate from his strategy, Jones's
policy of letting the cards do the
work will automatically yield him
an even greater gain in the long
run.
There may be a time when out
right bluffing is advantageous, but
it is risky, and according to what
the mathematicians found in their
study, it is safer to let the pure
strategy do the work.
All this Dr. Bellman and Di.
Blackwell have reduced to mathe
matical formulas and charts which
show how the betting strategy
works, which is to some extent de
pendent on the size of the stakes.
