I .OS ANOi:iJ<;S I,os Angeles'
inajoi source of water will be cut !
off for at least 10 days, Water De
partment officials said today after j
surveying a spectacular, 75-foot
long break in the aqueduct which I
isirries water 250 miles here from i
thy Owens River.
The city won't suffer from lack of j
water, however, during repairs. A j
three-month supply is held in res- j
ervoirs here.
The millions of gallons which i
spurted from the break carved a I
river bed hundreds of feet wide and
several miles long as the water j
raced down to the desert floor.
