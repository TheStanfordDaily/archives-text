HEAVY SNOWS over the weekend have made the Squaw Valley
run more perfect for these three skiers. According to Asso- '
ciated Press, snow fell heavily in the Tahoe region Sunday and
put 18 inches of new snow on the ground at Donner Summit, i
However, Highways 40 and 50 into Nevada remained open. ,
Snowfall was heaviest in the Siskiyous. Overnight, Dunsmuir
got 20 inches; Mt. Shasta, 17 inches; and Weed, 12 inches. Traf
fic tieups and dangerous conditions slowed or halted motorists
on Highway 99 into Oregon and snow closed the road 30 miles

1 north of Redding. Further south the storm deposited two inches
J of snow in Lake County.
Temperatures warmed a bit in the coastal and interior sec
tions of California, but with a new storm blowing in, the Weather
Bureau forecast another period of abnormal cold and more snow.
Winter settled over most of the United States Sunday as well as
in California. Albany, N.Y., reported two degrees above zero,
Minneapolis —2, Duluth —4, and New York City was 16 above
zero, the record low for the year. Only the Florida Peninsula,
! where the mercury stood at a torrid 65, escaped the cold spell.
