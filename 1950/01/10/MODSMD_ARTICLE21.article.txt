# Rushees to Be Feted At Clubs, Fraternities
## Row to Hold Open Houses 
### 
Jockeying back and forth
among fraternity actives and po
tential pledges continued last
night as Row houses were pre
paring for the final open houses
tomorrow night from 7:15 to
9:15.
Nearly all of the 24 fraternities
reported the addition of a few new
pledges as they became better ac
quainted with the freshmen at. the
invitational dinners and luncheons.
Authorities in Encina said rush
ing chairmen were very much in
evidence in the hall most of the day.
Mrs. Ellene J. Sumner, Encina
resident director, said the same
practice, which was carried out last
year, would continue this year. That
is, any freshman men who are es
pecially interested in one of the fra
ternities, and who have not received
dinner invitations, can notify their
sponsors.
The sponsors will contact rushing
chairmen and the freshmen will get
every chance possible to visit the
house again. In the past this system
has worked well. It is a benefit to
both fraternities and freshmen, it
was felt, because many men were
overlooked in the mad scramble at
open houses.
