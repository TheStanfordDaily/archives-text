WASHINGTON The coal con

today wilh groups of miners going
out on strike in seven states and a
move starting in Congress to force
White House action.
John L. Lewis, whose three-day
work week for miners stirred the
uproar, fired back at those who have
been demanding government action.
Lewis said Senator Taft (R., Ohio)
and others who have been calling
on President Truman to invoke the
Taft-Hartley Law's national emer

press the mine workers and cripple
their union."
