Frosh May Join Any Time
Sarge Littlehale, president of In
ter-Club Council, pointed out that
no qualifications exist for future
members. Freshmen may join at
any time, regardless of grade-point
averages.
Eating club members have first
call on Toyon room priorities, as
each club is allotted a certain per
centage of rooms for new members
by the University Housing Commit
tee. Every eating club man was
able to get into Toyon last year.
However, residence at Toyon is
not required for membership. Many
off-campus men belong to clubs.
Littlehale said there is no formal
pledge period for new members.
"Each club handles rushing as it
sees fit, and the pledging is much
more informal than that conducted
by fraternities," he remarked.
The eating clubs expect to take in
about 75 new members in all. The
clubs average 24 members now, but
are increasing in size each year. The
pre-war average was 40 members
per club.
Important in Campus Life
The eating clubs at Stanford have
played a big role in campus life
for many years. Los Arcos, the
first club, was started just 11 years
after the opening of the University
Until the outbreak of World War
11, the clubs had their own build
ings, located in the area now occu
pied by the Toyon parking lot. Each
club had its separate dining room,
employed its own cook, and had a
lounge to itself.
These buildings were torn down
during the war, and today the clubs
aie limited to one of the large din
ing rooms at Encina Commons,
where they all eat together.
However, in the minds of club
members and University officials
alike, this set-up is only temporary,
"Our primary aim is still the new
building for eating clubs," Littlehale
said. "A special building report has
been tentatively approved by Uni
versity officials, and plans for the
new building are complete."
"But, the problem of financing
still remains the number one stum
bling block," he added. No formal
action has been taken on the build
ing yet.

Littlehale said there is no formal
pledge period for new members.
"Each club handles rushing as it
sees fit, and the pledging is much
more informal than that conducted
by fraternities," he remarked.
The eating clubs expect to take in
about 75 new members in all. The
clubs average 24 members now, but
are increasing in size each year. The
pre-war average was 40 members
per club.
Important in Campus Life
The eating clubs at Stanford have
played a big role in campus life
for many years. Los Arcos, the
first club, was started just 11 years
after the opening of the University
Until the outbreak of World War
11, the clubs had their own build
ings, located in the area now occu
pied by the Toyon parking lot. Each
club had its separate dining room,
employed its own cook, and had a
lounge to itself.
These buildings were torn down
during the war, and today the clubs
aie limited to one of the large din
ing rooms at Encina Commons,
where they all eat together.
However, in the minds of club
members and University officials
alike, this set-up is only temporary,
"Our primary aim is still the new
building for eating clubs," Littlehale
said. "A special building report has
been tentatively approved by Uni
versity officials, and plans for the
new building are complete."
"But, the problem of financing
still remains the number one stum
bling block," he added. No formal
action has been taken on the build
ing yet.
Rushing activities on campus tonight will center on the annual
open house sponsored by the Stanford eating clubs. Tonight's
open house will be held in the Toyon lounge from 7 to 9.
All seven Stanford clubs—Los Arcos, El Cuadro, El Capitan,
El Campo, El Toro, El Tigre, and Breakers—will have representa

tives there to meet men interested
in joining a club.
Any interested Stanfordite is in
vited to attend the informal affair
So that all prospective member*,
will have an equal chance to eat
with the different clubs, several of
the clubs will provide sign-up lists
for dinner dates. Other clubs will
handle rushing in various ways.
Frosh May Join Any Time
Sarge Littlehale, president of In
ter-Club Council, pointed out that
no qualifications exist for future
members. Freshmen may join at
any time, regardless of grade-point
averages.
Eating club members have first
call on Toyon room priorities, as
each club is allotted a certain per
centage of rooms for new members
by the University Housing Commit
tee. Every eating club man was
able to get into Toyon last year.
However, residence at Toyon is
not required for membership. Many
off-campus men belong to clubs.
