# Fettered Bruin
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily continues to enjoy al
most complete freedom of the press, as under
stood in this country, but some of our contem
poraries are not in so admirable a position.
Down at Cal's southern branch, UCLA, the
Bruin staff has lost the first round ol a battle to
be their own master. The Bruin seems to be
rapidly on its way toward that fate which news
papers in a totalitarian state often face.
To put it bluntly, the UCLA student news
paper has got into the position of having to take
orders from politicians, student variety, of
course.
The Bruin has always had to have their staff
appointments and promotions approved by the
student executive council. Until this year the
approval was of the rubber stamp variety, since
the paper submitted only one slate of candi
dates.
The SEC, as they call it down there, however,
recently passed a ruling which requires the
Bruin to submit at least two names for each po
sition open. The SEC then chooses, after inter
viewing the candidates.
As was expected, the first election in this
manner did not please the publications board.
Three candidates which publications board
wanted were thrown out in favor of SEC
lavored nominees.
The dangers ol this system are apparent im
mediately. In the first place, those not in the

journalism field and not connected with the
paper would have difficulty judging the quali
fications of the persons.
The SEC would also tend to want to put into
the top positions, men whom they knew would
carry out their will. And finally, the editors
would know they owed their election to the
student council, and prospective candidates
would be far more anxious to make a good per
sonal appearance before the politicos than to
do their job on the paper well.
The Stanford Daily, in contrast, elects its edi
tor and managing editor from candidates who
are nominated either by petition or because
they are appointed associate editors.
All other appointments are made by the edi
torial board. In an election only those staff
members may vote who have been on The
Daily three quarters. We think that our system
is immeasurably better than that the UCLA
newspaper enjoys.
We feel that a university is a place where
the ideal conditions in all fields should prevail
more than in any other situation.
If during our college life, we do not strive
lor the best of our democratic institutions, then
it seems to us that there is not much hope for
us when we face the added problems of the
"outside world."
We hope the Bruin can win the second and
final round of this battle for freedom of the
press. —M.K.

would be far more anxious to make a good per
sonal appearance before the politicos than to
do their job on the paper well.
The Stanford Daily, in contrast, elects its edi
tor and managing editor from candidates who
are nominated either by petition or because
they are appointed associate editors.
All other appointments are made by the edi
torial board. In an election only those staff
members may vote who have been on The
Daily three quarters. We think that our system
is immeasurably better than that the UCLA
newspaper enjoys.
We feel that a university is a place where
the ideal conditions in all fields should prevail
more than in any other situation.
If during our college life, we do not strive
lor the best of our democratic institutions, then
it seems to us that there is not much hope for
us when we face the added problems of the

We hope the Bruin can win the second and
final round of this battle for freedom of the
press. —M.K.
The Stanford Daily continues to enjoy al
most complete freedom of the press, as under
stood in this country, but some of our contem
poraries are not in so admirable a position.
Down at Cal's southern branch, UCLA, the
Bruin staff has lost the first round ol a battle to
be their own master. The Bruin seems to be
rapidly on its way toward that fate which news
papers in a totalitarian state often face.
To put it bluntly, the UCLA student news
paper has got into the position of having to take
orders from politicians, student variety, of
course.
The Bruin has always had to have their staff
appointments and promotions approved by the
student executive council. Until this year the
approval was of the rubber stamp variety, since
the paper submitted only one slate of candi
dates.
The SEC, as they call it down there, however,
recently passed a ruling which requires the
Bruin to submit at least two names for each po
sition open. The SEC then chooses, after inter
viewing the candidates.
As was expected, the first election in this
manner did not please the publications board.
Three candidates which publications board
wanted were thrown out in favor of SEC
lavored nominees.
The dangers ol this system are apparent im
mediately. In the first place, those not in the

journalism field and not connected with the
paper would have difficulty judging the quali
fications of the persons.
The SEC would also tend to want to put into
the top positions, men whom they knew would
carry out their will. And finally, the editors
would know they owed their election to the
student council, and prospective candidates
would be far more anxious to make a good per
sonal appearance before the politicos than to
do their job on the paper well.
