### BILL DAILEY 
Hey you!
Yeah, you sitting there in that nine o'clock lecture.
I want to talk to you. That's right, put down that pen
and notebook. C'mon, everything he's saying is in

the textbook, anyway. I've got
something more important to dis
cuss with you. That's it ... .
put away that pen .... hide
The Daily behind your notebook
. . . . Now listen.
Are you unhappy? Do you
sometimes contemplate commit
ting suicide by washing yourself
with Ponds and getting engaged
to death? You do? Well, you're
ia serious trouble.

But don't worry. I know what is bothering you.
Your trouble is that you are not taking the i ight major
subject. You don't know where you are going. What
you need is a little of that personal counseling from
your old Bull Sessioner.
Now here is what I am going to do for you. As a
student (sic) who has at one time been enrolled in
practically every department in this University, 1 am
going to offer you a little advice on choosing your own
major. Now isn't that swell of me?
Today, however, I am not going to give you the dope
on the different majors. That will come later in the
quarter. Each week I plan to tear down .... pardon
. . . . discuss .... one department. But today I am
going to pass on a few words of wisdom about one ol
those joyou.s things called "lower division require
ments."
Are you bitter because you were forced to take a
foreign language? You are? This is indeed a very

small attitude on your part. What you need to do is to
look beyond the surface and seek out the real reason
why you are required to take, say, French.
My operators have discovered that the real reason
why you are required to take French is so you will be
able to order intelligently at L'Ommie's.
In order that you may feel at ease when conversing
with Frenchmen, 1 am going to instruct you in a lew
of the most frequently used French idioms. The se
cret of the Bull Session Simplified French Course is
to say the idiom out loud and then figure oul the
English meaning from the sound.
All right, students:
lciiotti English Translation
(1) lie de France I'm sick of my friends.
(2) Les Miserables Latins are lousy lovers.
(3) Mal-de-mer Mom's sick.
(4) Allons Enfants de la Patrie
Come on, kids, let's go to a party.
(5) Pot dc creme Pour the cream.
(6) Frere Jacques
My brother's athletic supporter.
(7) Cherchez la femme Share the women.
(8) S'il ous plait No* Steiling.
(9) Carte Blanche
.. .Will someone please take Blanche home?
(10) Dumas fils I need a pedicure.
There you are: Now you can speak French. Or can
you? , . . .
NEXT WEEK: Dailey regurgitates and brings up
the question: "Why Take English.'

Now go back to that lecture, will ya. While you
were reading this baloney, your prof handed out a
ten-minute qui/.!
