BERKELEY, Jan. !) (/P)â€” After 1(1
years as bandmaster at University
of California, Charles C. Cushing
quit today with some bitter words
and nostalgic references.
Cushing declared that "certain
universities" have tinged their bands
with professionalism, and said he
could not go along with student de
mands for such operations al Cali
fornia.
"A show, spectacle, visual appeal,
and swing apparently Is what is
wanted. I have clung to the seem
ingly outmoded belief that a band is
a musicians' organization primarily."
The Daily Californian, student
newspaper, recently quoted Presi
dent Robert Gordon Sprout as com
menting: "The band smelts.'
Dr. Sproul denied this. He did say:
"Despite statements to the contrary,
I like the band, but 1 don't like the
mustard yellow trousers."
