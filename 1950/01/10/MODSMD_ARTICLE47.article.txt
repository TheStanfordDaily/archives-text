WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (/P) —
America's universities were told to
day to "get out of big-time colle

with the "Sanity Code."
President Karl E. Leib of the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion said, in an interview, that many
schools are "under the mistaken
impression they must have a big

admitted violators — four of which
are known to be Virginia, Virginia
Tech, VMI, and the Citadel—are ex
pelled the ruling collegiate athletic

dercover investigation to ferret out
all schools which are not comply
ing with the code throughout the
nation."
