## Plan Suggested for the Improvement Of Crowded Conditions in Encina Gym

That age-old Stanford problem that affects a good portion of the Farm
men—the crowded Eneina Gym conditions —are upon us again. Or rather,
should we say, the problem is greater now that winter quarter has arrived.
Every day from 1 to 6 p.m. the old Gym bulges and groans from the
efforts of over 100 men trying to play basketball on a court that was built
for 10. "
It has long been a custom of the players to use the cross-court baskets
rather than regular hoops. That puts 30 men in action, but it does little for
the 30 or 40 more that are waiting on the sidelines for their turn to play.
The sad part of the story is that their turn is a long time in coming—if at
all. So the average guy takes a sew snips at the basket while the teams are
on the other end of the court. He is joined by three or four men. Then three
or four take up similar play at the other basket. Soon there are 1(5 men
playing on one-third of a floor that is none too big to start' with. It's a sad
situation.
Small Chance for Improvement
And it is a situation that is not likely to get much better as time goes by.
The Pavilion is used by the varsity, Braves, and frosh. The average guy,
the fellow who just wants to get in an hour or so of practice a couple of
days a week will just have to suffer through until new facilities are made
ready. At the rate things are going, our grandchildren may someday play
in a new field house.
Until that time, the fellows who make use of the Encina Gym can do a
lot to make their playing time more enjoyable. I'm about to suggest a plan
that can help. It will work only if each and every player takes it upon him
self to take part.
It is just that when a cross-court game is going on, those waiting to play
gather in groups of five. The first five men waiting then have the option of
challenging the winners of any of the three games being played. The teams
so engaged will play to 30 points. Then the winner will take on the chal
lengers and the losers will drop back in line behind the other men waiting
to play.
It will take a pretty good pickup team to withstand the pressure of win
ning more than two or three of these games and thus the turnover will be
almost 100 per cent every half hour or so.
Success Depends on Player Co-operation
The success of this plan will take the wholehearted co-operation of every
man who plays in Encina Gym. It can work if it is given a chance. A few
diehards, a few selfish individuals can gum up the whole works. It is up to
the rest of the players to enforce the ruling.
As I said before, this is* not a new plan. It has been used before and has
died out only because it had no backing by the players.
It is a poor thing that a suggestion such as this should come from the
school paper. Rather the agency in charge of the Gym should enforce such
rules as to make for orderly play. But that is something we of Stanford
cannot expect. The Gym is in poor shape. One of the side baskets is hang
ing on only one bolt. Three or four of the ceiling lights do not work.
The sidelines are littered with unnecessary benches and mats that make
for dangerous play. It is not a satisfactory arrangement. The agency in
charge of the Gym, as well as the whole mural program, is of course the
office of one A 1 Masters.
That gentleman and or his assistants have been lax. A school the size of
Stanford should have a better setup for the average fellow who wants to
play ball.
Improper Policing
But we don't have the proper policing agency. The Gym is locked up on
Sunday when a lot of men would like to play. No basketballs are available
on Saturday afternoon. I can, and will, go on about this problem in the
future.
But now let's make the best use of what we have. Let's cut out this side
line play. The Gym is just not big enough. If we decide upon a plan such
as I have suggested more men will get to play without running into the
extras.
The Daily will welcomeietters to the editor or to this column suggesting
improvements- Tlip hard part about the übpve plan is that is has no policing
agency. I'm sure it will work if given a chance. But it is up to the men
who play to take it upon themselves to make it work. What about it?
Football Coaching Controversy
About the controversy that raged last quarter over the coaching staff.
. . . . The December 10 meeting of the SAC came to exactly nothing. After
three hours of talk the Stanford Athletic Council, which could have taken
no action anyway, decided to give the coaches a vote of confidence.
In the light of events up to that time, I think this was the wise thing to do.
The opinion was given in that meeting that student opinion was too tran
sient. It was thought that the matter would soon blow over. I think it has—
for this year.
But this writer will bet one Coke that the powers that be—from Masters
on down—will have some tall explaining to do if the Cards don't come
through next year. Cal, for one, loses 26 lettermen in 1950.
* * *
By the way .... Davey Field was awaded the game ball from the
"Pineapple Bowl." You'll remember that the little fellow (football speak
ing), scored his first touchdown for the Cardinal and White in three years
of play.

That age-old Stanford problem that affects a good portion of the Farm
men—the crowded Eneina Gym conditions —are upon us again. Or rather,
should we say, the problem is greater now that winter quarter has arrived.
Every day from 1 to 6 p.m. the old Gym bulges and groans from the
efforts of over 100 men trying to play basketball on a court that was built
for 10. "
It has long been a custom of the players to use the cross-court baskets
rather than regular hoops. That puts 30 men in action, but it does little for
the 30 or 40 more that are waiting on the sidelines for their turn to play.
The sad part of the story is that their turn is a long time in coming—if at
all. So the average guy takes a sew snips at the basket while the teams are
on the other end of the court. He is joined by three or four men. Then three
or four take up similar play at the other basket. Soon there are 1(5 men
playing on one-third of a floor that is none too big to start' with. It's a sad
situation.
Small Chance for Improvement
And it is a situation that is not likely to get much better as time goes by.
The Pavilion is used by the varsity, Braves, and frosh. The average guy,
the fellow who just wants to get in an hour or so of practice a couple of
days a week will just have to suffer through until new facilities are made
ready. At the rate things are going, our grandchildren may someday play
in a new field house.
Until that time, the fellows who make use of the Encina Gym can do a
lot to make their playing time more enjoyable. I'm about to suggest a plan
that can help. It will work only if each and every player takes it upon him
self to take part.
It is just that when a cross-court game is going on, those waiting to play
gather in groups of five. The first five men waiting then have the option of
challenging the winners of any of the three games being played. The teams
so engaged will play to 30 points. Then the winner will take on the chal
lengers and the losers will drop back in line behind the other men waiting
to play.
It will take a pretty good pickup team to withstand the pressure of win
ning more than two or three of these games and thus the turnover will be
almost 100 per cent every half hour or so.
Success Depends on Player Co-operation
The success of this plan will take the wholehearted co-operation of every
man who plays in Encina Gym. It can work if it is given a chance. A few
diehards, a few selfish individuals can gum up the whole works. It is up to
the rest of the players to enforce the ruling.
As I said before, this is* not a new plan. It has been used before and has
died out only because it had no backing by the players.
It is a poor thing that a suggestion such as this should come from the
school paper. Rather the agency in charge of the Gym should enforce such
rules as to make for orderly play. But that is something we of Stanford
cannot expect. The Gym is in poor shape. One of the side baskets is hang
ing on only one bolt. Three or four of the ceiling lights do not work.
The sidelines are littered with unnecessary benches and mats that make
for dangerous play. It is not a satisfactory arrangement. The agency in
charge of the Gym, as well as the whole mural program, is of course the
office of one A 1 Masters.
That gentleman and or his assistants have been lax. A school the size of
Stanford should have a better setup for the average fellow who wants to
play ball.
Improper Policing
But we don't have the proper policing agency. The Gym is locked up on
Sunday when a lot of men would like to play. No basketballs are available
on Saturday afternoon. I can, and will, go on about this problem in the
future.
But now let's make the best use of what we have. Let's cut out this side
line play. The Gym is just not big enough. If we decide upon a plan such
as I have suggested more men will get to play without running into the
extras.
The Daily will welcomeietters to the editor or to this column suggesting
improvements- Tlip hard part about the übpve plan is that is has no policing
agency. I'm sure it will work if given a chance. But it is up to the men
who play to take it upon themselves to make it work. What about it?
Football Coaching Controversy
About the controversy that raged last quarter over the coaching staff.
. . . . The December 10 meeting of the SAC came to exactly nothing. After
three hours of talk the Stanford Athletic Council, which could have taken
no action anyway, decided to give the coaches a vote of confidence.
In the light of events up to that time, I think this was the wise thing to do.
The opinion was given in that meeting that student opinion was too tran
sient. It was thought that the matter would soon blow over. I think it has—
for this year.
But this writer will bet one Coke that the powers that be—from Masters
on down—will have some tall explaining to do if the Cards don't come
through next year. Cal, for one, loses 26 lettermen in 1950.

By the way .... Davey Field was awaded the game ball from the
"Pineapple Bowl." You'll remember that the little fellow (football speak
ing), scored his first touchdown for the Cardinal and White in three years
of play.

That age-old Stanford problem that affects a good portion of the Farm
men—the crowded Eneina Gym conditions —are upon us again. Or rather,
should we say, the problem is greater now that winter quarter has arrived.
Every day from 1 to 6 p.m. the old Gym bulges and groans from the
efforts of over 100 men trying to play basketball on a court that was built
for 10. "
It has long been a custom of the players to use the cross-court baskets
rather than regular hoops. That puts 30 men in action, but it does little for
the 30 or 40 more that are waiting on the sidelines for their turn to play.
The sad part of the story is that their turn is a long time in coming—if at
all. So the average guy takes a sew snips at the basket while the teams are
on the other end of the court. He is joined by three or four men. Then three
or four take up similar play at the other basket. Soon there are 1(5 men
playing on one-third of a floor that is none too big to start' with. It's a sad
situation.
Small Chance for Improvement
And it is a situation that is not likely to get much better as time goes by.
The Pavilion is used by the varsity, Braves, and frosh. The average guy,
the fellow who just wants to get in an hour or so of practice a couple of
days a week will just have to suffer through until new facilities are made
ready. At the rate things are going, our grandchildren may someday play
in a new field house.
Until that time, the fellows who make use of the Encina Gym can do a
lot to make their playing time more enjoyable. I'm about to suggest a plan
that can help. It will work only if each and every player takes it upon him
self to take part.
It is just that when a cross-court game is going on, those waiting to play
gather in groups of five. The first five men waiting then have the option of
challenging the winners of any of the three games being played. The teams
so engaged will play to 30 points. Then the winner will take on the chal
lengers and the losers will drop back in line behind the other men waiting
to play.
It will take a pretty good pickup team to withstand the pressure of win
ning more than two or three of these games and thus the turnover will be
almost 100 per cent every half hour or so.
Success Depends on Player Co-operation
The success of this plan will take the wholehearted co-operation of every
man who plays in Encina Gym. It can work if it is given a chance. A few
diehards, a few selfish individuals can gum up the whole works. It is up to
the rest of the players to enforce the ruling.
As I said before, this is* not a new plan. It has been used before and has
died out only because it had no backing by the players.
It is a poor thing that a suggestion such as this should come from the
school paper. Rather the agency in charge of the Gym should enforce such
rules as to make for orderly play. But that is something we of Stanford
cannot expect. The Gym is in poor shape. One of the side baskets is hang
ing on only one bolt. Three or four of the ceiling lights do not work.
The sidelines are littered with unnecessary benches and mats that make
for dangerous play. It is not a satisfactory arrangement. The agency in
charge of the Gym, as well as the whole mural program, is of course the
office of one A 1 Masters.
That gentleman and or his assistants have been lax. A school the size of
Stanford should have a better setup for the average fellow who wants to
play ball.
Improper Policing
But we don't have the proper policing agency. The Gym is locked up on
Sunday when a lot of men would like to play. No basketballs are available
on Saturday afternoon. I can, and will, go on about this problem in the
future.
But now let's make the best use of what we have. Let's cut out this side
line play. The Gym is just not big enough. If we decide upon a plan such
as I have suggested more men will get to play without running into the
extras.
The Daily will welcomeietters to the editor or to this column suggesting
improvements- Tlip hard part about the übpve plan is that is has no policing
agency. I'm sure it will work if given a chance. But it is up to the men
who play to take it upon themselves to make it work. What about it?
Football Coaching Controversy
About the controversy that raged last quarter over the coaching staff.
. . . . The December 10 meeting of the SAC came to exactly nothing. After
three hours of talk the Stanford Athletic Council, which could have taken
no action anyway, decided to give the coaches a vote of confidence.
In the light of events up to that time, I think this was the wise thing to do.
The opinion was given in that meeting that student opinion was too tran
sient. It was thought that the matter would soon blow over. I think it has—
for this year.
But this writer will bet one Coke that the powers that be—from Masters
on down—will have some tall explaining to do if the Cards don't come
through next year. Cal, for one, loses 26 lettermen in 1950.
* * *
By the way .... Davey Field was awaded the game ball from the
"Pineapple Bowl." You'll remember that the little fellow (football speak
ing), scored his first touchdown for the Cardinal and White in three years
of play.
