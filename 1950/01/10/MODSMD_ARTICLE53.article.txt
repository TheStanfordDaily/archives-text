# Hogan Fires 69 to Move Up in Los Angeles Open
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9 (/P) —
Tournament pressure hit dark- (
horse Jerry Barber, and the sun and |
Ben Hogan got buck on the beam
today in the $15,000 Los Angeles
Open.
Setting the stage for a hectic j
finale tomorrow in the 24th edition I
of the Los Angeles fixture, Barber
remained on top of the field but the
ominous shadow of Battling Ben,
his come - back campaign in high
gear, loomed dangerously close be
hind.
Barber, a 33 - year - old pro from
Pasadena, went over par for the
first time in the tournament • and
wound up with a one-over 72 for a
third-round total of 209.
Hogan opened his bag of golf
magic and out popped a sub-par 69
and a total of 211, a scant two shots |
j back of Barber.
Hogan, looking strong and rested,
I clipped three strokes off pur on the
I first nine, bagging three birdies. His

irons were beautifully executed.
! One approach left him with a sev
-1 en-inch approach for a birdie, an
i other died just seven feet from the
j cup. He got both shots down.
But Hogan began to show signs
| of leg weariness on the back nine.
! And Lady Luck gave him several
j bad digs, too. He lost a stroke to par
I with a tee shot that landed under a
I bush on the tenth. He three-putted
| the fourteenth and fifteenth holes,
I missing an 18-inch putt on the for
| mer. Just before that, one of his
j putts curled into the cup for a bir
die, and then curled out. He got
two birdies on the trip in, however,
canning seven-foot putts in each in-
I stance. •
