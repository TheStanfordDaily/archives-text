# New York International House May Serve As Model for Similar Institution on Farm
## 
### 
Stanford students have for several
years been doing research on In
ternational House projects. They
have done this mainly to investigate
the possibilities of eventually estab
lishing a Stanford "I" House.
While any concrete plans for an
International House here must of
necessity be left for future student
bodies, the Stanford "I" House
Committee has discovered a great
deal about the movement.
The first of the four largest and
most famous international houses
was built in New York in 1924 with
a gift of money from John D.
Rockefeller Jr. The history of the

movement goes back to 1910.
On an autumn morning of that
year near the Columbia University
campus a man's cheerful disposition
prompted him to say good morning
to a passing Chinese student. The
Chinese student stopped Harry Ed
monds, the man who spoke to him,
and said: "Do you know that you
are the first person who has greeted
me in the three weeks I have been
in New York?"
Edmonds invited the student and
several students from other foreign
nations, also studying in New York,
to dinner at his home that Sunday.
This was the beginning of the Sun
day suppers which were to become
a tradition in the Edmonds home
and which grew into the Intercolle
giate Cosmopolitan Club and the In
ternational House.
The Intercollegiate Cosmopolitan
C!ub, which was formed when the
Sunday evening gatherings became
too large for the Edmonds home,
held their suppers at Earl Hall, Co
lumbia University. They added a
musical program and an after-din
ner speaker.
To quote an article from the 1944
International House quarterly, "As
the ICC grew, an idea took hold of
the members. . . . They had watched
differences among individuals fade
into the background when common
interests emerged. ... As those
interested saw these things, they
dreamed of the richer understand
ing that might glow among nations
if the students, the future leaders

of different lands, had an opportu
nity to live under one roof."
The students and Harry Edmonds j
went to work on the idea and even
tually succeeded in interesting John
D. Rockefeller Jr. In 1923 he pre
sented the Intercollegiate Cosmo
politan Club with a piece of land on
Riverside Drive and $3 million to
build and equip a home for the club.
The building, which houses over i
500 graduate students from all na
tions—about a third of them from
the United States —was completed
in 1924 and became the first of four
International Houses built through
Rockefeller philanthropy.
Besides the Sunday suppers, still
the central social activity of all |
three houses, there are many edu- j
cational and "just fun" activities.
The big event of the year at the '
New York house is the Halloween |
party. This combines an old-fash- I
ioned American Halloween affair |
of apples, candy, nuts, masquer- j
aders, and spooks with a miniature I
world's fair.
The entire center of the house— ,
lounges, meeting rooms, cafeteria, j
and gymnasiums, is thrown open.
One might find a Hawaiian hula 1
dance going on next door to a j
performance of the Floradora Girls |
or a Chinese play.
Details of programs at the other i
three International Houses in Chi
cago, Berkeley, and Paris will be j
described in subsequent Daily ar- I
tides.

and said: "Do you know that you
are the first person who has greeted
me in the three weeks I have been
in New York?"
Edmonds invited the student and
several students from other foreign
nations, also studying in New York,
to dinner at his home that Sunday.
This was the beginning of the Sun
day suppers which were to become
a tradition in the Edmonds home
and which grew into the Intercolle
giate Cosmopolitan Club and the In
ternational House.
The Intercollegiate Cosmopolitan
C!ub, which was formed when the
Sunday evening gatherings became
too large for the Edmonds home,
held their suppers at Earl Hall, Co
lumbia University. They added a
musical program and an after-din
ner speaker.
To quote an article from the 1944
International House quarterly, "As
the ICC grew, an idea took hold of
the members. . . . They had watched
differences among individuals fade
into the background when common
interests emerged. ... As those
interested saw these things, they
dreamed of the richer understand
ing that might glow among nations
if the students, the future leaders

of different lands, had an opportu
nity to live under one roof."
The students and Harry Edmonds j
went to work on the idea and even
tually succeeded in interesting John
D. Rockefeller Jr. In 1923 he pre
sented the Intercollegiate Cosmo
politan Club with a piece of land on
Riverside Drive and $3 million to
build and equip a home for the club.
The building, which houses over i
500 graduate students from all na
tions—about a third of them from
the United States —was completed
in 1924 and became the first of four
International Houses built through
Rockefeller philanthropy.
Besides the Sunday suppers, still
the central social activity of all |
three houses, there are many edu- j
cational and "just fun" activities.
The big event of the year at the '
New York house is the Halloween |
party. This combines an old-fash- I
ioned American Halloween affair |
of apples, candy, nuts, masquer- j
aders, and spooks with a miniature I
world's fair.
The entire center of the house— ,
lounges, meeting rooms, cafeteria, j
and gymnasiums, is thrown open.
One might find a Hawaiian hula 1
dance going on next door to a j
performance of the Floradora Girls |
or a Chinese play.
Details of programs at the other i
three International Houses in Chi
cago, Berkeley, and Paris will be j
described in subsequent Daily ar- I
tides.
Stanford students have for several
years been doing research on In
ternational House projects. They
have done this mainly to investigate
the possibilities of eventually estab
lishing a Stanford "I" House.
While any concrete plans for an
International House here must of
necessity be left for future student
bodies, the Stanford "I" House
Committee has discovered a great
deal about the movement.
The first of the four largest and
most famous international houses
was built in New York in 1924 with
a gift of money from John D.
Rockefeller Jr. The history of the

movement goes back to 1910.
On an autumn morning of that
year near the Columbia University
campus a man's cheerful disposition
prompted him to say good morning
to a passing Chinese student. The
Chinese student stopped Harry Ed
monds, the man who spoke to him,
and said: "Do you know that you
are the first person who has greeted
me in the three weeks I have been
in New York?"
