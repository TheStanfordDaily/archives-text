# Nature's Acts Threaten China's Teeming Millions
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Each year, either flood or drought
takes its toll from the Chinese
farmers. Thousands are killed and
millions rendered homeless. Be it
flood or drought, it always means
misery and suffering for China's
countless millions. These arch-ene
mies of mankind come with unerr
ing regularity, snuffing out the lives
of some and rearranging the desti
nies of others.
Many farmers, with their crops
ruined by the lack of water or too
much water, wander into the cities
in search of employment. But for
people with scruples, it is not easy
to earn a living in China. Even for
those without any scruples, life is
hard. Consequently, for many men
who are too honest to turn to lives
of crime, there is only one alterna
tive —death.
When I was in Canton, I be
friended a young farmer who used
to bring eggs and vegetables to my
home. His name was Ah Chor. I
liked that fellow. He was intelli
gent and always eager to learn.
Whenever he came to my house
with his produce, he would ask me
to teach him a word or two of Eng
lish. Before I left Canton, I gave
him my address in Hong Kong and
promised him that if he should ever
go to Hong Kong, I would help him
find a job.
Floods and Disaster
A'most a year went by, and then
one day, I found Ah Chor at my
door. The floods of 1948 had ruined
his farm. He had come to Hong
Kong to look for employment. I got
to work trying to find him a job,
but I was unsuccessful. Ah Choi
was not the only one affected by the
floods. Farmers and their families
had flocked to Hong Kong. Every
body wanted jobs.
A week went by, and Ah Choi
was still without a job. Realizing
that his funds must be running
short, I gave him twenty dollars and
told him to keep checking with me
every couple of days. Ah Chor ac
cepted the money very reluctantly,
but he never came back. I did not
know what had happened to him
until two weeks later, when I was
on a routine ca!l at the morgue. I
saw Ah Chor's body there. He had
drowned himself.
China is full of tragedies like Ah
Choi's — tragedies which go unno
ticed in a country where human life
is cheap. The tragedy of Ah Choi
might well have been just a para

graph in the local papers stating j
that the police had found the body \
of an unidentified young man in the :
harbor. It might even have been too
unimportant to appear in the pa
pers.
Other Tragedies
But there are other kinds of trag
edies, too. The lives of the women
i who are found standing at street
j corners late at night and the lives
! of the women in the brothels are
I tragedies. Few people have ever
bothered to ask them why they are
there. If they did, they might have
I heard some moving tales.
I have spoken to many of these
j women; women who are bullied by
policemen and made fun of by street
urchins. I have spoken to some of
the most notorious ones, and I have
i spoken to some who were only
fourteen cr fifteen years of age. I
have seen the conditions under
which they existed, and I have
j heard the tales they have to tell.
Many of them told me they were
forced to lead lives of prostitution
J because of misfortunes caused by
j either floods or famines.
Their lives are but a small frac- j
I tion of the suffering caused by j
1 floods and droughts in China. In a j
I country that has been torn by civil I
j war for so many years, little attcn- l
I tion has been paid to flood control
and water conservation projects.!
| Most of the farmers are not enter- j
j taining hopes of any improvement;
of their lot under the Communists,
but to them, the Communist vie- j
tory at least meant peace.
