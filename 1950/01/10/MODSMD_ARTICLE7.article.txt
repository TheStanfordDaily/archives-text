# March of Dimes Needs Your Help
## 
### 
The 1950 March of Dimes to help
i light infantile paralysis is under
way. The appeal for help has never
been so urgent, said Basil O'Con
nor, president of the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.
The polio epidemics of 1949 struck
more victims in the United States
i than in any one year in any country
in the history of the world. A quar
i ter of the -10.000 cases were in the
college age group. The toll has
i never been so staggering, with cases
; reported in two summer* months
| quadrupling what was once consid
! ercd the normal total for an entire
j year.
Patient care alone demanded
j some $31,000.000 in 1949, O'Connor
j estimated. This was more money
j than was contributed to the 1949
i March of Dimes. He added that
I continuing care may cost the Na
: tional Foundation over $20,000,000.
I in addition to the cases this' ypar
I may bring in.
Over HO per cent of those afflicted
, lust year were helped entirely or in
i part by March of Dimes funds. Dur
ing epidemic heights, slop-gap aid
' was sent to stricken areas at the
: rate of $1.00,000 a day. Meeting all
1 demands wiped out treasuries of
| Nationa' Foundation chapters in all
i lint, five slates.
Foundation President O'Connor
| emphasized the need for financing
extensive research and educational
j programs. The March of Dimes in
! almost 12 years has extended grants
| of $10,990,884 for training experts in
! modern polio techniques.
March of Dimes supports (>8 dif-
I ferent studies covering all phases of
] infantile paralysis. When the prc.s
-i out studies of the virus responsible
, for this disease arc complete, sci
. entisls will be ready to produce
a trial vaccine against all known
; types of polio.
Polio strikes hardest at children
under ten, but the incidence of ihc
I disease has risen sharply among
adults. Support of almost .'>,ooo Na
tional Foundation chapters, and
, continued research as a bulwark
against future epidemics, should be
a growing concern of college stu
dents. Only redoubled efforts in
the 1950 March of Dimes will enable
j the Foundation to carry on the
I campaign against polio.
