Judging from her highly success
ful memoirs, Miss Skinner is a pro
found victim of modern civilization
and the machine. If she isn't match
ing cunning with a pull-down bed
on a transcontinental train, she is
probably fencing interview ques
tions with a high school newspaper
reporter. The high school reporter
problem, however, she has finally
solved. Now, when asked about her
favorite hobby, she replies, "I have
diverted a body of water (the Kill
Van Kull) through my Long Island
I propyl i»' Aid (hi • 1 n h.tp iil

by the stream, all summer long,
weaving panama hats under water."
"This," says Miss Skinner, "stops
'cm every time."
On a recent trip to Hollywood,
Miss Skinner and her side-kick col
laborator, Emily Kimbrough, alight
j ed into the arms of a horde of re
porters and photographers. Accord
ing to the story, the girls immedi
ately smiled and struck a modest
pose, when they were shattered by
i the question:
"Say, ladies," inquired one re
porter pleasantly, "have you seen
; Joe Louis? He's on the train nnd
|w ' enmc .lowu to fnt a story."
