## 
### 
Toyon lounge, like Stanford Pa
vilion, was hard pressed to handle
the crowd last night.
The attraction was the annual
eating club open house, which each
year marks the start of the informal
rushing period conducted by the
clubs. Rushing will continue for the
next few weeks, with each club
handling its pledging as it sees fit.
Officials of the Inter-Club Coun
cil, sponsors of the affair, said the
crowd of interested students who
visited Toyon during the evening
was much larger than anticipated.
"We were greatly pleased to see
such a large bunch of fellows turn
out," remarked Council president
Sarge Littlehale. "I'm sure that the
clubs will be unanimous in saying
that tonight's open house was a
great success."
All seven of Stanford's clubs had
representatives on hand to greet
students and offer invitations,
through sign -up lists, to cfinner
with their clubs. Many clubrf also
handed out invitations to other af
fairs, so that interested men could
get a further chance to meet with
them.
Any frosh who was not able to
attend last night's open house may

"All that is necessary is to notny
wing sponsors," he said. The spon
sors will get in touch with club
rushing chairmen who will see that
invitations are handed out to all
who want them."
The eating clubs are still forced
to limit membership because of
their cramped eating quarters in
Encina Commons. However, Little
hale said that about 75 new mem
bers would probably be pledged.
