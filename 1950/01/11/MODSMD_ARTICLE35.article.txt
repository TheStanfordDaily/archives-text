"Why don't you park your car in the middle
of the road next time?" read an anonymous note
stuck behind the windshield wiper of our car,
which was parked in the triangular parking lot
between the Bookstore and Stern Hall.
Unfortunately, the front of the car was in the
lane, or aisle, just fur enough to block traffic
headed for the exit. At eight o'clock it had been
in line with cars then parked there, but by after
noon those cars were gone and a new line had
formed several yards back.
The Library and Education parking lots avoid
problems of this sort by the use of white paint.
Hut the newer lot has a cheaper type of gravel
pavement which cannot well be painted.
When the lot was constructed, parking lines
arid lanes were marked with a chalky sub

stance, like yard lines on a football field. But
these soon wore ofl or were washed away.
Now theje are no lines, and no lanes—just cars,
often scattered about with little semblance of
order. Weaving around cars to get in or out is
difficult and occasionally impossible.
The situation can be corrected without too
much difficulty. If paint is impossible, because
of the type of surfacing, we suggest that logs
of some sort be used to separate the rows of
cars. These logs would serve as a curb to
keep the lines straight.
One of the purposes in paving the lot was to
prevent cars from getting stuck there because
of the mud. It seems unfortunate that cars oc
casionally still get "stuck" there, if only tem
rounded by other cars. —M.H.
