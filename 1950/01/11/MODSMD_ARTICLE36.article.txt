# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Emptying the Mississippi River out of my pockets,
I walked into The Daily Shack yesterday afternoon,
and decided immediately that what this column needs
is a good five-cent survey on the habits and customs

of students at Stanford.
It was a very convenient de
rision, seeing as how I happened
to have in my possession at this
time just such a survey. Said
survey was compiled last quarter
by an industrious group of stu
in a class called Hygiene 50.
Realizing at first glance that
this study was just exactly what
the student body has been waiting
for, I humbly turn it over to you
us of now—with a few ad-lib re-

marks rubbed in.
The questions concern drinking, smoking, studying,
and dating and, excitingly enough, weiv answered by
both females and males.
Several interesting answers were turned in, and
would undoubtedly be good enough to warrant a
whole Bull Session of their own, but like the header's
Digest, we'll condense.
First of all, Stanford females drink more than
Stanford males, or at least, more females drink. The
actual rundown was 95 per cent to 84.
(This conclusion could be backed up by a statement
overheard recently out in front of CuLberley at 2 in
thf- morning—"Man, she was so loaded they had to
carry her upstairs in a freight elevator.")
Official word was that mixed drinks were favored

over beer by a 48.5 to 29.5 margin, but don't spread
around out at Rossott's—they might laugh at you.
Getting away from drink—which is a lot more dif
ficult than it sounds—we fmd that once again the
women outclass the men. This time, in smoking the
figures reading 86.2 to 74.3. Perry Como won't like
it, but the smokers prefer Camels, Luckies, and Philip
Morris, in that order.
The studying part of the survey was sort of dull, as
that type of thing usually is, so I'll whip right past it
and on to u more fertile field dating.
This part I'll give to you straight:
Petting:
Males Females
Yes 83 3
Sometimes 7 28
No 10 G9
The only thing that can be figured here is that 09
per cent of somebody must be calling something by
some other name.
Finally, it was pointed out that the number of dates
per month ran from 2\'-i for the males to V-> for the
femmes.
Of course, the Roble girls must have pulled the aver
age way down, or eLse the average would have been
29 times per month for the women.
Oh well, like they say on the street, it never rains
but it pours.
Or, like noe girl said about her friend, "Goodness,
she certainly has a lot of boy-friends," and was told
"Goodness, honey, had nothing to do with it."
That's hall, brother.
