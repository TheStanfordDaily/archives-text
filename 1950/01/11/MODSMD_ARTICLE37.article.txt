## UCLA Daily Bruin 
### 
To the Editor:
A recent Daily editorial, entitled "Fettered Bruin,"
decried the fact that appointments and promotions of
the staff of the UCLA newspaper ha.s been removed
irom the staff's sole control. Apparently the staff may
no longer appoint its own successors, but must submit
at two names for each open position for selection
I y elected representatives of the .student body. This
move is referred to by the editorialist as totalitarian,
undemocratic, and abridging the freedom of the press.
Admitting that student officers may no! always truly
represent all of their constituents, nevei theless, after
having read the UCLA Bruin for four years, I sug
gest:
I. It is a step away from totalitarianism to take sole
power of appointment from lhe hands of a hierarchy

perpetuating its own ideas, Those desiring to obtain
promotions or positions on the UCLA newspaper need
no longer depend solely on the approval of their ideas
by a controlling clique.
2. It is a step toward democracy to give the students,
through their elected representatives, a voice in what
lire policy shall be in the newspaper which owes its
existence to them.
To date our Daily has done a commendable job of
presenting fairly the opposing sides of issues of stu
dent interests. The same cannot be said for the UCLA
paper, which has been too often one-sided.
It would appear that the situation criticized in The
Daily editorial, a move away from perpetuated uni
lateral expression of ideas, is a move toward freedom
of ideas. In effect, the "Bruin" which counts, the
UCLA student, is now less fettered.
