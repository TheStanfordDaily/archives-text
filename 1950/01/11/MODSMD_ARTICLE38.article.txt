## 
### 
Nasser Jehanbani, 27-year-old |
â–  elf designated Iranian prince and
former Stanford student, is faced |
with deportation to his homeland.
Jehanbani has been viewed by j
Stanford associates as an "Iranian i
version of a Kentucky colonel" for '
his way of living.
Fred Wyckoff, San Mateo County ,
assistant district attorney, said to
day that Jehanbani faces possible |
deportation after he answers for bad
checJus he has passed.
The former Stanford graduate stu
dent. late Monday was convicted of
three bad check charges. A jury in
the superior court of Judge Murray
Draper took ~nly 35 minutes to re
turn verdietb .A guilty.
Wyckoff said that the three counts
involved checks totaling $2,777.
However, the prosecutor claimed,
Jehanbarn's total receipts from rub
ber checks amounted to about $10,-
000. Wyckoff said that Jehanbani
gave bad checks to about 17 persons,
including one $1,600 check to A. Irv
ing Levo r sen, dean of the Stanford
School of Mineral Sciences.
Since Jehanbani left Stanford on |
January 1, 1949, he has been lectur
ing in the Bay Area and on the Mon- !
terey Peninsula on the history and
geography of Iran.

His father, Clen. M. 11. Jehanbani,
former Iranian war minister, last
j month wrote to his son's creditors,
| disclaiming any responsibility for
debts incurred by him. The father
also wrote the creditors that it would

be no use "writing to the king" since
the latter was aware of the situation.
Jehanbani specifically was found
guilty of giving a $2,G00 bad check to
Tom Chapman, San Bruno automo
bile distributor. WyckofT said the
check was post-dated to secure a
luun, and that Jehanbani also put up
his car for security. The check, how
ever, bounced, and Chapman found
the car was encumbered because of
other debts.
The other two counts were for
checks totaling $177 which Jehan
bani gave to Edward M. Elliott, Stan
for senior and operator of the Union
Store at Menlo School and College.
Elliott testified that he received
seven bad checks totaling $2,0.*>2 over
a two-year period.
Jehanbani, who gave his address
as Monterey, will be sentenced on
January 23 by Judge Draper. The
Iranian asked that he be allowed
freedom pending sentence because of
ill health, but the judge ordered him
locked up at the County jail.
