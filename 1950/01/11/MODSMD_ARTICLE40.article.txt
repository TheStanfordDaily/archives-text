# Need Atheist on Roundtable
## 
### 
The weekly Stanford Student
Roundtable, produced each week by
the lIR, plans to produce a religious
program in a few weeks tentatively
titled "Is Religion Necessary to the
College Student?" Charles Schweisso
and Dr. Paul C. Johnston, Univer
sity chaplain are scheduled to appear
on the program with the Round
table's regular moderator, George
Velliotes.
When asked why an atheist was
being sought for the show, Velliotes
answered that such an individual, if
sincere, would be a representative
voice on the program of the many
college students who do not attend
church. He added quickly, however,
"If we can't find our atheist, we
might settle foi an aggressive ag
nostic."
