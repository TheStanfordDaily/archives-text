# Lagunita Holds Clothing Drive for Austria Town
## 
### 
This week Lagunila Court is holding a drive to collect clothing
to send to a village in Austria, St.-Johann-in-Pengau. The A-Fair,
which was held fall quarter 1948, also contributed toward helping
this village.
The proceeds from the A-Fair are doing wonders in St. Johann,
reports from that town say. The par-

eels sent are distributed by Bishop
sent over are distributed by Bishop
Timotheos and Sister Lore to the vil
lagers. To show their appreciation
they sent Lagunita a box of articles
contributed by the people of St. .Jo
hann.
Recently Marjorie Railt, Stanford
graduate of 1949, visited St. Johann
and wrote a letter about the village
to Lagunita's overseas relief com
mittee. Here, in part, is what she
said: (
Good Done
"In this letter I shall attempt to
tell you of the good Lagunita had
done in one place in Europe
I hope that word of the success of
this project will encourage you to
continue your support
"St. Johann is a small village at
ihe foot of the Alps You
would be surprised to see how many
have been aided in some way by the
work Lagunita has done.
"I could tell you of the many peo
ple who came to thank me, for you;
for the things they had received from
you. Some came miles by foot just
to express their gratitude I
feel it is my duty to let you know
what a great deal the lew hours we
spent collecting and packing have
meant
Stanford Rest
"One instance which made me stop
and think was when one lady visited
me, wearing her best clothes Stan
ford clothe::. The article of which
she was the most proud was her
blouse. She beamed with pleasure

when I admired it. She'll never
know it was the top of a Lagunita
girl's pajamas â€” that could be the
basis of a joke, but it was one of the
most pitiful things I have ever seen.
I learned much in the two weeks I
btayed in St. Johann!"
Lagunita has sent many food pack
ages and packages of clothing col
lected from the girls to St. Johann.
The clothing collected in this week's
drive will also be sent to this Aus
trian village.
