# NSA Leader Answers Often-Heard Question: 'Why Is There a National Student Association?'
## 
### DICK KELTON 
A National Student Association
exists, but why?
Probably every one of the few
students who know what the ini
tials NSA indicate, has wondered
consciously or semi-consciously or
perhaps just unconsciously, "Why is
there a National Student Associa
tion of over a million students?"
Sometimes the questions have
been answered in vulgar negative,
"Let's get rid of the blasted thing";
sometimes in the sophisticated neu
tral, "Well, it makes them happy
let them play"; and even occasion
ally in the naive affirmative, "It's a
good idea; why don't more people
actively participate in and support
NSA?"
United Student Community
It is the self-confessed purpose
of this article to answer the ques
tion, "Why is there a National Stu
dent Association?" in the hope of
increasing the incidence of the "oc
casional affirmative" reaction. In
the famous last words of the coun
terfeiter: When one believes in the
value of something he is sure that
all other people will have a similar
estimate of the object.
NSA exists to unite and represent
the student community. This com
munity transcends the limits of any
individual campus. Its existence is
shown by such incidents as the
Stanford Daily's interest in the
problems of the UCLA paper, as
Stanford's support of the University
of Naples, and the student govern
ment's drawing upon the experi
ence of other schools in the drafting
of a Faculty Rating System.
This student community has simi
lar interests and desires that have
as their common denominator the
fact that all the component parts
are students. How to finance an ed
ucation when one is not economi
cally productive; how to secure the
best possible education for future
needs; how to maintain freedom of
expression in the new environment
of the college community—all are
problems faced by students regard
less of their university.
Educational Exchange
NSA serves this student commu
nity in many ways—by helping it
secure an interchange of informa
tion; by providing the medium for
students to help themselves, both

economically through the purchase
card system, and culturally through
a national student literary maga
zine, art contest, and ticket ex
changes; and by representing the
common interests of the student
community to the larger educational
community and the nation as a
whole. Through the NSA, American
students are represented in such di
verse organizations as the World
Student Service Fund, the National
Education Association, and UNES
CO.
The educational process is dy
namic. Today educators, students,
and laymen are all re-examining
the educational process to insure
that it represents the most effective
means of producing good and useful
citizens. Through the NSA the stu
dents are claiming their justifiable
part in molding the nature of the
educational process.
Common Interests Represented
Thus NSA's purpose is to repre
sent students in such fields as aca
demic freedom, cultural activity,
student rights, and economic con
sideration for students.
In a republic the individual often
becomes insignificant in the mech
anized representative system. Amer
ica has realized the necessity of
people with common interests and
desires uniting to help themselves
realize those desires. From the Re
publican party, through the Salva
tion Army, to the Women's Chris
tian Temperance Union, like-mind
ed individuals have formed organi
zations to represent opinions they
hold in common.
The people in those organizations
don't hold every belief in common.
Among students, for example, one
finds Republicans and Democrats,
the religious and the atheists, tee
totalers and highball totalers. But
those problems which have as their
common denominator participation
as a student in an educational com
munity find students in general
agreement.

The National Student Association
| is the students' exercise of their
j democratic right to organize for
self-help and the representation of
: the interests which students have in
' common. The necessity, in our
complex society, for the unification
of people with similar problems and
i aspirations is the reason why there
! is an NSA.
