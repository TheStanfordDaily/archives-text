# Malik Walks Out
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS â€”Russia's Jakob
A. Malik angrily walked out of the
UN Security Council today because
the other delegates would not kitk
out Nationalist China's delegation.
In a parting shot, the Soviet Dep
uty Foreign Minister said lie would
not come back as long as the Na
tionalists sat at the council table.
Malik said meetings with the Na
tionalists present would be a par
ody and that chief Nationalist Del
egate T. F. Tsiang, presiding as Jan
uary chairman over the first Coun
cil meeting this year, "represents
nobody,"
