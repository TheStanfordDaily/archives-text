## Card Mittmen, Groaners Face Bears at Berkeley Friday Eve 
### JOE CUSICK 
Two Novice Boxing Tournament
champions will make their varsity
debuts Friday night at 8 in Califor
nia's gym when Ray Lunny's fistic
warriors open their season.
The nine-bout card will be fea
tured simultaneously with wres
tling matches between Cal and
Stanford.
Jack Bickel, who won the middle
weight mural crown in last Decern
j ber's tourney, is now in the 175-lb.
j light-heavyweight bracket, and will
; fight Friday evening.
Lunny hasn't yet decided who
j wi'l meet Cal's 220-1 b. heavyweight.
Paxton Beale. but he will choose
between two novice champs, Don
' Enberg anid Dave Oberlin.
Both Champs
Enberg won the light-heavy and
| Oberlin the heavyweight crown in
the novice tourney. Athough Enberg
appears to have the edge in con
ditioning right now, the heavier
Oberlin will most likely get the cajl
against Beale. Dave weighs in at
i around 195, while Enberg tips the

| scales at 175.
Bickel has progressed rapidly
since first turning out for boxing
I and uses his straight - punching,
| (lard-hitting style to advantage.
Impressive in Tourney
Enberg has been termed the most ,
| impressive fighter to come out of |
I the Novice Tournament. He has a (
' punch like a heavyweight j;o he will
not find himself at a loss if chosen |
| to fight Friday.
Enberg, under the direction of

Coach Lunny, has been working on |
his style and footwork since the be- j
ginning of the quarter, and may j
become more of a boxer in the fu
ture. His tourney record speaks for '
itself: two knockouts and a TKO.
Only Heavyweight
Dave Oberlin, the only real heav
yweight on the squad now, is an
other fighter who uses an aggres
sive, hard-punching style. Oberlin
doesn't scale over 195 lbs. at this
time, but lie is large enough to hold
his own in the ring with other Coast |
heavyweights. Oberlin, like Enberg, j
will be troubled by a lack of expe- !
rience.
See Friday's Daily for a complete |
list of all the bouts with a short j
sketch of each fighter. •

| to fight Friday.
Enberg, under the direction of

Coach Lunny, has been working on |
his style and footwork since the be- j
ginning of the quarter, and may j
become more of a boxer in the fu
ture. His tourney record speaks for '
itself: two knockouts and a TKO.
Only Heavyweight
Dave Oberlin, the only real heav
yweight on the squad now, is an
other fighter who uses an aggres
sive, hard-punching style. Oberlin
doesn't scale over 195 lbs. at this
time, but lie is large enough to hold
his own in the ring with other Coast |
heavyweights. Oberlin, like Enberg, j
will be troubled by a lack of expe- !
rience.
See Friday's Daily for a complete |
list of all the bouts with a short j
sketch of each fighter. •

Both Champs
Enberg won the light-heavy and

against Beale. Dave weighs in at
