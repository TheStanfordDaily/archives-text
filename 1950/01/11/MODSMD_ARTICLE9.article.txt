## 
### Associated Press 
A blizzard howling through the
' Pacific Northwest dropped a frigid
j curtain of snow and wind over
j Northern California mountains last
J night. Gusty showers pelted the
state as far south as the Los Angeles
iarea.
For harried citrus growers',
forecast of rain today meant prob
able surcease from their smudge
pots. Generally temperatures were
expected to be seven to 10 degrees
higher.
Freezing weather struck another
blow at the citrus belt Monday
j night, with temperatures dropping
j to 2<> at Pomona and Rialto and 27
iat San Bernardino, Red lands, and
Fontana. Smudging, which had been
broken up by Sunday's rain, was
| taken up again.
Slippery roads caused scores of
• traffic accidents after the freeze.
, Minimum temperatures included 22
■ at Palmdale on the desert and six
below zero in the San Bernardino
Mountains (G7OO feet) at Big Bear.
The icy fingers of the storm in the
northern part of the state snapped
power lines almost as fast as re
pairmen could tic them together
again.
Weavcrville in Trinity County,
j Laylonvillc in Mendocino County,
; find Barbcrvillc and Eureka in
i Humboldt County reported the
1 worst power interruptions.
The storm however had its silver
j lining. PG&E said the storm was
piling up snow that would provide
needed water for power plants in
the spring. The rain brought needed
water to the dry central valleys.
In Southern California, the rain
freeze - rain cycle apparently will
continue for the rest of the week.
The Weather Bureau's five - day
forecast for coastal and mountain
areas tabbed more rain and snow,
depending on the elevation, for Fri
day; otherwise, continued cool.
A blizzard lashed parts of Min
; nesota and northern Michigan.
Gales and a new cold wave sent
j temperatures into a tailspin in the
| Midwest, where flooded rivers and
streams have made several thou
j sand homeless in some areas.
One edge of the Northwest storm
hit northeastern Washington and
; northern Idaho. Four inches of
fresh snow was dumped on Spo
! kane, hard hit by an earlier 16-inch
I all. Many roads were blocked or
; open to one-way traffic only.
The communications lines were
! knocked out in a half-dozen Orc
| gon communities but service later
i was restored. Snowplow crews gave
i up after .'3O inches of snow fell in
j the Santiam pass of the Caseadc
Mountains in Oregon.
