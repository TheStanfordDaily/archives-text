# Campus Gets A Drenching
## 
### 
An overdose of rain chug-a
lugged down Stanford street!
yesterday as two-days' down
pour rose to the 1.20-inch level
approximately one-twentieth of
the average yearly rainfall in
this vicinity.
Water-gutted streets around the
Union afforded excellent channel:
for the swirling currents, which had
pedestrians jumping three feet at
most curbs. No damage was reported
on campus except seepage in Sterr,
Hall basement due to clogged drains.
The Quad spouted iis own Niagara
Falls, a heavy cascade of water lap
ping down the steps in front of the
clock tower. Lake Lag again claimed
its winter distinction — the Farm's
biggest mud puddle.
A hailstorm at 11:30 a.m. yesterday
temporarily stopped educational
processes as Farm professors ob
served a few minutes' silence while
(lie icy stones battered the tile roofs.
The storm upped the seasonal total
to 5.23 inches, nearly an inch less
than the seasonal average to date,
but well over last year's figure for
January lfi. It was the worst weather
so far this year.
On the Peninsula, the rains loos
ened rocks which fell on roads near
Belmont and electric wires were
blown down near Searsvillc.
