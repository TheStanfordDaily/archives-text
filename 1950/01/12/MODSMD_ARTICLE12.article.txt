# Rain Plus Steam Creates Geyser
## 
### 
It wasn't a premature geyser that
caused a long column of steam to
curl out of the manhole cover west
of Crothers Hall Tuesday after
noon. Rather, it was the heavy
rains which sent a torrent of water
rushing down the street, thereby
flooding a steam line.
The manhole filled with water,
vaporizing the steam. The billowing
clouds rose from the ground until
Corporation Yard employees ar
rived on the scene. From then 011,
it was only a matter of pumping
the water out of the manhole, so
the steam could go on to the Croth
ers radiators.
