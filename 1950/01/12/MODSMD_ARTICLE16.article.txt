VICTIM OF THE violent storm which finally subsided over Northern California yesterday was
the Southern Pacific Overland Limited which was stalled for four hours at Soda Springs in the
high Sierra after hitting an automobile. The driver of the car was slightly injured. Passengers
in the rear end of the Oakland-bound train shivered in below-freezing weather when a coupling
broke between two diners.â€” Associated Press Wirephoto
