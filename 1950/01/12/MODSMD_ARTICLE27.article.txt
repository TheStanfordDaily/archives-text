# Excom Defeats Vote Proposal
## Arguments Based on Complications; Rosin Suggests More Consideration 
### 
A proposed amendment to the ASSU Constitution, which would
have provided staggered terms of office for Excom representa
tives, was voted down last night by the Executive Committee.
According to the rejected plan, half of the representatives would
be elected fall quarter to take office winter quarter. Election for

the remaining representatives would
be held spring quarter, terms of of
fice to begin in the fall.
Chief opposition to the plan was
based on the argument that the com
mittee would have to go through two
periods of orienting new represen
tatives to Excom procedures, rather
than one at the beginning of fall
quarter.
Seniors Penalized
It was also pointed out that seniors
elected to the committee fall quarter
would graduate before their terms
expired. This would necessitate a
special election early in fall quarter.
On the other side, it was pointed
out that the plan would provide some
continuity between Excom sessions
and provide experienced representa
tives at all times.
ASSU President Hank Rosin stat
ed that he was still convinced that
the plan is superior to the present
system, and that he hoped the com
mittee would consider it furthe?\
By a narrow 6-5 margin Excom
voted to sponsor the ski movie for
the Stanford skr team. ASSU will
underwrite the affair, which will be
managed by the Ski Club. All prof
its will go to the club for the ex
clusive use of the team.

Gregg Bemis, reporting to Excom
on plans for the movie, said that a
date has not definitely been set for
the showing.
Excom's action followed there
ceipt of a letter from the Commit
tee on Public Exercises stating that
the movie would not be permitted
unless sponsored by the ASSU.

Policies Committee, a newly formed
committee of Excom, was approved.

the grievances of the students on
matters of social policy."
The committee will be composed
