# Putting the ASSU Out on a Limb
## 
### 
In April 1947. Excom chartered the Stanford
Flying Club as an ASSU student organization.
Since that time the club has made steady prog
ress. It has become more and more active, win
ning increasing recognition for its showings in
competition with flying teams from other uni
versities.
Fortunately, there have been no accidents re
sulting in personal injury or property damage.
But what if such an accident should occur?
What if a plane flown by a Stanford Flying Club
member should injure a spectator at one of the
air meets, or damage private property? Who
would be liable in case of a lawsuit?
The University has been advised by its legal
counselors that it probably would not be
held liable, on the grounds that a court would
not (again, "probably") hold the Flying Club to
be an agent or representative of Stanford Uni
versity.
The club itself and the pilot would almost
certainly be held liable.
Our chief concern, however, is that the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University would
stand a very good chance of being named co
defendant in such a suit. It is likely that the
club would be held to be a representative of
the ASSU. It is formally recognized as a stu
dent organization and governed as such by the
ASSU Constitution.
The ASSU is not a legal entity, such as a cor
poration, subject to suit. But it is an association
and could be sued as a partnership, in which
each of the organizations chartered by the
ASSU is a partner.
The obvious solution to the problem is for the
club to take out public liability insurance. The
Student Manager and the club president thor
oughly investigated the matter and found that
the premium on such a policy would be far too
high for the club to pay.
The premium should not be paid out of

ASSU funds, which are to be used for the good
of a majority of the students. The dub does not
merit ASSU financial support on the ground of
benefit to the students.
Unless additional legal counsel establishes
that the ASSU is not liable for personal injury
or property damage as a result of Stanford Fly
ing Club activities, there are only two alterna
tives:
1. The club should provide itself with the
necessary public liability insurance.
2. The ASSU should withdraw its recogni
tion of the club as a student organization.
We do not guestion the Flying Club mem
bers' ability as pilots, but even the most experi
enced have accidents.
The Flying Club has won a place at Stanford,
but that place is not far out on a limb with the
ASSU in tow. —J L.

oughly investigated the matter and found that
the premium on such a policy would be far too
high for the club to pay.
The premium should not be paid out of

ASSU funds, which are to be used for the good
of a majority of the students. The dub does not
merit ASSU financial support on the ground of
benefit to the students.
Unless additional legal counsel establishes
that the ASSU is not liable for personal injury
or property damage as a result of Stanford Fly
ing Club activities, there are only two alterna
tives:
1. The club should provide itself with the
necessary public liability insurance.
2. The ASSU should withdraw its recogni
tion of the club as a student organization.
We do not guestion the Flying Club mem
bers' ability as pilots, but even the most experi
enced have accidents.
The Flying Club has won a place at Stanford,
but that place is not far out on a limb with the
ASSU in tow. —J L.
In April 1947. Excom chartered the Stanford
Flying Club as an ASSU student organization.
Since that time the club has made steady prog
ress. It has become more and more active, win
ning increasing recognition for its showings in
competition with flying teams from other uni
versities.
Fortunately, there have been no accidents re
sulting in personal injury or property damage.
But what if such an accident should occur?
What if a plane flown by a Stanford Flying Club
member should injure a spectator at one of the
air meets, or damage private property? Who
would be liable in case of a lawsuit?
The University has been advised by its legal
counselors that it probably would not be
held liable, on the grounds that a court would
not (again, "probably") hold the Flying Club to
be an agent or representative of Stanford Uni
versity.
The club itself and the pilot would almost
certainly be held liable.
Our chief concern, however, is that the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University would
stand a very good chance of being named co
defendant in such a suit. It is likely that the
club would be held to be a representative of
the ASSU. It is formally recognized as a stu
dent organization and governed as such by the
ASSU Constitution.
The ASSU is not a legal entity, such as a cor
poration, subject to suit. But it is an association
and could be sued as a partnership, in which
each of the organizations chartered by the
ASSU is a partner.
The obvious solution to the problem is for the
club to take out public liability insurance. The
Student Manager and the club president thor
oughly investigated the matter and found that
the premium on such a policy would be far too
high for the club to pay.
The premium should not be paid out of

ASSU funds, which are to be used for the good
of a majority of the students. The dub does not
merit ASSU financial support on the ground of
benefit to the students.

that the ASSU is not liable for personal injury
or property damage as a result of Stanford Fly
