# A 						Warning

### 
Since the open rushing period began last Fri
day. disturbances at Encina after the il p.m.
closing hour requested by the sponsors have
been all too frequent.
Calling on a freshman quietly is one thing.
But barging into his room at midnight, waking
his roommates, and causing a general uproar is
not to be condoned.
Encina sponsors hesitated to complain, but
finally were forced to take some action. The
Interfraternity Board of Control has announced
that if it receives any additional complaints
from the sponsors, it will punish the fraternities
involved.
We hope that this is not necessary. Frater
nity men entering Encina late can avoid such
action by arranging to meet freshmen in the
lobby, and staying out of rooms, after 11 p.m.
—in fairness to those who are not being
rushed. —-M.H.
