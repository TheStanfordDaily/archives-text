# New Zealanders Flunk But Pass
## Social Restrictions Would Seem Victorian in America 
### JOY HAAS 
Students have seven chances to pass their final examinations in
New Zealand. If they flunk them all, they still get passed—auto
matically.
However, Margot Miller, Stanford freshman from Wellington,
New Zealand, warns against catching the first boat for Down Under,

because the schools there are very
difficult and the social life is prac
tically nil.
British New Zealand has many
educational features that are foreign
to the American system. Boys must
wear knee pants from grammar
school through high school. Caps,
shoulder satchels, and bicycles are
standard gear.
Girls, who are educated separately,
fare worse. In the Craigshead High
School that Margot attended, girls
•wear green tunics four inches above
their knees and knee-length brown
stockings. No makeup is worn, and
girls are required to cut their hair in
a straight, short bob. Margot led a
revolt and wore her long blonde hair
in braids.
A Mile Before Breakfast
Each student in her school rose at
6:30, ran a mile before breakfast,
then practiced set-ups for three
quarters of an hour. Lunch was
fairly substantial, but dinner was a
frugal meal of bread, tea, and occa
sionally an apple ring or sausage
patties. Penalties were very severe
for students hiding food in their
rooms, but Margot found that her
lumpy New Zealand quilt wa.s above
suspicion for hiding such choice deli
cacies as American candy bars.
Students work on 10 majors during
the first three years of high school.
By the fourth year the field is nar
rowed to five. Finals are national
examinations which half the stu
dents flunk annually. A certificate is
given for four years' work, but be
fore entering a crowded New Zea
land college, students must complete
another year of school and pass an
other national final. Colleges are so
stiff and selective that Margot esti
mates their total enrollment is no
larger than Stanford's.
No Hamburgers
Although New Zealand doesn't
have hamburgers, hot dogs, blue
jeans, and other American "musts,"
it is a paradise for sports-loving va
cationists. Farmers pay hunters to
shoot deer, and the average trout
weighs 10 pounds. Mountains rise

from sea level to 12,000 feet, and the
inhabitants enjoy skiing and deep
sea fishing in the same area. It is not
unusual to see glaciers ending in
semi-tropical forests that are popu
lated with beautiful, giant parrots.
Geysers, active volcanos, 'and caves
lighted by millions of glow worms
are added attractions.
As the typical American, she was
plagued with questions such as,
"What is it like to be kissed?" She
didn't consider the girls particularly
frustrated because, "they didn't
know what they were missing!"
