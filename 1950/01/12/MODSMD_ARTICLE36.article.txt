Steve Behr, KZSU news analyst,
will present the student's view of
the news at 7:45 tonight.
Those fugitives from the Gaieties,
the Joy Boys, will create a mild
state of pandemonium at 9:30. Roy
Roberts and brother Dick play the
piano. Art Segil plucks the bass.
"This quarter," Roy said, "we will
travel around the world via sound
effects—any and all kinds. Tonight
we will broadcast from the Orient!"
The Joy Boys' original arrange
ments will include "Paper Moon,"
"It Had to Be You," and "Blue
Skies."
