# KZSU Requests Money For Discs
## 
### 
Station Manager Mary Hill ap
pealed to all those who have ordered
Gaieties recordings to pay in ad
vance. The campus station must pay
for the vinylite platters C.0.D., or
Allied Records, Inc., who pressed
the discs, will not deliver them.
About $200 is needed, Miss Hill
continued. Only $50 has been tinned
in so far.
The musical numbers, recorded
here and pressed in Los Angles by
Allied, are expected to arrive today
or the beginning of next week.
