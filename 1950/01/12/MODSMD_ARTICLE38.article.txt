With his finger crooked into a dol
lar sign, George Bahrs, KZSU sales
manager, is beckoning for salesmen.
Salesmen on the station collect a 10
per cent commission on all time
they sell to sponsors, Bahrs ex
plained.
"KZSU needs salesmen badly," he
said. "And there are good possi
bilities for selling shows-."
He asked all aspirants to come to
the KZSU offices downstairs in the
rear of Memorial Hall.
