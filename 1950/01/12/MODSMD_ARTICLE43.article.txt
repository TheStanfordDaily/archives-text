## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 11 (/P)â€” College*
football coaches voted today to keep
the two-platoon system and made a
concession to the smaller schools by
liberalizing the free - substitution
rule.
In an all-day session, the coaches'
rules committee recommended re
tention of the controversial free
substitution standard which per
mits the deploying of full 11-man
teams as units.
They went further and recom
mended that each team he al
lowed to substitute one man after
each down without incurring a
penalty.
At present, a team is penalized
five yards for making a substitution
when the clock is running.
Lou Little, chairman of the com
mittee, said this is designed to help
those teams unable to enter into
platoon football.
"It gives them a continuous
chance after each down if they want
it,"he said.
This recommendation along with
several others of less importance
will be presented to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Rules
Committee which meets in Pine
hurst, N.C., next Monday.
The coaches' recommendations
re normally adopted by ,the NCAA
Rules Committee, headed by Bill
llingham of Harvard.
Here are the other recommenda
tions:
1. That the coin-tossing ceremony
be staged 15 minutes before game
time to . enable earlier announce-,
ment of starting lineups.
2. If . the substitutions rule is
adopted as constructed, that time
outs be reduced from four to three
for each half.
3. That stricter restrictions be
placed on offnsive blocking, partic
ularly as relating to elbowing.
4. That officials be realigned on
the field to approximate their posi
tion when the ball is on the goal
line. This would put the umpire on
one side of the scrimmage, the head
linesman on the other, and bring up
the field judge. The referee would
keep his regular position. This is
designed' to give the officials a bet
ter view of the play and prevent
origination of plays before the ball
is snapped.
5. Return to the 1948 rule on per
sonal fotds. designating the type of
foul committed. At the present time,
personal fouls cover several viola
tions.
The present substittuion rule per
mits unlimited substitution of plays
when the ball changes hands or at
time-outs. This permits coaches to
swtich entire offensiv or defensive
units.
