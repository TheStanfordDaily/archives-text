# Indian, Bears, TV Meet Here Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford and Calitornia, both battered and bruised by the bad
boys from USC and UCLA, will get together this weekend to de
cide just exactly which outfit is to serve as Southern Division
doormat.
But, as usual, when these two clubs square off, more than the

Dixie cage race will be at stake. It
will be the 301st official meeting of
the Big Game basketball rivals, and
it goes without saying — anything
goes.
Tomorrow night's tilt took on
added luster yesterday when it was
announced that Associated Oil will
televise the game over Station
KPIX. It will be the first time that
a college in the Bay Area has
agreed to put its cage capers on
television.
Stanford will be gunning for its
fifth straight win over the Bears to
morrow night. The Cards will also
be looking for a chance to get back in
the Division scamper, which two
wins would give them if USC and
UCLA split this weekend.
Odds are about even that Stanford
will do it. The Bears, staggering
along on a season record of 4 wins
and 8 losses, have been easy prey for
most of their foes so far along the i
line.
Besides a prayer, Cal has little '
more to offer than a pretty good
backboard game and last season's all -
Division center, "Billy the Kid"
Hagler.
Nibs Price, in his 2(ith campaign
as Bear headman, has been jug
gling his lineup so much this sea
son some people think he's wann
ing up for a shot at Ringling Bros.
At the present time, as evidenced
by the quintet which saw the most
action in the south last weekend, j
Price's starting club consists of Bob j
Walker and Bill Hagler at forwards,
Don Hendrickson at center, and Jim
Payne and Bob Metheny at the !
guards.
Bob Walker is the daddy of the
first five. A senior, he's been around
Bear basketball as long as Gus Cha
valas has been with the Cards. Wal- i
ker is 6-3, gets up on the boards, and
is a steady point pusher. He tossed
up only 9 points last weekend, how
ever.
Bill Hagler, a soph sensation last
year, has turned into a fancy-dan
who has been making more faces
than good plays so far out, but he's
capable of turning in a hot night. He
hit 18 last weekend. The Kid also
stands 6-3 and is a power on the of
fensive board.
Don Henricksen, a 220-pound, 6-6
senior, started the season as a scrub,
but when John Cunningham couldn't

deliver at the starting pivot post,
Nibs got desperate with Don. How
veer, Cunningham started the USC
game and may get the nod tomorrow
night. Both are good rebounders,
but that's all.
Possibly the spark of Cal's attack,
1 or at least the boy who helped the
Bears give Minnesota a run for its
| money, is the soph discovery—Bob
1 Metheny. Small at 5-11, his specialty
is driving under the big boys for
lay-ups. He was good enough at it
against USC and UCLA to lead all
j California scorers with 21 points in
| two nights.
Cal's main threat is in controlling
the boards. The Bears kept even
with USC for a half by playing it
! that way, and lost by 5 points to the
i Bruins.
Against the Cards, who have
been notoriously weak on the
hoards—except for George Yard
ley—Cal could go all the way.
Then again, the Bears could lose
their eighth straight, their fifth in
! a low to Stanford, and could wind
up stuck all alone in the dim, dark
I cellar.


CO-CAPTAIN GUS CHAVALAS
will ho playing his 13th game
against California tomorrow night
when Cal's Golden Bears invade
the Pavilion. Chavalas was play
ing three years ago when Stan
ford finally defeated Cal in the
last game of the season to end
Cal's 12-game win streak, (ins
also helped spark the Cards to a
clean sweep last season.
