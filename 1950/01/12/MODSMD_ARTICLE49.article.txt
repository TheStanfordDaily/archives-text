## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Indian ruggers face one of
the toughest seasons since before 1
the was as indicated by the schedule
announced yesterday by Coach |
Chuck Taylor. In addition to the j
regular Northern California Rugby '
Union games, the Cards have sched- '
uled tentative games with British
Columbia and UCLA. Three games
with British Columbia are tenta- :
tively listed, and the first two may
in vole a trip north.
The current spell of inclement
weather has forced the ruggers in- ;
side this week, but an intrasquad j
game has been set for Saturday t
morning at which time the 60-man J
squad will have ample opportunity ]
to display its talents.
The league contests include games
with the P»lenlo Ramblers, Petaluma
Leghorns, Olympic Club, University |
Club, and the University of Cali- J
fornia. The games will be played on j
the rugby field with starting time j
set for 2 p.m. All games will be on j
the local field with the exception of 1
the Ca! tilt which will be played in 1
the stadium in Berkeley.
Last year Cal was the winner of i
the Northern California Rugby Un- ,
ion as they maintained an unde- ]
feated record in league play for the
second consecutive year. The Cards
fared almost as well by winning i
their first seven games and then :
dropping the final and deciding ;
game of the season to the Bears.
This year's team has been bol
stered considerably by the addition
of footballers Jess Cone, Dick Abra
ham, Dick Lucas, and Don Lucas.

These men will help fill the scrum
•vacancies created by the departure
| of such stalwarts as Marty Feldman
j and Mick Lachenbruch.
