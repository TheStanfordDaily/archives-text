### 
Mickey Mouse has a rival.
Members of the Palo Alto youngster set attending the first
fraternity Christmas party for underprivileged children were as
enthusiastic in their acclaim for Stanford's guitarist Frank Wolff
as they were for Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse.

Such was the opinion of the
Stanford fraternity men who con
ducted the party during Christmas
vacation for ItiO youngsters living in
the Palo Alto area. Each of the Uni
versity's two dozen fraternities con
tributed funds for the aflair which ;
was staged in Cubberley Auditorium
and the living rooms of Alpha Sigma
Phi, AKL. ATO. Theta Chi, Theta
Delt, and Theta Xi houses.
More than $300 was spent on the I
party, which was termed a "decided
.success," by Downing McKee, gen
eral chairman of the affair. "It is now
fairly definite that it will become an |
annual celebration," McKee said.
Each of the children attending the
party was given refreshments at the j
fraternity houses and then was taken I
to Cubberley Auditorium where a
vaudeville and cartoon show was
staged by Stanford men who re
mained in the Bay Area over the
holidays.
Dean Borba in a clown costume, j
Bill Dai ley as a soprano-voiced 6-
year-old, Frank Wolff as a cowboy,
and Buddy Scott as St. Nick, kept
the young audience entertained for
well over an hour. At the conclusion
of ihe stage show, gifts were dis
tributed among the children.
New coats were also purchased for |
four of the most needy children at j
the party.
Other men working with McKee as
chairmen of various committees were j
George Lane, transportation; Ted
LcVino. refreshments; and Walt Va
rellas, entertainment. Guests at the
party included Dr. Wallace Sterling j
and Alumni Director Jack Shoup. !
