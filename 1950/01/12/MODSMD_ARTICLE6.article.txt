# Italian Gov't Change
## 
### 
KOME â€”Premier Alcide de Gas- 4
peri's coalition government decided
to resign tomorrow, clearing the
way for a reorganization he has
planned since last October.
The decision came, by coinci
dence, after a day in which Com
munists demonstrated by the thou
sands against Italian police for the
slaying of six foundry workers in a
riot at Modcna Monday. Communist
spokesmen threatened a new anti
government campaign. These dem
onstrations did not precipitate the
cabinet crisis.
