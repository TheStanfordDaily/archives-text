# Damaging Storm Traveling East
## Weather Man: Clear and Cold 
### 
The storm that hit northern
California the past two days has
spent itself and clear skies are in
prospect but cold nights are
coming, the weather bureau
said yesterday.
(Meanwhile, rain continued on the
Stanford campus last night.)
The fading storm delivered some
scattered wallops too'ay, notably
north of Ukiah on Highway 101.
There highway patrolmen stopped
all truck traffic for awhile after snow
made travel dangerous.
There were scattered showers in
the lowlands, accompanied by hail
stones in some cases. New snow fell
in the higher elevations.
The forecast said fair weather
would prevail today but by tomor
row night thermometers in interior
sections would drop to 22-29 degree
levels.
Cold nights are expected to persist
for several cycles.
The sun appeared in the Eureka
area, which had been hit by rain,
hail, sleet, snow, and wind. Lumber
mills continue to suspend operations
while repair crews struggled to re
store elcctric power lines to full
service.
Major highways that had been
blocked by snow or mountain
stretches were reopened, but the
highway patrol and California Auto
mobile Association said chains were
compulsory in shaded areas.
Highway 99 from Redding north
to Dunsmuir was so slippery with
ice today that traffic moved over one
SO-mile sector on ;> one-way basis
under highway patrol escort.
A freak spot disturbance hit Menlo
Park, on the San Francisco Penin
sula today, bringing hail which
whitened the ground.
The storm brought considerable
addition to the snow pack. Donner
Summit reported an increase of 15
inches up to mid-morning for a
total of 83 inches.
