There's still one LUCKY, but
lost key in the hands of one of 70
fortunate FROSH FEMMES. who,
unfortunately haven't yet tried
opening the INDIAN TREASURE
CHEST at the CLOTHES CLOSET
with their LUCKY KEY!
Inside the Chest is a luscious
cashmere sweater and Peter Pan
bra for the girl with the right key.
FEBRUARY 4th, 1950, is your
last chance, LUCKY CAL, to open
the INDIAN TREASURE CHEST!
