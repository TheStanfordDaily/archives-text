# RUSHING
## Only Six More Shopping Days 
### 
Plans were being formulated yes- |
terday among the 24 fraternities [
for parties tomorrow and Sunday i
which will mark the final weekend j
of rushing. The functions will in- :
elude everything from ski parties to
small closed firesides.
Several house presidents reported j
they had almost completed their
p'edge class, while others had spo- I
ken for only six or eight men. Most
of the Row residences have room
for about 15 new pledges.
Encina lias taken on the aspects
of a busy department store, with all
the fraternity "consumers" looking
over the "products." Most of the
rushing chairmen have been lim
ited to only a few hours of sleep
since rushing season has been in
progress.
Interfratcrnity Council empha
sized the fact that freshmen can lc
gaily break pledges up until 7:30
p.m. next Wednesday when the for
mal pledge cards are signed.
However, according to the new
fraternity rushing rules, any
pledges broken after this deadline
will stop the pledgee from joining
a fraternity until next winter quar
ter.
'J lie Council will be glad to have
any suggestions which can be used
in the future to smooth out the
pledging procedures.
