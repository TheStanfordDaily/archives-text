# 'Turnabout' to Be Sunday Night Bill
## 
### 
When a husband and wife wish to
exchange places and make the wish
before the statuette of an Oriental
god—it's "Turnabout"—at the Sun
day Movies this week.
Carole Landis and John Hubbard
are the dissatisfied pair who think
their marriage partner has the "soft
life." They exchange bodies (but
not voices) from Thorne Smith's
risque novel.
She discovers that she can't run
the office in "half the time," while
he alienates fat wives of his
business associates at an afternoon
tea. Adolphe Menjou also stars.
Jim Kerr, Sunday Movie man
ager, requests that all students
present student body raids at the
door.
Chapter 2 of Stanford's substitute
for Tarzan, "Jungle Girl," will also
be shown along with a cartoon,
"Easter Yeggs."
