# ASSU Takes On New Responsibilities
## 
### 
This v/eek Excom approved the constitution
for a newly-formed committee, the Social Poli
cies Committee. The approval was granted in a
routine manner, with little discussion. A by
stander at the meeting would have attached no
particular importance to the proceedings.
Actually, the formation of this committee
marks the transfer of important responsibilities
from the Administration to our own student
government. The Social Policies Committee
had been discussed by Excom previously and
the constitution carefully worked out by a spe
cial committee.
The new committee's job, as defined in its
constitution, is to "define and/or interpret the
Fundamental Standard and formulate social
policy as needed."
In the past the constitution of the Activities
Reviewing Committee included in that com
mittee's duties the formulation of social policy.
In practice, however, the job was done by the
Deans, sometimes with the advice of the stu
dent committee, more often without.
A few weeks ago the Deans asked the com
mittee to assume this responsibility. The com
mittee, already overloaded with the job of
considering and approving requests for dates
for social functions, asked Excom to remove

from their constitution the responsibility for so
cial policies. Excom granted the request.
The job still had to be done. Somebody had
to formulate social policy, either the University
or the student government. Our student gov
ernment wisely accepted the responsibility.
The Social Policies Committee has not been
formed to codify the Fundamental Standard or
arbitrarily set up a body of rules and regula
tions governing social activities.
It will serve to consider special problems, de
fine and interpret the Fundamental Standard
with respect to those problems, and then set
forth a policy. Action will be taken only when
the committee feels it is necessary.
"The committee's actions are, of course, sub
ject to approval or veto by Excom, and must be
published in The Daily according to the consti
tution.
An interviewing board set up by Excom will
choose the committee's six members-at-large,
providing an additional check. The ASSU vice
president will serve as chairman, with two ex
officio members representing Men's and Wom
en's Councils.
The job of forming social policies is an im
portant addition to the powers of the ASSU. We
think it can be wisely and efficiently adminis
tered by the Social Policies Committee. â€”J.L.
