The Union Board of Governors yesterday de
cided not to give way to current economic con
ditions, and thus another Stanford tradition was
saved.
This tradition seems to be one on which Stan
ford alone is standing. In other words, the five
cenl cup of coffee is a Victorian remnant which
the University is hanging onto for us.
The recent upward trend in the price of cof
fee—from 44 cents in October to a 72-cent high
has necessitated the rise in the retail price of
the cup from five to eight cents at UCLA and to
1U cents at San Jose State.
Many Peninsula restaurants are following
nil it and no longer give a refill for a dime.
At UCLA, although the student cafeteria staff
staled that at five cents per, they would lose
$4,400 on coffee for the rest of the year, students
moaned that they would have to give up the
beverage or else drink less.
Lmbittered coffee drinkers there suggested
improving the quality or else diluting the coffee
and selling it for a nickel.
Stanford Dining Halls Director, Mjbs Christine
Ricker, said that the Cellar, too, will lose money
on the coffee drinkers, but that the Union Board

feels that it is worth it to subsidize coffee for
the benefit of students.
So, for the time being, Stanfordites may con
tinue to enjoy a worthwhile tradition. - M.K.
