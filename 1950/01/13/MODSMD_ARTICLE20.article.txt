# TV on Home Cage Games
## 
### 
Bay Area television received an unexpected
shot in the arm Wednesday when it was an
nounced that Stanford had contracted video
lights to the remainder of its home basketball
games this season with the Tidewater Asso
ciated Oil Company.
The move again makes Stanford the leader in
boosting TV in this area, and is typical of the
Athletic Department's far-sighted public rela
tions policy.
Stanford had everything to gain and nothing
to lose in agreeing to a television contract. The
Pavilion is much too small to take care of even
the normal demand for tickets; the number of
TV sets in this area is not large enough yet to
cut into attendance even if seating were ade
quate. Televising the home games will make
many new friends for Coast basketball and for
Stanford.
The University of California, on the other
hand, has refused to talk terms with television
sponsors.
