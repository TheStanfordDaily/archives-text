# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Tc/iight wt- get something special.
It's going lo be the first basketball meeting of the
year between Stanford and Cal, here in the home
Pavilion.
And although the contest reads in tho hooks as noth-

ing more than a battle for the
Southei n Division basement, it's
the 101st Big Basketball Game,
and the blue chips are on the
table.
So, yesterday, with such
thoughts in mind, 1 sauntered
over—-that's a casual way of say
ing that I ran like a Roosevelt
trying to dodge a lew buckets of
rain and several dangerous mud
bogs —to Rncina Gym.
Once there, 1 entered the hal-

lowed varsity locker-room where the players were
just getting dressed after a fast-moving workout. I
was hoping to get some dramatic quotes from the
cagers to palm off on you reader..
Anybody who has watched practice this week will
tell you that it's been one of the most successful sets
of session*; held so far this season. The Indians are
set to go all out and shoot the work:; for a double
victory this weekend.
but, trying to get the bull players to say .'.omething
serious about their intentions was a lost cause.
"Look, you guys," I said simply, "this is the Big One.
But its going to be tough. They've got Hagler and
Walker and Metheny. Who do you fear most?"
"My Public Law prof," gagged Chavalas.
"Bald Jack O Sullivan," laughed Gellier.
"Bull Session," said Yardley.

"Wait a minute- wait a minute," I objected. "This
is straight stuff. How can you gag it up at a time like
this? We're playing California. You know what that
means? They're the guys who blasted us in football.
How does that make you reel?''
"Glad that we didn't have to play Ohio State," of
fered Iverson.
"Like reading Bull Session," Yardley jabbed again.
"Okay, you guys okay—l see how it is. You think
you have to make gags for me. You think you have
to make me laugh," I cried.
Dan Stone, the senior manager, tried to soothe me
by offering me a piece of gum. But I refused when 1
noted that it was still bleeding. It had originally be
longed to Jim Rainstead, but they had just scraped
it off of Bob Mattson's elbow.
1 decided to try again. "Can't one of you say some
thing that I can record for posterity. George, you're
co-captain, how about a good 33-cent quote?"
"I'll leave it up to Gus," said George simply.
I excitedly turned to Chavalas. "What about it,
Gus?"
"I'll leave it up to George," he mumbled.
About this time Jim Walsh started to sing in a
shower-room baritone—"l'll see you in C-U-B-A"
and I knew that it was time to toss in the towel.
On the way back to The Daily Shack, 1 mused that
it was a pretty good sign to see the cogens so loose this
far along in the week.
They're sharp, alert, and ready to deliver.
So, I don't care if they want to make fun of my
station in life. I don't care if they laugh al my ques
tions, and I don't even care if they make up funnier
jokes than 1 do. But, there's just one thing I want
them to do. BftAT CAI.'
