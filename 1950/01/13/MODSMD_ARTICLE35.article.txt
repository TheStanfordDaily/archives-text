## REBELLION NCAA Split In Sanity Row 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 12 t/P) —Dixie !
colleges rose today in a seething re
bellion that split the National Col- !
legiate Athletic Association wide i
open in a fight over the Sanity j
Code.
The Southern, Southeastern, and
Southwest Conferences, in a joint
indignation meeting, voted unani
mously to stand back of four South
ern institutions threatened with ex
pulsion because of admitted code
violations.
One by one, more than 40 college i
representatives stood up to an
nounce they would vole "nay" Sat
urday when the convention will be
asked to kick out Virginia, Virginia
Tech, Virginia Military Academy, |
the Citadel, and possibly others.
Three of the original prospective
"black list" have not been identified.
Vote for Virginians
"We must use all our influence to
get out the vote for the Virginians,"
W. L. (Bill) Alexander, athletic di- |
rector at Georgia Tech, announced
at the joint meeting, ovor which he
presided.
These were other quick-breaking
developments of a riotous day with
the nation's college athletic chief
tains:
1. The Citadel announced it al- |
ready had quit the NCAA but j
planned to join in the light on the I
floor.
2. Virginia announced, through !
President Colgate Darden Jr., it
probably would pull out of th NCAA
also unless the code is changed—
' regardless of the expulsion action.
3. A move was started to rip the
NCAA of its governing powers and
j return to its position of two years
ago as merely a schedule-making
I body.
4. Karl Leib, president of the
NCAA, called Saturday's meeting
the "showdown," determining the
future of the Sanity Code and the
NCAA.
The fireworks started in the early
afternoon when all seven violators
were given the privilege of present
ing their cases before a joint meet
ing of the NCAA's executive com
mittee, council, and compliance
committee.
Rigid Code Proposed
Virginia's Darden, a former Gov
ernor of his state, came to the meet
j ing armed with a statement propos
j ing an "honest and workable" code
offering above-board athletic schol
! arships, rigidly administered by the
university.
The present code, adopted two
! years ago, restricts grants in aid to
the needy and those of high schol
| arship, and stipulates athletes must
work for board and keep.
When Darden entered the room of
the NCAA's policing and govern
ing groups, he prepared to make his
lengthy statement.
"Wo are supposed to probe into
compliance and opportunities of
complaince and have no jurisdiction
over recommended changes," the
Virginia president was told by Dr.
Leib, the presiding officer.
"We have gone over that before,"
Darden replied and, assembling his
equipment, departed.
"I suppose I was in there less than
a minute," the educator stated
later.
Representatives of other schools
i came and went, some of them dis
cussing compliance at great length.

W. L. (Bill) Alexander, athletic di- |
rector at Georgia Tech, announced
at the joint meeting, ovor which he
presided.
These were other quick-breaking
developments of a riotous day with
the nation's college athletic chief
tains:
1. The Citadel announced it al- |
ready had quit the NCAA but j
planned to join in the light on the I
floor.
2. Virginia announced, through !
President Colgate Darden Jr., it
probably would pull out of th NCAA
also unless the code is changed—
' regardless of the expulsion action.
3. A move was started to rip the
NCAA of its governing powers and
j return to its position of two years
ago as merely a schedule-making
I body.
4. Karl Leib, president of the
NCAA, called Saturday's meeting
the "showdown," determining the
future of the Sanity Code and the
NCAA.
The fireworks started in the early
afternoon when all seven violators
were given the privilege of present
ing their cases before a joint meet
ing of the NCAA's executive com
mittee, council, and compliance
committee.
Rigid Code Proposed
Virginia's Darden, a former Gov
ernor of his state, came to the meet
j ing armed with a statement propos
j ing an "honest and workable" code
offering above-board athletic schol
! arships, rigidly administered by the
university.
The present code, adopted two
! years ago, restricts grants in aid to
the needy and those of high schol
| arship, and stipulates athletes must
work for board and keep.
When Darden entered the room of
the NCAA's policing and govern
ing groups, he prepared to make his
lengthy statement.
"Wo are supposed to probe into
compliance and opportunities of
complaince and have no jurisdiction
over recommended changes," the
Virginia president was told by Dr.
Leib, the presiding officer.
"We have gone over that before,"
Darden replied and, assembling his
equipment, departed.
"I suppose I was in there less than
a minute," the educator stated
later.
Representatives of other schools
i came and went, some of them dis
cussing compliance at great length.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12 t/P) —Dixie !

representatives stood up to an
nounce they would vole "nay" Sat
urday when the convention will be
asked to kick out Virginia, Virginia
