# Boxers, Wrestlers Meet Cal Tonight
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Stanford's boxing and wrestling teams, as yet untested, meet
two well-staffed Cal squads tonight in Men's Gym on the Berkeley
campus. The boxing and wrestling matches will be intermingled,
with the wrestling getting under way at 7:30 p.m. and the boxing
at 8 p.m.
Ray Lunny's fighters, with an uneven distribution of experience

by weights, will meet a Bear squad
that boasts six lettermen. Eddie
Nemir, coach at Cal since 1933, rates
both ring teams even, as does
Lunny.
The Cardinal grapplers, under the
direction of Winston Mumby, for
mer wrestler and assistant to Coach
Chuck Taylor, have an experienced
team.
Nine boxing bouts and nine wres
tling matches will be featured in
one of the best collegiate fight cards
ever presented in the Bay Area.
The Boxing Lineup
Heavyweight—Dave Oberlin, nov
ice boxing champ, will meet Cali
fornia's Paxton Beale. Oberlin, who
is coming along very well in his
work, is a better boxer now than
during the tourney. His hard light
hand might prove enough to stop
the 220-lb. Beale.
Light-heavy (175 lbs.) —Jim Ham
mond, with two years' experience,
turned in a very good season last
year and can be expected to repeat.
He will fight Vic Corbett, who was
Cal's intramural champ last fall and
received the award for the outstand
ing boxer in the tourney.
Also fighting in this weight will
be Jack Bickel against Cal's Bill
Kitchin or Don Bart'.ey. Bickel,
who uses a hard-hitting, straight
punching style, scored three TKO's
in the novice fracas to win the mid
dleweight title.
Middleweight (165 lbs.) — Stan
ford's Bill Sharp, All-U tournament
victor who has two years' seasoning,
will meet Cal's Bruce Jahnke.
Jahnke was mural champ at Cal a
year ago, and saw action last year.
Senior welterweight (155) — In
this weight John Colton, a Card
newcomer, will be paired with Dick
Knezevich or Hank Harvey. Colton,
though untested, has shown prom
ise. Knezevich was second in PCL
competition last year and is rated a
toss-up with letterman Harvey.
Welterweight (145 lbs.) — Jose
Rael, a team stalwart, was unde
feated last year as a lightweight.
In one of the best fights in the
All-U tourney he came through and
decisioned Karl May. Rael will fight
Bill Sapsis, an experienced fighter
wh6 was mural champ last year and
1 won the award for outstanding
I boxer. Karl May, the snappy new
i comer who was split-decisioned by
Rael last month, will meet Cal's
i Doug Keith.
Lightweight (135 lbs.)—Ring-wise
lay Savage will meet Ed Griffin of
Cal tonight for the third time run
\ ning. Both fighters are experienced
| lettermen. Savage was novice champ
| in 1947. Backing Savage up in this
; class will be another Card letter
-1 man. Bob Baker, who will fight Lee
Sapiro or Bob Rouse. Baker lost
the decision to Savage in the A!l-U
lightweight tilt last December.
The Wrestling Lineup
Heavyweight — Smilin' Steve
Garst, in spite of a broken bone in

his foot, will be all set to take on j
Cal's behemoth, Louis Bayuk. Garst
had a good season last year and is 1
one of the top returning lettermen. |
175 lbs. — Dick DeWitt, a big!
light - heavyweight, is another re- j
turning letterman whose experience j
will add to the squad. He is sched- :
uled to meet Bentley Lyon.
I(>s lbs. — This weight is still ;t
question mark to Coach Mumby.
Bob Harmon and Joe Cusick, let
termen from last year, have been
joined by experienced Ray Harris.
Harris a team member in '48, was
out last season with a shoulder in
jury. Armand Block, Cal's captain, i
will meet the man chosen by i
Mumby.
155 lbs.—Nilcs Severin can ably |
fill in this spot, vacated by Dan j
Winston, who graduated. Severin,
a comparative newcomer, will be |
matched against Bob Walkup.
145 lbs.—Rollin Rose, wrestling in |
the Indian varsity lineup for the
first time, has drawn newcomer Joe
McKim, one of Cal's top men. Rose I
wrestled last season, however, and j
will not be at a loss for experience. |
135 lbs. — Captain Don Williams, I
who will lead the Cards, comes up i
against Don Carter. Williams is ex- !
pected to repeat last year's excel- I
lent showing.
128 lbs.—Veteran Dick Cruce will
begin his third season at this weight
when he meets Cal's Richard Han
sen.
121 lbs.—Dick Esbenshade is an
other Indian who will inaugurate |
his third season of vai'sity wrestling
tonight. He will grapple Pete Rip
log.

tramural champion, when the
Hear boxers take on Ray Lunny's
hopefuls at Berkeley tonight.
