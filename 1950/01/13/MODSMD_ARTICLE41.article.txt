# Are The Roaring Twenties Staging a '50 Comeback?
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
The generation of the fifties is be
ginning to hear a distant rumble—
a rumble coming to them through
medium of newspapers, fashion
magazines, phonographs-—a rumble
from the roaring twenties.
Is the era of the twenties staging
a comeback?
Every day more girls are placing
their long hair at the mercy of a
hair stylist's shears so that they can
have a boyish bob. Skirts are be
coming shorter again after the New
Look.
The songs of the twenties such as
"Little White Lies" are being re
vived. Students are taking great in-

terest in the revival of the Charles
ton. The Mark Hopkins Hotel in
San Francisco is reviving college
night, which was quite popular at
Stanford during the twenties. They
even have a staff of Arthur Murray
experts to guide students through
their first steps in the Charleston.
The trend is definitely here, but
Stanford life in the twenties con
tained many features that may
never return.
Gin and Jazz
Gin and jazz functioned mainly to
drown out the wave of disillusion
ment felt after the war. New fads
and fashions arose and disappeared.
Two slogans were very popular at
Stanford in the mid-twenties: "Gas
and alcohol don't mix." and "Never
go up to the back hills unless in a
party of six."
Dating was called queening. A
girl was highly rated if she could
queen a hasher. Sorority houses
traditionally were served by hash
ers from a specific fraternity—boys
who had been picked for being es
pecially smooth.
For a long time, dating was con-

fined to trips to San Francisco ho
tels for an evening of dining and
dancing. The most romantic date of
all, however, was for a rough to I
take his date canoeing and bring '
along a portable victrola so he could !
create the right atmosphere with ;
possibly a Rudy Vallee record.
Changing Fashions
The period was an expensive one j
for the girls. Fashions changed al- '
most quarterly — from long, wide, j
pleated skirts, tightly cinched in
with belts, to short, knee - length
dresses with lowered waistlines.
Coeds wore their hair elaborately
marcelled and coyly scalloped c'own
over their faces, all but impairing i
vision.
For roughs, cords were at the j
height of popularity. The filthier the j
cords were, the better they were
considered to look. In fact, the
cords weren't broken in unless the
wearer had to take two steps be- j
fore his pants would follow.
Hats for men were also popular
on Quad. Senior men always wore '
gray felt hats to advertise their sta
tus, while freshmen, of necessity, j
wore beanies.
