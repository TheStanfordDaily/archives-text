# Groups Revise Former Plans For Workshop
## 
### 
Representatives from several cam
i pus organizations met yesterday to
j discuss plans for the coming Student
Workshop, which was the name de
| cidcd upon to replace last year's
I title of Mock Convention.
The convention in 1949 was de
! signed to discover how students
: were feeling about local, campus,
1 and national affairs, so that their
delegates would be able to speak
effectively about Stanford.
The groups agreed that the per
| manent purpose of the Workshop
i should be stated in more concrete
j terms than it is at present. Areas of
j discussion groups were also slightly
revised from those submitted at ;in
J earlier meeting. They now consist
of the students' role in relation to:
1. Campus—individual and group
2. Community—local and world
A group of"YWCA members will
j serve as co-ordinating committee
! for the Workshop. Marge Gavin and
j Ruth Vickery are co - chairmen.
I Marty Hewitt is in charge of regis
tration; Mike Stevens, secretarial
j staff; Kit Barr, refreshments; and
; Nancy Taylor, general arrange
| ments.
j The Student Workshop will be
held February 17 and 18, Friday
iand Saturday.
At the end of last fall quarter,
de'egates from several campus or
| ganizations met as a preliminary
j for discussing the possibilities of
| holding a second convention similar
j to the Mock Convention of last year.
They concluded that last year's dis
i cussions had been valuable and
j should be continued annually.
They also agreed that the number
jof organizations included should
j be opened to the entire campus, and
that both n men and women should
| be represented.
At this preliminary meeting, the
I "Y" offer,to continue sponsorship of
j the Workshop was accepted. It was
felt that one organized group was
needed to plan and keep the meet
ing going, and also, that the "Y" had
last year's experience to build on.
Women leaders from most of the
campus organizations met for a
two-day period and discussed items
under the following headings: ex
tra-curricular activities, the Memo
rial Church, and the YWCA public
affairs program.
