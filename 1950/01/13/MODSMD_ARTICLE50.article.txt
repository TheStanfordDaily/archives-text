# Foreign Career Meeting Addressed by Dr. Barahal
## 
### 
Foreign Career Association held a short business meeting Tues
day night, followed by a talk on vocational planning by Dr. George
D. Barahal, director of Stanford's Counseling and Testing Center.
Dr. Barahal pointed out some things to consider in choosing a
job. First, a job's compatibility with your interests, personality,
and ability, is important. Most l

Stanford students who want profes
sional or the so-called white-collar
jobs, could fit into many. Second,
the nature of your own drive, ability,
interests, and character should be
considered. Drive is a necessa-y fac
tor; ability is not enough.
With the aid of several charts, he
outlined occupational trends in the
United States, occupational structure
of the United States, and counseling
potentialities and limitations.
The Counseling and Testing Cen
ter, said Dr. Barahal, grew from a
counseling program for veterans,
which beÂ°in in 1946. With last year's
decrease in Stanford's veteran popu
lation, it was decided to extend the
service to all students on a limited
basis.
Tests taken at the Counseling and

Testing Center are not supposed to
give exact information as to what
job you should t;ike, but arc only
indications of aptitude and prefer
ence.
