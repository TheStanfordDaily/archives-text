### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's sophomore-studded basketball team, staggered by
two straight league losses, but deadly determined to get back into
the Southern Division cage race, will take the floor tonight in the
Pavilion against California's troublesome Golden Bears in the 101st
meeting of the Big Game series.
Tipoff for this big anniversary battle—opening the second hun

*dred contests between these two Big
j Game rivals— will be set back until

cameras to catch the game from the
initial jump.

C»:45, and between Cal Blues and
Stanford Braves al 3 in the after
noon.
Tomorrow night, all six teams will
take their business to Berkeley, with
the varsity starting time remaining
at 8:30.
Stanford's chances for a double
victory will rest heavily on the high
scoring and timely-rebounding
George Yardley, and on the two
sophomore sparkplugs — Jim Walsh
and Jim Ramstead.
If Yardley can maintain his pres -
ent pace of 15 points per, and if the
two Jim-men can set. off the fuse on
a night of firebrand sophomore play -

.soph mates, Bruce Iverson, Harry
Hugasian, and Hon Carver then

straight wins over California.
Yardley is second in Southern
Division scoring with 29 points in
two games, while Jim Walsh rates
the No. 112» spot with 24 points.
To date, it lias been the ragged
| play of the sophs and the wildness of
the old hands, Yardley, Gus Ch;<
! valas. and Jack O'Sullivan, which
1 has kept the season record under the
.500 mark at 5 wins and 6 losses.
Chavalas, who was one of the most
effective clutch players on the team
last season, has been off his feed of
late. Knocking off only 5 poin's in
the fust weekend of play, he wa,
j definitely not up to snuff. However,

bounding and their tendency to tiro
in the second half. To improve the:-.e
two weaknesses, Everett Dean har,

shape this week.
California's main threat lies i»i
its improved and now potent back -
board game, and in its individual

UCLA and Minnesota, and a rugged

I center, now switched to a forward
slot. leads California scoring with
11.5 points per contest. But, the

year of varsity play; MARV GEJ.BER, a two-handed

Stanford's sophomore-studded basketball team, staggered by
two straight league losses, but deadly determined to get back into
the Southern Division cage race, will take the floor tonight in the

Stanford's sophomore-studded basketball team, staggered by
two straight league losses, but deadly determined to get back into
the Southern Division cage race, will take the floor tonight in the
Pavilion against California's troublesome Golden Bears in the 101st
