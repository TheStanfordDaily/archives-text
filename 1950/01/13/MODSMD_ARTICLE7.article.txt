# BEAR, INJUN FIVES TANGLE TONIGHT
## Stanford Shoots for Fifth Straight in 101st Cal Clash 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's sophomore-studded basketball team, staggered by
two straight league losses, but deadly determined to get back into
the Southern Division cage race, will take the floor tonight in the
Pavilion against California's troublesome Golden Bears in the 101st
meeting of the Big Game series.
Tipoff for this big anniversary battle—opening the second hun

*dred contests between these two Big
j Game rivals— will be set back until
8-JO In enable the KPIX television
cameras to catch the game from the
initial jump.
Preliminary clashes are scheduled
between Cal and Stanford Frosh for
C»:45, and between Cal Blues and
Stanford Braves al 3 in the after
noon.
Tomorrow night, all six teams will
take their business to Berkeley, with
the varsity starting time remaining
at 8:30.
Stanford's chances for a double
victory will rest heavily on the high
scoring and timely-rebounding
George Yardley, and on the two
sophomore sparkplugs — Jim Walsh
and Jim Ramstead.
If Yardley can maintain his pres -
ent pace of 15 points per, and if the
two Jim-men can set. off the fuse on
a night of firebrand sophomore play -
ing— by themselves and their three
.soph mates, Bruce Iverson, Harry
Hugasian, and Hon Carver then
Stanford should rate Ihe favorite" ;
role in going after its fifth and sixth
straight wins over California.
Yardley is second in Southern
Division scoring with 29 points in
two games, while Jim Walsh rates
the No. 112» spot with 24 points.
To date, it lias been the ragged
| play of the sophs and the wildness of
the old hands, Yardley, Gus Ch;<
! valas. and Jack O'Sullivan, which
1 has kept the season record under the
.500 mark at 5 wins and 6 losses.
Chavalas, who was one of the most
effective clutch players on the team
last season, has been off his feed of
late. Knocking off only 5 poin's in
the fust weekend of play, he wa,
j definitely not up to snuff. However,
j Chavalas has a habit of playing hi:;
j best games against California. If so,
I his past alert play-making and mis
; placed shooting eye will be wel
! corned back with great, glee.
Also hurting the Cards this far
j along has been their laxity in re
bounding and their tendency to tiro
in the second half. To improve the:-.e
two weaknesses, Everett Dean har,
whipped them into their top playing
shape this week.
California's main threat lies i»i
its improved and now potent back -
board game, and in its individual
| sparklers, Billy Haglcr and Boh
Walker.
Cal turned in tough games against
UCLA and Minnesota, and a rugged
first, half against USC, mainly be
cause Walker, Jim Payne, and Don
J Hendrickson were covering both
■ boards and hogging the ball all over
I the place.
Hagler, last season's all-Division
I center, now switched to a forward
slot. leads California scoring with
11.5 points per contest. But, the
most recent scoring ace is guard Bob
i Metheny, who netted 21 in the league
j openers.
To combat the Bear attack, Dean
announced yesterday that he would
s<ick with his regular starters
Yardley, Walsh, Ramstead, Cha
j valas. and Mai v Gelber.
Gelber, who drew Bill Sharman
last week, and who was commended
I for doing a "good guarding job in
| spite of Sharman's 31 points," will


HERE ARE THE FIVE BOYS who will take the
floor tonight for the beginning of the second hun
dred Cal-Stanford basketball games. From left to
right, they are GEORGE YARDLEY, leading Card

scorer; JIM WALSH, said to be the finest soph pros
pect since Jim Pollard; JIM RAMSTEAD, the two
time all-city boy from San Francisco, now in his first
year of varsity play; MARV GEJ.BER, a two-handed

shooting specialist from Riveredge, New Jersey;
and GUS CHAVALAS, the first four-year letterman
in Stanford's basketball history. They'll all be gun
ning for their fifth straight win over Cal tonight.
