# University Fights Proposal To Open Campus to Hunters
## 
### 
Stanford University today will
j fight a Fish and Game Commission
proposal that the 8,000-acre campus
lose its; status as a statr dorr refuge.
Lawyers and scientists will be
sent, by the University to the meet
ing at 2 this afternoon in the Palo
I Alto Community Center. Since the
| grounds arc used as laboratories for
classes and for Held research, many
j students and professors would be in
danger if the area were to be open
I to hunters, University officials say.
Under the present conditions the
j campus constitutes "an unnecessary
I patrol problem," the commission
! claims. Trespass laws protecting the
j large residential district within the
| grounds of the campus prevent ade
quate patrol of the area.
Game Warden Ted Holladay slat
'ed Saturday: :
"Although there would not be

enough hunting to alleviate the
problem if the refuge were opened,
it would not put us in the position
we are now in of total protection of
a herd of deer that are doing con
siderable damage.
"There is no necessity of any legal
closure, for far too great a percent
age of this area will remain closed
by trespass laws for proper utiliza
tion of the game resources in the
area. Additional closure puts the
Division of Fish and Game in an
embarrassing position in regard to
depredation problems."
