# Cardinals Split Weekend Pair
## Revised Lineup Outfights Bears For Overtime Victory Saturday 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's new lighting Indians, bouncing back from a 6(J S'j
Friday night trimming in the Pavilion, outfought the Cal Boars in
their own corner Saturday night, to win in a sparkling overtunn
thriller, 50 47.
It was a new Card spirit—built around the surprise injection of

Ralph Carver, Jack O'Sullivan, and
Bruce Ivorson into the starting line
up—which carried the Deanmen to
their first league win and snapped t
three-game losing streak.
Captain George Yardley, playinc
his most inspired game—shooting
with deadly accuracy in the clutch,
controlling the defensive boards
like a roaring demon, and scrap
ping like a champ—led the Stan
ford attack.
With a minute gone in the Satur
day night overtime, Yardley pumped
in a carefuliy-executed jump-shot,
behind Ralph Carver's screen, giving
i Stanford first blood, 47-45.
Hagler Tics Score
Then, Bill Hagler tied it up with
shot from the key, and at the same
, time was awarded a free throw. But,
the Hag missed, and when Yardley
I cleared the board with a screaming
I rebound, Hagler fouled him —ami
i that was it, right then and there
Yardley calmly tanked the im
j portant charity toss, and then got
| back on defense in time to go two
miles in the air to come up with an
other rebound and put the Bear, to
sleep for good. Seconds later it wh .
all on ice when Ralph Carver took i
i pass on an out-of-bounds play, and
bounced neatly to Jack O'Suilivan,
: who ripped in with a lay-up fo !hn
| finishing touch, 50-47.
Yardley Scores '.12
Yardley was high man with i »
points, which combined with his fust
night's total of 17, shot his Southern
Division efforts to 61 for four games
and kept him in second place behind
i the amazing Bill Sharman, who has
i 90.
Jim Walsh, playing from the guard
! spot now, moved into fourth place in
the scoring derby, as he pocketed 2.2
points in the two nights to bring his
league standing to 4fi.
Everett Dean pulled a mild sur
prise Friday night when lie yanked
Gus Chavalas out of the starting
lineup, and switched to a zone d
fense around tall-men Jim Ram
stead. George Yardley, Ralph Car
ver, Jim Walsh, and Marv Gelber.
The zone seemed to be working
well enough, as Stanford had a
three-point lead, 31-28. at halftimc
But, Dean figured a man-to-man
would get better results in the sec
ond half. However, Cal seemed to
like the man-to-man, especially Bob
Walker,.who dropped in his season"
high of 22 points to lead Cal to •/
comeback win,
I)ean Makes Shift
But, on Saturday night, Dean sui •
passed his first surprise with an even
more drastic switch — this time
benching Chavalas and Gelber for
the entire contest. And this time
Stanford tsuck with the zone all the
way.
Ralph Carver, in particular, was i
shining light in the new defense.
Aggressive and determined, Carver
helped Yardley like a right hand in
clearing the board.
Carver also shone on offense, pass
ing off cleverly to his cutters, and
tossing up several timely buckets of
his own for a weekend total of 19.
His work around the key was the
most consistent turned in by a Stan
ford pivotman in the past two sea
sons.
Bruce Iverson and Jack O'Sulli
van, starting their first varsity games,
also helped lend a hand to the new
spirit introduction. What the Cards
didn't have in smoothness and
finesse, they more than made up for
in good old fashioned scrap.
Whether the benching of Gelber
and Chavalas is here to stay remains

s ingest bunch Dean has put together

brand of basketball, they'll be able
j to stay on the same floor with any

Stanford's new lighting Indians, bouncing back from a 6(J S'j
Friday night trimming in the Pavilion, outfought the Cal Boars in
their own corner Saturday night, to win in a sparkling overtunn
thriller, 50 47.
It was a new Card spirit—built around the surprise injection of

Ralph Carver, Jack O'Sullivan, and
Bruce Ivorson into the starting line
up—which carried the Deanmen to
their first league win and snapped t
three-game losing streak.
Captain George Yardley, playinc
his most inspired game—shooting
with deadly accuracy in the clutch,
controlling the defensive boards
like a roaring demon, and scrap
ping like a champ—led the Stan
ford attack.
With a minute gone in the Satur
day night overtime, Yardley pumped
in a carefuliy-executed jump-shot,
behind Ralph Carver's screen, giving
i Stanford first blood, 47-45.
Hagler Tics Score
Then, Bill Hagler tied it up with
shot from the key, and at the same
, time was awarded a free throw. But,
the Hag missed, and when Yardley
I cleared the board with a screaming
I rebound, Hagler fouled him —ami
i that was it, right then and there
Yardley calmly tanked the im
j portant charity toss, and then got
| back on defense in time to go two
miles in the air to come up with an
other rebound and put the Bear, to
sleep for good. Seconds later it wh .
all on ice when Ralph Carver took i
i pass on an out-of-bounds play, and
bounced neatly to Jack O'Suilivan,
: who ripped in with a lay-up fo !hn
| finishing touch, 50-47.
Yardley Scores '.12
Yardley was high man with i »
points, which combined with his fust
night's total of 17, shot his Southern
Division efforts to 61 for four games
and kept him in second place behind
i the amazing Bill Sharman, who has
i 90.
Jim Walsh, playing from the guard
! spot now, moved into fourth place in
the scoring derby, as he pocketed 2.2
points in the two nights to bring his
league standing to 4fi.
Everett Dean pulled a mild sur
prise Friday night when lie yanked
Gus Chavalas out of the starting
lineup, and switched to a zone d
fense around tall-men Jim Ram
stead. George Yardley, Ralph Car
ver, Jim Walsh, and Marv Gelber.
The zone seemed to be working
well enough, as Stanford had a
three-point lead, 31-28. at halftimc
But, Dean figured a man-to-man
would get better results in the sec
ond half. However, Cal seemed to
like the man-to-man, especially Bob
Walker,.who dropped in his season"
high of 22 points to lead Cal to •/
comeback win,
I)ean Makes Shift
But, on Saturday night, Dean sui •
passed his first surprise with an even
more drastic switch — this time
benching Chavalas and Gelber for
the entire contest. And this time
Stanford tsuck with the zone all the
way.
Ralph Carver, in particular, was i
shining light in the new defense.
Aggressive and determined, Carver
helped Yardley like a right hand in
clearing the board.
Carver also shone on offense, pass
ing off cleverly to his cutters, and
tossing up several timely buckets of
his own for a weekend total of 19.
His work around the key was the
most consistent turned in by a Stan
ford pivotman in the past two sea
sons.
Bruce Iverson and Jack O'Sulli
van, starting their first varsity games,
also helped lend a hand to the new
spirit introduction. What the Cards
didn't have in smoothness and
finesse, they more than made up for
in good old fashioned scrap.

Yardley Scores '.12
Yardley was high man with i »
points, which combined with his fust
night's total of 17, shot his Southern
Division efforts to 61 for four games
and kept him in second place behind
i the amazing Bill Sharman, who has
i 90.
Jim Walsh, playing from the guard
! spot now, moved into fourth place in
the scoring derby, as he pocketed 2.2
points in the two nights to bring his
league standing to 4fi.
Everett Dean pulled a mild sur
prise Friday night when lie yanked
Gus Chavalas out of the starting
lineup, and switched to a zone d
fense around tall-men Jim Ram
stead. George Yardley, Ralph Car
ver, Jim Walsh, and Marv Gelber.
The zone seemed to be working
well enough, as Stanford had a
three-point lead, 31-28. at halftimc
But, Dean figured a man-to-man
would get better results in the sec
ond half. However, Cal seemed to

Walker,.who dropped in his season"
high of 22 points to lead Cal to •/
comeback win,
I)ean Makes Shift
But, on Saturday night, Dean sui •
passed his first surprise with an even
more drastic switch — this time
benching Chavalas and Gelber for
the entire contest. And this time
Stanford tsuck with the zone all the
way.
Ralph Carver, in particular, was i
shining light in the new defense.
Aggressive and determined, Carver
helped Yardley like a right hand in
clearing the board.
Carver also shone on offense, pass
ing off cleverly to his cutters, and
tossing up several timely buckets of
his own for a weekend total of 19.
His work around the key was the
most consistent turned in by a Stan
ford pivotman in the past two sea
sons.
Bruce Iverson and Jack O'Sulli
van, starting their first varsity games,
also helped lend a hand to the new
spirit introduction. What the Cards
didn't have in smoothness and
finesse, they more than made up for
in good old fashioned scrap.
Whether the benching of Gelber
and Chavalas is here to stay remains

Stanford's new lighting Indians, bouncing back from a 6(J S'j
Friday night trimming in the Pavilion, outfought the Cal Boars in
their own corner Saturday night, to win in a sparkling overtunn
thriller, 50 47.
It was a new Card spirit—built around the surprise injection of

Ralph Carver, Jack O'Sullivan, and
Bruce Ivorson into the starting line
up—which carried the Deanmen to
their first league win and snapped t
three-game losing streak.
Captain George Yardley, playinc
his most inspired game—shooting
with deadly accuracy in the clutch,
controlling the defensive boards
like a roaring demon, and scrap
ping like a champ—led the Stan
ford attack.
With a minute gone in the Satur
day night overtime, Yardley pumped
in a carefuliy-executed jump-shot,
behind Ralph Carver's screen, giving
i Stanford first blood, 47-45.
Hagler Tics Score
Then, Bill Hagler tied it up with
shot from the key, and at the same
, time was awarded a free throw. But,
the Hag missed, and when Yardley
I cleared the board with a screaming
I rebound, Hagler fouled him —ami
i that was it, right then and there
Yardley calmly tanked the im

miles in the air to come up with an
other rebound and put the Bear, to
sleep for good. Seconds later it wh .
