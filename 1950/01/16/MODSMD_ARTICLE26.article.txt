# Continuity in Legislation Is Needed
## 
### 
Proposals for a constitutional change which
would allow more continuity in legislative ac
tion by Excom are being considered by Execu
live Committee members. One such plan was
rejected by this body last week, but the matter
will come up again.
The picblem for which Excom is seeking a
remedy is that all but one of its 17 members
•ire chosen at the same time, and without any
particular orientation they all assume office at
the same time.
Accordingly, a good portion of the first
month of fall quarter is wasted while these new
members familiarize themselves with their
duties.
The apparent solution is to stagger the elec
tions— to elect half of the representatives in
spring quarter, and the other half during the
fall quarter elections. The first gioup would
serve from fall to spring and the second from
winter to fall.
Such a procedure would allow a continuity of
legislative policy and an opportunity for long
range planning not now possible. Newly
elected members would fit in more smoothly
and learn faster if there were experienced rep
resentatives there to help them.
The plan seems simple enough, but working
out the details is much more difficult than it
at first might appear. Typical questions which
must be answered are how best to divide the
Excom into two well-balanced groups, how to
avoid disqualifying seniors with the winter to
fall term requirement, and how best to orient
new members before they are seated (this

seems desirable whether a plan i-or staggered
terms is adopted or not).
The two best plans presented thus far go
roughly as follows:
1. Choose living group representatives (7)
during fall quarter to take office winter quarter.
Class representatives (5 or 6) would be elected
during spring quarter to assume office in the
fall as they are now. (The plan has the draw
back of either disqualifying students from run
ning in their living groups during their senior
year, or necessitating costly special elections
early in fall quarter to fill posts vacated by
graduation.)
2. Choose class representatives during the
fall and living group in the spring. This would
eliminate the senior problem, but would be
difficult to administer unless class representa
tives were known by the number of their class
('5O, '51, etc.) instead of by their standing in
school (senior, junior, etc.).
Under both proposals the ASSU President
and Vice-President, and the two ex-officio mem
bers—the ASSU Student Manager and the
Daily editor-would take their seats at the be
ginning of fall quarter.
It is desirable that some such plan, designed
to expedite work in fall quarter and at the same
time allow for a certain amount of long-range
legislative policy, be adopted. ' Policy," as it is
now determined, is haphazard by nature, and it
has been our observation that most Excoms
spend a good deal of time reviewing the work
of previous Excoms. It is only through coinci
dence that the two groups ever come up with
the same policies.

•ire chosen at the same time, and without any
particular orientation they all assume office at
the same time.
Accordingly, a good portion of the first
month of fall quarter is wasted while these new
members familiarize themselves with their
duties.
The apparent solution is to stagger the elec
tions— to elect half of the representatives in
spring quarter, and the other half during the
fall quarter elections. The first gioup would
serve from fall to spring and the second from
winter to fall.
Such a procedure would allow a continuity of
legislative policy and an opportunity for long
range planning not now possible. Newly
elected members would fit in more smoothly
and learn faster if there were experienced rep
resentatives there to help them.
The plan seems simple enough, but working
out the details is much more difficult than it
at first might appear. Typical questions which
must be answered are how best to divide the
Excom into two well-balanced groups, how to
avoid disqualifying seniors with the winter to
fall term requirement, and how best to orient
new members before they are seated (this

seems desirable whether a plan i-or staggered
terms is adopted or not).
The two best plans presented thus far go
roughly as follows:
1. Choose living group representatives (7)
during fall quarter to take office winter quarter.
Class representatives (5 or 6) would be elected
during spring quarter to assume office in the
fall as they are now. (The plan has the draw
back of either disqualifying students from run
ning in their living groups during their senior
year, or necessitating costly special elections
early in fall quarter to fill posts vacated by
graduation.)
2. Choose class representatives during the
fall and living group in the spring. This would
eliminate the senior problem, but would be
difficult to administer unless class representa
tives were known by the number of their class
('5O, '51, etc.) instead of by their standing in
school (senior, junior, etc.).
Under both proposals the ASSU President
and Vice-President, and the two ex-officio mem
bers—the ASSU Student Manager and the
Daily editor-would take their seats at the be
ginning of fall quarter.
It is desirable that some such plan, designed
to expedite work in fall quarter and at the same
time allow for a certain amount of long-range
legislative policy, be adopted. ' Policy," as it is
now determined, is haphazard by nature, and it
has been our observation that most Excoms
spend a good deal of time reviewing the work
of previous Excoms. It is only through coinci
dence that the two groups ever come up with
the same policies.
Proposals for a constitutional change which
would allow more continuity in legislative ac
tion by Excom are being considered by Execu
live Committee members. One such plan was
rejected by this body last week, but the matter
will come up again.
The picblem for which Excom is seeking a
remedy is that all but one of its 17 members
•ire chosen at the same time, and without any
particular orientation they all assume office at
the same time.
