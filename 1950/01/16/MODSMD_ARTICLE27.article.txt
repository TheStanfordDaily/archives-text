# Prestige Is Not Enough
## 
### 
The question of a salary for the ASSU Presi
dent and Vice-President—mentioned in a Daily
editorial last quarter—is at present being con
sidered by an Excom committee.
There are several good arguments for paying
a salary.
At present, with no salary paid, students who
need income from an outside job quite likely
would be unable to hold these two top ASSU
positions. It would be difficult to find time for
a job and serve conscientously as ASSU Presi
dent.
The amount of time that both of these jobs re
quire—Excom meetings, office hours, commit
tee meetings, etc.— would seem to be so great
as to merit some monetary compensation.
While ilie amount of time spent on the job
varies with the individual. Hank Rosin esti
mates he spends 15 to 25 hours a week.
Other schools pay salaiies. Cil and UCLA
both pay their student body presidents $500 a
year. The publications heads at Stanford all re
ceive a rsalary.
On Ihe other hand, these ASSU officers do
receive a non-monetary compensation in pres
tige for their work. This prestige will probably
prove of great value when the time comes to
hunt for a permanent job.
Some consider this prestige, both on campus
and after graduation, to be so much greater than
that of the paying campus jobs as to balance

the lack of a salary.
Another possibility is that of offering unit
credits. The Journalism Department gives units
to certain members of The Daily staff. But there
is a question of what department should give
the units for these ASSU positions, and whether
the units would be recognized at other schools.
It is not likely that units could be given here.
Wisely enough, Excom has decided that sal
aries, if voted, would not be put into effect until
next year. This should eliminate criticism that
any present officers are trying to fatten their
own pocketbooks.
When the matter is finally voted on by Ex
com, President Hank Rosin will recommend
that the matter, because of its importance, be
placed either on the winter or the spring quar
ter ballot. Comment by students to their Excom
representatives or in letters to The Daily is wel
comed.
The amount of salary that would be paid is
still being worked out. Too high a salary would
open the door to campus politicians who might
desire the job merely for the money.
But we think a reasonable salary is well
deserved. While the ASSU President does have
an expense account, he receives nothing for his
personal use. The large amounts of time and
work that the President and Vice-President
spend on their jobs would seem to rate a little
more. — M.H.

tee meetings, etc.— would seem to be so great
as to merit some monetary compensation.
While ilie amount of time spent on the job
varies with the individual. Hank Rosin esti
mates he spends 15 to 25 hours a week.
Other schools pay salaiies. Cil and UCLA
both pay their student body presidents $500 a
year. The publications heads at Stanford all re
ceive a rsalary.
On Ihe other hand, these ASSU officers do
receive a non-monetary compensation in pres
tige for their work. This prestige will probably
prove of great value when the time comes to
hunt for a permanent job.
Some consider this prestige, both on campus
and after graduation, to be so much greater than
that of the paying campus jobs as to balance

the lack of a salary.
Another possibility is that of offering unit
credits. The Journalism Department gives units
to certain members of The Daily staff. But there
is a question of what department should give
the units for these ASSU positions, and whether
the units would be recognized at other schools.
It is not likely that units could be given here.
Wisely enough, Excom has decided that sal
aries, if voted, would not be put into effect until
next year. This should eliminate criticism that
any present officers are trying to fatten their
own pocketbooks.
When the matter is finally voted on by Ex
com, President Hank Rosin will recommend
that the matter, because of its importance, be
placed either on the winter or the spring quar
ter ballot. Comment by students to their Excom
representatives or in letters to The Daily is wel
comed.
The amount of salary that would be paid is
still being worked out. Too high a salary would
open the door to campus politicians who might
desire the job merely for the money.
But we think a reasonable salary is well
deserved. While the ASSU President does have
an expense account, he receives nothing for his
personal use. The large amounts of time and
work that the President and Vice-President
spend on their jobs would seem to rate a little
more. — M.H.
The question of a salary for the ASSU Presi
dent and Vice-President—mentioned in a Daily
editorial last quarter—is at present being con
sidered by an Excom committee.
There are several good arguments for paying
a salary.
At present, with no salary paid, students who
need income from an outside job quite likely
would be unable to hold these two top ASSU
positions. It would be difficult to find time for
a job and serve conscientously as ASSU Presi
dent.
The amount of time that both of these jobs re
quire—Excom meetings, office hours, commit
tee meetings, etc.— would seem to be so great
as to merit some monetary compensation.
