### BILL DAILEY 
Ah ha, Hail, so you thought you were more ob
noxious than your old roomie, Dailey, eh? Just be
cause you received the first nasty letter from the read
ers, you thought you had this little contest all sewed
up, eh? Well, my boy, I've got news for you. Two
days ago I received five postcards from the readers
telling me what an utter jerk I am. Just in case you

don't believe me, I am printing
them below as evidence. Now,
Mr. Hall, who is leading in our
"I 11 Get Mure Nasty Letters From
the Readers" contest? Here, son,
are the latest standings. Read
'em and weep!

'Dear Bill (Please, let's not get familiar.)
J have read in the paper where you are behind in
the nasty letter contest. So I am going to try to write
a:, nasty a letter as my naturally sunny disposition
will poi iilit. lam going to be mean as heck. I will pick
up some little remark that you harmlessly made, and
make out that only a traitor or a Communist could
have been guilty of it. I will say that all your jokes
stink. 1 will hate myself for what I do, but remember
it's only because I know you don't want old J. West
brook Hall to get ahead of you that I am doing this.
Anyhow, I am getting so nearly out of postcard spare
that 1 haven't room for anything really cutting. I
only hope that 1 won't say anything so bad it will
drive you away from the journalism profession and
blight your whole life. . . .
BILL, YOUR JOKES STINK!! AND YOU ARE IN
CAPABLE OF DRAWING THE SPONTANEOUS IN
SULTS THAT JOHN WESTBROOK HALL CAN!!!

Dear Mr. Dailey, (Now, that's more like il , . . a lil
tle respect.)
As a graduate student in political science, I would
like to inform you of a grave error which occurs in
this morning's "Bu'l Session." You ascribe the author
ship of the "Communist Manifesto" to one Groucho
Merx. Actually it was written by Karl Marx during
the 19th century. I never heard of this Groucho fel
low before. Evidently he is an impostor who is taking
advantage of naive people like you. You must learn
to be on your guard against such people.
Trusting that you will retract and correct your er
roneous assertion, I remain
HAMILTON SKREN
P.S. I have a straight A average in all my work
since grade school. Any lime you need help in the
future, jus I ask me

Dear Bill,
You have told us John Hall's middle name. What
is yours Ottokar? (Saaaaaaay, this guy's all right!
He must be a relative of Hall's!)

Dear Mr. Dailey, (Now, that's more like il , . . a lil
tle respect.)
As a graduate student in political science, I would
like to inform you of a grave error which occurs in
this morning's "Bu'l Session." You ascribe the author
ship of the "Communist Manifesto" to one Groucho
Merx. Actually it was written by Karl Marx during
the 19th century. I never heard of this Groucho fel
low before. Evidently he is an impostor who is taking
advantage of naive people like you. You must learn
to be on your guard against such people.
Trusting that you will retract and correct your er
roneous assertion, I remain
HAMILTON SKREN
P.S. I have a straight A average in all my work
since grade school. Any lime you need help in the
future, jus I ask me

Ah ha, Hail, so you thought you were more ob
noxious than your old roomie, Dailey, eh? Just be
cause you received the first nasty letter from the read
ers, you thought you had this little contest all sewed
up, eh? Well, my boy, I've got news for you. Two
days ago I received five postcards from the readers
telling me what an utter jerk I am. Just in case you

don't believe me, I am printing
them below as evidence. Now,
Mr. Hall, who is leading in our
"I 11 Get Mure Nasty Letters From
the Readers" contest? Here, son,
are the latest standings. Read
'em and weep!
Bill Dailey 5 nasty letters
.J. We.st brook Hall.. 1 nasty letter
Ha!

'Dear Bill (Please, let's not get familiar.)
J have read in the paper where you are behind in
the nasty letter contest. So I am going to try to write
a:, nasty a letter as my naturally sunny disposition
will poi iilit. lam going to be mean as heck. I will pick
up some little remark that you harmlessly made, and
make out that only a traitor or a Communist could
have been guilty of it. I will say that all your jokes
stink. 1 will hate myself for what I do, but remember
it's only because I know you don't want old J. West
brook Hall to get ahead of you that I am doing this.
Anyhow, I am getting so nearly out of postcard spare
that 1 haven't room for anything really cutting. I
only hope that 1 won't say anything so bad it will
drive you away from the journalism profession and
blight your whole life. . . .
BILL, YOUR JOKES STINK!! AND YOU ARE IN
CAPABLE OF DRAWING THE SPONTANEOUS IN
SULTS THAT JOHN WESTBROOK HALL CAN!!!
1 only wish I had red ink on this ribbon! 1 won't

Dear Bill,
We think your picture would be even prettier if it

drawn on it. How about a derby hat?
