### 
Several foreign universities will
soon receive from Stanford books
they need in their libraries.
Money from the Stanford Educa
tional Rehabilitation Fund, one of
the beneficiaries of the autumn re
lief drive, is providing these books
to nine universities and libraries in
Germany, Finland, the Netherlands,
Bulgaria, and the Philippines.
SIRO has asked for and received
from these universities lists of the
books they need, and is now en
gaged in filling out and packing the
orders. Students are needed to help
with this work, says Pat Terry,
SIRO co-chairman. She asks any
one who is interested to come to the
SIRO office and work weekday af
ternoons between 3:11) and (i, and
Saturday mornings from 9 to 12
noon.
The nine groups which will re
ceive books under this plan are: the
Universities of Berlin, Freiburg,
Heidelberg, and Kiel; the Univer
sity of Utrecht in Holland; the
Commercial University and the

Students' Library in Helsinki; State
Polytechnic in Sofia; and Lopez
Jaena Memorial College in Iloilo, in
the Philippines.
