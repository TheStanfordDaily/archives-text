# Chuck Taylor to Become Line Coach of SF'49ers
## Undefeated Stanford Frosh Mentor Signs Two-Year Contract with Pros 
### 
Chuck Taylor, Stanford's freshman football coach, intramural
director, rugby coach, and wrestling coach, has signed a two-year
coaching contract with-the San Francisco '49ers professional foot
ball team.
The announcement that the popular Farm football great had

signed to replace line coach Eddie*
Erdelat/,. who has moved to Navy a.s |
head coach, came as a surprise to '
virtually all of the Stanford campus, i
The news of the signing "leaked" I
out Saturday morning, r.o the pro
cluh was forced to make a premature
announcement that day.
Indefinite Status
Whether or not Taylor will remain j
on the Stanford staff until June is I
nut yet known, fie has contacted j
Athletic Director Al Masters, who is]
attending the NCAA meeting in New j
Yolk, for oflicial permission to sign
with the '49ers; but no definite
agreement was made as to whether I
Taylor will stay on until June. Mas- I
tors is scheduled to return to Stan- J
ford later this week.
Stanford freshman coaches are |
signed on a year-to-year basis.
Taylor Happy
Taylor commented, "I've had noth- j
ing but the best of relations with ]
Stanford. I feel 1 have a lot to learn j
about football and this is the oppor- i
tunity to do so."
From the '49ers side came com- i
inent from head coach Buck Shaw: !
"I've been trying to get Chuck on my
side for some time--first in college
and then in pro ball. But now we
are finally together."
No Other Candidates
Other reports from the pro office
have it that Shaw had never con
sidered any other candidates for this
position. Taylor was signed only
four days after Erdelatz teamed with j
the Navy.
Taylor played on the 1940 Stanford
Hose Bowl team and again in 1941 j
and 1942. He was a unanimous All- I
American choice in 1942 and hon- I
orable mention and All-Coast I
choices in 1941.
In his three years a.s freshman
coach, Stanford teams won 15 games
against one tieâ€”that a 14-14 contest |
with the UCLA yearlings in 1947.
