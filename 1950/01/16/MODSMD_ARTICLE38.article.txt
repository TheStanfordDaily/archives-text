# Freshman Cagers Drop Pair to Cubs
## 
### 
Coach Bob Burnett's freshman i
cagers took a double drubbing at
the hands of California's high-rid
ing frosh over the weekend.
The Papooses suffered their sec
ond loss of the current season Fri- !
day evening in the Pavilion as their j
loes gave them a 45 to 31 beating, j
The same process was repeated on j
the following night except that the ;
Cubs gave the locals much rougher j
treatment when the game was held
on the Berkeley boards. Saturday
the t illy showed California SG. !
Stanford 28.
The Cal yearlings are rated j
among the top freshman squads in |
the land so it came as no surprise j
that they should so overpower the j
Indian quintet. Six-foot eight-inch j
Clay Cray, center of Midwest prep !
fame, behaved as was expected on j
the opening night by leading both :
teams to the basket with 15 points, j
Second - stringer Bob Froschle .
dropped in 10 dibits for Cal, and ;
forward Paul Johnson led the Tribe
with nine.
In the second game the Indians
hold the Cubs to a 25 to 22 half- |
time score. The second half was
different, however. So completely j
were the little Indians bottled up in '
the last half of this game that Wade
McClusky's shot from outside the !
key was the only field goal that they !
managed to land during the entire |
period,
Cal guard Tom Greenleaf, who j
landed (J points the night before, I
paced (lie scoring with 18 points,
while Froschle was good for 11.
Guard George Zaninovich headed |
the Indians by tallying 8.
