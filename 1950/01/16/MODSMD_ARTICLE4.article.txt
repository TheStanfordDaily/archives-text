TAIIM'T Formosa The Chinese
Nationalists were heartened today
by the unexpected effectiveness oi
their yY force .md by the now
tion between the United States and
the Peiping Communist regime.
Even critics of the Air Force con
ceded that its new wallop raised
their hopes of repelling an expected
Communist assault on this island
refuge of the Nationalist govern
ment.
High Nationalist quarters also
were optimistic that the Communist
seizure of U.S. consular property in
Peiping might cause Washington to
reconsider and furnish further aid
for maintaining the Formosan re
doubt.
