# Stanford Boxing and Wrestling Teams Drop Matches to California in Friday Night Action
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Stanford's boxing and wrestling
teams, showing promise for the fu
ture, were heavily outscored by
California Friday night in the Men's
Gym on the Berkeley campus. A
partisan crowd of over 2.000 per
sons *aw the Bear grapplers win
by a team score of 23 to 5, and a
repeat by the Cal boxers, who won
nine bouts to one, with one draw.
Th c feature boxing bout of the
evening was a draw decision be
tween Jose Rael of Stanford and
Bill Sapsis of California. The two
welterweights put on a near-profes
sional exhibit, with Rael showing
definite superiority in the closing
minutes of the fight. Sapsis used a
stalking, hard-hitting style which
was fairly effective in the first two
rounds. Rael, the better boxer
throughout, used his dancing, feint
ing, ducking style to advantage.
Hard - fighting Jack Bickel came
through to decision Cal's Bill Kitch
in for the only Indian boxing vic
tory of the evening. Light-heavy
weight Bickel out-punched Kitchin
after flooring the Cal man in the
first round.
Cardinal fight fans—the few that
there were at Berkeley last Friday
—found two decisions hard to swal
low. The first was welterweight
Doug Keith's decision over Stanford
newcomer Karl May. May, though
inexperienced, outpunched and out
fought Keith most of the way.
The second fight in question was
the light - heavyweight battle be
tween Indian Jim Hammond and
the Bears' Vic Corbett in which
Corbett took the decision by virtue
of a strong finish. Hammond showed
his experience and punching ability
particularly in the first two rounds.

i Corbett, tall and gawky, had excep
j tional accuracy with his fast
I punches and finished very well.
The lone official victor for Win
j ston Mumby's wrestlers was Smilin'
I Steve Garst, heavyweight, who
i goodnaturedly overpowered 235-1 b.
Louis Bayuk, California's behemoth.
| Garst couldn't get a take-down on
Bayuk in the first period and vice
versa. Starting from the referee's
J position in the second period, Garst
i quickly pinned Bayuk with a scis
j sors and head lock.
In a preliminary exhibition match,
: freshman Ted Hariton, 145 lbs., de
! cisioned Ray Watson of Cal by a
! score of 5 to 4.
Captain Don Williams was deci
sioned in his 136-lb. battle with Don
Carter, 5 to 4. A new rule, which
prohibits a man to use a waist-lock
I in certain positions, gave Carter two
! points and the needed margin to de
cision Williams.
Other boxing results:
Featherweight and bantamweight
i forfeited to Cal.
Lightweight Jay Savage, hitting
hard and fast, lost the decision to
Cal's Ed Griffin in the third round.
In "another lightweight fracas
Stanford's Bob Baker dropped a
| close one to Lee Sapiro.
I Dick Knezevich, highly touted Cal
! senior welterweight, TKO'd John

Col ton in the third round.
In the middleweight division Bill
Sharp of Stanford was decisioned by
ex-mural champ Bruce Jahnke.
The heavyweight fight, between
Farm mural champ Dave Oberlin
and Cal's 220 - lb. Paxton Beale,
started out as a two-fisted slugging
affair, slowing down considerably
toward the finish. Both fighters
were inexperienced, I tut Bcale took
the decision.
