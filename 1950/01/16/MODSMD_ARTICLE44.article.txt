# Farm Hashing Has Treasured Traditions
## Applicants Selected For Need and Ability 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Hashing has been a tradition at Stanford since a scant two dozen
students served the roughs and coeds of 1898. Today 478 hash
ers, busboys, and dishwashers are employed in women's resi
dences, men's halls, and at the Village, and over 200 unfilled appli
cations remain on file.
Christine Ricker, Director of Dining Halls at Stanford, explained

the Farm hashing program in a re
cent magazine article.
Some of the disgruntled 200 ap
plicants believe that applications are
haphazardly picked from a fish bowl.
Actually a great amount of book
work is necessary, Miss Ricker said,
especially during the summer when
cach mail brings several applica
tions for work the next fall.
Job Assignment
Jobs are assigned partly on need
and partly on the student's ability
to do the work. If the other factors
are equal, priority is given to stu
dents whose applications have been
on file the longest.
"If a student's schedule makes it
impossible for him to work lunches,
for example, it is difficult for him
to get a job regardless of need."
Miss Ricker said. "On the Stanford
campus, possession of a car is no
criterion of need," she added. How
ever. few students who can afford a
new car need hashing jobs.
A number of jobs in each resi
dence are reserved for athletes. To
keep their jobs, however, athletes
must conform to the same rules as

other hashers. Hashers automati
cally fire themselves if they acquire
three AWOL's or are late nine times
— since three lates equal one
AWOL.
Jobs are assigned for only one
quarter, but students are almost as
sured of keeping their jobs if they
do good work. Inefficient or care
less hashers may be dismissed at
any time.
"Work a Meal"
The traditional "work a meal" to
"eat a meal" program is still used J
at Stanford. A hasher works three
meals a day and averages 45 min-i
utes a meal. Howfcver, Miss Ricker I
said, considering the amount of :
work done, this is less efficient than j
having students work a longer pe- ;
riod at one time.
So at the halls where there is j
cafeteria service and in the dish- I
rooms students are now working in j
shifts and there are three separate |
crews —one for each meal. Each j
shift is about 2 1 i hours, and the i
hasher still earns his three meals. |
Application Procedure
All students employed in dining
hails except at the Village and in
fraternity houses are hired through j
the Director of Dining Halls. Miss j
Ricker outlined the application pro- j
cedure.
1. Application blanks may be ob
tained at the Director's office. The I
blanks contain the usual routine \
questions plus a statement of need.
Applications must be renewed each j
quarter to remain active.
2. A class schedule must also be
filled out each quarter so that the j
office may check schedules if a job
falls vacant during the quarter. t

When a student is assigned to
' a job his application goes to the
I fining hall at which he is to work.
At the end of each quarter a rating
sheet is filled out on each student
| employee by the dining hall direc
j tor and the head hashers. Hashers
i are warned if their work is unsatis
f factory. If a hasher is transferred,
.
1 his application and rating bianics go
! to his new employer.
Most hashing jobs are for board,
which costs non - hashers $150 a
, quarter. A full-time hasher works
about 12 hours a week. On week
ends, when the house count is low,
I he may get one or two meals "off"
which he may eat at the residence
i if he wishes.
