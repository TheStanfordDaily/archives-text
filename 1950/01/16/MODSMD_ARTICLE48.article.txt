# Dining Hall Jargon Can Ruin An Auditor's Day
## 
### 
"Sidetowel," "grail," "underline! - ,"
j and "sidestand" are not the newest
j scientific jargon. They are merely
standard equipment of one of the
few groups on the Farm that rise at
6:30 a.m.—the Stanford hashers.
Hashing terms are sometimes un
intelligible. Grails — round metal
bowls into which food is scraped
| when plates are removed from the
table—stymied a University auditor,
j The auditor didn't want to admit his
ignorance and wandered around
j Union kitchen for an hour, looking
for four dozen grails, $2.50 each.
For years University residences
used the very cheap brass opium
I bowls from Chinatown as grails.
AWOL's Deadly
The evil ghoul of all hashers is
the AWOL (Absent Without Leave).
Most AWOL's occur at breakfast
when "alarm clocks don't work" or
"my roommate didn't wake me up."
Few excuses, however, will can
cel an AWOL. One that succeeded
| was given by a bruised fraternity
| man hashing at Roble who hobbled
in late complaining that he had
opened the wrong door and had
| fallen off the sleeping porch. The
most bewildered failure was the
i varsity football player who said he
I had taken a hot shower the night
before and so couldn't wake up the
next morning.
Another iraternity man —a pledge
during initiation week—fell asleep
on one of the couches in the Roble
lobby. He missed breakfast and ac
quired an AWOL.
Ilashcrcttes Wore Lace #
i Hashing styles have changed
j since 181)8. The few women hash
ing then wore lace aprons the size
| of a large pocket handkerchief. To
j day lace has been traded for utility,
i Women hashers at Lagunita and
Branner are attired in enveloping
| brown smocks. Originally the
j smocks were different colors—blue,

green, and yei'ow. This color scheme
was discarded because the hashers
spent too much time deciding which
| color smock to wear. The brown
smock now in use was picked by an
interior decorator because it blend
ed in with the furnishings. Hashers
were not allowed to wear bobby
socks until 1942 when stockings be
came unavailable.
In 1934, when outside activities
wore not listed on a hashing appli
cation, over half the hashers at Un
j ion's public dining room wore from
the Firehouse. When the fire alarm
j rang at (5:15 one evening the hashers
pulled off their white coats and ran
| for the door, leaving the customers
without food. Today hashers are as
i signed to jobs carefully.- A. M. L.
