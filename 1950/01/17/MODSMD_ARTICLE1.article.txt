LAKE SUCCESS, Jan. 16 (/I')
The Soviet bloc walked out of three
United Nations committees today
and clamped a general boycott on
all meetings of the UN anywhere
in the world as long as Nationalist
China is represented.
Persons in high atuhority in the
UN do not feel, however, that (lie
Russians are planning to pull out
of the UN in spite of their walks
from the Security Council last week
and from the three groups today.
They prcdict the Russians will
merely take a vacation until the
Chinese issue is settled.
