# Kaufman's Virtuosity Wins Praise
## 
### 
Accompanied at the piano by liis
attractive wife, Annette, Louis Kauf
man last night brought a refreshing
program of contemporary and clas
sic violin music to the stage of Me
morial Auditorium.
The selections were predominantly
romantic, with the highly-publicized
"Concerto" by Aram Khachaturian
resembling in parts the plaintive
melodies of the gypsy. This was a
less distinguished composition than
might have been anticipated but
Kaufman's rendition was highly ex
pressive and technically accom
plished.
The modern American music for
which Kaufman is renowned consti
tuted the most notable portion of the
recital. He began this section of his
program with the pleasant Hebrew
lullaby, "Raisins and Almonds,"
which was dedicated to him by the
composer, Anthony Collins. Both
that piece and "Allemandc" which
followed, were given in this area for
the first time last night.
Roller), Russell Bennett's "Alle
mande" was a light selection with
tuneful rhythms. The Negro spiri
tual, "Here's One," by William Grant
Still, and the entertaining novelty,
"Hoe-Down," by Aaron Copland,
were also presented.
The colorful "Havanaise" by Saint-
Saens, and Two Romantic Pieces by
Dvorak were the more appealing of
his semi-classical selections. His
notes in "Havanaise" were especially
sharp and clearly defined.
Kaufman's first display of fine vio
lin technique was heard in his sec
ond work for the evening, Schu
mann's "Sonata in A Minor." Here
the vivo cadenzas were outstanding
hlthough the AllfcgreUo and Ap
pasionato movements were less con
fident and distinct.
The violinist returned to the clas
sics for his encores, all of which were
appreciatively received by his audi
ence. "Romance" by Rachmaninoff,
"Hungarian Dance in F" by Brahms,
"Gavotte in E Major" by Bach, and
"Ave Maria" by Schubert were the
final selections.
