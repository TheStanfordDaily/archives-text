# Hectic Rush Weeks Near Conclusion
## 
### 
School will open officially tomor
row night for Stanford's 24 frater
nity pledge classes. After two weeks
of furious rushing most of the Row
houses are nearmg their quotas,
which seem to range from about 10
to 20 p' edges per chapter.
Pledges are scheduled to attend
the annual preference dinner to
morrow night. Then, accompanied
by fraternity officers, they will ad
journ to the Nitery which will be
filled with several hundred fresh
men ready to sign the formal pledge.
From then on the pledges are
binding. The signing of pledge cards
is primarily for the protection of
the Greek-letter fraternities them
selves, Walt Varellas, president of
Interfraternity Council, said. The
new system, ho said, "will prevent
pledge stealing."
Last year the preference dinners
were held on a Friday night, and
then the pledges had until the next
morning to sign on the doited line.
As a result, some last-minute jock
eying switched men from one fra
ternity to another.
If the pledge breaks his pledge,
that is, joins another fraternity af
ter accepting a first one, he will be
disqualified from pledging until
next winter quarter.
Freshmen., who do not choose to
pledge this week can join a frater
nity at any later date. In fact, al
most one-third of the houses have
kept a few vacancies in their pledge
classes so they will have a chance
to look over some of the men more
carefully.
Most of the fraternities have
scheduled parties Saturday night,
although only 16 had received per
mission from the ASSU social com
mittee yesterday.
