						Dangerous Precedent Is Being Set

It is willi increasing apprehension thai we re
rja f(J the recent tendency shown by the ASSU
in use its funds a3 "iisk capital" lor the benefit
of ::üb!.;idiaiy oiqanizations which do nol have
ihe interest of a majority of the student body.
Several situations have come up this year
which may develop into a dangerous precedent
unless the Excom soon makes a definite state
ment of policy concerning the use of ASSU
funds and the ASSU name:
I Last week The Daily recommended that
the Associated Students withdraw their recoq
nition of the Stanford Flying Club as a student
oiqanization unless this group provided itself
with the necessary public liability insurance.
As matters now stand, the ASSU now occupies
the untenable position of a possible co-defend
ant in any lawsuit which might come out of an
accident at one of the air meets in which the
Hying Club participates. The insurance pre
mium should not be paid out ol ASSU funds as
the Flying Club does not merit ASSU support
on the basis of benefit to students.
Last Wednesday night Excom voted G to 5
to back the showing of a ski movie as a benefit
for the Stanford Ski Team. The Ski Team is not
supported by the Athletic Department, and is
dependent upon the Ski Club which is ari ASSU
oiganization. The movie titled "Twenty-Five
Years in Skiing' will be obtained by the Ski
(:iub at a cost of $200.
When incidental costs are added to this fig
ure it means that with a proposed 50-cent plus
tax admission charge at least 450 persons must
see the film before the ASSU can break even.
Any attendance figure below that minimum
would automatically cause a drain on student
body funds.
Excom voted to put the Associated Students
in this "everything to lose, nothing to gain"
position because if it did not, the movies could
not be shown.
The Committee on Public Exercises, which
must review all requests for use of the Me

morial Auditorium, would not approve the
showinq unless it was sponsored by the ASSU
and "rnanaqed throuqh reqular ASSU channels
as an event of significance to the student body
as a whole."
This University committee, in so acting, made
it clear that it would not take the risk of dealinq
witfi a subsidiary orqanization such as the Ski
Club or the Ski Team.
If the University will not assume the risk of
backing such a venture, why should the ASSU?
This is not a good case to demonstrate our
jjoint because the ASSU will, in all probability,
make money by showing this film. Ski Movies
have demonstrated their popularity at Stanford
in the past, and more than 450 people will un
doubtedly want to see this one which we undei
stand is very good.
However, what about the future?
By sponsoring the Ski Club film the ASSU
puts itsell on the spot as a potential backer lor
the business ventures of every organization on
campus. The T" Club, the Crew, Scabbard and
Blade, and the Debate Club will all corne flock
inq to the Associated Students' Office with
business proposals-—some sound, some not
and expectinq ASSU sponsorship. The cause of
all these orqanizations is a worthy one, so if the
ASSU should back the Ski Club, why shouldn't
it back them?
We have pointed out but one of the danqers
of settinq such a piecedent. Others include the
additional book and leq work thrust upon the
already overburdened staff in the ASSU Office,
and the doubtful constitutionality of transfer
rinq profits back to the treasuries of the sub
sidiary orqanizations if any are realized.
Excom has qone on record as backinq the Ski
Club in a business venture, but it is still not too
late to set down a policy for the future. The
Daily that the Associated Stu
dents do not risk funds, which are the property
of all the students, for the benefit of a minority
of students.
