## Sunday Movies 
### 
To the Student Body:
Last week there was some campaigning to get bet
id audience "spirit" aL the Sunday Movies. Thanks
t<> the co-operation of the student body this was
,i< hieved There was no paper throwing or destruc
liveness, yet the old Sunday Movie atmosphere was
maintained. The shouting and screaming is line; it
hurls nothing but the ear drums and vocal cords, and
.till makes for fun.
I hope this quarter's Sunday Movie program will
meÂ«-t with your approval Thanks very much for
youi <o-operation,
