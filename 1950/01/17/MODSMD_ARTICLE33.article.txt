# Fettered Bruin
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The editorial "Fettered Bi nin" in last Tuesday's Daily
includes several factual errors which might give your
traders quite the wrong idea of what has been going
i.n "at Cal's southern branch."
As an interested alum of UCLA, I have followed
this year's developments on the Bruin. As your edi
toi lal indicates, the changed procedure for selecting
the Bruin staff came as the result of a long battle.
But contrary to the impression created in The Daily,
jt was not a battle by "student politicians" to make
the Bruin editors knuckle under. Rather it indicates
that the student body has finally done away with a
e 11-perpetuating system of selection which has per
mitted a clique to dominate their campus newspaper
almost continuously since the war.
Admittedly, at UCLA you will find student poli
ticians of the FiMOC and key-chain variety. But there
u( also student "politicians'' in the strict national
(and international) sense. And it is a group of the
latter variety of politico which has held control of
the paper for their own purposes.
The single slate is a well known device used by a

clique to stay "in" once it gets there. How the news
paper staH is selected is of less moment in a political
vacuum such as Stanford students enjoy. But on a
campus where the daily is a potential sounding board
for militant student "politicians" (in the true sense of
the word) it can mean the difference between good
University public relations and bad.
The UCLA student body has finally become fired of
having its reputation tarnished by a blatant daily
which feeds up a helping of party-line with each issue.
It no longer wants a paper which is a closed corpora
tion. The SEC has changed the selection method to
insuie every interested student a chance to try out
for the paper, no matter what his political views mij'.ht
be.
"Freedom" of the press works both ways. A student
newspaper should be open to all who wish to learn.
When it isn't, then it's time loj a change. That change
has just been made down south.
