# Campus Clippings
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I have been around the Quid off arid on since 1044.
During that time, I have been shorn by a good many
barbers both on ami off campus. 1 scarcely need to
.say thai the on campus clippings have on the whole
been far worse than those from other parts of the
country. I remember one exception to the rule, how
ever: An Idaho barber who insisted on using a soup
bowl.
We pay good money to let these people loose upon us
and the results are often so horrible as to give the hat
industry a sizeable boost. One friend of mine the other
diiy went home from a campus salon and found him
self with one sideburn on and one off. I have never
had quite such an experience myself, but it is quite
annoying to be unable to use a comb with any effect
for a week after being trimmed on tVnad.
I say, these hacker*; must go!
