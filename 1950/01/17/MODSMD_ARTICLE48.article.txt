The campus in general and this reporter in particular were shocked on
Saturday to learn that Chuck Taylor, the workhorse ot the Athletic Depart
ment, had decided to move on to the pro coaching ranks.
My first lecation was that the inevitable had finally happened. A man
with the ability of Chuck Taylor just couldn t be expected to stick around
a college in the position of a freshman coach.
The next thought was that, of course, where else would he have gone but
to the '49ers? Chuck knows the system backwards and forwards. But it
was .still a hard blow to those who still hold hopes of future Stanford foot
ball greatness.
Will Remain Unlil June
That Chuck was (and, by the way, still is—for he will be here until June)
a valuable man to Stanford is easily seen in his list of joljs. He is 1. Fresh
man football coach, 2. Rugby coach, 3. Wrestling coach, 4. Intramural di
rt utor, and 5. in charge of getting the material for future teams into the 1
.S( 11001.
That's a big load in any school. Chuck will be missed greatly in regard
to Nos. 2, 3, and 4; but the great loss will be in Nos. 1 and 5.
Taylor as football coach needs little mention here. His record is great.
But he is the first to admit that three years of unbeaten frosh teams involves
more than a little luck. His value there was in developing preps into col
lege players. His time was spent in fundamentals and teaching the Stanford
(much like the '49er) system.
The last mentioned of the too many jobs Chuck holds is far and away the
most important. It is that of receiving the inquiries from high school lads
and answering same. It means getting the alumni out in the bushes to come
up with a nugget. It means compiling a list of every halfway decent prep
in the state; and then doing your darndest, within the PCC rules, to get
that kid to come to Stanford. It is a 365-day of the year job. It is the most
important job in the whole athletic setup—for without the boys, you just
can't win.

The niun who holds that job at
Stanford has two strikes against
liim when he starts. High tuition and
gh grade requirements knock most
boys out of the running before they
start.
But Chuck is just the man for the
job. Most of the boys are won over
by his personality alone. He gets
along very well with the alumni and
the parents of the kids. This is where
his loss will be felt the greatest.
Yet, we can do nothing but wish
Chuck Taylor the very best in his
new job. He is worthy of it. In fact,
il is with no little pride that this
reporter points to a controversy
.started in this column last quarter.
The man 1 pointed to as the best in
the field to take over the line coach
ing job on the Farm was this same

Taylor. He is an inspirational type of coach—one I think is better suited to
college ranks than pro.
Taylor would be the last to echo the sentiments mentioned above. It is
with deep regrets that he leaves Stanford. But the line coaching job of the
'4!)ers is a step upward—both in prestige and money.
Gain Valuable Experience
Chuck couldn't go much further here at Stanford. With the pros he can
"age in the coaching profession," as he says. It is a chance to gain more
knowledge of the business. The money angle is definitely not the most
important. Experience is the real reason for the move.
Some day, Chuck says, he wants to return to the college field. He is yet
a young man in the coaching ranks. He will be 30 this month. He can gain
valuable experience in the toughest league of them all and come back to
collegiate coaching much the better man.
Coaching is a tough racket. There is no place in it for a man who doesn't
ant to go to the top. You don't go to the top by coaching freshman teams.
And so we say good-bye (football speaking) to the man I rate as tops on
the Stanford athletic staff. He may yet some day come back to Stanford in
a better position. That is my hope. Meanwhile, he will be with us through
spring football and until the pros begin work in July.
Hawaii Trip
Added notes: The Card baseball team is in for a big year. Plans are.
underway to send the squad to Hawaii after finals in June for 8 or 10 games
there. In addition, the team will play the "B" units of the Oak and Seal
organizations. Talks are also underway to bring the Cleveland Indians to
the Farm for one or two games.
Attention, skiers with convertibles: It is against the law to carry anything
on the side of your car that extends more than six inches. Police have been
ticketing some convertibles with side ski racks.
Ex-Card baseballer Dave Dahle and Jeannette Byrd were married yes
terday on the "Bride and Groom" radio program. . . . George Yardley's
parents have been flying up from the Southland to see Stanford home bas-

ketball games. . . . There are 115
mural basketball teams signed up.
This is the largest number in the his
tory of the sport at Stanford. . . .
Early prediction of a mural all-star
team- Bob Swingly, Claude Rosen
berg, Don Stites, Dude Angius, and
Clayton Neill.
