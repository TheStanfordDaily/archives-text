# Sigma Chi's Flatten Fiji Five 34 to 22
## 
### 
Sigma Chi let all their opponents
to come beware that they are a
team to beat in the race for the fra
ternity championship of the rapidly
progressing intramural basketball
tournamnt. The strong outfit
mauled a well - rated Fiji quintet
last night on the Pavilion boards,
Flashy Bob Slobe was definitely
the "Sweetheart of Sigma Chi" as
he racked up nine points to lead his
mates to victory. Eight of these
markers came from field goals, a
couple of which were long shots
from 15 feet out. Dick Kettenburg
tallied seven points for the winners,
chalking up five charity tosses.
The contest was a hard-fought af
fair, although Referee Mike Durket
kept the battle under control
throughout.
Another feature of the game was
the unusual percentage of scoring
on long shots, especially in the first
half. Nearly all the baskets which
accounted for the winners' 18 to 9
half-time lead were due to tosses
from 10 to 15 feet from the nets,
save the free throws.
But the losers were not to be de
nied. Captain Jack Barnes, who led
his side with two field goals and a
pair of free shots, handled a team
which kept a rugged defense going,
thus accounting for the large
amount of long shooting.
