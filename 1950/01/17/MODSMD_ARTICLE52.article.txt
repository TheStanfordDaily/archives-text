TWO OF SANTA CLARA'S best Broncos who will be on hand
Saturday night in the Cow Palace when the Nags go against the
Indians are guard Joe Greenbach, who has distinguished him
self by his outstanding floor play and defensive work, and high
scoring forward Bob McKillop (inset), who was out most of the
1948-49 season with injuries. McKillop turned up this season
with a starting berth, and he has figured in several of the Bronc
wins. The rampaging Santa Clarans knocked over Regis Col
lege last weekend in an overtime affair to add another victory to
the lopsided win-loss record, which includes a highly-successful
two-week Eastern tour.
