# Insurance Checks Not Assignable, Veterans Warned
## 
### 
Veterans Administration warns
that the dividends now being paid
veterans on their GI Insurance are
not assignable under the law.
Dividend checks may not be at
tached as security for indebtedness
due an individual or firm, either.
The warning was issued after the
administration noted that some vet
erans had directed that their checks
be mailed to certain business estab
lishments.
However, the VA states, "No one
has the legal right to withhold div
idend checks from veterans after
receipt, either for the purpose of
procuring settlement of a debt or
for any other reason.
