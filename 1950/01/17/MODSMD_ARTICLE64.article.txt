Wedding bells rang on station
KGO yesterday afternoon for two
Stanford students, Jean Byrd and
David Dahle, who were married on
the "Bride and Groom" radio pro
gram conducted at the Chapman
Park Hotel in Los Angeles.
Today the pair are honeymooning
at the Del Mar Turf-and-Surf Hotel
near San Diego, where they will
stay for a week as guests of the pro
gram's sponsors.
Campus friends of the bride and
groom heard the pre-ceremony in
terview from the living room of
Lathrop House, where Mrs. Dahle
resided last quarter. The actual
ceremony was privately conducted
and took place in the Old World
Chapel at the Chapman Park Hotel.
The bride is a junior in the Art
Department and, like her husband,
is from Alhambra. Dahle, a geogra
phy major, was an all-CIBA pitcher
for the Indian baseball squad last
year. Now under contract to the
Oakland Oaks, he pitched last sum
mer for the Bremerton, Wash.,
Bluejackets. He plans to continue
his baseball career.
Gifts which were given to the
couple by sponsors of the program
included a set of sterling silver,
aluminum luggage, a refrigerator,
several electric appliances, a movie
camera, and two easy chairs. They
drove to their honeymoon destina
tion in a Chrysler Windsor conver
tible, also supplied by the sponsors.
On the air Dahle and his bride
related th incidents accompanying
their first meeting, which was a
kick - the - can game played last
spring among Lathrop girls and
members of Phi Delta Theta,
Dahle's fraternity.
A public proposal was also re
quested of Dahle, who, according to
his own testimony, had neglected to
propose before he appeared on
"Bride and Groom."
Stanford friends of the bride at
tending the ceremony included Miss
Lillian Durham, maid of honor, and
Mrs. Jean Sturtcvant, bridesmaid.
Serving as ushers were Bob Tut
hill and Jim Zwerneman, fraternity
brothers of the bridegroom.
