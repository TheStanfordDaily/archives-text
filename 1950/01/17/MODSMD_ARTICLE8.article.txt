# The 						March of Dimes Appeals for Funds
## Campaign Must Replenish Depleted Treasuries, Assist Polio Research 
### 
The March of Dimes today issued its first appeal for help in 1950.
After a year of the most destructive epidemics in the nation's his
tory, the need for polio prevention and cure is at record height.
Of the 42,000 cases reported during 1949, over one-quarter of
the victims fell in age groups including college students. During

two summer months alone, polio
struck more than four times the
number once considered the normal
total for an entire year.
The 1949 campaign raised $26,000,-
000 and yet the cost of medical care
alone was $31,000,000. Effects of the
epidemic will be felt sharply when
17,000 cases will need continuing
care—in addition to whatever cases
1950 brings in.
Record Ncad
The National Foundation for In
fantile Paralysis is confronted with
a record need at a time when the
field of polio research has never been
more optimistic.
Scientists predict that within three
years they will know which of the
polio viruses, tested on laboratory
animals, are capable of causing the
human disease.
The past year uncovered a method
of growing polio virus in test tubes.
When these two projects arc com
pleted, researchers will be ready to
produce a trial vaccine against all
known types of polio.
Aid to Ke.seait'll
National Foundation research
grants to date total almost $11,000,-
000. An equal amount paid for the
training of over 2,000 persons in pro
fessional fields related to polio.
An estimated 80 per cent, of pa
tients afTlicted in ,1949 were relieved
by March of Dimes funds. At the
epidemic peak, $100,000 a day poured
out as emergency aid to stricken
areas. Long-term treatment is be
yond the means of average families.
Combating the staggering toll of
last year's epidemic was a heavy
drain on the National Foundation's
funds, wiping out chapter treasuries
in 43 states. C<*»*-MYi:ed medical care
and research will depend on the suc
cess of 1950's March of Dimes appeal.
