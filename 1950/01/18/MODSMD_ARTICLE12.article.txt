## 
### 
The age of Ba<?h witnessed an
abrupt revision of musical value. 1 ;
unequaled iu the history of music
until today, according to Dr. Man
fred Bukofzer. Composers of our
era, looking again to Bach's crafts
manship, have overcome what lie
called "the shocking ingratitude of
posterity."
From the pulpit of the Memorial
Church last night, Dr. Bukofzer
compared the rational, stylistic
change of Bach's era to the evolving
musical mentality of our time. Bach
has becomc a modern.
"Conservative be was, but not re
actionary— an activc genius who
brought all elements of Baroque
music to fruition," the Berkeley
professor of music explained.
Bach translated all the newest
achievements in Baroque into his
own musical language. He used
forms with the freedom of a master
craftsman for the well - regulated
recreation of the mind.
"With Bach musical artifices were
not used merely for their own sake.
The strictest musical forms were a
challenge. They arc necessary con
ditions of, but not the reason for,
the quality of his music," the speak
cr said.
It is not complexity as such, but
Bach's imagination, that accounts
for the quality of his work. Unlike
the dramatic climaxes of the Ro
mantic era, Bach's contrasts of vol
ume arc intensive, demanding per
ecptiveness of and participation by
the listener.
Dr. Bukofzer was assisted by
Herbert B. Nanney, University oi
ganist, and Ihe men's section of the
University Choir. Musical illustra
tions included Canonic Variations
No. 2 on the chorale melody "Voin
Himmel Hoch" and "Zion Hears Her
Watchmen's Voices Calling" from
Cantata No. HO, "Sleepers Wake!"
