# Changes in Athletics
## 
### 
Flans (or a wholesale revision of the athletic
set up at Stanlord are now being considered by
the University and by the ASSU.
Attention is being given to a proposal that the
administration of the athletic program be given
back to a Board of Athletic Contiol such an ex
isted at Stanford before the war. At the same
time?, the ASSU has authorized the formation ol
a special committee to investigate the system
ot athletic awaids with a view toward modern
izing the letter award by-laws and setting up a
definite criterion loi distinguishing majoi horn
minor sports.
It is expected that action will be taken on
both ot these proposals before the end ol this
quarter.
11 the plan tor a return to a BAC torm of ath
letic control is appioved, it will have tlie 10l
lov/ing eflects:
1 A board composed ol three students, three
faculty members, and three alumni will be set
up and be given lull control over the athletic
program and the lormation ol intercollegiate
athletic policy. (A similarly composed body
known as tlie Stanford Athletic Council now
exists, but it has only an advisory function and
it meets infrequently.)
This body will be responsible lor the ath
letic budget, and athletic income will remain in
the BAC account to be spent on the athletic pro
gram. (Prolits derived Irom participation in
"intercollegiate athletic events now go into the
University general lund and funds are appor
tioned back to the Athletic Department in ac
cordance with the University budget.)
The athletic stall will be employed di
rectly by the BAC. This body will h§ve the full
s<»y in the matter ol hiring and firing ol coaches,
and should relieve the University ol much ex
ternal pressure in this respect.
A 12 man committee has been authorized by
the ASSU to investigate major and minor sport,
junior varsity, and Ireshman athletic awards.
Changes likely to result out ol this study in
clude the following:
1. A criterion will be laid down for distin
guishing major from minor sports, and certain
standards delined which a minor sport must
meet before it can become eligible lor major
status. Such a set ol reguirements would re
move much of the constant pressure on Excom
from one minor sport or another seeking to
have its status raised.
2. Requirements lor the earning ol athletic
letters will be reviewed, and recommendations
for chanqes made if they are found to be
needed.
The by lav/ on victory awards will be re
viewed with intent ol either presenting the
awards in the future or getting rid of the by-law.

4. The job of making the athletic awards may
possibly be.given to some other group by Ex
com. The Executive Committee should caru
luily determine whether il will continue to
make awards oi whether it would be ad van
lageous to have the job done by some oilier
group more closely connected Willi lire athletic
picture, such as the BAG,
(The athletic uwaids pioLlem will be con
sidered in mote detail in tomorrow's Daily.
The BAC proposal will he discussed Mon
day.)
