# First Application of New Rules on Electioneering
## 
### 
Nominations open at eight this morning for
the lirst all-campus election lo be held under
ihe new set of electioneering by laws passed
by Excom last quarter. Three seats are open on
Men's Council and on Women's Council, and
the final election will be held one week from
today.
During this week each of the candidates will
be allowed to spend $10 m his campaign but
each should be carelul not to run afoul of these
new and relatively unpublicized regulations on
electioneering which now carry severe penal
ties loi their violation.
The new rules represent a compromise be
tween the relatively unrestricted methods of
campaigning allowed for the past Iwo years,
and the "no campaigning" rule sought by some
after the unfortunate electioneering experience
of last spring.
These regulations are designed to allow lire
stimulation of a certain amount of campus spirit
and interest in student government, but at Ihe
same time keep the campus buildings and
walks from looking like an alley fence.
One of the most important of tire new rules
concerns the requirement that an expense ac
count be submitted to the Election Board not
later than noon on Ihe day befoie the final
election. Candidates who fail to turn in these
accounts on time will now be referred to Ihe
appropriate council with a recommendation
that they be given five hours' labor at Ihe Con
Home. Penalties 10/ exceeding the expense
limit or turning in an inaccurate account are
still heavier.
Posters are allowed only on the special
boards provided for that purpose by the Elec
tion Board. Handbills may be circulated only
in living groups. Penalties are provided both
for the candidate and/or for a person who vio
lates these electioneering law? 3 in his behalf.
A copy of the complete rules as well as any
clarification needed may be obtained from Ihe
Election Board.
