Ski Movie Precedent

To the Editor:
Alter yesterday's editorial it seems only fair to pre
sent the other hide of the point in question. (The right
<<1 ASSU to back a ski movie given for the benefit of
the Ski Te^rn.)
The first objection was that the ASSU should not
kike on a project that the University refuser to han
dle It seems to us that where the project is of direct
student concern that is just when ASSU should step
in and the University stop out. We are organized with
a legislative body (Excom) to handle such questions
that are hardly within the practical realm of the Ad
ministration
'the editorial points out that this incident is not a •
one to demonstrate the dangers of "everything
to lose, nothing to gain" ventures, in as much as the
ski movie, being good, will make money. We want to
•tier,:; that the probability of financial success was a
■>ionp deciding factor in considering this project. It
■ t em;; that Excom should be able to examine the pro
pored entertainment and decide whether or not it is a
vale investment. Our interest in the "cause" is only
it it is deserving and needy. Excom did not set a
precedent where they would have to okey each
worthy organization's proposal. They could evaluate
each individual venture with the same scrutiny with
whi h they examined this one.
A tew corrections to tiie editoiial might be stated
here
1 Excom i not backing the Ski Club but the Ski
Team The formei has various sources of income
wtiile th>' luttei depend;, solely on the Ski Club for
its • uppm t.
V. There will not lie additional leg work for the
ASSU Office. The details can and will be handled by
the interested organization.
In summary, we feel that Excom judiciously han
dled an item of student interest, and did not set any
precedent other than its ability to back a benefit or
ganization which has worthwhile entertainment to
nHei tlu* student body.

To the Editor:
At the outset of this letter I wish to make clear: (a) I
uin not, and dc not aspire to become, an airplane

driver; (b) I am entirely willing to ski, provided T am
paid at a rate of not less than $3.50 per hours, and am
covered by employee's compensation insurance.
Recently The Daily stated that the University's le
gal staff had opined (subject, of course, to judicial de
cision) that the University would not be liable for
damage incident to the buzzings of the Stanford Fly
ing Club. The Daily then concluded that the ASSU
might be liable in the same circumstances. No ex
planation of this legal doctrine was given.
Now 1 read with alarm in this momin's editoi ial
that the ASSU is in an "untenable position." I suggest
that if this position (taken thus far only in the mind
of 'Tlie Daily; be untenable, that The Daily abandon it,
or else exhibit legal support for its opinion.
In the course of this same editorial I lind two im
portant questions posed, and it is astonishing that an
alert campus paper could see the answer to neither of
t hem.
If the ASSU has supported the Ski Club movie, how
now will it answer similar requests from other worthy
organizations? flow now indeed Brown Cow! On
the basis of financial risk in such as simple case as
this. "The ASSU will in all probability make money
by showing this film," say the good, grey Stanford
Daily. If it can do the same by exhibiting talking pic
tures of the All-Northern Hemisphere Debate Con
gress Finals then full speed ahead! II not, spare the
support.
The really vital question which The Daily should
know bettei than to ask is, "II the University will not
assume the risk ol hacking such a venlun why should
the ASSU?"
It call and does- happen that there are relatively
special student affairs in which the University has no
legitimate interest, hut in which the students at large
the ASSU do. The interest properly devolving upon
the ASSU can even approach a duty. The Crew is
such a special affair (I also row for $3.50 pei hour).
The problems of supporting particular student ac
tivities are not to be solved either by waiting to see
what the University does or by recourse to precedent,
but by examining the facts and issues in each particu
lar case. If The Daily prefers not to set* Excom exer
ci.se judgment and this accounts for its insistence on
only non-dangerous precedents, let it say so it will
find many supporters but let it say so plainly, not
by implication as in today's paper.
