# Our Linquistic Oddities Baffle Chinese Students
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Too often has the visitor to Amer
ica left the country with a host*of
strange concepts about America.
Why that should he, J don't know.
Being a Chinese who has been
brought up in a predominantly Brit
ish environment; 1 have found my
experiences in America endlessly
interesting.
But, if 1 were called upon to
make some observations on Amer
ica, I would hesitate. I am anything
but an honest observer. 1 like the
country and the people too much,
and therefore may be inclined to
romanticize.
However, there seems to be noth
ing odder than the strange ideas
that most Americans have about the
rest of the world; nothing, that is,
except the fantastic ideas that most
other people have about America.
Most of my friends, who have long
found delight in cup finals, test
matches, and afternoon tea at four,
conceive of America as a country
<>l skyscrapers, murders, and had
taste.
II is a platitude to say that they
are wrong. Perhaps they envisage
the skyscrapers from New York, the
murders from Chicago, and the bad
taste from the coffee.
My friends think of Americans as
a people who almost live in cars and
do atrocious things to the King's
English. Obviously, a few Ameri
cans do riot own cars. And they
don'l claim to speak- "English," but
latliei "American."
My fust encounters with the lan
guage left me dazed. However, 1
know now that a gridiron is not
necessarily a utensil for broiling
food, and that a wolf can be an ani
mal with two legs as well us one
with four.
Careful observation has also
shown me that a person can go to
town without even going near a
city, and lhat football is a game
played mainly with the hands.
It feels strange to be able to spell
"gaol" as "jail" and "cheque" as
"check" without criticism. My for
mer English tutor would undoubt
edly he speechless with rage if he
were to see it.
He is really a jolty fellow, some
what conservative, but a jolly fel
low all the same. He took infinite
pains to teach me his native tongue
In later years, whenever 1 have
chanced to meet him, I have always
tried to say, "I'm frightfully "glad to
see you, old man" in my best Ox
ford accent. I am just wondering
what, would happen if 1 were lo say
to him upon my return from Amer
ica, "lliya, hub, gimme some skin!"
Although there are essential dif
ferences between Americans and
my British-influenced friends, there

ate also striking similarities. For
example, both the groups seem to
enjoy good beer, grumble about
taxes, and get hot under the collar
when discussing politics.

ing odder than the strange ideas
that most Americans have about the
rest of the world; nothing, that is,
except the fantastic ideas that most
other people have about America.
Most of my friends, who have long
found delight in cup finals, test
matches, and afternoon tea at four,
conceive of America as a country
<>l skyscrapers, murders, and had
taste.
II is a platitude to say that they
are wrong. Perhaps they envisage
the skyscrapers from New York, the
murders from Chicago, and the bad
taste from the coffee.
My friends think of Americans as
a people who almost live in cars and
do atrocious things to the King's
English. Obviously, a few Ameri
cans do riot own cars. And they
don'l claim to speak- "English," but
latliei "American."
My fust encounters with the lan
guage left me dazed. However, 1
know now that a gridiron is not
necessarily a utensil for broiling
food, and that a wolf can be an ani
mal with two legs as well us one
with four.
Careful observation has also
shown me that a person can go to
town without even going near a
city, and lhat football is a game
played mainly with the hands.
It feels strange to be able to spell
"gaol" as "jail" and "cheque" as
"check" without criticism. My for
mer English tutor would undoubt
edly he speechless with rage if he
were to see it.
He is really a jolty fellow, some
what conservative, but a jolly fel
low all the same. He took infinite
pains to teach me his native tongue
In later years, whenever 1 have
chanced to meet him, I have always
tried to say, "I'm frightfully "glad to
see you, old man" in my best Ox
ford accent. I am just wondering
what, would happen if 1 were lo say
to him upon my return from Amer
ica, "lliya, hub, gimme some skin!"
Although there are essential dif
ferences between Americans and
my British-influenced friends, there

ate also striking similarities. For
example, both the groups seem to
enjoy good beer, grumble about
taxes, and get hot under the collar
when discussing politics.
Too often has the visitor to Amer
ica left the country with a host*of
strange concepts about America.
Why that should he, J don't know.
Being a Chinese who has been
brought up in a predominantly Brit
ish environment; 1 have found my
experiences in America endlessly
interesting.
But, if 1 were called upon to
make some observations on Amer
ica, I would hesitate. I am anything
but an honest observer. 1 like the
country and the people too much,
and therefore may be inclined to
romanticize.
