# Dons Out for Revenge
## Cards to Face USF on Friday 
### JOHN HALL 
Oh-oh!
USP's dapper Dons, the boys
will) the built-in National Cage
Title, will climb aboard Stan
ford's non-Conference merry-go
round this weekend to meet the
Indians half-way in the feature
attraction of a Cow Palace dou
ble header.
Second hilling on the attraction
v/ill I*- St. Mary's and Santa Clara
who will clash in the Friday night
opener. The next night Stanford
meets Santa Clara, and USF hooks
up with St. Mary's.
The Dons, who ended last season
cs the toast of the Bay Area by win
ning the National Invitational at
Madison Square Garden, are still
'teaming over the fact that their 65-
55 loss to Stanford was the only
serious blemish on their slate.
!Ii 11 topper Spirit High
This time they have vowed to erase
that disgrace with a win oi' their own,
and although USF hasn't been hit
ting on all cylinders lately, the Hill
.oppers will be higher than Hoover
Tower for this one.
A win over Stanford would open
their stretch drive in just the right
way. The Dons will then go on to
meet (JSC and California one week
end hence.
Stanford and USF have one mu- .
tual loe so far this season, that being
UCLA. Comparing their respective
efforts, things don't shine for the
Cards.
USF manhandled the Bruins 53 to
40. but Stanford stumbled around to
a 71-55 defeat.
However, USF has had a few bad
breaks since the sparkler against
UCLA. Don McNamee, their 6-foot,
6-inch center, broke his wrist against
LIU, and is lost lo the squad for the
spqsofi*
Lofgrait To Center
So, Newell was forced to switch
Don Loljiian to center, all of which
affected the USF scoring punch. But,
Ihe Dons still have Rene Herrerias,
Hoss Giudice, Don Giesen, and
Frank Kuzara, a quartet of destruc
tive gunmen, who are capable of
carrying any offense at top speed.
Dean stated yesterday that he
will star! the same team against
USF that opened the second Cali
lornia battleâ€”that's George Yard
ley and Jack O'Stillivan at the for
wards. Ralph Carver at center, and'
Jim Walsh and Hruee Iverson at
the guards.
Dean and the Indians will have as
much as USF at stake, as they will
be protecting a three-year unde
feated record against the Bay Area
independents.


COACHES 808 BURNETT and EVERETT DEAN are viewed
talking things over on the Pavilion hardwood. They led the
varsity through a midweek prep last night getting ready for
the independent crucials against USF and Santa Clara in the
Cow Palace this weekend. Dean hasn't lost to a Bay Area inde
pendent in three years.
