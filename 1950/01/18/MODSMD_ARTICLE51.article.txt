# ON THE SCREEN
## Good Plot, Clever Cast Make 'Adam's Rib' Rate 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Spencer Tracy and Katharine j
Hepburn have romped from parlor ,
to bedroom together in many mov- '
ies, treading easily on a carpet of j
sophisticated dialogue. Never have
they romped so happily (for the au
dience) in "Adam's nib." now
playing at the Varsity Theater.
The highly paid talent of play
wrights Garson Kanin and Ruth
Gordon has juggled an average plot
into a pyramid of frothy dialogue.
Marvelous 'liming
The script is aided by the mar
velous comedy timing of Hepburn,
although the final effect is slightly
spoiled by too much slapstick and
the forced whimsey of an aging
Tracy.
"Adam's Rib" concerns itself with
an assistant district attorney who
prosecutes a woman for attempted

murder of her
unfaithful hus- .
band, and the j
attorney's wife, '
who defends the
woman. Before
the final reel
Lawyer Hep
burn has turned
the court into a

three - ryig circus with Lawyer
Tracy as the angry wild-animal act.
The film is spiced with original
performances by three Broadway
actors â€”Judy Hoiliday, Tom Ewcll,
and David Wayne. They show a

i talent for gesture and pantomime
j that is rarely found in actors
j groomed for stardom on Hollywood
! lots.
Scene Stealer
Holliday, the neurotic wife who
shoots her husband and is then
hungry for a candy bar, easily steals
the one big scene she is allowed.
Ewcll, the unfaithful husband,
brightens up the film with his ex
pert facial expressions, while David
Wayne, as an effeminate songwrit
er, exudes a cynical and suave
charm.
High point of the film was the
"dramatic" scene in which Tracy
neatly turns the tables on his "un
faithful" wife. To me it was one
of the funniest scenes recorded on
film. And "Adam's Rib" is easily
one of the funniest films of 1049.
