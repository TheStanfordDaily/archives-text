### 
The football game between fresh
men and sophomore women planned
for February 17 as part of the Frosh-
Soph Jamboree festivities, may not
be played because of University dis
approval. The reasons given were
adverse publicity and possible in
juries.
The first event of the Frosh-Soph
Jamboree weekend, February 16-17,
will be a football game between
freshman and sophomore men on
Friday afternoon at the frosh foot
tall field. Friday night a dance will
be held al Austin's Barn.
A barbecue at the Sunken Dia
mond on Saturday will be followed
by contests and races, such as an
egg-throwing contest, a sack race,
and tire pull, in the afternoon.
Completing the festivities will be a
Jamboree Ball on Satuiday night.
During an intermission the trophy
will be awarded to the winning class
and skits and class murals will be
presented.
In charge of the Jamboree is Jerry
Smith, assisted by Keith Beekman,
publicity, and Shirley Casella, Jam
boree Ball.
At the Soph Excom meeting plans
were made to revive "Olympic Day."
Sponsored by Cardinals, the"Day"
was last held five years ago. It was
discontinued during the war. All
classes look part in various contests
and a trophy was awarded to the
winning class.
The date for the Sophomore Co
tillion has been set for May 13.
Chairman of the cotillion committee
is Steve Barnett, assisted by Velma
Kennedy and Fred Koenig.
The class is also planning to write
a constitution, said Bud McCord,
sophomore class president. Jim Jen
nings is in charge of the constitution
committee. The constitution will in
clude, besides a general organiza
tion of the class, a better method of
choosing the Soph Excom, instead of
the present method of leaving the
choice up to the discretion of the
president.
