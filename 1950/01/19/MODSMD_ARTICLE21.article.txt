# FARM'S FRATERNITIES PLEDGE 298
## Fiji's Lead With 22; Many Freshmen Postpone Pledging at Last Minute 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Two hundred ninety-eight pledges crowded into the Nitery last
night to sign formal pledges for the Farm's 24 Greek-letter frater
nities.
Although afternoon estimates by the rushing chairmen indicated
the total would approach 315, many of the freshmen decided at

Hhe last minute to wait until later
before making the binding pledge.
Phi Gamma Delta registered 2 '
men to top the list of pledges. Thef <
Delta Chi's pledge class totaled 1!'
And in third place were Theta Chi
and Beta Theta Pi with 18 each.
Average Number
The average number that tho
houses pledged was slightly over 12
Last year 301 signed pledge card:,
after the two weeks' rushing period
The highest pledge count was in 4'i
when 335 signed the dotted linn.
Several pledges who have shown
preference to various fraternitk' •
were not eligible to pledge last night
because of delinquent grades.
others did not sign the pledge card ,
because they had been pledged ear
lier in the year and had been par
tially initiated.
Pledge Later
Many of the fraternities who
; pulled small pledge classes will pick
additional members throughout the
year when they have a better chanc •
to meet them. Rushing chairmen thi,
year felt the freshmen were more re -
1 luctant about rushing into frater -
nities this year than they had in the
I past.
Another explanation for some
small pledge classes might be the
j fact that these fraternities took in
; such large classes last year. Deltn
I Tau Delta, whose 1949 pledge clasj
. topped the Row with 24, accepted
I only 9 this year.
From now on it is illegal for
pledges to break the agreement. Any
freshmen who break their pledges
will be disqualified from further
pledging activities until next winter
quarter.
If the fraternity breaks the pledge,
the man is free to pledge again at
any time.
Last night the houses held prefer
ence dinners for the pledges and after
the formal pledging took place in the
Nitery, many of the fraternities
gathered with their new members to
celebrate what is known as the be
ginning of a lifelong comradeship.
Most Men's Row residences were
so noisy that phone calls to and from
the houses were virtually impossible.
Some of the rushing chairmen
haven't attended classes all week.
The results are evident in the size
of several pledge classes.
Tonight's pledging activities mark
the end of the conccntratcd pledging
season. During the period there were
four nights of open houses and nu
merous parties, beer busts, and
dances.
The advantages of this method of
open rushing include the broadening
of the freshmen's interest in all cam
pus activities. Even if a man did not
( pledge last night he undoubtedly
j made many new acquaintances dur
-1 ing the rushing season.
