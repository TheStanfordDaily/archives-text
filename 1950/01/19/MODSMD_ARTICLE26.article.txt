# Campus Road Conditions
## 
### 
The old familiar chorus of moans and groans
iii>out Stanford road conditions is here again.
And with good reason. The roads are in mis
m.-ble shape.
Over 4,000 cars operated on the campus by
; indents, faculty, and University employees
.ire taking a terrific beating from the chuck
holes and washboards in our roads. The car
owners have every right to wonder why this
situation exists, and what is being done about it.
The road problem lacing the University is
perplexing, largely because it is affected by
conditions over which theie can be no control.
.'itanlord'a roads were never intended to hold
up under the present amount of traffic. The
number ol cars on the campus has doubled in
proportion to the post war increase in enroll
ment.
The weather combines with soil characters
tics peculiar to this area to provide another
problem. Within a few leet the soil beneath a
campus road may vary Irom highly porous
loam to non-porous clay and adobe. Heavy rains
expand the clay; heat contract it. It takes little
imagination to figure out what this process does
to a road surface above.
Thanks to these conditions, maintenance ol
pi e.sent roads alone is an expensive proposition.
The nationwide boom in university enroll
merit lias affected Stanford financially, just as it
has other colleges. Despite increased tuition,
lhe cost of providing housing and academic fa
( iii ties lor a doubled student body and larger
faculty has been terrific. The cost of maintain
ing existing facilities has also increased.
The University made the only practical
( hoice. It decided to provide lor academic and
housing needs first. Existing facilities, of

course, had to be maintained. Immediate road
improvements ol d permanent nature . . , .
adapted to heavier trafiic and soili conditions
. . . . had to be shelved.
However, although the over-all irnprove
ments weie not immediately feasible, the Uni
versity two years ago set up a 10 yeur plan to
do the job little-by little. The resurfacing ol
Galvez from Pine to EI Camino Real is one evi
dence of this plan in operation.
Permanent improvements are expensive.
The University this yeai hopes to resurface Gal
vez from Pine to Alvaiado and Escondido Hoad
in front of Stern Hall. The cost will be $55,000.
Plans are now undei consideration for work on
Panama street lrorn the Union to the Press
Building. The cost is estimated at $14,000.
Improvements on some roads are not prac
tical at this time because their location may be
altered by new roads and buildings now in the
planning stage.
Parking a/eas ctnd sidewalks aie also in
cluded in the 10-year plan, and the paiking
areas west ol Stern Hall and .south of the Chem
istry Building represent part of the post war im
provements.
Where does all this leave us? With miser
able roads that will stay miserable until weather
conditions permit repairs. And a lot of the re
pairs will not last long.
But we are satislied that the University recog
nizes the problem and is making real progress
tov/ard the solution. Permanent improvements
v/ill be carried out under the 10 year plan, as
funds become available. In the meantime the
seasonal job of filling chuck-holes and smooth
ing washboards will have to suffice. -J. 1,.

Where does all this leave us? With miser
able roads that will stay miserable until weather
conditions permit repairs. And a lot of the re

nizes the problem and is making real progress
tov/ard the solution. Permanent improvements
v/ill be carried out under the 10 year plan, as

Over 4,000 cars operated on the campus by

holes and washboards in our roads. The car
owners have every right to wonder why this
situation exists, and what is being done about it.
The road problem lacing the University is
perplexing, largely because it is affected by
conditions over which theie can be no control.
.'itanlord'a roads were never intended to hold
up under the present amount of traffic. The
number ol cars on the campus has doubled in
proportion to the post war increase in enroll

The weather combines with soil characters
tics peculiar to this area to provide another
problem. Within a few leet the soil beneath a
campus road may vary Irom highly porous
loam to non-porous clay and adobe. Heavy rains
expand the clay; heat contract it. It takes little
imagination to figure out what this process does
to a road surface above.
Thanks to these conditions, maintenance ol
pi e.sent roads alone is an expensive proposition.
The nationwide boom in university enroll
merit lias affected Stanford financially, just as it
has other colleges. Despite increased tuition,
