# The 						Problem of Major and Minor Sports
## 
### 
One of the most difficult jobs to be tackled by
the special ASSU Committee on Athletic Award
Revisions, described briefly in yesterday's
Daily, will be that of setting up some sort of a
criterion to help Excom distinguish between
:rw jor and minor sports.
It is essential that such a criterion be estab
lished in order that Excom be spared much of
the pressure that comes from one minor sport
,ind then another to have its status raised to the
Block S class.
Within the last five years Excom has been ap
proached by (1) the swimming team, (2) the
golf team, (3) the boxing team, (4) the rugby
team, and (5) the crew. The first two requests
loi Block S status were approved, the last three
were not.
fn accepting or rejecting ouch demands the
Executive Committee has had little to follow
except its own intuition. Intuition varies, so a
sport that wouldn't stand a chance one year
might find itself in the Block S group the next.
The Rugby team put up a convincing argu
rcent in 1943 and was made a major sport. A
/ear or so later a different Excom had a change
</l heart, and rugby's Block S status was swept
away. As Ted Norton explained to Excorn last
pring ' the rugby team just had a good man
ager that year."
As it now stands football, basketball, track,

swimming, golf, and tennis are recognized as
major sports at Stanford. Eoxing, wrestling,
cross country, fencing, gymnastics, polo, soc
cer, v/ater polo, skiing, rifle team, crew, and
rugby aie recognized as minor sports. A spe
cial Winged S award v/as voted the flying team
last year.
Starting Monday this special 12-man athletic
committee, comprised mostly of major and mi
nor sport lettermen, will spend two weeks con
ducting interviews and poring over a large
amount of information received from other
schools in an attempt to find some common
ground among major sports to use as a criterion
for distinguishing them from minor sports.
Just what standard the committee will adopt
is difficult to say. Spectator interest, participa
tion, amouni of time required, past record of
the sport at Stanford, and opportunities for
scheduling are all possibilities. It should also
be lemembered that a Block S is an incentive
for attracting good athletes to Stanford.
When tire investigation is completed, this
committee will make its recommendations to
Excom. The adoption of such a criterion by Ex~
com may mean that the Block S status of some
sports may be taken away, or it may mean thai
others will be added to this group. The impoi
tant thing is that this rule, once it is adopted, be
applied uniformly to all sports.
