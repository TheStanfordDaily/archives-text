### BILL DAILEY 
IN WHICH WE DISCUSS THE SUBJECT: "Eng
irt*: What a Revoltin' Development!"
(Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of
articles which the eminent psychiatrist, counselor,
;/>i(! part-time bookie, Dr. W. Sigmund Dailey, is
writing on the subject of "Choosing Your Major in
College."
(Last week Dr. Dailey wrote an essay on Lower
l ivision requirements. When the University dis
covered how little he knew about his Lower Divi
•ion work, it promptly rewarded him hy burning his
records and starting him over again as a lirst-fjuar
ter freshman. Undaunted, however, Dr. Dailey con
tinues. . . .)
Today, students, v/e take up the subject of the im-

portance of English to the college
Indent But first, I want you all
Iwrite a 500-word theme on the
übject of "My First Day at Stan
lord." This is a peachy new idea
for your first theme, and I am
sure you will have as much fun
willing your papers as I will have
leading them.
We hall now say a few words
about the subject of grammar.
'I he most important part of gram-

mar is a complete knowledge of the "object of the
pi oposition." Many young ladies on the campus have
> ott.°n into difficulties because they failed to recognize
the true object of the proposition. As a general rule,
tin! object is not necessarily "matrimony." The propo
ition itself usually takes the form of an interrogatory
ntence, but it has been known to result in a jail
sentence.

Now we shall consider the subject of "punctuation
Do you realize the importance of correct punctuation?
Suppose one of the campus coeds was parked (for
shame!) with a young gentleman. The gentleman puts
his arm around the coed, and she says: "Please don't'
Stop!" The gentleman, however, flunked English A,
He thinks the girl has said: "Pleases don't stop!" fie
acts accordingly. This brings us once more to the
.subject of the jail sentence. . . . !
The main value of a course in English lies in the
reading ul the great novels of the past. It is only after
a concentrated study of the better things in literature
that one can appreciate the contemporary writings,
such as the comic strips. Did you realize that the
character in Dick Tracy called "B-O Plenty" was a
direct steal from the novel by Flaubert entitled "Ma
daine B-O-vary?"
In a literature course you will undoubtedly read
that great novel about the explorers wlio search the
entire continent of Africa looking foi a men's room
It's called "The Head-hunters."
You will also peruse that story of the gay sophis
ticated life in New England. It's the tale of the man in
Massachusetts who doesn't take a bath for 20 years.
The title is "Boston Blackie." The hero has so much
dirt on him that he gets fan mail from a gopher
And so we conclude our discussion of "English,
That Grand Old I.ntin Language."
(NEXT WEEK: Di Dai ley runs his artistic fingers
through his silken hair arid comes out with: (1) A
comb which he lost in 1!i46, and (2) the third subject
for discussion, "Music, ah, Music," or "Benny May Be
a Goodman, Put He's Not Hull the Man That Artie
Shaw L!"

Do you realize the importance of correct punctuation?
Suppose one of the campus coeds was parked (for
shame!) with a young gentleman. The gentleman puts
his arm around the coed, and she says: "Please don't'
Stop!" The gentleman, however, flunked English A,
He thinks the girl has said: "Pleases don't stop!" fie
acts accordingly. This brings us once more to the

The main value of a course in English lies in the
reading ul the great novels of the past. It is only after
a concentrated study of the better things in literature
that one can appreciate the contemporary writings,
such as the comic strips. Did you realize that the
character in Dick Tracy called "B-O Plenty" was a
direct steal from the novel by Flaubert entitled "Ma
daine B-O-vary?"
In a literature course you will undoubtedly read
that great novel about the explorers wlio search the
entire continent of Africa looking foi a men's room
It's called "The Head-hunters."
You will also peruse that story of the gay sophis
ticated life in New England. It's the tale of the man in
Massachusetts who doesn't take a bath for 20 years.
The title is "Boston Blackie." The hero has so much

leading them.
We hall now say a few words
about the subject of grammar.
