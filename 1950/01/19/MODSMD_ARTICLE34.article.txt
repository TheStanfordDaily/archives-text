# Stanford Officials Fight Lifting of Hunting Ban
## 
### 
Stanford University this week
voiced its opposition to State Fish
and Game Commission proposal to
lift the hunting restrictions on the
school's campus.
At a hearing in Palo Alto Monday
the State Commissioner listened to
the arguments of Game Warden Ted
Holladay and ten Stanford scientists
and staff members.
Fish and Game Warden Holladay
declared that no adequate patrol of
the region is possible and that a
closed refuge is unnecessary.
Citizens from thÂ«- Portola Valley,
tenants living on Stanford-owned
land, and natural history students
all testified against (he Commis
sion's proposal. About (if) persons
attended the meeting to support the
University.
They asserted that there are riot
enough deer in the vicinity to do
annoying damage. Without any
means of protection, children and
students doing research work would
be in danger of losing their lives,
they said. Many outside organiza
tions also use the grounds for study,
including the Scouts, wild life study
groups, anil the Audubon Society.
Final judgment will be made nexl
week at a meeting of the whole
Commission in Los Angeles.
The case as it now stands is a

question of jurisdiction. A survey
made recently by a University of
California professor has started a
series of hearings on the subject.
Warden Holladay wants the patrol
of the region taken out of his hands.
If he is successful, Stanford will
have to apply to the county for aid
in securing anti-hunting laws.
