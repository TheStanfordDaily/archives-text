# Rushing at End, Campus Culms
## Newest Pledge Class Rated One of the Best, Houses Say 
### WALLY WHITE 
The storm of open houses, dinners, lunches, and rushing parties
which swept the campus the past two weeks has come to an abrupt
end. The wind has calmed, and Stanford social life is settling back
ifhto its normal routine.

' During these two weeks, the Stanford freshman has made a

dec •ision which will affect his entire"
Hfe: he has dccidcd to become, or
Sot to become, a fraternity man.
■owever, the story is not completed,
jjjincc houses normally continue
.{pledging throughout the year. In
Addition, pledges sometimes "de
pledge."
The freshman (or sophomore or
junior) who last night selected fra
ternity life will find that the word
is not an exaggeration.
.The fraternity is a place of close as
sociations. In his three years with
4hc same group of fellows, he will
build life-long friendships; he will
undoubtedly face situations requir
ing much tact and understanding.
Brotherhood Takes Time
In return for friendships, social
activities, good cooking and a place
he can call home, the fraternity man
.will give a lot of his time. The
pledge usually spends his first year
of residence doing daily or weekly
.-housework. As he gains seniority,
the fraternity man has less compul
sory work to do. but is always ex
pected to take part in house activi
ties—dances, floats, and intramural
teams.
,4 Fraternities lay the groundwork
Jor much of Stanford social life.
Jpvery house holds an annual all -
.Campus dance. Firesides, dinners,
and other private dances arc held by
'some fraternity each weekend. Big
Game Night, every fraternity takes
to the hills or to "The City' for a
night of celebration.
Stanford's 24 fraternities are
chapters of national organizations.
All these are members of the Na
tional Intcrfraternity Conference.
Nationwide Values
A member of a national fraternity
may travel to any college where his
group has a chapter and will find
there food, lodging, and hospitality.
Moreover, the fraternity graduate
may find his business relationships
aided by meeting brothers from
1 ' other schools.
Fortunately, the word "barbar
ian," used as a sign of social stigma,
ijS unknown at Stanford. Many of
the school's leaders are non-frater
■Viity men. In this, Stanford is
unique. Its fraternities play an im
portant, but by no means all-im
portant role in school activities.
■ The greatest problem now facing
Farm fraternities is that of schol
arship. At the end of fall quarter,
only four fraternities claimed grade
point averages equal to or above
the all-men's average. The Inter
fraternity Council is concentrating
• its efforts on this problem this year
and is urging the active co-opera
tion of all fraternity men.
In the words of this year's Inter
fraternity Magazine:
"In the sixty years of their exist
ence at Stanford, fraternities have
been faced with problems as chal
lenging as those they face now and,
without exception, they have been
able to find a satisfactory solution,
if They have no intention of weaken
>;ing now."
