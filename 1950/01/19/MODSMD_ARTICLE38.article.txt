# IFC Chairman Welcomes Pledges
## 
### 
Although the big rush is over, a
number of pledge classes still re
main unfilled. Thus, rushing will
continue through the rest of this
quarter and during the spring. In
the coming months many men who
were missed during the formal sea
son will have numerous opportuni
ties to join fraternities.
To the many men we have had
the pleasure of meeting, best of luck
throughout the years ahead of you
at Stanford.
To those who have joined us,
please accept our warmest welcome.
