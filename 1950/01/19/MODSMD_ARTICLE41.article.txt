# Eating Clubs Submit Plans
## 
### 
Eating clubs stored another
point in their fight for a building
of their own with the announce
ment that the matter will be sub
mitted to the Board of Trustees
today.
The clubs' plans arc set forth in
a detailed report presented to Dr.
Wallace Sterling, University prcs
dent, last October. Today Dr.
Sterling will offer the report to
the Board.
"There is still a long way to go,"
said Sargc Littlchalc, Inter-Club
Council president, who conferred
with Dr. Sterling Tuesday. "The
report will be sent to committee
first, then it will be taken up by
the Board. Our biggest problem—
financing—still is not solved."
