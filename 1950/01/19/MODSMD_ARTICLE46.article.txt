# BATING CLUBS
## Quotas Still Open; Plan To Pledge Total of 75 Men 
### WALLY WHITE 
Stanford's seven eating clubs, their rushing program less formal
and less furious than fraternity rushing, will continue taking new
members until quotas are filled.
A total of about 75 men will be pledged, reported Sarge Little
hale, Inter-Cldb Council president.
"This year's rushing program has proven very satisfactory," he

said. "We arc pleased so many men
are interested." Formerly, eating
club rushing was deferred until fra
ternity rushing was over. This year,
however, the elubs held their open
house in the middle of the fraternity
campaign.
Members of any class may join one
ol the eating clubs- El Toro, Los
Arcos, El Cuadro, El Capitan, El
Campo, El Tigre, and Breakers. Also,
there are no grade-point qualifica-
I ions.
Freshmen who want to be invited
to out with one of the clubs are asked
to talk with their sponsors, who will
arrange the invitations.
Ik'sid< s eating together, club mem
ber,'. bold firesides, picnics, and other
parties, and compete in intramural
play.
If present plans become a reality
and the clubs are allowed to begin
construction on a building of their
own, tin (-roup:, wiil resume the sta

tus they held before the war. Then,
three clubs had their own buildings
and the four others occupied separate
rooms in Encina Commons. The
structures were torn flown during
the war.
The building report, which will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees
today, was prepared last year under
the direction of William H. McPher
son, chairman of the Executive Board
of the Eating Club Building Com
mittee. It provides for an L-shaped
building containing separate kitch
ens, dining rooms, and club rooms
for all seven organizations. Cost is
estimated at $135,000.
Eating clubs offer the benefits of
club membership and companionship
without the rigid ties of fraternity
life. They have been a part of Stan
ford life since 1911, when Los Arcos
was founded.
