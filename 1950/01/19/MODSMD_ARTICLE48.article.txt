## On The Bench 
### 
I 1
The Bench liiisn i been hit by a blast ol shotgun squibs .since last year,
when I discovered it was easier to write all on one subject. Today, being
only 70 days I'jom April Fool's Day, we'll play a little jump rope around the
.Stanford Sports Loop.
Stanford's generally youthful liuitch of basketcers, who looked so rot
leu losing lo Cal hint Friday, and who looked so great heating the same
hatch of Hears the i:«*xt night, are (he proud possessors ol the most inter
esting statistics I've seen to dale. In the 111 games played so lar, the Cards
have won six, lost seven. They have scored il(l2 held goals to their oppo
nents' Ml. The Dcanmcn have attempted 2(i(l free throws to their oppo
nents' 2li!l. and cashed in on HiO to ItiO hy the foes. In the personal foul
departmenl, l!in Ited has committed 22.'! to the enemy's 224. Scoring has
been 7t> I for Stanford to 7(i2 for the various opponents. Even, huh?
'I he orchid of the week, and perhaps oi the year, goes to (ats ( havalas,
co-captain of the local cagers. Cius lias been ofl his game this quarter, after
!<.<>). i111• very good in the early games. He and Coach Dean had a talk about
i! and Gijs in effect benched himself on the grounds that he didn't de
•ei ve a starting berth until his bounce ball picked up. While riding the
planks, instead of pounding them, Gus Coach Dean tells me lights and
roots" just as haul as any man on the floor, and ii that isn't great athletic
spirit, I don't know what it is.
( oach Ited Sanders, of LJCLA, aftc i the long dickering with Miami, finally
accepted (last fall no news item) a 10-year coaching contract with the
Ittiiins. at a reported $10,000 per year 1 . This qualifies him as the lootball
coach with the .second--best deal on the Coast. First best belongs to Jim
Aiken ol Oregon Aiken's son is marrying the daughter ol the president 'if
the university. . .
(«ar\ Keiiutiian, the Red Machine's flashy sophomore quarterback, is
u ing the vs i111« i months lo try to improve fii■ • passing which was excellent
I. ; I year, anyway. Kei koi kiii is working on a more overhand motion a la

AI Masters, director of athletics, graduate manager, etc., is probably the
most traveling man on the Farm. This month Masters journeyed from
Hawaii to Stanford. Iroin Stanlord to Washington, D.C., (I'm a meeting of
tla American Olympic Association), from Washington to New York (the
NCAA meeting) and back to the Farm lie returns to face at least
tliiee tidy problem' A leplacemeul lor the near-ii replaceable Chuck Tay
lor To BAC oi not to LAC. And the regular mid-winter hue and cry about
.Stanford sub- par athletic plant.
The athletic problem is one that, has been moaned about by sports writers
and riiji'hi" (more privately) since the days ol Kay Lyman Wilbur. 'I he
lacl that Stanford's basketball Pavilion i; woefully inadequate has been
painfully obvioir- to everyone from Big Jim down to the lowest Encinaite.
Sports Editor Jawn Brier complained about the lack ol adequate man-on
the street basketball facilities. Somebody else pointed out that the Farm
doc, not have out handball court. A normal school would have five or six.
Anil then there is (he trackman's nightmare. Stanford has, in Angell
Field, one of the hest and fastest (racks on (he Coast. It is a great point
loi spectators to watch meets, because it is small enough for good view,
lint the field, which was built at the cost of $211,000 —way hack when that
was real money -is useless except for a practice field and for Irosh meets.
Why? No bleachers, of course. I tie important track meets must be held in
the Stadium which. Coach Jack Weici shauser says, as far as fail participa
tion is com ci licit is 'iike competing in a graveyard,' The Stadium is also
a natural wind tunnel, which also adds its hit (o touting up the works.
Thus we have Stanford, with the best and worst tracks on the Coasl. We
u-e the worst track for our most important meets because nobody has gotten
to work on a bleaches-building project.
Many pt oplt think that the financial advantag.es ol a BAC system would
o a long way to solve this mess.
Others think that a little more organi/ation and a little more delegating
d authority within the Athletic Hepartiiicnt itself might help. That is. they
think there are too few people doing too many jobs. I don't exactly know
the solution —but I may try lo find out.
Dis ami Data. Beet lor the Betas who jobbed most of the Frosh grid team
into their P-class. . . . Hah for Harry the Iloopster, who scored against Cal
Saturday. . . Hill Larson, the red-haired ex-Stanford pole vaulter, is now
leaching General Science at Sa:i Mateo. . . . Freshmen, by some quirk ol
rule making, are now eligible for Varsity Rugby no more applications,
phase. . . Grid fullback Bill DeVoung is once more carrying the ball,
ibis time on the rugby field. . . . Other gridders turned ruggers are Boyd
Benson. Joint Banks Wes Poulson,, Jess Cone, and Dick Lucas. . . . Note
lo Varsity Cagers: Beat CSF. Which ends the column in a eheeful note.
