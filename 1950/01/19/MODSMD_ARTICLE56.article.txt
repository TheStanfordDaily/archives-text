# Dean Undecided on Indian Defense; Yardley, Lofgran Set for Scoring Duel
## Cards Battle In Cow Palace 
### JOHN HALL 
To zone or not to zone.
That's the question facing Stan
ford's cage Indians t his week as
they prepare for their independent
clashes against USF and Santa Clara
toomrrow night and Saturday in
Frank Walsh' Cow Palace.
Last week the surprise shift to the i
zone defense enabled the Indians to
come back with a second-night win j
over California and pick lip their
first Southern Division victory, but
whether they'll stay in the zone
for USF's Don is a pending mystery.
Everett Dean wants to keep
USF Coach Pete Newell guessing. !
He stated yesterday that "Stan- !
ford might use a zone, a man-to
man, or a combination of both"
against the Dons.
Dean may be hoping to repeat last
year's effort when the Cards opened
against USF with a zone, then i
changed to a man-to-man alter the j
first eight minute, and finally con
fused the Dons so much that Stan
lord romped on to an impressive j
65-55 win.
That was the game which was
billed as the contest for the mythi
cal title of the Pacilie Coast, as
Stanford's l!J-2 and USF's 14-1 rec
ords were tops in the area at that
time. Neither team has done :rs well j
this season.
lint, the Dons will be eager to
atone for last season's setback, ;
and the Indians will be deter- i
mined to protect their unbeaten
record against the independents.
All of which should add up to
treating the lop battle of the Cow
Palacf season.
It should also feature one of the
top individual battles of the 11)50
season, starring USF's Don Lofgran '
and Stanford's George Yurdley.
Lofgran and Yardley, key re- '
bound men and scoring threats for j
their respective teams, are the two I
best individual performers in the i
area. When they met last season, j

Managers an* needed for the
baseball team. Anyone interested
is asked to contact John lYfaynurd
at the I'hi Kappa I'si house.

Yardley gained a slight edge, with
a 20-point performance compared to
Lofgran's 9.
This season Lofgran leads the
Dons with 141 points in 11 games
for an average of 12.8 per. Yardley
tops him with 198 points in 13 games
for 15.2 per.
The Dons boast an edge in team
victories, having run up 7 wins
against 4 losses, while Stanford is
struggling with C> wins and 7 losses.
Santa Clara's record is better than
either, as the Broncos have quietly
put together a !)-."! season mark. So
it would appear that the Deanmen
are in for a rugged run.
USF hasn't got a tall team, Lof
gran being the only giant at G-6. but
the ball - hawking midgets, Frank
Kuzara (5-10) and Rene Herrerias
(5-9) are plenty tough. So are the

Don forwards, Don Giesen (fi-0)
and Millan Metiko: h (0-1).
Santa Clara will he paced Sat
urday night hy Napa's George
Stein, who started warming up
last week against Regis College
when he pumped in '»0 points In
vault into the second spot in the

Cow Palace scoring derby.
Bob McKillop i.s another Bronco
bomber whose 11. G scoring', average
has helped Santa Clara beat such
opponents as California (<»()-47),
Manhutten, Temple, St. Mary' ami
John Carroll.


HUSTLING JIM WALSH, whose 46 points in four games places
him fourth in Southern Division scoring, will go again from the
guard spot this weekend. Walsh was shifted to guard last week
when Everett Dean juggled the lineup for the Cal series. He
immediately got acquainted with his new job with 22 points, the
highest two-night total a Stanford guard has posted this season.
