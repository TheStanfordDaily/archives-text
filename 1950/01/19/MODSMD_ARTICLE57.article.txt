Tennis matches have always been
I rather confusing events to this re- ,
porter. The subject has been aired
by several of the Bay Area writers j

The question is this: Why .should
: tennis—and golf. for that matter—

spectator is asked, nay, forced, to
remain quiet and orderly except for
I short, approved bursts of applause?
In other sports we are allowed
to rant and rave, call the contestants j
j "thugs" or "gangsters," and in gen- |
| era! show our approval or disap
j proval at the actions before us.
But the tennis public, in the Bay
Area anyway, seem to not mind
this enforced silence and have been
packing the houses in the recent
Kramer - Gonzalez matches. Else

a smile and said, "On with the
