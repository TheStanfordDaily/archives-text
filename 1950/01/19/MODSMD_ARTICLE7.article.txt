# Excom OK's $200 Spring Show Prize
## 
### 
Ram's Head was given per
mission to offer a $200 prize for
the script used in the Spring
Show by Excom last night.
Students presently enrolled and
recent graduates arc eligible for the
prize. Scripts received from other
persons will be considered, but no
prize will be awarded if one of their
scripts is used.
Student Manager John Lilienthal
argued that a $200 payment for the
script would seem to give an unde
sirable commercial tinge to the mat
ter. He said that school was not the
place to expect a cash reward for
such efforts.
Prize Attracts Writers
Ram's Head members pointed out
that a larger number of entries were
received last year when a prize was
offered than in 1048, and' Commented
that offering such a prize each year
might attract Letter writers to Stan
ford.
Writing a good show may take 240
hours or longer, it was pointed out,
and the incentive of a $200 reward
might prevent writers from becom
ing discouraged and not completing
their scripts.
Dan Stone, chairman of the Union
Planning Committee, discussed the
progress of the committee's work
this year. Questions of location and
financing and the problem of co
ordinating the committee's work
with University planning were con
sidered.
Red Cross Talent Show
Excom accepted an offer from
Lucky Stores of a prize for the win
ner of the Student-Faculty Talent
Show, to be given at the conclusion
of the Red Cross Drive.
February 6 was approved as the date
for a NSA forum on "Federal Aid to
College Education," to be given in
C-Ã¼bberley Auditorium. Student or
faculty speakers' will be chosen to
present each side of the question.
Janice Robertson was appointed
NSA co-ordinator, succeeding "Tim
my" Levinson.
Excom also voted that elections be
held next Wednesday, not February
I; approved a $246 budget for the Ski
Movie; decided to continue the poli
cy of not allowing Kings or Queens
for Big Game or other events; and
approved the Social Policies Com
