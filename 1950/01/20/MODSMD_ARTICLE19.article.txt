# Casa Granada Leads Women In Scholarship
## 
### 
Casa Granada of Lagunita Court
was awarded the AWS Scholarship
cup by Miss Elva Brown, chief coun
selor for women, at AWS meeting
yesterday for a grade point average
of 3.05.
Trailing a close second with a 3.01
average was Casa Espanola, the
Spanish house which was started last
year. Casa Adelfa was third with
2.94, Durand House fourth with 2.90,
and Casa Naranja fifth with 2.88.
Grade averages of the various liv
ing areas are as follows: Ventura,
2.83; Union. 2.73; Branner, 2.59;
Row. 2.65; Lagunita, 2.87; and Ro
ble, 2.61.
The Roble average is not accurate
because the grades of approximately
25 women taking independent, study
in Western Civilization were not
counted.
Persons taking independent have a
"B" average or higher. Thus, Roble's
average is lower than it should be.
Miss Brown explained that last
fall's average is the best academic
average Stanford women have ever
had. Only 23 women out of 1,500 un
dergraduate women on campus are
now on probation However, quite a
few women are minus between 5
and II and Miss Brown stressed the
fact that it was the responsibility of
the house president to set an atmo
sphere for higher academic stand
ards.
