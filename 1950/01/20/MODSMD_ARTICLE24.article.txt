# Rejuvenated Cardinals Ready for USF Dons
## Tip-off Time Set For 9:15 Tonight At SF Cow Palace 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's new Indians, at
tempting to add a few more
goodies to their bag full of inde
pendent cage victories, will run
into the revenge-minded USF
Dons tonight in the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace.
Tipoff is set for 9:15 p.m., with the
preliminary attraction between Santa
Clara and St. Mary's scheduled to
start at 7:45.
Tomorrow night the teams switch
partners, Stanford meeting Santa
Clara in the 7:45 opener, while USF
and St. Mary's will mix it up in the
afterpiece.
Crowd Expected
Smiling Frank Walsh is expecting
his largest crowd of the season to
night to watch USF's national tour -
ney champs try to even an old scorc
with the Indians.
Last year the Tribe handed Pete
Newell's cagers a G5-55 setback, their
worst licking in 25 starts.
The Dons, who have put together
a nifty 7 wins in 11 starts, will be
led into action by the 6-foot, 6-Lnch
center, Don Lofgran.
Star Center
Lofgran is the only big boy in the
San Francisco lineup now that Joe
McUamee has been sidelined for th<>
season with a broken wrist.
The Don attack will be built
around forwards Don Giesen and
Milan Metikosh, center Lofgran, and
the colorful guard combo of Frank
Kuzara and Rene Herieiias.
Everett Dean will try to handcuff
these men with the same five he
started against California. Bomber
George Yardley and Jack O'Sullivari
will handle the front line, Ralph Car
ver will be back in the key, and Jim
Walsh and Bruce Iverson will work
from the guards.
Vets Sit Out
The two old vets, Marv Gelber and
Gus Chavalas, will continue to ride
t.he bench. "Ghfcwalate appears to
have hit a stale streak," said Dean
"We'll rest him for a while and then
see how he looks when he gets back
into action."
Asked about Gelber, Dean stated
that, "At this time Gelber has just
been beaten out."
Dean also added that "Jim Ram


ROSS GIUDICE, last year's watch-charm guard, got a little rusty
this season and was beaten out of a starting job by flashing Frank
Kuzara. But, little Ross was one of the USF cagers who vowed
to whip Stanford next time they met, after the Cards doused the
Hilltoppers by 10 points last season. Ross, USF, and Stanford
will all get together tonight in the Cow Palace at 9:45.
stead is still a toss-up with Ralph
Carver for the starting pivot job."
Seeing that Ramstead is a San Fran
cisco native, Dean figures that maybe
he'll go better in familiar surround
ings. But, Carver looked too good
against California to be taken out of
the lineup.
If Ramstead did get the nod, it
would mean that Stanford would
have three sophomores on the start
ing quintet—the others being Bruce
Iverson and Jim Wabh.
Both USF and Santa Clara have
better season records than Stanford,
the Broncos being tops with 9-13 so
far along.
Ray Pesco's Broncos have passed
the halfway mark in their current
campaign and have already won
more games than the entire season
last year in which they managed only
an 8-23 record.
Leading reason for their improve
ment is the now blading George
Stein, who was oidy an alternate
center last year. Stein has boomed to
130 points in 12 games, for an aver
age of 10.9 per tilt this season.
Bob McKillop is still the Broncos'
most consistent flipper, having
dunked 139 in the 12 outings for 11.G
each time.
McKillop and Stein will be backed
up by Joe Greenbach, Bob Sunder
land, and Jack Nalty.

DANGEROUS DAN LOFGRAN,
who leads USF scoring with 141
points in 11 games for a 12.X av

Most of the Dons' hopes for vic
tory hinge on the outcome of the
Lofgran-Yardley duel.

an 8-23 record.
Leading reason for their improve
ment is the now blading George
Stein, who was oidy an alternate
center last year. Stein has boomed to
130 points in 12 games, for an aver
age of 10.9 per tilt this season.
Bob McKillop is still the Broncos'
most consistent flipper, having
dunked 139 in the 12 outings for 11.G
each time.
McKillop and Stein will be backed
up by Joe Greenbach, Bob Sunder
land, and Jack Nalty.
Tonight's lineups:
STANFORD pos. USF

O'Sullivan (6) 112. (6-1) Metikosh
Carver(6-4) c. (6-6) Lofgran
Iverson (6-1) .g. (5-10) Kuzara
Walsh (6-4) g. )5-9) Herrerias


DANGEROUS DAN LOFGRAN,
who leads USF scoring with 141
points in 11 games for a 12.X av
erage, will try to match points
with Indian George Yardley to
night in a battle of the boardmen.
Most of the Dons' hopes for vic
tory hinge on the outcome of the
Lofgran-Yardley duel.
Stanford's new Indians, at
tempting to add a few more
goodies to their bag full of inde
pendent cage victories, will run
into the revenge-minded USF
Dons tonight in the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace.
Tipoff is set for 9:15 p.m., with the
preliminary attraction between Santa
Clara and St. Mary's scheduled to
start at 7:45.
Tomorrow night the teams switch
partners, Stanford meeting Santa
Clara in the 7:45 opener, while USF
and St. Mary's will mix it up in the
afterpiece.
Crowd Expected
Smiling Frank Walsh is expecting
his largest crowd of the season to
night to watch USF's national tour -
ney champs try to even an old scorc
with the Indians.
Last year the Tribe handed Pete
Newell's cagers a G5-55 setback, their
worst licking in 25 starts.
The Dons, who have put together
a nifty 7 wins in 11 starts, will be
led into action by the 6-foot, 6-Lnch
center, Don Lofgran.
Star Center
Lofgran is the only big boy in the
San Francisco lineup now that Joe
McUamee has been sidelined for th<>
season with a broken wrist.
The Don attack will be built
around forwards Don Giesen and
Milan Metikosh, center Lofgran, and
the colorful guard combo of Frank
Kuzara and Rene Herieiias.
Everett Dean will try to handcuff
these men with the same five he
started against California. Bomber
George Yardley and Jack O'Sullivari
will handle the front line, Ralph Car
ver will be back in the key, and Jim
Walsh and Bruce Iverson will work
from the guards.
Vets Sit Out
The two old vets, Marv Gelber and
Gus Chavalas, will continue to ride
t.he bench. "Ghfcwalate appears to
have hit a stale streak," said Dean
"We'll rest him for a while and then
see how he looks when he gets back
into action."
Asked about Gelber, Dean stated
that, "At this time Gelber has just
been beaten out."
Dean also added that "Jim Ram


ROSS GIUDICE, last year's watch-charm guard, got a little rusty
this season and was beaten out of a starting job by flashing Frank
Kuzara. But, little Ross was one of the USF cagers who vowed
to whip Stanford next time they met, after the Cards doused the
Hilltoppers by 10 points last season. Ross, USF, and Stanford
will all get together tonight in the Cow Palace at 9:45.
stead is still a toss-up with Ralph
Carver for the starting pivot job."
Seeing that Ramstead is a San Fran
cisco native, Dean figures that maybe
he'll go better in familiar surround
ings. But, Carver looked too good
against California to be taken out of
the lineup.
If Ramstead did get the nod, it
would mean that Stanford would
have three sophomores on the start
ing quintet—the others being Bruce
Iverson and Jim Wabh.
Both USF and Santa Clara have
better season records than Stanford,
the Broncos being tops with 9-13 so
far along.
Ray Pesco's Broncos have passed
the halfway mark in their current
campaign and have already won
more games than the entire season
last year in which they managed only
an 8-23 record.

Asked about Gelber, Dean stated
that, "At this time Gelber has just
been beaten out."
Dean also added that "Jim Ram


ROSS GIUDICE, last year's watch-charm guard, got a little rusty
this season and was beaten out of a starting job by flashing Frank
Kuzara. But, little Ross was one of the USF cagers who vowed
to whip Stanford next time they met, after the Cards doused the
Hilltoppers by 10 points last season. Ross, USF, and Stanford
will all get together tonight in the Cow Palace at 9:45.
stead is still a toss-up with Ralph
Carver for the starting pivot job."
Seeing that Ramstead is a San Fran
cisco native, Dean figures that maybe
he'll go better in familiar surround
ings. But, Carver looked too good
against California to be taken out of
the lineup.
If Ramstead did get the nod, it
would mean that Stanford would
have three sophomores on the start
ing quintet—the others being Bruce
Iverson and Jim Wabh.
Both USF and Santa Clara have
better season records than Stanford,
the Broncos being tops with 9-13 so
far along.
Ray Pesco's Broncos have passed
the halfway mark in their current
campaign and have already won
more games than the entire season
last year in which they managed only
an 8-23 record.
Leading reason for their improve
ment is the now blading George
Stein, who was oidy an alternate
center last year. Stein has boomed to
130 points in 12 games, for an aver
age of 10.9 per tilt this season.
Bob McKillop is still the Broncos'
most consistent flipper, having
dunked 139 in the 12 outings for 11.G
each time.
McKillop and Stein will be backed
up by Joe Greenbach, Bob Sunder
land, and Jack Nalty.

DANGEROUS DAN LOFGRAN,
who leads USF scoring with 141
points in 11 games for a 12.X av
erage, will try to match points
with Indian George Yardley to
night in a battle of the boardmen.
Most of the Dons' hopes for vic
tory hinge on the outcome of the
Lofgran-Yardley duel.
