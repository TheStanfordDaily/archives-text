# Return Finals
## 
### 
At the end of last quarter an old problem
came to light again. The same old moans weft
voiced concerning professors who ieftise to ie
turn final examinations.
Now, some of these gnpes are quite legiti
mate; we think it's only lair that each student
lihouid have the chance to check his paper loi
mechanical grading errors and to see which
questions he missed.
Some of the complaints come Irom living
groups which wish to keep old finals loi their
files, and we believe that in this matter it should
Le up to the professor whether he wishes .1
. omplete lile ol his old tests to be available.
Very few of the professors we contacted said
that they refused to return finals, and the policy

ol all departments seems to be to leave the mat
lei up to individual professors.
It would seem that the only fair way to handle
the matter is tu allow all students the chance of
at least checking over their papers, even il it
makes the readers spend additional hours lis
tening to complaints.
We also believe that if all finals were re
lumed, and that il each professor knew that his
old tests weie easily available, it might be
added incentive loi him to make up a new one
each quarter.
As things stand now, some linals are bound
to get out, giving a lew persons an advantage.
It would be better to have a standard policy.
