# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL DAILEY 
Way down deep in rnah little ole heart, A'hni really
just a born crusader. And, by gum, this mornin' A'hm
a little bit riled up. You betcha! I jt?st read in mah
paper where another one of these dad-blamed popu
larity polls has picked this here fella Jack Benny as

the funniest radio comedian of
1949 Now, dad blast it, this here
: election is nothin' but a down
light injustice to the first lady of
American comedy. A'hm referrin',
dI course, to that grand lady who
k sech a good friend of all them
there Hollywood stars, Miss Lou
el la Parsnips.
Now 1 ask you folks: What
other comedienne besides Miss
Parsnips can completely convulse

In x entire radio audience from the moment she reads
hei "first exclusive" until she finishes her program 7
it you don't believe she can do this, the thing for you
to do is tune her in. Ah cain't rightly remember the
exact time of her broadcast, but Ah do remember that
■ he is on the air right after that other real humorous
newscastin' fella, Water Winshield.
Now, if A'hm really goin' to crusade for recognition
for Miss Parsnips as the funniest thing on the radio,
Ah guess Ah should submit a little evidence for her
cause.
Let's take a look at one of her newspaper columns
about them swell folk down there in Hollywood. Her
columns are almost as funny as her radio program.
Ah say "almost as funny" because when you read her
writin's, you don't get the benefit of her great comic
de-livery. But let's just read one of her columns
anyhow.
HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 20, 1950- 1 HAD THE NICEST
chat yesterday with Director Borris Lavoris over at
Repulsive Studios. Borris, as I'm sure you all know,
ii- the biilliant young Russian director who turned out

the Italian film, "Poisson," starring Gregory Strych
nine. He is at Repulsive Studios working on a sequel
which will be called "Spaghetti," and will feature
Sonny Wisecarver in the title role ol the thin hero.
It was such fun talking with Borris again. He is su.-h
a nice young man. We are such good friends.
HAD A TELEPHONE CALL from little Margaret
O'Brawn the other day. Maggie, who has just com
pleted a role as a filly in "All the King's Horses,' had
exciting news for me. She is going to form her own
producing company. Think of that! Head of her own
production unit at the age of 13. She confided to me—
we're such good friends—that her first venture under
her new title of producer would be a baseball story
called "Father Was a Foul Ball." When I asked Mag
gie about her marital plans with "Jerky" "Butch"
Jenkins, she evaded me coyly by saying, "Why, fjolly,
you know there's nothing between Jerky and me.
Why, he's just a boy!"
HAN INTO AL JOLSON at the Black Honiberg
(next door to the Brown Derby), yesterday at lunch
time. Al was a little mad when I ran into him, mostly
because 1 knocked him flat on his back. But when he
saw that it was little old me, his face broke into a
broad smile. We're such good friends. Al confided to
me that plans are under way for a sequel to his second
picture, "Jolson Sings Again." His new picture will
be a prison story called "Jolson Sing Sings Again."
SNAPSHOTS OF HOLLYWOOD COLLECTED AT
HANDOM: From the Paramount lot comes the news
that Sessile B. Demise will follow up "Samson and
Delilah" with a colossal epic about Mount Everest.
Sonny Tufts will portray the mountain. This is a
real break for Sonny, whose acting ability is increas
ing with each picture he makes. . . . Seen holding
hands at Ciro's last night were newcomer LaLa Laßue
and the veteran actor, Sir Ctdric Airwick. Those "in
the know" say this is Ihe real thing.
That's all for today .. . see you tomorrow.

HAN INTO AL JOLSON at the Black Honiberg
(next door to the Brown Derby), yesterday at lunch
time. Al was a little mad when I ran into him, mostly
because 1 knocked him flat on his back. But when he
saw that it was little old me, his face broke into a
broad smile. We're such good friends. Al confided to
me that plans are under way for a sequel to his second
picture, "Jolson Sings Again." His new picture will
be a prison story called "Jolson Sing Sings Again."
SNAPSHOTS OF HOLLYWOOD COLLECTED AT

Sonny Tufts will portray the mountain. This is a

(Wanna Bet.' ? )

Way down deep in rnah little ole heart, A'hni really
just a born crusader. And, by gum, this mornin' A'hm
a little bit riled up. You betcha! I jt?st read in mah
paper where another one of these dad-blamed popu
larity polls has picked this here fella Jack Benny as

the funniest radio comedian of
1949 Now, dad blast it, this here
: election is nothin' but a down
light injustice to the first lady of
American comedy. A'hm referrin',
dI course, to that grand lady who
k sech a good friend of all them
there Hollywood stars, Miss Lou
el la Parsnips.
Now 1 ask you folks: What
other comedienne besides Miss
Parsnips can completely convulse

In x entire radio audience from the moment she reads
hei "first exclusive" until she finishes her program 7
it you don't believe she can do this, the thing for you
to do is tune her in. Ah cain't rightly remember the
exact time of her broadcast, but Ah do remember that
■ he is on the air right after that other real humorous
newscastin' fella, Water Winshield.
Now, if A'hm really goin' to crusade for recognition
for Miss Parsnips as the funniest thing on the radio,
Ah guess Ah should submit a little evidence for her
cause.
Let's take a look at one of her newspaper columns
about them swell folk down there in Hollywood. Her
columns are almost as funny as her radio program.
Ah say "almost as funny" because when you read her
writin's, you don't get the benefit of her great comic
de-livery. But let's just read one of her columns
anyhow.
HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 20, 1950- 1 HAD THE NICEST
chat yesterday with Director Borris Lavoris over at
Repulsive Studios. Borris, as I'm sure you all know,
ii- the biilliant young Russian director who turned out

the Italian film, "Poisson," starring Gregory Strych
nine. He is at Repulsive Studios working on a sequel
which will be called "Spaghetti," and will feature
Sonny Wisecarver in the title role ol the thin hero.
It was such fun talking with Borris again. He is su.-h
a nice young man. We are such good friends.
HAD A TELEPHONE CALL from little Margaret
O'Brawn the other day. Maggie, who has just com
pleted a role as a filly in "All the King's Horses,' had
exciting news for me. She is going to form her own
producing company. Think of that! Head of her own
production unit at the age of 13. She confided to me—
we're such good friends—that her first venture under
her new title of producer would be a baseball story
called "Father Was a Foul Ball." When I asked Mag
gie about her marital plans with "Jerky" "Butch"
Jenkins, she evaded me coyly by saying, "Why, fjolly,
you know there's nothing between Jerky and me.
