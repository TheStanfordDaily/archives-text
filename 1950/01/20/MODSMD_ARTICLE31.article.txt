To the Editor:
In the past it usually has been the policy of a person
01 persons who, being on the receiving end of an at
tack by a Daily editorial, would immediately compose
a tituig and bitter rebuttal in the form of a letter and
request it to be published. This is not my intention,
lor The Daily editorials, in most cases, attempt to in
form the student-body of actions and activities that
ASSU members are not too familiar with.
The editorial appearing in last Thursday's paper left
u-aders with the assumption and attitude that the
Stanford Flying Club has placed the ASSU "out on a
limb " The article was well meant and the goal for
which it appeared to be stiiving is far from unrealistic.
Vet, there were a few connotations tliat had no basis,
and meaningful facts omitted.
Since the Flying Team, which is part of the Flying
Club, is striving for a minor sport status, it has been
oui objective to represent Stanford University in the
highest degree in sportsmanship, co-operation, and
safety. Falling under the caption of safety would be
insurance. We of the Flying Club have been working
diligently along with the Student Manager of the
AL'.SU in attempting to satisfy this necessity. Costs
for insurance, at the present time, appear to be pro
hibitive, but in order fully to protect the University
while our status is being reviewed hy attorneys, all
flying meets have been suspended.
Neither will we participate in any intercollegiate
c ompetition, nor will we actively plan for future air
activity until a satisfactory conclusion to all concerned
ha:, been reached. It is my personal feeling that legal
(ounsel will establish a definite non-liability status
lor the ASSU, in which case the Flying Club will still
attempt to cover its members and the University with
adequate insurance.
Contrary to the editorial, 1 feel that the Flying Club
is among the top five activities that offer a direct bene
fit tu a majority of ALL the students. The Flying Club
has thrown open its membership tu both men and
women, offers intercollegiate competition for men and
women, and actively instructs any registered student
who desires a pilot's license. The program is not yet
fully developed, true, but certainly this has the basis
of benefiting a majority of the students a statement
that could not hold up under attack when viewing
â–  ome of the organizations that do have the sponsorship
uf the ASSU in a monetary standpoint.
New sports and even old established sports have al
ways found it difficult to be recognized when striving
I'D a desired objective. The battle the Stanford Crew
had and is still having exemplifies the situation Many
i.l the now recognized and sanctioned sports here at
Stanford underwent a hard struggle to obtain such a
position, and presently, this is what the Flying Club
i i faced with.
The Flying Team has intercollegiate competition

with the majority of Pacific Coast Colleges, and it is
out hope to continue to do so and broaden our pro
gram to bring further competition and renewed recog
nition to Stanford. Again, like the Crew of last year,
the Stanford Flying Club has an opportunity to par
ticipate in the National Intercollegiate Air Meet in
Colorado this May. However, unless we have the com
plete support of the ASSU this tiip will be impossible.
We hope and intend to win your support by giving you
a winning team a winner in competition, sportsman
ship and safety,
ALLEN B BLETZ
President, Stanford Flying Club
