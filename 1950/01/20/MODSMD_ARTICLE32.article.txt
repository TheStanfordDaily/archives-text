# Fettered Bruin

### 
To the Editor:
He the "Fettered Bruin" editorial in a recent issue
of The Daily. I, too, am an interested alumnus, but 1
am more interested in shedding a little illumination
upon the hazy cloud, tending to obliterate some of the
facts, caused by the recent replies with regard to the
editoi ial.
That the Bruin has been run by a self-perpetuating
clique for tfie last few years is all 100 evident. But it
is not so evident how this situation will be alleviated
by allowing another self-perpetuating clique, namely
the cohesive fraternity-sorority machine which domi
nates the Student Executive Council, to have the final
say with regard to the key editorial positions. That
these key editorial positions become political plums is
hardly a worthy objective.
Had this impetus for change come about because
"The UCLA student body has finally become tired of
having its reputation tarnished by a blatant daily,
etc " it would have been a sign of a healthy and
interested student body But the fact is that this im
petus bus come from less healthy sources. These in
clude among others a recent ASUCLA President's
personal (and one-sided) feud with an assistant edi
tor who became editor- in -chief only after bitter initial
opposition from the SEC, as well as the subtle attempt
of the administration to make its presence felt through
the medium of amenable student body officers.
Despite the clique that has always been in control
of the Bruin, interested students, regardless of polit
ical views have always had a chance to work on the
paper. In addition there are daily feature pages in
which contributions from the entire .student body ap
pear. In this manner, students who have something
to say but are not on the paper have a facile outlet for
expressing their ideas.
In sincerely wish that I had a practical answer to
the problem of self-perpetuating cliques, but I doubt
that the recent change will provide that answer.
Trading one sell-perpetuating clique for anothej is
not the panacea thai will unfetter the "Fettered
Bi uin."
