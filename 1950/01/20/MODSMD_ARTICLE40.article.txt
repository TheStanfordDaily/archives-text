# Cardinals Open Rugby Season Tomorrow Against Ramblers
## 
### 
The Stanford ruggers make their
official debut tomorrow afternoon
when they take on the Menlo Ram
blers at 2 on the local rugby field.
Coach Chuck Taylor has been con
ducting rugged practice sessions all
week and the Cards appear - to be
well primed for the season's opener.
Taylor received a boost in man
power this week when two promi
nent footballers, Bill McColl and
Bill De Young, joined the squad.
The importance of place-kicking in

! rugby cannot be over-emphasized,
and McColl is just the man needed
for long penalty kicks, while De
Young's speed and size make him a
welcome addition to the backfield.
Tomorrow's tilt is a practice game
and will not count in league stand
ings. The big gun for the Ramblers
;is 340 - pound Howie Sonnickson,
whose educated toe has given the
| Indians lots of trouble for the past
1 three years.
