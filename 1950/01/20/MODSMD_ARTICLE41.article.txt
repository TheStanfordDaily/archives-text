# Lunny, Mumby Take Teams To SF State
## 
### 
Stanford's boxers and wrestlers,
ready to avenge last week's shel
lacking, will try to repeat their vic
tories of last season over the San
Francisco State 'Gators tonight in
State's Buchanan Street Gym. The
wrestling is scheduled to begin at
7:30 and boxing at 9.
Both Cardinal coaches, Ray Lun
ny and Win Mumby, have made
changes in the lineups that will
meet two State squads very highly
regarded by home-town fans. The
'Gator boxing teams slugged their
way to a 9 to 3 victory over Cal
Poly last Friday before a Bay Area
television audience.
Feature boxing bouts are in the
offing, especially in the welter- and
senior welterweight clases. Top
Card welterweight, Jose Rael, who
turned in an excellent fight last
week against Cal, will meet State's
Jack, Campbell, an aggresive south
paw with two years' experience.
John Colton, Farm senior welter,
has drawn Jim Hughes, the 'Gators'
blond captain. Colton, who is im
proving with experience, will be
meeting a ring-wise boxer in Cap
tain Hughes.
Bob Baker will displace Jay Sav
age, who has dropped for the sea
son, in the lightweight division, and
Jack Bickel has drawn the top light
heavyweight berth in the absence of
Jim Hammond.
