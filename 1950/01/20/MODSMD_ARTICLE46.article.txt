Kaps took the lead and held the
Betas away from the board and tal
lies with a tight defense. Most of
the first-half baskets were made on
long shots, and neither team ton

came to life and closed the gap to
one point before the Phi Kaps could
even score. The game at this time
moved fast, with both teams alter
