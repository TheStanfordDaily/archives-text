# Foreign Student Finds Variety Of Activities Contrast to Greece
## Fonia Kaplanidon Studies American Educational System on Scholarship

Fonia Kaplanidon laughed when
asked if she had become an expert
skier on her first trip to Yosemite.
"No," she answered, "hut I learned
how to walk 011 the skis—and how
to fall."
Fonia, who is living at Lagunita
Court, is one of the seven foreign
scholarship students at Stanford
this year. She is here to study the
progressive theories of education
that are in practice in many of the
American schools so that she may
help aid their adoption in her na
tive Greece when she returns.
She is mainly interested in how
the students' time is divided be-

tween co-eurricular activities and

study. In Greece, she says, about
!)0 per cent of a student's time is
spent on his books, while in the
I United States there is closer to a
50-50 division of time.
Few School Activities
Some of the Greek students in the
gymnasium (high-school level) be
long lo such organizations as the
Boy and Girl Scouts, the YMCA, or
to religious groups. However, there
are as yet very few of the co-cur
ricular activities so common here,
such as school sports, singing
! groups, theater groups, student
publications, or class field trips.
If the 10 per cent of a Greek stu
dent's time left from his studies is
spent in such activities, it must be
done entirely apart from the school.
What the Greek educators want to
do, according to Fonia, is to inte
grate these community activities
more closely with school life.
"A Greek student of 11 or 12
probably knows more about litera
ture or history than the American
student of the same age. But we
want to develop his aesthetic sense,
his good nature —his character, as
well as his mind."
Farm Training Will Help
She hopes to help by explaining
to the Greek teachers through edu
cation courses and observations in
the local public schools the organi
zational methods she is learning at
Stanford.
The Greek universities already
have some activities such as student
government, orchestras, and sports.
She plans to work more with the
elementary school and gymnasium
students.
Fonia has taken time from her
own studies here to notice many
things about the United States. "So
big and so fast," was her general
comment on the country.
She mentioned the skyscrapers in
New York, the bridges across San
Francisco Bay, the big stores, the
5 super markets, and the teeming
i crowds in the cities as examples of
what impressed her in that way.
"Everything Done Fast"
"Everything you do here is fast,"
she said — "eating, speaking, going
places. Your many automobiles
show the way everyone is always in
a hurry."
Fonia also had some observations
J to make on American food. When
she first arrived last fall, she was
amazed at the way we combinc so
many different foods. Combining
the salt with the sweet, like mayon
naise on fruit salad, was the thing
that she thought most strange.
After eating Lagunita food for a
quarter, however, she wants to take
| an American cook book home with
her.
One of the most popular Ameri
can customs and one which is of
prime importance in Stanford dor
mitory conversation,- Fonia says she
won't try to introduce in Greece.
Dating is still for the American stu
! dents!
