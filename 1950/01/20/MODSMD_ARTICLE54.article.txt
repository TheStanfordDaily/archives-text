# Students Wanted to Spend $12,000 on Summer Travel
## 
### 
Robert Wilks, a radio student at j
USC, asks for 30 university students 1
to help him spend $12,000 on a Eu
ropean study tour next summer.
This money, however, is located in I
Spain; therefore students who api
ply must have $675 of their own. !
Wilks is anxious to share his good
fortune with others who arc equally
interested in studying abroad.
The students will spend two
months sight - seeing in Germany. |
Andorra, and Morocco. Dave E. !
Williams, a graduate radio student, â– 

will conduct the tour, which is to
'eavc from the East Coast July 1
on the S.S. Colombia.
Reductions on theater admissions
and points-of-interest tours secured
by the Institute of International Ed
ucation further help make possible
the low total price of $(575. Dis
counts of 50 per cent have been ar
ranged in Switzerland.
If University officials approve a
proposed study plan, students will
be able to take up to six credit
hours in international relations, po
litical science, education, English,
and modern languages.
Students will enroll for t lie
courses on campus, study abroad,
and receive the credits when they
return.
