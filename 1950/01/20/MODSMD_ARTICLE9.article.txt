A Stanford student and his wife lost almost all their possessions,
and four other students narrowly escaped heavy loss in a fire yes
terdays morning which destroyed a small cottage and damaged a
nearby house in Barron Park, east of the campus.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Saylor were at classes at Stanford and San

Jose State, respectively, when the'
j tire broke out in a garage adjoining
I the main house and ran along a trel
l lis to the cottage.
The house, at !)â€¢>!} Matadcro road,
is rented by Bob Saak, Jim Torrencc,
Mel Routt, and Chuck Grandi, all
members of Theta Chi fraternity.
Their clothes and possessions were
j moved out by neighbors and not
1 damaged.
Stanford Fire Chief John Marston
i had noticed the smoke while on the
I campus and had started towards il
I to investigate when the call for the
! Stanford Fire Department came in
J at about lOi-IO a.m. Barron Park, Palo
Alto, Los Altos, and Santa Clara
I County trucks were also called.
Lack of hydrants in the unincor
! porated area, and a narrow entrance
I to the grounds hampered efforts of
j the firemen. They were able, how-
I ever, to confine the fire to the rear
I of the large house where the kitchen
I and laundry were destroyed.
Other rooms were damaged by
smoke anrl water. The house is
owned by Norman Hodgkin and often
used for parties by Theta Chi.
