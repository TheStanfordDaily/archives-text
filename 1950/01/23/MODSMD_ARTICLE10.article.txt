THE COMBINED EFFORTS of a 21-tugboat armada, part of which are shown in the above air view,
failed to budge the battleship Missouri after it ran aground on a mudbank in Chesapeake Bay. A
pipeline dredge joined the battle to free the navy's biggest ship as il began digging the sand from
beneath her keel. At the same time, an army dredge is cutting trenches 40 feel wide on each side
of the stranded ship. Suction has frozen the bottom of the Missouri to the mud of the shoal. To
counteract this force, huge cables at high tension will be strung between the ship and anchors
1,000 feet astern. For further bouyancy, the ship will be unloaded and submarine pontoons will
be installed by divers on either side of the Missouri's stern. —AP Wirephoto
