# THE 						MONTE CARLO OF THE EAST
## Macau Smugglers' Haven 
### DAVID WONG 
In recent years, the Portuguese
colony of Macau has been doing a
bit of house - cleaning. Situated
about 40 miles from the British col
ony of Hong Kong, Macau is one of
the oldest foreign colonics in the Far
East. Rut if is also the home of in
numerable rackets and is reputed to
be fine of the wickedest cities in the
()riertt.
Because of bet all-night casinos,
Macau has become known through
out the world as I lie Monte Carlo of
the East. Although gambling is le
galized, the authorities are trying to
abolish it slowly.
The number of licenses being is
sued to gambling establishments is
being decreased yearly. Thus the
authorities will not cut oIT too sud
denly what, to them, has been a
source of revenue for years.
Running opium dens and keeping
brothels were, until recent years,
lawful professions in Macau. Today
they are no longer considered legal
and therefore arc being suppressed.
However, other rackets have arisen
lately. The best known is gold
smuggling.
Because of the unsettled condi
tions in Asia, the people have lost

faith in their papei currency and
are looking for security in the form
of gold and precious stones. With
her free market in gold, Macau
proved to be the ideal spot for the
racketeers to set up their multi
million-dollar business
Gold is pouring into Ma< - an in
an unending stream, and behind the
unpretentious exteriors of the local
banks, that yellow metal is melted
and made into small bars. The bars
arc then smuggled into nearby
countries.
The gold smuggling outfit is one
of the best organized smuggling
groups in the Far East. II has a vast
army of smugglers who have at
their disposal heavily armed, ar
mor-plated speedboats.
When millions of dollars aie in
volved, goorl organization is re
quired to protect the "investment"
not so much from the authorities as
from their brother outlaws, the pi
rates.
Hong Kong, one of Macau's closest
neighbors, has passed strict laws
forbidding the import or export of
gold. In fact, all dealings in gold
within the colony itself are banned.
It is interesting to note, however,

that the penalties meted out to gold
smugglers amount to no more than
the confiscation of the gold involved,
plus very nominal fines.
A stern enforcement of the law
might discourage smuggling, so
while many precautions are taken
to prevent gold from being smug
gled into 'be colony, the punish
ment of offenders is light. It is not
surprising to find that the gold con
fiscated from smugglers forms the
greatest single source of revenue
for Hong Kong.
But the smugglers arc no fools
While a number of them get caught,
that number is insignificant when
compared with the large number of
smugglers who don't get caught.
One ingenious method of smug
gling gold into Hong Kong was not
discovered until very recently. The
Hong Kong police received infor
mation that a certain group of wom
en, traveling on a certain river
steamer, was carrying a consider
able quantity of gold with them.
When the steamer arrived in Hong
Kong, the women and their belong
ings were thoroughly searched, but
no gold was uncovered. Not being
satisfied, however, the police sent

the women to the hospital to be X
rayed It was then discovered that
â™¦he women had the gold bars con
cealed in their wombs.
' Another racket which is some
what less well known, Hut never
theless flourishes in Macau, deals
with passports. With the civil war
going on in China, many rich indi
viduals are desirous of migrating to
a foreign country and living in a
more salubrious atmosphere. How
ever, for reasons best known to
themselves, either they are not in
possession of passports, or they are
unable to obtain passports legally
They therefore flock to Macau,
where, through certain channels,
tlicy are able to obtain passports at
h price. The price of course varies,
depending on how badly the person
is in need of a passport.
With so many rackets going on,
it seems the Macau authorities have
a hard job on their hands trying to
clean up the place. If they succeed,
Macau will lose a lot of its glamour
and romance. Perhaps they won't
succced.
Perhaps Macau is destined to be a
place where people can go for an
occasional nefarious weekend.
