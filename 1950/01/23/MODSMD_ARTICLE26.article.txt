# Stadium Parking Thefts Cleared Up
## Grandma, 35, Partner Arrested at SF Beach 
### 
Arrest of a 35-year-old grandmother and her male accomplice by
San Francisco police last weekend, resulted in the solution of the
theft of $7,000 worth of goods from cars parked at football games
here last autumn.
Mrs. Linda Baireuther of San Leandro and Carl L. Martin of San

'Francisco, were picked up at the
San Francisco beach and charged
with the burglary of parked auto
mobiles.
Upon questioning, the pair con
fessed they had stolen thousands of
dollars worth of clothes and per -
sonal effects from automobiles at
Stanford, University of California,
and Kezar Stadium football games,
and at the beach.
According to Stanford Police Chief
Gordon Davis who questioned them
last week, about $7,000 worth of fur
coats and other articles here have
been accounted for.
At the time of their arrest, Mrs.
Baireuther was wearing a stolen fur
coat and Martin was wearing a pai<
of cuff links also identified as stolen
items.
Furs Stolen
Chief Davis said the burglaries
here occurred at the Michigan and
Cal football games. Most of the
stolen articles were fur coats and ex
pensive dresses, with cameras and
other valuable personal items also
being taken.
Reports turned in to the police last
fall indicated the largest loss from
one car was $2,000
Many of the articles were sold,
pawned and given away, and some
were sent to friends in New York
The two also had many stolen items
in their possession when they were
arrested.
Return Difficult
Because of the large number of
articles stolen, and their widespread
distribution, identification and re
turn to rightful owners will be diffi
cult, Chief Davis said. Persons who
turned in reports of their losses have
been notified by police.
San Francisco police said Mai tin
had a record of several arrests on
similar charges. Mrs. Baireuther had
no police record, and her husband
did not know of the burglaries, policc
said.
They are in custody in San Fran
cisco, where a hearing will be held
today.
