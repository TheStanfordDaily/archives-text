A columnist in the Oregon Daily Emerald claims
that dozens of students at Eugene have taken to heart
that article about smoking in the January Reader's
Digest.
"The immediate result," he says, "has been a return
to i lean living by students here,"
No one has yet reported a return to clean living at
Stanford. Maybe nobody reads the Digest here.

The Dean of Students at Michigan State College
thinks blue jeans "foreshadow a moral letdown" for
girls wearing them.
He commented that co-eds wearing them are prob
ably en route to a beer bust, according to the Michi
gan State College News.
At Cal, the Men's Judicial Committee challenged
Executive Committee to a football game, though after
wards one of the challengers groused that next year
they'd better play Women's Judicial Committee in
stead. ASUC President Dan Coelho starred and led
Ex Committee to a 7-6 victory, and Ex Committee won
the stakes—a keg of milk.
Name of the game? The Milk Bowl, naturally.

Race discrimination reared its ugly head last fall
from a prize-winning UCLA Homecoming float that
portrayed Southern Hospitality with a Negro
"mammy."
Or so said some students and faculty, who bitterly
accused the float-designers of fostering bigotry, and
were bitterly accused of having no sense of humor.
UCLA's Executive Committee apologized in the

name of the students, for the insult to a minority im
plied in the float. But it occurred to one Bruin that
the stand taken "would raise float problems when
UCLA entertains the Stanford Indians at next year's
homecoming."

Then, at UCLA's northern branch, the bookstore
committee of the ASUC recommended that the Berke
ley student bookstore take Little Black Sambo oft its
shelves.
The Bear Executive Committee voted it down,
Unanimously.

The Daily Kansan heralded the coming of exam
week, or the "quail season," with a few idle com
ments like the one about the student who prepared
his cribnotes so well that, much to his disgust, he
• learned the information and didn't need the notes.
Instructors, says the Kansan, usually run exams
according to the "supervised honor system." "It works
very well," says the Kansan, "for the instructor."

"The Spartan Daily at San Jose State recently classi
fied students into seven groups according to how they
choose seats in classrooms.
These were the groups the unscientific survey came
up with: front-row eager beavers; far-corner hermits;
tight little cliques; Romeos; the rugged individualist,
who throws his notebook toward the chairs and
wherever it lights is good enough for him; the vast
majority, who have no discernible method; and the
old men —who sit as near the gas heaters as possible.

The Daily Kansan heralded the coming of exam
week, or the "quail season," with a few idle com
ments like the one about the student who prepared
his cribnotes so well that, much to his disgust, he

Instructors, says the Kansan, usually run exams
according to the "supervised honor system." "It works
very well," says the Kansan, "for the instructor."

"The Spartan Daily at San Jose State recently classi
fied students into seven groups according to how they
choose seats in classrooms.
These were the groups the unscientific survey came
up with: front-row eager beavers; far-corner hermits;
tight little cliques; Romeos; the rugged individualist,
who throws his notebook toward the chairs and
wherever it lights is good enough for him; the vast
majority, who have no discernible method; and the
old men —who sit as near the gas heaters as possible.
A columnist in the Oregon Daily Emerald claims
that dozens of students at Eugene have taken to heart
that article about smoking in the January Reader's
Digest.

Ex Committee to a 7-6 victory, and Ex Committee won
the stakes—a keg of milk.
Name of the game? The Milk Bowl, naturally.

Race discrimination reared its ugly head last fall
from a prize-winning UCLA Homecoming float that
portrayed Southern Hospitality with a Negro
"mammy."
Or so said some students and faculty, who bitterly
accused the float-designers of fostering bigotry, and
were bitterly accused of having no sense of humor.
UCLA's Executive Committee apologized in the

name of the students, for the insult to a minority im
plied in the float. But it occurred to one Bruin that
the stand taken "would raise float problems when
UCLA entertains the Stanford Indians at next year's
homecoming."
