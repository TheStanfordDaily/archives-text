# BULL SESSION
## By JOHN HALL 
### 
The trouble with the world today is that everybody
wants to be a comedian.
There are no more straight men. Everybody wants
to laugh it up. Everybody's a funnyman. It's getting
dangerous to go out on the street any more. People

Keep trying to prove Bob Hope's
a fluke.
Professors are doing it. Students
are doing it. So are salesmen,
ushers, radio detectives, barbers,
and waiters, to name a few.
It reached a peak the other
night when I drew the waiter type
of comedian.
In blind faith, I had followed a
couple of fx'lends to a place in
Oakland called Hambone Kelley's.
At first I thought maybe I would

live, but after 5 minutes of the place, I was denouncing
blind faith, friendship, and a place in Oakland called
Hamfcone Kelley's.
It wasn't just Lu Watters. Lu would be great from
a lev/ miles back.
Nor was it the crowd exactly—except they went
over much better in a Zanuck flick named "Snakepit."
It was—exactly and specifically—the waiter. He was
a pretty good waiter, but a terrible comedian. He
Was suffering from a delusion which boiled down to a
ondition which had him thinking he was a combina
tion riot and three-ring circus.
To put it plainly, he wasn't a straight man.
"Greetings," he greeted. "What's your poison?
Hah-hah. Our Scotch is really Scotch it makes you

tight. Hah-hah. How do you like the band? They
really don't need no introduction. They all know each
other very well. Hah-hah."
Noting that we weren't exactly doubling up with
laughter, he started over, "C'mon, ease up. Hah-hah.
The tables in this joint are reserved, but the cus
tomers ain't. Hah-hah."
"Time out, joke-boy," I finally broke in. "All we
want is a couple brews."
"Beer?" he jeered. "Hah-hah. Sure, what'll you
have—Hopalong Cassidy or Boston Blackie?"
"Huh?" I said simply.
"Western or Eastern? Hah-hah."
"Regal," we managed.
When he finally left to get our beer, we agreed that
a quick exit was our best move. But just then Lu
Watters began to play again, and there was a wild
stampede to the snakepit—l mean dance floor—and
all the exits were blocked.
Our boy returned. "Hah-hah. You know what's
wrong with all the other waiters in this place/ They re
the kind of guys who think money grows on TRAYS.
Hah-hah."
Just as I thought we were in for a second seige, he
spied another victim and laughed his way to another
table.
About this time an ugly rumor started around the
room that the place was on fhe. As a matter of fact, I
started it —the rumor, that is. At any rate, the exits
cleared and we were out on the street again.
1 tell you of this little incident just to point out the
complete hold rumor seems to have taken on the in
habitants of the world today.
It's terrifying. All I can say is "Hah-Hah."

There are no more straight men. Everybody wants
to laugh it up. Everybody's a funnyman. It's getting
dangerous to go out on the street any more. People

Keep trying to prove Bob Hope's
a fluke.
Professors are doing it. Students
are doing it. So are salesmen,
ushers, radio detectives, barbers,
and waiters, to name a few.
It reached a peak the other
night when I drew the waiter type
of comedian.
In blind faith, I had followed a
couple of fx'lends to a place in
Oakland called Hambone Kelley's.
At first I thought maybe I would

live, but after 5 minutes of the place, I was denouncing
blind faith, friendship, and a place in Oakland called
Hamfcone Kelley's.
It wasn't just Lu Watters. Lu would be great from
a lev/ miles back.
Nor was it the crowd exactly—except they went
over much better in a Zanuck flick named "Snakepit."
It was—exactly and specifically—the waiter. He was
a pretty good waiter, but a terrible comedian. He
Was suffering from a delusion which boiled down to a
ondition which had him thinking he was a combina
tion riot and three-ring circus.
To put it plainly, he wasn't a straight man.
"Greetings," he greeted. "What's your poison?
Hah-hah. Our Scotch is really Scotch it makes you

tight. Hah-hah. How do you like the band? They
really don't need no introduction. They all know each
other very well. Hah-hah."
Noting that we weren't exactly doubling up with
laughter, he started over, "C'mon, ease up. Hah-hah.
The tables in this joint are reserved, but the cus
tomers ain't. Hah-hah."
"Time out, joke-boy," I finally broke in. "All we
want is a couple brews."
"Beer?" he jeered. "Hah-hah. Sure, what'll you
have—Hopalong Cassidy or Boston Blackie?"
"Huh?" I said simply.
"Western or Eastern? Hah-hah."
"Regal," we managed.
When he finally left to get our beer, we agreed that
a quick exit was our best move. But just then Lu
Watters began to play again, and there was a wild
stampede to the snakepit—l mean dance floor—and
all the exits were blocked.
Our boy returned. "Hah-hah. You know what's
wrong with all the other waiters in this place/ They re
the kind of guys who think money grows on TRAYS.
Hah-hah."
Just as I thought we were in for a second seige, he
spied another victim and laughed his way to another
table.
About this time an ugly rumor started around the
room that the place was on fhe. As a matter of fact, I
started it —the rumor, that is. At any rate, the exits
cleared and we were out on the street again.
1 tell you of this little incident just to point out the
complete hold rumor seems to have taken on the in
habitants of the world today.
It's terrifying. All I can say is "Hah-Hah."

The trouble with the world today is that everybody
wants to be a comedian.
