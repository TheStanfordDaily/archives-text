## Athletic Decline 
### 
To the Editor:
Coach Taylor gets a job with the '49ers, more power
to him, and Stanford loses another good man. It is
interesting to note that since the war the frosh have
not lost a football game and were tied in only one.
We have obtained good junior college transfers, yet
•ume people are not satisfied with the record of the
"varsity."
Last year, in basketball, we thought we had a good
f^arn—until Conference play started. We also had a
icod iiosh team. Why isn't this year's record better?
We have only to look at the sports page to note that in
other spoits as well, the present Starifordites are not
"the all-conquering Cardinal."
So, as one who noted the decline of Stanford ath
letic power under the SAC-setup, I can but hope that
the editorial "Changes in Athletics," heralds a return
of the good old BAC.
However, we should realize that the process of de
i line has been going on for many years, and that it
may take several years after the revival ol the BAC
beloie we again win a Conference championship or
put a dozen men on an Olympic team.
We should also realize that the difference between
SAC arid BAC may not be the whole reason for Stan
ford's athletic decline. There may have been a change

in student attitudes, or maybe the present generation
i-, a bunch of spoiled softies, etc.
