# American Slang

To the Editor:
My congratulations to Mr. David Wong for his mas
terful analysis of America and Americans. Before I
came to this country, I thought that in the United
States there weie very wealthy and powerful men,
pretty girls, and many cars. I found "big shots," "hot
chicks," and "hot rods."
With an inadequately logical pattern of thought, I
supposed that "bear" was said like "fear," but that
would be beer." I thought "sew" would be like "few,"
but it's not, it's ".so." People don't dance, they aren't
efficient, they don't make love, and they don't go to
bed; they cut a rug, are ori the ball, neck, and hit the
sack. If I cut that stuff (that is, if I eliminate those
idiomatic expressions) and speak English, my friends
protest: "Speak English, bud."
It isn't only that Americans forget my name five
seconds after saying "Gladtameetcha," but they greet
me the next day with. "Hiya, Mac!" 1 am not going
to depart, leave, or go; 1 guess I'll just scramâ€”or shall
I beat it?
