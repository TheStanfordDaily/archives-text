# Chaparral Makes An Issue of Crime
## 
### 
It's a January issue of
the Stanford Chaparral, that is. The
latest issue of the campus humor rag,
with the underworld for a theme this
time, will appear at stands around
campus Wednesday.
Do you want to know if the under
world can take Stanford? Do you
want to read one of Stanford's promi
nent socio-physio-psycho-alchemists
on the sociological aspects of crime?
Or the latest dope on modern crime
preventive devices?
All this and more is yours in the
January Chappie. It will be available
Wednesday morning at 8.
