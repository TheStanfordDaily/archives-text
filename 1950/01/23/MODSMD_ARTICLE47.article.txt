# Stanford Hoopsters Divide Weekend Basketball Tilts
## Cardinals Defeat Santa Clara, 66 to 60, After Losing 54 to 39 Contest to Dons 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's new Indians had that old look this weekend.
Hurt by a last-minute loss of center Ralph Carver and tied up by
the over-anxious sophomores, Stanford was stormed under by
USF's Dons in a 54 -39 downpour Friday in a crowded Cow Palace.
The Indians salvaged a split out of the weekend by slapping

Santa Clara, 66-60, Saturday night.
Carver Sidelined
Ralph Carver, sidelined with a res
piratory disorder, missed both games.
But, even with Carver present,
Stanford probably would not have
touched USF.
The National Invitation champs
were at their best. With Don Lof
gran and Jack Hanley supplying the
punch, the Hilltoppers casually
worked to a 25-15 halltime lead.
After the intermission, they kept
the ball rolling to coast to a 15-point
win, their first victory over Stanford
since 11)40, and only the eighth time
in 28 tries that they've been able to
turn the trick.
Lofgran Hits Hi
The expected duel between Lof
gran and George Yardley never had
a chance to kindle. Lol'gran was
game high with 10. Yardley led Stan
ford with 11, Both men were out
standing on the boards, but the wide
split on the scoreboard prevented
things from coming to a head.
Yardley dropped in 20 points for
the two nights, giving him 224 for
the season, an average of 15 per
game.
Stanford had a better time with
Santa Clara, although the Cards al
most blew a 19-point lead when the
Broncos closed with a tremendous
spurt in the closing five minutes.
Indians Rally
Starting slowly, Stanford was trail
ing, 20-14, when suddenly the thaw
came to an end. With Jim Ramstead
and Jack O'Sullivan coming to life,
the Indians pumped in 14 straight

points to forge to the front, 28-20.
By halftime they had parlayed
their hot streak into a 38 to 24 mar
gin. It was 49 to 30 before Santa
Clara began to pick up. The Bioncs
closed it to 02 to 58 before Jim Ram
stead slammed the lid with two
straight buckets.
Ramstead, who was as cool as a
snowstorm against USF, played one
of his best games against Santa Clara.
He pulled down high-point honors
with 18 and scored in the clutch to
spark the Tribe victory.
Dean Experiments
Everett Dean spent the weekend
trying a wide and varied assortment
of combinations. At one time against
the Dons he had Ramstead, Jim
Walsh, Bruce Iverson, Harry Hu
gasian, and Bill Warren working as
a unit.
Marv Gelber sat out both games
again. This time Jack O'Sullivan had
his guard job, as Jim Walsh was
moved back to forward. Sully tossed
up 15 against the Broncos.
The week-end split brought Stan
lord's season total to seven wins and
eight losses. The Indians now draw a
10-day pass before they clash in a
return bout with the Olympic Club
in the Pavilion on February 1.
