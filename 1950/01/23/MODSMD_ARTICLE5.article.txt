LAKE SUCCESS â€” Nationalist
China's accusations against Soviet
Russia in the United Nations have
been shelved.
The Assembly adopted a U.S.-
sponsored resolution proposing a
hands-ofT policy to let the Chinese
settle their own problems.
There is a strong feeling in UN
circles that as soon as 30 UN mem
bers have recognized the Chinese
Communists, they will be admitted.
