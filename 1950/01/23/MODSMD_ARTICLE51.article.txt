# SF State Clips Farm Boxers; Wrestlers Tie
## 
### JOB CUSICK 
The Farm's boxers and wrestlers,
showing definite improvement in
their second test of the season, did
n't have quite enough moxie last
Friday night to turn back two well
balanced San Francisco State Col
lege squads.
The grapplers, who went on first
in State's crowded gym, tied with a
16-all team score. Stanford's box
ers, unaided by forfeits in the two
lowest weights and a couple of
questionable decisions, posted a rec
ord of three wins and seven losses.
Garst, Esbenshade Win
Coach Win Murnby's lightest and
•heaviest — 121-lb. Dick Esbenshade
and heavyweight Steve Garst — led
the way for the Indian wrestling
contingent by pinning their oppo
nents and adding five points each
to the team score. Esbenshade got a
fall on Ray Ramone in the first pe
riod and Garst pinned Jack Root in
the third after the two were tied on
points.
Niles Severin, 155-lb. Cardinal
matman, and his Gator opponent,
Adolf Kelly, were paired in one of
the best matches of the evening. At
the end of three periods, with the
score even, Severin was awarded
one point and the decision for hav
ing the most top time.
In the 175-lb. division, Stanford's
Dick DeWitt got several near falls
on State's CI ill' Gday and easily won
the decision.
Other Wrestling Results:
Joe Kimura, 128 lbs., beat Dick
j Cruce (S), (1); Jerry Friedman, 135
i lbs., dec. Don Williams (S); Bob
Cunningham, 145 lbs., dec. Rollin
Rose (S); Russell Mesorole, IGS lbs.,
beat Bob Harmon (S), (3).
Ray Lunny's scrappers proved to
their coach that they are an up
and - coming bunch. The judges,
however, were inclined to side with
the 2,000 or so rabid State fans who
packed their small arena.
Obcrlin Scores TKO
Heavyweight Dave Oberlin had
to chase State's Jim Cinella around
the ring, and when he found him he
punched his way to a third-round
TKO over the inexperienced Gator
boxer.
Bill Sharp, Farm middleweight,
was a much improved fighter over
last week and decisioned State's
Dick Boyd. The fight was stopped
at the end of the second because of
a cut over Sharp's eye. He was
ahead on points and took the deci
sion.
Karl May decisively beat State's
southpaw welterweight, Jack Camp
bell, in their three-rounder. May
had Campbell on the ropes several
times.
Rael I ..oses Decision
In the best match of the card, Jose
Rael, top Stanford welterweight,
lost a very doubtful decision to
State's Far Western Conference
champ, Ted Abbott.
After an even first round Rael
scored often in the second, but Ab
bott counter-punched well. In the
final round Raei came through with
his usual effective jab - and - duck
finish but the judges awarded the
fight to the more fatigued Abbott.
Surprise bout of the night was in
the senior welterweight division be
tween John Colton of Stanford and
State's ring-wise Jim Hughes. Cap
tain Hughes, the blond darling of
Gator ring fans, showed his edge in
experience in the first round but
was rocked back by the aggressive,
hard-hitting tactics of Colton in the
second and first part of the third
round. Hughes came back to finish
very strong and take the decision.
Other Boxing Results:
Lightweight Bob Baker (S) lost a
decision to John Fisher (3); Jerry
Farmin (S) was TKO'd in the last
part of the third round by Steve
Wood; light - heavyweight Jack
Bickel lost a decision to Fuzzy

ett's eye. Bickel, who was coming
back after a slow first round, lost
when the judges awarded the deci
