## Frosh Cagers Swamp Preps 
### 
Bob Burnett's freshman cagers
bounded back from their twin losses
to California by taking a pair of
games from two Bay Area prep fives
over the weekend.
The Pavilion was the scene for
both of the Red triumphs. On Fri
day afternoon it was George Wash
ington High who came from the
City to be struck down by the Year
lings 41 to 33.
Big Bill Stevenson found his eye
for 13 points. Close behind the 213-
pound center was second - stringer
Jack Shepard with 10.
Washington's ace performer Bob
Simon was held to a pair of field
goals by the frosh, and the losers'
scoring honors went to reserve
forward Ken Kardell, who sent in
seven points, and Simon's running
mate at forward, Jack Mayfield,
who scored six.
The locals led at half-time by six
points, 20 to 14.
On Saturday San Mateo fell to the
force of the freshmen. The Papooses
ran up a 28 to 7 lead during the
first period and rode in to a 58 to 28
victory.
Burnett's hard - driving guard
Fritz Fenster led the way with 12
counters. Forward Wade McClusky
and Stevenson had nine each, and
sub guard Shepard figured into the
count again with eight.
The San Mateo preps were out
classed during the entire perform
ance.
