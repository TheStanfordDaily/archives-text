# Philippe Berthet Contrasts American, French Living
## Topics of Conversation Turn To Serious French Subjects 
### GORDON McKIBBEN 
The remark seemed strangely contrary to the comfortably- j
crowded surroundings of the upstairs room in the Theta Xi House.
"You Americans trust life, but we in France have little faith in
the future. It's the basic difference between our countries as I see
it, the difference between optimism and pessimism."
Philippe Berthet, 25-year-old French economics student studying

here on an ASSU Scholarship, con-"*
tinned:
"We don't believe in the world to
the extent you do. When French
students get to talking, the conversa
tion invariably swings to a sobering j
topic like the cold war or to the latest i
government shift.
"I was amazed to see how Stanford j
students have plans reaching far into
the future. French students seldom
speak of future jobs or plans. It's
hard enough just to make a living."
Berthet is one of seven students at
Stanford this year who is studying
under the ASSU Foreign Scholarship
Program.
He is a war veteran, having served
with the Le Clere Division of Gen
eral Patton's Third Army in Europe.
He was also an officer in the French
Navy following the war.
Paris Graduate
Berthet is a graduate of the Uni
versity of Paris, where he did work
in mathematics and statistics.
Fraternity life is one subject on
which he should be an expert after
leaving Stanford, for he is getting a
substantial taste of it here.
Last quarter he stayed at the SAE
House, this quarter he is living with
the Theta Xi's, and he will move into
the AKL House this spring.
Interestingly enough, Berthet con
siders the chance to live with the
different fraternities fully as im
portant as his work in the economics
department.
"The particular good of the ASSU
scholarship is that it makes provision
for living with the fraternity men,"
he said.
"A foreign student should not get
isolated when he is here. He should
stay in close contact with American
students, so that he will be able to
talk intelligently about America
when he goes home."
Berthet said that much misunder
standing between countries arises
because of the "first impression criti
cisms" which are common to travel
ers who don't get the opportunity to
know the people of a country and
their customs.
Berthet and Campus Life
One of the things which seemed
strange to Berthet is something
Americans take for granted - the
college campus. He was especially
surprised to sec that many American
students live on campus for their en
tire four years of undergraduate
work.
One campus activity, autumn
quarter's foreign relief drive, had a
special meaning for Berthet, for he
is past-chairman of a French student
organization which gets considerable
aid from CARE. The French organ
ization maintains a convalescent
home in the Alps for sick students
who were active in the French re
sistance movement.
Before he goes back to Paris next
fall, Berthet hopes to explore this
country as fully as possible. He says
he wants to get a more accurate and
rounded picture of America than his
stay at Stanford can provide.
