## International House Studied 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
The Chicago International House,
third of the four built with the j
financial backing of John D. Rocke- j
feller Jr., stands adjacent to the |
University of Chicago.
The program of activities and the
organization of the four "I" Houses
have been of interest to the student
committee at Stanford now investi
gating the possibility of establishing
an "I" House here.
"That brotherhood may prevail"
is the theme underlying all Inter
national House activities. At Chi
cago, over 500 students, research
workers, and teachers from every
nation live together. Many mem
bers of the house feel that in learn
ing to know one another this way as
individuals they have gained a
much greater understanding of oth
er nations.
UN Delegate
Said Dr. Mohammed Fadhcl Ja
mali, former member of the New
York "I" House and delegate to the
United Nations from Iraq:
"I often ask myself what qualifies
i me to attend the United Nations and
; to be a foreign minister of my coun
j try. . . . The only specific prepara
tion which I had ... is having been
I a member of this International
House.
"If in international affairs, you
I have toward people of other nations
the same feeling of brotherhood and
friendship that is developed in this
| house, then foreign relationships are
j safe."
Programs of the house are both
academic and social. There arc pub
i lie lectures, debates, forums, con
! certs, informal discussion groups,
and publication of the International
House Quarterly. All activities are
i aimed at furthering understanding
j between countries.
On the lighter side arc banquets
| and receptions, social and folk
j dances, foreign movies, and tours of
i inspection of points of interest in
| the city.
Physical Facilities
The physcal facilities of "I" House
which include the many social
rooms, meeting rooms, and sports
facilities, as well as the planned
j programs, are available to many
i members who are not residents of
! the house. Thus it provides a focal
point for student international ac
tivity in Chicago.
The Paris International House
provides no dormitory accommoda
! tions.
It contains a library, theater, so-
I ciay halls, restaurants and cafe, a
' swimming pool, gymnasiums, and

game rooms, forming a common
meeting place and social centers for
Paris students of the Cite Univcrsi-
taire.
The Cite Universitaire is a resi-
dential colony at the University,
where each building is devoted to a
separate nationality group. Cite res-
idents have found the International
House a solution to this segregation
in living.
Opponents of the"I" House fear ,
that the plan will segregate foreign
students in a house all their own;
| instead, it has brought them togeth
er with each other and with natives
of the country.

"That brotherhood may prevail"
is the theme underlying all Inter
national House activities. At Chi
cago, over 500 students, research
workers, and teachers from every
nation live together. Many mem
bers of the house feel that in learn
ing to know one another this way as
individuals they have gained a
much greater understanding of oth
er nations.
UN Delegate
Said Dr. Mohammed Fadhcl Ja
mali, former member of the New
York "I" House and delegate to the
United Nations from Iraq:
"I often ask myself what qualifies
i me to attend the United Nations and
; to be a foreign minister of my coun
j try. . . . The only specific prepara
tion which I had ... is having been
I a member of this International
House.
"If in international affairs, you
I have toward people of other nations
the same feeling of brotherhood and
friendship that is developed in this
| house, then foreign relationships are
j safe."
Programs of the house are both
academic and social. There arc pub
i lie lectures, debates, forums, con
! certs, informal discussion groups,
and publication of the International
House Quarterly. All activities are
i aimed at furthering understanding
j between countries.
On the lighter side arc banquets
| and receptions, social and folk
j dances, foreign movies, and tours of
i inspection of points of interest in
| the city.
Physical Facilities
The physcal facilities of "I" House
which include the many social
rooms, meeting rooms, and sports
facilities, as well as the planned
j programs, are available to many
i members who are not residents of
! the house. Thus it provides a focal
point for student international ac
tivity in Chicago.
The Paris International House
provides no dormitory accommoda
! tions.
It contains a library, theater, so-
I ciay halls, restaurants and cafe, a
' swimming pool, gymnasiums, and

game rooms, forming a common
meeting place and social centers for
Paris students of the Cite Univcrsi-
taire.
The Cite Universitaire is a resi-
dential colony at the University,
where each building is devoted to a
separate nationality group. Cite res-
idents have found the International
House a solution to this segregation
in living.
Opponents of the"I" House fear ,
that the plan will segregate foreign
students in a house all their own;
| instead, it has brought them togeth
er with each other and with natives
of the country.
The Chicago International House,
third of the four built with the j
financial backing of John D. Rocke- j
feller Jr., stands adjacent to the |
University of Chicago.
The program of activities and the
organization of the four "I" Houses
