# New German Party

### 
KASSEL, Germanyâ€”A new party,
flaunting the black, white, and red
flan of the Kaiser's Reich, has been
formed in Western Germany by the
merger of two right-wing groups.
The new party appeals frankly to
nationalists and militarists. It was
formed by a merger of the National
Democratic Party (DRP) and the
German Right Party (NDP). These
two parties received 500,000 votes in
the general elections last year and
e'ected five representatives to the
West German parliament.
