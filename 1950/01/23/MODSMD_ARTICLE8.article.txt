# SPRING SHOW
## Ram's Head Opens $200 Competition 
### 
Ram's Head announced yes
terday the opening of its contest
to select a script for Spring Show
under the rules approved by
Excom last Thursday night.
The contest is open to anyone and
a prize of $200 will be awarded to
the winning author if he or she is a
Stanford student. Those planning to
enter the contest should submit their
names to director Mort Zieve as soon
as possible.
"It will be helpful for prospective
authors to discuss their ideas for the
show with the production staff before
they submit scripts," Zicvc said.
Collaboration Arranged
"If some one wishes to write either
a book or music and needs a col
laborator, they should get in touch
with me and I'll try to help arrange
a workable combination of talent,"
he added. Ram's Head has provided
a box on t.h(§ Ram's Head bulletin
board in the back hall of Memorial
Auditorium for all communications
to the director concerning the con
test.
Since the purpose of the contest is
to encourage Stanford writers and
composers as much as possible, Ram's
Head will give preference to shows
written by Stanford students.
"Contrary to general feeling this
contest is not being given so that a
member of Ram's Head will win the
prize. In fact, the judging commit
tee will not necessarily be composed
of Ram's Head members," Zieve
himself is not a member of Ram's
Head.
Deadline Close
"The March 15 deadline is very
close, and those interested in writing
a show should begin immediately,"
he said. The production staff is now
being organized and Mioso interested
should contact Zicvc this week. No
previous expccience is necessary.
The rules, as approved by Excom,
are:
1. The $200 prize will be awarded
only for a complete show — book,
lyrics, and music.
a) In case of collaboration, $100
will be awarded for the book,
and $100 for the music, or ap
propriate divisions of these sums
if more than two collaborators.
b) Only Stanford students arc eli
gible for any part of the prize
money; however, an entrant
need not be enrol'ed at Stanford
to have his show produced, if it
be chosen by the judges.
2. Ram's Head reserves the right to
withhold the award if none of the
