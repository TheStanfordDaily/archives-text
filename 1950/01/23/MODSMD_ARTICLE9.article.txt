termed critical by Red Cross offi

relief center was set up in Little
Rock for 1,500 homeless there.

rivers were holding steady at their
confluence in Cairo, 111., and waters
were receding generally to the
north and east Conditions were re

j have been overstrained by high wa
ter most of the month thus far.
