# The 						Need for a BAC

It is our opinion that the decision which PrerJi
dent Sterling must eventually reach on the
question ol athletic control will be one bl th*-
rnost important that he will evet be asked to
make ni his capacity as president ol Stanloid
University. For we believe that the continu
ance ol Stanford's rise to its piew.tr status as u
tirst-rate athletic power will be largely depen
dent upon who controls athletic policy and oth
le-tic finances.
The question lesolves iteell into two alterna
tives. On the one hand is a proposal that the
rontrol ol athletics at Stanford be given back to
i nine-man board of Athletic Control composed
ol representatives ol the student body, the fac
ulty, and the alumni. This Board would assume
full responsibility lor the athletic program at
Stanford and would be given a free hand in the
expenditure of income from athletic events.
The opposing view is that the control ol inter
collegiate athletics should reside in the hands
ol the administration of the University, and that
attendant problems ol financing should be han
died through the general budget in the same
manner as those ol all other departments.
We contend that if Stanford —a school of high
tuition and equally high academic entrance ie
quirements—is to continue to compete with
other universities in procuring top-llight ath
letes it must have the wholehearted support in
interest and activity of the alumni and the stu
dents.
in exchange for such support the University
must allow the alumni and the students to par
ticipate in the formation of athletic policy. The
board of Athletic Control, as it existed at Stan
lord before the war, was designed to do just
this.
Such a board, composed ol three sludenl
members selected by the student body, three
faculty members appointed by the president,
and three alumni members chosen by the
Alumni Association was lirst created at Stan
lord in 1916. To it was given complete control

ol intercollegiate athletics, and it operated as a
separate and independent agency with its own
bank account, books, records, and budget.
The Board met at regular intervals to consider
over all policy arid budgets, while day to duy
administration was in tire hands ol a Craduate
Manager who was hired by the Board.
Ultimate control still resided in the president
who had a veto power over any action taken by
the Boaid.
Substantial surpluses were accumulated dur
ing the period ol operation, and all were de
voted to University puiposes. Branner Hall, the
women's gymnasium, the goll course, the Sta
dium, and almost the entire men's athletic plant
were constructed with BAC surpluses. A sub
stantial contribution was also made to the
School ol Physical Education each year.
The Board suspended its operation in 1942
when it was realized that intercollegiate compe
tition could not be continued at Stanloid during
the war period.
At the conclusion ol the war, President Tre
sidder centralized the control ol athletics in the
University, and all policy-making Junctions ol
the Board were taken away. The Graduate Man
ager became Director of Physical Education and
Intercollegiate Athletics with responsibility di
rectly to the President. The Board of Athletic
Control, renamed the Stanford Athletic Council,
was to act only in an advisory capacity.
This advisory board, as a device lor allowing
students and alumni to participate in the forma
tion of athletic policy, has proved totally un
workable. The group meets at increasingly in
frequent intervals, and it is almost certain that
it will eventually pass Out of existence unless
given some real functions to perform.
We contend that the continuance ol the pres
ent system ol athletic contiol at Stanfoid can
only result in a loss of enthusiasm and support
on the part of students and alumni. The effect of
such a loss will be a decline in Stanford's status
as a major athletic power.

ing the period ol operation, and all were de
voted to University puiposes. Branner Hall, the
women's gymnasium, the goll course, the Sta
dium, and almost the entire men's athletic plant
were constructed with BAC surpluses. A sub
stantial contribution was also made to the
School ol Physical Education each year.
The Board suspended its operation in 1942
when it was realized that intercollegiate compe
tition could not be continued at Stanloid during
the war period.
At the conclusion ol the war, President Tre
sidder centralized the control ol athletics in the
University, and all policy-making Junctions ol
the Board were taken away. The Graduate Man
ager became Director of Physical Education and
Intercollegiate Athletics with responsibility di
rectly to the President. The Board of Athletic
Control, renamed the Stanford Athletic Council,
was to act only in an advisory capacity.
This advisory board, as a device lor allowing
students and alumni to participate in the forma
tion of athletic policy, has proved totally un
workable. The group meets at increasingly in
frequent intervals, and it is almost certain that
it will eventually pass Out of existence unless
given some real functions to perform.
We contend that the continuance ol the pres
ent system ol athletic contiol at Stanfoid can
only result in a loss of enthusiasm and support
on the part of students and alumni. The effect of
such a loss will be a decline in Stanford's status
as a major athletic power.
It is our opinion that the decision which PrerJi
dent Sterling must eventually reach on the
question ol athletic control will be one bl th*-
rnost important that he will evet be asked to
make ni his capacity as president ol Stanloid
University. For we believe that the continu
ance ol Stanford's rise to its piew.tr status as u
tirst-rate athletic power will be largely depen
dent upon who controls athletic policy and oth
le-tic finances.
The question lesolves iteell into two alterna
tives. On the one hand is a proposal that the
rontrol ol athletics at Stanford be given back to
i nine-man board of Athletic Control composed
ol representatives ol the student body, the fac
ulty, and the alumni. This Board would assume
full responsibility lor the athletic program at
Stanford and would be given a free hand in the
expenditure of income from athletic events.
The opposing view is that the control ol inter
collegiate athletics should reside in the hands
ol the administration of the University, and that
attendant problems ol financing should be han
died through the general budget in the same
manner as those ol all other departments.
We contend that if Stanford —a school of high
tuition and equally high academic entrance ie
quirements—is to continue to compete with
other universities in procuring top-llight ath
letes it must have the wholehearted support in
interest and activity of the alumni and the stu
dents.
in exchange for such support the University
must allow the alumni and the students to par
ticipate in the formation of athletic policy. The
board of Athletic Control, as it existed at Stan
lord before the war, was designed to do just
this.
Such a board, composed ol three sludenl
members selected by the student body, three
faculty members appointed by the president,
and three alumni members chosen by the
Alumni Association was lirst created at Stan
lord in 1916. To it was given complete control

ol intercollegiate athletics, and it operated as a
separate and independent agency with its own
bank account, books, records, and budget.
The Board met at regular intervals to consider
over all policy arid budgets, while day to duy
administration was in tire hands ol a Craduate
Manager who was hired by the Board.
Ultimate control still resided in the president
who had a veto power over any action taken by
the Boaid.
Substantial surpluses were accumulated dur
ing the period ol operation, and all were de
voted to University puiposes. Branner Hall, the
women's gymnasium, the goll course, the Sta
