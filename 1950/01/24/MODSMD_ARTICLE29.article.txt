CHOOSING YOUR MAJOR SUBJECT
By DR VV SIGMUND DAILEY, 8.5., 1V1.D.,
and R.W.O.M.T.*
* Runs Well on Muddy Track.
(Editor's Note: This is the third in a series of ar
ticles (?) by Dr. W. Sigmund Dailey, the eminent
Viennese surgeon, psychiatrist, and left-handed
glockenspiel virtuoso. East week Dr. Dajley sharp
ened lip his littie pointed head and jolted down a few
notes on the subject of English. This recent treatise
will soon be expanded and published in two complete
volumes. The first volume will deal with the generul
subject of "Reverse English." It will be published
by Football Publishers, Inc. Volume Two will be en
titled "Pidgin English." This book is for the birds.
Today's essay by Dr. Dailey delves into the mys
teries of the world of music and is given the name of
"So You're Going To Major in Music, Eh?" or
"Father Was a Musician, Officer. Please Give Him u
Cell With 32 Bars!")

Anyone who is interested in
majoring in music should first be
come familiar with the truly great
ymphonic works. Two of the
finest symphonies ever written
are Tchaikowsky's Fourth and
Bc-ethoven's Fifth (iOU proof, bot
tled in bond). The latter selection
mixes especially well with ginger
ale and is characterized by a good
deal of syncopation. "Syncopa
tion" is defined as "erratic move
ment from bar to bar."

Another splendid way to familiarize oneself with
the outstanding music of the world is to learn the
name of the best symphony. At present the fore
most American orchestra is Pop's Boston Symphony,
under the baton of Enrico Rossotti.
With this background of knowledge, your next step
is to discover the range of your voice. Ate you a bass,
baritone, tenor, alto, 01 soprano? If you discover you
are a bass, you may further classify yourself as a first
bass, second bass, third bass, or shortstop. My own
voice is that of a heroic tenor. Well, perhaps that is
a little inexact. I'm really not a heroic tenor. I'm
more of a cowardly baritone.
Now we shall progress to the subject of tonal qual
ity. Tones which are not true are said to be either
"sharp" or "Hat." As a general rule, sharps and flats
are not desirable in music. One exception to this rule
occurs when "beautiful music" is made in a sharp
Hat.
Music can often have a deep emotional effect on
people. Even with an awareness of this knowledge,
scientists are still trying to explain why a singer
named Frank Sinatra was able to "send" people. The
answer to this question is obvious. Sinatra had to
send someone. He was too weak to go himself.
(Next week: Professor J. Geisler Dailey, the promi
nent lie-yer, continues his series on choosing your
own major with a writ of habeas corpuscle entitled
"So You're Going To Law School, Eh?" or "If You're
Going To Be Admitted to This Bar, We Gotta See Some
I D, Sonny!")

Today's essay by Dr. Dailey delves into the mys
teries of the world of music and is given the name of
"So You're Going To Major in Music, Eh?" or
"Father Was a Musician, Officer. Please Give Him u
Cell With 32 Bars!")

Anyone who is interested in
majoring in music should first be
come familiar with the truly great
ymphonic works. Two of the
finest symphonies ever written
are Tchaikowsky's Fourth and
Bc-ethoven's Fifth (iOU proof, bot
tled in bond). The latter selection
mixes especially well with ginger
ale and is characterized by a good
deal of syncopation. "Syncopa
tion" is defined as "erratic move
ment from bar to bar."

Another splendid way to familiarize oneself with
the outstanding music of the world is to learn the
name of the best symphony. At present the fore
most American orchestra is Pop's Boston Symphony,
under the baton of Enrico Rossotti.
With this background of knowledge, your next step
is to discover the range of your voice. Ate you a bass,
baritone, tenor, alto, 01 soprano? If you discover you
are a bass, you may further classify yourself as a first
bass, second bass, third bass, or shortstop. My own
voice is that of a heroic tenor. Well, perhaps that is
a little inexact. I'm really not a heroic tenor. I'm
more of a cowardly baritone.
Now we shall progress to the subject of tonal qual
ity. Tones which are not true are said to be either
"sharp" or "Hat." As a general rule, sharps and flats
are not desirable in music. One exception to this rule
occurs when "beautiful music" is made in a sharp
Hat.
Music can often have a deep emotional effect on
people. Even with an awareness of this knowledge,
scientists are still trying to explain why a singer
named Frank Sinatra was able to "send" people. The
answer to this question is obvious. Sinatra had to
send someone. He was too weak to go himself.
(Next week: Professor J. Geisler Dailey, the promi
nent lie-yer, continues his series on choosing your
own major with a writ of habeas corpuscle entitled
"So You're Going To Law School, Eh?" or "If You're
Going To Be Admitted to This Bar, We Gotta See Some
I D, Sonny!")
