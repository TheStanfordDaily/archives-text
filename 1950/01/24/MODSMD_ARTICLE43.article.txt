NEW YORK, Jan. 23 — Phil
flizzuto said lie wanted $50,000 for
playing baseball with the New York
Yankees this year and he signed to
day for a reported $40,000—the the
ory being you might as well ask for
a yacht as a rowboat.
At either figure, that's big money
for a little man, and we aren't say
ing lie isn't worth it. As they say,
it isn't so much the size of a dog in
a fight as the size of the fight in a
dog that counts, and the Scooter has
enough spirit and fight to shame
many a big, lumbering loogan, who
plays the game with all the anima
tion of a soggy lump of clay.
The little guy, who somehow re
minds you of a string of Chinese
firecrackers exploding, thus ranks
among the first three highest paid
shortstops in the history of the
game. The other two were player
managers.
Lou Boudreau of the Indians re
portedly drew $G5,000 last year, and
Joe Croniri, when active on the field
for the Red Sox, might have ap
proached $50,000, although it was
generally believed that $40,000 was
closer to the exact figure.
We have always been quite free
with someone else's money, so have
believed that a ball player is en
tilled to all he can get for his serv
ices. His career is short at best, with
a 10-year span in the majors the
exception rather than the rule.
