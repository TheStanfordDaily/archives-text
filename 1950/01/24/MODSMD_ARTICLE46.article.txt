# Two-Division Breakdown Decided Upon By National-American Football League
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 23 (/P) —
Pro football put its house in order
today by deciding the makeup of
the two divisions of the National-
American Football League on the
votes ol 12 of the 13 members.
Acting quickly when Commis
sioner Bert Bell threatened to take
the problem into his own hands, the
owners lined up two divisions like
this:
Division 1 Division 2
Cleveland Chicago Bears
New York Giants Los Angeles
Philadelphia San Francisco
Washington Detroit
Chicago Cardinals N.Y. Bulldogs
Pittsburgh Green Bay
Baltimore (swing team)
It will be determined later in
which division Baltimore will be
listed, but it is definite that the
Colts will play each of the 12 other
clubs.
Each team will play 12 games,
probably on a schedule that will call
for five home-and-home series with
each team in its own division, one
game with a "rival" from the other
section, and one game with the
swing team.
Bell will iron out the schedule
problems in private. He indicated a
schedule would not be announced
for several days.
Under the terms of the Dec. 9
merger agreement between the Na
tional League and the All-America
Coference, the two divisions were to
be known as the National and the
American. It is likely that the group
including Green Bay will be the
National and the division with
Cleveland will be the American.
Emil R. Fischer of Green Bay was
named, previously, president of the
National and Daniel Sherby of
Cleveland head of the American di
vision.
The league owners last night
completed their draft from a 390-
player pool, most of the players
from the 1949 college group. A few
were players who played pro ball
last year and since were released by
their clubs.
