PrriSBURC.il More than 03.000
bitter United Mine Workers contin
ued to strike Unlayâ€”either because
they wouldn't work or because
pickets wouldn't let them work.
For the fourth week in a row. a
large segment of the nation's 400,000
soft coal diggers upheld the mine
tradition of "no contract, no work,"
ignoring ihe pleas of John L. Lewis
and his Held lieutenants to go back
to work.
