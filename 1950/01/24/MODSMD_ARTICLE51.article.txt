Lettermen in three or four sports are very uncommon nowadays. In fait,
the term "nowadays" can be dropped from that last sentence and the state
ment would stand up under close inspection.
For in the last 35 years there have been but three men to letter in three
or more sports at Stanford. No one has done it since 1932.
Harlow Rothert, who leads the list with nine letters, made the grade in
track, iootball, basketball in 1928, '29. and '30. He was captain of the basket
ball team in his last year.
Reg Caughey earned eight monograms in the First World War era. Rudy
Rintala hit for eight in 1930, '31, '32. But these two fellows earned theii
Block "S" in four sports—something we just don't see any more. The i'oui
were, ol course, football, basketball, track, and baseball.
The reason for bringing up the above is that we of the present Stanford
era may well witness another nine-letterman in the person of llarry (Hip
ster. lioopstcr, or what have you) llugasian. Harry got one in football, is
well on tile way to a letter in basketball, and may make the grade in base
ball. Reports have it that the soph athlete can't miss in the last-named
spoil.

Speaking of multi-letter winners bring us Dick Schnettker of Ohio State.
He was first-string offensive end on the Rose Bowl team. He flew back to
Columbus right after the game to lead the Buckeyes in basketball. He is the
nation's leading scorer in points-per-game with 22 points. USC's Bill Sliar
man is eighth with 20.1 and Stanford's George Yard ley is forty-filth with a
15.2 average.
Neither of Stanford's newly drafted football players are very apt to see
action in the money ranks. Both Rupc Andrews and Bill DeYoung say
that they may play if the price is right. Well, the price is not apt to he
"right" now that the leagues have merged. Both were drafted in the later
rounds of the draw. The football market will be Hooded from now on and
and tile pros aren't very likely to be paying out any large bonuses, or large
salaries for that matter.

Good news for the Farm's ruggers was given out yesterday. President
Sterling has oked the trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, for a two-game
series with the University of British Columbia rugby team. The Canadians
will come to Stanford on March 7 for the third game.

Chuck Taylor was a rather pleased man when I dropped in on him yester
day. "Nomellini," smiled Taylor. That was enough. One could guess that
the new '49er line coach was happy over the first three choices his outfit
had made in the draft. All three were tackles, with the big Minnesotan
number one on the list.
On the whole, though, it doesn't look as if the '49ers helped themselves
very much. Best comment of the day came from Daily sportswriter A 1
Berry, who was quick to note the headline in yesterday's Chroncle—'49EßS
SIGN CELERI. Under this there was the label head—SHAW ILL.
Why the pro team ever touched Celeri is beyond this writer. I don't think
he will make the grade if he does sign. But that we shall see.

Saturday's 54 to 39 loss to USF was a surprise, to say the least. I thought
i< was the lowest score hung on the Cards in some time. Helpful Don Lie
hendorfer came up with the information (as he did in the letter-winner
case) that there have been five scores below the 39 level since Stanford
resumed basketball after the war. Cal handed the Indians a 45 to 38 loss
on March 5. 1948. Since that time, the Cards have scored over 39 points.

A! Masters is still sick in bed after his return from the NCAA Conven
tion. Coach Schwartz fills in with the comment, "We are in no hurry to find
a successor to Chuck (Taylor). We don't like to lose him, but. . . ."
