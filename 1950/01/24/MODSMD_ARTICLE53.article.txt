# Royal Rating for 'King's Men'
## 
### AL BERRY 
''All the King's Men," now at the
Stanford, gives hint that maybe,
somehow, the wonderful people
from the musical So. Cal. town have
finally learned. how to make pic
tures. At any rate, "All the King's
Men" is just about as good as a flick
can get without fudging into the
realm of the unbelievable. The thing
is terrific.
Brod Crawford, a fine actor —long

overlooked, and John Ireland, of
"Red River" fame, turn in sterling
slices of acting, which go a long way
toward making a real-life plot look
real-life.
But the real hero is the dearly de
parted Governor Huey Long, of
Louisiana, whose life dominated the
vast majority of the plot. And the
patron's opinion of Willie Stark
(Crawford) and Huey Long are
quite likely to leave the theater
hand in hand, with Crawford the
winner and Huey the loser.
The plot deals with an honest man
(or was he?) named Willie Stark.
Willie educated himself and fought
his way to some measure of success
in the small, backward, presumably
Louisiana town in which he was
born. But Willie wasn't satisfied
with the rotten, dirty world as it
appeared to him, and he launched a
crusade to better the condition of
his fellow "hicks." "Serve the peo
ple and soak the rich." "Build bet
ter schools for everybody." "Free
and good medical care is not char

: ity. but a right of the people." These
[ were Willie's aims. (Or were they?)
And Willie Stark became gover
nor.
Willie Stark the governor and
Willie Stark the hick were two en
tirely different people. His wonder
ful ideas became real, not as God
sends, but as .monuments to Willie
Stark. The end now fully justified
the means, and Willie became the
center of the rotten dirty world that
he had set out to rectify. (Or had
j he?)
The plot is believable, fast mov
ing, and quite possibly true. It pic
tures Willie the sincere (or was
he?) politician. Willie's home life.
Willie the purloincr of his best
friend's girl. Willie the messiah.
Willie the dictator. And Willie with
a bullet in his stomach bemoaning
the fact—as did Alexander—that he
i could conquer no more worlds.
The picture, from start to finish,
is as real and stark as the dirty, rot
f ten world which it paints. And
whether you consider it a testimo
nial on the life of Long, a damnation
|of modern politics, or just some
great entertainment, you will be
I sure to leave the theater thinking
much about the character of Willie
Stark — messiah or dictator. And,
'ike this reviewer, you may not be
able to make up your mind whether
j or not Willie Stark—and the mil
lions of smaller, more insignificant
Willie Sharks —yas ever honest and
sincere..^ And somehow it seems im
portant.
Good flick, don't miss it.
