A. IRVING LEVORSEN
—Retiring Dean of the School of
Mineral Sciences
Dr. Charles F. Park Jr., interna
tionally rccogtiized expert on ore
deposits, was named today as the
new dean of the Stanfprd School of
Mineral Sciences.
He succeeds Dean A. I. Levorsen,
who will remain on the Stanford
faculty as professor of geology but
who wishes to be freed of adminis
trative work so that he can devote
his time to teaching and research in
petroleum geology.
President Wallace Sterling, in an
nouncing the shift of administrative
duties, effective immediately, ex
pressed his gratitude to Dean Le
vorsen for the fine work he has done
in carrying the school through the
period of post-war growth.
School Established
The president pointed out that
since October, 1947, when the
School of Mineral Sciences was es
tablished through merger of the
Department of Mining Engineering
and the Department of Geology, the
number of geology students has in
creased from 100 to 157, 78 of them
graduate students, and the faculty
from 18 to 22.
Dr. Park, who joined the Stanford
faculty in 1046, has won interna
tional recognition as an expert, in
economic geology and a specialist in
metalliferous ores.
For 15 years, before coming to
Stanford, he was with the U.S. eco
logical Survey, and worked up
through the ranks from junior geol
ogist to chief of the metalliferous
deposits section, in which capacity
he supervised several hundred pro
fessional geologists.
Directed Engineers
During the closing months of the
war and the first few months after
V-E Day, he directed Ihe U.S. Army
Engineers' survey of Germany's
mineral resources.
During 1048, he spent three
months mapping Ihc iron ore depos
its in the Itabiri highlands north of
Hio rle Janeiro in Brazil for the
Geological Survey, the State De ■
partment, and Ihe Brazilian govern
ment.
The new dean is best known,
however, for his work on the iron
deposits of the Lake Superior re
gion, the gold deposits of the south
ern Appalachians, zinc and manga
nese ores of the state of Washing
ton, ground water resources of
southeastern Oregon, and the hy
