WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.'l l/P>
Chairman Vinson (Dâ€ž Ga.) of the
House Armed Services Committee
said today lie thinks Congress
should have "exclusive power" to
say whether the draff should be put
into efTcct if it is extended on a
stand-by basis.
Vinson suggested such an exten
sion last week. Under it, the Selec
tive Service Act would he kept, on
the books but the armed forcc.s
would have no authority to induct
men unless Congress proclaimed an
emergency.
When Vinson first advanced the
proposal, Secretary of Defense
Johnson was before the House com
mittee. Without committing him
self to the stand-by draft proposal,
Johnson said the President should
also be given authority to set the
machinery in motion.
