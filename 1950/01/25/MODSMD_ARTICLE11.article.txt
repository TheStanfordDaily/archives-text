Lake Lagunita contained 48 mil

yesterday afternoon. This is 12 mil
lion gallons more than reported lasl
Thursday, but the lake is still 70
million gallons below capacity.
Lagunita \s intake has slowed down

but water is still flowing in steadily.
The overflow from Scarsville Lake
stopped Monday after several days
of dry, sunny weather.
