WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
Slate Acheson was reported to have
approved today a Congressional
move to send about $28,000,000 in
economic aid to the Chinese Nation
alists on Formosa.
Chairman Connolly (D., Tex.) of
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee told reporters that Acheson
"is agreeable" to the proposal for
limited economic assistance but said
Ihe Secretary did not suggest how
the money should be spent.
This money presumably would
come from a $100,000,000 China aid
fund which Congress approved in
1948. but which is due to be turned
back to the Treasury February 15
if it is not used before then.
