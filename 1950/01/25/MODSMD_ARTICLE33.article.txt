# Don't Trust 'Em

There's been a lot of matter, mostly uncom
plimentary, written about the 'Teen-Age Oliver,
but it doesn't seem to stop him.
liven at so sane and erudite an institution as
Stanford, the kiddies, some 'teen agers and
r-ome not, will have accidents which are caused
only by carelessness or recklessness.
Since these irresponsible drivers have been
scolded time and time aqain, we'd like to place
some ol the blame on another group. We think
that the people who lide with drunken, speed
mg drivers are just as much at lault as the ones
at the wheel.
Recently Stanford students have been in
volved in several accidents, most of which were

not ol the unavoidable type. One can blame the
winter weather and poor driving conditions, but
when a person drives 70 miles per hour on Al
pine road, we don't think he could make some
of the corners even if sober.
Maybe it's a misguided sense of bravery
which makes young people get inlo a deal like
that. Maybe some ol us feel that we're being
too goody-goody if we refuse to ride with some
one who's obviously not competent to drive.
Well, we think that it's not bravery but the
greatest kind of stupidity to take unnecessary
chances. Maybe we can't keep drunks and
reckless idiots from driving, but do we have to
get into cars with them? - M.K.
