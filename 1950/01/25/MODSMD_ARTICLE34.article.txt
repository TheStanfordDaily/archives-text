### JOHN HALL 
The overcoat detectives are saving radio. They are
albO saving themselves a little money besides.
So in honor of money, and in conjunction with John
Motheral who is fighting crime for two-bits a today,
we will hereby discuss these two-fisted, overcoat-

wearing, gun-toting, fast-talking,
hard - drinking, women - killing,
crime -stoppers, whom 1 choose to
call overcoat detectives. You can
t all them anything you want to.
These rugged rat-getters can be
heard any night of the week, on
any station, on any ladio. They
all pursue their paychecks in
somewhat similar plottings — the
opening murder, a throaty female,
another murder, baffled police,
one last murder, and a final show-

down in which the overcoat detective wows everybody
with a clever line and a closing clinch.
All this happens in 30 minutes. And, strangely
enough, people like me listen to it. Otherwise, all the
ladios in the world would be tossed into the nearest
junk can, and everybody would be saving their pen
nies to buy a television set to watch the ice-hockey
t "ames.
The main trouble with the overcoat detectives is
that the field is becoming too crowded. But, such as
happens in any crowded field, a lev; rise to the top.
These are the guys who talk the toughest, think the
fastest, and make out the mostest.
1 have compiled a list of the top 10 in the business,
but before I give it to you 1 must point out that the
comic strip detectives such as Dick Tracy, Mary
Worth, etc., and movie men ;>uch as Humphrey Bogart
ate not eligible. Here then, is the list. Its members
stand out as being a little bit different from the run of
the mill
I—Sam Spade
2— Philip Marlowe
:i—Danny Clover
4—Joe Frisco
s—Richard Diamond
li—The Sain I
7—Christopher London

B—Boston Bliickie
9—George Valentine
10—Sherlock Holmes
In Memoriam, 1 should make a brief statement about
Pat Novak, the undefeated champ, who mysteriously
disappeared last summer. Novak would have rated
right at the top of the list. His record of nine murders
in 30 minutes still stands.
With Patsey gone, Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade
has to get first nod. Spade has as big a Sunday follow
ing as church. Like Novak, he chases crooks in San
Francisco. Never loses a case.
Number two man, an L.A. private eye, is Philip Mar
lowe. He's a Saturday night sleuth. Has plenty of
savvy. Tough as an Encina steak, Raymond Chandler
is his brain.
Danny Clover plays it straight. He's a real cop. He
works on the "Gaudiest, most violent, lonesomest mile
in the worId—BROADWAY IS HIS BEAT." Danny
has the sympathetic touch.
Joe Frisco, who has the same voice as Pat Novak
used to (Jack Webb), has moved from the Frisco wa
terfront to the L.A. Police Department. Too much
gushing about L.A. police, but Joe's a hard-working
bay. He lays out a DRAGNET every Thursday night.
Richard Diamond (Dick Powell) and The Saint
(Vincent Price) are both smooth talkers. But don't
monkey around with 'em. They're dynamite when
pushed too far. Diamond is a Sunday sparkler, The
Saint goes on Monday night.
The rest of the boys get down to what is sometimes
referi ed to as mediocre. Chris London, a new eye
who has had only one crime thrown at him so far, is
handled by Glenn Ford on Sunday afternoon. He
throws around as many Chinese proverbs as Charlie
Chan.
Boston Blackie and George Valentine were just
thrown in the fill out the list, and Sherlock Holmes is
getting a little old and outdated, but they're all sin
cere.
The rest of the overcoats—Captain Hartshorn of the
Death Squad, Mr. District Attorney, Mr. Keene, Jack
Packard, and Dick Harding, Counterspy—are strictly
from hunger. Like the left-handed masseuse, they
always rub rne the wrong way.

The overcoat detectives are saving radio. They are
albO saving themselves a little money besides.
So in honor of money, and in conjunction with John

terfront to the L.A. Police Department. Too much
gushing about L.A. police, but Joe's a hard-working
bay. He lays out a DRAGNET every Thursday night.
Richard Diamond (Dick Powell) and The Saint
(Vincent Price) are both smooth talkers. But don't
monkey around with 'em. They're dynamite when
pushed too far. Diamond is a Sunday sparkler, The
Saint goes on Monday night.
The rest of the boys get down to what is sometimes
referi ed to as mediocre. Chris London, a new eye
who has had only one crime thrown at him so far, is
handled by Glenn Ford on Sunday afternoon. He
throws around as many Chinese proverbs as Charlie
Chan.
Boston Blackie and George Valentine were just
thrown in the fill out the list, and Sherlock Holmes is
getting a little old and outdated, but they're all sin
cere.
The rest of the overcoats—Captain Hartshorn of the
Death Squad, Mr. District Attorney, Mr. Keene, Jack
Packard, and Dick Harding, Counterspy—are strictly
from hunger. Like the left-handed masseuse, they
always rub rne the wrong way.

The overcoat detectives are saving radio. They are
albO saving themselves a little money besides.
So in honor of money, and in conjunction with John
Motheral who is fighting crime for two-bits a today,
we will hereby discuss these two-fisted, overcoat-

wearing, gun-toting, fast-talking,
hard - drinking, women - killing,
crime -stoppers, whom 1 choose to
call overcoat detectives. You can
t all them anything you want to.
These rugged rat-getters can be
heard any night of the week, on
any station, on any ladio. They
all pursue their paychecks in
somewhat similar plottings — the
opening murder, a throaty female,
another murder, baffled police,
one last murder, and a final show-

down in which the overcoat detective wows everybody
with a clever line and a closing clinch.
All this happens in 30 minutes. And, strangely
enough, people like me listen to it. Otherwise, all the
ladios in the world would be tossed into the nearest
junk can, and everybody would be saving their pen
nies to buy a television set to watch the ice-hockey
t "ames.
The main trouble with the overcoat detectives is
that the field is becoming too crowded. But, such as
happens in any crowded field, a lev; rise to the top.
These are the guys who talk the toughest, think the
fastest, and make out the mostest.
1 have compiled a list of the top 10 in the business,
but before I give it to you 1 must point out that the
comic strip detectives such as Dick Tracy, Mary
Worth, etc., and movie men ;>uch as Humphrey Bogart
ate not eligible. Here then, is the list. Its members
stand out as being a little bit different from the run of
the mill
I—Sam Spade

10—Sherlock Holmes
In Memoriam, 1 should make a brief statement about
Pat Novak, the undefeated champ, who mysteriously
disappeared last summer. Novak would have rated
right at the top of the list. His record of nine murders
in 30 minutes still stands.
With Patsey gone, Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade
has to get first nod. Spade has as big a Sunday follow
ing as church. Like Novak, he chases crooks in San
Francisco. Never loses a case.
Number two man, an L.A. private eye, is Philip Mar
lowe. He's a Saturday night sleuth. Has plenty of
savvy. Tough as an Encina steak, Raymond Chandler
is his brain.
Danny Clover plays it straight. He's a real cop. He
works on the "Gaudiest, most violent, lonesomest mile
in the worId—BROADWAY IS HIS BEAT." Danny
has the sympathetic touch.
Joe Frisco, who has the same voice as Pat Novak
used to (Jack Webb), has moved from the Frisco wa
terfront to the L.A. Police Department. Too much
gushing about L.A. police, but Joe's a hard-working
bay. He lays out a DRAGNET every Thursday night.
