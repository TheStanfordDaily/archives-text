### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 24 (A't
Tiongshore leader Harry Bridge*'
perjury trial exploded with curses
today. A defense witness denied he
recruited Bridges into the Commu
nist Party and wound up by calling
the chief government prosecutor a
liar.
Near the end of the noisiest ses
• ion the turbulent trial has produced,
witness Bruce B. Jones, Mill Valley
longshoreman, shouted lo Chief
Prosecutor K. Joseph Donohue:
"You're a liar, Donohue. Scho
maker is too, Anybody is who ever'
said I signed Bridges up."
Jones earlier had called John
Schomaker "u G— d liar" for
testifying that he and Jones re
cruited the Australian-born Bridges
into the Communist Party in Octo
ber, 1933.
Once Jones pointed his finger at
Eruce Barber, local Immigration Bu
reau chief, and accused him of "try
ing to intimidate me with your Ges
tapo."
Another time, recounting inter
union organizational fights on the
East and Gulf Coasts, the witness
called Joseph Ryan's AFL Ijong
■ hore union "a gangster union," and
added: "Men were murdered and
beaten up there by ex-convicts, and
Tom Dewey never investigated. Why
don't you investigate some of these
things, Mr. Prosecutor?"
Biidges, head of the CIO Long
shore Union, was indicted for per
jury on the accusation that at his
J!)46 citizenship hearing he swore
lulsely he was not a Communis!
