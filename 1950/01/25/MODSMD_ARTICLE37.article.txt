"Over'learning" rather than lust
minute cramming i.s the Lest way to
tudy, according to Professor
W. Max, chairman of the Physiology
Department of the New York Uni
versity College of Dentistry.
"Students," he says, "find it very
!(rnpting to stop work when they
have once gone over the material be -
fore them and feel they have under
stood it." He believes this is wrong
because of the rapidity with which
memory impressions are bound to
fade.
Professor Max's advice to the slit
dent is "Go over the work quickly
once more —diive it in and clinch it."
He remarks that he has no patience
with students who complain that they
don't know how to concentrate. He
contends that concentration is merely
another habit and ought to be as
readily acquired us others. The way
to begin to study, he adds, is "simply
to begin."
"Don't wait for inspiration or for
the mood to strike you," he cautions.
"Nor should you permit yourself to
indulge in thoughts like, 'This as
signment is too long' or 'D— that
Prof.' or '1 guess I could really let
that go to some other time.'
"That type of attitude throws an
extra load on your mental machinery,
and by making you work against a
handicap, makes i1 harder for you to
commence."
Professor Max adds, "Do your
studying alone, yud you'll find it
much easier to concentrate."
