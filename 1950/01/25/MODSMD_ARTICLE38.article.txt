# Japan's Turn To Democracy Is Questioned
## 
### 
Dr. Kazuo Kawai, Japanese na
tional now teaching at Stanford,
questioned his country's inevitable
democratic transformation last night
before a Tuesday Evening Series
audience assembled in Memorial
Hall.
Although he praised the success
of the American military occupation
of Japan, the outspoken former
newsman cautioned American.'-,
against sitting "calmly back in the
belief that the whole matter is t-;alc*
in General MacArthm's hands."
Aid, How Long?
Titling his hour-long lecture, "Ja
pan: A Focal Point in the Cold
War," Dr. Kawai put special em
phasis on those chiel laciors-i (eco
nomic, political, and phy.ical) which
he said tended to aid the spread of
Communism in Japan.
In a discussion of the pressing
economic situation, the American
educated lecturer pointed out that
"the apparent economic recovery of
Japan has been largely due to the
very artificial factor of American
aid," and ". . . certainly the United
States cannot be expected to sup
port Japan forever."
He said a real economic recovery
depended mainly on Japanese ac
cess to sources of raw materials and
foreign markets, noting that she lost
many of her life-blood shipping fa
cilities, factories, labor efficiency,
and colonies as a result of the war.
Economic Union
By way of a solution to this prob
lem, Dr. Kawai recommended some
sort of central organization to incite
economic co-operation among the
Far East nations, with objectives
loosely paralleling those of the ECA.
On the cold war scene, Dr. Kawai
expressed some alarm at the fast
growing spread of Communism in
the Far East, especially in China,
one of Japan's main pie-war trade
outlets and sources of raw mate
rials.
He said the Communists promise
the ill - satisfied and unemployed
Japanese worker large-scale trade
with Communist China and Russia
in return for Red support.
"The only way to "tonfound the
Communists is not by preaching de
mocracy in the abstract but by ac
tually providing the Japanese people
with an opportunity for a more se
cure and abundant economic life
than that which they possess today,"
Dr. Kawai explained.
Douhl U.S. Defense
Turning to a discussion of politi
cal anil physical insecurity, Dr. Ka
wai said "the Japanese have come
to hold serious doubts as to the de
pendability of American military
protection.
"Is Japan included within the
American line of defense which will
be held at all costs? Or is Japan
regarded merely as an 'expendable'?
These are questions which are seri
ously disturbing the Japanese to
day.
"As long as this uncertainty con
tinues," the speaker said, ". . . the
Japanese will be paralyzed, or :.t
least partially inhibited, in their ef
forts to cope with the Communist
threat."
