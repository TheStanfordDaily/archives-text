### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 24 l/Pl-Two of
New York's most expensive pieces
of baseball bric-a-brac were locked
up in the front office showcases to
day when Joe DiMaggio and Jackie
Robinson signed their 1950 con
tracts.
DiMaggio. one of baseball's high
est-salaried players, inked a New
York Yankee pact calling for an es
timated $100,000, equivalent to the
sum he drew last year. Robinson,
the Brooklyn Dodgers' counterpart
to the great Yankee centerfielder,
agreed to terms calling for an esti
mated $35,000. Both were one-year
pacts.
DiMaggio, looking fit and "feeling
better than I have since before the
war," declined to disclose the ac
tual figure, but said he "'would do
as well financially this year as last."
Robinson, starting his fourth sea
son as a Dodger, now is the high
est paid Brooklyn player since
Branch Rickey took over as presi
dent of the club. It is believed he
also is the highest salaried perform
er ever to wear a Dodger uniform.
Dazzy Vance, famous pitcher of the
'20. 5, was paid $100,000 for three
years. That was believed to be the
most money ever paid to a Brook
lynite.
