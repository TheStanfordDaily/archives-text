# Famous Alum Will Speak On 'World Government'
## 
### 
Stanley Weigel, prominent mem
ber of the Stanford class 01 '2(3, will
return Monday to speak in Cubber
ley Auditorium at 8 p.m. on the fun
damentals of a world government.
Class orator and president of
ASSU, Weigel walked away with all
major debating honors when debate
contests took banner headlines away
from Stanford sports. His strength
was said to lie in "polish, good na
ture, good humor, and human in
terest."
He was elected chairman of the
statewide council of the California
United World Federalists after its
northern and southern divisions were
merged at a convention held in the
Fairmont Hotel last weekend.
The official delegates from the
Stanford group were Dick O'Connell,
Fritjof Thygeson, and John Marion.
Receiving a law degree from Stan
ford in 1928, Weigel worked to the
head of Landell, Weigel, and Crocker,
a San Francisco law firm. The firm
offers a yearly scholarship to a
Stanford student.
He began his debating career as a
member of the freshman squad in
1923. The following year he won
honors in the varsity competition in
criminal syndicalism debate, and also
in the Jotfre and political forensic
meets. In December of 1924 Weigel
captured the Pacific Coast extempo

raneous speaking championship.
A month later Weigel led the Stan
ford team against the Oxford de
haters. Taking the negative on "Re
solved. that this house is opposed to
the principle of prohibition," he
spoke pessimistically in terms of
"hangovers" and "mornings-after."
Audience ballot chose the Stanford
trio and Weigel as "the best humor
ous speaker on the Stanford team."
He climaxed his senior year by tying
for second place in a contest with the
University of California for the JofTre
debate medal, upholding the security
value of the Locarno Treaties for
France.
Acclaimed "past master of the in
formal style used so extensively by
the Oxford debaters," Weigel stood
away from the American ideal of de
bate demanding precise, logical pre
sentation. The Oxford concept elim
inated judges and made arousing
audience interest the first criterion
of good speech.
Between debating contests, Wei
gel acted as president of ASSU, class
orator, chairman of Men's Council,
and Quad drama editor. He was also
member of the honorary debate so
ciety and the men's honor society.
His discussion of world govern
ment is being sponsored jointly by
the lIR and the Stanford chapter of
the United World Federalists.
