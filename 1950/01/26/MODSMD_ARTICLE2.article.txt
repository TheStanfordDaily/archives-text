TAIPEI, Formosa Chinese Na
tionalist heavy bombers attacked
Shanghai again today, reporting di
rect hits on seven ships.

Communists to use.

houses on Shanghai's river front
were left in flames. They said the
bombed ships were from 1,000- to
,'5,000-tonncrs.

mainland port opposite Formosa.
They claimed many small craft in
the harbor were sunk or damaged.
