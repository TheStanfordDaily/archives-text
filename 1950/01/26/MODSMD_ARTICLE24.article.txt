# VILLAGE VOTING BOOTHS REOPENED
## Petition Presented to Excom Claims Late Opening of Polls Restricted Vote 
### JIM THURBER Managing Editor, The Daily 
The polls will be open at the Village today from 11:3U a.m. to
12:30 p.m. lor those Village students who were unable to vote in
yesterday's election.
Excom passed this motion last night alter a petition bearing 130
signatures of Village students asking for the polls to be reopened

'was introduced by Jerry Hill.
Hill stated that the Village booth
was opened forty minutes late, and
thus approximately 50 students failed
to vote.
"Excom's action is unconstitution
al," Jim Thurber, Daily Managing
Editor stated. "Once the polls have
been declared closed and the ballots
counted, the polls cannot be reopened.
The only way out is to hold a com
pletely new election."
The revised ASSU Constitution by
laws state: " â€”ballots will be countcd
in a public place after the closing of
the polls."
Two prominent members of the
Law School faculty were contacted
for an interpretation of this clause,
but they declined to make public
statements as no formal request had
been filed,
No Results Announced
However, one professor stated that
such action would never be allowed
in a state or national election. In
these elections, the ballot boxes an;
not, unlocked until the polls am
closed, all the ballots are collected,
and the doors locked
However, in spite of the protest
| raised by Larry Hoff and Gregg
Bcmis, Excom passed the motion to
'reopen the polls and withhold all
j election results until the new ballot-,
were counted.
'The ASSU committed itself to
I have this hooth open at the time
! stated," ASSU President. Hank Rosin
said. "Therefore, we are obliged to
have this booth open tomorrow."
According to the ASSU Constitu
j tion, "The Executive Committee shail
! have the power to regulate and
j supervise all student elections, sub
j iect to the provisions of this consti
tution."
Furthermore, Excom was not legal
ly obliged to pass on the petition of
the Village students.
"The petition is invalid; it has Jo
include 5 percent of the student,
body," Secretary Ann Mitchell stated,
"therefore the petition indicates only
the sentiments of t>u interested
J party."
Campus Polls Open
Hoff said that even though die poll
were late in opening at the Village,
the students who were unable
j vote could have voted later at. the
! Village, or on campus if they had to
: come to class.
The campus polls were open until
3:30 p.m.
Rosin brought up the point that,
since Excom had to validate all elec
tions, the election still wasn't final
and that it was perfectly all light ! o
reopen the polls
"But the majority of the student
j know who led today's voting,"
Thurber said. "Since onlv (>92 men
voted, opening the polls tomoriow
could completely change the eloc -
j tion."
Candidates Dick Thacker and Don
i Temby, two of the three top men in
! today's balloting were publicly con
gratulated at dinner in their respec
tive dorms.
Hank Grandin felt that the ASSU
i had acted unconstitutionally and
[moved for a new election. However,
:he withdrew hir. motion when lie
found that the sentiments of Excom
were against holding a new election
