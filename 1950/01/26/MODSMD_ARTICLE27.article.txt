# BULL SESSION

### BILL DAILEY 
I've got a story to tell you. It's a story about a
I lick. Yeah, that's right. A hick just like you. This
hick's name was Willie. Willie Dailey.
Willie was just a poor farm boy. He worked on a
farm owned by a man named Stan Ford. Willie never
had any formal education. In fact, he couldn't even

read or write. Stan Ford used to
take advantage of Willie's ignor
ance by cheating him on pay day.
Willie was thirty years old before
he discovered Herbert Hoover's pic
ture wa.i not on a three-dollar bill.
It was on a four-dollar bill.
Ye«, Willie was just a stupid hick
Hut Willie had a heart. He alsc
had two kidneys, a gall bladder, and
.. hangnail on his index finger. But
it was his heart that was the im-

portant thing. For Willie's heart told him that he be
longed to the people of the state. Once before Willie
had belonged to the people of the state, but he was
released after serving two years.
This time Willie was sure he heard the people call
ing him. He decided to run for Governor. Throughout
the state, the other hicks supported him. They began
to echo his familiar chant: "Willie! Willie! We want
Willie!" Willie's name took on a new importance,
even on the national scene. And then one day he
was attacked in the newspaper by tho:;e two famous
columnists, Droop Earson and Westcrook Hegleg.
Willie knew he had arrived.

Some ol his supporters began to eulogize him as the
King oi' the Hicks. From this group came the long
remembered name of "Old Hickory."
And so Willie was elected to the Governorship.
The election wasn't even close. Willie won in a land
slide. It was messier this way, but eventually he got
all the dirt washed off.
But now that Willie was the Governor, he discov
ered that the people who had backed his campaign
were demanding lavors from him. Millicent Pitas,
his shrewd woman campaign manager, demanded a
new city hall. So he had to build a new city hall for
Mil Pitas.
Little by little, Willie himself began to long for
some of the spoils of his campaign. So Willie became
corrupt. He spent the money of the people 011 things
for his own personal pleasure. He built himself a
fur-lined swimming pool. He also constructed a
golden-walled personal bathroom. Willie's power had
gone to his head!
But the worst blow for Willie came when his own
sou was injured while playing for the State University
in a Canasta game. Tilings began to look bad for
Willie Dailey. Despite his present prosperity, Willie
knew he must begin to save for the future. He began
to economize wherever he could. He even stooped
to picking up cigarette butts. It was while he was
doing this one day that he was assassinated. While
bending over to pick up a cigarette, Willie was shot.
They had always said Willie would get it in the end.

his shrewd woman campaign manager, demanded a
new city hall. So he had to build a new city hall for
Mil Pitas.
Little by little, Willie himself began to long for
some of the spoils of his campaign. So Willie became
corrupt. He spent the money of the people 011 things
for his own personal pleasure. He built himself a
fur-lined swimming pool. He also constructed a
golden-walled personal bathroom. Willie's power had
gone to his head!
But the worst blow for Willie came when his own
sou was injured while playing for the State University
in a Canasta game. Tilings began to look bad for
Willie Dailey. Despite his present prosperity, Willie
knew he must begin to save for the future. He began
to economize wherever he could. He even stooped
to picking up cigarette butts. It was while he was
doing this one day that he was assassinated. While
bending over to pick up a cigarette, Willie was shot.
They had always said Willie would get it in the end.

I've got a story to tell you. It's a story about a
I lick. Yeah, that's right. A hick just like you. This
hick's name was Willie. Willie Dailey.
Willie was just a poor farm boy. He worked on a
farm owned by a man named Stan Ford. Willie never
had any formal education. In fact, he couldn't even

read or write. Stan Ford used to
take advantage of Willie's ignor
ance by cheating him on pay day.
Willie was thirty years old before
he discovered Herbert Hoover's pic
ture wa.i not on a three-dollar bill.
It was on a four-dollar bill.
Ye«, Willie was just a stupid hick
Hut Willie had a heart. He alsc
had two kidneys, a gall bladder, and
.. hangnail on his index finger. But
it was his heart that was the im-

portant thing. For Willie's heart told him that he be
longed to the people of the state. Once before Willie
had belonged to the people of the state, but he was
released after serving two years.
This time Willie was sure he heard the people call
ing him. He decided to run for Governor. Throughout
the state, the other hicks supported him. They began
to echo his familiar chant: "Willie! Willie! We want
Willie!" Willie's name took on a new importance,
even on the national scene. And then one day he
was attacked in the newspaper by tho:;e two famous
columnists, Droop Earson and Westcrook Hegleg.
Willie knew he had arrived.

Some ol his supporters began to eulogize him as the
King oi' the Hicks. From this group came the long
remembered name of "Old Hickory."
And so Willie was elected to the Governorship.
The election wasn't even close. Willie won in a land
slide. It was messier this way, but eventually he got
all the dirt washed off.
But now that Willie was the Governor, he discov
ered that the people who had backed his campaign
were demanding lavors from him. Millicent Pitas,
his shrewd woman campaign manager, demanded a
new city hall. So he had to build a new city hall for
Mil Pitas.
