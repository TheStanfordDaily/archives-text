# World Government
## CAMPUS OPINION 
### 
To the Editor:
I see by The Daily that one of our campus
sponsored speakers, Weigel, is noted for his humor.
It really should tickle his funny bone to speak on such
a topic as world government on our campus. The con
cept, impossible for anyone to deal with and of in
terest to no one except Utopians, is a contradiction of
terms.
How can a government be a world government if

Russia refuses to join? Pravda has already denounced
the idea of a world government and has continued
its warlike actions in the UN where they have used
their veto power and "take a walk" tactics to frus
trate the wants of the majority of the nations.
It seems that Stanford is setting a policy of featur
ing these idealistic men Clarence Streit and Herbert
Agar, both Union Now men, and now Weigel. What's
happened to the practical thinkers?
