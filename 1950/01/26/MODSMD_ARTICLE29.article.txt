# Post Office History Marked By Long Lines, 'Unmentionables' Strange Mail
## 
### ERLING FORLAND 
Many strange things have arrived
in the mails at the Stanford Post
Office since it opened in 1900. Be
fore a Big Game one year a bear
paw was found in the mail bag
when it arrived here.
And quite often a box filled witli
filmy "unmentionables" breaks open
and has to be handed loose to the
blushing coed.
But the pri2e story comes from
the era of the 'thirties when a Stan
lord rough used to carry a trained
pigeon on his shoulder. One day
when he went to get a cup of coffee
he left the pigeon iri his post office
box.
Postal regulations declare that

nothing for which postage hasn't
been paid can be placed in a post
office box. The clerks dutifully
weighed the fowl and placed the
necessary postage due stamps on it.
When the rough returned he was
notified of the claims against his
pigeon. When he paid his fine, he
got the bird.
Distribution Complaint
Every so often student reformers
accuse the post office of inefficiency
in distributing mail because the line
for mail before the A-M window is
much longer in rush periods than
the line before the N-Z window.
The U.S. Post Office requires each
employee to work eight hours a day.
To comply with this regulation the

clerk at the A-M window must han
dle most of the mail, while the N-Z
clerk distributes the remainder and
directs mis-addressed mail, said Su
perintendent John Callahan. So,
long mail lines will probably con
tinue.
lit'h>w Capacity
The Stanford Post Office is show
ing a need for repair and expan
sion. Though it has been remod
eled, it still is intended to serve only
2,0U0 students. It has been painted
only once since 1926. Since the Post
Office Department won't put up
buildings on leased land and Stan
ford property cannot be sold, the
University will have to do any
building or remodeling.
