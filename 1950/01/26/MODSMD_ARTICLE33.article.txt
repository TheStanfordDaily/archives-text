# Director Tells Foreign Work Qualifications
## 
### 
A Stanford residence director J
who worked with displaced per- j
sons in post - war Europe advised j
students to learn at least one Euro- !
pean language if they plan to go
into welfare service abroad.
Speaking to the Stanford Foreign j
Career Association, Miss Edmee
Bwulanger said that leadership abil
ity and experience are stressed by
relief organizations working in Eu
rope.
Miss Boulanger, who worked with I
D.P.'s under the UNKRA program
in Germany, described the organi
zation as an agency which had
charge of the many people moved
around by Hitler for the conven
ience of Nazism.
The Army Hist concentrated thefn j
in camp*; and then left them to the i
administration of UNKRA.
Orphans Taken Home
Abandoned and orphaned chil- j
dren were taken to a home, from
where many of them weer brought
to America for adoption. The dis
placed persons were given their
choice of returning to their own !
countries.
Many did so, but some came back
to the camps in a few weeks, finding I
conditions in their former homes
undesirable. UNRRA made provi
sions for D.P. college students to
continue their education at the Uni
versity of Heidelberg.
As Administrative Assistant, Miss
Boulanger trained in College Park,
Md.; London, England; and in
France, at the continental training
school. While there, she lived in a
French school, where she and other
UNRRA workers slept in long rows
of cots. The only bathing facilities
were small spigots sticking out from
the wall, until some of the men who
were engineers built primitive
showers.
Camp Mailman
When she finally arrived in Hei
delberg at the American UNRRA
headquarters, Miss Boulanger's first
job was to organize mail for camp
personnel, who collected it only
once a week because of transporta
tion inconveniences.
The UNRRA workers lived in a
beautiful home which had belonged
to a former Nazi, and there Miss
Boulanger was in charge of supplies
for it. As the headquarters grew
from about 10 people to over 40, she
had to organize recreation for them
and distribute the liquor supply.
According to Miss Boulanger,
many of the displaced persons were
intelligent skilled or professional
people, adaptable to camp circum
stances. Professional people were
allowed to pratcice in the camps,
since the idea was to keep them as
well adjusted as possible.

allowed to pratcice in the camps,
since the idea was to keep them as
well adjusted as possible.
A Stanford residence director J
who worked with displaced per- j
sons in post - war Europe advised j
students to learn at least one Euro- !
pean language if they plan to go
into welfare service abroad.
Speaking to the Stanford Foreign j
Career Association, Miss Edmee
Bwulanger said that leadership abil
ity and experience are stressed by
relief organizations working in Eu
rope.
Miss Boulanger, who worked with I
D.P.'s under the UNKRA program
in Germany, described the organi
zation as an agency which had
charge of the many people moved
around by Hitler for the conven
ience of Nazism.
The Army Hist concentrated thefn j
in camp*; and then left them to the i
administration of UNKRA.
Orphans Taken Home
Abandoned and orphaned chil- j
dren were taken to a home, from
where many of them weer brought
to America for adoption. The dis
placed persons were given their
choice of returning to their own !
countries.
Many did so, but some came back
to the camps in a few weeks, finding I
conditions in their former homes
undesirable. UNRRA made provi
sions for D.P. college students to
continue their education at the Uni
versity of Heidelberg.
As Administrative Assistant, Miss
Boulanger trained in College Park,
Md.; London, England; and in
France, at the continental training
school. While there, she lived in a
French school, where she and other
UNRRA workers slept in long rows
of cots. The only bathing facilities
were small spigots sticking out from
the wall, until some of the men who
were engineers built primitive
showers.
Camp Mailman
When she finally arrived in Hei
delberg at the American UNRRA
headquarters, Miss Boulanger's first
job was to organize mail for camp
personnel, who collected it only
once a week because of transporta
tion inconveniences.
The UNRRA workers lived in a
beautiful home which had belonged
to a former Nazi, and there Miss
Boulanger was in charge of supplies
for it. As the headquarters grew
from about 10 people to over 40, she
had to organize recreation for them
and distribute the liquor supply.
According to Miss Boulanger,
many of the displaced persons were
intelligent skilled or professional
people, adaptable to camp circum
stances. Professional people were
allowed to pratcice in the camps,
since the idea was to keep them as
well adjusted as possible.
