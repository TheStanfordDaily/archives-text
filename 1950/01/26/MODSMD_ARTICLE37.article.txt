## On The Bench 
### 
Now that the basketeers are taking a break, and presumably trying to
(inure nut what they did last Saturday nighi that they didn't do the night
before, The Bench again throws a bit of Smogasbord out on the table for
you-all to digest as you see fit.
The sportsters of the Associated Press unconsciously paid a small tribute
it Stanford last week when they voted on "Ihe Greatest football Player ot
Last 50 Years." Indian Jim Thorpe, whom—we are sad to report—did
lot go to Stanford, won the honor by an overwhelming majority. But Stan
lord and Army were the only two schools in the nation to get two men men
tioned in the balloting. It was Ernie Nevers and I*rankie Albert toi Stan
lord and Lieutenants Blanchard and Davis for the Pointers. And both Cadets
were war-time ball players, as opposed to Stanford's pre-war vintage. The
Farm was the only PCC school to have a player mentioned for the honor,
incidentally.

Television is here to stay, or so at least thinks the Stanford Athletic
Department. Master of Information, Don Liebendorfer, informs us that
three positive dates and two possible have been set for the TV ing of
home basketball games. The UCLA games on the 10th and 25th of Feb
ruary will go on the air waves—or whatever waves the thing uses. As
will the Trojan game on the 24th of February. The Associated people are
idso passionate to TV the SC game of the 11th and the Cal game of March
Ith. but they are having difficulty getting clear air time. Anybody own
a set?

Football-all-year-'round Department: Loss of three good fullbacks,
Mitchell, De Young, and Klein, is the greatest position loss the 1950 gridders
must lace. But it isn't that spot that Coach Marchie Schwartz has got his
sights set upon right now. It's the line. Marchie is, of course, quite pleased
with the up and coming center of last year's Freshman line, Broderick,
Manoogian, Romano, and Vick, but he says the big help will probably
come from last year's Junior Varsity line. "Those boys received some
wonderful training from Jim Cox last year," the Coach said. "And they're
the fellows that are going to have to come through to give us a really great
team next year."
We pressed him for names, and he rattled off a few, explaining that there
were more, but off hand he liked: Don Lucas. Bruce Mikesell, Bernie Tokarz,
Doug Tharner, Dave Worley, Ed Taylor. Leon King, Bob Latham, Bob Scott,
I c e Daly, Owen Powell, Roil Murphy, and Blondy Broome.
Chuck Taylor, who is well on his way toward being a Stanford immortal,
turned out three undefeated Freshman football teams. Next year his
i..,st one, once tied, will be seniors—it they are still around. It is amazing
to note that on last year's first string there was but one man who played
mi that first undefeated team of Chucks —Tex White. Others that helped a
lot: Boyd Benson, Tommy Shaw, Dick Abraham, and Wes Poulson. There
were eleven men from the great '48 squad who, as sophomores, were travel
squad men. Most outstanding were, of course: Kerkorian, Hugasiart, Cone,
Mr Col I and Jack Rye. Rye, with the exception of Cal's Souza. was the best
defensive end we saw last year. You're welcome, Jack.

l)is and Data: Public congratulations to Guard Jess Cone, who last week
mnouneed his engagement to Miss Natale Seadero of Antioch. Wedding
lulls will ring this summer. Yep, men, she's beautiful Rumor-time
Lis it that Norm Standlee, ace Card fullback of yesteryear, will not be back
it his behind-the-line spot with the SF 49ers next year. Going into private
nterprise Bruno Banducci, a great Stanford and 49er guard, may
return to the Farm for a little booktime come Spring, before reporting to
Buck Shaw's summer camp. He was an Engineer here before the war, but
may go into the Ed Department with an eye toward coaching Rugby
injuries to date include Ralph Davidson, who has a slipped disk in his spine
mikl Chuck Ilirsch who sustained a neck injury in Monday's scrum. Hirsch
was luckier last year—only broke six ribs. Carefree game, rugby.
West brook Sullivan—'scuse, it's Prescott— of the SF Examiner was be
moaning the fact that the superhuman QB's, Leßaron and Celeri, were not
dial ted pro-ward until the tenth draft, and that 117 players were chosen
ahead of them. Sad, huh? .... He didn't mention the astounding fact
that BIG Rod Franz—a two year all-American—was not asked for until
the 338th-some-odd draft. Multiply that by the number of teams in the
league—l3—and you have an idea of how many players were drafted be
oro Franz. A sad commentary on all-American pickers, but not on Franz,
who has completed four years of good, if not great, ball Somebody
mentioned that Franz was considering a movie career ala exUSCer Mickey
McArdle No basketball games this weekend, and so we again leave
>ff the column with a cheerful note.
