dropped from the Stanford basket
ball squad.
Everett Dean announced this
fact last night. He stated that
"Gelber would no longer be with
the squad because of continued
differences of opinion," Dean
also added that "the reasons were
clearly pointed out to Gelber
himself."
The move was not the result of a
sudden decision. It was carefully
considered, and then made in the
hope , that it would be in the best
interests of all concerned. Gelber
has ridden the bench during the last
three contests.

Marv Gelber, for two years a
starting varsity guard, has been,
dropped from the Stanford basket
ball squad.
Everett Dean announced this
fact last night. He stated that
"Gelber would no longer be with
the squad because of continued
differences of opinion," Dean
also added that "the reasons were
clearly pointed out to Gelber
himself."
The move was not the result of a
sudden decision. It was carefully
considered, and then made in the
hope , that it would be in the best
interests of all concerned. Gelber
has ridden the bench during the last
three contests.
