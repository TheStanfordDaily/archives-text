### 
REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 25 (A y )â€”
Nassar Jehanbani, 27. who said he
was a prince of Iran, was sentenced
to San Quentin Prison today for
writing bad checks.
Until recently he was a post
graduate student at Stanford LTni
versity. Testimony at his trial re
vealed that 17 persons had paid him
money. One, Professor A. Mirwin
Levorsen. geologist and Dean of the
School of Mineral Sciences at the
University, cashed a $1,000 check
that bounced.
Superior Judge Murray Draper
said, "Evidence at the trial shows
that by the defendant's own admis
also he had run up bad debts to the
amount of $11,000 in about one year
and a half through the issuance of
bad checks."
J udi/c Draper will recommend
that U.S. immigration authorities
order Jehanbani deported immedi
ately. This would amount to a com
mutation of the prison sentence.
