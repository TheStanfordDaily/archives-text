# Strong National Spirit Seen Arising From Diverse Backgrounds In Malaya
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Malaya is a country rich in the
production of tin, rubber, and copra.
But above all, she is a country rich
in tolerance. Within her boundaries
are more than six million people of
all nationalities and creeds, living
together in harmony and peace.
In a Malayan town one will find a
Hindu temple, a Jewish synagogue,
a Mohammedan mosque, a Catholic
cathedral, a Protestant church, and
a Buddhist monastery, all flourish
ing close to one 'another. In a Ma
layan schoolroom one will find Jew
ish, French, Chinese, British, Dutch,
Malay, Indian, and American chil
dren working and studying togeth
er.
Although all these national
groups, with different cultural
backgrounds, have in the past lived
together with a minimum of fric
tion, there has been little mixing,
either socially or economically, of
the various groups. Each national
group has been content to keep it
self to itself. Because of this, many,
observers are of the opinion that
Malaya can never be self-govern
ing, since there can never be a com
mon citizenship for all the groups.
Growth of Nationalism
But I disagree. I think that in the
last few years, a spirit of national
ism has grown among the people
living in Malaya. Whereas in the
past they have looked upon them
selves as Chinese, or Malays, or In
dians, they now look upon them
selves as the people of Malaya. Ties
with the countries from which their
forefathers came are being severed,
while their bonds with Malaya, their
home, are being strengthened. In
the near future, a common citizen
ship will not only be possible, but
it will be inevitable.
Every Malayan is looking forward
to the day when Malaya receives
self - government. Great Britain's
exploitation of the people of Malaya
has been the cause of much dissat
isfaction, and her stupid colonial
policies have not particularly en
deared her to them. One of these
policies appears to be the keeping
of Malayans in minor governmental
positions for no other reason than to
keep the power in the hands of men
sent out by Whitehall.
Queen's Scholars
Perhaps the most illuminating ex
ample of this bad policy can be
found in the great metropolis of
Singapore. There are at present in
Singapore five men and two women
Queen's Scholars in government and
municipal posts. They represent the

creme dc la crcmc of the Malayan
intelligentsia as they have all been
awarded at one time or another the
coveted Queen's Scholarship for
higher studies in Oxford or Cam
bridge. All of them now hold posts
as either assistant this or deputy
that. Not one of them is the head of
a department, although most have
long years of experience behind
them.
In many cases raw and inexperi
enced recruits from the so-called
"home country" have been placed
above them. It is of little wonder,
therefore, that young Malayans of
today, upon completion of their uni
versity studies abroad, are reluctant
to seek careers in the Malayan gov
ernment—careers which they know
will have but stunted growths.
Malaya Informal
Although she has been for so
many years under the influence of
the convention - bound Britisher,
Malaya remains one of the most
easy-going and informal p'aces in
the world. One can eat with his
hands and cause no amazement; or
he can squat on the sidewalk to have
his lunch (the Malayans call it "tif
fin") and cause no surprise. He can
go into town clad in nothing but a
pair of shorts, and no one will look
at him twice. If he considers even
a pair of shorts too uncomfortable,
he can always wear a sarong, for
Malaya is the home of sarongs.
With her informality, Malaya has
produced a people who are natu
rally friendly and happy-go-lucky,
although they may be inclined to be
somewhat lazy because of the tropi
cal heat. The Malayan people are
also great lovers of sport, and will
take equal delight in a game of soc
cer, a cricket match, a couple of
rounds of boxing, or an afternoon's
swimming. This common love for
sport will undoubtedly help bring
about the fusion of all the different
national groups in that interesting
melting pot called Malaya.

ample of this bad policy can be
found in the great metropolis of
Singapore. There are at present in
Singapore five men and two women
Queen's Scholars in government and
municipal posts. They represent the

creme dc la crcmc of the Malayan
intelligentsia as they have all been
awarded at one time or another the
coveted Queen's Scholarship for
higher studies in Oxford or Cam
bridge. All of them now hold posts
as either assistant this or deputy
that. Not one of them is the head of
a department, although most have
long years of experience behind
them.
In many cases raw and inexperi
enced recruits from the so-called
"home country" have been placed
above them. It is of little wonder,
therefore, that young Malayans of
today, upon completion of their uni
versity studies abroad, are reluctant
to seek careers in the Malayan gov
ernment—careers which they know
will have but stunted growths.
Malaya Informal
Although she has been for so
many years under the influence of
the convention - bound Britisher,
Malaya remains one of the most
easy-going and informal p'aces in
the world. One can eat with his
hands and cause no amazement; or
he can squat on the sidewalk to have
his lunch (the Malayans call it "tif
fin") and cause no surprise. He can
go into town clad in nothing but a
pair of shorts, and no one will look
at him twice. If he considers even
a pair of shorts too uncomfortable,
he can always wear a sarong, for
Malaya is the home of sarongs.
With her informality, Malaya has
produced a people who are natu
rally friendly and happy-go-lucky,
although they may be inclined to be
somewhat lazy because of the tropi
cal heat. The Malayan people are
also great lovers of sport, and will
take equal delight in a game of soc
cer, a cricket match, a couple of
rounds of boxing, or an afternoon's
swimming. This common love for
sport will undoubtedly help bring
about the fusion of all the different
national groups in that interesting
melting pot called Malaya.
Malaya is a country rich in the
production of tin, rubber, and copra.
But above all, she is a country rich
in tolerance. Within her boundaries
are more than six million people of
all nationalities and creeds, living
together in harmony and peace.
In a Malayan town one will find a
Hindu temple, a Jewish synagogue,
a Mohammedan mosque, a Catholic
cathedral, a Protestant church, and
a Buddhist monastery, all flourish
ing close to one 'another. In a Ma
layan schoolroom one will find Jew
ish, French, Chinese, British, Dutch,
Malay, Indian, and American chil
dren working and studying togeth
er.
Although all these national
groups, with different cultural
backgrounds, have in the past lived
together with a minimum of fric
tion, there has been little mixing,
either socially or economically, of
the various groups. Each national
group has been content to keep it
self to itself. Because of this, many,
observers are of the opinion that
Malaya can never be self-govern
ing, since there can never be a com
mon citizenship for all the groups.
Growth of Nationalism
But I disagree. I think that in the
last few years, a spirit of national
ism has grown among the people
living in Malaya. Whereas in the
past they have looked upon them
selves as Chinese, or Malays, or In
dians, they now look upon them
selves as the people of Malaya. Ties
with the countries from which their
forefathers came are being severed,
while their bonds with Malaya, their
home, are being strengthened. In
the near future, a common citizen
ship will not only be possible, but
it will be inevitable.
Every Malayan is looking forward
to the day when Malaya receives
self - government. Great Britain's
exploitation of the people of Malaya
has been the cause of much dissat
isfaction, and her stupid colonial
policies have not particularly en
deared her to them. One of these
policies appears to be the keeping
of Malayans in minor governmental
positions for no other reason than to
keep the power in the hands of men
sent out by Whitehall.
