## 
### 
OAKLAND The Alameda Coun
ty Chapter of the California Service
Station Operators' Association voted
today to ask federal and local in
vestigations of the current gasoline
price war.
At least 42 Standard Station units
had followed the lead of others in
cutting retail prices one to two cents
a gallon to meet, the price of inde
pendent stations. The war started
originally along Mac Arthur Boule
vard. It now has spread to some
stations on the Peninsula and in San
Jose. San Francisco dealers said
they were "holding firm."
