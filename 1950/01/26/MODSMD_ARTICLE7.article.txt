# Excom Votes Election Plan, Scholarships
## 
### 
ASSU Executive Committee last night approved by an 11 to 1
vote the controversial proposal to provide staggered terms of
office for Excom representatives.
The plan is subject to referendum as a proposed amendent to
the ASSU Constitution and will be placed on the spring quarter

election ballot. If approved by the♦
student body it will go into gffect I
immediately.
The plan provides for the election
of elas.'l repi*escr;tativj 112. during I
autumn quarter, to take office at the [
beginning of Winter quarter. Other
representatives will be elected at the j
regular spring quarter elections and j
take office in the fall.
Mike Murphy, chairman of a coin- j
inittce appointed by Excom to in
vestigate the plan, said that, bis com
mittee agreed that such a staggering
of terms of office would provide an
invaluable continuity between ses
sions of Excom.
The plan had been rejected by Ex
com two weeks ago.
Excom voted unanimously to con
tinue the foreign scholarship pro- !
gram, and to provide for the sup
port of at least five foreign students'
study at Stanford during the next
academic year.
Report (liven
Excom's decision came after a re
port on the program's progress to
date and a discussion of its aims.
"The purpose of this report," said
ASSU President Hank Rosin, "is for !
Us to stop a minute, get a revalua
tion of it.(the program), and sec if
it needs revision."
Blaze Hardy, reporting on the
program, stated that during the past I
year the Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram has provided transportation to
and from Stanford, room and board, !
books, tuition, and incidental money !
for seven foreign students.
Of the $11,035 expended on the j
program, $6,135 was drawn from the ■
ASSU budget, the remaining $1,900
being contributed by the campus j
living groups which housed the stu
dents.
"As to what we're getting out of
the program," said Hardy, "the
greatest benefit and pleasure is to
the students living with the for
eign students, from the exchange of
ideas."
Prestige Gained
The long-range objective of the
program, according to Hardy, is to
bring student leaders, both present
and potential, here from foreign
countries, so that they may get a
clear and more accurate view of
American life and instittuions.
"The plan has become known na
tionally and internationally as the
Stanford Foreign Scholarship Plan,"
Hardy said. "The prestige Stanford
has gained is tremendous. Some 30
other universities have adopted the
plan to varying degrees."
In conclusion, Hardy said:
"I suppose the real aim of the
| program is propaganda . . . for
America, for democracy, and for
peace."
Hank Grand in and Richard Kcl
ton also spoke in favor of the For
: eign Scholarship Program, testify
ing that the students here as a rc
! suH of the plan have taken full ad
vantage of the opportunity. They
have written newspaper articles for
United States and foreign papers
anrl made countless addresses.
Friendship Will Help
Grandin pointed out tliat. the stu
! dents who arc selected plan for the
most part to enter social and politi
cal work in their home countries,

; United States will help most.

ASSU Executive Committee last night approved by an 11 to 1
vote the controversial proposal to provide staggered terms of
office for Excom representatives.
The plan is subject to referendum as a proposed amendent to
the ASSU Constitution and will be placed on the spring quarter

election ballot. If approved by the♦
student body it will go into gffect I
immediately.
The plan provides for the election
of elas.'l repi*escr;tativj 112. during I
autumn quarter, to take office at the [
beginning of Winter quarter. Other
representatives will be elected at the j
regular spring quarter elections and j
take office in the fall.
Mike Murphy, chairman of a coin- j
inittce appointed by Excom to in
vestigate the plan, said that, bis com
mittee agreed that such a staggering
of terms of office would provide an
invaluable continuity between ses
sions of Excom.
The plan had been rejected by Ex
com two weeks ago.
Excom voted unanimously to con
tinue the foreign scholarship pro- !
gram, and to provide for the sup
port of at least five foreign students'
study at Stanford during the next
academic year.
Report (liven
Excom's decision came after a re
port on the program's progress to
date and a discussion of its aims.
"The purpose of this report," said
ASSU President Hank Rosin, "is for !
Us to stop a minute, get a revalua
tion of it.(the program), and sec if
it needs revision."
Blaze Hardy, reporting on the
program, stated that during the past I
year the Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram has provided transportation to
and from Stanford, room and board, !
books, tuition, and incidental money !
for seven foreign students.
Of the $11,035 expended on the j
program, $6,135 was drawn from the ■
ASSU budget, the remaining $1,900
being contributed by the campus j
living groups which housed the stu
dents.
"As to what we're getting out of
the program," said Hardy, "the
greatest benefit and pleasure is to
the students living with the for
eign students, from the exchange of
ideas."
Prestige Gained
The long-range objective of the
program, according to Hardy, is to
bring student leaders, both present
and potential, here from foreign
countries, so that they may get a
clear and more accurate view of
American life and instittuions.
"The plan has become known na
tionally and internationally as the
Stanford Foreign Scholarship Plan,"
Hardy said. "The prestige Stanford
has gained is tremendous. Some 30
other universities have adopted the
plan to varying degrees."
In conclusion, Hardy said:
"I suppose the real aim of the
| program is propaganda . . . for
America, for democracy, and for
peace."
Hank Grand in and Richard Kcl
ton also spoke in favor of the For
: eign Scholarship Program, testify
ing that the students here as a rc
! suH of the plan have taken full ad
vantage of the opportunity. They
have written newspaper articles for
United States and foreign papers
anrl made countless addresses.
Friendship Will Help
Grandin pointed out tliat. the stu
! dents who arc selected plan for the
most part to enter social and politi
cal work in their home countries,
! where their friendship for the
; United States will help most.
Fred Ten Eyek recommended that
j Excom incorporate into the consti
| tution of the Social Policies Com
i mitlec the recommendation that at
! least three members of the commit
■ tec be juniors or under. The recom
mendation was approved.
