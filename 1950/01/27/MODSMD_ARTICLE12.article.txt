THESE VOTES DON'T COUNT—The ASSU voting booth at the
Village was reopened today by order of Excom. However, the
ballots cast at the Village today will not be counted, as Excom
rescinded its decree and accepted Wednesday's results as final.
The booth was reopened on the complaint of Villagers that they

were not able to vote Wednesday when the polling place was ;
opened 40 minutes late. Pictured above are (loft to right) two j
