Community Center Theater, was |
sponsored by Ihe local council of the
Knights of Columbus.
The noted labor author d cried ,
present "cut-throat" competition. |
and said that "decentralization of I
our economy is needed to solve the
gigantic social injustices that exist."
Miss Day told of the founder of the
"Green Revolution," Peter Maurin.
Maurin, born a peasant in southern
France, died last May in the United
States after starting "0 communal

li«mi:;cn and I I eo opera) ive farms ;ill
over I,he country.
A student of the anarchist Proud
hoinme, Maurin thought the "modern
tale is the heresy of the day,"and
advocated a return I<> "communal
Chi istianily."
Miss Day stressed the idea that
"Christian solutions to social prob
lems" were needed and the "under
standing and love of the poor" and
personal unselfishness was also ne
cessary.
Miss Day spoke of the "terrible
conditions o f poverty" of '$0,000 un
employed persons in Oakland, citing
many case histories. She felt that too
few people really were sorry for the
poor and destitute, and that too many
thought it "was their own fault."
"Christian charity and social justice
is due these people," she concluded.
