# Successful Internationalism
## 
### 
Excom parsed one motion last night that
seems to prove that Stanford University stu
dents occasionally forget campus trivialities
and do something worthwhile.
The Foreign Scholarship Program will bo
continued another year.
From this program, initiated here on the
Farm, in its two years of operation, many bene
fits have already been reaped.
From a humanitarian point of view, several
Europeans get a chance each year to see the
United States in action. They live with Ameri
can students and in general, lead a normal stu
dent life. The impressions, they carry back
home with them will possibly have some ef
fect not only on their lives but also on those
of then friends.
Secondly, we benefit by these students being
here. Every time we get a chance to meet and
talk with new people, we can learn something.
This is doubly true when these persons come
from a society different from ours, and when
they can tell us of other modes of life.
We become more educated, better people,
if we can gain from each foreign student wo

come in contact with.
Stanford University, too, is adding to its
prestige by this plan. Blaise Hardy, this year's
chairman, says that he receives many letters
from other universities asking about the Stan
ford foreign student program.
Already some 30 other schools have adopted
our plan to varying degrees. We can be espe
cially proud that our school has been a leader
in this field.
As more and more universities begin to
bring over foreign scholars, the effect will, of
course, grow on their home countries.
Lastly, maybe through this small beginning,
we can help in the overall program of combat
ting undemocratic influences in Europe. Since
most of us feel that our way of life is the best,
our best fiope for convincing the rest of the
world is by letting some of them see how it
works.
We hope that Excom will appropriate the
money necessary to continue the Foreign
Scholarship Program next year, and the living
groups will keep up the fine co-operation they
have shown so far.â€” M.K.
