# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Here I was blabbing my typewriter mouth th<- other
'lay that there were no more .straight men left in the
world.
All the time I had forgotten about Stanford's. student
leading Executive Conlinitt.ee, which met Wedne day
night—as usual-—-in the same old Excom room.
I also carelessly overlooked the Managing Editor of
The Daily, who got so excited at

what went on in the room and
consequently piayed it .so straight,
that he wrote an article about the
meeting, mentioned his own name
two times, and then added a by
line.
The story was front page and
.screamed at the public—you the
people— "VILLAGE VOTING
BOOTHS REOPENED." With all
that pageantry showing, I figured
that before I asUed who was i un-

ning for what, I'd better investigate.
if all started, according to The Daily, when a 5-foot,
--inch crusader named Jerry Hill burst onto the scene
with a petition signed by 130 other crusaders demand
ing the reopening of the polls at the Village.
"The Village booth was opened 40 minutes late,"
cried Hill. "Approximately 50 students didn't get to
vote."
"My God," I thought to myself. "What i; student
government at Stanford coming to? It sound as if
that deadly and vicious evil Village Discrimination
is rearing it ugJy head once more."
Naturally, something had to be done. Here was a
petition with 130 signatures. The public had spoken.
But, "NO," said Thurber. "It's unconstitutional."
(That's really a corny line.)
"That's right," said Secretary Ann Mitchell. "Not
enough signatures. The petition is invalid; it has to
include 5 percent (if the student body and three dogs."
(It used to be four, but they recently carted Louie

file Boxer up the river because he knocked down a
little girl to get her candy—such a little thing.) "And
besides, I can't tell whether Hill is a student or a dog."
(All of this isn't directly quoted, hut I was reading
between the lines.)
"Sure, agreed an unidentified professor. "Such ac
tion would never be allowed, even by Broderiok Craw
ford."
Here was crisis. Stark, real, critical crisis. The issue
was 111 doubt. There were two sides.
"Wait-wait," said President Hank, the people's
choice. "By gum, Excom said the polls would be open
at the time stated, and Excom will stick by its guns."
Hoorays and luiz/ah.s rumbled around the room.
ean, Hank, "Attaboy, "You tell 'em, Hankus." '
Suddeny a pin was dropped and Larry HofF jumped
to his feet as if you know very well if. Hoff, one of
the lop 440 men on the Coast, the best Karl Kraushaar
heckle r in the business, and a good guy, spoke: "Even
though the polls were late in opening at the Village,
the students who were unable'to vote could have voted
later at the Village, or on campus if they had come
to class."
"My Cod," someone must have said. "Huffs right.
How could il have boon overlooked. Everybody knows
that people in the Village go to Stanford, too."
"Hooray, Larry." A 10-minute demonstration fol
lowed.
But, up shot flank again "No-no, we promised "
said Hank.
"But, Hank."
"No-no."
"Oh, okay, Hank VILLAGE VOTING BOOTHS
PEOPENED."
Quite a slory, huh. ; By the way, WHO was running
for WHAT, why i.s the Village so excited, and as a mat
ter ot lact, who the hell cares?
Excom seems to be batting its head against a stone
wall and maybe it !l be good for 'em.
At any rate, I finally found me some straight men.
