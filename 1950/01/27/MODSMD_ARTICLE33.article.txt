# HOGAN GOLF TOURNEY
## Demaret Slams His First Hole-in-One, Leads Open 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 2G </P) —
Jimmy Demaret scored his first
competitive hole - in - one, and i
equaled the competitive Phoenix j
Country Club course record today I
to go out in front in the first round j
of the $10,000 Ben Hogan Open Golt
Tournament.
The transplanted Texan, now j
playing out of Ojai, Calif., finished j
the first round with a seven-under
par 04. His ace came on the "lucky" |
Kith when he hit a high No. 3 iron
shot on the 200-yard hole. The ball j
hit 30 yards short and to the left
of the cup. It moved to the right
and dribbled in.
For Jimmy, it was a good start on j
defense of the title he won here last
year in a playoff with Hogan, the
man for whom this week's event is
named.
Sam Snead, the White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va., golfer, who was tops
among the pros for the 1949 tourney
circuit, wasn't far behind Demaret.
The sweet swinger and Wally U!-
rich, Minneapolis pro who recently
quit his club so he could devote all
of his time to the pro tourney swing,
each had 66.
The jovial Demaret, happier than
usual, posed for photographers and
chatted with newsmen after his low |
round.
"You know,"' he said, "the real se- i
cret of that score was those shots !
out of the sand traps.
"Three times I was in a bunker.

and all three times I hit out within
a foot of the pin.
"I haven't had much luck lately,
but it all came today. I think I did
everything pretty well."
About that hole in one:
"I sure waited a long time for
that one."
Long after Demaret finished,
Palmer came to the 18th needing a
birdie to tie. He finished one stroke
behind with 65 when a 12-ioot putt
failed to drop.
Bantam Ben proved he still was
the, master of the situation. He was
four under par at the end of the
first nine.
Hogan objected to a cameraman
on the fourth green, and the tourney
sponsors banned the lensman from
the Hogan threesome. The alterca
tion developed as the cameraman
lined up a picture while Hogan was
readying a putt.
Jack Harden of El Paso, Tex., and
Dale Andreason of Hinsdale, 111.,
each had 67. Clayton Heafner, Char
lotte, N.C., Fred Hawkins of El Paso,
and Ellsworth Vines of Chicago
had (58.
Par took a beating as the warm
sunny weather aided the golfers.
Thirty were under regulation fig
ures for the 6,620-yard course.
Californians among the leaders
included: Eddie Joseph, Fairfax, 34-
35—69; Bill Trombley, San Bernar
dino, 3G-33 —69; and Jim Ferrier,
San Francisco, 35-35—70.
