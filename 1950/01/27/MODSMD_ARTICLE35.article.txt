ing up the Eneina pool with speedy
early - season times in preparation
for its first meet, February 10,
against the San Jose State frosh.

supporting cast, the Farm may soon
be able to boast of its best frosh
team ever. Holiday has turned in
times of 23.9 for the 50, 52.0 for the
100. and 2:17 for the 220, all free

second only to the varsity's Bob

ing the distance in 10.9 seconds.
Peterman, an LA High School in
dividual medley swimmer, is the
best breaststroke candidate, having
swum one length in 12.8 and two of
the same in 28.5. The other stroke
specialist is Don Hanson, from Santa
Ana, who is a backstrokcr; he
swims 29.0 and 1:05 for a 50 and 100
respectively.
The other boys who will help the
team pile up points are A 1 Marsh,
a 54-second 100 freestyle man; Mel
Smith, another freestyler with about
the same times Brewer "Buck"
Thompson and Mel Butler, breast
strokers; and Irwin Johnson, Don
Kauffman, Daan Van Alderwilt, Jim
Madison, Jirn Anderson, Bill Fer
nandez, and A 1 Sortoe, to name a
few.
RudlofT has scheduled 10 meets
already, and has prospects for three
more, so the yearlings will have no
lack of opportunity for showing off
their talents.
