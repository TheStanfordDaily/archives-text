### 
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 26 (/P) â€”
Fiank Leahy has no thought of
coaching anywhere except at Notre
Dame.
"As long as I am able to coach, I
have no desire to be anywhere but
Notre Dame," the head man of the
Fighting Irish told Charlotte's Quar
terback Club last night. "If I can't
coach there, I entertain no thoughts
of coaching elsewhere, in college or
professionally."
