## SPORTS Indians to Open Rugby Season Against SF Olympic Clubbers Here Tomorrow 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Stanford ruggers will make
another attempt to inaugurate the
1950 rugby season tomorrow after
noon when they meet the Olympic-

Club on the local field with starting
time set for 2.
Last Saturday's scheduled Stan
ford-Menlo tussle fizzled when the
Ramblers decided to disband for the
year. Tomorrow's contest is the first
in a nine-game schedule which in
cludes seven league tilts, a game
with UCLA, and three games with
British Columbia. The Cards will
travel north to play the Canadians
on February 16 and 18, while the
third game will be played here on
March 7.
Tomorrow's starting lineup finds
an almost all-veteran group in the
forward line. Darrhl Dcntoni, Cap
tain Mike Spiro, Sarge Littlehale,
Ed Culin.and John Rosecrans are all
three - year lettermen, while Wes
Poulson is now playing his second
year of varsity rugby.
The two newcomers to the scrum
are big Don Tobin and Don Stanley.
Tobin (all 230 pounds of him) han
dles one of the second rank posi
tions, while Stanley is now filling
the lock position vacated by Marty
Feldman.
In the backfield Boyd Benson is
the man to watch. From his wing
position Boyd has ample opportu
nity to display his change-of-pace
running technique. At the other
wing slot is Dick Hughes, who is

playing his third year of varsity
rugby. Hughes is a speed merchant
and a hard man to bring down.
Bill Geary will start at the scrum
half slot. Bill has been hampered
by leg injuries in past years, but

he's in top shape now and ready to
roll. Geary's main function as scrum
half is to feed the bull out to the
other backs after taking it from
the sei*um.
At fullback is Vance ShefTey,
whose ability to kick effectively
whi!e on the dead run makes him
one of the best fullbacks on the
The other three backs are
John Banks, Bill DeYoung, and Pete
Young. DeYoung has broken into
the starting lineup already despite
the fact he had never played the
game before.
Bill McColl, who was late in
turning out, will be used as a back;
his greatest contribution will be in
the matter of booting penalty kicks.
The Olympic Club is loaded with
former Stanford ruggers, including
A 1 Morris, George LeMaitre, Fred
Willey, and Ric Supple. Ex - Cal
men include Wilbur Lenz and Jim
Welch.
The game may be played in the
stadium barring adverse weather
conditions; otherwise it will be on
the rugby field where temporary
bleachers have been set up.
