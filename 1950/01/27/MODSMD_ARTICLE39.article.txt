# Cardinal Baskcteers Get Rest; USC, Sharman Invade Palace
## 
### 
Everett Dean's varsity eagers, ,
juggled around like hot potatoes for j
the past three weeks, went back to
! the grind last night.
But with no games on the week
end slate, the Cards will lapse right
back into inactivity this weekend.
Most of the Indians will spend i
their rest period in the Cow Palace
tonight to watch Bullet Bill Shar
man make his 1950 Bay Area debut
against USF's Dons.
The Cow Palace clash has a lot to j
offer. Besides being a return bout I
to see whether USC's 41-39 win last i
season was a fluke, the battle will j
, be a definite sounding board for j
Sharman's Ail-American hopes. It |
will also be a key to USF's desires j
| for another bid to the Madison ;
| Square Garden Invitational.
I TipofT for the USC-USF gl. ne is
I set for 7:45 p.m., with a nightcap i
( between St. Mary's and Arizona
j scheduled for 9:15 p.m. Student
body cards will be honored for a j
50-cent ducat if there are any Shar- {
| man fans at Stanford who have j
j nothing better to do.
The tilt will also be broadcast on j
Station KYA, with football Tom
| Shaw's brother Jack on the mike.
Stanford went through a slow ses
j sion last night, it being the first
! practice in five days. Coach Dean

: had prescribed a complete rest cure,
I making the Pavilion out of bounds
I until yesterday.
George Yardley turned to volley
| ball, while several others confined
their workouts to a few laps around
the track.
Dean hopes that the complete rest
j will help to have the Indians in top
! shape next Wednesday night for the
Olympic Club clash. Meeting the
I Olympic Club and then the St.
j Mary's Gaels on Friday night, Stan
ford has a good chance of getting
back over the .500 mark. The sea
son record stands now at 7 v/ins and
8 losses.
