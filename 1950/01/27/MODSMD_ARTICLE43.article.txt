# Stevenson Leads Papoose Scorers; Zaninovich Second
## 
### 
Center Bill Stevenson holds the
position of number one scorer on
the Card frosh quintet with 78
points in nine games. Big Bill, who
weighs 215 pounds and is 6 feet 6
inches tall, has started in the pivot
post in every game this season; he
has scored in every game except the
one with Antioch High.
Behind Stevenon is hard-driving
George Zaninovich, who has sent up
66 counters for the Papooses. Third
in scoring is forward Paul Johnson.
He has started in only six games

but his performances include such
events as his 18 - point outburst,
three weeks ago, that led the frosh
to a 47 to 41 win over highly rated
Balboa High.
The freshman win - loss record
now stands at six to three for the
Redmen. This Friday afternoon at
they play Commerce High School
here in the Pavilion. The game with
Huyward High that was set for this
Saturday has been set ahead to ne*t
Wednesday at 3 p.m. here.
