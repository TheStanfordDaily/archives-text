# Five Flyers Exonerated
## 'Bombing' of Cal Before Big Game Has Court Sequel 
### 
The way was clear today for fu
ture "bombings" of (he University
of California at Berkeley during Big
Game.
Four Stanford students, two resi
dents of the area, and a Sunnyvale
CAA inspector were freed from
charges of low and reckless flying
Monday by Judge Oliver Youngs of
Berkeley, The charge originated
from, the pro-Big Game flight over
Berkeley for the purpose of drop
ping "Beat C;d" leaflets.
The four student flyers were A 1
Bletz, Patricia Whitenuin, Erimar
von der Osten, and Robert White
hurst. With them were Lewis Hed
rick, '49. of Palo Alto; Glenn A.
Taylor, a resident of Los Altos; and
CAA Inspector Robert Liddell.
Judge Youngs dismissed the case
after the flyers' attorney, Arnold
Rumwell of Palo Alto, outlined their
actions during the "raid" and ex
plained that no law had been vio
lated. According to state law, planes
must fly 1.000 feet higher than the
highest point in the city.
Judge Youngs said that he was
sure that the group "didn't do any
thing knowingly that was volunta
rily reckless," and told them to fly
safely in the future.
