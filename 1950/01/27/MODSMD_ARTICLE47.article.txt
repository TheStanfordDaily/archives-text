# Communist Terrorists Spread Fear And Violence in Malaya
## Innocent Women and Children Mercilessly Slaughtered As Reds Started to 'Liberate' the Malayan People 
### DAVID WONG 
No-sooner was World War II over than Communist elements
began disrupting the peaceful existence of the people in Malaya.
The Communists gained control of the labor unions and began
fostering strikes and labor disputes as a first step in their cam
paign to "liberate" the people of Malaya. Their aim was to disrupt
i the economy of the country and

bring business to a standstill. By so
j doing, they hoped to arouse further
[ the people's dissatisfaction with the
British government and gain support
I
for themselves.
But much as the people of Ma
laya wanted self - government and
independence, they did not want to
! achieve that goal by any means
J other than an orderly one. Furthcr
j more, they were aware of the dan
| gcrs of Communism. Consequently,
j many of the laborers and union
| members refused to follow the dic
j tates of their Communist leaders.
1047—Reds Banner
In the beginning of 1047, violence
| reached its height and the govern
! ment stepped in. All Communistic
| unions were banned and the Com
j munists were forced underground,
i That marked the beginning of a
j reign of terror throughout Malaya,
j The Communists returned to their
j haunts in the Malayan jungles,
i where they had lived when they
j were fighting against the Japanese.
They took up arms and launched a
| program of bloody violence. At first,
the violence was aimed chiefly at
the rubber and tin industries—in
dustries on which the economy of
Malaya depended. Rubber planta
tion workers and tin miners were
[ massacred. Mining machinery was
wrecked, and houses for smoking
rubber were razed.
I Later, C o m m un is t terrorism
[ spread to every phase of Malayan
life. Hundreds of innocent women
| and children were mercilessly
slaughtered. Political enemies were
assassinated. Trains were derailed,
apd even police stations were at
i tacked.
British Caught Napping
When armed violence broke out,
; the British government was caught
i napping. But a Malayan regiment ■
; was soon formed. The police forces
were increased, and auxiliary police I
| and village guards were organized, i
Gurkha regiments were sent to Ma
j !aya from Nepal, and more rein
; forcements arrived in the form of
the Guards Brigade from England

and seasoned policcmen from Pal
estine.
As added precautions, a national
registration was instituted and
emergency regulations were pro
claimed. The emergency regulations !
provided lor the death penalty for
anyone found in possession of arms j
or ammunition, the detention of any !
person for two years without trial. !
and the banishment of all suspicious I
and undesirable characters from j
Malaya.
Terrorists Losing
For three years the government j
forces have carried out air, land, •
and sea attacks on the Communist
strongholds, and now the tide has i
turned against the terrorist groups, j
But the fighting is by no means j
over, for the Communist terrorists i
are still conservatively estimated at j
10.000 strong.
With the successes of the govern- !
ment forces, the Communists arc '
being pushed farther and farther j
into the Malayan jungles. Their :
strongholds are being destroyed one |
by one. Up until last month. 040 j
terrorists had been killed, 500 had j
been captured, and 311 had surren- j
dered. It seems that in Malaya at
least, the tide of Communism is be
ing stemmed.
