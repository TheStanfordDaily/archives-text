$10 for non-compliance with so
cial regulations. The social
chairmen of the three residences
involved had failed to submit

individual Village groups who have
to abide by them.

gested that each Village residence
should make, a special effort to check
with ASSU before holding social
events in order that ASSU can bet
ter co-ordinate activities.
Il was further advised that social
chairmen, at the time they take of

miliarize themselves with thr few
regulations concerning social affairs.
In this way they can avoid any fu
ture difficulties due to lack of in
formation reaching them.

has in the past constituted a miti
gating circumstance in the case of
Village units, but also in the past it
has been rigidly enforced against
campus living groups and organiza
tions.
