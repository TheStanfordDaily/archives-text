SHORTLY AFTER Lieut. Walter A. Lundin. 32, a naval pilot, took off from the Naval Air Station at
Alameda, his jet plane (above) burst into flames. He said he deliberately maneuvered over shal
low water to save himself and the aircraft which was ditched in four feet of water a quarter of a
mile off shore. Lundin crawled out and waded ashore. Naval authorities said his attempt to save
the plane was futile but "an excellent try." â€”AP Wirephoto
