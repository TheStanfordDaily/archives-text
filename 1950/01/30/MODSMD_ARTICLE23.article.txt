# Red NVD is Symbol of Fear
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
The initials NVD inay mean little
to the average American, hut to many
Russian people, among them Herman
Ermolacv, the symbols represent a
good reason for not wanting to re
turn to their native land.
Herman, one of Stanford's foreign
scholarship students, came into di
rect contact with the work of the
NVD (Russian secret police) during
the German occupation near his na
tive town of Rostov Donn in the sum
mer of 1942.
The Communist government had
abandoned the villnge in haste, leav
ing behind a list containing names
of local NVD spies.
Herman discovered the list and was
surprised to find the name of his
father's friend, a man who had fought
againsl the Communists in the civil
war. He knew that this man was
unsympathetic to the present Soviet
government and had evidently been
forced into the position of a spy.
Herman described as a "reign of
terror" the far-reaching power of

I hi:; secret organization, lie realised
when lie found the spy list., that the
NVD hires for its workers those men
who will not lie suspected as Com
munists and who can consequently
obtain the confidence of "agitators."
He went on to describe the nature
of this organization.
"The NVD maintains a large staff
of spies to prevent and destroy con
spiracies against the government.
Most of their terrorizing is directed
toward the peasants and workers,
who arc dissatisfied with restrictions
imposed by Kolehoss (collective ag
riculture ).
Along with thousands of others
from his village, Herman was sent by
the Germans from Donn to Austria.
Before the German surrender, he
worked on an Austrian farm. After
ward he was placed at a DP camp
under English authority. In I!M7-'IO,
he attended the University of Graz
in Austria as part of a program for
student DP's.
Student DP's at the Austrian camp
worked during the summer to obtain

money for then tuition at. the Uni
versify, which is 100 schillings a se
mester ($10). Their food and cloth
ing was supplied by UNRRA.
Throughout this period, a Soviet
commission was at work to bring
DP's back home.
Most, of them were reluctant to
return. Many of the DP's, including
Herman, "changed" their birthplace
and gave up their Russian citizenship
so that their relatives in the Soviet
Union would not have to suffer.
After difficulty in obtaining a visa,
due to recent immigration laws af
fecting DP's, Herman finally arrived
at Stanford this quarter. He is liv
ing at the Chi Psi House, where he
is learning American customs, and
with even more difficulty, the pro
nunciation of the English language.
He plans to major in Slavic lan
guages at Stanford and then to con
tinue his studies in other American
universities. After only a month in
the United States, Herman has de
cided not to go back to the Soviet
Union.

mester ($10). Their food and cloth
ing was supplied by UNRRA.
Throughout this period, a Soviet
commission was at work to bring
DP's back home.
Most, of them were reluctant to
return. Many of the DP's, including
Herman, "changed" their birthplace
and gave up their Russian citizenship
so that their relatives in the Soviet
Union would not have to suffer.
After difficulty in obtaining a visa,
due to recent immigration laws af
fecting DP's, Herman finally arrived
at Stanford this quarter. He is liv
ing at the Chi Psi House, where he
is learning American customs, and
with even more difficulty, the pro
nunciation of the English language.
He plans to major in Slavic lan
guages at Stanford and then to con
tinue his studies in other American
universities. After only a month in
the United States, Herman has de
cided not to go back to the Soviet
Union.
The initials NVD inay mean little
to the average American, hut to many
Russian people, among them Herman
Ermolacv, the symbols represent a
good reason for not wanting to re
turn to their native land.
Herman, one of Stanford's foreign
scholarship students, came into di
rect contact with the work of the
NVD (Russian secret police) during
the German occupation near his na
tive town of Rostov Donn in the sum
mer of 1942.
The Communist government had
abandoned the villnge in haste, leav
ing behind a list containing names
of local NVD spies.
Herman discovered the list and was
surprised to find the name of his
father's friend, a man who had fought
againsl the Communists in the civil
war. He knew that this man was
unsympathetic to the present Soviet
government and had evidently been
forced into the position of a spy.
Herman described as a "reign of
terror" the far-reaching power of

I hi:; secret organization, lie realised
when lie found the spy list., that the
NVD hires for its workers those men
who will not lie suspected as Com
munists and who can consequently
obtain the confidence of "agitators."
He went on to describe the nature
of this organization.
"The NVD maintains a large staff
of spies to prevent and destroy con
spiracies against the government.
Most of their terrorizing is directed
toward the peasants and workers,
who arc dissatisfied with restrictions
imposed by Kolehoss (collective ag
riculture ).
Along with thousands of others
from his village, Herman was sent by
the Germans from Donn to Austria.
Before the German surrender, he
worked on an Austrian farm. After
ward he was placed at a DP camp
under English authority. In I!M7-'IO,
he attended the University of Graz
in Austria as part of a program for
student DP's.
Student DP's at the Austrian camp
worked during the summer to obtain

money for then tuition at. the Uni
versify, which is 100 schillings a se
mester ($10). Their food and cloth
ing was supplied by UNRRA.
