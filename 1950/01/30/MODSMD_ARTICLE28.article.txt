ular Tuesday Evening Series pro
gram. The concert will begin at 8:15.
Tickets for the performance may still
be purchased for $3 at the office of
the Public Exercises Committee,
Room 55, Temporary Building B, and
at the Peninsula Box Office.
Because of rehearsal difficulties'
Beethoven's Eighth Symphony will
be presented instead of Igor Stra
vinsky's Suite from "Petrouchka."
Beethoven's Eighth Symphony is
one of the shortest and gayest of his
symphonies. It was composed in the
summer of 1812 and included in the
second movement the persistent,
ticking notes of the woodwinds, sug
gesting the beat of the metronome,
which had just been invented by the
mechanician Johann Maelzel.
The orchestra will also play the
Overture to "Euryanthe" by Karl
Maria von Weber, Concerto for Or
chestra by Bela Bartok, and "Span
ish Rhapsody" by Maurice Ravel.
The Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams will be resumed next week
with a talk by Dr. William Irvine,
professor of English, and author of a
recent biography on George Bernard
Shaw.
