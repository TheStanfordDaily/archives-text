# Debaters to Meet San Jose Today
## 
### 
Stanford debaters Forrest Barr
and Merlin Call journey to San Jose
today to debate with a San Jose
State team. They will meet to argue
i the national question, "Resolved,
thai the United States should na
tionalize the basic non-agricultural
| industries."
Winner of th<? freshman debate
I prize for showing the greatest pi om-
I ise in effectiveness and argumenta
tion in public speaking was Gilbert
Harries, instead of Dave Harris as
i erroneously reported in The Daily
last Friday. He and his colleague,
! Walter Menninger, were the win
ners of the freshman debate tourna
ment held last week.
Harries and Menninger defeated
Donald Seydel and Lawrence Fish
; back in Ihr final round of the frosh
debate last Thursday night. The de
bate was "Resolved, that fraternities
at Stanford should be abolished,"
and Harries and Menninger debated
the affirmative. Trophies will be
presented to the victors in the near
future
