# Farm Opened For Shooting
## University Officials May Protest Fish and Game Commission Ruling 
### 
Bullets may fly on Stanford land during deer season this fall if
a ruling by the State Fish and Game Commission opening the Stan
ford Game Refuge becomes effective, despite the protests of Uni
versity officials and residents of the area.
The commission opened the refuge following a hearing in Los

•Angeles Friday. Four other refuges,
up for hearing, remained closed be
cause of public protest.
University officials indicated that
they were in complete disagreement
with the ruling, and would take
steps to get a reversal. Frederick O.
Glover, Stanford director of informa
tion, said that the Administration
would first see how the ruling reads,
and then talk it over with the com
mission to see if it can be changed.
Public Protest
Fifty persons appeared at a com
mission hearing in Palo Alto January
16 to protest the opening of the ref
uge. Letters and petitions from tha
University, neighboring residents,
and wildlife students backed up then
protest.
Two hunters appearing at the ses
sion said it would do little good to
open the refuge, since there are
hardly any deer in the area to shoot
at. The sportsmen showed no desire
to have the land opened to hunters.
The Los Angeles decision was a
victory for Ted Halloday, Santa
Clara game warden, who requested
that the state abandon the refuge be
cause of the difficulty of patrolling
the area.
Endangers Residents
The University countered that
opening the land to hunting wouM
endanger the lives of students on
field trips, wild life observers, and
numerous residents in the area. The
ruling came as a surprise to the Ad
ministration, which viewed the pub
lic protest as sufficient reason to keep
the refuge closed.
Two forms of action arc open to
University officials if future talk?,
with the Fish and Game Commission
fail. The University can ask San
Mateo and Santa Clara county boards
of supervisors to create county game
refuges on the land.
The University Board of Trustee ;
may also post the area to prohibit
trespassing by hunters. The latter
action is considered ineffective, how
ever, since trespassing signs posted
by private parties in the area have
been torn down as fast as they were
put up.
Created in 1927
The Stanford Game Refuge w;js
created by the 1927 state legislature
with the approval of Governor C. C
Young, according to Miss Margaret
Storey, assistant curator of zoological
collections at the Stanford Natural
History Museum. Both the 1923 and
1925 legislatures passed tills closing
the land, but the governor failed to
sign them on both occasions.
The Board of Trustees first de
cided to create a "game preserve' 1
here in 1916.
Action by the state legislature was
not needed to close the refuge, since
all control of game refuges was
placed in the hands of the Fish and

here in 1916.
Action by the state legislature was

Bullets may fly on Stanford land during deer season this fall if
a ruling by the State Fish and Game Commission opening the Stan
ford Game Refuge becomes effective, despite the protests of Uni
versity officials and residents of the area.
The commission opened the refuge following a hearing in Los

•Angeles Friday. Four other refuges,
up for hearing, remained closed be
cause of public protest.
University officials indicated that
they were in complete disagreement
with the ruling, and would take
steps to get a reversal. Frederick O.
Glover, Stanford director of informa
tion, said that the Administration
would first see how the ruling reads,
and then talk it over with the com
mission to see if it can be changed.
Public Protest
Fifty persons appeared at a com
mission hearing in Palo Alto January
16 to protest the opening of the ref
uge. Letters and petitions from tha
University, neighboring residents,
and wildlife students backed up then
protest.
Two hunters appearing at the ses
sion said it would do little good to
open the refuge, since there are
hardly any deer in the area to shoot
at. The sportsmen showed no desire
to have the land opened to hunters.
The Los Angeles decision was a
victory for Ted Halloday, Santa
Clara game warden, who requested
that the state abandon the refuge be
cause of the difficulty of patrolling
the area.
Endangers Residents
The University countered that
opening the land to hunting wouM
endanger the lives of students on
field trips, wild life observers, and
numerous residents in the area. The
ruling came as a surprise to the Ad
ministration, which viewed the pub
lic protest as sufficient reason to keep
the refuge closed.
Two forms of action arc open to
University officials if future talk?,
with the Fish and Game Commission
fail. The University can ask San
Mateo and Santa Clara county boards
of supervisors to create county game
refuges on the land.
The University Board of Trustee ;
may also post the area to prohibit
trespassing by hunters. The latter
action is considered ineffective, how
ever, since trespassing signs posted
by private parties in the area have
been torn down as fast as they were
put up.
Created in 1927
The Stanford Game Refuge w;js
created by the 1927 state legislature
with the approval of Governor C. C
Young, according to Miss Margaret
Storey, assistant curator of zoological
collections at the Stanford Natural
History Museum. Both the 1923 and
1925 legislatures passed tills closing
the land, but the governor failed to
sign them on both occasions.
