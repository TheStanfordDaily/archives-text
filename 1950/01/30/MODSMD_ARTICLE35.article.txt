# Election Aftermath
## 
### 
Excom tried its darndest to be fair to Village
voters last Wednesday night. In doing so, it
made a mistake.
That mistake was the decision to reopen the
polls at the Village for 45 minutes during the
lunch hour on Thursday to allow the votes of
an estimated 50 Village residents who, it is
claimed, had been disenfranchised by a late
opening the day before.
At the time of the decision the ballots cast on
Wednesday had already been counted, and the
Jesuits of the election were fairly well known
around the campus.
Excom was naive to assume that the Village
would not be the scene of considerable politi
cal activity on Thursday morning as first one
candidate and then another tried to push him
i:elf over the top with a last-minute effort.
Electioneering under such conditions will in
variably result in a distortion of the outcome ot
an election. Thursday's experience stands as
proof of this point.
There is nothing in the ASSU Constitution or
By-Laws which requires that a voting booth be
opened at the Village. The location of polling
places is up to the discretion of the Election
Board. One is traditionally opened at the Vil
lage during certain hours as a convenience for
the 1 ,GOO students who live there.
The Executive Committee erred by putting
tha whole election in jeopardy in order to ful-

Jill a promise that a voting booth would be open
at the Village for a certain length of time.
It is not our purpose to condemn Excom for
this error in judgment. Everybody makes mis
takes. Excom has corrected this error by throw
ing out the votes cast at the Village Thursday
noon and declaring Wednesday's results final.
Rather, it disturbs us that it took such a con
troversy as this to get the student body as a
whole interested in the election.
Les3 than 1,000 students, or approximately 13
percent of the student body, bothered to vote
in Wednesday',3 election. A seat on one of the
Councils for Student Control is one of the most
important offices that a student can hold, yet
few even bothered to find out who was running.
But on Thursday morning when it was an
nounced that Excom had refused to validate the
election, these people awoke with a start. Stu
dents started to talk, and students started to cir
culate petitions.
One petition, calling for Excom approval of
Wednesday's results, was submitted with 534
signatures. We daresay that if the records were
checked it would be found that not more than
one signer out of four had bothered to vote in
the election that he was defending by petition.
But action such as this can only be described
as typical. "Sleep while it's happening, but hol
ler when it's over." It seems to be the American
Way.

nounced that Excom had refused to validate the
election, these people awoke with a start. Stu
dents started to talk, and students started to cir
culate petitions.
One petition, calling for Excom approval of
Wednesday's results, was submitted with 534
signatures. We daresay that if the records were
checked it would be found that not more than
one signer out of four had bothered to vote in
the election that he was defending by petition.
But action such as this can only be described
as typical. "Sleep while it's happening, but hol
ler when it's over." It seems to be the American
Way.
Excom tried its darndest to be fair to Village
voters last Wednesday night. In doing so, it
made a mistake.
That mistake was the decision to reopen the
polls at the Village for 45 minutes during the
lunch hour on Thursday to allow the votes of
an estimated 50 Village residents who, it is
claimed, had been disenfranchised by a late
opening the day before.
At the time of the decision the ballots cast on
Wednesday had already been counted, and the
Jesuits of the election were fairly well known
around the campus.
Excom was naive to assume that the Village
would not be the scene of considerable politi
cal activity on Thursday morning as first one
candidate and then another tried to push him
i:elf over the top with a last-minute effort.
Electioneering under such conditions will in
variably result in a distortion of the outcome ot
an election. Thursday's experience stands as
proof of this point.
There is nothing in the ASSU Constitution or
By-Laws which requires that a voting booth be
opened at the Village. The location of polling
places is up to the discretion of the Election
Board. One is traditionally opened at the Vil
lage during certain hours as a convenience for
the 1 ,GOO students who live there.
The Executive Committee erred by putting
tha whole election in jeopardy in order to ful-

Jill a promise that a voting booth would be open
at the Village for a certain length of time.
It is not our purpose to condemn Excom for
this error in judgment. Everybody makes mis
takes. Excom has corrected this error by throw
ing out the votes cast at the Village Thursday
noon and declaring Wednesday's results final.
Rather, it disturbs us that it took such a con
troversy as this to get the student body as a
whole interested in the election.
Les3 than 1,000 students, or approximately 13
percent of the student body, bothered to vote
in Wednesday',3 election. A seat on one of the
Councils for Student Control is one of the most
important offices that a student can hold, yet
few even bothered to find out who was running.
