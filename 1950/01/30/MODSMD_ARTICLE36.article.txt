# It's One World

The Ivory Tower serves its purpose; maybe
here at Stanford we get a better education be
cause we aren't in the midst of a city.
Maybe college, however, should include a
little more than classes balanced with a certain
number of trivial student activities. The bas
ketball games next weekend and what Excom's
doing are fine, but there is something more to
life.
Some of us vote now, and most of us will
soon. All of us will leave college some day and
either go out to work or raise families, or do
both. In these days when national and inter
national activities reach down into our lives
every day, we should have a vital interest in
all that goes on in the world.
When we register for the draft, pay income
taxes, or collect veterans' bonuses, that affects
us directly. We can see how that type of ac
tivity is important.
But how about world government? Wouldn't
that change our daily lives, too? Important
people are talking about that type of a revolu
tionary change now, and maybe we ought to
know what they're saying.
Last week the University was lucky enough
to get Mr. Agar here to present his plan. To
night Stanley Weigel, a former ASSU president
and leader in the United World Federalists, will
speak on his ideas of world government.
Maybe we should try to get out of house
meetings early or forget Dinah's for an evening
to hear what these people are saying and doing.

Maybe we could be better citizens if we were
exposed to some of the thinking that is going
on today.—M.K.
