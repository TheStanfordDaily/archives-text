### BILL DAILEY 
CAMPUS CANDID ....
The fraternity men sprawled (on their "back
porches") on their front porches at noontime, watch
ing and whistling at the girLs moving up the Row . . .
the Library-bound jokesters who gladly kill a little
time riding the elevator from the first floor to the sec-

ond floor of Cubberley Library, a
tribute to the modern student,
who will do anything to post
pone the moment when he must
settle down to study . . . the per
suasive remarks of the Roble
hasher designed to discourage the
} j irls from ordering "seaonds" on
Friday night so he can be on time
for his 7:15 date . . . the ceaseless
10 a.m. babble iu front of The Cel
lar as a group of law students ar-

gue a case from behind a cuppacoffee and 15 pounds
of textbooks.
The alarming thought of a possible fiat tire as you
: peed along the Bayshore on a Saturday night in a
match race with a thing called a "two-thirty." . . .
the at-peace-with-the-world expression on the face
of a students who has fallen asleep In the Libe. . . .
that pre-midterm traffic jam in the Music Listening
Room, as 50 students wait for one of the few sets of
112 ai phones; each to see if that theme in his head is the
second or third movement of Beethoven's Fifth. . . .
the awkward swing of a student in beginning golf class,

as he sends a divot, flying 10 feet further than the golf
ball. . . . The Sunday Night Movies, that old reliable
steam valve where the boys and girls who were so-so
sophisticated the night before at the Mark Hopkins,
can cut loose for two hours.
The familial- ukelele chords of "Ain't She Sweet?"—
the book says you can learn 'em in five minutes, but
who does? -drifting through the halls of Branner or
floating from a fraternity house window. . . . the
never-scheduled, but never-missed meetings of the
most popular club on the campus, the Thank-Clod-lt's-
Friday Club at Rossott's. . . . The Encina lobby of
late January, a silent successor to the hectic Encina
lobby of the early January rush season. . . . The long
perfected ait of reading The Daily or the Chappie lie
hind a notebook, while your professor drones on about
the mores of society. . . . The only two-lane wa.«;h
bourd in the State of California, located in front of
the Chemistry building, and laughingly referred to as
Lomita Drive. . . . The inevitable groan of disgust
when you see the proofs of your Quad pictures . . .
and you did so want them to be good this year, didn't
you? . . . The pained expression of all Rally Com
members as they look anxiously at their well planned
card stunts, only to see ii day-dreaming looter turn
up a green card in the middle of their field of solid
white.
This is it . . . the Cumpus Candid . . . the eternal
picture thai we look at day after day, but nevi r «ee,
