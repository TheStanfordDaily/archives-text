R.i m iN—The Russians got gen
erous, then tough with Berlin-bound
truck traffic at Hclmstcdt on the
Autobahn today.
For nearly 20 hours they let
trucks through the British border
point at a rate of about 10 an hour—
a 100 per cent speedup compared
with some periods of the eight-day
slow-down, but still only about a
third of normal.
Then tonight, when the waiting
line of trucks had been reduced
from about 225 to 35, they suddenly
reimposed the old five -an - hour
schedule. Guards resumed their
meticulous checking of cargoes and
shipping papers.
