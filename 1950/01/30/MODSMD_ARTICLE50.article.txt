## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Stanford Ruggers built up an early lead and then coasted to
a 16 to 11 victory over the Olympic Club last Saturday on a mud
soaked and slippery field. The Cards dominated play until the
final stages of the contest, when the Clubmen pushed across for
a score against the Indian reserves.
The highlight of the game came midway through the second

half when Bill McColl broke loose
and went 75 yards to score. Big Bill
steam-rollered past the Clubmen's
J forwards and then literally ran over
j the last two men who tried to stop
j him.
I The Cards drew first blood in the
early minutes of play when they
| pushed the ball over after a scrum
had been called on the Olympic Club
| 5-yard line. John Rosekrans pounced
ton the ball for the try, and Ed Culin
I converted to give the Indians a 5 to
0 bulge.
