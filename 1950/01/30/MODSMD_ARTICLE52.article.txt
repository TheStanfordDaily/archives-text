# Cal Clips USF In Upset Win; Trojans Falter
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Nibs Price's California Golden i
Bears, kicked around by every team j
in the Southern Division, neverthe- !
less did what none of their league
opponents could do — they stunned
USF Saturday night in the Cow
Palace, s(j to 44.
Up to that time USF's National
Tourney champs of '49 had made a
shambles of Southern Division com
petition. They had started out by
trouncing UCLA, the defending
kings of the division, in a 53-40
walkaway.
Then, in a supposed grudge bat- j
tie between Stanford's Indians and
themselves, they rolled to an easy j
54-39 win.
Dons Ruin Shannan
Their peak was reached when
they ruined Sharman and the USC j
Trojans, 55-41, Friday night in a
Cow Palace crucial.
None of the games had been even
close. The Dons had won going
away. It seemed as if they could call
their own score in going after a
clean sweep against the hapless
Bears.
But. California turned in the up
set of the year. With Don Henrick
sen pumping the net for 21, and
holding Don Lofgran to 8, the Bears
roared to an early lead and kept go
ing strong.
The night before against Troy,
Lofgran had turned in an inspired
performance, cracking the Cow Pal
ace 21 Club with 22 points, as well
as shadowing Sharman, who only
managed 10.
Weekend of Upsets
It turned out to be a weekend of
wild upsets and strange happenings.
Bullseye Bill Sharman put together
the worst two-night stand of his ca
reer. He tossed up only 2 points in
the second half against USF, fouled
out of the contest, and was outshone
by Lofgran. Saturday night against
St. Mary's, Bullseye Bill hit an all
time low with only 0 points for the
game.
Consequently, USC had a hard
time even with St. Mary's, a team
which had been batted around with
ease for eight straight Cow Palace
losses. Number nine was served up
when USC finally gassed it up to
40-41.
Sharman, who had come north
hoping to buy a little Luisetti
stock, went home last night after
going into bankruptcy.
Attendance Record
USF made USC look silly. Be
fore the largest Cow Palace crowd >
ever to watch a cage clash, 12,579,
the Dons played keep away for the 1
last nine minutes, and the Trojans
kept fouling until four starters had
gone out and they had piled up a I
total of 36 personals.
But USF's success story was :
dashed to bits just one night later
by the Bears. It was turnabout from
last season when Stanford, USC. and
UCLA beat the Dons, but Cal lost.
This time out Cal turned the i
trick, but Stanford. USC, and UCLA '
were t;iken for the ride.
Ducks Drop Huskies
Up north, upsets were also in
vogue. Pace-setting Washington sot
roughed up twice in a row by Ore- I
gon, and Washington State moved i
into the lead with a Saturday night |
lacing of Idaho, 03 to 40.
UCLA started action again by !
breezing past Santa Barbara and j
Cal Poly.
Loyola handed Arizona its second
defeat in 10 starts down in Los An
geles with a 61-54 spanking Satur
day night. Arizona had won its 14th
the night before against St. Mary's,
67-57.
Indians Idle
Meanwhile, as everybody was fir
ing away up and down the coast,
Stanford was resting easily with its
first weekend off since the season
started.
The Cards commence activity
again Wednesday night in the Pa
vilion against the Olympic Club j
quintet, composed mainly of Stan- j
ford alums.

opponents could do — they stunned
USF Saturday night in the Cow
Palace, s(j to 44.
Up to that time USF's National
Tourney champs of '49 had made a
shambles of Southern Division com
petition. They had started out by
trouncing UCLA, the defending
kings of the division, in a 53-40
walkaway.
Then, in a supposed grudge bat- j
tie between Stanford's Indians and
themselves, they rolled to an easy j
54-39 win.
Dons Ruin Shannan
Their peak was reached when
they ruined Sharman and the USC j
Trojans, 55-41, Friday night in a
Cow Palace crucial.
None of the games had been even
close. The Dons had won going
away. It seemed as if they could call
their own score in going after a
clean sweep against the hapless
Bears.
But. California turned in the up
set of the year. With Don Henrick
sen pumping the net for 21, and
holding Don Lofgran to 8, the Bears
roared to an early lead and kept go
ing strong.
The night before against Troy,
Lofgran had turned in an inspired
performance, cracking the Cow Pal
ace 21 Club with 22 points, as well
as shadowing Sharman, who only
managed 10.
Weekend of Upsets
It turned out to be a weekend of
wild upsets and strange happenings.
Bullseye Bill Sharman put together
the worst two-night stand of his ca
reer. He tossed up only 2 points in
the second half against USF, fouled
out of the contest, and was outshone
by Lofgran. Saturday night against
St. Mary's, Bullseye Bill hit an all
time low with only 0 points for the
game.
Consequently, USC had a hard
time even with St. Mary's, a team
which had been batted around with
ease for eight straight Cow Palace
losses. Number nine was served up
when USC finally gassed it up to
40-41.
Sharman, who had come north
hoping to buy a little Luisetti
stock, went home last night after
going into bankruptcy.
Attendance Record
USF made USC look silly. Be
fore the largest Cow Palace crowd >
ever to watch a cage clash, 12,579,
the Dons played keep away for the 1
last nine minutes, and the Trojans
kept fouling until four starters had
gone out and they had piled up a I
total of 36 personals.
But USF's success story was :
dashed to bits just one night later
by the Bears. It was turnabout from
last season when Stanford, USC. and
UCLA beat the Dons, but Cal lost.
This time out Cal turned the i
trick, but Stanford. USC, and UCLA '
were t;iken for the ride.
Ducks Drop Huskies
Up north, upsets were also in
vogue. Pace-setting Washington sot
roughed up twice in a row by Ore- I
gon, and Washington State moved i
into the lead with a Saturday night |
lacing of Idaho, 03 to 40.
UCLA started action again by !
breezing past Santa Barbara and j
Cal Poly.
Loyola handed Arizona its second
defeat in 10 starts down in Los An
geles with a 61-54 spanking Satur
day night. Arizona had won its 14th
the night before against St. Mary's,
67-57.

first weekend off since the season
