SEATTLE. Jan. 29 (JP) â€” Forrest
Evashevski. assistant at Michigan
State College, has been named head
footbull coach at Washington State
College, the Associated Press learned
tonight from an unimpeachable
source.
Evashevski was given a five-year
contract at an annual salary in ex
cess of $10,000.
He will succeed Phil Sarboe, the
WSC alumnus who resigned at the
close of last season. Evashevski is a
University of Michigan graduate and
won fame in college as blocking back
and field general in the immediate
pre-war era. He was a teammate of
Tommy Harmon, one oi Michigan's
all-time grid greats.
The hiring of Evashevski means a
return of single wing football to
Washington State, a system featured
by Sarboe's predecessor, Orin E.
(Babe) Hollingbery.
Only last fall, another Michigan
State assistant, Kip Taylor, took over
at Oregon State and with the Michi
gan single wing gave his team the
unofficial Northwest championship.
