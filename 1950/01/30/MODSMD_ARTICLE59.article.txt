# Increase in Alumni Rates Postponed
## 
### 
The Alumni Association Execu
tive Board has postponed consider
ation of an increase in the price of
life memberships in the Association :
until the March meeting in Los An
geles.
The matter was brought up at a
meeting of the board held Sunday,
along with a discussion of football
ticket distribution.
Rising costs of operation, espe
cially tor the Alumni Review, have
made consideration of a price raise
necessary. Present regular alumni j
rate is $75, and the special student !
installment rate is $60. Installments !
may be paid twice each year until i
graduation.
The Board also made recommen
dations to the Stanford Athletic
Council concerning football ticket j
distribution.
