### JOANN COHN 
Each year about $19,000 in
grants -in - aid are paid out to
Stanford students, and the diffi
cult task of allocating these funds
is that of the Committee for Stu
dent Aid.
Before the committee was formed,
grants-in-aid were handled by Dean
Lawrence Kimpton and Sheldon I?.
Beatty, former Men's Counselor. This
resulted in a haphazard choosing of
recipients of the grants, so the Schol
arship Committee formed a subcom
mitteee for student aid.
Up to the present time, the Student
Aid Committee's recommendations
for assistance have never been over
ruled by the Scholarship Committee.
An applicant is interviewed by the
committee, and if his financial need
is great enough, the committee will
recommend assistance.
Grants are given to students who

| find themselves in unusual or unex- ,
pocted circumstances, or who need I
1 loans when they arc almost through
school. The applicant cannot be mi
j nus. No other scholarship condition
; is required.
Tuition loans are integrated
through this committee. The loan—
which the committee does not expect
to be paid back —is a cash grant. The
maximum grant for each person is
approximately $(>OO a year; each
quarter it averages about $100 per
person.
There are several funds from
which the Committee for Student j
Aid draws. The Merill Fund pro
vides assistance to veterans who j
have had combat time. Also, because
of the tuition raise, the ASSU has a
fund for $100 grants. Other Univer
sity funds are also available to the
committee.
The committee usually consists of

six members: two faculty members,,
one graduate member, and three un
dergraduate members. At present,
the committee members arc George,
Barahal, Director of the Counseling
and Testing Center, and Veterans'
Co-ordinator; William Bark, associ
ate professor of history; and Dave
Atcheson, Ted Buttncr, and Dorothy
Lockwood. ,
