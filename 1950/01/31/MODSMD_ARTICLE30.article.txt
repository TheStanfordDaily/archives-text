# SF Symphony Plays Tonight
## Beethoven's Eighth, von Weber's 'Euryanthe' Overture on Program 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra will open its concert
in Memorial Hall tonight with the Overture to "Euyranthe" by Karl
Maria von Weber. The program, which replaces the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, will begin at 8:15.
Tickets for $3 orchestra seats are still available and may be pur-

►chased at the Public Exercises Com -
mittee Office, room 55, temporary
building B, and at the Peninsula Box
Office.
Pierre Monteux will conduct the
orchestra in Beethoven's Eighth
Symphony as the major work of the
evening. The eighth is one of the
shortest and gayest of Beethoven's
symphonies, and the only one that
contains no slow movement.
Eighth Composed in 1812
Beethoven composed the sym
phony during the summer of 1812,
the greater part of it at Linz. Shortly
before going to Linz, Beethoven had
been impressed by the famous mech
anician, Johann Maelzel, and his re
cent invention, the metronome. The
beat of the metronome is suggested
in the second movement of the sym
phony by the persistent, ticking notes
of the woodwinds.
The Overture to "Euryanthe" was
written in 1823 as an effort to repeat,
the triumph Weber had won in Vi
enna with his "Freischutz" of 1821.
The opera "Euryanthe" was a failure,
but the overture has survived.
Bartok, Ravel Works Included
The Program will also include
Concerto for Orchestra by Bela Bar
tok and Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody.
Bartok's Concerto was composed
for the Koussevitzy Music Founda
tion in 1943. It is dedicated to the
memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.
"Spanish Rhapsody," composed in
1907, is one of Ravel's most persua
sive tributes to the land below the
Pyrenees. Of all French composers,
Ravel was most completely devoted
to the Spanish idiom. "Malaguena"
and "Habanera" are heard in the
piece.
Tonight's concert will be the sec
ond in a series of three by the San
Francisco Symphony for the 1949-50
school year.
The Tuesday Evening Series pro •
grams will be resumed next week
with a talk by Dr. William Irvine,
professor of English and author of a
recent biography of George Bernard
Shaw.

The Overture to "Euryanthe" was
written in 1823 as an effort to repeat,
the triumph Weber had won in Vi
enna with his "Freischutz" of 1821.
The opera "Euryanthe" was a failure,
but the overture has survived.
Bartok, Ravel Works Included
The Program will also include
Concerto for Orchestra by Bela Bar
tok and Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody.
Bartok's Concerto was composed
for the Koussevitzy Music Founda
tion in 1943. It is dedicated to the
memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.
"Spanish Rhapsody," composed in
1907, is one of Ravel's most persua
sive tributes to the land below the
Pyrenees. Of all French composers,
Ravel was most completely devoted
to the Spanish idiom. "Malaguena"
and "Habanera" are heard in the
piece.
Tonight's concert will be the sec
ond in a series of three by the San
Francisco Symphony for the 1949-50
school year.
The Tuesday Evening Series pro •
grams will be resumed next week
with a talk by Dr. William Irvine,
professor of English and author of a
recent biography of George Bernard
Shaw.
