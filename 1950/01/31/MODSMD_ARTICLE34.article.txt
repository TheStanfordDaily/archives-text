# Graduate Exam Results
## 
### 
Stanford juniors received a lettftf last week
telling them their individual scores on the
Graduate Record examination taken last fall.
They also received a letter from Gary Mills,
technical assistant to the Lower Division Com
mittee who is evaluating the results of the test,
and several statistical tables intended to enable
the student to see how he stood compared to
other Stanford students and to students in other
colleges.
The tables weie confusing even to those who
had taken statistics, and many have asked us
what they meant.
Speaking broadly, we can say that in all sec
lions of the examination —general mathematics,
physical science, biological science, social
studies, literature, arts, effectiveness of expres
sion, and vocabulary— approximately 75 per
cent of Stanford juniors scored higher than the
national average.
On the General Education Index, which is a
weighted average of the scores on these sub
jects, Stanford ranked with the highest of the
schools used in setting up the normative group.
The Stanford median score was about 560,

compared to a national median score of about
480.
Unfortunately, specific information is not
available on scores at other top schools in the
United States. Mills has written to other uni
versities, but has not yet received answers. He
says this information must be kept confidential
when it is available.
Information of this type could prove inter
esting, since most ol the colleges included in
the national average have lower entrance stand
ards and scholastic requiiements than Stanford.
The test probably has served at least two pur
poses. It should be of some benefit to the indi
vidual student in evaluating his own standing.
If he desires, he may use the results as a recom
mendation for entrance to another school.
Some graduate schools require all applicants
to take the test. If taken individually, it would
cost the student about $10.
But second, and more important, the test pro
vides concrete information for the Lower Divi
sion Committee to use in making decisions re
garding lower division requirements and Stan
ford's general educational program.- M.H.
