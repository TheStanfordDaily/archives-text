## Mr. Farris' Letter 
### 
't\j the Editor:
in regard to the letter published in Thursday's
Daily, I hope that Mr. Farris and the rest ol' his so
called "{.ractical thinkers" have stopped laughing long
enough to listen to what Stanley Weige! had to say
last night. At a time when the United States is consid
ering building a hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more
powerful than the present atomic bomb, is anything
: hort of effective world government practical?
As chairman of the United World Federalists in this
state, this "impractical idealist" (as I suppose Stan
ford's self-styled practical realists would call him)
iias done more than anyone else in California to make
world government an obtainable goal. Under Weigel's
leadership in this state federalists were able to bring
about the first definite legislative step toward world
government.
Lust spring the California Legislature passed a
Resolution asking Congress to call a Constitutional
Convention for the sole purpose of drafting an amend
ment to our Constitution to enable and facilitate
United States participation in a world government.
Five other states have already followed California's
lead, and when a total of 36 states have acted
Congress will be forced to call such a convention.
Al::o, under Weigel's leadership, support for world
government has become so great in this state that a
majority of California's Representatives in the House
have joined with over 100 other congressmen to spon
sor the world federation resolution now pending in
Washington
