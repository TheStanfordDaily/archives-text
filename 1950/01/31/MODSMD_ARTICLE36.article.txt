To the Editor:
From his letter in The Daily of January 20, Mr.
Thomas E. Farris appears to have been misinformed on
a subject of importance. After making the obvious
point that a world government would have to cover
the world (including Russia) he implies that Clarence
Streit and Herbert Agur are impractical Utopians who
advocate the setting up of such a world government.
II Mr. Farris had taken advantage of the opportunities
recently afforded him by the University to hear these
i«.vo outstanding thinkers, he would realizp that they
make no such proposals.
On the contrary, they recognize that the rift be
tween the Communist empire and the rest of the world
is the key fact today, and they advocate a union only
of those countries which are prepared by actual expe
i ience to operate a democratic system with some pros
pect of success.
