To the Editor:
The letter in The Daily last Thursday was a very
food .statement of nothing. The writer of that letter
considers world government a concept that is only
of interest to Utopians. It is, that writer says, to lie
rejected because Pravda has rejected it. I wonder if
that writer would also reject all of the science, music,
literature, and philosophy that Pravda has rejected.
All of the world government "Utopians" recognize
Russia as a major problem in realizing their goal. But
vn.til the proposal has been made to Russia, how can
anyone know it will be rejected? The Kremlin has
reversed its stand many times in the past.
In answer to the writer's concern about the lack of
practical thinkers: it is obvious that he would not
tecognize a practical thinker. Practical and idealistic
thinking are not mutually exclusive, but are insep
arable aspect:, of all sound thinking.
