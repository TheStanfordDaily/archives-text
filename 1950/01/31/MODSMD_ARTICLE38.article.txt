To the Editor:
To call the work of the United World Federalists
unpractical, is to ignore the facts. Let's look at the
itcord of the significant steps toward world govern
ment taken in 1949:
I. 105 members of the House and 22 senators jointly
ponsored u resolution declaring thai a fundamental

objective of U.S. foreign policy should be to support
and strengthen the U.N. and "to seek its development
into a world federation open to all nations."
'1. 15 state legislatures adopted W.G. resolutions, six
of which were binding steps toward W.C.
General Romulo, most outspoken advocate of
W.G. at Lake Success, was elected president of the
U.N. Assembly.
4. In May, Ambassador Warren Austin severely
criticized the W.G. movement in "Harper's." In Au
gust, after a talk with Cord Meyer Jr. of U.W.F., Aus
tin stated publicly, "It must be clear that, in the long
run, any policy that is good for the U.N. will represent
realistic progress toward W.G., and that all intelligent
work for W.G. ought to be work for the U.N.
5. The following were among the national organiza
tions added to the list endorsing W.G.: AmVets, Co
operative League, Farmer's Union, Kiwanis Interna
tional, National Grange, Protestant. Episcopal Church,
United Automobile Workers, Young Republican Na
tional Federation.
G. Delegates from 2(i nations attended the conven
tion of the World Movement for World Federal Gov
ernment held in Stockholm in September.
These are concrete steps toward our goal. Our se
rious opposition has come from the hysterical or the
uninformed. If you are one of the latter, Mr. Weigel's
talk las! night should have proved worthwhile.
