# Eating Club Plight

### 
To the Editor:
An important decision is soon to be made by the
Board of Trustees. This decision concerns the plight of
Stanford's Eating Clubs. At present, these groups are
holding their mealtime get-togethers in Enema Com
mons, crowding the regular diners and cramping fa
cilities in general.
The situation for the clubs is unfortunate; bearing
the load of restricted potentials in membership, they
are struggling in a quagmire of indifference. Because
they have neither independent nor ample facilities, the
Eating Clubs can offer little appealing distinctiveness,
and this to only a few would-be pledges.
These difficulties are not inherent faults in the
Eating Club idea; the unfortunate circumstance lies
in the fact that they are quite generally interpreted as
such.
An affirmative decision by the Board can do away
with both these difficulties—cramped and uninspiring
conditions—enabling the Eating Clubs to emerge from
the quagmire and tread on solid ground.
The clubs have many things to offer. The most im
portant of these is the satisfaction of belonging, a func
tion shared by the fraternities.
To the Eating Clubs, however, are attached several
exclusive advantages. Some of these advantages, re
ferring to the status of belonging, are small expense,
little obligation of time, and congeniality with infor
mality. The clubs provide further a long period in
which to become acquainted with, and select, the
group of future close association.
With private facilities combined in a single building,
the Eating Clubs will be able to hold social functions
of all-campus proportions. These functions will not
only speak well for the clubs but also will add to Stan
ford's social life a much-needed spice.
