Yesterday's article regarding last Friday's Law As
sociation meeting omitted mention of a very important
pei son, Jack Hyerson, who was elected vice-president
and who, ironically, was the only officer elected at
that, meeting. The rest of us are survivors from the
spring elections, except that this writer, in accord
ance with the intestacy provisions of the Law Asso
eiation Constitution, has succeeded Kill Grant, whose
timely graduation occurred last quarter.
