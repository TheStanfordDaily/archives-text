# Stanford Equestrians Wait for Springtime
## 
### 
When the snow begins to melt and
skiers lift the racks off their cars,
many Stanfordites start waxing
boots instead of hickory sticks and
ride the trails here on the Farm.
To start off the riding program a
series of lectures will be held this
quarter covering every phase of rid
ing from polo to rodeo competition.
Eric Pedley, Stanford alumnus and
a ranking American poloist, is ex
pected to present the first talk at
Lagunita at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.
Moonlight Rides
Riding has become a part of Stan
ford in spring when students plan
on moonlght rides, barn dances,
.trail rides in the hills and begin
looking forward to bareback relays,
hay rides, and square dances on
horseback.
Every kind of rider can lintl the
horse he likes and the instruction he
needs at the Old Red Bain. Mr. and
Mrs. Allen Ross welcome men and
women beginners, intermediate, or
advanced for English and Western
classes, jumping, and po'o. Riding
is included in the physical educa
tion curriculum.
The Rosses revived the riding tra
dition here in 1940 when they

brought 35 horses to the Big Red
Barn, dusted away the cobwebs, and
painted new names on the stalls.
Riding was never offered at Stan
ford before except through the
ROTC, but the Farm had long been
known for its fine horses. Senator
Stanford's champion racers and
trotters once tromped through the
same stables.
Club Arranges Groups
Anyone who wants to ride and is
not in a class is urged to phone the
stables any time to reserve a horse
or call Muurine Bourne, president of
the Riding Club, who can get a
group together.
The Riding Club activities are
open to all students. Kiowas, its
Western counterpart, holds tryouts
for its members, and Dean Eyre is
now trying to raise a Western team
to participate in the Intercollegate
Rodeo this spring.
Polo enthusiasts don't wait for
riding weather. They have been
playing indoors in San Francisco.
They use a bigger ball and fewer
men in a rough-riding sport with a
high spectator potential.
The Stanford team will journey to
New Mexico this spring. Lust quar
ter both teams split with one game
each. A trophy is awarded to the
visiting team in case of a tie. Any
team winning three times keeps the
cup.
Spring Horse Shows
All riders in spring classes may
participate in horse shows with Cal,
Mills, Davis, San Francisco City
College, and Menlo, culminating in
the Intercollegate Hor.se Show.
The third annual Stanford horse
show, late in the quarter, will be
open to all Stanford students,
whether enrolled in classes or not.
Events will include the regular
horsemanship competition plus re
lay races, jumping, and drill team,
complete with banners and high
stepping steeds.

Lagunita at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.
Moonlight Rides
Riding has become a part of Stan
ford in spring when students plan
on moonlght rides, barn dances,
.trail rides in the hills and begin
looking forward to bareback relays,
hay rides, and square dances on
horseback.
Every kind of rider can lintl the
horse he likes and the instruction he
needs at the Old Red Bain. Mr. and
Mrs. Allen Ross welcome men and
women beginners, intermediate, or
advanced for English and Western
classes, jumping, and po'o. Riding
is included in the physical educa
tion curriculum.
The Rosses revived the riding tra
dition here in 1940 when they

brought 35 horses to the Big Red
Barn, dusted away the cobwebs, and
painted new names on the stalls.
Riding was never offered at Stan
ford before except through the
ROTC, but the Farm had long been
known for its fine horses. Senator
Stanford's champion racers and
trotters once tromped through the
same stables.
Club Arranges Groups
Anyone who wants to ride and is
not in a class is urged to phone the
stables any time to reserve a horse
or call Muurine Bourne, president of
the Riding Club, who can get a
group together.
The Riding Club activities are
open to all students. Kiowas, its
Western counterpart, holds tryouts
for its members, and Dean Eyre is
now trying to raise a Western team
to participate in the Intercollegate
Rodeo this spring.
Polo enthusiasts don't wait for
riding weather. They have been
playing indoors in San Francisco.
They use a bigger ball and fewer
men in a rough-riding sport with a
high spectator potential.
The Stanford team will journey to
New Mexico this spring. Lust quar
ter both teams split with one game
each. A trophy is awarded to the
visiting team in case of a tie. Any
team winning three times keeps the
cup.
Spring Horse Shows
All riders in spring classes may
participate in horse shows with Cal,
Mills, Davis, San Francisco City
College, and Menlo, culminating in
the Intercollegate Hor.se Show.
The third annual Stanford horse
show, late in the quarter, will be
open to all Stanford students,
whether enrolled in classes or not.
Events will include the regular
horsemanship competition plus re
lay races, jumping, and drill team,
complete with banners and high
stepping steeds.
When the snow begins to melt and
skiers lift the racks off their cars,
many Stanfordites start waxing
boots instead of hickory sticks and
ride the trails here on the Farm.
To start off the riding program a
series of lectures will be held this
quarter covering every phase of rid
ing from polo to rodeo competition.
