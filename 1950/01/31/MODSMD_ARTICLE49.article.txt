Yesterday the story broke that Forrest Evashevski, loi'iner Michigan
jrfeut, had iiifctl to coach the Washington State Cougars. 11 this is so; and
11 it- AP quoted and "unimpeachable source," then Stanford will not lose its
.second first-rate coach in two weeks.
Reports have had it that Dutch Fehring wa.s in the running for the head
position'of the Washington school. Dutch is a newcomer at Stanford. He
lias been here hut one year in the job of assistant line coach. He was one
of the triumvirate mentioned in this column as sound men for the head line
coaching job. Chuck Taylor, now line coach of the '41)ers, and Jim Cox, due
to graduate from Law School this year, were the others.
Hut it looks now as il Dutch will be the one man left to Stanford come
the 1950 grid season. He was approached by WSC Athletic Director Bob
Brubley and faculty representative T. H. Kennedy. The three talked over
Ihe situation at length hut Dutch was like the little girl who "wouldn't say
ye.s or wouldn't say no." He wanted to know a little more about the set-up
in the Palouse country. The climate was an important factor to the Fehring
family, his daughter suffers from asthma.
ißut the talks never went much beyond the interview stage. Then came
thr report that Evashevski had come to terms.
WSC May Use Single Wing
If 111i.s is so, it may well be that WSC will return to the single wing teams
of the Babe Hollingberry era. The Cougars will join Oregon State, UCLA,
and Idaho in the non-T-formation class. It is also hinted in certain sources
fhat USC may turn to the single wing attack. Jeff Cravath's teams have long
featured single wing blocking in the line. Now that T-formation quarter
hack Jiui Powers has left, it might well he that El Troje will switch, too.

AI Masters is back in business after extensive travels and a siege in bed
localise .ol illness. He came back to face several tough problems—the least
if which is not the replacement of Chuck Taylor.
No llurrv to Choose Taylor's Successor
But the Athletic Director is in no great hurry to choose Taylor's succes
sor. He would first like to have a former Stanford man in the job. He
denied talk that he was seeking a man from the Southland as such. It has
been rumored that Stanford would pick its new frosh coach from the L.A.
area because of the recruitment advantages from the rich prep area. "We'll
take a man because he fits the job, not because he is from a certain locality,'
•aid Masters.
Few formal applications have been received for the job, but there have
been many "feelers" from surprising sources. The sources are "surprising"
in that the applications come from men in solid high school and junior col
lege positions. These men, for the most part, have tenure of 10 to 15 years,
and are* making about as much as a starting freshman coach at Stanford
would make.
The only explanation I can figure is that these men look upon the job as a
future stepping stone to better positions. Even so, Stanford signs its frosh
coaches-on year-to-year contracts—hardly worth giving up a sure prep or
JC job for such an arrangement. But. the choice should be made in the
next six weeks.

A wen-written letter reached the sports desk the other day. The writer
asked why it is that Stanford schedules no intersectional track meets and
enters none of the big relay events in the East.
No Big Meet Relays This Year
~ J
As it looks now, the Big Meet Relays will not be held this year. April 1
was the.date for the traditional, but Cal has scheduled another meet for
that date. So the ds are free to look elsewhere. Negotiations are under
way to bring Yale here, or to travel to New Haven on that date.
Such a dual meet would feature three of the best shotputters of our time.
Otis Chandler and Lew Davis of Stanford and Jim Fuchs of Old Eli. Talks
were under way between Michigan State and Stanford to sked a meet
v/hen Masters was attending the NCAA Conference, but this possibility
seems to have fallen through.
By the way, the Cards get an early chance at USC this year. The track
teams meet on April 8. SC, long known as a strong finisher but a weak
starter, could fall to a Stanford team known for opposite habits.
In any event, this is the year that Stanford should meet a strong inter
: ectional opponent. The Cards are not a strong all around team. Indeed, I
don't see how they can achieve the heights some early predictors have fore
cast. But they do feature Chandler and Gay Bryan. Both of these lads have
had national recognition in major magazines as well as newspapers. It would
U. a fine deal for Stanford, both for the alumni and as a measure of attract
ing high school youths, for the Cardinals to be seen east of the Mississippi
more often than in an occasional three- or four-man NCAA meet. How
about it?

Baseball is just around the corner. Indeed, a week from this Saturday
the Farm lads begin a 35-game schedule that may take them to Hawaii.
First on the list, on Saturday, February 11. they meet a semi-pro outfit
from Richmond.
From then on, it's "play ball."
Braves Have Ten-Came Schedule
The Braves have not been overlooked this year, either. Ten games have |
been carded for the erstwhile jayvees, with seven more listed in a series ;
with the freshmen. The frosh have a 20-game scelidule.

The mural basketball race is of! and running. Now about a fourth of the i
way through, the leagues have turned up some pretty tough teams. Per- |
tonal observations rate the SAE's, Betas, and Dekes as the teams to beat.
