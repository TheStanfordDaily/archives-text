# Johnson Warns of War
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
Defense Johnson soberly cautioned j
tonight that an attack on this conn- j
try "could come from the opposite j
hemisphere without warning and !
with unpredictable fury."
Hut at another point Johnson ex- j
pressed belief that the prospect of
war is diminishing, despite the Pus- j
sian attitude. The military strength ;
of the United States, he declared, !
has much to do with discouraging a j
venture into a shooting war by an j
aggressor nation.
