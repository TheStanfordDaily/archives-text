# Stanford to Enter Sixteen In Call-Bulletin Aquatics
## Varsity Season Will Open Next Week When Mermen Go to San Jose State 
### 
Varsity Swim Coach Tom Haynie
lists 1G tentative Stanford entries in
the annual Call-Bulletin swimfest,
February 11-12 in San Francisco's
Fleischhacker Pool.
The Indians will go into the Call-
Bulletin meet—long the traditional
curtain-raiser on Bay Area water
wars—with their first intercollegiate
test behind them. They meet San
Jose State next Wednesday evening,
February 8, in the Spartan tank.
Of Haynie's 16 mermen who have
voiced a desire to splash for the
newspaper set, six are sophomores—
the predominant class on the var
sity roster. A quintet of juniors and
a lone senior. Jack Weeden, are
slated for action.
Sensational A 1 Holiday, who bids
fair to become the Farm's top free
styler since Bob Anderson, heads a
frosh entry rounded out by Irwin
Johnson, Bill Millard, and Dave Pe
terman.
Poolside kibitzers are still talking
about Holiday's unofficial 52.0 cen
tury freestyle of 10 days ago. It's no
secret that this is the Coast's very
best performance reported so far
this year.
Soph Peter Cole kept the optimis
tic chatter bristling when he
churned to a 4:54 440 in a Saturday
morning session. Cole couldn't even
believe the story Tom Haynie's
watch told. And if there hadn't been
a pair of timepieces on him, he still
would doubt that he had topped the
elusixe five - minute quarter and
thus trod upon Ralph Sala's hal
lowed ground.
The Indians play the hosts' role
first on February 24. when the ever
powerful Fullerton Jaycee comes up
1 11

from the Southland. Haynie's men
open their quest for recapture of the
PCC crown on April 15, facing Cal.
All opponents are on the slate with
the exception of COP, with whom a
home - and - home arrangement is
pending.

divisions follow:
Freestyle—Peter Cole, Lloyd Din
kelspiel, Bob Frojen, A 1 Holiday,
