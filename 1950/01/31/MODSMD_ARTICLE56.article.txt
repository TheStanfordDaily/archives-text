LODI; Jan. 30 (/I I ) — Twenty Col
lege of the Pacific football veterans
were named today by Eddie Le
Baron for the game with Bob Ce
leri's California All - Stars in the
Grape Bowl here February 12.
Le Baron and Celeri, who were
rivals for coast quarterback honors
last season, will coach as well as ;
play with their respective teams. :
Members of the squads, either grad- |
uating seniors or alumni, will share j
in the gate receipts.
Among other things, the late post
season affair is expected to offer j
first-hand comparison of the quar
terbacking merits of Le Baron and ■
Celeri. Arguments between sup
porters of the two T-formation ex- ;
perts waxed red hot during the 1949 j
season. The Northern California I
Football Writers' Association voted I
Le Baron the most valuable player
in the northern section.
