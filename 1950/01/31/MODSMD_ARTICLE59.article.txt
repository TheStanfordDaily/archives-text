"OPERATION PULL-OFF," an all-out attempt to free the USS
Missouri from the Chesapeake Bay mudbank near Norfolk, Vaâ€ž
is scheduled for February 2, when tides will be highest since
the ship ran aground January 17. The effort will be made by two
windlass-type beach salvage ships, several tugs, and powerful
winches on the battleship's deck which will haul on nine cables
attached to four-ton anchors imbedded in the bottom of the bay.
