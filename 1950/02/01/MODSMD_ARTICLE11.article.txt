### JOHN HALL 
Basketball season gets rolling again around these parts tdnight,
as Everett Dean's varsity will take the floor at 8 sharp to mix it up
with the San Francisco Olympic Club.
Preliminary clashes are scheduled between Stanford Braves
and San Mateo JC at 6:15, and between Stanford Frosh and Hay-

'ward High at .'5. Tickets arc still J
available at the SAC booth. , i
Stanford has already beaten the j
Olympic Club once this season, that
being a 69-515 trumping earlier in the |
year. Since then, Ihc Cards have I
gone downhill a bit, and the Clubmen i
have been picking up steam.
Kcse, Iverson at Forwards
The Winged O will probably start !
an all-Stanford lineup. Big Bill Rose, 1
fi-4, and double-deadly from about 1
20 feel out with a one-handed push j
shot, will lead the (.Mul) attack. Rose
nctted 10 points against Stanford in
the first game.
His running mate at the other for- ,
ward slot will he Milt Iverson, a '
hard driver and clever passer. |
Working the key will be .lack Dana, j
formerly Stanford's frosh coach, and :
before that a steady point-maker for
the 11)42 varsity, which won 2(5 games
and lost two during the season.
Sliver Jack Scharfcn and Fred ,
Oliver will work the guard slots. !
Oliver was a teammate of Dana's,
while Scharfen just finished his
Stanford duties last season.
Mentor Dean has had his men
working easily this week, getting !
ready for ther first test in 10 days, j
The Indians will he out for their i
eighth win of the season, which j
would give them a .500 record at 8j
for 16.
They will move off the Olympic i
Club game into a Friday night ses- '
sion with (lie St. Mary's Gaels at the
Cow Palace.
New Look
The Indians' starting team will still j
I have that new look tonight. Bomb- j
crs George Yardley and Jim Walsh I
(G-5 and (i-4) will be at their usual
forward spots. Ralph Carver (6-3)
will start at center. Jack O'Sullivan
and Bruce Iverson (5-10 and (5-0)
will work the guards.
At practice this week, Burnett and
Dean have had the Cards using a
hall-control, sharp passing offense,
with little emphasis on the last
break.
Looking particularly good in this
,-tylf have been Bruce Iverson and
Ralph Carver. Iverson, with a driv
ing lay-in shot, has been improving
rapidly of late. Carver was complete
master of the keyhole Wednesday
night.
lion Carver, peppery reserve for
forward, turned in a sharp perform
; nee during Monday's scrimmage.
Carver's leg is still bothering him
from a recent charley-horse.
Jack O'Sullivan and Jim Walsh
were high men for the Cards in the
first Olympic Club battle with 13
points each. Yardley had 12.


RIPPER RON GARVER, fast-moving reserve forward, will get a
good shot at the Olympic Club tonight. A peppery team man,
Garver has been bothered lately by a charley-horse. He is one
of the six sophomores on the 12-man varsity squad. Garver, only
5-feet-9, amazes the patrons with his ability to come up with re
bounds.

Preliminary clashes are scheduled between Stanford Braves
and San Mateo JC at 6:15, and between Stanford Frosh and Hay-

'ward High at .'5. Tickets arc still J
available at the SAC booth. , i
Stanford has already beaten the j
Olympic Club once this season, that
being a 69-515 trumping earlier in the |
year. Since then, Ihc Cards have I
gone downhill a bit, and the Clubmen i
have been picking up steam.
Kcse, Iverson at Forwards
The Winged O will probably start !
an all-Stanford lineup. Big Bill Rose, 1
fi-4, and double-deadly from about 1
20 feel out with a one-handed push j
shot, will lead the (.Mul) attack. Rose
nctted 10 points against Stanford in
the first game.
His running mate at the other for- ,
ward slot will he Milt Iverson, a '
hard driver and clever passer. |
Working the key will be .lack Dana, j
formerly Stanford's frosh coach, and :
before that a steady point-maker for
the 11)42 varsity, which won 2(5 games
and lost two during the season.
Sliver Jack Scharfcn and Fred ,
Oliver will work the guard slots. !
Oliver was a teammate of Dana's,
while Scharfen just finished his
Stanford duties last season.
Mentor Dean has had his men
working easily this week, getting !
ready for ther first test in 10 days, j
The Indians will he out for their i
eighth win of the season, which j
would give them a .500 record at 8j
for 16.
They will move off the Olympic i
Club game into a Friday night ses- '
sion with (lie St. Mary's Gaels at the
Cow Palace.
New Look
The Indians' starting team will still j
I have that new look tonight. Bomb- j
crs George Yardley and Jim Walsh I
(G-5 and (i-4) will be at their usual
forward spots. Ralph Carver (6-3)
will start at center. Jack O'Sullivan
and Bruce Iverson (5-10 and (5-0)
will work the guards.
At practice this week, Burnett and
Dean have had the Cards using a
hall-control, sharp passing offense,
with little emphasis on the last
break.
Looking particularly good in this
,-tylf have been Bruce Iverson and
Ralph Carver. Iverson, with a driv
ing lay-in shot, has been improving
rapidly of late. Carver was complete
master of the keyhole Wednesday
night.
lion Carver, peppery reserve for
forward, turned in a sharp perform
; nee during Monday's scrimmage.
Carver's leg is still bothering him
from a recent charley-horse.
Jack O'Sullivan and Jim Walsh
were high men for the Cards in the
first Olympic Club battle with 13
points each. Yardley had 12.


RIPPER RON GARVER, fast-moving reserve forward, will get a
good shot at the Olympic Club tonight. A peppery team man,
Garver has been bothered lately by a charley-horse. He is one
of the six sophomores on the 12-man varsity squad. Garver, only
5-feet-9, amazes the patrons with his ability to come up with re
bounds.
Basketball season gets rolling again around these parts tdnight,
as Everett Dean's varsity will take the floor at 8 sharp to mix it up
with the San Francisco Olympic Club.
