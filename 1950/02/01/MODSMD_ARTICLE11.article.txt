## Five Ex-Stanford Cagers Challenge Indian Varsity in Return Match 
### JOHN HALL 
Basketball season gets rolling again around these parts tdnight,
as Everett Dean's varsity will take the floor at 8 sharp to mix it up
with the San Francisco Olympic Club.
Preliminary clashes are scheduled between Stanford Braves
and San Mateo JC at 6:15, and between Stanford Frosh and Hay-

'ward High at .'5. Tickets arc still J
available at the SAC booth. , i
Stanford has already beaten the j
Olympic Club once this season, that
being a 69-515 trumping earlier in the |
year. Since then, Ihc Cards have I
gone downhill a bit, and the Clubmen i
have been picking up steam.
Kcse, Iverson at Forwards
The Winged O will probably start !
an all-Stanford lineup. Big Bill Rose, 1
fi-4, and double-deadly from about 1
20 feel out with a one-handed push j
shot, will lead the (.Mul) attack. Rose
nctted 10 points against Stanford in
the first game.
His running mate at the other for- ,
ward slot will he Milt Iverson, a '
hard driver and clever passer. |
Working the key will be .lack Dana, j
formerly Stanford's frosh coach, and :
before that a steady point-maker for
the 11)42 varsity, which won 2(5 games
and lost two during the season.
Sliver Jack Scharfcn and Fred ,
Oliver will work the guard slots. !
Oliver was a teammate of Dana's,
while Scharfen just finished his
Stanford duties last season.
Mentor Dean has had his men
working easily this week, getting !
ready for ther first test in 10 days, j
The Indians will he out for their i
eighth win of the season, which j
would give them a .500 record at 8j
for 16.
They will move off the Olympic i
Club game into a Friday night ses- '
sion with (lie St. Mary's Gaels at the
Cow Palace.
