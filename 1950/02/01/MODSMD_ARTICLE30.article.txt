Public posting of grades at the University of Akron
led to confusion and embarrassment at the bulletin
bonds, and the administration finally took pity on
the students, it's now being done by mail notification.
Special stamped postcard forms are being sold at the
university bookstore.
But suppose the postman reads them?

Students at Columbia University showed "nearly
universal apathy" to a water-saving Thirsty Thursday,

It happened at fJon/.aga University in Spokane, or
at least the Bulletin said it did, and had pictures to
prove it. The paper's editor-in-chief fell off a seeond
: tory ledge and suffered considerable bruises and
lacerations.
The news editor admitted the chief was in need of a
sensational news story. "My only wish is that it could
have been me," he added.
The editor's only comment, made from a hospital
hod: "My only wish is that it hadn't happened to me."

litre's more dupe on studying for exams, reported
m the Columbia IkiiJy Spectator. The medical director

there explains that you wouldn't go on an all-night
binge the night before an exam, and that an all-night
cram session lias the same effect.
The best policy before a final is to enjoy a light
movie, release the worries and problems of the bur
dened mind without the aid of opium, alcohol, or .sex
(how else is there?), and get a good night's rest.

At the University of Miami, in Florida, .some dormi
tories have individual kitchens lor groups of about
four roommates, who prepare their own meals. The
cook is designated by the repulsive name of "Mother
Hen" in one dormitory.
The dirtiest job is that, of garbage-disposer. When
the current-garbage girl is in peril from disposal
livestock, the giving of the alarm is known as "bug
call. "Help!" means cockroaches, "Eek" is lor palm
beetles, and scorpions leave 'em speechless.
