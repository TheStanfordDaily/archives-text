### JOHN HALL 
This one's for Swigart, tlie present editor of this
•heel, who will go into a quick retire next Thursday
night after a volume of good editing and sincere effort.
He's done a good job, was the leading supporter for
returning The Daily last autumn to regular size, and
has written the best edits J have read since coming to
Stanfoid.

So, pardon the gush while I
repeat, this one's for Swigart.
He's been part of the newspa
per business, which- they tell me
is whacky and unpredictable,
dry and wet, black and white,
funny and serious, and above all—
catching.
The tiling I like best about
newspapermen is that they usu
ally have a sense of humor. In
fact, there are those who believe

that the city room is the backbone of all real humor.
At any rate, men such as Damon Runyon, Ring
Lardner, James Thurber, Hugs Baer, H. Allen Smith,
Earl Wilson, and Bennett Cerf have put out more than
their share of good stories.
One of their favorites is an anecdote about the great
G. K. Bovard, who was then managing editor of the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
A terriffie story had just broken.
The rewrite man assigned to write it leaped to his
typewriter to make the deadline—and froze. His mind
had gone blank under pressure, and hi.s lingers
wouldn't move.
Bovard put a hand gently on his shoulder and said:
"Don't be nervous, son. You've got a minute and a
half."
Another story about rewrite men concerns one of
the best in the business—a man named Malcolm
Logan.
There came a day when there was a dramatic story
to he written. An elevator operator, hi.s leg crushed

in an elevator, had to have his log amputated so that
he could be freed.
Logan was working for a city editor who loved one
word leads, and when Logan turned in the story, the
eity editor didn't think it had enough push and wrote
one of hi.s own. It started out like this:
"Grit!
"Grit!
"Grit!
"That's what elevator operator Harold Jones showed
today."
The city editor said to Logan simply, "That's the
sort of thing I want."
Whereupon Logan swung around to his typewriter
and wrote something, then handed it to the city edi
tor. It read:
"Quit!
"Quit!
"Quit!
"That's what rewrite man Malcolm Logan did to
day!"
Also popular are the one-line punch heads which
have a slight touch of the old gag in them.
Jack Lait was red hot when he handed in a story
about Harry Thaw returning from a mental insti
tution:
"Hairy Thaw came home today brown as nut."
Then there's always the one about the reporter who
tinned in a story that he had taken over the phone
about a farmer losing 2.002 pigs. The editor thought
looked wrong, phoned the farmer, and said, "Is this
Farmer Brown?"
"It thertainly ith," said the farmer.
The editor changed the story to read: "Two sows
and two pigs."
So, have you had enough? We could always branch
off into typographical errors which have created the
greatest roars of all time, but let's just call it quits
with a period.

Logan was working for a city editor who loved one
word leads, and when Logan turned in the story, the
eity editor didn't think it had enough push and wrote
one of hi.s own. It started out like this:
"Grit!
"Grit!
"Grit!
"That's what elevator operator Harold Jones showed
today."
The city editor said to Logan simply, "That's the
sort of thing I want."
Whereupon Logan swung around to his typewriter
and wrote something, then handed it to the city edi
tor. It read:
"Quit!
"Quit!
"Quit!
"That's what rewrite man Malcolm Logan did to
day!"
Also popular are the one-line punch heads which
have a slight touch of the old gag in them.
Jack Lait was red hot when he handed in a story
about Harry Thaw returning from a mental insti
tution:
"Hairy Thaw came home today brown as nut."
Then there's always the one about the reporter who
tinned in a story that he had taken over the phone
about a farmer losing 2.002 pigs. The editor thought
looked wrong, phoned the farmer, and said, "Is this
Farmer Brown?"
"It thertainly ith," said the farmer.
The editor changed the story to read: "Two sows
and two pigs."
So, have you had enough? We could always branch
off into typographical errors which have created the
greatest roars of all time, but let's just call it quits
with a period.

This one's for Swigart, tlie present editor of this
•heel, who will go into a quick retire next Thursday
night after a volume of good editing and sincere effort.
He's done a good job, was the leading supporter for
returning The Daily last autumn to regular size, and
has written the best edits J have read since coming to
Stanfoid.

So, pardon the gush while I
repeat, this one's for Swigart.
He's been part of the newspa
per business, which- they tell me
is whacky and unpredictable,
dry and wet, black and white,
funny and serious, and above all—
catching.
The tiling I like best about
newspapermen is that they usu
ally have a sense of humor. In
fact, there are those who believe

that the city room is the backbone of all real humor.
At any rate, men such as Damon Runyon, Ring
Lardner, James Thurber, Hugs Baer, H. Allen Smith,
Earl Wilson, and Bennett Cerf have put out more than
their share of good stories.
One of their favorites is an anecdote about the great
G. K. Bovard, who was then managing editor of the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
A terriffie story had just broken.
The rewrite man assigned to write it leaped to his
typewriter to make the deadline—and froze. His mind
had gone blank under pressure, and hi.s lingers
wouldn't move.
Bovard put a hand gently on his shoulder and said:
"Don't be nervous, son. You've got a minute and a
half."
Another story about rewrite men concerns one of
the best in the business—a man named Malcolm
Logan.
There came a day when there was a dramatic story
to he written. An elevator operator, hi.s leg crushed

in an elevator, had to have his log amputated so that
he could be freed.
