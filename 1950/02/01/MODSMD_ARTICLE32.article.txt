# CAMPUS OPINION
## Mr. Farris' Letter 
### 
To the Editor:
Now thut the Stanford Student Federalists have
thoroughly discredited Thomas E. Farris and his opin
ions on world government, let me enter the debate.
Fi itjof Thygeson, who sits on the National Executive
Council pf UWF, tells us that California has passed a
hand-tailored resolution aimed at world government.
Thygeson forgot to tell you, us Collier's ably reported,
that the resolution was passed under the influence ol
liquor lobbyist Aitie Sainish. Photostatic* evidence is
available for doubting federalists.
Thygeson also mentions the popular support for
the movement. According to UWF statistics, there are
fcv/er than 1500 World Federalists in the 12 states of
Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
LJt;:h, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 'Die money and
membership conies from New York, California, and
Pennsylvania.
Chairman Reid Dennis believes it is significant that
127 members of Congress have lent their names to a
resolution supporting world federation. Congressman
Jack Z Anderson, who supports the resolution, l>e
licves federation won't be achieved in this century.
That's somewhat again UWF's master plan. And
wasn't it Anderson who voted against reciprocal trade
agreements time and time again? Does a tariff-con -
• < ious congressman make a good world federalist?
In 1949, Ohio's state senate voted down the Cali
fornia Plan of UWF 14 to 12. This was the third legis
lative defeat in 1949 for this group. Last week, Geor
gia retracted its earlier endorsement of world govern
ment. The resolution to rescind the action passed the
house without dissenting vote. It passed the senate
i) 4 to 8 after stormy debate.
The party platforms of the Democrats and Repub
licans say that both parties seek to achieve peace
through organized international co-operation and not
by joining a world state. Only Wallace's Progressive
Party and the Liberal Party have come out for world
government.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, California Council
of Republican Women, and the American Legion of
California have recently passed resolutions con
demning the UWF.
Dennis speaks of the convention of the World Move
ment for World Federal Government held in Stock
holm. World Government News says that 32 world
federalist organizations were represented. UWF paid
dues for 40,000 members, while the other 31 paid for
lower than HO,OOO. Does this mean that there are fewer
than 100,000 registered federalists in the world?
Warren Austin, as reported by Dennis, saw the light
after a chat with Cord Meyer Jr. The ambassador
made his generalized statement in August. His severe
ci iticism appeared in the October issue of Reader's
Digest. One gentleman in Palo Alto received permis

sion to reprint the article in December. Is Austin play
ing both sides ol the fence?
When 1 pointed out to speaker Stanley Weigel that
the American people will never actually vote on this
issue, but that the whole matter of entering a world
government will be decided upon by the state legis
latures, he told me to go home and study this question.
Let me share Weigel's question with you.
"Do you trust the intelligence of the American
people?"
DO YOU?
ROBERT L. IJAVIS
To the Editor:
There has been a lot of talk back and forth about
World Government, and 1 should like to put in my
two-bits too.
Mr. Weigel declares that his speech was "serious,
but not grim." I don't know about his grimness, but
as to seriousness, to me any idea like World Govern
ment is definitely comical. And it becomes absolutely
hilarious when Mr. Weigel correlates World Govern
ment and a return to reason. . . . About Russia not
joining, Mr. Weigel does not need to worry, there is
too much money and profit in it for her, or for any
other country besides the U.S. Yet. concerning "world
peace," I regret not being able to share Mr. Weigel's
blissful optimism. The reason should be obvious to
such an eminent debater as he.
It would be unfair for me not to mention all the
other mordant, sarcastic, indignant, or otherwise out
standing letters which replied to Mr. Farris. As for
the California legislature, which Mr. Thygeson calls
to our attention, let us get this straight: the adoption
of the aforementioned screwball idea is only due to
Mr. Artie Samish's consent. Congratulations to Mr.
Marion for his statement of nothing about nothing.
Hut I would like to know why our imaginary World
Government is going to be our type of a democracy?
We are the only ones who have it or who care for it.
Other nations, will not let us impose it on tfiem.
Concerning Mr. Dennis' letter, I can see something
less than serene optimism: facts. I could mention
enough facts to make anybody dizzy, but I'd rather
hit World Federalists right between the eyes with an
inadequately practical, bothersome idea: Who is going
to pay the bill? Because World Government costs
money! (Absurd, isn't it?) It is us you and I. I don't
feel like paying 200 per cent more taxes and neither
does John Q. Citizen. Let other countries find their
way with their own small funds. I know the World
Federalists aren't that selfish, no, they are as generous
as St. Francis.
We have seen the scanty success of the United Na
tions. Should we make this a reason for the creation
of World Government? 1 quote Mr. Robert H. Walker:
"Should a swimmer, because he has failed to swim
the English Channel, attempt to swim across the At
lantic Ocean?"

as to seriousness, to me any idea like World Govern
ment is definitely comical. And it becomes absolutely
hilarious when Mr. Weigel correlates World Govern
ment and a return to reason. . . . About Russia not
joining, Mr. Weigel does not need to worry, there is
too much money and profit in it for her, or for any
other country besides the U.S. Yet. concerning "world
peace," I regret not being able to share Mr. Weigel's
blissful optimism. The reason should be obvious to
such an eminent debater as he.
It would be unfair for me not to mention all the
other mordant, sarcastic, indignant, or otherwise out
standing letters which replied to Mr. Farris. As for
the California legislature, which Mr. Thygeson calls
to our attention, let us get this straight: the adoption
of the aforementioned screwball idea is only due to
Mr. Artie Samish's consent. Congratulations to Mr.
Marion for his statement of nothing about nothing.
Hut I would like to know why our imaginary World
Government is going to be our type of a democracy?
We are the only ones who have it or who care for it.
Other nations, will not let us impose it on tfiem.
Concerning Mr. Dennis' letter, I can see something
less than serene optimism: facts. I could mention
enough facts to make anybody dizzy, but I'd rather
hit World Federalists right between the eyes with an
inadequately practical, bothersome idea: Who is going
to pay the bill? Because World Government costs
money! (Absurd, isn't it?) It is us you and I. I don't
feel like paying 200 per cent more taxes and neither
does John Q. Citizen. Let other countries find their
way with their own small funds. I know the World
Federalists aren't that selfish, no, they are as generous
as St. Francis.
We have seen the scanty success of the United Na
tions. Should we make this a reason for the creation
of World Government? 1 quote Mr. Robert H. Walker:
"Should a swimmer, because he has failed to swim
the English Channel, attempt to swim across the At

Now thut the Stanford Student Federalists have
thoroughly discredited Thomas E. Farris and his opin

Fi itjof Thygeson, who sits on the National Executive
Council pf UWF, tells us that California has passed a
hand-tailored resolution aimed at world government.
Thygeson forgot to tell you, us Collier's ably reported,
that the resolution was passed under the influence ol
liquor lobbyist Aitie Sainish. Photostatic* evidence is
available for doubting federalists.
Thygeson also mentions the popular support for
the movement. According to UWF statistics, there are
fcv/er than 1500 World Federalists in the 12 states of
Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
LJt;:h, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 'Die money and
membership conies from New York, California, and
Pennsylvania.
Chairman Reid Dennis believes it is significant that
127 members of Congress have lent their names to a
resolution supporting world federation. Congressman
Jack Z Anderson, who supports the resolution, l>e
licves federation won't be achieved in this century.
That's somewhat again UWF's master plan. And
wasn't it Anderson who voted against reciprocal trade
agreements time and time again? Does a tariff-con -

In 1949, Ohio's state senate voted down the Cali
fornia Plan of UWF 14 to 12. This was the third legis
lative defeat in 1949 for this group. Last week, Geor
gia retracted its earlier endorsement of world govern
ment. The resolution to rescind the action passed the
house without dissenting vote. It passed the senate
i) 4 to 8 after stormy debate.
The party platforms of the Democrats and Repub
licans say that both parties seek to achieve peace
through organized international co-operation and not
by joining a world state. Only Wallace's Progressive
Party and the Liberal Party have come out for world
government.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, California Council
of Republican Women, and the American Legion of
California have recently passed resolutions con
demning the UWF.
Dennis speaks of the convention of the World Move
ment for World Federal Government held in Stock
holm. World Government News says that 32 world
federalist organizations were represented. UWF paid
dues for 40,000 members, while the other 31 paid for
lower than HO,OOO. Does this mean that there are fewer
than 100,000 registered federalists in the world?
Warren Austin, as reported by Dennis, saw the light
after a chat with Cord Meyer Jr. The ambassador
made his generalized statement in August. His severe
ci iticism appeared in the October issue of Reader's
Digest. One gentleman in Palo Alto received permis

sion to reprint the article in December. Is Austin play
ing both sides ol the fence?
When 1 pointed out to speaker Stanley Weigel that
the American people will never actually vote on this
issue, but that the whole matter of entering a world

In 1949, Ohio's state senate voted down the Cali
fornia Plan of UWF 14 to 12. This was the third legis
lative defeat in 1949 for this group. Last week, Geor
gia retracted its earlier endorsement of world govern
ment. The resolution to rescind the action passed the
house without dissenting vote. It passed the senate
i) 4 to 8 after stormy debate.
The party platforms of the Democrats and Repub
licans say that both parties seek to achieve peace
through organized international co-operation and not
by joining a world state. Only Wallace's Progressive
Party and the Liberal Party have come out for world
government.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, California Council
of Republican Women, and the American Legion of
California have recently passed resolutions con
demning the UWF.
Dennis speaks of the convention of the World Move
ment for World Federal Government held in Stock
holm. World Government News says that 32 world
federalist organizations were represented. UWF paid
dues for 40,000 members, while the other 31 paid for
lower than HO,OOO. Does this mean that there are fewer
than 100,000 registered federalists in the world?
Warren Austin, as reported by Dennis, saw the light
after a chat with Cord Meyer Jr. The ambassador
made his generalized statement in August. His severe
ci iticism appeared in the October issue of Reader's
Digest. One gentleman in Palo Alto received permis

sion to reprint the article in December. Is Austin play

When 1 pointed out to speaker Stanley Weigel that
the American people will never actually vote on this
issue, but that the whole matter of entering a world
government will be decided upon by the state legis
latures, he told me to go home and study this question.
Let me share Weigel's question with you.
"Do you trust the intelligence of the American
people?"
DO YOU?
ROBERT L. IJAVIS
To the Editor:
There has been a lot of talk back and forth about
World Government, and 1 should like to put in my
two-bits too.
Mr. Weigel declares that his speech was "serious,
but not grim." I don't know about his grimness, but
as to seriousness, to me any idea like World Govern
ment is definitely comical. And it becomes absolutely
hilarious when Mr. Weigel correlates World Govern
ment and a return to reason. . . . About Russia not
joining, Mr. Weigel does not need to worry, there is
too much money and profit in it for her, or for any
other country besides the U.S. Yet. concerning "world
peace," I regret not being able to share Mr. Weigel's
blissful optimism. The reason should be obvious to
such an eminent debater as he.
It would be unfair for me not to mention all the
other mordant, sarcastic, indignant, or otherwise out
standing letters which replied to Mr. Farris. As for
the California legislature, which Mr. Thygeson calls
to our attention, let us get this straight: the adoption
of the aforementioned screwball idea is only due to
Mr. Artie Samish's consent. Congratulations to Mr.
Marion for his statement of nothing about nothing.
Hut I would like to know why our imaginary World
Government is going to be our type of a democracy?
We are the only ones who have it or who care for it.
Other nations, will not let us impose it on tfiem.
Concerning Mr. Dennis' letter, I can see something
less than serene optimism: facts. I could mention
enough facts to make anybody dizzy, but I'd rather
hit World Federalists right between the eyes with an
inadequately practical, bothersome idea: Who is going
to pay the bill? Because World Government costs
money! (Absurd, isn't it?) It is us you and I. I don't
feel like paying 200 per cent more taxes and neither
does John Q. Citizen. Let other countries find their
way with their own small funds. I know the World
Federalists aren't that selfish, no, they are as generous
as St. Francis.
We have seen the scanty success of the United Na
tions. Should we make this a reason for the creation
of World Government? 1 quote Mr. Robert H. Walker:
"Should a swimmer, because he has failed to swim
the English Channel, attempt to swim across the At
lantic Ocean?"

To the Editor:
Now thut the Stanford Student Federalists have
thoroughly discredited Thomas E. Farris and his opin
ions on world government, let me enter the debate.
Fi itjof Thygeson, who sits on the National Executive
Council pf UWF, tells us that California has passed a
hand-tailored resolution aimed at world government.
Thygeson forgot to tell you, us Collier's ably reported,
that the resolution was passed under the influence ol
liquor lobbyist Aitie Sainish. Photostatic* evidence is
available for doubting federalists.
Thygeson also mentions the popular support for
the movement. According to UWF statistics, there are
fcv/er than 1500 World Federalists in the 12 states of
Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
LJt;:h, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 'Die money and
membership conies from New York, California, and
Pennsylvania.
Chairman Reid Dennis believes it is significant that
127 members of Congress have lent their names to a
resolution supporting world federation. Congressman
Jack Z Anderson, who supports the resolution, l>e
licves federation won't be achieved in this century.
That's somewhat again UWF's master plan. And
wasn't it Anderson who voted against reciprocal trade
agreements time and time again? Does a tariff-con -
