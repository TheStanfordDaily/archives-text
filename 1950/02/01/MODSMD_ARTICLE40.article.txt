# How To Play Rugby ...

Rugby is a game.
Nearly 1,000 Stanfordites who
crowded the old rugby field last
Saturday to watch Coach Chuck
Taylor's stalwart ones blast the
Olympic Club, 16-11, hud difficulty
believing this simple statement; but
game it is.
For the edification of those fans
who enjoy seeing an organized
riot, but would like to know just
how it is organized, we present a
simple explanation of the compli
cated game of rugby.
Fifteen Men
The game is played with 15 men
on a side. Seven of these 15 are
backs; the other eight are linemen,
better known as the scrum. There
is but one refei'ee in a game—i.e.,
match—so there are 31 milling men
on the field while the tussle is in
progress.
Ihe actual play in rugby resem
bles a cross between football, bas
ketball, and soccer. It is like foot
ball because it is played with a ball
resembling a fat football, and is
played on what looks like a football
field.
It is like basketball in that (unlike
football) there is no such thing as
permanent possession of the ball. It
is like soccer in that much of the
progressing is made by kicking the
ball in a "dribbling rush."
Kicking and Rushing
There are roughly two ways of
progressing the ball: (1) by kicking
it toward the opponents' goal line
either by punting it or dribbling it
with the feet; (2) rushing (running)
the ball. The ball may be lateraled
at will, but it may not be passed
forward, under any circumstances.

When, for any of a number of
reasons, the ball is declared "dead"
on the field, a "scrum" is called by
the referee. The scrum—as opposed
to the term meaning linemen—re
sembles two opposing football teams
mistakenly getting into the same
huddle. Actually it is an orderly bit
of tactics.
The three "front Tankmen" of
each team lock head and shoulders,
pushing against each other. Behind
them the two second rankmen and
the two breaks affix themselves so
as to be in a pushing motion on the
sterns of the front rankmen.
Lock Is Key Man
Last of all in the scrum is the
lock, whose head is inserted be
tween the second rankmen, and who
is boosting them along with his
shoulders. The object of the scrum
is to "heel" the ball out at the rear
of the scrum, so the backs can get
it and begin a running attack.
Since both teams are attempting
to accomplish this at the same time,
it becomes a somewhat strenuous
process.
When the ball is kicked out of
bounds, or when the ball carrier is
pushed out of bounds, the referee
calls for a "line out." The eight
linemen of each side mark each
other off and stand in two single
'iles waiting for one of the backs to
throw the ball down the center of
the two lines.
Lateral Used
Each lineman then tries to catch
the ball and lateral it to one of his
backs who are spread out toward
his defending goal line. The backs
then carry it forward in a running
rush.
Thus we have a few of the more
basic facts of the grand old game.

of it now than you did when you

team captain Mike Spiro at the
Firehouse. Mike will be glad to
explain the whole thing to you.

Rugby is a game.
Nearly 1,000 Stanfordites who
crowded the old rugby field last
Saturday to watch Coach Chuck
Taylor's stalwart ones blast the
Olympic Club, 16-11, hud difficulty
believing this simple statement; but
game it is.
For the edification of those fans
who enjoy seeing an organized
riot, but would like to know just
how it is organized, we present a
simple explanation of the compli
cated game of rugby.
Fifteen Men
The game is played with 15 men
on a side. Seven of these 15 are
backs; the other eight are linemen,
better known as the scrum. There
is but one refei'ee in a game—i.e.,
match—so there are 31 milling men
on the field while the tussle is in
progress.
Ihe actual play in rugby resem
bles a cross between football, bas
ketball, and soccer. It is like foot
ball because it is played with a ball
resembling a fat football, and is
played on what looks like a football
field.
It is like basketball in that (unlike
football) there is no such thing as
permanent possession of the ball. It
is like soccer in that much of the
progressing is made by kicking the
ball in a "dribbling rush."
Kicking and Rushing
There are roughly two ways of
progressing the ball: (1) by kicking
it toward the opponents' goal line
either by punting it or dribbling it
with the feet; (2) rushing (running)
the ball. The ball may be lateraled
at will, but it may not be passed
forward, under any circumstances.

When, for any of a number of
reasons, the ball is declared "dead"
on the field, a "scrum" is called by
the referee. The scrum—as opposed
to the term meaning linemen—re
sembles two opposing football teams
mistakenly getting into the same
huddle. Actually it is an orderly bit
of tactics.
The three "front Tankmen" of
each team lock head and shoulders,
pushing against each other. Behind
them the two second rankmen and
the two breaks affix themselves so
as to be in a pushing motion on the
sterns of the front rankmen.
Lock Is Key Man
Last of all in the scrum is the
lock, whose head is inserted be
tween the second rankmen, and who
is boosting them along with his
shoulders. The object of the scrum
is to "heel" the ball out at the rear
of the scrum, so the backs can get
it and begin a running attack.
Since both teams are attempting
to accomplish this at the same time,
it becomes a somewhat strenuous
process.
When the ball is kicked out of
bounds, or when the ball carrier is
pushed out of bounds, the referee
calls for a "line out." The eight
linemen of each side mark each
other off and stand in two single
'iles waiting for one of the backs to
throw the ball down the center of
the two lines.
Lateral Used
Each lineman then tries to catch
the ball and lateral it to one of his
backs who are spread out toward
his defending goal line. The backs
then carry it forward in a running
rush.
Thus we have a few of the more
basic facts of the grand old game.
If you don't understand any more
of it now than you did when you
started (his article, please reread the
article, then look up Stanford rugby
team captain Mike Spiro at the
Firehouse. Mike will be glad to
explain the whole thing to you.
