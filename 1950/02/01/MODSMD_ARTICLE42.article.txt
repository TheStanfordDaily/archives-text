# Delts Smash Zetes, 37 to 20; Phi Sigma Kappa Wins, 37 to 13
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Delta Tau Delta gave notice that
it will be a definite contender for
the intramural basketball crown as
the Delts yawned to an effortless 37
to 20 win over the Zetes last night.
In the opening minutes of the
game, diminutive "Rabbit Jim" i
Bradshaw of the Delts pumped
three consecutive baskets before j
Don Lucas tallied for the Zetes. The ;
Zetes then went into temporary hi- j
bernation again as the victors i

swelled the score to 11 to 2. They
held a 2k) uj 6 advantage at the half
time intermission.
The Zetes' Walker Smith caught
fire in the second stanza with a ten
point .scoring spree, but Smith's ef
forts weren't enough to match the
shooting mastery of the De'ts"
Bradshaw, Dougal Thamer, Ken
Rose, and mates.
The towering Thamer was high
point man along with Smith for 12
points. Rose, known for his football

prowess, was little less effective as
a man of bounce, as he accounted
for nine markers.
In another lopsided game, Phi
Sigma Kappa swamped Theta Delta
Chi 37 to 13. Chuck Fletcher of the
Theta Delts made the initial score
with a free throw. The Theta Delt.-> ?
glory was short-lived, however, as
Dave Breithaupt and John Del Fa
voro sank baskets for the Phi Sigs.
The latter had a 13-5 half-time lead.
High point man for the winners
was Mike Sloan with 14, while
guard John Marchand tallied eight
for, the Phi Sigs. Breithaupt had
11 -and Del Favoro six.
In the most breath-taking game of
the day, Village 308 came from a
20 to 14 half-time deficit to nose out
Village 306, 39 to 30. Harry Ganz
was a one-man hurricane for the
losers as he tanked 20 points. Next
in line was Tony Nicholson of the
winners, who chalked up 15.
