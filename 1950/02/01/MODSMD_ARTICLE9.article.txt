### HOLLY HASTE 
; barely has the San Francisco Sym
phony sounded better than it did in ]
last night's concert. Montcux'.s musi
cians followed his integrated and
strong interpretations with unusual
fluency and precision, especially the
I brass sections.
The Bartok Concerto for Orchcs- j
Ira was the only selection that de
parted from the tradition of giving
light or familiar programs for stu
dent concerts. The Concerto is one
of Bartok's romantic works, and the
I use of spectacular effects is not as j
prevalent as in some of his other J
compositions.
The first two movements are quite
original. The numerous fugati, par
ticularly in the brass sections, were
' excellently done and the whole ef- j
feet was one of balance. The last
movements arc more novel and
reminiscent of Debussy in places.
Some of the ending sounds like
peasants dancing, quite lacking the
. strength of the beginning of the
| work.
The Symphony No. 8 of Beethoven
! and the Spanish Rhapsody by Ravel,
' comprising the second half of the
I program, were effectively and cleanly j
I done. The balance aclncved by the !
| violins and woodwinds in the exotic
| and moving Ravel selection were
i especially notable.
