# Reds Reject Indo-China Protest
## 
### 
PARIS, Feb. I (/!') Russia curtly
rejected France's protest, over Com
munist-riven Indo - China today,
hardly even taking a look at it.
A French diplomatic ; ource said
French - Russian "relations were
never worse in recent years."
U.S. Secretary <>112 State Dean Ach
eron indicated in Washington the
United States will match Russian
recognition of Moscow-educated Ho
Chi - minh's Vietnam republic in
Indo - China by establishing diplo
matic relations with his French
backed rival, the Vietnam state
beaded by former Emperor Bao Dai.
These developments further thrust
into the world limelight the far-off
land of jungles and rice paddies as
a potential ignition point for an
East-West battle for Southeast Asia.
The French note, protesting that
Russia's recognition of Ho was en
couragement of a rebel and a grave
impairment of French-Soviet rela
tions, was handed to Soviet Ambas
sador Alexander Bogomolov only
la:.I night.
Hardly IH hours later, Bogomolov
handed the note hack, saying, "The
government of the USSR does not
consider il possible to receive such
a note.''
Such : peed raised the question
whether il had been necessary for
him to consult Moscow after he re
ceived the note.
The French did not let the mat
ter rest, however. The French For
eign Office asked Bogomolov to call
tomorrow to explain his action.
Dispatches through the censorship
screen in Indo-China, where Ho has
been fighting a hit-and-run jungle
war for more than three years, said
200 Vietnamese were killed yester
day in a battle with French troops
at Hue, on Communist. China's bor
der. French casualties were esti
mated at 20.
If a Greek or Spanish-type civil
war flares in Indo-China, many for
eign observers agree it will be due
to France's political fumbling and
military half-henrtcdness.
