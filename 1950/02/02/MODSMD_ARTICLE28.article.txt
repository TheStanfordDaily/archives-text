# Varsity Cagers Defeat Olympic Quint 66--56
## Rose Goes Out with Broken Wrist; Visiting Coach Forced to Don Suit 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's cage Indians came
out of their 10-day retirement
last night to ease by San Fran
cisco's Olympic Club, 66 to 56,
in what had graciously been ad
vertised as a basketball game.
The Olympic men had trouble in
putting together five men to start the
game, and when they finally did, their
leading scorer, Bill Rose, broke a
bone in his wrist in the opening min
ute. By this time, Coach Bob Fair
had suited up and the game went on.
At that, the short-handed Clubmen
put on an interesting show for the
scattered Pavilion crowd. With
Johnny Burton and Milt Iverson in
the saddle, the Winged O kept within
shooting distance until the final 10
minutes.
Score Knotted
The score was knotted five times in
the first half before Harry Hugasian
' dumped in three quick buckets to
give Stanford a 28 to 22 edge at in
termission.
Coming out after the rest period,
Milt Iverson, right at home on the
Pavilion hardwood, got hot with six
j straight points to lock the count for
• the sixth time at 30 to 30.
Indians Perk Up
At this point, the loafing Indians
finally showed some slight signs of
life. George Yardley ripped through
with a driving lay-in, Ralph Carver
tossed up a fall-away, Yardley tipped
for two, drove for another lay-in,
Jim Walsh hit from the key, and
| Carver threw for two more to shoot
the Cards into a 43 to 30 lead.
The Olympics tried to narrow tho
gap on some nice floor work and
jumpshot shooting by Burton, but
Yardley was controlling both boards
by now, and Milt Iverson's last-sec
ond bucket only closed it to 10 points.
John Burton was high man for thu
evening with 19 points, followed by
the fleet-footed Milt Iverson with 15.
Stanford's top scorer was Ralph Car
ver with 13. Yardley had 12, and
Hugasian flipped up 10.
Jack Dana, Jack Scharfen, and the
all-Stanford starting line-up never
materialized.

Stanford's cage Indians came
out of their 10-day retirement
last night to ease by San Fran
cisco's Olympic Club, 66 to 56,
in what had graciously been ad
vertised as a basketball game.
The Olympic men had trouble in
putting together five men to start the
game, and when they finally did, their
leading scorer, Bill Rose, broke a
bone in his wrist in the opening min
ute. By this time, Coach Bob Fair
had suited up and the game went on.
At that, the short-handed Clubmen
put on an interesting show for the
scattered Pavilion crowd. With
Johnny Burton and Milt Iverson in
the saddle, the Winged O kept within
shooting distance until the final 10
minutes.
Score Knotted
The score was knotted five times in
the first half before Harry Hugasian
' dumped in three quick buckets to
give Stanford a 28 to 22 edge at in
termission.
Coming out after the rest period,
Milt Iverson, right at home on the
Pavilion hardwood, got hot with six
j straight points to lock the count for
• the sixth time at 30 to 30.
Indians Perk Up
At this point, the loafing Indians
finally showed some slight signs of
life. George Yardley ripped through
with a driving lay-in, Ralph Carver
tossed up a fall-away, Yardley tipped
for two, drove for another lay-in,
Jim Walsh hit from the key, and
| Carver threw for two more to shoot
the Cards into a 43 to 30 lead.
The Olympics tried to narrow tho
gap on some nice floor work and
jumpshot shooting by Burton, but
Yardley was controlling both boards
by now, and Milt Iverson's last-sec
ond bucket only closed it to 10 points.
John Burton was high man for thu
evening with 19 points, followed by
the fleet-footed Milt Iverson with 15.
Stanford's top scorer was Ralph Car
ver with 13. Yardley had 12, and
Hugasian flipped up 10.
Jack Dana, Jack Scharfen, and the
all-Stanford starting line-up never
materialized.
