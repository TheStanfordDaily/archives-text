### HILL DAILEY 
( HOOSINC; YGlJlt MAJOR
By Dr. W. Habeas Corpus Dailey, A.8., 1.C.D., D.C..J.
* "Don't Cry, Joe"
(Editor's Note.—This is tJu; fourth in a serifs of
;utides by W. Habeas Corpus Dailey, America's
J'oiecnost judge, attorney, and stud poker player.
Today i>r. Dailey discusses tlie subject "So You're
Cuing to Study lavs, Eh?" or "Be Careful When
You Marry; Your In-Laws May Be Outlaws!"

When questioned by this pa
per about his teaching qualifica
tions, Dr. Dailey stated: "I have
studied at not one, but three dif
ferent universities. I've been to
Cornell ... wonderful school,
that Cornell. I've been to Notre
Dame . . . great school, that
Notre Dame. I've been to Stan
ford . . . wonderful girl, that
Sally!"
It was oidy because of Dr.

Daitey's father that the younger Dailey became a
lawyer. His poor father always wanted to be an at
torney himself, but was never able to yet into a col
lege. There was only one thing that kept bun out:
High School!

I3ut perhaps the best way for you to learn the law
is Uj study u ease which deals with the basic facts of
law. A phrase with which all law students should be
eome familiar is the term "habeas corpus." Trans
lated freely, this means "produce the body." The term
was originated in the famous case of Herman Haifa
hundred v.the Charles Fatless Company. It seems
that the Fatless Company promised to produce a body
for Mr. Halfahundred, who weighed only 50 pounds.
After 17 years of exercising with the Charles Fatless
"dynaliow tension" system, Mr. Halfahundred sued
Fatless for not producing his body. In 17 years, Haifa
hundred had gained only four pounds, and none of
this was muscle. While exercising one day, he dropped
a dumbbell on his foot., and a four-pound blister was
the result.
Unfortunately, space limitations restrain me from '
citing any more cases, but 1 shall list for your use
some of the more common legal terms and their ac
cepted meanings.
Miss-representation: A married woman who poses
as single.
Negligence: A fancy slip worn on the wedding night.
Nonsuit: A synonym for "indecent."
Mandate: An evening out for two boys from Finoc
chio's.
Tortious: The textbook for Econ I.
Prosecute: Cmon, you can talk plainer than that!

* "Don't Cry, Joe"
(Editor's Note.—This is tJu; fourth in a serifs of
;utides by W. Habeas Corpus Dailey, America's
J'oiecnost judge, attorney, and stud poker player.
Today i>r. Dailey discusses tlie subject "So You're
Cuing to Study lavs, Eh?" or "Be Careful When
You Marry; Your In-Laws May Be Outlaws!"

When questioned by this pa
per about his teaching qualifica
tions, Dr. Dailey stated: "I have
studied at not one, but three dif
ferent universities. I've been to
Cornell ... wonderful school,
that Cornell. I've been to Notre
Dame . . . great school, that
Notre Dame. I've been to Stan
ford . . . wonderful girl, that
Sally!"
It was oidy because of Dr.

Daitey's father that the younger Dailey became a
lawyer. His poor father always wanted to be an at
torney himself, but was never able to yet into a col
lege. There was only one thing that kept bun out:
High School!

I3ut perhaps the best way for you to learn the law
is Uj study u ease which deals with the basic facts of
law. A phrase with which all law students should be
eome familiar is the term "habeas corpus." Trans
lated freely, this means "produce the body." The term
was originated in the famous case of Herman Haifa
hundred v.the Charles Fatless Company. It seems
that the Fatless Company promised to produce a body
for Mr. Halfahundred, who weighed only 50 pounds.
After 17 years of exercising with the Charles Fatless
"dynaliow tension" system, Mr. Halfahundred sued
Fatless for not producing his body. In 17 years, Haifa
hundred had gained only four pounds, and none of
this was muscle. While exercising one day, he dropped
a dumbbell on his foot., and a four-pound blister was
the result.
Unfortunately, space limitations restrain me from '
citing any more cases, but 1 shall list for your use
some of the more common legal terms and their ac
cepted meanings.
Miss-representation: A married woman who poses
as single.
Negligence: A fancy slip worn on the wedding night.
Nonsuit: A synonym for "indecent."
Mandate: An evening out for two boys from Finoc
chio's.
Tortious: The textbook for Econ I.
Prosecute: Cmon, you can talk plainer than that!
