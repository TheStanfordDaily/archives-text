# CAMPUS OPINION
## Mr. Farris' Letter 
### 
To the Editor:
In the four letters which appeared in Tuesday's
Daily concerning the subject of world federal govern
ment, tiie observing reader will note that each writer
has used one of the United World Federalists' decep
tion devices. Mr. Thygeson used the fear tactic by
threatening us with the dire consequences of destruc
tion in an atomic war or in a hydrogen war if we failed
to submit to world federal government.
Mr. Blackwelder used the misinformation tactijc,
the tactic where a person who professes an honest be
lief against world federalism is labeled misinformed.
Mr. Marion used the discrediting tactic, the tactic
where an honest anti-federalist is discredited us hav
ing shown no facts to support his argument.
And lastly, Chairman Dennis of the Stanford Fed
eralist outfit used the claim-of-ignorance tactic where
the one who stands up against the insidious doctrine of
world federation is labeled ignorant of the facts.
Space does not permit me to discuss world federal
ism at any length in this letter; however, when the
UWF world "booby hatch" comes around, 1 do not
want to be one of the left-wing chickens in the brood.
Close examination of the world federalist movement
will reveal their adherence to the most radical form
of political thought, exactly the kind of radicalism
which fails to excite any enthusiasm among good
Americans.
Mr. Fan-is' words ought to be a ringing repudiation
of the vicious line of thought professed by the World
Federalist group: give more space to the practical
thinkers, the real Americans who are working to pi e
serve the American tradition and the American way
oi life in a world threatened by Communism and
swamped with international idiocy. It is high time
this movement of virtual America-wreckers be
stopped where it is before it is allowed to undermine
further the already-impaired morale of the people of
America!

To the Editor:
The letters of Davis and Wilde which appeared in
yesterday morning's Daily opposing world government
made my coffee taste even worse than usual. I hope
Yliat I shall he able to do the same for them, or at
least induce them to look at their views a little more
critically. Unless, as seems to he the case, they have
an irrational basis for their opposition to the World
Federalists and the concept of world government in
general. Regardless of whether or not Mr, Davis' facts
are correct, they have no effect upon the desirability
of world government or the necessity of attaining it
in the near future if catastrophe is to be avoided.
Granted that the membership of the IJWF, one of
the several organizations working for world govern
ment in the U.S., is comparatively small, and that the
organization still needs many more members to carry
on iUs educational, political, and reseat eh programs,
it could never hope to, nor is it necessary that it
include all those in the U.S. who favor world govern
ment now. Because, according to a Koper poll con
ducted iii 1946, that would mean (>2 per cent of the
population. Incidentally, in this poll, it was indicated
that only 19 per cent of the population was AGAINST
world government.)
Granted that Congressman Jack Anderson is anti
reciprocal trade, and thinks that world government is
not possible in this century, undoubtedly others of
the 127 sponsors of the world government resolution in
Congress feel the same way. It is fortunaU', however,
that the majority of the sponsors realize the necessity
tif world government sooner than that and have vot
i. v records on other issues which indicate that their
policies are consistent with this belief.
Whether Samish did support the WG resolution in
California or not makes no difference to my mind, as
l'ii as the integrity of the organization is concerned.
Condemnation by association cannot be applied to a
concept such as world government.
So the Vets of Foreign Wars and the California
Council of Republican Women have recently con
demned UWF. The American Veterans and the Young
Republican League have recently endorsed it. if one
is interested in letting others determine what he thinks
Ik- can choose either of the above sides he prefers. II
he wishes to think for himself, he will realize that
world government should be judged on its own merits.
So much for Davis' facta, which have only propaganda
and tmotlonal value.
Just two comments on Mi'. Wilde. He says, "World

government costs money. Absurd, isn't it?" Hasn't
he heard how much we're spending in our armament
race policy which has never yet in the history of man
prevented war? Yes, it is absurd, Mr. Wilde.
He also states that the scanty success of the UN
makes it unreasonable to attempt world government,
whereas the very fact that nothing short of govern- ;
merit and enforced law on an international scale can
bring success, is the basic logic of the entire Federalist i
concept. He is truly confused, and I hope only that he
has not succeeded in confusing too many others.

ducted iii 1946, that would mean (>2 per cent of the

Granted that Congressman Jack Anderson is anti
reciprocal trade, and thinks that world government is
not possible in this century, undoubtedly others of
the 127 sponsors of the world government resolution in
Congress feel the same way. It is fortunaU', however,

So much for Davis' facta, which have only propaganda

Just two comments on Mi'. Wilde. He says, "World

government costs money. Absurd, isn't it?" Hasn't
he heard how much we're spending in our armament
race policy which has never yet in the history of man

He also states that the scanty success of the UN
makes it unreasonable to attempt world government,

merit and enforced law on an international scale can
bring success, is the basic logic of the entire Federalist i

has not succeeded in confusing too many others.

In the four letters which appeared in Tuesday's
Daily concerning the subject of world federal govern
ment, tiie observing reader will note that each writer
has used one of the United World Federalists' decep
tion devices. Mr. Thygeson used the fear tactic by
threatening us with the dire consequences of destruc
tion in an atomic war or in a hydrogen war if we failed
to submit to world federal government.
Mr. Blackwelder used the misinformation tactijc,
the tactic where a person who professes an honest be
lief against world federalism is labeled misinformed.
Mr. Marion used the discrediting tactic, the tactic
where an honest anti-federalist is discredited us hav
ing shown no facts to support his argument.
And lastly, Chairman Dennis of the Stanford Fed
eralist outfit used the claim-of-ignorance tactic where
the one who stands up against the insidious doctrine of
world federation is labeled ignorant of the facts.
Space does not permit me to discuss world federal
ism at any length in this letter; however, when the
UWF world "booby hatch" comes around, 1 do not
want to be one of the left-wing chickens in the brood.
Close examination of the world federalist movement
will reveal their adherence to the most radical form
of political thought, exactly the kind of radicalism
which fails to excite any enthusiasm among good
Americans.
Mr. Fan-is' words ought to be a ringing repudiation
of the vicious line of thought professed by the World
Federalist group: give more space to the practical
thinkers, the real Americans who are working to pi e
serve the American tradition and the American way
oi life in a world threatened by Communism and
swamped with international idiocy. It is high time
this movement of virtual America-wreckers be
stopped where it is before it is allowed to undermine
further the already-impaired morale of the people of
America!

The letters of Davis and Wilde which appeared in
yesterday morning's Daily opposing world government
made my coffee taste even worse than usual. I hope
Yliat I shall he able to do the same for them, or at
least induce them to look at their views a little more
critically. Unless, as seems to he the case, they have
an irrational basis for their opposition to the World
Federalists and the concept of world government in
general. Regardless of whether or not Mr, Davis' facts
are correct, they have no effect upon the desirability
of world government or the necessity of attaining it
in the near future if catastrophe is to be avoided.
Granted that the membership of the IJWF, one of
the several organizations working for world govern
ment in the U.S., is comparatively small, and that the
organization still needs many more members to carry
on iUs educational, political, and reseat eh programs,
it could never hope to, nor is it necessary that it

world federation is labeled ignorant of the facts.
Space does not permit me to discuss world federal
ism at any length in this letter; however, when the
UWF world "booby hatch" comes around, 1 do not
want to be one of the left-wing chickens in the brood.
Close examination of the world federalist movement
will reveal their adherence to the most radical form
of political thought, exactly the kind of radicalism
which fails to excite any enthusiasm among good
Americans.
Mr. Fan-is' words ought to be a ringing repudiation
of the vicious line of thought professed by the World
Federalist group: give more space to the practical
thinkers, the real Americans who are working to pi e
serve the American tradition and the American way
oi life in a world threatened by Communism and
swamped with international idiocy. It is high time
this movement of virtual America-wreckers be
stopped where it is before it is allowed to undermine
further the already-impaired morale of the people of
America!

To the Editor:
The letters of Davis and Wilde which appeared in
yesterday morning's Daily opposing world government
made my coffee taste even worse than usual. I hope
Yliat I shall he able to do the same for them, or at
least induce them to look at their views a little more
critically. Unless, as seems to he the case, they have
an irrational basis for their opposition to the World
Federalists and the concept of world government in
general. Regardless of whether or not Mr, Davis' facts
are correct, they have no effect upon the desirability
of world government or the necessity of attaining it
in the near future if catastrophe is to be avoided.
Granted that the membership of the IJWF, one of
the several organizations working for world govern
ment in the U.S., is comparatively small, and that the
organization still needs many more members to carry
on iUs educational, political, and reseat eh programs,
it could never hope to, nor is it necessary that it
include all those in the U.S. who favor world govern
ment now. Because, according to a Koper poll con
ducted iii 1946, that would mean (>2 per cent of the
population. Incidentally, in this poll, it was indicated
that only 19 per cent of the population was AGAINST
world government.)
Granted that Congressman Jack Anderson is anti
reciprocal trade, and thinks that world government is
not possible in this century, undoubtedly others of
the 127 sponsors of the world government resolution in
Congress feel the same way. It is fortunaU', however,
that the majority of the sponsors realize the necessity
tif world government sooner than that and have vot
i. v records on other issues which indicate that their
policies are consistent with this belief.
Whether Samish did support the WG resolution in
California or not makes no difference to my mind, as
l'ii as the integrity of the organization is concerned.
Condemnation by association cannot be applied to a
concept such as world government.
So the Vets of Foreign Wars and the California
Council of Republican Women have recently con
demned UWF. The American Veterans and the Young
Republican League have recently endorsed it. if one
is interested in letting others determine what he thinks
Ik- can choose either of the above sides he prefers. II
he wishes to think for himself, he will realize that
world government should be judged on its own merits.
So much for Davis' facta, which have only propaganda
and tmotlonal value.
Just two comments on Mi'. Wilde. He says, "World

government costs money. Absurd, isn't it?" Hasn't
he heard how much we're spending in our armament
race policy which has never yet in the history of man
prevented war? Yes, it is absurd, Mr. Wilde.
He also states that the scanty success of the UN
makes it unreasonable to attempt world government,
whereas the very fact that nothing short of govern- ;
merit and enforced law on an international scale can
bring success, is the basic logic of the entire Federalist i
concept. He is truly confused, and I hope only that he
has not succeeded in confusing too many others.
