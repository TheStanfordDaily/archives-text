# Village Diserimination
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. Bill Swigart, in particular, and Lar ry Hoff and
Bill Kea in general, do not like the cry of "Village dis
crimination." At the special meeting of Excom to
determine the "results" of the election for Men's Coun
cil, these members protested vigorously against the plea
of the Village for the right to have its own polling booth.
It is "unfortunate," they said, that the voting booth in
the Village was opened 40 minutes late. (The booth was
open from 12:15 to 2:20, while those on campus were
open from 8:00 to 3:30.)
"Why didn't the Villagers who were unable to vote go
to campus to vote there?" said one. Another made the
constructive suggestion of having a voting-booth for
each off-campus student. Apparently some Excom rep
resentatives do not realize that over 20 per cent of the
men in the student body live in the Village. It is not
ihe same, as one of the three seemed to think as if the
ballot box at History Corner failed to open as scheduled.
Voting is, to a great extent, a matter of convenience
(as the low vote in this election and other campus elec
tions would indicate.) I have no doubt that the politi
cally-conscious Swigart, Hoff, and Kea would be sure
to vote in any election—even if the only voting booth
were located in San Francisco. Nevertheless, most Stan
ford students will not go out of their way to cast a vote
in an election.
The Stanford Village is technically a part, of the cam
pus. One would think that its voters (and there are a
lot of them) would have the same privileges in an elec
tion as ordinary campus students. Yet the voting booth
was not open from 8:00 to as other campus boot lis
were.
Villagers are no! complaining about living condi
tions, etc., but they have cause to be enraged when they
are, in effect, denied th; j right to vote. The average per
son may go to campus once or twice a day. If the voting
line is long lie will not vote.
Thii; situation cannot be compared wilh the student
living at Encina, who is within a short, walk of the polls
at all times. The placing of the voting booths may be
a very important factor in the final result of any elec
tion. I am not inferring that this election was handled
in such a manner. Cliff Carlsen, election chairman, and
his : übordinates were not intentionally responsible for
the mistake.
But I do think that all members of Excom should be
able to see the injustice of the situation. I personally
talked to four Villagers who told me they had been
unable to vote because they had planned on voting in
the Village. Jerry Hill, Village Excom representative,
said that at least f>o did not vote who would have, had
the polls been opened as promised in The Daily. The 40
votes cast in the "second election" would seem to bear
this out. So, in effect, *1(5 Villagers were denied their
vote.
I am not criticizing the election itself, though it was
obviously mishandled. But I am somewhat annoyed
when someone attempts to pass the situation off as "just
one of tho.se unfortunate things," as Messrs. Swigai t,
Hoff, and Kea attempted to do. I would like to con
gratulate Hank Rosin for his attempt to rectify the
error, whether the action, was constitutional or uncon
stitutional. He could not foresee the inevitable conse
quences of a ".second election." Let us hope in future
every student, wi'l be able to cast his vote without un
due effort. A few additional voting booths throughout
the campus vvill remedy the situation.

(Kditor's Note.—Mr. Swigart, a former Village resi
dent, appreciates Ihe situation which (he Council can
didate from the Village describes. lie is not a pro- 1
ponent «>f "Village Discrimination," and it is unfor
tunate that his n marks, designed to clarify the Con
stitutional situation, were interpreted in this light.)
