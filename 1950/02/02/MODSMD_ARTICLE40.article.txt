It's funny, sometimes, how a seemingly simple thing as athletic awards
can turn out to be such a complicated subject, with so many angles shooting
off in the most surprising directions. And I doubt il anybody knew what a
huge task quarter-miler Larry Hofi was taking on when Excom appointed
him to head a committee to investigate the lairness and the practicability
of the present Stanford system of awards.
One of the first things Chairman Hoff did was to go out and hire a flock ol
able assistants—which include lettermen Ralph Sala, Fred Ten Eyck. Ralph
Davidson, Jess Cone, and a couple of etes. These men have spent the last
couple of weeks interviewing coaches, SAC officials, and athletes on the j
subject of whether or not they thought awards (Block S, Circle S) were
being awarded in the best manner, it not, are there any better suggestions! ;
The investigation has brought to the fore a batch oi interesting ideas
on which the Ilofl Committee will have to do a lot of rehashing before
turning in their final report next week. One good question is whether or
not the "time played in the game" system that Stanford now uses is better
than the system used at some schools —like Michigan—where the letter
award is based entirely upon the coach's recommendation.
The further the Committee has delved into the situation, the more side
line questions pop up. What about this major sport business There are j
strong opinions on campus—not necessarily within the Hoff Committee —to
go back to a four major sports system. This would effectively "ace" the
Indians' yry capable tennis and golf players. Frankly, there is little danger
of this idea going through, or even being considered. Quite the contrary,
there is another faction that is strongly pushing an all-major sport system,
such as Michigan and Minnesota have.
This plan would give a Block o award to any and all sports which have a
satisfactory schedule, and are recognized by the Athletic Department—both
{•tnerally and financially. The plan, too, obviously has boo-coo pros and
cons. And it is, as 1 hasten to point out, not the major function of the com
mittee to look into. Just an interesting sidelight.
Probably the most controversial subject is the (id angle of to BAC or
not toJtAC. But the lecture on that comes later. It will be definitely de
cided one way or another this month when Dr. Sterling gives his con
sidered opinion.
Too many campus observers feel that this system will be a cure-all for !
Athletic Ills. It won't be anything as grand as that. In fact, it will bring up ,
a bucketfull of new difficulties. But a BAC—should the Administration
decide to adopt it—will go a long, long way toward solving the ills (par
ticularly financial) that have plagued the athletic plant since the war's end.
All oj which is strictly sideline stuff as far as the Hoff Committee is con
cerned.-The committee is studying conditions with an eye toward revising
the entire athletic code, and it is hitting these little sidelines along the way.
I don't, know whether the Hoffmen will actually accomplish anything—l
kinda think they will. But whether they do or not, they are causing a lot
of people to do some thinking about the system. All of which is a pretty
healthjqjjthing to have happen.

couple of weeks interviewing coaches, SAC officials, and athletes on the j
subject of whether or not they thought awards (Block S, Circle S) were
being awarded in the best manner, it not, are there any better suggestions! ;
The investigation has brought to the fore a batch oi interesting ideas
on which the Ilofl Committee will have to do a lot of rehashing before
turning in their final report next week. One good question is whether or
not the "time played in the game" system that Stanford now uses is better
than the system used at some schools —like Michigan—where the letter
award is based entirely upon the coach's recommendation.
The further the Committee has delved into the situation, the more side
line questions pop up. What about this major sport business There are j
strong opinions on campus—not necessarily within the Hoff Committee —to
go back to a four major sports system. This would effectively "ace" the
Indians' yry capable tennis and golf players. Frankly, there is little danger
of this idea going through, or even being considered. Quite the contrary,
there is another faction that is strongly pushing an all-major sport system,
such as Michigan and Minnesota have.
This plan would give a Block o award to any and all sports which have a
satisfactory schedule, and are recognized by the Athletic Department—both
{•tnerally and financially. The plan, too, obviously has boo-coo pros and
cons. And it is, as 1 hasten to point out, not the major function of the com
mittee to look into. Just an interesting sidelight.
Probably the most controversial subject is the (id angle of to BAC or
not toJtAC. But the lecture on that comes later. It will be definitely de
cided one way or another this month when Dr. Sterling gives his con
sidered opinion.
Too many campus observers feel that this system will be a cure-all for !
Athletic Ills. It won't be anything as grand as that. In fact, it will bring up ,
a bucketfull of new difficulties. But a BAC—should the Administration
decide to adopt it—will go a long, long way toward solving the ills (par
ticularly financial) that have plagued the athletic plant since the war's end.
All oj which is strictly sideline stuff as far as the Hoff Committee is con
cerned.-The committee is studying conditions with an eye toward revising
the entire athletic code, and it is hitting these little sidelines along the way.
I don't, know whether the Hoffmen will actually accomplish anything—l
kinda think they will. But whether they do or not, they are causing a lot
of people to do some thinking about the system. All of which is a pretty
healthjqjjthing to have happen.
