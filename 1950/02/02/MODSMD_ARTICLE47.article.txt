Big Lead
The frosh took an immediate lead,

have a field day at the expense of
j the outclassed Farmers.
j Goach Burnett alternated his reg
j ulars and reserves for the rest of
j the game, and there was little oppo
| sition until the closing minutes
! when the visitors yearly overcame a
j 15 - point deficit and approached
I within six points of the frosh.
Forward Wade MeClusky found
1 his eye on several fine push shots
and credited his team with 10
! points. The hard - playing pair of
guards, Fritz Fenster and George
Zaninovich, set in 8 and t> counters
j respectively.
For the losers center Jim Ogelvie
was high with 14 points. Bud Coon
| came next with 9, and Rudy Bar
mettler and Jes Duran landed 8
apiece.
