# Nash Shows New Economy Car; Mar Be Sold For Under $1,000
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Does America want an economy
car—to be sold for less than $1,000?
That's what Nash Motors has been
trying to find out in a recent series
of sample showings in six cities—
New York. Washington, Detroit,
Chicago, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco,
Two reporters from The Stanford
Daily were present at the Fairmont
Hotel last week to witness the San
Francisco uncovering. If reaction to
the $1,000 car is favorable, and if
Nash becomes convinced that there
will be a sufficient market for the
car, production will begin in the
very near future.
Several Models
Temporarily called NXI (Nash,
experimental, and international),
the car being shown is a small two
passenger two-door convertible. It
can a!so be built as a sports road
ster, or as a two - door all-steel
coupe. It is designed to use foreign
made low-horsepower engines.
The NXI is 12 feet 1 inch long,
4 feet 5 inches high, and 5 feet 2
inches wide, with an 84-inch wheel
base. It's slightly larger than the
English Austin.
The car has decided limitations,
but it also has a few advantages. It
is powered now with a four-cylin
der 18 - horsepower Italian engine,
and is supposed to deliver 45 to 50
miles a gallon. It weighs 1,350
pounds.
Alternate engines discussed in
clude a Fiat of 36 horsepower which

would deliver 35 to 40 miles a gal
lon, and an English-built Standard
of 36 horsepower with a three-speed
transmission. (The other engines
have four-speed transmissions.)
Exterior Design
Conventional exterior design has
been simplified in several ways.
Front grill and bumper are com
bined into a single unit. Excess
chrome has been eliminated. Engine
hood, front fenders, and lights are

combined in one assembly which
may be raised for engine or front
end service. The trunk lid has also
been eliminated. This has created
one of the important limitations,
that of very little storage space.
The car has leg room equal to the
average in full-size American cars.
It seems right now as if the only
market for the car would be in
families who were interested in a
"second" car. It is very good for
transportation 011 an economic basis,
but short on comfort.
Otherwise, it looks like just an
other novelty job, strictly for those
who crave something different. If
Nash decides to build the car, it
will be introduced as an addition to
its regular Ambassador and States
man lines.
