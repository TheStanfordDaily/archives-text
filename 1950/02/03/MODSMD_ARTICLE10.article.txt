# Stanford Scientists Announce Recent Discoveries on Cancer
## Findings on Chemical Composition of Cells May Provide Clue to the Secret of Cancer 
### 
Biochemists at Stanford have
turned up new clues which may
help crack the secret of cancer.
Their painstaking work with can
cerous liver cells — as methodical
and relentless as that of a Scotland
Yard detective on the trail of a
killer—is providing answers to these
questions about cancer:
What happens chemically in the
normal cell when it becomes cancer
ous?
Does the same thing happen in
every cell which becomes cancer
ous, or do changes which take place
vary?
In their research the biochemists
have found that nucleoproteins,
building blocks of life which make
up such vital parts of the cell as
chromosomes, change in make-up
and quantity when the cell becomes
cancerous.
Vitamin IJ Decrease
They have also found that other
elements in the cell are altered and
that one of the biggest changes is a
decrease in Vitamin 8,.
This disturbance in the chemical
composition and behavior of the cell
is a clue the Stanford biochemists
hope will eventually lead them to
the basic cause of cancer.
The patient and methodical study
is "being conducted by a team of
chemists working with Dr. A. Clark
Griffin, a young scientist who has
made the study of cancer his life
work.
For nearly three years Dr. Grif

/in ;ii)d his team members have been
studying the chemical composition
of normal cells, cells just becoming
cancerous, and tumor cells.
Dcsoxyrihonueleoprotcin
They have discovered that when
white rats arc fed diets containing
an azo dye, a compound which pro
duces cancer of the liver, these
marked changes in the chemical
composition of the cell take place:
There is an increase in the
amount of desoxyribonucleoprotein
(abbreviated to DNP), a jiucleopro
tein important in the growth and
organization of the cell. At the same
time, there is a decrease in ribofla
vin, better known as Vitamin B„.
These discoveries were made by
freezing the liver cells taken from
the rats and separating their com
ponents through use of a high-speed
centrifuge capable of spinning the
material as fast as GO,OOO revolutions
per minute.
Special techniques were then used
to measure amounts of various sub
stances in the cell separated by the
tremendous force of the centrifuge.
May Cause Cancer
Significantly, the same high con
tent of DNP and low content of
riboflavin which was found in the
cells just before cancer developed
was also found in tumors which
followed.
This leads the biochemists to be
lieve that changes in amounts of
DNP and Vitamin B, may in some
cases cause cancer cells to develop
from normal cells.
The scientists are now using ra
dioactive tracer methods to find
where and at what rate the nuclco
protcins are formed in order to ex
plain why such vital components as
DNP and riboflavin change as can
cer develops.
They have already noted that
when rats arc feci riboflavin, the
effect of the cancer-producing azo
dye is lessened to some extent, and
they are at work searching for an
explanation of this, an explanation
which may well prove important in
cancer prevention.
I.iver Cancer
For the scientists are aware that
liver cancer is much more prevalent
in parts of such countries as India
where (.'iels arc low in Vitamin B.
content than it is in the United
States where diets generally con
lain suflieicnl amounts of the vita
min.
The question of whether the
change in components in the can
cerous cells varies or is always the
same lias been answered by the
chemists through research they
have conducted with another can
cer-producing agent.
This is acetylaminofluorene which


DR. CLARK GRIFFIN (left) loads a container with test tubes of
liver tissue which Dr. Lew Cunningham will place in a vacuum
sealed chamber in the background. There the tubes will be spun
at the rate of 60,000 revolutions per minute, separating the com
ponent parts of the liver tissue.

check a fractionating apparatus in the team's laboratory in the basement of the Chemistry Build
ing. The fractionater measures the protein content in animal tissue and has helped the scientists
v/ith important clues to the cause of cancer.
