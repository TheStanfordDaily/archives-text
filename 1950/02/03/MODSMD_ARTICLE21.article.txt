# Card Cage Crew Hits Cow Palace Tonight For Moragan Scramble
## Thurston Top Gael Scorer 
### JOHN HALL 
Everett Dean's bounce boys,
hot on the comeback trail, will
run into the depressing but im
proving St. Mary's Gaels tonight
at 9:15 in still another Cow Pal
ace double-header.
An evening opener between San
Jose State and Bowling Green (with
six-foot 11-inch Charlie Share) is
scheduled for a 7:45 tip. Tickets for
both games will sell to students for
50 cents.
The Indians will be shooting for
the ninth win of the season as they
attempt to climb back over the .500
mark for the first time since tacking
up a win over Texas A&M in late
December.
From outward appearances, the
Gaels shape up as a soft touch. Ben
ny Neff's brigade has managed only
three victories in 15 starts, and has
dropped nine straight Cow Palace
tiffs.
Kudelka Gone
But, Everett Dean doesn't see it
that easy. He stated yesterday that
he feared a real battle from St.
Mary's, adding that "They just lost
a close one to USC and will cer
tainly be pointing for Stanford."
Gone from the Moraga fold this
year is Frank Apples Kudelka, an
all-time Gael great who pushed St.
Mary's within five points of Stan
ford last season in a 64 to 59 Cow
Palace thriller.
But without their Apples every
day, the Gaels got off to a sick start,
and it has taken Dr. Neff half a sea
son to get them back on their feed.
Lately, the Gaels have begun to
gallop again. Last week they kicked
USC all around the Cow Palace be
fore becoming another victim of the
two-minute foul rule, and dropping
the duke, 46 to 41. Finally, they
notched their tWd victory of the
season against Fresno State, 51 to 44,
last Tuesday night.
Thurston Returns
Center Joe Thurston (6-3) and for
ward Augie Bullwinkel (6-0) are the
leading Gael scoring threats, Thur
ston being a runner-up to Kudelka
last season with an average of 10.J
per contest.
Also handy around the hoop arc
Bob Steinkamp (6-2) and Len Dixon
(6-0), both juniors and returning
lettermen. Two-year vet Bob Hag
ler (6-0) usually rounds out the
starting quintet. It can Ue noted that
the Gaels are pretty tiny, what with
Thurston being the only regular to
shade six fee*.
Probably the most colorful figure
in the St. Mary's cage picture is their
coach, Benny Neff, who has been with
the Gaels for three years now.
A terror with the whip in the
sweat-and-swear class of teachers,


BENNY NEFF has been mentor
ing the St. Mary's cage squad for
three years, and previously had
coached for 20 years at Lowell
High in San Francisco. Neff, as
Gael leader, has yet to whip a
Stanford five.
