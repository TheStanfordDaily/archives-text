# Card Cage Crew Hits Cow Palace Tonight For Moragan Scramble
## Thurston Top Gael Scorer 
### JOHN HALL 
Everett Dean's bounce boys,
hot on the comeback trail, will
run into the depressing but im
proving St. Mary's Gaels tonight
at 9:15 in still another Cow Pal
ace double-header.
An evening opener between San
Jose State and Bowling Green (with
six-foot 11-inch Charlie Share) is
scheduled for a 7:45 tip. Tickets for
both games will sell to students for
50 cents.
The Indians will be shooting for
the ninth win of the season as they
attempt to climb back over the .500
mark for the first time since tacking
up a win over Texas A&M in late
December.
From outward appearances, the
Gaels shape up as a soft touch. Ben
ny Neff's brigade has managed only
three victories in 15 starts, and has
dropped nine straight Cow Palace
tiffs.
Kudelka Gone
But, Everett Dean doesn't see it
that easy. He stated yesterday that
he feared a real battle from St.
Mary's, adding that "They just lost
a close one to USC and will cer
tainly be pointing for Stanford."
Gone from the Moraga fold this
year is Frank Apples Kudelka, an
all-time Gael great who pushed St.
Mary's within five points of Stan
ford last season in a 64 to 59 Cow
Palace thriller.
But without their Apples every
day, the Gaels got off to a sick start,
and it has taken Dr. Neff half a sea
son to get them back on their feed.
Lately, the Gaels have begun to
gallop again. Last week they kicked
USC all around the Cow Palace be
fore becoming another victim of the
two-minute foul rule, and dropping
the duke, 46 to 41. Finally, they
notched their tWd victory of the
season against Fresno State, 51 to 44,
last Tuesday night.
Thurston Returns
Center Joe Thurston (6-3) and for
ward Augie Bullwinkel (6-0) are the
leading Gael scoring threats, Thur
ston being a runner-up to Kudelka
last season with an average of 10.J
per contest.
Also handy around the hoop arc
Bob Steinkamp (6-2) and Len Dixon
(6-0), both juniors and returning
lettermen. Two-year vet Bob Hag
ler (6-0) usually rounds out the
starting quintet. It can Ue noted that
the Gaels are pretty tiny, what with
Thurston being the only regular to
shade six fee*.
Probably the most colorful figure
in the St. Mary's cage picture is their
coach, Benny Neff, who has been with
the Gaels for three years now.
A terror with the whip in the
sweat-and-swear class of teachers,


BENNY NEFF has been mentor
ing the St. Mary's cage squad for
three years, and previously had
coached for 20 years at Lowell
High in San Francisco. Neff, as
Gael leader, has yet to whip a
Stanford five.
Benny has also been around the San
Francisco prep circles for 20 years as
heedman at Lowell Hia;h. As such he
is a familiar figure to present and
past Stanford patrons of the game.
Developed Card Stars
He helped develop three of the 1942

National Champs—Don Burness, Bill
Cowden, and Howie Dallmar. He also
has two pupils on the present Card
frosh Fritz Fensterand Bill Steven
son.
If Stanford can put St. Mary's to
sleep tonight, it will mark the first
time this year that Stanlord has been
able to rack up three consecutive
wins.
Bomber George Yardley continues
to pace the Indian scoring attack.
His 12 markers against the Olympic
Club Wednesday night pushed his
total to 236 for 10 games, (14.7 per).
The Cards came out of the Olympic

Club encounter in fine shape, al
though nobody was too pleased with
their performance. Only during one
short burst during the second half
did Stanford look like a basketball
team.
Rescvves Shine
Everett Dean will stick by his
same starters tonight, with Jim Ram
stead, Gus Chavalas, and Harry Hu
gasian slated to see early action.
These three turned an 18 to 18 tie
into a 28 to 22 lead against the Olym
pic Club.
Two years ago, Chavalas person
ally accounted for a win over St.
Mary's, when with the second hand
oil its finhl fide around* the Cow
Palace clock, he swished a 45-foot
push shot to make it 49 to 47 and
the ballgame.
Student support was at a low ebb
against the Olympic Club. "Worst
I'd ever seen," was the casual way
Bob Burnett put it yesterday. "Too
bad they had to charge money."
Only a handful of Card rooters had
turned up to witness the Wednesday
night contest, and the contest took on
the aspects of of more of an after
noon intersquad scrimmage than an
actual scheduled game.


LEN DIXON will open at guard
against the Cardinals tonight in
the feature Cow Palace tilt. Dix
on is a junior at Moraga, stands
an even six feot, and is a two-year
h'tterman.

hot on the comeback trail, will
run into the depressing but im
proving St. Mary's Gaels tonight
at 9:15 in still another Cow Pal
ace double-header.
An evening opener between San
Jose State and Bowling Green (with
six-foot 11-inch Charlie Share) is
scheduled for a 7:45 tip. Tickets for
both games will sell to students for
50 cents.
The Indians will be shooting for
the ninth win of the season as they
attempt to climb back over the .500
mark for the first time since tacking
up a win over Texas A&M in late
December.
From outward appearances, the
Gaels shape up as a soft touch. Ben
ny Neff's brigade has managed only
three victories in 15 starts, and has
dropped nine straight Cow Palace
tiffs.
Kudelka Gone
But, Everett Dean doesn't see it
that easy. He stated yesterday that
he feared a real battle from St.
Mary's, adding that "They just lost
a close one to USC and will cer
tainly be pointing for Stanford."
Gone from the Moraga fold this
year is Frank Apples Kudelka, an
all-time Gael great who pushed St.
Mary's within five points of Stan
ford last season in a 64 to 59 Cow
Palace thriller.
But without their Apples every
day, the Gaels got off to a sick start,
and it has taken Dr. Neff half a sea
son to get them back on their feed.
Lately, the Gaels have begun to
gallop again. Last week they kicked
USC all around the Cow Palace be
fore becoming another victim of the
two-minute foul rule, and dropping
the duke, 46 to 41. Finally, they
notched their tWd victory of the
season against Fresno State, 51 to 44,
last Tuesday night.
Thurston Returns
Center Joe Thurston (6-3) and for
ward Augie Bullwinkel (6-0) are the
leading Gael scoring threats, Thur
ston being a runner-up to Kudelka
last season with an average of 10.J
per contest.
Also handy around the hoop arc
Bob Steinkamp (6-2) and Len Dixon
(6-0), both juniors and returning
lettermen. Two-year vet Bob Hag
ler (6-0) usually rounds out the
starting quintet. It can Ue noted that
the Gaels are pretty tiny, what with
Thurston being the only regular to
shade six fee*.
Probably the most colorful figure
in the St. Mary's cage picture is their
coach, Benny Neff, who has been with
the Gaels for three years now.
A terror with the whip in the
sweat-and-swear class of teachers,


BENNY NEFF has been mentor
ing the St. Mary's cage squad for
three years, and previously had
coached for 20 years at Lowell
High in San Francisco. Neff, as
Gael leader, has yet to whip a
Stanford five.
Benny has also been around the San
Francisco prep circles for 20 years as
heedman at Lowell Hia;h. As such he
is a familiar figure to present and
past Stanford patrons of the game.
Developed Card Stars
He helped develop three of the 1942

National Champs—Don Burness, Bill
Cowden, and Howie Dallmar. He also
has two pupils on the present Card
frosh Fritz Fensterand Bill Steven
son.
If Stanford can put St. Mary's to
sleep tonight, it will mark the first
time this year that Stanlord has been
able to rack up three consecutive
wins.
Bomber George Yardley continues
to pace the Indian scoring attack.
His 12 markers against the Olympic
Club Wednesday night pushed his
total to 236 for 10 games, (14.7 per).
The Cards came out of the Olympic

Club encounter in fine shape, al
though nobody was too pleased with
their performance. Only during one
short burst during the second half
did Stanford look like a basketball
team.
Rescvves Shine
Everett Dean will stick by his
same starters tonight, with Jim Ram
stead, Gus Chavalas, and Harry Hu
gasian slated to see early action.
These three turned an 18 to 18 tie
into a 28 to 22 lead against the Olym
pic Club.
Two years ago, Chavalas person
ally accounted for a win over St.
Mary's, when with the second hand
oil its finhl fide around* the Cow
Palace clock, he swished a 45-foot
push shot to make it 49 to 47 and
the ballgame.
Student support was at a low ebb
against the Olympic Club. "Worst
I'd ever seen," was the casual way
Bob Burnett put it yesterday. "Too
bad they had to charge money."
Only a handful of Card rooters had
turned up to witness the Wednesday
night contest, and the contest took on
the aspects of of more of an after
noon intersquad scrimmage than an
actual scheduled game.


LEN DIXON will open at guard
against the Cardinals tonight in
the feature Cow Palace tilt. Dix
on is a junior at Moraga, stands
an even six feot, and is a two-year
h'tterman.

starting quintet. It can Ue noted that
the Gaels are pretty tiny, what with
Thurston being the only regular to
shade six fee*.
Probably the most colorful figure
in the St. Mary's cage picture is their
coach, Benny Neff, who has been with
the Gaels for three years now.
A terror with the whip in the
sweat-and-swear class of teachers,


BENNY NEFF has been mentor
ing the St. Mary's cage squad for
three years, and previously had
coached for 20 years at Lowell
High in San Francisco. Neff, as
Gael leader, has yet to whip a
Stanford five.
Benny has also been around the San
Francisco prep circles for 20 years as
heedman at Lowell Hia;h. As such he
is a familiar figure to present and
past Stanford patrons of the game.
Developed Card Stars
He helped develop three of the 1942

National Champs—Don Burness, Bill
Cowden, and Howie Dallmar. He also
has two pupils on the present Card
frosh Fritz Fensterand Bill Steven
son.
If Stanford can put St. Mary's to
sleep tonight, it will mark the first
time this year that Stanlord has been
able to rack up three consecutive
wins.
Bomber George Yardley continues
to pace the Indian scoring attack.
His 12 markers against the Olympic
Club Wednesday night pushed his
total to 236 for 10 games, (14.7 per).
The Cards came out of the Olympic

Club encounter in fine shape, al
though nobody was too pleased with
their performance. Only during one
short burst during the second half
did Stanford look like a basketball
team.
Rescvves Shine
Everett Dean will stick by his
same starters tonight, with Jim Ram
stead, Gus Chavalas, and Harry Hu
gasian slated to see early action.
These three turned an 18 to 18 tie
into a 28 to 22 lead against the Olym
pic Club.
Two years ago, Chavalas person
ally accounted for a win over St.
Mary's, when with the second hand
oil its finhl fide around* the Cow
Palace clock, he swished a 45-foot
push shot to make it 49 to 47 and
the ballgame.
Student support was at a low ebb
against the Olympic Club. "Worst
I'd ever seen," was the casual way
Bob Burnett put it yesterday. "Too
bad they had to charge money."
Only a handful of Card rooters had
turned up to witness the Wednesday
night contest, and the contest took on
the aspects of of more of an after
noon intersquad scrimmage than an
actual scheduled game.


LEN DIXON will open at guard
against the Cardinals tonight in
the feature Cow Palace tilt. Dix
on is a junior at Moraga, stands
an even six feot, and is a two-year
h'tterman.

Francisco prep circles for 20 years as

Everett Dean's bounce boys,
hot on the comeback trail, will
run into the depressing but im
proving St. Mary's Gaels tonight
at 9:15 in still another Cow Pal
ace double-header.
An evening opener between San
Jose State and Bowling Green (with
six-foot 11-inch Charlie Share) is
scheduled for a 7:45 tip. Tickets for
both games will sell to students for
50 cents.
The Indians will be shooting for
the ninth win of the season as they
attempt to climb back over the .500
mark for the first time since tacking
up a win over Texas A&M in late
December.
From outward appearances, the
Gaels shape up as a soft touch. Ben
ny Neff's brigade has managed only
three victories in 15 starts, and has
dropped nine straight Cow Palace
tiffs.
Kudelka Gone
But, Everett Dean doesn't see it
that easy. He stated yesterday that
he feared a real battle from St.
Mary's, adding that "They just lost
a close one to USC and will cer
tainly be pointing for Stanford."
Gone from the Moraga fold this
year is Frank Apples Kudelka, an
all-time Gael great who pushed St.
Mary's within five points of Stan
ford last season in a 64 to 59 Cow
Palace thriller.
But without their Apples every
day, the Gaels got off to a sick start,
and it has taken Dr. Neff half a sea
son to get them back on their feed.
Lately, the Gaels have begun to
gallop again. Last week they kicked
USC all around the Cow Palace be
fore becoming another victim of the
two-minute foul rule, and dropping
the duke, 46 to 41. Finally, they
notched their tWd victory of the
season against Fresno State, 51 to 44,
last Tuesday night.
Thurston Returns
Center Joe Thurston (6-3) and for
ward Augie Bullwinkel (6-0) are the
leading Gael scoring threats, Thur
ston being a runner-up to Kudelka
last season with an average of 10.J
per contest.
Also handy around the hoop arc
Bob Steinkamp (6-2) and Len Dixon
(6-0), both juniors and returning
lettermen. Two-year vet Bob Hag
ler (6-0) usually rounds out the
starting quintet. It can Ue noted that
