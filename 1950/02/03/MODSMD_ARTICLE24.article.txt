# The 						Ink Runs Dry

### 
DEAR JACK:
Tor decades it has been a custom that The
Daily Editor spend his last few minutes, alone
in this dusty office, seated before a typewriter,
pounding out a nostalgic, tear-jerking, "fare
well but not good bye," final editorial.
Most editors have condemned these frothy
gushes as a horrible habit, as an insult to the
time and patience of their readers, but have
then proceeded to write one anyway.
These pieces have touched on the rolling
foothills, the sun shinqing down on the Quad,
the happiest years of one's life, and the prob
lems that face Stanford students l>oth now and
in Ihe future. There have been utterances of
warning, and words of advice. The venerable
old green-topped editor's de;»k and the tricky
swivel chair in which you will soon be seated
have come in for their share ol attention, too,
us the sands of time ran out on more than one
volume of The Stanford Daily.
After all these years the desk and the swivel
chair are still with us and so are farewell edi
torials. It's a disease. Jack. I've got it now. four
r.nd a half months lrom now and you'll have it,
too. In the meantime, make the most oi every
minute that you have in this position of honor,
hard work, and heavy responsibility.
The best advice I can give you is to be fair.
Always be fair. In all your writing, never al
low youiself to become embittered aqain3t per
son or action. There are two sides to every ques
tion. Find out about both of them before you

act. Ignorance oi the other fellow's side of the
case will not excuse you. You'll be much hap
pier for having stood for that which proved to
be right.
As editor you will listen to a seemingly end
less string of requests for publicity from organ
izations both on and off campus. The column
space that you will have at your disposal will
be limited, the demands upon it will not.
Therefore, in allotinq space, you will find it
necessary to distinguish between the indi
vidual and the general welfare. The activities
which interest or alfect the greatest number of
students must always come first.
You are fortunate in the ability and energy
of the staff that will serve you. The kids who
pound the beats and write the headlines are
the real backbone of the paper. They're a great
bunch. Jack —worthy of your full confidence.
Just one more word and we part. February to
June is not a very long time. Enjoy every mo
ment of it yourself and work hard to make each
day's paper the best possible for the campus to
enjoy, ft's going to be a lot of work, a lot of
grief, and a lot of fun. And about the time you
begin to realize that you're the editor, it will
be all over.
So, as the ink begins to run dry, it's farewell
from a guy who is tonight finding out the true
meaning oJ the word "ex."
The best of luck to you and your volume.
Jade,
Sincerely,
BILL
