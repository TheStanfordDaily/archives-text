### JOHN HALL 
'The touchy Honor Code Committee probably won't
go for it, but I've just got to pass on to you this
morning a short story about a recent discovery of an
entirely new method in the fraudulent of cheating.

It will undoubtedly put. such
ancient habits as writing on fin
gernails and shirt-tails, cribbing
notes in the cord cuffs and knit
ting bags, and the smoking of
cigarettes which say more than
Chesterfield on the pack, as far
back in time as the' Hydrogen
Eomb has the Atom Bomb.
This modernized crookedness
was uncovered in Italy by a Pro
fessor Giuliu Pedinini, who turned
in a better sleuthing stint than
my old favorite Phil Marlowe.

At first, school officials had been baffled L>y the fact
that two students who took Latin exams on different
floors of a school tlirned in test papers identical even
in punctuation.
By nature of the exam, Professor Pedinini realized
that somewhere along the line, somebody hadn't been
playing it like Joe Palooka, but he hud no proof.
So, he called in the owners of the papers in ques
tion. One student took his exam with his head
v;rapped in bandages and the other with a east on
his left arm.

The cast concealed a walkie-talkie transmitter and
the head bandages a walkie-talkie receiver.
So much for scientific advancements, let's turn to
the mailbag.
Cleaning out the files, I find a note from Priscilla
Feigen concerning last week's Overcoat Detective
essay. Besides pointing out a couple of mistakes (It's
Joe Friday, not Joe Frisco), she gives me the word
on the disappearance of Pat Novak. It seems that
"when Patsey's script writer was lured to Hollywood,
Pat went along."
Priscilla also wanted to nominate Rocky Jordan, as
did another author of na unsigned postcard, for a spot
on the list of top 10.
All of which fine with me. Let's move off Christo
pher London (he was about as dynamic last Sunday
as a Roble lunch) and move in Rocky.
One more letter in the drawer, authored by Bill
Bodirsky, tells me that Carlun's beer bar is open again
after a short tiff with the B of E. Seems a minor
switched credentials on Emil with the result that
the bar was closed from January 9 to January 2'A.
Everything's fine now, however.
That just about makes us even as of today, so I'm
Koing to hurry over to get a loge seat in the reserved
book room. They tell me midterms are about to start.
Oh yeah, this is the last sheet of Volume 11G. But
don't worry, We'll start all over again next week.

Koing to hurry over to get a loge seat in the reserved
book room. They tell me midterms are about to start.
Oh yeah, this is the last sheet of Volume 11G. But
don't worry, We'll start all over again next week.

'The touchy Honor Code Committee probably won't
go for it, but I've just got to pass on to you this
morning a short story about a recent discovery of an
entirely new method in the fraudulent of cheating.

It will undoubtedly put. such
ancient habits as writing on fin
gernails and shirt-tails, cribbing
notes in the cord cuffs and knit
ting bags, and the smoking of
cigarettes which say more than
Chesterfield on the pack, as far
back in time as the' Hydrogen
Eomb has the Atom Bomb.
This modernized crookedness
was uncovered in Italy by a Pro
fessor Giuliu Pedinini, who turned
in a better sleuthing stint than
my old favorite Phil Marlowe.

At first, school officials had been baffled L>y the fact
that two students who took Latin exams on different
floors of a school tlirned in test papers identical even
in punctuation.
By nature of the exam, Professor Pedinini realized
that somewhere along the line, somebody hadn't been
playing it like Joe Palooka, but he hud no proof.
So, he called in the owners of the papers in ques
tion. One student took his exam with his head
v;rapped in bandages and the other with a east on
his left arm.

The cast concealed a walkie-talkie transmitter and
the head bandages a walkie-talkie receiver.
So much for scientific advancements, let's turn to
the mailbag.
Cleaning out the files, I find a note from Priscilla
Feigen concerning last week's Overcoat Detective
essay. Besides pointing out a couple of mistakes (It's
Joe Friday, not Joe Frisco), she gives me the word
on the disappearance of Pat Novak. It seems that
"when Patsey's script writer was lured to Hollywood,
Pat went along."
Priscilla also wanted to nominate Rocky Jordan, as
did another author of na unsigned postcard, for a spot
on the list of top 10.
All of which fine with me. Let's move off Christo
pher London (he was about as dynamic last Sunday
as a Roble lunch) and move in Rocky.
One more letter in the drawer, authored by Bill
Bodirsky, tells me that Carlun's beer bar is open again
after a short tiff with the B of E. Seems a minor
switched credentials on Emil with the result that
the bar was closed from January 9 to January 2'A.
Everything's fine now, however.
That just about makes us even as of today, so I'm
Koing to hurry over to get a loge seat in the reserved
book room. They tell me midterms are about to start.
