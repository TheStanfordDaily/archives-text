Mr. Davis* LclUm*

To the Editor:
Mr. Robert Pavis' letter in The Daily is another in
stance of his continual tight opposing world govern
ment. 1 certainly respect Mr. Davis for his terrific
energy; 1 only regret that so much of his efforts are
destructive and not constructive. In his zeal, however,
I believe that he has obscured (he meaning of the im
pressive array of factual material he has presented.
A resolution was recently passed by tie- California
legislature asking Congress to call a constitutional
Convention for the purpose of drafting an amendment
to our Constitution to enable and facilitate American
participation in world government. Mr. Davis claims
that it was Artie Samish's influence which was respon
sible for this action. If by this he means Artie's nega
tive influence, perhaps he is correct. For State Senator
Hatfield, known as a "close associate" of Mr. Samish,
was one of the most avid opponent:, of the resolution.
This political fact is uncontradictable despite any "pho
tostatic evidence."
The fact that there are small numbers of members of
the United World Federalists in some states proves
nothing beyond that fact. It might indicate weak
nes t-: in organizational techniques of that organization,
but it is certainly no indication of the support for the
idea of world government. In the State of Utah, one of
the states cited for low membership in UWF, a resolu
tion supporting federation was passed by the state legis
lature, and the public educational system was directed
to include instruction on world federation in the schools.
Public opinion polls have consistently Indicated that a
majority of the people in the United States favor world
government, and this tabulation, unlike others made by
1 lie pollsters, has been borne out at the ballot box. In
Connecticut, for example, a referendum found the
people voting nine to one in support of world federation.
Mr. Davis pointed out in his letter, as he did at Mr.
Weigel's speech, that Georgia had retracted its earlier
endorsement of world government. Ft seems to me that
Mr. Weigel's comment was adequate explanation. He
ud. "I am glad to hear that Merman Talmadge is op
posed to world government; it makes rue doubly sure
it is a worthwhile goal."
'J he Progressive and Liberal parties, Mr Davis stated,
have supported federation. He neglected to mention
that political support has also come lioin Mr Truman
and Mr. Taft Closer to home the California Demo
i itic and Republican parties have both put themselves
on record as favoring strengthening the United Nations
so that it is capable of enforcing world law.
Mi Davit, in mentioning seveial of the lew organiza
tions opposed to world government forgot to mention

some of tlie more vociferous ones ore The Ameri
can Society of the Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, the Communist Party, and (please don't ever for
get these valiant souls) the National Society Women
Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company. He neglected to mention the impressive list
of organizations, representing over 17,000,000 people,
who have supported federation. These include: The
American Veterans Committee, American Veterans of
World War 11, Americans for Democratic Action,
Friends Committee on National Legislation, General
Federation of Women's Clubs, KiwanLs International,
National Grange, U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce,
and the Young Republican National Federation.
The fact that only 100,000 people in the world have
paid dues to the World Movement for World Federal
Givernment is cited as evidence for the weakness of
the idea in other countries. The actual extent of support
for world federation is shown by the fact that the con
stitutions of Italy, France, and Western Germany have
incorporated provisions for joining a world government,
that 180 members drawn for all parties in the Japanese
Diet, except the Communists, have formed the Parlia
mentary Group for World Government, that both Mr.
Churchill and Mr. Bevin and the parties they represent
in England support the concept, that in the town of
Haarlem, Netherlands (160,000 inhabitants), 40,000
votes were cast on the question of world governmentâ€”
95 per cent of them in favor, that the Indian Socialist
Party's recently-adopted foreign policy statement de
clares that, the party stands for "the ideals of world
government," that Carlos Romulo, most outspoken ad
vocate of world government in the United Nations, war,
elected president of the General Assembly, and that
Lord Boyd-Orr, president of the World Movement for
Woi Id Federal Government, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for 194!).
What was your answer to Mr. Weigel's question, "Do
you trust the intelligence ol the American people?" Mr.
Weigel's next, statement, not quoted by Mr. Davis, was,
"If you do, you have nothing to fear from the idea of
world government, because the American people, either
directly o> through their accredited representatives in
tlie state legislatures will have to approve the new
asocial ion."
Mi Davis, like many other opponents to world gov
ernment, offers no constructive alternative. The prob
lem.', of today s world are manifold and imperative.
'I hey demand positive answers. No proposal, including
ol world government, can offer an absolute guar
antee of peace, but world government does offer the best
possibility of peace. We would be poor gamblers indeed
if We did riot take (lie I.eSl odds
