### JOHN BREIER Daily Sports Editor 
Today's column is the swan song of this writer as sports editor of The
Daily. Midway through each school year, the staff elects a new editor and
the department heads change. Today's issue is the last of Volume 116.
Sunday we start out with new officials. Writing this column is my last act
as sports editor.
So it seems fitting to set out my views as to the job of sports editor. Per
haps this should have been done at the beginning of the school year. I hope
some of my policies have been evident durtng the volume.
Hearts and flowers music, Professor.
First, I believe, it is the job of the sports department of the paper to aim
for the betterment of athletics at Stanford. Not just the major sports, not
even just the minor sports; but all sports.
Stanford is a big school and athletics, from mural basketball to varsity
football, deserve full and equal play on the sports pages. Naturally the
school at large is more interested in the doings of the footballers than
whether Encina Basement won or lost its intramural football game. But
the sports page should endeavor to give the latter its just coverage.
It is the job of the sports editor to see that this is done. It is his reponsi
bility to see that the sports page gets out each and every night. For this, he
relies on his desk editors. I wish now to thank George Anderson, Bob Bern
stein. A 1 Berry, Dick Klein. Phil Steinmetz, and Dwight Wilbur for the
excellent work turned in on this job during the last four and one-half
months.
Aside from the technical details that command the attention of the sports
editor, there is the matter of policy. There is little or no "pressure" exerted
upon The Daily from outside sources. A sports column writer has had the
right to print whatever he wants about whomever he wants. It is here that
he must ask himself, "Is what I'm going to say for the betterment of Stan
ford athletics?"
Now that the volume draws to a close, I look back over the football sea
son and reflect upon this question.
On the whole I think it's been a good year. Oh, it hasn't been a quiet
year. But, after all. part of the job of the sports page is to point out the
errors and suggest corrections.
The men who make up the athletic staff of this University are, on the
whole, a grand bunch of persons. But complacency and ill-advised action,
or no action at ail, are not to be put up with—not even from men of the
best personal qualities.
So it has been that 1 have pointed the finger of fault at some men or
some actions of the athletic staff. It is all based on an old saying learned
during childhood that went something like —"We are not bound to be right,
but we are bound to be true, stand by our friends when they are right and
part with them when they are wrong."
So, however nice it is to be buddy-buddy with the coaches and adminis
trative officials, it is the duty of the .sports editor, indeed of the paper as a
whole, to campaign for better things.
I only hope that some good will come of some of my actions of the past
half-year. The resentment of the student body at losing football games
had gone too long unexpressed. The changes I advocted were not to be
effected, but if my charges cause the coaching staff to be more careful, to
be more diligent, then I consider them worthwhile. In any event, it was
good to bring the conditions to the light of public survey.
And now it's out with the old and in with the new. The new in this case
is A 1 Berry, a veteran of several years standing on The Daily and creator
of "On The Bench." Best of luck Al, you have a great bunch of guys with
which to work.

be more diligent, then I consider them worthwhile. In any event, it was
good to bring the conditions to the light of public survey.
And now it's out with the old and in with the new. The new in this case
is A 1 Berry, a veteran of several years standing on The Daily and creator
of "On The Bench." Best of luck Al, you have a great bunch of guys with
which to work.
Today's column is the swan song of this writer as sports editor of The
Daily. Midway through each school year, the staff elects a new editor and
the department heads change. Today's issue is the last of Volume 116.
Sunday we start out with new officials. Writing this column is my last act
as sports editor.
So it seems fitting to set out my views as to the job of sports editor. Per
haps this should have been done at the beginning of the school year. I hope
some of my policies have been evident durtng the volume.
Hearts and flowers music, Professor.
First, I believe, it is the job of the sports department of the paper to aim
for the betterment of athletics at Stanford. Not just the major sports, not
even just the minor sports; but all sports.
Stanford is a big school and athletics, from mural basketball to varsity
football, deserve full and equal play on the sports pages. Naturally the
school at large is more interested in the doings of the footballers than
whether Encina Basement won or lost its intramural football game. But
the sports page should endeavor to give the latter its just coverage.
It is the job of the sports editor to see that this is done. It is his reponsi
bility to see that the sports page gets out each and every night. For this, he
relies on his desk editors. I wish now to thank George Anderson, Bob Bern
stein. A 1 Berry, Dick Klein. Phil Steinmetz, and Dwight Wilbur for the
excellent work turned in on this job during the last four and one-half
months.
Aside from the technical details that command the attention of the sports
editor, there is the matter of policy. There is little or no "pressure" exerted
upon The Daily from outside sources. A sports column writer has had the
right to print whatever he wants about whomever he wants. It is here that
he must ask himself, "Is what I'm going to say for the betterment of Stan
ford athletics?"
Now that the volume draws to a close, I look back over the football sea
son and reflect upon this question.
On the whole I think it's been a good year. Oh, it hasn't been a quiet
year. But, after all. part of the job of the sports page is to point out the
errors and suggest corrections.
The men who make up the athletic staff of this University are, on the
whole, a grand bunch of persons. But complacency and ill-advised action,
or no action at ail, are not to be put up with—not even from men of the
best personal qualities.
So it has been that 1 have pointed the finger of fault at some men or
some actions of the athletic staff. It is all based on an old saying learned
during childhood that went something like —"We are not bound to be right,
but we are bound to be true, stand by our friends when they are right and
part with them when they are wrong."
So, however nice it is to be buddy-buddy with the coaches and adminis
trative officials, it is the duty of the .sports editor, indeed of the paper as a
whole, to campaign for better things.
I only hope that some good will come of some of my actions of the past
half-year. The resentment of the student body at losing football games
had gone too long unexpressed. The changes I advocted were not to be
effected, but if my charges cause the coaching staff to be more careful, to
be more diligent, then I consider them worthwhile. In any event, it was
good to bring the conditions to the light of public survey.
And now it's out with the old and in with the new. The new in this case
