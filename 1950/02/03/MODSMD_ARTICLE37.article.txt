guard.

p'ay Coach Burnett's charges. San
Jose is currently second in the Pe
j ninsula with a three-win one-loss
j record.

straight since their defeats by Cali
fornia last month and in each game

I with encouraging regularity. He has
! scored U8 points in the last two out
j ings for an average of 19 points a
! game.
