# Cohen Cites Lack of Reality Shown By UN Antagonists; Claims UN No Failure
## 
### 
The United Nations is not a fail- <
! ure, and persons who are seeking to ;
| replace it with another form of
world organization are entirely out
of touch with reality.
This is the contention of Benja- <
min Cohen, veteran South Ameri
can newspaperman and diplomat,
and now a United Nations official.
Cohen, assistant secretary general |
in charge of public information, 1
made one of two appearances in the
Bay Area yesterday when he visited
! the Stanford campus as the guest of
| the Institute of International Rela- j
! tions, a student organization.
Asked at a question and answer j
period about the United World Fed
i eralist movement, Cohen asserted: [
"Governments grow from the j
i community; they must spring from j
the roots, from the basic common j
j feeling of the members of the com- •
inunity."
Cohen pointed oat that he is not
opposed to the world federation
idea, but he stated that the world
is not ready for the plan.
The Chilean-born UN official ad
mitted that the development of the J
| organization has been slow and has j
not always lived up to expectations, j
but he denied that the United Na
: tions has failed.
"You can't expect an international j
i government to operate faster than a I
| national or local one.
"People take it for granted when

the San Mateo County Board of Su
! pervisors takes a year to decide
whether or not to pave a section of
road, but these same people expect
the UN to creat miracles over
j night."
Cohen said that critics forget that
the UN charter has not yet been
j used fully, that it is being used more
j and more each year.
"A mechanism must have some
thing to make it go. The United Na
[ tions won't run without countries to
make it operate."
Countries are taking part now
| more than ever, according to Cohen.
: and the UN is being handed prob
! lems it wasn't even set up to handle.
"In fact, the UN has greater pres
\ tige today than it has ever had in
j the past."
Coben complimented students who
met with him on their understand
j ing and interest in the world gov
ernment problem.
At a luncheon earlier in the after
i noon he told students and faculty
members, "You here who look out
| across the Pacific and to South
America are in a position to deal
| with matters which are going to re-

place in first importance those of
Europe."
Arrangements for Cohen's visit
were made by David Chan, lIR
vice - president. Cohen was intro
duced at the luncheon by Dr. James
Watkins, associate professor of po
litical science. Mrs. Inez G. Rich
ardson of the Hoover Library staff
arranged the question and answer
period.
Cohen spoke in San Francisco
yesterday afternoon before leaving
for Los Angeles where he will speak
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia.

At a luncheon earlier in the after
i noon he told students and faculty
members, "You here who look out
| across the Pacific and to South
America are in a position to deal
| with matters which are going to re-

place in first importance those of
Europe."
Arrangements for Cohen's visit
were made by David Chan, lIR
vice - president. Cohen was intro
duced at the luncheon by Dr. James
Watkins, associate professor of po
litical science. Mrs. Inez G. Rich
ardson of the Hoover Library staff
arranged the question and answer
period.
Cohen spoke in San Francisco
yesterday afternoon before leaving
for Los Angeles where he will speak
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
The United Nations is not a fail- <
! ure, and persons who are seeking to ;
| replace it with another form of
world organization are entirely out
of touch with reality.
This is the contention of Benja- <
min Cohen, veteran South Ameri
can newspaperman and diplomat,
and now a United Nations official.
Cohen, assistant secretary general |
in charge of public information, 1
made one of two appearances in the
Bay Area yesterday when he visited
! the Stanford campus as the guest of
| the Institute of International Rela- j
! tions, a student organization.
Asked at a question and answer j
period about the United World Fed
i eralist movement, Cohen asserted: [
"Governments grow from the j
i community; they must spring from j
the roots, from the basic common j
j feeling of the members of the com- •
inunity."
Cohen pointed oat that he is not
opposed to the world federation
idea, but he stated that the world
is not ready for the plan.
The Chilean-born UN official ad
mitted that the development of the J
| organization has been slow and has j
not always lived up to expectations, j
but he denied that the United Na
: tions has failed.
"You can't expect an international j
i government to operate faster than a I
| national or local one.
"People take it for granted when

the San Mateo County Board of Su
! pervisors takes a year to decide
whether or not to pave a section of
road, but these same people expect
the UN to creat miracles over
j night."
Cohen said that critics forget that
the UN charter has not yet been
j used fully, that it is being used more
j and more each year.
"A mechanism must have some
thing to make it go. The United Na
[ tions won't run without countries to
make it operate."
Countries are taking part now
| more than ever, according to Cohen.
: and the UN is being handed prob
! lems it wasn't even set up to handle.
"In fact, the UN has greater pres
\ tige today than it has ever had in
j the past."
Coben complimented students who
met with him on their understand
j ing and interest in the world gov
ernment problem.
