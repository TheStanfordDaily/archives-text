# AT CUBBERLEY
## Federal Aid To Schools Forum Topic 
### 
The problem of federal aid to ed
ucation will be examined at an NSA
Forum Monday at 7:30 p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium.
This topic is one of NAS's national
policies decided at the national
conference last summer. The forum
is being held in order to see how
Stanford students feel about this
problem, so that it can be taken
back to the next national confer
once.
Bob Bennent, Jack Sinclair, and
speakers from the Republican and
Democratic party committees will
speak on both sides of the question
for a half-hour Monday night. A
30-minute question period will fol
low and then patieular groups will
split up into separate round-table
discussion groups.
All students interested in discuss
ing this national issue are invited to
attend the forum. Special groups
attending en masse arc advised to
come together so that it will be
easier to break up into a round
table seminar later.
This is the first of a scries of NSA
forums to be held this quarter and
next to find out what Stanford
thinks on issues of contemporary
relevance.
