duction, will be presented Thurs

The play, a farce about the mo
tion picture industry, was written
by the man-wife playwright team,
Sam and Bella Spcwack. It was
presented on Broadway several
years ago, and was later made into
a movie.
Dr. A. Nicholas Vardac, professor
of speech and drama, is director and
designer of the play. According to
Vardac, the action of the play re

volves around a pair of Hollywood
script writers and their mad-scram
ble activities to hang on to their
jobs.
Their boss is ;i producer with the
occupational disease, ulcers. Into
the producer's office, the main scene
of the play, come a naive and beau
tiful blonde waitress, her illegiti
mate son, Happy, who is later made
into an infant star, a hungry actor's
agent, a British nobleman turned
bit- player, an old Western actor,
and a series of other Hollywood
characters.
"Boy Meets Girl," said Vardac, "is
one of the most honest plays about

the film colony In come out in ic
cent years. We have tried in main
tain its lively satire of Hollywood's
men and women."
Sets for the play were consti ucl
ed by Delfotd Brummer ;>nd Gene
Callnon. The main set lias been
built on a single acting wagon,
which allows it to be moved of! the
center stage in a few seconds. This
new method of staging is being used
for the first time at Stanford.

lighting. Ray Sanders is in charge
of the sound effects.
Incidental music for the show was
composed by VVally White.
