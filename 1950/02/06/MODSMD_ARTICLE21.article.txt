# Varsity Cagers Romp Over Hapless St. Mary's
## Deanmen to Meet Bruins, Trojans 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's climbing cagers,
with Everett Dean dipping deep
into his reserves in an attempt
to hold down the score, pranced
past pitiful St. Mary's Friday
night in the Cow Palace, 55 to 36.
Every man on the bench, totaling
15 this trip, got into the act as the
Cards piled up their ninth win of
the season to get up over the .500
mark (nine wins, eight losses) for
the first time since late December. It
was also the first time this season
that Stanford has managed to run
up three consecutive victories.
But the loss was nothing new to the
Gaels. It was their 14th out of 17
for the season and their 10th straight
setback in Frank Walsh's Cow Pal
ace.
Slow Start
It all started slowly. St. Mary's
opened with a zone defense, but it
began to look like a sieve after Bruce
Iverson netted a free throw, and then
followed with a neat 20-foot flip from
the right corner for 3-0.
From then on the Indians began to
pull away with ease. By intermis
sion it was 27 to 14. St. Mary's
couldn't have hit the hoop with a
handful of buckshot. They missed 13
free throws, muffed numerous lay
ins, and were colder than frozen
raspberries. Their game total of 10
field goals was a Cow Palace low.
Stanford scoring was well split.
Jack O'Sullivan finally nabbed high
point honors with 12. George Yard
ley and Jim Ramstead were coast
ing along behind him with 11 each.
14.4 Point Average
Yardley, who has averaged 15
points per against better competition,
didn't seem to want to pour it on the
little Gaels. His 11 digits brought
the season total to 247 for 17 games,
and a 14.4 average.
Bomber George's competitor for
the other forward spot (besides
Sharman) on the all-Division five,
A 1 Swayer of UCLA, trails him
slightly in the digit department.
Sawyer has pushed up 218 in 17 out
ings for a 12.8 average.
He remains 29 points behind Yard
ley, even though he has had the bene
fit of three recent breathers in which
UCLA has gone all-out. (Santa Bar
bara, 67-43; Cal Poly, 60-38; and
Fresno State, 91-40.)
Defending Champs
These same Bruins, the defending
champs of the Southern Division,
and currently tied for the leadership
of the 1950 race, will put in their
first appearance of the year at Stan
ford's Pavilion next Friday night.
USC, with Bullseye Bill Sharman,
wlil step onto the local scene Satur
day night. The Trojans and Bruins
have already whacked Stanford once
in their home barns, and are dead
locked in the Division scamper, with
3-1 records.
Stanford hasn't beaten USC in 10
tries, and the Cards' last win over
UCLA was way back in the first
league game more than a year ago.
Since then, it. has been a complete
drought.


JIM RAMSTEAD, soph center on the Card varsity, tanked ] 1
points as the Stanford five dumped the St. Mary's Gaels Friday
night in the Cow Palace. With Jim's steady improvement, the
center should be a big help in this weekend's pair against UCLA
and USC in the Pavilion.
