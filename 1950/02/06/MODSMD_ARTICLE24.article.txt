# Daily Policy Reaffirmed
## 
### 
Today, once again, the "Undei Now Man
agement" notice is tacked on the bulletin boaid
in The Daily editorial offices. The notice goes
up three times every yeai, sure as death and
taxes. And just as surely people wondet what
the effect on Daily policy will be.
VVe can't tell you exactly what the elfert will
be, because we won't know until the last papei
ol the volume goes to press. Policy grows and
takes shape day by day, as it meets new piob
lems.
But our policy always will be consistent with
one ideal ... to serve the best interests ol
the majority of Stanford people.
We will serve this ideal, to the bent of our
ability, in three ways:
1. By providing the Stanford community with
accurate, timely news and information, pre
sented in a clear and interesting manner.
Our primary job is to report campus news,
concerning the student body and the adminis
{ration. i 'I'his news will be reported as com
{,letely as possible.
The importance which we will attach to any
news story will be based 011 the number ol
readers which, in our opinion, that story will
affect or interest.
On this basis, we will give somewhat in
creased attention to national and international
news. We will do so because we believe that
Stanford students have a broader, better-bal
anced perspective than the proverbial Joe Col
lege.
2, By reflecting student opinion.
Through sensitive, alert reporting and letters
to-the-editor, we will examine the opinions of
qui readers, so that we may better serve our
basic policy in a third way:
3 liy constructive editorial comments, (lis
cuss ions, and suggestions.
Daily editorials are a composite of the work
of live people—the Staff Editor, two Associate

Editors, the Managing Editor, and the Editor.
This gioup represents the editorial "we" of the
Stanford Daily.
We will do oui best always to be fair and im
partial. We will examine both sides of every
guestion thoroughly. Then we'll call 'em as we
3ee 'em.
