Campus opinion on the controversial topic
"Federal Aid to Education" will be sought at an
open forum to be held in Cubberley Audi
toiium this evening.
The group will attempt to decide whether the
benefits resulting from such a program are
sufficient to justify the danger of putting the
educational institutions of this country under
an increasing buiden of federal control.
Two California state assemblymen, Robert
Condon and Richard Dolwig, and two Stanford
men, Bob Bennett and lack Sinclair, will discuss
both sides of the problem. A guestion period
and individual round table groups for more
detailed study will follow.
This procedure is essentially the same as that
followed at the National Student Congress held
on the campus of the University of Illinois last
summer. At that time a resolution was passed
which put the NSA on record as favoring a pro
gram of federal scholarships to aid the esti
mated 74 per cent of all children under 18 years
of age whose families cannot afford to send
them to college.
Tonight's discussion is being sponsored by
the Stanford NSA Committee as the first of sev
eral forums on NSA national policies. Opinions
expressed in these forums will be carried back
to the National Congress next summer.
Students and faculty members interested in
educational problems as well as those con
cerned with NSA policies should try to attend
tonight's sessions. W.H.S.
