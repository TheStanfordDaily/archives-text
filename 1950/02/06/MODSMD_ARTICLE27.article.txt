## World Government 
### 
To the Editor:
I have been reading all the pros and cons of the
worU government question in the Letters to the Edi
tor coliimn, and it occurs to me that one thing has not
been considered yet: the new (since World War 11)
concept of the shrinking world.
This concept has nothing to do with any "Bailey
Willis earthquake scare," but instead with the increase
in speed of transportation and communication: from
l.'j in.p.h. in the horse and buggy days to at least 700
m.p.h. (speed ol sound) in these days of jet aircraft
and guided missiles. We realize this when the hydro
gen bomb question is brought up, but do we think of
its implications in terms of living with the rest of the
countries of the world.
We have Europe due north of Alaska, and Asia
due north of Greenlanad on a North Pole cen
tered map. Knowing these and othei things, too, don't
we also have to revise our thinking a little bit? We all
iherish our American traditions, as Mr. Close does,
but must these traditions be seimply nationalism and
isolationism? That the United States i vitally inter
ested in what goes on in the world is illustrated (for
belter or worse) in Thursday's Daily under the AP
rii story "Reds Reject indo-China Protest." (By
the way, Hue, where 200 Vietnamese and 20 French
men were killed in a battle, is 400 miles down I he coast
from Communist China and much closer to the newly
independent kingdom of Cambodia this is not a
Daily error.)
I'm not praising or condemning tho United Federal
, is, but 1 can say this; they are looking into the future
und trying to think of a solution. They may be vision
ary "America wreckers," but they are at least pio
r if i lng a way to face this new problem. History may
accept or reject them—or even brim.' up a successful
substitute- but at least they believe , t s I do that war

and the hydrogen bomb are not the only solutions for
a problem created by the rise of the airplane,
