To the Editor:
One of the best possible commentaries on democ
racy came out of Washington last Thursday night in
the form of a radio amateur hour. It featured high
ranking officers from all four branches of the armed
services and a considerable number of congressional
representatives from both houses and of both sexes.
It was amusing, and amazing, to hear the Veep and
his V-P (very pretty, that is) lady sing with a mixed
chorus; a quartet of navy high brass sound off with
old "Makalapa"; a Republican congressman do a line
take-off of "Winnie" addressing Congress; a trio of
eastern representatives trip heavily through "O Sole
Mio"; and, best of all, a sextet of soloists (a senator, a
representative, a marine colonel, a navy admiral, and
air force general, and an army general) each sing a
chorus, to the accompaniment of a hammy orchestra
made up of similar personalities, telling their listen
ers that, "above all, they serve Americans all."
Where else in this whole wide world would you be
likely to heat such an assemblage of high dignitaries
publicly indulging in an hour of horseplay on behalf
of a charitable organization (American Heart Asso
ciation) cause? Can you, for instance, imagine the
president of the French Chamber of Deputies giving
up his gavel for a gong? O'r one of Joe's stolid hench
men swapping his hammer for a jews-harp?
There must be a moral in all this: dignity be
damned? familiarity breeds contempt? arrogance in
spires insult? humility brings harmony? I suppose,
seriously, that if more so called statesmen could oc
casionally lay aside their arrogance and dignity they
might recapture some of the simple human values that
make lor harmonious existence.
