# UC Reg Fee May Rise
## 
### 
Difficulties in financing the pro
posed new student activities build
ing may mean that University of
California students will have to pay
an additional registration fee of
$G.25 a semester.
The boost, if approved, would be
in the form of a compulsory ASTJC
membership. The student body
privilege card, which has been a re
quired purchase at Stanford for
many years, is now optional at Cal.
An estimated $25,000 a year would
be added to the ASUC income by
this arrangement, say student body
officials. The extra money would be
used to give backing to a bond issue
to finance the new building. The
students' share of the building cost
is $2,000,000.
A student election will be held
Saturday, when the second semester
opens, at which Cal students will
accept or reject the proposed "uni
versal" ASUC card.

The activities building plans in
clude lounges, auditoriums, stores,
oHices, a cafeteria, a lunch room,
and dining rooms. An art gallery
and record playing rooms are on the
tentative list. The building will be
located just outside the Berkeley
campus's Sather Gate.
