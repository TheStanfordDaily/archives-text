# Freshmen Take High School Wins
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
The frosh five, looking more like
a team each game, kept their win
streak intact with two narrow
squeaks over the weekend. The
freshmen nipped Lincoln High, 42 to
41, on Friday, and on Saturday
dumped San Jose, 52 to 49. Both
games were as close as the scores, j
Pressed to the limits, the fresh- i
men had a tough time with the |
scrappy Bulldogs from San Jose, j
Coach Bob Burnett was able to sub- |
stitute only four men. Forward Paul I
Johnson stayed on the hardwood the !
entire go. Dropping in two quick |
buckets before intermission, the Pa- |
pooses held a 28-2.'i lead at half- '
time.

Inspired by the play of their ter- |
rific center Vein Wilson, the Bull
dogs kept with the frosh for the
rest of the game. Wilson, one of the
smoothest prepsters around, was
great on dribbling and play-making,
and also connected for ten of eleven
free tosses. His total of 16 points
was high along with Bill Steven
son's 16.
Unable to make their plays work
against the ball-hawking, but short.
Bulldogs, the frosh stayed back
from the circle and potted with
great accuracy. Combined with San
Jose's inability to hit their share of
shots after setting up good plays, the
Papooses cashed in on their long
range bombing.
Alter Stevenson in the scoring
parade, Johnson meshed 15; George
Zaninovich and Fritz Fenster, the
top guards, 7 and 6; and Wade Mc
| Clusky, 3. Subs Jack Shepherd and
Jim Harding grabbed 4 and 1, re
i spectively.

Friday's contest, also an afternoon
game in the Pavilion, was even clos
er on the scoreboard. But the Lin
colns found it hard to stop Bill Ste
venson. as the Stanford center went
lon a scoring spree. He ended up
with 24 markers, including 9 field
goals.
