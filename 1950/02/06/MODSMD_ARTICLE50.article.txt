"California and Stanford really
haven't changed as much as I ex
pected in the eight years I have
been away," said Dr. Kazuo Kawai,
visiting professor of Japanese his
tory.
"I imagine I feel this way be
cause I have come from a country
in which there have been radical
changes in political, social, and eco
nomic fields," he explained.
As examples of these changes he
cited change in the status of the em
peror, women's suffrage, civil lib
erties, land reforms, a new school
system, the increase of local auton
omy, and the disbanding of the army
and navy.

"Economically, however. Japan is
prostrate," he said. "Her condition
now is worse than before the war

since she cannot get needed raw
materials and foreign markets. Also,
inflation is still present."
He also mentioned the physical
change in Japan because of the
bombing and reconstruction, and
said that Japan today is completely
unrecognizable to a person who
knew the country five or six years
ago.
''In contrast, the change in Cali
fornia and Stanford shows progress,
not revolution." he explained. "I
am impressed by the relative stabil
ity, the lack of revolutionary
change, and the feeling of continuity
here," he continued.
Dr. Kawai, an affable, rather
slight man who speaks excellent
English, arrived from Tokyo last
quarter as a visiting lecturer for one
year. He was allowed to leave his
native country under an Army di
rective which lets Japanese nation
als come here for cultural, econom
ic, and religious reasons.
Editor-in-Chief
He is at present editor-in-chief
of the "Nippon Times," one of the
four English - language newspapers
published in Japan.
After spending most of his life in
the United States, and attending
Stanford. Harvard, and teaching at
UCLA, Dr. Kawai found himself
marooned in Japan during the sum
mer of 1941 when he had gone there
for a short visit to his parents.
Two weeks after he arrived, the
ships between Japan and the United
States were stopped and he was not
allowed to return. Since he could
not fulfill his teaching obligations

that fall he got a job wtih the "Nip
pon Times" and remained there in
various capacities until this year.
He was made editor -in - chief in
1947.
Bombing Was 'Bad'
"The bombing in Tokyo was bad,"
was his only comment on the war.
In answer to the question of what
will happen when the American oc
cupation ends, he said that there
will be some reaction.
"But Japan will never go back to
the way she was before," he said.
; "The changes are being pushed so
I rapidly and the pressure is so great
; that no matter how great a reaction
I there is, it will not go very far. The
occupation reforms will have a per
manent effect," he added.

was his only comment on the war.
In answer to the question of what
will happen when the American oc
cupation ends, he said that there
will be some reaction.
"But Japan will never go back to
the way she was before," he said.
; "The changes are being pushed so
I rapidly and the pressure is so great
; that no matter how great a reaction
I there is, it will not go very far. The
occupation reforms will have a per
manent effect," he added.

"California and Stanford really
haven't changed as much as I ex
pected in the eight years I have
been away," said Dr. Kazuo Kawai,
visiting professor of Japanese his
tory.
"I imagine I feel this way be
cause I have come from a country
in which there have been radical
changes in political, social, and eco
nomic fields," he explained.
As examples of these changes he
cited change in the status of the em
peror, women's suffrage, civil lib
erties, land reforms, a new school
system, the increase of local auton
omy, and the disbanding of the army
and navy.
No Materials
"Economically, however. Japan is
prostrate," he said. "Her condition
now is worse than before the war

since she cannot get needed raw
materials and foreign markets. Also,
inflation is still present."
He also mentioned the physical
change in Japan because of the
bombing and reconstruction, and
said that Japan today is completely
unrecognizable to a person who
knew the country five or six years
ago.
''In contrast, the change in Cali
fornia and Stanford shows progress,
not revolution." he explained. "I
am impressed by the relative stabil
ity, the lack of revolutionary
change, and the feeling of continuity
here," he continued.
Dr. Kawai, an affable, rather
slight man who speaks excellent
English, arrived from Tokyo last
quarter as a visiting lecturer for one
year. He was allowed to leave his
native country under an Army di
rective which lets Japanese nation
als come here for cultural, econom
ic, and religious reasons.
Editor-in-Chief
He is at present editor-in-chief
of the "Nippon Times," one of the
four English - language newspapers
published in Japan.
After spending most of his life in
the United States, and attending
Stanford. Harvard, and teaching at
UCLA, Dr. Kawai found himself
marooned in Japan during the sum
mer of 1941 when he had gone there
for a short visit to his parents.
Two weeks after he arrived, the
ships between Japan and the United
States were stopped and he was not
allowed to return. Since he could
not fulfill his teaching obligations

that fall he got a job wtih the "Nip
pon Times" and remained there in
various capacities until this year.
He was made editor -in - chief in
1947.
Bombing Was 'Bad'
"The bombing in Tokyo was bad,"
was his only comment on the war.
In answer to the question of what
will happen when the American oc
cupation ends, he said that there
will be some reaction.
