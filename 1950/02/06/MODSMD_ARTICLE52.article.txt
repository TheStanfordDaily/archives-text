# Daily Couple Wins Charleston Contest
## 
### 
Daily staff members Wally White
and Sue Goodstein danced away
with the Charleston prize at the
weekly College Night Friday in the
Mark Hopkins.
"We were hardly trying," ex
plained White. When the couple was
called up to receive the prize they
hadn't realized that the contest was
in progress. Their rendition of the
Charleston won them a bottle of
champagne, which, according to on
looker Dick Moore, another Daily
man, was exhausted in 38 seconds.
The Stanford couples were at
tending Casa Magnolia's annual
party.
