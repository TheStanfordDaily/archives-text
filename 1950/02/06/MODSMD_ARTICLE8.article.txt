# British Scientist Faces Possible U.S. Extradition
## FBI Says Fuchs Told Bomb Plans 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (/I') —
Chairman McMahon (D., Conn.)
said tonight that the Congressional
Atomic Committee is exploring the
possibility o? American extradition
of Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist
suspected of passing atomic and hy
drogen bomb secrets to Russia.
The Connecticut Senator added,
however, that preliminary study by
the committee's lawyers has raised
doubt as to whether any effort to
force Fuchs to come to this country
for possible trial would succeed.
Fuchs, 38, is a native of Germany
but a British citizen. He was ar
rested in London last Friday on
chargcs of violating Britain's Offi
cial Secrets Act.
As a member of a British team of
scientists who he'ped develop the
atomic bomb in this country in 194.'i
-46, Fuchs harl access not, only to se
crets of that, weapon but to data
then available about the super
powerful hydrogen bomb which the
United States now is attempting to
build.
FBI Information
Senators have quoted FBI Chief J.
Edgar Hoover as saying the evi
dence indicates that Fuchs passed
both hydrogen and atomic bomb in
formation to Russia.
Hoover already has told a Senate
appropriations subcommittee about
the Fuchs case. Tomorrow he is
scheduled to meet behind closed

doors with the Joint Atomic Com
mittee.
After hearing Hoover, the same
committee will hold a public ses
sion to question Ll. Gov Leslie H.
Groves, wartime director of the A
bomb project.
Cleared by British
Groves, McMahon reported, said
Fuchs was cleared by the British
government, for A - bomb work in
this country, and that the clearance
never was double - checked by
Groves' Army unit which had juris
diction over the project at. the time.
He said that, the British vouchsafed
loyalty and discretion of all mem
bers of their mission.
The first word that the joint com
mittee bad discussed the possibility
of extraditing Fuchs to this country
came from Rep. Durham (D., N.C.),
vice-chairman of the group. Asked
about it., McMahon put out this
statement,:
Legal Problems
"Fuchs is a British subject and
the British judicial processes seem
to be workng, and the British au
thorities seem to be on the alert.
"It is true that the matter of
Fuchs' violation of our laws has
been discussed in the joint commit
tee. At my request, inquiries into
the legal problems involved in bs
possible extradition have been
made.
"I am informed 'by counsel for
the committee that doubt exists in
his mind as to whether or not, the
applicable extradition treaty be
tween the United States and Cheat
Britain would apply."
