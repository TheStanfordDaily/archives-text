# NSA Forum Discusses Aid To Education
## 
### DICK MOORE 
Would the advantages of federal
aid to education be offset by the dis- i
advantages? This problem was dis- j
cussed by Richard Dolwig, Repub- i
lican assemblyman from San Mateo
County, Robert Condon, Democratic j
assemblyman from Contra Costa
County, and two Stanford law stu- j
dents, Robert Bennett, and Jack Sin- j
clair, in Cubbcrley Auditorium last
night.
The round - table and audience
participation discussion was spon
sored by the NSA and moderated by
Carl Stover. The NSA national con- |
vention last summer agreed upon a
policy of backing federal Hid to edu
cation.
The discussion mainly centered on
two bills which are before Congress
at the present time. One bill which
has passed the House of Representa
tives and is now in the Senate pro
poses that $UOO million be given by
the federal government to state gov
ernments for the betterment of ele
mentary and secondary education.
The wealthier states, such as Cali
fornia, would pay more into the
program than they would receive
from it.
A second bill which was discussed
proposes that one million dollars be >
awarded to students on the college
level in accordance wtih their aca
demic ability and economic need.
Assemblyman Condon spoke in
favor of educational aid and an
swered what he believed weir the
more valid objections to federal aid.
He said that the pending bills were
drafted so that, there would bo no
federal control over the money. He
added that the cost of the programs
would amount to only one-half of
one per cent of the national budget.
California would pay $22 million
into the program and receive only
$H million, but it is the responsi
bility of the state to do so, accord
ing to Mr. Condon.
Assemblyman Dolwig said that,
past federal aid to educational pro
grams, such as the GI Bill, has
demonstrated that federal control
can become too strong.
Robert Bonnet., arguing for aid,
stated that proper drafting of the
bills could eliminate excessive fed
eral control.
Sydney Morgan and Carl Stover
are co-chairmen of the forum com
mittee.
