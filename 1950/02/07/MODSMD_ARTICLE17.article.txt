# Wong Reveals Attacks; Continues China Stories

### DAVID WONG 
(For editorial comment, see page 2. Another Wong feature story ap
pears on page 1.)

For the past few months I have been writing articles for The
Stanford Daily. Because of those articles, I have been threat
ened with physical violence, and have, in fact, been subjected
to physical violence.
Certain elements at Stanford apparently think I should not be
writing such "exposing" articles. These elements have appar
ently lived for so long under totalitarian regimes that they now
forget that they are in America. They think they can still sup
press freedom of speech and thought by brute force.
My aim in writing articles is to try to help Americans gain a
better understanding of the Orient, and especially of my native
China. I have always tried to present the truth as I know it, with
out coloring and without reserve. If anyone finds fault with my
statements of facts, I invite correction.
However, these elements at Stanford find no fault in my (ac
tual statements. They only resent my exposure of such facts.
They believe that it is better to hush things up.
I am not in the same frame of mind; I believe that only by
writing about the truth as I know it can 1 hope to make American
minds think more kindly and American hearts feel more gen
erously toward Asia and the Asiatics, or more especially China
and the Chinese.
These elements also feol thai il I must write at all, I should
wtite only of the "nice things." Rut it is not my purpose to
write only of the luxurious hotels, the best tourist spots, and the
best places to wine and dine. Any visitor to the Orient can find
those things out easily enough.
It is rather my intention to present the life of the common
masses— the toil of the coolies, the lot of the farmers, the plight
of the common soldiers, and the hope of the street urchins and
shoe-shine boys.
Let me say now that 1 have no intention of being coerced into
silence by anyone. I will continue to write as long as the Stan
ford student body feels that my articles arc contributing to their
understanding of the Orient.
