WASHINGTON Cyrus S. Ching,
government mediation chief, today
called on the CIO telephone work
ers to put off their nationwide strike
until Feb. 24 and sternly told both
sides they "must" reach a prompt
settlement.
• With the walkout now set for (>
a.m. Wednesday, local time, Ching
spoke out for intensified bargaining.
He warned that a strike might have
international consequences by dam
aging the national economy and our
prestige abroad.
Ching's unusual, gravely worded
statement —delivered as negotiations
in New York appeared to be hope
lessly deadlocked — told both the
Communications Workers (CWA)
and the Bell Telephone System that
failure to agree would risk their
own freedoms.
