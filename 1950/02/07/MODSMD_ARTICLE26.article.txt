# T-H Act Used To Halt Strike
## President Names Board to Begin Inquiry on Coal Miners' Dispute 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (AP) —The nation's soft coal miners
struck today and President Truman immediately put the Taft-
Hartley Act in motion on a speed-up basis to try to force them back
to work next week.
Nearly 400,000 of John L. Lewis' United Mine Workers staged

♦•the mid - winter walkout, angrily
forcing a showdown after 10 months
of contract bickering over the union's
demand for higher pay, bigger wel
fare funds and other concessions.
; The nation has two weeks' supply
; of coal on hand. President Truman
found a national emergency was
j here.
Seeking a no-strike Federal Court
injunction against the union, he
I started the Taft-Hartley machinery
by naming a three-man board of in
quiry. He directed it to report to
him not later than next Monday.
When if, brings him the facts of
the coal dispute, Mr. Truman can at
once send Attorney-General Mc
Grath into court to ask for an order
directing the union to halt the strike
for 80 days.
Will Miners Obey?
Whether the miners would obey
this injunction is the next big ques
tion. Lewis himself raised this doubt
! Saturday when he told Mr. Truman
in a cryptic message:
"It is questionable whether one
could assume that such mass coer
cion (use of the Taft-Hartley Law)
would ensure enthusiastic service
from grateful men."
Failure to conform with a court
order can be punished as contempt.
The UMW and Lewis have been fined
twice for this offense, a total of
I $2,130,000
Inquiry Board Name?'
There was one strong hope for
peace in spite of the complete failum
of contract negotiations. This hope
lay in the makeup of the Taft-
Hartley fact-finding board named by
Mr. Truman. These men are veteran
I labor arbitrators. They are:
David L. Cole, Paterson, N.J , law
yer, chairman; John Dunlop, Har
vard University Business School,
who has been the arbiter between
the AFL Building Trades Depart
ment and the contracting industry in
jurisdictional disputes: W. Willard
Wirtz, Northwestern University law
professor and former chairman of the
Wage Stabilization Board.
Congressional Action
If an 80-day injunction runs out
without a settlement and the strike
recurs, the President is then sup
posed to take the problem to Con
gress.
Senator Taft, an author of the lav/
who previously had insisted that it
should be invoked, commented
simply that today's action by the
President "was a step necessary to
be taken."
