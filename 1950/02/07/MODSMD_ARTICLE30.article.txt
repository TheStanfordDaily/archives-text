# Attack on Daily Writer
## 
### 
David Wong, staff writer for The Daily, has
been subjected to physical violence because
of what he has written for The Daily about the
I'ar East.
He has been threatened and attacked be
cause his articles "said too much." not because
ihey were inaccurate.
It's the sort of thing that "can't happen here."
Not in a democracy. Not in the United States,
un a university campus. Yet it did.
Wong's refusal to name his attackers, on the
grounds that they "lived for so long under to
talitarian regimes that they now forget that
they are in America/' indicates the source of
the attack. He believes that they are not, in
themselves, to be blamed.
Wong's statement on page 1 of today's Daily

explains his purpose in writing these articles
. . . to help Americans better understand the
Orient by picturing true conditions there.
In our opinion he is well qualified to do just
that. He lived lor many years in China, Malaya,
and Australia. He traveled extensively, visiting
French Indo-China, the Philippines, and Japan.
For nearly three years he was a reporter on
the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.
He covered social, political, and shipping news
and the criminal courts.
The University has offered to protect him if
necessary, but he does not believe further at
tacks are likely.
Wong will continue to write his articles. We
will publish them. Any criticism will be wel
come ... in the Letters to the Editor column.
