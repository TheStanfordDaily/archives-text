CHOOSING YOUR MAJOR
(By Dr.. W. Supply and Demand Dailey, A.8.,
Ph D., 0.0.T.R.H.*)
1 Order of the Rubber (This is commonly
known. a& the Third Degree. This degree was re
ceived by Dr. Dailey. from the Board of Trustees of
Alcatraz University following the publication of his
book on money entitled "Father's Checks Were
Made of Rubber, So They Sent Him lip for a
Stretch.")
(Editor's Note.—Today's article is the fifth in our

current series on "Choosing Your
Major." In this morning's discus
sion, the subject of "So You're
Going to Major in Economics,
Eh?" will be treated by Dr.
Dailey, the eminent economist,
statistician, and exclusive campus
representative for athlete's foot.
(Dr. Daiiey is well qualified to
write on the subject of economics,
having taken every course in
economics offered by Stanford

University . . . twice. He has also done graduate
work in the following subjects — Economics of the
Treasury Department, under John W. Snyder; Eco
nomics of the Hospital, under Johns-Hopkins; and
Economics of Overhead (title or shingle) under Johns-
Manville.)
Economics is based upon a thorough knowledge of
mathematics. It is essential, therefore, that all would

be economists are well-grounded in the fundamentals
of the multiplication table. No one can hope to be a
good economist until he can multiply figures in rabbit
succession.
If you should desire to enter the Held of economics,
the first course you should take at Stanford is Econ I.
Many students feel that Econ 1 is a difficult course.
Actually this is not true. The Economics Department
decided several years ago that they would make up
easier tests. That is why they never change the ques
tions from the old tests. The only things they change
are the answers. (The foregoing joke was "jobbed"
by the author from Professor Carl Running of the
Business School.)
One of the basic rules of economics is the "Law of
Diminishing Returns." The term "Diminishing Re
turns" was originated by the Republican Party dur
ing the vote-counting for the 1948 presidential elec
tions. It has since been a by-word of the party.
Economics and politics are two subjects which are
closely related. At Stanford the Economics Depart
ment works together with the Political Science De
partment to mold the citizens of tomorrow. This, of
course, brings up the obvious question—Who wants a
bunch of moldy citizens?
NEXT WEEK: Dr. W. Shakespeare Dailey reviews
(lie state of tile American theatre in his article
"So You're Going to Major in Drama, Eh?" In this
essay. Dr. Daiiey will discuss that new Broadway
musical comedy "Gentlemen Prefer Women."
