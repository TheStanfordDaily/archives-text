To the Editor:
Monday 1 had pneumonia. Monday night I en
tered the Palo Alto Hospital with only one thought
on my mind: when to sign my last will and testament.
Four days and 400,000 units of penicillin later I was
i ined.
I've heard a lot of gripes about our Stanford Health

Service. I want to register my opinion, derived from
first-hand experience: If you're really sick, the Health
Seuvice wilJ make sure that you're well taken care
of. I know that there are a lot of students who have
been and are at the hospital and rest homes who share
my sentiment. Therefore, many thanks to our Health
Service, the doctors, and the hospital for a job well
done.
