WASHINGTON A powerful new
aircraft, nicknamed the "Mighty
Mouse." has been developed by the
Navy for air-to-air combat in any
future war.
The rocket operates with folding
fins which reduce air resistance on
the mother plane and increase the
carrying capacity of the launcher.
The rocket was fired by a Navy
attack plane, the Douglas AD-Sky-
Rairjer, at the Naval Ordnance Test
Station at Inyokcrn, Calif., where it
was developed during the past two
years.
