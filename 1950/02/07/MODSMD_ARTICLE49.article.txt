# Cards Must Win to Stay In Conference Scramble
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Don't look now, but the Southern
Division hoop hassle is about to get
under way again after a three-week
hesitation.
On second thought, you had bet
ter look because those bad boys
from the southland, known in Mick
ey Cohen's territory as the UCLA
Bruins and USC Trojans, will be
taking their seasonal bow on the Pa
vilion hardwood this weekend.
The Smog City melon tossers will
divide the duty, the Bruins opening
Friday night and Troy following up
Saturday night. They will also show
in Berkeley, only in reverse order.
What it all adds up to is this:
1. Stanford, after beating out its
longest win streak (3 straight) of
the season against non - conference
foes, will be forced to submit itself
once again to the terrible terror of
playing ball Trojan and Bruin style.

2. The games will definitely offer
I Stanford and Cal their last chance
to get back into contention with the
3-1 records of the USC and UCLA
j pacesetters.
3. If Stanford and Cal get double
-1 doused again, as happened in Los
I Angeles one month ago, Berkeley
and Palo Alto patrons can dust off
| those "Wait Till Next Year" banners
I and start talking baseball.
4. The weekend will present the
; Dixie loop's four top individual
| sparklers — Bullseye Bill Sharman,
Bomber George Yardley. Gorgeous
George Stanich, and Just Plain A 1
j Sawyer—all of whom will be bat
i tling it out to obtain grade A num
ber one billing.
5. It will be a showdown series for
Sharman, who socked away 31
j points against Stanford last time,
and who is currently ripping Hank
I Luisetti's 1938 scoring record to
j pieces with 90 points in four trips.
(». It will also be the 1950 local
debut of King Carl Kraushaar, the
crying kid with the long crooked
nose and habits to match.
7. And finally, this two-game ses
sion will serve as a springboard for
an all-out effort by the Cards to
erase the jinx which has left them
reeling from nine straight losses to
USC and four straight to the Bruins.
At any rate, it nil boils down
to a now-or-never test for the
Indians, who will ltc practicing
overtime this week for what they
hope will result in "Upset Week
end."
Everett Dean has two outstanding
problems, that of putting the skids
to the Bruin speed, and that of
shackling Sharman. To stop the j
Bruins he will probably try the USF j
method of strict ball control with no i
helter-skelter rushing. Pete New
ell's Dons conked the Westwooders
by 13 points.
The Sharman problem should be
easier. Bullseye Bill was humiliated
by Don Lofgran of USF when he
came north two weeks ago for a
Cow Palace series, and there is no
reason to believe that Stanford can't
come up with more of the same.
USC seems to be a one-man club.
Harm Sharman and things become
bleak for Barry's boys. However, it
takes a good man to harm the Fi
gueroa Street phantom.
At the moment, it looks like Blond
Bruce Iverson will draw the assign- j
ment. Then again, the Tribe might i
throw a zone at Sharman.
