## On The Bench 
### 
Now that The Bench has been moved to the traditional Sports Editor's
Tuesday morning spot, we suppose it is time to observe another tradition.
That is to tell the reader what a great sports staff this next volume has;
what a great job the preceding sports editor did; and what changes may be
expected to occur in the near future. So, this is it —but we'll keep it short.
We have a great staff for this next volume.
John Breier did, we think, one swell job from the editor's desk last
volume.
We'll have very few changes.
Maybe that is too short. 1 could elaborate a bit. On the basketball front
we proudly present one John Hull. John is best known for ]) his last
spring's eminence as sports editor, 2) his brilliant Bull Sessions, and 3) his
charming hatred of Carl Kransliaar. He is, we think, the top writer on The
Daily, so the future of basketball seems more than a bit secure.
Happiest addition to the staff will come in the form of the old professor,
Boh Bernstein, who is retreating from the tedium of the news side back to
sports. Bob will take desk foi Wednesday's paper and will run his column,
Midweek Musings (which he wants to call Bee-Bee Shots, but won't). Bill
Swigart, once an editor, will be back with the sportsmen and. along with
Sports Desk Editor Oeorge Anderson, will cover the horsehide game in the
Sunken Diamond. Bill will also give out with an occasional column, written
in a short and—presumably—more attractive style than we never-Editor
lellas are turning out. Bill, like Hall, was once a d-good sports editor.
And while we are speaking of sports editors, the old pipe smoker. John
Breier, will be back on the job, alternating with Swigart for the Thursday
column spot.
Which gives us four sports editors on the staff—a record of some sort.
There are a flock more of able sportsters on tap for the next quarter and a
half: Dwight Wilbur on track; Dick liltin ("the sporting line"man) on ten
nis; and I'hil Steinmetz, who will continue covering I'hil Bengtson's very
capable Brave Card cagers. All this, plus nearly a dozen sports reporters,
who—for the sake of space—we'll snub for the moment, will be on the job
to bring you the best possible sports page to go with the morning coffee.
So that's for tradition.

We were playing a question and answer game with Basketball-Baseball
Coach Everett Dean yesterday. 11 wasn't very soul-stirring, but it was nice
and this is how it went.
Q: When is the first baseball game?
A: Next Saturday (in the Sunken Diamond at 2:30) afternoon, against
the Richmond Club.
Q: Are you going to buy a bicycle?
A: 1 beg your pardon?
Q: I mean, aren't you going to be slightly busy with eight Conference
cage games coming up this next month, and now baseball worries piling up
on top of that?
A: I have no baseball worries until after I report to the Sunken Dia
mond early in March. The reason I don't is because of three fine coaches
and men—Dutch Fehring, Ray Hammet, and Charlie Bushong, who are
carrying the load out there now. (lie eyed the notes we were happily
scribbling.) You might say that these men are doing an outstanding job
in conditioning and in training the team in fundamentals.
Q: Now, about this basketball. Are you planning any secret weapon for
the L.A. gang this weekend?
A: Yep, we're going to use the H-bomb on them.
Q: Say, what's the scoop on the well-known jinx of the UCLA home court?
A: There isn't any jinx there. They've just got a good basketball club, a
small little-ventilated gym—about the same size as Stanford's, a particu
larly enthusiastic bunch of rooters, and—of course—the advantage of a
home court.
Q: Are we going to win this weekend?
A: We will try to.
(Ask a silly question, you get . . . .)
Q: Which team would you rather beat this weekend, USC or UCLA?
A: USC. We've had some tough ones with them, some close ones. .But
that doesn't mean that we aren't going to work just as hard to rack UCLA.
Q: Thanks, Coach.
A: Sure thing, Al.

And while we are speaking of sports editors, the old pipe smoker. John
Breier, will be back on the job, alternating with Swigart for the Thursday
column spot.
Which gives us four sports editors on the staff—a record of some sort.
There are a flock more of able sportsters on tap for the next quarter and a
half: Dwight Wilbur on track; Dick liltin ("the sporting line"man) on ten
nis; and I'hil Steinmetz, who will continue covering I'hil Bengtson's very
capable Brave Card cagers. All this, plus nearly a dozen sports reporters,
who—for the sake of space—we'll snub for the moment, will be on the job
to bring you the best possible sports page to go with the morning coffee.
So that's for tradition.

We were playing a question and answer game with Basketball-Baseball
Coach Everett Dean yesterday. 11 wasn't very soul-stirring, but it was nice
and this is how it went.
Q: When is the first baseball game?
A: Next Saturday (in the Sunken Diamond at 2:30) afternoon, against
the Richmond Club.
Q: Are you going to buy a bicycle?
A: 1 beg your pardon?
Q: I mean, aren't you going to be slightly busy with eight Conference
cage games coming up this next month, and now baseball worries piling up
on top of that?
A: I have no baseball worries until after I report to the Sunken Dia
mond early in March. The reason I don't is because of three fine coaches
and men—Dutch Fehring, Ray Hammet, and Charlie Bushong, who are
carrying the load out there now. (lie eyed the notes we were happily
scribbling.) You might say that these men are doing an outstanding job
in conditioning and in training the team in fundamentals.
Q: Now, about this basketball. Are you planning any secret weapon for
the L.A. gang this weekend?
A: Yep, we're going to use the H-bomb on them.
Q: Say, what's the scoop on the well-known jinx of the UCLA home court?
A: There isn't any jinx there. They've just got a good basketball club, a
small little-ventilated gym—about the same size as Stanford's, a particu
larly enthusiastic bunch of rooters, and—of course—the advantage of a
home court.
Q: Are we going to win this weekend?
A: We will try to.
(Ask a silly question, you get . . . .)
Q: Which team would you rather beat this weekend, USC or UCLA?
A: USC. We've had some tough ones with them, some close ones. .But
that doesn't mean that we aren't going to work just as hard to rack UCLA.
Q: Thanks, Coach.
A: Sure thing, Al.
Now that The Bench has been moved to the traditional Sports Editor's
Tuesday morning spot, we suppose it is time to observe another tradition.
That is to tell the reader what a great sports staff this next volume has;
what a great job the preceding sports editor did; and what changes may be
expected to occur in the near future. So, this is it —but we'll keep it short.
We have a great staff for this next volume.
John Breier did, we think, one swell job from the editor's desk last
volume.
We'll have very few changes.
Maybe that is too short. 1 could elaborate a bit. On the basketball front
we proudly present one John Hull. John is best known for ]) his last
spring's eminence as sports editor, 2) his brilliant Bull Sessions, and 3) his
charming hatred of Carl Kransliaar. He is, we think, the top writer on The
Daily, so the future of basketball seems more than a bit secure.
Happiest addition to the staff will come in the form of the old professor,
Boh Bernstein, who is retreating from the tedium of the news side back to
sports. Bob will take desk foi Wednesday's paper and will run his column,
Midweek Musings (which he wants to call Bee-Bee Shots, but won't). Bill
Swigart, once an editor, will be back with the sportsmen and. along with
Sports Desk Editor Oeorge Anderson, will cover the horsehide game in the
Sunken Diamond. Bill will also give out with an occasional column, written
in a short and—presumably—more attractive style than we never-Editor
lellas are turning out. Bill, like Hall, was once a d-good sports editor.
And while we are speaking of sports editors, the old pipe smoker. John
Breier, will be back on the job, alternating with Swigart for the Thursday
column spot.
Which gives us four sports editors on the staff—a record of some sort.
There are a flock more of able sportsters on tap for the next quarter and a
half: Dwight Wilbur on track; Dick liltin ("the sporting line"man) on ten
nis; and I'hil Steinmetz, who will continue covering I'hil Bengtson's very
capable Brave Card cagers. All this, plus nearly a dozen sports reporters,
