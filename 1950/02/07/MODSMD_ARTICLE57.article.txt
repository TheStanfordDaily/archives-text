# Luxury, Gaiety Mask Hong Kong Squalor
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Hong Kong is a colony of many j
parts, and each part is as different [
and as interesting as another. Prob
ably of all the Hong Kongs, the .
Hong Kong of glamour and romance
is the one visitors see most. That is
the Hong Kong of moonlight and
soft music, of beautiful women and
ill - mannered men, of exclusive
city clubs and scenic country re
treats, of races on Saturdays and |
the idle rich.
Personally, I've had a surfeit of j
this Hong Kong, with its stuffy so
ciety and ostentatious parade of |
riches. The so-called society life is
in reality nothing more than a con- [
tinuous cocktail party, with bridge, j
mah jong, and poker games thrown
in to relieve the monotony.
But beneath the Hong Kong of 1
glamour is a Hong Kong of suffer- j
ing and want. This Hong Kong owes ;
its existence mainly to the lack of |
immigration control for Chinese na- j
tionals, who pour into the Colony in |
an unending stream.
Crowded City
The profusion of people entering |
the Colony has caused widespread j
unemployment, as well as a serious I
housing shortage. Often two or j
three families have to share a small
cubicle which could hardly house a
single person in comfort. Such bad
living conditions have contributed
much toward the spreading of tu- j
berculosis, which is already taking a
heavy toll of lives, and fabulous I
rentals charged by unscrupulous
landlords add to the general misery.
Closely akin to the Hong Kons of '
suffering and want is the Hong
Kong of crime. Petty thievery is so j
rampant that I am astonished at |
being able to go anywhere without '
being robbed on the way.
It is perhaps with tiilj Hong Kong i
that I am best acquainted. During
the time that I was a crime reporter,
I've had three personal encounters
with pickpockets, and on every oc- I
casion those light-fingered gentle- !

men were able to perform their ex- j
tractions painlessly.
Double Burglary
I've had better luck with burglars,
however. Hong Kong's Bishop's
! House was burglarized twice during j
! the short time I was a guest there, j
i On one occasion I apprehended the
j burglar, but on the other occasion,
; in spite of some spirited help from
I two of South China's most noted
; prelates, the burglar escaped.
But probably the greatest crooks j
j in Hong Kong are those in the po
lice force. Because of the corrup
! tion and racketeering, an Anti-Cor
! ruption Branch of the police had to
j be formed as a check on policemen
| and other government officials.
The efficiency of the police, too,
leaves much to be desired. They
; once engaged a large group of ban
| dits in battle at the China border.
I After two days of furious fighting,
the police returned with their cap
tives —a woman and a pig. The ban
dits had all disappeared.
Cleverest Theft
; But perhaps the "coup dc maitre"
was executed by a young thief who
! stole the clock from the Supreme
Court while the court was in ses
sion. Whi'e the learned justices
| were hearing a case, he just re
moved the clock from the wall and
calmly left.
Sometimes the Hong Kong of
| crime is invaded by the Hong Kong
;of political intrigue. However, po
litical assassinations, which used to
be frequent occurrences before the
war, have diminished. In fact, there
has only been one political assassi
nation since the war, and that oc
| curred just a few months ago.
The Hong Kong of political in
trigue is known only to the initi
, ated. To be a member in this clique,
| one must take part in at least one
1 unsuccessful revolution, or else
have some other person stage a suc
cessful revolution while one is in
power. Failing that, a generous con
! tribution to some "cause" may do
the trick.
American Imitation
In recent years yet another Hong
Kong has arisen—the Hong Kong a
la Hollywood. This Hong Kong is
mainly confined to the younger set
who are trying desperately to ape
the Hollywood version of America.
To them, America is a country of
gaudy sport shirts and screaming
tics, a world of comic books, and a
| universe of movie queens in flimsy
negligees. They have seen fit to
: augment the erstwhile noises of the
Isle of Fragrant Streams with the
l sound of popular songs tunelessly
moaned and hot jazz murderously
played. Whatever misconceptionsof
1 America this Hong Kong holds can-
J not be corrected too soon.

American Imitation
In recent years yet another Hong
Kong has arisen—the Hong Kong a
la Hollywood. This Hong Kong is
mainly confined to the younger set
who are trying desperately to ape
the Hollywood version of America.
To them, America is a country of
gaudy sport shirts and screaming
tics, a world of comic books, and a
| universe of movie queens in flimsy
negligees. They have seen fit to
: augment the erstwhile noises of the
Isle of Fragrant Streams with the
l sound of popular songs tunelessly
moaned and hot jazz murderously
played. Whatever misconceptionsof
1 America this Hong Kong holds can-
J not be corrected too soon.
Hong Kong is a colony of many j
parts, and each part is as different [
and as interesting as another. Prob
ably of all the Hong Kongs, the .
Hong Kong of glamour and romance
is the one visitors see most. That is
the Hong Kong of moonlight and
soft music, of beautiful women and
ill - mannered men, of exclusive
city clubs and scenic country re
treats, of races on Saturdays and |
the idle rich.
Personally, I've had a surfeit of j
this Hong Kong, with its stuffy so
ciety and ostentatious parade of |
riches. The so-called society life is
in reality nothing more than a con- [
tinuous cocktail party, with bridge, j
mah jong, and poker games thrown
in to relieve the monotony.
But beneath the Hong Kong of 1
glamour is a Hong Kong of suffer- j
ing and want. This Hong Kong owes ;
its existence mainly to the lack of |
immigration control for Chinese na- j
tionals, who pour into the Colony in |
an unending stream.
Crowded City
The profusion of people entering |
the Colony has caused widespread j
unemployment, as well as a serious I
housing shortage. Often two or j
three families have to share a small
cubicle which could hardly house a
single person in comfort. Such bad
living conditions have contributed
much toward the spreading of tu- j
berculosis, which is already taking a
heavy toll of lives, and fabulous I
rentals charged by unscrupulous
landlords add to the general misery.
Closely akin to the Hong Kons of '
suffering and want is the Hong
Kong of crime. Petty thievery is so j
rampant that I am astonished at |
being able to go anywhere without '
being robbed on the way.
It is perhaps with tiilj Hong Kong i
that I am best acquainted. During
the time that I was a crime reporter,
I've had three personal encounters
with pickpockets, and on every oc- I
casion those light-fingered gentle- !

men were able to perform their ex- j
tractions painlessly.
Double Burglary
I've had better luck with burglars,
however. Hong Kong's Bishop's
! House was burglarized twice during j
! the short time I was a guest there, j
i On one occasion I apprehended the
j burglar, but on the other occasion,
; in spite of some spirited help from
I two of South China's most noted
; prelates, the burglar escaped.
But probably the greatest crooks j
j in Hong Kong are those in the po
lice force. Because of the corrup
! tion and racketeering, an Anti-Cor
! ruption Branch of the police had to
j be formed as a check on policemen
| and other government officials.
The efficiency of the police, too,
leaves much to be desired. They
; once engaged a large group of ban
| dits in battle at the China border.
I After two days of furious fighting,
the police returned with their cap
tives —a woman and a pig. The ban
dits had all disappeared.
Cleverest Theft
; But perhaps the "coup dc maitre"
was executed by a young thief who
! stole the clock from the Supreme
Court while the court was in ses
sion. Whi'e the learned justices
| were hearing a case, he just re
moved the clock from the wall and
calmly left.
Sometimes the Hong Kong of
| crime is invaded by the Hong Kong
;of political intrigue. However, po
litical assassinations, which used to
be frequent occurrences before the
war, have diminished. In fact, there
has only been one political assassi

j in Hong Kong are those in the po
lice force. Because of the corrup
! tion and racketeering, an Anti-Cor
! ruption Branch of the police had to
j be formed as a check on policemen
| and other government officials.
The efficiency of the police, too,
leaves much to be desired. They
; once engaged a large group of ban
| dits in battle at the China border.
I After two days of furious fighting,
the police returned with their cap
tives —a woman and a pig. The ban
dits had all disappeared.
Cleverest Theft
; But perhaps the "coup dc maitre"
was executed by a young thief who
! stole the clock from the Supreme
Court while the court was in ses
sion. Whi'e the learned justices
| were hearing a case, he just re
moved the clock from the wall and
calmly left.
Sometimes the Hong Kong of
| crime is invaded by the Hong Kong
;of political intrigue. However, po
litical assassinations, which used to
be frequent occurrences before the
war, have diminished. In fact, there
has only been one political assassi
nation since the war, and that oc
| curred just a few months ago.
The Hong Kong of political in
trigue is known only to the initi
, ated. To be a member in this clique,
| one must take part in at least one
1 unsuccessful revolution, or else
have some other person stage a suc
cessful revolution while one is in
power. Failing that, a generous con
! tribution to some "cause" may do
the trick.
American Imitation
In recent years yet another Hong
Kong has arisen—the Hong Kong a
la Hollywood. This Hong Kong is
mainly confined to the younger set
who are trying desperately to ape
the Hollywood version of America.
To them, America is a country of
gaudy sport shirts and screaming
tics, a world of comic books, and a
| universe of movie queens in flimsy
negligees. They have seen fit to
: augment the erstwhile noises of the
Isle of Fragrant Streams with the
l sound of popular songs tunelessly
moaned and hot jazz murderously
played. Whatever misconceptionsof
1 America this Hong Kong holds can-
J not be corrected too soon.
