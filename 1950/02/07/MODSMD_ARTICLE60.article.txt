# Scouts Celebrate 40th Anniversary
## 
### 
Boy Scout Week began yesterday,
marking the 40th anniversary of the [
Boy Scouts of America. Almost two j
i and a half million boys and their
leaders will celebrate the event i
across the nation with pageants, |
I public ceremonies, and displays.
Today the Boy Scouts are at the |
; mid-point of a two-year crusade to j
; "Strengthen the Arm of Liberty" by |
bringing a better scouting program I
to more boys under better trained I
leaders. This effort will reach its !
climax in a great National Jamboree
this summer which will fittingly be :
j held on historic ground — Valley
Forge, Pa.
It was a "good turn" by an un
identified British Boy Scout in 1900
to an American businessman who |
i had lost his way in a London foe
that led to the incorporation of the
J Scouts in America 40 years ago. The j
j late William Boyce, Chicago pub- !
lishcr, was so impressed with the
helpfulness of the British Scout,
; who declined a tip for a "good
I turn." that he accompanied him to
the office of Lord Robert Baden
Powell, founder of Scouting, learned
about the program, and brought a
trunkful of pamphlets to America.
Later he incorporated the organi
zation and with the aid of national
groups interested in youth started
developing the Boy Scouts of Amer
! ica. In the following four decades
over 16 1 •> million American boys
and men have subscribed to the
Scout Oath and Law.
