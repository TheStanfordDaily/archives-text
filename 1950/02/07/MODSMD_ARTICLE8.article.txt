# Juniors Plan March Prom
## 
### 
Plans for the Junior Prom to be
held on March 11 were the main
discussion topic at the last regular
meeting of Junior Excom.
Carol Penney and Phil Neilson
were appointed co-chairmen of the
dance, which will be at the Penin
sula Country Club. Bids will be
kept as reasonable as possible, Ex
com decided, but must necessarily
be limited in number.
The Prom has been separated
from Junior Weekend because the
juniors felt that this quarter needs
social activities more than the usu
ally crowded spring quarter calen
dar. Further details of the Prom
and of the weekend will he an
nounced later.
