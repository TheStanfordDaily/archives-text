# That 'Strange' G.B.S. Defined In Series Talk
##

By ROWLAND REBELE
William Irvine, professor of Eng
lish at Stanford, turned his 50-
minute Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture last night into a sparkling, witty
analysis of the complex character of
one of the world's most talked-about
personalities George Bernard Shaw.
Fresh from the successes of his
recently-published book, "The Uni
verse of G.8.5.," Professor Irvine did
a more-than-adequate job explaining
the one man who "has been ex
plained so much that nobody under
stands him."
Speaking before an audience of
some 800 persons assembled in Me
morial Hall, the lecturer, a specialist
in 19th century English and com
parative literature and thought, be
gan with a swiftly-moving, clipped
sentence characterization of Shaw
his career, his life, and. above all,
his many, many ideas. Witness:
Official Gadfly
" During the first 50 (years of his
life) he was a dangerous revolu
tionary; during the last 41 lie has
been a British institution.
"Shaw is the official British gadfly
and for half a century he has been
buzzing and biting and stinging
furiously. The British public has re
sponded with a prolonged and com
placent horselaugh.
At the present "only 94" years
young and living "1,000 years in the
future," Shaw was described as the
jack-of-a 11-trades of P'nglish aes
thetics, politics, and economics.
He was described as the man with
the "magnificent whiskers, pointed
and Mcphistophelian, which were
first bright red in a white face and
later snow white in a red face."
Shaw On Sewage
lie was described as the man who
was at one minute a convinced Com
munist and at the next a dominating
influence with Sidney Webb in the
popular Fabian Socialist movement;
who was at once a critic of art, mu
sic. and literature; a prolific writer of
plays novels, and pamphlets.
Yet "no man . . . (would) . . . la
bor on obscure committees over
questions of drainage and sewage
just for a joke."
For, Professor Irvine explained,
Shaw is a serious-minded puritan,
romanticist, and rationalist all rolled
into one. When he acts he is a puri
tan, when he criticizes, a rationalist,
and when be philosophizes, both a
romantic and a rationalist.
Irvine Applauded
Illustrating Shaw's great range of
ideas, the lecturer analyzed three of
the subject's less commonly known
plays, "Widower's Houses," "Man and
Superman," and "Heartbreak House."
With the closing sentence, "He
(Shaw) has outlived his Victorian
past. . . . even his future of millen
nial hopes, but not his fame, which Ls
still in the first blush of youth," Wil
liam Irvine's 50-minute explanation
of the "strange" lifo of G.B.S. was
received with a hearty round of ap
plause.
