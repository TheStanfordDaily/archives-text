# RANVEIG DREWRY AT STANFORD
## Coed Describes Norway in Wartime 
### JOAN SEAVER 
Norway is a country of adventur
ers. They arc born of her seafaring
Irarlilion.
Students are adventurers, disap
pearing for three-day walks in I lie
woods around Oslo. The students
formed the underground network in
'44 when Ranvcig Drewry was sent
to safety in neutral Sweden.
'"Everyone lived illegally in Nor
way during the war," Ranvcig said.
Now one of the six ASSU foreign
scholars and far removed from her
native Oslo, she can appreciate how
complex was the wartime machin
ery of resistance.
About 15 radios operated in Oslo
against Nazi orders. Ranvcig helped
distribute reprints of British broad
casts to friends, but some leakage
to the Nazis was inevitable.
In 1944 Ranvcig was inducted into
the web of underground operations
reaching through Sweden and Eng

land and Canada. Ranveig remein
hers now waiting on the tram sta
tion to follow a passer-by who com
mented on the weather to an
apartment that harbored escaping
Norwegians, to a lorry loaded 50
deep, to the edge of the forests.
They crossed to the Swedish fron
tier on foot and not one could rc
j late I lie route even under pressure.
Ranvcig, licr family, and others
j under Nazi surveillance de-loused,
lega'ly queried, and medically ex
j amined were distributed through
j out the network. Ranvcig, three
months short of completing junior
i college, joined 300 other Norwe
gian youths in school.
"I don't think I have ever enjoyed
school as much as those three
months," she said.
Teachers and students, drawn
close by their common exile, stud
ied texts smuggled from Norway.

Some graduates were sent to flight
training in Canada, others to "po
lice camps"—so called because Nor
wegians could not be trained with
Swedish equipment in neutral Swe
den to fight Nazis.
Tin' resistance cost Sweden little
or nothing in money terms. Nor
way's fleet in exile, trading with the
Allies, could turn profits over to
Norway's government, exiled in
London. From there financial sup
port was relayed to Canadian train
ing camps and to the Scandinavian
underground network.
The adventurer runs still through
the three million people of peace
time Norway. The individualism of
licr countrymen, their suspicion of
anything collective, makes it diffi
cult to bring them together. They
realize, she added it is necessary to
collaborate on some level, like gov
ernment, and apparently like the
circumstances of war.

Ranveig's comment on this coun
try was qualified by, "When I say
America I mean Stanford, for that
is all 112 know really. ... ff I have
any fine criticism ii is Hie Amen
cans' impatience with anyone who
is not openly social."
Tlir 23-year-old graduate student
in sociology began her higher edu
cation with wartime training in
child nursing. She progressed lo the
University of Oslo and to Stock
holm's School of Social Sciences.
The specialized school for social
service workers in Stockholm save
her two and a half years of liberal
groundwork in social studies plus
six months of applied case work.
Ranveig's future is undecided.
Norway, she said, offers a financial
risk, no reputation, yet an open
field in sociological research which
might be interesting to explore
There is still the American world
beyond Stanford to investigate.

"I don't think I have ever enjoyed
school as much as those three

Teachers and students, drawn
close by their common exile, stud

Some graduates were sent to flight
training in Canada, others to "po

wegians could not be trained with
Swedish equipment in neutral Swe

Tin' resistance cost Sweden little

Allies, could turn profits over to
Norway's government, exiled in

underground network.

groundwork in social studies plus
six months of applied case work.
Ranveig's future is undecided.
Norway, she said, offers a financial

might be interesting to explore
There is still the American world

Students are adventurers, disap

'"Everyone lived illegally in Nor
way during the war," Ranvcig said.
Now one of the six ASSU foreign
scholars and far removed from her
native Oslo, she can appreciate how
complex was the wartime machin

About 15 radios operated in Oslo
against Nazi orders. Ranvcig helped
