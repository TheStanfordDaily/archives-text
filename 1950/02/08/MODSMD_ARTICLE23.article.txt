# Bridges Speaks In Own Defense
## 'Rank and File' Ran 1934 Strike, Declares CIO Longshore Chieftain 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 7 (AP) —Harry Bridges, testifying in his
own defense for the first time in 49 days of his trial, declared the
rank and file ran the big 1934 longshore strike which the prose
cution charges was Communist-directed.
Recalling the bitterness of that strike idling 30,000 persons,

Bridges said the shipowners have
"changed" since then, but "I haven't
forgiven them."
The Australian-born Bridges, head
p of the CIO Longshore Union, is
» charged with perjury —with lying
when he testified at his 1945 natural
ization hearing that he had never
been a Communist. Conviction could
lead to his deportation.
It was the bitter longshore strike
of 1934 which led to formation of
Bridges' International Longshore
men's and Warehousemen's Union.
~ His testimony today was a careful
buildup by the defense to throw
i down government charges that the
j big strike was Communist-led and
Communist-directed.
c Bridges outlined the strike prepa
rations, the committee organization,
.j and strategy meetings. He described
how locals were formed up and down
I the Coast, how a rank and file refer
j endum was taken, authorizing the
I calling of a strike if the workers' de-
I mands were not met.
"I was chairman of the strike com
j mittee," Bridges testified. "I got the
( job mostly because nobody else
j- wanted it. I've got the minutes yet,
who made the resolutions and just
what was done."
Bridges told how the strike date
was set tentatively for March, and
how the union leaders made one
more effort to see employers. "What,
took place then?" his attorney asked.
"Lot of water has gone—after all,
(he shipowners of that time were the
same ones who appeared up here (a
reference to shipping officials who
appeared as character witnesses for
him). They have undergone a lit
tle change."
"I have forgiven them, too," com
mented chief defense lawyer Vincent
Hallinan.
"I haven't forgiven them," said
Bridges. "That is not the point. They
learned the hard way. Let uS put it
that way—they have changed."
I Bridges said the strike was de
layed until May 9, 1934, after the
union acceded to a request by Presi
dent Roosevelt for a postponement.
When it started, he said, an esti
mated 12,000 to 13.000 longshoremen
e went out With other unions pro
r{ gressively becoming affected, he es
-5 timated 30,000 persons were idle on
s the Coast a month after the strike
j started.
