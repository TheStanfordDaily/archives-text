# Federal Aid to Education
## 
### 
Two prominent California assemblymen de
bated the merits and demerits oi ledeial aid to
education at a NSA panel discussion here Mon
day night. Their points were bolstered by the
opinions ol two Stanford law students, Robeit
Bennett and jack Sinclair.
Principal arguments centered around the
Harden Bill, a proposal now in the Senate which
would provide $300,000,000 a year in govern
merit aid for primary and secondary school edu
' at ion. Incidental argument touched upon Mi.
Truman's request foi $1,000,000 in 1950 for fed
h-ral scholarships to higher education.
Approval of the federal aid was voiced by
Moberi Condon, Democratic assemblyman from
Contra Costa County, supported by Bennett.
Condon argued that the legislation provides for
complete control of aid money by the state.
1 Ie added that the cost meant little in relation
to the benefit gained, and that California, which
would pay out $22,000,000 and receive only
$9,000,000, would neverthelss benefit indirect
*y-
Increased federal control at a loss of local ini
tiative was the criticism of federal aid made by
Richard Dolwig, Republican assemblyman
from San Mateo County. Dolwig said that there
is a tradition in American education which ex
cluded federal control. He emphasized that
control ol schools locally was a prime means of
educating the adults and parents themselves to
their responsibilities in the community.
It was interesting to note from the arguments
of the younger panel members that the stu
dents were more willing to compromise on the
issues involved in federal aid than were their
elders.
before the rebuttals simmered down to a bat

tle ol statistics, as is often the result of argu
ment between lawyers, two basic ideas were
brought out. First was the idea that federal aid
was needed to improve education where stand
aids were low, particularly in the South, lor
the benefit ol the whole nation. The second
was that lederal aid inevitably means federal
control, and federal control means increased
federal power.
Basically, we see the problem as the old ques
tion of individual lights versus general wellare,
both parallel guarantees provided lor by the
Constitution.
We liked the way Dr. Sterling handled the
subject ol federal aid last month when he spoke
before the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
The St .nloid piesident said that proposed gov
ernment financial- aid to elementary and sec
ondary schools is a "permissible use of federal
funds." He also said that he could "also accept
under certain conditions the proposition that
federal funds .should be made available for the
support of education jt the college and univer
sity level."
This stand is not a conservative attempt by a
liberal-minded college president to please the
alumni, as some people might think. We be
lieve that Dr. Sterling's cautious statements
sincerely represented his opinions on federal
aid.
Stanford students are directly concerned
with the problem because they must send a
delegate to the National Student Association
conference this spring. The delegate will be
chosen at a general campus election under the
regulations of the new Stanford NSA progiam.
Federal aid to education will probably be one
of the main issues on which the candidates will
conduct their campaigns.—A.M.

Federal aid to education will probably be one
of the main issues on which the candidates will
conduct their campaigns.—A.M.
Two prominent California assemblymen de
bated the merits and demerits oi ledeial aid to
education at a NSA panel discussion here Mon
day night. Their points were bolstered by the
opinions ol two Stanford law students, Robeit
Bennett and jack Sinclair.
Principal arguments centered around the
Harden Bill, a proposal now in the Senate which
would provide $300,000,000 a year in govern
merit aid for primary and secondary school edu
' at ion. Incidental argument touched upon Mi.
Truman's request foi $1,000,000 in 1950 for fed
h-ral scholarships to higher education.
Approval of the federal aid was voiced by
Moberi Condon, Democratic assemblyman from
Contra Costa County, supported by Bennett.
Condon argued that the legislation provides for
complete control of aid money by the state.
1 Ie added that the cost meant little in relation
to the benefit gained, and that California, which
would pay out $22,000,000 and receive only
$9,000,000, would neverthelss benefit indirect

Increased federal control at a loss of local ini
tiative was the criticism of federal aid made by
Richard Dolwig, Republican assemblyman
from San Mateo County. Dolwig said that there
is a tradition in American education which ex
cluded federal control. He emphasized that
control ol schools locally was a prime means of
educating the adults and parents themselves to
their responsibilities in the community.
It was interesting to note from the arguments
of the younger panel members that the stu
dents were more willing to compromise on the
issues involved in federal aid than were their
elders.
before the rebuttals simmered down to a bat

tle ol statistics, as is often the result of argu
ment between lawyers, two basic ideas were
brought out. First was the idea that federal aid
was needed to improve education where stand
aids were low, particularly in the South, lor
the benefit ol the whole nation. The second
was that lederal aid inevitably means federal
control, and federal control means increased
federal power.
Basically, we see the problem as the old ques
tion of individual lights versus general wellare,
both parallel guarantees provided lor by the
Constitution.
We liked the way Dr. Sterling handled the
subject ol federal aid last month when he spoke
before the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
The St .nloid piesident said that proposed gov
ernment financial- aid to elementary and sec
ondary schools is a "permissible use of federal
funds." He also said that he could "also accept
under certain conditions the proposition that
federal funds .should be made available for the
support of education jt the college and univer
sity level."
This stand is not a conservative attempt by a
liberal-minded college president to please the
alumni, as some people might think. We be
lieve that Dr. Sterling's cautious statements
sincerely represented his opinions on federal
aid.
Stanford students are directly concerned
with the problem because they must send a
delegate to the National Student Association
conference this spring. The delegate will be
chosen at a general campus election under the
regulations of the new Stanford NSA progiam.
