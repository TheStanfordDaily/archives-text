## Wong Articles Draw Student Comment 
### 
To the Editor:
I was overwhelmed by David Wong's article in
Tuesday's paper. However, I am dhsati- ii' d with hi
attitudes and methods of criticism of China and (he
Chinese people, in China and out ol China.
It is my belief that any criticism has to be based
upon constructive purpose. Unless thi constructive
purpose is maintained, it is of no use to reveal either
evil or good conditions.
Mr. Wong's criticism is not constructive. Not only
does he only give one side of the picture, but also he
tears the situation apart without ever pulling il hack
together.
Take, for example, his expose of the conditions in
Hong Kong. What he says is perhaps tiue, but it is
given from his own viewpoint, it is generalized, and
it is one-sided. And it offers no solution to the prob
lems which lie says exist.
Wong's viewpoints do not actually represent lhe
Chinese people's viewpoint. He can't fet'l about the
problems as a Chinese citizen feels, for lie is not a citi
zen. And further, he can not answer those problems
ol China since his knowledge of China i-. only skin
deep.
Technically there Is no fault in Wong's articles
whatsoever; but it would have been much better, if
he had considered what he would have accomplished
by writing the articles. 1 remember he t.uld me that
he has to write because he is majoring in journalism,
because he's a reporter on The Stanford Daily.
J heard not a word mentioned about his trying to
help the people in the East to live arid to think like
human beings, as people in the other parts of this
world do. Instead, Wong goes ahead to reveal what
he thinks, by condemnation and bitter criticism of
problems that exist in the Par East.
it is true that there is a lot of darknesi and under
handed dealing in China. But does thi mean that the
rest of the world is standing on the other extreme? lie
has torn China to pieces and has offered no solution:;
ioi putting China into a better position.
Until he can do this, he will not be able to promote
any good will or understanding between Americans
and Chinese. Nor will he he offering any effective
help to the Chinese in their problems.

To the Editor:
I read of the threats and attacks to which Mr. Wong
has been subjected with consuming interest. My
deepest sympathies go to him fur the injuries in mind
and spirit which he has sustained, and my congratula
tions to him for his resolution to contine his jour
nalistic work even if under duress.
if under duress.
But it seems to me that Mr. Wong's charges are
much too broad in so far as they are substantiated at
all. it is my impression that the "elements" respon
sible for the attack are students from China, it seems,
firstly, to be Mr. Wong's contention that they have
instigated their brutal coercions for no other reason
than Mr. Wong's exposes; and, secondly, that such
habits of procedure are due to their unfortunate up
bringing in a "totalitarian" country.
Regarding the first contention, it is beyond the very
ken of my contemplation that a normal Chinese stu
dent. should base an attack on such an absurd reason.
Notwithstanding the fact that he does not usually
resort to physical violence, Mr. Wong's exposes are
certainly not beyond peaceful criticism in the"letters
to the edilor column." Pardon my directness in saying
that as a Chinese student of social science, 1 find his
real "dope" on China as superficial as the outward
veneer of Chinese big-city "society" which he de
scribes. They are at most amusing and hardly of
serious value to understanding.
The second contention is more serious in nature. It
is an irresponsible charge directed against the whole
Chinese nation. I find the individual actions of a
Chinese national as irrelevant to the whole Chinese
social tradition (which is not. to be exhaustively de
scribed as "totalitarian") as those of an American
gangster to Jefl'ersonian principles. Il seems grossly
unfair to dismiss the issue in gallantry to an inarticu
late and amorphous causation.
In short, I don't think the average Chinese would
can- to even criticize Mr. Wong on the basis of his
writings, and in fairness, he should be more specific
in giving us the train of events surrounding his unfor
tunate experience.

if under duress.
But it seems to me that Mr. Wong's charges are
much too broad in so far as they are substantiated at
all. it is my impression that the "elements" respon
sible for the attack are students from China, it seems,
firstly, to be Mr. Wong's contention that they have
instigated their brutal coercions for no other reason
than Mr. Wong's exposes; and, secondly, that such
habits of procedure are due to their unfortunate up
bringing in a "totalitarian" country.
Regarding the first contention, it is beyond the very
ken of my contemplation that a normal Chinese stu
dent. should base an attack on such an absurd reason.
Notwithstanding the fact that he does not usually
resort to physical violence, Mr. Wong's exposes are
certainly not beyond peaceful criticism in the"letters
to the edilor column." Pardon my directness in saying
that as a Chinese student of social science, 1 find his
real "dope" on China as superficial as the outward
veneer of Chinese big-city "society" which he de
scribes. They are at most amusing and hardly of
serious value to understanding.
The second contention is more serious in nature. It
is an irresponsible charge directed against the whole
Chinese nation. I find the individual actions of a
Chinese national as irrelevant to the whole Chinese
social tradition (which is not. to be exhaustively de
scribed as "totalitarian") as those of an American
gangster to Jefl'ersonian principles. Il seems grossly
unfair to dismiss the issue in gallantry to an inarticu
late and amorphous causation.
In short, I don't think the average Chinese would
can- to even criticize Mr. Wong on the basis of his
writings, and in fairness, he should be more specific
in giving us the train of events surrounding his unfor
tunate experience.

I was overwhelmed by David Wong's article in
Tuesday's paper. However, I am dhsati- ii' d with hi
attitudes and methods of criticism of China and (he
Chinese people, in China and out ol China.
It is my belief that any criticism has to be based
upon constructive purpose. Unless thi constructive
purpose is maintained, it is of no use to reveal either
evil or good conditions.
Mr. Wong's criticism is not constructive. Not only
does he only give one side of the picture, but also he
tears the situation apart without ever pulling il hack
together.
Take, for example, his expose of the conditions in
Hong Kong. What he says is perhaps tiue, but it is
given from his own viewpoint, it is generalized, and
it is one-sided. And it offers no solution to the prob
lems which lie says exist.
Wong's viewpoints do not actually represent lhe
Chinese people's viewpoint. He can't fet'l about the
problems as a Chinese citizen feels, for lie is not a citi
zen. And further, he can not answer those problems
ol China since his knowledge of China i-. only skin
deep.
Technically there Is no fault in Wong's articles
whatsoever; but it would have been much better, if
he had considered what he would have accomplished
by writing the articles. 1 remember he t.uld me that
he has to write because he is majoring in journalism,
because he's a reporter on The Stanford Daily.
J heard not a word mentioned about his trying to
help the people in the East to live arid to think like
human beings, as people in the other parts of this
world do. Instead, Wong goes ahead to reveal what
he thinks, by condemnation and bitter criticism of
problems that exist in the Par East.
it is true that there is a lot of darknesi and under
handed dealing in China. But does thi mean that the
rest of the world is standing on the other extreme? lie
has torn China to pieces and has offered no solution:;
ioi putting China into a better position.
Until he can do this, he will not be able to promote
