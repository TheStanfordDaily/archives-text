# Serenading Tradition
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We think that the tradition of a fraternity sere
nading ii newly-pinned girl is one of Stanford's most
beautiful. The last two serenades that we have heard
have been rudely broken up by the police on the
charge that the boys were disturbing the peace.
We believe that this charge is unjustified, because
the conduct of the toys is not in any way boisterous.
The serenades are not only appreciated by the girl
who has just Ix-en pinned, but by all the other girls
who have (he opportunity to hear it.
I: n't there something that can be done to prevent
police intervention during well-organized serenades?
