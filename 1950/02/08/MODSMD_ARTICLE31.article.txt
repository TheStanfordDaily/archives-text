# Printers Bailey, Kilgore, Kerr Serve As 'Safely Valves' for Rushed 'Dippy' Staff
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The "safety-valve" of The Stan- j
ford Daily doesn't exist in the pen- j '
cil ol a freshman copyreader or
even with the editor himself. It is
personified in the names of Wilber
E. Bailey, Floyd E. Kilgore, and Paul
Kerr--the "typographical tilans" of I
the Daily backshop.
These three men set, assemble, j
and lock up the type which comes j
out in the form of the "Dippy" five
days a week.
Although the printer's job is lo
follow the copy exactly, the two
linotypists and the compositor in the
Daily section of the Stanford Press
have a gift for picking up mistakes
which amateur writers make in
spelling, grammar, and style.
Buzz Editor
Several times each night the
"safety-valves" buzy. for the student j
night editor to ask, "Did this re- |
porter really mean to say 'has,' or I
'have'?"
When it comes to language tech
nicalities, Bailey, the full-time lino
type operator, excels. With an A.B.
degree from San Jose State, expe
rience with the Stanford Press for 25
years, and Spanish and Latin leach
ing experience in near-by Monte
zuma School, the linotypist is tops
at reciting his "no hay deque's."
In J94(J, Bailey's writing talents
were put to use by the Daily sum
mer editor. He inaugurated a col
umn entitled "etaoin shrdlu." These
are the letters which the linotypist
uses to "pi" a line when it is easier
lur him to fill out the line than to
make some corrections. The letters
lie in consecutive order on the key
board, and occasionally find their
way into print, when a careless
printer lails to "kill' (lit- pied slug
of type.
Back in the inky past, Bailey re- ,
calls one .ol the classified ads thai I
somehow slipptd past the staff. It ]
read "Lost—Orange and black girl';; 1
bathing suit."
Caustic Comments
Bailey's column was aided by
what, aji editorial comment called
"caustic sideline comments" from
Floyd Kilgore, the shop foreman.
The job of compositor, which Kil
gore has held since l!) 45, involves
not only setting the advertisements,
making up the pages, and setting
hand - set headlines, but also the
instruction of night editors, who ac
tually plan the dummy make-up.
The third man on the mechanical
side of The Daily i-, Paul Kerr, who
operates a linotype part time. l/il<e
many operators who have a little hit
of the mischievous side in them,
Kerr has sometimes been kidded by
the Daily workers (he'd capitalize
that last "w") for deliberately mak
ing with mistakes. He even claims
j thai the best bull sessions come
j from lettei transpositions in the

type.
During their daylight hours, the
printers have other interests. Kil
gore is building a house, and Bailey
is studying chemistry and geology
at San Jose Stale.
But from 4 p.m. until midnight

they lihle away in the backshop of
The Daily, setting type —and best ol
all, catching errors that the editorial
staff miss.
