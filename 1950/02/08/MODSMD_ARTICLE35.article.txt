## Midweek Musings 
### 
That hotbed of mobsters and two-hit torpedoes, the Greater An
geles area, will dispatch some 25 of its most promising and talented ap
prentices on its semi â€¢annual northern invasion this weekend.
These 25 gansterettes, represented to the outside world as the USC and
UCLA basketball teams, will display their own brand ol bounce-ball for
tin- benefit of Stanford and California hoop fans. What hurts most is that
the boys from the South will be favored to win from their mere sedate, and
certainly more polished, Buy Area opponents. And even worse, the odds
makers are probably right.
Muybe there is a moral to be found in the hardwood success of UCLA
and USC during the past few years. Something to the effect that crime
always pays and skill doesn't.
Itut whatever the moral, whatever the reason, the fact remains that the
two southern schools have consistently beaten teams that are miles out of
tlicit class. They don't manage to do this strictly by means of gangsterism,
I hough that's part of the story. The rest of it is aggressiveness, drive, and
a seeming obliviousness to the fact that they can t play basketball. I'oi
whatever else, they never give up the idead that they can win.
We -saw USC cavort against USF at the Cow Palace two weeks ago. This
was hut a shoit time after the Hill toppers had so completely humiliated oui
Italians; and we weren't entertaining any great love for Pete Newell's prote
ges. Hut after the first few moments' play, when the Dons' superiority in
all departments but height became oh-so-evident, no true lover of the
game could sincerely root for the bungling bouncers from Troy.
The Trojiuis looked as if they had never run a set play in their lives.
At iiiosl points when USC was on the offensive, four men would be occu
pied tangling themselves together in the slot while the fifth wondered
what to do with the ball.
Ail-American Bill Sharman, called by some "the greatest since Luisetti,"
couldn't be stopped. From shooting, that is. But stopped from scoring he
was by Don Loi'gtan, the lad who rightfully deserves most of the Coast
I: udos that are currently going to Sharman.
Sharman is admittedly a good shot. His rebound work is deserving of
praise. Hut as a doorman, a playinaker, he just isn t there. lie isn't clever,
be isn't abnormally speedy, llis main asset seems to be an overwhelming
desire to score: he'll shoot from anywhere, at any tune, and from any
position. Naturally, when he's hot this makes him a valuable man. But a
great player? No.
The rest of the Troy lineup is composed of big boys with lots of hustle
who don't work together very well.
But, and this is the crux, USC battled the Dons on even terms throughout
most of that game. Another night, with Sharman a little warmer, they could
i unceivably lick he Newells.
We're not going to attempt to answer this enigma of the South.
Maybe you can solve it Saturday night.
