# Mitchell in Training As Boxers Await Next Bell
## Lunny Loaded with Heavyweights As Cards Prepare for Santa Clara 
### 
Varsity grid star Emery Mitchell donned hand wraps and started
working out in the Encina Gym boxing room Monday to prepare
himself lor a possible starting berth at heavyweight.
Coach Ray Lunny does not believe Mitchell will be ready to
fight until the second Cal meet, the final contest of the season.

If he does fight against the Berkeley
Bears he will first have to bypass
Dave Oberlin, present No. 1 heavy
weight.
"Mitch" fought one bout last year,
against the same Berkeley squad.
At I hat time he deeisioned heavy
weight, John Groff.
Lost at Cal
Oberlin, champion of the intra
mural tourney, dropped a decision
t.<» Cal's Paxton Beale in the sea
son's opener in Berkeley. The fol
lowing week, against the San Fran
cisco State 'Gators, he TKO'd Jim
Ginella.
To make the heavyweight picture
more confusing, it has been an
nounced that light-heavy Don En
berg will make the trip to UCLA
February 25 to fight the Bruins'
heavyweight. Enberg weighs 178
while the UCLA fighter is reported
to be around 185 lbs.
Enberg has been sparring this
week with his former football team
mute, Mitchell, and working mainly
on fundamentals. Mitchell, weigh
ing 190 lbs. now, is still troubled
with a shoulder injury he received

in Hawaii's Pineapple Bowl but ex
pects to be in good condition for the
Cal meet on March 10.
Broncs Invade
One week from next Friday, on
February 17, the Card boxers will
end their long layoff when they play
host to Santa Clara. Lunny said the
team as a whole is in good shape
and will be in top condition for the
Broncos. Last year Stanford won
to 3M> in a hotly contested
match.
Jack Bickel will probably get the
starting call at light - heavyweight
against the Broncos. Bickel pound
ed his way to Stanford's only vic
tory when he deeisioned Cal's Bill
Kitchin at the beginning of the sea
son, but lost a close decision to Fuz
zy Freschet at S.F. State.
Jim Hammond is still out and will
not be back until the final Cal con
test, if at all. Another loss of the
season has been lightweight Jay
Savage, who found studies too de
manding.

Dave Oberlin, present No. 1 heavy
weight.
"Mitch" fought one bout last year,
against the same Berkeley squad.
At I hat time he deeisioned heavy
weight, John Groff.
Lost at Cal
