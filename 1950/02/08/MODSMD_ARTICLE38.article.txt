# Delts Squeak Past Phi Psis
## 
### 
Delta Tau Delta II eked out a 15
to 12 intramural basketball decision
over Phi Psi II in an encounter that
resembled a football game more
than a cage match. Not only was
the score of football dimensions, but
the fact that eight of the Delts' 15
points came on foul shots gives evi
dence that the game was not with
out its rough moments.
The Phi Psi's held a 5 to 1 lead
after 10 minutes of play. Dave
Fields and Ben Richards put the
Delts back in contention with two
scoring push shots, but a free shot
by Elb Puckett gave the Phi Psi's a
6 to 5 half-time advantage.
Don Gabrielson widened the gap
to 8 to 5 with a 20-foot set shot, but
from there on it was the Delts all
the way as Bob Newell, Greg
Schmidt, Bart Supple, and mates
found their shooting eye.
