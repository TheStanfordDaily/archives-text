# Mermen, SJS Clash Tonight
## Spartans First Test For Favored Indians 
### 
The men of Tom Haynie engage
in the first splash session of their
1950 campaign tonight when they
drive 17 miles southward to meet
San Jose State in the Spartan pool.
The Staters — never highly re
garded in local swim circles —appear
set to suffer through another sea
son in Spartan-like style. It ap
pears that they don't have the wa
ter pistols to throw a scare into the
23-man Indian contingent.
Heavy Participation
Haynie plans to take full advan
tage of the breather and strive for
heavy paritcipation in the meet.
Only five Cards will compete in
more than one event.
In addition, Stanford will insert
an extra four - man relay team,
whose performance will not show
on the scoreboard but merely on the
stopwatch.
A pair of Indians will enter each
event with the lone exception of the
diving, where K;,rl Herrmann will
go alone. SJS has not come up with
a real replacement for Pat O'Con
nell, for four years a top one- and
three-meter performer, and its tra
ditional strength in this department
may also be waning.
Surprising Frosh
Surprises of a very pleasant na
ture continue to come from the
frosh members of the squad. Mel
Smith, never tabbed for greatness
in pre - season calculations, topped
yesterday's workouts with a 23.7
50-yard sprint and a 38.4 three-tap
per.
Haynie clocked the flying frosh at
10.7 and 11.0 in a pair of 25-yard
efforts. Smith is a massively built
athlete wtih limited high school ex
perience and practically no previ
ous instruction in competitive
swimming.
"A real prospect," says Haynie.
Stanford's line-up for tonight:
300 - yd. medley relay — Jack
Weeden, Bob Frojen, and Hub
Stokeley.
30 - yd. freestyle — Bob Wycolf
and Chuck Kelly.

Smith, never tabbed for greatness
in pre - season calculations, topped
yesterday's workouts with a 23.7
50-yard sprint and a 38.4 three-tap
per.
Haynie clocked the flying frosh at
10.7 and 11.0 in a pair of 25-yard
efforts. Smith is a massively built
athlete wtih limited high school ex
perience and practically no previ
ous instruction in competitive
swimming.
"A real prospect," says Haynie.
Stanford's line-up for tonight:
300 - yd. medley relay — Jack
Weeden, Bob Frojen, and Hub
Stokeley.
30 - yd. freestyle — Bob Wycolf
and Chuck Kelly.
220 - y<l. freestyle — Pete Cole,
Bruce Putnam, and Alex Horack.
Divine—Karl Herrmann.
150 - yd. backstroke — Pierre
Hathaway and Weeden.
100 - yd. freestyle—Lloyd Din
kelspiel, Stokeley, and Phil Chap -
man.
200-yd. breaststroke—Russ
telle and Ernie Pohe.
440-yd. freesytle — Junius Mil
lard. 'Don Baruch. and Gerald
< Smith.
400-yd. relay No. I—Rod Mead.
John Mowat, Dinkelspiel. and
Wycoff.
400 - yd. relay No. 2 — Frojen,
Polte, Putnam, and Chapman.
The men of Tom Haynie engage
in the first splash session of their
1950 campaign tonight when they
drive 17 miles southward to meet
San Jose State in the Spartan pool.
The Staters — never highly re
garded in local swim circles —appear
set to suffer through another sea
son in Spartan-like style. It ap
pears that they don't have the wa
ter pistols to throw a scare into the
23-man Indian contingent.
Heavy Participation
Haynie plans to take full advan
tage of the breather and strive for
heavy paritcipation in the meet.
Only five Cards will compete in
more than one event.
In addition, Stanford will insert
an extra four - man relay team,
whose performance will not show
on the scoreboard but merely on the
stopwatch.
A pair of Indians will enter each
event with the lone exception of the
diving, where K;,rl Herrmann will
go alone. SJS has not come up with
a real replacement for Pat O'Con
nell, for four years a top one- and
three-meter performer, and its tra
ditional strength in this department
may also be waning.
Surprising Frosh
Surprises of a very pleasant na
ture continue to come from the
frosh members of the squad. Mel
Smith, never tabbed for greatness
in pre - season calculations, topped
yesterday's workouts with a 23.7
