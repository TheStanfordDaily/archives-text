p.m., received a report of clear
weather at Paso Robles, and went
on.

of Paso Robles, the weather closed
in and visibility dropped to a few
hundred feet.
"First one mountain and then an
other loomed up," Barnes said. "AI
veered away in time. He did some
really magnificent flying."
"When the next mountain ap
peared, he didn't have time to turn.
He just, yanked the stick back as far
as it would go.
"We flipped over on our back and
A1 levelled out," Barnes said, "but
a downdraft caught us and sucked
us into the mountain. We really
plowed in."
Barnes explained how he and
Bletz walked six miles to the ranch
house. Hie rancher drove them to
the hospital in San Luis Obispo.
Bletz' plane, a new all-metal Lus
combe, was completely demolished.
