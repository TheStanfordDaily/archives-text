Hollywood Staging
Tonight's production will be Holly
woodian in more ways than provided
for in the script. The main set, con
structed under the direction of Del
ford Brummer and Gene Callnon,
has been built on a single acting
wagon.
As a result, the whole set, a pro
ducer's office with furniture and
piano alcove, can be moved to the
rear of the stage in less than a min
ute. The second set, hung on ropes
from the ceiling of the stage, is then
dropped into place in several addi
tional seconds.
This new method of staging is being
used for the first time at Stanford.
To Play Off Campus
Lighting for the play has been de
signed by Nancy Langston and is
under the direction of Brvmmer.
Esther Klein is in charge of costum
ing and makeup. Callnon is master
painter of the production.
Performances of "Boy Meets Girl"
have been scheduled for February 25
at the Marines Memorial Auditorium
in San Francisco. One matinee and
one evening performance in San
Francisco will be presented under the
auspices of the Golden Gate Kinder
garten Association Auxiliary. Tick
ets for this production are now on
sale at the City of Paris and the
Marine Memorial box offices.


A COUPLE OF Tin-Pan Alley song-and-dance men try to sell their latest hit, "Pain in My Heart,
And My Heart on My Sleeve," to the Hollywood producer, C. F. Friday (played by Lewis Fosse).
Friday gets ulcers, the writers get fired, the song-and-dance men moan their songs, an aging
cowboy rides to stardom on the diaper-pins of an infant, and the audience gets the lov/down on
Hollywood, as the Stanford Players'production of "Boy Meets Girl" opens tonight in Memorial
Auditorium. â€”photo by Ricardo Corzo
