### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (/P> —In a
sweeping statement of U.S. foreign
policy for the A-bomb age, Secre
tary of State Acheson today rejected
all suggestions for new American
peace appeals to Russia. Instead, he
based this country's anti-Commu
nist strategy squarely on a policy of
power.
Four years of experience, Ache
son told a news conference, "have
brought us the realization" that
progress toward world peace simply
by making agreements with the
Russians is impossible.
But the Soviet government is
"realistic," he .said, and adjusts its
policies when compelled by facts to
do so. Therefore, lie declared,
American basic policy is:
"To build situations which will
extend the area of possible agree
ment, that is, to create strength in
stead of the weakness which exists
in many quarters."
