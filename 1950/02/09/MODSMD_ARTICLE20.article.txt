# Will May Benefit Farm Research
## 
### 
A will granting a share of the
estate of millionaire James L. Flood
of Menlo Park to the American
Heart Association and the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis,
and suggesting that those organiza
tions use the funds for research at
Stanford, was filed yesterday in the
Los Angeles Superior Court.
The will was that of Constance
May Gavin, who received $1,200,000
as a daughter's share in the Flood
estate. Mrs. Gavin obtained the
money in 19.14 in an out-of-court,
settlement of a suit claiming that
she was Flood's illegitimate daugh
ter.
