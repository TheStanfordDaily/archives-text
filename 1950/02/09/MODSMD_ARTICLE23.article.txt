# Cap and Gown, Begun in 1907, Taps Senior Women Leaders
## 
### HOPE JOHNSON 
In 1906, three girls, who were sit -
I ins; on Â« fence, came up with tlie
idea for Cap and Gown.
The t?ii ls. Edith Mirriclces, Hazel
Prd'nr Faulkner, and Nora Dunn
Henley, decided during the course
of their conversation thai there
should he some organization on
campus whose members would he
drawn from the leaders of all ac
tivities which work for the IJnivei
sity in general.
However, because of the earth
quake, actual operation of the or
ganization was postponed until l!' 07
when the three students, advised by
Mrs. Harris J. Ryan, Mrs. John C.
Branncr, and Mrs. C. H. Duniway,
wrote the first of their "many con
stitutions," and firmly established
the society which now has a'most
700 living alumnae.
The purpose of the society lias
since been to draw together under
graduate women interested in vari
ous phases of student activity and
to provide a body for discussion of
various problems that arise in con
nection with student life.
Scholarship
Cap and Gown has given an un
dergraduate scholarship annually

since 1 and in 15)48 added a
scholarship for foreign women.
Among the first recipients of the
foreign scholarships were 'Mai ie
Slakhovitch from France, and Li!ia
A. Villa. The latter, a student from
the University of (lie Philippines in
Manila, integrated herself with
Stanford activities and studied Ihe
housing program at Stanford to aid
in helping the development of dor
mitories planned at the University
of the Philippines.
The chief source of income for the
two tuition scholarships is the Cap
and Gown Stanford Calendar, pre
pared by Cap and Gown itself.
Honorary Members
Present membership in Cap and
Gown is not restricted to student
women; honorary members are se
lected from among faculty women,
and women in the community who
have made a genuine contribution
to the lives of those at Stanford.
Cap and Gown is solely a Stan
ford organization, and has never af
filiated with national honor socie
ties. Since its establishment 4 4
years ago Cap and Gown has car
ried on many activities, and has
contributed in every way toward
bettering Stanford life.
