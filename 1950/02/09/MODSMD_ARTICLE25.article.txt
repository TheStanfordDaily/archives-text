# Library System
## 
### 
This is the first of two editorials 011 Stanford's g
library system. The second part will appear in to- 1
morrow's paper. |
The heart of scholaslic activity seven nights
a week is the Stanford library system. Just as
the Athletic Department has to cope with a
ticket problem and the registrar's office faces
the seat card problem—so the Library must
meet certain problems.
Chief among the 27 University libraries is
the Main Library and its Reserve Book Room.
In the stacks, at the call desk, and in the periodi
cal files there are endless small faults which are
constantly being ironed out by the Library au
thorities.
But, as we see it, there are three basic needs:
1. An extension of the library day to 11 p.m.
2. Simplification of the checking out pro
cedure in the Reserve Book Room.
3. Elimination of extra handling of call slips
in the Main Library.
Most libraries on campus blink their lights at
9:50 p.m. and lock the doors at 10. Only the
Law Library serves its students until 11.
The library officials have indicated a willing
ness to operate library rooms for those students
who want to study late. Over a year ago the

■ library board took action to keep the Reserve
P Book Room open both Saturday and Sunday
nights.
At the time the change was made, F. J. Prid
dle, chief circulation librarian, said it would be
considered worthwhile to keep the library open
on weekend nights if as many as 25 students
took advantage of the opportunity.
We are sure there is a demand especially
among men students or women with extra late
leaves —for a section of the library to remain
open until 11.
Complications would be few. Only one at
tendant would be needed to operate the Re
serve Book Room. The cost, Priddle said, would
be insignificant. The main reference room and
all other sections of the library would be closed
so the nightly clean-up schedule could be
maintained.
The Reserve Book Room seems the logical
place because of its fine lighting and its first
floor location.
Before endorsing such a policy, however,
the library must be assured of the students'
support, either through the Campus Opinion
column or through individual contact with the
librarians.—G.A.
