To the Editor:
What powers of deduction Mr. Ho has! If it is not
powers of deduction, then it must at least be powers
of imagination. From my "elements" he has con
cluded that they must be students from China. From
my "totalitarian regimes" he has concluded that it
must be a totalitarian China.
I quite agree with Mr. Ho when he says that a "nor
mal Chinese student" would not be guilty of attacking
me. For that matter, no one who is normal would be
guilty of such actions. Ergo, the person or persons
involved cannot be normal. It is for that reason that
I have seen fit to say no more about the matter. If
Mr. Ho doubts that such incidents have happened,
and for exactly the reason I have given, then I am
afraid I can do no more to convince him.
Mr. Ho considers the information I have given in
my articles on cities situated in the South China area
are superficial. It must be that Mr. Ho knows more
about the rackets there than I do. In that case, I will
welcome his inside information.
And now to Mr. Chiang. Either Mr. Chiang flatters
me or Mr. Chiang displays a gross naivete of ihe role
of a reporter. Mr. Chiang feels that I should be able
to offer a solution to everything I criticize. 1 mu.st
admit that I am unable to do so. If I criticize cor
ruption, what solution can I offer? The thing is for
men not to be corrupt. I certainly cannot devise a
method of making incorruptible men. If I criticize
the idle rich, what can be done about it except that
the rich stop being idle?
Mr. Chiang also states my viewpoint does not rep
resent the Chinese people's viewpoint. May I ask
Mr. Chiang for the Chinese people's viewpoint? My
viewpoint is that the Nationalist government is cor
rupt, the soldiers are ill-treated, and the people do
not want the Nationalist government in its present
form. Furthermore, my viewpoint is that the Chinese
do not want Communism. The Communist regime is
not much better than the Nationalist regime, and the
Communist government does not represent ihe
Chinese people. 1 have so stated and to the best of

my knowledge, that is also the view of the Chinese
people.
However, Mr. Chiang differs. I am anxiously await
ing his statement on the matter. It seems Mr. Chiang
trifles with words. It may please him to know that I
was born in Hong Kong and am therefore entitled to
both British and Chinese citizenships. He considers
my knowledge of China "skin-deep." If after living
six years in China proper one can only acquire a skin
deep knowledge of China, then I admit, my knowledge
is skin-deep. After all, six years is a short time and
China is a big place.
But perhaps Mr. Chiang should note that very little
of what I have written about China proper is ac
credited to my personal experiences. He will notice
that I have stated my sources, which are usually people
who have spent their entire lives in China. I have only
reported what they have said. If Mr. Chiang cares
to have names and addresses of those persons for veri
fication, I will be glad to supply them to him.
Mr. Chiang also credits to me certain statements to
the effect that the sole purpose of my writing is be
cause I am majoring in Journalism and working for
The Daily. 1 deny that I have ever made such state
ments to Mr. Chiang or to anyone else. If the obliga
tions of a reporter include those which Mr. Chiang
stipulates, then I will certainly not major in Jour
nalism. Instead, I v/ill major in the "Art of Witnessing
Suffering Without Raising a Voice in Protest."
1 am also charged wilh tearing China to pieces. This
too I deny. It is not China that I have lorn to pieces,
for her very soil is sacred to me. It is the evil of certain
regimes in China that 1 have attacked, but Mr. Chiang
obviously cannot appreciate the difference.
Mr. Chiang further claims that I will not be able to
produce any goodwill between Americans and Chinese.
Should not the Americans themselves be the judge
of that? But what, surprised me most in Mr. Chiang's
letter is that he made no mention of my being threat
ened. Is it because he can offer no solution to the stop
ping of such threats that he has made no mention of
them?
