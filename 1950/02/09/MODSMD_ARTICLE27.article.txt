# Student Comment on Wong Incident
## 
### 
To the Editor:
At the onset, I would like to say that I have found
Mr. David Wong's articles very interesting.
A lot of interesting or Ripleyesque things can be
said of any country or continent particularly of Asia.
Mr. Wong believes in writing about these, and leaving
the "nice filings" for the visitor to discover for him
self.
As it is there is considerable misrepresentation of
Asia in American minds stories about Chinese opium
dens and Indian "fakirs" chewing barbed-wire for
inn. 1 cannot see how dwelling on these things, or on
the crooks oi Hong Kong unci the bootleggers of Ma
cao can make Americans think more kindly of Asia.
An American journalist in Asia writing only about
the sex crimes in California or about the burglary at
Brink's Bank is not giving a true picture of America.
I believe that there is still much that is good and
leal and solid about the Orient which needs to be told.
Mr. Wong must give both sides of the picture or
none at all.

To the Editor:
After reading Wong's article we feel that we should
express some of our opinion. We understand defi
nitely that (he accident mentioned in Wong's article
was only his personal dispute with another student.
But Wong's words "certain elements" implied that a
group of people was involved. We request Wong to
clarify this point and make it clear to the public. Wong
should realize what damage he has done the Chinese
people by using his personal dispute for Ills own
publicity.
We disappiove any violent action against freedom
of speech. It is entirely foreign to the Chinese tradi
tion. But we also dislike Wong's attitude and taste in
his articles. Furthermore, we understand that he
stayed only a very short period in China and does not
have good knowledge of Chinese (The fact that he is
taking the first-year course in Chinese here proves it).
We doubt very much if he is qualified to introduce
China to foreigners as a Chinese.
