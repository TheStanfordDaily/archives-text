# Farm Beards Are Growing
## 
### 
Several freshmen have started
growing beards for the beard-grow
ing contest, one ol the events of the
Frosh-Soph Jamboree, but as yet
few sophomores havi* started, ac
cording to Jerry Smith, chairman of
the Jamboree.
"Come on, sophs. Let's really
show up the freshmen and start
growing some beards," urges Keith
Beekman, publicity chairman.
"Although the sophs usually win
and did last year, we can break the
tradition," said Bud Nutting, fresh
man chairman of the Jamboree.
"We'll even have a better chance il
more freshmen enter."
The contest will be judged at the
no-date dance at Austin's Red Barn
Friday night, February 17. Prizes
will be awarded for the longest,
mangiest, and frizziest beards. En
cina barbers will judge the contest,
and give a free shave to the win
ners.
