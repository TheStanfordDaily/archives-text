### BILL SWIGART 
A HANDFUL OF BASKETBALL
NOTES . . .
(1) Elbows, knees, and basket
halls will fly again in the Pavilion
this weekend as USC and UCLA
invade the Bay Area for a resump- !
lion of the Southern Division hoop
derby. And as usual, the boys Irom
the south, who are taught to play
for keeps by their coaches Sam
Barry and Johnny Wooden, are ex
pected to hold the upper hand.
1 suspect the Cards are primed to
take their first in ten from the Tro
jans, and first in five from UCLA,
hut reluctantly doubt if they will.
1 question that the Stanfords are
niched enough to last 40 minutes
against Much burly competition in a i
game that's getting to look less and
less like basketball as the seasons
go by.
After a coupla rounds of moans in
tlit- city papers last year about how
the officials were taking the game
away from the boys by too much
whistle blowing, the coaches and the
officials got their heads together and
agreed to allow a little more free
dom of action under the baskets.
Nothing Skilled
The settlement didn't start any- |
tiling, since a lot of the clubs around
here, particularly the Trojans and
the Bruins, had been fouling pro
miscuously under the buckets all
season anyway. But it did, to an
extent, legalize the homicide that
was taking place on Southern Divi
sion courts since the fouled teams
were robbed of a good many
chances that they should have had j
to even things up from the free
throw line.
I'm not trying to build up any j
kind of a case that this midseason |
change in officiating policy cost j
Stanford the Southern Division |
crown last year, because I don't be- |
lieve that it did. However, I doubt if ;
the team would have fallen apart as I
it did if. the defense had been re- j
quired to keep a closer account of j
its elbows and hands as the Cards j
executed their plays.
The under-the-basket situation is {
something that the coaches' rules j
committee should spend a little I
more time on instead of worrying so |

much about what to do with the last
two minutes. I believe that locked
; arms, held shooting hands, and forc
[ ing opposing players away from the
I rebounds by brute force arc doing
| more to hurt the game than a little
keep-away in the final minutes ever
will.
(2) The controversial two-minute
rule, as it now stands, will probably
be a dead duck at the end of this
season. It's been so effective in shut
ting out the team which is behind
with two minutes to go, that stalls
of eight and ten minutes have be
come the vogue in recent weeks.
10 Minutes
USF pulled a nine-minute stall on
i USC two weeks ago, and last week
end San Jose State didn't take a
shot from the floor for ten minutes
against Bowling Green. Prior to this
season I've seen games in which the
team with a substantial lead has
slowed down the play with intent of
eating up time, but I haven't heard
of many cases in which a team tried
to stall for a quarter of the total
playing time of a game.
The pros, the Big Ten, and the
National Invitational Tourney offi-
I cials have already scrapped the
lliing for this year, and the NCAA
will undoubtedly modify it after the
season is over.
The Big Ten is now awarding two
free throws for every violation in
the last two minutes, and then puts
the ball in play in the customary
manner. It's simple enough, and if
it's working the other conferences
might find it worth investigating.
(3) The officiating at the basket-
I ball games that I've seen this year
| has been lousy. Not so much from
j the standpoint of poorly called fouls,
j because not many games are closely
I called any more, but it's on elemen
! tary things like steps and double
! dribble that too much goes unno-
I ticed. During the St. Mary's game
I Jim Ramstead took three steps be
{ fore dunking a lay-in and he still
[ got credit for a bucket.
The same old howl goes up about
j the same old referees every year.
but it doesn't seem to do any good,
j About all one can do is be philo
sophical and hope that all the mis
| calls even out in the long run.
