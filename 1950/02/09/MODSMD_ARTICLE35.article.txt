# Part Two of How To Play Rugby....

### AL BERRY 
(This is the second of two ar
ticles describing the game of rug
l»y. The first article dealt with the
line (scrum) play — line - outs,
scrumming the hall, and the gen
eral idea of the game.)
Rugby utilizes not four, but seven j
back field men. And while their j
functions are slightly different from |
the game of American football, it is j
possible to point out the football '
equivalents of the rugby backs.
There are five men whose func
tons are similar to that of a half
back. These are the three-quarters
and the five-eighths. The scrum
hall back does for rugby what the :
quarterback does for football. And
then, of course, there is the correla
tion between the rugby fullback and
the football fullback.
'I he scrum half,'like his football
counterpart, is the key man in the j
rugger game. He is the link between j
the scrum (linemen) and the backs.
His duty is not so much to run with
the ball as it is to make sure that
his attacking force has an opportu- i
nity to do so. His is a specialized job i
he's the play maker—and his im
portance cannot be over - empha
sized.
Attacking Force
The attacking force in rugby con- i
sists (jf the three-quarters, the two
iive - eighths, and the two wings, i
These are the men who must carry !
the ball and score the tries (touch- !
downs).
As pointed out in a previous ar- i
tide, there can be no forward pass- j
ing of the ball in rugby, only lat
erals. Thus, any forward progress
ol the ball (other than kicking)
must be -done by running it. Each
member of the attacking force
.strives to run with the ball as far j
as he can, then (when hit by the j
opponents) to lateral it off to one of
the other backs.
To facilitate this, the baekfield
formation sets up on a diagonal j
away from the opponents' goal lne. |
The scrum half gets the ball and |
laterals it to one of the five-eighths, !
who runs with it until he is hit, and

then laterals it to the other five- |
eighths (or whoever is handy). This)
series of laterals—made possible by .
the diagonal line of backs—contin
ues through the three-quarters to
the wings.
Speedsters
The wings are the team's speed
sters and point - makers because j
quite often by the time the wing
gets the ball there is no one left to
lateral to, and he must go the dis 7
tance by himself.
There is, of course, no blocking
allowed in rugby, and—since there
is no such thing as permanent pos
session of the ball—when a back is
tackled before he can lateral, the
ball must be dropped immediately
and is then a free ball.
The fullback, in rugby, is almost i
entirely a defensive player. He is
the safety man—the last man be
tween the opposition and the goal
line. His main ability should be J
punting the ball. He is not usually
expected to run with it, but rather
to punt it out to a safe distance from (
his goal. Since on punts the ball is a ■
"free ball," this is just as advanta
geous as if he were to run 30 yards J
and then be tackled.
Scoring in rugby can be accom- I
plished in any one of five ways. I
Most common is the try, which is j
similar to a touchdown in football. !
A try is worth three points.
Extra Two Points
The conversion after the try must
be kicked any number of yards out
from a point parallel to where the
try was scored. (The try, however,
is not scored at the point where the
player crossed the goal line, but
rather at the point where he
touched the ball down.) The after
point, or conversion, is worth two
points.
A drop kick goal from the field
while the ball is in play is the best
single thing that can be done in
rugby. It scores four points.
A penalty goal is worth three
points. This may happen when the

defending team is ofT-side (i.e., ille
gally in front of the ball) and the
offensive team is awarded a free
place kick. The team awarded the
kick then has a choice of whether to
kick for advantage or for the goal—
depending on the place on the field
where the penalty is called.
Fair Catch
A goal may also be scored from a
fair catch. As in football, a kick
may be "caught fair" without inter
ference. The team making a fair
catch may then have a free kick and
—as in a penalty goal—may either
kick for advantage or for the goal.
This is worth three points.
In international matches the game
is divided into two 40-minute halves
with no substitutions allowed ex
cept for injured players.
In our local more happy-go-lucky
matches, however, there is practi
cally free substitution, and against
some of the nearby clubs, the time is
generally cut clown to 30- or 35-
minute halves.
Oh yes, it is a gay—if confusing—
game to the spectator. This series
of articles has attempted to make
it a bit less confusing to the lay
man. If they have succeeded in do
ing that, all well and good. If they
have not, team captain Mike Spiro
is still available at the Firehouse
for a fuller, more descriltive ex
planation. No crowding, please

Most common is the try, which is j
similar to a touchdown in football. !
A try is worth three points.
Extra Two Points
The conversion after the try must
be kicked any number of yards out
from a point parallel to where the
try was scored. (The try, however,
is not scored at the point where the
player crossed the goal line, but
rather at the point where he
touched the ball down.) The after
point, or conversion, is worth two
points.
A drop kick goal from the field
while the ball is in play is the best
single thing that can be done in
rugby. It scores four points.
A penalty goal is worth three
points. This may happen when the

defending team is ofT-side (i.e., ille
gally in front of the ball) and the
offensive team is awarded a free
place kick. The team awarded the
kick then has a choice of whether to
kick for advantage or for the goal—
depending on the place on the field
where the penalty is called.
Fair Catch
A goal may also be scored from a
fair catch. As in football, a kick
may be "caught fair" without inter
ference. The team making a fair
catch may then have a free kick and
—as in a penalty goal—may either
kick for advantage or for the goal.
This is worth three points.
In international matches the game
is divided into two 40-minute halves
with no substitutions allowed ex
cept for injured players.
In our local more happy-go-lucky
matches, however, there is practi
cally free substitution, and against
some of the nearby clubs, the time is
generally cut clown to 30- or 35-
minute halves.
Oh yes, it is a gay—if confusing—
game to the spectator. This series
of articles has attempted to make
it a bit less confusing to the lay
man. If they have succeeded in do
ing that, all well and good. If they
have not, team captain Mike Spiro

line (scrum) play — line - outs,

eral idea of the game.)
Rugby utilizes not four, but seven j
back field men. And while their j
functions are slightly different from |
the game of American football, it is j
possible to point out the football '
equivalents of the rugby backs.
There are five men whose func
tons are similar to that of a half
back. These are the three-quarters
and the five-eighths. The scrum
hall back does for rugby what the :
quarterback does for football. And
then, of course, there is the correla
tion between the rugby fullback and
the football fullback.
'I he scrum half,'like his football
counterpart, is the key man in the j
rugger game. He is the link between j
the scrum (linemen) and the backs.
His duty is not so much to run with
the ball as it is to make sure that
his attacking force has an opportu- i
nity to do so. His is a specialized job i
he's the play maker—and his im
portance cannot be over - empha
sized.
Attacking Force
The attacking force in rugby con- i
sists (jf the three-quarters, the two
iive - eighths, and the two wings, i
These are the men who must carry !
the ball and score the tries (touch- !
downs).
As pointed out in a previous ar- i
tide, there can be no forward pass- j
ing of the ball in rugby, only lat
erals. Thus, any forward progress
ol the ball (other than kicking)
must be -done by running it. Each
member of the attacking force
.strives to run with the ball as far j
as he can, then (when hit by the j
opponents) to lateral it off to one of
the other backs.
To facilitate this, the baekfield
formation sets up on a diagonal j
away from the opponents' goal lne. |
The scrum half gets the ball and |
laterals it to one of the five-eighths, !
who runs with it until he is hit, and

then laterals it to the other five- |
eighths (or whoever is handy). This)
series of laterals—made possible by .
the diagonal line of backs—contin
ues through the three-quarters to
the wings.
Speedsters
The wings are the team's speed
sters and point - makers because j
quite often by the time the wing
gets the ball there is no one left to
lateral to, and he must go the dis 7
tance by himself.
There is, of course, no blocking
allowed in rugby, and—since there
is no such thing as permanent pos
session of the ball—when a back is
tackled before he can lateral, the
ball must be dropped immediately
and is then a free ball.
The fullback, in rugby, is almost i
entirely a defensive player. He is
the safety man—the last man be
tween the opposition and the goal
line. His main ability should be J
punting the ball. He is not usually
expected to run with it, but rather
to punt it out to a safe distance from (
his goal. Since on punts the ball is a ■
"free ball," this is just as advanta
geous as if he were to run 30 yards J
and then be tackled.

the ball and score the tries (touch- !
downs).
As pointed out in a previous ar- i
tide, there can be no forward pass- j
ing of the ball in rugby, only lat
erals. Thus, any forward progress
ol the ball (other than kicking)
must be -done by running it. Each
member of the attacking force
.strives to run with the ball as far j
as he can, then (when hit by the j
opponents) to lateral it off to one of
the other backs.
To facilitate this, the baekfield
formation sets up on a diagonal j
away from the opponents' goal lne. |
The scrum half gets the ball and |
laterals it to one of the five-eighths, !
who runs with it until he is hit, and

then laterals it to the other five- |
eighths (or whoever is handy). This)
series of laterals—made possible by .
the diagonal line of backs—contin
ues through the three-quarters to
the wings.
Speedsters
The wings are the team's speed
sters and point - makers because j
quite often by the time the wing
gets the ball there is no one left to
lateral to, and he must go the dis 7
tance by himself.
There is, of course, no blocking
allowed in rugby, and—since there
is no such thing as permanent pos
session of the ball—when a back is
tackled before he can lateral, the
ball must be dropped immediately
and is then a free ball.
The fullback, in rugby, is almost i
entirely a defensive player. He is
the safety man—the last man be
tween the opposition and the goal
line. His main ability should be J
punting the ball. He is not usually
expected to run with it, but rather
to punt it out to a safe distance from (
his goal. Since on punts the ball is a ■
"free ball," this is just as advanta
geous as if he were to run 30 yards J
and then be tackled.
Scoring in rugby can be accom- I
plished in any one of five ways. I
Most common is the try, which is j
similar to a touchdown in football. !
A try is worth three points.
Extra Two Points
The conversion after the try must
be kicked any number of yards out
from a point parallel to where the
try was scored. (The try, however,
is not scored at the point where the
player crossed the goal line, but
rather at the point where he
touched the ball down.) The after
point, or conversion, is worth two
points.
A drop kick goal from the field
while the ball is in play is the best
single thing that can be done in
rugby. It scores four points.
A penalty goal is worth three
points. This may happen when the

defending team is ofT-side (i.e., ille
gally in front of the ball) and the
offensive team is awarded a free
place kick. The team awarded the
kick then has a choice of whether to
kick for advantage or for the goal—
depending on the place on the field
where the penalty is called.
Fair Catch
A goal may also be scored from a
fair catch. As in football, a kick
may be "caught fair" without inter
ference. The team making a fair
catch may then have a free kick and
—as in a penalty goal—may either
kick for advantage or for the goal.
This is worth three points.
In international matches the game
is divided into two 40-minute halves
with no substitutions allowed ex
cept for injured players.
In our local more happy-go-lucky
matches, however, there is practi
cally free substitution, and against
some of the nearby clubs, the time is
generally cut clown to 30- or 35-
minute halves.
Oh yes, it is a gay—if confusing—
game to the spectator. This series
of articles has attempted to make
it a bit less confusing to the lay
man. If they have succeeded in do
ing that, all well and good. If they
have not, team captain Mike Spiro
is still available at the Firehouse
for a fuller, more descriltive ex
planation. No crowding, please

ticles describing the game of rug
l»y. The first article dealt with the
line (scrum) play — line - outs,
scrumming the hall, and the gen
eral idea of the game.)
Rugby utilizes not four, but seven j
back field men. And while their j
functions are slightly different from |
the game of American football, it is j
possible to point out the football '
equivalents of the rugby backs.
There are five men whose func
tons are similar to that of a half
back. These are the three-quarters
and the five-eighths. The scrum
hall back does for rugby what the :
quarterback does for football. And
then, of course, there is the correla
tion between the rugby fullback and
the football fullback.
'I he scrum half,'like his football
counterpart, is the key man in the j
rugger game. He is the link between j
the scrum (linemen) and the backs.
His duty is not so much to run with
the ball as it is to make sure that
his attacking force has an opportu- i
nity to do so. His is a specialized job i
he's the play maker—and his im
portance cannot be over - empha
sized.
