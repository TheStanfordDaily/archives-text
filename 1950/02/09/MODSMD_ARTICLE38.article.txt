# Bruin Cagers Arrive This P.M.; Cards Plot Crawling Offense
## 
### 
UCLA's 1G - man cage squad is
; scheduled to plane into Palo Alto
' late this afternoon and bunk in at
the President Hotel.
Otherwise, there's nothing new on
. the hoop front. Stanford continues
i to divide its practice sessions into
i two types of defense and one style
of offense.
The defense splits into zone and
| man - to - man, with it being any
body's guess as to which will be
[ used this weekend.
The offense will be slow. Better

i than that, it'll crawl. Everett Dean
hopes to quiet the Bruin speed with
such methods, and his guards will
I be using close to the 10-second lim
it each time they bring the ball
| down court.
John Wooden's Bruins will prob
ably take a light workout on the
Pavilion floor tomorrow morning.
| However, they won't swing into
high gear until tomorrow night
| when they'll start swinging at the
| Tribe in a two-game southland se
; ries. USC will work Saturday night.
But, it's the Bruins who have all
I the press clippings. Having romped
I to a 15-4 season record, the West
j wood scramblers are presently rated
I by the Associated Press as the 13th
| best team in the nation, and have
i been tabbed Citation favorites to re-
I peat last season's Southern Division
I championship.
UCLA comes north on the crest
of the greatest scoring splurge in
j Bruin history. Last week found the
I Wooden Wonders racking up a 93-43
win over Fresno State and a 7G-64
decision over Santa Clara to stretch
the UCLA home gym victory string
to 23 in the last two seasons.
UCLA established a new school
scoring record with their 93-point
onslaught against the poor Fresno
! kids. The 50-point margin of victory
I was also a new Bruin mark,
j Wooden had his fast break work
-1 ing at its fastest these days. His
boys have averaged G0.6 points for
the last seven tilts. That's just one
| of the little items which have con
i vinced Dean he has to slow down
j the pace.
A 1 Sawyer, the six-foot-five San
J Pedro sharpshot, is tops in the Uc
j lan digit department. In 19 tries
j he's whipped out 234 points for an
| average of 12.5.

UCLA's 1G - man cage squad is
; scheduled to plane into Palo Alto
' late this afternoon and bunk in at
the President Hotel.
Otherwise, there's nothing new on
. the hoop front. Stanford continues
i to divide its practice sessions into
i two types of defense and one style
of offense.
The defense splits into zone and
| man - to - man, with it being any
body's guess as to which will be
[ used this weekend.
The offense will be slow. Better

i than that, it'll crawl. Everett Dean
hopes to quiet the Bruin speed with
such methods, and his guards will
I be using close to the 10-second lim
it each time they bring the ball
| down court.
John Wooden's Bruins will prob
ably take a light workout on the
Pavilion floor tomorrow morning.
| However, they won't swing into
high gear until tomorrow night
| when they'll start swinging at the
| Tribe in a two-game southland se
; ries. USC will work Saturday night.
But, it's the Bruins who have all
I the press clippings. Having romped
I to a 15-4 season record, the West
j wood scramblers are presently rated
I by the Associated Press as the 13th
| best team in the nation, and have
i been tabbed Citation favorites to re-
I peat last season's Southern Division
I championship.
UCLA comes north on the crest
of the greatest scoring splurge in
j Bruin history. Last week found the
I Wooden Wonders racking up a 93-43
win over Fresno State and a 7G-64
decision over Santa Clara to stretch
the UCLA home gym victory string
to 23 in the last two seasons.
UCLA established a new school
scoring record with their 93-point
onslaught against the poor Fresno
! kids. The 50-point margin of victory
I was also a new Bruin mark,
j Wooden had his fast break work
-1 ing at its fastest these days. His
boys have averaged G0.6 points for
the last seven tilts. That's just one
| of the little items which have con
i vinced Dean he has to slow down
j the pace.
A 1 Sawyer, the six-foot-five San
J Pedro sharpshot, is tops in the Uc
