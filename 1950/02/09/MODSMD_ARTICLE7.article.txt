# New Plans Presented For Farm Students To Rate Professors
## 
### ART HENRY 
Excom received plans last night for a proposed faculty rating
system. The plans were contained in the report of the joint Excom-
NSA Committee investigating the system.
ASSU President Hank Rosin presented the report, and said,
"We are getting close to acceptance of the system, and it will be
quite a milestone if it is installed." ♦

The committee's plan and report
arc the result of study and experi
ment of rating of faculty members
made by the committee with the co
operation of the Stanford faculty.
Faculty rating at Stanford has been
conducted for several years by a
number of faculty members on their
own initiative.
Effective System
At the national convention of NSA
last summer, Stanford delegates
heard of the effectiveness of the rat
ing system as it is conducted in sev
eral other universities.
Last fall the special committee,
consisting of Genevieve McDuffic and
John Marin and the faculty rating
committee of the NSA, headed by
Mary Kilbourne, drafted a rating
blank and discussed the value of such
a system with members of the fac
ulty and Administration.
A trial of the rating system was
conducted last quarter in order to
get faculty and student opinion re
garding the program and to discover
how valid the blank itself would be.
The sample rating blank was used j
in 1!) classes, including 12 Western j
Civ classes, and filled out by 1,250
students.
Results of the trial study were I
I compiled by the committee and sub
mitted to the faculty members in
volved. The committee asked the in
structors for a report of their opinion
j of the sturly.
Strictly Confidential
Miss Kilbourne explained that the
j system as it was tried last quarter
[ was voluntary for the instructors.
| The compiled results were confiden- j
tial, the members of the committee j
i reporting them directly to each pro- j
| fessor.
"As things are now," Miss Kil
bourne said, "students arc continu- ;
ally rating their professors—over the j
lunch table. We feel that students, j
even with their limited knowledge j
! of teaching problems, have good ideas j
about improving their courses. The
problem is to channel their ideas to j
the people who can use them."
The blank used in the trial study i
; rated instructors according to: pre- j
I scntation of subject, organization of |
I subject, intellectual stimulation, j
level of instruction, tests, attitude i
toward students, bias.
Rosin said the Administration has
j agreed to pay half the cost of ma
terials for the system.
To Each Department
The plan will be submitted to the j
heads of the various schools and de- j
partments this quarter for discussion
and recommendations of their execu
tive councils. '
Rosin and Timmie Lcvison, NSA
co-ordinator for Stanford, assisted in
planning the system.
Miss Kilbourne emphasized the j
! following points:
1. I lie rating system will be of J
h«dp only if students maintain a i
const inctive <*• ttitudc.
2. The instructor's achievement in
! making the course interesting should
j be considered, and not his personal- j
; ity
.'s. The student ratings will have no
; effect on the faculty member's salary j
or position.
i 4. Compiled results of the ratings
i will be lor the use of the faculty |
I only, in helping them offer better in—
| struction.

John Marin and the faculty rating
committee of the NSA, headed by
Mary Kilbourne, drafted a rating
blank and discussed the value of such
a system with members of the fac
ulty and Administration.
A trial of the rating system was
conducted last quarter in order to
get faculty and student opinion re
garding the program and to discover
how valid the blank itself would be.
The sample rating blank was used j
in 1!) classes, including 12 Western j
Civ classes, and filled out by 1,250
students.
Results of the trial study were I
I compiled by the committee and sub
mitted to the faculty members in
volved. The committee asked the in
structors for a report of their opinion
j of the sturly.
Strictly Confidential
Miss Kilbourne explained that the
j system as it was tried last quarter
[ was voluntary for the instructors.
| The compiled results were confiden- j
tial, the members of the committee j
i reporting them directly to each pro- j
| fessor.
"As things are now," Miss Kil
bourne said, "students arc continu- ;
ally rating their professors—over the j
lunch table. We feel that students, j
even with their limited knowledge j
! of teaching problems, have good ideas j
about improving their courses. The
problem is to channel their ideas to j
the people who can use them."
The blank used in the trial study i
; rated instructors according to: pre- j
I scntation of subject, organization of |
I subject, intellectual stimulation, j
level of instruction, tests, attitude i
toward students, bias.
Rosin said the Administration has
j agreed to pay half the cost of ma
terials for the system.
To Each Department
The plan will be submitted to the j
heads of the various schools and de- j
partments this quarter for discussion
and recommendations of their execu
tive councils. '
Rosin and Timmie Lcvison, NSA
co-ordinator for Stanford, assisted in
planning the system.
Miss Kilbourne emphasized the j
! following points:
1. I lie rating system will be of J
h«dp only if students maintain a i
const inctive <*• ttitudc.
2. The instructor's achievement in
! making the course interesting should
j be considered, and not his personal- j
; ity
.'s. The student ratings will have no
; effect on the faculty member's salary j
or position.
i 4. Compiled results of the ratings
i will be lor the use of the faculty |
I only, in helping them offer better in—
| struction.
Excom received plans last night for a proposed faculty rating
system. The plans were contained in the report of the joint Excom-
NSA Committee investigating the system.
ASSU President Hank Rosin presented the report, and said,
"We are getting close to acceptance of the system, and it will be
quite a milestone if it is installed." ♦

The committee's plan and report
arc the result of study and experi
ment of rating of faculty members
made by the committee with the co
operation of the Stanford faculty.
Faculty rating at Stanford has been
conducted for several years by a
number of faculty members on their
own initiative.
Effective System
At the national convention of NSA
last summer, Stanford delegates
heard of the effectiveness of the rat
ing system as it is conducted in sev
eral other universities.
Last fall the special committee,
consisting of Genevieve McDuffic and
John Marin and the faculty rating
committee of the NSA, headed by
Mary Kilbourne, drafted a rating
