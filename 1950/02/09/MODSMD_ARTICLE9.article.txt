# Excom Moves To Streamline Proceedings
## 
### 
Excom took steps last night to
speed up its weekly Wednesday
night meetings by holding a "pre-
Exeom" session Monday nights to
discuss pending issues. The speed
up program was suggested by ASSU
President Hank Rosin at the outset
of the meeting.
By the end of the session, four is
sues were tabbed for discussion at
the first preliminary meeting Mon
day at 8 p.m.
Rosin requested that all by-laws be
reviewed by the by-law committee
and individual copies of the pro
posals be presented to each Excom
member for study. He said that pro
posals brought up at the meetings
will he tabled for future study and
consideration.
A proposed by-law presented by
Rosin requiting the publication of
the number, location and hours of
polling booths at elections fell one
vote short of passing. Gregg Bo
mis, men's hall representative, voiced
the dissenting vote of the 11-l tally.
Bern is objected on the grounds that
the by-law would lead to mass lob
bying in Excom for polling places
and locations the week before elec
tions.
Kay Wold, women's halls, ab
stained. Two members were absent.
Rosin said the proposition would
be brought up again next week after
discussion at the first "prc-Excom"
meeting.
Excom tabled a proposal sug
gested by Daily Editor Jack Little,
ex-officio member, which would
make honor code violators and per
sons convicted of misusing ASSU of
fices ineligible for Council positions.
Little said that past. Men's Council
members had supported his belief
that such offenders were incapable
of judging the offenses of their fel
low students.
Excom turned down a similar pro
posal last spring.
Excom voted to send to a special
committee a proposal by Rosin that
all executive committee officers
elect be required to attend Excom
meetings between the time of their
election and taking office. Excom
members sought a compromise, feel
ing that the requirement would make
late spring meetings too crowded.
Discussion on a salary plan for
ASSU president was held over for
the "pre-Excom" meeting.
Block letters were awarded foot
ballers Eric Southwood, Marv Mel
loway. and Bob Griffin, who qualified
after the Honolulu game.
Technical NSA by-law changes
were approved. Changes in Ram's
Head and Concert Series by-laws
were tabled for further study.
