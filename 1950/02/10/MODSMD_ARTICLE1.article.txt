## Lewis Demands Illegal 
### 
WASHINGTON, IJcb. U </P) A
federal judge labeled four of John
L, Lewis' major contract demands
illegal today and drafted an injunc
tion against them, but the riding
does not halt the nationwide soft
coal strike.
A fact - finding board meanwhile
rushed work on its report to Presi
dent Truman. When lie gets it, he
can go into federal court and ask for
an injunction ordering the 370,000
striking miners back to work for HO
days. Mr. Truman is expected to act
next week. Failure to comply with
such an injunction would be pun
ishable by fines or even jail terms.
