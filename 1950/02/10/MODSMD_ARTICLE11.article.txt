LAKE LAGUNITA, Stanford's part-time lake, is now filled to
within two and one-half feet of the top and will be maintained
at that level as long as possible. The unusually heavy rainfall
during the past two months has brought Ihe lake up to capacity
early in the season. The ASSU will declare it open for swim
ming and boating as soon as the weather warms up. When
Lake Lagunita is opened for swimming, life guards are on duty
at the Boathouse at all times. — Daily photo by Jack Sheen
