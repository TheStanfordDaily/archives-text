# Water Spouts High At Serra and Galvez
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
Competing willi (lie rain and de
lighting passers-by, a giant column
of water shot through the- pavement
at Serra and Galvez streets yester
day afternoon, and lifted rocks,
mud, and aspha't 50 feet into air.
The geyser apparently came about
when one of the mains in the Uni
versity's irrigation system burst.
Starting as a small, bubbling pool
around 5:20 p.m., the water gained
force as it ate away the pavement
and within 10 minutes had become
a roaring gusher.
For nearly *a half-hour it spewed

forth an estimated 10,000 gallons of
dirty water. Spectators as far away
as the stadium saw it tower near the
tree-tops. A crowd surrounded the
geyser. Encina men tried to fill
water bags.
Calmed by 5:50 p.m.
At fcTiO p.m., men from the Uni
versity plumbing shop shut off the
water in the mains, and the turbu
lent spout withered back into a
quiet pool.
Fire Chief John Mansion ex
plained that the water column was
caused by a break in either an
8-inch or a 12-inch pipe. "I don't
think the hole was very large," he
said, "because the pressure gauge
at the Firehouse only went down to
70 pounds" (100 pounds is normal).
With fairly high pressure still in
the mains, the chief pointed out, it
would require a small hole to send
up the Column which was estimated
by some to be 75 feet high.
Officer Carter Spots Geyser
One of the first to sec the erup
tion was Officer George Carter of
the Stanford Police Department. At
about 5:20 p.m., Carter, in his car,
noticed a gurgling puddle in a small
chuck-hole. Surmising trouble in
the mains, be radioed the police sta-
tion.
Meanwhile, Fire Chief Marston
strolled into the police station after
noticing the drop in pressure.
Said Police Chief Gordon Davis,
"One of our men just reported a
break in the mains at Serra and
Galvez."
Said Chief Marston, "Let's get
hold of the plumbing shop."
By this time, however, many peo
ple had notified the plumbing shop,
By this time also, the gusher had
grown. Shooting at an angle, it was
raining pebbles and "rocks as big as
a man's head" on a parked car.
Spectators Held Back
Bystanders tried to move the car,
but Officer Carter deterred them,
fearing for their heads.
The crowd gathered, reveled in
the novelty, and directed traffic.
When Ted Lav/son of the plumb
ing shop shut off the water in the
mains, the geyser died and the
crowd dispersed. Officer Carter set
up a barricade around the hole in
the pavement, now about seven by
three feet large.
An hour later, only a square of
white sawhorses, lighted by four
flares, marked the spot.

the mains, the chief pointed out, it
would require a small hole to send
up the Column which was estimated
by some to be 75 feet high.
Officer Carter Spots Geyser
One of the first to sec the erup
tion was Officer George Carter of
the Stanford Police Department. At
about 5:20 p.m., Carter, in his car,
noticed a gurgling puddle in a small
chuck-hole. Surmising trouble in
the mains, be radioed the police sta-
tion.
Meanwhile, Fire Chief Marston
strolled into the police station after
noticing the drop in pressure.
Said Police Chief Gordon Davis,
"One of our men just reported a
break in the mains at Serra and
Galvez."
Said Chief Marston, "Let's get
hold of the plumbing shop."
By this time, however, many peo
ple had notified the plumbing shop,
By this time also, the gusher had
grown. Shooting at an angle, it was
raining pebbles and "rocks as big as
a man's head" on a parked car.
Spectators Held Back
Bystanders tried to move the car,
but Officer Carter deterred them,
fearing for their heads.
The crowd gathered, reveled in
the novelty, and directed traffic.
When Ted Lav/son of the plumb
ing shop shut off the water in the
mains, the geyser died and the
crowd dispersed. Officer Carter set
up a barricade around the hole in
the pavement, now about seven by
three feet large.
An hour later, only a square of
white sawhorses, lighted by four
flares, marked the spot.
Competing willi (lie rain and de
lighting passers-by, a giant column
of water shot through the- pavement
at Serra and Galvez streets yester
day afternoon, and lifted rocks,
mud, and aspha't 50 feet into air.
The geyser apparently came about
when one of the mains in the Uni
versity's irrigation system burst.
Starting as a small, bubbling pool
around 5:20 p.m., the water gained
force as it ate away the pavement
and within 10 minutes had become
a roaring gusher.
For nearly *a half-hour it spewed

forth an estimated 10,000 gallons of
dirty water. Spectators as far away
as the stadium saw it tower near the
tree-tops. A crowd surrounded the
geyser. Encina men tried to fill
water bags.
Calmed by 5:50 p.m.
At fcTiO p.m., men from the Uni
versity plumbing shop shut off the
water in the mains, and the turbu
lent spout withered back into a
quiet pool.
Fire Chief John Mansion ex
plained that the water column was
caused by a break in either an
8-inch or a 12-inch pipe. "I don't
think the hole was very large," he
said, "because the pressure gauge
at the Firehouse only went down to
70 pounds" (100 pounds is normal).
With fairly high pressure still in
the mains, the chief pointed out, it
would require a small hole to send
up the Column which was estimated
by some to be 75 feet high.
