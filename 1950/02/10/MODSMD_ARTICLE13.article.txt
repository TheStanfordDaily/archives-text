# AWS to Consider Women's Campus Housing Problem
## 
### 
The problem of women's housing
will be discussed by the AWS Cab
inet soon, since there have been
quite a few complaints on the sys
tem.
Housing Committee will examine
the situation and will biit'g the facts
to the AWS Cabinet, which will try
to set a definite policy.
Diane Power, president of AWS,
urged cabinet members to realize
that the women arc not assuming as
much responsibility in this field as
they can. The administration took
over their duties of policy-making
when the sororities were abolished.
There was lively discussion as to
whether this problem should be
brought up at the YWCA Student
Workshop, to be held next weekend,
or whether il should be kept in
AWS. Il was decided that il should
he discussed in AWS Cabinet meet
ings. ,
AWS delegates lo Ihe Student
Workshop will propose four topi.:,
of discussion: all-campus drives, an
AIMS for men representing all men's
living groups, more emphasis on
summer quarter activities, and ex
penditures on bouse dues and floats.
