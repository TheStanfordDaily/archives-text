# Last Chance --- Brums Invade Farm Tonight, Troy Here Tomorrow
## Cards Must Win To Remain In Conference Rate 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford, with its back to the
wall and one foot in the cellar,
will go after UCLA's league
leading cage champs tonight on
the home hardwood.
It will mark the beginning of a
last ditch stand for the Cams who
must face the other league leaders,
USC's Sharman-led Trojans, tomor
row night in the same barn.
Referee Lloyd Leith will open
things tonight with an 8:30 tipo.'T,
moved back a half-hour to make way
for the KPIX television cameras. To
morrow night's USC starting time
will be at the regular 8, with no
television.
Stanford Frosh and San Francis
co's Mission High will mix it up in
tonight's 6:45 prelim. Tickets for both
varsity games are still on sale in the
SAC booth.
Last Chance
Everett Dean's Indians will go into
tonieht's Bruin battle knowing that it
will be their last chance to salvage
at least a look-in during the remain
der of the Southern Division racc.
They will also be gunning for
their first win in five tries against
UCLA, which has run up 15 wins
in 19 starts, is rated 13th in the
nation by the Associated Press, and
which already owns one 71-55 vic
tory over Stanford already this
season.
Having established a new school
scoring record against Fresno State
(93-43) and knocking out their 24th
straight win in their own gym against
Santa Clara last weekend, John
Wooden's Bruins come to the Farm
in the middle of a fast-flinging scor
ing spree.
It will be Stanford's job to slow
down the pace. Practice sessions thi.
week have been devoted to the task
of setting up an adequate defense to
reduce UCLA's 70-point average for
the past seven games.

well pleased with the three sharp

Stanford could conceivably turn in
a much better job in its own gym
than it did in Los Angeles last Janu

Stanford, with its back to the
wall and one foot in the cellar,
will go after UCLA's league
leading cage champs tonight on
the home hardwood.
It will mark the beginning of a
last ditch stand for the Cams who
must face the other league leaders,
USC's Sharman-led Trojans, tomor
row night in the same barn.
Referee Lloyd Leith will open
things tonight with an 8:30 tipo.'T,
moved back a half-hour to make way
for the KPIX television cameras. To
morrow night's USC starting time
will be at the regular 8, with no
television.
Stanford Frosh and San Francis
co's Mission High will mix it up in
tonight's 6:45 prelim. Tickets for both
varsity games are still on sale in the
SAC booth.
Last Chance
Everett Dean's Indians will go into
tonieht's Bruin battle knowing that it
will be their last chance to salvage
at least a look-in during the remain
der of the Southern Division racc.
They will also be gunning for
their first win in five tries against
UCLA, which has run up 15 wins
in 19 starts, is rated 13th in the
nation by the Associated Press, and
which already owns one 71-55 vic
tory over Stanford already this
season.
Having established a new school
scoring record against Fresno State
(93-43) and knocking out their 24th
straight win in their own gym against
Santa Clara last weekend, John
Wooden's Bruins come to the Farm
in the middle of a fast-flinging scor
ing spree.
It will be Stanford's job to slow
down the pace. Practice sessions thi.
week have been devoted to the task
of setting up an adequate defense to
reduce UCLA's 70-point average for
the past seven games.
