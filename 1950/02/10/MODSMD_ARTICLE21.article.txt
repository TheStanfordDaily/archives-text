## 
### 
"Like the vacuum salesman with
his foot in the door, you'll have to
get in there and pitch."
This is what Fred Glover, Direc
tor of Information, told 120 Red Cross
solicitors at a meeting yesterday in
the Women's Clubhouse. The meet
ing was a rally in peparation for the
campus Red Cross drive, to be held
Monday through Friday next week.
The campus goal is $4,000.
Glover's statement carried the re
minder that. Stanford has failed to
meet its goal the last two years, prin
cipally because of the large off
campus enrollment. The quota was
set after taking this difficulty into
consideration.
Glover cited instances of Red Cross
help to Stanford veterans whose sub
sistence allowances failed to come,
and spoke of other home services to
students.
fie emphasized the importance oj
the solicitors, not only in helping the
Red Cross, but in promoting the pub
lic relations of the University
through this kind of civic partici
pat ion
Mrs. Peggy Hogan. assistant field
director at the Palo Alto Veterans
Hospital, spoke of her work with
mental patients there and of her ac
tivities in India with the Red Cross
during the war.
She said that perhaps the most im
portant thing which the which the

Red Cross did in connection with the
patients was simply in coming to
see the men. This contact, Mrs. Ho
gan feeLs, is vital to the men because
it persuades them that they are not
rejected by the community."
Red Cross services at the hospital
include scenic drives, hostessing, arts
and crafts work, providing surgical
dresings, and aqu~therapy.
Jo Lyon, chairman of the campus
drive, gave representatives of the
living groups directions to follow in
collecting donations. Marge Gavin is
treasurer for the drive.
