# New Chaparral Due Wednesday
## 
### 
Arc the 'twenties really staging a
comeback? Or Ihe 'thirties? Or the
'forties?
The Chaparral will answer that
question in the February issue, due
to reach students Wednesday. A
four-page spread will review tlie
past three decades, with their fash
ions. fads and popular idols, and
entertainment, and make some
alarming predictions for the 'fifties.
The spread is the work of the
staff of Stanford's humor rac. with
cartoons by a new artist, Ted Field
ing.
And whi'e the Old Boy was gaz
ing into his crystal ball, he also
came up with some speculations on
the future of the fourteenth of Feb
ruary, in answer to the heart-burn
ing question, "Is Valentine's Day
doomed to become another Christ
mas?"
Remember, i< .s on the stands
Wednesday.
