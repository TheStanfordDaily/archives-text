# Faculty Rating System
## 
### 
The faculty rating system now being con
sidered lor use at Stanford merits serious con
sideration.
faculty rating is not a new idea. Heed Col
lege, Pomona, Cal Tech, and the University of
'Washington are among the many universities
using the system to good advantage.
We believe the system could serve here, as
elsewhere, to improve student-faculty relations,
as a co-operative basis for the process of learn
nig..
Instructors.make constiuctive criticisms of
their students' woik so that these students may
know where their learning may be increased.
Why, then, should not instructors be inter
ested in knowing how they might better in
crease the knowledge of their students, and
gear the courses to better fit the students'
needs?
In both cases criticism serves to increase and
spread knowledge, the ideal of the teaching
profession. And in both cases, to construc
tively work toward this goal, the criticism must
not be based on personalities. It must be based
on the material presented in the course, and
how it is presented.
The trial study of the system conducted here
last quarter evaluated the instructor according
to presentation of subject, organization, intel
lectual stimulation, level of instruction, tests,
attitude toward students, and bias.
7'hese seem to be valid criteria lor measuring
teaching effectiveness, because all bear on the
students' reaction to the learning stimulus.
Several criticisms of the rating system have
come from instructors who were victims of the
system's trial run here:

One remarked thai the feelings of some in
structors "might be hurt" by criticism of their
teaching methods. We doubt il any such leel
ing could result from honest, objective, con
structive suggestions. Kalher the instructor
should welcome any opportunity to improve
his teaching methods, assuming thai he teaches
that subject because il is ol vital interest to
him.
Often, another instructor said, the criticisms
would be cruel, for the instructor already
would have done all he could to coriect the
weakness. In other cases, weaknesses arise
from the very problems associated with the
particular course, and not hom a weakness on
the instructor's part.
When these situations occur, improvement is
impossible. But it is inconceivable that these
situations would prevail in a majority of the
cases.
Another instructor objected to the "increased
regimentation ol the teaching prolession."
It is not regimentation when the instructor
may Ireely decline to take part in the rating
progiam, and when the results ol the rating will
be released only to him. In other words, the
rating ol an instructor by his students will have
no more effect on thai instructor than he wishes.
Other criticisms of the trial rating were based
on purely mechanical, correctible point's, such
as the wordinq ol questions.
A faculty rating system should be accepted
al Stanford. If a constiuctive, open minded at
titude is maintained by instructor and student
alike, laculty rating will result in greater un
derstanding and similarity ol purpose between
those who teach and those who learn.
