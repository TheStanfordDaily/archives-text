# More on Library System

Every day, throngs of students tax the capac
ity of the Reserve Book Room sign-out desk.
The biggest rush occurs during the 15-minute
recess between class periods.
Unfortunately this is the same time that stu
dent librarians relieve each other as they, too,
go to classes. It is important in coping with this
problem that at least one; and preferably two
librarians, be kept over the hour to keep conti
nuity and speed up the checking out ol books.
The possibility of dividing the procedure so
that authors from A-L were called for at one end
ol the counter vand M Z at the other end, has
been tiied. It failed mainly because students
didn't get into the habit ol following directions
and there was a bottleneck at one end of the
counter.
Perhaps the solution lies in placing a table
with the call slips and the book index boxes
outside the library door and allowing only
people at the counter who have properly filled
out their call cards.
Sunday afternoons, when students arrive at
I o'clock to check out books, and at the same
time arrive to renew books used overnight, the
hue extends lar out into the entrance hall.
Another library problem which we believe
<an be alleviated seerrs particularly appro

priate now as the Main Library call desk is be
sieged with English Exposition students re
questing reference books.
The Library is to be commended this year on
the rearrangement of the call desk which for
merly WdS an inevitable 20-minute stopping
place for people requesting books.
However, one step in the handling of call
cards seems unnecessary. Often the student
must wait in line merely to hand his call card
lo the desk attendant, who in turn hands it to
I lie stack runner. The former is busy with the
details of signing out and renewing books.
11 one could give the call card to the runners
and it could be sent on its way to the stacks
immediately, lime could be saved.
There is one drawback. .At a glance, the desk
attendant can often tell that the requested book
has been placed in another library, whereas
the runner would not have this information.
At times, a system of "delayed paging" has
been used wheieby the student gives the at
tendant the call card and then returns later to
pick up the book
The situation is not one which can be im
proved merely by an overnight change. As
Mr. Puddle lias pointed out, the students must
gel in the habit of followingâ€” and co-operating
with a new system. G.A.
