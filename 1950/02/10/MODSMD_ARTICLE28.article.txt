## In Defense of David Wong 
### 
To the Editor:
It. was very much of a surprise to me to heai that
>me of our Asiatic friends disapprove of David
Wong's articles. I have talked to a number of people
.ibout the matter and have discovered no ill will to
v/ards China because of the articles. Mature minds do
not accept the bad reports without reserving space for
the good. This works the other way around, too. If
people heard nothing but good things about China,
they would still know there were many bad things,
just as there are everywhere in the world today This
i' why the "Chamber-of-Commerce" idea of some ol
Wong's opponents is all wet. If people are not exposed
to conditions as they stand, they tend to imagine all
kinds of things, from the best to the worst, and all of
which may be false.
Wong's articles have not lowered my estimation
of China in the least. On the contrary, they have
aroused my sympathy towai ds the Chinese people
i his is from an observer who was rathei disinterested
in Chinese affairs before Wong's series ol articles
I egan. But he has brought China to life for me at
least. He has made China a real place, and the
Chinese a ieal people with real problems. How can
we even talk or think about China's problems il we
do not know what they are.
Some v/ill argue, no doubt, that Wong has over
dramatized the corruptive elements nl Chin*

<i< ty. Yet, few people would have read the articles
if they had not been written in a vital and interesting
manner. And once your interest has been aroused,
you shed the embellishments and think about the
core. Furthermore, few people would condemn the
Chinese nation for things which tlie common hulk of
the people, at least, can do little about. On the con
trary, many more people will be seriously interested
in China .Hid hei problems because of David Wong's
