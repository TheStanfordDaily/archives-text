mew here in the Western Sector
arlin a young man is studying to
me a doctor. This in itself is
ungfcual. What is unusual is the
that in 1948, just two years ago,
same young man was hovering
yeen life and death from star
on and exposure.
e had nothing to eat, and no
hes to wear but an old torn pair
discarded American GI pants, a

| frayed shirt, and shoes with holes
in their soles which he plugged with
newspaper to keep out the water
and freezing cold.
In 1948 this student was but one
of many who, trapped between war
i and the first years of peace, were
; unable to continue education inter
rupted by the war. The pre-war
j struggle for knowledge had become
| a post-war struggle for existence.
UN Official Gives Lead
It was in 1948 that Stanford's In
j ternational Relief Organization, the
SIRO, received a letter from a UN
[ official. SIRO had requested a list
of names of students in Europe who
were especially in need of food and
clothing. Among the names on this

list was that of the young man in
Berlin. Through the co-operation of
the officials of the airlift, CARE
packages containing food and cloth
ing were rushed to the students.
Nursed back to health with the
contents of these packages, the
young man and many more like him t
were given new courage and confi
dence, the confidence that there was
someone standing behind them,
ready to lend a helping hand if
necessary. With this new - found
spirit, many of the students re
turned to their old schools.
Set Proud Service Record
This is not an exceptional case in
the history of SIRO. Since its crea
tion in the spring quarter of 1947,
SIRO has established a record of
service which should make all Stan
ford students proud.
This service has been of two types t
â€” the facilitation and encourage
ment of foreign relief, and the adop
tion of a foreign university and the
alleviation of pressing conditions
there.
Since 1947, SIRO has sent over j
12,000 pounds of food and clothing
to needy students in 14 European
and three Asiatic countries. To i
finance this and many other phases
ol service. SIRO, through a campus- !
wide fund-raising drive in 1947 at
tained a goal of $12,000.
Also in 1947, the decision was
made to adopt the University of
Naples. This university had felt the
full force of the war in Italy and
was in desperate need of books and I

school supplies. In a book-raising
drive on campus and in the Village,
SIRO was able to send enough text
books and supplies to Naples to es
tablish a school library. The stu
dents at Naples named it "Stanford
Library."
Shift Aid to IScrlin Scene
Most of SIRO's activity in 1948
was directed toward feeding and
clothing the students at Naples. In
1949 the focus was shifted. Many
students and instructors at the old
University of Berlin found them
selves being oppressed more and
more by the Russian government of
the Red Sector. Finally the situa
tion became unbearable, and both
students and professors fled to the
Western Zone to establish a "Free
University of Berlin." Since the sit
uation at Naples had improved,
SIRO was able to direct its atten
tion to the new university and send
books, equipment, and clothing
there.
In the past three years, pleas have
come to Stanford from many for
eign universities for food and other
necessities. In each case. SIRO in
vestigates the situation and acts to
direct a steady supply of the needed
materials to their destinations.
Through the combined co-opera
tion of CARE, the American Mili
tary Government, the airlift, and
now the ground transportation
forces in Europfe, many tons of life
sustaining necessities have reached
the needy students of European
universities.
