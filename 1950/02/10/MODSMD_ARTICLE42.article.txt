# '53 Mermen Entertain SJ Freshmen
## Card Neophytes Favored Over Visiting Squad 
### NORM RITTER 
Ed Rudloff's higliliy rated frosh
swimming team inaugurates its 1950
campaign today by hosting the neo
phytes of San Jose State in the En
ema Pool at 4 p.m.
Anchored by sensational Bert
Holiday in the middle distances and
newly discovered Mel Smith in the
sprints, the Cardbabes are a good
bet to make a runaway of the pre
season affair. The Staters appear no
more potent than their varsity
counterparts, who succumbed to the
the Stanfords, 54 to 21, Wednesday.
Holiday's 52 flat century sprint of
a fortnight ago is still causing
tongues to wag. The six-loot five
inch giant is an all-around natator—
an accomplished breaststroker and
backstroker. He looms as a definite
dark horse threat to Don Bean
ston's Call - Bulletin medley title,
when the veteran Olympic Clubber
puts it on the line in the newspaper
tourney this weekend.
Smith's 10.7 and for the 25
and 50 respectively last Tuesday
were the highlights of the week's
practice sessions. Ironically, he en
tertained no thoughts of swimming
competitively this year unti! he
began quoting his times to varsity
freestyler Pete Cole one evening.
Smith related incredible stories of
touring two 25-yard laps in 22.5
seconds as a prep in North Carolina
three years ago. He later allowed
that the pool was slightly under
sized—by one yard.
But 22.5 for 48 yards was enough
for Cole, who urged Tom Haynie to
let Smith go against the tell-tale
hands of the stop watch. The re
sults are self-evident.
Battling Smith in the sprints will
be George Mowat, brother of the
varsity's John and an important cog
on Rudloff's water polo squad last
fall.
