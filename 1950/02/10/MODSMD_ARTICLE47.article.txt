# Undefeated Ruggers Host Olympic Club Tomorrow
## Vance Sheffey Shelved; Pinotti May Start, at Full 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's undefeated rugby team will open league play tomor
row afternoon on the local field at 2 when they take on the Winged
"O" men of the Olympic Club. The term undefeated in this case
may be misleading, since the Cards have had two of their sched
uled games cancelled.
Last week's scheduled tilt between the Indians and the Univer
sity Club was called off at the last^

minute because of the water-soaked |
condition oi the field, and three j
weeks ago the Stanlord-Menlo game
was cancelled when the Ramblers
decided to disband lor the year.
As a result oi' these cancellations 1
Stanford has only one game on its !
record, that being a 1(5 to 11 victory I
over the Olympic Chtb in a prac- i
tice game, a feat which the Indians j
hope to repeat tomorrow.
ShelFey Out
The Cards will face the Clubmen j
without the services of their ace full
back Vance Sheffey. ShelTey is suf
fering from a face injury incurred in
Tuesday's practice session and will he
out of action for several weeks. His
spot will be filled by either Joe Pi
notti or Pete Peckham. Pinotti is at
present suffering from a charley
horse which may sideline him also.
In the event he isn't ready, then j
Peckham, who has been shifted from
the wing slot to take up the slack,
will get the starting call.
Another change from the lineup
which faced the Clubmen last time i
out, finds Bill McColl stepping into j
a starting spot in the kackfield. The
Clubmen have bitter memories of
McColl, who romped 75 yards to
score against them two weeks ago.
Cal Holds Title
The Cards need a victory tomorrow
in order to successfully inaugurate
their drive to wrest the league title
from Cal. The Bears have had un
disputed possession of the Northern
California Rugby Union title for the
past three years, and the* Indians
haven't defeated the Blue and Gold
in rugby since before the war. For
the past two years the Cards have
entered I he Big Came with Cal unde- !
feated, but the Bears succeeded in J
preserving their title on both oc- j
casions.
This year the story may be dif
ferent, since Stanford appears to I
have its best team since pre-war |
days.
Tomorrow's game will in all prob- j
ability be played on the rugby field
unless the Stadium turf drains suf
ficiently to be hard and fast. The
groundskeepers aren't too anxious to
see that well-groomed Stadium turf
ripped up.
There will be a second game in
volving the reserves of the two
teams following the varsity contest.

Tomorrow's game will in all prob- j
ability be played on the rugby field

see that well-groomed Stadium turf
ripped up.
There will be a second game in

Stanford's undefeated rugby team will open league play tomor
row afternoon on the local field at 2 when they take on the Winged
"O" men of the Olympic Club. The term undefeated in this case
may be misleading, since the Cards have had two of their sched
uled games cancelled.
Last week's scheduled tilt between the Indians and the Univer
sity Club was called off at the last^

minute because of the water-soaked |
condition oi the field, and three j
weeks ago the Stanlord-Menlo game
was cancelled when the Ramblers
decided to disband lor the year.
As a result oi' these cancellations 1
Stanford has only one game on its !
record, that being a 1(5 to 11 victory I
over the Olympic Chtb in a prac- i
tice game, a feat which the Indians j
hope to repeat tomorrow.
ShelFey Out
The Cards will face the Clubmen j
without the services of their ace full
back Vance Sheffey. ShelTey is suf
fering from a face injury incurred in
Tuesday's practice session and will he
out of action for several weeks. His
spot will be filled by either Joe Pi
notti or Pete Peckham. Pinotti is at
present suffering from a charley
horse which may sideline him also.
In the event he isn't ready, then j
Peckham, who has been shifted from
the wing slot to take up the slack,
will get the starting call.
Another change from the lineup
which faced the Clubmen last time i
out, finds Bill McColl stepping into j
a starting spot in the kackfield. The
Clubmen have bitter memories of
McColl, who romped 75 yards to
score against them two weeks ago.
Cal Holds Title
The Cards need a victory tomorrow
in order to successfully inaugurate
their drive to wrest the league title
from Cal. The Bears have had un
disputed possession of the Northern
California Rugby Union title for the
past three years, and the* Indians
haven't defeated the Blue and Gold
in rugby since before the war. For
the past two years the Cards have
entered I he Big Came with Cal unde- !
feated, but the Bears succeeded in J
preserving their title on both oc- j
casions.
This year the story may be dif
ferent, since Stanford appears to I
have its best team since pre-war |
days.
