Results of Stanford s first gym
nastic meet, held Wednesday night,
arrived too late for publication in
yesterday's paper.
San Jose defeated the Indians in
that meet by a 49 to 40 count. The
locals placed first in six events. Dick
Marquardt took the all - around
competition and the rings, Keith
McGregor was first on the side
horse, Dave Allen paced the rope
climbers, Bob White won on the
horizontal bar, and Charles Sayler
was tops in tumbling.
Stanford will have a chance for
revenge next Wednesday evening
when SJS will venture to the local
Gym Room for its second and
final meeting of the season with the
Cards.
