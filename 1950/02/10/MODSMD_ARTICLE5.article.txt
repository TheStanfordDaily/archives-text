WASHINGTON -The House vot
ed today to raise postal rales $130,-
000,000 a yearâ€”less than half the
amount President Truman said is
urgently needed to bring them in
line with other prices.
The bill which the House ap
proved by a voice vote calls for in
creases in every class of service ex
cept first-class. Letters still could
be sent for three cents an ounce by
ordinary mail, six cents by air mail.
