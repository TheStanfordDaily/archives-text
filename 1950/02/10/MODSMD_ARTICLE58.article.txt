First Appearance
This weekend's games bring Mis- j
sion and Lowell to the Pavilion for
the first time this season. Neither j
team has shown much in their
league this year, but both have the
potential punch to give the frosh
trouble. Wednesday, Mission un
loaded a 41 to 8 score on top of i
Balboa High.
The hi;.; gun for Mission is Tony |
Psaltis, a guard who is fifth in the !
city league scoring parade. His |
partner i t guard. Dick Greenberg. j
is a backboard specialist who gave
last year's frosh team a bad time.
Lowell's team lias been hot and J
cold all season, and is a far cry from !
last year's squad which won the city
title in a walk.
