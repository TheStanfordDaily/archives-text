# Danny Kaye Shines In 'General' Success
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
Danny Kaye at his best is the live
liest ball of entertainment since the
days of the Keystone Kops.
Provided with promising situations
and a very minimum amount of well
written material (both usually in
vented by his versatile wife, Sylvia
Fine), he has no trouble setting up
a movie-full ot last and hilarious en
tertainment.
His equipment consists of a mobile
face, a pair of nimble lips, the active
body of a Swedish tumbler, and the
energy of a horse with a hotfoot.
Combined, these make up a master
mimic and finished comedian.
The mimic is the side which takes
over the holm in the lint moving pic
lure farce, "The Inspector General,"
now playing at the Stanford Theater.
The plot of "The Inspector Gen
eral" is the same old balderdash
about European intrigue set in any
century since the Renaisancc.
Around this is built the accident by
which Danny Kaye, a bum and a
failure as a thieving gypsy, is mis
taken for a big wheel in the court
of Napoleon, come to inovstigate cor
ruption. Everything ends as usual,
with the villains in jail and Kaye in
the amis of the scullery maid.
Dut when Kaye cuts loose from lh;>
plot with his alter-cgo about how he
should portray the new role of in
spector general, the show is hilari
ously on it; own sweet way. At va
rious times he gets involved with a
two-day hunger and a hostess who
wants to curl up in his beard and
play lootsie for a couple of'centuries.
A scramble over getting his sword
out of the scabbard to salute the na
tional anthem leAevs him tilting the
hilt, minus the blade, reverently into
the Mf.
During a party he is called upon
to sing, dance, and generally raise

hob with I lie local bigshots. His gyp
| sy accent and the episode with the
j violin, in which he rolls his sad, blue
| eyes so appealingly that even Job
would break down in tears, arc su
pcrb beyond the telling.
Unlike "The Secret Life of Walter
, Mitly," Kaye's part in "The inspec
tor General" doesn't require him to
! act sane or even like a human being.
I Relieved from the strain, Kaye acts
both sane and human, and funny as a
snowball down a deep plunging
neckline.
