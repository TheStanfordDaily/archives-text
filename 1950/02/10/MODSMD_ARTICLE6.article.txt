force probably is tactically as
strong as any group of air forces in
Ihe world, and she and her satellites
are making 40,000 to 50,000 planes a
year, a British expert said today.
The United States Air Force says
it bad 17,000 planes Jan. 31, of which
0,100 were ready for use and 8,500 in
storage. These figures do not in
