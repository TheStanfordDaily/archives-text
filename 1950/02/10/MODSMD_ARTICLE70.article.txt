## BAD MEDICINE for flies 
### 
Research that produced an insecticide safe to spray
on cows may save millions for American agriculture

An nod with only a fly-swatter, the
farmer would gel nowhere in ridding
his dairy barn of disease-carrying in
sect pests. But lie has to he careful
in using insecticides around cows. A
toxic spray may he absorbed through
the animal's skin and show up in
meat, milk and butter.
Next fly-season farmers and
ranchers will he able to buy a flv
killer that is both powerful and safe.
In l)u Pont Muriate* 50', techni
cal mcthoxychlor insecticide they will
get this combination of properties
that no single insecticide has ever
offered before.
Mcthoxychlor is a recent Du Pont
development. Du Pont scientists
worked for eight years in the labora
tory and in the field to develop its
applications in agriculture.
A scifer insecticide
"Mariato" !)() is a residual insecti
cide and remains an effective killer
of flies, mosquitoes, fleas and lice for
several weeksafterapplication. When
used as directed, this insecticide is
exceptionally safe to human beings,
livestock, pets and crops. This has
led federal experts to recommend it.
not only for spraying in barns, milk
houses and milk plants, but also on
the animals themselves.
Besides its use on livestock, mcth
oxychlor kills many insects that at
tack vegetables, fruits and forage
it. is offered to flower growers
as an ingredient in Du Pont Floral
Dust. If is used in moth-proofing
compounds so that dry cleaners can
easily moth-proof woolens while
cleaning them. Many stores carry
aerosol bombs containing methoxy
chlor for household use. It can be
used with safety in flour mills, freez
ing and canning plants, grain stor

age elevators, cereal manufacturing
plants—wherever food is processed.
This development of research can
bring immediate cash savings of mil
lions of dollars to American agricul
ture, industry and homes.
The long fight
Exciting as the future of "Marlafe"
50 appears, this does not mean that
the use of other insect icides will not
continue. Each has its special char
acteristics, and each has special uses
for which it. is outstanding. There
are at least 10,000 kinds of insect
pests, of more or less importance, in
North America, and there can he no
let-up in the scientific tight being
waged against them.
