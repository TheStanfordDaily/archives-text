# Hollywood Farce Opens In Mem Aud
## 'Boy Meets Girl' In Hilarious Play 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
A gold-plated, tin-eared Holly
wood sprinted across the stage
of Memorial Auditorium last
night with the opening of "Boy
Meets Girl."
Last night's production of the lu
hti ions farce l>y Sain and Bella
Spewack was acted with all the
alandon of a nervous elephant
caught by the tail in a nutcracker.
Prom the first white-hot scenario by
the writers, Law and Benson, to the
final "boy gets girl," the play bang
banged along, satire with a fast and
often subtle bite.
Such fast-paced action, however,
demands intricate timing, and here
the Stanford Players tended to let
down a little.
Stea in roller /id inn
Some of Ibo play's best gags and !
slapdash situations were crushed j
under I lie steamroller action. Oc- i
casionally, the players lapsed from a j
high-pitched scrcech into an om- j
barrassod silence, as though not quite j
sure from just where the next screwy j
plot twist was coming. And once in j
a while the cart ran o(T with the |
horse and the gags rolled right by j
the audience.
The second night's confidence
should correct most of this.
As for the players, Hal Burdick J
and John Clark managed to steal the j
show as the best practical jokers i
since Alexander Woollcott quit heck
ling people and died. When the boys ;
bust onto the stage, the place livens |
up like a women's club with a herd
of visiting mice. Their constant tilts
with the fading cowboy, Larry Toms,
arc the best situations in the play.
Jim- Haran, as- the cowboy, plays it
big, bluff and dumber than a drunken
horse.
Gag Possibilities
.Jane Mac Arthur plays the part of
the sweet Susy for all its pregnant,
gag possibilities and comes ofT the j
winner. The costume department. |
must be blamed for her tennis cos- j
tunic which, of course, leaves the j
lines pale by comparison.
Lewis Fosse, as the producer, Fri
day, often carries the whole show on |
his blustering, tormented shoulders. |
And Nick Gilroy, who could use the !
deeper bass voice which will come in j
five years, makes his own mark j
(along with Susy) in the difficult j
boy - meets - girl - over - a - bowl
of-hamhocks.
Bless Wolff's Heart
Emmanuel Brookman plays a fast- i
buck agent, though with not quite [
enough slyness or viciousness. And i
Frank Wolff, bless his old heart, adds
to his own original burlesque voice
to the hear-not proceedings.
The supporting east does well what
it is scheduled to do, support; this <
without getting in the way of the ac- j
lion.
The .song by Wally White of the i
Gaieties is melodious despite the sa
tirical title, "Pain in My Heart, And
My Heart On My Sleeve." The sets
are I right and well-constructed for
acourt ics, and the costume;; are a ecu
rate (exception: the cowboy chaps)
| without being cute.
; And the production, despite afre -
| quent dash to beat the gong, is a
I fair evening's entertainment.
