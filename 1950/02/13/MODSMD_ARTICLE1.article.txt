## Churchill's Program 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 12 </P)- Winston
Churchill tossed u seven - point
"blueprint for the future" into Brit
ain's political campaign today. La
bor party speakers promptly started i
shooting at it.
The Conservative leader, fighting j
to overturn the Labor government
in the balloting February 2!1, made j
proposals ranging from a closer-knit j
British Commonwealth of Nations to
growing more food at home.
The Labor counter - blast was: j
Conservatives have had opportuni- !
tit?s before the war to carry out
their laudable projects; the voters |
shou'd judge the Conservatives "not
by their promises but by their rec
ord."
Churchill asserted that "the j
much - vaunted Socialist 'planned
economy' has been shown up as !
nothing more than a blind drift from
one crisis to another, each one of
which has left the nation gravely
weakened in its struggle for re
covery and survival and caused
avoidable hardship.
