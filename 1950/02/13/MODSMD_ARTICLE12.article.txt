# New Chappie Timely Issue
## 
### 
That figure doing the Charleston
on the front cover of the February
Chaparral (out Wednesday, kids)
will be the Old Boy, who has re
viewed aH the entertaining aspects
of the last three decades and drawn
some significant conclusions on what
the 'Fifties will be like.
That's the main feature of this
month's issue of Stanford's funny
mag four pages on the 'Twenties,
the 'Thirties, the 'Forties, and the
coming decade.
The issue is just jampacked with
i timely subjects. There will be some
j probably unwelcome advice on how
to ski and reproductions of a select
I group of valentines received by the
j Chappies.
