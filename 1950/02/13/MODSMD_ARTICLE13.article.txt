# Red Cross Drive Opens, Aims for Quota of $4,000
## 
### 
Stanford begins its drive to "Paint the Red Cross Cardinal" to j
day.
The week-long campaign will aim toward a $4,000 quota. Only
on-campus and Village students will be canvassed in the drive
this year, with $1 individual contributions as the goal.

No effort will be made to collect
from off-campus students, according
to Drive Chairman Jo Lyon, because
they wiil be contacted at their resi
dences in community drives.
Personal Contacts
Approximately 120 representatives
in campus and Village living groups
will personally contact students dur
ing the week. Solicitors should turn
in their contributions each day at
the ASSU office between l>:15 and
4:30 p.m. to Marge Gavin, drive
treasurer.
A large white cross in front of the
Cellar will record the progress of
the drive. The points of the cross
will be labeled fraternities, men's
halls, women's living groups, and
Village. As money is collected from
each area, the respective point, of the
cross will Ie reddened, completing a
Red Cross when the quota is met.
A meeting of solicitors Thursday
afternoon in the Women's Clubhouse
will give representatives a chance to
see how their group is contributing
as compared to other individual
groups.
Talent Show Proceeds
Proceeds from the Student-Faculty
Talvnt Show at 8 p.m. Friday will go
toward the drive total. The drive,
the only charity solicitation this
quarter, is sponsored by Cardinals.
The Stanford quota is part of the
$42,000 goal of the Palo Alto area.
Almost 75 per cent of this amount
will be used for Red Cross activi
ties in this vicinity, including per
sonal help and loans to students in
addition to training programs and
individual aid.
National Quota
The national quota this year is $(>7
million. This is $12 million below
the estimated budget for 1950, but
the organization will draw on its re
serves for any deficit.
President Truman, honorary presi
dent of the American Red Cross, put
the drive in these terms:
"Many times a year the American
people turn to the Red Cross. Once
a year the Red Cross turns to the
people."
On the nation board of governors
for the Red Cross are the organiza
tion's vice-president, Herbert Hoo
ver, and two members of the Stan
ford Board of Trustees, Charles
Blyth of San Francisco and George
Ditz of Stockton.
