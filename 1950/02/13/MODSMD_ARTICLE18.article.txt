# Miners Revolt, Will Ignore Lewis 'Back to Work' Order
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Feb. 12 (A 1)-Gov
ernment-prodded orders from John
L. Lewis to end the soft coal strike
crackled through the fields today.
But they apparently fell on deaf
cars.
Presidents of three United Mine
Workers districts in western Penn
sylvania, two in West Virginia and
Ohio, and one in Illinois all ex
pressed this view:
"Nothing short of a contract will
make the diggers producc coal
again."
Lewis wived district UMW offi
cials to direct the 370,000 striking
miners to "cease their strike forth
with" in compliance with a U.S.
court order.
The government fired a double
barreled legal blast at the union in
an effort to halt the crippling six
weck-old "no contract no work"
strike.
Coal supplies are estimated at
anywhere from one to three weeks.
Layoffs in coal-using industries are
past the 35,000 mark and arc due to
zoom higher if the strike continues.
Said a top eoal industry source:
"It appears like a complete strike
tomorrow."
A survey of Southern fields indi
cates practically no minors will re
turn to the pits, he said, adding:
"It looks like the same thing ev
erywhere c'se."
The government has indicated i (
will not seek a contempt citation if
every striker isn't back at work to
morrow. This is because of the time
required to get orders transmitted
to the strikers Assistant Attorney
General If. Graham Morrison ex
plained.
Some lawyers in Washington say
a miners' revolt at the individual
level against the court orders might
prise a legal problem for the govern

ment. They declare the miners as
individuals could withhold t heir
services with impunity.
A UMW source who asked not to
be identified declared that Lewis
has complied to the letter with the
government orders. Such action
leaves both him and the union in
the clear whatever happens, he
added.
