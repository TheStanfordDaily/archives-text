# Cardinal Cagers Drop Two Weekend Contests
## Yardley Drives For 26 Points 
### JOHN HALL 
Bomber George Yardley ex
ploded with his greatest cage
performance Saturday night
against USC, but he didn't get
enough help and Stanford fi
nally went down to its second
successive weekend loss, 59 to
45.
The first defeat came Friday night
to UCLA, 65 to 55, in a dreary game
that didn't approach the furious pace
of the Trojan clash.
After almost lulling the crowd to
sleep Friday night, the Cards, with
George Yardley turning on the ju'"e
with 26 points and a devastating
dominance of the defensive board,
completely electrified the Pavilion
rooters with a fighting, driving brand
of basketball against Troy.
Indians Tire
Bui, in the end, it turned out to
be the same old story for the tiring
Indians—they couldn't stay with it,
and USC rolled to a lopsided 14-point
win in a contest which had been tied
or changed leads 15 different times,
and which saw Stanford hold the
commanding hand until the 12th
minute of the second half.
The two losses made it 10 straight
to the Trojans, 5 straight to the
Bruins, and dumped the Tribe into
the southern division cellar with one
win and five losses.
California's Golden Bears got out
of the basement by upsetting USC,
59 to 54, in Berkeley Friday night
to push their league effort to 2 wins
and 4 losses.
The Bears got theirs the next night
whrn UCLA »«-. vrUK c-i to
47 verdict to go into uncontested
loop leadership with a 5-1 record,
Second Night Improvement
Stanford's USC showing was much
improved over the dead-on-its-feet
Bruin outing. John Wooden's Uclans
had the Tribe jumping at shadows
all night, as they put on a brilliant
display of fast break ball and finesse
on the offensive boards.
Puncturing Stanford's zone, Bruin
Carl Kraushaar flipped in five field
goals in the first 5 minutes to whip
UCLA into an opening 13 to 5 lead.
Kraushaar and George Stanich took
charge of both backboards, and Ed
Sheldrake and Don Seidel made a
shambles of Stanford's turtle-break
to stretch things to 38 to 24 by half
time.
Only Jack O'Sullivan's hustling
hall-hawking and jump-shot ar
tistry kept the Cards from being
batted to pieces. Sully's fire finally
became catching in the second half,
and Stanford rame out of its tur
tle-break shell to speed up the
tempo and whittle the gap to 10
points. The Indians outscored
UCLA by four points in the second
half.
O'Sullivan was high for Stanford
with 17, following the Bruin's Carl
Kraushaar who bad 22. A 1 Sawyer
collected 15, and George Yardley,
who never quite hit full st ride against
UCLA, cashed in on a host of free
tosses for 14.
Yardley High Man
It was Saturday night that Jump
ing George turned into a blazing one


GEORGE STANICH AND BRUCE IVERSON scramble for a re
bound during Friday night's UCLA game. Stanich got nosed
out on this one, although he came up with most of the others
as the Bruins poured past Stanford, 65 to 55. Other Stanford
players standing by are George Yardley (32), and Jim Walsh
(31). —Daily photo by Dave Rosenthal
man riot. His 26 points topped Bill
Sharman, who settled for 23 after
dumping in 25 the night before
against Cal.
Yard ley hit from all sides. He
pushed from the corner, came up
with clever tip-ins, drove from un
derneath, intercepted one pass and
dribbled the length of the floor for
another bucket, and connected with
jump-shots from the key.
His boardwork was tremendous.
From the opening tip to the time he
left the ball game in the last sec
onds, he and the defensive board
were one.
llany Horha of the Fxamincr
coimncnted "Blond George took
charge of the defensive hoard,
whirled out toward (ho Trojan goal
like a dervish, shot with unerring
accuracy, rebounded with consum
mate skill to turn in the finest in
dividual performance seen around
Stanford in several years."
Yardley actually overshadowed
Bullseye Bill Sharman, who is un
doubtedly the best all-around eager
on the West Coast. Sometimes you
don't even know Sharman is on the
floor, and then suddenly he ignites
with a deadly push shot or a bucket
setting pass.
He never forced, a shot, passed sev
eral times to teammates when he
could have fired himself, and yet.
plunked in 23 points to rocket his 6-
game loop total to 138, which is 7
points ahead of the record pace set
by Hank Luisetti in 1938.
Yardley Totals 101
Yardleys' two-night total of 40
shot his total over the century mark
at 101 for runner-up honors. Al
Sawyer of UCLA is still third with
86.
The Balboa Blond's inspired play
against USC almost turned the trick.
Had Jim Ramstead, also playing a
rugged rebound game, not been
fouled out with 13 minutes to play,
Stanford might have beaten Troy for
the first time in 10 tries.
Rnmstead and Harry Hugasian had
entered the game midway through

the opening half with the score at
14 to 14. Then, with Ramstead, Yard
ley, arid O'Sullivan combining free
throws and jump-shots, the Indians
i went into a five-point lead at 21 to
| 16, their widest margin.
llalftii-ne Tic
But Sharman evened it at 24 to 24
| at halftime by connecting for three
j straight baskets and a charity toss.
In the afterpiece Yardley and Ram
stead continued to burn up the
boards and stay with the pace until
Ramstead departed.
Alter that, Sharman, Al Lamont,
and Bob Kolf started to build. With
| Stanford's reserves in the game and
| pressing all over the floor, USC
roared to a 53 to 41 lead.
Here, Yardley wiio was out on his
feet from driving all the distance,
! tossed up two more free throws and
I a last beautiful lay-in off a nice pass
from Bill Warren to go down fight
i ing.
Sharman finished it o(T with a pass
-1 off to Joe White who dumped in a
j lay-up as the final gun sounded.
Stanford had lost another ball-
I game, had sunk further into the
southern division cellar, and had
dropped its 11th game of the season,
but had gained back a lot of self
respect.
Next weekend the Cards will try
again against the same two teams in
Los Angeles.

Stanford might have beaten Troy for
the first time in 10 tries.

entered the game midway through

the opening half with the score at

Bomber George Yardley ex
ploded with his greatest cage
performance Saturday night
against USC, but he didn't get
enough help and Stanford fi
nally went down to its second
successive weekend loss, 59 to
45.
The first defeat came Friday night
to UCLA, 65 to 55, in a dreary game
that didn't approach the furious pace
of the Trojan clash.
After almost lulling the crowd to
sleep Friday night, the Cards, with
George Yardley turning on the ju'"e
with 26 points and a devastating
dominance of the defensive board,
completely electrified the Pavilion
rooters with a fighting, driving brand
of basketball against Troy.
Indians Tire
Bui, in the end, it turned out to
be the same old story for the tiring
Indians—they couldn't stay with it,
and USC rolled to a lopsided 14-point
win in a contest which had been tied
or changed leads 15 different times,
and which saw Stanford hold the
commanding hand until the 12th
minute of the second half.
The two losses made it 10 straight
to the Trojans, 5 straight to the
Bruins, and dumped the Tribe into
the southern division cellar with one
win and five losses.
California's Golden Bears got out
of the basement by upsetting USC,
59 to 54, in Berkeley Friday night

Second Night Improvement
Stanford's USC showing was much
improved over the dead-on-its-feet
Bruin outing. John Wooden's Uclans
had the Tribe jumping at shadows
all night, as they put on a brilliant
display of fast break ball and finesse
on the offensive boards.
Puncturing Stanford's zone, Bruin
Carl Kraushaar flipped in five field
goals in the first 5 minutes to whip
UCLA into an opening 13 to 5 lead.
Kraushaar and George Stanich took
charge of both backboards, and Ed
Sheldrake and Don Seidel made a
shambles of Stanford's turtle-break
to stretch things to 38 to 24 by half
time.
Only Jack O'Sullivan's hustling
hall-hawking and jump-shot ar
tistry kept the Cards from being
batted to pieces. Sully's fire finally
became catching in the second half,
and Stanford rame out of its tur
tle-break shell to speed up the
tempo and whittle the gap to 10
points. The Indians outscored
UCLA by four points in the second
half.
O'Sullivan was high for Stanford
with 17, following the Bruin's Carl
Kraushaar who bad 22. A 1 Sawyer
collected 15, and George Yardley,
who never quite hit full st ride against
UCLA, cashed in on a host of free
tosses for 14.

GEORGE STANICH AND BRUCE IVERSON scramble for a re

Yard ley hit from all sides. He
pushed from the corner, came up
with clever tip-ins, drove from un
derneath, intercepted one pass and
dribbled the length of the floor for
another bucket, and connected with
jump-shots from the key.
His boardwork was tremendous.
From the opening tip to the time he

Stanford in several years."
Yardley actually overshadowed
Bullseye Bill Sharman, who is un
doubtedly the best all-around eager
on the West Coast. Sometimes you
don't even know Sharman is on the
floor, and then suddenly he ignites
with a deadly push shot or a bucket

against USC almost turned the trick.

rugged rebound game, not been
fouled out with 13 minutes to play,
Stanford might have beaten Troy for
the first time in 10 tries.

Second Night Improvement
Stanford's USC showing was much
improved over the dead-on-its-feet
Bruin outing. John Wooden's Uclans
had the Tribe jumping at shadows
all night, as they put on a brilliant
display of fast break ball and finesse
on the offensive boards.
Puncturing Stanford's zone, Bruin
Carl Kraushaar flipped in five field
goals in the first 5 minutes to whip
UCLA into an opening 13 to 5 lead.
Kraushaar and George Stanich took
charge of both backboards, and Ed
Sheldrake and Don Seidel made a
shambles of Stanford's turtle-break
to stretch things to 38 to 24 by half
time.
Only Jack O'Sullivan's hustling
hall-hawking and jump-shot ar
tistry kept the Cards from being
batted to pieces. Sully's fire finally
became catching in the second half,
and Stanford rame out of its tur
tle-break shell to speed up the
tempo and whittle the gap to 10
points. The Indians outscored
UCLA by four points in the second
half.
O'Sullivan was high for Stanford
with 17, following the Bruin's Carl
Kraushaar who bad 22. A 1 Sawyer
collected 15, and George Yardley,
who never quite hit full st ride against
UCLA, cashed in on a host of free
tosses for 14.
Yardley High Man
It was Saturday night that Jump

GEORGE STANICH AND BRUCE IVERSON scramble for a re
bound during Friday night's UCLA game. Stanich got nosed
out on this one, although he came up with most of the others

man riot. His 26 points topped Bill
Sharman, who settled for 23 after
dumping in 25 the night before
against Cal.
Yard ley hit from all sides. He
pushed from the corner, came up
with clever tip-ins, drove from un
derneath, intercepted one pass and
dribbled the length of the floor for
another bucket, and connected with
jump-shots from the key.
His boardwork was tremendous.
From the opening tip to the time he
left the ball game in the last sec
onds, he and the defensive board
were one.
llany Horha of the Fxamincr
coimncnted "Blond George took
charge of the defensive hoard,
whirled out toward (ho Trojan goal
like a dervish, shot with unerring
accuracy, rebounded with consum
mate skill to turn in the finest in
dividual performance seen around
Stanford in several years."
Yardley actually overshadowed
Bullseye Bill Sharman, who is un
doubtedly the best all-around eager
on the West Coast. Sometimes you
don't even know Sharman is on the
floor, and then suddenly he ignites
with a deadly push shot or a bucket
setting pass.
He never forced, a shot, passed sev
eral times to teammates when he
could have fired himself, and yet.
plunked in 23 points to rocket his 6-
game loop total to 138, which is 7
points ahead of the record pace set
by Hank Luisetti in 1938.
Yardley Totals 101
Yardleys' two-night total of 40
shot his total over the century mark
at 101 for runner-up honors. Al
Sawyer of UCLA is still third with
86.
The Balboa Blond's inspired play
against USC almost turned the trick.
Had Jim Ramstead, also playing a
rugged rebound game, not been
fouled out with 13 minutes to play,
Stanford might have beaten Troy for
the first time in 10 tries.
Rnmstead and Harry Hugasian had
entered the game midway through

the opening half with the score at
14 to 14. Then, with Ramstead, Yard
ley, arid O'Sullivan combining free
throws and jump-shots, the Indians
i went into a five-point lead at 21 to
| 16, their widest margin.
llalftii-ne Tic
But Sharman evened it at 24 to 24
| at halftime by connecting for three
j straight baskets and a charity toss.
In the afterpiece Yardley and Ram
stead continued to burn up the
boards and stay with the pace until
Ramstead departed.
Alter that, Sharman, Al Lamont,
and Bob Kolf started to build. With
| Stanford's reserves in the game and
| pressing all over the floor, USC
roared to a 53 to 41 lead.
Here, Yardley wiio was out on his
feet from driving all the distance,
! tossed up two more free throws and
I a last beautiful lay-in off a nice pass
from Bill Warren to go down fight
i ing.
Sharman finished it o(T with a pass
-1 off to Joe White who dumped in a
j lay-up as the final gun sounded.
Stanford had lost another ball-
I game, had sunk further into the
southern division cellar, and had
dropped its 11th game of the season,
but had gained back a lot of self
respect.
Next weekend the Cards will try
again against the same two teams in
Los Angeles.

Bruin outing. John Wooden's Uclans
had the Tribe jumping at shadows
all night, as they put on a brilliant
display of fast break ball and finesse
on the offensive boards.
Puncturing Stanford's zone, Bruin
Carl Kraushaar flipped in five field
goals in the first 5 minutes to whip
UCLA into an opening 13 to 5 lead.
Kraushaar and George Stanich took
charge of both backboards, and Ed
Sheldrake and Don Seidel made a
shambles of Stanford's turtle-break
to stretch things to 38 to 24 by half
time.
Only Jack O'Sullivan's hustling
hall-hawking and jump-shot ar
tistry kept the Cards from being
batted to pieces. Sully's fire finally
became catching in the second half,
and Stanford rame out of its tur
tle-break shell to speed up the
tempo and whittle the gap to 10
points. The Indians outscored
UCLA by four points in the second
half.
O'Sullivan was high for Stanford
with 17, following the Bruin's Carl
Kraushaar who bad 22. A 1 Sawyer
collected 15, and George Yardley,
who never quite hit full st ride against
UCLA, cashed in on a host of free
tosses for 14.
Yardley High Man
It was Saturday night that Jump
ing George turned into a blazing one


GEORGE STANICH AND BRUCE IVERSON scramble for a re
bound during Friday night's UCLA game. Stanich got nosed
out on this one, although he came up with most of the others
as the Bruins poured past Stanford, 65 to 55. Other Stanford
players standing by are George Yardley (32), and Jim Walsh
(31). —Daily photo by Dave Rosenthal
man riot. His 26 points topped Bill
Sharman, who settled for 23 after
dumping in 25 the night before
against Cal.
Yard ley hit from all sides. He
pushed from the corner, came up
with clever tip-ins, drove from un
derneath, intercepted one pass and
dribbled the length of the floor for
another bucket, and connected with
jump-shots from the key.
His boardwork was tremendous.
From the opening tip to the time he
left the ball game in the last sec
onds, he and the defensive board
were one.
llany Horha of the Fxamincr
coimncnted "Blond George took
charge of the defensive hoard,
whirled out toward (ho Trojan goal
like a dervish, shot with unerring
accuracy, rebounded with consum
mate skill to turn in the finest in
dividual performance seen around
Stanford in several years."
Yardley actually overshadowed
Bullseye Bill Sharman, who is un
doubtedly the best all-around eager
on the West Coast. Sometimes you
don't even know Sharman is on the
floor, and then suddenly he ignites
with a deadly push shot or a bucket
setting pass.
He never forced, a shot, passed sev
eral times to teammates when he
could have fired himself, and yet.
plunked in 23 points to rocket his 6-
game loop total to 138, which is 7
points ahead of the record pace set
by Hank Luisetti in 1938.
Yardley Totals 101
Yardleys' two-night total of 40
shot his total over the century mark
at 101 for runner-up honors. Al
Sawyer of UCLA is still third with
86.
The Balboa Blond's inspired play
against USC almost turned the trick.
Had Jim Ramstead, also playing a
rugged rebound game, not been
fouled out with 13 minutes to play,
Stanford might have beaten Troy for
the first time in 10 tries.
Rnmstead and Harry Hugasian had
entered the game midway through

the opening half with the score at
14 to 14. Then, with Ramstead, Yard
ley, arid O'Sullivan combining free
throws and jump-shots, the Indians
i went into a five-point lead at 21 to
| 16, their widest margin.
llalftii-ne Tic
But Sharman evened it at 24 to 24
| at halftime by connecting for three
j straight baskets and a charity toss.
In the afterpiece Yardley and Ram
stead continued to burn up the
boards and stay with the pace until
Ramstead departed.
Alter that, Sharman, Al Lamont,
and Bob Kolf started to build. With
| Stanford's reserves in the game and
| pressing all over the floor, USC
roared to a 53 to 41 lead.
Here, Yardley wiio was out on his
feet from driving all the distance,
! tossed up two more free throws and
I a last beautiful lay-in off a nice pass
from Bill Warren to go down fight
i ing.
Sharman finished it o(T with a pass
-1 off to Joe White who dumped in a
j lay-up as the final gun sounded.
Stanford had lost another ball-
I game, had sunk further into the
southern division cellar, and had
dropped its 11th game of the season,
but had gained back a lot of self
respect.
Next weekend the Cards will try
again against the same two teams in
Los Angeles.
