# Cardinal Cagers Drop Two Weekend Contests
## Yardley Drives For 26 Points 
### JOHN HALL 
Bomber George Yardley ex
ploded with his greatest cage
performance Saturday night
against USC, but he didn't get
enough help and Stanford fi
nally went down to its second
successive weekend loss, 59 to
45.
The first defeat came Friday night
to UCLA, 65 to 55, in a dreary game
that didn't approach the furious pace
of the Trojan clash.
After almost lulling the crowd to
sleep Friday night, the Cards, with
George Yardley turning on the ju'"e
with 26 points and a devastating
dominance of the defensive board,
completely electrified the Pavilion
rooters with a fighting, driving brand
of basketball against Troy.
Indians Tire
Bui, in the end, it turned out to
be the same old story for the tiring
Indians—they couldn't stay with it,
and USC rolled to a lopsided 14-point
win in a contest which had been tied
or changed leads 15 different times,
and which saw Stanford hold the
commanding hand until the 12th
minute of the second half.
The two losses made it 10 straight
to the Trojans, 5 straight to the
Bruins, and dumped the Tribe into
the southern division cellar with one
win and five losses.
California's Golden Bears got out
of the basement by upsetting USC,
59 to 54, in Berkeley Friday night
to push their league effort to 2 wins
and 4 losses.
The Bears got theirs the next night

Second Night Improvement
Stanford's USC showing was much
improved over the dead-on-its-feet
Bruin outing. John Wooden's Uclans
had the Tribe jumping at shadows
all night, as they put on a brilliant
display of fast break ball and finesse
on the offensive boards.
Puncturing Stanford's zone, Bruin
Carl Kraushaar flipped in five field
goals in the first 5 minutes to whip
UCLA into an opening 13 to 5 lead.
Kraushaar and George Stanich took
charge of both backboards, and Ed
Sheldrake and Don Seidel made a
shambles of Stanford's turtle-break
to stretch things to 38 to 24 by half
time.
Only Jack O'Sullivan's hustling
hall-hawking and jump-shot ar
tistry kept the Cards from being
batted to pieces. Sully's fire finally
became catching in the second half,
and Stanford rame out of its tur
tle-break shell to speed up the
tempo and whittle the gap to 10
points. The Indians outscored
UCLA by four points in the second
half.
O'Sullivan was high for Stanford
with 17, following the Bruin's Carl
Kraushaar who bad 22. A 1 Sawyer
collected 15, and George Yardley,
who never quite hit full st ride against
UCLA, cashed in on a host of free
tosses for 14.

out on this one, although he came up with most of the others
as the Bruins poured past Stanford, 65 to 55. Other Stanford
