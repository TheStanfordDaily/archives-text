# Give to the Red Cross
## 
### 
This week, and this week only, yon will be
asked to give to the Red Cross.
We cannot begin to tell you why you should
support the Red Cross . . . not in the space
of one brief editorial. In fact, we shouldn't
have to tell you.
Hvery day newspapers throughout the coun
try tell of the work of the Rod Cross . . . relief
to communities hit by floods, fires, and olhei
disasters. Relief both here and abroad.
And then there is the never-ending, day by
day work that you seldom hear about . . . aid

to hungiy, sick families; first aid attention;
teaching people how to help others, how to
save lives.
Many veterans still speak of the cases of
wartime mismanagement in the Red Cross
overseas. Many of them are still resentful.
The Red Cross has not always been right,
perhaps, but the tremendous wealth of good it
has done is beyond question.
The Red Cross works successfully for the
good of mankind. Any organization that does
this deserves your support.
