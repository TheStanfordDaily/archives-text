### JOHN HALL 
I ast Friday was a crucial clay.
What with midterms pouncing on everybody, Bull
Dadey still rattling oil' his father's jokes, UCLA's cage
club crowding its way into the Pavilion, a new
editor lashing the whip here in the Shack, Lake Lag
ready to hit the jackpot, and the Frosh-Sonh Jambo-

ree scheduled to break loose any
time, I figured that it was about
time to toss my Royal into the
garbage can and start living.
"I'll read the other artists for
awhile," I modestly said to my
self and headed for the newspa
per stand in the Cellar to make a
casual comparison of the new Bob
de Roos and the old Herb Caen.
But my plans were dashed like
100 yards by Mel Patton when 1
was shocked to find that Proprie-

tor Pete has moved the newspapers behind the counti.T
and that you shell out these days.
Dejected and empty-handed, 1 wa'ked outside to
settle for a cup of white and a little conversation.
Hank Rosin was there, but before I could ask him
when Excom was going to open the gate to the lake,
five guys shoved me into the bushes and .surrounded
him with stories about some •committee, so I had to
se 11 le (the first time it was ior coflee) for;: 11 oh I mem
ber oi Kally Com. She, as fiction would have it, had
1..« a t.ol. ....a rr u.l rnnrltng n „. ,• uf.mii.lo
down.
Skipping the usual routine, J merely opened with

"They say there's a basketball series with UCLA and
USC this weekend. Has KC got anything planned?"
"Yes," she remarked cleverly. "We're working on
a new yell called the China Chant, ft goes like this:
Chop-chop-chop (pause) WOODen!!
Chop-chop-chop (pause) WOODen!!
"Never mind," I broke in, as t tried to fight off
nausea. "I'd rather be surprise d Friday night." (I was.)
Moving down to the Bookstore, I ran across a
character in a big black beard and an old pal named
Jerry Smith, who is helping pass out publicity for
the Frosh-Soph Jamboree. Helping them to their feet
and dusting off the tire marks from their Koos Bros,
cords, I shot a well-planned question:
"When's the Gurl-game corning off?"
"It's not," they answered grimly. "The Dean didn't
think the reaction would be appropriate to that neces
sary for Stanford Women.
"No kidding?" 112 kidded them. "What are you going
to replace it with?"
"Oil, we have ;i lew angle,," said Smith, as he
t.lanced over at the blonde member of Rally Com with
whom I'd been talking at the Cellar. "Just say that the
Jamboree will be a bunch of crazy sophomores and
freshmen acting craziei than usual. Read about it in
The Daily."
Then, realizing that 1 d probably made a mistake in
deciding to start living last week, I shuffled hack to
the Shack, fished out my old Royal, dusted it off with
>,n,. of Marv Tinchei's 10-dollar bills (he's j.;ot thou
sands'), and went back to the grind.
I'll start living this week.

"Never mind," I broke in, as t tried to fight off
nausea. "I'd rather be surprise d Friday night." (I was.)
Moving down to the Bookstore, I ran across a
character in a big black beard and an old pal named
Jerry Smith, who is helping pass out publicity for
the Frosh-Soph Jamboree. Helping them to their feet
and dusting off the tire marks from their Koos Bros,
cords, I shot a well-planned question:
"When's the Gurl-game corning off?"
"It's not," they answered grimly. "The Dean didn't
think the reaction would be appropriate to that neces
sary for Stanford Women.
"No kidding?" 112 kidded them. "What are you going
to replace it with?"
"Oil, we have ;i lew angle,," said Smith, as he
t.lanced over at the blonde member of Rally Com with
whom I'd been talking at the Cellar. "Just say that the
Jamboree will be a bunch of crazy sophomores and
freshmen acting craziei than usual. Read about it in
The Daily."
Then, realizing that 1 d probably made a mistake in
deciding to start living last week, I shuffled hack to
the Shack, fished out my old Royal, dusted it off with

ree scheduled to break loose any
time, I figured that it was about
time to toss my Royal into the
garbage can and start living.
"I'll read the other artists for
awhile," I modestly said to my
self and headed for the newspa
per stand in the Cellar to make a
casual comparison of the new Bob
de Roos and the old Herb Caen.
But my plans were dashed like
100 yards by Mel Patton when 1
was shocked to find that Proprie-
