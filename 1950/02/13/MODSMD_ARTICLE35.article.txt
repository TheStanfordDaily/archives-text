Bowl.
The contest was supposed to de
cide the rivalry between the two
outstanding T - formation quarter
hacks ol this area in the 1941) sea
son Celeri at California and Le-
Baron at College of the Pacific,
The game, played on a rain-soft
ened field, hardly proved an accu
rate t«■ st of the respective abilities
of the two team leaders. It did
prove that the gridiron sport is de
cidedly popular in the post-season.
Football in February coaxed out
a capacity crowd ol 24,218, for which
standing room only was sold.
Among the spectators were Gov.
and Mrs. Earl Warren.
Each player will receive between
$500 and $000 for his effort. Lcßaron
and Celeri each will receive $2,500.
The game's three promoters will get
about $3,500 apiece.
The Leßarons' first-period score
and conversion was good enough for
the win. Celeri's squad chalked up
a second - quarter touchdown but
couldn't convert.
The last half was scoreless, with
Celeri's team holding ball control
but unable to gain a point. Several
of Celeri's long passes were dropped
hy his receivers when they were in
tlie clear.
Celeri looked better than Lcßaron
on offense, but the COP star was a
standout on defense.
In the third period, Lcßaron, only
player ever to be selected on the
Little All-America team three years
in succession, was thrown three
times for a total loss of 22 yards.
The Leßarons' first-period score

followed recovery of a fumble on
the 24-yard line of Celeri's team.
Right halfback Bruce Orbis, who
COP, went over from the one-yard
line. One* of iis college teammates,
Wayne Hardin, place - kicked the
extra point.
The Celeris' touchdown also was
set up by a fumble, which they re
covered on the Leßarons' 28. Left
halfback Bill Montagne, ex-Califor
nia, crashed through from the one
inch line. Jim Cullom, a linesman
whose sure - footedness piled up
points for California, missed two
placements. He got his second
chance because the Leßarons were
ofT-side.

The game's three promoters will get
about $3,500 apiece.
The Leßarons' first-period score
and conversion was good enough for
the win. Celeri's squad chalked up
a second - quarter touchdown but
couldn't convert.
The last half was scoreless, with
Celeri's team holding ball control
but unable to gain a point. Several
of Celeri's long passes were dropped
hy his receivers when they were in
tlie clear.
Celeri looked better than Lcßaron
on offense, but the COP star was a
standout on defense.
In the third period, Lcßaron, only
player ever to be selected on the
Little All-America team three years
in succession, was thrown three
times for a total loss of 22 yards.
The Leßarons' first-period score

followed recovery of a fumble on
the 24-yard line of Celeri's team.
Right halfback Bruce Orbis, who
COP, went over from the one-yard
line. One* of iis college teammates,
Wayne Hardin, place - kicked the
extra point.
The Celeris' touchdown also was
set up by a fumble, which they re
covered on the Leßarons' 28. Left
halfback Bill Montagne, ex-Califor
nia, crashed through from the one
inch line. Jim Cullom, a linesman
whose sure - footedness piled up
points for California, missed two
placements. He got his second
chance because the Leßarons were
ofT-side.
The line score:
Oleri Alt-Stars 0 6 —R

•"'■y over Bob Celeri's All-Stars in
:< football game between former col
lege players today in the Grape
Bowl.
The contest was supposed to de

outstanding T - formation quarter
hacks ol this area in the 1941) sea
son Celeri at California and Le-
Baron at College of the Pacific,
The game, played on a rain-soft
ened field, hardly proved an accu
rate t«■ st of the respective abilities
of the two team leaders. It did
prove that the gridiron sport is de
cidedly popular in the post-season.
Football in February coaxed out
a capacity crowd ol 24,218, for which
standing room only was sold.
Among the spectators were Gov.
and Mrs. Earl Warren.
Each player will receive between
$500 and $000 for his effort. Lcßaron
and Celeri each will receive $2,500.

about $3,500 apiece.
