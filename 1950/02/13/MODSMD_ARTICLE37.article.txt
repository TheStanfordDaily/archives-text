j evening they were pushed to the
final horn when they edyed away
from Lowell High 49 to 44.

nett used 17 players against the
hapless Missionites. Forward Paul
Johnson continued as the mainstay
of the scoring department by dump
ing in seven field goals for 14 points,

were unable to pull away until the
closing minutes.
It was Stevenson who led the
scoring against his alma mater,
| Lowell, by making IG points. Co
| captains Johnson and Fritz Fenster
