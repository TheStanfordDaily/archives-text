### 
BANGKOK, Thailand (Siam) â€”
Seventeen American diplomats will
begin a secret three-day conference
today on the problems of Asia and
will seek means of strengthening
United States policies in an area
which is already half Red and half
undecided.
President Truman's personal rep
resentative, Ambassador Philip C.
Jossup, will hear reports from dip
lomats whose combined territory
embraces more than half the world's
population.
Jcssup has indicated the subjects
will range from border tension in
Afghanistan to a Japanese peace
treaty. The basic problem will be
Communism's march.
