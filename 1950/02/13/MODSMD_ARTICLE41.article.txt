# Stanford Ruggers Edge Winged '0' Club, 3 to 0
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Alert and aggressive defensive
play by the Stanford forwards was
the deciding factor last Saturday as
the Indian ruggers eked out a 3 to 0
victory over the Olympic Club on
the local rugby field. The Clubmen
threatened to hit pay dirt through
out the contest, but the forward di
vision, led by Ed Culin, John Rose
krans, and Captain Mike Spiro, was
always on hand to cut short these
scoring thrusts.
The margin of victory was pro-

vided in the early m nents of the
game when a dribbling rush carried
the ball to within the Olympic Club
10-yard line where Spiro passed the
ball off to Rosekrans who dove over
the goal for the try. Culin's conver
sion attempt was short.
Culin Prevents Score
During the remainder of the first
half the Clubmen were constantly
in Stanford territory. They almost

| scored when Ed Welch kicked the
ball out on the one-yard line. But
] in the line-out which followed Culin
1 grabbed the ball and with the aid
I of the other forwards maneuvered
it out of danger.
In the second half the Cards
J almost scored again when Dick
Hughes, running like a scared, jack -
J rabbit, broke loose and almost went
i all the way, but he was tackled
j short of the goal.
Bill McColl also had several op
portunities on penalty kicks, but he
had to kick from a bad angle and
had a strong cross wind to contend
with.
Pcckham Stars
Standouts in the backfield for the
Indians were Hughes, Bill De Young.
| and Pete Peckham. Hughes and
DeYoung did some fancy running,
i while Peckham, filling in for the in
| jured Vance Shefi'ey, got oft' some
well-placed kicks from the det'en
â–  sive fullback slot.
On Wednesday a traveling squad
of 20 ruggers will head north for
a two-game series with British Co
- lumbia. Games will be played on
Thursday and Saturday, and a third
j contest is scheduled for March when
j the Canadians come south.
