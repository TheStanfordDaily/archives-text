# WSF to Discuss Spring Caravan
## 
### 
Plans for the California Caravan
will be discussed today in an open
meeting by the Stanford Student
FcderalLs'" n.rr.. : n the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The Caravan will roll during
spring vacation beginning in San
Diego and Eureka and converging on
Sacramento. The purpose of the
Caravan is to expose Californians to
the idea of world federation so that
when the issue comes to a vote there
can be intelligent balloting.
Petitions will also be circulated to
support HCR 64, the bill advocating
world federalism that is now before
Congress. Continued support for the
recently passed California resolution
calling for a Constitutional Conven
tion to amend the Constitution to in
sure U.S. participation in a world
government will also be advocated.
All students. Federalists or not, are
invited to join the Caravan at Stan
ford or anywhere along its route.
