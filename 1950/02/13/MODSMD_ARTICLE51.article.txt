# SIRO Assists Philippines
## 
### BOB FINKEL 
Recently, SIRO has turned in
ward the West in search of new
prob'ems to solve. In the Philip
pines, a group of teachers fqrmetl a
1 co-operative school, the Lopez Jae-
I na Memorial College.
Without funds, books, or cquip
-1 mcnt, the college was faced with the
; prospect of failure when SIRO
heard of its plight,. Immediately
| books, school supplies, and laborn
j tory equipment were procured
I through voluntary donations by
Stanford University departments,
professors and students alike.
Today, thanks to the prompt and
effective action of SIRO, the Lopez
Jaena College has a firm foothold
and a very promising future.
Widening Scope
The scope of SIRO has been wi
dened tremendously during the past
three years, so that today the Stan
ford International Relief Organiza
tion is sending aid to needy students
j in 14 European and three Asiatic:
| countries. Letters are received daily
1 by SIRO thanking Stanford students
' for their graciousncss and kindness
I toward suffering peoples all over
the world.
Such efforts as these are not the
j actions of a few students at Stan
| ford, but rather, they are the sum
; of all the members of the big Farm
family acting together to accomplish
a definite task. They could not ex
j ist were it not for the donations of
! time, money, and effort on the part
j of everyone.
Farm Workers
Stanford men and women, in and
: out of SIRO, work every afternoon
! from 4 to G and every Saturday from
9 to 12 wrapping packages, collect
ing clothes donations, and gathering
used-book gifts. Many other stu
dents are busy writing to one or
more of the thousand foreign stu

dents whose names arC on open file
in the SIRO ollice.
Today, in a world so lacking in
faith and kindness, we at Stanford
should feel proud to be a part of
the organization that is doint; so
much to bring a common feeling of
understanding to the future leaders
of the world.
