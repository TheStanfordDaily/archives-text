WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (/I'j
President Truman today handed
Congress a catalog of abuses of this
year's $2,754,000,000 GI education
program and urged the legislators
to clamp down.
Pointing to skyrocketing numbers
of veterans attending trade and vo
cational schools, Mr. Truman asked
new legislation to prevent inferior
training.
With an estimated 850,000 veter
ans taking such courses —and 5,635
private trade and vocational schools
for them set up in five and a half
years—Mr. Truman told Congress
lie was concerned lest the GI edu
cation plan "be blemished by the
belated growth of certain kinds" of
such training which wouldn't be
much help to the veteran.
