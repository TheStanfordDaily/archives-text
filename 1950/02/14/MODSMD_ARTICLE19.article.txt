] his role outside the campus eommu-
I nity.
The Student Workshop is a con
tinuation of the 1049 Mock Conven

gained at the convention, the Work
j shop has been opened this year to
j both men's and women's groups.
The YWCA has undertaken spon
j sorship of the Workshop in view of
j experience gained in handling the
| Mock Convention last year. Marge
j Gavin and Ruth Vickery arc co
chairmen.

Taylor, general arrangements; Kit
