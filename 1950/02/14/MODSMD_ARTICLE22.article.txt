# WONG ON ASIA
## From Colonialism to Communism 
### DAVID WONG 
A :;ia has been trying for years lo
rid herself of the curse of old colo
nialism, and now, when she is on
llic brink of success, she is faced
with colonialism hy another name
Communism.
But unfortunately, many Asiatics
have not been able to sec Commu
nism as such.
In Asia, Communism is masquer
ading as nationalism, and for the
moment at least, nationalism and
Communism mean the same thing to
many Asiatics. The Communists
have been particularly careful in
keeping up this illusion, for they
know that it is not Comunism itself
which appeals to the Asiatics, but
the ability of Communists to per
form acts of violence on the white
man.
For ages past, a deep and burning
hatred for the white man has
smouldered in the hearts of most
Asiatics. The Japanese lent fuel to

the lire by pleaching their doctrine j
of Asia for the Asians. At the con
! elusion of llm war, the hatred burst
I forth and swept the whole of A.sia
j like wildfire.
Exploitation l>y Whiles
The cause of this hatred is not. far
to seek. The behavior of Western
powers in the past has been no less
than dcplorah'e. The people of their
j Asiatic colonics were heartlessly
exploited. They took a lot out of
the colonics, but put very little in.
That, is true of the British in Ma
laya. India, and Burma; the French
in French Indo - China; and the
j Dutch in the East. Indies. In a conn- j
try such as China, the Opium Wars
and Unequal Treaties are still fresh ;
in the memories of the people.
But perhaps more than the acts of !
the various governments, the Asi
atic masses arc touched by the acts !
I of individuals. The common man |
1 can only judge foreign nations by !
| the foreign individuals he meets. |

! This i:; lamentable because the way
most foreigners act. in Asia would
cause their countrymen at home to
hide their faces with shame.
Most foreigners who go to the
Orient are extremely nice fellows!
when they first arrive there. But
once they are there, some disease j
seems to possess them. They begin j
to get, some sort of superiority com
plex, which grows worse and worse
through the years.
What causes this disease I know j
not. Perhaps it is the comparatively
cheaper labor in the Orient which
gives the foreigner a sense of power |
I in what his money can buy. Per- '
haps it is his higher standard of liv
; ing. But whatever the cause, it is
' certainly a disease.
Inhuman Attitudes
One example of this malady was
| demonstrated by a certain English
! inspector of police whom I used to
! know in Hong Kong. He was in
| charge of clearing the streets of ;

hawkers and vendors mid arresting
any who did not have a license.
I once had occasion to watch him
on one of his hawker raids. He was
so over-zealous in his work that he
used undue violence in executing
his arrests. When I drew his atten
tion to the fact that such force was
hardly necessary in arresting peo
ple, he said. "Oh, you can't treat
them a,s human beings. They are
ignorant and stupid. They are noth
ing more than animals."
The attitude of this inspector is
typical <>112 the attitude of many for
eigners in the Orient. The last war
did a lot toward wiping out such
attitudes, but right now, the same
old attitudes arc creeping back. I
have noticed them in half a dozen
countries in the Far East, and if
they are not changed, and changed
quickly, then I can only foresee the
whole of Asia going down in Com
munism.
