# Coal Walkout Is at Standstill
## Government Officials Will Wait Before Seeking Contempt Action 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (AP)—Government officials said today
they will wait a while before making a new move to end the soft
coal strike.
John L. Lewis has ordered the miners back, but they have ig
nored him.
Justice Department attorneys said they intend to mark time to

miners a chance to obey a fed
eral court order to return to their
jobs.
These lawyers said they may even
wait until next Monday to seek con
tempt action, which could involve
heavy money penalties on Lewis'
union treasury for disobedience.
Next Monday is the day Judge
Richmond B. Keech will hear argu
ment on making his present order a
full injunction. Lewis and his United
Mine Workers were fined $710,000 in
1946 and $1,420,000 in 1948, for con
tempt.
Bargaining To Resume
As the nation watched for the
showdown between Lewis and the
federal government, now that the
Taft-Hartley Law has been invoked
by President Truman, a resumption
of coal contract bargaining was as
sured for next Wednesday,
The Southern Coal Producers As
sociation, headed by Joseph Moody,
today accepted a bid from Lewis for
renewed bargaining.
The northern and western opera
tors accepted a few hours later.
Lewis suggested the time and place
Saturday after Judge Keech directed
the union and operators to tackle the
business of agreeing on a new coal
contract. The last one expired June
30, 1949.
Officials Hope
Officials, noting that many miners
have stayed away from the pits to
day because of celebration of Lewis'
70th birthday, had hopes the diggers
may start drifting back tomorrow or
Wednesday. This wos their reason
for delaying contempt proceedings
before Judge Keech.
"We are mainly interested In get
ting full coal production restored,"
one Justice Department official said.
The miners were staying idle today
despite Judge Keech's back-t4-work
order and despite Lewis' message
that he had no alternative but to
direct them to resume work.
Many coal operators expressed the
belief privately that the union was
really not seeking to end the strike,
but on the contrary was secretly en
couraging the miners to stay out.
