"To one out of two Yale men, sex is nothing but a
fhree-letter word." This is on the authority of the
Harvard Crimson, reporting on a poll taken by the
Yale yearbook. To the question, "Have you had sexual
intercourse?" 49 per cent of the Elis replied yes and
51 per cent said no, the Crimson continues. No one
answered he didn't know.
The poll was not entirely concerned with sex; il
was a general questionnaire, and the miniature Kin
• oy report was sandwiched between the queries, "How
did you spend most of your summer?'' and "How much
time do you spend on extra-curricular activities?"
Only four of the questions, concludes the Crimson,
were "devoted to the undergraduate's favorite indoor
sport."

Most students are aware that there are different
types of professors and courses, but the Mount Huly
oke News has it down to a system, apparently the
result of serious study— not necessarily of course ma
toiial, just of courses, professors, and student reactions
to them.
There's the "gut" course, the prime goal of most
c tudents in college, the one that never changes and
you never have to go to. The required course is re
sented if not hated. Students have taken courses for
the professor, especially if lie has a reputation for ul
sent-mindedness, and are likely to find out that he's
not too absent-minded about the material. Then
there's the orator —"a firm knowledge of his point of
view on all matters is essential to a good mark." Even
worse is the tyrant. You have to pretend to think be
fore you come up with his point of view. Finally,
there is the gossip—"She knows somethin slightly
shady about every famous person she mentions. The
great drawback is that she isn't interested in the tid
bits on exams."

An editorial in El Mustang, the California State
Polytechnic paper, states that student wives ought to
get some kind of degree, too. "How many students
can honestly say they passed English on their own,
without critical help from home?" they ask.
"Not being bachelors, the wives would have to settle
for another kind of degree something on the honor
ary type to show our appreciation of their efforts."

What happens when some students get the idea that
a few members of their student council are thinking
of themselves more than of the students' money?
At Michigan State, heap big smoke. It all started
when 10 council members voted to keep on appropriat
ing student funds to buy pins and keys for themselves.
The News got mad and wrote editorials. The soph class
president got mad and went around collecting pins
for the student council villains—clothespins, Willkie
buttons, hairpins, any kind of pin.
There was a good explanation, however, as dozens
of columns of letters soon pointed out. Money had to
be saved somehow for the Campus Chest drive. Some
students wanted to do it by cutting out pins; the
others wanted to cut down on the annual council ban
quet, which costs nearly twiee as much as the pins
and keys.

When the guy who set his size twelves on your most
touchy corn becomes as graceful as u ballet dancer
When you can walk down the halls without being
shoved three rooms past the one you were headed
for . . .
Ihen there is no doubt about it; it IS election time
at City College of San Francisco, says the Guardsman
Or anywhere else, for that matter.
