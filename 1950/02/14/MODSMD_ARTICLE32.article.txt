Most of the Letters to the Editor which arrive at
The Daily Shack unsigned are deposited in the good
old floor file. Once in a while, however, we receive
an epistle like the one reprinted beluw. Our reasons
lor using this letter? (1) It is fairly amusing, and (2)

Dailey had a bad weekend and
couldn't face the thought of orig
inal composition. And, soooo. . . .

Re: Roble letter on serenading:
Our hearts go out to the newly
pinned Robleites of Wing C arid to
the fraternity men whose concerts
were so rudely interrupted by

our police force, We, too, have known police inter
ference in our social activities, and have developed a
system to deal with such interference. Therefore, we
most humbly recommend it to our sisters in distress.
Before the serenade, purchase a few (two or three
yrosi) penny balloons. Paper bags will do if balloons
are not leadily available, but they leak, leaving a trail
which can lead investigating authorities to the perpe
trators. Also, balloons can be kept longer, and can be
(oncealed much more easily in the clothing.
The third floor is the best altitude from which to
launch the missiles, since the first and second floors
aie too low and the balloons cannot attain enough
speed and force, and the fourth floor is too high to
permit accurate aiming.
When the police interfere with a serenade, a few

well-placed balloons will usually divert attention, and
the serenade can continue while Sam Shovel look;; for
the perpetrators of this dastardly deed.
We realize that the fine art of water-bagging has i
not been developed to any great extent in Roble. J
Therefore, we humbly offer the services of experts in |
this profession. We have specialists in procurement,
supply, loading, aiming, and launching, as well as I
several that are quite adept at looking innocent, and no J
one is better able to beat all raps, even when caught
red-handed, than our past-president. It might be sig- j
nilicant to note that, for all the waterbagging done by
this wing last week, we received a total of only .'!•}
hours in the Con Home.
it we can be of any service to any Kubleite wishing |
to learn the finer points of this time-honored Stanford
tradition, we may be called upon at any time, prefer- '
ably nights. We are always willing to serve a worthy
cause, and certainly the serenading of newly-pinned
girls j:. h custom worth maintaining.

production of "Boy Meets Girl" had the scene painter
listed not us a "scene painter," but rather "The Master

to wit, The Harmless Globe Squatters.

Re: Roble letter on serenading:
Our hearts go out to the newly
pinned Robleites of Wing C arid to
the fraternity men whose concerts
were so rudely interrupted by

our police force, We, too, have known police inter
ference in our social activities, and have developed a
system to deal with such interference. Therefore, we
most humbly recommend it to our sisters in distress.
Before the serenade, purchase a few (two or three
yrosi) penny balloons. Paper bags will do if balloons
are not leadily available, but they leak, leaving a trail
which can lead investigating authorities to the perpe
trators. Also, balloons can be kept longer, and can be
(oncealed much more easily in the clothing.
The third floor is the best altitude from which to
launch the missiles, since the first and second floors
aie too low and the balloons cannot attain enough
speed and force, and the fourth floor is too high to
permit accurate aiming.
When the police interfere with a serenade, a few

well-placed balloons will usually divert attention, and
the serenade can continue while Sam Shovel look;; for
the perpetrators of this dastardly deed.
We realize that the fine art of water-bagging has i
not been developed to any great extent in Roble. J
Therefore, we humbly offer the services of experts in |
this profession. We have specialists in procurement,
supply, loading, aiming, and launching, as well as I
several that are quite adept at looking innocent, and no J
one is better able to beat all raps, even when caught
red-handed, than our past-president. It might be sig- j
nilicant to note that, for all the waterbagging done by
this wing last week, we received a total of only .'!•}
hours in the Con Home.
it we can be of any service to any Kubleite wishing |
to learn the finer points of this time-honored Stanford
tradition, we may be called upon at any time, prefer- '
ably nights. We are always willing to serve a worthy
cause, and certainly the serenading of newly-pinned
girls j:. h custom worth maintaining.

Other signs that humor is not completely dead j
among the Stanford people are ottered by several
other chuckles we have come across during the past, j
few days.
{•"example: The program for the Stanford Players'
production of "Boy Meets Girl" had the scene painter
listed not us a "scene painter," but rather "The Master
Painter." (From the faraway hills?)
We also get a kick out of the name of one of the in
tramural basketball teams listed in last week's paper, j
to wit, The Harmless Globe Squatters.

Most of the Letters to the Editor which arrive at
The Daily Shack unsigned are deposited in the good
old floor file. Once in a while, however, we receive
an epistle like the one reprinted beluw. Our reasons
lor using this letter? (1) It is fairly amusing, and (2)

Dailey had a bad weekend and
couldn't face the thought of orig
inal composition. And, soooo. . . .
