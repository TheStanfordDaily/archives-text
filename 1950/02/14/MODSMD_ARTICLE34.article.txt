# Officer Will Discuss Navy Defense Hole
## 
### 
Captain John G. Crommelin, who
charged that present unification
policies were sinking the Navy, will
discuss "The Navy's Hole in Na- 1
tional Defense" to Reserve Officers
of the Naval Services (HONS)
members tonight at the Moffett j
Field Officers Club.
The address will mark one of the j
first public appearances for the 48- j
year-old Navy aviation hero since j
lie was reassigned to Treasure Is- j
land following the blowup over the
"Washington Papers."
He was the naval officer who se
cretly gave newsmen copies of let
ters from top admirals charging that
the unification plan was wrecking
the morale of the Navy and men
acing the national security.
"The Navy's offense is carrier and
aircraft. We can take the war away
from our homeland to the enemy
shores and force him to fight our
ships instead of our civilians,"
Crommelin said during (be Con
gressional investigation.
After the squabble, he was trans
ferred to the Western Sea Frontier
staff.
Crommelin, eldest of five broth
ers, all of whom were Annapolis
graduates, distinguished himself
during World War 11 aboard the
carrier "Enterprise," which sank the
Japanese battleship "Hiyei" off
Guadalcanal in 11)42. He was also
aboard the "Liscomb Bay" when it
caught a torpedo off the Gilbert fs

lands.
"Everyone is cordially invited to
heai Captain Crommelin. He lias
! promised to lt*t his hair clown and
answer questions," said Gilbert H.
Morrison, Palo Alio, HONS presi
dent.
The dinner-meeting starts at 8
j p.m.
