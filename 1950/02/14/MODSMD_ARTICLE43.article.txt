## On The Bench 
### 
Harvard's Johnny's (the term still startles me) are still whimpering about
the 44 to 0 grid loss to Stanford last year. A Harvard Crimson writer has
come up with the amazing theory that the Stanford "Buck-of-the-Month
Club" is designed primarily to pay salaries to our gallant gridsters. For the
information of any unfortunates who think like Harvardmen, not one single
dime of the Buck Club subscriptions goes to anything other than tuition.
Conference rulings permit all but $65 of tuition to be paid by these grants
in-aid.
Two Dozen Criilders
As of this quarter, there are about two dozen varsity footballers receiving
"grant-in-aid" help, and a good many of them are "third-stringers." Since
there are 71? men getting athletic aid, even a Harvard man should be able
to see that the Buck-of-the-Month glory-gold goes to something other
than football.
Speaking of the Johnnys: End Coach Mai Elward points out a wierd one.
Harvard Athletic Director Bill Bingham—whom Mai has known for some
years—was (in his youth) never interested in football and never played
football. Yet he has been chairman of the football rules committee for 15
years or so. . . . Bingham, thankfully, has been replaced in that task by
Michigander Fritz (4!) to 0 in the Rose Bowl) Crisler. . . . Harvard has
turned from a policy of non-emphasis of football to one of listening to the
endowment-minded alums who want a Crimson powerhouse like the good
old days—when Grantland Rice was young. ... In spite of the new spirit,
last year's coach, Art Valpey, has made like an Arab and will be exhibiting
his talents for the University of Connecticut next year.
Track for the Fans
Spiked-shoes stufT: Next track season will be an all-out spectator deal.
The field events —broad jump, pole vault, etc.—will all be done in front of
the sunny-side stands in the Stadium. Also all of the races will be started
so they finish in front of those same stands. In other words, the fan will be
able to sit in one place and see all. Another innovation will be the posting
of name cards showing what athletes are competing. Like a three-ring cir
cus. As Frosh Coach Ray Dean put it: "We're going first-cabin this year,
no more tourist class."
Unfortunately the spikesters will not meet Yale here. Academic conflict —
Yale has finals on our only open date. Which means that shot-putter Fuchs
(no spy) will not compete on the Stanford turf, that that round-ballers
Chandler and Davis will not be beaten by anyone but each other during the
regular season.
Chuck Taylor's Joh-isms: Roy Hughes, the genial Menlo grid coach, has
had his name bantered around the SF papers re: the freshman coaching
job here on the Farm. Nobody ha's yet gotten a quote from Roy on it. I got
one today. "I am interested in the job," says Roy. Also interested is Chuck's
assistant of last season, Boh Ghilotti. If the other candidates are as good as
these two, Stanford may be able to get along without the terrific Mr. Taylor.
use Single-Wing Rumors
Smog-stuff: The current river of rumors from Troyland of Coach (no
comment, please) JefT Cravath returning to the single-wing, may or may not
be true. But the rumors have been just as persistent every winter for the
last five years. On March 17, 1947, for example, two sophomore USC grid
ders became so alarmed over the single-wing whispers that they wrote
Coach Marchie Schwartz asking if they could transfer to Stanford. They
pointed out that they were both T-formation quarterbacks and were quite
willing to lose a year of eligibility in coming to Stanford rather than play
the box formation. The names? Jim Powers and Wilbur Robertson.
So, the issue of a Troyland single-wing is still in doubt. But since the ac
quisition of T-man Ed Demirjian. the red-and-golders must be planning
something with a tea and lemon flavor.
