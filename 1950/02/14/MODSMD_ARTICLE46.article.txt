# Hoover Holds Place In Stanford Athletics
## 
### EARL ODELL 
When Herbert Hoover first en
tered Stanford in 1891, the future
President of the United States was
interested in athletics. He arranged
his laboratory work so that he could
try out for the baseball team. He
made shortstop and might have
gone on to win his fame on the
diamond if a grounder hadn't tipped
the ring finger on his left hand,
thereby ending his career as an ath
lete. His finger remained swollen
for many years.
This accident, however, did not
prevent Herbert Hoover from enter
ing the Stanford sports annals. He
played an important role in the

first Stanford-California game, held
in San Francisco on March 19, 1892.
Together with two or three asso
ciates and Bert Lang of the Uni
versity of California, Hoover rented
the Haight Street grounds in San
Francisco for the game, and took the
responsibility of printing some 5,000
tickets. The job wasn't as easy as it
might appear, though. In the first
place the Haight Street grounds
were prepared for baseball and had
to be adjusted for a football game.
The greatest trouble occurred

when more people came than were
expected. The result was that they
ian out of tickets and had to set up
emergency booths to receive cash
payments for admissions. When
paid, the cashier would nod to the
boys handling the entrance gates to
indicate that it was o.k. to admit the
person or persons.
Unprepared for this emergency
measure, they found themselves
with an accumulation of cash which
had to be counted after the game.
Taking the cash with them in pails,
boxes, tubs, and whatever other
containers they could lay their
hands on, Hoover and his confeder
ates carried it to the California Ho
tel and spent most of the night
counting the money and dividing it
between the two universities.
First Student Treasurer
Herbert Hoover was also inter
ested in government, even in those
early days, although in this case it
was the Stanford Associated Stu
dents government. It was in the role
of Stanford's first treasurer in his
senior year that Hoover again made
himself known in the men's locker
rooms.
Hoover returned from his summer
vacation in 1894 to find Stanford's
student finances in bad shape. That
year, after putting through a pro
gram for handling the finances of
the student organizations, he was
elected treasurer of the student
body and managed athletic funds
without a salary, although a salary
was called for* in the constitution.
Year Netted $33,000
As financial manager, Hoover
traveled with the football team that
year in order to oversee all money
matters. The Hoover-financed var
sity of 1894 played nine games in
Palo Alto. San Francisco, Sacra
mento, Santa Cruz, and Los Ange
les. They scored 100 points by way
of 19 touchdowns and 12 kicked
goals against their opponents' 58
points. The team, along with their
financial manager, traveled 1,500
miles, played before an aggregate of
21.700 spectators for a total gate of
approximately $33,000.
Treasurer Hoover's first financial
report listed, in his Receipts from
Football Season under Detailed
Statements of Games, among the
many items the following:
Flags for streetcars, $18; bank, for
service, $40; police, $20 (evidently
the eity didn't pay their police force
enough in those days); and building
grandstand and repairs, $1,007 â€”thus
showing Hoover to be very meticu
lous to say the least.
Herbert Hoover may go down in
history as the nation's 31st Presi
dent; he may go down in history as
a great statesman he may go down
in history as the last great Republi
can. But to Stanfordites he will go
down in history as the man who set
the Stanford football team on its
own two feet.
