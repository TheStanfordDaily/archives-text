# Churchill Urges Truce
## 
### 
EDINBURGH, Scotland-Winston
Churchill tonight urged a new Bin
Three conference to reach a truce
in the hatreds between the Eastern
and Western worlds.
If the Conservatives win Britain's
general election nine days hence,
the participants in any such confer
ence presumably would be Church
ill. Joseph Stalin, and President
Truman.
