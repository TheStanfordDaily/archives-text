# 'STILL LOOKS TOWARD THE WEST'
## Dr. Fisher Reviews Politics in Asia 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
"Why is Amcrica so worried
about Russia?"
This is one of the questions Asians
most often ask about the mysterious
West, said Dr. Harold H. Fisher,
chairman of the Hoover Institute
and Library, in a press conference
yesterday.
In India, according to Dr. Fisher,
who just returned from a confer
ence on Indian-American relations
held in New Delhi, there is little
war hysteria or articulate fear of
the Communists. In fact, Commu
nism in the East is in itself different
from Communism in Europe.
Ft is not an alternative to democ
racy and to capitalism, which do not
themselves exist there, but is rather
one system which offers a solution
to three of the Orient's most press
ing problems the struggle for in
dependence, the need for an escape
from the burdens of poverty, and a
"tremendous desire for education
and a desperate shortage of teach
ers, schools, and equipment."
The problem posed by Commu
nism, Fisher added, is "not too se
rious in India." The Indian Com
munists, a small group, are prob
ably in contact with Russia, and
may get moral and financial sup
port, but lie doubts that they take
orders from Moscow.
Stopped in Far East
Dr. Fisher's round-the-world trip
also included stops throughout the

Middle and Far East and the Pacific,
where he observed conditions and
gathered material for the Hoover
Library on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
"All of Asia has now been brought
jn contact with the Western world,
and is going through the painful and
i difficult process of transforming its
j institutions to meet, the require
ments of a scientific and industrial
Civilization," Fisher explained. The
basic need is a transformation of
outlook. For example, "The peasant
! hasn't been convinced that there's
! any point in using scientific agricul
ture."
However, "we can't impose upon
i Asians our patterns of democracy;
j the standards we apply here have
no application in Asia at all." Fish
er concluded that the form of de
mocracy is less important in the Far
j East than the general behavior of
! those countries in the community of
| nations.
One of the applications of this
principle can be seen in Japan,
Fisher says. He was favorably im
pressed by the occupation policies
there, and feels that such innova
tions as the open discussion of pub
lic issues may be retained after the
; Americans leave. However, the Jap
| ancsc arc now accepting anything
that is handed to them, and they
may return later to concentration of
I economic enterprise and other insti

tutions which they have discarded
under American pressure.
The Trust Areas
Another example is in the Ameri
can-administered trust territories
the Marianas, the Carolinas, and the
Marshalls. There the people work
only to meet their own needs, and
before the war the Japanese sup
plied the incentive for development.
The problem in such pie-industrial
territories is whether to change
anachronistic institutions and cause
confusion, or work within, and
thereby preserve, the institutions, as
the Japanese did.
Dr. Fisher believes, alone with
most Asians, that the United States
is paying too little attention to the
East, and that in the long run its
problems will be more important to
ns than those of Europe. But they
must be dealt with differently, since
in Asia there arc no institutions
through which aid can be given.
We must deal directly with the
people on the land, helping them
with land shortage, irrigation, pro
duction, and marketing.
"If we do not give this leader
ship," said Fisher, "the Communists
will." He added that such aid can
best he given through a UN agency.
"Are Chinese First?"
Fisher noted, in regard to China,
that the Chinese Communists arc
Chinese first and Communists sec
ond Most Chinese, he feels, will
support the new government, since

il will unify China.
He again emphasized thai Com
munism in Asia does not have
same connotation that it does in the
West. In China "bandits call them
selves Communists to become a lit
tle more respectable." Flo added
that with the Communists "the ide
ology of Robin Hood robbing the
rich and giving to the poor is more
important than the ideology of Karl
Marx."
Or. Fisher left Stanford -
her 24 for his first trip to the far
East. He traveled by air, auto, .jeep
("the universal vehicle in the East")
and rickshaws hitched to bicycles.
("In some highly developed areas
they use motorcycles v/tih the rick
shaws.")
In collecting material for the !
Hoover Library he noted that most
scholarship in Asia is the work ol
foreigners. He had heard much
about a book on economics in Bur
ma that was "the real thing," only
to find out that it was published
by the Stanford University Press
("Burmese Economic Life," by J. ;
Russell Andtus).
Fisher admitted that lie had start- |
erl with a "not very optimistic view- :
point." He found that the problems ;
of the Far East were even more j
complex and serious than he bad
realized, but he doesn't think that
all Asia will become "an extension
of the Soviet Union." Asia, he be
lieves, still looks toward the West.
