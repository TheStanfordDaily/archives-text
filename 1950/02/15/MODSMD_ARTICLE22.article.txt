# Harvard Cancels Grid Game With Cardinals
## Johnnies Seek Kinder Schedule; Relinquish Thoughts of Revenge 
### AL BERRY 
Harvard, the grand old school of the East, yesterday broke off
football relations with Stanford University.
The announcement came from Cambridge when Harvard Pro
vost Paul H. Buck announced that the Crimson-Cardinal grid con
test, scheduled for September 30, had been cancelled "to lighten

a far too heavy schedule." The game
was to have been played in the
Harvard Bowl, the second game of
a home - and - homo agreement be
tween the two schools. Tho first
game of that agreement was played
last September 24 when the Cards
tagged the Harvards, 44-0.
' Licbendorfer Surprised
On the Farm, University officials
held a noncommittal position. Don
Liebendorfer, Director of Athletic
Publicity, stated, "We regret losing
Harvard from our schedule very
much, but the circumstances are
such that we can do nothing but
accept their request to cancel the
game." Liebendorfer also had no
information regarding a possible re
placement for the new gap in the
Indian schedule. "The thing came
as too much of a surprise and it is

too early to make plans," he said.
"We may have an open date."
Man-on-the-street rumors, how
ever, hinted strongly at a possible
renewing of the grid war with USF.
The Hilltoppers had a fairly good
team last year, and—in spite of the
recent signing with California—are
reportedly interested in playing the
Indians.
Athletics De-emphasized
The action by Harvard, which
must have caused great embarrass
ment to Crimson grid fans, came on
the heels of a de-emphasis of ath
letics program that last fall caused
the Johnnies to lose eight out of
nine games, and more recently
caused their fire-eating, a la Michi
gan coach, Art Valpey, to leave the
ivy halls for the University of Con
necticut.
It has been no secret that the uni
versity fathers have been under
considerable fire by alumni and oth
ers since last fall in regard to Har
vard's poor gridiron showing. Since
the alumni reportedly do not want
complete abandonment of football,
Harvard is now striving for a more
delicate schedule.
This new schedule, according to
yesterday's press release from Cam
bridge, would include "only Ivy
League and traditional rivals."
