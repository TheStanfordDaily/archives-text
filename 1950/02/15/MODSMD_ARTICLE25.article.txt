### ROWLAND REBELE 
Performing before one of the lar
gest Tuesday Evening Series audi
ences in many a month—more than
1.70 ft person — the San Francisco
Ballet Company turned the spot
light on "the danse" last night with
its presentation of the new ballet,
"Prelude."
Tracing the career if a typical
dancer, "Junie," through the five
steps in her rigorous, eight year
ballet training period, "Prelude"
might, more aptly have been titled
"Ballet for the Millions.''
For it brought to its audience the
behind the - scenes picture of the
"patience, dedication, and courage"
that go into the making of a polished
member of the Corp'; dr Ballet.
While more than a few of the
"millions" were standing in the rear
of Mem And for lack of available
seats. Low Christensen, writer and
narrator of "Prelude," was explain
ing .Junie's ascendency from the
basic foot and arm movements to
the intricate teamwork and toe
work movements of the veteran
dancer.
Director Christensen and his
troupe of 20 dancers were well as
sisted by piano accompanist Raoul
Paniagua. A series of tho company's
own backdrops and lighting effects
added color to an already engaging
performance.
