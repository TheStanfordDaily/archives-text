# Changing Social Procedures
## 
### 
Tonight Excom will vote on several proposed
changes to the social procedures for extiacur
licular activities regulations.
The changes are mostly minor ones, but they
will nevertheless allect every organised group
or club on campus, and it will be important loi
every organization president and social chair
man to know what changes are passed and how
they will affect then organization.
Perhaps the most important change is the one
affecting patrons for on or oft campus func
tions. If it is passed, groups planning to hold
social functions during the year will have to
submit within two weeks ol the beginning of
(all quarter each year a list of couples who wish
lo be their patrons, for University approval.
Names of couples may be added or substituted
within two weeks of the beginning of each sue
feeding quarter.
Classes will have to submit a similar list 10
days before any class function.
It these lists are not handed in lor approval,
the group must use as pations only members ol
the faculty holding positions of instructor or
above, administrative officials of the Univer
sity, resident assistants, or housemothers, all of

whom are automatically approved.
In another change worthy of consideration,
it is proposed that there shall be no social func
lions during a period of six days (dead week)
immediately preceding the end quarter exami
nations.
We feel that no exceptions should be made
lo tins rule, even though many believe that
Christmas pu/ties in fall quarter would warrant
one. If we begin giving occasional parties dur
ing dead week, the faculty will feel the same
way about occasional exams during that period.
Since we consider the "no quizzes, no exams
during dead week" tiadition a worthwhile one
lo keep, we should be willing to hold Christmas
parties the week before dead week.
Another change is the proposal that 12
o'clock dates shall be granted for those func
lions which aie lo be held on Sunday nights.
We believe that Sunday is a very definite
part of the weekend, and that midnight is a
sufficiently early curfew for any function tak
ing place in the vicinity of the campus.
We think that these changes clarify and
simplify the social procedures as they now
stand. -S.E.T.
