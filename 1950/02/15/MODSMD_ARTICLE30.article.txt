# Those False Fire Alarms
## 
### 
An old and malicious form of practical joke
lias been endangering student lives on campus
during the past few days—the false fire alarm.
The students who risk their lives die the
campus firemen who answer the alarms, 'l'hey
are students who must be alert day and night to
protect the lives and property of the Univer
sity, their fellow students, and the rest of the
Stanford community. When an alarm comes in
they dash to its source at an abnormal speed, in
hopes of guickly checking the fire that is pre
sumably the cause of the alunn.
in their hurry, these students, all trained fiie
fighters, face dangers not experienced by the
cautious motorist. Speeding fire trucks often
skid around corners, brush objects along the
side of the road, or come face-to face with ob
structing traffic. In each case, the fireman takes
his life in his own hands and trusts to the driver,
and fire truck drivers are not infallible.
Speeding to a false alairn recenily took the
life of Battalion Chief John Webb in San Fran
cisco and crippled his driver for life. It is an inci

dent which could happen here. Several months
ago, a Stanford fixe truck collided with a con
crete abutment while speeding to a fire. Luck
ily. no one was injured.
Monday night firemen turned out for a call
at Cabrillo and Dolores where a false alarm had
been turned in, just 46 hours after a similar
alarm at a nearby box. Alert witnesses at the
Sigma Nu House were able to give a partial
description of a car seen at the box when the
alarm was sent in.
There is a good chance that no Stanford stu
dent was to blame for the alarm. We hope not.
If one waSi let him and others think twice
before repeating the incident. If the alarm was
sent in by an outsider it is unlikely that an ap
peal such as this would strike his conscience.
Therefore, it should be the duty of every Stan
ford student to be alert for these vicious joke
sters, and report to the police or fire depart
ment any person or persons suspected of turn
ing in a false alarm.
