## Midweek Musings 
### 
On a Dreamer's Holiday
Don't believe what you read the papers, men. There's still a mathematical
chance lor Stanford to cop the Southern Division title! Naturally, this is
.strictly through somebody's reefer; but what the heck, it's fun playing
Humes. Anyway, here's the way it could work:
Stanford wins all six of its remaining games.
IJC'LA loses all six.
drops four, winning only the two from the Bruins.
(al whips all but Stanford, thereby losing two.
All ol which leaves our beloved Indians at the top of the heap with five
losses, Cal and the Trojans knotted at six and .six, and the Bruins hibernating
iu the cellar with seven defeats.
Gimme another, Frankie.
Red Face Department
Alter the results of the past weekend, we're ready lo eat a few of the keys
ot our typewriter. But not all of them.
First, we made some disparaging remarks concerning the basketball
ability ol a couple of southern schools. We erred by including UCLA in
the same class with USC.
For the weekend activities did point out one fact beyond doubt: UCLA
owns a real ball club, in spite of their six straight defeats a few paragraphs
above.
Tin it- after time Friday night their fast break beat the defense down the
fiooi lo lilt- Bruin bucket. The Wfestwonders played 40 minutes ol hustling,
driving ball at breakneck speed, yet were cool and craftsmanlike at the
business of putting the ball in the basket. Curl Krauxhaar turned in an
in juring performance at the post, easily the outstanding individual per
formance of the evening; but the bucket work of Alan Sawyer and the gen
t-ral lltjor play of Joeckel, Stanich, Sheldrake, et al, also deserves praise.
Also last week we stated our personal opinion that Bill Sharman is merely
. ii average all-around ball player who happens to possess a great shooting
eye. (Jui statement brought one very consistent reaction: we were in
stantly promoted lo the no. 1 spot on everybody's public enemy list. We've
heard that fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong. If that holds for ap
proximately the same number of sportswi iters and hoop fans, then we must
concede defeat.
Down lor the Ten Count
Enough of this theorizing. Stanford battles both Southland squads again
this week. To Yurdley, Carver, Chavalas, and the other seniors on Everett
Dea/i's varsity, the coming weekend represents their next to last opportunity
ti. whip Bullet Bill and the men from Troy. The count now stands at 10
straight for USC. A few of the 10 have been close, others not so close, but
always the Southland muscle-men have come out on top.
That Stanford can whip USC was adequately proven al the Pavilion
Saturday night. It'll be tougher with the Trojans playing at home, but still
ic can be done.
So, just for once, let's give the old phrase a reverse twist: we've been
Sharmanized enough, now let's wax the Trojans.
Floral Division
Let's pass out the week's posies. One goes to little Jack O'Sullivan for
his drive, dribble, and dunk performance of Friday eve. Jack almost out-
Bruined the Bruins.
The other bouquet, of course, is tagged for George the Bird, who was an
all-American ball player Saturday night.
At Last â€¢
Biggest news of the day is Harvard's cancellation of its September game
with tlie Indians (story is on page 1); and the unofficial opinion around
Stanford sports circles was probably best summed up by bossman Al Berry:
"At last, we've scared somebody."
