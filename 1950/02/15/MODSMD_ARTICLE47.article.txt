# Italian Skier Cops Aspen Giant Slalom
## 
### 
ASPEN, Colo., Feb. 14 (/P>â€”Zeno
Colo sped a mile and a quarter
down Mount Aspen in one minute
and 54.4 seconds today to win the
men's Giant Slalom world ski title.
On the mammoth course, where
daring paid off, the squat 29-year
old Italian farmer bounded through
the 35 gates on his 1,600-foot de
scent to defeat his nearest rival,
Fernand Grosjean of Switzerland,
by eight-tenths of a second.
A disappointment to the 4,000

spectators, who included Governor
Lee Knous of Colorado and movie
star Gary Cooper who has a home
here, was the failure of the U.S.
team.
