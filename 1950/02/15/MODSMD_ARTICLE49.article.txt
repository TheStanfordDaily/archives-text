## Wrestlers Eager For Playoff Win 
### JOE CUSICK 
The Indian wrestling squad makes
its second home appearance of the
season tonight at 7:30 in Encina
Gym when they play host to San
Francisco State. Farm mat fans can
expect an outstanding performance
with some very close matches in the
ofFing.
Two weeks ago in the 'Gators' San
Francisco gym, the two contingents
tied with a IG-all team score. The
Card varsity, which has since gar
nered a second place in the Coast
Junior AAU meet and lost a close
one to a powerful San Jose State
squad, is prepared to t;ike this
match, according to Coach Win
Mumby.
Feature bouts will include Cap
tain Don Williams' 130 - lb. battle
with State's Jerry Friedman; 153—1b.
Niles Severin's match with Adolf
Kelly; and the light - heavyweight
tussle.
DeWitt Question Mark
Dick DeWitt is scheduled to go at
175 lbs. for Stanford, but a gashed
eyebrow may keep him out. Mum
by has not announced who will
wrestle in DeWitt's place if that
move is necessary. In the last meet
ing, DeWitt decisioned Cliff Gray
after getting several near falls on
the Stater.
Don Williams couldn't get on to
Friedman's unorthodox style in
their last match but he may have it
mastered for tonight's bout. The ex-

perienced 'Gator grappler won by a i
small margin in the last match.
' Niles Severin and Adolf Kelly,
wrestling in the 155-lb. division, had
an exceptionally close match two
weeks ago with Severin finally get
ting the decision by virtue of top
time. Under collegiate rules one or '
two points may be awarded the j
man who has been in the preferred ;
position one or more minutes than j
his opponent.
Look for Repeat
Dick Esbenshade, 121 lbs., and
Steve Garst, heavyweight, both
pinned their men in the previous J
match and are looking for repeat j
wins.

128 lbs.—Dick Cruce (S) vs. Joe
Kimura (SFS).
145 lbs.—Rollin Rose (S) vs. Bob J
Cunningham (SFS).
