# COMMUNISTS IN CHINA
## Reds Seem More Efficient, But Lack Real Democracy 
### DAVID WONG 
America is now castinu anxious
eyes upon a Communist China.
Americans everywhere are trying to
form some idea of the Chinese Com
munists from the various articles
which have been written about them.
The opinions expressed in such ar
ticles are many and varied.
For the past few weeks I have
been gathering information about
the Chinese Communists from doz
ens of people who have lived—and
some who are still living—under the
Communist regime. This article is
based on the information thus re
ceived and also on certain documents
published by the Communists them
selves.
The general opinion of the people
consulted is that the Communists are
more efiiicient than the Nationalists
in small-scale administrative work,
and that there is an apparent lack of
corruption in their officials. The
Communist soldiers are also said to
be much better disciplined than the
Nationalist soldiers.
The shortcomings of the Commu
nists are cited by the informants as
their lack of real democracy, their
one-sided foreign policy, their polit
ical radicalism, and their inexpe
rience in national government. The
economic situation seems to have
further deteriorated under the Com
munists, resulting in business and
industrial stagnation and increased
unemployment and crime waves.

[ The Communists are fighting against
the old problem of infiltration with
no more success than the Nationalists,
and their taxes are reported to be i
just as high.
Land Is Redistributed
In Northern China, the Commu
nists have carried out land redistri- 1
! bution after killing some of the land
lords. Anyone owning more than 31)
I "maos" of land is considered a land- |
: lord, a "inao" being about a third of
| an acre. However, some farmers have
refused to accept additional land be
cause the more land one owns, the !
higher the rate of taxes.
As far as education is concerned,
the Communists have abolished j
many courses in history, literature, J
philosophy, political science, and J
economics. All college professors, i
with the exception of those in Shang
hai universities, were forced to un
dergo programs of political indoc
trination. The Communists have also !
established what are known as "revo- j
lutionary universities."
These universities ax*e open to all
! students, ranging from grammar j
school students to graduates of for
eign universities. Attendance is en
! tirely voluntary, but if one is not a
: graduate of a revolutionary univer
| sity, he will experience "great diffi
culties" in securing employment.
Courses of study at these universi
ties arc confined to Marx-Leninism, j
j and students can graduate in three J
| months.
Other political parties are toler- ,
I ated by the Communists so long as
they are so weak that their strength
is insignificant. The leaders of minor
j political parties are now housed at
the luxurious Peking Hotel in Pci
ping. However, they are extremely i
well guarded by Communist troops,
j and it is impossible to see any of
j them without first obtaining permis
sion from the Communists.
Very Little Freedom
There is practically no personal
j freedom under the Communists.
, Communist soldiers are quartered at
almost every private home in the i
| cities, and "inspection" of houses is ' {
j a common occurrence. Furthermore, |
I everyone is required to attend daily [
meetings at which Communists doc
' trines are expounded. Anyone seen

wearing a new dross or talking to
gether in a group of more than four
persons is soon placed under suspi
cion.
The question of whether the Chi
nese Communists are controlled by
Russia can be best answered by the
Communists themselves. During
their plenums, a resolution was
passed stating that every Chinese
Communist owes his allegiance first
ly to the Cominform and secondly to
the Communist Party of China. The
attitude of the Chinese Communists
is further expressed in the Sino-
Russian "friendship drives." Books
on Russia are being printed by the
millions and sold to the general pub
lic at low prices.
Russian Assistance
To keep up their end in these
friendship drives, the Russians have
promised to send G,000,000 books to
China. Russian "missionaries" have
helped in planning city sanitary sys
tems and building railroads and
bridges, but each has been careful to
see that he receives his full measure
of favorable publicity for his work.
Whether Communism will prove
beneficial to the Chinese people is a
question which time alone can an
swer, but it can be said now that the
majority of the Chinese people con
sulted are not in favor of Commu
nism. Most of them seem to adopt a
middle-of-the-road attitude.
