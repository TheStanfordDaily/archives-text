SACRAMENTO — A tentative
meeting date of March 7 was set
by Governor Warren today for a
meeting of the State Disaster Coun
cil—a step in reviving California's
air raid warning system.
California, Oregon, and Washing
lon have been asked by Secretary of
Defense Louis Johnson to set up the
warning stations. Warren estimated
at a press conference 25,000 persons
would be required to operate the
observation posts and aircraft posi
tion plotting ccnters in the state.
