WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (/P)
Coal peace talks finally Mot down to
business late today after being
snagged on a new quarrel at the
start of court-ordered bargaining.
A walkout of Southern operators
interrupted the talks for two and a
half hours while the nationwide
strike tightened its grip on the
country's economy.
When the conference recessed for
the night David L. Cole, chairman
of President Truman's strike fact
finding board, reported there had
been discussion of the "general eco
nomics of the coal industry."
Operators said they were not op
timistic about any quick end to the
strike which has brought spreading
fuel strangulation to industry and
the threat of co!d furnaces to homes.
