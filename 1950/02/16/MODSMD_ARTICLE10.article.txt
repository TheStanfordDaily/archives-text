# Stanford Nine Opens Season This Afternoon
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Hopeful as a kid on Christmas
morning, Coach Everett Dean
will unwrap his new baseball
team before the eager eyes of
Stanford horsehide fans this
afternoon as the Stanford varsity
makes its first appearance of the
1950 season. The game will be
played on the Sunken Diamond,
j and will start at 3:15.
On hand to provide the eompeti- j
tion will ho tho St.. Louis Browns
Rookies, a collection of collar, high
j school, and semi-pro stars who have
; inked the dotted line on Brownie
j contracts, and who arc anxious to get j
; in some work before they depart for
the Browns' spring camp. Just who
; the American League club has in tow
j remains to be seen, but it should be
I able to muster enough opposition to
give the Cards a good test in their
| first outing.
The game assumes significance be- )
[ cause i< will preview a Stanford team
| that is potentially the best of any that
i Stanford ha.s fielded since the war, |
and because it will mark the debut of
| Everett Dean as a varsity baseball
\ coach.
Infield Question
It's no secret that Dean's hag is |
(illod with goodies this year, hut
j whether lie will he able to solve the
I infield riddle, develop some pitching,
j and come up with a winning conibi-
J nation is something else again.
The infield picture was further |
clouded this week when it. was an- !
nounced that. Co-Captain Charlie
| Cole would remain in centerfield in
stead of returning to first base as if, j
was expected that he would. The :
Sunken Diamond possesses one of the
largest center pastures in baseball, j
and it is felt that Cole's speed would
be of greater use out there.
C'lcgg Moves??
Secondly, there arc rumors that
Dick CleKg, last year's first sackor, |
will also get. a try in the outfield.
ClcÃŸg, who started out as a catcher, !
then as a first-baseman, played out
field in a sand-lot league last, sum
mer, and reportedly wants a chance
to show his worth as a fielder. Dick
hit ..'S.TI in CIBA competition last
season, so he's sure to be a starter, I
but to find out just where, we'll have
to wait until he is able to report at
j the end of the basketball season.
All of this leaves shortstop and Co- I
Captain Dave Melton as the only in
fieldcr who played much last season.
To say that there's an infield prob
lem is understating the matter con
siderably.
Fchi-ing, Hammed Coach
Coach Dean probably won't be on
hand to throw out the first ball of the
season this afternoon as the basket
ball season is still on, and his scrv
; ices are needed at the Pavilion.
The team is now under the active
direction of grid assistants Dutch j
j Fchring and Ray Hammctt, and will I
| remain so until Dean is able to de- j
i vote his full time to baseball. Ham- |
j met served as Coach Harry Wol- !
i tor's right-hand man last season, and j
' Fehring has had baseball coaching :
I experience at other schools.
