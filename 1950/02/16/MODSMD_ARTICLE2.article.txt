### 
LONDON—A number of Eastern
European nations were reported to
day to be forging, in concert with
Russia, a multi-million-dollar trade
pact with Communist China.
The countries are identified—be
sides Russia —as Poland, Czechoslo
vakia, and Finland. Finland, while
anti-Communist, is dependent upon
the good will of neighbor Russia.
Delegations from these countries
have been in Moscow during the
lengthy Chinese - Russian talks
which culminated yesterday with
the signing of a new Sino-Sovict
treaty.
The effect of such an agreement,
which would be on an interlocking
basis, would be to weld European
and Asiatic Communism even more
closely.
