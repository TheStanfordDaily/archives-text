# Chinese Communists Look Toward Russiaâ€” Hostility for Western Powers Increases
## 
### DAVID WONG 
The one-sided policy of the Chi-
I ne.se Communists is now apparent to
j all. The Communists have thumbed
their noses at all the Western pow
ers, and especially at the United
States. Even Great Britain's recog
nition of the Communist regime has
not drawn any amiability, for the
Communists have declared their re
j lationship with Britain is based
| strictly on trade, and not on friend-
I ship.
The Communists regard Russia as
China's only real friend, and they
have been trying to sell this idea to
the Chinese people. Russian is now
being taught in the schools instead
of English; Russian goods are flood
ing the market; and Russian movies
have replaced American ones.
Though the Communists have not.
openly asked foreigners to leave
| China, they have certainly made
[ and arc still making the stay of the
j foreigners (not including Russians)
in China as unpleasant as possible.
It i.s natural, therefore, for the
Communists to rid their govern
ment departments of foreigners. The
Chinese Maritime Customs has al
ways employed a large number of
foreigners in key positions, but since
the Communists took over, many of
the foreigners have "resigned." In
| the Kowloon Customs Station, all
the foreigners have left with the ex
ception of an Acting Marine Sur
veyor named G. Bogie, who is a
Russian.
Foreign middle - man business
' concerns are also being starved out

of China. The Communists are al
ready laying plans for the estab
lishment of a state-owned import
and export program fashioned after
the Russian Amorg. The plan en
tails the establishment of state-op
| crated offices in major cities abroad,
and calls for government-to-gov
ernment dealings in trade.
Even missionaries are not wcl
i corned, and there i.s evidence of
j pressure being applied on them too.
A group of American Catholic fa-
I thers who were on their way back
to America from Communist China
I spoke highly of Communist effi
ciency when I interviewed them.
However, when I asked them if they
had any unfavorable criticism of the
Communists, they said: "There are
still many members of our mission
in Communist China. We can say
| no more."
Many foreigners believe that
there will be no radical modification
of this basic policy even if diplo-
I ma tic recognition is accorded the
Communist regime by the rest of
the Western powers. They feel that
j diplomatic representation may be
better than no diplomatic represen
tation at all, but there is little hope
of changing the state of affairs.
With the Communist policy as it
is, it will be absurd to argue that
non-recognition of the Communist
regime would only drive the Chi
nese Communists further into the
arms of Russia. It can be said that
complete collaboration between the
Chinese Communists and Russia has
| already been accomplished.

However, although thr Chinese
people as a whole do not. want Com
munism, they may yet be able to
work out some sort of a compromise
with the Communists, hut it is high
ly unlikely that they will ever com
promise with Russia.
This is substantiated by a survey
of opinion in one of the Shanghai
factories by the Communists. The
workers were asked which was the
best and which was the worst for
eign country. The Communists were
surprised when the majority answer
was that America was the best for
eign country because she gave flour
to the Chinese, and thai Russia was
the worst foreign country because
she had wrested back many of the
old Czarist imperialistic rights in
China which she had volunarily re
nounced in 1921.
Russia's control of Dairrn, Fort
Arthur, {md the Changchun Rail
way, and Russia's removal of $2,-
000,000,000 worth of industrial ma
terial from Manchuria, are common
knowledge among the Chinese peo
ple.
But the explanation given by the
Communists was that Russian con
trol of the two ports was essential in
protecting China from American
"imperialism," and that the control
of the railway was necessary lo fa
cilitate the effective control of the
ports. It was further explained that
since the interests of China and
Russia in the world revolution were
identical, Russian control of the
ports and the railway would be the
same as Chinese control.

A group of American Catholic fa-
I thers who were on their way back
to America from Communist China
I spoke highly of Communist effi
ciency when I interviewed them.
However, when I asked them if they
had any unfavorable criticism of the
Communists, they said: "There are
still many members of our mission
in Communist China. We can say

Many foreigners believe that
there will be no radical modification
of this basic policy even if diplo-
I ma tic recognition is accorded the
Communist regime by the rest of
the Western powers. They feel that
j diplomatic representation may be
better than no diplomatic represen
tation at all, but there is little hope
of changing the state of affairs.
With the Communist policy as it
is, it will be absurd to argue that
non-recognition of the Communist
regime would only drive the Chi
nese Communists further into the
arms of Russia. It can be said that
complete collaboration between the
Chinese Communists and Russia has
| already been accomplished.

However, although thr Chinese
people as a whole do not. want Com
munism, they may yet be able to
work out some sort of a compromise
with the Communists, hut it is high
ly unlikely that they will ever com
promise with Russia.
This is substantiated by a survey
of opinion in one of the Shanghai
factories by the Communists. The
workers were asked which was the
best and which was the worst for
eign country. The Communists were
surprised when the majority answer
was that America was the best for
eign country because she gave flour
to the Chinese, and thai Russia was
the worst foreign country because
she had wrested back many of the
old Czarist imperialistic rights in
China which she had volunarily re
nounced in 1921.
Russia's control of Dairrn, Fort
Arthur, {md the Changchun Rail
way, and Russia's removal of $2,-
000,000,000 worth of industrial ma
terial from Manchuria, are common
knowledge among the Chinese peo
ple.
But the explanation given by the
Communists was that Russian con
trol of the two ports was essential in
protecting China from American
"imperialism," and that the control
of the railway was necessary lo fa
cilitate the effective control of the
ports. It was further explained that
since the interests of China and
Russia in the world revolution were
identical, Russian control of the
ports and the railway would be the
same as Chinese control.
The one-sided policy of the Chi-
I ne.se Communists is now apparent to
j all. The Communists have thumbed
their noses at all the Western pow
ers, and especially at the United
States. Even Great Britain's recog
nition of the Communist regime has
not drawn any amiability, for the
Communists have declared their re
j lationship with Britain is based
| strictly on trade, and not on friend-
I ship.
The Communists regard Russia as
China's only real friend, and they
have been trying to sell this idea to
the Chinese people. Russian is now
being taught in the schools instead
of English; Russian goods are flood
ing the market; and Russian movies
have replaced American ones.
Though the Communists have not.
openly asked foreigners to leave
| China, they have certainly made
[ and arc still making the stay of the
j foreigners (not including Russians)
in China as unpleasant as possible.
It i.s natural, therefore, for the
Communists to rid their govern
ment departments of foreigners. The
Chinese Maritime Customs has al
ways employed a large number of
foreigners in key positions, but since
the Communists took over, many of
the foreigners have "resigned." In
| the Kowloon Customs Station, all
the foreigners have left with the ex
ception of an Acting Marine Sur
veyor named G. Bogie, who is a
Russian.
