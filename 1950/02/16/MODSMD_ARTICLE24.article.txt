SEATTLE, Feb. 15 (AP) —Coast Guard headquarters reported
late today all 17 men aboard a "ditched" B-36 bomber had been
accounted for and 14 have been rescued.
The information came from the Coast Guard station at Annette
Island, near Ketchikan, Alaska, and the Port Angeles, Washington,
♦station.

The reports said a PBY amphibious
plane has taken 10 of the survivors
off the cutter White Holly and Is
flying them to Port Hardy, B.C.
Four others are aboard a Cana
dian fishing vessel alongside the cut
ter and three remaining crewmen are
on the beach of an island in the
Queen Charlotte group off the Brit
ish Columbia coast.
One of the men, Sgt. Vitale Trip
podi, Brooklyn, N.Y., was said to be
critically injured and may not live.
He was trapped on a cliff for more
than 10 hours after parachuting from
the crippled bomber and is feared to
have gangrene in both feet.
Reports relayed from the cutter
, and PBY said the survivors related
they bailed out of the flaming B-36
at an altitude of 5,000 feet, and all
left the giant bomber within 10 sec
i onds. •
Survivors Wet and Cold
Capt. Vance King, commander of
the fishing vessel Cape Perry which
picked the first 10 survivors up from
, the beach said in a ship-shore tele
phone call tonight that all were "very
wet, very played-out, and cold."
They recovered quickly when
given warm food and dry clothing.
The first man was rescued at 12:30
p.m. (PST) and the 10th man at 2
o'clock.
The Cape Perry later tied up to the
Coast Guax-d vessel White Holly until
the men were picked up by a flying
! boat.
The scene of the rescues is about
400 miles northwest of Vancouver
and about 85 miles south of Prince
Rupert, B.C.
Capt. H. L. Barry of Hillsborough,
111., captain of the six-engine bomber,
said all of the 16 crew members and
a lieutenant colonel flying as a pas
senger bailed out over the islands
! after three engines caught fire on a
flight from Alaska to Fort Worth,
i Texas.
"I was the only crew member to
| land in the water," Captain Barry
told the Canadian press in a radio
telephone interview.
"I came down in the middle of a
lake on Ashdown Island, but made
shore safely.
"All the crew have been soaking
wet since the crash. Other than Sgt.
Vitale Trippodi, the men are in fine
shape but very tired."
Sergeant Trapped on Cliff
Sex-geant Trippodi was reported
trapped on a cliff for more than 10
hours. He was hanging by one foot,
caught in a crevice, when rescuers
x-eached him this morning.
"He is in bad shape," said the caD
tain at that time. "Hp is still on the
island and the fishing boat Cape
Perry is sending a party ashore to
try and bring him down."
The Cape Perry was the fishing
boat that picked up the first sur
i vivors.
Princess Royal Island, one of thosb
I from which survivors were rescued,
is close to the tnainland, just north
of where Hecate Strait and Queen
Charlotte Sound meet.
In his description of the "ditching"
of the big B-36, Captain Barry said:
"The plane iced up at 1,500 feet.
We tried to climb, but fire broke out
in No. 1 engine and flames showed
above the engine.
"Two minute 3 later No. 2 burst into
flames. We stai-ted to lose altitude.
We were dropping at 300 feet a min
ute. Fire in No. 5 started shortly after
axid then No. 4 stopped with a plugged
I line."
