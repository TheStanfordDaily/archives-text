# YWCA Student Workshop
## 
### 
The Student Workshop scheduled for toinor
row and Saturday is one of the best ideas to hit
the campus in some time.
The purpose of the Workshop is to (juther
together representatives of as many campus
organizations as possible, to discuss each or
ganization's problems, and to look for solutions.
The idea grew out of last year's YWCA Mock
Convention, which brought together members
of various women's groups on campus in a
model of the national YWCA convention.
While the topic of this mock convention was
"campus affairs," the main purpose was simply
to give the Stanford delegates to the national
convention a background in the conduct of
such meetings.
This year the Workshop is being sponsored
by the YWCA in place of a mock convention,
and is both the means to an end and the end
itself . . . the solution of student problems.
To date, over 16 campus organizations have
indicated that they will be represented at the
Workshop. They will offer problems, and help
solve others groups' problems.
Among the organizations reprsented will be
the ASSU Excom, Men's Council, Associated
Women Students, the Chaparral, Quad, NSA,
Student Health Committee, and The Daily.

Subjects for discussion will be divided into
two groups:
First, the student's role in the campus com
munity. Under this heading the problems to
be considered will include: faculty rating, stu
dent concern with health conditions, improve
ment of the advising and counseling system,
and cooperation between various campus
groups.
The groups will also discuss means of sam
pling student opinion on campus-wide matters,
social policies, the Fundamental Standard, and
campus religious activities.
The .second discussion group will deal with
the student's role outside the campus commu
nity, dealing with presentation of student opin
ion to legislative bodies and interested groups
throughout the nation, providing information
and advice to student groups at other univer
sities.
A discussion on the problems of racial preju
dice and segregation will be included.
Most of the topics discussed will be of im
portance to every Stanford student.
If the YWCA Student Workshop offers con
crete suggestions by way of solving only 10
per cent of the problems to be discussed, it
will have contributed much to the Stanford
community generally, and to each student as
an individual.
