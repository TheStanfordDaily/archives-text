# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL DAILEY 
I had planned ihis morning to launch another ono
of those "Choosing Your Major" essay.-. complete with
just oodJes and oodles oi witticisms on the subject of
majoring in Speech and Drama. Instead, I'm going to
postpone that sparkling bit of prose until next week

m favor of a short pitch for a
worthy cause. No, Henrietta, the
Watsonville Home fur Neurotic-
Journalists is not giving another
bridge party. This pitch is for the
Ked Cross.
(All right, boys, we'll have just
one quickie gag before we get
.serious. A girl came up to me on
Quad the other day and I old me 1
was Number One on her Hit Pa
rade. Then she hit me!)

Now that I have gotten that yuk off my little thin
chest, I'm going to devote the rest of this column to
trying to influence you to attend the Faculty-Student
Talent Show tomorrow night at Cubberlcy Audito
rium. If this subject doesn't sound interesting, I sug
gest you turn to the Lost and Found Section and see
if Soph President Bud MeCord bus been found yet.
1 understand he was "lost" a few days ago.
Getting back to the Red Cross show, the tariff for
this performance is $J. 1 think the assembled talent
will be worth the price. Practically all of the kids
who entertain on campus are donating their services,
as are a number of faculty members.
1' rank Wolff, Bill Kenney, George Denny, and Tom
Shipp, all of whom entertained at Yosemite last sum
mer, will cavort through their respective routines.
Also on hand will be Stu "Dad Rango" Hyde to send
out a few choice bits of advice to all his friends "on!
there in radio land."

Roy and Dick Roberts and Art Segil will do a repeat
on their popular Gaieties number, "Lowdown Uptown
Gal," as well as "taking off" several well-known com
positions.
Other student entertainers scheduled to appear for
the benefit include the Chi Psi Quartet, Mort "Balle
rina" White and his renowned "Or-cheesits" dance
group, (they stopped the show at the Junior Show-
Dance last year), the Med School Quartet, guitarist Ap
Eyre, and pianist Lois Croonquist. It is also rumored
that a visiting professor named Dailey will deliver a
short lecture (heh!) on "Choosing Your Major in
College."
The faculty will be represented in the show with
performances by "The Barber Shop Balladiers," the
Women's Gym staff, Mrs. H. Donald Winbigler, Paul
Freeman of the Biology Department, Miss Adele Stro
'gen, Assistant Counselor for Women, and Mr. and Mrs.
Petteys of the English Department.
My favorite clown, Dean Borba, will tie the show
together in his role as master of ceremonies. If you
haven't heard Burba's version of "Mule Train," you
haven't heard a true "production" of the number.
Tickets for the show are selling daily at the ASSU
Office from 9 a.m. to 12 and from 1 to 5 p.m. The per
formance is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. so it will be
over in time to allow students to attend the Frosh-
Soph Jamboree.
What's that? You say you want more? Ail right,
how about this? You've got a chance to win a $250
television set in a drawing which will be held during
the show. You want still more? Okay, your dollar
will go toward filling the Stanford quota in the cur
rent Red Cross drive. 'Nuff said.
Amen for this ayetn!

of those "Choosing Your Major" essay.-. complete with
just oodJes and oodles oi witticisms on the subject of
majoring in Speech and Drama. Instead, I'm going to
postpone that sparkling bit of prose until next week

m favor of a short pitch for a
worthy cause. No, Henrietta, the
Watsonville Home fur Neurotic-
Journalists is not giving another
bridge party. This pitch is for the
Ked Cross.
(All right, boys, we'll have just
one quickie gag before we get
.serious. A girl came up to me on
Quad the other day and I old me 1
was Number One on her Hit Pa
rade. Then she hit me!)

Now that I have gotten that yuk off my little thin
chest, I'm going to devote the rest of this column to
trying to influence you to attend the Faculty-Student
Talent Show tomorrow night at Cubberlcy Audito
rium. If this subject doesn't sound interesting, I sug
gest you turn to the Lost and Found Section and see
if Soph President Bud MeCord bus been found yet.
1 understand he was "lost" a few days ago.
Getting back to the Red Cross show, the tariff for
this performance is $J. 1 think the assembled talent
will be worth the price. Practically all of the kids
who entertain on campus are donating their services,
as are a number of faculty members.
1' rank Wolff, Bill Kenney, George Denny, and Tom
Shipp, all of whom entertained at Yosemite last sum
mer, will cavort through their respective routines.
Also on hand will be Stu "Dad Rango" Hyde to send
out a few choice bits of advice to all his friends "on!
there in radio land."

Roy and Dick Roberts and Art Segil will do a repeat
on their popular Gaieties number, "Lowdown Uptown
Gal," as well as "taking off" several well-known com
positions.
Other student entertainers scheduled to appear for
the benefit include the Chi Psi Quartet, Mort "Balle
rina" White and his renowned "Or-cheesits" dance
group, (they stopped the show at the Junior Show-
Dance last year), the Med School Quartet, guitarist Ap
Eyre, and pianist Lois Croonquist. It is also rumored
that a visiting professor named Dailey will deliver a
short lecture (heh!) on "Choosing Your Major in
College."
The faculty will be represented in the show with
performances by "The Barber Shop Balladiers," the
Women's Gym staff, Mrs. H. Donald Winbigler, Paul
Freeman of the Biology Department, Miss Adele Stro
'gen, Assistant Counselor for Women, and Mr. and Mrs.
Petteys of the English Department.
My favorite clown, Dean Borba, will tie the show
together in his role as master of ceremonies. If you
haven't heard Burba's version of "Mule Train," you
haven't heard a true "production" of the number.
Tickets for the show are selling daily at the ASSU
Office from 9 a.m. to 12 and from 1 to 5 p.m. The per
formance is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. so it will be
over in time to allow students to attend the Frosh-
Soph Jamboree.
What's that? You say you want more? Ail right,
how about this? You've got a chance to win a $250
television set in a drawing which will be held during
the show. You want still more? Okay, your dollar
will go toward filling the Stanford quota in the cur
rent Red Cross drive. 'Nuff said.
Amen for this ayetn!
