# Acheson on Red Pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State Achcson said today the Chi
nese Communists made a poor and
dangerous deal with Russia in their
new 30-ycar "friendship" treaty of
alliance.
Achcson termed it almost a boiler
plate copy of the pacts Russia has
made with the Soviet satellites in
Eastern Europe.
The accompanying agreement in
which Moscow reportedly promised
$300,000,000 in economic aid to
China over the next five years is
only the beginning of trouble for the
Chinese, Achcson declared.
The cabinet member told a news
conference that for a nation re
ported to be on the verge of famine
and facing tremendous
difficulties, $300,000,000 is very mea
ger assistance.
