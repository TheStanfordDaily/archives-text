# Care of Hooks Urged by Libe
## 
### 
Elmer M. Greider, assistant direc
tor of libraries, has placed on dis
play the mutilated periodicals and
books found in the Library recently.
Mutilation of materials i.s a peren
nial danger to libraries. Books and
magazines of research value are most
often mistreated.
Access to them is slowed down
when they have to be repaired. In
a few places it has forced the re
imposition of strong library regula
tions which make checking out ol
books very difficult.
Al Stanford the mutilation of li
brary property is a violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Section 6211 of the California Penal
Code is quoted in the Trustees'
Manual of Stanford University:
"Every person who maliciously
cuts, tears, defaces, breaks, or in
jures any book, map chart, picture,
engraving, statue, coin, model, ap
paratus, or other work of literature,
art, mechanics, or object of curiosity,
deposited in any public library, gal
lery, museum collection, fair, or ex
hibition, is guilty of a misdemeanor."
