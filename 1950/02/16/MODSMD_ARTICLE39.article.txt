### DICK KLEIN 
HIE DEMIRJIAN STOKY: The
biggest happening in the collegiate
ranks down south was the heated
.squabble over Ed Demirjian, the
(lashy T-quarterback of last sea
son's Muir College eleven. It seems
that floundering Ed has enrolled at
USC after, supposedly being in the
Stanford, Cul, Westwood, and Tro
jan fold in that order.
Originally, Demirjian had plans of
joining fellow Shish-kabobers Ker
korian, Ilugasian, and Manoogian
under the Card banner. But after a
couple of between - semester ma-
Big Ed ends up else
where. Included in his most recent
search for higher learning, The
Demirj spent one day last week reg
istering at UCLA, but lacked his
transcript to close the deal. He
ended up spending the night at a
Westwood fraternity.
But the next day, under persistent
guiding of several Trojan first
stringers and prominent alums, he
managed to enroll at Tramway
Tech. This was a big shock to Coach
Sanders and Bruin faculty officials.
To complicate the deal, Ed attended
his first Trojan class Friday, which
according to PCC rules is the only
official way of signifying registra
tion. So, unless the flashy signal
caller wants to lose a valuable year
of eligibility, he will remain an SC
fixture.
The matter was amusingly con
cluded in the LA press with a great
cartoon. Shows Coaches Cravath
and Sanders fishing in a big pond of
grid talent. Big fish Demirjian was
hooked on the end of Jeff's line,
while the game warden, in the per
sonage of NCAA Head Willett (also
a Troy-boy), has his back turned.
Meanwhile, Ed's case against the
Western States Conference was still
in progress. Seems that Ed led Muir
to the loop grid title, but had forgot
ten about living, in Pasadena. The
Confo ruled him ineligible after the
season for living out of the district,
and gave the title to runner-up
Compton. Now Ed sues. All in all.
it adds up to a great legal tangle for
a gridder who aspires to the law
profession.
COLLECTED NOTES FROM A
SOUTHLAND WEEKEND: As far
as other football nuggets go, SC and
UCLA did about even up, with the
Trojan maybe getting the advantage
on big name talent. SC gets All-
CIF quarter Landon Exlev. former
mate of Dick Horn at Santa Monica;
Joe Mancuso, All-City of LA full
back; and two of Demirjian's fel
low all-conference backs, A 1 "Hoa
i*?y Carmiehel of Santa Ana and
Cosimo Curti from San Diego. UC
LA managed to grab off Bob Zelin
ka, all-conference guard from San
ta Ana JC; Bob Fisher, guard from
LA City College; ancj George Bran
cato, Santa Ana halfback.
Sp:»rts Editor George T. Davis of
the Herald wrote about his Davis
poll (a la Gallup). The whole thipg
proved that Bill Sharman is the
greatest thing on a conference court,
should be Ail-American, and the
usual LA press fanfare. In another
column, Davis compared the Demir
jian fight to a similar one a few
years back. It was between Cal and
Stanford over a Santa Rosa high
school product. His name was Ernie
Nevers.
Howard Bugbce, former Stanford
frosh ace, also attended his first
USC class on Friday. The sprinter
will have to sit out this track sea
son, but should be ready for PCC
competition in '51.
Thursday night the SC tracksters
had their annual banquet. Bob
Chambers and Henry Aihara were
elected co-captains for the coming
season. Other awards: .Mel Patton—
the Richardson high point trophy,
Patton and Jess Swope — Paddock
most improved, and Draper award
for most inspirational to Chambers.
According to Coach Jess Hill noth
ing could possibly stop SC from
another rational title, as the Tro
jans were loaded in every event but
the 440.

Thursday night the SC tracksters
had their annual banquet. Bob
Chambers and Henry Aihara were
elected co-captains for the coming
season. Other awards: .Mel Patton—
the Richardson high point trophy,
Patton and Jess Swope — Paddock
most improved, and Draper award
for most inspirational to Chambers.
According to Coach Jess Hill noth
ing could possibly stop SC from
another rational title, as the Tro
jans were loaded in every event but
the 440.
HIE DEMIRJIAN STOKY: The
biggest happening in the collegiate
ranks down south was the heated
.squabble over Ed Demirjian, the
(lashy T-quarterback of last sea
son's Muir College eleven. It seems
that floundering Ed has enrolled at
USC after, supposedly being in the
Stanford, Cul, Westwood, and Tro
jan fold in that order.
Originally, Demirjian had plans of
joining fellow Shish-kabobers Ker
korian, Ilugasian, and Manoogian
under the Card banner. But after a
couple of between - semester ma-
Big Ed ends up else
where. Included in his most recent
search for higher learning, The
Demirj spent one day last week reg
istering at UCLA, but lacked his
transcript to close the deal. He
ended up spending the night at a
Westwood fraternity.
But the next day, under persistent
guiding of several Trojan first
stringers and prominent alums, he
managed to enroll at Tramway
Tech. This was a big shock to Coach
Sanders and Bruin faculty officials.
To complicate the deal, Ed attended
his first Trojan class Friday, which
according to PCC rules is the only
official way of signifying registra
tion. So, unless the flashy signal
caller wants to lose a valuable year
of eligibility, he will remain an SC
fixture.
The matter was amusingly con
cluded in the LA press with a great
cartoon. Shows Coaches Cravath
and Sanders fishing in a big pond of
grid talent. Big fish Demirjian was
hooked on the end of Jeff's line,
while the game warden, in the per
sonage of NCAA Head Willett (also
a Troy-boy), has his back turned.
Meanwhile, Ed's case against the
Western States Conference was still
in progress. Seems that Ed led Muir
to the loop grid title, but had forgot
ten about living, in Pasadena. The
Confo ruled him ineligible after the
season for living out of the district,
and gave the title to runner-up
Compton. Now Ed sues. All in all.
it adds up to a great legal tangle for
a gridder who aspires to the law
profession.
COLLECTED NOTES FROM A
SOUTHLAND WEEKEND: As far
as other football nuggets go, SC and
UCLA did about even up, with the
Trojan maybe getting the advantage
on big name talent. SC gets All-
CIF quarter Landon Exlev. former
mate of Dick Horn at Santa Monica;
Joe Mancuso, All-City of LA full
back; and two of Demirjian's fel
low all-conference backs, A 1 "Hoa
i*?y Carmiehel of Santa Ana and
Cosimo Curti from San Diego. UC
LA managed to grab off Bob Zelin
ka, all-conference guard from San
ta Ana JC; Bob Fisher, guard from
LA City College; ancj George Bran
cato, Santa Ana halfback.
Sp:»rts Editor George T. Davis of
the Herald wrote about his Davis
poll (a la Gallup). The whole thipg
proved that Bill Sharman is the
greatest thing on a conference court,
should be Ail-American, and the
usual LA press fanfare. In another
column, Davis compared the Demir
jian fight to a similar one a few
years back. It was between Cal and
Stanford over a Santa Rosa high
school product. His name was Ernie
Nevers.
Howard Bugbce, former Stanford
frosh ace, also attended his first
