# Stanford Cagers Head South Tonight for Weekend Games
## 
### 
Stanford's 12-man cage club, with
a prayer and a handful of good in
tentions, will latch onto the South
ern Pacific Lark at 9:42 tonight and
head back into the dread LA terri
tory to open still another weekend
series with USC and UCLA.
Tomorrow morning ttte Cards will
move into the Chapman Park Hotel,
a home - away - from - home for all
Tribe traveling squads.
Tomorrow night they have a Pan
Pacific engagement with USC, and
Satui'day night it's the Bruin Gym,
a joint which is said to be as jinxed
as a black cat walking under a lad
der on broken mirrors.
To say the least, odds are not
leaning toward Stanford. Sam Bar- !
ry's Trojans have spanked the Cards |
10 straight times, and UCLA has |
warmed its palm five straight times, j
Besides that, John Wooden has |
never lost a game in his home gym
at Westwood, a record which in
cludes 24 consecutive performances.
Everett Dean went back to his
juggling act early this week, with 1
the result that Harry Hugasian will
probably replace Bruce Iversen in
the starting lineup. Dean has also >
worked Bill Warren and Dick Clegg ,
into more prominent roles than ever
before.
One positive move was to junk I
the turtle-break in favor of going
back to the swift. When Stanford i
moved out of its slow break in the
second half against UCLA, the
Cards outscorcd the Bruins by four i
points.
The traveling squad is listed be- j
low:
Forwards — George Yardley, Jim
Walsh, Gay Bryan, Bill Warren, and
Paul Watson.
Centers—Jim Ramstead and Ralph
Carver.
Guards — Gus Chavalas, Dick
Clegg, Harry Hugasian, Bruce Iver
sen, Jack O'Sullivan.
