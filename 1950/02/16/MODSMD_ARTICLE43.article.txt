gridders' September 30 open date, j
caused by Harvard's surprise can- j
cellation of their intersectional con
test originally scheduled for that
test originally scheduled for that
date.
Both Head Coach March ie !
Schwartz and Athletic Director A! ;
Masters reiterated yesterday thai
the Crimson move had come as a t
distinct surprise.
No decision has been reached as
to what will be done with the open
date. Schwartz stated that a game
against a 'suitable" opponent would
be preferable to leaving the date
open. Masters added that the suit
able opponent might be either an
intersectional or a local foe.
