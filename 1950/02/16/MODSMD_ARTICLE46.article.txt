Encina Center trounced Encina
5W 48 to 23 in a mural scramble
last night in the Encina Gym. First
blood was drawn by Dave Builisâ€”
the one-man team for SW. But even
with the height edge, 5W fell apart
when Dempsey of Encina Center
meshed one from 30 feet out.
The Centers developed a smooth
offense that began to roll against
the unorganized sWers. An early
lead was taken by the Centers
through the tricky footwork of ball
hawker Dick Stark. Other Center
men who helped pot a continuous
string of buckets were Art Riedel,
Dempsey, Gerald Van Bergen, and
Ed Henderson.
For SW, Builis was almost totally
responsible for the 11 points they
had amassed at half-time. The half
time score was 5W 11. Center 24.
The second half brought better
ball-handling for the Encina Cen
ters. First Van Bergen sunk one
from the key. Then Reidel drove in
for an unguarded lay-in. The sW's
defense was non - existent when
Builis tired. With seven minutes to
go the contest became a scoring duel
among the Encina Centers, and the
referee called the game.
In other games last night the
Roble Hashers defeated the Five
Old Men 24 to 14, and Encina 4E
beat Encina 3E I 45 to 33.
The last three games at Encina
Gym were postponed because of the
wrestling matches.
