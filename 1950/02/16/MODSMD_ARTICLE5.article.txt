# Say SP Badly Managed
## 
### 
REDWOOD CITY A commuters'
organization today accused the
Southern Pacific Railway of "bad
management."
A spokesman for the Peninsula
Protective Association told Commis
sioner Ira H. Rowell of the State
Public Utilities Commission that the
company's requested rate increase is
unwarranted. The company con
tends it is losing $1,000,000 annually
on die service.
Fred E. Chestnut, a consulting en
gineer retained by the commuters,
testified the company could save
about $500,000 a year by replacing
sleam locomotives with Diesel
powered cars.
