### JOAN SEAVER 
The United Nations may still lead
this country to an answer to the
question of recognizing the Com
munist government in China.
How recognition will affect the
UN machinery and, in turn, the
United States is discussed by David
Chan, newly elected president of the
lIR. in a bulletin published today.
The bulletin, a monthly publication
of the UN Education Center, pre
sents, primarily to California high
school students, world affairs in the
international organizatoin.
Chan's article emphasized these
possibilities:
It could happen that the Commu
nist government of China will be
sitting in the meetings of the UN
without being recognized by the
majority of the member states; the
two governments of China might be
represented in the UN simultane
ously and legally consistent with
the rules of the UN.
We, without recognizing the Com
munist government, may be work
ing with their delegates in the UN.
The indication lies in a statement
made recently by Philip Jessup,
U.S. roving ambassador, implying
that if the majority in the main
chamber of the UN voted to unseat
the Chinese Nationalist delegates,
we would go along with them.
The independent decision of the
UN — if left independent — might
well influence the American stand
in Chinese recognition, the article
suggests. The UN may also allay
diplomatic embarrassment when our
policy is decided and again prove
itself a sourcp of solutions to inter
national problems.
