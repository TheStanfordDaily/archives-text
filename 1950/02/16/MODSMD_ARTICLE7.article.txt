# Excom Unanimously Votes For Opening of Lake Lag
## 
### 
Excom last night unanimously approved the opening of Lake
Lagunita for the season Sunday, weather permitting.
Life guards will be on duty to supervise swimming and boating
on the lake. A list of lake regulations will be published in tomor
row's Daily.
Life Guard Don Baruch appeared before Excom to request that

students use precaution in smoking 4
because of the fire danger.
A proposal to prohibit all extracur
ricular functions during dead week
failed to get by the Executive Com
i mittee on two occasions. All other
proposed social procedure changes
1 were approved.
Under the new provision, Excom
may grant closed 12 o'clock dates to
organizations on Sunday night. The
provisions also require patron lists to
be filed by living groups within the
first two weeks of autumn quarter
i and by classes at least 10 days before
a class function.
The dead week social amendment
was tabled after it failed to pass, 6 to
5, on the first vote and 8 to 3 on the
second. Eleven affirmative votes are
required for by-laws to pass.
Four new by-law sections involv
ing the regulation of polling places
were approved unanimously. Plans
for the number, location, and hours
| of polling booths must now be sub-
I mittcd to Excom for approval and
j published in The Daily the day pre
ceding the day of the election.
Election Board is made responsible
for the maintenance of the booths.
Excom may invalidate an election
and call for a new one if it deter
mines that violation of these by-laws
prejudiced the voters sufficiently to
warrant a new election.
By its move, Excom attempted to
: correct the vague election by-laws
which led to an election day mixup
during the recent Men's and Wom
| en's Council voting.
A second by-law amendment
! passed will allow election printed
matter to be posted in living groups.
Living groups may make their own
regulations governing posting and
will be responsible for enforcing
j them.
