### JULIE DOCKSTADER 
i More than 100 screech'ng sopho
more girls were thwarted in an at
tempt to raid Roble Hall last night
at 9:30.
Stopped by locked doors and win
dows, the sophs surrounded the
dormitory and scrambled up the
sundeck wall. Bombed from see
ond- and third-story windows by
water-filled wastebaskets, the sophs
hurled taunts of "Squash the frosh"
over the din of exploding firecrack
ers.
i II all started when spirited fresh
men short-sheeted their sophomore
I sisters at Branner Hail. In retalia
tion, sophomores planned a mass
meeting at Lagunita courtyard.
: Their purpose v/as allegedly "to an
' noy, not to destroy," an 1 sopho
more girls from all over campus set
out with cold cream, lipstick, and
live frogs.
The levi-t lad ciow I waylaid re
turning Robleites, painting "The
hell with '53" in lipstick on cheeks
and foreheads. Inside, the freshmen
filled paper bags and wastebaskets
with water and showered every at-
tacker who came within range.
Several sophomores forced their
way into a front window at 10 p.m.
and let live frogs loose in Roble
lobby. The s«'phs were held as host
ages in Miss Keane's office until the
fight was ended.
When a kidnap attempt on former
Roble Club president Dodie Fitzer
failed, she was captured and held on
the steps by irate sophs for an hour.
Wlun released, her comment to the
defending frosh was, "Hey, you
jokers, knock it off."
The attack was a step in the
mounting spirit of the Frosh-Soph
Jamboree planned for this weekend.
Sophs stated it was an attempt to
demonstrate that they are "really
out for blood and intend to win the
forthcoming contests."
