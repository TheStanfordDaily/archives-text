# Dead Week Parties
## 
### 
Last fall Excom passed d by-law amendment
providing that "there shall he no social Junc
tions, except for small closed parties over at
10 p.m., during a period ol six day; immed
iately preceding the end quarter examina
tions."
Ti*e by law had previously held that social
functions of any kind were prohibited daring
that period.
When Excom changed this ruling we pointed
out that it might well jeopardize the "sanctity"
of dead week.
Dead week has been a time for preparing for
finale. Student activities have been suspended,
in return, and not because of any rule, but
rather by custom, we have not had dead week
quizzes and exams to worry about.
The problem came before Excom again
Wednesday night.
ASSU Vice-president jan O'Brien submitted
a list ol by-laws on social procedure lor the
approval of Excom. Among them was a by
law amendment to allow no social functions of
ciny kind during dead week.
The discussion pro and con was lengthy.
A by-law must be passed by 11 ol Ex corn's
15 voting members. Only II members were

present Wednesday night. The by law was
deleated on two ballots, lacking five votes on
the first and three on the second. Alter further
discussion it was tabled for additional consid
eration.
We believe this by-law should be passed.
Many professors have indicated that they
would like to be able to give quizzes during
dead week, but as long as the students have
not held oigamzed social functions during that
time, the dead week tradition has been main
tained.
Pait of a letter from Dean Kimpton illustrates
the Administration's viewpoint:
"We in this office have consistently fought
various faculty and administrative groups to
prevent uny encroachment on the dead week
period ... 1 greatly fear that the action of
Excom will open the matter up and the faculty
will claim that il social affairs can be held, then
certain academic aflairs can be held, too."
This was written after Excom's action last 'fall.
It still applies.
We feel that to allow any organized social
functions during dead week would provide, in
many cases, ample excuse for dead week
quizzes.
