# Red Cross Divisions Give Aid In National Disaster Areas
## 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The Red Cross, the principal refuge
and first aid station of the American j
people, gave help in more disasters |
last year than in any year since its j
founding. Disasters totaled 330.
Throughout the nation, disaster I
area divisions, such as the Palo Alto- J
Mountain View-Los Altos one head
ed by A 1 Masters, Stanford's director
of athletics, went into action as floods,
storms, and fire struck without warn
ing.
Remember in 1949?
In the Plains States blizzards '
stranded trains and snowed towns
into isolation. More than 3,500 mis
sions of the airlift dropped food,
medical supplies, clothing, and fuel.
Seventeen expectant mothers were |
flown to hospitals.
In Utah. Arizona, and New Mexico
the Navajo and Hopi Indians were
unable to cope with the hard winter j
The Red Cross assisted until national
aid was made available.
In Oklahoma people literally took '
to the treetops as flood waters j
rushed in. The Red Cross sent in
boats with loudspeakers and search
lights. While the searchlights played
through the trees to aid rescue work
ers, words of encouragement came
from the loudspeaker to calm victims.
And nearer home:
In Salinas fire destroyed a barracks i
building occupied by five families.
The chapter supplied emergency
food, clothing, and household sup- j
plies.
In San Mateo County a fire in the !
Coyote Point Housing project left 12 j
families homeless and destroyed five ]
buildings.
In Ontario a bus-train wreck killed
16 and injured six. Chapter first aid
workers were at the scene, and can
teen service was provided with other
services to families of civilians killed
and injured.
The Red Cross spent 6V2 million
dollars, about 15 per cent of its budget !
in disaster work last year. Techni
cally, a disaster is any catastrophe j
involving five families.
Immediate disaster aid is an out- |
right gift, but 70 cents out of each !
disaster dollar went toward long- j

I range rehabilitation. The latter goes
toward replenishing livestock on
j farms, equipping small businesses,
! and helping re-establish means of
I livelihood.
In the event of a major disaster
I here, Stanford people would take a
! prominent part in mobilizing relief
forces. Masters has as his assistants
Alf Brandin. business manager, and
Mrs. Luella Weed Guthrie, women's
physical education instructor.
Members of Sigma Delta Chi and
j Theta Sigma Phi, men's and women's
I honorary journalism fraternities are
on the list of volunteers available to
assist the public information chair
man in time of disaster. Many Stan
ford faculty and staff members serve

on relief committees.
The local disaster committee keeps
> up-to-date lists and plans for hun
dreds of volunteers, emergency food,
clothing, and shelter should disaster
come in the area.
Beeau.se of 3,700 Red Cross chapters
which cover the United States, per
sonal inquiries about relatives in dis
aster areas can be secured almost
anywhere.
