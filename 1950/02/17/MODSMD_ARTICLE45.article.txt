# Castagnoli Hero as Cards Edge Brown Rookies, 6-5
## Baseballers Play Oakland Semi-Pros On Sunken Diamond Tomorrow 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Stanford varsity baseball team made a story-book finish out
of its first game yesterday afternoon, as pinch-hitter Jim Castagnoli
slammed a two-out, bases-loaded triple in the last half of the ninth
1 to give the Cards a 6 to 5 victory over the visiting St. Louis Browns
Rookies.
Things looked pretty black for those home nine as they went

J ill to the final stanza, behind two runs,
j Dave Melton grounded out, John
Clay pool followed suit, and the Stan
| lord ease appeared hopeless.
Then, with two out and victory ap
| parently within their grasp, the
i Rookies fell apart. Bud Klein, the
converted first-sacker, got a life on
I an error, Bruce Cameron worked a
base on balls, and both runners ad
i vanccd as Dick Corzine was waved
lo first after his bat collided with
the catcher's
"Casey" Steps Up
Then, with the sacks bulging and
(wo down, mighty "Casey" Castagnoli
.stepped to the plate in place of pitcher
I Frank Hamilton. The count worked
| to three and one, and then Cas teed
off on a fast one.
The ball traveled .'l5O feet on the lly
to the bottom of the bank in left cen
ter field, and fell between the left
| and center fielders. Three Stanford
j runs poured across, Castagnoli
wound up on third, and the ball
I game was over.
Tomorrow afternoon the Indians
take on a one for their second
! opponent in the E. Bercovich and
; Sons team—a red hot semi-pro out
! fit from Oakland. The game will be
played on the Sunken Diamond, and
| the first pitch will be served up
promptly at 3:15.
Albright To Flay
The Bercovichs count a number of
i professional stars in their lineup, and
| are presently burning up the Ala
meda winter league over in Oakland.
Not the least of these is Jackie Al
bright, regular third baseman for the
: Seattle Rainiers, and Oak rookies
Don Fracchia and Lil Arnerich.
The Indians will have a return
match with the Brown Rookies next
\ Tuesday, and have scheduled a game
with the Mofl'att Mantecas, perpetual
semi-pro kings in this area, for next
; Saturday. By playing such top flight
; competition right off the bat, Coach
Everett Dean hopes to get a jump on
the other CIBA teams and have his
squad conditioned by the time the
league season opens during spring
! vacation.
Improvement Needed
The Cards looked like they could
i use a lot of work yesterday as they
' stumbled around and all but blew

their first game.
The varsity was generally slow of
loot and weak at bat, and the pitch
ing will have to pick up a lot before
Stanford can be regarded as real
pennant contenders.
Dave Stott worked well for a
couple of innings, but tirqd badly in
the middle innings and walked home
one of the runs that almost beat the
Cards. Sophomore Frank
bones" Hamilton took over in the
sixth and pitched four scoreless in
nings. He struck out five and was
seldom in trouble. He was a little on
the wild side, but nevertheless
showed exceptional promise.
In the field, Jim Mason turned in
a first-rate performance around
third base, and rightfielder John
Claypool hit two for three.
The Braves will play a game with
San Mateo JC on the Sunken Dia
mond tomorrow morning at 10.

The Cards looked like they could

their first game.
The varsity was generally slow of

Stanford can be regarded as real
pennant contenders.
Dave Stott worked well for a
couple of innings, but tirqd badly in
the middle innings and walked home
one of the runs that almost beat the
Cards. Sophomore Frank

sixth and pitched four scoreless in

seldom in trouble. He was a little on
the wild side, but nevertheless
showed exceptional promise.
In the field, Jim Mason turned in
