# Luisetti or Sharman? – – Todays Cage Quiz
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Has Bullseye Bill Sharman. the
sensational USC eager, finally
earned himself the right to be men
tioned in he same breath with
Stanford's all-time great, Hank Lui
setti?
That's the question which has
been bothering Pacific Coast bas
ketball fans since the season first
started. j
After Sharman came north last i
weekend and neatly deposited 48 :
points in two nights against the likes ;
of California and Stanford, his
boosters have come to life with re
newed vigor. And it must be ad
mitted that there is very good rea
son for it.
Scoring Record
Billy the Kid is hot on the trail
of Hank Luisetti's 12 - year - old
Southern Division scoring record.
In fact, the pace set by the fabulous
Luisetti back in 1938 is currently
being batted to pieces by the Figue
<oa Street phantom.
Luisetti backers are quick to
point out that scoring alone is not a
good enough foundation to make a
comparison. "Luisetti," they say,
"could do everything with a basket
ball. Pass. Rebound. Dribble. Shoot.
And he could do them all better
than anybody else."
They add that it is not fair to
compare the Trojan to Luisetti, that
it would be better to label him the
first Sharman.
But, one glance at the record
book and at Sharman in action will
be enough to cause observers to
start the inevitable comparison.
King of Casaba
To be mentioned in the same sen
tence with Luisetti might be honor
enough for the average athlete. An
gelo Hank is a basketball trade
mark. Recently, the Associated
Press named him the second great
est player of the half-century be
hind George Mikan, and those who
have seen both play say that Hank
could have run the giant dizzy.
So, it is hard to accept the fact
that here in Luisetti's own Califor
nia backyard a new threat to his
throne has arisen.
In scoring alone, it seems almost
a certainty that Sharman will sur-,
pass Luisetti's 238-point standard.
Bullseye Bill's latest weekend effort
shot his season total to 138 for 6
games. That's 7 points ahead of
Hank's blistering halfway rate, and
with the second half-dozen games to
go, Sharman has all the best of it.
LuLsetti went downhill, not much
but down, in his final six. His 7th
game was his worst, just 7 points
against USC, which was the only
time he was held under double
digits during his entire 12-game
record run.
Sharman has already been held to
8 in an under - ten breakdown
against California in his second
otuing. But he has more than made
up for it with two brilliant 31- and
32-point showings against Stanford
and UCLA. The most Luisetti ever
hit in a single loop clash was 30.
Sharman's two times over that mark
gives him an only in that depart- i
merit, although he is still short of |
the 36-point spree put on by an

other USC Hipper, Ralph Vaughn,
in 1939.
All Sharman has to do is main
tain his present sparkling average
of 23 points per game. Luisetti av
eraged 17. G for the record.
For those who prefer their own
statistics, the following is a year-to
year comparison of the scoring
progress of the two.

It can be seen that Luisetti started
much faster than Sharman, as he
dumped in GO more points during
his sophomore year, led the league
in scoring, and sparked his team to
a Pacific Coast championship.
Sharman was only eighth in scor
ing in his soph year, and his team
finished only second in the South
ern Division. Hank had him beat
again on that account, as in his
three varsity years he led Stanford
to three consecutive Pacific Coast
championships. The best Sharman
has managed is runners-up spot in
the Southern Division.
Sharman began to pick up on
Luisetti during his junior year. Be
coming the second man to ever
score over 200 in a single season,
Bill be?*an to capitalize on his great
free-shot ability as well as his goals
from the floor, and roared to within
5 points of Luisetti.
The free-throwing edge must go
to Sharman, as he has become one
of the finest charity-toss perfection
ists in the game. His 18 straight
early this season gave him a new
Southern Division record.
At His Best
Now, with an amazing variety of

shots from the floor, a systematic
i assortment of fakes, and a cham
! pion's coolness under fire, Sharman
is on his way to shattering Luisetti's
greatest achievement.
With six games remaining, he has
already moved into the third spot
behind Luisetti and Ralph Vaughn
in Southern Division totals for three
years of piay. Having 453 to his
credit, he will undoubtedly move
by Vaughn's 492 and become the
second man in league history to col
lect 500 in a single season.
However, Hank still has a strangle
hold on the three-year record with
I! 12 for 30 games for an even 17 per

game. Sharman can't mulch that.
Nor could he create the excitement
Luisetti did on his tours through the
East with his 51-point splash against
Duquesne, and his completely revo
lutionary (then) style of play.
Atomic Times
It is unfortunate that Sharman
comes along in a day of A-bombs
and H-bombs which make his own

personal explosions seem quiet and
calm in comparison to the Hankus-
Pankus who starred in an era when
something great was referred to as
dynamite rather than atomic.
But Sharman's feats cannot be
overlooked. He is one of the most
remarkable scorers the Pacific Coast
has produced, a fine team-man, and
a great all-around ball-player.
Certainly, he deserves the right to
be compared with Luisetti. Hut
when you get done, just remember
there's only one Hank. Take a look
at the records.
