# Varsity Tangles in South
## Bruin Tip-off In Westwood, Trojans Next 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's cellar-stuck cagers, re- j
fusing to take live straight no's lor
an answer, will cross their lingers
and try all over again tonight
against the explosive UCLA Bru
ins in the Westwood Motbox. To
morrow night it'll be USC at the
Pan Pacific.
Chances lor victory seem to be
about as bright as a dark alley on
: a moonless night. UCLA's swilt
arid swarming Bruins are rated by
the Associated Press as the 10th
best team in the nation, they have
run up 17 wins against only 4 losses,
i and are currently sitting on top of
the Southern Division heap with a
one-game bulge over USC.
Bruin Crueller box
Besides that, there is that little
fatcor of playing in the Bruins' j
home barn. Coach John Wooden j
, has never dropped a game in the I
Westwood Gym, a record which has j
j enabled his boys to run together 21 '
consecutive home victories.
Nevertheless, Everett Dean has
promised faithfully that his men
| will show in spite of the two pre
vious wharkings, 71-55 and <>5-55.
which UCLA has already adminis
-1 tered to the Tribe this season.
On lie Air
! For the never-say-die fans, Oak
| land's KLX. with Fred Hi >ss!er cov
! ering the play, will air tonight's
i game starting at 8:30.
Alter spending most of the week
inserting one Brave after another
i into the starting lineup, Dean will
! probably end up with the same
quintet which opened last week
i against the Bruins.
Possibly one exception will occur
; if the present plan to replace Blond
| Bruce Iverson with Harry Hu.ua-
I sian is carried out. Otherwise, it'll
be George Yardley and Jim Walsh
I at the usual forwards, Ralph Carver
in the slot, and Jack O'Sullivan on
the back-line.
Tomorrow night the Indians will
move over to the Pan Pacific to
j beef it up with the Trojans for the
j third time this season, the previous
j two ending 711-58 and 59-45, packed
! neatly in Troy's overcrowded In
; dian-skin suitcase.
UCLA and USC will lloor the
! same starting clubs they did last
weekend. California's Golden Bears
I will also be down south to play the
i Los Angeles representatives, only in
i reverse order.

Stanford's cellar-stuck cagers, re- j
fusing to take live straight no's lor
an answer, will cross their lingers
and try all over again tonight
against the explosive UCLA Bru
ins in the Westwood Motbox. To
morrow night it'll be USC at the
Pan Pacific.
Chances lor victory seem to be
about as bright as a dark alley on
: a moonless night. UCLA's swilt
arid swarming Bruins are rated by
the Associated Press as the 10th
best team in the nation, they have
run up 17 wins against only 4 losses,
i and are currently sitting on top of
the Southern Division heap with a
one-game bulge over USC.
Bruin Crueller box
Besides that, there is that little
fatcor of playing in the Bruins' j
home barn. Coach John Wooden j
, has never dropped a game in the I
Westwood Gym, a record which has j
j enabled his boys to run together 21 '
consecutive home victories.
Nevertheless, Everett Dean has
promised faithfully that his men
| will show in spite of the two pre
vious wharkings, 71-55 and <>5-55.
which UCLA has already adminis
-1 tered to the Tribe this season.
On lie Air
! For the never-say-die fans, Oak
| land's KLX. with Fred Hi >ss!er cov
! ering the play, will air tonight's
i game starting at 8:30.
Alter spending most of the week
inserting one Brave after another
i into the starting lineup, Dean will
! probably end up with the same
quintet which opened last week
i against the Bruins.
Possibly one exception will occur
; if the present plan to replace Blond
| Bruce Iverson with Harry Hu.ua-
I sian is carried out. Otherwise, it'll
be George Yardley and Jim Walsh
I at the usual forwards, Ralph Carver
in the slot, and Jack O'Sullivan on
the back-line.
Tomorrow night the Indians will
move over to the Pan Pacific to
j beef it up with the Trojans for the
j third time this season, the previous
j two ending 711-58 and 59-45, packed
