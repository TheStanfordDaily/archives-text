HARRY HUGASIAN, sophomore athletic phenomenon, is slated
to start at one of the guard spots against UCLA tonight. This
will be Harry's second starting assignment; he opened against
the Olympic Club in the first game of the season. Noted for his
hustling, ball-hawking style of play, he has scored 40 points in
17 games for an average of 2.4 points per game. Hugasian is
starting in place of blond Bruce Iverson, who has hit a slump
in the scoring department.
