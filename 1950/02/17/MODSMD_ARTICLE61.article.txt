The Daily that you read each
morning is the end result of the
pounding of typewriters, the measur
ing of the niglil. editor's ruler, the I
counting of headlines, and the read
in# of proof that went on in Tin j
Daily Shack the night before.
Besides serving the function of
the campus newspaper in giving nt ws
of school events, airing student opin- i
ions, and keeping the student body j
informed on the latest world news, I
The Daily is the means by which its
staff of students can obtain firsthand j
experience in putting out a daily j
newspaper.
No previous newspaper experience
is needed to become a member of the
staff, which n >w totals 100 workers;
nor is it necessary to be a journal
ism major.
University credit of an average of 1
two units per quarter is given, bow- I
ever, for the positions of night edi- j
tors up to editor. A non-Journalism
major can obtain a total of six units
for which he is not graded, while
majors receive grades lor as many
units ;'s they wish to carry.
At the beginning of fall quarter, a
tryout period is held for all new- |
comers to the staff, in which students
are oriented to the workings of The
Daily. They are assigned the posi- j
tions of cub reporter or reporter,
which entails working on the copy
desk for a minimum of three hours
a week and covering their beats, j

signed a campus activity to cover.) <
Promotions come quickly, depend
ing on how much work you do. and j
the next stop is a copyreader. Copy- i
readers spend four hours a week on j
desk, reading proof, and writing
headlines along with the other re
porters.
Across from the copy desk is the

wire editor's desk, he or she un
ravels the long sheets of AP news
Irom the teletype machine and picks
out the important news for "This
Morning's Headlines" column. Wire
editors work from iour in the after
noon until 10:30 p.m.
The two people who manage the
activity at the copy desk are die
Head Copy Editor and the Night Edi
!or. The HCE is responsible for cor
recting all th<' stories and chocking
ill the headlines that go into the
paper that night.
The NE plans the paper (drafts
the dummy), seeing that all the
stories lit and that there are a va
riety of headlines. The NE and HCE
come at 3 p.m. and leave when the
paper has gone to press, sometime
about midnight.
On the other side of the Shack un
der a photograph gallery of athletic
personalities, is the sports staff. Their
job is to fill up page three with the
forthcoming and outgoing events in
sports.
At the beginning of every volume
two students are appointed as asso
ciate editors. They arc in training
or a quarter and a half for the edi
torship, and one of them is elected
the new editor for the next volume.
They lend a helping hand wherever
it is needed and. as members of
editorial board, which includes the
managing editor, staff editor, and
editor-in-chief, write editorials.
The Managing Editor posts the
issi'nment of stories every morning,
o that the staff can turn in the ma
teria! sometime in the afternoon.
The editor has the 24-hour job of
seeing that the paper carries out its
policy. He "marks up" the paper
every day, pointing out the errors
that have been made and gives praise
where it is due. A new editor is
,'lccted by the members of the staff
n the middle of winter quarter and
it the end of spring quarter.
Every member of the staff has a
full-time job, but The Daily pro
vide:-; more than >vork and newspaper
xperience. Besides the fun that goes
into putting out every edition, the
staff has frequent get-togethers at
Daily Banquets, held at the end of
:ach volume, and beach parties,
which arc held spring quarter.
