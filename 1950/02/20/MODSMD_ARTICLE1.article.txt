## Coal Strike Plans 
### 
WASHINGTON, .Feb. 1!) (/I')
With every sign pointing to a con
tinuing coal strike, the administra
tion today laid plans for court con
tempt action against the miners'
union.
Officials waited to see what hap
pened in the fields tomorrow. But
they conceded hopes are dim that
enough of the strikers who quit last
Monday would get back on the job
to avoid court enforcement of a fed
eral court's week-old order against
the strike.
The main question seemed to he
when the Justice Department will
act. If the miners stay out tomor
row, government attorneys may
seek contempt action right away
or they could wait until Tuesday,
just to make sure the strike is still
on.
