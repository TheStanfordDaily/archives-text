### 
Winner of the final round of Moot
Court competition Thursday evening
was Clifford L. Duke Jr., a third-year
law sludent from Palo Alto.
Judges for the mock appellate
court, hearing were Jesse W. Carter,
an associate justice of the Supreme
Court of California; Raymond E. Pe
ters, judge of the State Court of Ap
peals, First District; and Walter L.
Pope, a judge of the United States
Court, of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.

prize of $100 and Lewis was awarded
$50.

Municipal Ordinance
The problem argued was the con
stitutionality of an imaginary munici
pal ordinance requiring a permit of
persons wishing to use a sound truck
on the streets of the city. Two cases
on sound trucks have been settled
previously by the United State Su
preme Court.
Saia v. New York, in which a simi
lar ordinance was held illegal as a
previous restraint on freedom of
spccch. Here, the issuance of the per
mit was at the unfettered discretion
of the chief of police.
Kovacs v. Cooper, in which a
sound truck ordinance was upheld by
the high court, because the use of
"loud and raucous" loudspeakers on
a public streets was expressly for
bidden lo everyone with no discre
tion vested in an official.
The case debated before Moot
Court involved a hypothetical ordi
nance in which a permit was re
quired, but in which the ordinance
set, up definite limits to the issuing
officials' discretion.
Argument a'ion Judged
Since the guest judges sil on state
and federal courts, they did not, de
cide this case on its merits. The
awards were therefore made on the
basis of the participants' perform
ance in handling argumentation.
Duke and Lennihan, as attorneys
for the respondent, defended the
constitutionality of the ordinance.
Lewis and Scoyen argued for the ap
pellant, attacking the legality of Un
law.
Prize money was contributed by
the Stanford Law Society of Northern
California.
About 400 persons attended the
hearing, held in the Moot, Court,
room in the newly-completed Law
School Building.
