# WORKSHOP
## Delegates Recommend Club Forum 
### 
An inter-club forum, transfer of
social program duties to Cardinals,
a limit to one type of all-campus
drive per quarter, and the formation
of a Fundamental Standard Com
mittee were among the most im
portant recommendations formu
lated by he YWCA's Student Work
shop at the Women's Clubhouse last
Friday and Saturday,
All of these proposals are only
recommendations which will be
sent to the appropriate group to look
into. They were discussed by mem
bers of six discussion groups Satur
day morning and were voted on
that afternoon in a three-hour plen
ary session.
Inter-Club Forum
One of the main proposals was to
organize a permanent inter-club fo
rum with representatives from each
organization on campus. The pur
poses of this forum would be to in
sure co-operation of clubs, co-ordi
nate groups that have common pur
poses, and provide necessary serv
ices for all clubs.
The idea that Cardinals should be
the means through which social or
ganizations will fit their functions
within the general framework was
also recommended by Workshop
members after much discussion.
Ideas for Cardinals
There were two opinions: first,
that Cardinals did not have the con
stitutional right to do this; and sec
ond, that Cardinals should get that
right by changing the constitution if
necessary. The group decided to
recommend that this be looked into
by Cardinals and eventually Ex
com.
The Student Workshop recom
mended that, if Cardinals should
receive control of the social pro
gram, the program for the entire
year should be formulated the pre
ceding spring quarter, and that the
Activities Reviewing Committee
should be placed under the jurisdic
tion of Cardinals. This committee
would work for freshman integra
tion into activities, activity cards in
reg books, and a social calendar in
the Cellar.
Relief Drives
Another proposal recommended
by the Student Workshop was that
there be only three relief drives per
school year, and only one type of
drive per quarter. Thus there would
be a relief drive in fall quarter in
cluding foreign relief and the Stan
ford Floating Fund, from which the
ASSU donates to minor relief or
ganizations.
The winter quarter drive would
be for charity and would include
donations for the Red Cross, can
cer, polio, tuberculosis, and Palo
Alto relief. The Convalescent Home
Drive would be the only one held
spring quarter. All of these drives
would be undertaken by Cardinals.
Formation of a Fundamental
Standards Committee similar to the
Honor Code Committee was also
recommended. This would involve
changing the name and function of
the Social Policies Committee in
stead of creating a new group. This
committee would indoctrinate stu
dents and make them more aware of
the Fundamental Standard.
New Men's Association
Three of the proposals, recom
mended by discussion groups but
not voted upon in plenary session
because of lack of time, were an
Associated Men Students, schedul
ing of a course in current events by
the University, and consultations on
finances for house and float deco
rations by the living groups in
volved.
Other recommendations voted on
by members of the Workshop are
the possibility of a more serious
campus magazine in addition to the
Chaparral, the faculty rating plan,
and a YMCA on campus.
The Workshop was presided over
by ASSU President Hank Rosin.
Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton made the opening address
Friday afternoon and stressed the
necessity of more campus unity.
