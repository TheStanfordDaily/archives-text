# 'Plague' Strikes Encina Diners
## 200 Hall Men Show Symptoms Of Food Poisoning Over Weekend 
### BILL STOLTZE 
"The Plague" struck suddenly at the Farm late Thursday after
noon, and before the weekend was over, 200 regular diners at En
cina Commons were hit by acute nausea, cramps, and other symp
toms indicating food poisoning.
Three doctors from the Student Health Service were busy most

of Thursday night anwering calls
from Encina and Toyon. In Encina,
one wing alone had 28 cases of "Tho
Plague." Only three or four men
were present at some Friday morning
Western Civ classes.
Humors circulating through the
freshman class ascribed the sickness
to pre-Jamboree activities of the
sophomores unitl they found out that
Toyon men were as sick as those at
Encina.
Mrs. Ellene Sumner, director of
Encina Hall, said that the sickness
was relatively mild and in most cases
lasted only a few hours. On Friday
morning, she estimated that "Be
tween 50 and 100 Encina men were
affected by the malady," but by noon
Saturday, Toyon men and new cases
had swelled the total.
Miss Margaret Riasetto, campus
Public Health nurse, made a cautious
estimate that there were 200 cases of
the sickness. This was based on a
count of forms which were given to
every sick student to fill out in an
effort to trace the cause.
Dr. George Houck, head of the
Health Service, said "Almost nobody
has been sick that didn't eat at En
cina, so that it is pretty deiinitely
related to food. The first three cases
appeared before the evening meal,
indicating the sickness was probably
connected with lunch."
Said Miss Riasetto, "We can't con
clusively prove that it's food, even
though an explosion of this typo indi
cates that might be the cause."
Cultures of the food served at
Thursday's lunch are being prepared
at the Palo Alto Hospital laboratory,
but none of the suspected hash was
left over, so that the actual cause of
the sickness may never be proved
conclusively. Water and milk are
tested regularly, but authorities have
discarded them as likely factors be
cause they would have affected other
campus eating groups also.
