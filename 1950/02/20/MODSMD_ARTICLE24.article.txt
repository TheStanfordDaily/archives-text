# No Code Violators on Councils
## 
### 
Excom is now considering a proposed by-law
which would prevent students convicted of
Honor Code violations from serving on Men's
or Women's Council.
Excom defeated a similar proposal last
spring, 011 the grounds that once a student has
been punished for his violation of the Code, the
matter should be closed ... no further stigma
should be attached to him because of his mis
step.
At that time The Daily took exception to Ex
corn's action and stated that the by-law should
be adopted. Our stand on the question has not
changed.
We believe that if a person is morally weak
enough to violate the Honor Code, he certainly
lacks the moral strength to judge violators.
Honor Code violators seek posts on one of the
Councils, but the by-law should be adopted to
protect the Code whenever necessary.
In 1931 a Daily editorial stated:
"It is vitally important that the men selected
lor the Council work earnestly and honestly for
the vigorous enforcement of the (Honor) Code.
"A . . . student is today a candidate for
(Men's Council) —whose duty it is to enforce
the Code he refused to observe.
"What can be the attitude towards enforce
ment of a man who has twice been convicted of
violating the Honor Code? Will he favor the
sentencing of other students for cheating as he
cheated?"

Stanford's enrollment was much smaller in
1931. The Daily did not mention the candidate's
name, but "word got around" and the violator
was soundly defeated at the polls.
Honor Code violators are suspended from the
University for one or two quarters to give them
a chance to "think it over," in the hope that they
will be better, more honorable, people as a re
sult of the experience.
If theory worked perfectly in practice, there
would be no need lor the proposed by-law. A
"reformed" Honor Code violator would be an
asset to Council, because he would have a bet
ter understanding of the problems involved in
the cases he would judge.
The very fact that second violations do occur,
however, shows that the theory does not work
perfectly.
A single Honor Code violator among the ten
members of the joint Councils, who together
judge Code violations, would have little influ
ence on Council's handling ol a case.
But each member of Council alfects, through
his questions and statements, the violator's at
titude. This is the real danger point. One
wrong statement can lead a violator to a false
justification for violating the Honor Code.
The proposed by-law will be discussed by
Excom at an open meeting tonight at 8. We hope
that the by-law will be adopted; we believe it
is necessary.

that the by-law will be adopted; we believe it
is necessary.
Excom is now considering a proposed by-law
which would prevent students convicted of
Honor Code violations from serving on Men's
or Women's Council.
Excom defeated a similar proposal last
spring, 011 the grounds that once a student has
been punished for his violation of the Code, the
matter should be closed ... no further stigma
should be attached to him because of his mis
step.
At that time The Daily took exception to Ex
corn's action and stated that the by-law should
be adopted. Our stand on the question has not
changed.
We believe that if a person is morally weak
enough to violate the Honor Code, he certainly
lacks the moral strength to judge violators.
Honor Code violators seek posts on one of the
Councils, but the by-law should be adopted to
protect the Code whenever necessary.
In 1931 a Daily editorial stated:
"It is vitally important that the men selected
lor the Council work earnestly and honestly for
the vigorous enforcement of the (Honor) Code.
"A . . . student is today a candidate for
(Men's Council) —whose duty it is to enforce
the Code he refused to observe.
"What can be the attitude towards enforce
ment of a man who has twice been convicted of
violating the Honor Code? Will he favor the
sentencing of other students for cheating as he
cheated?"

Stanford's enrollment was much smaller in
1931. The Daily did not mention the candidate's
name, but "word got around" and the violator
was soundly defeated at the polls.
Honor Code violators are suspended from the
University for one or two quarters to give them
a chance to "think it over," in the hope that they
will be better, more honorable, people as a re
sult of the experience.
If theory worked perfectly in practice, there
would be no need lor the proposed by-law. A
"reformed" Honor Code violator would be an
asset to Council, because he would have a bet
ter understanding of the problems involved in
the cases he would judge.
The very fact that second violations do occur,
however, shows that the theory does not work
perfectly.
A single Honor Code violator among the ten
members of the joint Councils, who together
judge Code violations, would have little influ
ence on Council's handling ol a case.
But each member of Council alfects, through
his questions and statements, the violator's at
titude. This is the real danger point. One
wrong statement can lead a violator to a false
justification for violating the Honor Code.
The proposed by-law will be discussed by
Excom at an open meeting tonight at 8. We hope
that the by-law will be adopted; we believe it
is necessary.
