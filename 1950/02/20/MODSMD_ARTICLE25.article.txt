# The 						Frosh-Soph Tradition
## 
### 
For three consecutive years Stanford fresh
men and sophomores have set aside one week
end during which the students could rise up
and settle the issue of class superiority.
It's part of the rivalry which originally ex
pressed itself in the hazing of the first-year men
from registration day on. But the modern idea
has changed from the felt dinks which labeled
freshmen as "greenhorns."
Some small colleges still continue allowing
sophornore.s to throw freshmen in ponds, and
forbid the "plebes" from wearing Levis and
cords. But this is a far cry from life oh the Farm
- - as the students have decided it should be.
In place of sophomores armed with canoe
paddles in September, Stanford has instituted a
friendly orientation program headed by the Pre-
Reg Committee. Except for the taunts and yells

tossed back and forth between the two classes
during fall football rallies, there has been little
class animosity.
The one unfortunate exception was the Paja
marino which caused $1,000 damages two years
ago.
To replace this traditional event the students
wisely instituted the Frosh-Soph Jamboree. As
a "steam-escape-valve" for the class spirit
which is bound to exist, the weekend activity
has been accepted by three Frosh-Soph classes
as one of the top traditions of Stanford.
Committees of both classes did a fine job of
stirring up enthusiasm among their members
this year. They are to be congratulated for car
rying out so well the Frosh-Soph tradition,
which has grown to be so strong on the Farm.
