Oa 1 ehalf of the entire class of '52, I would like to
thank all those who participated in the FYosh-Soph
Jamboree, and to tell them how much we appreciated
their efforts.
Jerry Smith, sophomore chairman of the Jamboree,
particularly deserves credit for his excellent job of
organization. Also, we'd like to acknowledge the hard
work of Keith Beekman, publicity chairman; Shirley
Casolla, who planned the Jamboree Ball; Bill Theiss,
who planned and painted the class mural; Jack Gole

nor, who directed the '52 entertainment; Wayne
Alley, who contacted all the contest participants; Mar
ion Bruinmei, who organized the women's events; and
Stn Handmaker, who published a special issue of the
triads newspaper. The list could go on indefinitely,
since every member in the class contributed to the
Jamboree.
Thanks also should go to Dick Weisman, freshman
president, and Hud Nutting, freshman chairman of the
Jamboree, for their fine co-operation.
