# THE 						CAGE CREW
## Southern Eagle-eyes Down Hapless Cards 
### AL BERRY 
Stanford's visiting case Indians
dropped a pair over the weekend,
but they didn't lay down and play
like they liked it.
And it was George Yardley, eas
ily the best Card eager since Pol
lard, who kept the Cards in the
games and sizzled the court with (1)
rebounds, (2) door play, and (3)
high-point honors for both nights.
But Yardley or no, it was the
"Smog - town melon - pushers" who
had the team and thus the ball
games.
In the Bruin gym, Westwooders
Sawyer, Stanich, and Sheldrake
tanked in 45 points between them,
and after the first nip-and-tuek 15
minutes the Indians never regained
the lead. Carl Kraushaar, who
dumped the Indians pracically sin
gle-handed (with 22 points) in the
last game at Stanford, was held to
a none-too-sterling 2 points by the
fiery guarding of center Jim Ram
stead. Indian Jim Walsh also hit the
bucket-parade with 13 points.
Saturday night the Indians got
mad. And George "The Bird" Yard
ley out - sharmanized the vaunted
Sharman. The story was the same
Yardley on the backboards, Yard
ley on the iloor, and Yardley high
point man for the evening with 21
points. Walsh came through with 15
and the Indians were in the game
until the gun went off.
But the story was the same for
the Trojans top. Sharman, some
times completely forgotten on the
floor, dropped in 18. And the in

| credible monsters Stan Christie and
1 Jo-Jo White busted in 2G points be
| tween them.
The real heart - breaker of the
three-point loss came in the free
! throw department. The Indians
missed nine of the easy ones.

—and Kraushaar got two points
Stanford's visiting case Indians
dropped a pair over the weekend,
but they didn't lay down and play
like they liked it.
And it was George Yardley, eas
ily the best Card eager since Pol
lard, who kept the Cards in the
games and sizzled the court with (1)
rebounds, (2) door play, and (3)
high-point honors for both nights.
But Yardley or no, it was the
"Smog - town melon - pushers" who
had the team and thus the ball
games.
In the Bruin gym, Westwooders
Sawyer, Stanich, and Sheldrake
tanked in 45 points between them,
and after the first nip-and-tuek 15
minutes the Indians never regained
the lead. Carl Kraushaar, who
dumped the Indians pracically sin
gle-handed (with 22 points) in the
last game at Stanford, was held to
a none-too-sterling 2 points by the
fiery guarding of center Jim Ram
stead. Indian Jim Walsh also hit the
bucket-parade with 13 points.
Saturday night the Indians got
mad. And George "The Bird" Yard
ley out - sharmanized the vaunted
Sharman. The story was the same
Yardley on the backboards, Yard
ley on the iloor, and Yardley high
point man for the evening with 21
points. Walsh came through with 15
and the Indians were in the game
until the gun went off.
But the story was the same for
the Trojans top. Sharman, some
times completely forgotten on the
floor, dropped in 18. And the in

| credible monsters Stan Christie and
1 Jo-Jo White busted in 2G points be
| tween them.
The real heart - breaker of the
three-point loss came in the free
! throw department. The Indians
missed nine of the easy ones.
