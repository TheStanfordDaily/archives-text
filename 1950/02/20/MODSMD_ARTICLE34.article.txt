## Indian Nine Shut Out By Berkoviches 
### 
The star-studded Berkovich nine
of Oakland had too many guns Sat
urday afternoon as they downed the
Indian horsehiders 5 to 0 in the
Sunken Diamond. Two Berkovich
chuckers, Bob Wittig and Clayton
Church, administered the shut-out,
allowing the Cards only three hits.
The old bug-a-boo, bases on balls,
hindered the Card hurlers as they
gave nine batters free passes, two
of them resulting in runs.
The Berkovich nine got to starting
pitcher Jack Heinen for their first
run in the third inning, and put
together three singles for two more
in the fourth.
Shive Relieves
Ed Shive, who came in to relieve
Heinen in the sixth stanza, held the
Oalclanders off until the eighth
frame, when they scored a run and
put men on first and third. Jim
Claypool then came in to relieve,
and the Berkovich men pushed
across another run to end the scor
ing before the inning was over.
The Indians failed to get a man
on the base paths until the third
inning, when catcher Bill Herron
drew a base on balls. However, he
was thrown out attempting to steal
second.
The home nine put on their most
serious scoring threat in the sixth
frame, when Bob Larson gained life
on an error after two were out.
Dave Melton moved Larson on to
third when he lofted a double into
centerfield, the only extra - base
blow of the contest.
John Claypool then blasted a one
and two pitch down the first base
line, that had two bases written all
over it, but the ball fell foul by a
foot. On the next pitch Claypool
struck out to end the inning.
Browns on Tuesday
The varsity makes its next ap
pearance Tuesday afternoon, when
they cross bats with the St. Louis
browns rookies, whom they downed
last Thursday in an exciting 6 to 5
game.
In a Saturday morning tilt, the
JV's lost an 11 to 4 decision to San
Mateo JC. Bases on balls were also
the downfall of the JV pitchers.
