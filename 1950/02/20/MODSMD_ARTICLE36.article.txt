Tour weeks of retirement evi
dently didn't hurt Ray Lunny's
fighters as they pounded out a deci
sive s'j to victory over Santa
Clara in the Pavilion Friday night.
A near - capacity crowd cheered
the Indian fistic waVriors who won
four bouts by decisions, lost one.
had one draw, and lost two and won
one by forfeit.
The heavyweight match, which
was to have marked the first ap
pearance of Don Enberg not only as
a varsity boxer but as a heavy
weight, never materialized. Patty
Walsh of the Broncos was reported
ill and Coach Julie Menendez was
forced to forfeit the fight to Stan
ford. As in the last two fights, the
Cards forfeited the 125- and 130-lb.
classes.
Light - heavy Jim Hammond, re
turned to the ring alter several
weeks of inaction, tired perceptibly
near the end of his bout, but his
experience and hard punching gave
him a good edge over Santa Clara's
Bob Hentchell. Hammond, who
scored a clean knock-down in the
first round, was awarded the deci
sion.
Stanford's welterweights, Jose
Rael and Karl May, were seen in
two of the best fights on the card.
May fought Bob Ratliif in a match
that was 'slug" from the word go.
Both boys were in good shape and
kept up the furious pace until the
final bell however neither showed a
superiority and the bout was called
a draw.
More on the scientific side was
Rael's close battle with Bronc Bill
Sullivan. The two fighters moved

around well and both scored with
blows to the body and head, but
Rael's experience told the tale and
he won the judges' decision.
John Colton showed he is a comer |
when he turned in his best fight to
date in decisioning Santa Claran Ed !
Vranizan. Colton started with a
rush and floored Vranizan with a j
hard right in the first round and
later partially knocked him through
the ropes. The Santa Claran came
back in the last two rounds but did
n't have enough and Colton took the
decision.
Aggressive Bill Sharp, Card mid- i
dleweight, who had Bill Celeri
hanging on in the last two rounds, I
won a clear - cut decision. Sharp
battered Celeri with telling body j
punches and had the Missionite
groggy at the end of their tussle.
Bob Baker, Stanford lightweight. |
was decisioned by the accurate, j
hard-fighting tactics of A 1 Terraz-
ZclS.
In a preliminary bout Santa Clara
130-pounders Don Shultz and Bill
Silvera fought a no-decision match. I
