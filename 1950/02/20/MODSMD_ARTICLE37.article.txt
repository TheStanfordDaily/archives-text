# Matmen Lose To Powerful San Jose State
## 
### 
Stanford's grapplers failed to im
prove on their previous 17 to 13 loss
to Sun Jose State and they were
again defeated by the powerful
Spartan squad 19 to 10 Friday night
in San .Tose.
The Staters scored most of their
team points on close-decision bouts.
Only two falls were recorded for
the evening, one by Stanford's
heavyweight, Smilin' Steve Garst,
who pinned Ray Dodson early in the
second period, and the other by San
Jose's "mighty mite," Ben Ichikawa,
who threw Card 128-pounder Dick
Cruce in the second stanza.
Niles Severin, 155-lb Indian var
sity matman, grappled Al Morocco
to that rarity in wrestling matches,
a 0 to 0 draw. Neither man could
gain the advantage even with top
time.
In one of the better bouts on the
card, Stanford Captain Don Wil
liams scored a 4 to 3 decision over
Bob Hall. Two weeks ago Williams
decisioned another State 136-
pounder, Bob Jackson.
The middleweight match was held
at the half-time of the San Jose and
San Diego basketball game, with
Stanford's Bob Harmon paired
against Dick Campbell. Campbell
won a close decision.
Card light - heavy Dick DeWitt,
still sick from some tainted Encina
food, gave up a decision to Bud
Manginini.
