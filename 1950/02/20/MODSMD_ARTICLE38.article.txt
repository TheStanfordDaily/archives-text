# Papooses Smash Galileo, 55-33, As Starters Rest
## 
### 
The freshman basketball team |
had little trouble putting down Gal- ,
ileo High Friday afternoon. With'
reserves playing most of the game,
the frosh annihilated their rivals -55
to 33.
The game started out as if it !
would be a real thriller. At the end
of 10 minutes the tally was 10 to 14
in favor of the locals. Then the bot- j
torn went out of the Galileo team I
and by half-time the frosh led 32
to 17.
Claude Rosenberg, who was pinch
hitting for Coach Bob Burnett, sent 1
1G men to the boards during the
game. The reserves played most of
the game after the first quarter, and j
many of them showed very well
under the strain of play. Jack Cos- I
grove, Frank Yapp, Bob Mace, Jack
Shephard, and Jim Harding were;
particularly steady.
Galileo's much - heralded center,
Don Bragg, was held to an unim
pressive three points and failed to
perform on the backboards with the !
efficiency that has marked his play
in other games this season.
Wild and inaccurate shooting on

the part of the visitors was the
greatest single cause of the lop
sided score. In the second half they
only munaged to put through 16 per
cent of their shots, it some could
have been called shots at all. Guard
Bob Tamalier tied Stanford's high
scorer by bucketing 10 points.
Guard Fritz Fenster was high
for the frosh with 10 points on
four set shots and a free throw.
Forward Paul Johnson and center
Bill Stevenson tallied eight apiece
for the time they spent in play.
