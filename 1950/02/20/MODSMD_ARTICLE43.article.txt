# Farm Fraternities Offer Tarver Scholarship Now
## Year of Graduate Work in Foreign University to Be Awarded Winner 
### 
Stanford's 24 fraternities are again
offering a year of graduate study in
a foreign university to a senior fra
ternity man through the Tarver In
terfraternity Exchange Scholarship.
By arrangement with the foreign
school the fraternity man, to be cho
sen by the Intcrfraternity Board of
Control, will have tuition, room, and
board paid for one year.
In return, the fraternities will
offer a year's study at Stanford to
a representative of the foreign in
stitution. He will live at the house
of the Stanford student who wins
the grant.
"We arc contacting foreign
schools now," said Walt Varellas,
president of IFB. 'We hope to
obtain money for transportation
through the institute of Interna
tional Education in New York."
Varellas Announces Terms
Varellas explained that the fol
lowing terms govern the Tarver
Scholarship:
1. The Stanford student will be
selected by IFB on a basis of "all
around merit" from a list of senior
men consisting of no more than one
man from each fraternity.
2. No fraternity may send a man
more than once in four years.
3. The nominee must have at
tended Stanford for at least two
years before nomination. He must
graduate before actually receiving
the award.
4. The Stanford student will be
furnished tuition, room and board
(and perhaps transportation).
5. The exchange student from the
foreign university will live three

quarters in the fraternity of the
award - winner as a guest of that
house.
For the past three years, the ex
change has been with the Univer
sity of London. "We may exchange
with London again this year," Va
rellas said. "But we will try to
make arrangements with other
schools so that the winner can have
as wide a choice as possible."
