# LAKE OPENING
## Canoe Tips Mark Lag's Opening Day 
### 
Old Man Weather looked fa
vorably on Lagunita yesterday
| as hundreds of boaters, bathers,
| sun-baskers, and just plain visi
tors look advantage of opening
day on the "little lake."
Not since 1946 has Lake Lag been
' used in the depth of winter, and as
; far as the students were concerned,
it might as well he spring.
From the time El Capitan and Vil
lage *510 broke out the first canoes
at 10: l. r > a.m. until the fog rolled
down over the nearby foothills at 6,
the Boathousc and adjacent shores
were swarming with book-weary
Stanfordites, eager for a taste of that
I far-off summer vacation.
#
Typical Summer
It was a typical summer scene.
Coeds in sunsuits lounged on beach
towels, soaking in sun and baby oil,
while canoeing males engaged in wa
ter fights o/T shore or glanced hesi
tantly at the cold and murky water
' from the dock. Yes, there were uke-
I lelcs and "wish you were here" lct
j tcrs, too.
Kathleen Walker of Roble was the
first swimmer to break the ice for the
season, diving in at 10:40. After 40
minutes in the drink, Miss Walker
spent the rest of the day thawing out
| on the Boathousc boards.
I Reflecting the sentiments of those
who dared to imitate her, the Roble
cocd said, "It's freezing," but added
; that "it's all right after you get. numb
| and can't feci it any more."
Dry Roughs
The roughs, for once, were satis
j fied with the dry state of things on
shore, even the fully clothed one who
! helped a cocd make her first dive
I with the exclamation, "I hate sissies."
It was not until high noon that the
i first males ventured into the lake—
\ the hard way—when the shark-faced
red Beta canoe capsized, throwing
I Mort White, Gordy White, and Bill
j Drummond overboard.
Al Throckmorton and Phil Har
\ rison were two other unwilling
swimmers when the "Encina-2" de
veloped a fast leak. Unlike their fel
low conoeists, the frosh were fully
clothed. Freshman Scott Fitzgerald
made a fully-dressed descent into
j the muddy waters in the afternoon
! when he came out second-best in a
dunking attempt.
Midge Price of Union was the first
J casualty of the day when she picked
up a sliver in her heel. Obliging Life
Guard Hub Stokely extracted the
[ fragment while a helpful rough took
; the coed's pulse. According to Miss
Price, who hails from Evanston, 111.,
the lake was "cold, but not as cold
us Lake Michigan."
Life Guards Stokely and and Ernie
Potts kept a protective watch over
their swimmers, but neither ventured
to so much as wet a little toe.

Dry Roughs
The roughs, for once, were satis
j fied with the dry state of things on
shore, even the fully clothed one who

I with the exclamation, "I hate sissies."
It was not until high noon that the
i first males ventured into the lake—
\ the hard way—when the shark-faced
red Beta canoe capsized, throwing
I Mort White, Gordy White, and Bill
j Drummond overboard.
Al Throckmorton and Phil Har
\ rison were two other unwilling
swimmers when the "Encina-2" de
veloped a fast leak. Unlike their fel
low conoeists, the frosh were fully
clothed. Freshman Scott Fitzgerald
made a fully-dressed descent into
j the muddy waters in the afternoon
! when he came out second-best in a
dunking attempt.
Midge Price of Union was the first
J casualty of the day when she picked
up a sliver in her heel. Obliging Life
Guard Hub Stokely extracted the
[ fragment while a helpful rough took
; the coed's pulse. According to Miss
Price, who hails from Evanston, 111.,
the lake was "cold, but not as cold
us Lake Michigan."
Life Guards Stokely and and Ernie
Potts kept a protective watch over
their swimmers, but neither ventured
to so much as wet a little toe.

Typical Summer
It was a typical summer scene.
Coeds in sunsuits lounged on beach
towels, soaking in sun and baby oil,
while canoeing males engaged in wa
ter fights o/T shore or glanced hesi
tantly at the cold and murky water
' from the dock. Yes, there were uke-
I lelcs and "wish you were here" lct
j tcrs, too.
Kathleen Walker of Roble was the
first swimmer to break the ice for the
season, diving in at 10:40. After 40
minutes in the drink, Miss Walker
spent the rest of the day thawing out
| on the Boathousc boards.
I Reflecting the sentiments of those
who dared to imitate her, the Roble
cocd said, "It's freezing," but added
; that "it's all right after you get. numb
| and can't feci it any more."
