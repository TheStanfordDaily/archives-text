## 251 Farm Students Drop Below 'C' Average In Fall Quarter 
### JOYCE KERN 
A total of 251 students failed dur
ing autumn quarter to meet the
minimum scholastic standard con
sidered satisfactory by the Univer
sity.
For undergraduate students this
standard is a "C" average and, for
15 units, constitutes .'lO grade points,
which is 2 grade points per unit
registered. These grade points, bow
ever, are not to be confused with
the grade-point surplus or deficien
cy, which is the amount a student is
considered plus or minus.
For graduate students, records
below standard arc subject to re
view by the Scholarship Committee
and appropriate action is taken in
individual eases.
Of the students who did not meet
â™¦he University standard, IK.'t are on
probation, .'5O were suspended, and
29 disqualified.
Grade-Point Deficiencies
The student whose grade - point
deficiency falls between 11 ;.nd
20 is in the probation category. A

student is permitted only two quar-i
tors in this status, regardless of
whether or not. they are consecutive
quarters. The third time his grades
frill within this range, lie is subject
lo suspension.
Suspension may also result from
accumulation of a grade-point de
ficiency of between - 21 and HO
The student when suspended may*
not return to the University for a
minimum of two quarters. His re
turn is granted hy the Scholarship
Committee only after lie has pre
senter! acceptable reasons to them
for his grade deficiency, fie must
then overcome at least, half of this
deficiency within the next two
quarters. No women fell within
these boundaries during autumn
quarter.
The suspension - option group is
composed of suspended students
who are over 21 years of age, or
who have completed seven or more
quarters of university work. A stu
dent in this group may ask that his
suspension be waived, hut in so do
ing, his caliber of work must im

prove substantially in one quarter.
Disqualification of Students
If a student reaches a grade de
ficiency of .11, or if he fails to meet
requirements following his return
after suspension, he will he disqual
ified. He is then not eligible to re
turn to Stanford.
In individual cases where the cir
nJustam e:; appear to justify special
consideration, a student may be
subject to Scholarship Committee
action when the deficiency is less
than within the indicated margins;
on the other hand, even when the
deficiency is as great as the stated
amount, action is sometimes with
held.
Action on scnoiastic denciency for
autumn quarter shows the follow
ing division totals: lower division
men, 144; lower division women. 22;
upper division men, 65; upper divi
sion women, 3; graduate men, 12;
graduate women, 5.
