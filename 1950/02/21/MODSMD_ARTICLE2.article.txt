WASHINGTON Federal Judge
Richmond B. Kecch today hurled a
criminal contempt of court citation
at' John L. Lewis' striking union for
defying the court's order to (lit; coal.
The United Mine Workers, which
twice before has paid heavy fines
for flouting a judge's command,
must appear Friday and explain
why 372,000 soft coal workers have
refused since last Monday to obey.
If the union's story doesn't satisfy
the court, a trial will be held next
Monday.
