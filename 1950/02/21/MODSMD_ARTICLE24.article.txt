# Searsville Pipe Breaks Causing Road Cave-in
## Workers Barricade Road Near Golf Course; Pavement Floats Up, Down 
### 
A 12-inch water main broke about noon yesterday beneath Foot
hill Boulevard near the golf course, causing a 20-foot-long road
cave-in.
Water seepage forced the pavement up about a foot, but when
wokmen arrived and turned off the main the street sank below the

original surface.
While policeman directed traffic,
laborers barricaded the road and be
gan to dig to the source of the break.
When air-hammers were put to the
asphalt, the ground sank even deeper.
Late yesterday water was still
bubbling from the crater to the
shoulder of the road.
Most of the day was spent in mak
ing the road passable Lanterns and
wooden bariers were placed around
the center of the pavement. Room
was cleared for cars to pass safely on
either side, fcut the Stanford Police
Department urged drivers to travel
slowly until the boulevard is re
paired
Frank Tolman, foreman of the
plumbing shop, said that excavation
would continue today. Full informa
tion as to what caused the break and
how much water was lost will not be
available until the digging is com
pleted.
The pipe has its source at Sears
villc Lake and supplies water for
campus Irrigation Lake Lagunita
will be unaflected by the disruption.
. This break in a water main was the
second such occurrence in the past
two weeks. This event was less sen
sational than the burst of February
9 which sent a geyser of water 50
feet into the air at Serra and Galvez
streets.
