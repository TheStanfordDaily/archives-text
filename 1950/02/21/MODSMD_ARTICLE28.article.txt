# That Committee Again

### 
Freedom of the press is, like all other rights,
something that has to be protected constantly
or else it will slip away.
Nov/ th<• Committee on Public Exercises, in
our opinion has authority in a great many
strange respects. But one of the strangest
things they have done happened last week.
The Committee didn't actually tell us about
their edict, but they communicated it to the
group which wanted its actions publicized.
It seem;, as though there is a rule that re
ligious organizations may have publicity when
their meetings are off-campus but not when
they are on-carnpus.
This in itself seems father contradictory to
us. The only possible justification that we can
see is that ii's all right lor students to be re
ligious in a secular soit of way but not if they
do it on campus.
Last v/eek the Hillel Club gave jii all-campus

movie. It was open lo all students and was
shown in the Women's Clubhouse.
After two stories had appeared in The Daily,
the Committee informed the Hillel Club that
they were to receive no more publicity because
the function was on-carnpus.
As far as we are concerned, the Committee
can reluse the use of any building, can prohibit
any meetings, can keep us from hearing politi
cal speakers, and in general censor the dis
semination of any doctrine on campus that they
wish, but they're not going to tell us what we
can publish and what we can't.
If a campus religious organization holds an
activity that we believe warrants publicity in
the paper, that publicity will be given.
If the Committee wishes to discuss the mat
ter, they are welcome to t.ilk to the members
ol Editorial Board. M.K.
