# THE 						FRONT ROW
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Tins morning we start something now- a column
called the Front Row-something new which 1 hope
will get to I < old stuff with you in a short time.
This new column, being about Stanford, will con
cern itsell' with just that.
it'll be a column about (he students: About the first

ones to run down to the lake to
lind out that it's still too cold and
too muddy; about the ones who sit
out hi a lorn; lint' of dark parked
cars In front of Durand and Jor
dan around 10 each night and
make liars out of conservative
necking statistics; about the l'ra
t, rnity men trying to beat the
easoii with an early trip to the
y.undeck; about the ones who
bump into each other going
through the loom-for one-only

doors at the Post Oflice; about the ones who make that
afternoon race tor Rossott's every time it turns up
• unny; and it 11 be about the ones who complain that
they b-.ven't cracked a book yet, and then breeze
through that midterm while guys like me are com
plaining that thf prof didn't base his test on the right
stuff.

It'll be a column about the sports scene: Of the ath
letes who are making good discussion fodder; of Un
contests that are taking place; and of behind-the
scenes stories which deserve a good ride.
It'll he a column about (tie run lor I'M ( amino: Such
as, what's cooking besides chile down at. Dinah's?
What's with tbt* new Frank Ferranti's? Which combo
is currently beating its brains out down at the Band
Box?
It'll be a column about the tlicks being' sold: About
those which you may be able to sit through, and about
those which should nevei have been hatched.
Finally, it'll be a column about the college student's
sense of humor: (1 hope) Concerning the leading
chuckle-getters of the day, some stolen from a 1927
Chappie (which won't !,e used again by Chaparral
until next August), and others stolen from private
sources.
So, with these American lioy ideals in my hip
pocket, a smile on my lips, and a motto of Herb Caen
be-damned exciting me with energy, the Front How
begins its daily pitch.
From here on in—as Red Skelton's mean little kid
likes to say 1 call's 'em the I see's 'em.
Grab a seat, it might prove interesting.
