# Peck Shares Honors In '12 O'Clock High'
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
The 918 th was a heavy bomber
squadron based in England in 15)42.
They called it the hard-luck squad
ron because 10 or 20 men from the
918 th would be blasted to bits over
Germany in every raid.
"Twelve O'Clock High" is the
story of ibe illBth and of Gen. Frank

Savage (Greg
ory Peck) who
didn't believe in
hard luck. He
look over the
!) I H th fro ni a
commander who
had too much
sympathy fur the
men who died.

Savage made his men bate him
because they'll llv better il they bad
something to hate. llf whipped and
swore his men into a flying team,
and be stuffed his own feelings down
In , throat until he choked on them.
Peck Outstanding
As the general who must, hold
back his own sympathies and emo
tions until they are so .strong they
crack his martinet exterior, Gregory

Peck gives one of his finest per
formances.
But he must share acting honors
with Hugh Marlowe, a sensitive
coward whom Savage taunts into
becoming a man; Gary Merrill, ex
commander ol the 918 th, who can t
hide his feelings and send his men
to death at nine thousand feet with
equanimity; and especially with
Dean Jagger, the ground executive,
a let read from the last war who
gets drunk for the first time when
Merrill cracks.
Realistic
"Twelve G'Clock High" is not the
best film of the year but it deserves
a salute for the cliches it avoids.
The war picture lypicals are miss
in) 1 ,. There is no homesick rookie, no
wi.se guy, no coward who redeems
himself by saving 50 lives and get
ting killed himself. There is also
no attempt to make the war "cute."
'1 he actors in "Twelve O'Clock
High" appear to be fighting a war
and not thinking up clever lines that
are just, clean enough to avoid the
Hollywood censor.
The film loses sortie punch because
the average movie - goer doesn't
realize or believe that so much rode
on the success of daylight precision
bombing. If these test squadrons
had failed, the film tt lis you, the
war would have been lengthened at
least a year, but il was never quite
proved to me.
