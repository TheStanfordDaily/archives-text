Let's get this one over fast.
Three nights ago Stanford lost its eleventh straight basketball game to
the USC Trojans. Four nights ago the Indians dropped their sixth straight
to UCLA. You've already seen the scores, 02 to 59 to Troy, and (if) to 59 to
the Bruins.
For the record, it marked Stanford's seventh Southern Division loss, es
tablished new records in losing streaks to both USC and UCLA, kept alive
the Southland jinx which has kept the Cards winless in Los Angeles since
1947, and just about brought 1950 relations to a quick conclusion. (The boys
■■i t one more shot at USC and UCLA this weekend in the Pavilion.)
Like they used to say on a radio program—l was there—so pass the bicarb,
and we'll mush through the gruesome details, some of which are pretty
gruesome.
Season's Best Ball
Believe it or not, Stanford played some of its best basketball of the season.
George Yard ley continued the pace he started against USC two weeks ago,
all of which make him the outstanding man on the floors of both the Bruin
Gym (George Stanich was close) anil the Ban Pacific (some might say that
Bill Sharman was relaxing).
Bomber George outscored Sharman for the third consecutive time, made
like a one-man carnival again on the backboards, and stamped himself as a
must on the all-Division five and a'probable on the all-Coast club.
He made three plays in particular against UCLA that left the crowd in a
1. Rebounding oil the offensive hoard, he was shoved into a right angle
going away from the basket. Bui, with his back toward the basket and
leaning toward the floor he pushed the ball over his head and into the cup
for two.
2. Alter Jim Walsh had let go from the corner, George came roaring
through for the follow. Walsh's shot took a high bounce off the rim, but
Yard ley who was slill in the air, grablM>d the ball about a foot over the
basket and stuffed it through the net all in one motion.
3. This one was the business end of a fast break. Jim Walsh, dribbling
full speed at the bucket, fired a behind-the-back pass to Gus Chavalas,
who lapped the ball to Yardley, who flippel it from his belt with his left
band for another.
llis two-night total of 40 points zoomed his season effort to 141 (Sharman
has 172, which is 14 ahead of the record pace set by Hank Luisetti), and
widened the margin between himself and Bruin A 1 Sawyer to 23 points.
A (,ouple of lis
But, let's go back to the fcallgames. Had a couple of ifs developed, Everett
Dean's Injuns could have won on either night.
With Yardley and Jim Ramstead working the boards, and Yardley and
Jirll Walsh peppering the hoop, Stanford jammed past the Bruins midway
through the initial half. Matching Wooden's Wonders speed for speed, the
Tribe maintained a two-point lead until 7 minutes before lunch time. Here
developed the first if.
With Dean inserting his seconds to rest the regulars, Stanich and Ed
Sheldrake exploded to burst into a 7-point halftihne lead at 39 to 32. Had
the starters not tired, or had Dean chosen to stagger through regardless,
Stanford might have kept that lead.
However, having chosen to employ a fast-break offense and a man-to
man defense against UCLA, it was almost a certainty that the same five
men couldn't handle the lull duty.
Saturday night in the Pan, Stanford used the same last stuff against Troy,
but changed to a zone. Everything was working just line, until a new if
started to see life.
This time it was missed free throws that caused the damage. At halltime,
the scoreeards showed that Stanford had missed seven charity tosses, while
USC had only muffed one. This hurt plenty, because as Stanford came to
life in the sceond half with its best all-around play of the season, those
seven points got bigger and bigger. «
Sharman No! the Difference
Bill Sharman, who started out like a jet, was not the difference. Instead,
ii was center Stan Christie, who flipped in five straight field goals in the
lir.st six minutes of the second half.
Sharman had made his first four shots from the floor to pile up 10 points
in live minutes (Yardley was doing exactly the same), and might have gone
completely wild if Harry Hugasian and Bill Warren hadn't started playing
him tight. Warren kept with nim for almost the entire second half, doing a
terrific job of halting the flow.
Stanford was still in the process of closing the 11-point gap created by
Christie's outburst at the final gun, as Jim Walsh and George Yardley had
refused to quit.
Walsh's return to his early-season form was an encouraging sign. Hitting
most of his points from about 25 feet out, he demonstrated also that he
could still drive with the ball, under several times for hard-earned
h.y-ups.
You (]a»*t Lose Them All
Combine Stanford's first-half against UCLA with the second half against
USC and you have a ballgame. Mekbe that will be the program for next
weekend. UCLA, except in the war year of 1946. has never swept a four
game series from Stanford. And USC has already set a new record in con
secutives over the Tribe. One of these nights that overdue upset is going
to weather the storm. Leave us face it. you just can't lose every time.
FIIEE SHOTS: Sophomore Bruce Iverson, a starter since the first Cal
game, didn't see one minute of action. Harry Hugasian started instead, and
Itill Warren took over from there. Hampered by a bad thumb and a Shel
drake elbow early in the tilt. Jack O'Sullivan tossed in just one FT against
UCLA. Nice guy Karl Kraushaar came over to the Stanford dressing room
before the Friday night clash to offer best wishes. He must have meant it be
cause he only deposited 2 points for the whole distance. The LA Mirror made
note of George Stanich's two-blow fight with Jim Walsh, saying that it was
the first time in history that Stanich ever lost his head. The Mirror oughta
lire that reporter. He must have forgotten the time Stanich went at it with
Milt Iverson in the Pavilion, and the time he squared off against Bill
Stephenson in the Olympic Auditorium, and the million and one times he
has screamed at the refs, and his terrible tantrums on the baseball field.
Georgie is a great ball player, but he's a great ballplayer with a hot temper.
Anyway, he missed Walsh with both blows.
