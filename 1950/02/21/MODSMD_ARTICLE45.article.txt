# Rugby Team Back From Canada Trip
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Coach Chuck Taylor and his trav
eling squad of 20 ruggers, having
alternated rugby with relaxation for
five days, reurned from Vancouver
yesterday to resume their drive for
the league title.
Up north the Cards dropped two
games to the Canadians by 11 to 8
and 17 to 9 counts. The Indians al
most nipped the British Columbians
in the Thursday game, but an ap
parent Stanford score was called
back. It seems that John Banks
crossed the goal but failed to ground
the ball before he was tackled.
Saturday's game was much closer
than the score indicates. Each team
scored only one try, but penalty
kicks were the deciding factor as
ÃœBC made goocf on four while the
Cards were only able to split the
uprights on two occasions.
At any rate Stanford will have
another crack at the Canadians
when they journey south for a third
game in March. The ruggers are
still raving about the royal welcome
they received from our northern
neighbors;- Canadian hospitality in
cluded a personal greeting from the
Mayor of Vancouver and a souvenir
sweater for each member of the
squad.
The trip was costly as far as in
juries are concerned. Darrhl Den
toni, who has been a mainstay in
the front rank for four years, suf
fered a broken leg and will be out
for the season. Dentoni has been a
tower of strength in the scrum and
will be a hard man to replace. Bob
Oswald reinjured his hip. but should
be in shape for the weekend games,
and Vance Sheffey has recovered
from a face injury and should be
able to go 80 minutes again at the
fullback slot.
This weekend the Stanford rug
gers will face two stiff tests on suc
cessive days. On Friday they meet
UCLA and the following day the
University Club. Both games will
be played on the local field.
