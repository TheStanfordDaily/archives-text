## 
### 
Stanford's home - bound junior
varsity ruggers scored the Farm's
only rugby victory of the weekend
Saturday as they tagged a brand
new Menlo Ramblers fifteen, .8 to (>,
on the local rugby field.
The half-time score of the-con
test was 3 to 0. Stanford, on the
grace of wingman Blondy Broome's
dash for a try. Front-ranker Harv
Doron's try-for-point bounced off
the cross bar for no score.
In the second half the Ramblers
came back strong and tied up the
contest. A penalty-kick was award
ed the Men'.os and was blocked by
lock Dick Abraham. Since this is
strictly illegal, the three points were
awarded to the Ramblers. â€¢
