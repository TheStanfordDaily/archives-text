# 'Yankee' Cast Rehearsals Fill Museum
## 
### 
Chorus girls have invaded the
Stanford Museum!
The Museum, closed to the pub
i lie for several years, has traded its
! serenity for the hum and bustle of a
j Broadway stage.
This sanctuary of meditating his
torians has, opened its doors to the
cast of "Connecticut Yankee," the
Rodgers and Hart musical comedy
which will be presented at Staniord
March 9, 10, and 11.
Rehearsals for the production arc
: being held at various spots on cam
pus while the main stage ot the
Memorial Auditorium is being used
for the Ram's Head One-Acts.
The "Connecticut Yankee" chorus
| has been working mainly in the
I Museum, and dance rehearsals are
being held in the main entrance
| hall.
For the last week the statue of j
the Stanford family has looked i
down on 12 girls practicing Ye Okie
English version of the Samba. The
Stanfords seem to enjoy it all. At
least no complaints have been heard j
from the statue as yet.
The Stanford Players rehearsing j
the comedy have had to rely on j
their imaginations and the Mu- j
! seum's exhibits to provide stage
settings.
Next week the entire production j
will assemble on the main stage of
the auditorium for final rehearsals, j
The Stanford Players' box office
number has been changed. The new
number is DA 3-0665.
