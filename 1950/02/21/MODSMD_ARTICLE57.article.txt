# Spring Brings Poison Oak to Campus Area
## 
### 
Spring is hero, and Stnnlord .stu
dents will soon be aware that poison
o;ik is here too.
From now on the plant will be
growing abundantly in many places
around campus, especially in shaded
areas where other shrubs arc to be
fpund. Lake Lagunita, the golf
course, the stadium, and also the
stream at Rossotti's are likely spots
i for the growth of poison oak.
It can be recognized generally by
I its resemblance to the common oak
| ieaf, although it appears in the form
| of many small leaflets which make
j up a cluster, or compound leaf. In
I the spring it produces a small
| greenish-white flower, which will
I be noticeable a few weeks from
| now. Poison oak is easily distin
guished in the fall by its bright rod
leaves; it does not survive during
the winter.
A person may be affected by poi
| son oak through direct contact with
j the leaflets, or by being exposed to
I smoke particles when the plant is
i burned. Sometimes, but not often,
| people are susceptible to its pollen
I grains.
A variety of poison oak specimens
preserved in plastic is on display in
the main waiting room at the Health
| Service.
