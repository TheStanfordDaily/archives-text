# Pre-Excom Airs Salary, Code Issues
## Majority Against Pay for Officers 
### 
Campus opinion was focused
on two problems of ASSU ad
ministration last night at the pre-
Excom meeting. Although no
decision was reached, a straw
vote was taken on the two is
sues:
1. Should the ASSU president
and vice - president receive sala
ries?
2. Should Honor Code violators
lie allowed to hold positions on
Mien's and Women's Councils?
Mill Kea, ofT-campus representa
tive, summed up the arguments for
giving salaries to student officers,
lie said the posts required addition
al expenditures not included on the
regular expense account.
He said many potential candidates
would he financially prevented from
holding the office because they
would have to ftivc up other jobs.
Prestige "Ample Pay"
Leonard Ely, ASSU president last
summer, said the prestige of office
was ample payment, and that no
monetary value could be placed on
the job. lie also feared the starting
of a "bad precedent which might
require salaries for other student
officers such as Rally Com and Car
dinals."
The proposed change would not
go into effect until next fall.
In the straw vote, 2 voted for
the salary proposal, 10 voted against
it, and 2 abstained.
Kxeom decide'l to discuss the pos-

sbiility of placing the proposal on
the student body ballot at a later
date.
Opens Question
Do tit i Wells, head of. the Honor
Code Standing Committee, opened
the second question before Excom,
saying, "Any Honor Code violator
is a moral weakling and is not the
type for a Council or Honor Code
Committee position."
Derek Bok, junior class represen
tative, explained that allowing a
Code violator on the Council would
lower the respect which students
would have toward student govcrn
mcn t.
"The Honor Code is to build char
acter," was the reply of Kim Fletch
er, present chairman of Men's
Council. He felt that most of the
cases were derived from a mere
"moral lapse" of the student rather
than a "moral weakness."
Damage to C haracter
He said that by refusing the vio
lator the right to serve in a student
office, damage would be 'lone to his
character.
Hank Grandin, graduate repre
sentative, said that the candidate's
desire to run for a Council post in
dicated his desire to prove to the
campus community and to himself
his ability to uphold the Code.
Jack Little, Daily editor, empha
sized the danger is not in giving
one Council member the right to
penalize another Code violator, but
in the possible influence lie might
have on future violators' minds re
garding the Honor Code.
Repeat Performance
He pointed to facts which show
that one-time Code breakers have
repealed their acts showing that
even though the violator might run
for the office with a clean slate, he
could be morally weak.
ASSU President Hank Rosin as
serted that if the student can't fol
low the one rule which the students
have instituted themselves, he
should not be given the privilege of
holding a Council position.
The straw vote showed 7 in favor
of barring the violator from holding
the Council position, 1 against, and
I abstaining.
