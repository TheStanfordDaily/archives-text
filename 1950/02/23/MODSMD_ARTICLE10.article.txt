# Chaparral Price Upped To 30 Cents
## 
### 
The price of the Stanford Chapar
ral has been boosted five cents, ef
fective with the next (March) issue.
The subscription cost will go up
from $2 to $2.40.
Increased costs of publication and
decreased revenue from advertising
have forced the Hammer and Coffin
Society to raise the price of 25 cents
per issue, maintained for 10 years in
the face of post-war cost increases,
to .'5O cents, in order to keep up the
quality of the magazine and con
tinue to operate in the black.
Hammer and Coffin's action was
ratified by Publications Council and
Excom in its meeting Tuesday af
ternoon approved the Pub Com
ratification by a vote of eight to
none, with Hank Grandin and Grge
Bemis abstaining.
Skyrocketing Costs
Printing costs are one of the two
biggest factors forcing Chappie to
raise its price. From 1946-47 to
1047-48 costs went up 10 per cent;
in 1948-45) they increased another 10
per cent; this year's boost, by the
end of June, is expected to amount,
to 15 per cent.
Economy measures taken by the
Chappie so far this year have
brought, down the printing bill
nearly a hundred dollars, explained
John Mothcral, the magazine's edi
tor, but more drastic economy
would impair the quality of the
magazine.
Advertising Drop
Chappie advertising has decreased
six per cent already. But next year
is the time when the Chappies ex
pect to see a real drop in advertis
ing—an estimated 12 to 15 per cent
decrease. Contract advertisers, to
whom Stanford advertising is not
strictly necessary, are expected to
cut their nine- and five-month ac
counts considerably.
Advertising has to cover the dif
ference between the sale price of the
Chaparral and the production cost,
which with the latest cost increase
is about 37 cents a copy. To date it
has barely covered this difference;
for the rest of the year the staff ex
pects to lose two or three cents on
each copy they sell.
Loss Inevitable
An increase in circulation would
not offset this loss, since additional
copies cost just as much to print per
copy as the first 4,100 (the average
press run). The cost of paper, ink,
and man-hours offsets the theoreti
cal decrease in fixed cost that usu
ally accompanies greater produc
tion. '
In other words, if the Chappies
print and sell extra copies, they will
still lose Iwo or three cents on each
copy, and if the copies don't sell,
they lose 37 cents.
"Although the Chaparral is a
campus activity, ii is privately
owned and operated," Mothcral con
cluded. "The Hammer and Coffin
Society's profit motive is reasonable;
it can't operate in the red, and since
it is a private business, it can re
ceive no subsidies from the ASSU."

Advertising Drop
Chappie advertising has decreased
six per cent already. But next year
is the time when the Chappies ex
pect to see a real drop in advertis
ing—an estimated 12 to 15 per cent
decrease. Contract advertisers, to
whom Stanford advertising is not
strictly necessary, are expected to
cut their nine- and five-month ac
counts considerably.
Advertising has to cover the dif
ference between the sale price of the
Chaparral and the production cost,
which with the latest cost increase
is about 37 cents a copy. To date it
has barely covered this difference;
for the rest of the year the staff ex
pects to lose two or three cents on
each copy they sell.
Loss Inevitable
An increase in circulation would
not offset this loss, since additional
copies cost just as much to print per
copy as the first 4,100 (the average
press run). The cost of paper, ink,
and man-hours offsets the theoreti
cal decrease in fixed cost that usu
ally accompanies greater produc
tion. '
In other words, if the Chappies
print and sell extra copies, they will
still lose Iwo or three cents on each
copy, and if the copies don't sell,
they lose 37 cents.
"Although the Chaparral is a
campus activity, ii is privately
owned and operated," Mothcral con
cluded. "The Hammer and Coffin
Society's profit motive is reasonable;
it can't operate in the red, and since
it is a private business, it can re
ceive no subsidies from the ASSU."
The price of the Stanford Chapar
ral has been boosted five cents, ef
fective with the next (March) issue.
The subscription cost will go up
from $2 to $2.40.
Increased costs of publication and
decreased revenue from advertising
have forced the Hammer and Coffin
Society to raise the price of 25 cents
per issue, maintained for 10 years in
the face of post-war cost increases,
to .'5O cents, in order to keep up the
quality of the magazine and con
tinue to operate in the black.
Hammer and Coffin's action was
ratified by Publications Council and
Excom in its meeting Tuesday af
ternoon approved the Pub Com
ratification by a vote of eight to
none, with Hank Grandin and Grge
Bemis abstaining.
Skyrocketing Costs
Printing costs are one of the two
biggest factors forcing Chappie to
raise its price. From 1946-47 to
1047-48 costs went up 10 per cent;
in 1948-45) they increased another 10
per cent; this year's boost, by the
end of June, is expected to amount,
to 15 per cent.
Economy measures taken by the
Chappie so far this year have
brought, down the printing bill
nearly a hundred dollars, explained
John Mothcral, the magazine's edi
tor, but more drastic economy
would impair the quality of the
magazine.
