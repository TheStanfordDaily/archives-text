ALEXANDRIA, Va., Fob. 22 (/P)—
Piesidcnt Truman said today the
United States stands ready to use
force, if necessary, in its struggle
against Communism.
Covering a wide range of topics
in his 2,200-word address, Mr. Tru
man made these major points:
1. "We in the United States arc
doing and will continue to do all
that lies within our power to pre
vent the horror of another war."
2. "We are working for the reduc
tion of armaments and the control
of weapons of mass destruction."
Hut —the United States will not
accept any "sham agreement" that
docs not include a "workable in
ternational system" for control of
atomic weapons.
