### 
College students, growing up in an
age of anxiety, are turning more and
more to religious worship in chapels
at colleges throughout the country.
And on their part, the colleges
and universities are offering a great
deal more in religious instruction,
according to Dr. Charles Gilkey,
former dean of the University of
Chicago chapel, who is visiting
Stanford.
Dr. Gilkey has been speaking be
fore campus living groups, discuss
ing religious problems wjth the stu
dents. He spoke at the Tuesday
Evening Series, and Sunday will de
liver a sermon, "New Grain Out of
Old," in Memorial Church.
Dr. Gilkey described on Tuesday
his experiences with students in re
ligion at Chicago, Cornell, Harvard,
and Syracuse. He said that he found
students moving to the right on the
ological issues despite their tend
ency to the left on social issues.
These students need the reassur
ance of definite beliefs, he said.
To satisfy the students' need for
religious study, Dr. Gilkey suggest
ed a balanced program on campus of
curriculum, chapel work, and or
ganized religious activity.
Dr. Gilkey said he found consid
erably more religious interest at
Harvard when he returned as visit
ing chaplain than when he went
there in his undergraduate days.
