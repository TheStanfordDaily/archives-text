# Britons at Polls Today For Decisive Election
## Record Turnout Expected; Liberals Offer Labor Parliamentary Support 
### 
LONDON, Thursday, Feb., 23
:AP) —Britain's 34,000,000 voters
came today to their time of de
cision— whether to expand or
contract the growth of Socialism
in their nation.
A few hours before the polls
opened the Liberal Party announced
it would be willing to support the
Labor Party in the new Parliament
if the Laborites halt all nationaliza
tion of British industry for the next
five years, including the key iron and
steel industry.
The Liberal position was not en
tirely clear to political observers
since the party's statement did not
mention coalition. It did not am
plify what was meant by the word
"support."
Perhaps significantly, the state
ment made no mention of a possible
Liberal - Conservative combination.
The Lafcorites have declared re
peatedly they would not take part in
a government based on a combina
tion of parties.
Coalition Possible
Political writers have speculated
that neither the Laborites nor the
Conservatives may obtain a working
majority in the House of Commons
as a result of today's balloting. A
coalition is one possible way out of
such a stalemate.
Generally favorable weather is ex
pected to draw a record-breaking
outpouring of the electorate. They
begin making their choices in cur
tained polling booths throughout
England, Scotland, Wales, and North
ern Ireland at 7 a.m. (11 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time). By 9 p.m.—l 4 hours
later—their verdict will have been
recorded.
This is Britain's first general Par
liamentary election since the Socialist
Labor Party of Prime Minister Clem
ent Attlee swept to power July 5,
1945.
Close Race Predicted
A close race between the Laborites
and their major opponents—the Con
servatives—is forecast by most po
litical observers.
For the past three weeks, candi
dates of various parties have been
campaigning in the hamlets and
great cities of the nation. In their
pleas for support, the candidate* have
described the balloting as a time of
fateful decision.
The balloting specifically will be
for members of the new 625-seat
House of Commons, whose majority
will form the new government. The
old House was dominated by Labor
almost five years. The Labor Party
had 390 members at the dissolution
of the old Parliament by King George
VI February 3. The Conservatives,
Labor's major opposition, had 201.
But the choice of a winner appears
to fall clearly between the Labor
government and the Conservatives,
led by wartime Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill. The Liberal third
party, however, is making a deter
mined bid to improve its old show
ing of 10 seats.
