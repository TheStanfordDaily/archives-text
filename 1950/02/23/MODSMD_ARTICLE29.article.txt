# Now That Chappie Price
## 
### 
The boost in selling price of the Chaparral
coraee as no surprise to those of us familiar
with the current cost problems facing publica
tions, particuiarly college publications.
The reasons for the price-boost are sound.
The amount of advertising placed in publica
tions by all types of businesses has decreased
steadily since the war. Printing costs have in
creased.
Chaparral's chief source of income, like most
such publications, is advertising. When this
sourc« fails to meet the need, another must be
found.
Tb« price of the Chaparral has remained at
25 c«jnts since 1940, a 10-year high-cost period.
Ever* possible source of revenue, 3hort of
raislrii} the price, has been investigated.

Economy measures in the production of the
magazine have been pushed to the point where
any further cost-saving device would be re
flected in a marked lowering of the quality of
the magazine.
Proposals to sell the Chaparral off-campus,
to print more copies, or to use back funds
(which can be used only for a new Chaparral
building and are unavailable for any other pur
pose) would have proven impracticable.
To make a long story short, if we are to con
tinue enjoying a quality humor magazine at
Stanford, \ve must spend an extra nickel every
month.
For the jests and gibes of the Old Boy, it's a
bargain at any price.
