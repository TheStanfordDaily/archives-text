# YWCA Student Workshop
## 
### 
A great deal of favorable response to the
YWCA's Student Workshop last weekend has
been voiced by students who attended the two
day session.
Six Workshop discussion groups formulated
several constructive ideas and recommenda
tions on various campus activities. While there
was not time for all the ideas to be considered
in the Saturday afternoon plenary session, they
were nevertheless put on the record for future
consideration.
Probably the best suggestion was for an inter
club forum, composed of representatives from

each organization on campus. This forum
might meet as often as once a month to per
petuate the woik of the "Y" Workshop.
The function of the forum would be as a co
ordinating agency for the various campus ac
tivities. It could also become a nerve center
for student ideas and *an organization to spon
sor measures to streamline student government
and activities. The possibilities are boundless.
The Daily takes its hat off to the "Y" for spon
soring the Workshop and to the many students
whose interest made the conference a success
ful one.—A.M.
