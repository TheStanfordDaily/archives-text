# Brittan to Play For Frosh 'Twins'
## 
### 
Eneina Hall will be "Seein' Double"
Saturday night when it sponsors its
winter quarter freshman dance in the
lounge from 9 to 1. Bob Brittan and
his 11-piece orchestra will provide
tlu' music.
Couples must conform with the
theme by dressing as much alike as
possible. Sweaters and sport shirts
will be permitted. The two best
dressed couples will receive prizes.
Tickets for the Twin dance are
available from wing social chairmen.
Refreshments will be served at the
dance, and a program will be pre
sented midway through the affair.
In charge of the entertainment are
Bill Clark and Dixon Young. Clark
is also arranging for patrons, and
Young is collaborating with Bob
Lit fin on ticket sales. Littin's other
duty is the policing.
