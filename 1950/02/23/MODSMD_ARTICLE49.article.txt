## 
### 
The St. Louis Browns Rookies re
versed an earlier decision by down
ing the Stanford baseball club, 9 to 7,
in the Sunken Diamond Tuesday
afternoon in a poorly played ball
Each team picked up four un
earned runs as the Indians com
mitted three errors and the Rookies
booted five.
Starting chucker for the Cards,
Frank Hamilton, started like a house
afire, striking out the first three men
to face him. In the second inning he
again faced only three men, as the
Card infield came up with a double
play to erase an earlier error.
Third Inning Trouble
In the third frame, Hamilton had
trouble finding the plate as he walked
four batters, allowed two hits, and
hit a batter with a pitched ball to
give the Rookies five runs before Jim
Claypool came in to stem the tide.
The Indians came back in their
half of the third as Tom Shaw led off
with a single into left field, followed
by walks to Bill Herron and Bruce
Cameron. John Claypool blasted a
ground ball at the second baseman,
who flipped to the shortstop, for one.
but Bruce Cameron, sliding into sec
cond, brokp up the attempted duoble
play to allow Shaw to come across
withe first Card run.
Bud Klein was hit by a pitched ball
to load the bases, and Dave Melton
drove a ball into left field to score
Herron and Claypool. Klein scored
from third, when the Rookies tried
to pick him off and threw the ball
away. Charlie Cole Hied out to right
field to end the inning.
Indians Tie Up Game
The Indians tied up the ball game
at five-all in the fourth inning, when
Tom Shaw was safe on an infield
single and scored when the Rookies
tried to pick him off first base, but
only succeeded in throwing the ball
all over the Sunken Diamond.
The Rookies again went ahead in
the fifth frame, when they scored
four unearned runs.
Don Bluxom came in to work the
last three frames for the Rookies,
and didn't allow a man on the base
paths as he struck out five of the
nine men to face him.
