# Mine Seizure Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON —Two days before
the government really begins crack
ing the contempt of court whip over
striking coal miners, a move started
in Congress today for federal seiz
ure of the pits on terms the miners
like.
The proposal, sparked by Chair
man Lesinski (D„ Mich.) of the
House Labor Committee, is to give
President Truman power to take
over the mines, with any profits
from operations under seizure going
to the federal treasury. That would
tend to put pressure on the opera
tors. In past seizures, the profits
have gone to the owners.
