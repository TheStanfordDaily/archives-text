# Card Cagers' Last Chance
## 
### 
Stanford's last - chance cagers,
with only one shot left in their six- |
gun, will be heading for that last
roundup this weekend against the
win-'em-all Trojans and.Bruins.
Both L.A. clubs have set new con
secutive win streaks against the
Cards already this season, and will ,
be heavy money favorites to pick ;
up clean sweeps of the four-game |
series.
Sam Barry's Trojans, the Friday
night entrant this trip, have already
won two straight clean sweeps from .
Everett Dean, and although George
Yardley has been offering stubborn
resistance, they are calmly consid
ering their third. (Last week's 62-
59 win in the Pan gave them 11 in
a row and erased a 16-year-old rec
ord set in 1934.)
John Wooden's Bruins have also
been setting records at Everett |
Dean's expense. UCLA only needed j
6 to top their previous best of 4, put j
together in the war year of 1946. 1
Saturday night UCLA will be shoot- 1
ing for its first legitimate four-game j
sweep over the Indians.
