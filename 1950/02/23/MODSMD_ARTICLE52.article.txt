# Indian Grapplers Lose To Bears in Close Meet
## 
### 
Victories in three weight classes j
for the Stanford wrestling team
weren't enough Tuesday night in
Enema Gym as the Berkeley Bears j
took the second and final "Big j
Meet" of the season 15 to 11. The ;
Cal squad, which had swamped the j
Cards in the season's opener, 23 to
5, barely held the margin of victory
in these matches.
Sinilin' Steve Gar.st, Stanford's
consistently winning heavyweight
ran his collegiate competition suc
cess streak for this season to six
straight. In 1:45 of the first period
Gars got a take-down on 24U-pound
Jack McFarlane and immediately
pinned the hapless Bear.
Dick Esbenshade, 121 lbs., and
Captain Don Williams, at 136 lbs.,
were Stanford's only other winners.
Another decision in favor of the
Cards would have given them the
meet.
Williams decisioned Bill Hart 4 to
0 in a match that was scoreless for
the first two periods. In the final
period Stanford's captain got a re
verse and was awarded two addi
tional points for top time.

Esbenshade decisioned the son of

the Cal coach, Henry Stone Jr., 4
to 1.

matches might have reversed the
result of the meet. Among these
were Dick Cruce's 128 - lb. battle
with Edwin Lee and Niles Severin's
155-lb. tussle with Bob Walkup.
After an excellent first - period
take-down, Cruce seemed to have
Lee under control until the Cal
man worked out late in the match
to get a reverse and near fall.
After a scoreless first period,
Walkup escaped from Severin to
garner one point. The Berkeleyite
was also given points for top time in
this close match.

Victories in three weight classes j
for the Stanford wrestling team
weren't enough Tuesday night in
Enema Gym as the Berkeley Bears j
took the second and final "Big j
Meet" of the season 15 to 11. The ;
Cal squad, which had swamped the j
Cards in the season's opener, 23 to
5, barely held the margin of victory
in these matches.
Sinilin' Steve Gar.st, Stanford's
consistently winning heavyweight
ran his collegiate competition suc
cess streak for this season to six
straight. In 1:45 of the first period
Gars got a take-down on 24U-pound
Jack McFarlane and immediately
pinned the hapless Bear.
Dick Esbenshade, 121 lbs., and
Captain Don Williams, at 136 lbs.,
were Stanford's only other winners.
Another decision in favor of the
Cards would have given them the
meet.
Williams decisioned Bill Hart 4 to
0 in a match that was scoreless for
the first two periods. In the final
period Stanford's captain got a re
verse and was awarded two addi
tional points for top time.
In another well - wrestled match
Esbenshade decisioned the son of

the Cal coach, Henry Stone Jr., 4
to 1.
Wins for Stanford in other close
matches might have reversed the
result of the meet. Among these
were Dick Cruce's 128 - lb. battle
with Edwin Lee and Niles Severin's
155-lb. tussle with Bob Walkup.
After an excellent first - period
take-down, Cruce seemed to have
Lee under control until the Cal
man worked out late in the match
to get a reverse and near fall.
After a scoreless first period,
Walkup escaped from Severin to
garner one point. The Berkeleyite
was also given points for top time in
this close match.
In the 145-lb. division Rollin Rose
of Stanford lost to experienced Joe
McKim by a decision in a match
that was cautiously wrestled by
Rose.
i Bob Harmon, 165 lbs., was deci
, sioned by Cal's Frank Barney, and
175 - pounder Dick DeWitt lost a
j close decision to Bentley Lyon of
Cal in their featured return battle,
j In a 175 - lb. exhibition match,
I Stanford's Bruce Gait pinned Kent
Stow of California in 55 seconds of
| the second period.
