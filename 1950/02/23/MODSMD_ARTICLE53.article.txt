# Eddie Le Baron Signs With Redskins
## 
### 
Eddie Leßaron, three-time All-America quarterback, today inked a
Washington Redskin contract for the coming pro football season. Leßaron
was the 122 nd choice in the National-American League draft, because many
coaches have said that he's too small to make the grade with the play-for
pay giants, but that isn't the way Eddie sees it.
He weighs 172 pounds, and is is only five feet eight and three-quarter
inches tall, but—"lt's never bothered me yet," said Eddie.
