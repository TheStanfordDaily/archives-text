# Shakespearean Comedy At Geary Is Uproarious
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
A whiz-bang production of Shake
speare's "The Taming of the Shrew"'
is this week treading the boards (as
they say) of the Geary Theater in
San Francisco. Alternate nights
feature a modern dress version of
"Julius Caesar."
Produced by the Margaret Webster
Shakespeare Co., "The Taming of the
Shrew" presents the mayhemous
courtship of Petruchio and Katherina
in a utilitous and undistracting set
designed by Ben Edwards. Likewise,
the script is generally true to the
original, and obvious endeavor has
been made to recapture the simplicity
and dramatic make-believe of the
Elizabethan stage.
Innovations begin with the cos
tumes, which are of the Victorian
period and include only such other
outrageous period props as will un
derline the nature of farce.
For farce it is, and the adaptation,
despite advertising to the contrary,
is more or less a modern one.
All in all it's a fascinating produc
tion and is cleverly gauged for the
multitudes of people as Shakespeare
undoubtedly intended. The differ
ence lies in 350 years of language
evolution. Most of the rich word
bandyings (exclusive of puns) which
brought guffaws and rough rib-jabs
from the pit in Shakespeare's day,
would now fall flat on the face of
etymological change.
Wisely, Miss Webster has skimmed
the cream of Shakespeare's abundant
lines and timeless situations and ig
nored any truck with the rest. She
has jazzed up the production with
burlesque not far removed from the
stage of Minsky's and comes up, con
sequently, with a fast and funny-as
hell performance on which the Bard
himself would be the last to frown.
The result is an expanded produc
tion in which the ardent and hilarious

slugging (superbly staged) of Petru
chio (Kendall Clark) and Katherina
(Louisa Horton) is only one of sev
eral harvests of humor. Larry Gates
as a supremely vulgar Christopher
Sly and a rich, competent Grumio by
Dion Allen are other examples.
One wonders, but not deeply
enough to stop chuckling, if the limits
of free farce were not a little more
rigid on the stage of the Globe Thea
ter. All such wool-gathering is dis
missed, however, in the slaverous an
ticipation of the direction from
which the company will leap into
the next wcll-remembercd situation.
The fault of the players' enthusiasm
lies only in a tendency to expend
their shrieks arriving at
their climaxes frequently with noth
ing left but a hoarse croak.
But if you'd like to enjoy an eve
ning of Shakespeare's best comedy,
presented as it hasn't been seen since
good King Charlie lost his head, drop
in at the Geary Theater tonight or
Saturday night. Curtain time is 8:30.

—The fiery "shrew"
A whiz-bang production of Shake
speare's "The Taming of the Shrew"'
is this week treading the boards (as
they say) of the Geary Theater in
San Francisco. Alternate nights
feature a modern dress version of
"Julius Caesar."
Produced by the Margaret Webster
Shakespeare Co., "The Taming of the
Shrew" presents the mayhemous
courtship of Petruchio and Katherina
in a utilitous and undistracting set
designed by Ben Edwards. Likewise,
the script is generally true to the
original, and obvious endeavor has
been made to recapture the simplicity
and dramatic make-believe of the
Elizabethan stage.
Innovations begin with the cos
tumes, which are of the Victorian
period and include only such other
outrageous period props as will un
derline the nature of farce.
For farce it is, and the adaptation,
despite advertising to the contrary,
is more or less a modern one.
All in all it's a fascinating produc
tion and is cleverly gauged for the
multitudes of people as Shakespeare
undoubtedly intended. The differ
ence lies in 350 years of language
evolution. Most of the rich word
bandyings (exclusive of puns) which
brought guffaws and rough rib-jabs
from the pit in Shakespeare's day,
would now fall flat on the face of
etymological change.
Wisely, Miss Webster has skimmed
the cream of Shakespeare's abundant
lines and timeless situations and ig
nored any truck with the rest. She
has jazzed up the production with
burlesque not far removed from the
stage of Minsky's and comes up, con
sequently, with a fast and funny-as
hell performance on which the Bard
himself would be the last to frown.
The result is an expanded produc
tion in which the ardent and hilarious

slugging (superbly staged) of Petru
chio (Kendall Clark) and Katherina
(Louisa Horton) is only one of sev
eral harvests of humor. Larry Gates
as a supremely vulgar Christopher
Sly and a rich, competent Grumio by
Dion Allen are other examples.
One wonders, but not deeply
enough to stop chuckling, if the limits
of free farce were not a little more
rigid on the stage of the Globe Thea
ter. All such wool-gathering is dis
missed, however, in the slaverous an
ticipation of the direction from
which the company will leap into
the next wcll-remembercd situation.
The fault of the players' enthusiasm
lies only in a tendency to expend
their shrieks arriving at
their climaxes frequently with noth
ing left but a hoarse croak.
But if you'd like to enjoy an eve
ning of Shakespeare's best comedy,
presented as it hasn't been seen since
good King Charlie lost his head, drop
in at the Geary Theater tonight or
Saturday night. Curtain time is 8:30.
