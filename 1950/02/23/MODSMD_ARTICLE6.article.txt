# Cyclotron Burns
## 
### 
PItINCKTON. N.J. â€” An 18,000,-
000 - volt cyclotron which helped
make the atom bomb was virtually
destroyed by an oil fire today.
The cause of the smoky, stubborn
fire inside Princeton University's
$400,000 atom - smashing machine
could not immediately be deter
mined. Dr. Milton White, professor
of physics, said only the magnets
could be salvaged.
