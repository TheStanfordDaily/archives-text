# WHAT, AGAIN?
## Third Leak In Pipelines 
### 
The pipes are leaking again.
For the third time in 12 days, a
Stanford water pipe has broken, this
time on SalvatietTa street a few hun
dred feet from the SAF, House.
However, this newest flow of water,
which occurred on Wednesday, is just
a pint-sized replica of the last two
breaks. A one-inch pipe in the do
mestic water supply system cracked
and sent water filtering to the pave
ment surface.
Corporation Yard employees dug to
the source and men from the Univer
sity Plumbing Shop temporarily
patched the line. Yesterday Joe Vas
coneelos and Joo C. Mello, from the
Corporation Yard, were excavating
still deeper so the plumbers could re
place a length of pipe. Repairs
should be completed today, they said.
The first of the Stanford geyser
series was the most spectacular. On
February 10 a large main hurst at
Serra and Galvez streets, by Encina
Hall, and hurled dirty water and
pavement more than 50 feet into the
sky.
Then on Monday a 12-inch main
bringing water from Searsville Lake
opened up beneath Foothill boule
vard causing a 20-foot-long road
cave-in. The break proved to he a
crack seven feet long in a 12-inch
main. Plumbers replaced the length
of pipe and yesterday only a few
inches of asphalt remained to be laid.
Carroll Blacker, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, isn't, worried.
"This ought to be the end," he said
yesterday. "They tell me that things
always come in groups of three."
