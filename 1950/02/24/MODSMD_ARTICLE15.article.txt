# 'Tartar' Is Named Best Of One-Acts
## Near-Capacity Crowd at Debut 
### 
The Ram's Head One-Act
Plays opened last night to a
near-capacity audience. The
repertoire included an amusing
farce on the dilemmas of a pair
of young lawyers, a rather me
diocre piece on the glories of
the Marine tradition, and a very
entertaining comedy on an ec
centric young playwright and
the characters he collects.
"The First Hundred Days" con
cerns two young law graduates who
have written 15,000 letters to locate
a town of 28.000 with only one at
torney. The hitch comes when they
discover the population is entirely
Quaker and don't believe in taking
legal action against each other. Dick
Jones is very good as the ambulance
chasing member of the duo who tries
to stir up a little business by some
what unethical means.
In "The Scarlet and the Gold.'' Bill
Oyler gives a convincing perform
ance as the hardboiled sergeant who
tries to instill his rather spineless
younger brother with a proper re
spect for the glorious old Marine tra
dition and make a man of him. 'Pie
dialogue is convincing and the char
acterization is pretty good, but the
plot is weak, and the action fre
quently drags. The play occasionally
borders on sentimental melodrama.
"Scratch a Tartar" is by far the
best of the three. It is a well-writ
ten, entertaining play, and above Ihe
general college level. The perform
ances of several of the characters
combine to make it, a very sparkling
bit of humor.
Jack Minkoff is the highly erratic
Russian playwright who surrounds
himself with colorful characters for
inspiration. Ned Hutchinson does a
wonderful job as the punch-drunk
fighter, and Ethel Dapprich slinks
convincingly across the stage as the
notorious "Sally Stanvard." One of
the best characterizations is done by
Bob Scothern who plays the loved,
gum - chewing sports writer. â€” Jan
