I on two major Stanford publications
besides The Daily. The two, the
1 Quad, Stanford yearbook, and the
j Chaparral, Stanford humor maga
] zinc, are directed and staffed as an
j extra-curricular activity of inter
j ested students.
The Quad is published once a year,
i in June, but work on this 500-or-so

| pages goes on during fall, winter, and
I spring quarters at the Quad Shack
| across the street from the University
j Press.
Winter Deadlines
There is no set try on I. time for
| Quad staff positions. New faces are
i welcome any time, but, according to
Editor Bill Larmer, help is needed
especially now during winter quarter
when most production deadlines must
he met. Promotions and new staff ap
pointments arc made in the spring
and include the selection of five jun
ior editors from the (op freshman
and sophomore staff members.
I.ike The Daily, the Quad is di
vided into three departments edi
torial, business, and photography.
Most of the work in the first de
partment consists of organizing,
rather than actually writing copy.
Chief jobs are .scheduling pictures,
pasting up pages, alphabetizing, and
typing.
There is a I so an opportunity to earn i
money; editorial department mem
bers, from the junior editors up, re
ceive a percentage of the Quad's
profits.
On the business side, under the
overall direction of the business
manager, the advertising manager
receives a salary of a month. Ilis
staff draws up sample ads and so
licits advertising for the yearbook
on a percentage basis for new adver
tising sold.
Circulation
Also under the business manager is
the circulation manager, who directs
the selling of Quads.
In the third department, the bead
photographer and his cameramen
| take pictures around campus and do
darkroom work. The Quad owns
tbred cameras and provides all
equipment for its staff photographers.
"Around back" from the Quad of
fice is hidden the cartoon-papered

sanctum of the* Chappie, haven of
the more unusual talent at Stanford.
Hie magazine's editorial depart
ment welcomes cartoonists, writers,
and idea men. The first can get in
formation on Chaparral require
ments from either John Murray or
Stan Norton at the office; the second
are invited to write regular columns
(similar to the present "Now That
Date" and "Now That Flick ) or
special stories and features; and in
spiration from the last group is gladly
received any time.
Chappie Sales
Business department work at the
Chappie includes selling ads at a 15
per cent commission or doing cleri
cal work. Positions for photogra
phers are also available.
Best time for newcomers to visit
the office is about 4 in the afternoon.
The Chaparral's set-up is some
what different from that of other
campus publications. Editor John
Motheral explains. It is owned and
operated by Hammer and Coffin.
Stanford humor society, and top
staff positions are open only to .so
ciety members.
Likewise, new society members ate
chosen on the basis of their Chappie
work. At present there are very
good chances for advancement for
men as there are not many freshmen
and sophomores to (ill the positions
which will Le vacated at the end of
the year.
"Positions of responsibility on the
staff arc open to anyone willing to
do the work," says Motheral. "Class
year is not necessarily a criterion for
holding office."
A few top spots are open to women,
(The Women's Auxiliary of Hammer
and Coffin fills the positions of wom
en's manager, exchange editor, and
occasionally others), but the big need
now is for men to work up on the
staff.
