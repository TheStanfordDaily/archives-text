# Last Chance -- Cagers Face Troy, Bruin Jinx
## League Leaders Invade Pavilion This Weekend 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Bruins and the Trojans,
the one two punch of the 1950
Southern Division hoop war,
will make their final appear
ance of the season in the Pa
vilion this weekend against
Stanford's down-but-not-out bas
ketballing Indians.
The 16th in the nation Trojans, led
by All-American candidate Bill
Sharman, will be here tonight while
UCLA is battling it out with Cal over
in the Berkeley Gym. Tomorrow
night the two southern entries switch
floors and opponents with 7th ranked
UCLA here and USC at Cal. Game
time both nights will be 8:30.
It's now or never for the Indians
if they're going to break their losing
streaks to the Los Angeles melon
tossers and put a note of honor on
1 this year's record books.
The last time Stanford defeated a
Sam Barry-coached USC basketball
team was in 1947, and the Indians
haven't been able to get to the Bruins
5 since the beginning of last year.
| Since those victories the Trojans
have hung 11 straight KOs on Stan
ford, and UCLA has managed 6.
The Cards came close last weekend
as they stayed with both teams most
of the wav, but in the end lost to
1 USC 62 to 59. and to UCLA 69 to 59.
) Coach Everett Dean will pin his
j hopes for victory on the "new"
George Yardley, who has turned in
three sensational games in a row,
and on the point-making ability of
| Jim Walsh, the high-scoring sopho
j more forward who found himself
again last weekend.
Yardley has scored 26, 19, and 21
. points in his last three games, and


CAPTAIN GEORGE YARDLEY, the 6-foot 5-inch bomber from
Balboa, is set to go to fhe whip tonight as Stanford attempts to
break up USC's 11-game win streak. Yardley has pumped in
63 points against Troy in three games for 21 per try, he is sec
ond highest scorer in the Southern Division with 141 points,
and has outscored the Trojan sensation, Bill Sharman, in the last
three games. He'll open the game jumping center against Stan
Christie at 8:30. —Daily photo by Dave Rosenthal
lias been the outstanding man on the
floor each time. In the last two SC-
Stanford games the battling blond
has outdone the vaunted Sharman in
all departments, and with a little
help from his mates, might have
turned the tide of victory in favor of
the Indians.
Yard ley has been brilliant in nearly
every game that the Cards have
played this year, but the rest of the
squad hasn't shown any such con
sistency. Jim Walsh, Jim Kamstead,
and Jack O'Sullivan have shown
flashes of brilliance on and off all
season, but no two of them ever seem
to get hot on the same night.
Warren Starts
With Yardley and Kamstead con
trolling both backboards, and willi
the rest o( the team playing its best
ball for 40 solid minutes the Cards
could conceivably knock oil any
quintet on the Coast, but with the
season almost over Coach Dean is
still experimenting with the staitin;.*

nation.

The latest shift wiii probably find
Bill Warren, who last week did about
as good a deiensive job on Bill Shar
man as any of the Stanford* this year,
at the starting guard berth along with
footballer Harry Hugasian.
At center Jim Ramstead is expected
to get the call over veteran Ralph
Carver, and Yardley and Walsh will
go at forward.
Handy-Andy Jack O'Siillivan may
get the starting nod over either War

of varsity competition, must tally <>1
more in his remaining four contests
to eclipse Hank Luisetti's all-time
Southern Division season scoring

The Bruins and the Trojans,
the one two punch of the 1950
Southern Division hoop war,
will make their final appear
ance of the season in the Pa
vilion this weekend against
Stanford's down-but-not-out bas
ketballing Indians.
The 16th in the nation Trojans, led
by All-American candidate Bill
Sharman, will be here tonight while
UCLA is battling it out with Cal over
in the Berkeley Gym. Tomorrow
night the two southern entries switch
floors and opponents with 7th ranked
UCLA here and USC at Cal. Game
time both nights will be 8:30.
It's now or never for the Indians
if they're going to break their losing
streaks to the Los Angeles melon
tossers and put a note of honor on
1 this year's record books.
The last time Stanford defeated a
Sam Barry-coached USC basketball
team was in 1947, and the Indians
haven't been able to get to the Bruins
5 since the beginning of last year.
| Since those victories the Trojans
have hung 11 straight KOs on Stan
ford, and UCLA has managed 6.
The Cards came close last weekend
as they stayed with both teams most
of the wav, but in the end lost to
1 USC 62 to 59. and to UCLA 69 to 59.
) Coach Everett Dean will pin his
j hopes for victory on the "new"
George Yardley, who has turned in
three sensational games in a row,
and on the point-making ability of
| Jim Walsh, the high-scoring sopho
j more forward who found himself
again last weekend.
Yardley has scored 26, 19, and 21
. points in his last three games, and


CAPTAIN GEORGE YARDLEY, the 6-foot 5-inch bomber from
Balboa, is set to go to fhe whip tonight as Stanford attempts to
break up USC's 11-game win streak. Yardley has pumped in
63 points against Troy in three games for 21 per try, he is sec
ond highest scorer in the Southern Division with 141 points,
and has outscored the Trojan sensation, Bill Sharman, in the last
three games. He'll open the game jumping center against Stan
Christie at 8:30. —Daily photo by Dave Rosenthal
lias been the outstanding man on the
floor each time. In the last two SC-
Stanford games the battling blond
has outdone the vaunted Sharman in
all departments, and with a little
help from his mates, might have
turned the tide of victory in favor of
the Indians.
Yard ley has been brilliant in nearly
every game that the Cards have
played this year, but the rest of the
squad hasn't shown any such con
sistency. Jim Walsh, Jim Kamstead,
and Jack O'Sullivan have shown
flashes of brilliance on and off all
season, but no two of them ever seem
to get hot on the same night.
Warren Starts
With Yardley and Kamstead con
trolling both backboards, and willi
the rest o( the team playing its best
ball for 40 solid minutes the Cards
could conceivably knock oil any
quintet on the Coast, but with the
season almost over Coach Dean is
still experimenting with the staitin;.*
lineup trying to lind the light combi
nation.

The latest shift wiii probably find
Bill Warren, who last week did about
as good a deiensive job on Bill Shar
man as any of the Stanford* this year,
at the starting guard berth along with
footballer Harry Hugasian.
At center Jim Ramstead is expected
to get the call over veteran Ralph
Carver, and Yardley and Walsh will
go at forward.
Handy-Andy Jack O'Siillivan may
get the starting nod over either War
ren or Hugasian.
Needs til More
Highlights of this weekend will he
the final Bay Area college appear
ances of Shannan and UCLA's
George Stan ich, who are being
pushed by their respective schools
lor Ail-American honors.
Shannan, who has scored an even
1.000 points lor Troy in three years
of varsity competition, must tally <>1
more in his remaining four contests
to eclipse Hank Luisetti's all-time
Southern Division season scoring
mark of 2112. This is an average of
slightly better than 15 points per
contest which he must make—well
under his present season average of
21.5.
