# Last Chance -- Cagers Face Troy, Bruin Jinx
## League Leaders Invade Pavilion This Weekend 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Bruins and the Trojans,
the one two punch of the 1950
Southern Division hoop war,
will make their final appear
ance of the season in the Pa
vilion this weekend against
Stanford's down-but-not-out bas
ketballing Indians.
The 16th in the nation Trojans, led
by All-American candidate Bill
Sharman, will be here tonight while
UCLA is battling it out with Cal over
in the Berkeley Gym. Tomorrow
night the two southern entries switch
floors and opponents with 7th ranked
UCLA here and USC at Cal. Game
time both nights will be 8:30.
It's now or never for the Indians
if they're going to break their losing
streaks to the Los Angeles melon
tossers and put a note of honor on
1 this year's record books.
The last time Stanford defeated a
Sam Barry-coached USC basketball
team was in 1947, and the Indians
haven't been able to get to the Bruins
5 since the beginning of last year.
| Since those victories the Trojans
have hung 11 straight KOs on Stan
ford, and UCLA has managed 6.
The Cards came close last weekend
as they stayed with both teams most
of the wav, but in the end lost to
1 USC 62 to 59. and to UCLA 69 to 59.
) Coach Everett Dean will pin his
j hopes for victory on the "new"
George Yardley, who has turned in
three sensational games in a row,
and on the point-making ability of
| Jim Walsh, the high-scoring sopho
j more forward who found himself
again last weekend.
Yardley has scored 26, 19, and 21
. points in his last three games, and
