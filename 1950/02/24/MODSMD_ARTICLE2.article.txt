# Coal Strike Continues
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH Mass layoffs, coal
rationing, and mine picketing vio
lence spread through the nation to
day in the great soft coal strike of
372,000 miners.
Sixty - nine West Virginia coal |
pickets were indicted on charges of I
strike violence.
Best estimates are that more than j
10(1,000 workers in coal - dependent
industries will be laid ofT by the [
end of the week.
In Washington, contract talks
brought "absolutely no results" to
night despite earlier reports that
John L. Lewis and the operators had
edged closer together on money dif- \
ferences.
