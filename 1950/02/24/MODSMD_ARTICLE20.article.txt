# MOCK CASES INVOLVE MURDER, BRIBERY
## First-Year Moot Court Will Begin Trials Today 
### 
First-year Moot Court arguments
are now being heard in the new
courtroom on the third floor of the
Law School Building. They are
docketed for 4:15 and 7:15 p.m. to
day, Monday, Tuesday, and Wed
nesday.
Four problems have been as
signed for argument this quarter.
They are:
J. Defendant, was arrested on a
charge of felony, that of carrying a
blackjack. The arresting officer
merely asserted that the man looked
like the type who would carry one,
but had no other grounds for mak
ing the arrest. The only evidence
against the defendant was the offi
cer's testimony and the blackjack,
which was procured without a
search warrant, or an arrest war
rant. The issue is whether the trial
court correctly admitted to evidence
the officer's testimony and denied
the accused's motion to present evi
dence that the arrest was made il
legally. Defendant alleges that he
was t lie victim of an unconstitution
al search and seizure.
2. Defendant was convicted of
murder upon his own plea of guilty,
offering no plea of self-defense, but
offering expert testimony to show
that he was not responsible for his
acts due to "automatism,'' a condi
tion brought, on by slight provoca
tion of a constitutional psychopathic
inferior. A psychiatrist's testimony
to this effect was excluded by the
(rial court. The issue here is the ad
missibility of such evidence, where
a later trial on the basis of insanity
is provided for by law.

3. Defendant, a hotel owner, had
reason to suspect plaintiff, a roon'
clerk, of accepting bribes from hotel
patrons to get them rooms. He made
the clerk stay against his will in a
room for a whole day to answer
questions of store detectives. Th >
clerk was cleared by the owner, but
sued for and won a $1,000 judgmei '
for false imprisonment, saying that
he stayed only under threat of los
ing his job. The owner appeals, say -
ing that the trial court was in erroi
in concluding that the employee w;: .
involuntarily confined, and that a_.
owner, he had no privilege to con
fine the man.
4. Plaintiffs husband sent one of
the defendants to the ice
owned by the other defendant i >
get ice from a vending machine. He
then realized that the coins he gave
his friend were valuable 1873 qua'
ters. He drove to the ice house in
his car, but was killed in a smash -
up. His wife, heir to all his prop
erty, sued the ice company and the
friend who was sent to the vendir.:;
machine for the value of the coins,
and won. The defendants appe 1
the judgment, saying that the coin
were no longer the property of
plaintiff's husband at the time ol
his death.
