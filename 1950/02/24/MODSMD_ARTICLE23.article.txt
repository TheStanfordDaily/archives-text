# Two Epidemics This Year
## 
### 
Tor the second time within a yea/, two Stan
ford dormitories have been afflicted with ma
j<ir,epidemics. Both have ended almost as last
•; ihey started, but they were senous enough
t. leave many seats empty in classrooms.
J;ast May, 51 cases of intestinal flu were re
ported in Roble, Health Service authorities
pointed their finger at a respiratory virus
which had appeared in other population cen
terp of the3ay Area.
The cause of last week's epidemic, which
I it-an estimated 200 men in Encina and Toyon
is still a question mark.
Symptoms of Roble's virus infections lufit

the' sickness for almost a week. The quick dis
appearance of rases in Encina last weekend
indicates that the tiouble was probably not
from virus, but from some form of food poison

h'neina Dining Hall officials said the lGod
used Friday noon was taken fresh from the can
that morning, Although leftovers aie lefrig

ions, it is significant to note that the suspected
food was not.
ivlany do not realize that Stanford dining
hails have received high ratings from the state

health department which inspects the food and
food-handlers regularly.
During the war, private caterers operated
the kitchen at Encina Commons. Menus were
planned with the profit motive in mind, and
certain shortcuts were taken.
But today Encina is operated 011 a non-profit
basis. Wherever possible the trained dietician
orders the freshest food possible. Encina,
which feeds close to 900 men, can't possibly
serve the fancy dishes which the 250 women
at lioble get, but the food that is served is
clean and wholesome.
The one possible "leak in the line" may be
in the cleanliness of the student foodhandlers.
Although the rules call for personal cleanli
ness among the hashers, there are some who
fall short of the requirements.
It is important that all students realize their
part in the campus health program. Since the
epidemic often results from a respiratory virus
which centers in the intestinal tract, those
who become infected must eliminate unneces
sary personal contact.
The health authorities often need the co
operation of those who suffer from stomach
ailments in filling out reports. Almost 80 men
coopeiated last week by reporting then symp
toms.
It is for the benefit of all, that students, food
handlers, and health directors work to prevent
epidemics. —G.A.
