BV chance 1 got into a pretty deadly conversation
the .other day—the main topic being tombstones.
Now, there are several types of tombstones, tho.se
in journalism which refer to identical headlines being
placed side by side, and the one in Arizona a eitv of

rough and tough characters almost
uni'lar to the high school fee? of
Paid Alto
B\it the tombstones I'm talking
abotit simply are the good old
fashioned type that come in part
nerships with a 6x3 plot of ground.
1 don't know how the original
i ontersation got into such a
gloomy state—perhaps it was the
raising of Chaparral to 30 cents, or
maybe it was the fact that USC
ncl UCLA are back in town—but

..nyway we got around to discussing the effect death
had«on various people.
My friend started things off with a story on the mostl
• toic reaction to death he had ever heard about.
Old Lord Higgrnbotham was reading the London
Times in his club when a friend remarked "Under
stand you buried your wife this morning."
"Had to, old chap," drawled Lord Hig without look
ing up. # "She was dead, y'know "
Well, we buried that one as fast as we could and
moved into the main topic of comparing epitaphs per
vons had suggested for their own tombstones. A few
of the following will give you the idea. (Most of them
have been dreamed up by people still living).
HORACE BROWN (dentist): "Stranger, approach
lite bones with gravity, Doc Brown is filling his last
cavity."
HEDY LAMARR "This is too deep for me."

NUNNALLY JOHNSON: '"1 thought there was a
funny taste about that last one."
WYNNE GIBSON: "Down but not out."
CLIVE BROOK: "Excuse me for not rising."
WILLIAM HAINES: "Here's something 1 want to
gel off my chest."
H. C. WELLS: "I told you so, dammit."
W. C. FIELDS: "O'n the whole, I'd rather be in -Phila
delphia."
FONTAINE FOX: "I had a hunch something like
this would happen."
That about does it, except for my own two-bits
worth—-"Hah! Just one more time I'd like to see some
body tell me to DROP DEAD."

FRIDAY SPECIAL: Look out tonight for that over
due basketball upset. Stanford's Fire-red Five has
taken it on the button from USC 11 straight times.
Last Saturday in the Pan the Cards showed signs of
such a thing in mind, closed in on Troy to within
three points.
Tonight it could be different, and it probably will if
George Yardley continues his great play and gets
help from Jim Walsh, Jack O'Sullivan, and Bill War
ren, the other starters.
Bill Warren, who played two years with the JV's,
and didn't get a sniff Of varsity play until the middle
of this season, is starting his first game He gels the
assignment because of the good job he aid on wizard
Bill Sharman last week.
The rest of the club is set for this one. They figure
Sain Barry and his boys have gotten away with enough
wins to last 'em now for awhile.
So, like the chameleon said to his pal, tonight things
could be different.
