CHOOSING YOUR MAJOR
(Editor's Note.—Today's article, "So You're Going
t > Major in Drama, Eh?" is the sixth in a series of
' -says on "Choosing Your Major" by Dr. W. Bury
iuore Dailey, the eminent playwright, director, and
head-man of the Theatrical janitorial Workers, l>»-
< a) 107.)
Dr. Dailey is an exponent of the theory that to suc-

< < td in the theater, one must have
theatrical background. His
birthplace was a theater dressing
i <'jm. As a matter of fact, he was
I oin in a trunk. Five years later
h discovered his mot he i was an
• lephant.
He is perhaps best known in
'Irama circles for his work as a
I lnywright. His outstanding work
in this held has been accomplished
in the v/riting of sequels, or see-

<jnd stories, to successful plays. It is common know!-
< dge on Bioadway that Dailey is one of the best "sec
' <iid story men" in the business.
Seven of Dj, Dailey's greatest plays have won the
IVw-litzei Prize for Dramatic Achievement These
plays are:" -
19.'?5- His play about John L. Lewis' eyebrows:
Another Part of the Forest."
Ui.'iti His play dedicated to Al Masters "Yon Can't
Take it With You."
1937—His shrewd observation on the passage of
luue "Mouhiing Becomes Afternoon."
1938—His sequel to "Oedipus Rex": "I Remembir

Mama."
1939—His play about Lhe clock on tire watermelon:
"Watch on the Rhine."
1940—His play about the Moslem Prince: "Boy
Meets Girls."
1941— His musical comedy: "Miss Libertine."
L)r Dailey believes it i.; very important for an aspir
ing young actor to learn the correct meanings for stage
terminology. He was once fired from a production be
cause he was mauling an actress during a performance.
Immediately after he was fired, he decided to learn
the correct meaning of the term "stage hands."
Another dubious distinction field by Dr. Dailey was
thai of participating in the show which had the short
est rim in Broadway history. His run in "The Last
Mile" was completed in four minutes and six seconds,
which established a new indoor record for the four
lap event.. Included in the supporting cast of this show
were two foreign actors named Gunder Haag and
Arne Anderson.
In addition to his work in the legitimate theater, he
has also had a great deal of acting experience in the
motion pictures (?) His most recent role was in "Yes,
Sir, That's My Baby," directed by Roberto Rossellini.
Dr. Dailey holds a unique position in the Hollywood
.social circles. He is the only young man in town who
ha.: never been engaged to Elizabeth Taylor.
And now, we proudly present our esteemed lec
turer, Dr. W. Burymore Dailey . . . .)
"Let me see .... "So You're Going lo Major in
Drama, eh?" Well, let's see .... er ... . all ....
er. Aw, hell, let's fare it: I don't know anything
about this subject!"
