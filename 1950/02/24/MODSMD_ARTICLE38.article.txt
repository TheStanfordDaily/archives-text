# Juniors Plan Dance, Picnic For End-Quarter Splurge
## Country Club Site of Prom; Prize Offered for Winning Bid Design 
### 
Picnic plans for an all-campus outing on March 5 have been
added to the end-of-the-quarter social splurge sponsored by the
Class of '51.
While their design contest to find an original cover for the
Junior Prom bids goes ahead, the juniors have arranged a home

| town, Fourth of July sort of picnic at
Mangini's on that Sunday afternoon.
Entertainment and games will be
J strictly informal and nearly spon
i tancous. Three-legged and wheel
| barrow races, a pie-eating contest,
and similar events will be held dur
| ing the afternoon, but no advance
| sign-ups are necessary.
Half And Half
Food will be provided by the indi
| viduals, but the picnic co-chairmen,
Jackie Goodyear and Trish Chapman,
recommend a half-and-half plan for
j couples.
"The gals can pack the picnic
lunches and bring them along." they
| said. "The boys' share will be the
j liquid refreshmentâ€”all kinds avail
| able at the picnic grounds."
Meantime, the Junior Prom com
mittee has repeated its request for
i design ideas for the dance bids.
Wonderland Theme
Entries should carry out the theme
j of "Wonderland Promenade," based
j on the amazing adventures of Lewis
| Carroll's Alice.
Designs must be drawn with India
I ink on white poster board. Sugges
tions for color may be included with
the drawing. Any student may enter.
