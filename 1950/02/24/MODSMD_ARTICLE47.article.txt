## Mermen, Fullerton Splash In Enema Pools Today 
### 
Stanford's powerful mermen face
their first real test of the* young
campaign today when they match
strokes with the men of Fullerton
JC—long the king of junior college
swimming. Hostilities are slated to
get under way at 4 p.m. in Encina
i Pool.
The idea of mighty Stanford
| meeting the tiny Southland school
| appeared ludicrous to many when
j relations between the two schools
began last year. A few remembered
that Fui lei ton's Jucos had copped
' the national JC title, in 1!)48 by out
| scoring its combined opposition. But
still, the idea of their matching
! four-year schools seemed highly ir
regular.
Then they came north for a pair
| of meets with Cal and Stanford.
They went home with a split. A
respected Bear team fell by the
| margin of two first places. The In
l dians, with their six-season home
| meet winning streak still intact,
S fared better. They touched out the
! Jaysees 39 to !sti.
In May Fullerton added another
j national JC title by nosing out a
Stockton College troupe which was
also "big school" swimmingly speak
ing. Fullerton was still a junior
j college, but it would never again
be scheduled as a breather by a
California university.
Last week Fullerton placed sec
ond in a triangualr meet with USC
and UCLA. Included in the jaycees'
performances were a pair ol times
which spell trouble l'or the Cards
j Ibis afternoon.
Bob Thompson, the Southland
athlete who failed last fall as a
Stanford provisional student, placed
second in the IUO in 54 3. He also
led off the day's winning four-man

relay, which was docked at ;':40.8.
Matching the crack Fullerton re
lay will be Dave Putnam, Bob Wy
eoff, Ernie Pohe (:i junior transfer
lrom Fullerton), and Hub Stokeley
in what promises to be the meet's
best event. Coach Tom Ilaynie will
also enter two more Indian relays
as pacers.
Facing Thompson in the century
will he Putnam and Chuck Kelly.
Putnam has turned in a 5.'!.2 for bis
best practice session.
Ju the remaining seven events the
Indians appeal' beyond the reach of
the visitors. Ifaynie h;,:; been driv
ing his charges bard in preparation
lor USC and the PCC finals in May,
and no junior college upstart even
Fullerton JC is going to mar his
pro-season record.

In May Fullerton added another

be scheduled as a breather by a

Last week Fullerton placed sec

performances were a pair ol times
which spell trouble l'or the Cards

Bob Thompson, the Southland
athlete who failed last fall as a
Stanford provisional student, placed
second in the IUO in 54 3. He also
led off the day's winning four-man

relay, which was docked at ;':40.8.
Matching the crack Fullerton re

lrom Fullerton), and Hub Stokeley
in what promises to be the meet's
best event. Coach Tom Ilaynie will
also enter two more Indian relays
as pacers.

Stanford's powerful mermen face
their first real test of the* young
campaign today when they match
strokes with the men of Fullerton
JC—long the king of junior college
swimming. Hostilities are slated to
get under way at 4 p.m. in Encina
i Pool.
The idea of mighty Stanford
| meeting the tiny Southland school
| appeared ludicrous to many when
j relations between the two schools
began last year. A few remembered
that Fui lei ton's Jucos had copped
' the national JC title, in 1!)48 by out
| scoring its combined opposition. But
still, the idea of their matching
! four-year schools seemed highly ir
regular.
Then they came north for a pair
| of meets with Cal and Stanford.
They went home with a split. A
respected Bear team fell by the
| margin of two first places. The In
l dians, with their six-season home
| meet winning streak still intact,
S fared better. They touched out the
! Jaysees 39 to !sti.
