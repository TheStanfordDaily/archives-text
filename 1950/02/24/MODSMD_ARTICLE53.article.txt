# Rugby Team Faces Two Opponents This Weekend
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor's rugby |
charges open a two-game stand on !
the local field this afternoon when
they take on the UCLA ruggers.
Tomorrow afternoon the Cards will
meet the University Club to make j
up a game which was canceled ear- i
tier in the season. Starting times are |
set for :$ p.m. today and 2 p.m. for
Saturday's tilt; both contests will be '
played on the rugby field.
These two games should serve as !
adequate conditioners for next Sat
urday's all-important Cal-Stanford
battle which will probably decide 1
the mythical Coast title. The Bears
can be had, as was indicated last {
weekend when the Olympic Club, a j
team which the Indians have ul- [
ready defeated twice this year, held ;
the Bears to a 6 to 0 tie. In fact, j
the Bears had to pull a last-minute <
rally to salvage a draw.
The Bruin ruggers are captained !
by Sherwood Simpson and Dick
Thies and include such football stal
warts as Hal Mitchell, Fran Man
dula, Rod O'Meara, and Billy
Greenberg.
The Cards may have to play with- j
"

out the services of their regul
scrum half, Bill Geary, who is lim
ing with a charley horse. 1! he
unable to start, either Gregg Bei
or Jim Bradshaw will till in. B
Oswald, reserve back who is sutl<
( ing from a hip pointer, may also
I forced to sit it out. Bob Regier w
lake over for Darrhl Dentoni in t
Â» front rank. Dentoni suffered a hi
ken leg in the second British ('
: lumbia game and is out for l
j season.
