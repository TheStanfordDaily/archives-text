LONDON, Friday, Feb. 24
(AP) â€” Britain's Labor Party
wrapped up a 5 to 3 lead over
the Conservatives in Parlia
mentary election returns from
more than a third of the nation
today. Labor claimed a clear
cut victory and, with it, a man
date (o drive Britain along the
road lo Socialism for five more
years.
Upturns from 266 of 625 constitu
encies showed Labor clinched 163
seats in the new House of Commons
to 102 for the Conservatives. The
once - powerful Liberals received
only one.
Jubilant Laboril.es predicted at
least, a 60-scal majority in the new
house. 'Ihry had a 148-meinbcr ma
jority in the last one.
Conservatives (Hum
(<lnom settled over Conservative
headquarters. While Winston
Churchill's hard-fighting party liad
cut into Labor's ranks in Parliament,
by morning it still had a long way to
go. But the Conservatives have not
yet. given up the fight.
Prime Minister Attlce was re
elected to the House, along with Sir
Stafford Cripps, chancellor of Ihe ex
chequer, and Ancurin Bevan, the
health minister.
Attlee hailed the results as "pretty
satisfactory."
Indications were that the vote was
the heaviest in Britain's history
somewhere in the neighborhood of
26,000,000.
The Labor Minister of Health,
Bevan, was a four-to-onc winner in
hi.s district in Monmouthshire, Wales.
Foreign Secretary Finest Bevin
was returned to the House, but Col
onial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones
lost out to his Conservative oppon
ent by a margin of 81 votes.
Churchill Assured
The vote in Conservative leader
Churchill's district, was not to be
counted until later today, but his
election virtually was assured.
In biting into Labor's majority, the
Conservatives took 14 Commons seats
which had been Laborite, while sur
rendering only one which had been
Conservative. Because of the revi
sion of constituencies, it was not pos
sible to in most cases to compare
these results with those of 1945,
when Labor scored its postwar
landslide.
The count of votes will be resumed
this afternoon.
Indications were that the voters
looked upon this election as a
straight-out battle between Labor
and Conservatives. The minor par
ties rlid badly.
The Communists had won no seats
at. all. They had two seats in the
last Parliament and put 100 candi
dates in the field this time.
