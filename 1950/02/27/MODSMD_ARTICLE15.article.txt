## CIO Leader Describes Red Activity 
### 
A high echelon union loader told
Stanford I,hw School students Fri
day thai Communists in the CIO
havr consistently subordinated un
ion policies to the policies of the Sov
iet Russian and the Communist Party
din ing the past 10 years.
Speaking on "Communism in La
bor Unions" before Ihe Law School
in Memorial Auditorium, Tim Flynn,
Northern California regional director
for (he national CIO, said that the
Communists had refused to follow
union policies when they conflicted
with the Russian and party causes.
The talk was sponsored by the Law
Forum.
Flynn made no bones about linking
the nnion Communists with Russia.
He described their action.s within the
party both during the war and after,
when they attempted to use their
union tt'j a tool for party policy.
llic union leader outlined the his
tory of the Communist movement
within the labor unions. In the
19205, be said, they abandoned at
tempts to set up independent unions
and were ordered by their leaders to
go back into the American Federa
tion of Labor. When the CIO was or
ganized in the mid-thirties, the Com
munists were told to abandon the
AFL for the CIO,
"Nothing was done at the top of
the CIO to stop Communist activi
ties," Flynn said, and added that
there were other radical groups, such
as the Socialists, in the union at the
same time. Union leaders became
concerned over the Communists,
however, when the CIO moved into
the auto, steel, and rubber indus
tries.
"In 1939, Russia and Germany
signed a peace pact, and the Com
munists in the union swung into ac
tion to carry out the Soviet line in
the union that war was the result of
imperialism on the part of the Brit
ish and the French," Flynn said.
At the 1940 Atlantic City conven
tion, when Philip Murray replaced
John L. Lewis as CIO chief, prob
lems of I/ewi,s' opposition and AFL
competition obscured the Communist
issue somewhat, but a resolution was
passed condemning totalitarian po
litical control, including Commu
nism.
