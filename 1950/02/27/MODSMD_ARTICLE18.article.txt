# Wolfe Says Stalin Rules 800 Million
## 
### 
Bertram Wolfe, an outstanding
American expert on Russia and Com
munism, described Josef Stalin as
"the most powerful man in the
world" in a lecture here Friday.
Wolfe was introdueed to the large
audience in Cubberley Auditorium
as one of the few Americans who
know Stalin personally.
He has been director-general of
the Russian news agency, Tass, in
South America and Mexico. He at
tended the fifth and sixth World
Congresses "112 the Communist Party,
and had several .sharp disputes with
Stalin in which he criticized Stalin's
nationalistic tendencies.
Wolfe pointed out that Stalin had
changed the more sincere interna
tionalist trend of world Communism
to a formidable weapon of imperial
istic Russian foreign policy. Stalin
now controls 800 million peopleâ€”al
most a half of the population of the
world.
He is, Wolfe said, a "cunning and
cynical politician" who succeeded in
eliminating his personal enemies and
those who might be dangerous to his
position.
According to a letter quoted by
Wolfe, Stalin as early as 1920 de
manded the incorporation of Ger
many and the Balkan countries into
the "greater Soviet Union." From
more recent Soviet newspapers he
quoted letters to "the Great Stalin,"
with greetings to the "immortal
teacher, brother, leader, and hero"
