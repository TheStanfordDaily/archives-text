LONDON, Feb. 2(5 (/I') â€” Left
wingers in the British Labor party
were reported rallying for an ear
ly trial of strength with the more
moderate leaders of Prime Minister
Attlec's government.
The question of the incipient
cleavage was this: Should Labor
walk softly in the face of its hair
breadth escape from defeat in
Thursday's election, or should it
militantly carry on for more so
cialism?
Incidental in the embryo revolt
is an election post-mortem to be
held at a party caucus Wednesday
when questions will bo raised over
the way Deputy Prime Minister
Herbert Morrison and Foreign Sec
retary Levin ran the campaign.
