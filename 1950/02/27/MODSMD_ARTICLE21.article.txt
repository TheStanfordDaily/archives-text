# Moot Court Open To New Law Students
## 
### JOHN BUSH 
The Stanford Moot Com I program
has been extended to first-year law
.Indents in a plan inaugurated this
year.
The lirsl year program, modeled
after the Harvard Haw Club system,
is operated on a "law firm" system.
Qualified third - year students are
selected to direct "firms" of not
more than eighl first-year men. The
head of each firm does preliminary
research in the legal problem as
signed to his group, and then gives
il to the junior members of his firm
to prepare for trial.
Contestants present their eases in
the same manner as they would in
a regular appellate court, except
that a memorandum of points and
authorities is substituted for the
more formal and detailed appellate
brief.
Student .Fudges
Judges are selected from the sec
ond- and third-year classes, and a
member of Moot Court Board acts
as bailiff. Judges and bail iff hear
the arguments of the first-year men,

and judge them on quality of oral
presentation, ability to answer
questions of the court in a straight -
forward manner, relating those an
swers to the general scheme f>f their
arguments, and on the quality of the
memoranda.
Contestants arc frequently inter
rupted by ihc judges and questioned
on their cases. In fact, according to
Clifford I«. Duke Jr.. chairman of
Moot Court Hoard, I lie leading fea
ture of the proceeding is that of
questions and answers, the purpose
being not to quiz the "attorney" on
the problem, but to hcln bring court
and counsel to agreement, on the
issues and factors involved in solv
ing the issues.
In the judging, emphasis is placed
011 force fulness, sincerity, and ac
curacy in short, advocacy rather
than on oratory or the nicotics of
formal debate.
Firms Compete
The first-year men do their own
research, with the advice of their
firm directors where questions and
authorities have been overlooked.

All the members of the firm work
on the same problem, and compete
sole'y with the men in another firm.
About half the first - year men
have enrolled in the voluntary pro
gram. although no academic credit
is given.
The principal goal of the plan, ex
plains Board chairman Duke, is to
get the first-year student on his feet
in oral argument as soon as possible.
"The program was set up not only
to give experience in courtroom
techniques, but also on the theory
that the law is known only when it
can be spoken and written and ap
p'ied to distinct factual situations,"
Duke says. "In this respect it is an
extension of the case system based
on the problem rather than the gen
eral principle approach to the law."
Prizes Awarded
Prizes are given to all members of
the firm which has the highest rat
ing for the two arguments, one in
fall and one in winter quarter; and
to the individual who has the high
est rating for each particular prob
lem.

Arguments are held in the Moot
Couit room of the new Law Build
ing. The room is designed exactly
like a regular courtroom, including
the bench, attorneys' tables, and
jury box. The jury box is not used
at present, however, as all Moot
Court proceedings now in operation
are on the appellate level.
Arguments are to he held today,
tomorrow, and Wednesday this
week at 4:15 and 7:15 p.m. (Prob
lems to be argued fire described in
Friday's Daily.)

third - year men and two second

the Board is Professor Philip C.

The Stanford Moot Com I program
has been extended to first-year law
.Indents in a plan inaugurated this
year.
The lirsl year program, modeled
after the Harvard Haw Club system,
is operated on a "law firm" system.
Qualified third - year students are
selected to direct "firms" of not
more than eighl first-year men. The
head of each firm does preliminary
research in the legal problem as
signed to his group, and then gives
il to the junior members of his firm
to prepare for trial.
Contestants present their eases in
the same manner as they would in
a regular appellate court, except
that a memorandum of points and
authorities is substituted for the
more formal and detailed appellate
brief.
Student .Fudges
Judges are selected from the sec
ond- and third-year classes, and a
member of Moot Court Board acts
as bailiff. Judges and bail iff hear
the arguments of the first-year men,

and judge them on quality of oral
presentation, ability to answer
questions of the court in a straight -
forward manner, relating those an
swers to the general scheme f>f their
arguments, and on the quality of the
memoranda.
Contestants arc frequently inter
rupted by ihc judges and questioned
on their cases. In fact, according to
Clifford I«. Duke Jr.. chairman of
Moot Court Hoard, I lie leading fea
ture of the proceeding is that of
questions and answers, the purpose
being not to quiz the "attorney" on
the problem, but to hcln bring court
and counsel to agreement, on the
issues and factors involved in solv
ing the issues.
In the judging, emphasis is placed
011 force fulness, sincerity, and ac
curacy in short, advocacy rather
than on oratory or the nicotics of
formal debate.
Firms Compete
The first-year men do their own
research, with the advice of their
firm directors where questions and
authorities have been overlooked.

All the members of the firm work
on the same problem, and compete
sole'y with the men in another firm.
About half the first - year men
have enrolled in the voluntary pro
gram. although no academic credit
is given.
The principal goal of the plan, ex
plains Board chairman Duke, is to
get the first-year student on his feet
in oral argument as soon as possible.
"The program was set up not only
to give experience in courtroom
techniques, but also on the theory
that the law is known only when it
can be spoken and written and ap
p'ied to distinct factual situations,"
Duke says. "In this respect it is an
extension of the case system based
on the problem rather than the gen
eral principle approach to the law."
Prizes Awarded
Prizes are given to all members of
the firm which has the highest rat
ing for the two arguments, one in
fall and one in winter quarter; and
to the individual who has the high
est rating for each particular prob
lem.

Arguments are held in the Moot
Couit room of the new Law Build
ing. The room is designed exactly
like a regular courtroom, including
the bench, attorneys' tables, and
jury box. The jury box is not used
at present, however, as all Moot
Court proceedings now in operation
are on the appellate level.
Arguments are to he held today,
tomorrow, and Wednesday this
week at 4:15 and 7:15 p.m. (Prob
lems to be argued fire described in
Friday's Daily.)
