# Yardley Hits 47 Points As Indians Win, Lose
## Bruins Win, 62-57; USC Loses, 60-57 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford pushed open the cel
lar door last Friday night to stun
USC's fading Trojans, 60 to 57,
as George Yardley went com
pletely wild again.
It was Stanford' 3 first win over
Troy in three years and 12 tries, and
halted USC's longest win stroak
over Stanford at, 11 straight.
And it was George Yardley, the
Balboa Bomber, who suppliod the
dynamite. Yardley tossed in 25
points, took charge of both back
boards, and turned in the finest in
dividual performance since the days
of Jim Pollard.
It hardly mattered that one night
later UCLA moved into the Pavilion
and notched its ninth Southern Di
vision win, 62 to 57, in a game that
could also have gone Stanford's way
had the Indians capitalized on their
final fivo minutes against the Bru
ins, who had lost three regulars via
the foul route.
The win, UCLA's seventh in a
row over Stanford, gave the Bru
ins an automatic loop championship,
as USC hit rock-bottom in Berkeley
Saturday to lose to the Bears, 60-58.
It's John Wooden's second consecu
tive Southern Division title.
But the hottest item of the entire
bunch these days is blond George,
who has outscored the "fabulous"
Bill Sharman in the last five games
has absolutely outplayed and out
shot Bullseye Bill in their three re
cent meetings, and has put on a
phenomenal scoring spree to come
dangerously close to the coveted 200
mark. It is even conceivable that he
too can crack Luisetti's 12-year
old record of 232 points in 12 games.
With 25 points against USC Fri
day night, and 22 more against the
Bruins Saturday, Yardley zoomed
his total to 188, just 16 behind Shar
man's 204, and 44 off the record.
Sharman still has 28 to go.
Yardley was carried from the
floor on the shoulders of his team
mates after the Trojan win, and it
would have been even more appro
priate if they could have found room
for Bill Warren too.
Warren, starting his first varsity
game, followed Sharman around
like his right foot. By playing in
front of him, waving his hand in
his face, and sticking like 50-cent
glue, he held the Trojan ace to a
lone two free throws in the first
half,
Sharman got his only four buck
ets .a tip-in, a fart-break lay-up,
and two jump-shots, when Warren
wasn't in the lineup. After Warren
went out on personals, with 11 min
utes to go, Harry Hugasian took
over with more of the same, and
Sharman was shackled to just 12
With a one-point lead and three
minutes left, Stanford's linaup was

BIG JIM RAMSTEAO, six and
a half feet of Stanford ccnter,
turned in hi sfinest performance
to date Saturday night as he aided
All - Coast candidate George
Yardley on the backboards, and
tanked a handy 19 points for the
locals.
