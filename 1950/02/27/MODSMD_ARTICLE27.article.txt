# Debate on Campus Issues
## 
### 
At last week's pre Excom meeting, 15 stu
dents tossed their ideas on the table for sev
eral hours with regard to two forthcoming
campus issues. Both are of immediate inter
est to the student body. At least one of them
probably will appear on the spring ballot in
the form of a proposed amendment to the
ASSU Constitution.
The two problems were concerned with:
1. Whether or not an Honor Code violator
fihould be allowed to serve on Men's or Wom
en's Councils, and
2. Whether or not the ASSU president and
vice-president should be paid salaries.
The first proposal would go on the spring
ballot as a Constitution change, but the second
rould be passed by Excom as a by-law. Ear
lier this quarter Excom discussed a third pro
posal—whether or not the terms of Excom rep
resentatives should be staggered so as to give
continuity to the governing body.
Little has been accomplished on these ques
tions, except as was evidenced by two straw
votes.
Some supported presenting all or some of
the issues to the student body for appraisal.
Student Body President Hank Rosin recently
udvocated that more use be made of the De
hate Society for presenting campus opinion.
lixcom shouldn't have to pass blanket codes
over big issues that affect the entire Stanford
community. There's no reason why several
thousand, rather than 15, students can't hear
.ill sides of the question aired in formal de
bates or roundtables.
As evidenced by poor turnouts in the past
«»t the sessions in Excom crackerbox meeting
room, the majority of students never have a
chance to get more than a glance at the contro
versies before marking their X's on the ballot.

If the Debate Society were to work out the
pros and cons of the issues and present them
in an organized debate in Cubberley Audi
torium, the picture might be different.
It would be important that students trained
in debate handle the arguments. Excom, al
though it has its share of topnotch speakers,
often spends needless time tossing ideas
above their heads until nothing is left but a
murky haze.
One representative presents his idea, a sec
ond lets the first theory go unanswered and
proceeds to throw in his own viewpoint.
Meanwhile the first point is lost.
The debaters, on the other hand, toss the
affirmative cards on the table, then play the
negative cards, and let the highest cards take
the tricks.
Unlike most intercollegiate debates, the
above suggestion would be a non-decisional
debate. The student body would hear the ar
guments, and only indirectly—on their ballots
—would the results be indicated.
Tom Brand, manager of the Debate Society,
heartily favors the plan. He said there is ac
tually no need "to talk about solving problems
of the world." The society would be more
than willing to help crystallize campus opinion
on issues confronting the students.
It seems particularly appropriate to us that
the Debate Society should be the agent for the
discussion of student problems. After all it is
one of the chief beneficiaries of ASSU and
and University funds. Last year the ASSU
sent Farm debaters everywhere from West
Point to Oregon to enter national tournaments.
This would be the debaters' chance to serve
the student body.
We hope the proposal will receive Excom's
attention as interest in the student issues in
creases before the spring elections. - G.A.
