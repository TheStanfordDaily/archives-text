# A 						Fallen Oak Branch
## 
### 
The wee hours of the morning Friday were a
busy time for a few individuals apparently
lired of the dull rigors of normal living. Within
the space of an hour, three lawns were torn up
on the Row and a large limb hacked off an old
oak in the middle of Lomita Drive, blocking the
road on one side.
The lawn incident was not a new one, but
for some reason it provided a great source of
• imusement to two men who had nothing else
to do at that time of the morning, except sleep.
The felling of the oak branch was a little more
novel, for not only did it badly damage an
old time campus landmark, but it blocked the
road for several hours and might have killed
a motorist had the police not discovered it first.
The very novelty of this act was enough to
bring reporters and a cameraman to the scene
lo describe the story to the community. If it
had been a dull day for the newspapers in San
Francisco, the novelty of the fallen oak might
liave found its way into print there. Many simi
lar Stanford stories, including the destruction
at Hoble in 1947 and the Row-running incident
which resulted in a student suspension last
y -ar, have found their way across the nation on
the wires of the newspaper services.

Stanford suffered little materially for these
acts compared to the damage to the Univer
sity's prestige. This prestige, built up in the
minds of the general public by news of noted
men, successful students, scientific discov
eries, foreign scholarships, and the many
benefits of work at the University, is easily de
stroyed by the sensational pranks of "college
life."
College pranks are understandable, and for
centuries have had their place in campus life.
Many such pranks are carried out every day,
injuring no one and amusing even the liberal
minded deans. However, there is a very defi
nite line to be drawn between pranks con
sidered amusing and those considered dam
aging and disgusting. This line should not be
hard for anyone of college intelligence to
draw.
We therefore call the attention of the cam
pus to these destructive activities, and point
out that they mean nothing but a little enjoy
ment for a very few at the expense of the large
majority of the Stanford community. A word
to the wise is sufficient, and let the wise pre
vail upon the not-so-wise to exercise caution
in their choice of "fun"—A.M.

eries, foreign scholarships, and the many
benefits of work at the University, is easily de
stroyed by the sensational pranks of "college
life."
College pranks are understandable, and for
centuries have had their place in campus life.
Many such pranks are carried out every day,
injuring no one and amusing even the liberal
minded deans. However, there is a very defi
nite line to be drawn between pranks con
sidered amusing and those considered dam
aging and disgusting. This line should not be
hard for anyone of college intelligence to
draw.
We therefore call the attention of the cam
pus to these destructive activities, and point
out that they mean nothing but a little enjoy
ment for a very few at the expense of the large
majority of the Stanford community. A word
to the wise is sufficient, and let the wise pre
vail upon the not-so-wise to exercise caution
in their choice of "fun"—A.M.
