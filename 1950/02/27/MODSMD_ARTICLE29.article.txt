## Faculty Rating System 
### 
To the Editor:
Thoughts about faculty-rating polls. The Daily an
nounces a poll. Surprising? Not too. Nowadays large
i ondolences are being extended to that poor, down
trodden, human doormat, the student. Sympathy
pours in from all sides. I would like to point out that
I rofessors, too, are people, even though some days it
may be hard to place the genus.
Agreed that all effort toward improving "educa
tional processes" anywhere deserve respect and ap
plause. Agreed that to the extent that such polls eri
t ourage some hitherto wayward prof to criticize his
ways and means, they are a healthy thing. Still, being
«.f a critical turn of rnind, I am inclined to wonder
bout the validity of these polls. Let me illustrate my
/onderings by a few questions:
Will such polls be efficiency polls or popularity
polls? How expertly can the student judge a course?
I Joes the course fit into a larger whole of which the
tudent cannot, by the nature ol things, be fvdly
;iware?
Are such polls symptomatic of a trend? Is it possi
ble that they are symptomatic of a trend in student
. 'Jitude from learning toward being taught? What do
people mean when they say "a college teaches, but a
university learns?" What then, is Stanford to be, a
< ollege or a university? Where lie the joys of aca
demic life, in learning or in being taught?
I there any difference in a poll run by a professor
for himself, ond a compulsory poll, undertaken in an
..i biliary framework whose results are interpreted

by .students and then presented to the professor?
Does it make any sense to recommend a division of
labor? Should the faculty worry about teaching,
while the students worry about learning?
Does the remark made upon the institution of one
such poll (elsewhere, not here) —"I paid my $600, now
where's my education?"—constitute a complete justi
fication of these polLs? or, is there more to an educa
tion than the price of admission?
