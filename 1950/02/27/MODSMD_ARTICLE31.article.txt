The de Paur Infantry Chorus,
which will appear at Stanford
Wednesday, is now on its third ci
vilian tour.
The chorus was born in off-duty
hours in a sprawling New Jersey
training camp of a group of Negro
soldiers to liked to sing.
Word of their music spread around
Fort Dix, and they were asked to
take part in a war bond rally. After
a number of appearance to stimulate
war bond sales, the army established
the chorus as a morale unit to enter
tain troops.
The chorus was part of the 372 nd
Infantry Regiment, which was alerted
for the Pacific early in 1944 and
moved to a departure station in Ari
zona. At the same time, Captain
Leonard de Paur, noted choral direc
tor, was assigned to the regiment and
placed in charge of the chorus.
The army arranged a cross-country
tour to spur the current war bond
campaign, with concerts in every
large city and broadcasts on the
"Army Hour," "Stage Door Can
teen," and other programs. The tour
was climaxed with a performance at
the fourth inaugural dinner honoring
President Roosevelt.
During the next three years the
chorus sang for American armed
forces in every theater of war. When
the war was over and most of the
chorus members had enough points
to come home, de Paur persuaded
them to stick together, and they en
tertained troops for eight months
longer.
Tickets for the Infantry Chorus
concert, to be presented in Memorial
Hall Wednesday, may be purchased
at the Concert Series office for $11.60,
$2.40, $1.80, and $1.20. The bfllce is
