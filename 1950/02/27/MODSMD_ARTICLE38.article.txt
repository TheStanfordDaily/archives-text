Yardley and Gay Bryan at forwards,
Ralph Carver at center, and Harry
Hugasian and O'Sullivan at guards.
Everett Dean, trying to get more
height in the game, inserted Dick
Clegg for Hugasian, with the pres
sure on, the score 57-56 in favor of
tlie Cards. With three Trojans on
him, Clegg was tied up for a jump
(jail. Stanford came up with it and
called time.
Here, Dean dusted off the old vet
Chavalas, and sent him in for Clegg.
One minute remained. SC was play
ing tie,hi all over the floor. Chava
las passed backcourt to O'Sullivan
who passed back to Chavalas who
wa:. hemmed in by a Trojan wedge
ol Al Laiiiont, Bob Kolf, and Don
Underwood. But Chavalas made a
clever 40-loot pass to Gay Bryan,
all alone under the basket. Bryan

missed, but Ralph Carver was
â–  fouled while following. Carver con
nected to make it 59-56, and a few
seconds later, O'Sullivan finished
things off with one more to end it
at (50-57.
It was only Stanford's second win
in 10 league starts, but it wns a sat
isfying one, in which almost every
j man on the team had a part.
Jim Ramstead gave Yardley Ire
j mendous aid on the backboards, and
; demonstrated clearly that he is on
his way to becoming the best pivot
man in the division.
His 19-point showing against UC
LA Saturday left the Bruins
mumbling, as he suckered Ray Alba
for two nice lay-ins, and caused
Ca-"1 Kraushaar to foul out early.
