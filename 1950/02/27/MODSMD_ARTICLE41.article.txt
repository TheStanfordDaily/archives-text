# Bruins Beat Farm Wrestling Team
## 
### 
Win Mumby's grapplers, ham
strung by forfeits in two important
weight divisions, lost their final in
tercollegiate meet of the season to
UCLA Saturday afternoon. In the
Encina Gym action, the Bruins
edged the Cards 18 to 14, although
Stanford won four of six varsity
bouts wrestled. The 128- and 145-
pound matches were forfeited by
Stanford.
Smilin' Steve Garst, Stanford
heavyweight, ran his winning streak
to seven straight to finish the sea
son undefeated, a record equaled in
recent times only by Olympic final
ist Vein Jones, ex-Card 13C- and
145-pounder.
Garst decisively beat Bruin Isao
Shimoyomo but could not pin the
Bruin, who was using defensive tac
tics throughout the match. The final
score stood 10 to 4 in favor of Garst.
Others on the win side of the
ledger for Stanford were Dick De-
Witt, Bruce Gait, and Dick Esben
shade.
Next weekend the Stanford wres
tlers will participate in the Far
Western Championships in Oakland
and the following week in the PCC
Championships at the University of
California.
