## Cards Dunk Fullerton JC 
### 
Stnaford's mighty mermen wal
loped Fullerton JC 43 to 32 Friday
in a record - shattering affair that
was closer than (he score indicated.
The Cards didn't clinch the meet
until the final event, the 400-yard
freestyle relay, which they won in
the sensational time of 3:36. Though
the Juco four-man was beaten by
more than three seconds, its time
was good enough to eclipse the Na
tional JC standard posted by anoth
er Fullerton relay team in 1948.
This marked the third jaycee rec
ord set by the invaders during the
afternoon.
Indian mentor Tom Haynie held
the visiting jaysee champs in high
regard but felt safe enough to: (1)
hold Pete Cole out of the 220 and
(2) permit the swimming ol both
sprints and the four-man relay in
the 20-yard tank.
The short pool, though rarely used
by Stanford, is stock-in-trade for
Fullerton. Also, the additional turns
necessitated by the 20-yard course
are conducive to better times. Na
tional junior college records do not
distinguish between pool lengths.
As a result, Fullerton copped both
sprints (a 60-yard race was substi
tuted for the 50) and led the In
dians 24 to 15 after six events. Hoy
Brown's 29.4 00 and 52.9 100 both
broke jaycee standards.
Then Jack Weeden swam a sensa
tional 1:37.9 to win the backstroke,
ex-Fullerton mermen Ernie Polte
and Bob Frojen made it one-two for
Stanford in the breaststroke, and
Cole easily outdistanced Fullerton's
Jack Schaalten in the quarter-mile.
Pete was clocked at 4:51.8, report
edly tops on the Coast so far this
season.
The Cards entered the crucial re
lay, worth eight points, leading by
a slim three-point margin and need
ed those eight markers for victory.
Frojen assured himself a trip to
the NCAA championships with a
1:02 performance in the breaststroke
portion of the medley. The tempo
rarily ineligible Ralph Sala is also
slated to journey to Ohio State for
the annual meet.
