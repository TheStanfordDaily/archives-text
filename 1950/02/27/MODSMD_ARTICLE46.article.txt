# Dinah's Advance in PA Tournament; Will Play L'Ommie's for Finals Spot
## 
### 
It's beat L'Omelette and get into
the finals of the P.A. tourney for the
Dinah's Shack basketball team now
that the Dinah's have won their sec
ond game of the tournament by
downing a tough St. Joseph's Alum
ni team 49 to 47 yesterday in Kezar
Pavilion.
Thanks largely to the efforts of
Don Stites and Derek Bok, the
Stanford lads won the close game.
Stites hit for 1G and Bok gathered
11. Bill Ahern, a regular on the
1947 Santa Clara championship
team, sparked the losers.

Other scoring for Dinah's: John
Hall, 8; Bob Sanguinetti, 5; Len
Hughes, 4 Jack Winslow, 3; and
Tom Randolph, 2.
A queer quirk in the bracketing
pits the two local restaurant-spon
sored teams (among the 84 in the
tourney) against each other for the
right to enter the championship
round. The winner of this game
leaves the qualifying rounds and
enters the charmed circle of sixteen
remaining teams. The loser bows
out of the tourney. The teams meet
Wednesday night in Kezar.
