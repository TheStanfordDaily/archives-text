# Frosh Score 11th Straight
## 
### 
Stanford's rampaging frosh bas
ketballers added two more easy
wins to thr'r total over the week
end to extend their consecutive vic
tory run to 11.
On Friday evening, before the
varsity's go with USC, the freshmen
outclassed Alameda High 67 to 45.
On Saturday Fresno High School
went down before the locals. Coach
Burnett's charges were not hard
pressed during the game and scored
an easy 59 to 38 win. Forward Paul
Johnson was high scorer.
These two games were the last on
the frosh's prep schedule, and this
weekend they wili wind up the sea
son with a series against California's
freshmen.
The Bear Cubs are rated tops in
Western freshman competition this
year. They have won every game
and have a phenomenal total of 22
victories.
Two of these wins were at the ex
pense ol the Papooses early in Jan
uary. Since then the locals have not
been touched, and they are a much
more organized and high - spirited
team than they were at that time.
