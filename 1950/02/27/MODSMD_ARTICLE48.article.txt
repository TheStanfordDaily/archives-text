# Ruggers Post Easy Wins; Cal and Coast Title Next
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's high-flying ruggers chalked up two impressive vic
tories over the weekend as they routed UCLA on Friday. 32 to 0.
and came back on Saturday to outclass the University Club, 26
to 3. This display of power by the Cards should serve as fair
warning to Cal whom the Indians meet next Saturday in a game

which will determine the coast rug
by champ.
In Saturday's tilt with the Uni- ,
varsity Club, Dick Hughes opened
the scoring when he climaxed a 40-
yard passing rush with a 10-yard
gallop to pay dirt. Bill McColl con
verted with Captain Mike Spiro
holding and the Cards had a 5 to 0
lead. Shortly thereafter another
passing rush sent Bill DeYoung
across for a try; McColl's conversion
attempt was wide.
McColl Breaks Loose
The third score came on two long
runs by Sam Thornton and Pete
Peckham. Peckham sprinted 40
yards, was trapped, and passed off
to Thornton who went the remain
ing 20 to score.
McColl then contributed the long
est run of the day as he broke loose
and went GO yards to pay dirt. He
added the conversion to make the |
half-time count 18 to 0.
In the early minutes of the second I
half a passing rush involving Peck- ,
ham, DeYoung, and Hughes pro- j
duced another score and Ed Culin's '

conversion made it 21 to 0.
At this point the Clubmen's lone
tally came on a penalty kick by
Hank Borghi. Harvey Doron then
closed out the scoring for the In
dians by booting a 10-yard penalty
kick.
In Friday's game the Bruins were
completely baffled by the tricky
running of the Stanford backs. In
fact, the Uclans seemed to be baf
fled by the game itself, as they ran
with the ball when they should have
kicked it and when they did kick it
the ball didn't go very far.
Everybody Scores
The Cards scored 1G points in
each half as everybody got into the
act. John Rosekrans, Bernie Tokarz,
Bob Regier, Mike Spiro, Ron Mur
phy, Pete Young, Gregg Bemis, and
Bob Stanley all accounted for scores
while McColl kicked three conver
sions and Doron added two. Inci
dentally, Spiro was quite elated
about scoring a try, since it marked
the first time Mike h;id hit pay dirt
in four years of rugby competition.
