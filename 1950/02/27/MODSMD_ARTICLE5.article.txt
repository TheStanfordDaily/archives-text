### 
BERKELEY Profess ;ors at the
University of California will meet
tomorrow night on the campus to
map plans for a legal fight against
an ultimatum to sipn anti - Com
munist oaths by April .!50 or forfeit
their jobs.
The ultimatum, handed down by
the Board of Regents Friday, has
touched otT the bitterest row in
years involving faculty.

a matter of academic principle. They
plan to seek a writ of mandate from
the State Supreme Court to block
enforcement of the Regents' order.
