# Hoover Library a Treasury Of International Documents
## 
### JOAN HARZFELD 
The real meaning of the Hoover
Library to students has for a long
time been submerged in grandiose
stories of its origin and stately sta
! tisties about its size.
That tall, lanky structure of ee
; ment houses perhaps the best collec
tion of documents on war. revolution,
and peace in this country. And the
J library is open to any undergraduate
who needs that kind of information —
; the only catch being first priority to
: the researchers.
Oftentimes certain data on a sub
ject can be found only at the Hoover
| Library. If the book or documents
I arc not needed, a professor may put
them on call for his class in the Re
i serve Book Room of the Main Li
i fcrary or conveniently shelve them at
the Hoover Library.
Senior Seminars
In addition to the service of re-
I served books, the Hoover Institute
I offers graduate and senior seminars.
! The winter time schedule lists such
j courses as: Propaganda in World
J Polities, Current Problems of Na
tional and World Security, and Prob
lems of Soviet Foreign Policy.
Seniors with permission may audit
graduate seminars in their field. The
seminars are mainly research work
1 and discussion. Often noted scholars

give lectures to these students.
Those who use the library are di- j
vided into four classes: visiting schol- <
ars, researchers, graduate students,
and undergraduates. Each group has
its own privileges and duties.
Robert Sullivant of the University
J of Chicago is an example of a visit
■ ing student. He is now working on a
: Ph.D. dissertation of the Ukrainc
j Soviet relations and the Hoover Li
| brary has one of the best collections
in the world on minority problems
of World War I and 11.
Persian Study
Hafez Farmanfara is a graduate
student from Iran who is doing !
! research in the library for his mas- I
: ler's thesis on the fall of the Kajar !
Dynasty in Persia. Farma said his
j material was very difficult to obtain,
j because it was related to the "Tudeh"
(Communist) Party in Persia. Both
the party and books about it have
j been outlawed,
On the second floor of the library |
i are a line of cubicles where there- j
! searchers spend their days. Each
j eubiclc has a desk and a chair and a
I sizeable number of books and papers.
One of these researchers, here to
gather data for a book, is Alexander
j Vucinich, brother of Stanford history
{ professor Wayne S. Vucinich.
Alexander Vucinich came last year
to the Hoover Institute on a Slavic
[Fellowship from the Rockefeller
| Fund. His main work is on Soviet
; rural communities. He has already
; published one article about the col-
I lective farm from his findings at the
J library.
History Undcrgrad
An undergraduate history major,
Beryl Knight, comes to the library to
do directed reading for a course on
j American Policies in the Far East. !
; The material for her assignments is
| not in the Main Library, so she must
! go to the Hoover Library.
Miss Knight has no working
| knowledge of a foreign language, but
i she gets enough information from ■
translations of books, periodicals,
and press releases from all over the
world. She also pointed out that the
library has a wealth of reference
i books, maps, and dictionaries in any
language, all available to interested
j students. i
