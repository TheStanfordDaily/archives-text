# Concert Is Rated High

### PHILIP CARTER 
A program of Bach orchestral
works was presented Sunday after
noon in the Memorial Auditorium
by the University Symphony. Un
do the direction of Sandor Salgo,
the orchestra featured soloists Su
san Winter, flutist, and Putnam Al
drich, harpsichordist.
The Stanford Symphony this year
is blessed with a rare combination
of directorial talent and gifted musi
cians. In addition they have had
the assistance of Dr. Putnam Al
drich from Mills College, a re
nowned Bach scholar as well as a
mature interpreter of the great
composer's keyboard works.
Fine Execution
Sunday afternoon's performance,
not unexpectedly, turned out to be
"no of the best exhibitions of solid
ciaf<sman:-;bip that this reviewer has
liea I'd.
Bach's use of the flute to provide
a brilliant gloss for the tone of a
violin is most, strikingly exhibited
in the B Minor Suite which received
careful treatment from Susan Win
ter, whose execution and all-too
rare richness of tone were the chief
asset;, of the performance.
The ensemble was •slightly marred
by occasional overpredominance of
the fii t violins and the smothering
of tlio violas which were placed be
hind the harpsichord.
('oncerto Outstanding
It would be difficult to overpraise
the performance of the F Minor
Harpsichord Concerto by Dr. Al
drich nnd the orchestra. The tex
ture of the famous second move
ment. "Arioso" can only be achieved
by using a harpsichord for the solo
instrument. The strings were sub
dued with striking cfTect. in the
quiet portions of this great work.
The most brilliant and powerful
performance of the afternoon was
the Brandenburg Concerto No. 1.
Correct, nuance and phrasing and
meticulous perfection of all the dif
ficult ?o!o parts are necessary to
make this work "sound."
Smoother Style
Outstanding credit for this pol
ished performance must go to Pro
fess.or Salgo for his abandonment of
the usual choppy "short how" style
of Bach string playing, and his care
ful training of the string section in
a smooth legato style.
The only disappointing feature of
the concert was the absence of the
student body in the audience. Stan
ford students are apparently not
aware of the fact that they have a
first-rate symphony here.

the performance of the F Minor
Harpsichord Concerto by Dr. Al
drich nnd the orchestra. The tex
ture of the famous second move
ment. "Arioso" can only be achieved
by using a harpsichord for the solo
instrument. The strings were sub
dued with striking cfTect. in the
quiet portions of this great work.
The most brilliant and powerful
performance of the afternoon was
the Brandenburg Concerto No. 1.
Correct, nuance and phrasing and
meticulous perfection of all the dif
ficult ?o!o parts are necessary to
make this work "sound."
Smoother Style
Outstanding credit for this pol
ished performance must go to Pro
fess.or Salgo for his abandonment of
the usual choppy "short how" style
of Bach string playing, and his care
ful training of the string section in
a smooth legato style.
The only disappointing feature of
the concert was the absence of the
student body in the audience. Stan
ford students are apparently not
aware of the fact that they have a
first-rate symphony here.
