WASHINGTON — The United
Mine Workers pleaded innocent to
day of contempt charges, insisting
that the union had called no strike
and that each of its 372,000 mem
bers individually had decided to
knock off work.
The union argument: since no
strike officially was called, the un
ion can't be in contempt of federal
court which on February 11 ordered
the men back to their jobs,
Government, attorneys began to
build up their argument: the men
all unit at the same time, and the
union is responsible for its members'
actions.
