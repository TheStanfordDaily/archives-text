# Late Election Results Cut Labor Majority to Seven
## Attlee's Program of Governmental Ownership of Industry Endangered 
### 
LONDON", Feb. 27 (AP)— Labor's majority in the House of Com
mons was pared to seven today and Prime Minister Attlee was
reported ready to suspend his big program of public ownership
of industry in the interests of sutvival.
The British Press Association's authoritative lobby correspond-

ent said King George's speech from
the throne next Monday—the speech
is written by the government—would
not even mention the issue of nation
alization of industry.
Attlee had an hour's private audi
ence with the king tonight. It wa3 his
first audience since last Thursday's
election and presumably was a cour
tesy call to inform His Majesty of
the government's immediate plans.
If Attlee had already completed
his new cabinet, he could have pre
sented it to the king at that time.
If the report is true that Attlee ha.-i
shelved his controversial program to
nationalize more industry it could
mean there are prospects of an xm
spoken political truce —the Commu
nist. newspaper Daily Worker called
it a "back door coalition"—for the
next few months.
Virtually the entire press was
agreed, however, that this would last
only long enough to adopt the annual
budget in April and transact some
other necessary government business.
Nearly all forecasts were that by
June, or not later than fall, another
election will be necessary.
Completed returns today from
three remote districts in Scotland
produced two Conservative and one
Liberal victory. These left the par
ties with this standing in the new
Commons:
Labor 315, Conservatives and their
allies 296, Liberals 9, Irish National,
ists 2. Independent Liberal 1, Speakei
of the House 1. The Speaker, Co).
Douglas Clifton Brown, is a Conserv
ative but ran as a Non-Partisan and
does not vote except in a tie.
One more constituency at Man
chester is to hold its eelction March
9. The election was postponed when
a Conservative candidate died.
If Labor had wort by a convincing
margin, it had planned to push
through nationalization of sugar, ce
ment, water works, meat distribution,
and warehousing, and also possibly
the chemical and shipbuilding indus
tries. It already has brought the coat
mines, the Bank of England, railways,
long distance trucking, gas, electric
ity, communications, and airways
under state ownership. .
