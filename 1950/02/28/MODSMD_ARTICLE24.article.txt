In Which We Say Hood Morning
G'morning to the readers (both of you) ....
As long as you are probably reading this while
choking down a few mouthfuls of dry cereal, I thought
you might be interested in a few words about a newly
developed breakfast product. This cereal is calied
"Hookies." One bowl of it for breakfast makes you
ju.st sick enough to stay home from school for the day.
I tried a bowl of it last week and have since received
lour threatening letters from my tape worm.
And G'morning to CBS comedian Sieve Allen, who
recently called our attention to a new discovery in
the field of vitamins. This new vitamin tablet is called
the "One-a-year" tablet. The only difficulty at present
is its unwieldy size. It comes in a long spaghetti box,
complete with a ramrod.
And G'morning to varsity golfer Bob Crozier, who
returned from a snow trip last week with assorted
bruises and the following anecdote of the ski lodge
• et: A bar room clown decided he would have a little
fun with one of those new "guaranteed-to-scare-your-
I riends" rubber masks which slip over the face. He
adjusted the repulsive mask over his own features and
ii opt up behind an acquaintance at the bar. With a
sufficiently frightening noise, he popped up beside his
tnerid, expecting to be greeted with at least a sur
prised tremble. Instead the friend looked at the mask
calmly and remarked with studied sincerity: "Say,
\ ou're looking a lot better since you gave up drinking!"
And G'morning to the music major who told me tht*
other day that a "falsetto" is a set of falsies.
And G'morning to my favorite San Francisco col

nihilist, who has recently enjoyed great success with
his new book about an ugly woman's father and his
life near the ocean, "Bag's Dad by the Bay."
And G'morning to Excoin, which has recently made
its smartest move in years. According to that exclusive
edition of the Stanford Daily which is issued only at
'the Daily Banquet, the boys and girls'on Excom have
finally decided to recognize "Slipping Around" as a
major sport.
And G'morning to Bob Celeri, who was recently
voted by America's dressmakers as the top "plunging
neckline" player of the year. The reason for this title
is that throughout the last football season, Mr. Celeri
always went straight down to middle, but never
showed a thing.
And G'morning to the University Registrar. 1 un
derstand he is being pressured by a group of male
students who want the female enrollment to be limited
lo shoemakers' daughters. That's what we need . . . .
a few girls who will give their awl.
And G'inorniug to all guys named Daily who will
stoop so low as to use a pun like that last one.
And G'morning to the unknown "fellow" who made
the decision to call one of the club rooms in Toyon
Hall the "Chartreuse Room." Come now, boys.
And G'moming to all the boys who took their week
end dates for a snack at one of the more exclusive
Peninsula lounges, such as the "Top O' 'Hie Mar
quard's."
And, as 1 said at the beginning .... G'morning to
ail of you.

a few girls who will give their awl.
And G'inorniug to all guys named Daily who will
stoop so low as to use a pun like that last one.
And G'morning to the unknown "fellow" who made
the decision to call one of the club rooms in Toyon
Hall the "Chartreuse Room." Come now, boys.
And G'moming to all the boys who took their week
end dates for a snack at one of the more exclusive
Peninsula lounges, such as the "Top O' 'Hie Mar
quard's."
And, as 1 said at the beginning .... G'morning to
ail of you.
In Which We Say Hood Morning
G'morning to the readers (both of you) ....
As long as you are probably reading this while
choking down a few mouthfuls of dry cereal, I thought
you might be interested in a few words about a newly
developed breakfast product. This cereal is calied
"Hookies." One bowl of it for breakfast makes you
ju.st sick enough to stay home from school for the day.
I tried a bowl of it last week and have since received
lour threatening letters from my tape worm.
And G'morning to CBS comedian Sieve Allen, who
recently called our attention to a new discovery in
the field of vitamins. This new vitamin tablet is called
the "One-a-year" tablet. The only difficulty at present
is its unwieldy size. It comes in a long spaghetti box,
complete with a ramrod.
And G'morning to varsity golfer Bob Crozier, who
returned from a snow trip last week with assorted
bruises and the following anecdote of the ski lodge
• et: A bar room clown decided he would have a little
fun with one of those new "guaranteed-to-scare-your-
I riends" rubber masks which slip over the face. He
adjusted the repulsive mask over his own features and
ii opt up behind an acquaintance at the bar. With a
sufficiently frightening noise, he popped up beside his
tnerid, expecting to be greeted with at least a sur
prised tremble. Instead the friend looked at the mask
calmly and remarked with studied sincerity: "Say,
\ ou're looking a lot better since you gave up drinking!"
And G'morning to the music major who told me tht*
other day that a "falsetto" is a set of falsies.
And G'morning to my favorite San Francisco col

nihilist, who has recently enjoyed great success with
his new book about an ugly woman's father and his
life near the ocean, "Bag's Dad by the Bay."
And G'morning to Excoin, which has recently made
its smartest move in years. According to that exclusive
edition of the Stanford Daily which is issued only at
'the Daily Banquet, the boys and girls'on Excom have
finally decided to recognize "Slipping Around" as a
major sport.
And G'morning to Bob Celeri, who was recently
voted by America's dressmakers as the top "plunging
neckline" player of the year. The reason for this title
is that throughout the last football season, Mr. Celeri
always went straight down to middle, but never
showed a thing.
And G'morning to the University Registrar. 1 un
derstand he is being pressured by a group of male
students who want the female enrollment to be limited
lo shoemakers' daughters. That's what we need . . . .
a few girls who will give their awl.
