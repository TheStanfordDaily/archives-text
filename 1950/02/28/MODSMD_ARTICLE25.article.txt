## Wolfe on Stalin 
### 
To the Editor:
We had occasion to wander over to Cubberley Fri
day evening last to have a look at the man who claims
to have argued with Josef Stalin. Mr. Wolfe, the man,
knows Stalin "personally," and at least on one oc
casion he has had tea with another Russian official,
fie struck us as being a man who would make a much
better impression on a woman's club than on a uni
versity audience.
Mr. Wolfe spent a good bit of his time reading with
good humor the letters to the editor section of Pravda
.aid, being a striking figure behind the lectern, he per
formed the task adequately. Difficulty arose, how
ever, when Mr. Wolfe tried to evaluate the mail. He
eenied to be disturbed because the Russians made too
much of Stalin's birthday. We recall when, not too
long ago, the great ex-President of one of the North
American republics celebrated the anniversary of his
biith. But, of course, our analogy, if pursued, might
prove embarrassing.
Normal Russian activity, according tu this "expert,"
i.- represented by the affairs of Lenin. Lenin was the
norm, and as Stalin has deviated from Lenin's pat
tern, Stalin is bad. By implication, is Mr. Wolfe say
ing that the only good Russian is a dead Russian?
Our "expert" also seemed to be disturbed because
Stalin seems to have a conscious plan of action, and
because £<alin seems to be a political realist. To be
lieve that Stalin is an evil genius because, unlike other
politicians, he knows what he is doing, and how much
lie can do, is to have an extremely naive view of other
politicians.
Finally, Mr. Wolfe, "the expert on Stalin," made a
great deal of the fact that the Russian leader was born
in Georgia. We are afraid that we cannot see the im
mediate importance of this. Mr. Wolfe seems to have
an unvoiced metaphysical assumption (hat makes his
logic very difficult for us to follow.
We would quietly suggest that it is understood that
there are enough leal differences between the USA and
the USSR without willfully confusing emotional and
personal issues that make any possible solution even
more difficult.
We have always supposed that a university audi
ence, unlike the woman's club, would like to know
what is behind the situation that they are trying to
understand. The personal whim of Stalin in the Rus
sian. situation does not seem to be an adequate ex
planation.

tern, Stalin is bad. By implication, is Mr. Wolfe say
ing that the only good Russian is a dead Russian?
Our "expert" also seemed to be disturbed because
Stalin seems to have a conscious plan of action, and
because £<alin seems to be a political realist. To be
lieve that Stalin is an evil genius because, unlike other
politicians, he knows what he is doing, and how much
lie can do, is to have an extremely naive view of other
politicians.
Finally, Mr. Wolfe, "the expert on Stalin," made a
great deal of the fact that the Russian leader was born
in Georgia. We are afraid that we cannot see the im
mediate importance of this. Mr. Wolfe seems to have
an unvoiced metaphysical assumption (hat makes his
logic very difficult for us to follow.
We would quietly suggest that it is understood that
there are enough leal differences between the USA and
the USSR without willfully confusing emotional and
personal issues that make any possible solution even
more difficult.
We have always supposed that a university audi
ence, unlike the woman's club, would like to know
what is behind the situation that they are trying to
understand. The personal whim of Stalin in the Rus
sian. situation does not seem to be an adequate ex
planation.
