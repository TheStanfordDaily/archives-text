# Flynn Speech
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The Daily's report concerning Mr. Flynn's talk on
Communists in the CIO only describes developments
up to 1940. This creates the impression that Commu
nists are still influential in the CIO. However, a major

part of Mr. Flynn's speech dealt with the recent house
e leaning in the CIO. Communist leaders have been
kicked out and the unions they dominated are being
reorganized to reflect the anti-Communist views of
the rank and file. Mr. Flynn himself is now engaged
in investigating alleged Communist influences in
Harry Bridges' Longshoremen's Union.

(Editor's Note.â€”Due to typographical difficulties,
the story on Tim Flynn's talk had to he cut in half
at the last minute.
(Flynn told how the Communists in the CIO did all
they could to push U.S. war production after Ger
many attacked Russia in 1940, even to Ihe detriment
of the other workers' welfare.
(At the Cleveland convention in November 1949,
the CIO voted to bar Communists from offices where
(hey could influence the union. A yardstick was set
up to measure the policies of the individual member
unions, and four unions have since been ousted for
their activities during the past 10 years.)
