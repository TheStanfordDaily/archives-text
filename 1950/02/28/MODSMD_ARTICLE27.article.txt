To the Editor:
The editorial "Two Epidemics This Year" carries
the statement:
"During the war, private caterers operated the
kitchen at Encina Commons. Menus were planned
with the profit motive in mind, and certain shortcuts
were taken.
"But today Encina is operated on a non-profit basis.
Whenever possible, the trained dietician orders the
freshest food possible. Encina, which feeds close to
HOO men, can't possibly serve the fancy dishes which
the 250 women at Roble get. But the food that is
served is clean and wholesome."
Question No. I—what does profit motive have to do
with group sickness? Or can't a person get ill unless
he is "exploited?"
Question No. 2—lf "food that is served is clean and
wholesome," then why the editorial "Two Epidemics
This year?"
Question No. 3 Why does the greater number
served at Encina preclude their having the same dishes
as Roble?
Both halls are large-scale operations. I suspect that
the greater foe*! intake of men (equaling greater cost)
may be of more importance. Also, I suspect that the
boys of Encina are being "bled," that the dining hall
is being operated at a profit. Furthermore, 1 suspect
that the profit is of the order of $20 per man per quar
ter. J suspect that this profit is being diverted to other
dining halls or to other University channels. It would
be interesting to get figures on costs and break down
depreciation figures, etc. Remember, larger protein
intake seems to go with success in athletics—and Stan
ford has not been outstanding in athletics recently.
There is too much "hush-hush, papa knows best" on
this subject and a lot of others.
