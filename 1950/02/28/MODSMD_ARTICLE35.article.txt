# Stanford Alumnus Named President Of Young Republican Convention
## 
### BOB DAVIS 
Stanford delegates to the state
convention of the Young Republi
cans at Bakersfield last weekend
walked away with first prize.
Don Edwards, class of solidly
backed by his Stanford club, was
elected the new president. The for
mer Stanford golf champion de

feated Dr. Harold Graves of Sacra
mento for the job.
There was a sharp row among the
350 convention delegates over the
election. Charges of backing from
Howser, Samish, Knight, and PG&E
plagued the candidates. Rumors
were whispered faster than an As
sociated Press ticker.
At 2 a.m. on the opening morning
of the Saturday - Sunday sessions,
Northern California counties held
their first caucus. The meeting was
intended to get sleepy-eyed dele
gates behind the nomination of
Graves. Alameda and Sacramento
groups expressed the fear that a
divided North would throw the
election for the third straight time
to a Los Angeles Republican.
Stanford Support
Stanford, Palo Alto, and San Jose
delegates met to decide whether
they would support Graves. There
the strategy of Edwards' campaign
was drawn up. Leroy Codding of
Stanford-Palo Alio and Tony Ana
stasi of San Jose started contacting
the delegates of 28 counties.
On Saturday at 3 p.m. the North
ern California caucus opened for
nominations. With members packed
on the beds, chairs, and floor, Cod
ding rose to nominate Edwards. Ed
wards' strength, it was soon learned,
came from the 23 delegates of Los
Angeles. The average delegation
had only five votes.
North Holds Out
The Northern counties held out
for Graves until 4 a.m .Sunday. By
that time a majority of the votes
were safely pledged to the Stanford
alumnus.
The nominating committee, sup
posedly for Graves, surprised the
convention by endorsing Edwards.
The announcement was met with
noisy opposition, but before the vot
ing was half over Graves had drop
ped from the race.
The hard work of the Bakersfield
meeting was done in the committees
that di al ted the resolutions. One
measure turned down was a resolu
tion supporting the end of the 20
pe>' cent excise tax on movie tickets.
Delegates said they refused to en
dorse a measure sponsored by a
"special interest."
Remembering the Knight-Warren
controversy, the Young Republicans
failed to give any pre-primary en
dorsements.

Penthouse parties, banquets in
huge halls, "canned" speeches by
Taft and Martin, and several Re
publicans carrying small American
flags added to the convention at
mosphere.
The importance of the conference
was pyramided by the attendance of
Governor Warren, Goodwin Knight,
Sam Collins, Ed Shattuck, Richard
Nixon, Raymond Darby, and film
star George Murphy.

noisy opposition, but before the vot
ing was half over Graves had drop
ped from the race.
The hard work of the Bakersfield
meeting was done in the committees
that di al ted the resolutions. One
measure turned down was a resolu
tion supporting the end of the 20
pe>' cent excise tax on movie tickets.
Delegates said they refused to en
dorse a measure sponsored by a
"special interest."
Remembering the Knight-Warren
controversy, the Young Republicans
failed to give any pre-primary en
dorsements.

Penthouse parties, banquets in
huge halls, "canned" speeches by
Taft and Martin, and several Re

was pyramided by the attendance of
Governor Warren, Goodwin Knight,
Sam Collins, Ed Shattuck, Richard
Nixon, Raymond Darby, and film

of the Saturday - Sunday sessions,
Northern California counties held
their first caucus. The meeting was

groups expressed the fear that a
divided North would throw the
election for the third straight time
to a Los Angeles Republican.
Stanford Support
Stanford, Palo Alto, and San Jose
delegates met to decide whether
they would support Graves. There
the strategy of Edwards' campaign
was drawn up. Leroy Codding of
Stanford-Palo Alio and Tony Ana
stasi of San Jose started contacting
the delegates of 28 counties.
On Saturday at 3 p.m. the North
ern California caucus opened for
nominations. With members packed
on the beds, chairs, and floor, Cod
ding rose to nominate Edwards. Ed

came from the 23 delegates of Los
Angeles. The average delegation
had only five votes.
