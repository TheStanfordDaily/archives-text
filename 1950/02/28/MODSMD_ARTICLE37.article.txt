## On The Bench 
### 
California lost a close basketball game Friday night to the battling Bruins
of UCLA. Saturday night Stanford lost to the same five cage troopers. The
Cal lolk got very unhappy about the officiating of their ball game, and it is
no secret that many deep within the Cardinal cage circles were none too
pleased with one certain official.
The gent under fixe is Lou Stringer, a baseball player of sorts who earns
his winter pin money by reffing PCC cage contests. When t first heard of
some ol the things I'm printing this morning, I said, "Oh no, not Lou " I
mnembered Stringer as a happy-go-lucky sort of an individual who had
raised cain with the Bears one night last year when we dumped the Pricers
in Berkeley. I kinda liked the guy.
II what has been reported to me—through three very reliable sources—
is true, 1 don't think I like Lou any more.
I'irst of all, however, I want to point out that this is no sour grapes job. I
think the Bruins, whose names might be mentioned below, are a great bas
ketball team. Easily the best on the Coast. 1 think that Geqrge Stanich,
whose name may be mentioned below, is a fine sportsman and competitor.
1 think that Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden, whose name might be mentioned
below, is a truly great basketball coach. He, too, is all kinds ol nice ad
jectives—including efficient.
These adjectives do not necessarily apply, in my opinion, to Lou Stringer
whose name will certainly appear below—as a basketball referee. We
won't go into his sack ability with ye olde baseball club.
What'* the Moan?
About this time you ask, "What's the moan?' Well, here it is. The moan
.started in Berkeley last Friday night when, I'm told, ridiculously negligent
rofereeing on (he 1 part of Stringer caused the lowly Bears to lose a basket
ball game that they might have normally had in the bag. It carried on in
the Stanford Pavilion when the better Bruins might have lost again, to a
ccllar team (presently) if it had not been for some unusually unusual ol
ficiating on the part of the rel named Stringer.
First of all, doctor, here are the symptoms of this dread disease which we
will choose to call "Stringeritis." The disease is not too contagious, as the
victim usually doesn't last long enough in the sport to infect others.
It is reported that:
1. Rel' Stringer traveled north to officiate the Stanford and Cal games
v/ilh the UCLA basketball team. Played cards (not bridge) with the kids
from Westwood. I don't know if he won or lost.
2. Kef Stringer had lunch before the Stanford game and dinner after the
Stanford game with the UCLA basketball team at the expense ol the UCLA
basketball team.
His Whistle
li. That during the Bruin-Indian game when several of the Card team
asked Stringer to watch a few things that the Bruins were pulling (Yard
ley's leg included) that were frowned upon in the rule book. Stringer re
plied and 1 quote roughly—"This is my whistle and I'll blow it when and
if I want to."
4. When George Stanich grabbed Yardley's leg under the basket and
pulled him to the floor tor the most obvious loul of the night, Rel Stiingei
ran up to Yardley and said; "That was your lault —the toul son you. Just
then George Stanich stepped up and said apologetically, Sorry, Geoige, it
was my fault, I won't let it happen again. Jump ball, cried the tius
t rated Ref Stringer.
5. When Eddie Sheldrake, Bruin play-maker, had his fifth foul called on
him by the other referee, Coach Johnny Wooden shouted at Stiingei. What
do you think you're doing?" To which Ret Stringer replied, Sorry, Johnny,
I didn't call the foul. I know it's his fifth one."
Hut these are only symptoms ol the dread "Stringeritis. The viius that
causes it may be a little harder to trace.
Hoslon Hall (Hub
One suggested cause of the effect (and I m quoting the basest oi rumors)
is that a certain major league baseball team, from Boston, is very, very
anxious to get UCLA's top cage star to sign a hosshide contract. Lou Stringer
works for that Boston ball club.
1 personally don't go for that rumor. I don t think that Biuin coach
Wooden, the player involved, or the University of California at Los Angeles
would allow such a thing to go on under any circumstances. They don t
need irregular reffing to win ball games.
An opinion, gleaned from good sources, is that Stringer doesn t care about
Basketball. The game. Stringer, it is said, refs for money only and that is
not a good situation to have exist in major collegiate sports. Secondly, these
good sources also tell me, Stringer sets himself up as an arbitrary judge of
the rules of basketball. He not only calls them as he sees them, but also as
it amuses him to call them. This, likewise, is not a good situation.
It's a funny thing, but I'm not the least bit mad at anybody. Not even
Stringer. I guess he does the best he can. I do think, however, that his con
tinued existence on the basktball court is unwise if these alleged practices
continue. There are some good referees around—even in the Southland,
which has long had a dearth of the better ones. Stringer, somehow, doesn't
match up. Maybe he tries to be too nice a guy. Maybe he doesn't know any
thing about refereeing.
At any rate, he isn't a very good ref.
Honest, Mr. Schmidt.

it amuses him to call them. This, likewise, is not a good situation.
It's a funny thing, but I'm not the least bit mad at anybody. Not even
Stringer. I guess he does the best he can. I do think, however, that his con
tinued existence on the basktball court is unwise if these alleged practices
continue. There are some good referees around—even in the Southland,
which has long had a dearth of the better ones. Stringer, somehow, doesn't
match up. Maybe he tries to be too nice a guy. Maybe he doesn't know any
thing about refereeing.
At any rate, he isn't a very good ref.
Honest, Mr. Schmidt.
California lost a close basketball game Friday night to the battling Bruins
of UCLA. Saturday night Stanford lost to the same five cage troopers. The
Cal lolk got very unhappy about the officiating of their ball game, and it is
no secret that many deep within the Cardinal cage circles were none too
pleased with one certain official.
The gent under fixe is Lou Stringer, a baseball player of sorts who earns
his winter pin money by reffing PCC cage contests. When t first heard of
some ol the things I'm printing this morning, I said, "Oh no, not Lou " I
mnembered Stringer as a happy-go-lucky sort of an individual who had
raised cain with the Bears one night last year when we dumped the Pricers
in Berkeley. I kinda liked the guy.
II what has been reported to me—through three very reliable sources—
is true, 1 don't think I like Lou any more.
I'irst of all, however, I want to point out that this is no sour grapes job. I
think the Bruins, whose names might be mentioned below, are a great bas
ketball team. Easily the best on the Coast. 1 think that Geqrge Stanich,
whose name may be mentioned below, is a fine sportsman and competitor.
1 think that Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden, whose name might be mentioned
below, is a truly great basketball coach. He, too, is all kinds ol nice ad
jectives—including efficient.
These adjectives do not necessarily apply, in my opinion, to Lou Stringer
whose name will certainly appear below—as a basketball referee. We
won't go into his sack ability with ye olde baseball club.
What'* the Moan?
About this time you ask, "What's the moan?' Well, here it is. The moan
.started in Berkeley last Friday night when, I'm told, ridiculously negligent
rofereeing on (he 1 part of Stringer caused the lowly Bears to lose a basket
ball game that they might have normally had in the bag. It carried on in
the Stanford Pavilion when the better Bruins might have lost again, to a
ccllar team (presently) if it had not been for some unusually unusual ol
ficiating on the part of the rel named Stringer.
First of all, doctor, here are the symptoms of this dread disease which we
will choose to call "Stringeritis." The disease is not too contagious, as the
victim usually doesn't last long enough in the sport to infect others.
It is reported that:
1. Rel' Stringer traveled north to officiate the Stanford and Cal games
v/ilh the UCLA basketball team. Played cards (not bridge) with the kids
from Westwood. I don't know if he won or lost.
2. Kef Stringer had lunch before the Stanford game and dinner after the
Stanford game with the UCLA basketball team at the expense ol the UCLA
basketball team.
His Whistle
li. That during the Bruin-Indian game when several of the Card team
asked Stringer to watch a few things that the Bruins were pulling (Yard
ley's leg included) that were frowned upon in the rule book. Stringer re
plied and 1 quote roughly—"This is my whistle and I'll blow it when and
if I want to."
4. When George Stanich grabbed Yardley's leg under the basket and
pulled him to the floor tor the most obvious loul of the night, Rel Stiingei
ran up to Yardley and said; "That was your lault —the toul son you. Just
then George Stanich stepped up and said apologetically, Sorry, Geoige, it
was my fault, I won't let it happen again. Jump ball, cried the tius
t rated Ref Stringer.
5. When Eddie Sheldrake, Bruin play-maker, had his fifth foul called on
him by the other referee, Coach Johnny Wooden shouted at Stiingei. What
do you think you're doing?" To which Ret Stringer replied, Sorry, Johnny,
I didn't call the foul. I know it's his fifth one."
Hut these are only symptoms ol the dread "Stringeritis. The viius that
causes it may be a little harder to trace.
Hoslon Hall (Hub
One suggested cause of the effect (and I m quoting the basest oi rumors)
is that a certain major league baseball team, from Boston, is very, very
anxious to get UCLA's top cage star to sign a hosshide contract. Lou Stringer
works for that Boston ball club.
1 personally don't go for that rumor. I don t think that Biuin coach
Wooden, the player involved, or the University of California at Los Angeles
would allow such a thing to go on under any circumstances. They don t
need irregular reffing to win ball games.
An opinion, gleaned from good sources, is that Stringer doesn t care about
Basketball. The game. Stringer, it is said, refs for money only and that is
not a good situation to have exist in major collegiate sports. Secondly, these
good sources also tell me, Stringer sets himself up as an arbitrary judge of
the rules of basketball. He not only calls them as he sees them, but also as
it amuses him to call them. This, likewise, is not a good situation.

anxious to get UCLA's top cage star to sign a hosshide contract. Lou Stringer
works for that Boston ball club.
1 personally don't go for that rumor. I don t think that Biuin coach
Wooden, the player involved, or the University of California at Los Angeles
would allow such a thing to go on under any circumstances. They don t
need irregular reffing to win ball games.
An opinion, gleaned from good sources, is that Stringer doesn t care about
Basketball. The game. Stringer, it is said, refs for money only and that is
not a good situation to have exist in major collegiate sports. Secondly, these
good sources also tell me, Stringer sets himself up as an arbitrary judge of
the rules of basketball. He not only calls them as he sees them, but also as
it amuses him to call them. This, likewise, is not a good situation.
It's a funny thing, but I'm not the least bit mad at anybody. Not even
Stringer. I guess he does the best he can. I do think, however, that his con
tinued existence on the basktball court is unwise if these alleged practices
continue. There are some good referees around—even in the Southland,
which has long had a dearth of the better ones. Stringer, somehow, doesn't
match up. Maybe he tries to be too nice a guy. Maybe he doesn't know any
thing about refereeing.
At any rate, he isn't a very good ref.
Honest, Mr. Schmidt.
California lost a close basketball game Friday night to the battling Bruins
of UCLA. Saturday night Stanford lost to the same five cage troopers. The
Cal lolk got very unhappy about the officiating of their ball game, and it is
no secret that many deep within the Cardinal cage circles were none too
pleased with one certain official.
The gent under fixe is Lou Stringer, a baseball player of sorts who earns
his winter pin money by reffing PCC cage contests. When t first heard of
some ol the things I'm printing this morning, I said, "Oh no, not Lou " I
mnembered Stringer as a happy-go-lucky sort of an individual who had
raised cain with the Bears one night last year when we dumped the Pricers
in Berkeley. I kinda liked the guy.
II what has been reported to me—through three very reliable sources—
is true, 1 don't think I like Lou any more.
I'irst of all, however, I want to point out that this is no sour grapes job. I
think the Bruins, whose names might be mentioned below, are a great bas
ketball team. Easily the best on the Coast. 1 think that Geqrge Stanich,
whose name may be mentioned below, is a fine sportsman and competitor.
1 think that Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden, whose name might be mentioned
below, is a truly great basketball coach. He, too, is all kinds ol nice ad
jectives—including efficient.
These adjectives do not necessarily apply, in my opinion, to Lou Stringer
whose name will certainly appear below—as a basketball referee. We
won't go into his sack ability with ye olde baseball club.
What'* the Moan?
About this time you ask, "What's the moan?' Well, here it is. The moan
.started in Berkeley last Friday night when, I'm told, ridiculously negligent
rofereeing on (he 1 part of Stringer caused the lowly Bears to lose a basket
ball game that they might have normally had in the bag. It carried on in
the Stanford Pavilion when the better Bruins might have lost again, to a
ccllar team (presently) if it had not been for some unusually unusual ol
ficiating on the part of the rel named Stringer.
First of all, doctor, here are the symptoms of this dread disease which we
will choose to call "Stringeritis." The disease is not too contagious, as the
victim usually doesn't last long enough in the sport to infect others.
It is reported that:
1. Rel' Stringer traveled north to officiate the Stanford and Cal games
v/ilh the UCLA basketball team. Played cards (not bridge) with the kids
from Westwood. I don't know if he won or lost.
2. Kef Stringer had lunch before the Stanford game and dinner after the
Stanford game with the UCLA basketball team at the expense ol the UCLA
basketball team.
His Whistle
li. That during the Bruin-Indian game when several of the Card team
asked Stringer to watch a few things that the Bruins were pulling (Yard
ley's leg included) that were frowned upon in the rule book. Stringer re
plied and 1 quote roughly—"This is my whistle and I'll blow it when and
if I want to."
4. When George Stanich grabbed Yardley's leg under the basket and
pulled him to the floor tor the most obvious loul of the night, Rel Stiingei
ran up to Yardley and said; "That was your lault —the toul son you. Just
then George Stanich stepped up and said apologetically, Sorry, Geoige, it
was my fault, I won't let it happen again. Jump ball, cried the tius
t rated Ref Stringer.
5. When Eddie Sheldrake, Bruin play-maker, had his fifth foul called on
him by the other referee, Coach Johnny Wooden shouted at Stiingei. What
do you think you're doing?" To which Ret Stringer replied, Sorry, Johnny,
I didn't call the foul. I know it's his fifth one."
Hut these are only symptoms ol the dread "Stringeritis. The viius that
causes it may be a little harder to trace.
