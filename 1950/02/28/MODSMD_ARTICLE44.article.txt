# Federalists to Discuss New Petition Campaign
## 
### 
The Stanford Student Federalists
are holding an open meeting tomor
row evening at 7:30 in the Women's
; Clubhouse to discuss their new pe
tition drive to support world leder
j ation.
The project includes the signing
of petitions in all living groups urg
ing an American foreign policy to
j give the "fullest support to the
United Nations and its transforma
-1 tion into a world federal govern

ment capable of enacting, interpret
ing, and enforcing world law to
maintain peace."
Support for the bills embodying
these ideas now before the House
and Senate is also urged.
These petitions, along with more
accumulated in other universities
and schools, will be picked up by a
student car caravan beginning in
San Diego and ending in Sacra
mento during spring vacation. Dur
ing the summer another caravan
will take them across the nation to
Washington where they will be de
livered to Congress. Cars will join
the caravan all along the route,
some coming from as far as Alaska.
Any students interested in joining
either of these caravans should call
Lee Langan at Branner or Gordon
Graham at Toyon.
