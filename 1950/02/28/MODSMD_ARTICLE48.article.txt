# Aluminum Suits Under Way At Drama Dept. for 'Yankee'
## 
### 
Aluminum suits with rivets arc
the latest fashion in Memorial Au
ditorium these days.
The reason for the new style is
the Stanford Players' production of
"A Connecticut Yankee," which will
be performed March 9, 10, and 11.
Suits o! armor built out of alumi
num sheets riveted together are be
ing constructed for the play in Me
morial Auditorium. Including the
metal models, more than 200 cos
tumes will be created for the Rodg
ers and Hart musical comedy based
on a novel by Mark Twain.
The "Connecticut Yankee" calls
for modern costumes, court cos
tumes. factory costumes, and over
50 samba costumes thrown in for
good measure.

The play opens in a modern hotel
I room in Hartford, Conn., and then
J shifts to the halls of King Arthur.
Here the Yankee, played by George
! Denny, takes over the kingdom and
| starts running things in a modern
I manner.
The time is set as the sixth cen
tury, but neither Rodgers, Hart, nor
Mark Twain stressed historical ac-
I curacy for the manners and cus
j toms which they satirized.
The costumes, the largest number
i ever used in a Stanford Players'
production, are being designed by
Virginia Opsvig. Members of the
i Speech and Drama Department
class in costuming arc constructing
the costumes, with a little outside
help to drive in the rivets.
