The question, "Resolved, that a
1 democratic society should prohibit
the propaagtion of anti-democratic
philosophies," was narrowly de
feated iysl night in Cubherley Audi
torium by a visiting debating team
from the University of California.
The Stanford Debating Society up
held the affirmative.
Anatole (i. Ma/.otir, associate pro
fessor of hi.story, acted as moderator
and introduced the speakers. Wer
ner Wolfen and I l 'red Harvey rep
resented California, and David
Lea v ill and Alan Kiilhoven spoke
for Stanford.
Knthoven began his arguments by
defining the terms of the subject,
and then went on to assert that a
political and economic waiÂ» was al
ready under way between the Unit
ed States and Russia.
WoMen, the lirsi. speaker from
j California, slated that democracy
| becomes a "carefully guarded 11111-
| seuni piece" when it refuses to al
low a "free interplay of ideas." ('it
1 i/ens who are assumed to be in
telligent enough to vote must also
:be considered intelligent enough to
) discover for themselves what lliey
i think," he added.
For the affirmative, Leavitf ar
gued thai minority lights are essen
tial, but that the minority has no
| right lf> destroy a system which ae-
I tua'ly protects them.
Harvey, the second constructive
I speaker for the negative, boleivcd
thai anti-democratic philosophies, if
freely discussed, would stimulate
j "the (i pathetic and unthinking to
! concern themselves more seriously
with the maintenance of their de
, moeracy.
In a debate tonight with the Uni-
J versity of San Francisco in Room
210 ol the History Building, Stan
i ford will consider the question, "Re
solved, that the United States
should nationalize all basic non-
I agricultural industry."
