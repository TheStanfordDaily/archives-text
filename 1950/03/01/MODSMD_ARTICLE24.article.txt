## 
### 
Dr. Robert L. Kyhl, Research As
sociate, Microwave Laboratory, at
Stanford, will address the meeting
of the Naval Volunteer Research
Unit on the campus tonight at 8 in
Room 280, Engineering Building.
Dr. Kyhl will speak on "High En
ergy Particle Acceleration," and will
discuss the principles of the opera
tion of the Stanford Linear Electron
Accelerator as well as the cyclotron,
synchrotron, bevetron, VandergrifTe
accelerator, and other instruments
of atomic research.
'Ihe speaker is in charge of the
construction of the one-bil!ion-volt
linear electron accelerator at the
Microwave Laboratory at Stanford.
Dr. Kyhl worked at the Radiation
Laboratory of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology during the
war.
He took his undergraduate train
ing at the University of Chicago
and his Ph.D. degree at MIT in 1947.
After the war, but before coming
to Stanford, Dr. Kyhl was at the
Research Laboratory of Electronics
