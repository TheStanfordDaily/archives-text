# Chiang Resumes Role As China's President
## Li Replaced as Nationalists' Spirit Surges with Hope for Comeback 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa, Wednesday, March 1 (AP) —Chiang Kai-Shek
today formally resumed the presidency of what remains of Na
tionalist China. The Generalissimo had "retired" 13 months ago.
Chiang announced yesterday in a swift but not unexpected
move that he would take over today. His action probably ended

the political crisis with Li Tsung-Jen,
who had been acting president since
Chiang quit.
Li, recuperating from a stomach
operation in New York, is not ex
pected to contest Chiang's official re
turn to power.
Li is free to remain in the United
States as long as he likes, but he re
verts to his old position of vice-presi
dent. Li left for the U.S. about four
months ago.
In a brief statement, Chiang said he
had decided to return because "the
world situation has changed for the
worse," especially since the Chinese
Communists signed their treaty of al -
liance with Russia earlier this month
While the constitutionality of
Chiang's move is questionable, all
quarters predicted everything will
pass off smoothly. He has been run
ning the government.
Chiang's decision to return to the
presidency came after long and fruit
less efforts by various officials to get
Li to say positively whether he was
returning or resigning.
His indecision provoked anger even
among many of his former supporter:-.
Chiang quit in January of 194;)
when the Nationalist fortunes wen
at a low |bb. His popularity seemed
just as low,
Now, the Nationalist fortunes are
even lower, but there is a strange re
surgence of spirit. When the govern •
ment fled the mainland to Formosa
its final doom seemed near.
But the alrfurce developed a new
wallop. The navy stayed loyal and
maintained a fairly effective block
ade of Shanghai and points south.
Ground forces on Formosa were re
organized and trained,
Hainan, the big Nationalist island
off the south China coast, held off
invasion. Chusan Island, blockade
headquarters 100 miles south of
China, was developed as an air and
naval base.
Hopes for an eventual comeback
stirred. Last week Chiang promised
an invasion of the mainland and the
execution of Red leader Mao Tze-
Tung as a traitor.
