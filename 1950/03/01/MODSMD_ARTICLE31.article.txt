# UC Loyalty Oath
## 
### 
The Board ol Regents o( the University of
California, alter a secret meeting last Friday,
decided that employees of their university
would either take an anti-Communist oath or
(J»'t out.
In a statement presented to the UC faculty
by the regents, climaxing a year of argument
between the two groups over whether the oath
should be mandatory, the jegents declared
that:
". . . as trustees for the people of California,
they must continue to saleguard the freedom
of the university against ruthless, fanatical and
subversive minorities in the body politic, such
as the Communist Party . .
It seems to us that the regents have dealt a
body blow to that very lreedorn ol the univer
■ ity which they seek to "safeguard."
Academic, intellectual freedom is the lift.*
blood of a university . . . the staple diet of re
search and learning. Jt is the only atmosphere
in which a superb faculty can exist and flour
i.sli. And it is on the basis of its faculty that a
university is reckoned great or mediocre.
Faculty members at (JC feel that this man
datory oath is a move against their academic
and intellectual freedom.
They have declared their loyalty to the Con
stitution of the United States and the Stdte of
California in an oath required of public offi
< ials by the state.
Now the faculty is ordered to renew this

oath and swear that they neither belong to the
Communist Party nor are committed to any
agreement that is in conflict with the Regents'
policy excluding Communists from the faculty
of the university.
In the first place, this oath is an unnecessary
indignity in view of the previous declaiation
of loyalty.
Secondly, by requiring this oath the regents
imply that UC abounds in Communist sympa
thies, engendering an atmosphere of distrust
that can only harm-the university.
Communists should not be permitted to
teach. There is no argument on that question,
and the UC faculty lias offered to support the'
regents in barring them from leaching posi
tions.
But this policy cannot be carried out by
forcing a professor, who has already sworn to
uphold his country and his state, to swear that
lie is not a Communist.
And you can't catch a Communist by hold
ing a club over his head until he swears that
he isn't a Communist.
Finally, you don't have a great university
without a great faculty. And you don't have a
great faculty without academic freedom.
When the research, learning, and teaching
resources of an American university are im
paired, the Kremlin has a red feather for its
cap.
