Mr. Wieners Letter
To the Editor:
Joseph Stalin the Immortal" has got a new devoted
admirer and apologist: A certain Mi - . Don Wiener in
In:, recent letter to the editor gets excited because Dr.
Bertram Wolfe in his- lecture on last Friday "seemed
to be disturbed about Stalin's conscious plans of ac
tion."
This "plans of action" which put millions of free
<lorn-loving men and women into Siberian concentra
tion camps, which reestablished torture and inquisi
tion behind the Iron Curtain and represent history's
mo t formidable threat to the life and security of Rus
â€¢ la's neighbors and even to the American people, seem.s
to find Mr. Weiner's absolute sympathy.
Mr. Wiener seems to be even proud of Stalin's "real
i; ni" and the fact that Stalin knows "what he is doing
..nd how much he can do" to destroy the freedoms of
the Russian people and the great heritage of Western
Liberty.
The Nazi-Period has taught us that our security
must not be based upon humble subservience under
tlie demands of totalitarian dictators but upon pro
; restive political and economical achievements of de
mocracy.
Wiener must have slept deep and sweet when Mr.
Wolfe quoted numerous copies of Russian dailies in
oider to demonstrate the day in and day out Byzantine
praise of Stalin's superman-qualities. (Wiener stated
namely that all these quotations were only from the
'lay of Stailin's birthday.;
However, the entire audience felt the speaker's hu
mane feelings for the Russian people, not excluding
those unjustly purged or herded in concentration
camps.
Actually, the striking difference between Mr.
Wolfe's lecture and Mr. Wiener's letter lies in the fact
that the former expressed his deep sympathy for the

Russian people and the latter for the Soviet leaders.

To the Editor:
It is regrettable that Don Wiener did not enjoy the
Bertram Wolfe lecture last Friday evening. The fault,
we suggest, was nut with Mr. Wolfe, who gave an ex
cellent and informative lecture, but with Mr. Wiener,
whose critique shows a lack of comprehension and
analysis. To illustrate:
1. Mr. Wiener complains that the lecture did not aid
him in understanding "the situation." The lecture did
not purport to cover the Russian question as such, il'
this is the "situation" to which Mr. Wiener refers.
Mr. Wolfe's subject was "Stalin, the Man, His Place
in History." We .submit, however, that within the
limits of this topic may be the real answer to the gen
eral Russion question. Mr. Wolfe also devoted a full
45 minutes to an open question period. Questions were
answered thoroughly and completely. Mr. Wiener had
a fair opportunity to put forth any specific questions
he had at that time.
2. Mr. Wiener suggests that he and other univer
sity students want to "knpw what is behind the situa
tion they are trying to understand." Is Mr. Wiener
consistent in wanting to understand "Stalin, the Man,
His Place in History" and yet. objecting to discussions
of:
a. Stalin's early political activities in Georgia;
I). Stalin's "conscious plan of action" on the na
tionality issue, Russian expansion, and his own glori
fication as leader of the Russian Communists;
c. Stalin's divergence from the principles of Lenin;
d. Stalin's program of self-glorification as illus
trated by the recurrent eulogies of Stalin dominating
the front pages of Pravda.
Does Mr. Wiener feel that any discussion of "Stalin,
the Man, His Place in History" would be complete
without including the above topics, which he sum
marily dismisses as irrelevant?
