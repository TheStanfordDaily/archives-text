## Editor's Note.—This is the third in a series of features on campus

Stanford Sadie isn't all.
There is more to be found at KZSU than the notorious Stanford
seductress. Over 100 eager students now gather at the offices
and studio in Memorial Hall to learn about radio.
Some members plan to go into commercial radio, as several
KZSU "alumni" have done. Others♦

join the campus station for the
work, the zero-hour frenzy, and the
Friday night parties.
With announcers, engineers, writ
ers, producers, office workers, sales
men, musicians, and publicity men
joining forces, KZSU takes to the
air on 880 kilocycles every night ex
cept Saturday.
KZSU offices, in the basement,
come to life each day at about 1
p.m. At that time someone from the
"traffic" department ("traffic" ar
ranges and files all scripts, makes
out the night's schedule) may drop
in to do some work.
By 4 p.m. the offices are going
strong. Much of the work goes to
ward shows for the next day. But
current problems are constantly
sprouting up.
A "continuity" writer or two
(continuity is script-writing) begins
to hammer at a typewriter. A sales
man sticks his head in the door and
asks for Ed Wilson, sales manager.
Tony Mottola, "man of a thousand
voices," enters disguised as Peter
Lorre. Chuck Black, station mana
ger, sits at his desk, and a crowd
prods him with questions. Mary
Hill, ex - station manager, is also
mobbed.
At 7 p.m. the largest carrier-cur
rent station in the West finds its
voice. Operations shift from the
basement offices to the upstairs stu
dios. Seated at a modern HCA con
sole, a "board engineer" twists dials
and gives the go-ahead signal. Be
yond two panes of glass, in the
sound - proof studio, an announcer
says, "Good evening. This is radio
station KZSU—"
Four hours, many programs, and
many headaches later, KZSU signs
off for the night.
