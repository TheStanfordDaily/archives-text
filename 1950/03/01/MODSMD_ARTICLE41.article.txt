# Miss Pat to Give Talk On Chile Experiences
## 
### 
Miss Patricia Davidson, former
YWCA director at Stanford, will
talk informally on her experiences
as a "Y" worker in Chile at a
brunch given by the YWCA Satur
day morning at 10 in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
All "Y" members are invited to
attend this general meeting, said
member Marge Gavin, which will
also include a humorous skit acted
by various cabinet members.
