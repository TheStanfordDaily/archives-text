## Midweek Musings

(lonioozin* hut Auioo/in*
We present herewith our nomination for the weirdest basketball game of
all time. It was played in 1949 between two small eastern schools; so small,
in fact, that we've forgotten their names. But the rest of the facts we'll
vouch for.
The two teams in question were tied 12 times during the regulation play
ing time, the last knot being a G2 to 62 scoreboard reading at the end of the
second half. Four overtime periods were consumed. At the end of each the
scoreboard told the same story: tie ball game. Finally, after the lilth over
time, the scoreboard at last showed a differential. Final score, 100 to 99.
But after the weary players had retired to their dressing rooms for their
well-earned showers, the official scorekeepers checked their books for a
routine tally. Check and recheck as they might, the boys with the books
i kept turning up with the same terrible answer. The final count, scoreboard
o)' no, was 99 to 99.
An entire week elapsed before the situation was officially settled. Then
ilil- team that had lost on the scoreboard agreed to accept that version; and
the madcap contest was entered in the NCAA records as a 100 to 99 ball
game.
Don't Discount the Dons
The University of San Francisco Dons last night all but clinched an invi
to! ion to defend their National Invitational Tourney title at Madison Square
Garden later this month. The Dons beat St. Mary's last evening in what
should be their last game before the coveted bids are mailed.
So, il future events follow their expected course, the hustling Hilltoppers
will once again carry the hopes of the Pacific Coast in what is probably the
most colorful cage conclave of all. However, the Dons will not be favored to
i ( peat their surprise win of 1949; on the contrary, they will doubtlessly be
distinct underdogs in the Big City.
Nevertheless, we'd like to point out a few facts concerning Pete Nevvell's
alert haskcthallers which might have some important hearing on their
Manhattan showing.
In spite of the Dons' so-so record this year, they have in many instances
displayed a brand of basketball that can be properly classified as near-great.
For one thing, the Hilltoppers sewed up USC and Bill Sharman as no other
team has done this year. And when San Jose State was mentioned as a
possible choice over the Dons for an NIT bid, the Newellmen responded by
handing the Spartans a thrashing the latter are likely never to lorget. The
final score of this contest, incidentally, gives no indication ot USF s true
superiority; for the Dons finished the massacre at quarter-speed after flash
ing to an early 24 to 3 lead and resting on a 150 to 11 margin at halftime.
Furthermore, USF lias gone through practically the whole season with
hut one tall man on the (irst live —Don Lofgran has carried the entire
hackhonrd burden since Joe McNamee broke his hand in one of the early
games. That's quite a load, especially as Lofgran has also been counted on
as No. I point maker.
But McNamee will be back in action lor the eastern invasion; and while
towering Joe cannot be expected to be in lop form after the long layoff, his
height will certainly prove of great advantage. The man he'll replace on the
starting five, forward Jerry Hickey, has been the weak link for the Dons all
year; so even if at less than full effectiveness, McNamee will certainly aid
the cause.
What we're trying to say is, don't count our Coast representatives out of
the running. They surprised before and they could do it again.
It's All-Star Time Again
We've overheard quite a bit of oral speculating concerning a mythical all-
California basketball team. Such speculation always begins with the names
ot George Yardley and Bill Sharman; and we might as well offer our nomi
nations for the remaining three posts.
Perhaps some prejudice in regard to our noxt-to-favorite team, the afore
mentioned hustling Hilltoppers. is involved in the choices; but we'd pick
two Dons on our mythical five. Don Lofgran is the smoothest, hardest
working pivotman to show on the Coast in some time, and is certainly the
superior of any around this year.
And at one guard spot we like Frank Kuzara. who started the season as a
substitute for veteran Ross Guiclice, but has since become the Dons' top
playmaker. Not only has Kuzara this year outshone even running mate
Kene Herrerias in the matter of ball-rustling and general floor play; the
vest-pocket guard has also proven himself a scoi:ng threat of the 20-point
plus variety.
For the filth spot, we're choosing Stu Inman, who led San Jose to one of
its most successful seasons. Inman is the floor leader of the Spartan five, a
rugged rebounder, and a deadly pointmaker.
Westwooders George Stanich, Carl Kraushaar, and A 1 Sawyer, and Cal's
Bob Walker are the other names that pop up rather consistently during all
star conversations. But we'll stick with the team named above.

team has done this year. And when San Jose State was mentioned as a
possible choice over the Dons for an NIT bid, the Newellmen responded by
handing the Spartans a thrashing the latter are likely never to lorget. The
final score of this contest, incidentally, gives no indication ot USF s true
superiority; for the Dons finished the massacre at quarter-speed after flash
ing to an early 24 to 3 lead and resting on a 150 to 11 margin at halftime.
Furthermore, USF lias gone through practically the whole season with
hut one tall man on the (irst live —Don Lofgran has carried the entire
hackhonrd burden since Joe McNamee broke his hand in one of the early
games. That's quite a load, especially as Lofgran has also been counted on
as No. I point maker.
But McNamee will be back in action lor the eastern invasion; and while
towering Joe cannot be expected to be in lop form after the long layoff, his
height will certainly prove of great advantage. The man he'll replace on the
starting five, forward Jerry Hickey, has been the weak link for the Dons all
year; so even if at less than full effectiveness, McNamee will certainly aid
the cause.
What we're trying to say is, don't count our Coast representatives out of
the running. They surprised before and they could do it again.
It's All-Star Time Again
We've overheard quite a bit of oral speculating concerning a mythical all-
California basketball team. Such speculation always begins with the names
ot George Yardley and Bill Sharman; and we might as well offer our nomi
nations for the remaining three posts.
Perhaps some prejudice in regard to our noxt-to-favorite team, the afore
mentioned hustling Hilltoppers. is involved in the choices; but we'd pick
two Dons on our mythical five. Don Lofgran is the smoothest, hardest
working pivotman to show on the Coast in some time, and is certainly the
superior of any around this year.
And at one guard spot we like Frank Kuzara. who started the season as a
substitute for veteran Ross Guiclice, but has since become the Dons' top
playmaker. Not only has Kuzara this year outshone even running mate
Kene Herrerias in the matter of ball-rustling and general floor play; the
vest-pocket guard has also proven himself a scoi:ng threat of the 20-point
plus variety.
For the filth spot, we're choosing Stu Inman, who led San Jose to one of
its most successful seasons. Inman is the floor leader of the Spartan five, a
rugged rebounder, and a deadly pointmaker.
Westwooders George Stanich, Carl Kraushaar, and A 1 Sawyer, and Cal's
Bob Walker are the other names that pop up rather consistently during all
star conversations. But we'll stick with the team named above.

We present herewith our nomination for the weirdest basketball game of
all time. It was played in 1949 between two small eastern schools; so small,
in fact, that we've forgotten their names. But the rest of the facts we'll
vouch for.
The two teams in question were tied 12 times during the regulation play
ing time, the last knot being a G2 to 62 scoreboard reading at the end of the
second half. Four overtime periods were consumed. At the end of each the
scoreboard told the same story: tie ball game. Finally, after the lilth over
time, the scoreboard at last showed a differential. Final score, 100 to 99.
But after the weary players had retired to their dressing rooms for their
well-earned showers, the official scorekeepers checked their books for a
routine tally. Check and recheck as they might, the boys with the books
i kept turning up with the same terrible answer. The final count, scoreboard
o)' no, was 99 to 99.
An entire week elapsed before the situation was officially settled. Then
ilil- team that had lost on the scoreboard agreed to accept that version; and
the madcap contest was entered in the NCAA records as a 100 to 99 ball
game.
Don't Discount the Dons
The University of San Francisco Dons last night all but clinched an invi
to! ion to defend their National Invitational Tourney title at Madison Square
Garden later this month. The Dons beat St. Mary's last evening in what
should be their last game before the coveted bids are mailed.
So, il future events follow their expected course, the hustling Hilltoppers
will once again carry the hopes of the Pacific Coast in what is probably the
most colorful cage conclave of all. However, the Dons will not be favored to
i ( peat their surprise win of 1949; on the contrary, they will doubtlessly be
distinct underdogs in the Big City.
Nevertheless, we'd like to point out a few facts concerning Pete Nevvell's
alert haskcthallers which might have some important hearing on their
Manhattan showing.
In spite of the Dons' so-so record this year, they have in many instances
displayed a brand of basketball that can be properly classified as near-great.

vest-pocket guard has also proven himself a scoi:ng threat of the 20-point
plus variety.
For the filth spot, we're choosing Stu Inman, who led San Jose to one of
its most successful seasons. Inman is the floor leader of the Spartan five, a
rugged rebounder, and a deadly pointmaker.
Westwooders George Stanich, Carl Kraushaar, and A 1 Sawyer, and Cal's
Bob Walker are the other names that pop up rather consistently during all
star conversations. But we'll stick with the team named above.
(lonioozin* hut Auioo/in*
We present herewith our nomination for the weirdest basketball game of
all time. It was played in 1949 between two small eastern schools; so small,
in fact, that we've forgotten their names. But the rest of the facts we'll
vouch for.
The two teams in question were tied 12 times during the regulation play
ing time, the last knot being a G2 to 62 scoreboard reading at the end of the
second half. Four overtime periods were consumed. At the end of each the
scoreboard told the same story: tie ball game. Finally, after the lilth over
time, the scoreboard at last showed a differential. Final score, 100 to 99.
But after the weary players had retired to their dressing rooms for their
well-earned showers, the official scorekeepers checked their books for a
routine tally. Check and recheck as they might, the boys with the books
i kept turning up with the same terrible answer. The final count, scoreboard
o)' no, was 99 to 99.
An entire week elapsed before the situation was officially settled. Then
ilil- team that had lost on the scoreboard agreed to accept that version; and
the madcap contest was entered in the NCAA records as a 100 to 99 ball
game.
Don't Discount the Dons
The University of San Francisco Dons last night all but clinched an invi
to! ion to defend their National Invitational Tourney title at Madison Square
Garden later this month. The Dons beat St. Mary's last evening in what
should be their last game before the coveted bids are mailed.
So, il future events follow their expected course, the hustling Hilltoppers
will once again carry the hopes of the Pacific Coast in what is probably the
most colorful cage conclave of all. However, the Dons will not be favored to
i ( peat their surprise win of 1949; on the contrary, they will doubtlessly be
distinct underdogs in the Big City.
Nevertheless, we'd like to point out a few facts concerning Pete Nevvell's
alert haskcthallers which might have some important hearing on their
Manhattan showing.
In spite of the Dons' so-so record this year, they have in many instances
displayed a brand of basketball that can be properly classified as near-great.
For one thing, the Hilltoppers sewed up USC and Bill Sharman as no other
team has done this year. And when San Jose State was mentioned as a
possible choice over the Dons for an NIT bid, the Newellmen responded by
handing the Spartans a thrashing the latter are likely never to lorget. The
final score of this contest, incidentally, gives no indication ot USF s true
superiority; for the Dons finished the massacre at quarter-speed after flash
ing to an early 24 to 3 lead and resting on a 150 to 11 margin at halftime.
Furthermore, USF lias gone through practically the whole season with
hut one tall man on the (irst live —Don Lofgran has carried the entire
hackhonrd burden since Joe McNamee broke his hand in one of the early
games. That's quite a load, especially as Lofgran has also been counted on
as No. I point maker.
But McNamee will be back in action lor the eastern invasion; and while
towering Joe cannot be expected to be in lop form after the long layoff, his
height will certainly prove of great advantage. The man he'll replace on the
starting five, forward Jerry Hickey, has been the weak link for the Dons all
year; so even if at less than full effectiveness, McNamee will certainly aid
the cause.
What we're trying to say is, don't count our Coast representatives out of
the running. They surprised before and they could do it again.
It's All-Star Time Again
We've overheard quite a bit of oral speculating concerning a mythical all-
California basketball team. Such speculation always begins with the names
ot George Yardley and Bill Sharman; and we might as well offer our nomi
nations for the remaining three posts.
Perhaps some prejudice in regard to our noxt-to-favorite team, the afore
mentioned hustling Hilltoppers. is involved in the choices; but we'd pick
two Dons on our mythical five. Don Lofgran is the smoothest, hardest
working pivotman to show on the Coast in some time, and is certainly the
superior of any around this year.
And at one guard spot we like Frank Kuzara. who started the season as a
substitute for veteran Ross Guiclice, but has since become the Dons' top
playmaker. Not only has Kuzara this year outshone even running mate
Kene Herrerias in the matter of ball-rustling and general floor play; the
vest-pocket guard has also proven himself a scoi:ng threat of the 20-point
plus variety.
For the filth spot, we're choosing Stu Inman, who led San Jose to one of
its most successful seasons. Inman is the floor leader of the Spartan five, a
rugged rebounder, and a deadly pointmaker.
Westwooders George Stanich, Carl Kraushaar, and A 1 Sawyer, and Cal's
Bob Walker are the other names that pop up rather consistently during all
star conversations. But we'll stick with the team named above.
