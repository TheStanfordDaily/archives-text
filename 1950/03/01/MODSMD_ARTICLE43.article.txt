### HOWARD SEARS 
Bob Burnett's frosh basketballers
began practice for the last games of
their season last night as they ran
through some extensive drilling on
set-plays, ball control, and deliber
ate floor work.
The Papooses play Friday and
Saturday evenings aaginst the Cal
frosh in preliminary games to the
varsity tiffs. In the first series be
tween the two, played early last
month, the local yearlings fell twice
before the Bear Cubs. They lost
in the Pavilion 45 to 31, and in the
Berkeley gym 56 to 28.
The Cubs' season total now stands
at 22 wins without a single loss. If
they make it past the Stanford hoys
this week they will have completed
an undefeated season and will go on
record as one of the greatest frosh
teams in California's history.
The Farm's entries, on the other
hand, have played 18 games and
sport a 15 and 3 record. Besides the
losses to Cal, they slipped up on
their second game of the season and
lost to Fremont High of Oakland 43
lo 35.
Besides the games against Stan
ford, Cal has played only high
school competition. None of these
has given the Cubs much trouble.
(Although they were held scoreless
for six minutes by Polytechnic last
week, Cal won 51 to 29.)
