# Track Hopes High As Work Begins

### JOHN ARNOLD 
With the first frosh track meet only
a little over a month away, the con
troversial questions concerning the
specific abilities of National Decath
lon champ Bob Mathias are well on
their way to being answered. After
his Olympic victory in '48 track side
observers wondered whether the
versatile Mathias. despite his overall
ability, was outstanding enough in
any one event to become a college
star.
Freshman track mentor Ray Dean
supplied a good portion of the an
swers when he pointed to the shot put
and discus marks chalked up by
Mathias already in early-season
workouts.
The Stanford freshman discus rec
ord is 151 ft. and Mathias has already
Hipped the platter 155 ft. In the shot,
the record stands at 48 it. 7'4 in. and
there Boh has registered a 47 ft. 8 in.
toss.
Throughout the season Dean plans
to alternate the events that Bullet
Bob will participate in, never allow
ing him to enter more than three.
Possible events for Mathias include
besides the shot and discus, the jave
lin, the low hurdles, and the pole
vault.
This year's freshman team could
be the best since pre-war days. As
Dean himself said: "We seem to have
much more depth than usual." And
behind that statement lies the secret
of this squad.
One of the really bright stars on
the horizon seems to be a speedy
miler out of Pomona, named Bob Si
mon, who cruises the distance in
4:30.1. In the discus burly Chuck
Rcnfro out of Fallon, Nevada, has
already hung up a mark of 150 ft.
Another fine prospect is high jumper
Norman Jiles, with a mark of 6 ft.
4',2 in. Add to these a 51 - flat 440
man from Lowell High named Bill
Friedrichs, and you have the nu
cleus for a much-better-than-aver
age track team.
When footballers Joe St. Geme and
Bob Iloegh round into track shape
both should be extremely valuable.
St. Geme while in high school was
clocked at :50.7 in the quarter and
Moegh is a pretty fair country hur
dler.
Dean summed up the strength of
his squad by pointing to the depth
and ability they possess in the
weights. It will take a pretty husky
hunch of bovs to break up the com
bination that Dean has in these
events.

With the first frosh track meet only
a little over a month away, the con
troversial questions concerning the
specific abilities of National Decath
lon champ Bob Mathias are well on
their way to being answered. After
his Olympic victory in '48 track side
observers wondered whether the
versatile Mathias. despite his overall
ability, was outstanding enough in
any one event to become a college
star.
Freshman track mentor Ray Dean
supplied a good portion of the an
swers when he pointed to the shot put
and discus marks chalked up by
Mathias already in early-season
workouts.
The Stanford freshman discus rec
ord is 151 ft. and Mathias has already
Hipped the platter 155 ft. In the shot,
the record stands at 48 it. 7'4 in. and
there Boh has registered a 47 ft. 8 in.
toss.
Throughout the season Dean plans
to alternate the events that Bullet
Bob will participate in, never allow
ing him to enter more than three.
Possible events for Mathias include
besides the shot and discus, the jave
lin, the low hurdles, and the pole
vault.
This year's freshman team could
be the best since pre-war days. As
Dean himself said: "We seem to have
much more depth than usual." And
behind that statement lies the secret
of this squad.
One of the really bright stars on
the horizon seems to be a speedy
miler out of Pomona, named Bob Si
mon, who cruises the distance in
4:30.1. In the discus burly Chuck
Rcnfro out of Fallon, Nevada, has
already hung up a mark of 150 ft.
Another fine prospect is high jumper
Norman Jiles, with a mark of 6 ft.
4',2 in. Add to these a 51 - flat 440
man from Lowell High named Bill
Friedrichs, and you have the nu
cleus for a much-better-than-aver
age track team.
When footballers Joe St. Geme and
Bob Iloegh round into track shape
both should be extremely valuable.
St. Geme while in high school was
clocked at :50.7 in the quarter and
Moegh is a pretty fair country hur
dler.
Dean summed up the strength of
his squad by pointing to the depth
and ability they possess in the
weights. It will take a pretty husky
hunch of bovs to break up the com
bination that Dean has in these
events.
