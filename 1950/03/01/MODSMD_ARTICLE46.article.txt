# Bear Squad Undefeated As Rugby Big Game Nears
## Berkeley Is Site Of Saturday Tiff 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his rug
by charges through a stiff workout
yesterday afternoon as the Indians
prepared for the Big Game with
California next Saturday in Berke
ley. Word from the Berkeley hills
indicates that Doc Hudson's blue
and gold fifteen rates on a par with
last year's championship squad.
The Bears boast an undefeated
record this season which inculdes
victories over the University Club
(8-0) and UCLA (17-8), and a tie
with the Olympic Club ((5-6). Cal
has been the perennial king of West
Coast rugby since the war, but
losses through graduation have
made this year's team more depend
ent on weight and aggressiveness
than on skill and finesse.
Cullom Gone
Gone are Jim "Truck" Cullom,
Wilbur Lenz, George Irwin, Hank
Wright, and John Elliot. Cullom,
last year's ace place kicker and a
rough boy in the scrum, decided to
forego rugby this season in favor of
turning pro, so he could participate
in that great grid classic fit Lodi.
Two-year lettermen include Mike
McGuire, Bob Lo.sey, and Bob
Kniptash. The Bears' big offensive
gun is Australian student Max
Howell, who is a constant break
away threat. It was Howell who sal
vaged a tie in the Olympic Club
game when he broke loose for a 40-
yard gallop to put the Bears in
scoring position.
The forward division is well sup
plied with heft as Les Richter, Ed
Bartlett, Roy Ward, John Miksits,
and Die LemMon use their football
experience to good davantage.
Cards in Top Shape
On the home front it appears that
the Indians will be at full strength
for Satui day's tilt, two regulars
having returned to the fold. Scrum
half Bill Geary is back in action,
having shaken off his charley horse,
and Wing Boyd Benson has recov
ered from the cold which sidelined
him last weekend.
Ed Culin is down with the flu but
should be ready by Saturday. The

only two men who are definitely out
are Ralph Davidson with a back in
jury and Darrhl Dentoni with a
broken leg.


HUSTLING JACK O'SULI.IVAN,
who received his first starting as
signment during the first Califor
nia series, will be counted on
heavily by Coach Everett Dean
when Cal and Stanford square off
in the season windups this
weekend.
