TJSF and San J use State will pro-"*
vide Coach Everett Dean's rampag- !
j ing varsity baseballers with their '
| first collegiate opposition of the year I
j this week.
The Dons of USF, coached by '
basketballer Pete Newell and S.F. !
Seal Con Dempsey, will make an
appearance on the Sunken Diamond '
toomrrow afternoon beginning at
I 3:15. Perennially strong San Jose
State will be on hand Saturday. |
Starting time for this game will be
2:30.
The Indians have a fifty-fifty. .500
I won-lost percentage for the four
j games played so far this year. Last |

Saturday they shelled the semi-pro
Moffat Mantecas 10 to 8, after drop
ping an earlier decision to the Ber
j govich's and splitting a pair with
the St. Louis Browns Rookies.
If good weather continues through
Saturday and the Cards are able to
cheat the rains out of two more
games, they will have been success
ful in playing six out of their first
seven scheduled games. This is ex

actly the reverse of what happened
last winter when the Stanford var
sity was rained out of six straight
games.
The experience that the Indians
are gaining in these early - season
games should show up when they
make their season - opening tour
south during spring vacation.
