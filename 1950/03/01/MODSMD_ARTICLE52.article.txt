# Farm Cagers In PA Tourney

### 
The Batt'e of Restaurant Row
gets under way tonight at 9:30 in
Kezar Pavilion when Dinah's Shack
and L'Omelette meet to decide
which team will enter the final
round of the Pacific Association
basketball tourney.
In L'Ommie's the Shackers will
meet a team with 32 wins in 35
games over a two-year period in
the Palo Alto league. It is a vet
eran - stocked team featuring the
Kceler brothers â€” Norm and Bob.
Norm is probably the best player
in the area outside of Stanford's
George Yardley. Last year L'Ome
lette won five games in the P.A.
tourney only to meet and lost', after
a hard-fought battle, to the Oak
land Blue and Gold in the final
round.
Jack Winslow and Tom Randolph
of the newly organized Dinah's will
alternate at the job of guarding
Norm Keeler, while John Hall will
draw brother Bob. Other members
of the starting line-up will be Don
Stitos. only Dinah's regular over <>
It. 1 in., and Bob Sanguinetti.
Derek Bok and Len Hughes will
see early action for the Shackers, as
both lads can hit well from far out
and that is just what the shorter
Dinah's team will have to do if they
are to stick with the taller and
more experienced L'Omelette five.
