# Braner to Hold Dance, Carnival
## 
### 
The Medical School quartet and
dancer Alice Niven will entertain at
the Branner formal Saturday night.
Dancing will be to the music of
Burt Whiting and his orchestra.
Branner women may now purchase
bids, at $2, from Branner senators.

Tonight's Branner Carnival will
feature a shoe-shine booth, beauty
parlor, a shoo't-the-sponsor booth,
and other concessions. The Carni
val, a closed affair, is being held to
raise money for the scholarship
fund. It will be held in the Branner
lobby from 9 to 10 p.m.
