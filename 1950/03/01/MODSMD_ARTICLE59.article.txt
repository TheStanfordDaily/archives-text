# Art Collector Will Give Talk
## 
### 
Frederick Brasch, former consult
ant in bibliography at the main li
brary of Staijford, will discuss a
collection of portrait prints of Sir
Isaac Newton, now on display, at 4:15
p.m. today in the Art Gallery.
Collecting prints of Newton has
been a hobby of Brasch's. He has
now donated these prints to the
Stanford library. More portraits are
said to have been done of Newton
than of any other scientist.
