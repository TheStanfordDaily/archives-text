## Controversy in China 
### 
NEW YORK, March 1 (/I')â€”Dr. Li
Tsung-jen today declared himself
slil! President of Nationalist China
and warned Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek not to "usurp" the post.
Chiang already announced from
the Natoinalist island refuge of For
mosa that he was "resuming" the
presidency which he resigned a year
ago last January.
Thus the Nationalists, driven from
their homeland by the Chinese
Communist advance, split at the top
even as they talked of going home
some day in victory.
Li, in this country for medical
treatment, called Chiang a dicta
tor, accused him of "high-handed
autocratic action," and denounced
what he called an "insidious plot"
to seize power.
