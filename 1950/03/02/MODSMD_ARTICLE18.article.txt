### DIXIE BOOTH 
On Saipan, Iwo, Kwajalein,

in their program in Memorial
Hall last night.
The ex-Gl's, members of the do
Paur Infantry Chorus, sang with high
vitality and precision under the ex
tremely resourceful direction of
Leonard de Paur.
The 34-man ensemble did not con
centrate on spirituals but presented
music of the many lands visited dur
ing the war. "La Llorona," a Mexi
can Huapango, was introduced with
an astonishingly abrupt attack, and
the mood was carried into the calmer
"Vidalita," both in Spanish.
"The Song of (he French Parti
san," a quietly meaningful piece,
was followed by the very familiar
"I've Got a Sixpence."
The .sine control of voices which
have sung together for a long time
was displayed in the stirring rendi
tion of "Mcadowlands." "Roger
Young," the traditional infantry song,
was another outstanding selection.
The chorus swung intp full stride
with their spirituals and work songs,
including the tender "Deep River,"
"Listen to the Lambs," and "Tol' My
Cap'n." "Water Boy," ils "hammer
swinging rhythm," and "Jerry (Lord,
dis Timber Gotta Roll) were given
with relish.
"Hospodi Pomiloi," an incredible
Russian chant, and the richly effec
tive "Lord's Prayer" concluded the
program.
The chorus returned for encores,
'Bless the Lord, Oh My Soul," and
the Air Force version of "The Whif
fenpoof Song."
