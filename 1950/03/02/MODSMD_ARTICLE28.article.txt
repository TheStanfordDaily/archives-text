# BRITISH COLONIAL COURT SYSTEM
## Poor Interpreters Hinder True Justice 
### DAVID WONG 
There arc few things I admire
more than British justicc. If I've
heard it said once, I've heard it said
fifty times that the British court is
primarily a court of justice and only
secondarily a court of law. The
British judicature has made it a
practice never to deal with cases in
a cold, judicial liuht. but always lo
temper justice with mercy.
One learned magistrate whom I
know once sentenced a man to a
year's imprisonment for simple lar
ceny.
Upon the sentence being pro
: nounccd, the wife of the defendant
stepped forward with an entourage
I of weeping children. She told His
! Worship a pathetic talc of the la
mentable state of the family finances
and envisaged insufferable hard
ships for herself and her children
' should her husband be sent to gaol
I (jail) for so long a period.
The compassionate magistrate was i

moved by the tale "112 woe. IJe im
mediately ordered that two hun
dred dollars from the court funds be
given to the unfortunate woman;
but he did not reduce her husband'. 1
sentence by a single day. That is an
example of British justice.
But this highly esteemed judicial
system is greatly weakened when it
is applied to the British colonics.
The cause of this weakening lies not
with the judicial system itself, but
rather with the colonial govern
ments.
The major portion of the popula
tion of the colonies must necessarily
bo formed by the natives of those
places. But the official language of
the colonial courts remains English.
And since few of the natives of the
colonics can speak English suffi
ciently well to defend themselves in
legal proceedings, the necessity for
court interpreters arises.
The governments of the colonics
have always been under some ter

rible fear of overpaying their public
servants. To prevent any .such ca
tastrophe from ever occurring, they
have kept the wages of their em
p'oyecs at the barest possible mini
mum.
Not the least atnonc these public
servants are the court interpreters.
The salaries for court interpreters
can by no stretch of the imagination
be considered attractive. Hence na
tives with a mastery of English have
found it more profitable to utilize
their talents in other fields, and thus
the positions of court interpreters
are left to those whose standard of
English cannot even be considered a
fair mediocrity.
It is a sorry state of affairs when
the administration of justice de
pends so much upon the ability of
these court interpreters to interpret
correctly, since most of the judges
and magistrates do not understand
the native tongues.
Too often have I heard statements

badly interpreted in colonial courts,
find occasionally I've seen defend
ants convictcd on the strength of
mi;.interpreted statements.
I do not for a moment suggest that
the interpreters purposely misinter
preted the statements. It is just that
they arc incapable of rendering
more exact interpretations.
Perhaps this shortcoming can he
remedied to a ccrain extent by ap
pointing "local men" to the bench,
men who are familiar with both the
native and the English languages.
However, for places like Malaya,
where the native population is made
up of many nationalities, evn such
a step will not alleviate the situa
tion. for every jurist cannot be ex
pected to know three or four differ -
ent languages as well as a multi
plicity of dialects.
Therefore, the only solution ap
pears to be the increasing of the
salaries for court interpreters so as
to make it worth while for compe
tent men to accept such posts.

There arc few things I admire
more than British justicc. If I've
heard it said once, I've heard it said
fifty times that the British court is
primarily a court of justice and only
secondarily a court of law. The
British judicature has made it a
practice never to deal with cases in
a cold, judicial liuht. but always lo
temper justice with mercy.
One learned magistrate whom I
know once sentenced a man to a
year's imprisonment for simple lar
ceny.
Upon the sentence being pro
: nounccd, the wife of the defendant
stepped forward with an entourage
I of weeping children. She told His
! Worship a pathetic talc of the la
mentable state of the family finances
and envisaged insufferable hard
ships for herself and her children
' should her husband be sent to gaol
I (jail) for so long a period.
The compassionate magistrate was i

moved by the tale "112 woe. IJe im
mediately ordered that two hun
dred dollars from the court funds be
given to the unfortunate woman;
but he did not reduce her husband'. 1
sentence by a single day. That is an
example of British justice.
But this highly esteemed judicial
system is greatly weakened when it
is applied to the British colonics.
The cause of this weakening lies not
with the judicial system itself, but
rather with the colonial govern
ments.
The major portion of the popula
tion of the colonies must necessarily
bo formed by the natives of those
places. But the official language of
the colonial courts remains English.
And since few of the natives of the
colonics can speak English suffi
ciently well to defend themselves in
legal proceedings, the necessity for
court interpreters arises.
The governments of the colonics
have always been under some ter

rible fear of overpaying their public
servants. To prevent any .such ca
tastrophe from ever occurring, they
have kept the wages of their em
p'oyecs at the barest possible mini
mum.
Not the least atnonc these public
servants are the court interpreters.
The salaries for court interpreters
can by no stretch of the imagination
be considered attractive. Hence na
tives with a mastery of English have
found it more profitable to utilize
their talents in other fields, and thus
the positions of court interpreters
are left to those whose standard of
English cannot even be considered a
fair mediocrity.
It is a sorry state of affairs when
the administration of justice de
pends so much upon the ability of
these court interpreters to interpret
correctly, since most of the judges
and magistrates do not understand
the native tongues.
Too often have I heard statements

badly interpreted in colonial courts,
find occasionally I've seen defend
ants convictcd on the strength of
mi;.interpreted statements.
I do not for a moment suggest that
the interpreters purposely misinter
preted the statements. It is just that
they arc incapable of rendering
more exact interpretations.
Perhaps this shortcoming can he
remedied to a ccrain extent by ap
pointing "local men" to the bench,
men who are familiar with both the
native and the English languages.
However, for places like Malaya,
where the native population is made
up of many nationalities, evn such
a step will not alleviate the situa
tion. for every jurist cannot be ex
pected to know three or four differ -
ent languages as well as a multi
plicity of dialects.
Therefore, the only solution ap
pears to be the increasing of the
salaries for court interpreters so as
to make it worth while for compe
tent men to accept such posts.
