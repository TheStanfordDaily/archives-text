# Trustees To Appoint Union Planning Group
## Student Committee Tells Excom Work Should Begin by June 1951 
### 
A Board of Trustees committee will be appointed soon by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling to make complete plans for the future Stan
ford Union. This progress, as well as a report on an interviev/
with the University president was presented to Excom last night
by the Student Union Planning Committee.
The four committee members were John Lilienthal, Jack Little,

>-Hank Rosin, and Dan Stone.
Tentative plans, Sterling told the
committee last week, call for con
struction to start on the first unit in
June 1951. The estimated cost of the
unit is $500,000.
At present, donations have
amounted to $300,000.
Regarding the name of the pro
posed Union, Sterling said, the first
unit will probably be known as the
Tresidder Unit, and that future ad
ditions to the Stanford Union will be
named in honor of other Stanford
leaders.
First Unit
The first unit is to include a ball
room, restaurant, bowling alley, or
any other facilities needed immed
iately.
The definite location has not been
decided upon, Sterling told the stu
dent committee. However, the Cor
i poration Yard, Bookstore, and French
House areas have all been consid
ered.
Sterling said the actual Union
Planning Policy would be in the
hands of the Board of Trustees. The
Student Union Planning Committee
will he used only for research.
ASSU President Hank Rosin, who
presented the report to Excom, said,
"So far, nothing has been done to
wards actually planning the Union,
but money will be accumulated in
the future."
Action Postponed
He said action on the Union pro
posals has been postponed "because
there have been more pertinent
problems facing the administration."
Rosin said he will recommend that
the ASSU president and the business
manager form a "go-between" be
tween students and the Trustees.
Jack Little added that although
nothing has been done on the project
during the past two years, it "seems
to have high priority towards get
ting the attention of the Adminis
tration."

1. Approved April 19 and 26 as
dates for the primary and final spring
