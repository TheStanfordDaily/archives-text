# Canoe Tipping on Lake Lag
## 
### 
Spring lever is wonderful up to a certain
i xtent. However, when overexuberance gels
out ot line the results) are often too bad.
Ii has come to our attention that recently
thf ie has been a lot of unnecessary dunking
and tipping of canoes at the lake. It has re
suited in fun foi some, arid in damayed casli
nn.-ies, watches, and lighters for others.
We think it is obvious that there are dangers
involved in tippiny canoes. Aside from colds
â– iiid possible infections that may be contracted
hi the cold Lake Lay water, often someone is
hit Ly the canoe or the paddles and seiiously
injured,
innocent bystanders mid iiOn-swimmeis are
often disturbed by the current rowdyism, and
sometimes even unwillingly involved.
Our safety rules do not permit nonswimmers

in canoes at all. This seems to have been ior
yotten by many of those who complain the
loudest. Also, swimming is not allowed be
yond the markers, and therefore those dunked
outside the safe area have to get back by swim
ming where it is danyerous.
The canoes thmselves suffer considerably
by constantly being full of water. It seems in
dicative of the behavior around the Boathouse
that most of the canoes belonginy to girls'
residences are more often than not in need of
repairs because of leaks since girls are usu
ally the victims of dunking.
The lifeguards' duty at the lake is not to stop
rowdyism, but to see that nobody drowns.
Therefore, i! is the duty of every person at the
Jake to improve the present situation.
Hy cooperation and a little self-restraint im
provement can certainly be achieved. S.E.T.
