### BILL DAILEY 
In the spring a BuJI Sessionser's fancy lightly turns
to thoughts of . . .
. . , . THE WEATHER .... and h e wonders if
perhaps Mr. Spring has retained Attorney Jerry (!eis
k r to get him "sprung" a month ahead of .schedule.
.... THE WEATHER REPORTS .... and he de
cides whether tomorrow will be sunny by .scanning
the reports on the front page .... a front page whose
I lightening tales of H-bomb races seem strangely in-

congruous with a weather report
which predicts widespread sun
bine for all.
.... THE BEACH PARTIES
. . . and he thinks of those won
derful Sundays ahead, with their
trange combination of Ijeer cans
-lid textbooks. The .surest way to
I ell the beer from the books is that
the beer is opened during the
■ ourse of the day.
.... THE SIIN PORCH ....

. here he lies down equipped with a textbook and good
intentions, only to wake up three hours later with i
r.roiled skin and no advance in scholarship (Beyond
ilit- knowledge that he will inevitably fall ~ !<•» ,< un
der these circumstances.)
.... THE NIGHT BEFORE A TEST .... which
is alvyays a time for remorse and repentance lor such
loafers as he. And he sighs, "Ah . . . Sprint' Quar
ter." Then he realizes that it is still Winter Quarter,
but that Spring Quarter will bring more of (be :,amo

indolence and inm«l .scrambling I'oi lli.it lust little fact
that will get him past the test.
.... Till: OOU' ( OURSE .... and he dreams of
the city boy hitting the I.all a country mile, which is
approximately 1j,200 feet fui llier than he will actually
move the pellet. (Or, as Bill Stern might say it:"por
trait nl' a wayward 'class cutter' hitting a 'grass
cutter'.")
.... LAKI'i I.AOI !NITA .... anil he wonders
how long it will be before the water will be a little
wuimer than it;; present temperature, which is about
as low as tin grade he got on his last examination.
.... Tin: < OIION DRESSES .... and he thinks
how fresh and crisp they look; how their honesty of
design often complementing the fresh charm of many
of our girls.
.... A "BREAKER" at ICIO DEE MAIt .... and
he recalls how many times he has misjudged the
"break" and has been sprawled on the beach like the
proverbial drunken sailor.
.... Tin: TRACK MEETS AMI) TIIK BASEBAEE
OAMES .... and he thinks of the Saturday after
noons he will tpend seeing first, the tracksters and
then the horsehiders.
.... nit: exchange beer busts .... and
be marvel:, at the efficiency with which that "1i.2"
makes an exchange beer bust so much fun, in marked
contrast with its oh-,so-boring first cousin, the ex
change dinner.
.... And he thinks of all these things as early as
March 2nd as he sits in front of a typewriter trying
to concentrate on the late lamented art of humor.
