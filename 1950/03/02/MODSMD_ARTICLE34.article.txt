### JOHN HALL 
Country club life is breaking out all over tlie place
ll:*-se days. In fact, all sorts of things have been break
ing out.
It might he the fact that the sun is shining, or that
they're playing jazzy Gaieties music at the Cellar, or
,\.i e r 112 -.11 r j .. ..

I hal ;i few million gallons ol water
are rippling over the Big Game
Bonfire remains, or maybe it's just
tin- mood.
I hit, whatever it is, it's spread
ing like a 12-cent jar of mustard.
Nut that I'm complaining, you
understand. It's just that it's all
lather distracting. You can't just
r* Lix anymore, you have to relax
Letter than anybody else.
Take this guy—Bob Davis—at
tl.e l ake lor instance. Some people

art? satisfied to take their sun treatment while sitting
on a plain old beach towel or on a worn out army
blanket. But not Davis. He has a cot that he drags out
'.M (he Boathouse boards every day. 1 lis late:-,!, maneu

ver was to mount the cot on an untippable raft and
drift around the Lake while Hal on his back. So far,
nobody has come close to equaling his genius.
That's the way it's been going all week. Golf hats,
tennis shoes, and all those kinds of things have been
getting play.
All I've got to say is that some people really know
how to live, while others just try. But like they say,
there':; never any harm in trying.
QUICK LAUGHS IN THE MIDDLE OF TIIE
WEEK: I get a kick out of watching the guys with ihe
Tar/an eyes walking through Quad every lime a girl
walks by, they swing from limb to limb.
Or, how about the Ruble- girl who tlied to act like
Gregory Peck the other night -she came home at 12
o'clock high.
And with that, I toss my typewriter in the ashcan,
steal silently out. of The Daily Shack, and start look
ing for a new job.
Some days an ju I like that.
