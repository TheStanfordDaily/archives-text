# Indian Baseballers to Meet USF Dons This Afternoon
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Baseballers from the University of San Francisco will be on
hand in the Sunken Diamond this afternoon to provide the Stan
ford varsity with its first collegiate competition of the year. Game
| time will be 3:15.
It will be the first game of the season for the Dons and the

; fifth for Stanford. The Indians have
| won two and lost two against semi-
I pro teams so far this year.
As of yesterday afternoon, Coach
Everett Dean hadn't settled on a
starting pitcher, but it is likely that
Jack Heinen will get the nod if he
is ready. Tom Pagee, a tall leftâ€”
j hander who did well in relief roles
| last year, is expected to open on the
mound for USF.
Lineup Juggled
Battles have developed for a num
ber of positions on the Stanford
lineup with the result that the
coaches are juggling the starting

nine nearly every game in an attempt
to determine the best combination.
The infield picture is the most un
settled and it is doubtful if any of
the positions other than shortstop
will be nailed down much before the
CIBA season gets under way during
spring vacation.
Bud Klein, the converted out
fielder. has been doing well around
first base, but will have to work hard
to beat out the three basketballing
first basemen, Dick Clegg, Harry Hu
gasian, and Jim Walsh, when they
report Monday. Klein has been hit
ting exceptionally well this year, and
is a cinch to be in. the lineup some
place, but it may not be on first.
Battle For Second
Down at second a two-way battle

rages between Tom Shaw, the foot
j bailer, and Ait Abrahamson, up from
I last year's frosh. Both have been
doing a good job in the field, and
Shaw's hitting hag been one of the
blight .spots in the team's showing
thus far,
Dave Melton, the slugging co
captain, is a fixture at shortstop, but
clown at third a hot battle is raging
between Bruce Cameron, a reserve
last year, and Jim "Doc" Mason, who
lettered at second base two seasons
ago.
Blond Bruce Iverson, who played a
lot of third base for the frosh last
year, is.a third possibility.
Cas Shelved
The catching chores are being di
vided between Bill Heir on and soph
omore Dick Corzine. Herron is an
adequate backstop, but he hasn't
shown much at the plate thus far.
Not to be counted out is Jim Cas
tagnoli, last year's starter, who has
been sidelined with a shoulder in
jury since the East-West Shrine
Football Game. Cas is expected to
be ready to go in a couple more
weeks.
Charlie Cole, Bob Larson, and John
Claypool have been starting in the
outfield, but the picture may change
before the league season starts.
Veteran Clyde Dingfelder and soph
Tony Stellar are possibilties, as are
first baseman Bud Klein and Dick
Clegg.
Too Many Walks
Pitching hag been below par thus
far, but that's to be expected this
early in the season. Claypool, Ham
ilton, and Heinen have shown good
stuff when they can get it over,
which hasn't been too often. A record
of 29 bases on balls in 36 innings
pitched speaks for itself.
The USF Dong are predominantly
a sophomore team, and not many of
the vets who divided last year's ser
ies with Stanford, 0 to 5, and 10 to 7.
are still around. Exceptions are
shortstop John Dunne and second
sacker Pete Maloney who make up
what Assistant Coach Joe Mocha de
scribes as the best keystone combi
nation in collegiate baseball.
Mocha Coaches Dons
Other veterans in the Hilltoppers'
lineup are right fielder John Vick
who played first base last year, and
Joe Wozniak, left fielder.
The club is being coached by Joe
Mocha, a former Don star, who will
be in charge until Pete Newell fin
ishes with basketball.
Don Liebendorl'er, Athletic News
Director for Stanford, promises that
a public address system will be avail
able for this and for all subsequent
games. As an added attraction Stan
ford will wear its new white home
uniforms for the first time today.
