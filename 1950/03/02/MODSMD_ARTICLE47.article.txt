# Frosh Diamonders To Open Season Against Sequoia
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseballers,
after a few practice skirmishes with
the jayvees, open their 1950 season
today when they battle Sequoia
High School at 3:15 on the frosh
diamond.
The frosh, described by Coach
Charley Bushong as "a team with
rich potential but needing a great
deal of work," will meet a stiff foe
in the Sequoia Cherokees. Sequoia,
always a power in the Peninsula
Athletic League, will probably start
Tom Dal Sarto against the Card
babes. Dal Sarto, a husky south
paw fireballer, is reputed to be the
best chucker in his league.
Into opposition with Dal Sarto
will go Bob Murphy, another fast
bailer, who hit .500 while playing
third base for San Mateo High last
year. In case Murphy needs assist
ance, Ron Boyer and Jim Powell
will be standing in the wings.
Tentatively starting for the frosh
will be (in order of their batting
appearance): Gene Shirley, left field;
C'ayton McGill, first base; Dick
Cole, shortstop; A 1 Stellar, center
field; Murphy, pitcher; John Knoep
pel, third base; Jack Pouting, light
eld; Boh Worth, second base and
Norm Rundquist, catcher.
