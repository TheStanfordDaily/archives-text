### 
The word "terrific!" best describes
yesterday's swim session.
All afternoon Coach Tom Haynie
j smiled at the face of his stop watch
: and eagerly awaited he Indians' en
j training for the Southern Pacific
i Association Swimming and Diving
| Championships at Beverly Hills to
rn orrow.
Pete Cole, the sensational soph
| who improves with each time trial,
was clocked at 4:4G.8 for the quarter
-just eight-tenths of a second off
! Ralph Sala's all-time best. The on
looking Sala opined'that Cole stands
J a good chance of upsetting Olympic
Champ Wally Wo!f in this week-
I end's hostilities.
Bruce Putnam was the first Card
to break 53 seconds for the century
this year as he churned to a 52.4 in
I anchoring a practice relay yeserday.
| Bob Frojen, a breaststroker by
{trade, swam a 53.4 freestyle 100
after turning in a 2:26 in his spe
cialty the day before.
Cole will tangle with Wolf in both
the quarter and the furlong this
weekend and only by virtue of his
j experience could you call the Tro
j jan the favorite. His 220 times to
j date are equal to Cole's, but he re
j portedly has not broken 4:50 in the
! 440 yet this year. Neither man has
been pressed at any time this sea
son.
Stanford's strongest bid for team
j laurels will come from four power
j ful relay entries. Perhaps the most
potent of these is the medley relay
team of Weeden, Frojen, and Bob
WycofT now capable of 2:56.
Stanford's traveling squad will be:
Coach Tom Haynie; Ernie Polte (220
breast, 220 freestyle); Bob Frojen
(220 breast, 220 freestyle); Pete
Cole (220 freestyle, 440 freestyle);

! 440 yet this year. Neither man has
been pressed at any time this sea

Stanford's strongest bid for team
j laurels will come from four power
j ful relay entries. Perhaps the most
potent of these is the medley relay
team of Weeden, Frojen, and Bob
WycofT now capable of 2:56.
Stanford's traveling squad will be:
Coach Tom Haynie; Ernie Polte (220
breast, 220 freestyle); Bob Frojen
(220 breast, 220 freestyle); Pete
Cole (220 freestyle, 440 freestyle);
Hub Stokely (220 freestyle, 440
i freestyle); Jack Weeden (C) (150
I backstroke, individual medley);
Bruce Putnam (220 freestyle, 440
j freestyle, individual medley); Bob
WycofT (100 freestyle); Chuck Kelly
(100 freestyle); and Phil Chapman
1 (100 freestyle).
