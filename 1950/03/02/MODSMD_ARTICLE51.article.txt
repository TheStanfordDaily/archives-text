# Stanford Ruggers Ready for Bears
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
Stanford's high - scoring rugby
machine, well primed for an all-out
effort, will trot onto the turf of
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon to do battle with
the undefeated California ruggers.
The coast rugby title as we!l as
the Angell Trophy, which is award
ed annually to the winner of the
Cal-Stanford tussle, hinges on the
outcome of the contest, and the
Cards are determined to cut short
California's domination ir the sport.
Wei 1 - Balanced S<| uad
For the past three 3'cars the Bears
have downed the Cards by dint of
superior, offensive weapons. But
this year's Stanford fifteen is the
most well-rounded outfit the locals
have fielded since pre - war days.
The Indians are adequately supplied
with offensive strength as provided
by a quartet of backs, namely Boyd
Benson, Dick Hughes, Bill De-
Young, and Bill McColl. Benson and
Hughes furnish shiftiness and speed
while DeYoung and McColl provide
a combination of speed and power.
The important position of fullback
which involves mainly defensive
duties is we : l filied by Vance Shef
fey whose ability to kick while un
der pressure has not been hampered
by the loss of two teeth. Sheffey
tried to tackle McColl in an early
season practice session and unhap
pily watched his two front choppers
drop to the turf.
Veteran Forwards
The forward division Is composed
mostly of veterans who hope to
make their last shot at Cal a suc
cessful one. Captain Mike Spiro,
Sarge Littlehale, Ed Culin, John
Hosekrans, and Wes Poulson have
had plenty of experience and are
prepared to spend the afternoon
shoving the Boar forwards around.
Comparative scores, as usual,
prove little, but the Indians have
topped all common opponents by a
larger margin. The Cards downed
the Olympic C!ub twice, 1(5 to 11
and 3 to 0, while the Clubmen held
Cal to a G to 6 draw; Stanford rout
ed UCLA 32 to 0; Cal vanquished
the Bruins by a 17 to 8 count; and
finally the University Club suc
cumbcd 24 to 3 to Stanford while
the Bears had to be satisfied with
an 8 to 0 victory.

the Card ruggers tangle with Cali
fornia this Saturday in Berkeley.
Stanford's high - scoring rugby
machine, well primed for an all-out
effort, will trot onto the turf of
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon to do battle with
the undefeated California ruggers.
The coast rugby title as we!l as
the Angell Trophy, which is award
ed annually to the winner of the
Cal-Stanford tussle, hinges on the
outcome of the contest, and the
Cards are determined to cut short
California's domination ir the sport.
Wei 1 - Balanced S<| uad
For the past three 3'cars the Bears
have downed the Cards by dint of
superior, offensive weapons. But
this year's Stanford fifteen is the
most well-rounded outfit the locals
have fielded since pre - war days.
The Indians are adequately supplied
with offensive strength as provided
by a quartet of backs, namely Boyd
Benson, Dick Hughes, Bill De-
Young, and Bill McColl. Benson and
Hughes furnish shiftiness and speed
while DeYoung and McColl provide
a combination of speed and power.
The important position of fullback
which involves mainly defensive
duties is we : l filied by Vance Shef
fey whose ability to kick while un
der pressure has not been hampered
by the loss of two teeth. Sheffey
tried to tackle McColl in an early
season practice session and unhap
pily watched his two front choppers
drop to the turf.
Veteran Forwards
The forward division Is composed
mostly of veterans who hope to
make their last shot at Cal a suc
cessful one. Captain Mike Spiro,
Sarge Littlehale, Ed Culin, John
Hosekrans, and Wes Poulson have
had plenty of experience and are
prepared to spend the afternoon
shoving the Boar forwards around.
Comparative scores, as usual,
prove little, but the Indians have
topped all common opponents by a
larger margin. The Cards downed
the Olympic C!ub twice, 1(5 to 11
and 3 to 0, while the Clubmen held
Cal to a G to 6 draw; Stanford rout
ed UCLA 32 to 0; Cal vanquished
the Bruins by a 17 to 8 count; and
finally the University Club suc
cumbcd 24 to 3 to Stanford while
the Bears had to be satisfied with
an 8 to 0 victory.


DICK HUGHES, speedy Stanford
wing is expected to provide a great
deal of the olfiensive punch when
the Card ruggers tangle with Cali
fornia this Saturday in Berkeley.
