# Hoopmen's Final Fling
## 
### 
The Southern Division basketball
derby, all over but the shouting,
will start its final fling tomorrow
night in spite of the fact that the
championship flag has already been
tacked up over UCLA's Westwood
campus.
It'll be Stanford's last chance to
climb out of the loop cellar and sal
vage a slight smile out of the 1950
season which has seen the Cards
scrape up only two wins in ten
starts.
Everett Dean's casaba specialists
need a double victory over Cal this
weekend, in Berkeley tomorrow
night and at home in the Pavilion
Saturday night, to turn the trick.
Cal has a one-game bulge over
Stanford because of two victories
over USC.
As always, the Tribe will be lean
ing heavily on the trigger arm. of
George Yardley to supply the of
fense. Yardley's sizzling pace for
the past three weeks has established
him as one of the greatest scorers
the Southern Division has ever pro
duced.
He needs only to maintain his 22-
point average of the past five games
to crack Hank Luisetti's all - time
scoring record. And even if he
doesn't get that far, he is almost
certain to add at least 12 to his
present 188 to make him the third
man in history to score over 200
points.
While Stanford and Yardley are
aiming their guns at Cal's much
improved quintet, USC will be' get
ting its last chance to work over the
Bruins in Los Angeles. Already out
of the race, USC also has nothing
but a little honor to salvage out of
the present campaign.
The southland series will serve as
All-American foes, Bill Sharman of
a sounding board for the duel of the
Troy and Georgie Stanich of UCLA.
Bullseye Bill, who has been just
hitting the outer rim lately, still

j needs 28 points to puncture Luiset- j
: ti's 1938 standard. If he has the I
: same success against Stanich as he ;
did earlier in the season, Luisetti is
a gone quacker. Sharman made a ,
monkey out of Stanich to rack up j
; 31- and 19-point outings last time. |
There is a rumor going around j
over at the Pavilion these days that
Everett Dean plans to start the old i
vet, Gus Chavalas, against the
Bears.
Co-captain Chavalas, a four-year
block man, and a regular starter at
j the beginning of the season, has
j been conspicuously absent from any
! activity during the last two months,
j But always a deadly customer to the j
Cal crowd, Chavalas will probably |
get his starting job back for this
one.
j He will work with Slippery Jack
O'Sullivan at the guards, Jim Ram- j
i stead is set for center duty, and !
Yardley and Jim Walsh will handle
their usual forward spots.
It will be the last collegiate ap
pearance for Yardley, Chavalas, I
Ralph Carver (another hot item !
< when it comes to cooking Cal), Bill !
Warren (Sharman's shadow), and j
Gaylord Bryan (he may run some
! track this spring.)
The rest of the boys will be !
around for quite some time.
