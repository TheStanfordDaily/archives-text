PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAISE? Then you would be right at home in Maison Francaise on Santa
Teresa street. Here everyday conversation is carried on in the French tongue by the resident
students of the French Department. The house, formerly The Oaks, became a "language"
residence last fall. â€”Daily photo by Dave Rosenthal
