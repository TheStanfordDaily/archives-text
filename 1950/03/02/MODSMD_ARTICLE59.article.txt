# Girls in French House Study Parisian Language and Culture
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
Maison Francaise, after only five
months of existence, is last becoming
;m institution on campus.
The 16 girls who live in the French
house on Santa Teresa street, for
merly known as the Oaks, have a
variety of reasons for being there,
but (hev are all interested basically
in the same thing—the better under
standing of the French language, cul
ture, and people, and the spread of
interest in these things throughout
the Bay Area.
In their rambling house fronted by
large oak trees, the girls of MaiSon
Francaise are trying first of all to
gain proficiency in the French lan
guage. They speak French as much
as they can when together in the
house, and they have special tables in
the Union Dining Hall where they
speak that language throughout din
ner.
With the help of Mine. A. H. Dia
mond, resident assistant at the house,
the students are learning not only
the language, but also the culture of

b ranee. Mine. Diamond, an instruc
tor in the French Department, lived
in Bordeaux until coming to the
United States for college study. She
has been back to France several
times since then, but has continued
| to live here.
House Activities
The activities of Maison Franqaise
are designed to spread interest in
the house and in France throughout
this area, as well as to enter into
| the work of other organizations who
i have similar aims. Because of its
short existence, the group has spon
i sored but few functions so far.
These have included a tea last
quarter for interested persons in the
Bay Area, and an after-dinner coffee
for the French faculty of the Uni
! versity. Among the guests at the tea
were the French Vice-Consul from
San Francisco, and Andre, propric
j tor of L'Omelettc.
Future plans, according to Eliza
beth Bailly, newly-elected president
uf the house, include helping the I
Club with plans for an international
dinner in March. Mmc. Diamond
adds that the group hopes to sponsor

such activities as a lecture, enter
tainment of visiting French notables,
and a social for the Mills College
French faculty.
That the house has already at
tracted wide interest in the Bay Area
is demonstrated by French posters
on the walls, presented by the Street
Travel Agency; a map of Paris, given
by Dr. Frederick Anderson, head of
the French Department; and a fast
growing library of books in French,
mostly donated by the French Con
sulate in San Francisco and Dr. Wil
liam Schwartz of the Stanford French
Department.
Applications Considered
Miss Bailly explained that women
interested in living in the house
should apply at the French Depart
ment. Considerations for getting in
include time of application, year in
school, and special considerations,
as a scheduled trip to France in the
near future.
One of the many reasons for living
in the French house is to learn the
language well before traveling to
France. Jane Holmer intends to go
back next year to continue her
studies in Geneva, while Sally Scud
dcr plans to ro over with a Friends'
Service Group.
While these girls look forward to
trips to France, or talk over their
experiences there, many of the others
arc living in Maison Franqaise just
bccause they are interested in France
and the French language. Though
several of these are majors in the de
partment, this is not a requisite for
admittance to the house.

United States for college study. She
has been back to France several
times since then, but has continued

House Activities
The activities of Maison Franqaise
are designed to spread interest in
the house and in France throughout
this area, as well as to enter into
| the work of other organizations who
i have similar aims. Because of its
short existence, the group has spon
i sored but few functions so far.
These have included a tea last
quarter for interested persons in the
Bay Area, and an after-dinner coffee
for the French faculty of the Uni
! versity. Among the guests at the tea
were the French Vice-Consul from
San Francisco, and Andre, propric
j tor of L'Omelettc.
Future plans, according to Eliza
beth Bailly, newly-elected president
uf the house, include helping the I
Club with plans for an international
dinner in March. Mmc. Diamond
adds that the group hopes to sponsor

such activities as a lecture, enter
tainment of visiting French notables,
and a social for the Mills College
French faculty.
That the house has already at
tracted wide interest in the Bay Area
is demonstrated by French posters
on the walls, presented by the Street
Travel Agency; a map of Paris, given
by Dr. Frederick Anderson, head of
the French Department; and a fast
growing library of books in French,
mostly donated by the French Con
sulate in San Francisco and Dr. Wil
liam Schwartz of the Stanford French
Department.
Applications Considered
Miss Bailly explained that women
interested in living in the house
should apply at the French Depart
ment. Considerations for getting in
include time of application, year in
school, and special considerations,
as a scheduled trip to France in the
near future.
One of the many reasons for living
in the French house is to learn the
language well before traveling to
France. Jane Holmer intends to go
back next year to continue her
studies in Geneva, while Sally Scud
dcr plans to ro over with a Friends'
Service Group.
While these girls look forward to
trips to France, or talk over their
experiences there, many of the others
arc living in Maison Franqaise just
bccause they are interested in France
and the French language. Though
several of these are majors in the de
partment, this is not a requisite for
admittance to the house.
Maison Francaise, after only five
months of existence, is last becoming
;m institution on campus.
The 16 girls who live in the French
house on Santa Teresa street, for
merly known as the Oaks, have a
variety of reasons for being there,
but (hev are all interested basically
in the same thing—the better under
standing of the French language, cul
ture, and people, and the spread of
interest in these things throughout
the Bay Area.
In their rambling house fronted by
large oak trees, the girls of MaiSon
Francaise are trying first of all to
gain proficiency in the French lan
guage. They speak French as much
as they can when together in the
house, and they have special tables in
the Union Dining Hall where they
speak that language throughout din
