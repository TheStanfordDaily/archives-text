## Cal Committee Claims Loyalty Oath Damaging 
### 
BERKELEY, March 1 (A I )— Un
iversity of California will become a
second - rae institution if faculty
members are required to sign a non-
Communist oath, a faculty commit
tee said today.
The University Board of Regents
has told faculty members to siun
such an oath or get out. The oath
does not supplant, but is in addition
to, the oath required of all federal
and stale officers.
A committee of four, representing
the university's Academic Senate,
issued a statement it said was en
dorsed by 51 deans and department
chairmen. It said in part:
' A tragic error has been made
which, if not corrected, will reduce
the university to the status of a sec
ond-rate institution."
The statement declared that re
quiring faculty members to take an
oath "over and above the constitu
tional oath reflects on the loyalty
and integrity of the ftculty."
"This ultimatum—however it may
have been intended by the regents—
represents an open and flagrant vio
lation of the basic principle upon
which the greatness of a university
rests: that the freedom of the schol
ar and teacher is protected by the
right of tenure. Academic freedom
deos not exist where the right of
tenure is not inviolate."
The statement was issued over the
names of Wendell M. Stanley, Nobel
Prize winner in biochemistry; Mal
colm L. Davisson, professor of eco
nomics; Joel H. Hildebrand, dean
of the College of Chemistry; and
Robert A. Gordon, professor of eco
nomics.
