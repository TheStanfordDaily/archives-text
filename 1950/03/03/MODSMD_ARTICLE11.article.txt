# Senators Start Action To Seize Coal Mines
## UMW Acquitted In Contempt Trial 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 2 (/P) -
Legislation to open the way for
government, seizure of the struck
coal mines was introduced tonight
by Senator Wayne Morse (R., Ore.).
The hi'l may come up for a vote
in the Senate Labor Committee at
a meeting scheduled, for tomorrow
morning.
Morse's action was prompted by
Federal Judge Richmond B. Keecb's
ruling today that the United Mine
Workers' Union is innocent of con
tempt of court in the strike of 372,-
000 miners.
It came as the government des
perately sought means to gel. the
men back in the pits. Pi evident
Truman gave no indication what the
administration may do next.
Despite mounting talk that .seiz
ure may be resorted to, the miners
insist that nothing short, of a con
tract with the operators will send
them back to the pits. Another con
tract, negotiating session was held
today without any result.
Lewis' United Mine Workers were
cleared by Keoch of both criminal
and civil contempt. He hold that the
government had failed to prove its
charge that the union defied his own
back-to-work order issued Febru
ary II under the Taft-Hartley Act.
Attorney General McGrath an
nounced at once that he will appeal
the civil contempt decision. Ac
quittal on the criminal charge can
not be appealed.
Assistant Attorney General If.
Graham Morison told newsmen fie
hoped to net the appeal into the U.S.
( ourl <>112 Appeals tomorrow. He said
he will ask that a decision be
rushed.
Morse said in a Senate speech that
he was not criticizing Keecb's de
cision, but that it means Congress
now has "the duty to protect the
American people from the danger
that confronts them."
There was no sign that President
Truman wants the seizure power
which Morse proposed. But it ap
peared certain that if he gives the
signal he can get such a bill passed
quickly.
