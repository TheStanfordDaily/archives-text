STUBBORN HOTEL BLAZE- A hot fire in the 20 0-room Ridpath Holel drove Spokane, Wash.,
firemen into the streets, but they fought back with long streams of water. The Ridpatli lies on
two sides of the six-story Halliday Hotel in foreground. None of the more than 300 guests in both
hotels were injured. â€”AP Wirephoto
