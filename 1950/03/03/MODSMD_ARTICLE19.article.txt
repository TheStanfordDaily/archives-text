# Cards, Bears Will Stage 'Battle of the Basement'
## Weekend Games End Hoop Season For Both Squads 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Battle of the Basement
materializes this weekend as
Stanford and California, the two
teams already nominated by
their Los Angeles rivals as least
likely to succeed in the PCC
this year, battle it out on each
other's floors tonight and to
morrow for Bay Area confer
ence supremacy.
The game tonight is at Berkeley
with a starting time of 8:30. Tomor
row night the clubs switch floors
with Stanford the host, but the
starting time remains the same.
At stake is the dubious honor of
being third in the four-team South
ern Division race. More important
are the honor and tradition that goes
with the Stanford - California bas
ketball series, and the fact that
Stanford has an opportunity to nar
row the 78 to 38 advantage that the
Bears hold in the 116 games played
since the series began.
Split Last Series
The two teams divided their last,
series, played earlier this year. Cal
won 60 to 55 in the Pavilion, and
Stanford took a 50 to 47 overtime
verdict from the Bears in the Ber
keley Gym.
Since then both clubs have shown
marked improvement in their brand
of play. Last weekend both Stan-
I ford and Cal scored direct hits on
USC, and near misses on the now
; champion UCLA Brums.
Bob Walker is the club's leading
scorer, with 104 points in 10 confer
ence games for a 10.4 average. He
is followed closely by Bill Hagler
who has 102, and by Bob Matheny
with 97. This will be a critical se
ries for Matheny and Walker, both
of whom still have a chance to make
the All-Southern Division team.
Yardley Aims for Record
But. the spotlight this weekend
will focus on George Yardley, the
i blond bomber, who will make an
all-out assault on Hank Luisetti's
' all-time scoring record of 232 points
in 12 conference games. Yardley
now stands with 188 points in 10
games, and needs 44 more this
weekend to equal Luisetti's mark.
The Indians have looked sharp
and fit on the practicc floor thi â€¢
week, and appear about ready to
play their best ball against the
Bears.
Practice Good
Dur to see a lot of action this
weekend are Gus Chavalas and
| Ralph Carver, the two vets who
have always played their best
against Cal. Both have sparkled in
practice this week and will probably
star* in their last collegiate game
tomorrow night
Tonight, Coach Everett Dean is
expected to go with the same com
bination that defeated Troy and that
almost played the league.- winning
Bruins to a standstill last week
That means George Yardley and
Jack O'Sullivan at the forward ,
Jim Ramstead at center, and Bill
Warren and Jim Walsh at guards
Bear mentor Nibs Price will
' counter with Bill Hagler and Bob
Walker, forwards: Don Hendrikson,
center; and Bob Matheny and Jim
Payne, guards.
Payne will probably get the honor
of following Yardley around.


808 MATHENY, the Bears' leading candidate for all-division
i honors, will start at guard tonight as Stanford and California
| meet on the basketball court for the 117 th time. Matheny, a
J transfer from San Francisco City College, has scored 97 points
i in 10 Conference games for a 9.7 average.
