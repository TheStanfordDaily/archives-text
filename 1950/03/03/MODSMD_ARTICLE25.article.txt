# State of the Union
## 
### 
Tt has been the belief ol many students that
" t iny day now" woik on u new Student Union
would begin. Unfortunately, this belief hut;
no basis in fact.
It will be dl least a year, probably two, and
perhaps longer befoie construction begins.
The state of the proposed Union is just this:
I The site has not been selected. Three
locations are being considered: where the
Hcokstore is now situated, the Cor potation
Yard area, and the French House vicinity,
adjoining the present Union.
There are no architect's plans, diaw
tugs, or sketches ol the Union in existence
at m preparation.
3. Funds are insufficient to tinance the
first unit of a Union. which would piobably
be built a section at a time.
An ASSU Student Union Planning Commit
tee was tilst set up in October ol 1948. The
first commiitee. In its end-of-the-year report,
recommended that const/uction on the Union
not begin until all of the necessary funds were
available. The committee felt that the ASSU
should not incur another debt similar to that re
sulting from the building ol Memorial Hall.
Because the necessary funds were not at
once forthcoming, and because of more im
mediate problems, the University shelved the
plan for a new Union.
The estimated cost of the first unit in the
i)nion is a flat half-million dollaia. By ]une the
fund should hit the $300,000 mark, with funds
continuing to flow from three sources:
1. Donations
2. One dollar from each student per quarter,
included in the $200 tuition and fees paid on
ieg day and prior to the fall quarter, 1948,
known as the Memorial Hall dollar
3. Income from operation of the old Union.
At the present rate ol income from these
sources, it is estimated that the half-million

needed to siart the first unit will become avail
able between June 1051 and June 11352.
It seems to us that it is time now to begin
actually planning the Union so that the money
will not be forced to wait lor plans.
The student committees have outlined the
facilities that should be included in our Stu
dent Union und have recommended the pres
em location ol the bookstore as the best site.
The committees have been able to go no
further, because final action on the plan jests
whh the Boaid of Trustees and Dr. Steiling, as
it should.
Last week Dr. Steiling explained to a dele
gation from Excom that the Union plans had
not been considered at any length because of
more pressing matters.
Di. Sterling said that he "would like to see
plans lor the Union pushed" and that a five
man committee from the Board of Trustees
would take the matter under consideration.
This committee, composed of the chairmen
of the board's committees on finance, build
ings and grounds, investments, and academic
affairs, and the vice-chairman of the finance
committee, was set up to consider over-all de
veiopment ol the University's physical plant.
We hope thai tlus committee will give the
Union a high priority in their over all consid
eration of plans foi future building at Stanford.
The Student Union Planning Committee of
Kxcom will be used as a source of ideas for
the Union. To what extent those ideas will
carry weight, there is no telling.
The first unit to be constructed will be a
recreation building, including probably a ball ■
room, bowling alleys, cafeteria, and similar
facilities.
But it will be some time yet before Stanford
can enjoy any part of a new Union. We can
only hope that there will be no unavoidable
delays.

This committee, composed of the chairmen
of the board's committees on finance, build
ings and grounds, investments, and academic
affairs, and the vice-chairman of the finance
committee, was set up to consider over-all de
veiopment ol the University's physical plant.
We hope thai tlus committee will give the
Union a high priority in their over all consid
eration of plans foi future building at Stanford.
The Student Union Planning Committee of
Kxcom will be used as a source of ideas for
the Union. To what extent those ideas will
carry weight, there is no telling.
The first unit to be constructed will be a
recreation building, including probably a ball ■
room, bowling alleys, cafeteria, and similar
facilities.
But it will be some time yet before Stanford
can enjoy any part of a new Union. We can
only hope that there will be no unavoidable
delays.
Tt has been the belief ol many students that
" t iny day now" woik on u new Student Union
would begin. Unfortunately, this belief hut;
no basis in fact.
It will be dl least a year, probably two, and
perhaps longer befoie construction begins.
The state of the proposed Union is just this:
I The site has not been selected. Three
locations are being considered: where the
Hcokstore is now situated, the Cor potation
Yard area, and the French House vicinity,
adjoining the present Union.
There are no architect's plans, diaw
tugs, or sketches ol the Union in existence
at m preparation.
3. Funds are insufficient to tinance the
first unit of a Union. which would piobably
be built a section at a time.
An ASSU Student Union Planning Commit
tee was tilst set up in October ol 1948. The
first commiitee. In its end-of-the-year report,
recommended that const/uction on the Union
not begin until all of the necessary funds were
available. The committee felt that the ASSU
should not incur another debt similar to that re
sulting from the building ol Memorial Hall.
Because the necessary funds were not at
once forthcoming, and because of more im
mediate problems, the University shelved the
plan for a new Union.
The estimated cost of the first unit in the
i)nion is a flat half-million dollaia. By ]une the
fund should hit the $300,000 mark, with funds
continuing to flow from three sources:
1. Donations
2. One dollar from each student per quarter,
included in the $200 tuition and fees paid on
ieg day and prior to the fall quarter, 1948,
known as the Memorial Hall dollar
3. Income from operation of the old Union.
At the present rate ol income from these
sources, it is estimated that the half-million

needed to siart the first unit will become avail
able between June 1051 and June 11352.
It seems to us that it is time now to begin
actually planning the Union so that the money
will not be forced to wait lor plans.
The student committees have outlined the
facilities that should be included in our Stu
dent Union und have recommended the pres
em location ol the bookstore as the best site.
The committees have been able to go no
further, because final action on the plan jests
whh the Boaid of Trustees and Dr. Steiling, as
it should.
Last week Dr. Steiling explained to a dele
gation from Excom that the Union plans had
not been considered at any length because of
more pressing matters.
Di. Sterling said that he "would like to see
plans lor the Union pushed" and that a five
man committee from the Board of Trustees
would take the matter under consideration.
