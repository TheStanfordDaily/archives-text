## 'Captive Audience' 
### 
To the Editor:
For those who amuse themselves by making socio
logical observations, it is interesting to note in a recent
phenomenon nt Stanford the rapidity with which tech
nological inventions are adapted to local situations.
Headers of the "New Yorker" magazine, one of the
more profound journals of our time, may be ac
quainted with the controversy concerning the exploi
tation of the ''captive audience" by loudspeaker
• quipped advertisers who broacast beguiling exhorta
tions to the public to buy their wares or purchase their
• < i vices. The editors of the "New Yorker" maintain
ihat this type of advertising is an invasion of the indi
idual'fi right to privacy, for one has no choice but to
listen. One can throw away a newspaper or turn off
the radio, but one can't avoid the sound of a loud
• peaker broadcasting in a public place.
Of late, hard-working Stanford students trudging
•warily from their 11 o'clock classes, intending to
i <-store their waning energies at that palace of prandial
delights, the Cellar, have been turned into a captive
audience at the flick of a switch and the spin of a
platter.
Not only have dances and lectures been commended
. the gathered throngs, but the records of a recent
mash-hit show have been advertised and demon-

st rated. '11. is latter venture lias been extended
throughout the afternoon on consecutive days and
seems to have set a precedent for continuous musical
entertainment punctuated by commercials to ac
company white coffee and a snail al the Snack Bar.
Would it be inappropriate to suggest that these pro
grams be broadcast to wrist-watch radios which should
be distributed at no cost and be equipped with a
switch clearly marked: OFF. The alternative is to
cut down, or out, the volume of broadcasting which
is done at the Cellar. Let a man':; thoughts be his own
at least during lunch.
