# Colonial Magistrates

To the Editor:
In reference (o David Wong's suggestion that (he
"only solution" is that salaries for court interpreters
be increased so as to make it worthwhile for com
petent men to accept such posts, I think a sugges
tion equally worthwhile considering, is to give the
colonies back to the colonials, and lei the colonials
mete out their own justice in the language every
body understands locally. Perhaps the colonials can
be competent too, as magistrates.
