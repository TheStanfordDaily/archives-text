# 'Lively Teresa' Unequal To Other Italian Films
## 
### AL BERRY 
"Lively Teresa," now ut the Guild,
is a nice little thing that is being
billed as "a comedy of errors in mod
ern Rome." It is a light, happy pic
ture— never completely believable,
often completely dull, and always
completely harmless.
II the flick had been made in

Hollywood o r i n
English it might
have been better,
it is a Hollywood
;type flick, com
plete wilh the hero
and sliero singing
to each other while

hero carefully plays the piano.
The gill that plays the title role is
good, and the (lick's main saving;
grace. The hero is very, very hand
some and that's all. The plot is
idiotic.
It deals with a rich father who
tries to break oft his schoolboy son's
romance with a gold-digging mani
curist. He gives Sonny some lire to
take off for a summer resort and for
get the gold digger. Sonny takes his
friend to Venice with him instead. In
that city the manicurist discovers
that if she marries junior, the old
man cuts him off without a nickle
and she leaves the young man kelore
the picture can produce any much
needed sex scenes.
Meanwhile, daddy tries to bribe

off the manicurist and offers gold to
the wrong one—Teresa by name.
Teresa, not quite sure what the
money is for—. Why go on with the
plot? It you should go to see the
tiling you'll find it out. But I can't
honestly recommend such a pro
cedure.
What makes this picture on the
blank side is the fact that it deals
with something Hollywood could and
has done before. There is no touch
of brutal hardship that was in "Pai
san" indeed, the war might never
have existed as far as "Lively Te
resa" is concerned. It has no tragic
portrayals, as in "Rigoletto." It has
iio good acting, as in "Carmen." And
it has no good music, as in both of
the latter tw<> pictures.
In short, it is not the fine, wonder
ful type of Italian picture we have
bravoed so loudly since the war.
This one isn't really bad—in some
moods, you might enjoy it. But
really now, Hal, it isn't very good.
