# Frosh, Cubs Tangle In Final Casaba Tilts
## 
### 
California's undefeated freshman
team will be out to put a stop to
Stanford's 11-game victory streak
tonight in the preliminary game to
the varsity go at Berkeley.
Tomorrow night the two teams
will wind up their seasons here in
the Pavilion.
In the previous two meetings of
these teams the Cal boys finished
first by two lengths. The scores were
'1!) to 151 and 5(j to 28. The latter
beating was administered at the
Public School gymnasium.
The Bear Cubs, coached by Bob
liable, are undoubtedly one of the
finest first-year teams ever devel
oped in Berkeley. They hold a lot
of prospects for future Cal varsities.
Center Clay Gray is a huge Mid
westerner who has plenty of abil
ity and finesse to go along with his
I! feet 9 inches. Rupe Riekson and
Larry Horan looked well at for
wards in the last games, and have
been scoring consistently all season.
For the Papooses it will be the
same first five who have led the
team since the early part of the sea
son to a 15 and 3 win-loss record.
Co-captains Paul Johnson and Fritz
Fenster will be at forward and
guard respectively, Wade McClusky
at the other forward, George Zani
novich at the other guard, and Bill
Stevenson at center.
.Johnson has averaged 10 points a
eame this season, and has shown

terrific ability on floor play. Ste
venson has been "on" for the last
few performances and has put his
6 feet (1 inches to good use on the
boards. Both of the guards are ex
cellent long shots and steady defen
sive men.
