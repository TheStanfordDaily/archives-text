# Bears in Pavilion Ring With Red Boxers Tonight
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
Eight boxing proteges of Couch Ray Lunny will enter the Pavilion tonight
ready to avenge the early season shellacking they received at the hands of
the California Bears. Bouts get under way at 8 p.m.
The addition of heavyweight Mike Pelsinger and the return of light
heavy Jim Hammond might give the Cards enough strength to reverse the

9-1-1 loss-win-draw record they
posted against these same Bears at
Berkeley in the season's opener.
Lunny feels the entire team has the
condition and experience to turn the
tables this meeting.
Pelsinger Returns
Mike Pelsinger, who fought as a
heavyweight last year, is back in ac
tion after a long layout. The ex
gridder spent six weeks in a cast at
the beginning of the year, and has
started working out only recently.
Paxton Beale, the lumbering fighter
who took a close decision over In
dian Dave Oberlin in the season's
opener, will be pitted against Pel
singer. who will be fighting as No. 2
heavy this evening.
Top heavyweight berth will be
filled by Emery Mitchell, who drew
with Uclan Bob Edwards in Mitch
ell's first fight of the season last
week. "Mitch," one of the more ring
wise veterans on Lunny's squad, beat
Cat's John Grofi in his only battle
last year. Dick Tullsen, a returnee
from last season, is the Cal boxer who
has been matched with Mitchell.
Returning after a two-week layoff
will be Jim Hammond, experienced
light-heavyweight. In his other fights
of this season Hammond decisioned
Santa Clara's Bob Hentchell and lost
to Vic Corbett of Cal. Corbett is out
with a thumb injury and his place
will be filled by Don Bartley. The
Cal boxer lost last year to Stanford's
Jim Vaeher and has been untested
this year.
The Cards' two other 175-pounders,
Don Enberg and Jack Bickel, will
not see action tonight. Bickel in
jured a rib in practice a week ago and
probably is out for the season.
Sharp Is Veteran
Middleweight Bill Sharp, the vet
eran Stanford fighter who turned in
a good exhibition against UCLA's
Jack Small last week, is scheduled to

go against Hank Harvey, Cal old
timer who has been lighting in the
second 155-pound slot until this
week.
One of the top fights on the card
will be the 155-pound tussle be
tween Stanford's John Colton and
Dick Knezevich of the Bears. Knez
evich, who decisioned Colton by vir
tue of a strong finish in their first
match, has been touted as a National
Collegiate finalist.
Against UCLA. Knezevich again
pulled his chestnuts out of the fire in
the third round and scored a close
one over Don Hubbard. Last week
Colton fought to a draw with the
same Hubbard in the Westwooders'
gym. If Colton can save enough
strength to match Knezevich's strong
finish, his superior ability as u boxer
can win him the decision.
Rael In Rematch
Another first-class battle will fce
the welterweight "rubber" match be
tween Jose Rael and Ciil's Bill Snp
sis. These two fighters displayed
near-professional talent in their
draw bout at the first Cal-Stanfoid
meeting.
Coach Eddie Nemir of Cal has in
dicated that a cold may keep Sepsis
out, in which case he would move
Ed Griffin, lightweight, into the wel
terweight bracket. As it stands now,
slugging Kary May will meet Bueno
Torreano, No. 2 welter, in another
featured match.
In the lightweight bout Bob Baker
of the Indians has drawn Ed Griffin,
his opponent of the first meet. If
Griffin should move up one weight
notch, John Parham will fill in.
Admission for the bouts, which
start at 8 p.m.. will be: students 50
cents, general admission 80 cents.

terweight bracket. As it stands now,
slugging Kary May will meet Bueno
Torreano, No. 2 welter, in another
featured match.
In the lightweight bout Bob Baker
of the Indians has drawn Ed Griffin,
his opponent of the first meet. If
Griffin should move up one weight
notch, John Parham will fill in.
Admission for the bouts, which
start at 8 p.m.. will be: students 50
cents, general admission 80 cents.
Next week will be the final match
of the season when the Cards meet
Santa Clara.
Eight boxing proteges of Couch Ray Lunny will enter the Pavilion tonight
ready to avenge the early season shellacking they received at the hands of
the California Bears. Bouts get under way at 8 p.m.
The addition of heavyweight Mike Pelsinger and the return of light
heavy Jim Hammond might give the Cards enough strength to reverse the

9-1-1 loss-win-draw record they
posted against these same Bears at
Berkeley in the season's opener.
Lunny feels the entire team has the
condition and experience to turn the
tables this meeting.
Pelsinger Returns
Mike Pelsinger, who fought as a
heavyweight last year, is back in ac
tion after a long layout. The ex
gridder spent six weeks in a cast at
the beginning of the year, and has
started working out only recently.
Paxton Beale, the lumbering fighter
who took a close decision over In
dian Dave Oberlin in the season's
opener, will be pitted against Pel
singer. who will be fighting as No. 2
heavy this evening.
Top heavyweight berth will be
filled by Emery Mitchell, who drew
with Uclan Bob Edwards in Mitch
ell's first fight of the season last
week. "Mitch," one of the more ring
wise veterans on Lunny's squad, beat
Cat's John Grofi in his only battle
last year. Dick Tullsen, a returnee
from last season, is the Cal boxer who
has been matched with Mitchell.
Returning after a two-week layoff
will be Jim Hammond, experienced
light-heavyweight. In his other fights
of this season Hammond decisioned
Santa Clara's Bob Hentchell and lost
to Vic Corbett of Cal. Corbett is out
with a thumb injury and his place
will be filled by Don Bartley. The
Cal boxer lost last year to Stanford's
Jim Vaeher and has been untested
this year.
The Cards' two other 175-pounders,
Don Enberg and Jack Bickel, will
not see action tonight. Bickel in
jured a rib in practice a week ago and
probably is out for the season.
Sharp Is Veteran
Middleweight Bill Sharp, the vet
eran Stanford fighter who turned in
a good exhibition against UCLA's
Jack Small last week, is scheduled to

go against Hank Harvey, Cal old
timer who has been lighting in the
second 155-pound slot until this
week.
One of the top fights on the card
will be the 155-pound tussle be
tween Stanford's John Colton and
Dick Knezevich of the Bears. Knez
evich, who decisioned Colton by vir
tue of a strong finish in their first
match, has been touted as a National
Collegiate finalist.
Against UCLA. Knezevich again
pulled his chestnuts out of the fire in
the third round and scored a close
one over Don Hubbard. Last week
Colton fought to a draw with the
same Hubbard in the Westwooders'
gym. If Colton can save enough
strength to match Knezevich's strong
finish, his superior ability as u boxer
can win him the decision.
Rael In Rematch
Another first-class battle will fce
the welterweight "rubber" match be
tween Jose Rael and Ciil's Bill Snp
sis. These two fighters displayed
near-professional talent in their
draw bout at the first Cal-Stanfoid
meeting.
Coach Eddie Nemir of Cal has in
dicated that a cold may keep Sepsis
out, in which case he would move
Ed Griffin, lightweight, into the wel
terweight bracket. As it stands now,
slugging Kary May will meet Bueno
Torreano, No. 2 welter, in another
featured match.
