# 9-4 WIN
## Stanfords Crush USFers In Sunken Diamond Test 
### BILL SWIGART 
Third sacker Bruce Cameron hit a
third - inning home run with the
bases loaded to pace the Stanford
baseballers to a 9 to 4 victory over
lISF in their first collegiate game
yesterday afternoon.
Tomorrow, the Indians fare a
strong San Jose State team for
their second test against a college
nine. Game time will l>e 2:.'10 and
admission will be free.
Cameron's blow yesterday, a tre
mendous wallop that cleared the
left field wall out near the 360-foot
mark, was the climax of a six-run
Card uprising in the third inning,
and just about sewed up the game
for Stanford.
Ninth Homer
His homer was the ninth such
four-ply wallop to be hit out of the
Sunken Diamond since the field was
built in the 1920'5.
The Cards outhit the Dons 11 to
(i, and generally outclassed them in
all departments of play. Stanford's
cause was aided materially by four
USF errors.
Jack Heinen started on the mound
for the Indians and was very effec
tive during the four innings that he
worked. He struck out five, gave up
only one hit and one unearned run.
Shive Has Trouble
Ed Shive, who followed him to
the hill in the fifth, was in hot wa
ter most of the lime, but his only
really bad inning was the seventh
when three Don runs came across.
Stanford's slugging first base
man Bud Klein maintained his
torrid pace at the plate by hit
ting three for five, including one
double. Klein has hit, safely eight
limes in 20 trips to the plate this
season for a .400 average.
Tomorrow, the Cards will look
;it the slants of San Jose's Pete
Mesa, reputably one of (he best
pitchers in collegiate baseball, and

an all-coast selection as n sopho
more last year.
All-Veteran Team
Behind Mesa will be an all-vet
eran team which won the CCAA
title in a walk last season. Coach
Walt Williams has 13 lettermen
back, but will be without the serv
ices of basketballers Bob Wuesthoff,
Ralph Romero, and Dean Giles to
morrow.
Coach Everett Dean expects to
use Jim Claypool and Frank "Ham
bone" Hamilton on the mound
against the Spartans. Elsewhere the
lieup will be about the same as it
has been, except that Tony Stellar,
up from last year's frosh squad, will
get a chance to show his worth in
the outfield.

Shive Has Trouble
Ed Shive, who followed him to
the hill in the fifth, was in hot wa
ter most of the lime, but his only
really bad inning was the seventh
when three Don runs came across.
Stanford's slugging first base
man Bud Klein maintained his
torrid pace at the plate by hit
ting three for five, including one
double. Klein has hit, safely eight
limes in 20 trips to the plate this
season for a .400 average.
Tomorrow, the Cards will look
;it the slants of San Jose's Pete
Mesa, reputably one of (he best
pitchers in collegiate baseball, and

an all-coast selection as n sopho
more last year.
All-Veteran Team
Behind Mesa will be an all-vet
eran team which won the CCAA
title in a walk last season. Coach
Walt Williams has 13 lettermen
back, but will be without the serv
ices of basketballers Bob Wuesthoff,
Ralph Romero, and Dean Giles to
morrow.
Coach Everett Dean expects to
use Jim Claypool and Frank "Ham
bone" Hamilton on the mound
against the Spartans. Elsewhere the
lieup will be about the same as it
has been, except that Tony Stellar,
up from last year's frosh squad, will
get a chance to show his worth in
the outfield.
The line score:
I{ II E
USF 000-100-300—4 (! 1
Stanford .. 206-010-00x—9 II 1
Third sacker Bruce Cameron hit a
third - inning home run with the
bases loaded to pace the Stanford
baseballers to a 9 to 4 victory over
lISF in their first collegiate game
yesterday afternoon.
Tomorrow, the Indians fare a
strong San Jose State team for
their second test against a college
nine. Game time will l>e 2:.'10 and
admission will be free.
Cameron's blow yesterday, a tre
mendous wallop that cleared the
left field wall out near the 360-foot
mark, was the climax of a six-run
Card uprising in the third inning,
and just about sewed up the game
for Stanford.
Ninth Homer
His homer was the ninth such
four-ply wallop to be hit out of the
Sunken Diamond since the field was
built in the 1920'5.
The Cards outhit the Dons 11 to
(i, and generally outclassed them in
all departments of play. Stanford's
cause was aided materially by four
USF errors.
Jack Heinen started on the mound
for the Indians and was very effec
tive during the four innings that he
worked. He struck out five, gave up
only one hit and one unearned run.
