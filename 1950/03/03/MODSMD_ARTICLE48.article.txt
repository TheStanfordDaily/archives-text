# Indian Ruggers Meet Cal
## Rivals Battle For Crown On Saturday 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Pacific Coast Rugby
championship will be at stake
tomorrow afternoon in Berkeley
when Stanford and California
renew a rugby rivalry which
began back in 1907. Starting
time is set for 2:30 in Memorial
Stadium.
This is the big one for the Indians,
whose avowed purpose is to dethrone
the Bears, who have held the rugby
title since before the war.
On paper the two teams rate about
even, but the Cards have a slight
edge by dint of experience and su
perior reserve strength. The Bears
are in the process of rebuilding as a
result of heavy losses through grad
uation, while the Indians have prac
tically an all-veteran lineup,
Backfield Depth
Stanford's reserve power is most
evident in the backfield, where Walt
Dunbar, Pete Peckham, Pete Young,
and Bob Oswald serve as adequate
replacements for starters John
Banks, Bill DeYoung, Boyd Benson,
Bill McColl, and Dick Hughes.
On the other hand, the Bears must
depend on a trio of backs, Max How
ell, Roy Ward, and Bob Losey, to
carry most of the offensive load. Cal
was hurt considerably by the loss of
footballer Carl Van Heuitt who broke
his jaw in the Cal-University Club
game.
Stanford will be at full strength for
tomorrow's game with one exception.
Regular scrum half Bill Geary re
injured his leg in yesterday's prac
tice session and will definitely not
start. Jim Bradshaw will open in
his place with Gregg Bemis in re
serve. Otherwise the squad is in good
health; Ed Culin and Boyd Benson
have fought off the flu bug and are
back in shape again.
Canadians litre
Stanford has one more game on its
schedule after tomorrow. Next Tues
day afternoon in Stanford Stadium
local fans will be treated to an ex
hibition of rugby of the Canadian
variety, when the University of Brit
ish Columbia and Stanford tangle
for the third time this season. The
Cards will be out to avenge two ear
lier losses at the hands of the Thun
derbirds.
