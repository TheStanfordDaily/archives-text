# Foreign Careers Group Offers Positions Abroad to Students
## 
### JULIE DOCKSTADER 
Once a Stanford rough who need
| ed a job decided that he wanted to
get away from it all—out of the
i United States, that is — and spend
his life in another land.
He had not the slightest idea,
i however, where he could get infor
mation about foreign jobs, until one
day he read in The Daily that an
, organization called the Foreign Ca
, reel's Association was having a
| meeting at 5::i0 that night in the
Women's Clubhouse.
This imaginary Joe Stanford went
to the meeting. He saw a girl from
j his contemporary world politics
| class and two boys from his seminar
| in sociology, so. feeling right at
j home, he gave out with a big smile
and started asking questions.
"New to Me"
"Why haven't I heard of this for
j eign career deal?" he asked. "It's
really great! I can come to meetings
every week and find out about all
j different kinds of jobs, until I hear

of one that seems especially inter
esting."
After the meeting, lie talked with
one of the officers of the organiza
tion, a kind and helpful coed who
had started out by being just as
confused about her future work as
Joe was.
"The Foreign Careers Association
used to be called the Foreign Serv
ice Association," she said, "but a
more generalized niimc seemed to be
needed to cover all the kinds of ca
reers the club is concerned with—
United Nations work, the import
export business, private industry,
and international welfare.
How It Began
"It all started with a group of
students who were interested in
foreign careers. They formed a pro
gnim of weekly meetings, with as
many speakers on widely varied as
pects of foreign work as possible."
The coed continued, "This quarter
we heard Miss Edmee Boulanger,
who worked with UNEEA in Eu
rope during the war; Dr. Barahal of
the Guidance and Testing Center;
and Dr. Ellis Emmons Reed, public
relations director of Air France.
Also . .
"Hold on a minute!" broke in the
Stanford rough, obviously disap
pointed. "What good will it do me
to hear all these people if I can
never get a job in foreign work? I
need some contact with people who
know the business."
Valuable Files
"Exactly; that's why we keep a
file of letters from Stanford gradu
ates who have done foreign work."
the girl said. "You can always go
to sec any of them, or write to them,
about a job or for information. And
we have contacts with men and
women in many fields of foreign

work, who arc glad to help you get
started."
"I'm still not satisfied," he said.
'Don't you ever see any of these
businesses in action?"
"We certainly do!" the coed
smiled. "Two weeks ago we were
invited up to San Francisco by
tlie Frazar-Hansen Import-Export
Company. This week we're going
back to the city for a tour of the
British consulate."
Questionnaire Given
Before he went home, Joe was
handed a questionnaire that would
go in the file to help him make val
uable job contacts.
Every week until his graduation
he attended the Foreign Careers
Association meetings on Monday
nights. Little by little, he clarified
his plans after listening to the vari
ous speakers.
When he sat on the graduation
platform in cap and gown, he car
ried in the pocket of his starched
white shirt a coveted foreign job
offer.
