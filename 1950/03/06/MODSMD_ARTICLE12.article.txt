# Stanford Law Students Victorious in Moot Court
## Lewis, Duke Triumph Over Cal, USF And Santa Clara to Capture Trophy 
### JOHN BUSH 
Stanford law students Leonard J.
Lewis and Clifford L. Duke Jr. won
the first Inter - Lew School Moot
Court competition here last Friday
night. They were awarded a per
petual trophy by the California
State Bar Association.
Law students from California, !
Santa Clara, and USF competed in
the four-way hearing in the Law '
School's new Moot Court room. The I
Stanford team argued against the
men from California's Boalt Hall,
and Santa Clara and USF students
debated in the other round. Al
though each team debated with only
one opponent, the one best team of !
the four was named winner.
The case argued involved a hypo- j
thetical San Francisco ordinance j
which makes it unlawful to operate
a sound amplifier on public streets
without a police permit. The ordi- j
nance authorizes the police commis
sioner to issue permits, subject to
restrictions necessary to "secure to
the public comfortable, convenient, j
and peaceful enjoyment of public ]
facilities."
The appellant in the hypothetical
case was granted a permit, but the
commissioner revoked it after offi- J
cials of the public library protested j
that the amplifier would disturb J
users of the library.
The appellant sought to have the j
commissioner's revocation annulled. {
or to have the ordinance's grant
of discretion to the commissioner !
declared void on constitutional
grounds.
r,"wis and Duke argued for the i
appellant, and the California team '
for the respondent police commis- ]
sioncr. Santa Clara also argued for I
the appellant against the USF team
in a separate round.
Judges were: B. Roy Schauer, as
sociate justice of the California Su
preme Court; Louis Goodman, judge I
of the United States District Court
for Northern California; William F.
Traverse, presiding judge of the San 1

Francisco Superior Court; Farnham
P. Griffiths and Roger Kent, San
Francisco attorneys.
David W. Lcnnihan and Edward
Scoycn assistd Duke and Lewis in
preparing briefs.
Arguments were judged not on
the merits of the case, hut on the
quality of the briefs, skill in oral
argumentation and clearness of pre
sentation, and ability to .deal effec
tively with questions asked by the
judges.
The Jnter-Law School Moot Court
competition is sponsored by the
Conference of Junior Bar Members
of the Stale Bar, the Barristers'
Club of San Francisco, and the Jun
ior Barristers of Los Angeles.
