# Trees Grow On 'Yankee' Stage Set
## 
### MARGE BOTTS 
Shouts of "Timber!" arc echoing
through the halls of Memorial Au
: ditorium this week. Trees are not
j being felled, howeverâ€”they arc bc-
I ing created.
This sudden interest in trees de
veloped when construction of sets
was begun for the latest Stanford
Players production, "Connecticut
Yankee," to be presented March 9,
10, and 11.
One of the sets calls for a large
I tree that can be climbed. The drama
department owns one large stage
tree which was built more than ten
years ago, but experiments soon
proved it unclimbable. A new tree is
now under construction, and the old
one, "Big Bertha," hangs undis
turbed from the ceiling of the scene
shop.
Ray Hubbard, graduate student in
j speech and drama, is designing the
! sets for the Rodgcrs and Hart musi-
J cal comedy.
Hubbard, formerly a drama
teacher at Sequoia High School, be
j gan graduate study at Stanford last
summer. He: designed settings for
"Scenes from Opera," presented by
the Music Department at the end
of summer quarter.
"Connecticut Yankee" calls for
five settings, beginning with a hotel
ballroom in Hartford, Connecticut.
The play shifts to the court of
King Arthur in the sixth century;
to a modern factory in old Camclot;
to the castle of Morgan Lc Fay; and
back to modern-day Hartford.
