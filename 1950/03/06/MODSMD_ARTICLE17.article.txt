# Bookstore Announces Advance Sale Of Books During Pre-Reg Week
## 
### 
Do your textbook shopping early. J
This will be the theme of the Stan- !
ford Bookstore for iho next, few
weeks as students will be able to I
purchase their spring quarter text
books during pre-rcgistration.
A new advanced sale plan is being
initiated to reduce the congestion in j
the Bookstore at the beginning of the
quarter. In the words of Mrs. Helena
Bauchou, manager of the Bookstore,
"Students can avoid the standing in
line and save hours of time by get
ting their books and supplies at prc
rcg time."
Besides saving students' time, the !
new plan is designed, to take a lot ;
of pressure ofT the Bookstore during |
the registration period. Professor
Hugh SkillinH, member of the Book- j
store board of directors, feels, "There J
is no reason why we can't get a large J
part of the textbook business done
before reg day."
For the last three quarters, the En
gineering Department has been act- .
ing as the guinea pig for the plan. I

Over !)() per cent of the eligible stu
donts profited from the plan. This
success prompted the? directors of the
Bookstore to invito ;ill departments to
take part in the program beginning
this quarter.
Books Already Available
Miss Agnes Driscoll, who is in
charge of the textbook department,
reports that three-fourths of the pro
fessors have already turned in their
orders. Most of these books arc
stacked around the Bookstore ready
for sale. More arc expected to arrive
by next week.
"If your professor hasn't put in an
order for books, get him to do it now,"
urges Professor Skilling. "In this
way students may help the program
be completely successful."
Lists of the necessary books for
next quarter's courses are to be
posted in the department ofTices.
Students should first go there to find
out which books they should pur
chase. If the lists are not available
in the department offices, students

j should 112," to t he Bookstore, where
complete li.'Hs will br available.
Refunds for Changes
If students taking advantage of this
plan purchase their books in advance
and later change their program so
that a purchased book will not be
necessary, the purchase price will be
refunded in full on the return of the
book in new condition. New condi
tion means no writing, name, or dirt
on the book so that it will be resale
able as new.
Veterans and other' government
subsidized students will be unable to
take advantage of the pre-reg sale.
The Veterans' Administration cannot
authorize advance purchases of books
paid for by the government.
During the spring quarter, a sur
vey will be taken to decide how ef
fective the new plan is and what the
students' reactions are to it. The con
tinuation of this advanced textbook
sale will depend on the results of
I that survey.
