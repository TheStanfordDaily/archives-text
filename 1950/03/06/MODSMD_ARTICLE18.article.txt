# Luisetti Record Falls; SC's Sharman Betters Yardley by One Point
## 
### JOHN HALL 
You can't come much closer than
George Yardley did last Saturday
night.
The blond Stanford captain, cli
maxing his college cage career with
23- and 26 - point performances
against California, battered his way
to a new Southern Division scoring
title, only to lose it 27 minutes later
when USC's Bill Sharman bettered
him by a single digit.
Untouchable Record
Here was Hank Luisetti's 12-
year-old record of 232 points in a
single season, standing alone for
over a decade, and seemingly un
touchable, being broken twice on
the same night.
The Balboa Bomber, with Luisetti
watching from the sidelines, was the
first to smash the standard. There
were 12 minutes still on the clock
when Yardley picked up his 21st
point of the game to tie the mark.
Then, as the 2,700 persons in the
packed Pavilion roared approval,
George plunked in 5 more markers
to stretch his final total to 237 for
12 games.
But Bill Sharman, ahead of Lui
setti's record pace for the whole
ride, and although held to 10 points
by UCLA Friday night, rammed
through 24 in the Pan Pacific (21 in
the second half) to edge George by
1 at 238.
Split Series
Meanwhile, Stanford was splitting
two with Cal, winning easily 58 to
46 in Berkeley Friday night, but
losing 64 to 55 on Yardley Night to
slide silently into the loop cellar
with 3 wins and 9 losses.
UCLA bounced back from its Fri
day night loss in its own gym to
crush Troy, 74 to 57, in the Pan to
end its championship season at 10
wins and 2 losses. USC (7-5) and
California (4-8) finished up in be
tween.
But it was not the final standings

of the four schools that had the pa
trons frothing at the lips. It was
the tension-loaded stretch drive be
tween Yardley and Sharman.
Stretch Drive
It was Yardley, trailing Sharman
by as many ns 40 points midway
through the 12 - game run, who
scorched through the stretch with
one of the most phenomenal scoring
sprees the Pacific Coast has ever
witnessed.
Here's what he did:
1. Outscored Sharman in the last
seven games in the following order:
26 against USC, 18 against UCLA,
21 against USC, 22 against UCLA, 25
against USC, 22 against UCLA, 23
against Cal, and 26 against Cal.
2. Became the first man to break
Luisetti's record, ripping the nets

for 23 7 points in 12 games for a 19.1
average.
3. Became the third man in Stan
ford history to score over 400 points
in a single season, following Hank
Luisetti and Jim Pollard. Yardlcy
had 413 for 25 games.
4. Moved into the third spot in
all-time Stanford scoring with 820
for three years, although his sopho
more year was almost a blank on
the record book. Luisetti and Bill
Stephenson had the benefit of hi h
first years to grab the first two spots.
11-14 Record
Yardley accomplished these things
in spite of the fact that he was
playing with a cellar team, which
won only 11 games in 25 starts.
Saturday night in the Pavilion,
every person was adding up Yard
ley's total, point by point, cheering
every time he pocketed one of his
field -
.lie record Vvitii x.c minute i.
the clock, he received a tremendous
ovation.
A minute later, California quieted
the crowd somewhat by seizing the
lead for the first time in the ball
game. Then, with Bob Walker, Bill
Hagler, and Bob Matheney playing
clever ball control, and hitting accu
rately, the Bears zoomed to a 10-
point lead over the Indians, who had
shot their bolt as soon as Yardley
passed the record.
But the score and outcome of this
one was only an incidental sidelight.
The crowd had come to see Yardley
go after Luisetti's 12-year-old
standard, to keep it all in the fam
ily, and George had given it a Noor-
Citation finish, but he missed by
that single point.
It was a good try. He had picker!
up 15 points on Sharman in this final
weekend, but the clock—as it has
a habit of doing—just ran out too
fast.


CAPTAIN GEORGE YARDLEY,
playing his last games under Stan
ford colors, scored 23 and 26
points against California to shoot
his season total to 237 points ami
momentarily break and hold Hank
Luisetti's 12-year-old record of
232 points. Bill Sharman ruined
everything with 24 points against
UCLA.

12 games.
But Bill Sharman, ahead of Lui
setti's record pace for the whole
ride, and although held to 10 points
by UCLA Friday night, rammed
through 24 in the Pan Pacific (21 in
the second half) to edge George by
1 at 238.
Split Series
Meanwhile, Stanford was splitting
two with Cal, winning easily 58 to
46 in Berkeley Friday night, but
losing 64 to 55 on Yardley Night to
slide silently into the loop cellar
with 3 wins and 9 losses.
UCLA bounced back from its Fri
day night loss in its own gym to
crush Troy, 74 to 57, in the Pan to
end its championship season at 10
wins and 2 losses. USC (7-5) and
California (4-8) finished up in be
tween.
But it was not the final standings

of the four schools that had the pa
trons frothing at the lips. It was
the tension-loaded stretch drive be
tween Yardley and Sharman.
Stretch Drive
It was Yardley, trailing Sharman
by as many ns 40 points midway
through the 12 - game run, who
scorched through the stretch with
one of the most phenomenal scoring
sprees the Pacific Coast has ever
witnessed.
Here's what he did:
1. Outscored Sharman in the last
seven games in the following order:
26 against USC, 18 against UCLA,
21 against USC, 22 against UCLA, 25
against USC, 22 against UCLA, 23
against Cal, and 26 against Cal.
2. Became the first man to break
Luisetti's record, ripping the nets

for 23 7 points in 12 games for a 19.1
average.
3. Became the third man in Stan
ford history to score over 400 points
in a single season, following Hank
Luisetti and Jim Pollard. Yardlcy
had 413 for 25 games.
4. Moved into the third spot in
all-time Stanford scoring with 820
for three years, although his sopho
more year was almost a blank on
the record book. Luisetti and Bill
Stephenson had the benefit of hi h
first years to grab the first two spots.
11-14 Record
Yardley accomplished these things
in spite of the fact that he was
playing with a cellar team, which
won only 11 games in 25 starts.
Saturday night in the Pavilion,
every person was adding up Yard
ley's total, point by point, cheering
every time he pocketed one of his
field -
.lie record Vvitii x.c minute i.
the clock, he received a tremendous
ovation.
A minute later, California quieted
the crowd somewhat by seizing the
lead for the first time in the ball
game. Then, with Bob Walker, Bill
Hagler, and Bob Matheney playing
clever ball control, and hitting accu
rately, the Bears zoomed to a 10-
point lead over the Indians, who had
shot their bolt as soon as Yardley
passed the record.
But the score and outcome of this
one was only an incidental sidelight.
The crowd had come to see Yardley
go after Luisetti's 12-year-old
standard, to keep it all in the fam
ily, and George had given it a Noor-
Citation finish, but he missed by
that single point.
It was a good try. He had picker!
up 15 points on Sharman in this final
weekend, but the clock—as it has
a habit of doing—just ran out too
fast.


CAPTAIN GEORGE YARDLEY,
playing his last games under Stan
ford colors, scored 23 and 26
points against California to shoot
his season total to 237 points ami
momentarily break and hold Hank
Luisetti's 12-year-old record of
232 points. Bill Sharman ruined
everything with 24 points against
UCLA.
You can't come much closer than
George Yardley did last Saturday
night.
The blond Stanford captain, cli
maxing his college cage career with
23- and 26 - point performances
against California, battered his way
to a new Southern Division scoring
title, only to lose it 27 minutes later
when USC's Bill Sharman bettered
him by a single digit.
Untouchable Record
Here was Hank Luisetti's 12-
year-old record of 232 points in a
single season, standing alone for
over a decade, and seemingly un
touchable, being broken twice on
the same night.
The Balboa Bomber, with Luisetti
watching from the sidelines, was the
first to smash the standard. There
were 12 minutes still on the clock
when Yardley picked up his 21st
point of the game to tie the mark.
Then, as the 2,700 persons in the
packed Pavilion roared approval,
George plunked in 5 more markers

Stretch Drive
It was Yardley, trailing Sharman
by as many ns 40 points midway
through the 12 - game run, who
scorched through the stretch with
one of the most phenomenal scoring
sprees the Pacific Coast has ever
witnessed.
Here's what he did:
1. Outscored Sharman in the last
seven games in the following order:
26 against USC, 18 against UCLA,
21 against USC, 22 against UCLA, 25
against USC, 22 against UCLA, 23
against Cal, and 26 against Cal.
2. Became the first man to break
Luisetti's record, ripping the nets

for 23 7 points in 12 games for a 19.1
average.
3. Became the third man in Stan
ford history to score over 400 points
in a single season, following Hank
Luisetti and Jim Pollard. Yardlcy
had 413 for 25 games.
4. Moved into the third spot in
all-time Stanford scoring with 820
for three years, although his sopho
more year was almost a blank on
the record book. Luisetti and Bill
Stephenson had the benefit of hi h
first years to grab the first two spots.
11-14 Record
Yardley accomplished these things
in spite of the fact that he was
playing with a cellar team, which
won only 11 games in 25 starts.
Saturday night in the Pavilion,
every person was adding up Yard
ley's total, point by point, cheering
every time he pocketed one of his
field -
.lie record Vvitii x.c minute i.
the clock, he received a tremendous
ovation.
A minute later, California quieted
the crowd somewhat by seizing the
lead for the first time in the ball
game. Then, with Bob Walker, Bill
Hagler, and Bob Matheney playing
clever ball control, and hitting accu
rately, the Bears zoomed to a 10-
point lead over the Indians, who had
shot their bolt as soon as Yardley
passed the record.
But the score and outcome of this
one was only an incidental sidelight.
The crowd had come to see Yardley
go after Luisetti's 12-year-old
standard, to keep it all in the fam
ily, and George had given it a Noor-
Citation finish, but he missed by
that single point.
It was a good try. He had picker!
up 15 points on Sharman in this final
weekend, but the clock—as it has
a habit of doing—just ran out too
fast.


CAPTAIN GEORGE YARDLEY,
playing his last games under Stan
ford colors, scored 23 and 26
points against California to shoot
his season total to 237 points ami
momentarily break and hold Hank
Luisetti's 12-year-old record of
232 points. Bill Sharman ruined
everything with 24 points against
UCLA.
You can't come much closer than
George Yardley did last Saturday
night.
The blond Stanford captain, cli
maxing his college cage career with
23- and 26 - point performances
against California, battered his way
to a new Southern Division scoring
title, only to lose it 27 minutes later
when USC's Bill Sharman bettered
him by a single digit.
Untouchable Record
Here was Hank Luisetti's 12-
year-old record of 232 points in a
single season, standing alone for
over a decade, and seemingly un
touchable, being broken twice on
the same night.
The Balboa Bomber, with Luisetti
watching from the sidelines, was the
first to smash the standard. There
were 12 minutes still on the clock
when Yardley picked up his 21st
point of the game to tie the mark.
Then, as the 2,700 persons in the
packed Pavilion roared approval,
George plunked in 5 more markers
to stretch his final total to 237 for
12 games.
But Bill Sharman, ahead of Lui
setti's record pace for the whole
ride, and although held to 10 points
by UCLA Friday night, rammed
through 24 in the Pan Pacific (21 in
the second half) to edge George by
1 at 238.
Split Series
Meanwhile, Stanford was splitting
two with Cal, winning easily 58 to
46 in Berkeley Friday night, but
losing 64 to 55 on Yardley Night to
slide silently into the loop cellar
with 3 wins and 9 losses.
UCLA bounced back from its Fri
day night loss in its own gym to
crush Troy, 74 to 57, in the Pan to
end its championship season at 10
wins and 2 losses. USC (7-5) and
California (4-8) finished up in be
tween.
But it was not the final standings

of the four schools that had the pa
trons frothing at the lips. It was
the tension-loaded stretch drive be
tween Yardley and Sharman.
