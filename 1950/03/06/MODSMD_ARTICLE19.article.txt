refuge here August 7.
The Administration plans to ap
peal the ruling to the Commission
when it next meets, in January,
1951. Meanwhile, the University
will take advantage of other sections
of the state laws to prohibit hunt
ing on Stanford property.
The University will seek to en
force the laws that prohibit hunting
on enclosed land. It will also post
partly enclosed and open lands
against trespassing. For this pui
pose signs must be posted three to
the mile. Violation of these provi
sions is a misdemeanor.
Frederick O. Glover, director of

fish and game editors throughout
the state of the University's stand.

land has been a state game refuge.
The Commission opened the ref
uge after hearing complaints from
the local game warden that the area
