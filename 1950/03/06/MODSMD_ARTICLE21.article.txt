# Food Acquitted In Encina Plague
## 
### 
There arc all indications that the
widespread illness which struck En
cina and Toyon Halls February Ifi
was not caused by food poisoning,
according to the final report of Dr.
George S. Luckctt, University
Health Officer.
In his report to the Administra
tion, *Dr. Luckett said that symp
toms of the disease were experi
enced by some Encina and Toyon
men before and some many hours
after the lunch which many persons
blamed for the illness.
Dr. Luckett said the sickness
probably resulted from some quick
spreading disease of a virus nature. |
