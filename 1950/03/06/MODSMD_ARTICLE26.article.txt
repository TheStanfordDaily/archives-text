There has been some doubt us to the status

in deciding on the acceptance of d student,
the Committee explains, every eflort is made
to get a mental picture of what the applicant
is like—his personality, his chances lor suc

of a different color.
I Jo question on the blank is important indi
vidually. Past activities, grades, interests, ap
titude tests, and recommendations all help

mittee sees as it examines the hundreds ol

Dr. H. Donald Winbigier, University Hegis
tiar, said if the photograph requirement was
too misleading to the public's impression
of Stanford, the Committee would be "more
than willing to omit the requirement." But the
picture does serve as a tremendous aid lor
"Mizing-up" the applicant.
We would like to see the requirement omit
ltd From what we have seen, this require
in'-nt gives the public the wiong impression ol
Stanford, as it has given many students here
today. The layman has no idea what the Ad
mission Committee's policy on the use of the
pictures is.
There have been numerous Negro students

who took graduate woik here, and sevejal un
dergraduates who have also found their place
on campus
But the fact remains that fewer Negroes at
tend Stanford than other schools. No adminis
trative office has a lecord ol how many Ne
groes attend Stanford; no blanks tell the com
plete story; no pictures provide an accurate
report.
This observation alone seems particularly
significant to us. We wager that there are few
universities which have no complete count of
their Negro enrollment. This is a feather in
Stanford's cap.
Why, then, are there so few Negroes at
Stanford?
First, the financial load is too much lor many
Negroes who come from poorer sections of
the economy. These students tend to go to
state supported universities.
Second, and of most importance we think, is
the fact that the Negro will go where he ex
pects to find others of his race. Since Stanford
has never had a large Negro enrollment, these
students are hesitant about being "the first
ones."
This traditional feeling that Stanford was not
the place for the Negro probably had its roots
in the financial difficulties. It can only be
broken down by the admittance of more Ne
groes.
Perhaps a star Negro fullback or yell-leader
would help the cause. Perhaps several schol
arships especially for Negroes are needed.
Application blanks for Stanford are mailed
to all high schools in California; members of
the Admissions Committee have even visited
some Negro high schools promoting interest
in Stanford.
It is a problem of public relations. Stanford
will accept the Negro; will the Negro accept
Stanford? — G A.
