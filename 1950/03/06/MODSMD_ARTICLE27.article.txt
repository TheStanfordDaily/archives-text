The Bookstore's pre-registration udvunce
sale of next-quarter textbooks comes as wel

Wiih the postwar enrollment boom, the
hook tore bottleneck rnushioomed into sheer

have been tried, with only a measure of sue

However, the advance :..ale innovation may

Under this plan each academic department

" " - - * v w ; th tha coopera

tion of the academic departments in compiling
the course-text lists, and that cooperation is
evidenced by the fact that three-fourths of the
professors hove already turned in their lists.
During the pre reg period, by referring to
these lists, students can "do their textbook
shopping early" and avoid the fnst-of the
quaiter scramble.
Obviously, if all students attempt to buy
their texts eaily, the scramble will be just as
bad as ever, lint many of us will be too busy
with last minute midterms and papers to visit
the bookstore,
the resulting distribution of textbook sales
between the pre-reg and reg periods should
remove the bottleneck at last
