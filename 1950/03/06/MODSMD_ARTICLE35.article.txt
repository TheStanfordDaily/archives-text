Losing pitcher in Saturday's bat
lre was l\ le Mesa, the fabulous Ne
••ro right-hander who-was All-Coast
a a sophomore last year. Mesa
pitched a good game, but was a lit
tle on the wild side an I he had prac
tically no support behind him.
The Indians combined three Spar
tan errors with two timely hits and
a couple of walks for seven runs in
the first two innings, and that was
the ball game.
.lim Clay pool Starts
•liio Claypoo! started for the

Cards, and had the Staters eating
out of his hand during the five in
nings that he worked. All four of
San Jose's runs came oft lefty Frank
Hamilton, who definitely didn't have
11 Saturday.
Dave Stott finished up and
pitched perfect baseball for the last
two frames.
Best hit of the day was Charlie
Cole's tremendous smash to the
right center field bank that went for
three bases and two runs batted in
during the four-run uprising in the
.-.eeond. Pete Mesa picked up a
triple and a single in three trips for
two of San Jose's four hits.
