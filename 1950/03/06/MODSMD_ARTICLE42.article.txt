## 
### 
By CRAYTON JONES
Jim Bradshaw's 40-yard drop
kick in the closing minutes of j
the game gave the Stanford
ruggers a well-earned, 6 to 3. |
victory over California at Berke
ley last Saturday. The score
was knotted at 3-all vvhen the
Cards were awarded a penalty
kick. With placekickers Bill
McColl and Ed Culin both on |
the bench, Coach Chuck Taylor
called on Bradshaw who then :
provided a storybook finish j
with his game-winning kick.
Sharing hero honors with Brad- |
shaw was Pete Peckham who. with j
three minutes remaining to play, tied j
tlie score with a running drop kiek |
from 10 yards out.
This revival of the ancient art of j
drop-kicking gave Stanford the Coast
Rugby championship and knocked |
C.al from the undefeated ranks. It j
also marks the first defeat the Bears j
have suffered in league play since !
1941 when the Indians last turned the
t i ick.
Cal Takes Lend
Saturday's affair was a knock- ;
down drag-out battle from start to J
finish. Cal took an early 3 to 0 lead
when George Witter made good on a
penalty kick in the opening minutes j
of the game.
Seemingly inspired by this 3-point j
bulge, the Bear forwards began rush- 1
in.H the Stanford backs off their feet. '
Time and time again, the Card pass- I
ing rushes were interrupted by the
hard-charging Cal forwards.
With the start of the second half,
the tide of battle began to turn.
Sparked by the running of Sam
Thornton and Dick Hughes, the
Cards continuously threatened to
score, but great defensive work by
Bob Losey and Max Howell, who
repeatedly kicked the bal) out of
1 danger, cut short these Indian scoring
thrusts.
Time Running Out
In fact, those three points loomed
mighty big as time began running out
in the second half. Then from a line
out on Cal's 10-yard line, the Stan
ford forwards gained possession of
tnc ball and fed it out to Bob Oswald
who passed off to Peckham. Peck
ham found himself directly in front
1 of the goal posts, and calmly split

the uprights with the game-tying
kick.
Bradshaw then provided the j
clincher and he and Peckham were 1
carried off the field on the shoulders j
of their teammates.
The standouts in the forward di
vision lor the Indians were John !
Rosekrans, Ed Culin, and Captain
Mike Spiro.
Tomorrow afternoon in Stanford
Stadium the Cards will wind up the
1950 season when they take on the !
Thunderbirds of the University of ;
British Columbia. This will be the !
third game in a three-game series,
the Canadians having won the two
previous contests played up North.
Lineup for Stanford:
Front rank. Spiro, Littlehale, Re
gier; second rank, Poulson. Tobin; |
breakaway, Culin, Rosekrans; lock.
Stanley; halves: Bradshaw, scrum;
Banks, first; McColl, second; De-
Young, third; wings, Benson,

Jim Bradshaw's 40-yard drop
kick in the closing minutes of j
the game gave the Stanford
ruggers a well-earned, 6 to 3. |
victory over California at Berke
ley last Saturday. The score
was knotted at 3-all vvhen the
Cards were awarded a penalty
kick. With placekickers Bill
McColl and Ed Culin both on |
the bench, Coach Chuck Taylor
called on Bradshaw who then :
provided a storybook finish j
with his game-winning kick.
Sharing hero honors with Brad- |
shaw was Pete Peckham who. with j
three minutes remaining to play, tied j
tlie score with a running drop kiek |
from 10 yards out.
This revival of the ancient art of j
drop-kicking gave Stanford the Coast
Rugby championship and knocked |
C.al from the undefeated ranks. It j
also marks the first defeat the Bears j
have suffered in league play since !
1941 when the Indians last turned the
t i ick.
Cal Takes Lend
Saturday's affair was a knock- ;
down drag-out battle from start to J
finish. Cal took an early 3 to 0 lead
when George Witter made good on a
penalty kick in the opening minutes j
of the game.
Seemingly inspired by this 3-point j
bulge, the Bear forwards began rush- 1
in.H the Stanford backs off their feet. '
Time and time again, the Card pass- I
ing rushes were interrupted by the
hard-charging Cal forwards.
With the start of the second half,
the tide of battle began to turn.
Sparked by the running of Sam
Thornton and Dick Hughes, the
Cards continuously threatened to
score, but great defensive work by
Bob Losey and Max Howell, who
repeatedly kicked the bal) out of
1 danger, cut short these Indian scoring
thrusts.
Time Running Out
In fact, those three points loomed
mighty big as time began running out
in the second half. Then from a line
out on Cal's 10-yard line, the Stan
ford forwards gained possession of
tnc ball and fed it out to Bob Oswald
who passed off to Peckham. Peck
ham found himself directly in front
1 of the goal posts, and calmly split

the uprights with the game-tying
kick.
Bradshaw then provided the j
clincher and he and Peckham were 1
carried off the field on the shoulders j
of their teammates.
