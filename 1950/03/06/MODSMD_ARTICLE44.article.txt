# Three Original KZSU Programs Feature Top Farm Musical Talent
## Opera, Rag Mop Sound from 880 
### WALLY WHITE 
Three "live" music shows currently
grace the airwaves over KZSU, 880
on your dial. The three, all orig
inating from the KZSU studio, and
| not from a disc-jockey's turntable,
i include some oi Stanford's top talent.
"The Joy Boys," pianists Dick and
; Roy Roberts and bass-boy Art Segil,
j give the kilocycles a rugged time each
| Thursday night at 9:30.
Tenor Ted AtanasofT presents a
I quarter-hour of music and story Sun
days at 9:45 on his "Time to Relax."
Piano-playing Bill Bowles, banjo-
J strumming Seotty Doggett, and cow
j boy singer Dan Evans provide the
music each Wednesday at 9:30 on
i "Andre Presents."
"Joy Boys"
A well-known Farm team, the
three Joy Boys, all from Winnetka,
; 111., appeared in the 1949 Gaieties as
the "Vow-Vow Boys. They sang
Roy's "Low-Down, Uptown Gal."
; Recently they did a few numbers for
the Red Cross Student-Faculty Tal
| ent Show.
Their wares range from classical
i piano selections by old brother Roy,
to bebop, jazz, and boogie. They are
probably best known for their rendi
tions of modern music like "Route
66" and a retread of "Tea For Two."
With foot-stomping and rag-mop
voices, all three throw themselves
into the music and pull the listener
along.
Speaking of their Thursday show,
Roy commented, "We've decided to
scrap the script altogether." Music.
! gags, and spontaneous commercials
provide an anything-can-happen
half-hour.
Stories and Songs
In contrast with the furor of Rob
erts, Roberts, and Segil, is "Time to
Relax," presided over by singing
host Ted AtanasofT. Each Sunday the
versatile tenor, accompanied by Phil
Hudner, sings semi-classical num
l bers like "Come Back to Sorento,"
and "La Donne E Mobile."
Bob Simon, the show's announcer,
j tells a true story about music and
! musicians. "Not a composer's life,
nothing like that," said Ted., who
j takes opera lessons on the side. "Our
I stories are about the time Enrico Ca
ruso sang bass or when Irving Berlin
worked as a bartender."
On top of this, Ted usually intro
duces a musical guest. Singers Mari
lyn Hopwood, Suzy Marion, Jane
Troxell, and Svlvia Knowles, and ac

| eordion-player Wally Conroe have
| appeared on his show this quarter.
A carefully-rehearsed and fully-
I packed show, "Time to Relax" is a
| fast-moving quarter-hour.
Jazz By Doggett and Bowes
When "Four Leaf Clover', gets a
\ "rikki-tikki" treatment Wednesday
I night at 9:30, it's time for "Andre
Presents." Bill Bowles, pianist from
Piedmont, and Scotty Doggett, ex
j Horace Heidt banjo player, get to
j gether with a fast, jazz beat and play
j songs dating from the 1920 s or ear-
I lier.
Some classical music sneaks in
! when Bowles takes a solo, and all
j types of music are likely to find a
i place. Dan Evans, guitarist and

singer, slows the tempo with cowboy
ballads.
After 15 minutes of music, the three
musicians join announcer Kip Todd
in a quarter-hour of comedy.
Sophomore Bill, veteran of class
ical piano lessons, spent last sum
mer entertaining visitors in a State
line, Nev., club. This summer Scotty
plans to join him.
Scotty, a freshman, took up the
banjo three years ago when an acci
dent forced him to stop playing the
trumpet. In 1948 he won a weekly
prize on Horace Heidt's "Youth Op
portunity Program." In the summers
of '48 and '49 he toured with Heidt's
orchestra, playing a stand in Holly
wood Bowl.


I<ZSU"s "JOY BOYS" gather at the piano during one of their
weekly broadcasts. Left to right they are Dick Roberts, Art
Segil, and Roy Roberts. The three Winnetka, 111., boys present
a half-hour of music and gags each Thursday at 9:30 p.m. The
show is one of KZSU's three "live" music programs.
