# Big Population Growth Seen
## 
### 
| Fifty years from now the United
! States may have a population of 200
to 300 million, it has been predicted
by Dr. Joseph S. Davis, director of
, Stanford University's Food Re
j search Insttiute.
Dr. Davis cites three main factors
j in predicting a big population
growth:
1. More babies.
2. Increased life expectancy.
Immigration.
There are 17.000.000 children un
der five years of age in the United
States now, Dr. Davis says in a
j pamphlet, "The Population Upsurge
in the United States."
And when they grow up, he says,
they will have many more babies
, than you'd expect. Why? Earlier
j marriages, the ability to have more
children, and a desire for larger
I families, says Dr. Davis. More young

married couples are living in their
own homes now than in 1940, he
found. This, he says, also leads to
larger families.
Of longer-lived people. Dr. Davis
says the average man or woman of
70 today may be no older "in essen
tial respects" than one of 65 was in
1900.
Immigration has been increasing
faster than anyone expected. Dr.
Davis says. He thinks it will con
tinue to add substantially to our
population.
Can we feed all these people? Dr.
Davis thinks so.
