DELAKK, Ore.—A ton of aquatic
"what dat," give or take a few
pounds, had this little Oregon coast
al town in a Fourth of July tizzy
today—but there was a belief as
strong as its odor that the "sea mon
ster" was nothing but a giant squid.
The curious from miles around
flocked here by the hundreds to take
a nose-holding look at the 20-foot
mass tossed up by the sea Friday
night. The tide snatched it back
early Saturday and then washed it
ashore again, this time for good.
