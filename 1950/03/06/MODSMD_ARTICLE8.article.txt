# CONTRACT SIGNED
## Coal Miners Will Resume Work Today 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (/P)
The coal strike is over.
John L. Lewis and the operators
late today signed a contract sending
372,000 United Mine Workers back
to the soft, coal pits with a raise.
Tomorrow and Tuesday they will
begin digging after four weeks of
idleness which had pushed the na
tional economy to the edge of chaos.
Lewis got money gains averaging
$1.40 per man a day after a full
year's fight to wear down the na
tion's coal piles and the mine own
ers.
Gleeful miners, who had defied a
Taft-Hartley back-to-work injunc
tion because they had no contract,
acclaimed Lewis' smashing triumph.
Consumers got ready to pay more
for coal again as mining costs rose
1(5 to 23 cents a ton, according to an
industry estimate.
Back to Work
To 225,000 other breadwinners the
contract also meant return to work
soon. They had been forced into
idleness because the steel mills,
railroads, and other firms they
worked for had no coal to operate.
The contract, accepted by the
major operators of North, West, and
South, included the "captive" mines
owned by the steel companies, car
ried these provisions:
1. The miners' basic daily wage is
increased from $14.05 to $14.75.
2. Operators will pay 30 cents a
ton royalty into the fund for miners'
disability, hospital, medical, death,
and pension benefits. This will yield
an estimated $135,000,000 a year.
Keep Union Shop
3. The union shop is retained,
subject to court ruling. This re
quires that miners belong to the un
ion.
4. The clause saying miners wou'd
work only when "able and willing"
was replaced by one declaring the
good faith and "mutual understand
ing" of the two paries. This is in
tended to prevent the union being
sued in case of unauthorized strikes.
5. Memorial layofT periods arc
limited to five days a year. Pre
viously they have been a device for
calling strikes.
6. The contract runs to July 1,
1952, but can be opened for wage
discussions after April 1, 1951.
Stabili/.c Industry
7. All payments withheld from
the welfare fund since expiration of
the last contract must be paid by
March 15. This applies to 191
Southern operators said to have
held back an estimated $5,000,000.
The 28-month agreement was im
mediately hailed as a tremendous
factor toward stabilizing the indus
try. It was the biggest news in the
contract, terms as far as the miners
were concerned.
