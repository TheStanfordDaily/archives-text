## Leftist Lead Cut 
### 
A'lllKNS, March f> (A') —An early
leftist lead in yesterday's Greek
elections was cut sharply tonight as
the soldier vote began pouring in.
Keturns from 5 per cent of the
110,000 soldiers eligible to vote gave
Constantinc Tsaldaris' Populists—a
right-wing party —about a 3 to 1
advantage over Gen. Nicholas Plas
liras' leftist National Progressive
Union.
Political observers said if the
trend continues Tsaldaris' party will
win.
