# Cat Students Meet to Protest Oath
## 
### 
BERKELEY, March 6 (/P) A
clamorous audience of more than
! 8,00(1 University of California stu
dents today heard statements and
j speeches outlining the issues in the
| university's anti - Communist oath
j dispute.
At a noon meeting which filled
the Greek Theater on the Berke
j ley campus to capacity, students
cheered addresses by three profes
j sors expressing various degrees of
I opposition to the oath. They 1 is—
j toned coolly as a statement by Rc
! genl John Francis Neylan was read
to them.
Neylan has been the spokesman
for the majority of the university's
Board of Regents, which recently
established April 30 as the deadline
for all university employees to sift' l
the oath, stating they arc not mem
bers of the Communist party.
The Board of Regents ruled that
any of the university's 11,000 tcach
j ers and non-academic employees
! who do not comply with the order
will have automatically quit their
jobs, as of June .'lO.
I Faculty members who have or

ganized to oppose use of the oath, ,
in the courts if necessary, contend
thai its imposition is discriminatory.
They contend that the regular oath j
of office, prescribed in Ihe state con
stitution for all public officials,
should suffice.
Neylan's statement today chal
longed this contention, with the
question, "Why docs not the Aca- 1
deinic Senate (the faculty's govern
ing body) adopt a resolution in plain
English unequivocally endorsing the
policy of excluding Communists?
"Let us find out who objects to a
resolution in the following form:
" 'Resolved, that the Academic
Senate approve without qualifiea- j
tion the policy of the regents
adopted October 11, 11)40, and reaf
firmed June 2, 1!)4!), excluding Com
munists from employment in the
| university.'
"Until this fundamental question
is answered, the university will be
under suspicion."
Peter Odcgard, chairman of the
department of political science, an
swered the regent's statement, de- !
I daring, "We all agree that Comma- |

in l . hriiild be kepi off the faculty."
lie :;:iicj that tho faculty objected
to the manner in which the re
gents issuod the ultimatum direct
ing thai the oath he taken, ft was
;in ultimatum, he said, that eqtild be
regarded only as a violation-of the
basic principle of academic freedom, j
lie quoted from the state consti
tution, and staled, "The state oath is
sufficient to exclude Communists |
from the faculty and if this is not
so, then there are no other words
that will."
"Are we less to he trusted than
members of the Legislature, or law- i
yers or members of the armed
forces?" he asked.
"By undermining mutual trust
they, the cogens, will more quickly ,
do;,trey the university than by an
earthquake," Odegard said. "If Cal
ifornia yields to transitory fear and
distrc >ss, how can we expect weaker
institutions fo resist?"
Kobcrt A. Gordon, professor of i
economics, predicted the dispute
"wi'l be formally investigated by the
American Association of University
Professors and that will leave this |

university on (lie li.sl of ccnsurcd in
stitutions."
Gordon indicated that, on the
basis of the regents' statement that
86.5 per cent, of university employ
ees have signed the oath, 1.400 cm
ptoyee.s remain in danger of losing
their jobs. Approximately 450 of
these arc high-ranking professors,
he said.
"And there will be others who
leave also . • ■ who cannot stand
by and see their colleagues dis
missed for no other reason than
this."
Robert M. Stanley, Nnbel Prize
I winning biochemist, urged that new
efforts be made to resolve the dis-
I pule.
Today's meeting was sponsored by
, the Associated Students. It was not
h "protest" meeting, and StnHent ;
Body President Dan Coclho told the
audience that. But the students re
jected his statement with boos and
I catcalls.
Faculty leaders met tonight to i
map additional plans for action by
the entire northern section of the
1 Academic Senate, at its session here
I tomorrow.
