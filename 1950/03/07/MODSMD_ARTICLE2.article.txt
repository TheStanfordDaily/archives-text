LONDON â€” Winston Churchill's
Conservatives today challenged the
shaky Labor government to imme
diate battle on the issues of housing
and state ownership of the iron and
steel industry.
The Tories flung down the gaunt
let. after Prime Minister Attlee told
I lie new House of Commons his re
gime plans to yo ahead on the iron
and steel program.
Earlier, in all the regalia of tra
dition, King George had read to the
opening session of the new Parlia
ment the Labor government's policy
speech which omitted all mention of
further nationalization or Socialist
measures.
