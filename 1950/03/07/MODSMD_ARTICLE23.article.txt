# Open Season on Students

The thought ol trigger-happy dee/ hunters
taking pot shots at student surveyors and geol
ogists roaming over Stanford's 9,000 acres next
fall is not a very happy one to a University re
sponsible for molding 8,000 young lives, let
.ilone to those who have them to risk.
I'or this reason, the Board of Trustees and
I lie Administration are seeking every means
possible to keep Stanford land closed to hunt
ers despite recent State Fish and Game Com
mission action which opened up the refuge
here.
The decision will be appealed to the Com
mission by Stanford lawyers at the Commis
:>ion's next meeting in January 1951. Mean
while, the University will take advantage of
trespassing regulations provided by state law.

The action of the l»ish and Game Commis
sion which opened the 25-year-old refuge
came as a surprise to local observers, par
ticularly in view of the opposition to it. The
only visible opposition to keeping the refuge
closed came from the local game warden, who
said the game reserve was "too difficult to pa
trol."
There is tslill a chance that the Commission
will change its mind, but not until next Janu
ary when it mec.ts again. Meanwhile, start
ing August 7, the Stanford range will be "of
ficially" open as far as the state is concerned.
The University hopes, through publicity and
warning signs, to keep hunters out. As for the
students on field trips, there is always the old
hunters' standby and traditional Stanford head
gear—the red cap. —A.M.
