## Negroes at Stanford 
### 
To the Editor:
1 would like to commend Mr. Addison for his very
intelligent editorial in today's Daily about the absence
of Negroes at Stanford. That the administration has
no "official" attitude against the admission of members
of minority groups is again a good and laudable thing.
The heart of the whole matter, however, does not lie
in "official" attitudes, but in the outlook of the student
body as a whole. Stanford is more than a dispensary
of academic knowledge; it i.s a training ground for
living in a democratic society. It is a place where men
and women must learn to throw aside the racial and
i t ligious prejudices which, even if not positively ex
pressed, exist in the minds of a great number.
"Tolerance" is not the solution. "Tolerance" implies
"broad-mindedness" and condescension of the major
ity toward the minority group. The real basis lies in
brotherhood: in meeting and judging a man by the
color of his character, not the color of his skin; by
the shape of his mind, not the shape of his lips, nose,
or hair. This is not a thing which requires, as does
tolerance," a "logical" justification and rationalization
of attitude, but it is rather a condition of the mind
which is based on the deeper sense of the right and
the just.
An essential step toward attaining brotherhood in
our society is by providing the means whereby persons
of all origins can live together, work together, and
know one another. Perhaps the most potent cause of
radical and religious discrimination is man's age-old
fear of the "stranger." Only when man has the oppor
tunity of knowing the "stranger" does this fear vanish
along with the malodorous tales and rumors which
invariably accompany it. It is for this reason that I
believe we should strive to create a genuinely inter
national, interreligious, and interracial Stanford Fam
lly -
ff then, as Mr. Addison (and many others on cam
pus) suggested, Stanford actively solicits the attend
ance of Negroes, let every member of the Stanford
Family realize and know in his heart that, even though
they come "officially" as Negroes, they will each be
part of the Family. Action by the Administration is
not enough. Every man and woman at Stanford must
be acutely conscious that all men are brothers and
that all men are entitled to that respect and dignity
with which they were equally endowed by God.

To the Editor:
Orchids to Ronald Nelson for bringing such an im
portant issue to light!
1 must confess that I, too, during my three-and-a
half-years spent at Stanford, have been rather con
cerned with the conspicuous absence of Negro stu
dents at Stanford, especially at the undergraduate
level.
Numerous ideas have arisen from equally numerous
ources to attempt to explain this perplexing fact.
Admittedly, the high cost of education at Stanford has
been a satisfactory explanation in many cases. But
does it explain the dearth of Negroes at Stanford dur
ing the past four years, when veterans of all economic
tatuses have been able to secure higher education at.
:.ny university of their choice, through G.I. benefits?
The next possible explanation is almost so obvious
ts to be overlooked: few Negroes are applying to
! tanford. There can be no satisfactory answer to but
<.ne: Stanford's policy regarding acceptance of Negroes
is not clear to the public. This is not hard to under
stand when we consider that until a short time ago
race" end "religious preference" were items included
on t! o application blank, and at present an applica
tion • '-.otograph is required
An anplication photograph, so far as 1 know, can
only legitimately be used for one of two purposes:
1. 1 or identification, or future reference,
2. To get an idea of the physical characteristics of
the applicant.

If live first point is the use to which application pho
tographs are being put, all well and good. But why,
then, is photograph-taking still included in the stand
ard registration procedure for newly-entering students
if the University already has the identification photo
submitted by the applicant? Or to put it the other
way, why require the application (identification)
photo if you are going to get identification photos on
reg day? The inadequacy of this explanation leaves
us to accept a rather invidious alternative.
'Die editorial in Monday's Daily imputes to the
Registrar the claim that the photo is being used to
serve "as a tremendous aid for 'sizing up' the indi
vidual." It i.s extremely difficult and distasteful for me
to believe that the Registrar holds such a view, espe
cially in the light that competent social psycholgists
have offered experimental verification for the fact that
no one is able to judge intelligence, personality char
acteristics, or probable success of an individual with
whose photograph he is confronted with any degree
of accuracy better than chance.
In conclusion, if we reahy are interested in receiving
Negroes into the Stanford community, as many of us
say we are, in order to eliminate the ambiguity of
purpose, we should delete the photograph requirement
from our application blanks—as an additional step
toward achieving a more democratic atmosphere at
Stanford.
