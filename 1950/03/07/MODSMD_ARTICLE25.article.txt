# Cellar Music

To the Editor:
Let me add my voice to that of Mr. Bernstein in his
letter of Friday about the captive audience at the
Cellar. I believe there is a sizeable segment of our
.student body which is sick and tired of having the loud
advertisements arid blaring music crammed down its
throats all day long. It's bad enough to have to listen
to the nauseous commercials every time we turn on
our radios, but it's too much when we are bombarded
with a barage of noise every time we are near the
Cellar.
My chief objection is that the noise propagated by
these would-i.e hucksters of various wares penetrates
even to the sacred depths of the Education Building
Library, where many of us try in vain to do a little
studying before our finals begin. Even the most sea
soned party-boys among us will admit the need for
a little study now and then, and when it can't be done
in the library, where can we go!
