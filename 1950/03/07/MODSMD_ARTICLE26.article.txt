# New Post Office
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Reading your two editorials of recent date on the
new Stanford Union of the future, I want to bring to
The Stanford Daily's attention and the University
public the much-forgotten U.S. Post Office. Every
body (especially those employed at the Post Office)
knows, or should know, that the much-needed project
on the Stanford campus is a new Post Office. It's long
outgrown and long needed and quite inadequate. If
the plans for the future Union are to include a new
Post Office at, has been suggested, let's not wait too
long. If the University has other ideas or plans, let's
urge the power that-he 1o put the new Post Office
first on the agenda.
I note that, the Bookstore site is preferable for the
location of the new Union, and my comments are that
the Union oughl to be located on Santa Teresa, where
parking and traffic could be accommodated and han
dled This would not be possible on Lasuen.
