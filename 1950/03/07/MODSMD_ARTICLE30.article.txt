## 
### 
(Kdftor's note: The following'
information was compiled for stu
dents by the Stanford Comptrol
ler's office.)
Students who have woi-ked dur
ing 1949 may be entitled to a refund
of all or most of the taxes withheld
from their pay, and should file tax
form 1040 or 1040 A to claim this re
fund from the Collector of Internal
Revenue.
By consulting the tux tables on
the back page of form 1040, actual
tax liability can be easily deter
mined. This liability starts only
when the individual has earned $075
or more during the calendar year.
Compensation in the form of room
and/or board does not constitute
taxable income where the condition
of accepting the room and/or board
is required by the employer.
'taxes withheld at source from the
the earnings of the students would
have been at a rate calculated at the
annual rate of earnings in accord
ance with the regulations of the Col
lector of Internal Revenue.
Since many students worked only
part of the year, the taxes withheld
on an annual basis would have been
greatly in excess of the actual lax
liability.
For example, if a single student
worked for the University during
eight months of the school year and
earned $100 per month, he would
have had taxes withheld from his
income of $6.90 per month totaling
$55.20 for the entire period.
He would have earned $800 and
his tax liability would be only $22;
a refund of $33 is therefore due him.
