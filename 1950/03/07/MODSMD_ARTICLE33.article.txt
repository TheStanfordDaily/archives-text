# RATHBORNE EXPLAINS REVERSAL
## Witness Restates Stand On Bridges' War Effort 
### JOY HAAS 
Red-faced Mervyn Rathborne, the .
government's main witness in the >
Harry Bridges perjury trial, yester- j
day reaffirmed a former statement
in which he placed Harry Bridges I
alongside Franklin Roosevelt and
Philip Murray as Americans who
he believed had contributed most to j
America's war effort.
Judge George B. Harris granted
Rathborne permission to tell the j
jury why he had reversed his po
sition from defending Bridges in
1943, to opposing him now.
Rathborne said he agreed with a
speech by Philip Murray in 1943,
which stated that Bridges was a
valuable American, doing his part
by expediting war shipments from
West Coast ports, and that his op
position was based on "hatred and
prejudices."
Objectives Changed
However, Rathborne explained, at
that time the Communists had lol
lowed a program to do everything
in their power to aid the war effort, j
but since the war they have changed
their objectives.
"I believe that following the
(Communist) line now is inimical
to the best interests of labor, and
is inimical to the best interests of
this country," the witness said.
The beginning of the hour-long
cross-examination of Rathborne by
defense attorney Vincent Hallinan
was more like a rehearsal than an
actual trial. The four women mem
bers of the jury set the stage when
they marched in wearing white cor
sages; Judge Harris propped his
chin in his hand and waited.

Rathborne took the stand and was
presented with a Washington daily
newspaper dated June 23, 1949. He
climbed upon the judge's stand to |
get enough light to read an adver- J
tisement that attributed the pro
longed Hawaiian longshoremen's
strike to Communistic influences.
Hallinan got down to line points j
when he asked Rathborne, "A per- j
son can be a Communist and still
not be a member of the party, can't j
he?"
"I suppose that's right, you could !
make that distinction," Rathborne j
agreed.
Hunched in his chair, Bridges' I
bony profile showed little change of |
expression as he listened to Halli- j

nan's Fred Allen-like voice hammer
away at Rathborne in an effort to
persuade the jury that Bridges is an
object of persecution by the govern
ment.
Questioning Rathborne about a
conference he had with Attorney
General Clark, Hallinan won an ad
mission that Clark had not men
tioned a perjury or technical Com
munist membership count against
Bridges.
Special prosecutor F. Joseph Don
ohue, at one point, objected to a
particular line of questioning by
Hallinan as irrelevant. Hallinan
turned on him and snapped, "Just
hold on, you'll get your belly-l'ul!
before this is over." Donohue
shrugged.
Arid today, the trial drags into its
65th day.

away at Rathborne in an effort to
persuade the jury that Bridges is an
object of persecution by the govern
ment.
Questioning Rathborne about a
conference he had with Attorney
General Clark, Hallinan won an ad
mission that Clark had not men
tioned a perjury or technical Com
munist membership count against
Bridges.
Special prosecutor F. Joseph Don
ohue, at one point, objected to a
particular line of questioning by
Hallinan as irrelevant. Hallinan
turned on him and snapped, "Just
hold on, you'll get your belly-l'ul!
before this is over." Donohue
shrugged.
Arid today, the trial drags into its
65th day.
Red-faced Mervyn Rathborne, the .
government's main witness in the >
Harry Bridges perjury trial, yester- j
day reaffirmed a former statement
in which he placed Harry Bridges I
alongside Franklin Roosevelt and
Philip Murray as Americans who
he believed had contributed most to j
America's war effort.
Judge George B. Harris granted
Rathborne permission to tell the j
jury why he had reversed his po
sition from defending Bridges in
1943, to opposing him now.
Rathborne said he agreed with a
speech by Philip Murray in 1943,
which stated that Bridges was a
valuable American, doing his part
by expediting war shipments from
West Coast ports, and that his op
position was based on "hatred and
prejudices."
Objectives Changed
However, Rathborne explained, at
that time the Communists had lol
lowed a program to do everything
in their power to aid the war effort, j
but since the war they have changed
their objectives.
"I believe that following the
(Communist) line now is inimical
to the best interests of labor, and
is inimical to the best interests of
this country," the witness said.
The beginning of the hour-long
cross-examination of Rathborne by
defense attorney Vincent Hallinan
was more like a rehearsal than an
actual trial. The four women mem
bers of the jury set the stage when
they marched in wearing white cor
sages; Judge Harris propped his
chin in his hand and waited.

Rathborne took the stand and was
presented with a Washington daily
newspaper dated June 23, 1949. He
climbed upon the judge's stand to |
get enough light to read an adver- J
tisement that attributed the pro
longed Hawaiian longshoremen's
strike to Communistic influences.
Hallinan got down to line points j
when he asked Rathborne, "A per- j
son can be a Communist and still
not be a member of the party, can't j
he?"
"I suppose that's right, you could !
make that distinction," Rathborne j
agreed.
Hunched in his chair, Bridges' I
bony profile showed little change of |
expression as he listened to Halli- j

nan's Fred Allen-like voice hammer
away at Rathborne in an effort to

ment.
