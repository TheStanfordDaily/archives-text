# Thunderbird Ruggers Invade Stadium Today
## 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Stanford ruggers, with the Coast title safely tucked under
their belts, will ring down the curtain on the 1950 season this
afternoon when they take on the University of British Columbia in
Stanford Stadium. Kickoff is slated for 3:30.
The Card fifteen will be out to avenge two earlier losses at the

hands of the Thunderbirds whose
wins over the formet up north are
the only black marks on Stanford's
I otherwise perfect record.
The Canadians are led by Russ
1 Latham and Captain Les Hempsall.
Latham handles the place kicking
for the Northerners, and the Indians
have bitter memories of him since
; it was Latham's educated toe which
, accounted for 14 of British Colum
bia's 17 points in the second game.
Latham is now playing his fourth
! year on the Thunderbircl team.
Hempsall is the big man in the '
scrum for the Canadians. Les, a
third-year man, holds down a front
row position where he uses his
speed and strength to good advan
tage.
The Indian scrum outweighs the
visitors by approximately 10 pounds
per man, but this means nothing as

the Northerners proved by their 17-
9 and 11-8 victories last month.
Stanford's main strategy will be to
prevent Latham from getting any
penalty kick opportunities.
Stanford will open with the same
lineup which started against Cali
fornia last Saturday. Bill Geary is
still having leg trouble, and Jim
Bradshaw (of drop kicking fame)
will continue to fill in for him at
the scrum half slot.
General admission fee lias been
set at 80 cents, while student body
card holders will be charged 50
cents.
Incidentally the rugby team held
their annual banquet last night in
San Francisco. The banquet was
donated by the Rainier Brewing
Company.


JOHN KOSEKKANS, veteran for
ward, will close out his college
rugby career today against the
Thunderbirds from British Co
lumbia.
