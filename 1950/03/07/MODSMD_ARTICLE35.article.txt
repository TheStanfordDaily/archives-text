# Netmen Open Season Today; Meet Broncos at Santa Clara
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Coach Elwyn Bugge will take the
wraps off his varsity tennis team for
the first time this season. The net
ters tackle the Santa Clara Broncos
this afternoon on the foreign courts.
With powerful additions from last
year's frosh and lots of hard prac
tice already this quarter, the var
sity appears ready' to play through
a tough season with reasonable suc
cess. This afternoon will not be too
good an indicator, as two key men
will not see action and Santa Clara
does not have very much courtwise,
Barbour Handles One
Lucien Barbour will see action
against the Broncs' number one
man. He fills in for Kirke Mechem,
who returns this year as the top
Card ace. Both are veterahs, but
Kirke will not play today.
Up from last year's freshman team
and playing a very good game, Tom
Lewyn moves in right behind the
more experienced lettermen. Lewyn
will also play number one doubles
with Ernie Dußray, another soph.
Rounding out the singles men for

today's matches are Vincie Schmie
der, a returning letterman; Dußray;
Jack White and Phil Nielson, both
from last year's varsity. The singles
will be played in the above order.
Gentry Out
George Gentry, who is another
top prospect and was top man on
the frosh, is missing from the lineup.
Still recuperating from his elbow
trouble and not able to get in shape,
George will not play until Saturday.
Then the varsity tackles the Olym
pic Club.
Doubles combinations for today
will be: Lewyn-Dußray, Barbour-
Schmeider, and White-Nielson.
Tomorrow Gentry and Dußray
will play a ladder match, and the
frosh will get their first outing. The
yearlings meet the San Jose High
School.
Frosh Play, Too
As the ladder now stands, the
Papooses play in this order: Charlie
Hickox, Bob Sibert, Skip Irving, Ed
Henderson, Howard Willens, Jim
Andreas, Dave Bernard, and Roy
Alexander.
