# Cards Third In PA Swim
## 
### 
Eleven Stanford mermen are back
from the Southland today more con
vinced than ever that they have a
battle on their hands come May G
when they meet USC's defending
PCC champs.
The best of Haynie's squad—along
with the nuclei of COP, UCLA, and
USC's swimming teams — entered
the Southern Pacific Association
meet at Beverly Hills over the
weekend and came out a poor third.
The Trojans won the team title with
61 points; Pacific followed with 38
markers, and the Indians totaled 33
plus the sportsmanship trophy.
The expected duel between Wally
Wolf and Pete Cole in the quarter
was the feature race of the meet.
Wolf and Cole finished in a dead
heat at 4:53 according to the stop
watches, but the diminutive Trojan
received the officials' nod two
judges to one.
Stanford's sensational four - man
relay composed of Ernie Polte, Bob
Frojen, Bruce Putnam, and Dave
Chapman brought the Farm its only
gold medal. Time: 3:38.5.
