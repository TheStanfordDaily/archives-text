## 
### 
Women's Council voted Wcdncs- j
j day afternoon to submit a proposal j
! to AWS Social Regulations Commit- '
j tee that women's residences be al- j
| lowed 12 o'clock "automatics" on |
Sunday nights.
An "automatic" occurs when the ;
; residence remains open beyond the !
! regular closing hour because of a |
| house function. This means that i
{ men may be in the residence and
J girls may stay out until the hour for j
{ which the "automatic" is granted.
The present ruling concerning
j automatics is as follows:
Each women's residence has one !
j automatic 1:30 per quarter for !
| which it need not petition. Any fur
i ther automatics, however, must be
; petitioned for to Council.
These automatics are effective j
only for Friday or Saturday nights i
when houses remain open ordinarily
until 12 midnight. At present there
is no ruling covering Sunday night
when closing hours arc 10:30.
For the convenience of residences
| wishing to hold a social function on
; Sunday night which would last be
yond closing hours, Council has
suggested the 12 o'clock automatic.
Houses would have to petition
Council for them. These automatics
| would be in addition to the regular
1:30 weekend automatic which ev
ery residence is allowed each quar
ter without petitioning.
