# Post Describes Hoover Libe's Vast Records
## 
### 
Hoover Libray is attributed with
having more records on the Rod j
revolution than the Russians, more j
data on Mussolini than Italy, and the |
most complete record available on i
Hitler and the Nazi movement.
These claims are set forth in the j
current issue of the Saturday Eve- j
ning Post by Frank J. Taylor, who ;
describes the vast network of agents I
employed in the collection of library I
material by "Herbert Hoover, Inter- '
national Detective."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur once de- j
scribed Mr. Hoover as "the greatest. !
packrat of all times, because when- i
ever Hoover left, a ton of food, he
picked up a pound of history."
The ton of food referred to Mr.
Hoover's post-World War I rehabili
tation program which made him fam
ous and loved among Europeans. Out
of the relief work developed "Opera
tion Pack Rat," now a $.'>,.'300,M0
project.
Mi - . Hoover's world-famous col
lection of modern historical data is
housed in Hoover Tower, sometimes
referred to as the Tower of Peace, j
Much of the program of collection i
has been financed by the ex-Presi
dent himself. Friends have added the
rest. The University contributes j
$100,000 a year out of endowment to
wards the maintenance of the library,
according to the story.
Many part- and full-time agents
collect, material for the library
shelves. Their exploits on both sides
of national boundaries throughout I
the world are legend among mem- '
hers of the staff.
