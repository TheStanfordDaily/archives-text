A'IIIFNS — Constantin Tsaldaris'
Populist (royalist) party held its
slight lead over the leftist National
Progressive Union as late returns
from Sunday's Greek parliamentary
elections trickled in tonight.
Political observers said a coalition
government made up of the leftist
National Progressive Union and
three center parties probably will
eventually emerge from the elec
tion.
Tsaldaris* margin was beleived too
slim for him to be able to form a
lasting government.
