### BILL DAILEY 
(Editor's Note.-—Today we lake greal joy m pre
enting the last in our serifs of articles on "Choos
\u$ Your Major." Our topic, "So You're Going to
tjcr in Engineerings Eh?" will be discussed by Dr.
u. "Atomic Bum" Dailey, the eminent engineer,
txakeman, and peanut butcher on the Acheson, To-

jieka, and Santa Anita Railroad.)
t: >fore I begin my lecture for
today, I would like to answer
omc of my critics who have dared
to doubt the quality of my educa
tion. Needless to say, 1 am a man
of many letters, most of them
from hotels who want their towels
hack. ?
!'.peaking of letters, J am re
minded of my athletic prowess in
my undergraduate days. I was a
lour-letter man. In fact, my name

■ as synonymous with four-letter words.
But 1 digress. I shall return to the subject of engi
m j eiing. Generally speaking, there are four main
i /pes of engineers: Mechanical Engineer-, Electrical
I n.i'ineers (they get a big charge out of their work),
• ivil Engineers, and Uncivil Engineer: (Employed
by the government.)
Now for all of you men who want to become engi
n ?ers, I shall outline the courses which you should

take in college:
(I > C.E It Hi: Fluid Analysis ... Friday, 2-G ... Ro
sotti's.
(2) C.E. 294: Arch Analysis ... This course consists of
playing "footsie" with all the different instructors
in the department. The final exam consists of an
alyzing their arches and identifying them thereby.
(.'»> For those who are interested in a concrete sub
ject, we recommend the following course: C.E.
191: "Concrete."
(-!> C.E. 293:. "Foundations" ... Prerequisites: A size
18 body and a size 14 dress.
(5) EE. lUB "Illumination": Taught by Professor D.
Ellington, author of that famous work on illumina
tion, "I'm Beginuing to See The Light."
(fi) E.E. 2.'il: "Vacuum Tube Design" ... Study of well
known vacuum tubes, such as John Hall's head.
(7; ME. 202: "Theory of Elasticity" ... taught by Pro
fessor Alger Hiss, who will soonjbegin a stretch.
(8) ME. 1 "Forging" ... taught by my uncle Louie.
(On leave, 1950 to 1970 ... address all correspon
dence in care of Clinton Duffy, San Quentin Cali
fornia.)
(»> M E. 240B: "Wing Theory" ... a course consisting
of held trips to San Francisco to observe wing
theories in such well-known laboratories as "The
Black Cat," "Finocchio's," and"The Beige Club."
(Ill) C.E. 257: "Transportation Problems" ... consists
of getting your drunken roommate home from
Dinah's at 2 a.m. Sunday.

my undergraduate days. I was a
lour-letter man. In fact, my name

■ as synonymous with four-letter words.
But 1 digress. I shall return to the subject of engi
m j eiing. Generally speaking, there are four main
i /pes of engineers: Mechanical Engineer-, Electrical
I n.i'ineers (they get a big charge out of their work),
• ivil Engineers, and Uncivil Engineer: (Employed
by the government.)
Now for all of you men who want to become engi
n ?ers, I shall outline the courses which you should

take in college:
(I > C.E It Hi: Fluid Analysis ... Friday, 2-G ... Ro
sotti's.
(2) C.E. 294: Arch Analysis ... This course consists of
playing "footsie" with all the different instructors
in the department. The final exam consists of an
alyzing their arches and identifying them thereby.
(.'»> For those who are interested in a concrete sub
ject, we recommend the following course: C.E.
191: "Concrete."
(-!> C.E. 293:. "Foundations" ... Prerequisites: A size
18 body and a size 14 dress.
(5) EE. lUB "Illumination": Taught by Professor D.
Ellington, author of that famous work on illumina
tion, "I'm Beginuing to See The Light."
(fi) E.E. 2.'il: "Vacuum Tube Design" ... Study of well
known vacuum tubes, such as John Hall's head.
(7; ME. 202: "Theory of Elasticity" ... taught by Pro
fessor Alger Hiss, who will soonjbegin a stretch.
(8) ME. 1 "Forging" ... taught by my uncle Louie.
(On leave, 1950 to 1970 ... address all correspon
dence in care of Clinton Duffy, San Quentin Cali
fornia.)
(»> M E. 240B: "Wing Theory" ... a course consisting
of held trips to San Francisco to observe wing
theories in such well-known laboratories as "The
Black Cat," "Finocchio's," and"The Beige Club."
(Ill) C.E. 257: "Transportation Problems" ... consists
of getting your drunken roommate home from
Dinah's at 2 a.m. Sunday.
