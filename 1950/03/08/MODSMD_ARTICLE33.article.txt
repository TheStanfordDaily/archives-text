## Negroes al Stanford 
### 
To the Editor:
We, the members of the Stanford Chapter of the
/National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, have been pleased to see the interest shown by
various members of our student body in questioning
the absence of Negroes at Stanford.
We recognize education to be one of the most im
portant avenues for advancement, thus the absence of
Negro students at Stanford is deplorable not only from
the standpoint of the Negro, but also due to the fact
i hat we are depriving ourselves of an important part
of our education.
it is one of the primary aims of our organization to
inciease the Negro enrollment at Stanfoid. We assume
that the high cost of education here, couplud with a
belief that Stanford follows a discriminatory policy
toward Negroes, is a prime reason toi the failure of
i /egroes to apply.
In furtherance of our aim we are sending repre
< utatives to local high schools to interview potential
Negro applicants, in order to acquaint them with Stan
lord's nondiscriminatory policy and to inform them ol
.aiouf! scholarship possibilties. Furthermore, to en
' Uifrage transfer students from other colleges and uni
ei ■ ities, we have written letters to Negro universities
cquainting them with our interest in encouraging
Negro enrollment here.
In reference to the present controversy concerning
the inclusion of a photograph in the application for
..'.(mission, we feel that although the Admissions Com
mittee has offered persuasive argument.; in favor of
the requirement, the ambiguity engendered by it dis
courages potential Negro applicants Ironi returning
• uch an application. Therefore, we advocate its ex
clusion.
Realizing the magnitude of the situation and the
necessity for prompt action, we welcome assistance
112 rom all those v/ho share our interest in these goals.

To the Editor:
it is saiil that until a short time ago "race" and "re
ligious preference" were items included on the appli
cation blank. What of it? I can recall, during the war,
letters from one of my Stanford friends who enjoyed
Jefferson Barracks as little as 1 enjoyed Fort Benjamin
I iarison.
Could it. be that certain people are barking up the
wrong tree? Do these ptople who write about a cer
tain topic themselves discriminate? To be specific,
there is a very good colored barber in Palo Alto.
Would they patronize him (I do) even though he may
not have a union card.
Why don't the self-styled "liberals" try to pass mea
sures curbing governmental pampering of Jim Crow
unions? 'I liat might do something for the economic
advancement of certain minority groups so they could
afford to come to Stanford on their own.

it is saiil that until a short time ago "race" and "re
ligious preference" were items included on the appli
cation blank. What of it? I can recall, during the war,
letters from one of my Stanford friends who enjoyed
Jefferson Barracks as little as 1 enjoyed Fort Benjamin
I iarison.
Could it. be that certain people are barking up the
wrong tree? Do these ptople who write about a cer
tain topic themselves discriminate? To be specific,
there is a very good colored barber in Palo Alto.
Would they patronize him (I do) even though he may
not have a union card.
Why don't the self-styled "liberals" try to pass mea
sures curbing governmental pampering of Jim Crow
unions? 'I liat might do something for the economic
advancement of certain minority groups so they could
afford to come to Stanford on their own.

To the Editor:
We, the members of the Stanford Chapter of the
/National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, have been pleased to see the interest shown by
various members of our student body in questioning
the absence of Negroes at Stanford.
We recognize education to be one of the most im
portant avenues for advancement, thus the absence of
Negro students at Stanford is deplorable not only from
the standpoint of the Negro, but also due to the fact
i hat we are depriving ourselves of an important part
of our education.
it is one of the primary aims of our organization to
inciease the Negro enrollment at Stanfoid. We assume
that the high cost of education here, couplud with a
belief that Stanford follows a discriminatory policy
