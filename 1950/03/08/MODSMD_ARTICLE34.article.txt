To the Editor:
What is a game refuge for For squirrels and blue
jays For small hoys with BB guns and cats from
Palo Alto For doggie lovers to exercise their pets?
(I recall talking to a woman near the Stadium one
morning who boasted that her greyhound tore apart
a rabbit almost every day)
Ot course, quail eat seeds, and if there should be any
deer, they might be even more destructive to a garden,
but it was convenient to tell adolescents at Eneina
that a state law provided that they couldn't have guns!
Maybe the action referred to in yesterday's edi
torial i merely to make "<!e jure" what has already
become "de facto."
