# Stanford Rugbymen Gain 8 to 3 Revenge on UBC
## Boyd Benson Scampers 65 Yards For A Try; Banks, Culin Score on Kicks 
### CRAYTON JONES 
The Stanford ruggers closed out
the 1950 season in a blaze of glory
yesterday afternoon as they downed
a fighting British Columbia team 8
to 3 in Stanford Stadium. It was
sweet revenge for the Indians, who
dropped both ÜBC games played vip
north last month.
The Cards built up an early 8 to
0 lead and then held the speedy
Canadians at bay for the remainder
of the afternoon.
Stanford drew first blood in the
opening minutes of the game on
John Bank's running drop kick
from 10 yards out. The play was set
up on long runs by Dick Hughes
arid Bi! 1 McColl which carried the
ball to the five-yard line where a
serum was called. After several
false starts the Card forwards
heeled the ball out to scrum half
Jim Bradshaw who passed out to
Hanks for the kick, and the Indians
had a 3 to 0 lead.
Shortly thereafter McColl inter
rupted a T'hunderbird passing rush
at midfield and sprinted to the 20
where he passed off to Bob Stanley
who went across. But blocking was
detected on the play, and the score
was disallowed.
Rut the Indians were riot to be
denied. A few minutes later Boyd
Benson broke loose for a 65-yard
gallop to pay dirt. Benson was
.seemingly trapped on the ÜBC 20-
yard line but using his famous
change-of-paee routine to good ad
v;.nt;ji?e he neatly eluded four de
fenders, leaving them fiat - footed
arid open-mouthed. Ed Culin con
verted.
The first part of the second half
saw the Canadians go on the oft'en
ive with the forwards effectively
employing a dribbling rush. But
timely and well - placed kicks by

McColl, Vance Sheffey, and Pete
Peckham saved the day.
The lone Thiinderbird score came
in the second half on a penalty kick
by Russ Latham.
The Canadians will now move on

to Berkeley where they take on the
Bears on Thursday and Saturday.
These are the first two games of a
four-game series for the World Cup
which the Bears won from the
Thunderbirds last year.
Thus ends one of the most suc
cessful rugby seasons in Stanford's
history. This year the Cards copped
the Coast rugby championship and
finished the season with a record of
6 wins and 2 losses. The big victory
was the G to 3 vanquishing of Cal
and yesterday's triumph indicated
that the Indian ruggers can handle
the best from Canada.

who went across. But blocking was
detected on the play, and the score
was disallowed.
Rut the Indians were riot to be
denied. A few minutes later Boyd
Benson broke loose for a 65-yard
gallop to pay dirt. Benson was
.seemingly trapped on the ÜBC 20-
yard line but using his famous
change-of-paee routine to good ad
v;.nt;ji?e he neatly eluded four de
fenders, leaving them fiat - footed
arid open-mouthed. Ed Culin con
verted.
The first part of the second half
saw the Canadians go on the oft'en
ive with the forwards effectively
employing a dribbling rush. But
timely and well - placed kicks by

McColl, Vance Sheffey, and Pete
Peckham saved the day.
The lone Thiinderbird score came
in the second half on a penalty kick
by Russ Latham.
The Canadians will now move on

to Berkeley where they take on the
Bears on Thursday and Saturday.
These are the first two games of a
four-game series for the World Cup
which the Bears won from the
Thunderbirds last year.
Thus ends one of the most suc
cessful rugby seasons in Stanford's
history. This year the Cards copped
the Coast rugby championship and
finished the season with a record of
6 wins and 2 losses. The big victory
was the G to 3 vanquishing of Cal
and yesterday's triumph indicated
that the Indian ruggers can handle
the best from Canada.

The Stanford ruggers closed out
the 1950 season in a blaze of glory
yesterday afternoon as they downed
a fighting British Columbia team 8
to 3 in Stanford Stadium. It was
sweet revenge for the Indians, who
dropped both ÜBC games played vip
north last month.
The Cards built up an early 8 to
0 lead and then held the speedy
Canadians at bay for the remainder
of the afternoon.
Stanford drew first blood in the
opening minutes of the game on
John Bank's running drop kick
from 10 yards out. The play was set
up on long runs by Dick Hughes
arid Bi! 1 McColl which carried the
ball to the five-yard line where a
serum was called. After several
false starts the Card forwards
heeled the ball out to scrum half
Jim Bradshaw who passed out to
Hanks for the kick, and the Indians
had a 3 to 0 lead.
Shortly thereafter McColl inter
rupted a T'hunderbird passing rush
at midfield and sprinted to the 20
where he passed off to Bob Stanley
who went across. But blocking was
detected on the play, and the score
was disallowed.
Rut the Indians were riot to be
