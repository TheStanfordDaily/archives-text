# Phi Sigma I Gets to finals
## 
### 
With forward Floyd West doing a
good imitation of George Yardley,
Phi Sigma Kappa I yawned to an
effortless Gl to 18 victory over Kap
pa Sigma I to take the intramural
basketball title in league 10.
West was a one-man hurricane as
he meshed '28 points, 10 more than
the whole Kappa Sig ' team could
muster. Spark Baker and Matt
Sehmutz of the victors tanked 14
and 13, respectively.
There was never any doubt as to
the outcome, as Baker opened the
game with a field goal and the sen
sational West tallied six straight
points to make the score 8 to 0.
Kappa Sig came back with a free
shot by Larry Smith and a set shot
by Will Daegling, but four consecu
tive points by West iced the game.
With the score standing 33 to 8
at the beginning of the second half,
the Kappa Sigs made a comeback
try with four straight points, but
their glory was short-lived as West
and mates put on the damper with
a scoring spree of hteir own.
