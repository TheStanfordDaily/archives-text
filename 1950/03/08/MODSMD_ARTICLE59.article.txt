## Card Nine Plays Today 
### BILL SWIGART 
A group of wood and leather ar
tists known in these parts only as
the Richmond team frdm San Fran
cisco. will storm the Sunken Dia
mond this afternoon to provide
more non - league competition for
Coach Everett Dean's Stanford j
baseballers. Game time will be the
usual weekday 3:15.
An air of mystery surrounds the
Richmond aggregation because no
one seems to know just who they
are, what league they play in, or
who is in the lineup. What's more,
no one seems to particularly care.
'1 lie important thing is that nine
gentlemen, capable of wielding a bat
and throwing a ball, will be on hand
at the local ball field today to give
the Indian horsehiders their sev- ;
enth test of the year.
The Cards have passed four such i
tests this season, flunked two, and j
are currently working on a win !
streak of three straight.
Alter today, Coach Dean's charges J
will play two more non-conference j
games, one Saturday and one next !
Monday, before knocking off to hit j
the books for finals.
Replay Today
Today's game is a playoff of the j
scheduled season's opener that was j
rained out on February 11. The San
Francisco Seals were tentatively
scheduled, but Lefty O'Doul's
charges now find it impossible to '
get up from El Centro where the |
Seals are in spring camp, so the I
Richmond team was rescheduled.
The game Saturday is with the j
San Francisco Police Department,
another late addition to the baseball
slate. The Bay City keepers of law
and order have been working out
all winter, but it was not official
until last week that the department
would field a team this year. When
the announcement was made, the
game was added.
After finals, a busy five - game
schedule is on tap for vacation
week, including a road trip which
will end up at Joe E. Brown Field in
Westwood, and a two-game season
opening series with UCLA.
Pitchers Wild
The Indians have generally i
shown up well in the games played j
to date, but still lack consistency in j
pitching and in hitting. Five Stan- j
f:>rd pitchers have allowed 38 bases j
on balls and 49 hits in 54 innings, i
which isn't good. The team batting j
mark stands at a lowly .230, but a |
yood many of the hits have come j
in the clutch when they've been j
needed.
Expected to toe the slab for Stan- i
ford this afternoon are Jack Heinen, j
the fireball ing right - hander whose i
fast bal! looks like an asperin tab- j
let coming up to the plate, and soph- j
omore southpaw Frank Hamilton.
Heinen Developing
Coach Dean plans to use these two j
today and again on Monday against J
the S.F. Fire Department, leaving i
Jim Claypool and Dave Stott ready
to face the police Saturday.
Coach Everet Dean reported to
the Sunken Diamond for full-time
duty for the first time on Monday,
and with him he brought four in

fielders from the basketball squad.
They are Dick Clcgg, starting first
baseman last year, and sophomores
Harry Hugasian, Bruce Iverson, and
Jim Walsh.
As expected, Dean gave Clegg a
glove with five fingers in it and sent
him out to shag flies in the out
field. But just where Hugasian,
Iverson, and Walsh will try to fit
in remains to be seen.

Iverson, and Walsh will try to fit
in remains to be seen.
A group of wood and leather ar
tists known in these parts only as
the Richmond team frdm San Fran
cisco. will storm the Sunken Dia
mond this afternoon to provide
more non - league competition for
Coach Everett Dean's Stanford j
baseballers. Game time will be the
usual weekday 3:15.
An air of mystery surrounds the
Richmond aggregation because no
one seems to know just who they
are, what league they play in, or
who is in the lineup. What's more,
no one seems to particularly care.
'1 lie important thing is that nine
gentlemen, capable of wielding a bat
and throwing a ball, will be on hand
at the local ball field today to give
the Indian horsehiders their sev- ;
enth test of the year.
The Cards have passed four such i
tests this season, flunked two, and j
are currently working on a win !
streak of three straight.
Alter today, Coach Dean's charges J
will play two more non-conference j
games, one Saturday and one next !
Monday, before knocking off to hit j
the books for finals.
Replay Today
Today's game is a playoff of the j
scheduled season's opener that was j
rained out on February 11. The San
Francisco Seals were tentatively
scheduled, but Lefty O'Doul's
charges now find it impossible to '
get up from El Centro where the |
Seals are in spring camp, so the I
Richmond team was rescheduled.
The game Saturday is with the j
San Francisco Police Department,
another late addition to the baseball
slate. The Bay City keepers of law
and order have been working out
all winter, but it was not official
until last week that the department
would field a team this year. When
the announcement was made, the
game was added.
After finals, a busy five - game
schedule is on tap for vacation
week, including a road trip which
will end up at Joe E. Brown Field in
Westwood, and a two-game season
opening series with UCLA.
Pitchers Wild
The Indians have generally i
shown up well in the games played j
to date, but still lack consistency in j
pitching and in hitting. Five Stan- j
f:>rd pitchers have allowed 38 bases j
on balls and 49 hits in 54 innings, i
which isn't good. The team batting j
mark stands at a lowly .230, but a |
yood many of the hits have come j
in the clutch when they've been j
needed.
Expected to toe the slab for Stan- i
ford this afternoon are Jack Heinen, j
the fireball ing right - hander whose i
fast bal! looks like an asperin tab- j
let coming up to the plate, and soph- j
omore southpaw Frank Hamilton.
Heinen Developing
Coach Dean plans to use these two j
today and again on Monday against J
the S.F. Fire Department, leaving i
Jim Claypool and Dave Stott ready
to face the police Saturday.
Coach Everet Dean reported to
the Sunken Diamond for full-time
duty for the first time on Monday,
and with him he brought four in

fielders from the basketball squad.
They are Dick Clcgg, starting first
baseman last year, and sophomores
Harry Hugasian, Bruce Iverson, and
Jim Walsh.
As expected, Dean gave Clegg a
glove with five fingers in it and sent
him out to shag flies in the out
field. But just where Hugasian,
Iverson, and Walsh will try to fit
in remains to be seen.
