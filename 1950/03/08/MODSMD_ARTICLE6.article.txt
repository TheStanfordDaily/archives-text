## 
### 
I'OS ANGKLESâ€” Mickey Cohen
and all the other defendants in the
so-called police hush-up case were
acquitted today by a jury.
It was the second time in recent
weeks that the little gambler, some
times called Los Angeles' under
world boss, has been freed in eourt.
The other was on a charge of dis
turbing the peace by calling police
nasty names.
