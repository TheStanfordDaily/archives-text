# Intramural Cage Finals Begin Tonight at 6:30
## Twenty League Winners Go After University Crown 
### JOHN BREIER 
The chips ate clown, the leagues
are finished, and 20 teams are poised
for the opening round of the In
tramural Basketball Championship
Tourney.
Eight games are carded for to- j
night and thus the field of 20 will
be cut to 12 in the single elimina- j
tion competition. Four games are j
slated for tomorrow, four for Friday, J
two for Monday, and the finals for j
Tuesday.
The bracketing for the finals is i
posted in the Encina Gym.
Twelve teams drew byes in a i
drawing held yesterday. Most of j
these will see action tomorrow. The >
other eight squads will go at it to- J
night. If one of tonight's winners is j
to go all the way to the finals, it |
will have to play five games in five j
days excluding a weekend lay-off. ;

The 20 teams now in the cham
• pionship round are the winners of
the 20 leagues. This year's mural
basketball program drew 115 teams,
an all-time mural high. The play
j has been going on since the first
i week of the quarter.
If favorites can be chosen in such
a single elimination tourney, the
: nod must go to the strong SAE I
| squad. Don Stites, backbone of the
j Dinah's squad that reached the
! finals of the P.A. tourney, Bob San
i guinetti, and Jack Hunter plus some
| other outstanding mural players
I make up the team.
Second choice might fall upon the
Theta Delt I team of Bob Ghilotti,
Bob Anderson, Bill Roney, and Bob
Griflen. They downed a powerful
Beta 1 team to win their league.
Strangely enough, both the Theta
Delts and SAE's drew byes for first
round action.
These two teams are in opposite

halves of the bracket and thus
might well meet in Tuesday's final
match.
The bottom half of the bracket
seems to contain the next in line
for favorite nomination. The Theta
Delts must vie with three teams
that would rate seeded positions if
the tourney were so run.
The Zete 11, the Delt I and the
Daily Headliner teams might well
rate the numbers three, four, and
five seeded positions.
But the teams are not seeded and
the tourney is thrown wide open for
upsets in early play.
The Daily Headliners, for in
stance, could well fall to Phi Delta
Phi, the law fraternity, in tonight's
opening clash in the Pavilion.
The Zete ll's follow at 7:30 against
a fair Roble Hasher outfit that could
cause trouble. The SAE's fill in to
night also, though their game is ac
tually second - round play, against
another team that drew a bye—the
Phi Delt 111 team. They meet at
8:30.
Tom Glikbarg sparks a Stein 5
team that must meet one of the
two teams that Kappa Sigma has
placed in the finals. Tip-ofT is slated
for 9:30.
