"From womb to tomb" is the way
Dr. William W. Greulieh, Stanford
professor of anatomy, paraphrased
his Tuesday Evening Series lecture
"On Growing Up and Growing Old"
last night at Mem Aud.
Passing deliberately from a facts
and-figures discussion of the pre
-1 natal and post-natal anatomical dc
-1 velopment. of the human infant to
i a thought - provoking psychological
discussion on the older members of
j the race, Dr. Greulieh explained
later:
"I thought they (the audience)
would more enjoy such an ap
proach."
Beginning with a rapid dissemi
nation of statistics on comparative
growth before and after birth (a
newborn infant increases in weight
an estimated six and one-half mil
lion times during gestation, while
undergoing an increase of barely
twcntyfold from birth to maturity),
the speaker ended with a rendition
I of two poems written by two men
| describing their reactions to the
I prospect of approaching old age.
The first was expressive of a
| "cynical and hopeless mood," whil"
I the second was more optimistic and
i indicative of a personality which
i "would have had little difficulty in
i adjusting to the limitations that it
I (old age) placed on his activi-
I ties . . ."
( Dr. Greulieh said lie fell that a
person's education and background
j have much to do willi his adjust
I mcnt to the approaching prospect of
; senescence and death.
Specifically, the speaker recoin
j mended educational programs "de-
I signed to help people in their late
forties or (ifties begin to prepare
I themselves for their eventual ie
| firemen t."
He said lie thought there might
j be some link-up between a per-
I son's internal or anatomical makeup
and the psychological attitude with
j which he accepts such programs.
