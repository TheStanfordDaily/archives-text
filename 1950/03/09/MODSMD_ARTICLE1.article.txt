TAIPEI, March 9 (/I'l—Chinese
Communists have invaded Weichow,
a small but strategically important
island off China's south coast, the
Nationalists said today.
Weichow, a naval and military
base, was a serious obstacle to Red
plans for a Hainan invasion. From
it the Nationalist navy could keep
close watch on a large stretch of the
South China coast.
China's Nationalists today claimed
the biggest success on the mainland
since Formosa became the symbol of
resistance last December—the cap
ture of Sinkiang province's capital,
Kangting.
An official dispatch said the far
western city was wrested from turn
coat Nationalists March 5. Remnant
Nationalist troops, left behind when
organized resistance ceased on the
mainland, seized the city.
