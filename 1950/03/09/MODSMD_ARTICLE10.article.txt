# Stanford Observes 59th Anniversary
## University Founders Were Vexed By Many Troubles, Earthquake 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Fifty - nine years ago Stanford
held its first Founder's Day celebra
tion in honor of the opening of the
University.
The first observance, in 1891, was
held on May 14 to commemorate Ice
land Stanford Junior's birthday,
which for many years was cele
brated as Founder's Day.
Later the celebration was changed
to March 9 in honor of the Senator's
birthday, and in 1901 "Founder's
Day" was changed to "Founders' !
Day" to honor all three Stanfords.
The founding of the University I
had been a difficult undertaking, !
since it was opposed by many in
fluential men on Ihe grounds that J
California already had too many j
universities and couldn't afford to j
support a private institution. Rut
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were
persistent.
Financial Troubles
There were also financial troubles i
in the first years of the University's
existence, when Stanford was often
in peril of being closed. Mrs. Stan
ford, after the death of her husband,
struggled with only the aid of her !
brother to keep the University open. :
The University had survived the !
panic of 1893 and a government suit !
for $15,000,000, but it did not fare
so we'l in the earthquake of 190f>. A
huge arch, dominating the entrance j
to the Quad; two giant brownstone
pillars at the end of Palm Drive; a
statue of the Stanfords where the
fountain now stands in Memorial
Court; and other landmarks were
destroyed in 47 seconds by the
earthquake.
Senator Stanford had chosen as

the site for the University a mag- |
nifiecnt Palo Alto farm, famed fori
♦he finest horses in the world. He
wanted the building to have a Cal •
ifornia motif, so they were modeled
after the old San Juan Capistrano
Mission founded near San Diego by
Father Junipcro Serra. Hob; on
Richards, one of the foremost ar
chitects, was chosen to do the work.
At the Senator's request, the
streets were named after the padres
who had led the missionaries in Cal
ifornia.
The Senator wanted Stanford to
give an education directed toward a
practical end, and he also desired
that the traditions of the University
shou'd be its own and no one else's.
Basic Ideals
The ideals on which Stanford was j
established were the embodiment of
the wishes of Mrs. Stanford. She
saw the need for a university where
education would be available to all
a university which recognized no
racial, social, or religious lines, and
a university which would and could
give an equal education to aspiring
students with little or no money.
One of her proposals which was
never realized, since it was left to
the decision of the Board of Trus
tees, was to establish a separate
girls' college adjacent to Stanford
itself. (Mrs. Stanford doubted the
advisability of coeducation.)
One of the chief features of I
Founders' Day has been a concert I
of sacred music. During the first j
years music was provided by the
University and local talent. But
during th" '20's a performance by
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra became the usual thing.
In addition to addresses by Stan- j
ford leaders and concert programs, ,
it has been the custom for the sen- I
ior class to take a special part in j
the program. Seniors have reserved j
seats in Memorial Church, where |
the concert is held. The president
and vice - president of the ASSU j
place a wreath on the altar during
the service.

give an equal education to aspiring
students with little or no money.
One of her proposals which was
never realized, since it was left to
the decision of the Board of Trus
tees, was to establish a separate
girls' college adjacent to Stanford
itself. (Mrs. Stanford doubted the
advisability of coeducation.)
One of the chief features of I
Founders' Day has been a concert I
of sacred music. During the first j
years music was provided by the
University and local talent. But
during th" '20's a performance by
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra became the usual thing.
In addition to addresses by Stan- j
ford leaders and concert programs, ,
it has been the custom for the sen- I
ior class to take a special part in j
the program. Seniors have reserved j
seats in Memorial Church, where |
the concert is held. The president
and vice - president of the ASSU j
place a wreath on the altar during
the service.
Fifty - nine years ago Stanford
held its first Founder's Day celebra
tion in honor of the opening of the
University.
The first observance, in 1891, was
held on May 14 to commemorate Ice
land Stanford Junior's birthday,
which for many years was cele
brated as Founder's Day.
Later the celebration was changed
to March 9 in honor of the Senator's
birthday, and in 1901 "Founder's
Day" was changed to "Founders' !
Day" to honor all three Stanfords.
The founding of the University I
had been a difficult undertaking, !
since it was opposed by many in
fluential men on Ihe grounds that J
California already had too many j
universities and couldn't afford to j
support a private institution. Rut
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were
persistent.
Financial Troubles
There were also financial troubles i
in the first years of the University's
existence, when Stanford was often
in peril of being closed. Mrs. Stan
ford, after the death of her husband,
struggled with only the aid of her !
brother to keep the University open. :
The University had survived the !
panic of 1893 and a government suit !
for $15,000,000, but it did not fare
so we'l in the earthquake of 190f>. A
huge arch, dominating the entrance j
to the Quad; two giant brownstone
pillars at the end of Palm Drive; a
statue of the Stanfords where the
fountain now stands in Memorial
Court; and other landmarks were
destroyed in 47 seconds by the
earthquake.
Senator Stanford had chosen as

the site for the University a mag- |
nifiecnt Palo Alto farm, famed fori
♦he finest horses in the world. He
wanted the building to have a Cal •
ifornia motif, so they were modeled
after the old San Juan Capistrano
Mission founded near San Diego by
Father Junipcro Serra. Hob; on
Richards, one of the foremost ar
chitects, was chosen to do the work.
At the Senator's request, the
streets were named after the padres
who had led the missionaries in Cal
ifornia.
The Senator wanted Stanford to
give an education directed toward a
practical end, and he also desired
that the traditions of the University
shou'd be its own and no one else's.
Basic Ideals
The ideals on which Stanford was j
established were the embodiment of
the wishes of Mrs. Stanford. She
saw the need for a university where
education would be available to all
a university which recognized no
racial, social, or religious lines, and
a university which would and could
give an equal education to aspiring
students with little or no money.
