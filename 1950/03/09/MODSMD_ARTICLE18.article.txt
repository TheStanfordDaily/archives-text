# 'Yankee' Will Open Tonight
## 
### 
The days and knights of King Ar
thur will hold sway in Memorial Hall
tonight at 8:15 when "Connecticut
Yankee" opens for the first of three
performances.
George Denny, as the Yankee, will
play the leading role in the Stanford
Players' production of the Rodgers
and Hart musical comedy. Denny, a
sophomore, took part in Gaieties last
fall.
Winifred Ainsworth plays Alice,
the girl the Yankee wants to marry.
Carol Eller is Fay, his fiance, whom
he doesn't want to marry.
This will be Miss Ainsworth's first
leading role, although she has sung
in the choruses of operas presented
at Stanford. Miss Eller, a member of
Orchesis, has done solo numbers in
Gaieties and the Spring Show.
Merlin, the whizzard of King Ar
thur's court, will be played by Ray
Hammett. Hammett, a Stanford
coach, has sung in previous operas.
The role of Sir Galahad will be
portrayed by Van Kussrow. Jane
Troxell plays Evelyn, who challenges
Galahad's purity. King Arthur is
portrayed by Jack Taylor.
The entire production is under the
direction of F. Cowles Strickland.
Although the play is based on a
book by Herbert Fields, adapted from
a novel by Mark Twain, much of the
burlesque of roundtable manners is
taken directly from Twain's work.
Songs, such as "Thou Swell" and
"My Heart Stood Still," are featured
in the musical score of the comedy.
The orchestra is under the direc
tion of Henry Holt.
