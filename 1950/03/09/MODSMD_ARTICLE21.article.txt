# 'White Australia' Race Policy Condemned
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Australia has drawn a great deal
of animosity toward herself from
Far Eastern countries in tlie last few
years. This animosity, which eame
mainly from the Philippines and
Malaya, was caused by Australia's
bad handling of the White Australia
Policy.
At the outbreak of tlie war, many
Asiatics entered Australia as war
evacuees. Many of them started
businesses, while others married
Australians, When the war ended,
the Australian Immigration Depart
ment forced all such Asiatics to
leave Australia, and in many cases
separated them from their families.
When first formulated, the White

Australia Policy was nothing nmie
than an economic policy designed to
keep cheap labor out of Australia
In the early part of the nineteenth
century, cheap labor for the cotton
plantations in New South Wales and
the sugar plantations in Queensland
was in great demand.
As a result, unscrupulous sea cap
tains kidnapped Kanakas from the
islands in the Pacific for work on the
plantation;. Although the Kanakas
were supposed to be "hired," they
were virtually slaves, for they re
ceived nothing more than mere tri
fles such as tobacco, pipes, beads,
and cloth for their years of labor.
Finally, when federation came in
lilO 1, the Australian government

enunciated the White An .tra'ia P«»1
icy Bather than lower the standard
of living by the importation of cheap
labor, the Australian government
refused to allow foreign .sugar and
cotton to compete with the local
products, and at the same time al
lowed plantci > to charge higher
prices fni sugar and cotton,
But because of their experiences
with colored people in the planta
tion:; ,"iitl later in the gold fields,
Au. tralian.s began to associate peo
ple til Asiatic or African origin with
everything cheap and lowly. Asiat
ics were loathed as harbingers of
degrading pagan morality and alien
competitors for the bread of Aus
tralians. Australia's isolation also
contributed toward the intolerance

to color.
As proof of the desirability of
having ;i "wbi»e" Australia, Aus
tra'ians pointed toward the prob
lems in South Africa and the Unit
ed States. They declared that the
Australian aborigines were of no
consequence because they were rap
idly dying out. However, recent
surveys show that the aborigines
are actually increasing in number.
The introduction of a quota sys
tem has been under consideration
for some time, but as yet the aver
age Australian is still violently op
posed to such a step. Kven Dr. Clu
nies Ross's recent suggestion at Mel
bourne University to admit an Asi
atic quota of one per cent of Aus
tralia's natural increase met with

stiff opposition. II would ho politi
cal suicide for any party to advocate
the introduction of a quota system
at present.
As an economic policy, the White
Australia Policy is sound, but as
anything more than that, a great
deal of re-thinking on the subject is
necessary. More and more Austra
lians are now beginning to feel that
they have no objections to a limited
number of colored people settling in
Australia, providing the standards
of living and education of the col
ored people are comparable with
theirs. However, it will probably be
quite a number of years before pub
lic opinion is changed enough to
cause any alteration in the present
situation.

As an economic policy, the White
Australia Policy is sound, but as
anything more than that, a great

necessary. More and more Austra

Australia has drawn a great deal
of animosity toward herself from
Far Eastern countries in tlie last few
years. This animosity, which eame

bad handling of the White Australia

At the outbreak of tlie war, many
Asiatics entered Australia as war
evacuees. Many of them started
businesses, while others married
Australians, When the war ended,
the Australian Immigration Depart

leave Australia, and in many cases
separated them from their families.
When first formulated, the White

Australia Policy was nothing nmie
than an economic policy designed to
keep cheap labor out of Australia
In the early part of the nineteenth
century, cheap labor for the cotton
plantations in New South Wales and
the sugar plantations in Queensland
was in great demand.
As a result, unscrupulous sea cap
tains kidnapped Kanakas from the
islands in the Pacific for work on the
plantation;. Although the Kanakas
were supposed to be "hired," they
were virtually slaves, for they re
ceived nothing more than mere tri
fles such as tobacco, pipes, beads,
and cloth for their years of labor.
Finally, when federation came in
lilO 1, the Australian government

enunciated the White An .tra'ia P«»1
icy Bather than lower the standard
of living by the importation of cheap
labor, the Australian government
refused to allow foreign .sugar and
cotton to compete with the local
products, and at the same time al

with colored people in the planta
