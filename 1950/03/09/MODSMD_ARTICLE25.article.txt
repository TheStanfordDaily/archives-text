# Change in Sponsor System
## 
### 
There is a proposal now under consideration
which would reverse the number ol quarters
which juniors and seniors sponsor at ftoble.
That is, juniors would stay two quarters in
stead of one, and seniors would only put in
one quarter.
We think this change is advisable for sev
t j.tl reasons.
first, the lack of qualified senior applicants
has been noticeable in the past. This is prob
ably due to the fact that by the time a woman
is a senior, if she is interested in campus ac
tivities, she will probably have too much re-
to take on the added job of spon
soring for two quarters. It is assumed that the
. ctivities-type of woman is the one who would
make the best sponsor.
Secondly, senior women are reluctant to
leave their living groups for the better part of
their last year. It is also true that seniors who
wish to draw to a new residence hesitate to
do so for one quarter.

On the part of the juniors, there is a possi
bility thot women really interested in sponsor
ing, instead of those who think of the jobs only
in teims of possible Cap and Gown member
ship or a a stepping stone to elective offices,
might be attracted.
We don't think it's too much of an imposi
tion on the juniors to ask them to stay two
quarters at Hoble if they are at all interested
in sponsoring. Furthermore, as social chair
men, they are probably closer to the freshmen
and are more valuable for two quarters.
In conclusion, it seems as though this re
vision in sponsoring is a good one. We feel
that it is a step toward getting the "best"
women on campus into a job that certainly
should be leserved for only the top student
leaders.
After all. it is through sponsors that most
women first see Stanford, and if they are
poorly influenced at that time, it may affect
their entire Stanford careers.â€”M.K.
