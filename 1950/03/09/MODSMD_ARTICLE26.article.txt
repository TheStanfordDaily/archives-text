## Negroes at Stanford 
### 
To the Editor:
The current letters to the editor concerning the ab
sence of Negroes at Stanford bring to mind the periodic
11. sing of skepticism and inquiry which appear usually
dormant among the students. The absence of Negroes
was well discussed in The Daily in the summer quar
...l of 1547, and the discussion was culminated by some
• tatement of the Administration which seemed to end
the discussion and to leave anyone overy satisfied.
Then, in the spring of 1948, some students decided
they were being denied political freedom on the cam
pus, but this protest was ended by that wonderful
• tudent body election of the spring in which cries
Issued forth for and against the rather rustic method
of campaigning of one of the candidates for president
of that high-type cultural and intellectual group the
Stanford student body.
I think in all of these discussions the dual function
of the Administration is forgotten. That function is t<>
raise mcney for Stanford and further highei learning
at Strr/ord. If one were to hypothesize that higher
learnir. is the process of considering general and spe
i ific problems that confront mankind from the atom
bomb to creditors' rights in bankruptcy; it would seem
to follow that the presence of Negroes and contro
versial speakers among us would stimulate higher
learning. But if one also were to hypothesize that
potential contributors to the Stanford endowment are
;< lather prejudiced and intolerant lot, it would seem

to follow that these Negroes and speakers at Stanford
would tend to increase our endowment.
Therefore, perhaps, in performing its function the
Administration feels that it must walk a tight rope
between two conflicting objectives. 1 do not know if
that is the Administration's view of the matter or not.
If it is, 1 do not feel qualified to criticize either the
validity of the view or the skill the Administration
uses iii walking the tight rope.
