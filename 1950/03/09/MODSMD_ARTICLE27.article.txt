# Game Refuge
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Perhaps letter-writer and humorist Marvin O.
Adams would be interested to know that there are
deer in Stanford's game refuge along with the rabbits,
quail, and numerous other birds, including Great Blue
herons. We j.aw a young doe two weeks ago leap the
fence surrounding the Ryan Lab, cross the road 20
feet in front of us, leap the second fence and disappear
over the hill.
I'd like to see more such beautiful sights without
having to go to the mountains to do so. More power
to the University in its efforts to keep its land closed
to hunters. I personally don't care to have to wear
a red hiking hat into school every day.
