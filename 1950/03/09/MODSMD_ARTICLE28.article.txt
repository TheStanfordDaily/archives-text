I! seems that Oregon State College wants a big
Orange O, or at least some seniors think that would
make a good class gift. The University of Oregon
paper thinks so, too. They would just love to have a
target for their yellow paint. "What type of college
■ pirit is this that refuses to give traditional 'enemies'
.i focal point for painting expeditions? What type of
chool is this OSC that won't have an O? Where is
their old rah rah?" UO wants to know.

A recent editorial in the Columbia Daily Spectator
■ingests that University President Eisenhower teach a
• lass himself. "What better authority could be found
for comments and explanation on recent history?
Perhaps a new title would be in order: Dwight David
Ki-enhower, General-of-the-Armies, President of the
l/niversity, and lecturer in Contemporary Civiliza
tion."
The occasion for all this, by the way, was an item
recording Ike's visit to some Columbia classes.

Corsages lor student functions are an issue at
Michigan State. They have a regulation forbidding
the giving of flowers at all-college affairs, and a stu
dent council member who is also a floriculture major
jrid member of something called Pi Alpha Xi, Na
tional Men's Floriculture and Ornamental Horticul
ture honorary, would like to see that ban lepealed.
He calls the regulation "a slap at the florist industry"
and adds that "Everyone resents being told what to
do and what not to do."
f ihe floriculture group called the ban "discrimina
tory" and proposed to have East Lansing florists give
a2O per cent discount on corsages for students a pro
posal that they afterward discarded howevei

Where else but at Harvard would the campus news
paper review courses for the brnelit of the men in
search of "the Fourth Course, the Fifth Course, or
perhaps a whole new slate?"
The Crimson's Classgoer review.-, nine o'clocks "for
• arly shoppers," lists classes "ideal foi auditors," and
throws in comments like "the course is popular, but
he does not go in very deep," and"the course has
never been known for abnormal difficulty,"

When an old green Chevrolet was grounded on a
mudbank at the entrance of the University of Wash
ington Student Union, it was dubbed the "Big Mole,"
and the epic of how the stricken vehicle was wrenched
free was worthy of the "Big Mo" itself. "Adverse
weather conditions obscured the road bed" when the
Big Mole's skipper burrowed his craft into the ooze,
and a power wrecker finally hoisted the sedan free
"at 4:43, 20 hours after she ran asea."

In an annual exchange, the staffs of the University
of Washington Daily and the University of British
Columbia Übyssey trade places and edit each other's
papers for a day. They seize the opportunity to throw
compliments and insults at the other university and
leers at its women- the Washington boys even spent
an afternoon looking at BC coeds' knees, ostensibly to
if L'il Abner's dream knee was to bt- found there.
(All they found was that the coeds had legs.)
One of the Washington sportswriters also attended
one of the Stanford-ÜBC rugby games in the middle
of last February, and was very much confused. Stan
lord didn't win!
The Husky couldn't understand what had become of
Stanford blocking and the T formation. Somebody
finally put him wise about how rugby is played, but
he still wrote amazedly, "In American football, they
just don't treat the Stanford Indians that way." That
40 to 0 score* ivally made an impression. .

Some reasons to be grateful lor California weather
The coal strike hit Michigan State College hard.
The adminsitration cancelled all evening events re
quiring the use of electricity and heat: plays were
postponed, a track meet was moved to another col
lege, and all evening classes were moved to one build
ing where the temperature would be kept up.
And temperatures everywhere except in the Union
and tht dorms were to be reduced to the "lowest pos
sible level above freezing" nights and weekends. Stu
dents were asked to conserve heat, electricity, and wa
ter as coal stockpiles, as the saying goes, dwindled to
"the most serious situation in memory."
But the administration quickly squelched the ru
mor that classes would be suspended or the term
shortened undoubtedly the unkindest cut of all.
