# Dr. Oppenheim Given British Science Prize
## 
### 
Professor A. K. Oppenheim i>l the I
Mechanical Engineering Department j
has been awarded a prize by the !
Institute of Mechanical Engineers, it !
was announced yesterday.
Notification of the award came in
a letter from Sir Henry Guy, secre- !
tary of the Institute, which is the
British equivalent of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers.
The prize, which included a cash I
award, was shared by Professor Op- \
penheim with Dr. Joseph Kestin, a '
professor at the Polish University in
London.
The two engineers were honored
for a paper they wrote before Pro
fessor Oppenheim joined the Stan
ford faculty in the summer of 1948.
The paper, entitled "The Calculation
ol Compressible Fluid Flow by the
Use of a Generalized Entropy
Chart, introduces a graphical !
method ol solving one-dimensional
gas flow problems.
The prize was presented to Dr. |
Kestin—and to Dr. Oppenheim, in j
absentia—at a recent meeting of tire
Institute in London.
