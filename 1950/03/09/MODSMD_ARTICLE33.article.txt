# Ceramics Artisan-Teacher Initiates Creative Art Instruction at Village
## 
### 
The Greeks used the word "ce
ramics" to mean "potter's earth"; to
Champion Nixon, prominent Penin
sula ceramics teacher and well
known artisan, the word means the
creating of earthen sculpture and
pottery not marred in the making.
Nixon has been teaching the art
of ceramics for several years. He
has classes at Letterman General
Hospital, at his studio in San Fran
cisco, and at San Mateo Junior Col
lege, and is currently initiating a
free ceramics class at Stanford Vil
lage for married Stanford students
and their wives.
Nixon, a Texas-born artist, grad
uated from the University of South
ern California, where he studied
and worked under Dr. Glenn Lu
kens, nationally known potter and
art professor. Three times Nixon
circled the Americas, studying art
and gathering ideas for new teach
ing methods. Today these methods
have earned him acclaim as an out
standing modern teacher of ceram
ics.
His classes are informal and
pleasant, forming an atmosphere
conducive to creative work. Ilis stu
dents find that without textbooks,
learning only by doing, they have
less tendency to imitate and a great
er chance to create t heir-own sytle.

The art of ceramics has been re
developed in the past few years in
the San Francisco area by several
competent ceramists, including Nix
on. They have worked steadily to

bridge the gulf between "art" and
industrial ceramics, to show the
public that contemporary craft
products have an important place in
modern society.


CHAMPION NIXON, nationally-known potter, is currently of
fering a free ceramics course for married Stanford students at
the Village.
