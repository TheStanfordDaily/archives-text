# Indian Diamonders Drop 10 to 8 Game
## 
### 
Two late-inning rallies fell short yesterday afternoon in the
Sunken Diamond as Stanford's baseball squad dropped a 10 to 8
decision to the Richmond Club. The Cards failed to look up to
their performances of last week, as the outfielders had trouble
getting hold of the ball and the pitchers ran into difficulties

♦getting three men out in several in
nings.
Basketballers Jim Walsh and Bruce
Iversen made their first appearance
in baseball uniforms. Walsh banged
out a single in his lone time at bat.
Cager Dick Clegg, who made his
first showing last Thursday by
punching out a pinch hit single, took
over right field yesterday and col
j lected two safeties in four times at
| bat.
The Indians drew first blood in
what started out to be a tight pitch
ers' duel between Jack Heinen of
the Cards and John Lopeman of the
Richmond Club. Stanford picked up
its first counter in the first stanza
when Klein singled infield and Co
| captain Charlie Cole sent him home
1 with a double into left centerfield.
Heinen in Trouble
Heinen looked great for three in
nings, striking out five of the 10 men
to face him. However, in the fourth
j frame the Clubmen combined five
i base hits with a Card error to push
i over four runs.
Frank Hamilton, who went in to
relieve Heinen in the filth frame,
' could get only one of the seven men
to face him out. The Clubmen
punched across four more runs be
fore Dave Stott went in to put out
the fire.
Stott ran into more trouble in the
sixth as the opposing batsmen put to
gether four consecutive base hits lor
two more runs. Stott then settled
down and didn't allow a man past
second base in the last three innings.
Eighth Frame Kally
The Indians, on the other hand,
couldn't get an attack going until the
eighth frame, when Pros Boutte. who
had relieved Lopeman in the fifth ran
| into trouble. Stanford put together
three hits, a base on balls and two
errors for three runs to cut the gap
! to 10 to 4.
With the reserves manning the
; lineup, the Cards picked up four more
: runs on Walsh's single, Tuny Stellar's
i long double to left field and three
straight bases on balls given up by
Boutte. However, Bill Herron and
Stott sent long flics to the outfield
to end the rally.
This afternoon the Braves will be
out to turn the tables on San Mateo
JC at 3:15 in the Sunken Diamond.
