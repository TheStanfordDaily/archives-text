## Frosh Netters Down Bulldogs

The Papoose netters easily
dumped the San Jose High Bull
dogs, 9-0, yesterday afternoon. It
was the season opener for the pow
erful frosh.
Playing without their nationally
ranked stars, Charlie Hickox and
Bob Sibert, the Papooses showed
good depth as the rest of the ranked
players all scored convincing victo
ries over the preppers.
Skip Irving smothered number
one Boyd Faulk, 6-1, 6-2. Ed Hen
derson, who usually holds down the
fourth slot, had an even easier time
with Ernie George. Ed poured it on
for 6-0, 6-0 whitewashing.
Other singles wins were racked up
by Howie Willens, 6-0, 6-0; Jim
Andreas, 6-0, 6-1; Don Bernard, 6-0,
6-0; and Roy Alexander, 6-1, 6-3.
Doubles matches, all victories for
the Cardbabes, were: Irving-Hen
derson, 6-3, 6-0; Bernard-Willens.
6-0, 6-0; and Andreas-Alexander,
6-2, 6-1.
With this initial win under his
belt, Coach Elwyn Bugge has even
more to smile about after his varsity
.squad dumped Santa Clara, 9-0.
Both frosh and varsity see action
this Saturday.
Against the Broncs, the Cards did
not lose a set, and won every match
with ease except the number two
