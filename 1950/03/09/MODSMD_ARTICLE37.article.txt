# Mermen to Meet Olympic Clubbers
## 
### 
In quest of their third straight j
win in as many dual meets, Tom
Haynie's mermen travel to San ;
Francisco tonight to engage Hal
Keller's Olympic Clubbers.
The Winged "O" cannot boast the ;
equal of Stanford's depth or all- '
around strength, but Keller is so j
high oh his prep star, Jim Lee, that 1
he predicts a double win for the J
Lowell youth. He has wagered Card i
frosh mentor Ed Rudloff a sizable !
sum that Lee will trounce either
Pete Cole or Ralph Sala, or both, in (
the 220 ahd 440.
Lee recently beat Cole in the |
Call-Bulletin furlong and will have
to be at his very best to dunk the
revengeful Card sensation again.
Either Cole or Sala, if the veteran
Indian makes scholastic amends in
time, appears to be too much for the
prepster in the quarter.
Bob Anderson, ex-Stanford NC
AA 50 and 100 titlist, will be on
hand to do battle with the best o!'
Haynie's sprint corps led by Bruce
Putnam. Putnam was clocked at
52.4 for the century last Thursday
when Bob Frojen, Chuck Kelly, and j
Dave Chapman also hit 54.0 or bet
ter.
The 150 backstroke may also be
hotly contested as Captain Jack j
Weeden meets a worthy opponent in
Keith Brueekner, ex - Minnesota
star. Both Weeden and Brueckrter j
swim their specialty in 1:38 when
right.
