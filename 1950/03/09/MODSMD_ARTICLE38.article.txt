## V 308 Nips Alpha Sigs 
### 
In one of the scrappiest basketball
battles of the season, Village 308 out- ]
classed the tough eagers from Alpha
Sigma Phi, 33 to 31. Two seconds
into the first half, 308er Tony Nichol
son drove in for two points. To
maintain the tempo teammate Bill
Hughes blindly meshed an off-bal
anced hook. The Alpho Sigs shot fre
quently throughout the first half, but
they had a tough time finding the
basket. The 308 defense was too
tough to be broken.
Bob Case, fighting on both boards
and shooting with deadeye accuracy,
served as the backbone for the Alpha
Sigs. However, he was checked
closely by the 308ers' "mighty mite,"
Don Stibich, who played a great de
fensive game. The Alpha Sigs slowed
down their offense to experiment
with some fancy shooting. Capital
izing, the 308ers pulled ahead for a
13 to 12 halftime lead, aided by the
foul shooting of Clarence Snook.
Both teams caught fire in the sec
ond half. 308ers Bill Hughes and
Clarence Snook looked very profes
sional in their hook-shots, lay-ins,
and backboard control. Yet. doubling
the pace caused a streak of fouling
112 rom the determined teams.
Outstanding player of the evening
was Tony Nicholson, who never
missed from 30 feet out. Syl Kline
and Don Minard, also from 308,
showed excellent basketball form.
As the time ran short, Rowland Reb
ele and Bob Frederickson struggled
to keep the Alpha Sigs in the fray.
The audience was wild when the Al
pha Sigs started to pull up with one
minute to go. But Village 308 held
and won the game by two points,
33 to 31.
