# 'Woman's Domination of Man' Is Topic of Scotch Debate Here
## 
### 
Do women dominate men?
This question—which would
start an argument in most
homes — will be debated next
Wednesday when two experi
enced Stanford debaters, one a
coed, will discuss the question
with a touring Scottish team.
The question will be: "Resolved,
1 That the increasing domination of
man by woman is deplorable."
The touring Scotiish debaters,
j traveling under the auspices of the
Institute of International Education,
will be paired with the Stanford stu
; dents in the debate 7:30 p.m. in Me
morial Auditorium.
Joan Witzman will take the nega
j tive view for Stanford. Her team
mate will be Malcolm David Web
j ster-Low, University of Edinburgh
j medical student and a veteran who
' served with the rank of captain in
the famed Black Watch Royal High
land Regiment,
They will be opposed by Townsend
i Brown, captain of the Stanford de
j bate squad, and David D. T. Reid of
} the University of Glasgow, who
j served overseas as an intelligence of
j ficer in the British Army.
Miss Witzman, 21-year-old senior,
who came to Stanford from Welles
ley, took first place in the impromptu
speaking division at the Western
j Speech Association tournament here
last fall.
Brown, with Dow Carpenter, won
the Rocky Mountain debate tourna
-5 ment in 1948. The same year he re
ceived the MellinkofT Award for ex
cellence in extemporaneous speaking.
In staging the debate during dead
week Stanford waived the traditional
i rule barring activities during the
week before finals. In anticipation ot
a large crowd, the locale was shilted
1 from Cubberley Auditorium to Me
morial Hall.
The Stanford students are being
trained for the debate by Debate
Coach James Gordon Emerson.
