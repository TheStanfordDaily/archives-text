# Birds Drop In On Palo Alto, Citizens Wary
## 
### 
Even the pigeons are leaving the
Stanford game preserve now that
the state has decided to open it to
hunters, as of next August 7.
Flocks of San Francisco Mayor
Elmer Robinson's little pot peeves
have descended on homes in North
Palo Alto and are causing more
concern than the H - bomb. The
pigeons were deported from San
Francisco to Stanford's green acres
following Mayor Robinson's drive to
clean up the civic center.
Despite the doubts of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (and pigeons), the North
Palo Altans claim' the birds are a
San Francisco breed, with San
Francisco habits.
Colonel Henry Edmonds, chair
man of the San Mateo Board of Su
pervisors, has declared open war
fare on the marauders after hearing
the citizen protests. Meanwhile,
there were rumors running around
the Stanford reserve that rattle
snakes, now subject to hunters' bul
lets, are planning to migrate next.
