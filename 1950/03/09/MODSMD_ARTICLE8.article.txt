# Excom OK's King-Queen Proposition
## Downing McKee's Con Home Drive Plan Goes to AWS 
### 
Excom clearcd the way last
night for a King and Queen of
the Convalescent Home Week.
The king and queen proposal
passed by a vote of 8 to 5 after
Excom weighed tho charity value of
electing student royalty against the
chance of the program growing out
0.l hand as it did in previous years.
Downing McKee, this year's
Con Home Drive chairman, received
permission to have the final word on
the plan after lie presented it to
Excom. McKee said he would take
the proposal to AWS today for their
approval.
McKeo will be responsible for
developing the plans for electing the
royalty. He told the executive com
mittee that tlie proposal called for
student selection of the king and
queen by ballots, purchased for a
penny apiece. This was the method
of selection used during the last
king - queen contest in 1936, when
the proceeds amounted to $2,055.
Previous Objections
Because of objections to the
methods of campaigning used in the
contests, the selection of a king and
queen was discontinued after 19.'!(i.
McKee said that he had consulted
the deans on the plan and had re
ceived word from them that the de
cision would be up to the students.
He then asked for the right to call
the whole thing off if trouble de
veloped, even though he received
the approval of Excom and the
AWS.
The original motion was amended
to prohibit the selection of any other
king and queen on campus besides
the Con Home royalty. Excom's ap
proval was for this year.
The Con Home Drive king and
queen will probably reign at a
masked ball, according to McKee.
Orientation Program
Excom also passed a by - law
which requires newly eelcted ASSU
presidents, vice-presidents, and rep
resentatives to attend orientation
sessions before taking office.
Public a t i on s by - laws were
amended to reduce the Daily edi
tor's salary from $65 a month to $60.
and raise the managing editor's sal
ary from $.'lO to 40. The amendments
also clear up technical points in
Daily elections for editor.
A ruling was passed limiting the
use of public address systems on
campus to class breaks between 8
a.m. and 6 p.m. In addition, mobile
units may broadcast away from the
class area between 12 and 12:30 in
the afternoon. Special permission
for broadcasting may be granted on
petition to Excom. Violators will be
referred to the student councils.
The question of 2whcthcr Honor
Code violators may run for the
Council for Student Control will be
referred to the student body for
vote this spring.

Excom clearcd the way last
night for a King and Queen of
the Convalescent Home Week.
The king and queen proposal
passed by a vote of 8 to 5 after
Excom weighed tho charity value of
electing student royalty against the
chance of the program growing out
0.l hand as it did in previous years.
Downing McKee, this year's
Con Home Drive chairman, received
permission to have the final word on
the plan after lie presented it to
Excom. McKee said he would take
the proposal to AWS today for their
approval.
McKeo will be responsible for
developing the plans for electing the
royalty. He told the executive com
mittee that tlie proposal called for
student selection of the king and
queen by ballots, purchased for a
penny apiece. This was the method
of selection used during the last
king - queen contest in 1936, when
the proceeds amounted to $2,055.
Previous Objections
Because of objections to the
methods of campaigning used in the
contests, the selection of a king and
queen was discontinued after 19.'!(i.
McKee said that he had consulted
the deans on the plan and had re
ceived word from them that the de
cision would be up to the students.
He then asked for the right to call
the whole thing off if trouble de
veloped, even though he received
the approval of Excom and the
AWS.
The original motion was amended
to prohibit the selection of any other
king and queen on campus besides
the Con Home royalty. Excom's ap
proval was for this year.
The Con Home Drive king and
queen will probably reign at a
masked ball, according to McKee.
