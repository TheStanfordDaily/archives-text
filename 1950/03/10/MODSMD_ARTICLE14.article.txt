Tarver grant to study graduate psy
chology here. He carefully compared
the two schools and declared, "The

A veteran of live years in the lIAE,
Keehn explained, "They teach you all
kinds of facts at Stanford, much more
than at my college. But they don't

show you how to use them. At IJui

ever the argument warrants it. "Of
course." he added, "I'm judging from
my own experience."
