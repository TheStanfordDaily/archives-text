# Lavish Sets Feature Lusty 'Yank' Comedy
## Denny, Ainsworth, Eller Spark Cast in Satire of Court Manners 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
The Stanford Players romped
J through two and a half hours ol
| lusty and delightful comedy Inst
night as "A Connecticut Yankee"
I took over the singe in Memorial '
] Hall.
Lavish sets and colorful costumes i
I complemented x well - chosen cast. |
j The knights glistened in armor, the
j king's sister sparkled in sequins, \
and a east of 40 - odd members
| danced and sang their way through j
the sure-fire mu'sic of Rodgers and
1 Hart.
The play opens in a Connecticut j
j hotel where Lieut. Martin Barret
j (George Deijny) is brine toasted at
j a bachelor's party before his wed
j dine. When Carol Eller, the Yan
j kee's bride - to - bo, and Winifred
| Ainsworth, his real sweetheart, |
| (Mash the parly, the fighting begin.", j
j and Denny winds up in court j
j King Arthur's court.
Although the first act dragged in
.spots, clever lines and some we : l- ,
executed musical numbers (such a:.
! "Thou Swell," sung hy Denny and
Miss Ainsworth) saved the audience'
i from becoming weary.
Kxoelleiit Performances
Denny and Miss Ainsworth gave
; excellent performances, espcially as
it was the first time that either has |
j had a leading role.
Carol F<!ler and Kay Mammelt i
J were outstanding in their parts as ,
j Morgan Le Fay, the king's schcm- ,
ing sister, and Merlin, the not-so

; good magician.
Miss Filer gave Â» rousing rendi- }
tion of songs such as "Can't You Do
a Friend a Favor?" and "To Keep
JMy Love Alive." She was quite
j convincing both as the tetnperarnen
| tal fiancee and the husband-hunting
I queen.
I The sets and dance routines for I
the factory in Camelot and the!
1 court of Morgan Le Fay received
1 rounds of applause in the middle of
I the second act.
Supporting Holes
Van Kussrow as Sir Galahad,
Jack Taylor as King Arthur, and
| Anne Lawder as Queen Guinevere
I turned in good performances in
: supporting roles.
