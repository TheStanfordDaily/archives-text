J
The Convalescent Homo king- '
queen contest came one step closer
to reality yesterday when the Asso- 1
dated Women Students put their j
stamp of approval on Con Home
Drive chairman Downing McKee's j
money-raising pi oposak
A WS passed on the plan by a vote {
of lf> to II, after defeating a motion
to take the issue hack to the women's
residences for discussion. The de
cision came a:; a surprise to many on
campus who doubted earlier that the
hoard would approve the issue.
McKee said that his next, step 1
would be to get together with a com- j
mittee from AWS and Elva :
Brown, chief counselor of women, lo
draw up plans for the election of a j
king and queen.
The prime purpose for breaking a
]4-year tradition to elect, a king and !
qileen is to raise additional money for j
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
McKec'.s proposal is similar lo the
method last used in 1936. when the
royalty were elected with ballots
purchased at a penny apiece.
Queen Is Issue
Basically, the nr-un issue today lies 1
I in the selection of a queen. Queen r
i contests were dropped after 193(5 be
came of the expensive way the cam- !
paigtv; were run. That, year, one j
candidate's campaign costs ran over i
$200, skywriting was resorted to for j
publicity.
In 1946, the women students passed j
a resolution banning open queen con- j
j tests on campus and forbidding any!
| publicity or compaigning for any ;
| contest.
IVTcKce presented both sides of the !
i question before AWS yesterday
j afternoon with arguments similar to
those heard by Excom Wednesday
j night. Excom approved the proposal, j
! 8 to 5, and gave McKee permission j
to cancel the plans if he saw fit.
Arguments for the sponsoring of a |
i queen contest pointed out that it
| would be an excellent source of in
j come for the Con Home Drive and
i would help to unite the school fur-
I ther in., the driv^.,.effort, McKee
; pointed out that in 1936 more than
$2,000 went to the drive after the
contest.
Arguments
Arguments against the selection of 1
i a queen stressed the hard feeling it |
j might breed among the women, plus |
! the fact that one contest might start j
J a bad precedent.
McKee said that he believed that
i the present system of women's hous
| ing would tend to modify the violent
| feeling which arose in past elections
J when there were sororities on cam
pus.
Accompanying Excom's approval j
Wednesday night was a motion that i
| no other contests were to be held.
, AWS hacked up this decision yes- ;
j terday.
Before going to Excom. McKee oh- !
tained the approval of Cardinals and
the qualified approval of Miss Brown j
and Dean Lawrence Kimpton who,
he said, were "cool' 1 toward the plan ;
I in view of past incidents, but agreed |
that the final decisions rested with,
! the students.
Fred Ten Eyck, Excom member, j
reported Wednesday night that senior
Excom haH approved the contest plan j
after first taking a skeptical stand.
Diane Porter, president of AWS.
said that the women's reactions had
been just the opposite.
