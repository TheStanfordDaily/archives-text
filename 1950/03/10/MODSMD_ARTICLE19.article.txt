MANCHESTER. N.H., March 9 (IP) f
â€” Dr. Hermann N. Sander was found
innocent in 71 minutes today of
charges he murdered a hopeless can
cer patient in an "act of mercy' 1 Lo
end her suffering.
A 12-man jury freed the mild
mannered country doctor who told
newsmen he hopes to resume his
practice "within a few weeks."
Attorney General William L j
Phinney, 40, the chief prosecutor and
long-time friend of Dr. Sander,
quietly left the courtroom after the j
verdict was announced.
Earlier, he had frankly admitted to
the jury it was "particularly difficult" |
for him to ask conviction of the doctor I
he has known since boyhood.
But he had demanded justice on '
the grounds Dr. Sander had "taken j
the law into his own hands" when he
injccted air into Mio. Abbie Borroto,
59, Manchester housewife.
Dr. Sander had maintained '
throughout that the 59-year-old i
woman, a family friend as well as
patient, was already dead before he j
made the injections after "something
snapped" in his mind.
Biit Dr. Sander's acquittal does 1
not necessarily mean the end of his j
troubles.
The House of Delegates of the New !
Hampshire Medical Society is ex- !
pected to hold an emergency meet- ;
ing within 24 hours to consider the
historic case. Dr. John P. Bowler,
president of the state society, said ex
pulsion of a doctor was within the (
power of the society.
Dr. John S. Wheeler, state health
officer and clerk of the state board j
of registration in medicine, explained
that, the medical society was "a pro- j
fessional society" and declared "it hat. j
no legal power."
