# Learning Human Relations Stressed in Sterling Talk
## 1000 Attend Memorial Church Service In Observance of 59th Founders' Day 
### WALLY WHITE 
Education's greatest opportunity now resides in refining knowl
edge about human relations, and in disseminating that knowl
edge, Dr. Wallace Sterling, Stanford president, said in Founders'
Day ceremonies yesterday.
The response to this opportunity lies not only in further inves-

►ligation and improved teaching, but
also in "a fresh emphasis cn the
training of minds as distinct from the
accumulation of knowledge," he de
clared.
Clad in a black and red academic
robe, Dr. Sterling spoke from the
pulpit of Memorial Church at 10 a.m.
to an estimated 1,000 members of the
student body, faculty, and Univer
, sity stafT.

The bells of Hoover Tower's caril
lon, played by Ray Sanders, rang
into the cloudy sky as the congrega
tion entered the chapel. It was Stan
ford's 59 th annual obsevance of
Founders' Day, honoring Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford, who foundod
the University in 1885, and their son,
Leland Jr.
"If education connotes anything,"
said Dr. Sterling, "it connotes oppor
tunity. And opportunity is barren
unless it produces response."
The president quoted a statement
by Leland Stanford, spoken in cere
j monies founding the University.
Stanford had said "all that we can
do for you is to place the oppor
tunities within your reach; it rests
with you to grasp and improve them."
Dr. Sterling said "I would that
sentence could fasten itself to the
minds and hearts of all of us."
Pi 'ogress Traced
The president traced the progrera
of general education since Stanford's
i founding. Science and technology
have greatly affected our society, he
recalled. They have created methods
; characterized by exactness. "More
and more frequently we asked: Does
the thing work? Not, is it intrinsic
' ally good or beautiful?"
These trends carried into educa
tion, he said. . a student's edu
cation was too readily thought of as
accumulation of knowledge mea
sured in units." However, there has
recently keen a reaction against these
trends—more support of education as
equipment for life.
. The mind trained to analy
-1 sis and careful evaluation," he re
minded, "is better armed against;
prejudice than is the mind heavy
with information ..." A fresh
emphasis on the training of mind
places heavy responsibility on stu -
dents and instructors, he said.

Carillon Rings
The bells of Hoover Tower's caril
lon, played by Ray Sanders, rang
into the cloudy sky as the congrega
tion entered the chapel. It was Stan
ford's 59 th annual obsevance of
Founders' Day, honoring Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford, who foundod
the University in 1885, and their son,
Leland Jr.
"If education connotes anything,"
said Dr. Sterling, "it connotes oppor
tunity. And opportunity is barren
unless it produces response."
The president quoted a statement
by Leland Stanford, spoken in cere
j monies founding the University.
Stanford had said "all that we can
do for you is to place the oppor
tunities within your reach; it rests
with you to grasp and improve them."
Dr. Sterling said "I would that
sentence could fasten itself to the
minds and hearts of all of us."
Pi 'ogress Traced
The president traced the progrera
of general education since Stanford's
i founding. Science and technology
have greatly affected our society, he
recalled. They have created methods
; characterized by exactness. "More
and more frequently we asked: Does
the thing work? Not, is it intrinsic
' ally good or beautiful?"
These trends carried into educa
tion, he said. . a student's edu
cation was too readily thought of as
accumulation of knowledge mea
sured in units." However, there has
recently keen a reaction against these
trends—more support of education as
equipment for life.
. The mind trained to analy
-1 sis and careful evaluation," he re
minded, "is better armed against;
prejudice than is the mind heavy
with information ..." A fresh
emphasis on the training of mind
places heavy responsibility on stu -
dents and instructors, he said.

Education's greatest opportunity now resides in refining knowl
edge about human relations, and in disseminating that knowl
edge, Dr. Wallace Sterling, Stanford president, said in Founders'
Day ceremonies yesterday.
The response to this opportunity lies not only in further inves-

►ligation and improved teaching, but
also in "a fresh emphasis cn the
training of minds as distinct from the
accumulation of knowledge," he de
clared.
