# An Unpleasant Incident
## 
### 
Yesterday the 59tli founders' 1)oy o-lebra
!,• ,ii was held on out campus. The observance
of this annual event honoring tin; founders
< 112 Stanford University was fiitingly high
lighted by an excellent service in the Me
tfiorial Church.
And at the same tun*-, between lIJ and 1 I
.1 •ii., more than 60 uate students observed
founders' Day in an unnecessarily mconvmi
i jit and even dangeious situation. They were
I .. fed in the Main Library, securely. with no
.»i parent means ot exit other than through the
windows.
I'he loan desks weie closed and not one of
the lew library workers that could be found
h.i a key to any outside door.
Certainly the most important consideration
is Die fire hazaid. If there had been a hie, the
only escape would have been to break down
doors or smash windows. The Libraiy doors
.ir< solid, and bioken glass is dangerous when
f.re hysteria sets a crowd in motion.
A second consideration is the inconvenience
to students wfio wanted to leave for various
if isons, particularly those who had II o'clock
< lasses. The doors weje not opened until
i0:56, and then only after extreme "pressure"
from the caged students.
Why didn't the students leave when the
Library closed? Because there was no teal at
tempt to inform them that they would be
locked in if they remained. The lights weie
not turned out and many students and Library
workers were there.
The Daily had publicized that ihe Library
would be closed during that time, but this was
interpreted to mean that the loan desks would
- lose .... a logical interpretation, we believe.
The decision to "close" the Library during
the Memorial Church services was made by
the Committee on Public Exercises, in line
-with precedent. The interpretation of "close"
was left to the Libraiy administration. The
blame for the resulting incident may b« shared

by both groups.
In the first place, we believe that the Com
unttee on Public Exercises should have de
fined their decision and made that definition
public.
And we believe that while founders' Day
should always be observed, the Committee
should go beyond precedent and take a new
perspective of how best lo observe this day.
Normal seating capacity ol the Memorial
Chinch is 1,800. Many students who wanted
to attend yesterday's services were turned
away.
It does not make sense to close the facilities
of the Mam Library completely lo these stu
dents and to others who placed their studies
above the services.
It seems a logical compromise to us to leave
the Library building and the Reserve Book
Hoom loan desk open, and close only the othei
loan desks.
An hour ol reference woik in the Heserve
book Hoom before a mid-term can make a dil
ference in a student's giade, and the other Li
brary rooms should be left open for studying.
It would seem that there is no dishonor to
the memory ol the founders of the University,
established for the woik of learning, if students
use a Iree class period on founders' Day to
take advantage of that University's facilities
for learning.
Therefore, we suggest that the Committee
on Public Exercises next year take a new per
spective on the appropriate ways and means
of honoring Stanford's founders.
The Libiary administration could easily
have cleared the Libraiy. It is a simple matter
to turn out the lights, announce that the doors
aie to be locked until the services are over,
and ask everyone to leave.
If this had been done there at least would
have been no lire hazard, only in convenience
to those who wanted to study in the quiet sur
roundings.

should go beyond precedent and take a new
perspective of how best lo observe this day.
Normal seating capacity ol the Memorial
Chinch is 1,800. Many students who wanted
to attend yesterday's services were turned
away.
It does not make sense to close the facilities
of the Mam Library completely lo these stu
dents and to others who placed their studies
above the services.
It seems a logical compromise to us to leave
the Library building and the Reserve Book
Hoom loan desk open, and close only the othei
loan desks.
An hour ol reference woik in the Heserve
book Hoom before a mid-term can make a dil
ference in a student's giade, and the other Li
brary rooms should be left open for studying.
It would seem that there is no dishonor to
the memory ol the founders of the University,
established for the woik of learning, if students
use a Iree class period on founders' Day to
take advantage of that University's facilities
for learning.
Therefore, we suggest that the Committee
on Public Exercises next year take a new per
spective on the appropriate ways and means
of honoring Stanford's founders.
The Libiary administration could easily
have cleared the Libraiy. It is a simple matter
to turn out the lights, announce that the doors
aie to be locked until the services are over,
and ask everyone to leave.
If this had been done there at least would
have been no lire hazard, only in convenience
to those who wanted to study in the quiet sur
roundings.
Yesterday the 59tli founders' 1)oy o-lebra
!,• ,ii was held on out campus. The observance
of this annual event honoring tin; founders
< 112 Stanford University was fiitingly high
lighted by an excellent service in the Me
tfiorial Church.
And at the same tun*-, between lIJ and 1 I
.1 •ii., more than 60 uate students observed
founders' Day in an unnecessarily mconvmi
i jit and even dangeious situation. They were
I .. fed in the Main Library, securely. with no
.»i parent means ot exit other than through the
windows.
I'he loan desks weie closed and not one of
the lew library workers that could be found
h.i a key to any outside door.
Certainly the most important consideration
is Die fire hazaid. If there had been a hie, the
only escape would have been to break down
doors or smash windows. The Libraiy doors
.ir< solid, and bioken glass is dangerous when
f.re hysteria sets a crowd in motion.
A second consideration is the inconvenience
to students wfio wanted to leave for various
if isons, particularly those who had II o'clock
< lasses. The doors weje not opened until
i0:56, and then only after extreme "pressure"
from the caged students.
Why didn't the students leave when the
Library closed? Because there was no teal at
tempt to inform them that they would be
locked in if they remained. The lights weie
not turned out and many students and Library
workers were there.
The Daily had publicized that ihe Library
would be closed during that time, but this was
interpreted to mean that the loan desks would
- lose .... a logical interpretation, we believe.
The decision to "close" the Library during
the Memorial Church services was made by
the Committee on Public Exercises, in line
-with precedent. The interpretation of "close"
was left to the Libraiy administration. The
blame for the resulting incident may b« shared

by both groups.
In the first place, we believe that the Com
unttee on Public Exercises should have de
fined their decision and made that definition
public.
And we believe that while founders' Day
should always be observed, the Committee
should go beyond precedent and take a new
