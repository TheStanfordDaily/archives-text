### BILL DAILEY 
This business of writing "that la:-.I column" is not
an easy one. You think you know what you want to
ay, but you have trouble saying it. Each time you
tart to write, people get in your way. People who
have meant "Stanford'' to you. And von know that

you are going to write a muddled
tory about it, but you don't care.
Any story about something that
means so n uch to you is bound to
bo a little muddled
It's £cin; to be a story about
people n: mcd Sterling and Kimp
ton and Balch and many others
. . a story about a lot of people I
who never let their great respon- j
Inhties make them forget that they \

first and foremost extremely human.
i'' going to be a story about the kind of proi't ssoi's
~!io can win your admiration for theii intellectual
.•.parity and at the same tune oil» i yon ;i incere and
.arm friendship.
And you think of how much yr.it could .viile about
11 i (oys and anxieties of watching your Stanh.i I ath
li'k teams. You think especially about the greatest
Hi •< Game you could ever hope to see. And the strange
i.i ng is that it was a game which w<* lost The year
■■sis J947, and the score war, 21 to 18 And you know
lot ol other people who <aie usually too blase lor .such
ii'ings as "school spirit" have trouble with a lump in
iheir thioats when they think back to this one.
And then you try to decide which Stanford victory
: . ve you the most pleasure to see. You mull it over
i yo'jr mind and decide that last, year's to 14 win
.- i dt ah old "SC" was as happy an afternoon as you
■ . .id hope to spend. You remember how you de
al- d with yourself that week about, "going south"
• a use you had two midterm: the following Monday.

Then you recall that alter the game you didn t care
if you flunked them llat. Nothing mattered that day
except that we had humbled the hated Trojans.
Your mind is filled with thoughts of the fellows and
girl:, who have been your own particular friends
. . . . the boys in the house .... the guys you first
met at Encina, who have since gone their separate
way .... the girls you've met in class, at parties, on
blind dates, and, yes, even bt exchange dinners.
And you chuckle as you think of the days when you
were in junior high school and used to wonder about
what soi t of guys I he "big tune" college athletes were.
And then you have to laugh out loud, because you've
learned over and over that the type ol stars you
idealized in your adolescence are, after all, just hu
man: like the rest of us. Il is a lesson you have learned
well by knowing fellows like (jus Chavalas, Jesse
Cone, Drew Terramorse, Larry Hofl, George Yardley,
Holy Boruck, Gene Martin, "Oats" ('handler, Norm
Nourse, Bill Arce, Bobby Anderson, and so many
others that to list them all would (ill many a column.
And you smile as you think ol the first time you
read the Stanford Information Bulletin. That was
years ago, wasn't it? As you read it, you pictured what
Stanford Would be like, but you didn't know about
some of the places and thing that would really make
up your Stanford. Places and things called The Daily,
The ('happie, Lake Lag, trips lo the beach, "Kossot's,"
Encina watei bagging, the Pajamai ino, The Big Game,
and so many others.
You think of all these people and you are sure the
last, column is going to be a tough one to write. The
story is there, but you can't see it for the People. And
then you realize that the People are the .story. And
you hope your efforts to be amusing have added a
little something to the Stanford life." And then you
punch the last period key and stop writing.
