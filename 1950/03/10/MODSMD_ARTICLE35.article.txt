# Campus Cobblers Apply Talents to Keeping Shoes Repaired for Farm Roughs and Gals
## 
### ERLING FORLAND 
If a 16-year-old boy hadn't
een restless about 50 years
go, Stanford shoes probably
wouldn't be repaired on the
arm today. Because of that
oy, Eugene Delyon, there is a
ampus shoe repair shop on
anama street, next to the Book
lore.
Eugene Delyon learned the cob
ler's trade in Martinique, in the
re -1 rh West Indies, about (lie; turn of
century. Like most of the other
jungstcrs, he was restless and
learned of adventures in far ofT
laces.
When a promoter came looking for
<4iocmakcr to go to the South Sea
lands, he jumped at the chance. By
10 time he had put in his contracted

sficd and wanted to go home,
owever, the promoter refused to
,ve young Delyon the promised
cket. back to Martinique. But Eu
me had saved his money and had
mugh for a ticket to San Francisco,
> lie took a boat there.
Worked in Palo Alto
When he got to San Francisco, he
as contacted by Thoits Shoe Store
i Palo Alto who needed a shoe
laker. He worked for Thoits for a
umber of years.
At the age of 2G. Eugene opened a
me retail and repair store in May
?ld. Successful there, he saw that
icre was a growing need for a shoe
lop at Stanford. He set up a shoe
and near the Stanford Post Office
id hired a man to shine shoes and

ayfield.
Eugene was doing quite well, but
as increasingly lonesome for home,
c sent to Martinique for his sister,
id after two years he sent for his

100 stand on campus. Business
joined and the Delyons soon needed
larger shop.
Formerly in Cellar
Albert contacted University offi
als and contracted for space for a

Hut business was growing and so
as the Cellar restaurant. The Uni
irsity, therefore, built the present
toe shop and Albert moved there in
»?>O. In the old place he had gotten
ong with the bare necessities, but
; now installed a complete set of
ie best machinery available.
In 1906 his nephew, Maurice, Fu
me's son and the present manager
the shop, joined him. Business kept
creasing. The shop stayed open
iring the war years despite the
•arcitics.
Albert Dalyon died in 1045, after

?ars. Maurice now ran the shop
one.
Today, three men handle the work,
aurice. Albert's protege and suc

mtinue to repair Farm shoes for
