Dick Knezevich, decisioned Ed Vra
nizan of the Mission in the first
meet.
Welterweight Karl May will take
over the No. 1 spot in the absence
of Jose Rael, who has signed for a
bout with the books. May, with his
slugging, hard-fighting tatcics, has \
been a favorite with Farm fans all
season.
He will be matched with Bill Sul
livan, who lost a close decision to I
Rael on the same evening that May j
fought to a draw with Missionite '
Bob RatliH.
Rounding out the card will be the
lightweight return battle between
Bob Baker of Stanford and Al Ter
ra zas. Baker showed improvement
in his last bout and may avenge his
earlier loss to Terra/as.
