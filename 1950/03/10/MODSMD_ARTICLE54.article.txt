# Stanford Ski Team Brings Credit to Farm
## Boucher, Bemis, Thalberg, Lee Taylor Spearhead Indian Racers 
### EARL ODELL 
Few people on the Farm realize
the extent of the Stanford ski team s
activities. Not only have they re
ceived little mention and publicity,
but they are carrying on without
any help whatsoever from the As
sociated Students.
Yet they are making a name
for themselves—and for Stanford
throughout the West, and in some
cases throughout the nation. Stan
lord skiers have even made the
Olympics in the past, and it is a
far-from-remote possibility that it
will be repeated in the future.
While many Pacific Coast college
and university ski teams are pro
vided with instructors and financial
assistance by the school, the Stan
ford team is on its own, partly
financed by membership in the
Stanford Ski Club and partly by
"chipping in," and giving each other
helpful hints in place of a trained
instructor.
Squaw Valley Meet
Presently, the Stanford ski team
is in training for the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Meet to be held at
Squaw Vallew April 7-8. The meet
is under the auspices of the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Skiers' Union,
of which Stanford's Greg Bemis is
president. The Card team hopes to
practice during the spring vacation
for the four-way meet.
The four contests will be down
hill racing, jumping, cross-country
racing, and slalom racing—l'm in
formed that a slalom race is where
they stick a bunch of flags in the
snow and the purpose of the race
is to go in, out, and around them
without knocking them down.
Sounds simple.
The closing meet of the season
will be held at (or in) the Sugar
Bowl at Donner Summit April 15-
1(5. This is the Warren Vanderbilt
Memorial Trophy Race and will
provide hot competition for Stan
ford's skiers—that is, if you can get
hot competition in cold snow.
Skiers Take Second
At the Tresidder Memorial Meet
at Yosemite earlier this year Stan
ford took second place behind Cal.
Also participating in the meet were
Nevada, San Jose State, and College
of the Pacific. The Bears took first
and second place in every event, led
by their John Lee and Leif Somer

in the downhill race at Donner

Sumn.il and placed every man on
the team in the first 14 men to fin
ish u 1 of a field of 45 skiers. Butch
Boucher, captain of the ski team,
' took second place.

team were not present, the Cards
