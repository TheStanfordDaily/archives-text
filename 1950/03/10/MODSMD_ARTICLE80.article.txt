# Boxers, Matmen End Season; Groaners Lose Two Coaches
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
This evening the Indian boxers
fight their last match of the season,
a return thriller against Santa Clara
in the Missionites' home gym at 8.
On March 17 and IS, one week
hence, Stanford's wrestlers will
write "finis" to their season at the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Meet,
to be held at Cal.
In light of these developments,
perhaps now is the best time to look
back over the season accomplish
ments of these gladiators and pass
along a few comments.
Comment No. 1: Bouquets to
Boxing Coach Ray Lunny and
Wrestling Coach Win Mumhy. Con
si ering the difficulties that laced
them, both coaches turned in fine
jobs, had fairly successful seasons,
provided entertainment for numer
out Card fans, and taught many
Farm students thj essentials of the
two oldest sports in history.
Fortunately, Ray Lunny will be
back next season in the same spot
he took over shortly alter the war.
Unfortunately, Stanford stands to
lose two wrestling coaches in the
near future. Chuck Taylor, who
needs no introduction to football,
rugby, intramural, etc., fans, is go
ing to the San Francisco '49c rs as
line coach. In addition to his many
duties, Chuck has acted as official
coach for the grapplers- arranging
schedules and so forth—while Win
Mumby, graduate education major,
has done the actual couching of the
team and teaching of the classes.
This brings us to:
Comment No. 2: Au revoir and
bon voyage to Winston Mumby,
who leaves sometime this month
when his visa is OK'd—for the
Woodstock School in Mussoorie,
India, 7,000 feet up in the Himala
yas.
Mumby started wrestling at Stan
ford under his father, Ted Mumby,
present coach at San Jose State,
after he got out of the Army. When
the senior Mumby left, Win took
over and has been coaching the
sport ever since, three years this
season.
Comment No. 3: Now that the
benevolent and guiding lathers of
the sport of grunt ami groan have
been lured elsewhere, the question
stands: Who will coach wrestling
next year? No one seems to know
yet, and enthusiasts of the sport
only hope that someone will know
by fall quarter this yi ar. That this
minor sport is worthy of a good
coach and a good schedule and sonic
more considerate treatment from
the Athletic Department seems ob
vious. Two classes and some 15
team members account for around
50 students per quarter in the fall
and winter when it is civen.
Comment No. 4: Ray Lunny, who
is also completing his third year on
the Farm, has indicated that he
would be willing to take over the
coaching of wrestling if that ar
rangement were suitable to his em
ployers. Ray came to Stanford sev
eral months after he- got out of the
Navy and immediately' took over
the coaching of the boxing team
and the teaching ol about three
classes, totaling 70 to 75 students, a
quarter. Once a top Bay Area light
weight and former contender under
manager Joey Fox, Ray was forced
to quit the ring when he injured his
hands.
If Lunny did take over wrestling
next year he would be filling the
spot Chuck Taylor is vacating, still
leaving Mumby's position unfilled.
Comment No. 5: Prospects for
both ring sports for next year are
good. Though Lunny will feel the
loss of Jose Rael and Emery Mitch
ell, such veterans us John Collon,
Jim Hammond, Hill Sharp, Karl
May, Jack llickel. Don Knheig,
IVlike I'eisinger. Dave Oherlin, Jerry
Fannin and Hol» linker are all ex
pected to return. If an expanded
schedule is approved these fighters
may form the nucleus of one of the
best fistic teams in Farm history.

Similar developments are in line
for the grapplers. The return of
Dick DeWitt. Rah Harmon, Kollin
Rose, Captain Don Williams, and
frosh standouts Ted Ilariton. Jack
Ogelshy, Rudy liuchser, and Huy
den Lcason seems to be reason
enough for the addition of a few
meets and a trip or two. This sea
son the squad participated in nine
dual and four open meets.
Comment No. (i: The summing
up. FiJty to 75 students per quar
ter in boxing and wrestling classes
plus more than 100 .aspirants who
entered the intramural tournaments
in each sport indicate a definite in
terest on the part of the student
body — more than for any other
minor sport.
Boxing has a good coach. Wres
tling had a good coach and needs
another to (ill his place.
Wrestling and boxing meets
should be held together in the Pa
vilion. This arrangement has proven
very successful at other schools and
could provide full houses — and a
latter budge t for the two ring sports
—here.
The University's athletic program,
especially for minor sports, has
been subject to criticism. Boxing
and wrestling have the student
participants interest, the intramu
ral ists' interest, and the spectator
interest besides the ability to pay
their way. The development >'
these two sports is the logical <<•-
ginning of a better minor spoils
program at Stanford.

interest besides the ability to pay
their way. The development >'
these two sports is the logical <<•-
ginning of a better minor spoils
program at Stanford.
This evening the Indian boxers
fight their last match of the season,
a return thriller against Santa Clara
in the Missionites' home gym at 8.
On March 17 and IS, one week
hence, Stanford's wrestlers will
write "finis" to their season at the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Meet,
to be held at Cal.
In light of these developments,
perhaps now is the best time to look
back over the season accomplish
ments of these gladiators and pass
along a few comments.
Comment No. 1: Bouquets to
Boxing Coach Ray Lunny and
Wrestling Coach Win Mumhy. Con
si ering the difficulties that laced
them, both coaches turned in fine
jobs, had fairly successful seasons,
provided entertainment for numer
out Card fans, and taught many
Farm students thj essentials of the
two oldest sports in history.
Fortunately, Ray Lunny will be
back next season in the same spot
he took over shortly alter the war.
Unfortunately, Stanford stands to
lose two wrestling coaches in the
near future. Chuck Taylor, who
needs no introduction to football,
rugby, intramural, etc., fans, is go
ing to the San Francisco '49c rs as
line coach. In addition to his many
duties, Chuck has acted as official
coach for the grapplers- arranging
schedules and so forth—while Win
Mumby, graduate education major,
has done the actual couching of the
team and teaching of the classes.
This brings us to:
Comment No. 2: Au revoir and
bon voyage to Winston Mumby,
who leaves sometime this month
when his visa is OK'd—for the
Woodstock School in Mussoorie,
India, 7,000 feet up in the Himala
yas.
Mumby started wrestling at Stan
ford under his father, Ted Mumby,
present coach at San Jose State,
after he got out of the Army. When
the senior Mumby left, Win took
over and has been coaching the
sport ever since, three years this
season.
Comment No. 3: Now that the
benevolent and guiding lathers of
the sport of grunt ami groan have
been lured elsewhere, the question
stands: Who will coach wrestling
next year? No one seems to know
yet, and enthusiasts of the sport
only hope that someone will know
by fall quarter this yi ar. That this
minor sport is worthy of a good
coach and a good schedule and sonic
more considerate treatment from
the Athletic Department seems ob
vious. Two classes and some 15
team members account for around
50 students per quarter in the fall
and winter when it is civen.
Comment No. 4: Ray Lunny, who
is also completing his third year on
the Farm, has indicated that he
would be willing to take over the
coaching of wrestling if that ar
rangement were suitable to his em
ployers. Ray came to Stanford sev
eral months after he- got out of the
Navy and immediately' took over
the coaching of the boxing team
and the teaching ol about three
classes, totaling 70 to 75 students, a
quarter. Once a top Bay Area light
weight and former contender under
manager Joey Fox, Ray was forced
to quit the ring when he injured his
hands.
If Lunny did take over wrestling
next year he would be filling the
spot Chuck Taylor is vacating, still
leaving Mumby's position unfilled.
Comment No. 5: Prospects for
both ring sports for next year are
good. Though Lunny will feel the
loss of Jose Rael and Emery Mitch
ell, such veterans us John Collon,
Jim Hammond, Hill Sharp, Karl
May, Jack llickel. Don Knheig,
IVlike I'eisinger. Dave Oherlin, Jerry
Fannin and Hol» linker are all ex
pected to return. If an expanded
schedule is approved these fighters
may form the nucleus of one of the
best fistic teams in Farm history.

Similar developments are in line
for the grapplers. The return of
Dick DeWitt. Rah Harmon, Kollin
Rose, Captain Don Williams, and
frosh standouts Ted Ilariton. Jack
Ogelshy, Rudy liuchser, and Huy
den Lcason seems to be reason
enough for the addition of a few
meets and a trip or two. This sea
son the squad participated in nine
dual and four open meets.
Comment No. (i: The summing
up. FiJty to 75 students per quar
ter in boxing and wrestling classes
plus more than 100 .aspirants who
entered the intramural tournaments
in each sport indicate a definite in
terest on the part of the student
body — more than for any other
minor sport.
Boxing has a good coach. Wres
tling had a good coach and needs
another to (ill his place.
Wrestling and boxing meets
should be held together in the Pa
vilion. This arrangement has proven
very successful at other schools and
could provide full houses — and a
latter budge t for the two ring sports
—here.
The University's athletic program,
especially for minor sports, has
been subject to criticism. Boxing
and wrestling have the student
participants interest, the intramu
ral ists' interest, and the spectator
interest besides the ability to pay
their way. The development >'

been subject to criticism. Boxing
and wrestling have the student
participants interest, the intramu
ral ists' interest, and the spectator
interest besides the ability to pay
their way. The development >'
these two sports is the logical <<•-
ginning of a better minor spoils
program at Stanford.
This evening the Indian boxers
fight their last match of the season,
a return thriller against Santa Clara
in the Missionites' home gym at 8.
On March 17 and IS, one week
hence, Stanford's wrestlers will
write "finis" to their season at the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Meet,
to be held at Cal.
In light of these developments,
perhaps now is the best time to look
back over the season accomplish
ments of these gladiators and pass
along a few comments.
Comment No. 1: Bouquets to
Boxing Coach Ray Lunny and
Wrestling Coach Win Mumhy. Con
si ering the difficulties that laced
them, both coaches turned in fine
jobs, had fairly successful seasons,
provided entertainment for numer
out Card fans, and taught many
Farm students thj essentials of the
two oldest sports in history.
Fortunately, Ray Lunny will be
back next season in the same spot
he took over shortly alter the war.
Unfortunately, Stanford stands to
lose two wrestling coaches in the
near future. Chuck Taylor, who
needs no introduction to football,
rugby, intramural, etc., fans, is go
ing to the San Francisco '49c rs as
line coach. In addition to his many
duties, Chuck has acted as official
coach for the grapplers- arranging
schedules and so forth—while Win
Mumby, graduate education major,
has done the actual couching of the
team and teaching of the classes.
This brings us to:
Comment No. 2: Au revoir and
bon voyage to Winston Mumby,
who leaves sometime this month
when his visa is OK'd—for the
Woodstock School in Mussoorie,
India, 7,000 feet up in the Himala
yas.
Mumby started wrestling at Stan
ford under his father, Ted Mumby,
present coach at San Jose State,
after he got out of the Army. When
the senior Mumby left, Win took
over and has been coaching the
sport ever since, three years this
season.
Comment No. 3: Now that the
benevolent and guiding lathers of
the sport of grunt ami groan have
been lured elsewhere, the question
stands: Who will coach wrestling
next year? No one seems to know
yet, and enthusiasts of the sport
only hope that someone will know
by fall quarter this yi ar. That this
minor sport is worthy of a good
coach and a good schedule and sonic
more considerate treatment from
the Athletic Department seems ob
vious. Two classes and some 15
team members account for around
50 students per quarter in the fall
and winter when it is civen.
Comment No. 4: Ray Lunny, who
is also completing his third year on
the Farm, has indicated that he
would be willing to take over the
coaching of wrestling if that ar
rangement were suitable to his em
ployers. Ray came to Stanford sev
eral months after he- got out of the
Navy and immediately' took over
the coaching of the boxing team
and the teaching ol about three
classes, totaling 70 to 75 students, a
quarter. Once a top Bay Area light
weight and former contender under
manager Joey Fox, Ray was forced
to quit the ring when he injured his
hands.
If Lunny did take over wrestling
next year he would be filling the
spot Chuck Taylor is vacating, still
leaving Mumby's position unfilled.
Comment No. 5: Prospects for
both ring sports for next year are
good. Though Lunny will feel the
loss of Jose Rael and Emery Mitch
ell, such veterans us John Collon,
Jim Hammond, Hill Sharp, Karl
May, Jack llickel. Don Knheig,
IVlike I'eisinger. Dave Oherlin, Jerry
Fannin and Hol» linker are all ex
pected to return. If an expanded
schedule is approved these fighters
may form the nucleus of one of the
best fistic teams in Farm history.

Similar developments are in line
for the grapplers. The return of
Dick DeWitt. Rah Harmon, Kollin
Rose, Captain Don Williams, and
frosh standouts Ted Ilariton. Jack
Ogelshy, Rudy liuchser, and Huy
den Lcason seems to be reason
enough for the addition of a few
meets and a trip or two. This sea
son the squad participated in nine
dual and four open meets.
Comment No. (i: The summing
up. FiJty to 75 students per quar
ter in boxing and wrestling classes
plus more than 100 .aspirants who
entered the intramural tournaments
in each sport indicate a definite in
terest on the part of the student
body — more than for any other
minor sport.
Boxing has a good coach. Wres
tling had a good coach and needs
another to (ill his place.
Wrestling and boxing meets
should be held together in the Pa
vilion. This arrangement has proven
very successful at other schools and
could provide full houses — and a
latter budge t for the two ring sports
—here.
