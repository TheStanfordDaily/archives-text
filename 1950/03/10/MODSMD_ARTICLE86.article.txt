National Service fraternity, at. a
meeting Tuesday night. Pledging
ceremonies for 14 new members were
also conducted.
Intended to provide a more ade
quate medium for arranging rides
home for spring vacation, the auto
ride lile has been placed in the lobby
of the Main Library. Hailcy Clowe,
president, requests all persons wish
ing or offering rides to any of the
'So .'tales to fill out the colored cards
and file under that person's state.
A special section of the file has
been created for Southern California
