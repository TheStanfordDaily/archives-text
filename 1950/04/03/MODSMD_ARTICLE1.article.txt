## Nationalist Victory 
### 
TAIPEI, F urmosu, April 2 i/\')
Chinese Nationalists today claimed
their greatest victory of this year
against the Communistsâ€”the com
plete annihilation of the largest Red
force yet to invade Hainan Island.
Here, in brief, is the Nationalist
story: 5,000 Red invaders slaugh
tered and more than 2,000 captured
in a land, sea, and air battle that
raged for 12 hours Saturday.
Nationalist supporters proudly
declared the victory meant the old
days of running were ended, that
the forces of Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek were bent on meeting and
beating the Reds.
