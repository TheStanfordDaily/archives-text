# Women Alter Housing Policy
## 
### 
AWS has set up a new policy for
filling vacancies that occur between
each quarter's drawings.
Women who drew for residence
last quarter but were not satisfied
with their placement may apply for
a change under the new system,
which replaces the former "shrink
age" list. These women may name
three choices of residence and will
be placed as vacancies occur ac
cording to the numbers they picked
in the last drawing.
Discussion of this problem was
brought before AWS Housing Com
mittee last quarter, and the new
plan was approved by AWS Advis
ory Board at its last meeting.
This quarter Housing Committee
will discuss questions concerning
summer placement, senior prefer
ence, and the allotment of vacancies
in the spring quarter drawing.
Meetings of the group arc open to
anyone interested in these prob
lems, and are held on Wednesdays
in the Women's Clubhouse.
