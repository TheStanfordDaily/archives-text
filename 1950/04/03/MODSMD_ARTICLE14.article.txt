Keillor's note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles on student
participation in campus cxtra
curicular activities.)
lIR — SIRO — UNESCO — no,
they're not just a set of letters,
though you've probably heard them
in the abbreviated form so long you
don't even think about the real J
meaning. But the lIR really deos
have a story.
Actually the Institute of Interna
tional Relations functions to in- j
crease the interest of students in |
the Bay Area in international af- j
fairs. The students of the lIR plan
conferences to spread information
among high school and college |
groups, distribute travel informa- j
tion, and arrange travel accommo
dations for Stanford students.
Speakers, radio programs, and |

pamphlets all combine to spread in
formation on the United Nations
and other international affairs.
But the relief efforts of the lIR
are what you hear about most. In
this phase they work mainly
through SIRO to collect food, cloth
ing, and other material needs for
the peoples of the ravaged countries
of the world. Last year they dis
tributed nine tons of clothing alone.
And what about the shack sitting
next door to th eQuad quarters
with a huge sign "IIR"? In this ;
office, the lIR offers a variety of po
sitions to students, in relation to
their available time and ability.
Fields cover general office work,
public relations, and speeches to
schools and civic groups.
The executives direct groups of
activities and co-ordinate college
people in the Student World Af- |

fairs of Northern California. These
students as well as the speakers
may earn scholastic credit.
The ofiicc is continually expand
ing. Present activities provide op
portunities in engineering, litera
ture, social sciences, and art. As
well as directing the group plans,
the students manage the budget,
which runs around $4,000 annually.
Along with the knowledge of
travel opportunities and scholar
ships, the lIR offers certain entries
into possible future positions in in
ternational aaffirs. Last year three
students worked as interns in the
1 United Nations in New York.
Acting in the capacity of host, the
j 111 l receives well-known guests in
| the international relations field. Re
| cent visitors to the Stanford cam
pus have been Charles Malik, for
| mcr president of the Economic and

Social Council of the UN; Benjamin
Cohen, now assistant Secretary
General of the UN; and Ken Hol
land, president of tlie Institute of
International Education.
Complimenting Stanford's lIR,
Milton Eisenhower, president of
Kansas State College and former
chairman of the United States Na
tional Commission for UNESCO,
wrote:
"And 1 know of no student body
that is doing more to educate itself
for world citizenship than the st.ii-
J dent body of Stanford University.
Through III? Stanford students are
doing a job which might well be
imitated by the students of other
schools throughout, the land. Per
sonally, as chairman of the United
States National Commission for
UNESCO, I offer to Stanford my
heartiest congratulations."
