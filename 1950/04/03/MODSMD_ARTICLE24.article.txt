# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
I strode confidently into The Daily Shack, finished
'At the last two bars of "Enjoy Yourself," turned my
Lest side to the light, and pointed out imply, "I have
leturned."
There was a girl with a Balboa tan sitting there. She

happened to be the Managing
iiditor.
"1 have returned," I repeated,
•just in case she had missed my
first try at true confession.
She didn't say anything and
looked the same way.
1 decided it was worth one more
try, "I've returned, baby," 1 bo
carted out of the corner of my
mouth.
"Who?" she asked limply.
"Hall," I pleaded. "Creator of

the Front Row, writer of Bull Session, guardian of
the people, and . .
Oh, she admitted, being sick all over hei type
writer.
"Yep, I've returned," I started again.
"But where were you when we needed you la.':l
March?" she asked.
"Studying for finals," I lied.
"Yah, we heard you was on a 10-day drunk and
didn't sober up until they caught you trying to blow
up the Econ Building."
"Nah," I said, trying to get into the spirit of things.
"I was studying, honest. I had a "Marriage and the

Family" course, and had to catch up on the home
work. Besides, I was weeping so much over Bill
Dailey's departure that the track team almost tossed
me in for a sponge."
"That's too bad;" she snarled. "Well, what are you
going to mess up this quarter?"
"Nothing," 1 said, turning my eyes humbly to the
, floor. "Nothing at all."
"Well, what are you doing around here then?" she
pointed out cleverly, and she had a point.
"Listen, baby, it's Spring. The birds are out, the
sun is shining, the girls look like girls again, and I've
completely lost my head. I'm back to do Bull Session."
She jumped to her feet, got sick again, and then ran
into the editor's office. She and he came out together.
"Will you make 'em laugh?" they cried.
"Sure, sure," was all I could say. "How about the
one that Herb Caen stole about the Roble girl trying
to act like Gregory Peck . ,
"That's not quite it," they explained.
"Oh yeah, well how about the one about the greatest
war song ever written—'Here Comes the Bride'?"
"Stop it. Stop it," they echoed. "You get the job,
but stop it."
I hanks, I said simply. And then 1 took out my
Time Schedule, ripped it into pieces, muttered one
last intelligent sound such as here we go again,
started to think up some new Reg Day gags, and headed
for Rossott's to get in the proper mood.
By gosh, it's Spring.
