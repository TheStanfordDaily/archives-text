### 
A scholarly book written under the
r.u:,pices of Stanford's famed Food
Research Institute is the target of a
vituperative attack by the Russian
l-i ess.
"The Socialized Agriculture of the
USSR," by Russian-born Naum
Jasny, supports the view that since
the Soviet Union is still primarily an
agricultural economy, a thorough

''Lunatic Lies"
Izvestia, the official Ruseion news
paper, terms the book ''lunatic fabri
> ations":
"Anti-Soviet slander is in greal de
mand in the mercenary American
press. Numerous 'experts on the
iiussian question' are trying their
1/ r 'ds in the field, disguising their
I) tred and slander against the Soviet
Union under the mask of 'scientific
icsearch'."
Izvestia concludes its violent denial
>.i Dr. Jasny's findings: "We have
• imply exposed American methods of
cientific research' based on mali
< ious slander and aiming at conceal
ing the truth, at deceiving and hood
winking their readers."
To this Dr. Jasny replies that he
jj\ hes the Russians, instead of at
tacking all outsiders who try to find
out what is going on in their country,
would make public the actual figures
Vigorous Phot est s
Reliable official figures being lack

ing approximations from such scat
tered statistics as could be found
•lost readers will be interested in
them and in his conclusions that

food Research Institute, is described
by Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, executive
director of the Institute, as one of the
h-w men outside Russia who could
write such an authoritative study of
oviet agricultural problems.
