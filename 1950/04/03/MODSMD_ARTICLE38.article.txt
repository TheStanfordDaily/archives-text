# Stanford Horsehiders Split First Series With UCLA
## Chez Hurls Indians to 4 to 3 Win; Unearned Runs Mar Opening Game 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's baseballers jumped into the CIBA pennant race over
the weekend by splitting a two-game series with UCLA on the
Westwood campus. The Indians came back on Saturday afternoon
to down the Bruins, 4 to 3, after losing a heartbreaking, 2 to 1, ball
game the day before in the season's opener.
Sophomore Joe Chez, Coach Everett Dean's surprise starter, held

the Bruins in check lor eight innings
in Saturday's contest as he chalked up
his second win iti as many starts for
the Indian varsity. Chez limited the
lit ii ins to three hits and one unearned
i mi while striking out seven batters
l"i' the first eight stanzas, while his
mates were collecting four runs off
two UCLA chuckers.
The Bruin defense, which had
played flawless ball in the first game,
Ml apart in the Saturday tilt, as they
rommitled nine errors.
Clegg Triples
Stanford pushed across its first run
in the .second frame, when Dick Clegg
led oil' with a triple and scored when
Hi uin second-sacker Pete Moody let
an attempted cut-off throw get by
him.
Tom Shaw scored the Indians' sec
ond run when UCLA's centerfielder
Richie Treat dropped Bruce Cam
eron's fly ball with two out. Stanford
put together singles by Charlie Cole
and Tom Shaw, a base on balls, two
stolen bases, and two more Bruin er
rors to score their third run in the
fifth inning.
Stanford picked up what proved to
be the winning run in the seventh
frame. Clegg was hit by a pitched ball
and moved to second on John Clay
pool's sacrifice. Clegg scored on Dick
Cor/.ine's long double to left field.
Bruins Threaten
Trailing, 4 to 1, in their half of the
ninth, UCLA put on a rally that
threatened to wipe out Stanford's
lead. Lead-off man Boyd Jefferies
finally drew a base on balls after foul
ing off half a dozen of Chez's pitches.
Two consecutive singles scored Jef
feries, and put the tying runs on first
and second with nobody out.
A sacrifice and a wild throw to the
plate by Dave Melton put the Bruins
within one run of the Indians. Coach
Dean then called Dave Stott in from
the bull pen and Stott came through
by getting pinch-hitter John Matuiich
!•) pop out and striking out Mike Ga
y.flla to end the game.
Two unearned runs gave Bruin Bob
Andrews the decision over Jack Hei
nen in Friday's tight pitchers' battle,
lleinen gave up only six hits, while
striking out eight, but the Indians
were unable to hit in the clutch, as
they left eight runners stranded on
the base paths.
Kout Cal Poly
Stanford dumped Cal Poly, 9 to 2,
and were shut out. 4 to 0, by the Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara
in warm-up games during the early
part of the week.
Chez was credited with the win
over Cal Poly as he allowed two runs
and five hits while striking out three
in the six innings that he worked.
Stanford pounded two Cal Poly pitch
ers for 12 hits, and the Mustang de
fense aided the Indians' cause by
1 browing the ball all over the park,
while Stanford's base runners kept on
i tinning.
At Santa Barbara, lack of clutch
hitting again led to the Indians'
downfall as they collected nine hits
but could get a man as far as third
only twice.
Pitchers Come Through
The four-game trip showed that
Stanford's pitching staff will be able
to hold its own with any in the
league. The six Indian hurlers gave
up only five earned runs in the 34
innings pitched.
The only serious injury on the trip

occurred when Jim Castagnoli re
injured his shoulder at Santa Bar
bara. Until the husky catcher's arm
is back in shape, he will be used as a
pinch hitter.

but could get a man as far as third
only twice.
Pitchers Come Through
The four-game trip showed that
Stanford's pitching staff will be able
to hold its own with any in the
league. The six Indian hurlers gave
up only five earned runs in the 34
innings pitched.
The only serious injury on the trip

occurred when Jim Castagnoli re
injured his shoulder at Santa Bar
bara. Until the husky catcher's arm
is back in shape, he will be used as a
pinch hitter.

Stanford's baseballers jumped into the CIBA pennant race over
the weekend by splitting a two-game series with UCLA on the
Westwood campus. The Indians came back on Saturday afternoon
to down the Bruins, 4 to 3, after losing a heartbreaking, 2 to 1, ball
game the day before in the season's opener.
Sophomore Joe Chez, Coach Everett Dean's surprise starter, held

the Bruins in check lor eight innings
in Saturday's contest as he chalked up
his second win iti as many starts for
the Indian varsity. Chez limited the
lit ii ins to three hits and one unearned
i mi while striking out seven batters
l"i' the first eight stanzas, while his
mates were collecting four runs off
two UCLA chuckers.
The Bruin defense, which had
played flawless ball in the first game,
Ml apart in the Saturday tilt, as they
rommitled nine errors.
Clegg Triples
Stanford pushed across its first run
in the .second frame, when Dick Clegg
led oil' with a triple and scored when
Hi uin second-sacker Pete Moody let
an attempted cut-off throw get by
him.
Tom Shaw scored the Indians' sec
ond run when UCLA's centerfielder
Richie Treat dropped Bruce Cam
eron's fly ball with two out. Stanford
put together singles by Charlie Cole
and Tom Shaw, a base on balls, two
stolen bases, and two more Bruin er
rors to score their third run in the
fifth inning.
Stanford picked up what proved to
be the winning run in the seventh
frame. Clegg was hit by a pitched ball
and moved to second on John Clay
pool's sacrifice. Clegg scored on Dick
Cor/.ine's long double to left field.
Bruins Threaten
Trailing, 4 to 1, in their half of the
ninth, UCLA put on a rally that
threatened to wipe out Stanford's
lead. Lead-off man Boyd Jefferies
finally drew a base on balls after foul
ing off half a dozen of Chez's pitches.
Two consecutive singles scored Jef
feries, and put the tying runs on first
and second with nobody out.
A sacrifice and a wild throw to the
plate by Dave Melton put the Bruins
within one run of the Indians. Coach
Dean then called Dave Stott in from
the bull pen and Stott came through
by getting pinch-hitter John Matuiich
!•) pop out and striking out Mike Ga
y.flla to end the game.
Two unearned runs gave Bruin Bob
Andrews the decision over Jack Hei
nen in Friday's tight pitchers' battle,
lleinen gave up only six hits, while
striking out eight, but the Indians
were unable to hit in the clutch, as
they left eight runners stranded on
the base paths.
Kout Cal Poly
Stanford dumped Cal Poly, 9 to 2,
and were shut out. 4 to 0, by the Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara
in warm-up games during the early
part of the week.
Chez was credited with the win
over Cal Poly as he allowed two runs
and five hits while striking out three
in the six innings that he worked.
Stanford pounded two Cal Poly pitch
ers for 12 hits, and the Mustang de
fense aided the Indians' cause by
1 browing the ball all over the park,
while Stanford's base runners kept on
i tinning.
At Santa Barbara, lack of clutch
hitting again led to the Indians'
downfall as they collected nine hits
but could get a man as far as third

Stanford's baseballers jumped into the CIBA pennant race over
the weekend by splitting a two-game series with UCLA on the
Westwood campus. The Indians came back on Saturday afternoon
to down the Bruins, 4 to 3, after losing a heartbreaking, 2 to 1, ball
game the day before in the season's opener.
Sophomore Joe Chez, Coach Everett Dean's surprise starter, held

the Bruins in check lor eight innings
in Saturday's contest as he chalked up
his second win iti as many starts for
the Indian varsity. Chez limited the
lit ii ins to three hits and one unearned
i mi while striking out seven batters
l"i' the first eight stanzas, while his
mates were collecting four runs off
two UCLA chuckers.
The Bruin defense, which had
played flawless ball in the first game,
Ml apart in the Saturday tilt, as they
rommitled nine errors.
Clegg Triples
Stanford pushed across its first run
in the .second frame, when Dick Clegg
led oil' with a triple and scored when
Hi uin second-sacker Pete Moody let
an attempted cut-off throw get by
him.
Tom Shaw scored the Indians' sec
ond run when UCLA's centerfielder
Richie Treat dropped Bruce Cam
eron's fly ball with two out. Stanford
put together singles by Charlie Cole
and Tom Shaw, a base on balls, two
stolen bases, and two more Bruin er
rors to score their third run in the
fifth inning.
Stanford picked up what proved to
be the winning run in the seventh
frame. Clegg was hit by a pitched ball
and moved to second on John Clay
pool's sacrifice. Clegg scored on Dick
Cor/.ine's long double to left field.
Bruins Threaten
Trailing, 4 to 1, in their half of the
ninth, UCLA put on a rally that
threatened to wipe out Stanford's
lead. Lead-off man Boyd Jefferies
finally drew a base on balls after foul
ing off half a dozen of Chez's pitches.
Two consecutive singles scored Jef
feries, and put the tying runs on first
and second with nobody out.
A sacrifice and a wild throw to the
plate by Dave Melton put the Bruins
within one run of the Indians. Coach
Dean then called Dave Stott in from
the bull pen and Stott came through
by getting pinch-hitter John Matuiich
!•) pop out and striking out Mike Ga
y.flla to end the game.
Two unearned runs gave Bruin Bob
Andrews the decision over Jack Hei
nen in Friday's tight pitchers' battle,
lleinen gave up only six hits, while
striking out eight, but the Indians
were unable to hit in the clutch, as
they left eight runners stranded on
the base paths.
Kout Cal Poly
Stanford dumped Cal Poly, 9 to 2,
and were shut out. 4 to 0, by the Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara
in warm-up games during the early
part of the week.
Chez was credited with the win
over Cal Poly as he allowed two runs
and five hits while striking out three
in the six innings that he worked.
Stanford pounded two Cal Poly pitch
ers for 12 hits, and the Mustang de
fense aided the Indians' cause by
1 browing the ball all over the park,
while Stanford's base runners kept on
i tinning.
At Santa Barbara, lack of clutch
hitting again led to the Indians'
downfall as they collected nine hits
but could get a man as far as third
only twice.
Pitchers Come Through
The four-game trip showed that
Stanford's pitching staff will be able
to hold its own with any in the
league. The six Indian hurlers gave
up only five earned runs in the 34
innings pitched.
The only serious injury on the trip

occurred when Jim Castagnoli re
injured his shoulder at Santa Bar
bara. Until the husky catcher's arm
is back in shape, he will be used as a
pinch hitter.

Ml apart in the Saturday tilt, as they
rommitled nine errors.
Clegg Triples
Stanford pushed across its first run
in the .second frame, when Dick Clegg
led oil' with a triple and scored when
Hi uin second-sacker Pete Moody let
an attempted cut-off throw get by
him.
Tom Shaw scored the Indians' sec
ond run when UCLA's centerfielder
Richie Treat dropped Bruce Cam
eron's fly ball with two out. Stanford
put together singles by Charlie Cole
and Tom Shaw, a base on balls, two
stolen bases, and two more Bruin er
rors to score their third run in the
fifth inning.
Stanford picked up what proved to
be the winning run in the seventh
frame. Clegg was hit by a pitched ball
and moved to second on John Clay
pool's sacrifice. Clegg scored on Dick
Cor/.ine's long double to left field.
Bruins Threaten
Trailing, 4 to 1, in their half of the
ninth, UCLA put on a rally that
threatened to wipe out Stanford's
lead. Lead-off man Boyd Jefferies
finally drew a base on balls after foul
ing off half a dozen of Chez's pitches.
Two consecutive singles scored Jef
feries, and put the tying runs on first
and second with nobody out.
A sacrifice and a wild throw to the
plate by Dave Melton put the Bruins
within one run of the Indians. Coach
Dean then called Dave Stott in from
the bull pen and Stott came through
by getting pinch-hitter John Matuiich
!•) pop out and striking out Mike Ga
y.flla to end the game.
Two unearned runs gave Bruin Bob
Andrews the decision over Jack Hei
nen in Friday's tight pitchers' battle,
lleinen gave up only six hits, while
striking out eight, but the Indians
were unable to hit in the clutch, as
they left eight runners stranded on
the base paths.
Kout Cal Poly
Stanford dumped Cal Poly, 9 to 2,
and were shut out. 4 to 0, by the Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara
in warm-up games during the early
part of the week.
Chez was credited with the win
over Cal Poly as he allowed two runs
and five hits while striking out three
in the six innings that he worked.
Stanford pounded two Cal Poly pitch
ers for 12 hits, and the Mustang de
fense aided the Indians' cause by
1 browing the ball all over the park,
while Stanford's base runners kept on
i tinning.
At Santa Barbara, lack of clutch
hitting again led to the Indians'
downfall as they collected nine hits
but could get a man as far as third
only twice.
Pitchers Come Through
The four-game trip showed that
Stanford's pitching staff will be able
to hold its own with any in the
league. The six Indian hurlers gave
up only five earned runs in the 34
innings pitched.
The only serious injury on the trip

occurred when Jim Castagnoli re
injured his shoulder at Santa Bar
bara. Until the husky catcher's arm
is back in shape, he will be used as a
pinch hitter.
