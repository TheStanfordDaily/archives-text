Six million electric
ranges. 37 million radios.
21) million electric clocks.
27 million electric refrig
erators. 17 million elec
tric coffee makers. 211

million toasters ... Thirty yearn ago, they were
just a sparkle in someone's eye.
Facts like that should hearten you, when
you wonder about your future in American
industry. The opportunity's there—as it was
t here for Alcoa in the early days of electrical
transmission.
Today, nearly half the high-tension lines
that feed those appliances are made of Alcoa
Aluminum. Nearly two million miles of
ACSII (aluminum cable steel reinforced).
All hough it was light, and corrosion resistant,
and conductive, nobody wanted to make
aluminum into cable, at the beginning. All

right, we said —we'd do it. We launched a
long research project to produce purer metal,
and made the basic changes in our reduction
processes that the research finally indicated.
We built a cable-testing laboratory long
enough to mount whole spans of cable, and
vibrate them as the wind does, to check
fatigue strength. This was hard, discouraging
work, and it took most of the lifetimes of a
good many Alcoa people.
But today aluminum high-lines cross the
Great Bear in Canada, and funnel Grand
Coulee's power into millions of homes and
factories. We think they stand as a pretty
good monument to this country's way of
doing things, through research persever
ance, stockholders' courage, and employees'
hard work. Aluminum Company of
