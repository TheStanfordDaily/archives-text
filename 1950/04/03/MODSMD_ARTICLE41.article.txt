# Card Tracksters Whip Olympic Club
## Gay Bryan Will Miss S.C. Meet 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Having breezed by their first two
cinder opponents, Cal and the Olym
pic Club, Stanford's undefeated track
team is looking ahead toward their
| crucial meet with USC Saturday in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford's chances for breaking
| USC's long victory string took a turn
for the worse last weekend, when it
1 was learned definitely the Gay Bryan
would be out of the Trojan fracas.
Bryan came up with a knee injury
while broad jumping in the Big Meet
Relays a week ago. It first appeared
to be only a slight injury, but upon
later examination, it was decided
; that the Card ace would be out for at
i least two weeks.
Double Workouts
However, the rest of the team has
been quickly rounding into shape. [
Double workouts were the order of
i the clay last week, and Coach Jack
Weiershauser expects the team to be
ready lor the Trojan horde.
Bud Held, who is improving every
week, threw the javelin only a foot
short of Bob Peoples' all-time NCAA
1 record Saturday, when he turned in a
233 ft. 41/2 in. toss.
A week before, Held set a California
I Stadium record with a 232-ft. throw,
j which landed more than halfway
across the Edwards Field track.
Bob Bryan turned in a sparkling
performance against the Olympic
Club Saturday, which included a
i 23.7-second low hurdle victory, a 21.8
220 win, and a close second to Ron
nie Buck's 9.8 hundred.
Kreitz a Close Second
Darrell Kreitz showed his 1948 hur
dle form when he lost by inches to
his old competitor Downing McKee in
the good time of 14.4.
Pitch Johnson looked very strong
Saturday as he coasted to a 49.2 vic
i tory in the quarter mile. Veteran
I Cass Bly came in only two yards be
hind Johnson.
But perhaps the biggest surprise in
the quarter mile last Saturday was
Wilbur Taylor's close third place. It
was Taylor's first competitive 440, and
his unofficial 49.G mark may have
earned him a spot on Stanford's crack
mile relay team.
The Indians' No. 1 quarter miler,
| Larry Hoft', still is on the injury list
with a foot injury.
Shotputters Lew Davis and Otis
Chandler both hit over 54 feet against
the Olympic Club. Previously Stan
ford's ace shotput quartet set the Big

Meet Relay record with a combined
total of 201 ft. :! /s in.
Campbell Hits 13 Ft. (! In.
Don Campbell, Stanford's one and
only hope in the pole vault, sailed
over the bar at 13 ft. 6 in., and then
barely missed at 13 ft. 9 in., equalling
his all-time best mark.
