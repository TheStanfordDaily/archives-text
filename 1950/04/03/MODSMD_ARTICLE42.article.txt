### 
STATE COLLEGE. Pa.. April 2 (/Pi
â€”The Eastern "bloc" in the college
boxing field threatened facetiously to
bar the Western teams from the
NCAA Tournament today in the wake
of the April Fool joke perpetrated on
them by the teams from the West
Coast.
All the Westerners did was to es
tablish first Louisiana State and
Michigan State as favorites. Then
they walked off with almost all the
laurels themselves.

Gonzaga and Idaho, rated as "dark
horse" teams with barely a chance to
figure in the scoring, tied for the team
championship with 18 points each.
They took two individual titles apiece,
San Jose State and Washington State
each took one, leaving only two to be
divided between the East and South
Michigan State, which sent three
boxers into Saturday's finals, didn't
win a single championship, finishing
third with 13 points scored in earliei
rounds.
