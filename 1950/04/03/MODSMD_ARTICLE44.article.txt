# Seniors Plan 1950 Ferryboat Dance
## 
### 
The senior class is planning its
annual ferryboat dance for April 15.
The dance is open to the entire
campus, but since a limited number
of tickets will be available, seniors
are urged to buy theirs as soon as
possible. Tickets will go on sale at
$5 a couple at the ASSU office this
week.
