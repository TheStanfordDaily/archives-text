# Survey Shows Less Demand For Engineers
## 
### 
A 30 per cent drop in jobs for en
gineering graduates this year has
been predicted from the results of
a study conducted by a committee
of the American Society of Civil
Engineers.
Reporting organizations in the
survey included 144 industrial com
panies, 23 government and state
agencies, and 64 engineering
schools, which are currently em
ploying 91,400 engineering gradu
ates.
A decrease of 28 per cent in em
ployment by industrial companies
and of 33 per cent by government
agencies is indicated by the survey.
Engineering colleges, polled con
cerning teaching and research posi
tions available, report a probable
drop of 44 per cent. The smallest
expected decrease is in the field of
chemical engineering, where the
average drop is estimated at 5 per
cent.
Average starting salaries of $255
a month for graduates with A.B.
degrees are about the same as last
year, with chemical and petroleum
companies offering the highest sal
aries. Graduates with M.A. degrees
may expect an average of $320, and
those with engineering doctorates,
$445.
Teachers and researchers with
doctors' degrees hired by colleges
will average about 300.
