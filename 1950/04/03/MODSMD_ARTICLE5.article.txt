KEKKI'XEY â€” Twenty-eight days
away from the deadline of an order
to sign a non-Communist oath or
quit, some University of California
faculty members gave every indi
cation today of intent to keep on

There was even campus talk
among members of possibly going to
the courts to challenge the legality
of the Board of Regents' order that
the special oath be appended to the
regular consttiutional oath.
