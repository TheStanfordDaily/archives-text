# Cancer Fund Drive Opens; Brandin Heads Campaign
## Goal for Stanford, Palo Alto Is $5,000 
### 
Alf E. Brandin, business manager
of Stanford University, will head the
educational and fund-raising drive
of the American Cancer Society
which will be carried on locally
during the month of April.
The campaign, with a quota of
$5,000 —one-fifth of the county total
of $25,000 — will be carried out
through letter solicitation and by
means of collection boxes in busi
ness establishments of co-operating
merchants in Palo Alto and in resi
dence units on the campus.
Brandin announced the following
other committee chairmen for the
local drive: Manuel Piers, Palo Alto
business district; James Mack and
Carl Bledsoe, South Palo Alto busi
ness district; Mrs. Carl B. Spaeth,
special donors; School Superin
tendent Albert M. Davis, schools;
Miss Christine Ricker and William
Gunther, Stanford campus; and
Frederic O. Glover, publicity.
Collection Boxes
Piers Dairy trucks have already
picked up collection boxes from the
county headquarters of the Ameri
can Cancer Society in San Jose, and
the boxes and posters will be dis
tributed to local merchants in the
next few days.
Brandin pointed out that contin
ued progress in cancer control de
pends directly on success of the 1950
Cancer Crusade, which will have
$14,505,000 as the minimum national
goal.
"This is the smallest amount
needed to carry on the broad re
search, education, and service pro
gram undertaken by the Society,
the local chairman said.
Progress Made
He pointed out that progress has
already been made in three direc
tions: (1) the building of a nation
wide machine for cancer control;
(2) the greatest peacetime research
effort in history; and (3) an educa
tional program to alert people to
cancer in its early stages when it
is most easily cured.
"Besides the American Cancer
Society unit here," the chairman
said, "the society has active local
units in more than 2,000 other
counties throughout the United
States. To be most effective, wc
must try to reach all the people.
"From 1945 to 1949, ASC raised
by public subscription about $53,-
000,000, compared with only $2,000,-
000 given by the public during the
previous five years.
For Research
"Twenty-five per cent of this
money has been spent for research
nationally. Another 15 per cent was
spent on national programs of pro
fessional education, public educa
tion, information, and campaigns;
professional and lay service to the
cancer patient; statistical research;
field service and administration.
"The other 60 per cent is retained
by the 61 state and metropolitan di
visions of the society. That is the
money that is spent locally in towns
and cities such as this for cancer
control work."
