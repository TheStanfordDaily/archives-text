# Terman Given $11,000 Grants
## 
### 
Two grants of $11,000 each from
the Carnegie Corporation and the
Rockefeller Foundation have been
made to Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford emeritus professor of psy
chology, for follow-up work on his
29-year study of gifted children.
The grants will provide for field
work to be done by three psycholo
gists who will visit the original
group, interview and retcst both
husbands and wives, and test their
children.
Dr. Terman, who is world famous
not only for this project but for his
pioneer work in the field of "IQ"
tests and his surveys of marital
happiness, will be assisted by Mrs.
Melita Owen and Babettc Bailey
Doyle, both of Stanfox*d University.
Approximi*tcly 1,000 of the 1,450
gifted children originally tested live
in California. All the subjects were
in the top one per cent of the popu
lation IQ when the study began in
1921.
Most of the subjects arc now be
tween 35 and 46 years of age, the
average being close to 40.
Dr. Terman has hopes that the
study will continue for another 20
or 30 years in order that it may
provide a decisive answer to such
questions as how gifted children
turn out, what factors influence
their development, and what kind
of education they should have.
The current year's work is being
carried on under a $5,500 Carnegie
award which is being used to pre
pare methods for next year's work,
including a revision of Dr. Ter
man's concept mastery test, to make
it suitable' for testing the subjects
periodically until old age.
