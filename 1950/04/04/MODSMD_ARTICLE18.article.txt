# Registration Lags Behind Spring, 1949
## 
### 
Spring quarter classes will begin
this morning with 0,704 students
registered.
The enrollment figure, announced
last night by Dr. H. Donald Winbig
ler, University registrar, is expected
to be swelled to more than 7,000 by
late registrants.
Last night's total is 515 less than
at the end of the first day of regis
tration last spring and is 1,096 bo
low the registration figure of 7,800
for winter quarter.
The 3-to-l ratio held its own yes
terday with 5,0152 men and i,072
women registered by 5 p.m.
Earlier, Dr. Winbigler had pre
dicted a total enrollment of around
7,500, a drop of 300 from last quar
ter.
'Of course a lower registration is
normal,' said Dr. Winbigler. "There
is always a greater enrollment drop
from winter to spring quarter than
from fall to winter quarter."
Slump Explained
Part of the slump is explained
l>,y winter quarter graduations, said
the registrar. Many students, es
pecially in the Graduate School of
Business, accelerate their studies by
attending a summer session and arc
graduated early.
Moreover, the gap will not be
filled by new enrollments. Dr. Win
bigler expected around 150 new stu
dents this quarter.
A gradually dropping enrollment
is in line with University policy,
which favors shaving down the reg
istration figure from its peak of
8,."!50 in full quarter, 1948, Dr. Win
bigler said.
Veterans' Enrollment
Dr. George D. Barahal, director
of the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter and Veterans' Go-ordinator,
"guessed" Sunday that veterans'
enrollment would fall to about 2,950,
or about 200 less than last quarter.
Tliis figure is well below veteran
enrollment a year ago, when 48 per
cent of the student body were
World War II veterans.
A $2 fee will be charged for late
registration.
