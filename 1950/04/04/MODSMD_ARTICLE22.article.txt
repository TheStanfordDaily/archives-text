# Stanford Research Institute Study of Chlorella May Lead To Methods of Increasing Food Production One Hundred Fold
## 
### DEAN HOLMAN 
Stanford Research Institute sei- |
I enlists are currently studying a
method of food production which is
| nearly ten times as efficient as ordi
nary farming in the utilization of
| sunlight, and yields more than a
! hundred times as much food per
| area involved.
By means of controlled photo
synthesis in the large-scale culture
J of one of the simplest unicellular
j organisms, a common green alga
called Cldorclla pyrcnoidosa, SRI
! expects to develop a source of low
cost, highly nutritious food which |
may serve to feed the world's hun
| gry population.
The study was begun at Stanford
j eight years ago when Dr. H. A.
Spochr and Dr. H. W. Milner
j showed that the chemical composi-
I tion of Chlorclla can be altered by
j changing the environmental condi
tions under which it is grown. By
| growing it in a culture medium of
j fixed nitrogen content above .001
| molar, Chlorclla were produced
with a protein content of over 50
per cent, or almost three times as j
rich in protein as any ordinary ag- j
; ricultural plant.
On the other hand, if it is grown ;
: in a medium containing 'ess t.har
that amount, the algae stop rcpro-
I ducing and synthesize lipid, or fat.
up to 85 per cent of their dry
; weight. It can thus provide a
| source of oils.
Practical Application
In November l!) 48. the Research ;
j Corporation engaged the Stanford
j Research Institute to make a sur
vey of these findings, to determine
J the optimum conditions for growth, j

j and consider the possibility of a
large-scale production process.
To become familiar with the
! problems of growing algae, and to
j maintain accurate control of all var
iables, a four-inch pyrcx glass cul
ture column six feet in height v/as
constructed. Illuminated with three
100-watt fluorescent lights, piovi
sions were made to control temper
ature, aeration, volume, and popu
lation density.
To obtain inform ttion on sun
light, a similar device was erected
on the laboratory roof with a pivot
arrangement so as to operate it at
any angle to the sun.
j A line of smaller "batch" cultures
I was constructed to study the ef-
I fccts of variations of other factors
, including kinds of water, nutrients
from other chemicals, effects of
contamination, and the re-use of
spent medium.
Rooftop Farm
On the basis of the results ob
tained from the culture column ex
periments, SHI has recently set up
its "rooftop experimental farm"
which is designed to obtain maxi
mum production of Chlorclla from
j sunlight on a large scale.
The rooftop experimental farm
consists of four horizontal culture
; tanks, four feet wide, ten feet long,
J and six inches deep. They are
maintained under constant condi
tions in the same manner as the
culture column.
Protein Yield
If the Institute's experimental
j method can be applied full scale, it
J will offer an astounding yield of
I protein food — more than 50,000
I pounds of protein per acre per year,
j This is contrasted with the best ree-
I ord of ordinary farming of soy

| beans at 500 pounds, and a good
I wheat crop which produces about
j 200 pounds.
Cost figures for the now Chlorclla
food arc not yet available, but are
|
j bc'icvcd to be less than twicc as
I high as for other protein foods, with
i possibilities of reduction as mcth
j ods improve.
Preliminary experiments arc be
ing made with Chlorclla as a sole
i source of protein for rats, and soon
i experiments will be run with
chickens. Although the initial out
look is that Chlorclla will be used
main'y as a feed for livestock, there
is no apparent reason why it can
not be used directly for human
food, especially for those who have
a fancy for the taste of dehydrated
j spinach.

maintained under constant condi
tions in the same manner as the

j method can be applied full scale, it
J will offer an astounding yield of
I protein food — more than 50,000
I pounds of protein per acre per year,

I high as for other protein foods, with
i possibilities of reduction as mcth

Preliminary experiments arc be
ing made with Chlorclla as a sole
i source of protein for rats, and soon
i experiments will be run with
chickens. Although the initial out
look is that Chlorclla will be used
main'y as a feed for livestock, there
is no apparent reason why it can

food, especially for those who have
a fancy for the taste of dehydrated
j spinach.
