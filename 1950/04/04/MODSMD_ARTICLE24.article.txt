# Navy Hunting Mysterious Sub
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 3 (AP)— A naval officer returned today
from a submarine hunt off the northern California coast and said he
believed he had made instrument contact with one or more uniden
tified underseas boats about 17 miles offshore.
Officially, the Western Sea Frontier, which ordered the hunt,
. ♦said:

"Results and comment, negative "
' It added the .search had been discon
tinued "pending further develop-
I ments."
But Capt. J. A. Holbrook, a former
; submarine officer who commanded
i the destroyer USS Colahan on the
; search, said:
"It, is my opinion, as a submarine
officer, that we probably had contact.
I with one or more submarines in the
| area."
Rear Admiral F. I. Entwistle, after
I studying Captain Holbrook's report,
| said the contacts made by the Cola
ban "very probably" were one or
more foreign submarines on routine
peacetime patrols.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, au
thorities were baffled by the mys
terious disappearance at sea of a man
who wrote that he lived in constant
dread of deportation after a wartime
conviction for treason.
Found at sea, empty save for a
suitcase of clothing, was the 18-fooi
motorboat a man giving the name of
Theodore Donay of Detroit rented at
Avalon, Catalma Island, Saturday.
| Donay was the first man in United
1 State history to be convicted of mis-
I prision (concealment) of treason.
A note saying "the outlook for my
i future is very dark" and "goodbye to
1 my good friends" and signed Theo
-1 dore Donay" was found in the missing
| man's Avalon hotel room at about the
time the navy reported an unidenti
j fied submarine had been reported
i sighted off the southern California
coast.
Officials said they have been unable
to determine whether there is any
link between the two occurrences.
Yesterday navy planes made an all
day search north of Santa Barbara,
after Coast Guardsmen reported see
ing a surfaced submarine at 6:20 a.m.
