# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HAL 
I don't talk with profs after class.
I don't recite until I'm called on.
I don't ask questions in class.
I don't speak to the profs in the halls.
I don't write a book when I can answer a question

in four sentences.
I don't make- excuses when I'm
absent.
I don't laugh at the profs' jokes
unless they're funny.
I'm on probation!
But, like they say, you can't win
em all. What the hell, the sun is
out registration day is over, no'
Flying Saucers have attacked
Stanford yet, Duncan Hines has
approved the meals at the Phi Delt
House, Tanforan is open, and ac-

cording to the calendar, we're already two weeks into
that thing called spring.
So, I had just talked myself into whistling again
when I ran into Charlie. Now, Charlie is usually a
pretty good boy, except 1 can't see talking to Mon
golian Idiots, and the hole in Charlie's hea<l i.s really
something to see. But he cornered me.
"How'd the grades came out?" says Charlie just like
an old friend
"Not so hot," I said more realistically than modestly.
I tried to walk past him with just a nod, but he grabbed
me by the throat and leered into my paling pinks.
"I went plus 20," he spit in my face. "Two ayes, a
bee, and a cee."
"That's nice," I lied.
"Yep, plus 20. And geez, I hardly cracked a book.

Eut that's the way il goes, 1 guess."
"Yeah, that':; the way it goes," I echoed. I hied
again to move past, but tie wasn't finished and started
twisting my arm.
"Whatta week. (Jot tired of Bal after the first day,
.so 1 hit Yosemite, but no girls. Took off for Sun Val
ley, and that was pretty fair. But, things didn't get
hot until . . ."
"Yeah, yeah' I broke in "Tell me, Charlie. Tell
me."
"Until we met a couple girls," lie finished "Geez,
what a good deal. 1 had a nice old fashioned girl. Yep.
In tact, she guzzled down a do/< ii old lashioneds on
the lir.st date."
"Hah-Hah," J managed. "You ought to write Bull
Session." All the time I wanted to smash him in the
face. Here he was talking to a guy who had gotten as
far south as San Jose, and as far north as Burlingamts
And then he has the guts to choke me up with a cheap
joke that was the rage when I was first learning my
multiplication tables.
Then, he loosened his grip as a peasant blouse
strolled by, and I escaped.
"See ya," I said, as I put fifty yards between us.
Cursing my luck, I walked past the chance to pay
5)2.40 to see smiling Jack Fina, and walked into much
bigger things.
Well, that's Refj Day. You gotta take the good with
the bad. It's nice seeing the old faces, and it's great
seeing the nice ones. But, a little bit of Charlie will
go a long way.
However, as the man said as he turned on the gas:
"It's all over now." Keg Day, thai is See you at the
Li be.
This time I'm going plus 20.

I'm on probation!

Flying Saucers have attacked
Stanford yet, Duncan Hines has
approved the meals at the Phi Delt
House, Tanforan is open, and ac-

cording to the calendar, we're already two weeks into
that thing called spring.
So, I had just talked myself into whistling again
when I ran into Charlie. Now, Charlie is usually a
pretty good boy, except 1 can't see talking to Mon
golian Idiots, and the hole in Charlie's hea<l i.s really
something to see. But he cornered me.
"How'd the grades came out?" says Charlie just like
an old friend
"Not so hot," I said more realistically than modestly.
I tried to walk past him with just a nod, but he grabbed
me by the throat and leered into my paling pinks.
"I went plus 20," he spit in my face. "Two ayes, a
bee, and a cee."
"That's nice," I lied.
"Yep, plus 20. And geez, I hardly cracked a book.

Eut that's the way il goes, 1 guess."
"Yeah, that':; the way it goes," I echoed. I hied
again to move past, but tie wasn't finished and started
twisting my arm.
"Whatta week. (Jot tired of Bal after the first day,
.so 1 hit Yosemite, but no girls. Took off for Sun Val
ley, and that was pretty fair. But, things didn't get
hot until . . ."
"Yeah, yeah' I broke in "Tell me, Charlie. Tell
me."
"Until we met a couple girls," lie finished "Geez,
what a good deal. 1 had a nice old fashioned girl. Yep.
In tact, she guzzled down a do/< ii old lashioneds on
the lir.st date."
"Hah-Hah," J managed. "You ought to write Bull
Session." All the time I wanted to smash him in the
face. Here he was talking to a guy who had gotten as
far south as San Jose, and as far north as Burlingamts
And then he has the guts to choke me up with a cheap
joke that was the rage when I was first learning my
multiplication tables.
Then, he loosened his grip as a peasant blouse
strolled by, and I escaped.
"See ya," I said, as I put fifty yards between us.
Cursing my luck, I walked past the chance to pay
5)2.40 to see smiling Jack Fina, and walked into much
bigger things.
Well, that's Refj Day. You gotta take the good with
the bad. It's nice seeing the old faces, and it's great
seeing the nice ones. But, a little bit of Charlie will
go a long way.
However, as the man said as he turned on the gas:
"It's all over now." Keg Day, thai is See you at the
Li be.
This time I'm going plus 20.

I don't talk with profs after class.
I don't recite until I'm called on.
I don't ask questions in class.
I don't speak to the profs in the halls.
I don't write a book when I can answer a question

in four sentences.
