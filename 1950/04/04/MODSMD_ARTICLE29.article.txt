To the Editor:
Why was it necessary for the Excom to appropriate
$250 to send two representatives to the forthcoming
national AWS Convention when one could have done a
very adequate job? Isn't this another "good deal"
which our beneficent governing body is offering an
other fortunate individual? 11 this sort of action is to
continue, shouldn't we stai t a school lottery su every
one will have equal opportunity to share in this
largess''
