Here it is, the first week of spring quarter, and the real "Big Meet" is upon
us. I speak of the Stanford-USC get-together that takes place in L.A. Sat
urday; not the overshadowed Cal-Stanford meet.
At the end of spring quarter last year, we of the Farm thought the chance
of beating the mighty Trojan in 1950 very slim. Came the announcement
that Gay Bryan would have another year of eligibility, we thought rather
well of our chances.
Tlit'ii came last week's announcement that the Gaylord would be out
of competition "until after the IJSC meet." Black gloom settled over the
campus once again.
Black glodm settled everywhere but in and about the track team, that is.
Those fellows will stick to the thought that El Troje will the Cards
for the first time since 1933. (The Bears haven't beaten USC since 1931.)
Be durned if I too, don't think there is a chance. A chance, mind you, just
a chance. You don't lose a three-time national champ, and a great athlete
to boot, and beat the likes of USC on regular performances.
Year after year we have seen the Trojans come up with a superbly
well-rounded team; a team with great depth to back up national cham
pions.
But the Gaylord is gone, and with him goes about 13 near-sure points.
Year after year it has been USC men who have come from "nowhere" to
mark up a personal all-time high mark. Bob Pruitt came up with a sizzling
mile last year to upset pre-meet dope sheets. The story has been the same
each and every year.
II Stanford is to win Saturday's meet, it will be because guys like Ron
nie Allen, Dave Dunlap, Fred Fank, Merrill Van Sant, Scott Golds
borough, and Don Campbell coimfthrough.
Bob Bryan, now winning a track name of his own, rather than performing
in the shadow of his older brother, could surprise one and all. Wilbur Tay
lor, who will probably turn out to be the best quarter-miler on a team with
excellent 440 men, will probably be a three-event man also.
Back of this is a story that has not hit print. It is a story of men when, if
performing now, might well turn the result in favor of the Cards. Check
'cm off—George Mooers, Drew Terramorse, Skip Kent. Warren Ward, Larry
IloH', John Kaufman. That is but a partial list of men who are sidelined for
this meet or out for the year because of injuries and other reasons. Ward
was the National Junior College two-mile champ in 1948. He and Kaufman
would add greatly to the thin distance staff at Coach Weiershauser's disposal.
In any other sport these injuries and layoffs would draw headlines in
every paper in the Bay Area. But this is track and most of the City
writers just don't even know most of these boys are eveil in school, let
alone out of competition.
So, a tip of the hat to Weiershauser. One might expect any coach with
such a list of out-of-action men to be walking toward the Golden Gate
Bridge with a .45 in one hand and a vial of cyanide in the other.
Remember, this was to be The Great Year in track. We were meeting
USC early, before they are usually at top peak. We had Irtst only two men
from last year's team. Every track coach's dream was near—a real
chance to beat USC.
And the strange part about it is that feat can still be accomplished; but
only with the very best that each and every man can give. It is a great
challenge to the men of the Cardinal.
CATCH UP DEPARTMENT—FootbaII practice starts on Monday, next.
Missing will be Wilbur Taylor, Tom Shaw, Harry Hugasian, and Chuck Ho
kanson. Other sports will claim the attention of these men Phil
Bengtson traveled to the U. of Minnesota to be interviewed for the Director
of Athletics job. He is still in the running but now it seems that Bernie
Bierman has changed his mind and wants the job. Pressure has been put on
Bierman, and now he would like to step upstairs The Theta Delts are
the intramural basketball champs. They beat out the SAE's for the title.
r l his writer takes a bow, as he picked these two outfits to meet in the finals.
. . . . Dinah's and L'Otnmie's met again on the B-ball floor in the San Jose
tournament. This time it was for the title and the Frenchmen won
L;.st year's track team averaged pretty close to plus 15 during spring quarter.
Can any other Farm team match this?
Bud Ileld's javelin toss in the Cal-Stanford Relays would have reached
to 230 ft. (i in. if it had been measured as the AAU and the different relay
meets are taped off, i.e., from a curved circle and not from a point paral
lel to the straight line used in college meets. The present college mark
is 234 ft. 2 1 1 in Softball pitchers have been moved back three
feet. The move is supposed to give the batters more of a chance.
Re Bud Held again, the national javelin champ carried 26 units in engi
neering physics!! .... Re-Re Bud Held—the 40-foot-iong rectangle for
javelin tossers wasn't touched last Saturday. All other tossers hit below
the 180-foot mark and Hel hit well over the 220-foot end mark Ralph
Sala is now the national 440 swim champ. He missed Bill Smith's record by
,l> of one second. He beat his arch rival, USC's Wally Wolf, by a big margin.
He went on to place second in the 1500-yard race and fourth in the 220.
Pete Cole added a third in the 1500, to give the Cards sixth place in national
(NCAA) standing. Good going, Tom Haynie and boys.
Watch for important changes in the athletic set-up as a result of yester
day's BAC meeting. Can't tell now, besides, the Board of Trustees must
approve.
