## Bears, Gaels Lead CIBA Horsehiders. 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Two dark-horse candidates, Cali
fornia and St. Mary's," lead the pack
as the CIBA swings into its third
week of play. Cal has knocked oft'
St. Mary's and Santa Clara in their
only two league starts of the season,
while St. Mary's dumped Santa
Clara once and handed UCLA a
double drubbing before dropping
their game to Cal.
Cal took both their games yester
day by one run on the strength ol
late-inning rallies. The Bear pitch
ing staff gave up twenty base hits
for the two games and were saved
only by some timely clutch hitting
by their teammates. Whether or
not the Bears will be able to main
tain the pace for the remainder of
the season is a big question point.
Gaels Have Pitchers
Johnny Vergez has come up with
a handful of surprises in pushing bis
Gaels into second place. A strong
veteran pitching staff headed by
Carrol Canfield and a group of hus
tling sophomores have made a defi
nite threat to walk off with the pen
nant this year.
USC. last year's champs and pre
season favorites to repeat this year,
are resting in the cellar after drop
ping their two opening games to
Santa Clara.
USC. however, is still a definite
power to reckon with and will be
in the race down to the wire. Last
year the Trojans lost their first two
league encounters to Santa Clara
and went on from there to win the
13 remaining games of league play.
Cards Show Promise
Stanford, Santa Clara, and UCLA
are still question marks. The In
dian pitching staff showed promise
of being one of the strongest in the
league with its performance during
last week's four-game trip south.
However, lack of clutch hitting cost
the Indians several runs as they
left 40 men on base in the four
games.
To date UCLA has not had the
punch at the plate to carry them
along with the rest of the league.
Stanford will make a decided bid
for the top rung of the CIBA lad
der this week when they journey to
Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon
and to Berkeley Saturday after
noon.
