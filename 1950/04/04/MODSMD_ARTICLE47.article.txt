## 
### AL BERRY 
Alter nearly a month of keeping
it an "off-the-record open secret,"
the word is at last official. Tall,
pleasant, eager Bob Ghilotti, once
a good end on a poor football team
at Stanford, will replace Chuck

Taylor as freshman football coach, j
Taylor will join the San Francisco
'49ers as head line coach in June
of this year, but will remain on the
Farm until then helping with spring
football practice and showing the
new frosh coach the finer points of j
the job.
Ghilotti was a three-sport letter
man while at Stanford, competing in
track, basketball, and football. He
received his A.B. degree in physical
education in December 1948 and |
earned his Master's degree last De- j

cember. Bob was freshman line
coach, assisting Taylor, on last
year's undefeated yearling eleven.
"Bob was a fine choice," said
Taylor in a special Daily interview.
"He did an outstanding job for me
last year with the frosh, and 1 think
that he is one of the most outstand
ing coaching prospects to come out
of Stanford since the war. I was
very happy to see him Â»et the job."
The genial new coach had a quote
of his own: "I'm very happy at be
ing appointed and I certainly ap
preciate the opportunity and chal
lenge of such a position. I realize
that it is almost impossible to re
place Chuck Taylor as a coach but
someone has to try to step into his
shoes. I know that it will take a
great deal ol work to do the job
that Chuck did so ably and I'm go
ing to devote all my time to that
task. I'm glad that I will have at
least until June to work with Chuck
and get the feel of the job."
Ghilotti graduated from Modesto
High School in 1941 after winning
nine athletic letters. He went to
Modesto JC for two years and is one
ol seven athletes in that institution's
hall of tame. He was an all-con
ference end both in high school and
JC.
He spent three years in the Army
Medical Corps in Wor!d War II and
played one season of service foot
ball with the Daniel Field Flyers,
Augusta, Georgia.
The 27-year-old coach played end
on the 1947 and 1948 Stanford foot
ball team?; and was outstanding in
the near-upset Big Games of those
