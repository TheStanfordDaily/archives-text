AWS President Diane Porter anil
nc w AWS member Mary Desmond !
loft Sunday for Norman, Okla., to
t' onrl the annual Intercollegiate;
Associated Women Students Con-!

They will return to classes tomor

AWS petitioned to Excom at the
end of Dead Week last, quarter for;
an additional appropriation of $250
from ASSU funds so that a second
fit legate eould be sent. Originally j
one delegate was scheduled to at- [

tend. A written vote of Excom
members during finals week showed
a large majority with only two dis
senting votes.
One delegate was supposed to be
sent to the conference from Stan
ford and $200 was set aside in the
AWS budget for that purpose.
However, AWS Cabinet felt that it
would be better to have both in
outgoing and an incoming AWS
memb'.r go, as the former could re
port on Stanford's affairs, and the
latter could use the information for
next year's program.
