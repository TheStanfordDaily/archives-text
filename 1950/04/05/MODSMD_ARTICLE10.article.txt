# Roble Fire Repairs Start
## 
### 
I Repairs are well under way on
j fire damages in Roble Hall and
should be completed in about, a
week, said Carroll Blacker, supcr
-1 intendent of buildings and grounds.
Twice in the early morning of
Friday, March JO, coeds scurried
through Ruble exits, awakened by
' tire alarms. The two blazes, one at
! 12:45 a.m. in Wing 3A and the scc
' ond at 4:20 a.m. in Wing 2C, appar
ently both originated in garbage
cans in janitors' closets ofT the main
halls.
Close to $4,000 worth of "super
, lieial damage" was done, estimated
! Blacker. "Most of the damage was
from smoke," he explained. "If the
building had had no roof, the smoke
would have risen and there would
have been little damage. As it was,
smoke traveled all the way down
the halls and the walls and ceilings
in both hallways were dirtied."
Corporation Yard workmen be
gan repairs the day after the fires,
washing and repairing walls and
replacing some woodwork.
"The Roble girls made a fast, or
derly exit," said John Marston, fire
I chief.
Roble is a safe structure, Marston
| said. It is built of reinforced enn
i crete.
