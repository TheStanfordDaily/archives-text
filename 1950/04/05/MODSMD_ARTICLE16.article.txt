tured speaker at a dinner given in
Union dining hall last night com
memorating the 40th anniversary of
the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce.
Dr. Sterling's speech, entitled "A
Century in Retrospect," dealt with
the progress made by humanity in
general from the time when Cali
fornia gained statehood in 1850 to
the present day. Drawing from his
wealth of historical knowledge, Dr.
Sterling outlined trends in the past
and pointed out their significance
for the future.
Concluding his speech, Stanford's
president explained, "The gains
have been preponderantly material
gains. But these have not been ac
companied by moral gains of corre
sponding magnitude.
"Man has learned to take the
measure of many physical things,
but he still struggles to take his
own spiritual measure and that of
the society to which he belongs.
There is much for all of us to do
as wc in California stand on the

threshold of the next hundred
years."
