Enlightened Opinion
Recently returned from an cx-
I tensive tour of eastern Asia, the
I speaker recommended a more en
lightened American public opinion
on Asia based on anthropological,
.sociological, and psychological fac
tors as well as those of political sci
ence, economies, and history.
He said that, a folk society is gen
erally prevalent and that, such a
| social order gives little encourage
i mcnt to the use of new techniques
of production and government.
Thus the need for an extensive
| study of the more human and un
derlying aspects of 111 esituation.
Dr. Fisher recommended a five
point program of assistance which
I he explained would "not. be ehar
: ity but a human and practical policy
to aid peacc and freedom—a pro
i gram based on fredom, not political
power."
Included in the program was the
aim to bring about an end to im
perialism through education, insti
tutions not too different from the
existing folk society order, a break
down of the caste system, and in
stallation of our advanced methods
of public health and medical care.

Communist Movement
"We are playing into the hands
of the Communists to give them
credit for the changes taking place,"
i the speaker emphasized. "The Com
j inunist movement is full of factions
i and heresies, and attempts to de
; stroy the heritage of the Asiatic so-
I cial order."
j Dr. Fisher said he thought Asiat
ics respected our technology, expe
rience, and know - how far more
than our political doctrines and ap
| parent "fear" of Communism.
t "Asia needs a positive policy
j aimed at relieving conditions
through a constructive use of our
! capita!, knowledge, and experi
| cncc," he continued.
Enlightened Opinion
Recently returned from an cx-
I tensive tour of eastern Asia, the
I speaker recommended a more en
lightened American public opinion
on Asia based on anthropological,
.sociological, and psychological fac
tors as well as those of political sci
ence, economies, and history.
He said that, a folk society is gen
erally prevalent and that, such a
| social order gives little encourage
i mcnt to the use of new techniques
of production and government.
Thus the need for an extensive
| study of the more human and un
derlying aspects of 111 esituation.
Dr. Fisher recommended a five
point program of assistance which
I he explained would "not. be ehar
: ity but a human and practical policy
to aid peacc and freedom—a pro
i gram based on fredom, not political
power."
Included in the program was the
aim to bring about an end to im
perialism through education, insti
tutions not too different from the
existing folk society order, a break
down of the caste system, and in
stallation of our advanced methods
of public health and medical care.
