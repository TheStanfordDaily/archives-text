# Tarver Grant Still Available
## 
### 
Since only a few have applied for
the Tarver Interfraternity Exchange
Scholarship, a senior fraternity man
interested in applying now will
have a good chance of winning, said
Walt. Varellas, president of Intcr
, fraternity Board of Control.
Deadline for applications is Fri
day. Varellas emphasized that the
grant, which provides a year of for
rign study for a graduating senior
fraternity member, will be worth
about $1,500, the approximate cost
of Stanford tuition and living ex
penses for one year.
Under the scholarship, provided
by Stanford's 24 fraternities, the
winning senior will be given tui
j tion and living expenses for one
j year at a foriegn university. In re
i turn, a student from that university
I will be granted a year of education
at Stanford. For the past few years,
! the exchange has been with Uni
! versify College, London.
Only ono man may apply from
j each fraternity, and no fraternity
! may send a man more than once in
four years.
Graduating fraternity men intcr
j estcd in the scholarship should get
j in touch with Varellas at Theta Chi
at once.
