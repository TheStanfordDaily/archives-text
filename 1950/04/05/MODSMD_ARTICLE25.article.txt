# DAVID WONG:
## Hong Kong Shoeshine Boys Exploited 
### DAVID WONG 
()n a winter's night in I!MK I had
to work Into on an assignment. II
was almost midnight when I handed
I lie night editor my copy and left
Ihc office. The Hong Kong streets
were deserted except for a lew j
stragglers from the theaters. I made
my way to the bus station and ar- j
rived there with about ten minutes j
to spare before the last bus was (hie.
While I was waiting for the bus, a
cheerful - faecd shoeshine hoy ap -
proached me and asked if I wanted
my shoes sliincd. He was barefoot- j
ed and clothed in threadbare gat - j
men Is. He was not more than eight j
years old. Although my shoes were i
not in need of polish. I answered in
the affirmative, for there was some- |
thing about the hoy which inter
ested me.
He maneuvered his battered
shoeshine kit into position and
started to clean my shoes with gus
to. While he deftly applied the pol
ish, I asked him why ho was stil 1
working at such a late hour, for j
shoeshine boys usually stopped j
working after nine o'clock.
"But I don't start work till nine,"
he replied.
Upon pursuing the subject fur
ther, I was informed that he could
not start work earlier because he
i refused to join "the society." Me

■•aid that all shoeshine boys were
required to join a society, to which
they gave a part of their earnings.
Those who joined the society were
not molested, but those who refused
to join were often assaulted. He ex
plainer! that since there was litt'e l
business for shoeshine boys after I
nine in the evening, the members of
the society did not bother him.
While his grimy hands worked on j
my shoes, I began to marvel at that i
little boy who, at such a young age, I
already possessed such qualities of !
courage and determination. Fur- j
ther inquiries on my part revealed !
that his parents were coolies, who j
though hardly making a comfor- I
table living—were earning enough '
to keep him and his two younger
brothers alive.
He then went on to tell mc why j
he needed the money lie earned, j
Like many other children in the |
Orient, he could not afford the lux- i
ury of Attending school. Neverthe
less, he wanted to learn. He knew !
an old vegetable seller who had
some knowledge of written Chinese
and was prepared to teach him what j
he knew. He needed the money for
his books, writing brushes, and oth
er accessories.
When I boarded the bus for home
that night 1 was confident that some

day I would bo able to boast that i
great tnan had once polished my
shoes.

"But I don't start work till nine,"
he replied.
Upon pursuing the subject fur
ther, I was informed that he could
not start work earlier because he
i refused to join "the society." Me

■•aid that all shoeshine boys were
required to join a society, to which
they gave a part of their earnings.
Those who joined the society were
not molested, but those who refused
to join were often assaulted. He ex
plainer! that since there was litt'e l
business for shoeshine boys after I
nine in the evening, the members of
the society did not bother him.
While his grimy hands worked on j
my shoes, I began to marvel at that i
little boy who, at such a young age, I
already possessed such qualities of !
courage and determination. Fur- j
ther inquiries on my part revealed !
that his parents were coolies, who j
though hardly making a comfor- I
table living—were earning enough '
to keep him and his two younger
brothers alive.
He then went on to tell mc why j
he needed the money lie earned, j
Like many other children in the |
Orient, he could not afford the lux- i
ury of Attending school. Neverthe
less, he wanted to learn. He knew !
an old vegetable seller who had
some knowledge of written Chinese
and was prepared to teach him what j
he knew. He needed the money for
his books, writing brushes, and oth
er accessories.
When I boarded the bus for home
that night 1 was confident that some

day I would bo able to boast that i
great tnan had once polished my
shoes.
()n a winter's night in I!MK I had
to work Into on an assignment. II
was almost midnight when I handed
I lie night editor my copy and left
Ihc office. The Hong Kong streets
were deserted except for a lew j
stragglers from the theaters. I made
my way to the bus station and ar- j
rived there with about ten minutes j
to spare before the last bus was (hie.
While I was waiting for the bus, a
cheerful - faecd shoeshine hoy ap -
proached me and asked if I wanted
my shoes sliincd. He was barefoot- j
ed and clothed in threadbare gat - j
men Is. He was not more than eight j
years old. Although my shoes were i
not in need of polish. I answered in
the affirmative, for there was some- |
thing about the hoy which inter
ested me.
He maneuvered his battered
shoeshine kit into position and
started to clean my shoes with gus
to. While he deftly applied the pol
ish, I asked him why ho was stil 1
working at such a late hour, for j
shoeshine boys usually stopped j
working after nine o'clock.
"But I don't start work till nine,"
he replied.
