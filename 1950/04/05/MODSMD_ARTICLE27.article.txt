# Library Losses
## 
### 
A university's hbraiy is supposed to be a
democratic place where knowledqe is avail
able, on an equal basis, to all who seek it.
The Stanford Library is one oi the finest in
this country. It has steadily become more com
plete and more efficient, with the qoal of af
fordinq a maximum number of students the
quickest, easiest access to a maximum number
of reference materials.
The qoal is not easily attained, and the job is
becominq more difficult daily because ol the
mutilation and stealinq of reference materials.
And we refer not to accidental tearinq of paqes,
but to the deliberate rernovinq of chapters and
articles from periodicals and books.
All libraries face this problem to some ex
tent, but at Stanford the situation has qotten lar
out of hand.
for instance, the libraiy inventory in 1923
leported 23 losses from the reference room.
Last year, as of April 15, the losses reached
the deplorable figure of 96. By September I
only 22 of these books had been recovered.

A survey of serials in the main room of the
Serial Section, at the end of fall quarter last
year, showed 111 missinq.
Mutilation of some books and periodicals has
been so complete that replacements were
necessary.
Heplacinq and repair inq reference materials
is an expensive piocess, which leaves less
money to buy new books. And until replace
ments are made, students are often deprived
of important references.
The Libraiy exists lor the students, and it
seems only fair to us that the students look out
lor their own interests by respeclinq "the
other" person's riqht to equal opportunity in
the business of learninq.
If the students do not take this responsibility
lo keep the Libraiy materials, the University
will be forced to place "spotters" in the Library
to police students while they study.
This sort of action would be disliked by all
concerned, but ii will be imposed if necessary.
It's up to you,
