After several quarters of trial and error, the
Bookstore has devised a plan lor avoiding the
hrst-of-the-quarter stampede for textbooks.
Yesterday afternoon the dozen clerks serv
ing ihe main book counter were waiting on stu
dents almost as fast as book request slips could
be filled out. fn fact, the lines lor miscella
neous supplies were generally longer than Ihe
lextbook line.
By selling spring quarter books during the
last part of winter quarter, the Bookstore has
spread out the sales problem over a longer
period. They have cleared more floor space in
the gift and fiction book areas so Easter spe
cialties can receive more attractive display.

And last, but most important to the average
buyer, they have taken the load off the feet of
those in the waiting lines which formerly ex
tended far out the south doors of the Bookstore.
The success of the new system can't be
credited to any one person. It is the result of
co-operation from the faculty, the students, and
from Mrs. Bauchou and her Bookstore em
ployees.
To over three fourths of the faculty who sub
mitted textbook lists; to more than half the stu
dents who bought their books in the pre-sale
period, and to the entire Bookstore staff who
handled the new system so efficiently, a vote
of thanks.— G.A.
