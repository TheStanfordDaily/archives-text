### JOHN BODNAR 
As a child I wasn't much plagued with thai question
r.t the end of each school day,"And just what did you
learn today?" It seems that the first day my father
asked me, I kicked him in the shins, and since then
his interest in my scholastic achievements has been
very sparse.
Between quarters was a temptation for him. He set
his shins out of reach, kept louking at his paper and
rasually asked, "Learning much, son?"
"Just loads. Dad." 1 continued thumbing through
my little book.
"Don't go reminding him of his studies. He's on
vacation," Mom said. "Son, have you enough socks at
school?"
"Yes, Mom." J ran a line through the phone number
of a girl who had gotten married since I was last home.
"I'm paying for his education. I'm entitled to some
information," Dad said.
"It's been 25 years since you've been to college.
'Things have changed since then. Son, have you got
enough underwear at school?"
"Yes, Morn " I ran a line thorugh another name
'"Things haven't changed so much that i can't dis
cuss it with him," Dad said
"You'll get sentimental and start to sing your old
fraternity songs again Son, are von getting good
food?"
"Yes, Morn " I drew another line, 'those wedding
bells are messing up that old black book of mine.
"The night your old cronies came up, you sang until
two," Mom said to Dad. "Son, have yuii seen Florence
• ince you've been home?"
' Yes, Mom' 1 put the book away. "Who did you
-ay?"
"Florence. You know, the brenton girl. She may
not be as pretty as some of the others, but she ca'n

cook and she sew:; her own clothes, and Mrs. Brenton
was saying to me, wouldn't it lie nice if
"Yeah, Dad," 1 turned to him. "I've been studying
pretty hard."
"Glad to hear it, son." I wasn't much of one for
studies, but they are good for you."
"Son, you aren't listening to me," Mom said.
"Sure I am. Florence is a real nice girl, real nice."
"Tell me, son, luive (lungs changed much?" Dad
asked.
"Science is the hig thing now. No more of this fool
ishness about reading and writing. This is the atomic
age." 1 gave him a hearty slap on the back.
"She'll make some lucky boy a good wife," Mom said.
"Just what courses have you been taking?" Dad
asked.
J searched my memory for a few course names I
had read in the Announcement of Courses, thinking
to kid him along. "Well, there's Geometric Function
Theory and Matrix and Tensor Calculus."
"I respect them scientists, but sometimes I think they
ought to say things plain-like so a man can under
stand them."
"Schools arv modern, nowadays," I proudly an
nounced.
"Son, your attitude doesn't please me much. I think
Ihe best thing for both of us would LeMor you lo drop
out ol school and go to work,"
"Work?" I said. "Work?" I pulled up a chair and
put my hand on his shoulder. "But Dad, the important
things you learn aren't in classes, but it's things like
learning to iive with your fellow students that really
count. I continued on into the night, explaining to
l>ad the intangible values of college, reminding him
of his college days and singing old songs with him.

things you learn aren't in classes, but it's things like
learning to iive with your fellow students that really
count. I continued on into the night, explaining to
l>ad the intangible values of college, reminding him
of his college days and singing old songs with him.
As a child I wasn't much plagued with thai question
r.t the end of each school day,"And just what did you
learn today?" It seems that the first day my father
asked me, I kicked him in the shins, and since then
his interest in my scholastic achievements has been
very sparse.
Between quarters was a temptation for him. He set
his shins out of reach, kept louking at his paper and
rasually asked, "Learning much, son?"
"Just loads. Dad." 1 continued thumbing through
my little book.
"Don't go reminding him of his studies. He's on
vacation," Mom said. "Son, have you enough socks at
school?"
"Yes, Mom." J ran a line through the phone number
of a girl who had gotten married since I was last home.
"I'm paying for his education. I'm entitled to some
information," Dad said.
"It's been 25 years since you've been to college.
'Things have changed since then. Son, have you got
enough underwear at school?"
"Yes, Morn " I ran a line thorugh another name
'"Things haven't changed so much that i can't dis
cuss it with him," Dad said
"You'll get sentimental and start to sing your old
fraternity songs again Son, are von getting good
food?"
"Yes, Morn " I drew another line, 'those wedding
bells are messing up that old black book of mine.
"The night your old cronies came up, you sang until
two," Mom said to Dad. "Son, have yuii seen Florence
• ince you've been home?"
' Yes, Mom' 1 put the book away. "Who did you
-ay?"
"Florence. You know, the brenton girl. She may
not be as pretty as some of the others, but she ca'n

cook and she sew:; her own clothes, and Mrs. Brenton
was saying to me, wouldn't it lie nice if
"Yeah, Dad," 1 turned to him. "I've been studying
pretty hard."
"Glad to hear it, son." I wasn't much of one for
studies, but they are good for you."
"Son, you aren't listening to me," Mom said.
"Sure I am. Florence is a real nice girl, real nice."
"Tell me, son, luive (lungs changed much?" Dad
asked.
"Science is the hig thing now. No more of this fool
ishness about reading and writing. This is the atomic
age." 1 gave him a hearty slap on the back.
"She'll make some lucky boy a good wife," Mom said.
"Just what courses have you been taking?" Dad
asked.
J searched my memory for a few course names I
had read in the Announcement of Courses, thinking
to kid him along. "Well, there's Geometric Function
Theory and Matrix and Tensor Calculus."
"I respect them scientists, but sometimes I think they
ought to say things plain-like so a man can under
stand them."
"Schools arv modern, nowadays," I proudly an
nounced.
"Son, your attitude doesn't please me much. I think
Ihe best thing for both of us would LeMor you lo drop
out ol school and go to work,"
"Work?" I said. "Work?" I pulled up a chair and
put my hand on his shoulder. "But Dad, the important
