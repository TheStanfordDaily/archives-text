# CAMPUS OPINION
## Honor Code Violation 
### 
To the Editor:
While reading this morning's Daily, I came upon a
solution to the problem of flunking. If a student is
flunking a course, the obvious thing to do is to cheat.
If not caught, a passing grade is obtained; if caught,
the student only flunks anyway since the Men's Coun
cil seems to be getting more and more lenient in deal
ing with such offenses.
Why does the Council believe in light sentence;, for
such violations (ie., an "F" or a few hours at the

Con Home;? i think they are lagging behind student
thought in this matter. I have talked to many students
about this and the consensus is that suspension for one
quarter should be 11 if minimum sentence for first of
fenses with expulsion mandatory for a second offense.
I would hate lo return to a proctoring system but if
we wish to keep the Honor System then the Council
should give up its spineless attitude toward these
cheaters.
It would be appreciated if an explanation of the
Council': altitude could he given.
