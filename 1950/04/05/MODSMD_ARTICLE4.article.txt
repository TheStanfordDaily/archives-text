WASHINGTON — Chairman Carl

mit tee asked the House today for
$. r ),S:».28!),211 extra for fighting planes
because, he said, the Russians arc
building toward an atomic "Pearl
Harbor."
"The atomic blitz of tomorrow is
a real, a genuine possibility," he
said. "It is universally known today
that Russia is building the largest
air force in the world. They arc
building it for use whenever their

comes around."
