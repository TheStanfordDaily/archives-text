LOS ANGELES DATELINE*
STUFF: Bub Myers, sports editor |
of the Daily Bruin, was telling me
the woe - filled story ot UCLA's
Kansas City debacle in the NCAA
finals. The Woodens lost their open
er to Bradley by the simple trick j
of folding like a wet wash rag in j
the last five minutes, and then fol
lowed up the next night by getting
themselves trounced by Brigham
Young. The pay-ofi came when the
Bruins were climbing aboard an
airplane — center Carl Kraushaar
was carrying the huge trophy that I
the Uclans received for being fourth
(last) in the tourney. Kraushaar
accidentally bashed the trophy j
against the side of the plane and '
now pieces <il Bruin B-Ball trophy i
are al! over the KC airport. Myers |
said it was a rotten way to end a
rotten trip.
UCLA football practice is really a
thing to watch. They have GO as
pirants out ancl only 10 coaches to
iie'p them. That's one coach to ev
ery six gridders. The southern
drawling Sandersmen, all wearing
blue jackets, stand in a big huddle
in the middle of the white - clad !
gridsters and shout directions. From
a distance it looks like the battle of
Gettysburg.
Bruins May He Deadly
The Bruins just may be a deadly
football team next year. According 1
to one of their coaches, they will be
stronger at guard this year—despite I
the loss of Nikcevich and Eaton; as
strong at tackle, and better at end.
The big line worry is trying to find
a replacement for All-Coast center
Leon McLaughlin. There has been
some speculation about moving j
frosh star end Don Moomaw to the j
pivot post.
At USC a couple of basketball '
players are coming into the spot- |
light in different sports. Big, burly,
brutal, likable Stan Christie, once >
an ail-So. Div. center, will try out
fof defensive end on J. Cravath's
1950 model grid team. And over on
Sam Barry's horsehide diamond,
forward Bill Sharman, who broke '
Yardley's PCC scoring record last
cage season, is showing that he i.s I
as good with the stick as he is with j
the hoop.
Cravath and the T
There is still much speculation
around Troyland on Cravath's quiz
zle—to T or not to T. Cravath is
putting in boo-coo double wing
plays in spring practice this year,
but claims he only wants to utilize
Pop Warner's formation's blocking \
potential to teach his kids how to 1
lower the boom. But Troy has a
lot of people down there who think j
that the talents of chaps like Fouch,
Bowers, and Duff could make like j
Murder Inc. from a wing back for- !
mation. Fouch was one of the hot- ]
test prep tailbacks to ever come out
of the CIF.
On the other side of the ledger j
stand three top-flight T-formation |
quarterbacks. Guys now come to j
Troy to play the T, and may have ;
the word T written in their con- 1
tracts for all I know. A straight sin- j
gle or double wing attack on the ;
part of the Trojans would mean a j
waste of good qb's like Wilbur Rob
ertson, Dean Schneider, and the i
newly acquired Ed Demirjian.
Best bet for next fall will be a j
combination T - wing formation, J
with El Trojan being the team to :
beat in the PCC. Again.

On the other side of the ledger j
stand three top-flight T-formation |
quarterbacks. Guys now come to j
Troy to play the T, and may have ;
the word T written in their con- 1

gle or double wing attack on the ;
part of the Trojans would mean a j
waste of good qb's like Wilbur Rob

Best bet for next fall will be a j

LOS ANGELES DATELINE*
STUFF: Bub Myers, sports editor |
of the Daily Bruin, was telling me
the woe - filled story ot UCLA's
Kansas City debacle in the NCAA
finals. The Woodens lost their open
er to Bradley by the simple trick j
of folding like a wet wash rag in j
the last five minutes, and then fol
lowed up the next night by getting
themselves trounced by Brigham
Young. The pay-ofi came when the
Bruins were climbing aboard an
airplane — center Carl Kraushaar
was carrying the huge trophy that I
the Uclans received for being fourth
(last) in the tourney. Kraushaar
accidentally bashed the trophy j
against the side of the plane and '
now pieces <il Bruin B-Ball trophy i
are al! over the KC airport. Myers |
said it was a rotten way to end a
rotten trip.
UCLA football practice is really a
thing to watch. They have GO as
pirants out ancl only 10 coaches to
iie'p them. That's one coach to ev
ery six gridders. The southern
drawling Sandersmen, all wearing
blue jackets, stand in a big huddle
in the middle of the white - clad !
gridsters and shout directions. From
a distance it looks like the battle of
Gettysburg.
Bruins May He Deadly
The Bruins just may be a deadly
football team next year. According 1
to one of their coaches, they will be
stronger at guard this year—despite I
the loss of Nikcevich and Eaton; as
strong at tackle, and better at end.
The big line worry is trying to find
a replacement for All-Coast center
Leon McLaughlin. There has been
some speculation about moving j
frosh star end Don Moomaw to the j
pivot post.
At USC a couple of basketball '
players are coming into the spot- |
light in different sports. Big, burly,
brutal, likable Stan Christie, once >
an ail-So. Div. center, will try out
fof defensive end on J. Cravath's
1950 model grid team. And over on
Sam Barry's horsehide diamond,
forward Bill Sharman, who broke '
Yardley's PCC scoring record last
cage season, is showing that he i.s I
as good with the stick as he is with j
the hoop.
Cravath and the T
There is still much speculation
around Troyland on Cravath's quiz
zle—to T or not to T. Cravath is
putting in boo-coo double wing
plays in spring practice this year,
but claims he only wants to utilize
Pop Warner's formation's blocking \
potential to teach his kids how to 1
lower the boom. But Troy has a
lot of people down there who think j
that the talents of chaps like Fouch,
Bowers, and Duff could make like j
Murder Inc. from a wing back for- !
mation. Fouch was one of the hot- ]
test prep tailbacks to ever come out
of the CIF.
