# Horsehiders Play Broncs
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's varsity horsehiders;
journey to Santa Clara's Washing- |
ton Park this afternoon in an at
tempt to halt the surprising Bron- j
cos. After losing their first two {
games to St. Mary's and California, |
Santa Clara dumped the highly re- j
i-arded USC nine twice in a two
:.'ame series at the Figueroa Street
plant.
The Broncos weren't figured to |
have too much at the plate this year j
after the loss of their heavy hitters |
ol last year, Bill Renna, Tom Kelly, j
and Lou Berberet, to the New York !
Yankees. However, Joe Nally and |
Bob Nard led the Broncos as they
pounded seven USC chuckers for |
2'.', hits in the two-game series.
Heinen Will Pitch
Stanford mentor Everett Dean !
has selected Jack Heinen to oppose j
the heavy-hitting Broncos. Heinen I
was the victim of two unearned j
runs in the season's opener last Fri- !
day, which the Indians dropped to i
UCLA 2 to 1. Heinen was very ef- J
fective against the Bruins as he lim
ited them to six base hits, while giv
ing up only two bases on balls and
striking out eight.
Either Bill Herron or Dick Cor
zine will be behind the plate re- I
ceiving Heinen's slants. The infield j
will be the same that played in the [
UCLA series, with Dick Clegg on
first, Tom Shaw at second, Bruc£
Cameron in the hot corner at third, j
and co-captain Dave Melton in the j
shortpateh.

nis, handball, horseshoes, swim
ming, and track.

len Norquist.

freshman nine in the Sunken Dia

journey to Santa Clara's Washing- |
ton Park this afternoon in an at
tempt to halt the surprising Bron- j
cos. After losing their first two {
games to St. Mary's and California, |
Santa Clara dumped the highly re- j
i-arded USC nine twice in a two
:.'ame series at the Figueroa Street
plant.
The Broncos weren't figured to |
have too much at the plate this year j
after the loss of their heavy hitters |
ol last year, Bill Renna, Tom Kelly, j
and Lou Berberet, to the New York !
Yankees. However, Joe Nally and |
Bob Nard led the Broncos as they
pounded seven USC chuckers for |
2'.', hits in the two-game series.
Heinen Will Pitch
Stanford mentor Everett Dean !
has selected Jack Heinen to oppose j
the heavy-hitting Broncos. Heinen I
was the victim of two unearned j
runs in the season's opener last Fri- !
day, which the Indians dropped to i
UCLA 2 to 1. Heinen was very ef- J
fective against the Bruins as he lim
ited them to six base hits, while giv
ing up only two bases on balls and
striking out eight.
Either Bill Herron or Dick Cor
zine will be behind the plate re- I
ceiving Heinen's slants. The infield j
will be the same that played in the [
UCLA series, with Dick Clegg on
first, Tom Shaw at second, Bruc£
Cameron in the hot corner at third, j
and co-captain Dave Melton in the j
shortpateh.

or Tony Stellar will take over right

rubber for the Broncos.
Santa Clara Coach Patty Cotrell

southpaw, Hal Toso, or one of his
right-handers, George Stein or Ga
len Norquist.
For baseball fans who are not
able to make the Santa Clara trip,
the Braves will tangle with the
freshman nine in the Sunken Dia
