Fifteen of Hi members on the ex
rcutive council, including Student
I'ody President Mark Oilman,

handed in their icsignations March
24 alter the subject of the UC oath
had been discussed and tabled. It
was at this time the LACC admin
istration told the council to stay
clear of the subject.
Resigning members of the council
called it an unjustified attempt to
restrict the actions of the students,
and accused the administration of
denying the group the right of free
discussion and continually vetoing
student action. Council members
said they were required to submit
their legislation for' approval.
LACC President Dr. Howard S.
McDonald, who issued the restrict
ing order, said that the students
were "putting their nose into some
one else's business." He added that
it was the students' right to c'it-cuss
these subjects, but not as student
government.
"It is not in our province to in
terfere with the affairs of the Uni
versity of California," he said.
Los Angeles City College is di
rected and supported through the
Los Angeles Board of Education.
The council sought, through its
discussion, to send a letter to the

UC Board of Regents protesting its
stand on the oath.
The UCLA student body entered
the picture when it was rumored
that students on the Westwood
campus had asked the LACC stu
dent council to send the letter.
News coverage of the incident
was permitted to the LACC student
newspaper, The Coilegian, hut stafl
members were forbidden to speak
editorially on the subject, accord inr,
to the UCLA Daily Bruin. The
newspaper is under the direction of
the journalism department.
Meanwhile, student-sponsored ac
tivities have virtually ceased. A
basketball dinner and the freshman
dance had to be called off because
of lack of approved funds. Final set
tlement of the dispute is expected to
come after Easter when the presi
dent meets with his advisory com
mittee.
Vice-President Kay Longshore of
the southern division of the NSA

region presented the facts of the
case to the Berkeley convention.
The convention then passed a res
olution calling for the administra
tion. faculty, and student body at
LACC to determine the functional
areas of student government and
the educational values to be de
rived from these government activ
ities.
The resolution also suggested that
regularly constituted student gov
ernment be reinstated to fill out the
remainder of the term. It did not
specify whether the resigning coun
cil members should be reinstated.
Jan Robertson, Stanford delegate
to the Berkeley conference, said
that the five Stanford representa
tives approved the resolution.
The resolution, which offered the
help of NSA facilities, was sent to
all members of the LACC adminis
tration and all members of the Los
Angeles Board of Education.
