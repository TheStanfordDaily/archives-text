# Bridges Guilty, Faces Possible Deportation
## After Verdict Longshore Boss Cries 'Frameup' 
### 
SAN FRANCICO, April 4 (AP)
j â€” CIO Longshore Boss Harry
' Bridges, stormy petrel of more
than two decades on the West
| Coast waterfront, was convicted
I today of lying in 1945 when he
i said he never was a Communist.
"Frameup," immediately shouted
I the lean, hawk-nosed labor leader,
| key man in strikes which have para
lyzed Coast ports.
Now the Australian-born Bridges,
who previously had beaten two fed
eral efforts to deport him as a Com
munist, again faces the possibility of
deportation. If the verdict today is
upheld on appeal, he could be or
portcd. Actual deportation, however,
would depend on Australia's willing-
J ness to accept him.
He will be sentenced next Monday.
The sentence could be as much as
I seven years in prison and a fine of
I $15,000.
Two other top men in the Long-
J shore Union were convicted with
Bridges. They were Henry Schmidt,
i international representative, and J. R.
i Robertson, first vice-president.
Were Witnesses
The two were witnesses for Bridges
at his 1045 citizenship hearing, at
which he swore lie wasn't a Com
munist. They were convicted of con
spiracy to aid and abet perjury, and
to obstruct operations of the Natur
alization Department. Each is subject
to the same prison term and fine that
applies to Bridges.
The tension generated by the long
trial and the lony deliberation of the
jury, and exploding in the mass con
victions, was still snapping through
the courtroom as Federal Judge
George B. Harris called the two de
fense attorneys before him.
He sentenced both lawyers to
; prison terms for contempt. Vincent
Hallinan got six months, and his jun
ior colleague, James Mclnnis, three
months. Both will serve the terms in
| a federal institution to be named by
the U.S. Attorney General.
"Still A Frameup"
Bridges said, of the conviction of
the Longshore leaders, "My opinion
jof the Immigration Service still
hasn't changed. It was a frameup and
still is a frameup."
A reporter asked, "You still say
| you're not a Communist?"
"I still say it was a frameup,"
Bridges replied.
"Temporarily, some of our battles
arc behind us," he said later. "Luckily
we prepared for the worst in this ease.
|We tried to get everything boxed
! down for a long pull. We're prepared
to make it. That's the way it is, I
j guess."
His attorneys said they would ap
j peal. The court set Monday at 10 a.m.
| (PST) for bearing of arguments for
arrest of judgment and a new trial.
