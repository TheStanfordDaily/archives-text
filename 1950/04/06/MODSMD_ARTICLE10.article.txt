# Senate Passes DP Legislation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April T> f/l'i The
Senate tonight approved a bill ex
tending the Displaced Persons Pro
gram for another year and increasing
the number of war refugees who
may be admitted to this country to
359,000. The vote on final passage was
58 to 15.
The bill is generally in line with
the recommendations of President
Truman. It represented a defeat for a
Senate faction led by Chairman Mc-
Carran (D-Nev.) of the judiciary
committee.
McCarran had sought a smaller in
| ' icase in the number of DP's eligible
I for admission which is 205,000 undei
I the present act due to expire June
10 -and had fought for stricter defini
tions of those who may come into this
! country.
The bill is similar to legislation ap-
I proved by the House last June. It
j now goes hack to the House. Unless
; it is accepted there, the differences
: between the Senate and House ver
| sions will have to be ironed out in a
! conference.
