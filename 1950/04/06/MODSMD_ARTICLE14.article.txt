## Water Claimed key to Future For California 
### ART HENRY 
Strong support of the Central Val
| ley Project, the Brannan plan, and ,
, greatly increased Social Security!
were voiced last night hy Helen Ga- i
I hagan Douglas, Democratic candi
! date for the U.S. Senate, in a cam- |
paign talk at the Palo Alto Commu
! nity Center.
"Water is the key to the future of
California," Mr.s. Douglas stated. The
expanding population and industry of J
I the state require greater develop- j
! mcnt of water resources and power i
| facilities, and the Central Valley j
i Project is the only way to insure that j
i devcipoment, she maintained.
In lashing out at opponents of the j
C VP, Mrs. Douglas said that the !
j necessary installations would pay for
! themselves in decreased water and ;
power rates.
Terming the KiO-acre limitation on
| water resources as "the only way of j
: distributing water equally," Mrs.
Douglas reminded her audience that
| the limitation is a part of the Recla
mation Act of 1002 and applies to the
j entire United States.
"The Brannan plan would get the |
j food to the people," the three-term !
Congrcsswcman said. She argued the i
Brannan plan would require the pub- j
lie to "pay only once," while the I
present parity plan requires double j
| payment.
"I hate the word 'pension'," Mrs. j
Douglas said in answer to a question
i regarding her proposal for a $7. r >
I monthly nationwide payment. She
'-aid the bill she introduced in the
House calls for increased Social Sc
j curity benefits, to be financed by con- ;
tributions by employers and cm- j
! ployees.
"The challenge of democracy," ,
j she said, "is to keep full production
1 and employment, and at the same j
! time keep our freedom."
Mrs. Douglas said she would not j
support recognition of Red China or
aid to Chiang Kai-shek. "Wc must j
set an example that will give them j
confidence in our way of life. We I
must build around the world condi- !
tions that will permit people to live i
in peace."
