# ENROLLMENT
## Registration Reaches 7,150; '49 Total Falls 
### 
Registration jumped over the
7,000 mark yesterday. By noon,
5,304 men and 1,780 women, a total
ol 7,150 students, had enrolled for
spring quarter.
At first well behind comparative
figures for a year ago, the registra
tion figure has climbed during the
past three days until it is now only
.'>7l behind third - day registration
for spring quarter, 1949. (Monday's
registration was 515 behind reg flay
figures for a year ago, and Tues
day's was 425 behind second-day
figures for a year ago.)
"We're still under our expecta
tions," commented University Reg
istrar H. Donald Winbigler, "but we
may get over 7,400 yet." Before reg
istration began, the registrar esti
mated that around 7,500 would en
roll.
One good-sized group has yet to
enroll, Dr. Winbigler said. Most
teachers from the local area who
want to take Saturday and night
classes in the School of Education
will register during a special period
Saturday.
Though University policy favors a
gradual dropping-ofT from the «ll
time peak of 8,350 students in fall
quarter, 1948, Stanford enrollment is
not headed toward any definite
"normal" figure.
"I foresee no drastic reduction in
the near future," he said. "It will be
a gradual casing down."
Each University department has
its own idea of wha ta "normal"
figure is, and each idea is different,
Dr. Winbigler added. "Individual
arms are working on the problem,
but. no deci: ion has been reached."
A falling-ofT of veteran enroll
ment is expected as more and more
of those eligible under the GI Ril!
of Rights are graduated.
A final breakdown of the regis
tration figures, "except for a few
stragglers," will be announced by
the Registrar's Office in about two
weeks.
