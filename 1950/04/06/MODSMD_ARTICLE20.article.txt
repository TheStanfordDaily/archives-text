# Grotto Club Explores Cave
## 
### 
During spring vacation, seven
members of the Stanford Grotto
Club further explored their discov
ery— the Cave of the Lost Soldiei
in Sequoia National Park, which
they describe as the most beautiful
cave in California.
The cave was actually found late
in 1949, but for years legends about
it had circulatcd throughout the re
gion. It had been referred to as "the
Cave of the Lost. Soldiei" since the
days when the Army ran the na
tional parks.
On this latest of three trips made
to the cave, the Grotto Club went
down 225 feet. They had gone down
to 114 feet on their previous trip,
when the discovery of a 75-foot well
stopped further investigations until
more rope could be obtained At
the bottom of the well, investigation
showed a large room with channel,
radiating off in all directions.
A trip down one of the chann? 1 :.
yielded skeletal remains over 200
years old. The Stanford Geoloay
Department has added these to its
collection. One room explored, the
"east room," is the most inspiring
chamber in any known California
cave, and rivals in refinement aiH
perfection any single *oom in East
ei n caves.
Members present on the trip of
March 24 and 25 were Chet Wrucke,
I'd Danehy, George W. Moore, Ah
Langc,'Neil Bostick, George Mowal,
and Jack Maling.
