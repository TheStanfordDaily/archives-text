# Suspension for Code Violators
## 
### 
Yesterday qui Campus Opinion column car
tied a letter attacking the Council toi Student
Control lor its action in givinq a confessed
Honor Code violator a light sentence.
The letter-wiitei stated that most students
feel that one-quarter suspension should be the
minimum penalty lor a first violation ol the
Code, with expulsion mandatory for d second
offense,
The letter-writer is correct, as pi oven by a
survey of the studenl body conducted two
years ago by the Honor Code Standing Com
mittee. And this system of penalties has been
the policy governing punishment ol Code vio
lators, until the recent Council decision which
let a violator oft with only an "F" in ihe course
where the cheating occurred.
We have examined the circumstances of the
violation, as presented to the Council, and the
*easoning of Council on which the "light" sen
tence was based.
It seems to us that the Council was spoon
fed a sob story and swallowed it hook, line cmd
sinker.
The violator admitted that he had submitted
cnother student's work aÂ« his own. He claimed
that he never intended it to pass as his work.
Yet he made no attempt to label it as anything
else,

lie flashed the Council a stoiy about "unfair
treatment" by the instiuctoi in the course, and
othei eloquent pleas of persecution.
Council readily found him guilty uf violating
the Honor Code. Bui some of the Council mem
beis fell lor his aigumerits about extenuating
circumstances and promptly forgot that they
represented a student body thai had said Code
violators should be suspended for one quarter.
What to do about the situation? Under no
circumstances can the offender be tried again
oi given a different sentence for his offense.
The answer is simply this: a mistake was
made, We are convinced that it will not hap
pen again. A new Council is serving now, and
decisions will be made in line with Ihe policy
approved by the students two years ago.
The Council lor Student Control is fully
aware of its responsibility to campus opinion,
and has reallirrned its intent to render deci
sions in light of that opinion. The Council has
assured us that it will continue to welcome sug
gestions and criticisms.
Council's mistake can best be written off to
experience. It is unlikely that any injury has
been done lo our Honor Code by this isolated
incident.
