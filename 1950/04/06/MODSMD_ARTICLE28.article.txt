# Eating Clubs Pass a Hurdle
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees have approved the
eating clubs' plans for new quarters "in prin
ciple," meaning "we like the idea, go ahead
and draw up something concrete to show us."
Drawing up something concrete will be the
job of the Inter-Club Building Committee,
headed by Bill McPherson. This four-man
group will be increased in membership and
loaded down with the many problems which
come with the planning and building of a $)35.-
000 project. Many of these problems were dis
cussed at a joint meeting of the clubs in Toyon
last night.
First and foremost is the problem of finances,
fi will be up to the individual clubs to raise the
money, and once again the alumni will be
called upon to aid the cause. Many of the
( lubs have already paved the way for this re
quest.
Ownership, location, and architectural plans
are a few of the complex problems to be
worked out by the committee, if is impossible
to set a staitmg date for construction until the
required money is lined up.
The Board of Trustees' decision can be inter

pieted to mean that the eating clubs have found
a permanent position on campus and that the
University has full faith in their strength. Such
faith has no! always been forthcoming, and
rightfully so. The end of the war found the
clubs struggling for survival. But since that
time, the combined membership has almost
doubled and club participation in campus life
lias been steadily on the increase.
Another verification of their strength is their
t/adition. The clubs are not an overnight whim,
but were set up by students who, for 50 years,
have desired to get something more out of their
mealtimes than food.
The new building will provide kitchen, din
ing room, and club room facilities for the seven
clubs which must now eat in a crowded sec
tion of Encina Commons and use lounge rooms
in Toyon which might otherwise be used for
study or television entertainment.
The final realization of their project will come
only after hard woik and steady co operation,
but the major huidle of University recognition
of the eating club potential has already been
passed. AM.
