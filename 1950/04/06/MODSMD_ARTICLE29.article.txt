# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
I woke up screaming the other night in the middle
of a terrifying nightmare.
Only a few minutes befoi e I had been contentedly
relaxing under a tahle at Dinah's (with my own pop
corn bag) when suddenly the scene changed and there

was nothing there but a large,
empty room
Then, the room started tilling up
with newspapermen who were
i unning all over the place and
* hooting "Stanford can beat USC
in track Stanford can beat USC
in track Stanford can beat USC
m track "
Then I saw myself in the room,
i unning around with a club trying
to smash these guys who kept
yelling. I started shouting myself.
"Stanford can't. Stanford can't."

Finally, I had finished ofl all but. two. "Okay-okay,
who arc you guys?" I bogarted in my best nightmare
style.
I'm Brown from the Daily Sun," answered the first,
..rid although 1 knew lie was lying, I had to admit this
was the season for it,
"Who's your buddy? And don't, get smart," was all
I could say
"I'm Sharp from the Daily blade," spoke up the sec -
ond, and here foi the fir..! time 1 realized thai I was
having a bad dream.
But I tried to reason with them. Don't you guys
know that Iron Gay Bryan ha; been reduced to scrap,

that Larry Hofl's feel are lender, that Al Lyons hasn't
begun to roar yet, that Drew Terramorse is playing
hide and seek, and that everybody in the school had
forgotten that the USC meet was so eariy.
"Come-through performances," they said as they
nodded their heads up and down in agreement.
"No-no," I staled in despair. "Stanford lias about as
much chance as a canoe full of girls at the Lake."
"But-but," they sputtered. "It's a challenge to the
Cardinal. They can still do it."
I saw it was no use reasoning and started to swing
my club again. I was still swinging when I woke up.
What a terrible dream I thought to myself. How can
these guys think Stanford still has a chance. We've
lost too many men. The met is on foreign cinders.
The odd.*: don't stack up
But I kept thinking about the dream. Maybe
Chambers will break his leg again I thought. Maybe
SC really isn't fooling when they say their best cen
tury man is only good for 10-Hal. Maybe making Cay
Bryan captain lot the meet will accomplish that ex
tra push. Maybe SC will drop the baton.
Fieking up speed, I jumped out of bed and ran to
my tattered lorin chart. I made several fantastic
switches, and added the points feverishly, but even
this was not enough, Stanford still had only CO points
and (i(i is the object.
'But maybe. I .started to say In inysell and then
slopped, "No no I ve gone too Jar." And then 1 picked
Up the club I had used m the nightmare and bashed
in my own head.
I must be getting too much sun.

ond, and here foi the fir..! time 1 realized thai I was
having a bad dream.
But I tried to reason with them. Don't you guys
know that Iron Gay Bryan ha; been reduced to scrap,

that Larry Hofl's feel are lender, that Al Lyons hasn't
begun to roar yet, that Drew Terramorse is playing
hide and seek, and that everybody in the school had
forgotten that the USC meet was so eariy.
"Come-through performances," they said as they
nodded their heads up and down in agreement.
"No-no," I staled in despair. "Stanford lias about as
much chance as a canoe full of girls at the Lake."
"But-but," they sputtered. "It's a challenge to the
Cardinal. They can still do it."
I saw it was no use reasoning and started to swing
my club again. I was still swinging when I woke up.
What a terrible dream I thought to myself. How can
these guys think Stanford still has a chance. We've
lost too many men. The met is on foreign cinders.
The odd.*: don't stack up
But I kept thinking about the dream. Maybe
Chambers will break his leg again I thought. Maybe
SC really isn't fooling when they say their best cen
tury man is only good for 10-Hal. Maybe making Cay
Bryan captain lot the meet will accomplish that ex
tra push. Maybe SC will drop the baton.
Fieking up speed, I jumped out of bed and ran to
my tattered lorin chart. I made several fantastic
switches, and added the points feverishly, but even
this was not enough, Stanford still had only CO points
and (i(i is the object.
'But maybe. I .started to say In inysell and then
slopped, "No no I ve gone too Jar." And then 1 picked
Up the club I had used m the nightmare and bashed
in my own head.
I must be getting too much sun.

I woke up screaming the other night in the middle
of a terrifying nightmare.
Only a few minutes befoi e I had been contentedly
relaxing under a tahle at Dinah's (with my own pop
corn bag) when suddenly the scene changed and there

was nothing there but a large,
empty room
Then, the room started tilling up
with newspapermen who were
i unning all over the place and
* hooting "Stanford can beat USC
in track Stanford can beat USC
in track Stanford can beat USC
m track "
Then I saw myself in the room,
i unning around with a club trying
to smash these guys who kept
yelling. I started shouting myself.
"Stanford can't. Stanford can't."

Finally, I had finished ofl all but. two. "Okay-okay,
who arc you guys?" I bogarted in my best nightmare
style.
I'm Brown from the Daily Sun," answered the first,
..rid although 1 knew lie was lying, I had to admit this
was the season for it,
"Who's your buddy? And don't, get smart," was all
I could say
