Z'ICAGUE, Czechoslovakia â€” The
Prague state court sentenced one
Roman Catholic clergyman to life
imprisonment and nine others to
lesser terms today on charges of
treason, spying for the Vatican, and
plotting an armed revolt against the
Communist government.
Dr. Jan Mastilak, 39, Redemptorist
director of a Moravian theological
institute, drew the top sentence in
this first mass trial of Catholic
priests in Czechoslovakia since the
Communist coup in 1948.
