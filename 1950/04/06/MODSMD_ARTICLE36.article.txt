# Method for Study of Child Development Introduced in Stanford Press Edition
## 
### 
The Stanford University Press
has recently published a new book
which gives a much more reliable
method of determining the develop
mental status of children than the
use of height-weight-age tables.
The book, "Radiographic Atlas of
Skeletal Development of the Hand
and Wrist," by Dr. William Walter
Greulich and Miss S. Idell Pyle,
is based on the Brush Foundation's
14-year study of the growth and
development of normal children. 1

The "Atlas" includes photograph - i
ic reproductions of hand-films that
portray <he characteristic skeletal
development of boys and girls from
birth to early childhood.
Since the skeleton of the healthy
child develops as a unit and its var
ious parts tend to keep pace with
one another, X-rays of the hand can
furnish insight inlo the develop-
I mental status of the entire skeleton.
