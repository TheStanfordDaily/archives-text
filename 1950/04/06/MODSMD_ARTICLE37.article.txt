# Indians Edge Santa Clara, In Tense CIBA Tilt, 4 to 3
## Clegg and Klein Account for Five Hits As Stanford Takes Over Third Place 
### BILL SWIGART 
Stanford's varsity baseballers clowned their way to their second
CIBA victory in a row yesterday afternoon by outlasting Santa
Clara, 4 to 3, in a contest that bore striking resemblance to last
Saturday's 4 to 3 win over UCLA.
Santa Clara made five errors and Stanford two, but neverthe-

less it was an interesting game to j
watch.
The Cards built up a 4 to 0 lend in
the first five innings, but they barely
held on, and there were Santa Clara
runners on second and third when
Dave Stott fanned Bob Nally for the
final out.
Heinen Tires
Stanford's starting pitcher,, Jack j
Heinen, went great guns for the first }
lour innnigs, but he tired in the fifth
and gave up two runs on a hit bat- |

ter, and walk, and Frank Lico's smash
to rir»ht field that eluded John Clny
pool's outstretched glove and went for
two bases.
Dave Stott took over in the sixth,
and gave up only four hits (he rest
of the w;iy as he nursed Stanford's
4 to 2 lead into victory.
Klein Homers
Stanford broke the ice in the top of
the fourth, when Bud Klein, as the
first man up in the inning, hit a long
fly that cleared the left field fence
for a home run. The Cards scored
another one in that inning as Dave
Melton walked, Dick Clegg hit one of
three singles that he picked up dur
ing the game, and Melton came home
on an attempted pick off play and an
error at second base.
Errors paved the way for Stan
ford's final two runs in the filth. Bud
Klein singled, Charley Cole walked,
and both moved around and scored
on two successive wild pitches and an
error.
Errors Galore
With Klein dashing down the third
base line, Stein tried to cover home
while catcher Mil Fore retrieved the
ball. The throw from Fore to Stein
was wild, and as the ball rolled out
toward the mound, Charley Cole
rounded third and started for the
plate.
The throw from Stein to Fore was
again wide, and in the confusion that
followed Cole had time to go back and
touch home plate after missing it the
first time.
Stotl Is Effective
Dave Stott gave up a single run in
the eighth on a single by Lico and a
double by Mil Fore, but otherwise
was quite effective during the four
frames that he worked.
However, the roof almost caved in
on him after two were out in the
ninth, as pint-sized pinch hitter Don
Fiori beat out a roller to the shortstop,
and Bob Nard doubled to center.
After Lico was intentionally passed to
(ill the bases, Stott got Bob Nally on
strikes and the game ended.

made by USC's Bob Peoples in 1941. Held, who is improving
every week, tossed the spear 233 ft. 2Va in. in the Olympic
Club meet last Saturday.
Stanford's varsity baseballers clowned their way to their second
CIBA victory in a row yesterday afternoon by outlasting Santa
Clara, 4 to 3, in a contest that bore striking resemblance to last
Saturday's 4 to 3 win over UCLA.
Santa Clara made five errors and Stanford two, but neverthe-

less it was an interesting game to j
watch.
The Cards built up a 4 to 0 lend in
the first five innings, but they barely
held on, and there were Santa Clara
runners on second and third when
Dave Stott fanned Bob Nally for the
final out.
Heinen Tires
Stanford's starting pitcher,, Jack j
Heinen, went great guns for the first }
lour innnigs, but he tired in the fifth
and gave up two runs on a hit bat- |

ter, and walk, and Frank Lico's smash
to rir»ht field that eluded John Clny
pool's outstretched glove and went for
two bases.
Dave Stott took over in the sixth,
and gave up only four hits (he rest
of the w;iy as he nursed Stanford's
4 to 2 lead into victory.
Klein Homers
Stanford broke the ice in the top of
the fourth, when Bud Klein, as the
first man up in the inning, hit a long
fly that cleared the left field fence
for a home run. The Cards scored
another one in that inning as Dave
Melton walked, Dick Clegg hit one of
three singles that he picked up dur
ing the game, and Melton came home
on an attempted pick off play and an
error at second base.
Errors paved the way for Stan
ford's final two runs in the filth. Bud
Klein singled, Charley Cole walked,
and both moved around and scored
on two successive wild pitches and an
error.
Errors Galore
With Klein dashing down the third
base line, Stein tried to cover home
while catcher Mil Fore retrieved the
ball. The throw from Fore to Stein
was wild, and as the ball rolled out
toward the mound, Charley Cole
rounded third and started for the
plate.
The throw from Stein to Fore was
again wide, and in the confusion that
followed Cole had time to go back and
touch home plate after missing it the
first time.
Stotl Is Effective
Dave Stott gave up a single run in
the eighth on a single by Lico and a
double by Mil Fore, but otherwise
was quite effective during the four
frames that he worked.
However, the roof almost caved in
on him after two were out in the
ninth, as pint-sized pinch hitter Don
Fiori beat out a roller to the shortstop,
and Bob Nard doubled to center.
After Lico was intentionally passed to
(ill the bases, Stott got Bob Nally on
strikes and the game ended.

Losing pitcher—Stein.


BUD HELD, the greatest javelin thrower in Stanford history, will
be all out to break the NCAA javelin record of 234 ft. 3V2 in.
made by USC's Bob Peoples in 1941. Held, who is improving
every week, tossed the spear 233 ft. 2Va in. in the Olympic
Club meet last Saturday.
Stanford's varsity baseballers clowned their way to their second
CIBA victory in a row yesterday afternoon by outlasting Santa
Clara, 4 to 3, in a contest that bore striking resemblance to last
Saturday's 4 to 3 win over UCLA.
Santa Clara made five errors and Stanford two, but neverthe-

less it was an interesting game to j
watch.
The Cards built up a 4 to 0 lend in
the first five innings, but they barely
held on, and there were Santa Clara
runners on second and third when
Dave Stott fanned Bob Nally for the
final out.
Heinen Tires
Stanford's starting pitcher,, Jack j
Heinen, went great guns for the first }
lour innnigs, but he tired in the fifth
and gave up two runs on a hit bat- |

ter, and walk, and Frank Lico's smash
to rir»ht field that eluded John Clny
pool's outstretched glove and went for
two bases.
Dave Stott took over in the sixth,
and gave up only four hits (he rest
of the w;iy as he nursed Stanford's
4 to 2 lead into victory.
Klein Homers
Stanford broke the ice in the top of
the fourth, when Bud Klein, as the
first man up in the inning, hit a long
fly that cleared the left field fence
for a home run. The Cards scored
another one in that inning as Dave
Melton walked, Dick Clegg hit one of
three singles that he picked up dur
ing the game, and Melton came home
on an attempted pick off play and an
error at second base.
Errors paved the way for Stan
ford's final two runs in the filth. Bud
Klein singled, Charley Cole walked,
and both moved around and scored
on two successive wild pitches and an
error.
Errors Galore
With Klein dashing down the third
base line, Stein tried to cover home
while catcher Mil Fore retrieved the
ball. The throw from Fore to Stein
was wild, and as the ball rolled out
toward the mound, Charley Cole
rounded third and started for the
plate.
The throw from Stein to Fore was
again wide, and in the confusion that
followed Cole had time to go back and
touch home plate after missing it the
first time.
Stotl Is Effective
Dave Stott gave up a single run in
the eighth on a single by Lico and a
double by Mil Fore, but otherwise
was quite effective during the four
frames that he worked.
However, the roof almost caved in
on him after two were out in the
ninth, as pint-sized pinch hitter Don
Fiori beat out a roller to the shortstop,
and Bob Nard doubled to center.
After Lico was intentionally passed to
(ill the bases, Stott got Bob Nally on
strikes and the game ended.
