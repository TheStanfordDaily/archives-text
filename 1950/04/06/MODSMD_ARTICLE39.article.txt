# Yardley Has Busy Vacation On Hardwoods
## 
### 
George Yardley, the blond bird,
hasn't landed yet lor spring quarter.
He is still flying full speed along
the basketball front.
George took oft' immediately after
cracking Luisetti's 12-year-old rec
ord on the last night of the South
ern Division season, hooked up with
Luisetti's Stewart Chevrolets, and
played four straight nights in San
Francisco's PA Tourney to lead the
Chevies to the title.
Yardley grabbed the watch for
high point honors in that tourney
and would have been named the
most valuable man, but the Exam
iner wanted to divide the loot and
gifted it to Don Barksdale.
Following the PA wars, George
hopped off to Denver, and turned
in live straight nights in the Den
ver altitudes, although Stewarts got
dumped in the semi-finals.
Immediately after the National
AAU finals in Denver, he pl;ined
out to New York where he played
in the all-star East-West game in
Madison Square Garden along with
other coast big boys, George Stan
ieh and Don Lofgran.
Yardley dumped in eight in his
Garden appearance and was con
sidered one of the best men on the
floor.
Right now he's pausing to say
hello to the iamily in Balboa before
returning to school. He just could
nt lace another day in the Pavilion.
Enough basketball is enough.
