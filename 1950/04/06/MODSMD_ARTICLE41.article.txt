For the third straight year the In

The Spartans, who are defending
champions, have won the tourna

appear to have another strong team
this year. San Jose already holds a
20Va to 6V2 victory over California

The Bears also seem to have an
improved squad. They are led by
little Frank Minch and Leo Evart,
who are their only two lettermen.
St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and College
of Pacific are the other three en
trants.
Last year the Indians were second
in team play with 292 strokes, four
