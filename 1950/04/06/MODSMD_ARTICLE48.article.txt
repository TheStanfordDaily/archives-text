# KZSU Hunts Siren's Voice

WANTED: one Stanford Sadie.
KZSU Station Manager Chuck
; Black announced yesterday that
I tryouts for the amorous enchantress
of the airwaves will be held from
| 4 to 5 p.m. today and tomorrow in
the KZSU studios upstairs in the
rear of Memorial Hall.
i Each quarter a new coed is cho
; sen to fill the shoes of the famed
j Stanford seductress. Her name is
kept secret until the end of the
j quarter.
"No experience is necessary,"
Black smiled. "All training will be
| provided."
Stanford Sadie traditionally pos-
I sesses a low, spine-tingling voice
that reportedly lures all Stanford
roughs away from their studying
from 10:30 to 11 p.m. Mondays on a
program of records and sweet talk.
Black urged all interested girls to
try out. "Lots of girls have appro
priate voices and don't even know
i it,"he said.
