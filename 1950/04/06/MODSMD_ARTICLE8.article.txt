# Eating Clubs Ideas For New $135,000 Edifice
## Housing Committee Will Offer Plans For Action by Trustees and Sterling 
### 
In a mass meeting held last night in
Toyon Ilall lobby, members from
seven eating clubs informally made
suggestions on problems concerning |
the construction of the proposed
$135,000 Eating Club building.
The new building, which recently j
was approved by the Board of Trus- j
tees, calls for kitchen and dining
room facilities for Stanford's 250 Eat- i
ing Club members.
The ideas that were brought up at. i
the meeting will be assimilated by the
Eating Clubs' building committee.
The committee will then present the
clubs' ideas as to the financing, the
location, and the ownership of the
new building to the Board of Trus
tees and President Sterling for ap
proval.
Financial details ol the project In
particular were discussed at the
meeting, including the advantages j
and disadvantages of University ver- j
sus private loans.
Two main locations for the building
were submitted, neither of which j
conflicts with Stanford's building cx
! pansion program. The first location is
j the lot north of Toyon Hall where the
j pre-war Eating Clubs once stood, !
while the second is directly across
I from Branncr Hall.
Whether or not the University will
! own the Eating Club building, as it
did before the war, was another prob- j
lem that was discussed. A 99-year 1
lease from the University was an al
| ternate plan submitted.
Sarge Littlehale, president of Inter-
Club Council, estimated the future
board cost per Eating Club member
at about $105 per quarter, two-thirds '
j of which will go toward food costs.
Alter the new building is com- i
pleted, the clubs will try to be kept |
us independent as possible. However,
it was suggested that certain fixed
i costs such as steam heat and land- j
! scaping will probably be financed on
j a group basis.
