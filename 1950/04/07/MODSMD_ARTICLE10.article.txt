publican foreign affairs leaders and
the Truman administration joined
hands today to try to pull U.S. bi
partisan foreign policy out of the hole
and get it going again.
The State Department announced
that John Foster Dulles, New York
Republican lawyer and veteran of 40
years in international affairs, had ac
cepted appointment as consultant to
Secretary Acheson—at the request of
Acheson and President Truman.
In New York Dulles said he had
decided to take the assignment be
cause of the urgent need for national
unity in the face of a Russian "threat"
as grave as "any we have ever faced
in a shooting war."
