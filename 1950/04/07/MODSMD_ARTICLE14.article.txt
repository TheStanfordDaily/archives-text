# Movie Goers Must Show ASSU Cards
## 
### 
Student body cards will be re
quired for admittance to "Hellza
poppin," this week's Sunday night
movie feature. This picture, like the
stage production, is a compilation
of the best efforts of those gag
happy comedians, Olson and John
son.
Chapters three and four of the
new serial "King of the .Jungle
land" will be shown. "Awful Or
phan" will be the color cartoon.
