# Tydings Believes Lattimore Clear
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 6 (AP)—Senator Tydings (D-Md.) said to
day that FBI records clear Owen Lattimore "completely" of Com
munist spy charges preferred by Senator McCarthy.
Tydings, chairman of a Senate Investigating Committee, said
furthermore that four members of the committee hold the same

opinion after inspecting a "complete
summary" of FBI files on Lattimore,
Far Eastern expert.
The fifth member, Senator Hick
enlooper (R-la.), who was out of town
when the committee visited FBI Di
rector J. Edgar Hoover, will view the
records next week.
Hardly had Tydings made his an
nouncement when McCarthy told re
porters that "either Tydings hasn't
seen the files, or he is lying. There is
no other alternative."
The chairman had referred to a
summary prepared for the committee
by Hoover from the FBI files on the
accused Johns Hopkins University
professor.
McCarthy said he didn't know what
Hoover had compiled for the commit
tee "but I know what is in the files."
Tydings told reporters that Hoover
and Attorney General McGrath agree
with his estimate of the information
on Lattimore.
The chairman saved his statement
until Lattimore had completed before
the committee his defense against
McCarthy's charges.
The witness told the committee, and
McCarthy to his face, that McCarthy
is a contemptible liar, the tool of dis
credited fanatics, and a violator of
senatorial responsibility who ought to
resign.
After healing Lattimore's 10,000-
word reply to the man who called him
the biggest Soviet spy in the country,
Tydings made this statement:
"I think as chairman of this com
mittee I owe it to you and to the
country to tell you that four of the
five members of the committee, in the
presence of J. Edgar Hoover, head of
the FBI, had a complete summary of
your files made available to them.
"Mr. Hoover himself prepared these
data. It was quite lengthy and at the
conclusion of the reading of that sum
mary in great detail it was the uni
versal opinion of all the members of
the committee present and all others
in the room, of which there were two
more, that there was nothing in that
i file to show that you were a Com
munist or ever had been a Commu
| nist or that you were in any way
connected with any espionage infor
mation or charges.
"So that the FBI puts you com
pletely, up to this moment at least, in
S the clear."

the biggest Soviet spy in the country,
Tydings made this statement:
"I think as chairman of this com
mittee I owe it to you and to the
country to tell you that four of the
five members of the committee, in the
presence of J. Edgar Hoover, head of
the FBI, had a complete summary of
your files made available to them.
"Mr. Hoover himself prepared these
data. It was quite lengthy and at the
conclusion of the reading of that sum
mary in great detail it was the uni
versal opinion of all the members of
the committee present and all others
in the room, of which there were two
more, that there was nothing in that
i file to show that you were a Com
munist or ever had been a Commu
| nist or that you were in any way
connected with any espionage infor
mation or charges.
"So that the FBI puts you com
pletely, up to this moment at least, in
S the clear."
WASHINGTON, April 6 (AP)—Senator Tydings (D-Md.) said to
day that FBI records clear Owen Lattimore "completely" of Com
munist spy charges preferred by Senator McCarthy.
Tydings, chairman of a Senate Investigating Committee, said
furthermore that four members of the committee hold the same

opinion after inspecting a "complete
summary" of FBI files on Lattimore,
Far Eastern expert.
The fifth member, Senator Hick
enlooper (R-la.), who was out of town
when the committee visited FBI Di
rector J. Edgar Hoover, will view the
records next week.
Hardly had Tydings made his an
nouncement when McCarthy told re
porters that "either Tydings hasn't
seen the files, or he is lying. There is
no other alternative."
The chairman had referred to a
summary prepared for the committee
by Hoover from the FBI files on the
accused Johns Hopkins University
professor.
McCarthy said he didn't know what
Hoover had compiled for the commit
tee "but I know what is in the files."
Tydings told reporters that Hoover
and Attorney General McGrath agree
with his estimate of the information
on Lattimore.
The chairman saved his statement
until Lattimore had completed before
the committee his defense against
McCarthy's charges.
The witness told the committee, and
McCarthy to his face, that McCarthy
is a contemptible liar, the tool of dis
credited fanatics, and a violator of
senatorial responsibility who ought to
resign.
After healing Lattimore's 10,000-
word reply to the man who called him
the biggest Soviet spy in the country,
Tydings made this statement:
"I think as chairman of this com
mittee I owe it to you and to the
