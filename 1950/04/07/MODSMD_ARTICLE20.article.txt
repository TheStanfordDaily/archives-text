"I've drawn every quarter since I
I left Roble, and I'm still living in the
I same place. Does a last - quarter
senior get to live where she wants?"
"I'm in the 200 club at Roble and
I don't have a place to live yet.
Does shrinkage really work?"
"We're scheduled for an after- 1
dinner coffee next week with one of I
the freshman corridors, but most of
the girls in the house can't be here
that night. Could we possibly
change the date?"
Any member on Women's Hous
ing Committee has to try to answer
questions like these almost every
day. The most difficult par* of the
job, however, is that every ques
tion has five definite sides to it.
Women's living groups are di- j
vided into live areas, each of them
with one representative on Housing
Com and each with its own particu- |
lar problems which need solving.
What may seem a solution as far as j
one area is concerned may be the \
subject for heated controversy in j
another area.
The committee holds one meeting !
a week, and time is spent largely in '
I lengthy discussion on the particular
difficulties submitted by each of the
living groups. The meetings are al- '
ways open and all girls are encour
aged to bring their complaints and j
suggestions.
Almost every question brought,
up involves the University housing
policy in genera', a matter of vital !
| interest, lo every girl attending j
| Stanford, as well as every girl plan
ning to attend Stanford.
Whenever there is a vacancy j
within the committee, announce- j
| merits are made in the living
groups of the particular area eon
-1 ccrned. The names of all girls in

terested are then submitted to AWS
and interviews arranged. The final
selection is then made.
Besides long-range policy plan
ning, the committee has routine
tasks such as telephoning to arrange
after - dinner coffees and open
houses for the freshmen, and super
vision of quarterly drawing for res
idences.
Housing Committee is one of the
standing committees of AWS and
all actions that it takes must be ap
proved by AWS.
Every member of the committee
soon becomes aware of the fact that
the housing problem is not a sim
ple one. She finds out how the "oth
er four-fifths" live.
