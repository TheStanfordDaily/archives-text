### 
The establishment of the Student-Faculty
educational Commission marks the attainment
of a goal students have long sought: recogni
t.ori pi the fact that those who leain, as well as
those who teach, have much to contribute to
the never-ending work of increasing the eifi
< iohCy of an educational system.
Tl|s Commission, composed of students and
inshuctors, will work through discussion and
investigation to promote better understanding
between the two groups. Students and teach
ins, working together, will examine the prob
lems involved in the processes of teaching and
learning. They will seek and find solutions to
thos6 problems. Both groups will find tre
mendous benefits in the resulting improve
ment in our educational system.
On page 6 of today's Daily the chaiter of the
Student-Faculty Educational Commission is
printed in full. Every student should read it
carefully and thoughtfully.
And every student should recognize that in
time he will directly feci the beneficient effects
of the plan.
The Commission will have many tasks. It
//ill be charged with continuing the work be
qunjast fall on a Faculty Hating system.
It will also be asked to consider a proposed

"Senior Seminar" plan, whereby representa
tive seniors in a given lield of study would
have an opportunity to sit down with the in
structors in that lield and hash over their ideas
on the teaching and learning of that segment
ol knowledge.
The realm of student government at Stan
ford has steadily increased in scope through
the years. Students have earned the nght to
administer, to a great extent, their own organi
zations and activities.
The ASSU Executive Committee and its sub
sidiary organizations, our means of self-gov
ernment, is taken pretty much for granted. Yet
it was once only an ideal students hoped some
day to reach.
The scope of student influence has now
moved into the remaining important sector of
university life .... the academic. .
The responsibility placed in this joint Com
mission by the approval of Dr. Sterling and the
Academic Council is a vote of confidence from
the administration the like of which is heard
in few universities.
It seems to us that we all owe a vote of
thanks to the students and faculty members
who helped bring this plan from an ideal to a
concrete, carelully worked-out, practicable
plan of operation.
