My. Friday grab-bag lite is bulging at the seams tin r e
,so like San Francisco, the city with tlit- three
lainoUs bridges—the Bay, the Golden Clatf-, and Harry
we'll do some cleaning up.
hirst, let's get in a couple of plugs, one for Everett

badlands of Berkeley Saturday
iiftenfoon and who could probably

l<,i tlic Theta Xi's who will try to
t;et away with as much as possible
tomorrow liight at their annual
Apache wrestle, and third for old
Lloyd Merriman who pumped out
fiv< lnjts in five trips yesterday, in
i ludirg a three-run homer, to al
iiio; t fcinch a stalling job with the

(,'incy Reds.
Now, we can go back to the grab-bag. Item one Is a
little note written last quarter at the time The Daily
w;i\ talking about Negroes at Stanford. It was otigin
•'l!y written to the editor, but slipped into my drawer
v hen everybody .started playing hot potato. Nobody
knew exactly how U> take it. Now you cir 1 take il:
T>> the Editor:
It is with deep satisfaction that I observe the
awakening of the collective social conscience at Stan
•oid Long oveidue is the recent Hurry of interest in
the lack of representation here on the farm of minority
racial and cultural groups. But does il not seem
grossly unfair to confine our efforts to recruiting Negro
tudents, who can acquaint themselves with the broth
erly. forward-looking policy <it the University, through
public prints?
V/hat, 1 say, what of tl iut depressed minority, thai
(;l«t on the national conscience, the sturdy Eskimo?
What voices are raised in his behalf? NONE!
No Eskimo has ever attended Stanford, nor has
even applied for admission. In fact, it is doubtful
whether many Eskimos know that Stanford exist;, or
'ait- for that matter. A deplorable situation, indeed!
This is the time for education to take a linn step lur

Our task is clear. Let representatives he : enl to
tii> farthest Northern outposts to bring hack (yea,

us open to the charge of discrimination. Ye.s! Whale
blubber CAN and MUST be Hown in if need be.
"Let no stone be unturned and no oppresser minority
remain unnoticed. We shall embrace them all. Stu
dents, awake to your responsibility. The Eskimo
awaits.
NAME WITHHELD
Next in the bag is a poetic effort forwarded along to
the proper drawer by CLINTON MILLMAN, who
must have thought that it was pretty hot stuff. 1
wouldn't go that far, but at least it rhymes.
"Father, must I go to work?
No! No! My darling son.
We're living now on easy street
With funds from Washington.
"We're cared for now by Uncle Sam
So don't get exercised.
We do not need to care a damn
Because we're subsidized.
"But. if he's going to treat us well
And give us milk and honey
Please tell me truly where the hell
lie's going to get the money?
"Don't worry, child, there i:: no hitch
About this glorious plan.
He'll get the money from the rich
To help the common man.
"but, Father, won't there come a time
II we take ali theii' cash
And they're left without a dime
When things will go to smash?
"You need a lot of seasoning,
You noisy little brat
You do too damn much reasoning
To be a Fair Deal Democrat.
If you're a Poly Sci major, please don I tell Professor
Barclay where you read this. And if you do, send him
to Millman. not to me.
1-et's see, that takes us all the way to the bottom of
the bag, and almost to the end ol the page. But it's
Friday, and you've got two days to recover, so relax.
Like they .say down at the Sea Food Cafe and in
Brooklyn Happy Oyster.
