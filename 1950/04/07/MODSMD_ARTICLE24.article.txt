### JOHN BODNAR 
I ; tood in the phone booth searching thiough my
kfth' for a coin. Ordinarily my pockets are clinking
Ih nickels,, but when I need one for an important
. none call, 1 can't find one. 1 poked my head out of
booth and called to my l'raternily brother Jim
Say, guy, 1 need u nickel, quick like "
'You chintz, you owe me $1 .tiU in nickels its it is,"
iie leplied. "Besides, you should save your money.
Vhat girl in her right mind would go out. with you?"
"Mock me not, fellow student," I said. It had taken
i* a long time to get lip courage to call, and I wasn't
in any mood for his byplay, "(limine a nickel before I
h your head in."
lie flipped me a coin, and 1 • tailed dialing. Woidd
h<- i cmember me, I asked myself Of com se she would
I >n-iii t I spill that cocktaii down the 112 ront ol h» <■ di ess?
I stood and listened to the intermittent buzzing
•o.mds. It's easy enough to pass word.' over a heei or
<ii Quad somewhere, but to face n pip<e of impersonal
machinery like a telephone is always a strain for me.
I shifted my weight from one loot to the other,
•/: iting. A voice answered in a musical torn 1 Hoble."'
I I ad a momentary lapse ol memory
Koble," the voice repeated, "llello, hello.'
"Sorry," I stammered. "I'd lik< to speak In Su/.ie
'u« ii." I use my mo&t masculine voice for these <■»—
ea ions, v/hich is a shade lelow a falsetto.
.lust, a moment, please." I .started rehear; ing wind
I would say, trying to think of sornt clevei gambit I
a ht use. That moment began to'drag. Wondering
//hut could be happening, 1 pictured the warden going
i'i the girl's cell, fingerprinting her, and then (riling
11 '' the had a call. Then ,he wa , populai enoucb
to L« getting another call on another phone

Finally, the sound of her voice came through. Jf.
was an indifferent, "hello." I told her who I was, and
the indifference turning into a chilling, "Who? I'm
alraitl I don't exactly remember you." I caught myself
against the wall with my hand.
1 mumbled, "Don't you remember the party last
week? I wore a gray sport coat and leyi's." My voice
v/as faltering rapidly.
A cry of recognition came. "Of course. I remember
you now. You were the one with the big ears lhat
we all thought looked so funny." 1 laughed my good
natured laugh, ha, ha.
"How have you been?" I asked.
"Swell, and you?"
"Swell, too. How are your studies coming along?"
"Pine, and yours?"
"Kine, too. It's kind ol hard to study on spring day,
like we've been having."
"It is hard to study on spring days," she said
"Yea."
Silence.
1 decided lhat clever repartee had gone on long
< nough and now was the time. "In thice weeks from
Saturday we're going to have a dunce. Would you
like to go?"
"I'm awfully sorry," came die sympathetic but. well
practiced reply. "But I already have a dat • for I hut
evening."
I forced a chuckle. "Oh well, maybe some other
time."
"Bye, see you on Quad," he said.
"See you on Quad,' I echoed and 1 •»-1»I y humi up
