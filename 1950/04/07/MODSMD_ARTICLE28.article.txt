# Farm Scientists Test Nine Cancer-Causing Agencies
## 
### 
Dr. Ed w a I'd L. Tatum and Dr. |
Raymond W. Barratt, Stanlord sci- j
enlists, disclosed yesterday that
Ihey have tested nine types of rays!
and chemicals which cause cancer'
and found that at least seven ol
them cause gene changesâ€”changes
which alter the hereditary charac- j
teristics of cells.
The results, obtained in work j
supported by the American Cancel'
Society, back up the theory that
cancer is caused by changes in the j
heredity - determining structures of |
the cell.
The scientists emphasize that this |
does not suggest that cancer is he- i
reditary. On the contrary, it indi
cales that cancer may be a result ol ;
gene changes in a single cell which j
transmits these identical changes to j
all its offspring cells.
Dr. Tatum and Dr. Barratt tested
the cancer - causing chemicals and j
rays on Neurospora, mold cultures j
that respond rapidly and readily to j
heredity-changing forces. Mutations |
(heredity changes) resulted in al- \
most all cases, and in each instance
there was a greater number of inu- I
tations than occur normally with- !
out outside influence.
Cancer-causers stepped up muta
lion rates from four and five times J
Minimal. In some cases compounds 1
boosted rates to 100 or 200 times j
normal.
X-rays and nitrogen mustards i
(Germany's seciet World War 11
poison gas) were powerful hered- ]
ity-ehanging forces. They also can
cause cancer.
Stanlord scientists will now test j
some classes of hydrocarbons and i
other compounds which are struc
turally related to cancer - causing j
chemicals but which have failed lo
produce cancers so far in experi
mental animals.
The American Cancer Society,
which supported this research proj
ect. is conducting its annual edu
cational and fund - raising drive

throughout the nation this month.
The money will be used to help
support continued research proj- .
ects, many of them in leading Cali- j
fornia universities, on the causes
and cure of cancer.
