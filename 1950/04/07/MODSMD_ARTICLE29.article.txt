J first of a group of five of the best
: English movies made in the last 10
j years that will be shown by the
I Village Film Society this quarter.
The other top English films to be
shown are "Nicholas Niokleby,"
April 15 and 10: "A Double Life," |

; April 29 and 30; and "Odd Man
Out," May 6 and 7.
The rest of this quarter's series j
will consist of Twentieth Century-
Fox re-issued films. Negotiations
; between the Film Society and
| Twentieth Century-Fox during the,
i spring vacation resulted in the ap- '

proval of the Village location for
the showing of re-issued pictures.
Previously Fox and other major
studios had considered Stanford lo
cations as too much in competition
with Palo Alto theaters to allow the
showing of films on campus. The
agreement makes available a whole
new library of outstanding pictures
for the Film Society.
