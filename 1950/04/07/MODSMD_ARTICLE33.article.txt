# Underworld Will Invade Apache Ball
## 
### 
The Parisian underworld will in
vade the Farm Saturday night as
roughs and coeds don Bohemian at
tire for the 13th annual Theta Xi
Apache dance. The entire campus
is invited to join the costumed
crowd for dancing and refreshments
from 9 to 1.
The transformation of the Theta
Xi house to a Parisian dance hall is
being directed by Philippe Berthet,
foreign scholarship student from
France.
Authentic Parisian underworld
costumes suggested by Berthet
would include the following:
Brightly colored low-cut or off
the - shoulder blouses with short,
straight skirts sometimes slit to the
middle of the thigh and high-heeled
shoes with ankle straps for the
women. Accessories may include
heavy bracelets and nccklaces and
long, ornate earrings. Heavy the
atrical makeup will also be in order.
Berets are typical in the Parisian
underworld but are not always
worn.
Bell-bottom trousers with striped
Basque T - shirts or turtleneck
sweaters will be in order for the
men along with a cap of the type
pictured above.

Closed dances have been slated
tonight by Stern Hall, Theta Delta
Chi, and Alpha Sigma Phi. Delta
Kappa Epsilon has scheduled a
closed dance for Saturday night.
