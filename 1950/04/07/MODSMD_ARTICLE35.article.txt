# Tarshis Looks at Stanford
## 
### DONN BYRNE 
Canada — England — Massachu- i
.sqtts—then Stanford.
Cosmopolitan might describe Pro
fessor Lorie Tarshis, director of un- ,
dergraduate study for the Econom
ics Department, and author of "El
ements of Economics," the textbook !
used in lower division economics j
courses here.
Professor Tarshis was born in i
Canada and received his A.B. de
gree at the University of Toronto.
He attended Trinity College at :
Cambridge University, England,
where he received the M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees.
In 193(5 ho came to the United
States and taught at Tufts College j
in Medford, Massachusetts. He be
came a member of the faculty at
Stanford in 194 i but did not ac- j
tually take his position here until '
after the war.
During World War II Dr. Tarshis
was the assistant executive director
of the Joint War Production Com
mittee of the War Production
Board. Later, though retaining a
civilian status, he acted as an op- I

erations analyst with the 15th Air
Force in North Afri'ca and Italy.
Stanford in 1946
Dr. Tarshis returned to Stanford
in 1946 to resume his job. As he
said, "I like Stanford extraordina
rily much. I like the students, the
situation, the faculty, everything
about it." He brought his wife from
Italy this past summer.
This affable professor would only
make a few minor changes in this
otherwise perfect University were
he given the chance. The first
would be to have "the proper pro
visions for faculty meetings, a sort
of faculty union." Most other col
leges have something of this nature,
and Dr. Tarshis feels that it would
give the faculty members a better
chance of meeting and knowing
each other.
Squash .Courts
His second minor change on the
Farm would be the building of
courts for playing squash, a game
which is roughly a cross between
tennis and handball. Squash is a
game that he enjoyed in Canada
and England and would like to play

| occasionally here.
There are several differences be
i twecn Stanford and the schools he
attended. Saying that he didn't
know whether he was "glorifying
: the days of my youth," Professor
Tarshis noted that the students
seemed to work harder in Toronto.
In England there is a much higher
j cultural and intellectual level in
| extra - curricular activities. There,
the students worked in the morn
ings, participated in sports in the
| afternoons, and went to concerts or
i special interest clubs in the eve
j nings.
Sports Different
Of course the sports differed too.
There, almost everyone took part in
both intramural and intercollegiate
sports for the pleasure of it. Here,
j for the most part, sports are com
| mercialized spectator events.
Professor Tarshis, when not re
laxing with the music of Bach, is
now working on his books including
one on business finance. With this
and similar works he is pursuing his
special interests in the income and
employment theory and enterprise
economics.
