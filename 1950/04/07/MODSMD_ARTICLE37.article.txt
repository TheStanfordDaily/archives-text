MISS ROSE MALLORY, Miami Daily News reporter, accompanied the census taker to Fowey
Rock Light, four miles off the Florida coast, to count the four Coast Guardsmen stationed there.
Just as she was stepping onto the lighthouse ladder, a wave struck. Photographer Wally Davis
caught Miss Mallory a split second before she plunged into the ocean. A dunking and a loss of
dignity was the only injury sustained. "Census taking is all wet, I'll stick to reporting," com
mented Miss Mallory. â€”AP Wirephoto
