## NCAA Conference Yields New Amendments 
### 
CHICAGO, April 6 (/I I ) — Six un- j
disclosed proposals for amendments j
of the controversial Sanity Code;
were drafted today as National Col- j
legiate Athletic Association leaders |
ended a "meeting of minds" on I
athletic practices throughout the ■
country.
The proposals evolved from a
two-day session between the NCAA !
executive committee arid represen- |
tatives of 20 affiliated conferences.
NCAA President Hugh C. Willett j
of Southern California declined—at I
a news conference -to describe the j
nature of the proposals. But he said
they ranged from "absolutely no
change up to considerable addition
al aid for worthy athletes."
Willett stressed that the six pro
posals culled from the commission
ers all pointed toward three com
mon aims.
These are: (1) that athletes get
ting aid must be academically wor
thy both in college entrance and
progress toward degree require
ments; (2) there must be "positive
and definite evidence aid recipients
need assistance (no "across-the
boards gi-ants"); and (3) all such
aids must be administered by regu
lar campus agencies.
Willett said the group was unable
to arrange a vote on the proposals
which were, he said, made in
"rough note form."
He also shied away from queries
as to wheher such a specific pro
posal was made as the Southern
bloc's known preference for free
room and board for athletes. The
present code restricts aid mainly to
tuition only.
