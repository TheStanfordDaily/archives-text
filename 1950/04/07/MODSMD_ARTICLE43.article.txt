# Red-Hot Stanford Nine Fights Bears for Lead
## Soph Joe Chez Likely Starter In Tomorrow's CIBA Crucial 
### 
Top rung on the CIBA ladder will be at stake tomorrow after
noon as Stanford's varsity baseballers move to Berkeley to do
battle with the dark-horse league leaders from the University of
California.
It'll be the 170 th renewal of college baseball's "Big Game" series

which began way back in the '90s
J when the two schools got together on i
i the athletic field for the first time.
Bring SB Cards
Starting time tomorrow will be 3:15
I sharp, and admission will be 40 cents
! tor student body card holders.
The Bears, who were nominated to
; the depths of the second division by
the preseason experts, surprised all
I by winning their first two starts and
! now stand at the top of the pack with
! two wins and no losses.
Coach Everett Dean's Indians, fresh
and ready after their 4 to 3 victory
j over Santa Clara Wednesday, stand
to vault into a tie for first place with
St. Mary's if they can get by the
pesky Bears tomorrow. A win would
give them a season's record of 3 and
1, and also a good jump on the rest
of the field, as the CIBA season passes
tile quarter-way mark.
Top Pitchers
Logical mound choice for the Cards
is Joe Chez, the quick right-hander
who set UCLA down on five hits last
Saturday. California's Coach Clint
Evans hasn't named his starter yet,
but it will probably be Andy Stag
nero, a right-handed curve ball spe
cialist from San Diego JC, who re
ceived credit for both of Cal's CIBA
wins.
Other pitching possibilities for the
Bears are Dave Anderson, who beat
the Indians once last year, Bill Gear,
or Whimpy Jones. All are right
handers, which should be good news
to Stanford's batsmen who haven't
been able to hit their hat against
lefties this season.
Stanford's lineup will remain about
the same as it has been for this game.
Sophomore Dick Corzine is a possible
starter behind the plate instead of Bill
Herron, and Tony Stellar, "Jungle
; Jim" Trabucco, John "Slats" Clay
pool are about on a par now for the
! starting right field job.
Juggled Lineup
There is no such certainty in the
j California camp, where Coach Clint
i Evans has been juggling his lineup
J like a vaudeville performer with
j every game.
Nothing's for sure except that Cal
' will field nine men who are l'egis
| tered for classes at Berkeley, but our
guess is that A 1 Davies (.250) will
start in centerfield, Jerry Silverstein
(.343) at third, Don Dodson (.254) at
second, Syl McNinch ( .315) at first.
Jim Monachino (.306) right field, Pete
Corona (.167) left field, Don Lee
(.278) catcher, and Don Monroe
; (.184) shortstop.

Other possibilities are Gil Beck,
catcher; Ed Aitken, first base; and
Jim liowo, Pete Schabarum, and Hoot
Bennett, outfielders. All oi' these men
have been playing about the same
amount of time, so it's pretty hard to
i tell which way Evans is going to
jump next.
But so far, he's had pretty good
| luck with his juggling, inasmuch as
the Bears have won 18 while losing
only three this year. Don Dodson at
second base is about the only really
outstanding ball player on the club, so
Cal's victories have come mostly

through hustle and luck. They were
luckier than a four-leaf clover in
beating both St. Mary's and Santa
Clara, and baseball being the per
centage game that it is, it's doubtful
if they'll last.
Crossfown Rivalry
While Cal and Stanford are battling
for the league lead in Berkeley, jtlu
two CIBA favorites, USC and UCLA,
will be at each other's throats in a
dog-eat-dog two-game series in Los
Angeles which may dump one or both
of them out of the pennant race. St.
Mary's and Santa Clara lie idle this
weekend.
