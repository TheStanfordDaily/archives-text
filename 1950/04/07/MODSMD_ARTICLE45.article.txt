# Frosh Play Ball Here
## 
### 
Alter handing the Braves a re
sounding 5 to 2 shellacking on Wed
i nesday, a revamped frosh baseball
lineup will try to continue its win
ning ways when it meets Richmond
at 2:30 tomorrow on the Sunken
Diamond.
Coach Bob Burnett, not satisfied
with his team's two-won, two-lost
record, has effected a major face
lifting job which finds only four of
the nine season starters still an
swering the opening bell.
George Zaninovich, Jack Shep
hard, and Frank Yapp, who have
traded basketball uniforms for the
heavier baseball knickerbockers,
will all be starters tomorrow. Za
ninovich will patrol right field,
Yapp will be stationed 'at second,
and Shephard will don the catching
gear. The other newcomers to the
lineup are Jim Harding at third and
Doug Shumway in left field.
The other four starters, those who
have survived Burnett's head-chop-
I ping exercise, are A 1 Stellar, center
| field; Bob Murphy, pitcher; Clay
ton McGill, first base; and Dick
Cole, shortstop. Murphy, Stellar,
and Cole are regarded as great
prospects; Stellar has already mus
, cled out two homers this year, and
I Cole has proved that he is no less
■ effective as a shortstop than he is
| as a power hitter.
Also slated to see action are Ron
! Boyer and Jim Powell, pitchers;
| Gene Shirley, outfield; Bob Worth,
j second base; and John Knoeppel,
third base.
