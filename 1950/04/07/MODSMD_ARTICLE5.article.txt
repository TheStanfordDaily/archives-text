SAN FRANCISCO —Two top offi
cials of Pacific Greyhound Lines
said today their company faces
financial losses on its San Francisco
Peninsula and Contra Costa County
commuter service—even if it gets
the hikes in fares it lias asked.
This means, PGL President F. W.
Ackerman told the Public Utilities
Commission hearing on the request,
the carrier will be asking additional
fare increases for its Contra Costa
and Peninsula commuter services at
a future date.
