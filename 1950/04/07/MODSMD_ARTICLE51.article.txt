who are considered even stronger than last year's NCAA cham
pionship team.

Bayless will be missi l in USC's 1950"*
track lineup, which includes, in ad- |
dition, lour national junior college '

Stanford i.s sending an injury-riddled |
team which is minus Gay Bryan, who j
is - out with a pulled muscle.
Other sidelined Card l-rackmen in
clude Merritt Van Sunt, broad jumper,
and Bob Barry, Warren Ward, and
John Kaufman, two-milers.
Meet Records in Danger
Four meet records may he broken j
when the two undefeated teams clash j
tomorrow in the Los Angeles Coli
seum. Bob Peoples' 229 ft. 7 in. jave- !
lin mark, set in the Stanl'ord-SC meet j
in 1941, stands the greatest chance of j
being beaten by Indian Captain Bud j
Held, who has consistently heaved the j
spear over 230 feet.
Stan Anderson's 55 ft. 3 : '/4 in. shot
put record certainly is within reach |
of Stanford's shotput stars Lew Davis
and Otis Chandler. The Cards hope to !
sweep this event from the Trojans j
with either sophomore Chuck Hokan- j
on or veteran Norm Nourse grabbing
lliird place.
Dick Attlesey, Trojan hurdle ace. |
who" has consistently run the highs in !
the low 14's this season, may break
teammate Phil Cope's 14.2 meet rec
ord which was set in 1936. Stanford's
Darrell Kreitz, who was unofficially
credited with 14.5 last Saturday, is
expected to give the Troy star quite
a race tomorrow.
The fourth meet mark in imminent
danger is the 880 record, held by
SC's Ross Bush. The Trojan half-mile
corps, led by veteran Jim Pruitt, may j
break Bush's record, though the Tro
jans are expected to have not too i
much competition from Stanford's
half-milers Woody Bray and Joss |
Scroggy.
Sprints A Question
The sprint races tomorrow are a 1
big question mark. If Stanford could
grab one-two in both the 100 and the
220. they may give Southern Cal a
good scare.
The Trojan sprinters, who were
supposed to have both races all
sewed up, according to the pre
season dope, have remained stagnant
at 10 1 in the 100 for the last five
weeks.
Ronnie Buck, Bob Bryan, and Wil
bur Taylor of the Cards have bet
tered the 10.1 mark this season, and
a Stanford sweep is possible.
Troy's John Bradley ran the 220 in
21.G last week, but will receive stiff
competition from the Cardinal sprint
trio.
Campbell Is Tough
Don Campbell, who vaulted 13 ft.
0 in. lor Stanford last Saturday, may
:'ive aces Walt Jensen, Jack Rowan,
and Al Zimmerman a rough after
noon. Campbell has been improving
1 very week, while junior college
champ Jensen was the only Troy man
lo clear that mark last week.
1 he distance races are also quite
undecided. Whether or not Indian Al
Lyons can hit his stride in the mile
and two-mile i.s the chief question
confronting the track experts.
Jim Neweomb, national junior col-
It"'' champ in the two-mile, seems a

certain winner, if hi? can make up a
conditional grade in his music ap
preciation course. Wally Wilson, who
really i.s a half-miler, will probably
double up in the mile run.
The quarter mile, one of Stanford's
strongest events, will feature Cards
Pitch Johnson and Cass Bly. Larry
Hofi, who favors an injured foot, may
be used if needed in the relay.
The Indians probably will have to
contend with Trojan Captain Bob
Chambers in addition to Norm Stocks,
USC's fast quarter-miler.
Jumps Are Weak
The loss of Gay Bryan will hurt
most in the jumps, for the Trojans
are now figured to take one-two in
both events. However, Fred Fank in
the broad jump and soph Ronnie
Allen in the high jump may upset
the dope.
USC's Sim Iness, former teammate
of Bob Mathias at Tulare, is almost a
sure winner in the discus. Iness set
the all-time junior college discus
record when he threw the plate 1(54
ft. 5 :! .) in. last year.
The Trojan ace hit over 160 feet in
the Long Beach relays this year, but
practice rumors have credited him
with throws around the 170 ft. mark.
Jack Burke, Otis Chandler, and Frank
Bradley of the Cards will oppose
Iness.
Captain Bud Held of Stanford is
conceded a first place in the javelin,
but the fight will be on for the re
maining two places. Cards Scott
Goldsborough and Bob Green will
combat Trojans Larry Goins and
Dean Dillipgham in tomorrow's jave
lin battle.
The Stanford track team will leave
San Francisco Airport at 3:45 p.m.
today and will fly back Sunday after
noon. The traveling squad includes:
Ronnie Allen, Cass Bly, Frank Brad
ley. Woody Bray, Gay Bryan, Bob
Bryan, Ronnie Buck, Jack Burke,
Don Campbell, Otis Chandler, Lew
Davis, Stan Dawson. Dave Dunlap,
Fred Fank. Scott Goldsborough, Bob
Green, Bud Held, Larry Hofi. Chuck

danger is the 880 record, held by
SC's Ross Bush. The Trojan half-mile
corps, led by veteran Jim Pruitt, may j
break Bush's record, though the Tro
jans are expected to have not too i
much competition from Stanford's
half-milers Woody Bray and Joss |
Scroggy.
Sprints A Question
The sprint races tomorrow are a 1
big question mark. If Stanford could
grab one-two in both the 100 and the
220. they may give Southern Cal a
good scare.
The Trojan sprinters, who were
supposed to have both races all
sewed up, according to the pre
season dope, have remained stagnant
at 10 1 in the 100 for the last five
weeks.
Ronnie Buck, Bob Bryan, and Wil
bur Taylor of the Cards have bet
tered the 10.1 mark this season, and
a Stanford sweep is possible.
Troy's John Bradley ran the 220 in
21.G last week, but will receive stiff
competition from the Cardinal sprint
trio.
Campbell Is Tough
Don Campbell, who vaulted 13 ft.
0 in. lor Stanford last Saturday, may
:'ive aces Walt Jensen, Jack Rowan,
and Al Zimmerman a rough after
noon. Campbell has been improving
1 very week, while junior college
champ Jensen was the only Troy man
lo clear that mark last week.
1 he distance races are also quite
undecided. Whether or not Indian Al
Lyons can hit his stride in the mile
and two-mile i.s the chief question
confronting the track experts.
Jim Neweomb, national junior col-
It"'' champ in the two-mile, seems a

certain winner, if hi? can make up a
conditional grade in his music ap
preciation course. Wally Wilson, who
really i.s a half-miler, will probably
double up in the mile run.
The quarter mile, one of Stanford's
strongest events, will feature Cards
Pitch Johnson and Cass Bly. Larry
Hofi, who favors an injured foot, may
be used if needed in the relay.
The Indians probably will have to
contend with Trojan Captain Bob
Chambers in addition to Norm Stocks,
USC's fast quarter-miler.
Jumps Are Weak
The loss of Gay Bryan will hurt
most in the jumps, for the Trojans
are now figured to take one-two in
both events. However, Fred Fank in
the broad jump and soph Ronnie
Allen in the high jump may upset
the dope.
USC's Sim Iness, former teammate
of Bob Mathias at Tulare, is almost a
sure winner in the discus. Iness set
the all-time junior college discus
record when he threw the plate 1(54
ft. 5 :! .) in. last year.
The Trojan ace hit over 160 feet in
the Long Beach relays this year, but
practice rumors have credited him
with throws around the 170 ft. mark.
Jack Burke, Otis Chandler, and Frank
Bradley of the Cards will oppose
Iness.
Captain Bud Held of Stanford is
conceded a first place in the javelin,
but the fight will be on for the re
maining two places. Cards Scott
Goldsborough and Bob Green will
combat Trojans Larry Goins and
Dean Dillipgham in tomorrow's jave
lin battle.
The Stanford track team will leave
San Francisco Airport at 3:45 p.m.
today and will fly back Sunday after
noon. The traveling squad includes:
Ronnie Allen, Cass Bly, Frank Brad
ley. Woody Bray, Gay Bryan, Bob
Bryan, Ronnie Buck, Jack Burke,
Don Campbell, Otis Chandler, Lew
Davis, Stan Dawson. Dave Dunlap,
Fred Fank. Scott Goldsborough, Bob
Green, Bud Held, Larry Hofi. Chuck
Hokanson, Pitch Johnson, Darrell
Kreitz, Al Lyons, De!l Russell, Joss
Seroggy, Bill Storum, Wilbur Taylor,
and John Woolley.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's underdog tracksters, 27 strong, will
journey southward toddy to lace Jess Hill's power-packed Trojans,
who are considered even stronger than last year's NCAA cham
pionship team.
Only Mel Patton, Wells DeLoach, John Montgomery, and Bill

Bayless will be missi l in USC's 1950"*
track lineup, which includes, in ad- |
dition, lour national junior college '
champions.
To combat the almighty Trojans, j
Stanford i.s sending an injury-riddled |
team which is minus Gay Bryan, who j
is - out with a pulled muscle.
Other sidelined Card l-rackmen in
clude Merritt Van Sunt, broad jumper,
and Bob Barry, Warren Ward, and
John Kaufman, two-milers.
Meet Records in Danger
Four meet records may he broken j
when the two undefeated teams clash j
tomorrow in the Los Angeles Coli
seum. Bob Peoples' 229 ft. 7 in. jave- !

in 1941, stands the greatest chance of j
being beaten by Indian Captain Bud j
Held, who has consistently heaved the j
spear over 230 feet.
Stan Anderson's 55 ft. 3 : '/4 in. shot

be used if needed in the relay.
The Indians probably will have to
contend with Trojan Captain Bob
Chambers in addition to Norm Stocks,
USC's fast quarter-miler.
Jumps Are Weak
The loss of Gay Bryan will hurt
most in the jumps, for the Trojans
are now figured to take one-two in
both events. However, Fred Fank in
the broad jump and soph Ronnie
Allen in the high jump may upset
the dope.
USC's Sim Iness, former teammate
of Bob Mathias at Tulare, is almost a
sure winner in the discus. Iness set
the all-time junior college discus
record when he threw the plate 1(54
ft. 5 :! .) in. last year.
The Trojan ace hit over 160 feet in
the Long Beach relays this year, but
practice rumors have credited him
with throws around the 170 ft. mark.
Jack Burke, Otis Chandler, and Frank
Bradley of the Cards will oppose
Iness.
Captain Bud Held of Stanford is
conceded a first place in the javelin,
but the fight will be on for the re
maining two places. Cards Scott
Goldsborough and Bob Green will
combat Trojans Larry Goins and
Dean Dillipgham in tomorrow's jave
lin battle.
The Stanford track team will leave
San Francisco Airport at 3:45 p.m.
today and will fly back Sunday after
noon. The traveling squad includes:
Ronnie Allen, Cass Bly, Frank Brad

Green, Bud Held, Larry Hofi. Chuck
Hokanson, Pitch Johnson, Darrell
Kreitz, Al Lyons, De!l Russell, Joss
Seroggy, Bill Storum, Wilbur Taylor,
and John Woolley.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's underdog tracksters, 27 strong, will
journey southward toddy to lace Jess Hill's power-packed Trojans,
who are considered even stronger than last year's NCAA cham
pionship team.
Only Mel Patton, Wells DeLoach, John Montgomery, and Bill

Bayless will be missi l in USC's 1950"*
track lineup, which includes, in ad- |
dition, lour national junior college '
champions.
To combat the almighty Trojans, j
Stanford i.s sending an injury-riddled |
team which is minus Gay Bryan, who j
is - out with a pulled muscle.
Other sidelined Card l-rackmen in
clude Merritt Van Sunt, broad jumper,
and Bob Barry, Warren Ward, and
John Kaufman, two-milers.
Meet Records in Danger
Four meet records may he broken j
when the two undefeated teams clash j
tomorrow in the Los Angeles Coli
seum. Bob Peoples' 229 ft. 7 in. jave- !
lin mark, set in the Stanl'ord-SC meet j
in 1941, stands the greatest chance of j
being beaten by Indian Captain Bud j
Held, who has consistently heaved the j
spear over 230 feet.
Stan Anderson's 55 ft. 3 : '/4 in. shot
put record certainly is within reach |
of Stanford's shotput stars Lew Davis
and Otis Chandler. The Cards hope to !
sweep this event from the Trojans j
with either sophomore Chuck Hokan- j
on or veteran Norm Nourse grabbing
lliird place.
Dick Attlesey, Trojan hurdle ace. |
who" has consistently run the highs in !
the low 14's this season, may break
teammate Phil Cope's 14.2 meet rec
ord which was set in 1936. Stanford's
Darrell Kreitz, who was unofficially
credited with 14.5 last Saturday, is
expected to give the Troy star quite
a race tomorrow.
The fourth meet mark in imminent
danger is the 880 record, held by
SC's Ross Bush. The Trojan half-mile
corps, led by veteran Jim Pruitt, may j
break Bush's record, though the Tro
jans are expected to have not too i
much competition from Stanford's
half-milers Woody Bray and Joss |
Scroggy.
Sprints A Question
The sprint races tomorrow are a 1
big question mark. If Stanford could
grab one-two in both the 100 and the
220. they may give Southern Cal a
good scare.
The Trojan sprinters, who were
supposed to have both races all
sewed up, according to the pre
season dope, have remained stagnant
at 10 1 in the 100 for the last five
weeks.
Ronnie Buck, Bob Bryan, and Wil
bur Taylor of the Cards have bet
tered the 10.1 mark this season, and
a Stanford sweep is possible.
Troy's John Bradley ran the 220 in
21.G last week, but will receive stiff
competition from the Cardinal sprint
trio.
Campbell Is Tough
Don Campbell, who vaulted 13 ft.
0 in. lor Stanford last Saturday, may
:'ive aces Walt Jensen, Jack Rowan,
and Al Zimmerman a rough after
noon. Campbell has been improving
1 very week, while junior college
champ Jensen was the only Troy man
lo clear that mark last week.
1 he distance races are also quite
undecided. Whether or not Indian Al
Lyons can hit his stride in the mile
and two-mile i.s the chief question
confronting the track experts.
Jim Neweomb, national junior col-
It"'' champ in the two-mile, seems a

certain winner, if hi? can make up a
conditional grade in his music ap
preciation course. Wally Wilson, who
really i.s a half-miler, will probably
double up in the mile run.
The quarter mile, one of Stanford's
strongest events, will feature Cards
Pitch Johnson and Cass Bly. Larry
Hofi, who favors an injured foot, may
be used if needed in the relay.
