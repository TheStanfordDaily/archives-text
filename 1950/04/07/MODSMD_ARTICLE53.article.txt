# Crew Arises While It's Hazy; They're Far From Being Lazy
## 
### EARL ODELL 
How would you like to go rowing
every morning at 5:30' Gives a
person a wonderful appetite lor
breakfast.
Believe it or not, quite a few
Stanford men do just that six days
a week—Sunday they relax until
7:30 a.m. I'hese are the Indian crew
men, who get up every morning,
even before the cum laudes begin
studying, and row eight or ten miles
before breakfast.
Crew, a stripling sport on the
Farm, is not for lazy men as can
easily be seen. Besides averaging
GO miles of rowing a week, the
members of the Stanford crew
maintain every piece of equipment
they own. They have already built
five floats and have completely
overhauled one of their motor
launches. At present they are over
hauling another one. A great deal
of upkeep is also necessary on the
GO-foot shells. Weighing only 250
lbs. with a skin 1 16th of an inch
thick and supporting 1,100 or 1.200
lbs. of men on every rowing ex
cursion. the shells must be kept in
top condition and this is another of
the crew's responsibilities.
Stanford Crew Self-Supporting
Presently, the Stanford crew is on
a self - supporting basis. Most of
their equipment has been in the
form of gifts from loyal alumni, who
a'so contribute toward the main
tenance of equipment. The crew
pays its own way to meets—they
paid for the Poughkeepsie trip last
year out of their own pockets. They
also receive aid from—of all places
—ihe University of California. Ky
Ebright, crew coach at Cal, has been
very helpful in getting the Indian
crew on its feet. In fact, it was he
who arranged for the transportation
of the Stanford shells along with
Cal's shells to Poughkeepsie last
year.
