Matter of fact it's one of the noblest
mousetraps we ever baited.
The Donegal tweed is about the Donegalist
we coyld lay hands on.
It will wear like iron.
It was cut by fastidious tailors
dedicated to the high-flown principle that
Abounding Ease (and we quote) is the Inner Secret
of Style.
It was assembled with devotion and a nat ion
to make a jacket that would last.
But what really accounts for that
smoking path leading Rooswards
is this truly humble price... $25
