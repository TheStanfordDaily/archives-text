### GORDON McKIBBEN 
A comparative newcomer to the
j colorful parade of Stanford tradi-
I tions is "Back to the Farm" Week,
originated in 1!M0. The fourth "Back
to the Farm" Week begins tomor
row.
Student leaders of 1940 were be
j coming worried about the loss of
I that elusive Stanford spirit. The so
lution was sought in a return to the
"good old days on the Farm."
lit a spccial edition of The Daily,
Editor Arch Jenkins deplored the
loss of the old-time spirit ("things
get so dead that Beltramo's tables
have an inch of dust. . . .") and
heralded the "Back to the Farm"
movement as a turning point in the
revival of spirit.
New Football Coach
The first "Back to the Farm"
Week started off with an old ,Stan
lord tradition -greeting a new foot
ball coach. Clark Shaughnessy was
the new man-on-the-spot, and he
made his first public appearance
j that week.
Alluding to his previous job with
| the hopeless Chicago University
Maroons, Shaughnessy told a Me
morial Auditorium audience, "I
don't mind telling you I got a stifT
neck looking at the scoreboard last
year but I'd like things a little dif
| fcrent this next season."
How well the T-mastcr succeeded
in this wish is a bright chapter in
Big Red football history.
Hello Day in that first celebration
was featured by a stunt which
would leave Villagers and ofT-cam
pus students rather unhappy if it
j were tried today. No motor-driven

vehicles were allowed on campus.
Blockades were ercctcd at all en
trances to the University, similar
to frosh road blocks during Big
Game week. The Row was roped
off.
Old - fashioned clothes were the

style of the day, with the usual
prizes offered.
On hand to give proceedings that
'Western justice" flavor was No-
Gun Niccol and his vigilante crew
of 30 roughs, whose duty was to en
force the rules of the day.

A jail was put up in front, of (lie
library, and offenders against the
law were unceremoniously dumped
behind bars. Records fail to dis
close whether or not faculty mem
bers were exempt.
An old-time dance was held in
the Pavilion as an added attraction
A special student poll picker) the
ten favorite old-time songs from
such Gay 'Nineties tunes as "Bi
cycle Built for Two' 1 and "Bill
Bailey, Won't You Please Come
Home?"
Because this first Farm Week
came in March. Founders' Day was
celebrated as the concluding event
An all campus picnic supper at lite
boathouse marked the occasion.
Needless to say, this was before the
day of 7,500 enrollments.
One-Day Celebration
In 1941 a one - day celebration,
patterned after the 1940 Hello Day,
was held in conjunction with the
Con Home Drive. Once again cars
were banned and old-style clothes
were in vogue.
The war years saw "Back to the
Farm" Week dropped, and it was
not until last year that the tradition
was revived. In April, Traditions
Day, Sadie Hawkins Day, Hello
Day, and Back to the Farm Day
were combined to make a "Back to
the Farm" Week.
This year Olympic Day has taken
the place of Sadie Hawkins Day,
which was held fall quarter. To
morrow is Hello Day; Wednesday,
Traditions Day; Thursday, Back to
the Farm Day; and Friday, Olym
pic Day.


RATIO IN REVERSE Although the rdlio is lopsy-lurvy here,
the idea of the traditional "Hello" still remains among Stanford's
cherished traditions. Today roughs are expected to react as
above as Back To The Farm Week gets under v/ay on the Farm.
