## Republican Leaders Said to Back McCarthy Blasting of Lattimore 
### 
WASHING I ON, April 9 (AP) —A Democrat said tonight that
Republican leaders are recklessly backing Senator McCarthy's
charges of Communism in the State Department in an effort to
"get" President Truman.
Republicans retorted to this charge by Rep. Dingell (D-Mich.)

that the President is "afraid" to re
lease .secret government files the Wis -
consin Republican says will prove
his charges.
McCarthy renewed his attack
against the Department and Owen
Lattimore, Far Eastern expert whom
he accuses of being the architect of
a Far Eastern policy identical witli
that of the Communists.
The Senator is on a trip to New
York and other cities in an effort to
line up witnesses who will support
his accusation that the Department is
honeycombed with Communists and
sympathizers.
McCarthy Telegram
But his Washington office made
public a telegram which aides said
McCarthy sent to Acheson from New
York.
He said in it that "regardless of
whether Mr. Lattimore is a Russian
agent he has done exactly what would
be expected of such an agent" by
sabotaging the Nationalist Chinese
government and "secretly shaping
our foreign policy along the identical
lines of the Communist program."
Lattimore has testified that the
State Department adopted very few
of his recommendations, and that if if
had followed more of them China
might not now be in Communist
hands.
"Shocked To I/earn"
In today's telegram to Acheson,
McCarthy said he was "shocked to
learn that the State Department
sprang to the defense" of Lattimore
after the Senator, in a speech at Pas
saic, N.J., yesterday, had renewed hi;,
attack but noticeably omitted some
of his previous specific accusations.
Lattimore has challenged McCar
thy to repeat in an unprivileged for
um the charges he has made in the
Senate, where he is immune from
lawsuits. Lattimore himself said he
regarded McCarthy's New Jersey
speech as a "retraction."
After declaring that Lattimore ad
vocated a course in China parallel to
that proposed by the Communists,
McCarthy said in his wire to Ache
son:
"Strangely the State Department
bays 'bleating like a lamb' and Latti
more says 'weasling' because yester
day I did not state that he had re
ceived 30 pieces of silver for the
above job."

that of the Communists.
The Senator is on a trip to New
York and other cities in an effort to
line up witnesses who will support
his accusation that the Department is
honeycombed with Communists and
sympathizers.
McCarthy Telegram
But his Washington office made
public a telegram which aides said
McCarthy sent to Acheson from New
York.
He said in it that "regardless of
whether Mr. Lattimore is a Russian
agent he has done exactly what would
be expected of such an agent" by
sabotaging the Nationalist Chinese
government and "secretly shaping
our foreign policy along the identical
lines of the Communist program."
Lattimore has testified that the
State Department adopted very few
of his recommendations, and that if if
had followed more of them China
might not now be in Communist
hands.
"Shocked To I/earn"
In today's telegram to Acheson,
McCarthy said he was "shocked to
learn that the State Department
sprang to the defense" of Lattimore
after the Senator, in a speech at Pas
saic, N.J., yesterday, had renewed hi;,
attack but noticeably omitted some
of his previous specific accusations.
Lattimore has challenged McCar
thy to repeat in an unprivileged for
um the charges he has made in the
Senate, where he is immune from
lawsuits. Lattimore himself said he
regarded McCarthy's New Jersey
speech as a "retraction."
After declaring that Lattimore ad
vocated a course in China parallel to
that proposed by the Communists,
McCarthy said in his wire to Ache
son:
"Strangely the State Department
bays 'bleating like a lamb' and Latti
more says 'weasling' because yester
day I did not state that he had re
ceived 30 pieces of silver for the
above job."
