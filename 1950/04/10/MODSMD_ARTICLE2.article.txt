# Hainan Invasion Set
## 
### 
HONG KONG â€” Reports from
Communist China today said Gen.
Lin Piao, the Reds' best field gen
eral, had been ordered to conquer
Hainan and that full-scale invasion
of that big Nationalist island might
be only a few days off.
Hainan, only ten miles off the
south coast, has resisted a series of
small-scale invasion attempts. The
most ambitious was April 1, when
the Nationalists said they killed
5,000 Reds and captured 2,000 who
landed on several beaches. (These
may have been exaggerated.)
