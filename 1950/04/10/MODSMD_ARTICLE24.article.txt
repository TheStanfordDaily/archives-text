### JOHN BODNAR 
She looke.l intelligent, willi her black hair, thin
drawn face, and horn-rimmed glasses. Musi of the
guis I know are blonde in the color ol hair and in
mentality. 1 sat down next to her and smiled a "don't
you look like an interesting person" smile.
She pointed a lung and well-polished fingernail at
my glass and said, ''Don't you realize that the money
you've spent on that could very well go to feed some
■ fcarving Burmese child." Hers was a serious and well
trained monotone
"Betcha he wouldn't enjoy it as much as I am," I
chuckled, wondering that 1 had not. heard this ice
breaker before
Color rushed to her face. The improvement was
amazing. "You beast. To think that any civilized man
would make a statement like that," she shouted.
'Don't let this grey, shark skin, double-breasted
.'.nit with two pair of pants fool you. I m actually a
• avage at heart." 1 gave her one of my meaningful
winks, figuring to play the gag on a little lunger.
.She rolled up one of her brochures and began to
beat me. Losing my balance, I fell oH the stool. Now
I was handier, so the barrage continued.
JViy buddy, Jim, seeing me in need of help, disen
gaged himself from a female friend and came !<> the
rescue. He grabbed her arm and pulled her away.
"Sliarne on you, Miss, picking on a poor defenseless
male like that," Jim said. 1 got up and brushed the
peanut shucks from myself.
"He," she pointed that fingernail at me again, "is a
villain."
"My dear young lady," Jim began. "Our friendship
goes back into the dark abysmal ol time and I can
vouch •"
"He's a beast," she shouted.
Jim looked at me. "How many times have I told
you not "

You've got me wrong, Jim. She wards me to give
this drink to some Burme.se kid, and I'm not about to
be giving any th inks to any kids."
"All I did was suggest that he help the poor starving
Burmese, and he made me a target for his jests." She
fumed and tugged at her tweed jacket.
Jim continued: "But he has contributed." lie nudged
me and whispered, "Show her your Red Cross button
and maybe she'll go away." Jim is the sensible sort
uf friend.
"But I haven't, got it with me," I replied.
She put hei left hand into play and pointed a finger
nail at Jim. "And what have you done for the cause?
You could very easily send those old clothes you're
weai ing to some needy child."
This remark touched Jim to the quick. He pulled
himself up proudly. "Miss, would you have me out of
fashion on the Stanford campus?" He smacked the
dust from his levis.
"You mu.st forsake worldly things."
Something had to he done. I jumped up on a table
and started shooting imaginary planes. Ah-ah-ah-ah
ah. 1 spun around wildly as 1 began chopping imagi
nary Zeros. Then I jumped down in front of her and
started yelling, "Spy, spy. She's a spy."
Jim quickly drew her aside and told her that I was
a wounded war veteran and occasionally had spells
like this. "The last time this happened," Jim said, "he
accidentally threw a chair at a girl and ruined her
looks for life."
The point reached home. She threw up her hands
and ran out.
"You can stop now," Jim said, lugging al my sleeve.
"She's gone." 1 wiped my brow, ordered a double,
and began looking around (or a nice dumb blonde to
talk to.
