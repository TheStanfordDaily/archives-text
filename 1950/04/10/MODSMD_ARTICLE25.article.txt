## World Government Student Opinion 
### 
To the Editor:
1 wish to call to your attention an episode which, I
vitally concerns all Stanford students. The
episode centers around the state Senate hearing held
at Sacramento on the evening of March 10 last. The
hearing was called lo "discuss" the repeal of A.J.K. 20
I he world government resolution.
Among the forces urging repeal were that hysterical
Kioup of dehydrated she-goats, the DAK; the patriotic
American Legion and the VFW; Myron Faga/i, one
ol Gerald L. K. Smith's playmates (according to the
t'hristian Science Monitor); an ex-KKK leader; and
although 1 hate further to satisfy his ego with more
publicity- our own Bob Davis. Such was the company
Davis chose to identify himself with.
While he did not resort to the wild, emotional bray
ings his colleagues used, what Davis .said was impor
tant in that fie announced himself as a Stanfor d stu
dent and implicitly represented the majority thoughts
ol the student body. Davis claimed that the students

liiid lost interest in the world government concept and
cited the statistical decline of the Student federalists ]
as evidence. If the former is true â€”that Stanford stu- j
dents are no longer interested in world government, :
then it seems to me that this institution has failed to a |
large degree in one of its prime purposes: the further- j
ing of the feeling of the brotherhood of man, through
knowledge and understanding of others, and at the ex- i
pense of racial doctrines, nationalism, provincialism, j
etc. When the Bob Davises and their ilk become ;
spokesmen for students, then either the first hypothe- ;
sis is true or a shameful apathy has overcome us in
our chrome-and-ivory towers. Perhaps both are par
tially true.
Nevertheless, at least 10 Stanford students, plus!
wives, and alumni, were present that night in the }
Senate gallery, and they hardly shared the views of
Davis, (lagan, the DAK, etc. What I want to know is 1
whether they represent the views of the Stanford stu
dents on the most vital of all issues or does Bob Davis? j
