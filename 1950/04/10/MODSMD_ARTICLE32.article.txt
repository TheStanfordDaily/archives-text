WASHINGTON, April 9 (/P)—Ra
dar and civilian airplane spotting
networks are far enough along to
give this country at least some in
surance against another Pearl Har
bor, military officials reported to
day.
The Defense Department already
is operating radar outposts around
the clock and more will be set up.
And Ly the end of the summer it
hopes to have ItiO.OOO civilians re
cruited and trained to maintain a
lookout if war appears near.
Alarm systems also have been in
stalled which can flash an alert to
Aii Force interceptor squadrons
and civilian warning centers within
a matter oi seconds.
Ail these moves are simply pre
paredness, the officials stressed, and
do not indicate any belief that any
actual need of these defenses is im
ii linent.
Aw Force officials say more than
200 warning centers are hooked up
nov/ and many more will be even
tually. The centers, picked by gov
ernors and mayors, are spots like
police and fire headquarters in key
cities, where somebody will be
handy all the time to man special
red telephones equipped with yel
low, blue, red, and white lights.
To hurry calls through, a priori
ties arrangement has been worked
out with the telephone companies.
The various colored lights are for
the various degrees of alerts. Yel
low means the size of a possible raid
isn't known yet, but it might de
velop in perhaps an hour. Blue is a
lfj-minute warning. Ked means a
raid is imminent, maybe within eight
minutes. White is "all clear."
The Defense Department is en
rolling volunteer plane spotters be
cause radar has its limitations. It is
ineffective against planes hugging
the ground or flying on the far sid*
of ridges.
