# Good Job Chances Forecast in Health Fields; Law, B.A. Opportunities Scarce
## 
### 
An optimistic picture in some
job fields, such as medicine,
dentistry and specialized health
fieLds, and a less bright one in
others, such as law, business ad
; ministration and journalism, is
foreseen by the United States
Department of Labor, according
! to a report issued last week in
Washington.
Seniors who will graduate this
.spring will Ik* mcml>ers of the largest

graduating class in the history of
United States collegiate education,
totaling possibly half a million, the
report said.
Fewer Openings
Intensifying the competition for
jobs is the likelihood that, there will
be fewer job openings for new college
graduates this year than there were
in iy4B and 194 U.

The job outlook, characterized by
the Labor Department as generally
good, is, however, complicated by
three factors: the large number of
graduates who will be seeking jobs;
j a small increase in the total number
of unemployed persons; and the tilling
J of war-created shortages of college
| graduates in .some specialized fields
j by the large graduating classes of the
j last two years.
The report indicated that employ
ment is growing more rapidly in the
West Coast, in the South Atlantic re
gion, and in Texas, than in other areas
of the country. However, the supply
of workers in areas such as the West
Coast has increased more rapidly
than job opportunities.
't he situations in specific job areas
differ widely, according to the De-
I partment. For example, in teaching,
.

there is, at the same time, a shortage
of personnel in elementary schools
and a growing oversnpply at the high
school level.
Stiff competition for jobs is ex
pected in the fields of law, journal
ism, personnel work, business admin- ;
istration, and accounting.
Brighter Prospects
Liberal arts graduates with work
experience or specialized training
will find it easier to get jobs than
those with only a general under- i
graduate education, the Department i
says.
Brighter prospects are seen by the j
report for graduates in medicine, |
dentistry, and nursing and in spe- |
cialized health fields such as veter- j
inarians, medical laboratory techni- |
cians, physical tlierapists, and dieti- j
dans.

Stiff competition for jobs is ex
pected in the fields of law, journal
ism, personnel work, business admin- ;
istration, and accounting.
Brighter Prospects
Liberal arts graduates with work
experience or specialized training
will find it easier to get jobs than
those with only a general under- i
graduate education, the Department i
says.
Brighter prospects are seen by the j
report for graduates in medicine, |
dentistry, and nursing and in spe- |
cialized health fields such as veter- j
inarians, medical laboratory techni- |
cians, physical tlierapists, and dieti- j
dans.

An optimistic picture in some
job fields, such as medicine,
dentistry and specialized health
fieLds, and a less bright one in
others, such as law, business ad
; ministration and journalism, is
foreseen by the United States
Department of Labor, according
! to a report issued last week in
Washington.
Seniors who will graduate this
.spring will Ik* mcml>ers of the largest

graduating class in the history of
United States collegiate education,
totaling possibly half a million, the
report said.
Fewer Openings
Intensifying the competition for
jobs is the likelihood that, there will
be fewer job openings for new college
graduates this year than there were
in iy4B and 194 U.

The job outlook, characterized by
the Labor Department as generally
good, is, however, complicated by
three factors: the large number of
graduates who will be seeking jobs;
j a small increase in the total number
of unemployed persons; and the tilling
J of war-created shortages of college
| graduates in .some specialized fields
j by the large graduating classes of the
j last two years.
The report indicated that employ
ment is growing more rapidly in the
West Coast, in the South Atlantic re
gion, and in Texas, than in other areas
of the country. However, the supply
of workers in areas such as the West
Coast has increased more rapidly
than job opportunities.
't he situations in specific job areas
differ widely, according to the De-
I partment. For example, in teaching,
.

there is, at the same time, a shortage
of personnel in elementary schools
and a growing oversnpply at the high
school level.

pected in the fields of law, journal
