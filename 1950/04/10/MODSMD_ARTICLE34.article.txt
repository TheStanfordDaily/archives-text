						Hundred Candidates Expected to Turn Out for Spring Football Practice Today
## Fullback Slot Due For Big Shuffle 
### AL BERRY 
Nearly 100 pacltled Stanford gric
aspirants will parade before th<
eager eye of Couch Marchmon
fMarchie) Schwartz and staff toduj
at 4 p.m. as the first of 30 shot;
in the 1950 spring war games is firec
away.
Back to lead the fold will be £
handful of the first 22 who made uj.
the oft ensive and defensive platoon;
ot the '49 Big Game. Quarterback;
Gary Kerkorian and Dick Horn wit
ugain be vying for the thinker posi
tion, with soph Joe St. Geme try
ing to work in a toe-hold, with tht
now junior soph greats. With Harrv
(the Hipster, Hoopster, Batsterj
Hugusian passing over the spring
session in favor of baseball, Boyc
Benson and Eric Southwood will be
lilling the halfback spots. Benson
who looked like an All-Americar
against Michigan, and Southwood
who scored the one that didn'i
count against Cal last year, wil
probably go a long way to ware
making themselves permanent lix
tures in the half spot for next fall's
crusade.
I'llllhack Shuffle
The big backfield shuffle wil
come at the fullback spot, where
tne Cards will be suffering then
heaviest graduation loss. With
Mitchell, De Young, and Klein
three very good boys, out of action
halfback Bobby White will be
moved over to the two-back spot
for at least part of the spring ses
sion. Also fighting for the middle
man post will be halfback Holy Bo
ruck, frosh ace Skip Crist, and lull
back Bob Griffin.
The switching of White to full wil]
give the Cards a small (175) full
back, but one who can do a very
creditable job of running, blocking
and passing. Boruck is a hard run
ner and may improve blocking-wise
enough to take over the spot entire
come fall. Crist was the frosh team
captain last year and was easily the
best back the yearlings had. But
he suffered a knee injury against
the Brubabes last fall, and may have
some coming-back to do. Griffin
who was number four full last year,
showed a lot of promise. He's big,
surprisingly fast, and hits hard.
Veterans at End
Back at the wing spots this spring
will be three of the best ends on
the coast: Bill McColl, Bruce Van
Alstyne, and Jack Rye. McColl, who
is already being boomed for All -
America, was a top-Hight offensive
man last season as well as a defen
sive tackle. He will probably spend
this spring being groomed to play
defensive end instead of the tackle
spot. Bruce Van Alstyne, who was
first - string defense last fall, will
probably take over the offensive
end spot and may learn the secrets
of being a defensive halfback. Jack
Rye, when he wasn't benched by
injuiies, was one of the best defen
sive ends on the coast and wil!
spend the spring getting better.
At tackle, Gordy (Tex) White
and Wts Poulson will be the only
two returning veterans, with Co-
Captain A 1 Rau and Hal Walker
getting ready to meet the cold,
cruel world. Chuck Hokanson, best
remembered as the. kick-off man,
will be confining his talents prima
rily to putting shots for the track
team. John Broderick. Jim Vick,
Ken Downey, and Carter Py!e, four
big lads from So. Cal., will also be
making their first varsity bid for
glory at the tackle position.
At guard, defensive ace Jess Cone,

! who was the best lineman on the
field in the USC tilt, and Dick Lu
: cas, who was a fine offensive guard
last fall, will be the two top con
j tenders. Also at guard is Russ Pom
: eroy — whose main shine is line
backing — who may be moved
around to bolster any weaknesses.
Top contenders from the frosh will
be Norm Manoogian and Tom Ro
mano, who did a fine duet for last
year's yearlings.
Weak at Center
With the exception of fullback, it
is the center spot that will show
i the greatest weakness this spring.
! With Co-Captain Jim Castagnoli
sans eligibility and Gordon Rice still
in his Big Game cast, veteran Dick
Abraham will be the only letterman
present in the pivot post. Expected
to aid the Bear will be Brave cen
| ter Doug Thamer and freshman Cal
| Cottrell.
And do we have coaches? Posi
tively. Within the green fence to
| assist Coach Schwartz this spring
will be regulars Phil Bengtson, Ray
Hammett, and Mai Elward. Making
his last appearance under Stanford
j colors will be the new "49er line
coach Chuck Taylor, and aiding him
will be the new frosh coach Bob
Ghilotti. And back for his second
! post-war spring season will be a
quarterback coach named Frank C.
Albeit, who used to play football
here years ago. Also helping out
will be the o!d pro, Emery Mitchell.
| Mitch's main function in the spring
j session will be teaching the numer
ous fullback candidates how to
1 place opposing ends upon their
backsides.
Oh yes, it's spring and football is
here again. Very exciting stuff with
the autumn campaigns against the

Trojans, the Cadets, the Bruins, and
the Bears at least in sight. But for
the 10U or so varsity grid candidates
it may be more exhausting than ex
! citing. Spring is a time for funda
j mentals and hard work, not for
j glory. Which is just about as pro
| found as we care to get today.


SPRING WAR GAME COMMANDER, Marchie Schwartz, will
greet nearly 100 football aspirants today at 4 as the first of 30
spring football practices gets under way. Helping Schwartz
will be coaches Bengtson, Hammett, Taylor, Ghilotti, Elward,
Albert, and Mitchell.
