# Stanford Linksters Lose Intercollegiate Matches
## 
### 
The Stanford golf team suffered a
rough weekend at Pasatiempo as
only two of the Indians' eight quali
fiers survived the first round in the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Golf Championship.
Bob Crozier was ousted in the
second round by Menlo's Bill Tay
lor, who also knocked off Bud Moe
in the first round. Sophomore Dick
McElyea won two matches before
bowing to Andy Blossom of COP on
the 21st hole.
The two finalists are both San ;
Jose State golfers. Warren Mc-
Carty, two-year Spartan letterman, I
and George Bruno, ex-St. Mary's
linkster, will battle it out for the
championship next Saturday.
Taylor and Blossom were the
tournament's two upsetters. Tay
lor, the Arizona state champion
who is prepping for Stanford, de
feated Stanford's top two men with
liitle difficulty. He disposed of Moe
4 and 3, and smashed Crozier 6 and
5. Taylor was finally edtfed by Mc-
Carty, last year's runner-up to Al
Nelson.
Blossom pulled the biggest upset j
by edging Ken Venturi, San Fran- i

Cisco city champion, 1 up in the first
round. Blossom was forced into
overtime before he defeated McEl
yea. The Stanford youngster bir
died the 17th and 18th in a valiant
effort to win. Blossom was also
eliminated by McCarty.
Stanford's eight qualifiers includ
ed Cully Ingram, John Wallace,
Keith Beekman, Dave Lamson,
Corky Grahma, besides McElyea,
Moe, and Crozier.
