# Card Track Team Looks For Clear Sky In L.A.
## 
### 
A heavy downpour in Los Ange- i
les Saturday caused a postponement
in the scheduled track meet be
tween Stanford and USC. The meet ;
was tentatively scheduled for this j
afternoon at 3:30 if the Southern
California sun should dry the Coli
seum track sufficiently.
First reports indicated only a i
slight chance for clearing skies.
However, the latest weather report
from Southern California indicates |
that it will be mostly clear Monday
unci warmer. On the hope that the
meet will be run, the Stanford plane I

reservations were switched to an
eight o'clock plane out of I,os An
geles tonight.
11 the meet docs not go today the
whole thing will probably be can
celed, although there is some pos
sibility that it could be scheduled
later in the season instead of one of
the relays or even mixed in with
the USC-California meet.
The rains could provide Stanford
with the "big break" if Cardinal
iron man Gay Bryan could get his
leg in shape in time for a resched
uled meet.
