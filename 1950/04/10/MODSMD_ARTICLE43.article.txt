A NEW YORK newspaperman struggles through a cascade of
water pouring down a stairway on the 12th floor of New York's
Woolworth building in Lower Manhattan on his way to cover
the fire which burned out part of the 23rd floor of the building—
once the city's highest structure and a mecca for tourists for
nearly 40 years. It is a 60-story building. —AP Wirephoto
