# Fifty-Best List Includes Two Stanford Books
## 
### 
Two books printed by the Stan- j
I ford University Press are among I
the Fifty Books of the Year selected '
recently by the American Institute
of Graphic Aits in New York.
The books are "Native Arts of the J
j Northwest" by Robert Tyler Davis
I and "San Francisco Kaleidoscope"
j by Samuel Dickson. They were se
lected on the basis of excellence of
design, typography, quality of man
: ufacturc, and the designer's inter
! pretation of the text.
j Because of the Institute's require
ment of six copies of each entry,
most California printers were un
able to participate in the competi
tion. Only one other book from a j
West Coast printer was included in j
the selection.
