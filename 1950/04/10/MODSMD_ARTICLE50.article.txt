# Fossil Shells Preserved as Opal Are Newest Additions to Stanford's Paleontology Collection
## 
### 
Two rare and beautiful additions
to the Stanford shell collection â€” '
fossil shells preserved as opal, have
been made recently, it was an
nounced recently by Dr. Myra
Keen, curator of the collection.
The (>0- to 100-million-year-old j
shells, a clam and a snail in which j
the shell material has been replaced

by opal, were the gift of Giles W. .
Mead of Beverly Hills, a Stanford
graduate last year. They were from i
a collection made by Mead's father, |
the late G. W. Mead.
They are found only in one local
ity in New South Wales, Australia,
and then only under certain condi
tions which allow the shell material
to be replaced a little at a time by
the brilliantly colored opal.
Dr. Keen said the specimens are
"a scientific rarity," and have more
scientific than monetary value.
The shells share an exhibit case j
with a collection of real and arti
ficial pearls in the shell collection ;
museum on the third floor of the
School of Mineral Sciences Build-

I ing. The museum is open to the
public without charge, daily from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Another item in the display is
Cavolina shells, known familiarly
as sea bubbles or sea butterflies,
which float on the surface of the
water and look like a tiny translu
cent bubble mounted on a dainty
sled.
