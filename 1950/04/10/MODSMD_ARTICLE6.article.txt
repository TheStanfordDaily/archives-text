VATICAN CITY—Pope Pius XII
pleaded in a tremendous Holy Year
Easter celebration today for a rc
turn to the spirit of the gospel and
.social justice.
Only then, he told hundreds of
thousands of Roman Catholic pil
grims from many nations, can there
arise for the whole world "the har
mony of order."
An estimated 50.000 Holy Year
visitors filled St. Peter's Basilica as
the Pontiff spoke in a firm, strong
voice. Another 450,000 —mostly Ro
mans—stood in St. Peter's Square
and heard his words, spoken in
Latin, from a battery of loudspeak
ers that poured forth the almost
three-hour program.
