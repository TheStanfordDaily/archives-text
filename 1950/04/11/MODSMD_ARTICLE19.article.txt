The glow of the footlights, tin
smell of grease paint, the whisper of
"Curtain going up!" and, possibly,
fame. That's what Ram's Mead

flair for dramatics.
Traditionally, Ram's Mead Board
produces the fall quarter Gaieties,
the winter One-Act Plays, and the

now with the Straw Mat Review,
got their start.

a dramatic society for men only.

Masquers, The Barnstormers, and
Sword and Sandals, handled oth

into one society called The Stagers
