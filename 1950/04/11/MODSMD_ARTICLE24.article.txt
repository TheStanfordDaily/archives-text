# Bridges Given Prison Term
## Union Aides Sentenced to 2 Years; Longshore Leader Out on Bail 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 10 (AP) Harry Bridges, CIO lonq
shore boss, was sentenced today to five years' imprisonment for
perjury and two years for conspiracy because he lied to conceal
i the fact that he was a Communist.
The Australian born West Coast union leader was ordered into

â– immediate custody but when $25,000
bail was set it was supplied.
Two union aides who testified at
hi:; 1945 citizenship hearing and
were convicted with Bridges of
conspiring to commit perjury were
each sentenced to two years' im
prisonment.
Bridges, stormy petrel of Pacific
Coast waterfront strife, was given
five years for perjury and two year:,
for conspiracy, to be served con
currently.
Sentencing followed Judge George
B. Harris' denial of defense motions
that the 81-day trial be reversed
and judgment arrested. The defense
in all-day arguments had contended
the judge was biased and the trial
conducted on a political and patri
otic basis.
Sentencing of two union aides foi
conspiring with Bridges as wit
nesses at his citizenship hearing
was delayed by a dispute over bail
for Bridges.
Judge Harris, in passing sentence
on Bridges, key man in paralyzing
port strikes over the past two dec
ades, said the government had
proved "Bridges lied in his natu
validation proceedings when he de
nied membership in the Communist
party."
"His guilt was established to a
moral certainty and beyond reason
able doubt by devastating and
overwhelming testimony," added
the judge concerning a man who
twi<-e before had beaten back gov
ernment efforts to deport him as a
Communist.
"It has been charged that the ver
diet was the result of hysteria oi
errors on the part of the court,"the
judge added, "or that it represents
an oblique attack on militant union
ism, or some alleged external pres
sure exerted by the United State:;
government or its department..
"These charges represent distor
tion of fact, misconceptions, and un
truths.
"I say the verdicts are fair and
just. The verdicts will stand as a
courageous decision on (he part of
an intelligent jury. .
"They will serve as a lasting me
morial that the integrity of the nat
uralization laws of these United
States must be upheld."
