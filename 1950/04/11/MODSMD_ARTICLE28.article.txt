# Immaturity Unlimited
## 
### 
It looks as if the level of maturity, or rather
immaturity, represented by the "typical" Stan
ford undergraduate has at last regressed to the
norm.
The conduct at the Sunday Evening Movie
this week made it guite clear that we are collec
tively little more than thoughtless, crass ado
lescents with slight chance of ever learning to
understand when "enough is enough."
We all enjoy going to the Mem Aud on a
Sunday evening, where v/e ean share raucous,
often lunny, comments about the picture. V/e

attend the movie expecting this.
But cluttering the Mem Aud with paper, ex
ploding firecrackers, and sounding horns ac
complishes nothing in the way of stimulating
the average sense of humor. The mulaHve
effect of this sort of by-play is to provide un
necessary labor for the auditorium staff, to
create a fire-hazard, and to annoy.
Needless to say, a continuance of these prac
tices will bring an end to Sunday Evening
Movies. In fact, it may be too late now.
Or does anyone care?
