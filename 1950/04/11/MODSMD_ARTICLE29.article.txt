# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
1 walked briskly onto Quad, smiled a great big
I'.xoom snule hitched up my belt, and fixed my eyes
on the oncoming traffic.
I had waited lor this moment wilh a l.'oble girl's
eagerness. My teeth had just been cleaned by the best

dentist in Mayneld, my cheeks
were as smooth as a ten-dollar
bottle of Scotch, my eyes were
bright with anticipation, and, to
put it bluntly, I was ready.
"HELLO," 1 said earnestly to the
In ;l person I met.
She was looking the olhei way.
"HELLO," 1 said to the second
pel SOU.
He was looking at his feel.
I decided to let the next few
pei\«,ons pass without the strain.

hut then I .saw a girl whom I'd once laughed it up with
hi Abnormal Psychology.
"HELLO," I tried again.
She walkvd halfway to the nexl classroom before
topping. (No Stanford girl would go all the way.)
Arrg, she yelled back ovei her shouldei (That's
an expression we used for greeting back in the old
Abnormal Psych days. It's sort of simple, and yet dis
l met i Ve.)
Somehow 1 didn't gel much of a kick out ol saying
hello that way. I was looking for something new. Isut

at least her friendly salutation served as a sliut in the
arm lor my drooping ego.
"HELLO," I began right away with newly-found
energy.
"Whuttaya doing, running for office?" was Ihe fit- t
answer.
"Ease-up," was the second.
"Settle-down," was the third.
"Drop dead" finally finished me.
I staggered to the steps of Cubberley And and
slumped down between two Education majors who
were trying to change their programs because Mental
Hygiene was too tough for them.
1 was pu/./.led. Wasn't this Hello Day, Stanford's
famous day of friendly faces, friendly greetings, and
friendly handshakes? What was I to think? How was
this tradition supposed to work?
And then 1 developed some insight into the problem.
A Deke was walking by and I heard him mutter, "Who
the hell wants to go back to the farm- I'm heading for
the Bandbox."
Well, this all happened last year on Hello Day. Hut
this time I'm taking no chances, I'm staying in bed.
As Longfellow said, "Hello Days may come and
Hello Days may go, but I'll be damned if I'll speak
first to a snobbish schtnoe."
It's not much of a poem, but there's plenty of prin
ciple. Personally, I'm saving myself for the run for
Kossott's on Olympic Day.

And then 1 developed some insight into the problem.
A Deke was walking by and I heard him mutter, "Who
the hell wants to go back to the farm- I'm heading for
the Bandbox."
Well, this all happened last year on Hello Day. Hut
this time I'm taking no chances, I'm staying in bed.
As Longfellow said, "Hello Days may come and
Hello Days may go, but I'll be damned if I'll speak
first to a snobbish schtnoe."
It's not much of a poem, but there's plenty of prin
ciple. Personally, I'm saving myself for the run for
Kossott's on Olympic Day.

1 walked briskly onto Quad, smiled a great big
I'.xoom snule hitched up my belt, and fixed my eyes
on the oncoming traffic.
I had waited lor this moment wilh a l.'oble girl's
eagerness. My teeth had just been cleaned by the best

dentist in Mayneld, my cheeks
were as smooth as a ten-dollar
bottle of Scotch, my eyes were
bright with anticipation, and, to
put it bluntly, I was ready.
"HELLO," 1 said earnestly to the
In ;l person I met.
She was looking the olhei way.
"HELLO," 1 said to the second
pel SOU.
He was looking at his feel.
I decided to let the next few
pei\«,ons pass without the strain.

hut then I .saw a girl whom I'd once laughed it up with
hi Abnormal Psychology.
"HELLO," I tried again.
She walkvd halfway to the nexl classroom before
topping. (No Stanford girl would go all the way.)
Arrg, she yelled back ovei her shouldei (That's
an expression we used for greeting back in the old
Abnormal Psych days. It's sort of simple, and yet dis
l met i Ve.)
Somehow 1 didn't gel much of a kick out ol saying
hello that way. I was looking for something new. Isut

at least her friendly salutation served as a sliut in the
arm lor my drooping ego.
"HELLO," I began right away with newly-found
energy.
"Whuttaya doing, running for office?" was Ihe fit- t
answer.
"Ease-up," was the second.
"Settle-down," was the third.
"Drop dead" finally finished me.
I staggered to the steps of Cubberley And and
slumped down between two Education majors who
were trying to change their programs because Mental
Hygiene was too tough for them.
1 was pu/./.led. Wasn't this Hello Day, Stanford's
famous day of friendly faces, friendly greetings, and
friendly handshakes? What was I to think? How was
this tradition supposed to work?
