## Locals Set for Fourth League Win With Santa Clara This Afternoon 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Joe Chez pitched Stanford into a
(irst-place tie with St. Mary's yes
terday afternoon as the Indians
downed California 4 to 3 on the
Berkeley campus. In so doing the
Cards tacked the first CIBA loss of
the season on the Bears and pushed
them back into third place in league
standings, hall a game behind Stan
ford and St. Mary's.
During the seven innings that he
worked, Chez had the Bear hitters
well under control, except for th"
fifth frame, when Cal put together
three consecutive singles to score
two runs. Chez struck out six men,
allowed live base hits, and six bases
on balls before he was lifted for
"Fireman" Dave Stott in the eighth
frame.
Bears Score First
The Bears drew first blood in
their half of the first inning, when
Don Dodson gained life on a field
er's choice, stole second, and went
on to third when the ball went into
tl«t- outfield as the Indians tried to
catch his steal. Dodson came on in
to score when Dick Clegg lost his
looting in an attempt to lield a slow
roller down the first base line off
the bat of Syl McNinch.
Stanford came back to tie up the
ball game in the third when Bud
Klein drew a base on balls and ;
moved to second as Dave Melton j
blasted a line drive at the Cal third
baseman, which he couldn't handle. 1
Dick Clegg then drove Klein in
with the first Indian tally of the
fame by driving a sharp single into
center field.
Chez Stops Rally
California scored its final runs of
the game in the fifth frame after one
was out as Dodson walked and
scored from first on an error after
Jerry Silverstein's base hit into
light field. Silverstein checked in
with the Bears' third run on two

more singles. Chez, then struck out
the next batter and got the third
man out on a fly ball to left field to
i and the Bear rally.
The Cards picked up the three
deciding runs in the seventh frame,
when the tiring Cal chucker, Andy
Stagnaro, walked Bill Herron and
Chez, the first two men to face him.
Stagnaro bore down, getting the
next two men out, but Charlie Cole
came through with a smashing
double into left field to score Her
ron and Chez. Coel came on around
with the clincher when the Bear
left fielder let the ball get by him
and could not retrieve it in time to
catch the flying Cole.
