# SC Routs Spikemen In South
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, April 10 —
Coach Jess Hill took the wraps off
his 1950 University of Southern J
California track and field team to- !
day and the defending NCAA
champions rolled over a crippled I
Stanford squad by a 95 5/6 to
35 1/(5 score.
The lads of Troy, competing in
this Pacific Coast Conference open- ;
ing dual affair, swept Stanford in j
four events —the mile, two - mile,
low hurdles, and broad jump.
The Indians, unable to whip USC ,
since 1933, came to town lacking the
services of its all-around star ath- j
lete, Gay Bryan. Bryan conceivably
could have scored 20 or more points
and changed the entire complexion {
of the meet.
Only Three Firsts
As it was, the Cards scored only (
three firsts—Otis Chandler leading j
his mates to a sweep in the shot i
put, Pitch Johnson winning the |
quarter - mile run, and Bud Held
taking the javelin throw.
No meet records were broken but
several surprises cropped up.
Johnson's win in the 440 was at 1
the expense of Trojan Bob Cham
bers. Johnson's time was 48.8 sec
onds, and Chambers' familiar come
from-behind run lacked the steam
to overhaul the Stanford runner.
The two put on a better duel run- j
ning the anchor lap in the relay, j
however. Chambers had a good lead ,
taking the bat on but lost most of !
it in the exchange. Then Johnson i
caught and passed him, but Cham- ;
bers rallied in the final 100 yards '
and hit the tape first.
Single outstanding performance !
was by Trojan Sam Innes, who
hurled the discus 164 feet 11 l /i |
inches, the best of his career.
Cards Fail in Sprints
Stanford, expected to dominate
the sprints, failed in both. Little A 1
Mejia won the 100-yard dash in a
tight finish with Wilbur Taylor of!
Stanford. The time was 9.9, mark
ing the first time a Trojan had j
cracked 10 seconds this spring.
Johnny Bradley won the 220, with i
Mejia second, and Taylor had to be !
satisfied with third. Bradley's time I
was 21.1 seconds.
The Trojan relay quartette of Bob [
Pruitt, Bud Curry. Norm Stocks. j
and Chambers traveled the mile in i
three minutes 18 seconds, defeating |
Larry Hoff. Cass Bly, Taylor, and
Johnson.
There were no double winners.
