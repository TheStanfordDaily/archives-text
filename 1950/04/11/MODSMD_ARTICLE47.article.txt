# Farm Signs Shanghnessy As Spring Football Coach
## ‘T’ Master Will Arrive Today To Greet Over 100 Grid Hopefuls 
### AL BERRY 
! Clark Shaughnessy. whose coach
ing look Stanford to the Rose Bowl 10
; years ago, signed a contract hero to
serve as advisory coach to Marchie
1 Schwartz for the spring football ses
j sions.
i The return ot the oid "T" master
to (he scene of his previous and per-
I haps his greatest - triumph will have
a distinct old home day flavor.
Marchie Schwartz was the Indian
! backfield coach and Phi! Bengtson
; was head line coach for Shaughnessy
in the fabulous, undefeated days of
yore. Also back this spring to tutor
the quarterbacks will be the powder

j keg quarterback of that Shaughnessy
Wow Boys team, one Frankie Albert,
presently the punch in the '49er of
fense.
Also a Shaughnessy man is Fiosh
Coach (until June) Chuck Taylor,
j who played two years of first string
j guard under the "T"-man, and who
! made all-American the year after
Shaughnessy left. Ray Hammett, now
backfield coach, completes the re
j union. Hammett was a reserve quar
j terback on the Rose Bowl eleven.
Losers Win in '40
| Shaughnessy came to Stanford in
I 1940, when the bottom fell out of
| football at the University of Chicago
! and did the "impossible" when he
j took a team that had not won a con
ference game in 1939, and had won
but one Coast engagement in '38. and
proceeded to blast everyone in sight.
He burned up the Conference (with
the aid of 11 rather sturdy gridsters),
| beating UCLA 20 to 14. Oregon 13 to
0. OSC 28 to 14. Washington 20 to 10.
! USC 21 to 7, and California 13 to 7.
This put"lhe Cards against Nebraska
i in Pasadena on January 1. 1941. The

score, in case you've forgotten, was
21 to 14.
rhc next year the Cards dropped a
pair but were Hose Bow! contenders
until a sudden-death collapse against
Cul in the season finale. This left
I Shaughnessy with a 16-3 record on
the 1' arm for hi:- two years in resi
dence here.
Shaughnessy became available
early this year when, alter giving the
Los Angeles Rams their best season
| to date, he was suddenly dismissed
by Ham owner Dan Reeves. No rea
-1 son was given lor Shaughnessy's re
lease, but most sources attributed the
| 'i't to a "personality conflict" be-

tween the Ram coach and the front
| office brass.
For Spring Only
According to Athletic Director Don
1 Liebendorfer, Shaughnessy's salary
has not yet been fixed. Coach Mar
chie Schwartz, who put together the
i agreement between Stanford and its
tormer Head Man, says that Shaugh
nessy s present plans call for him to
be on the Farm for spring quarter
only, but there has been no release
regarding Shaughnessy's fall plans.
Shaughnessy will arrive on the
! Farm and report for work today.
Spring Practice Today
In the first day of spring practice,
Coach Marchie Schwartz was blessed
with a turnout of some 103 grid hope
fuls. Not satisfied with this round
number, Schwartz said, "l still think
that there is a lot of talent around
Stanford that has not yet appeared.
Newcomers to the spring training
squad will still be welcome."
Frankie Albeit, the quarterback
coach, was not on tap yesterday, but
will make his first spring appearance
'with the sweating Cardinals today.
