# Juniors Help In LD Study
## 
### 
Three hundred and fifty Stanford
juniors have been asked to partici
pate in a program designed to test
the effectiveness of the lower divi
sion program.
A letter has been sent to these
students, selected to give a repre
sentative sample from each major
department, Gary Mills, assistant to
the Lower Division Committee, said.
Each selected student is being
asked to take from 10 to 13 hours of
examinations, for which he will be
paid $1 an hour.
The tests were drawn up by a
faculty committee. Dr. Clarence H.
Faust, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, explained that the results
will he combined with the results
of the national Graduate Record
Examinations, given to all Stanford
juniors last quarter.
The tests arc expected to show up
weaknesses in the present Stanford
lower division program and to point
the way toward improvement, said
the dean.
At a meeting tomorrow at 4 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium, Dean
Faust and Dean of Students Law
rence A. Kimpton will explain the
purpose of 'lie series of tests.
