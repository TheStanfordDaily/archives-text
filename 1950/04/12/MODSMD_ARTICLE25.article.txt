' I
i The fate of the National Students
! Association organization at Stanford
jests in the hand;; of Excom tonight i
when thr Executive Committee j
brings up budget matters.
Jan Robertson, Stanford NSA co
ordinator, said that a full report of j
NSA activities during the past year
I is in the hands of each Excom mem
j ber. Miss Robertson said that she is
also prepared to present NSA's case
before the Executive Committee to
night.
Excom discussion of NSA will
i center around whether or not to
I include the organization in the
i 1950-51 ASSU budget. Last June,
; Excom decided to put NSA on pro
] visional status by including it in j
! the present budget, to see whether j
NSA could be of benefit to Stanford.
Miss Robertson will attempt to
prove tonight that Stanford has
i benefited both locally and nation
. ally by belonging to NSA.
A proposed by-law, introduced
last week, which will set up an
ASSU athletic board exclusive of
the SAC, will be set up for approv
al. The board, if created, would re
view petitions to Excom for major
| sports status and set the criteria
for that status. It would also help
to further Block "S" and Circle "S"
I activities and review letter award
| lists for Excom's approval.
Excom will meet at 7 p.m. in the
I committee room of the Old Union,
i A special budget session will be
; held in the same place tomorrow
| night at 7.
