It seems that 1 can't pick up a newspaper or maga
zine anymore without being reminded that women
are the better sex. 1 should like to plant my size 11
hoes firmly an the bedrock of male dignity and as
sert the belief that guys can tot- almost as good as the
gals if they try real hard. Since women have burrowed
their way mto places that were once masculine domain,
1 say turnabout is fair play. What has happened to
the guy at a wedding? From reading marriage stories,
you are never quite sure that he was there at all, so
here is a column devoted to the forgotten fixture at
weddingsâ€”the bridegroom. ,
;ft * *
'J'he Little Church Around the Corner war. the set
ting last week, for the marriage of Reginald Wiffins
and his fiance, some young lady or othei. We didn't
quite get the name. The fragrant odor of flowers com
mon to funerals and marriages was present. Reggie,
as his close friends call him, is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Archibald Wiffins, a prominent, family from Wild
(loose, Calif, Reggie comes from a long line of married
men, a factor which should aid him considerably in
adjusting to married life.
'fhe bridegroom was pushed into marriage by some
matronly woman who, it is rumored, is the mother of
the bride, Reggie, as is the custom for young bride
grooms, wore "something old, something new, some
thing borrowed, something blue." "Something old" is
the story he kept hearing from his fiance about not.
postponing their marriage any longer. "Something
new" is the sudden realization that he won't be able

to have a friendly game of poker with that old gang
of Ins anymore. "Something borrowed" are the trou
sers loaned him by his father. That they were too
large was apparent by the manner in which he
clutched at his waist throughout the ceremony. And
"something blue" are the years of married life he has
to look forward to.
The groom wore a mourning coat daintily spat
tered with spots of catsup, the front was pleated due
to negligence on the presser's part. The edges of the
lapels were trimmed with fray from long usage, and
the collar coyly pressed against iiis neck shutting off
the blood from his head, lie wore a pair of matching
shoes done up brightly with imported shoe polish. In
his lapel rested a boutonniere equipped to send out a
.stream of water at, inquisitive guests.
Preceding the groom down the aisle was the best
man, Harry Sedgers, who did not come to life until
cocktails were served later at the reception held in
the back room of a local billiard parlor. He wore the
usual expression of a man who sees his best friend go
to the firing squad first. A rose was coyly fixed behind
his ear. When the bouquet was thrown from the stair
case, all the men in the room scattered madly, rushing
for every conceivable exit.
Reggie was graduated from Stanford University
where he attended classes and i.s remembered for hav
ing dunked himself in the library fountain early one
morning. The wedding and reception were a huge
success, as can be attested by the unanimous groan
from the best man and ushers the morning alter.
The bride also attended.
