Bull Session's going straight this morning, so if
you're looking for something funny, read the edits.
They'll kill you.
Right now, spring football is under way, and football
luJk is being passed back and forth under the hot sun

just like it was three weeks past
September and really time to start.
Actually, spring grid action,
filled with fundamentals and
â– ,weat, doesn't make for inspiring
subject matter for the run-of-the
mill, hick-time football filbert.
But this time, with 2(5 returning
lettermen bulging into the ball
park, the third straight unde
feated frosh. upped to the big tent,
and with a pack of coaches that
would make even USC drool, in-

t>-rest is as high as Hoover Tower on blocks.
TTie immediate problem at hand, they say. is to pick
up some power in the fullback and center slots, which
have been slightly battered to pieces by graduation
and other assorted quirks of fate. These two prob
lems we will discuss, just like good, honest filberts.
The center position appears to be better off than
most people will admit. Dick Abraham will be plenty
olid on the offensive bide, and if JC transfer Mod Gar
ner lives up to his Compton clippings, Dick will have
tune to pick up a few minutes rest from time to time.
That could be enough.
As for fullback, the cause seems really dc perate as

they say. Schwartz has shifted Boh White to full to
ease tlte pain caused hy the complete washout of that
department. But, he'll probably be switching the
White Flash right back if hobbling Holy Boruck turns
up healthy. Boruck was bothered all last season with
a pair of fat ankles, but he's looking like his old self
at the moment, and that's pretty good news.
Skip Crist, the frosh full, might not be able to offer
much aid, as his knee is still in a brace. So, the full
back problem is a real one. Using Bob White here
means weakening the strong right-half spot, and
maybe White's 175 pounds won't be enough to handle
the change.
There are a few other little items which Schwartz
and stuff will be attempting to smooth over. Such as
the loss of the entire right side of the line, the absence
of defensive backs, Dave Field and Ken Peck, no
slippery Rupe Andrews, no Ken Rose, and no A 1
Laakso. But, as pointed out earlier, there is quite a
crew present from which to draw the answers.
But, filling these gaps will be enough to work on
for awhile, so the men will use only eight basic plays,
keep things close to the belt, and will work from the
bottom up.
The coaches say that all they want to do this spring
is pick out the top 1G or 20 players. They're not even
thinking about September. Right now, it's spring and
the sun is shining.
But watch your step, that poor guy sitting next to
you might be out for spring ball. God, what a horrible
way to spend a sunny afternoon.
See ya at inter-squad scrimmage.
