## In Answer to Gil Jonas 
### 
To the Editor:
While discretion dictates that I should perhaps re
main silent in the face of a controversy which does
not immediately concern me, I am nevertheless forced
to respond to the vicious, untrue, pusillanimous, scur
rilous, libelous, asinine, and unfounded attacks made
against Bob Davis and several other patriotic indi
viduals and organizations by a character assassin in
The Stanford Daily of today, who calls him' -If Gil
Jonas,
1 shall say to brother Jonas that 1, too, happened to
be in attendance at the lecent joint committee
of Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, the resolution which
would take California off record as being in favor of
world government.
Perhaps, in fact, 1 was om> of those 10 Stanford stu
dents to whom Brother Jonas referred to in paragraph
live of his ill-considered smear attack, character as
sassination and otherwise evil letter, and while I did
not happen to be sitting in the Senate gallery, I was
quite able to see and hear as much as or more than
brother Jonas or his Sacramento spies from my seat
on the Senate Hoor.
In the first place, I can see no reason why Brother
Jonas should question the committee hearing as he
does In his letter by placing quotation marks around
the word "discuss."
1 think that everyone who attended the committee
hearing will readily agiee that the question of world
government was given fully ample consideration and
that both factions addressing the committee on the
pending resolution were dealt with fairly and justly.
I am further certain lhat no one will deny that every
i oncelvable merit arid demerit of world government
and its implications was discussed in detail. Appar
ently Brothei Jonas was dissatisfied with the conduct
or with the outcome of the hearing or with the demo
cratic procedure used in staging the committee heal -
ing because there is a certain inference of that dissat
isfaction in his letter.
It is regrettable that Brother Jonas chose to include
in his attack an indictment of not only Myron C.
Gagun, Bob Davis, and the Daughters of the American
Revolution, but. also the American the Vet
erans of Foreign Wars, and practically every Repub
lican oiganization in the State.
There won't be much love for Brother Jonas among
lhe veterans of California when they read his vicious
remarks about their fraternal organizations; and of
ihe ten million or more Califomians, the few remain
ing Republicans will certainly be displeased with

Brother Jonas' scathing inferences about them, their
character, and their integrity.
I might further add that Brother Jonas' damnable
accusation that Myron C. Fagan, noted lecturer and
author on world government and its demerits, is or
was a "playmate of Gerald L. K. Smith," is false. Mr.
Fagan has been forced to enter suit against the origina
tors of that untruth, so I would suggest to Brother
Jonas that instead of propagating an unfounded,
guilt-by-assoeiation smear attack, he concentrate in
stead on providing concrete grounds on which we may
base our estimation of Mr. Fagan.
For the sake of the record, when Bob Davis spoke
before the committee, he made it quite clear that he
was speaking as an individual resident and voter of
California and that he was not representing any group
or organization including (he Stanford student body.
This fact was made so clear at the hearing that anyone
with an ounce of intelligence could have drawn no
other conclusion.
I must disagree with Brother Jonas, furthermore, in
his saying that Stanford specializes in indoctrinating
its students v/ith the theories of racial equality, inter
nationalism, and other such bunk.
While I have always said in the light of all of the com
munistic teaching which has permeated many colleges
and universities that if economic necessity did not
compel, I should never set foot in a university; still
Stanford has always impressed me as being a libeia)
school which was largely free of Ihe usual collegiate
tommyrot, and I have always been proud to show my
Stanford student body card.
I presume that Brother Jonas would have us believe
that as at Howard University Stanford teaches its stu
dents that white people descended from Negroes and
that a world state with no immigration restriction is
the only salvation of the people of the world. II
Brother Jonas believes or seriously subscribes to this
nonsense, then I should suggest that he is most egre
jdously mistaken.
In conclusion, I shall say to Brother Jonas that if he
is attempting to represent the viewpoints of every
Stanford student in his insulting letter as being in
favor of world government, then here is one who is
strongly attached to the so-called "nationalistic"
school of thought and who will resist until he is com
mitted to the grave the insidious idea of surrendering
to a potential international dictatorship one ounce of
American sovereignty!

To the Editor:
While discretion dictates that I should perhaps re
main silent in the face of a controversy which does
not immediately concern me, I am nevertheless forced
to respond to the vicious, untrue, pusillanimous, scur
rilous, libelous, asinine, and unfounded attacks made
against Bob Davis and several other patriotic indi
viduals and organizations by a character assassin in
The Stanford Daily of today, who calls him' -If Gil
Jonas,
1 shall say to brother Jonas that 1, too, happened to
be in attendance at the lecent joint committee
of Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, the resolution which
would take California off record as being in favor of
world government.
Perhaps, in fact, 1 was om> of those 10 Stanford stu
dents to whom Brother Jonas referred to in paragraph
live of his ill-considered smear attack, character as
sassination and otherwise evil letter, and while I did
not happen to be sitting in the Senate gallery, I was
quite able to see and hear as much as or more than
brother Jonas or his Sacramento spies from my seat
on the Senate Hoor.
In the first place, I can see no reason why Brother
Jonas should question the committee hearing as he
does In his letter by placing quotation marks around
the word "discuss."
1 think that everyone who attended the committee
hearing will readily agiee that the question of world
government was given fully ample consideration and
that both factions addressing the committee on the
pending resolution were dealt with fairly and justly.
I am further certain lhat no one will deny that every
i oncelvable merit arid demerit of world government
and its implications was discussed in detail. Appar
ently Brothei Jonas was dissatisfied with the conduct
or with the outcome of the hearing or with the demo
cratic procedure used in staging the committee heal -
ing because there is a certain inference of that dissat
isfaction in his letter.
It is regrettable that Brother Jonas chose to include
in his attack an indictment of not only Myron C.
Gagun, Bob Davis, and the Daughters of the American
Revolution, but. also the American the Vet
erans of Foreign Wars, and practically every Repub
lican oiganization in the State.
There won't be much love for Brother Jonas among
lhe veterans of California when they read his vicious
remarks about their fraternal organizations; and of
ihe ten million or more Califomians, the few remain
ing Republicans will certainly be displeased with

Brother Jonas' scathing inferences about them, their
character, and their integrity.
I might further add that Brother Jonas' damnable
accusation that Myron C. Fagan, noted lecturer and
author on world government and its demerits, is or
was a "playmate of Gerald L. K. Smith," is false. Mr.
Fagan has been forced to enter suit against the origina
tors of that untruth, so I would suggest to Brother
Jonas that instead of propagating an unfounded,
guilt-by-assoeiation smear attack, he concentrate in
stead on providing concrete grounds on which we may
base our estimation of Mr. Fagan.
For the sake of the record, when Bob Davis spoke
before the committee, he made it quite clear that he
was speaking as an individual resident and voter of
California and that he was not representing any group
or organization including (he Stanford student body.
This fact was made so clear at the hearing that anyone
with an ounce of intelligence could have drawn no
other conclusion.
I must disagree with Brother Jonas, furthermore, in
his saying that Stanford specializes in indoctrinating
its students v/ith the theories of racial equality, inter
nationalism, and other such bunk.
While I have always said in the light of all of the com
munistic teaching which has permeated many colleges
and universities that if economic necessity did not
compel, I should never set foot in a university; still
Stanford has always impressed me as being a libeia)
school which was largely free of Ihe usual collegiate
tommyrot, and I have always been proud to show my
Stanford student body card.
I presume that Brother Jonas would have us believe
that as at Howard University Stanford teaches its stu
dents that white people descended from Negroes and
that a world state with no immigration restriction is
the only salvation of the people of the world. II
Brother Jonas believes or seriously subscribes to this
nonsense, then I should suggest that he is most egre
jdously mistaken.
In conclusion, I shall say to Brother Jonas that if he
is attempting to represent the viewpoints of every
Stanford student in his insulting letter as being in
favor of world government, then here is one who is
strongly attached to the so-called "nationalistic"
school of thought and who will resist until he is com
mitted to the grave the insidious idea of surrendering
to a potential international dictatorship one ounce of

is attempting to represent the viewpoints of every
Stanford student in his insulting letter as being in
favor of world government, then here is one who is
strongly attached to the so-called "nationalistic"
school of thought and who will resist until he is com
mitted to the grave the insidious idea of surrendering
to a potential international dictatorship one ounce of
American sovereignty!
