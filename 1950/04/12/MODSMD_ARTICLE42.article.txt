# Off-Campus Coeds Sponsor Luncheon
## 
### 
Fifty off-cumpus men will be the
luncheon guests of the Off-Campus
Women in the Women's Clubhouse at
noon today.
The luncheon is the third in a
monthly series through which the
women's group hopes to entertain all
men living off the Farm. The two
groups have worked together on such
activities as the Big Game float.
