### TONIA SCHILLING 
The world is in a turmoil these
days and to some Stanford students
this is a vital personal factor. One
place where the status quo has been
completely upset is China.
To the 35 Stanford students ow
ing allegiance to this country it cre
ates a very real problem. Because
of the crisis in China, many of these
students are now isolated in this
country without any source of fi
nancial aid.
The United States State Depart
ment, at the suggestion of various
American groups interested in for
eign students, has set aside $4,000,-
OUO to aid the.se students in com
pleting their studies in this country.
This money was set aside from the
original sum appropriated by Con
gress as aid to China.
Nineteen of the 35 Chinese stu
dents at Stanford are now receiving
funds covering both tuition and liv
ing expenses from this grant. Due
to this aid these students have been
enabled to finish their course of
studies at Stanford.
In order to be eligible for aid
under this appropriation, the stu
dents had to be enrolled in an
American university during the
school year of 1948-49. At the com
pletion of their studies they are re
quired to return to China.
Before this action by the Stale
Department, the ASSU, through
SIRO, hail provided a fund of $500
to help these students. This fund
was never used because of the State
Department action. It is still avail
able to aid other foreign students
affected by devaluation and other
crises. So fur four Stanford stu
dents have been helped through this
SIRO fund.
