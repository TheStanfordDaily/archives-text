# Nine Agree: 'The Breaks Stopped Us'
## 
### 
There were no tears \o mingle
vvjth the sweat of Stanford's base
ball team yesterday after their 4-2
Joss to the Santa Clara Broncos.
Stripping for showers after a
drawn-out game, Stanford's white
clad team looked more resigned
than unhappy,
"Breaks of the game," was the
comment tossed around the room.
"It really could have gone either
way. *We had our chances, but
niufled them," said one player.
"We played better ball today than
when we beat Santa Clara, in the
last game," declared second-base
man .Tom Shaw, with a towel
around his middle. "But when we
hit tKe ball, we hit it right to a
man. You can't win ball games that
way."
Coach Everett Dean, not discour
aged,, walked from player to player.
"It's the breaks of the game," he
said. "You boys played a good
jÂ»ume."
"You should have hit on that
three-and-one pitch in the eighth,"
f;aid somebody to Charlie Cole.
"Yeah," said Charlie. "I should
have."
Smiling Joe Chez, pitcher who
kept coin pa ny with the bench yes
terday, said, "This is for publica
tion. Today's game was good, but
we've got to get in there and beat
Cal Saturday."
