# SWIM MEET
## Two More Cards Out 
### 
Tom Haynie received another
blow to ihe chances of his varsity
| swimming team against Cal today,
when Ernie Polte and Bruce Put
-1 nam were declared ineligible.
Previously, Ralph Sala, Pete Cole,
and Jack Weeden had met a simi
lar fate. The reason fo;- these sud
den rulings is that the boys didn't
take some of their finals from last
quarter when they were competing
in the National Intercollegiates at
Ohio State.
Haynie states that there is a good
chance of Putnam and Weeden get
ting eligible by presenting notices
that they passed 10 units last quar
ter. the necessary number. How
ever, if these five swimmers don't
swim Saturday morning, the Cal
meet, which looked like a 35-point
pushover for Stanford two weeks
ago, will probably turn into f a one
point victory lor either one ot the
two schools.
The varsity meet will be held
along with the frosh meet this Sat
urday morning at the Encina pools.
Stanford students will be charged
50 cents admission.
