# 'Lefty Jinx' Masters Cards Again; Broncos Win, 4-2
## Indians Skid to Third Spot As Big Bats Remain Silent 
### BILL SWIGART 
The "Lefty Jinx" was again the undoing of Stanford's varsity
baseballers yesterday afternoon, as the Santa Clara Broncos, oper
ating behind the four-hit pitching of southpaw Hal Toso, swept to a
4 to 2 CIBA decision on Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The loss broke Stanford's three-game winning streak, and

dumped the Cards to third in the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association standings.
Toso, who has always been bad
medicine for the Indians to swallow,
was the complete master of the sit
uation yesterfday. He pitched to !
only 29 men, limited the Indians to I
four hits, and was never in trouble j
until the final two innings.
It was "Toso Day" in the field and
at bat too. as slender Hal fielded :
seven chances cleanly, started two j
of Santa Clara's three double plays, !
and batted in the two Bronco runs i
that put therp ahead for keeps in
the filth inning.
Toso is the latest- of a series of
lefthanders who have beaten Stan- ;
ford this year. Despite their pre- J
ponderance of right-handed hitting j
power, the Indians just can't seem
to touch the lefties.
Stanford's pitching, which has
been the team's main strength up
till now, gave way in critical mo
ments yesterday. Nine Broncos pa- i
raded to first base via the base-on
balls route, and two of these walks, j
coupled with three singles to center
field, proved to be starter Jack j
Heinen's undoing in the fatal fifth 1
frame.
Heinen, who gave up all of the i
Broncos' four runs, was replaced j
by Jim Claypoo] in the sixth. Clay
pool wasn't much more effective,
nor was Ed Shive who finished up
in the ninth after Claypool had been
lifted for a pinch hitter.
Behind 4 to 1, the Cards had a
chance to even it up in the eighth
when they loaded the bases on two
walks and an infield error. But J
with the count three and two and j
the runners on the move, Charlie !
Cole grounded to second and the
inning ended before anyone could
score.
In the ninth. Bud Klein grounded
out. Dave Melton slapped his sec
ond single of the game to center, '

Dick Clegg walked, and "Jungle"
Jim Trabucco uncorked a hard-hit
single to right field that scored Mel
ton and sent Clcgg from first to
third. But the Broncos got out with
out further damage as Tom Shaw
grounded into a double play that
ended the game.
All in all, it just wasn't the In
dians' day. They seldom hit the ball
hard, and when they did, it was
usually right at somebody. Santa
Clara, on the other hand,, could do
no wrong. Lady Luck, who was rid
ing the Indians' bench when they
scored their first three league vic
tories, wasn't there yesterday.
The Cards return to action here
tomorrow with a game against the
El Toro Marines. Starting time will
be the usual weekday 13:15. CIBA
play resumes on Saturday as Stan
ford returns to Berkeley for the
second contest within a week
against the University of California.

walks and an infield error. But J
with the count three and two and j
the runners on the move, Charlie !
Cole grounded to second and the
inning ended before anyone could
score.
In the ninth. Bud Klein grounded
out. Dave Melton slapped his sec
ond single of the game to center, '

Dick Clegg walked, and "Jungle"
Jim Trabucco uncorked a hard-hit
single to right field that scored Mel
ton and sent Clcgg from first to
third. But the Broncos got out with
out further damage as Tom Shaw
grounded into a double play that
ended the game.
All in all, it just wasn't the In
dians' day. They seldom hit the ball
hard, and when they did, it was
usually right at somebody. Santa
Clara, on the other hand,, could do
no wrong. Lady Luck, who was rid
ing the Indians' bench when they
scored their first three league vic
tories, wasn't there yesterday.
The Cards return to action here
tomorrow with a game against the
El Toro Marines. Starting time will
be the usual weekday 13:15. CIBA
play resumes on Saturday as Stan
ford returns to Berkeley for the
second contest within a week
against the University of California.

The "Lefty Jinx" was again the undoing of Stanford's varsity
baseballers yesterday afternoon, as the Santa Clara Broncos, oper
ating behind the four-hit pitching of southpaw Hal Toso, swept to a
4 to 2 CIBA decision on Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The loss broke Stanford's three-game winning streak, and

dumped the Cards to third in the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association standings.
Toso, who has always been bad
medicine for the Indians to swallow,
was the complete master of the sit
uation yesterfday. He pitched to !
only 29 men, limited the Indians to I
four hits, and was never in trouble j
until the final two innings.
It was "Toso Day" in the field and
at bat too. as slender Hal fielded :
seven chances cleanly, started two j
of Santa Clara's three double plays, !
and batted in the two Bronco runs i
that put therp ahead for keeps in
the filth inning.
Toso is the latest- of a series of
lefthanders who have beaten Stan- ;
ford this year. Despite their pre- J
ponderance of right-handed hitting j
power, the Indians just can't seem
to touch the lefties.
Stanford's pitching, which has
been the team's main strength up
till now, gave way in critical mo
ments yesterday. Nine Broncos pa- i
raded to first base via the base-on
balls route, and two of these walks, j
coupled with three singles to center
field, proved to be starter Jack j
Heinen's undoing in the fatal fifth 1
frame.
Heinen, who gave up all of the i
Broncos' four runs, was replaced j
by Jim Claypoo] in the sixth. Clay
pool wasn't much more effective,
nor was Ed Shive who finished up
in the ninth after Claypool had been
lifted for a pinch hitter.
Behind 4 to 1, the Cards had a
chance to even it up in the eighth
when they loaded the bases on two
walks and an infield error. But J
with the count three and two and j
the runners on the move, Charlie !
Cole grounded to second and the
inning ended before anyone could
score.
