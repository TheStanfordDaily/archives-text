Coach Jack Weiershauser gave
his varsity cindermen a day's rest
yesterday afternoon. The halt in
practice schedules was ordered to
the boys a chance to catch up
on the books alter the extra long
stay in the stormy Southland.
With all efforts straining toward
the coming triangular meet with
San Jose State and the Olympic
Club, this weeks plans will concen
trate on getting a fresh approach.
The Spartans, who scored over 30
points against the powerful Trojans
in a three-way affair two weeks
ago. appear stronger now than pre
season dope had figured. The Cards
have already deefated the Clubmen
this season.
Several best times were made by
Indian cindermen in Monday's loss
to USC. Woody Bray, coming from
tar back in the half - ini'.e, was
caught in 1:56.7 tor his second
place. This mark is Bray's best ef
fort ever.
In the Card sweep in the shot,
soph Charlie Hokanson earned third
with his top performance of 50 ft.
â€¢i in. Hurdler Darrel Kreitz, after
being away trorh oval duties for
over a. year, equaled his best time
ol : 14. in the/high sticks. Versatile
Wilbur Taylor toured the furlong
sprint in a creditable :21.2.
More will be known about the
condition of both Bryans when
practice resumes today. Bob's knee
appears completely okay from his
motorcycle spill, and brother Gay
will probably remain out of this
coming Saturday's meet to assure
proper recovery. Gay will be ex
amined by the doctor on Thursday.
On the dark side of the ledger, A 1
Lyons is still battling his sinus ail
ment. Also. Bud Held snapped both
ol his Finnish javelins in half try
ing to whip over the terrific winds
in the Coliseum. Those two were
Bud's only ones left from his Euro
pean tour last summer. The Ath
letic Department is now trying to
scare up some more for the defend
ing national champ.
