# Silence, Underacting Make 'Third Man'
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
A man dies in a street accident
and is buried. Then a frightening j
chase begins—a search through Vi
enna for "The Third Man" who
witnessed the "accident" and dis
appeared.
To Director Carol Reed goes most
of the credit for making "The Third i

Man" a tangled >
web of suspense, j
As in "The Fal
len Idol," he!
holds his actors j
in check, fore-j
ing them to un
deract, and their
restraint is a |
current below,
the surface of j
the film. This

underacting intensifies the impact
of the few emotional scenes in
which Reed loosens his hold on the
reins. 112
Every performance is excellent —
from the close-to-superb work of
an unidentified porter who had the
misfortune to see the third man, to
the convincing job of Joseph Cot
ton as the blundering pulp writer
who was the dead man's friend, j
Valli does a sensitive job as the
mistress of the dead man; Trevor j
Howard hardly seems to be acting j
as the professonal military police
man; and Orson Welles is an apt ;
choicc for his extroverted role.

Not only docs Reed let his cam- l
era build up a terrifying tenseness !
j (as in the scene in the street with j
| the cat), he also creates mood with I
a daring use of silence. In the cli- j
mactic scene in the sewers of Vicn- i
na between Cotton and his foe only !
j the camera moves, from one to the
; other; the only sound is the rush of
| water carrying the sewage to the
i Danube.
Reed's craftsmanship also shows j
: in the fact that though the film is |
; "talky" the audience is not usually j
; conscious of it..
Minor characters sometimes speak j
in German whqpi they talk to each I
other; Reed docs not allow them to j
j address the audience in English !
; when it is unnecessary and unbe- {
lievablc. Even important lines arc j
, "thrown away" in German, and this I
heightens the film's realism.
Graham Greene has written a j
[ suspenscful—and at the same time j
I adult — screen play from his own |
short novel. His characters are more |
gray than black and white, even the j
Russians.
As Valli remarks, "A person j
doesn't change for you because you I
; find out more about him," a wcl- I
come change from the heroine who |
j buries her dead lover and is ready j
to marry the hero the next day.

Graham Greene has written a j
[ suspenscful—and at the same time j

short novel. His characters are more |

"The Third Man" is playing at |
I the St. Francis Theater in San j
Francisco. j

A man dies in a street accident
and is buried. Then a frightening j
chase begins—a search through Vi
enna for "The Third Man" who
witnessed the "accident" and dis
appeared.
To Director Carol Reed goes most
of the credit for making "The Third i

Man" a tangled >
web of suspense, j
As in "The Fal
len Idol," he!
holds his actors j
in check, fore-j
ing them to un
deract, and their
restraint is a |
current below,
the surface of j
the film. This

underacting intensifies the impact
of the few emotional scenes in
which Reed loosens his hold on the
reins. 112
Every performance is excellent —
from the close-to-superb work of
an unidentified porter who had the
misfortune to see the third man, to
the convincing job of Joseph Cot
ton as the blundering pulp writer
who was the dead man's friend, j
Valli does a sensitive job as the
mistress of the dead man; Trevor j
Howard hardly seems to be acting j
as the professonal military police
man; and Orson Welles is an apt ;
choicc for his extroverted role.

Not only docs Reed let his cam- l
era build up a terrifying tenseness !
j (as in the scene in the street with j
| the cat), he also creates mood with I
a daring use of silence. In the cli- j
mactic scene in the sewers of Vicn- i
na between Cotton and his foe only !
j the camera moves, from one to the
; other; the only sound is the rush of
| water carrying the sewage to the
i Danube.
