LONDON, April 11 (/P) â€”Moscow ,
reported today a U.S. bomber dis- .
appeared over the Baltic Sea after j
entering Russian territory and ex
changing fire with a Soviet fighter !
last Saturday. That day an Ameri
can Navy patrol plane vanished
with 10 aboard.
High defense officials in Washing
ton indicated they believed the :
Navy plane, unarmed, is the aircraft j
to which the Russians referred. A
four-engined Privateer, it dropped
out of sight after leaving Wiesba
den, Germany, on a round - trip
flight to Denmark.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Y. Vishinsky protested that a U.S.
bomber of the Super-Fortress type
flew over Latvia that day and
opened fire on a group of Soviet
fighters that went up and ordered it
to land. Vishinsky said one fighter j
returned the fire, "after which the i
American plane turned toward the
sea and disappeared."
The Defense Department in j
Washington issued statements by
Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Air Force j
chief of staff, denying any Air Force
plane was involved, and by Adm. :
Forrest P. Sherman, chief of naval
operations, stating the missing Navy |
plane carried no guns and was un- j
der standing orders to stay well
clear of Russian territory.
Sherman said the patrol plane,
therefore, "could not have fired on \
any other aircraft or returned the
fire of any aircraft."
