# Tobacco Tax Bill
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO â€” Proponents of
a tobacco tax to help finance public
education advanced their bill an
other step today in the California
Legislature against increasing op
position.
The Assembly-passed bill moved
through a second Senate committc,
but. as in its hearing last night
before the Education Committee,
failed to win a "do pass" recom
mendation.
The Revenue and Tax Committee
by a (i to 4 vote sent the huge mon
ey bill on to the Finance Committee,
which, if it moves it alone, can send
it to Ihe Senate floor for a roll call
vote.
