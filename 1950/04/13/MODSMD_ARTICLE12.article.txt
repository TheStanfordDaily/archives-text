# 'Cherry Orchard' Wins Approval
## Cast Attains Warm Humor 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
We were part, of an appreciative
audience last night in the Little Thea
ter. We saw the Stanford Players
succeed, as they usually do, in pre
senting a delightful drama.
As we watched, Chekov's realistic
and thoroughly human characters,
were brought to life by a well chosen
cast.
Beatrice Mauley Blau was out
standing as the charming, extrava
gant Madame Ranevsky, owner of
the cherry orchard.
Frank Wolff was excellent, as Lo
pahin, Ihe wealthy peasant, whose
scheme to save the cherry orchard is
"too vulgar" for Madame Ranvensky.
Anne Lawdcr was another bright
spot in an all-around good cast.
The piny concerns an aristocratic
family in Russia in the early years
of the 20th century. The human and
understanding of the members of the
Ranevsky family and their friends
was even more effective in the per
sonal atmosphere of the Little Thea
ter.
Russian styles, which imitated Eu
rope at the time the play was written,
were carefully represented by the
costumes and settings.
Although "The Cherry Orchard'' is
a comedy, it docs not draw the hearty
guffaws of many contemporary plays.
Instead it brings forth deep chuckles,
as the audience sees act ions and char
acteristics familiar in their own lives.

sha (Ann Guilbert) and Yasha (William Kenney) with the story of his life. The scene is from"The
Cherry Orchard" which opened last night for a run of 18 performances in the Little Theater.
