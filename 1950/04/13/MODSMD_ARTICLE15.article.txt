# Excom Vetoes NSA Affiliation
## Favors Independent Local Group To Continue Similar Activities Here 
### 
Excom voted last night to withdraw Stanford from the National
Students Association and decided informally to carry out the ac
tivities of the present NSA committee through an unaffiliated or
ganization.
The withdrawal from the national association became a fact

when the student body representa-"]
tives defeated, 8 to 6, a motion to
accept NSA as a campus organization j
with national affiliation.
The action was the result of an
hour and a half of discussion and fol
lowed the defeat of a motion to accept
NSA as an active organization on a
full budget next year. The first mo
tion was killed, 13 to 1, with Kay
Wold, Women's Halls, casting the
lone vote of approval.
In other major action last night,
Excom adopted the by-law estab
lishing an ASSU Athletic Board.
Excom's refusal to accept NSA
next year was based on objection to
the high cost of operating the com
mittee, which spent $1,294 this year.
Instead, the representatives hoped
to include in the budget, under gen
eral expenditures, an allowance to
finance the operations of an ASSU
committee which would assume the
local activities of NSA.
The budget meeting will be held
in the committee room of the Old
Union tonight at 7.
This decision came after Student
Body President Hank Rosin pointed
out. that NSA could not operate ef
fectively if convention travel ex
penses, the main point of dispute,
were cut from the budget. Stanford
participation in the NSA national
congress and the benefits derived
from the annual convention were
the main subject of arguments sup
porting the continuation of NSA.
Rosin spoke out against future af
filiation, saying that there was no
doubt that NSA did a great job in
helping build student organization
in the smaller colleges, but that
well - established student bodies,
such as at Stanford, did not get as
much benefit.
Rosin said that he did not have
faith in the arguments presented
that NSA was a powerful force rep
resenting one million students na
tionally. He said that lie believed
NSA support of national and inter
national issues was stimulated by a
few persons who were doing what
they felt was correct, and not from
the pressure of a concerned student
world.
The question of local student
benefit from national NSA affilia
tion was brought up by Daily Busi
ness Manager Marv Tincher, who
said he wanted to know just what
"Joe Stanford gets from NSA."
Derek Bok, junior class, summa
rized the issue by declaring that the
proponents of NSA must prove that
NSA is an indispensable organiza
tion for obtaining benefits for Stan
ford which could not be gained oth
erwise. Graduate Representative
Rex Johnson said that it appeared
thai NSA duplicated much of the
work that could be accomplished by
established groups on campus.
Many of those favoring severance
of national ties said they felt that
an independent local organization
could carry out the work just as
we 11.
Chief voices speaking for NSA
were Jan Robertson, Stanford NSA
co-ordinator Dick Kelton, regional
NSA president; and Timmie Lcvi
son, one of the NSA delegates to
this year's convention.
The arguments of these three
centered around the benefits of
pooled information and action Stan
lord would obtain by keeping its af
filiation. They argued that it would
be impossible to get by so effective
a means ideas which would aid in
developing many student activities.
