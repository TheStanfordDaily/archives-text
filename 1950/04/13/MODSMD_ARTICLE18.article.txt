## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Excom's special committee on
athletic aw<J"rd policy revision fin
ished its work last night by recom
mending certain athletic by-law
changes.
The proposed new by-law, prod
uct of three months of exhaustive
research by the 13-man award re
vision committee, embodies two sig
nificant changes in Stanford athletic
award policy:
I. A definite criterion for major
sport status at Stanford was estab

'4- A permanent six - man ASSU
Athletic Board wdl be organized to
consider further changes in the atli
letic by-laws, to review individual
letter awards as recommended by
the coaches, to assist the Block "S"
and Circle "S" Societies in their ac

of athletics at Stanford University
wherever possible.
New Board
The new Athletic Board will con

Department.
1. Have its coach or coaches rec

If a minor sport qualifies in all
four rcspects, it. may present its pe

which will judge it according to thr
"general" criterion. This consists
of:
1. The apparent degree of student
interest in it at Sanford.
2. Thr national and local prestige
which the sport has attained.
3. The emphasis placed on the
sport by and at Stanford University.
Petitions Forwarded
Petitions of sports which this

and general criteria are then for

If the minor sport is chosen for
major status, the change will be
