# Athletic Award Policy Change Recommended
## 
### BILL SWIGART 
Excom's special committee on
athletic aw<J"rd policy revision fin
ished its work last night by recom
mending certain athletic by-law
changes.
The proposed new by-law, prod
uct of three months of exhaustive
research by the 13-man award re
vision committee, embodies two sig
nificant changes in Stanford athletic
award policy:
I. A definite criterion for major
sport status at Stanford was estab
lished.
'4- A permanent six - man ASSU
Athletic Board wdl be organized to
consider further changes in the atli
letic by-laws, to review individual
letter awards as recommended by
the coaches, to assist the Block "S"
and Circle "S" Societies in their ac
tivities, and to further the interests
of athletics at Stanford University
wherever possible.
New Board
The new Athletic Board will con
sist of six members, including thr
ASSU president, the two student
members of the Board of Athletic
Control, the presidents of the Block
"S" and Circle "S" Societies, and
one member of Excom. Major sport
captains will be on the board with
out a vote.
The major sport criterion was
worked out and adopted in ordei
that Excom might be better quali
fied to consider the petitions of mi -
nor sports to have their statu:
raised than it receives from time
to time. The criterion is divided
into two parts, called "specific" and
"general." To meet the specific cri -
terion, a sport must:
Criterion for Recognition
1. Have official recognition from
the Athletic Department as a spoi l
representing Stanford University in
competition.
2. Be financed and scheduled by
the Athletic Department.
15. Compete in an organized con
ference approved by the Athletic
Department.
1. Have its coach or coaches rec
ognized and approved by the Ath
letic Department.
If a minor sport qualifies in all
four rcspects, it. may present its pe
tit ion to the ASSU Athletic Board
which will judge it according to thr
"general" criterion. This consists
of:
1. The apparent degree of student
interest in it at Sanford.
2. Thr national and local prestige
which the sport has attained.
3. The emphasis placed on the
sport by and at Stanford University.
Petitions Forwarded
Petitions of sports which this
board rules meet both the specific
and general criteria are then for
warded to Excom for final action.
If the minor sport is chosen for
major status, the change will be
made two years after the quarter
during which it was passed.
It is hoped that the adoption of
such a criterion and plan of action,
will save future Excoms much of
the time and effort that has for
merly been spent in debating re
quests for major sport status.
Since 194(1 the Executive Commit
tee has received three formal re
quests lor major sport status.
Swimming and golf have been
raised to major sport status since
the was, while a bid from the Stan
ford Crew Association was turned
clown last spring.
Board of Athletic Control mem
ber Noel Behn advises that this is
merely the half - way point in a
year-long program of correspond
ence interviews, and meetings 011
the athletic award situation. Si ill to
be considered are the proposal that
letter awards be given junior var
sity athletes, a possible renewal of
the victory award, and proposed
changes in the playing - time re
quirements for individual sport
awards.
■ This will be done by the new
ASSU Athletic Board which will
appoint its chairman and begin
work immediately.
Members of the Committee on
Letter Award Revision that con
cluded its work last night are Noel
Behn, chairman. Ralph Sala, Ralph
Davidson, Jack Wecden, Gene Mar
tin, Pitch Johnson, Fred Ten Eyck,
Jess Cone, Downing MeKce, Erie

Excom's special committee on
athletic aw<J"rd policy revision fin
ished its work last night by recom
mending certain athletic by-law
changes.
The proposed new by-law, prod
uct of three months of exhaustive
research by the 13-man award re
vision committee, embodies two sig
nificant changes in Stanford athletic
award policy:
I. A definite criterion for major
sport status at Stanford was estab
lished.
'4- A permanent six - man ASSU
Athletic Board wdl be organized to
consider further changes in the atli
letic by-laws, to review individual
letter awards as recommended by
the coaches, to assist the Block "S"
and Circle "S" Societies in their ac
tivities, and to further the interests
of athletics at Stanford University
wherever possible.
New Board
The new Athletic Board will con
sist of six members, including thr
ASSU president, the two student
members of the Board of Athletic
Control, the presidents of the Block
"S" and Circle "S" Societies, and
one member of Excom. Major sport
captains will be on the board with
out a vote.
The major sport criterion was
worked out and adopted in ordei
that Excom might be better quali
fied to consider the petitions of mi -
nor sports to have their statu:
raised than it receives from time
to time. The criterion is divided
into two parts, called "specific" and
"general." To meet the specific cri -
terion, a sport must:
Criterion for Recognition
1. Have official recognition from
the Athletic Department as a spoi l
representing Stanford University in
competition.
2. Be financed and scheduled by
the Athletic Department.
15. Compete in an organized con
ference approved by the Athletic
Department.
1. Have its coach or coaches rec
ognized and approved by the Ath
letic Department.
If a minor sport qualifies in all
four rcspects, it. may present its pe
tit ion to the ASSU Athletic Board
which will judge it according to thr
"general" criterion. This consists
of:
1. The apparent degree of student
interest in it at Sanford.
2. Thr national and local prestige
which the sport has attained.
3. The emphasis placed on the
sport by and at Stanford University.
Petitions Forwarded
Petitions of sports which this
board rules meet both the specific
and general criteria are then for
warded to Excom for final action.
If the minor sport is chosen for
major status, the change will be
made two years after the quarter
during which it was passed.
It is hoped that the adoption of
such a criterion and plan of action,
will save future Excoms much of
the time and effort that has for
merly been spent in debating re
quests for major sport status.
Since 194(1 the Executive Commit
tee has received three formal re
quests lor major sport status.
Swimming and golf have been
raised to major sport status since
the was, while a bid from the Stan
ford Crew Association was turned
clown last spring.
Board of Athletic Control mem
ber Noel Behn advises that this is
merely the half - way point in a
year-long program of correspond
ence interviews, and meetings 011
the athletic award situation. Si ill to
be considered are the proposal that
letter awards be given junior var
sity athletes, a possible renewal of
the victory award, and proposed
changes in the playing - time re
quirements for individual sport
awards.
■ This will be done by the new
ASSU Athletic Board which will
appoint its chairman and begin
work immediately.
Members of the Committee on
Letter Award Revision that con
cluded its work last night are Noel
Behn, chairman. Ralph Sala, Ralph
Davidson, Jack Wecden, Gene Mar
