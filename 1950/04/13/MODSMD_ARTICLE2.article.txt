SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 (A 3 )—
Concern lest Dr. Gordon Sproul
may have to quit as president of
the University of California unless
the fuss over a non - Communist
oath is settled was expressed to
night by James K. Moffitt.
For 36 years MofTitt, president of
Blake, MofTitt & Townc. was a
member of the Board of Regents
which has ordered all university
employees to sign a special oath
by April 30 or resign.
Dr. Sproul opposes the oath, sid
ing with those who contend it is
discriminating and that the custom
ary loyalty oath suffices.
"It is undoubted that if the
deadlock continues," said the 84-
year-old Moflitt in a statement, "it
may well be that President Sproul
will find it; impossible to continue
in his position as head of the great
university that he has done so much
to build up in the past 20 years."
