# Lower Division Evaluation
## 
### 
Approximately 350 juniors received invita
lations this week —invitations to take part in an
evaluation program which will help Stanford
make its lower division cuniculum one of the
best among the nation's universities.
The Lower Division Committee has asked
itself, "How good is our Lower Division in com
parison with that of other schools?"
The students chosen for the project will at
tempt to answer this during the next few
months as they take a series of examinations
.specially prepared by the Faculty Committee
on Lower Division Administration.
The results of these tests will be tossed in a
hopper with the still smouldering coals of the
Graduate Record Exams. It is hoped that the
administrators can fan the flames of the two
programs so the academic standards of lower
divison courses can reach an even higher
level.
The Graduate Record Exarns showed how
our juniors stood in relation to the national
norm of other institutions.
The local test will furnish:
1. A better judgment of courses in terms of
our own aims and intentions.
2. A more complete knowledge of the re
quirements of each lower division course.
To get the most accurate picture of the Stan
lord trend, the committee has asked repre
sentative students from each major or depart
ment and of every grade status. Only through
their help can the University make a true esti
mate of what we lack, what we hope to attain,
and what is the best way to attain better lower
d i vision ed ucation.
'This plan is not just a shot in the dark. It
also fits into the scheme of the recently
authorized Student-Faculty Commission.
The new commission can use the results of
tLower Division evaluation in co ordinating
the efforts of students and faculty toward im
proving courses.
Although the juniors who have been asked
to co-operate will not reap the benefits of the
Lower Division Evaluation, it is their chance to
improve the Western Civ and Biology courses
which future Stanford students sit through.
In fact, it is hoped that a new program—
based on the evaluations—will be initiated next

fall for incoming freshmen.-
It is important, we think, that all students
selected to assist in the evaluation take a con
scientous part. As in any carefully charted po
litical poll, the individual in the evaluation pro
gram has an important role. He represents one
slice of enrollment in his major and at his level
of grade achievement.
The larger the percentage that co-operates
by attending the opening meeting today, the
less the amount of work that any one indi
vidual will have to do. The compensation
seems fair, and the tests will be taken at the
students' convenience.
This evaluation program, we think, repre
sents the ultimate in attaining the goal for aca
demic perfection wfyich every university
strives for. As a new chapter is added to last
week's presentation of the Student-Faculty
Commission Charter, the students can well be
pleased. G.A.

Graduate Record Exams. It is hoped that the
administrators can fan the flames of the two
programs so the academic standards of lower
divison courses can reach an even higher
level.
The Graduate Record Exarns showed how
our juniors stood in relation to the national
norm of other institutions.
The local test will furnish:
1. A better judgment of courses in terms of
our own aims and intentions.
2. A more complete knowledge of the re
quirements of each lower division course.
To get the most accurate picture of the Stan
lord trend, the committee has asked repre
sentative students from each major or depart
ment and of every grade status. Only through
their help can the University make a true esti
mate of what we lack, what we hope to attain,
and what is the best way to attain better lower
d i vision ed ucation.
'This plan is not just a shot in the dark. It
also fits into the scheme of the recently
authorized Student-Faculty Commission.
The new commission can use the results of
tLower Division evaluation in co ordinating
the efforts of students and faculty toward im
proving courses.
Although the juniors who have been asked
to co-operate will not reap the benefits of the
Lower Division Evaluation, it is their chance to
improve the Western Civ and Biology courses
which future Stanford students sit through.
In fact, it is hoped that a new program—
based on the evaluations—will be initiated next

fall for incoming freshmen.-
It is important, we think, that all students
selected to assist in the evaluation take a con
scientous part. As in any carefully charted po
litical poll, the individual in the evaluation pro
gram has an important role. He represents one
slice of enrollment in his major and at his level
of grade achievement.
The larger the percentage that co-operates
by attending the opening meeting today, the
less the amount of work that any one indi
vidual will have to do. The compensation
seems fair, and the tests will be taken at the
students' convenience.
This evaluation program, we think, repre
sents the ultimate in attaining the goal for aca
demic perfection wfyich every university
strives for. As a new chapter is added to last
week's presentation of the Student-Faculty
Commission Charter, the students can well be
pleased. G.A.
Approximately 350 juniors received invita
lations this week —invitations to take part in an
evaluation program which will help Stanford
make its lower division cuniculum one of the
best among the nation's universities.
The Lower Division Committee has asked
itself, "How good is our Lower Division in com
parison with that of other schools?"
The students chosen for the project will at
tempt to answer this during the next few
months as they take a series of examinations
.specially prepared by the Faculty Committee
on Lower Division Administration.
The results of these tests will be tossed in a
hopper with the still smouldering coals of the
Graduate Record Exams. It is hoped that the
administrators can fan the flames of the two
programs so the academic standards of lower
divison courses can reach an even higher
level.
