# Policy on Letters
## 
### 
It may be the undependability of the weather
or the coming of the spring elections that is to
blame for the harsh words that have been
passed through The Daily Campus Opinion
column during the past week. Possibly it is a
reflection of the current doings in Washington
or the precedent set by Mr. Truman in answer
to a columnist. Whatever the cause, it is hard
to find any true value in this name-calling.
Twice this week we have found that our
correspondents have buried their subject mat
ter between crusty lines of sharp epithets,
leaving the reader at a loss to find the basic
points of the letters, which, in this case, was
world federalism.
Lest the current trend of colorful adjectives
and lengthy wordings get out of hand, The
Daily feels that it should restate its policy on
letters.
Letters to the editor should be confined to
200 words. The editors reserve the right to
cut stories that are too long, or delete sections
that are not in good taste. All letters must be
signed with the written signature of the corre
spondent. The editor also reserves the right to
refuse to publish any letter.—A.M.
