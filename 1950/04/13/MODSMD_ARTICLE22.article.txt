It should bf hard to imagine anything more heartless
than the recent action of the Inter-Fraternity Council
at the University of Kansas.
They stopped serenades.
The women are, of course, broken-hearted. They
are being robbed, they say, of "the most romantic ex
perience of our lives.''

An unexpected and unprecedented invocation of an
old ruling recently lost Columbia University the serv
ices of one track star and three other seniors who hold
key positions on the college newspaper and radio .sta
tion.
All four of these men were declared ineligible to
participate in extra-curricular activities because they
were honor students. They were ruled to have com
pleted all requirements for the degree liter three and
a half years, and while they were allowed to attend
the university, they have been removed from activities.
Three of the seniors had received extra grade points
because they had made six or more points of "A" in one
remester; the track man had been awarded credits
which he had been told he would not receive.
The Daily Spectator's bitterness was understandable,
even aside from the fact that it has lost a news editor
and a sports editor. "Columbia sold itself down the
liver," it said.

"What is more natural than for a boy an#l girl to kiss
goodnight 7" is what a coed at the University of Con
necticut wants to know. In a letter to the editor of
the Connecticut Campus .she explains that the girls in
her hall have received an edict to bring their escorts
into the main lounge after their dates to say good
night. Says the order, "This is to be a brief farewell,"
Several other dorms, the Campus adds, have aroused
: mall furors by similar edicts. The writer oi the letter
claims that the dorms are trying to put "social Social
ism" into effect and "destroy free enterprise."
And, incidentally, the girl won a carton ol cigarettes

for writing the best letter of the week.
A reporter for the University of Georgia paper con
ducted an experiment in student honesty when he left
a handsome cigarette lighter on a table in the student
lunchroom. Then he watched eight people pass the
lighter up, and a lone ninth take it.
The first two groups that sat at the table noticed
the lighter but apparently expected the owner back
any minute. Another group of three coveted the ob
ject but one girl finally said, "No. 1 won't. I'd worry
about it all night." "Probably a trick by some amateur
psychologist," was her companion's acute comment.

Santa Barbara sat up and took notice last week when
fraternity men at Santa Barbara College, UC, showed
a surprising amount of civic spirit, plus sweat and
muscle. As a climax to Greek Week, 110 brothers
"took hoes and rakes in hand to give a much-needed
spring cleanup to the miles of Santa Barbara park
ways."
According to El Gaucho, the student paper there, the
Santa Barbara News-Press and the mayor of. the city
both congratulated the Greeks. The city also fed the
boys who spent the day weeding. The Clean-Up Day
may become an annual affair, said the chairman for
the program.

"There is a crying need for laughter in City College,"
a group of 25 City College of New York students was
informed recently. They were gathered to do some
thing about it; specifically, they are the nucleus of a
Laughter Society, "for the propagation and study of
laughter." Laughter will replace "hellos ' and will be
studied seriously as a psychological, physical, and
physiological phenomenon.

No campus queens, no Great Lovers for Santa Rosa
at that junior college, the contest of the year is to find
the ugliest man on campus. It's to raise money, of
course- for the World Student Service Fund.

Santa Barbara sat up and took notice last week when
fraternity men at Santa Barbara College, UC, showed
a surprising amount of civic spirit, plus sweat and
muscle. As a climax to Greek Week, 110 brothers
"took hoes and rakes in hand to give a much-needed
spring cleanup to the miles of Santa Barbara park
ways."
According to El Gaucho, the student paper there, the
Santa Barbara News-Press and the mayor of. the city
both congratulated the Greeks. The city also fed the
boys who spent the day weeding. The Clean-Up Day
may become an annual affair, said the chairman for
the program.

"There is a crying need for laughter in City College,"
a group of 25 City College of New York students was
informed recently. They were gathered to do some
thing about it; specifically, they are the nucleus of a
Laughter Society, "for the propagation and study of
laughter." Laughter will replace "hellos ' and will be
studied seriously as a psychological, physical, and
physiological phenomenon.

No campus queens, no Great Lovers for Santa Rosa
at that junior college, the contest of the year is to find
the ugliest man on campus. It's to raise money, of
course- for the World Student Service Fund.
It should bf hard to imagine anything more heartless
than the recent action of the Inter-Fraternity Council
at the University of Kansas.
They stopped serenades.
The women are, of course, broken-hearted. They
are being robbed, they say, of "the most romantic ex
perience of our lives.''

An unexpected and unprecedented invocation of an
old ruling recently lost Columbia University the serv
ices of one track star and three other seniors who hold
key positions on the college newspaper and radio .sta
tion.
All four of these men were declared ineligible to
participate in extra-curricular activities because they
were honor students. They were ruled to have com
pleted all requirements for the degree liter three and
a half years, and while they were allowed to attend
the university, they have been removed from activities.
Three of the seniors had received extra grade points
because they had made six or more points of "A" in one
remester; the track man had been awarded credits
which he had been told he would not receive.
The Daily Spectator's bitterness was understandable,
even aside from the fact that it has lost a news editor
and a sports editor. "Columbia sold itself down the
liver," it said.

"What is more natural than for a boy an#l girl to kiss
goodnight 7" is what a coed at the University of Con
necticut wants to know. In a letter to the editor of
the Connecticut Campus .she explains that the girls in
her hall have received an edict to bring their escorts
into the main lounge after their dates to say good
night. Says the order, "This is to be a brief farewell,"
Several other dorms, the Campus adds, have aroused
: mall furors by similar edicts. The writer oi the letter
claims that the dorms are trying to put "social Social
ism" into effect and "destroy free enterprise."
And, incidentally, the girl won a carton ol cigarettes

for writing the best letter of the week.
A reporter for the University of Georgia paper con
ducted an experiment in student honesty when he left
a handsome cigarette lighter on a table in the student
lunchroom. Then he watched eight people pass the
lighter up, and a lone ninth take it.
The first two groups that sat at the table noticed
the lighter but apparently expected the owner back
any minute. Another group of three coveted the ob
ject but one girl finally said, "No. 1 won't. I'd worry
about it all night." "Probably a trick by some amateur
