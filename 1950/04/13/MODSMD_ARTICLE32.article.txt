Derrick, a CCSF star, Owen Moore,
and veteran Bob Nicolai.

lias a well - balanced sprint team.

1m Bud Held, but he should be good
for a second place Saturday.

won liis event at 13 ft. 6 in. in the
Stanford meet last season, will be a
tough man to beat. Mattos scored

one of the three Spartan first places
in the!) 0 1/3 to 40 2/3 Stanford
rout over San Jose last year.

dle and Bill Passey have recovered
