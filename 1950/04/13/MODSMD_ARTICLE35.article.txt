# Mathias Mark Not Accepted
## 
### 
Bob Mathias, of Olympic fame,
went on the books as breaking two
of Stanford's freshman track rec
ords last week when the yearlings
outpointed Mount San Antonio on
the local oval. But only one of them
has been declared official.
Mathias' shot heave of 49 feet 10' 2
inches bettered Otis Chandler's es
tablished mark by well over a foot,
but the record has not been allowed |
to stand after it was discovered that j
the shot used in the meet was not
of the official weight.
The other mark was set in the,
discus event where Pete Zagar's
old 151-foot 7%-inch standard was |
bested by Mathias. The freshman
sent the plate flying 152 feet 7.'/ a j
inches. As yet, no fault has been
found with the dimensions of the |
discus.
This Saturday at 10 a.m. the frosh
thinclads will hold their second
event of the season, a three-way j
meet with the San Jose State frosh j
and Hartnell JC. j
Next Tuesday the triangular meet j
with Modesto and Menlo Junior J
Colleges will begin at 3:45. This is
the affair that was postponed last
Saturday because of the wet track.
Coach F!ay Dean has lost four of
his men from practice this week i
when they signed into the spring j
football camp. Two 440 runners, i
Joe St. Genie and Billy Heilbron, j
and a pair of shot putters, Allen '
Hanner and Jim Vick. will not be 1
out for practice, but they will prob- '
ably be used in the track meets for 1
the rest of the season.
