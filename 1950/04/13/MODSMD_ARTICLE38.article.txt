# Putnam Ruled Eligible Will Swim in Col Meet
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
Bruce Putnam, ace sophomore
swimmer, cleared himself yesterday
with the higher-ups, a'id will be
eligible to swim in the Big Meet.
Cal vs. Stanford, Saturday morning
in the Indians' home poo!.
Putnam, who has done 52.4 for 100
yards freestyle and 1:04 for the 100
backstroke, will probably swim
backstroke in the medley relay, an
chor the freestyle relay, and swim
one other event, perhaps the 100
freestyle or the 150 backstroke.
Tom Haynie, coach of the Card
team, expressed confidence that, ei
ther Jack Weeden or Ernie Polte or
both would also clear themselves by
Saturday.
The six best Stanford swimmers,
who took sixth in the NCAA meet
three weeks ago, were unable to
take some of their finals and nil but
Bob Frojen were declared ineli
gible. The other two bfcy were
Ralph Sala, NCAA 440 freestyle
champ, and Pete Cole, soph distance
man. These last two have several
finals to do. and Sala has been
troubled with a congested lung
anyway.
With Putnam swimming, the en
tire dope sheet for the meet must be
thrown out. His presence in the

two relays will mean first places in
both events, and in the backstroke
he could give Cal's best swimmer,
Bill Phillips, a tough race with a
good chance of a win.
With several come-through per- 1
formances, like Bob Wycoff and
Phil Chapman shutting veteran
-printer Don Fisher out in the 50
and LOO freestyle, and Frojen's win
ning the breaststroke, Stanford can
be expected to win the meet by a
I fairly wide margin.
Cal's only chances for firsts are I
in the 220 freestyle and in the div- i
ing. Phillips could conceivably beat'
Hub Stokely and John Mowat in I
the furlong, and Coach George
Schroth's excellent sophomore div- !
er Dave Wood has a little too much
■ class for Indian Karl Herrmann.
All this figures out to a 54 to 21
i victory for Stanford, and with Polte
and Weeden the Cardinals could
score five more points.
The freshman meet between the ;
I two schools will be run off at the
same time, 10 o'clock in the morn- !
ing, so the fans will be able to ob- j
I serve the antics of Bert Holiday and
; Mel Smith, top frosh swimmers. An ,
, admission charge of 50 cents will be I
I imposed on Stanford studerlts.

who took sixth in the NCAA meet
three weeks ago, were unable to
take some of their finals and nil but
Bob Frojen were declared ineli
gible. The other two bfcy were
Ralph Sala, NCAA 440 freestyle
champ, and Pete Cole, soph distance
man. These last two have several
finals to do. and Sala has been
troubled with a congested lung
anyway.
With Putnam swimming, the en
tire dope sheet for the meet must be
thrown out. His presence in the

two relays will mean first places in
both events, and in the backstroke
he could give Cal's best swimmer,
Bill Phillips, a tough race with a
good chance of a win.
With several come-through per- 1
formances, like Bob Wycoff and
Phil Chapman shutting veteran
-printer Don Fisher out in the 50
and LOO freestyle, and Frojen's win
ning the breaststroke, Stanford can
be expected to win the meet by a
I fairly wide margin.
Cal's only chances for firsts are I
in the 220 freestyle and in the div- i
ing. Phillips could conceivably beat'
Hub Stokely and John Mowat in I
the furlong, and Coach George
Schroth's excellent sophomore div- !
er Dave Wood has a little too much
■ class for Indian Karl Herrmann.
All this figures out to a 54 to 21
i victory for Stanford, and with Polte
and Weeden the Cardinals could
score five more points.
The freshman meet between the ;
I two schools will be run off at the
same time, 10 o'clock in the morn- !
ing, so the fans will be able to ob- j
I serve the antics of Bert Holiday and
; Mel Smith, top frosh swimmers. An ,
, admission charge of 50 cents will be I
I imposed on Stanford studerlts.
Bruce Putnam, ace sophomore
swimmer, cleared himself yesterday
with the higher-ups, a'id will be
eligible to swim in the Big Meet.
Cal vs. Stanford, Saturday morning
in the Indians' home poo!.
Putnam, who has done 52.4 for 100
yards freestyle and 1:04 for the 100
backstroke, will probably swim
backstroke in the medley relay, an
chor the freestyle relay, and swim
one other event, perhaps the 100
freestyle or the 150 backstroke.
Tom Haynie, coach of the Card
team, expressed confidence that, ei
ther Jack Weeden or Ernie Polte or
both would also clear themselves by
Saturday.
