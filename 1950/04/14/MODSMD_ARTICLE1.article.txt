MOSCOW, April 13 (/P)â€”Pravtlu
left no doubt today that Russians
regard tlic U.S. Navy patrol plane
hunted in the Baltic areas as the
same aircraft the Soviet govern
ment said exchanged shots with a
Soviet fighter over Latvia Saturday
and then disappeared toward the
sea.
A few hours later the government
announced the award of the Red
Banner to four Soviet Air Force
lieutenants "for excellent fulfill
ment of their duty." The decree, is
sued here and broadcast by the
Moscow radio, did not go into de
tail about what they did to win
the citations.
Meanwhile, search crews ran
down in vain a new tip on the pos
sible fate of the vanished plane
near the Danish island of Norholm.
They will resume the quest at dawn
tomorrow.
