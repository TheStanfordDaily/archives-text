## 
### DICK KLEIN 
In their first home appearance
before the student body, Coach Jack
Wciershausex , 's hard-luck trackmen
will try to make a fresh start on
the long, tough victory path. The
Indians match strides and jumps
with San Jose State and the Olym
pic Club tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the
Stadium.
The triangular affair should be a
good indicator of how far back the
Card cinder aces have slipped after
the long weekend in the Southland,
the loss to USC, and an irregular
practice schedule this week.
Not too much can be shown, how
ever, as the Cards have already
dropped the "Winged-O" athletes
two weeks ago in a dual meet. The
spartans could come close, but ap
pear not to have enough talent to
win.
San Jose has had a long lay-off
too, and Coach Bud Winter's squad
supposedly will not be at peak form.
The only appearance for the Spar
tans this season was a triple inert
with USC and Fresno State in I-os
Angeles. But since then, several top
performers have rounded into
shape.
Bob Crowe, crack sprinter, can he
expected to give the unpredictable
Tribe of Ronnie Buck, Bob Bryan,
and Wilbur Taylor a rough go. Un
less the Card trio performs at top
level, it won't even he close. Crowe
was fast enough last year to place
in the Nationals.
With (Jay Bryan tabbed to sit on
the sidelines for the third weekend
in x row, the Cards must concede
the high jump to Mel Martin, H-ft.

the broad jump pit for a wide open
scramble. Merritt. Van Sant, next
best long jump specialist, is also
out,

Be:,t races of the day will be the
440 and the mile relay. The Spar
tans have a strong foursome in Bill
Davis, former Compton ace; Owen
Moore, ex-San Francisco CC .star;
Bob Nicolai, and Reuben Derrick,
also from Compton. That quartet
set a new San Jose State record
when they defeated USC with a

lost to a Trojan relay. Time was
it: 18 flat.
Weicrshauscr will probably send
Pitch Johnson, Cass Bly, the ailing
Larry Hoff, and Taylor out to nip
the Spartans.
Trouble at the Distances
In the distance events the In
dians run into Dore Purely, Frank
Johnson, and Bob Weber of San
Jose and Kaarc Vcfling of the
Olympic Club. Of the lot, Vcfling,
former Bear runner, and durable
Purdy arc the best. Veiling is ca
pable of under 4:20 in the mile and
Purdy docs 9:40 in the two-mile.
