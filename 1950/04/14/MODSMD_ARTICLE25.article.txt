# Palo Alto Police Tactics

Stanford student, we would venture lo say,
are citizens. They should be treated accord
ingly.
They shouldn't be put in jail without know
ing why, or without a chance to explain the
situation which results in their being arrested.
And we think they should be entitled to po
lite treatment by police, not as if they were
haidened criminals.
The Palo Alto Police Department seems to
have some different ideas.
Last Friday night a Stanford student, Niles
Severin, was held overnight in the Palo Alto
jail on a charge of disturbing the peace.
Severin was to have appeared before Police
judge Richard Doyle today, but Judge Doyle
phoned Stanfoid Chief Counselor for Men
Hichard Balch.on Wednesday afternoon and
informed him that the charges against Severin
had been dropped.
We have no quarrel with Judge Doyle.
We do have a quarrel with Palo Alto police,
who jailed Severin when the facts indicated
that he deserved credit for subduing a drunken
trouble-maker, a man with a police record, who
had attacked a Stanford student without provo
cation.
Severin tried to tell his story to apparently
(ieaf police ears. His story was backed up by
si* fellow students who witnessed the entire
afldir. Their protests to the desk sergeant
on duty over the jailing of Severin were un
heeded. Police refused to tell them, or Severin,

the charges. The witnesses say that the police
did not seem "interested" in the facts about the
affair.
Severin was fingerprinted and photo
graphed. And for all we know, unless Uni- j
versity protests were heeded, these records
were sent to Washington with the notation, j
"charge dismissed."
This mark on Niles Severin's record, even
with the notation of dismissal of charges, will
remain a question mark to any employer who 1
chances to learn it. And the incident would be
very likely to turn up in any civil service ap
plication.
This is bad police work. It does not build up ,
any respect for the police department of our :
ordinarily friendly neighbor, Palo Alto:
We note that Palo Alto's police force has
been having a bit of trouble with youngsters 1
in the community. This may, in part, account
for some of their methods. But it cannot justify
indiscriminate use of such methods.
If the Severin case is any example. Palo
Alto's trouble with teen-agers may in part re
sult from police methods.
From information released to The Daily by
the Palo Alto police, without any indication
that Severin was innocent of all blame in the
case. The Daily printed a story concerning
Severin's arrest. We owe him an apology for
this story.
The Palo Alto police, however, owe Niles
Severin far more than just an apology.

We note that Palo Alto's police force has
been having a bit of trouble with youngsters 1
in the community. This may, in part, account
for some of their methods. But it cannot justify
indiscriminate use of such methods.
If the Severin case is any example. Palo
Alto's trouble with teen-agers may in part re
sult from police methods.
From information released to The Daily by
the Palo Alto police, without any indication
that Severin was innocent of all blame in the
case. The Daily printed a story concerning
Severin's arrest. We owe him an apology for
this story.
The Palo Alto police, however, owe Niles
Severin far more than just an apology.
Stanford student, we would venture lo say,
are citizens. They should be treated accord
ingly.
They shouldn't be put in jail without know
ing why, or without a chance to explain the
situation which results in their being arrested.
And we think they should be entitled to po
lite treatment by police, not as if they were
haidened criminals.
The Palo Alto Police Department seems to
have some different ideas.
Last Friday night a Stanford student, Niles
Severin, was held overnight in the Palo Alto
jail on a charge of disturbing the peace.
Severin was to have appeared before Police
judge Richard Doyle today, but Judge Doyle
phoned Stanfoid Chief Counselor for Men
Hichard Balch.on Wednesday afternoon and
informed him that the charges against Severin
had been dropped.
We have no quarrel with Judge Doyle.
We do have a quarrel with Palo Alto police,
who jailed Severin when the facts indicated
that he deserved credit for subduing a drunken
trouble-maker, a man with a police record, who
had attacked a Stanford student without provo
cation.
Severin tried to tell his story to apparently
(ieaf police ears. His story was backed up by
si* fellow students who witnessed the entire
afldir. Their protests to the desk sergeant
on duty over the jailing of Severin were un
heeded. Police refused to tell them, or Severin,

the charges. The witnesses say that the police
did not seem "interested" in the facts about the
affair.
Severin was fingerprinted and photo
graphed. And for all we know, unless Uni- j
versity protests were heeded, these records
were sent to Washington with the notation, j
"charge dismissed."
This mark on Niles Severin's record, even
with the notation of dismissal of charges, will
remain a question mark to any employer who 1
chances to learn it. And the incident would be
very likely to turn up in any civil service ap
plication.
This is bad police work. It does not build up ,
any respect for the police department of our :
ordinarily friendly neighbor, Palo Alto:
