# Big Game Tickets
## 
### 
Last week the Stanford Athletic Council de
cided on. several revisions in the system of
distributing Big Game tickets. The revisions,
we believe, are extremely wise and practical.
Now that they have been given final approval
by the Administration, we can report them to
you.
1. This fall a limited number of Big Game
tickets will be set aside for the parents of regis
tered students. These tickets will be reserved
for non-alumni parents, who cannot apply for
tickets in any of the seven classifications set up
lor alloting priority on Big Game tickets.
ASSU Excom will set up a plan for distrib
uting these parent tickets, working with the
Dean's office.
It will probably be a case of "first come, first
served," but it will mean that a considerable
number of students will have two tickets for
their parent}].
Last fall, lo an unprecedented demand
fiom alumrn for Big Game ducats, students
were allowed only a rooter's ticket. There was
no way at that time to remedy the situation
without revising the entire system of ticket
distribution. This revision has now been en
acted.
2. Ticket seekers may now apply in only two
of the classifications. Previously, they could
upply wherever they could could qualify. The
clasifications, according to priority, are:
Class 1 - Student rooters
Class 2 - Stadium subscribers
Class 3 Staff members, faculty, working
press, and coinps for team members
Class 4— Buck of the Month Club
Class s—Block "S" award winners

Class 6A - Life members of the Alumni As
sociation
Class GB—Annual members of the Alumni
Association
Class 7 —Non-paid alumni
This ruling simply means that tickets will be
spread out among more people.
3. Only two tickets will be available to those
applying under Class GA or GB. Previously,
four tickets could be purchased under these
classifications.
4. No application blanks will be sent to Class
7, non-paid alumni. Instead, applications will
be sent to all who qualify under Class 6A or
68.
5. Spouses of students will be permitted to
buy one Big Game ticket at a 25 per cent dis
count if they buy a season ticket book.
6. Purchasers of season books will be per
mitted to buy one additional Big Game ticket,
not to exceed two. This is lo encourage the pur
chase of season books, in order to tap a great
potential source of income.
7. Faculty tickets will be alloted on the pre
war classification. In essence, this means that
all University employees listed in the Directory
will qualify, except for assistants in research
and instruction and assistants in administra
tion.
It seems to us that these revisions make our
system of Big Game ticket distribution far more
equitable. In essence, the result will be to give
more Stanford people a chance to attend the
Big Game, mainly by cutting down the excess
tickets formerly made available to alumni.
I he Slanford Athletic Council, working with
some good suggestions from the Alumni As
sociation, has done a line job.

Class GB—Annual members of the Alumni
Association
Class 7 —Non-paid alumni
This ruling simply means that tickets will be
spread out among more people.
3. Only two tickets will be available to those
applying under Class GA or GB. Previously,
four tickets could be purchased under these
classifications.
4. No application blanks will be sent to Class
7, non-paid alumni. Instead, applications will
be sent to all who qualify under Class 6A or
68.
5. Spouses of students will be permitted to
buy one Big Game ticket at a 25 per cent dis
count if they buy a season ticket book.
6. Purchasers of season books will be per
mitted to buy one additional Big Game ticket,
not to exceed two. This is lo encourage the pur
chase of season books, in order to tap a great
potential source of income.
7. Faculty tickets will be alloted on the pre
war classification. In essence, this means that
all University employees listed in the Directory
will qualify, except for assistants in research
and instruction and assistants in administra
tion.
It seems to us that these revisions make our
system of Big Game ticket distribution far more
equitable. In essence, the result will be to give
more Stanford people a chance to attend the
Big Game, mainly by cutting down the excess
tickets formerly made available to alumni.
I he Slanford Athletic Council, working with
some good suggestions from the Alumni As
sociation, has done a line job.
Last week the Stanford Athletic Council de
cided on. several revisions in the system of
distributing Big Game tickets. The revisions,
we believe, are extremely wise and practical.
Now that they have been given final approval
by the Administration, we can report them to
you.
1. This fall a limited number of Big Game
tickets will be set aside for the parents of regis
tered students. These tickets will be reserved
for non-alumni parents, who cannot apply for
tickets in any of the seven classifications set up
lor alloting priority on Big Game tickets.
ASSU Excom will set up a plan for distrib
uting these parent tickets, working with the
Dean's office.
It will probably be a case of "first come, first
served," but it will mean that a considerable
number of students will have two tickets for
their parent}].
Last fall, lo an unprecedented demand
fiom alumrn for Big Game ducats, students
were allowed only a rooter's ticket. There was
no way at that time to remedy the situation
without revising the entire system of ticket
distribution. This revision has now been en
acted.
2. Ticket seekers may now apply in only two
of the classifications. Previously, they could
upply wherever they could could qualify. The
clasifications, according to priority, are:
Class 1 - Student rooters
Class 2 - Stadium subscribers
Class 3 Staff members, faculty, working
press, and coinps for team members
Class 4— Buck of the Month Club
Class s—Block "S" award winners

Class 6A - Life members of the Alumni As
sociation
Class GB—Annual members of the Alumni
Association
Class 7 —Non-paid alumni

spread out among more people.
