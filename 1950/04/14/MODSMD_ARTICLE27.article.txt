# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
This run for Rossott's this after noon is really going
to be something, that is, it .you go for that sort of
thing. If yuu don't, you'll be glad to know that it's the
last day of Back-to-the-Farm Week, and starting
Monday you can walk through Quad safely and quietly

once again.
But personally, this Olympic
Relay to Rossott's appears to be
the greatest extravaganza to be
staged around these paits since
Hay Bryan first went out for
track.
Eighteen ready and willing if
not able—runners will juggle a
lighted toich and the Olympia
Package, and will struggle their
way from Hoover Tower to Ros
• otti's, in what they hope will add

up to about 45 minutes traveling time.
Downing M'cKee, fine of the top high hurdlers on
the Pacific Coast, will get things off to a legal start
at 2 p.m. when he'll snatch the torch from the steps
of Hoover Libe and head directly toward the next 17
men, who may have more trouble in staggering
through their turns. But they'll try, and somewhere
along the line, the following man will cot into the act.
f»us ( havalas, th< only legitimate entry (meaning
real Greek) ot the bunch, will be one of the first to
follow Mac. Old wheezing lung Rill Dailey will also
lake part, and that may end the race rij-ht there

However, Dai ley's plenty experienced at carrying a
torch, as he's been toting one ever since his girl left
him after seeing hiin in the light.
Another guy I just hafta see is Wall Varellas. recent
prexy of Inter-Fraternity Council. The smart money
is 5 to 1 that Varellas will need help before the next
eager face comes up to greet him and take over the
lord). After Wall, they gotta get past Dean Borha,
Jack Barnes. Ken Knse, Fred TenKyck, Donn Wells,!
Mori While, Finery Mitchell, Pat DeYoung, Itill
Young, and Ku|M' Andrews. Then, old Hank Kosin will
eoast into the finishing line, and the hot time will
commence.
But first, these 18 gu/s gotta run with that torch.
Actually, the runners fall into three classes. There
are those who can probably make it without too much
strain, such as the lucky conditioned athletes; then
there are those who might make it, such as cheer
leaders conditioned by practice with the axe-yell,
and Rally-Coin presidents kept in lop shape by round
ing up lost members; and then, there's the final class
of Hill Dailey and Wall Varellas.
The important thing will be to be on hand so that |
when one of the latter collapses, you can pick 'cm 1
up, and shove 'em on their way.
And if you happen to run into somebody with roller
skates along the route, don't get excited, it'll just I
be me.
See you down at f?ossotti's Milk Hardens.

Mori While, Finery Mitchell, Pat DeYoung, Itill
Young, and Ku|M' Andrews. Then, old Hank Kosin will
eoast into the finishing line, and the hot time will
commence.
But first, these 18 gu/s gotta run with that torch.
Actually, the runners fall into three classes. There
are those who can probably make it without too much
strain, such as the lucky conditioned athletes; then
there are those who might make it, such as cheer
leaders conditioned by practice with the axe-yell,
and Rally-Coin presidents kept in lop shape by round
ing up lost members; and then, there's the final class
of Hill Dailey and Wall Varellas.
The important thing will be to be on hand so that |
when one of the latter collapses, you can pick 'cm 1
up, and shove 'em on their way.
And if you happen to run into somebody with roller
skates along the route, don't get excited, it'll just I
be me.
See you down at f?ossotti's Milk Hardens.

This run for Rossott's this after noon is really going
to be something, that is, it .you go for that sort of
thing. If yuu don't, you'll be glad to know that it's the
last day of Back-to-the-Farm Week, and starting
Monday you can walk through Quad safely and quietly

once again.
But personally, this Olympic
Relay to Rossott's appears to be
the greatest extravaganza to be
staged around these paits since
Hay Bryan first went out for
track.
Eighteen ready and willing if
not able—runners will juggle a
lighted toich and the Olympia
Package, and will struggle their
way from Hoover Tower to Ros
• otti's, in what they hope will add

up to about 45 minutes traveling time.
Downing M'cKee, fine of the top high hurdlers on
the Pacific Coast, will get things off to a legal start
at 2 p.m. when he'll snatch the torch from the steps
of Hoover Libe and head directly toward the next 17
men, who may have more trouble in staggering
through their turns. But they'll try, and somewhere
along the line, the following man will cot into the act.
f»us ( havalas, th< only legitimate entry (meaning
real Greek) ot the bunch, will be one of the first to
follow Mac. Old wheezing lung Rill Dailey will also
lake part, and that may end the race rij-ht there

However, Dai ley's plenty experienced at carrying a
torch, as he's been toting one ever since his girl left
him after seeing hiin in the light.
Another guy I just hafta see is Wall Varellas. recent
prexy of Inter-Fraternity Council. The smart money
is 5 to 1 that Varellas will need help before the next
eager face comes up to greet him and take over the
lord). After Wall, they gotta get past Dean Borha,
Jack Barnes. Ken Knse, Fred TenKyck, Donn Wells,!
Mori While, Finery Mitchell, Pat DeYoung, Itill
Young, and Ku|M' Andrews. Then, old Hank Kosin will
