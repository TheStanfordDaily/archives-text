# Slate Tobacco Tax
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO—Opponents of a
tobacco tax blocked Senate passage
today of a package deal to increase
state aid to schools and counties.
Final decision on the whole pro
gram was put over until tomorrow
after the first of the five bills on an
all-or-nonc basis received a 26-8
vote —one short of the necessary
two-thirds of the Senate member
ship. J
Senate supporters of the plan de
clared that whatever else happens
the Legislature will have to do
something about support for the
schools before the present school
apportionment bill expires June 30.
Under the proposed tobacco tax,
schools would get $23,000,000 more
than they receive this year.
