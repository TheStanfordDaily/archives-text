# Charlie Chaplin Heads Sunday Eve Program
## 
### 
Due to the unprecedented audi- \
ence reaction of last week, there j
will be no serial shown at the Sun- j
day night movies this week. If
enough students display an appre
ciation for "King of the Jungleland"
by writing letters to the editor, the
serial will be continued. If there is
no response, then extra cartoons
will be added to fill in the pro
gram.
There will be a double feature 1
billing this week. The pictures are '
"A Burlesque on Carmen," a silent j
movie starring Charlie Chaplin, and
"A Chump at Oxford'' with Laurel
and Hardy.
