"best team in Cal history." The

starting at 1:30 p.m.
hi the smashing win over the Dons,
Coach Elwyn Bugge's forecast came
perfectly true, as 'he Cards cashed in
on the lower singles and went ahead
in the doubles.
Barbour Looks Good
Lucien Barbour, playing some of
his best-ever tennis in his newlv
vvon No. 1 spot, had highly-seeded
Conwaf Catten, 5 to 2, in the third
set. From there, Catten put on the
pressure and won the match. 6-3,
5-7, 7-5. It was a battle of control
throughout.
In the second singles, Harry Roche
easily downed Kirke Meehein. Me
chem was completely off his game,
and was no match for Roche.
The Indians made a clean sweep of
the remaining singles matches. Ernie
Dußray played methodically, as he
put away Bill Green, 0-2, 6-2. With
unbelievable placements and a whole
array ol shots, Tom Lawson took
Frank Sample, 6-3, 6-!).
Showing some of his old form,
George Gentry employed a powerful

overhead smash to humble Wally
Vickery, 0-2, 0-2. Don netter Stan
Smith managed to got one set from
Vinnie Schmeider, but lost to the
Card letterman, 6-3, 2-(>. 6-0.
Doubles Win
Mechem and Barbour pulled the
biggest surprise ol the day when they
came roaring back to defeat a dou
bles combo of Catten-Roehe. Score

some stole the volley away from the
USFers time and time again.
The Dons scored their third point
