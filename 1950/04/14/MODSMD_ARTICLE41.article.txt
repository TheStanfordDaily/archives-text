## 
### BILL SWIGART 
A seemingly endless stream of
Stanford and El Toro Marine base
runners literally beat the Sunken
Diamond bases to pieces yesterday
afternoon, as the Stanford varsity
and junior varsity outlasted the El l
Toro Marines, 20 to 16. in three I
hours and ten minutes ol agony ;
which might more properly be j
called a baseball game.
A fair midweek crowd was in the
stands as right - hander Ed Shive
opened on .the mound for the In
dians, but 36 runs and 37 hits later, i
there were only 11 spectators on
hand to see the final out.
The Card regulars coasted to a
quick 15 to 2 lead before the rooi
fell in on Shive in the fifth. Ed gave
up six runs in that frame, and
couldn't get anybody out in the
sixth. Jack Alexander replaced
Shive and he lasted one inning be
fore being replaced by Jim Clay pool
who finished up.
Tomorrow, the Indians return to
Berkeley for the second of their
three-game CIBA series with the
University of California Bears.
Coach Everett Dean is expected to
start Joe Chez, sophomore right
hander, who limited the Bears to
five safeties while setting them
down, 4 to 3. last Monday. Califor
nia Coach Clint Evans will counter
with Andy Stagnaro, Dave Ander
son, or Bill Gear, depending upon
who sees action in this afternoon's
CIBA tussle between the Bears and
the UCLA Bruins.
At stake is a higher spot in the
CIBA ladder. Starting time will be
!?:.';() p.m. at Edwards Field.

batting clothes against the Marines
yesterday. Ed Shive was the bat

ting leader with three singles and a
double in four trips. Not far behind
was Jungle Jim Trabucco with a
perfect triple and a double in two
trips, and Dave Melton with a triple
and a single in three trips.
I Pudgy Vince Adamczyk hit a
I homer inside the park and a single
j for the Marines.
j Dean cleared the Stanford bench
■ in the fifth inning, and the reserves
