# Today's Olympic Program Is Successor To Irish Marathon
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
Olympic Day is based on a long
tradition of interclass track rivalry.
The seeds of the present-day event
were laid 'way back in the tradition
of annual track competition between
classes, known as the Irish Marathon.
At first, this competition was held
in February and was composed of
the usual track and field events of
standard track meets. Special fea
ture was the marathon relay race
between classesâ€”24-man teams run
ning a total of six miles.
About 1933 the Irish Marathon was
taken over by the Stanford Quad
rangle Club, a men's honorary group,
which sponsored the event, charged
25 cents admission, and used the pro
ceeds to establish a scholarship for
entering freshmen.
At tbe same time, the date was
changed to April- and the emphasis
on standard races was enlarged to
include novelty races and stunts.
Such events featured a heel-and-toe

440-yard race, a bicycle race, and a
backwards 100-yard dash.
The Irish Marathon was dropped
about this time, and was not revived
until 1945 when Olympic Day was
conceived. This celebration was
sponsored by the four classes, WAA,
and Cardinals.
This 1945 Olympic Day was held in
conjunction with Sadie Hawkins
Day. Feature of the day was a Sa
die Hawkins' race, followed by a
dance that evening.
The afternoon of this event was

filled with novelty races, including
the old standbys, tug-o'-war, pie
eating contest, costume race, and
greased pig race. The old six-mile
marathon was replaced by a more
comic relay of various means of lo
comotion, such as crawling, hopping,
and sprinting.
Olympic Day was neid again in
19415, this time independent of any
other event. It then disappeared
again until today.
Today's Olympic Day is sponsored
by Cardinals and the four classes. A
torch relay from the Post Office to
Rossotti's is a new feature which has
been added to the old tradition of
games, fun, and interclass rivalry.
