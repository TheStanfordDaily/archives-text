## Members Pledge Full Co-operation In New Program 
### 
I NSA will continue to function in
full operation until the end of the
budget year in June. Jan Robertson,
1 Stanford NSA co-ordinalor, said
that Ex corn's failure to renew the
NSA committee for another year will
not hinder the organization from
Carrying out proposed plans as long
as this year's funds hold out.
Miss Robertson said that NSA
j members are willing to co-operate
j with the ASSU to set up an inde
j pendent student committee to carry
on NSA activities locally if Excom
| calls upon them.
Student Body President Hank
Rosing who ;jpokp out against NSA
; affiliation last. Wednesday night, .said
he felt that the group's work locally
I had been very good and that the
ASSU would ask the students in NSA
i to build up a new Stanford organiza
! tion to continue the work.
Meanwhile, Miss Robertson and
Hank Grandin, Excom representa
tive, are. planning a letter to state
Stanford's disaffiliation with NSA.
The Stanford co-ordinator said
that Excom's move to dis
affiliate came as a surprise to NSA,
but that the group wa.> not bitter at
losing its status. She said that the
j local NSA committee will continue
j to work on projects and ideas which
; will benefit Stanford in the future
! before closing up shop in June.
Chief arguments against NSA at
Stanford war; the high cost, which
| totalled $ 1 ,094 this past year, not
I $1,294 as mistakenly printed last
[ week. NSA opponents felt that. Stan
| ford did not get its money's worth
out of national affiliation.
| In its letter to the national NSA
I office, Excom explained that vSt.an
[ ford's affiliation was no longer in ac
j cord with the best interests of the
| student body. NSA was commended
| for performing a great service to the
] college community.
The letter explained that NSA
| functions locally would be continued
by some kind of service committee
I under the ASSU.
