# Memorial Church Performance Of Bach B Minor Mass Lauded
## 
### 
Campus and Palo Alto music-lov
crs who crowded into the Memo
rial Church last Friday to hear
Bach's B Minor Mass were treated
to a truly beautiful musical expe
rience.
As the last in a series of 12 con
certs commemorating the 200 th an
niversary of Bach's death, the per
formance was a suitable tribute to
the genius of a great musician.
The demanding task of directing
the combined talents of the Stanford
University Chorus and Orchestra
and five soloists was handled by
conductor Harold C. Schmidt with
a depth of perception which was
always adequate, and sometimes
brilliant. Credit is also due Sandor
Salgo, who trained the orchestra.
Margaret Burns, contralto, and
James Schwabacher, tenor, were

excellent, in their solo parts. Miss
Burns controlled her voice which
produced a richness of tone
achieved only by those with broad
musical experience. Schwabacher's
voice had a sweet quality which
reached near-perfection in the high |
notes of the "Benedictus."
June Preston and Ann Shaw
Price were adequate in their roles I
of first and second soprano. Miss
Preston, especially, had a voice im- j
bucd with a pleasant freshness.
Donald Morgan, bass, had a tremu
lous quality, especially in the lower
registers, which for this reviewer
offset his emotional appreciation of j
the role.
The orchestra was controlled by j
Mr. Schmidt so that it never 1
drowned out the chorus, and even I
more difficult, the vocal solos and
duets; yet, it was always ready to :
respond during the short interludes j
when it played alone.
The flute was very effective in
the "Domino Deus" duet of first so
prano and second tenor, and again ;
in the latter prat of the perform
ance.
Except in the "Confitcor unum j
Baptisms," the chorus maintained
its fidelity of pitch throughout the
entiie performance, and this was
quickly regained in the case men- J
tioned.
It is difficult to single out any
particular choruses for being more
beautiful than others, but this re
viewer was most impressed with the
reverent interpretation of the poi
gnant "Qui tollis," and the sustained
tonal quality of the "Credo in unum
Deum."
These were matched on'y by the '
transposition from the triple pianis- j
simo of the "Crucifixus" to the forte i

of "Et resurrexit," and the contrast
between the booming bass, and thr
delicate soprano of the powerful
"Sanctus."
I'ho R Minor Mass performance
is an indication of the musical tal
ent of Stanford, and the attendance
showed that the campus appreciates
this talent.—W. N. S.

and five soloists was handled by
conductor Harold C. Schmidt with
a depth of perception which was
always adequate, and sometimes
brilliant. Credit is also due Sandor
Salgo, who trained the orchestra.
Margaret Burns, contralto, and
James Schwabacher, tenor, were

excellent, in their solo parts. Miss
Burns controlled her voice which
produced a richness of tone
achieved only by those with broad
musical experience. Schwabacher's
voice had a sweet quality which
reached near-perfection in the high |
notes of the "Benedictus."
June Preston and Ann Shaw
Price were adequate in their roles I
of first and second soprano. Miss
Preston, especially, had a voice im- j
bucd with a pleasant freshness.
Donald Morgan, bass, had a tremu
lous quality, especially in the lower
registers, which for this reviewer
offset his emotional appreciation of j
the role.
The orchestra was controlled by j
Mr. Schmidt so that it never 1
drowned out the chorus, and even I
more difficult, the vocal solos and
duets; yet, it was always ready to :
respond during the short interludes j
when it played alone.
The flute was very effective in
the "Domino Deus" duet of first so
prano and second tenor, and again ;
in the latter prat of the perform
ance.
Except in the "Confitcor unum j
Baptisms," the chorus maintained
its fidelity of pitch throughout the
entiie performance, and this was
quickly regained in the case men- J
tioned.
It is difficult to single out any
particular choruses for being more
beautiful than others, but this re
viewer was most impressed with the
reverent interpretation of the poi
gnant "Qui tollis," and the sustained
tonal quality of the "Credo in unum
Deum."
These were matched on'y by the '
transposition from the triple pianis- j
simo of the "Crucifixus" to the forte i

of "Et resurrexit," and the contrast
between the booming bass, and thr
delicate soprano of the powerful
"Sanctus."
I'ho R Minor Mass performance
is an indication of the musical tal
ent of Stanford, and the attendance
showed that the campus appreciates
this talent.—W. N. S.

Campus and Palo Alto music-lov
crs who crowded into the Memo
rial Church last Friday to hear
Bach's B Minor Mass were treated
to a truly beautiful musical expe
rience.
As the last in a series of 12 con
certs commemorating the 200 th an
niversary of Bach's death, the per
formance was a suitable tribute to
the genius of a great musician.
