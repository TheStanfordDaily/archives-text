# $34,200 Budget Is Set By Excom for 1950-51
## Funds for Men's Club Boosted; Debate, Cardinals, Rally Com Cut 
### AL McCOMBS 
Bleary-eyed from their second consecutive after-midnight ses
sion, Excom members approved Student Manager John Lilientbal's
$34,200 budget for 1950 -51 early Friday morning, after using up a
$75 surplus and scrapping chunks off the tentatively-approved ad
ministrative board allotments to give a financial boost to Men's

Glee and International Club.
A plea for financial help from Buzz
Howe, president of Men's Glee, sent
the tired student representatives into
an hour-long search for extra money.
The budget was finally approved,
sans surplus, at 1:40 a.m., six hours
after Excom went into session.
To placate an all-or-nothing re
quest of the Men's Glee, Excom
I scrapped $35 from the already ap-
I proved Cardinal's budget, $80 from
Rally Committee, $30 from the De
bate Society, find $35 more ofl Cardi
nals, giving the singers $180 in .stu
dent body funds to build up their or
ganization.
Consecu'ivc motions to take $100
i from Cardinals, $25 from lIR, $25 off
' Cardinals, and to adjourn to finish
I the budget Monday, were all de-
I feated.
Exlcom .started trimming Cardi
nals' $3,97.'i allotment shortly before
| midnight when lIR president Dave
I Chan and International Club presi
i dent Henry Schaetti asked for $140
) for I Club under the lIR budget. An
j accumulated $75 budget surplus was
| given to I Club along with $63 from
1 Cardinals.
Cardinals Cut
Cardinals ended up with $3,640,
I $135 under the original sum, ap-
J proved.
A motion to give I Club $65 out
ot the $4,200 contingency fund was
I talked down by Lilienthal, who was
i forced to use high-pressure tactics
( throughout the evening to defend the
I emergency allotment. Lilienthal
earlier in the evening expressed con
cern that the fund had "little enough"
j money in it.
Dave Elliott, next, year's student
i manager, helped Lilienthal present
i the budget.
Excom whisked through income
j and administration expenses earlier
| in the evening and approved Lilien
! thal's figures as they stood until
' coming to the Rally Committee
budget at 11 o'clock.
Tuition Fees
Li lien thal's budget showed $30,750
of the $34,200 income coming from
j students' fees paid in the University
| tuition. Based on estimates given by
; the- Registrar's office for enrollment
' next year, $27,000 was set down for
the three quarters, $1.25 per stu
dent with an average of 7,200 stu-
I dents a quarter.
I Fees from summer quarter stu

dents are $1.50. It is estimated that
3,750 students will attena in the sum
mer of 1951.
Lilienthal said he expected drops
in income from both the Sunday
Evening Movies and Dividex adver
tising revenue.
On-the expense side of the ledger,
he explained that the ASSU presi
dent's $500 was to cover travel ex -
penses, including a* convention, and
other expenses incurred in office. An
equal amount provided for Excom
administration includes money for
the social committee and the pro
posed committee which will take
over NSA's local work.
Next year the ASSU will provide
tuition and travel expenses for four
foreign scholarship students and aid
in the expenses of a University
sponsored Berlin exchange student
with $5,460. ASSU expense for seven
foreign scholarship students this year
was $5,250, with $1,300 coming from
outside sources.
In answer to a question as to
whether the ASSU ofiice was operat
ing under maximum efficiency under
a $5,700 deficit—s2,loo more than
1949-50—Lilienthal defended the op
erations by saying that certain in
come from accounting fees had been
removed from the office, creating a
greater deficit. The deficit, is ex
pense of operations over and above
income received from accounting
charges, Lilienthal said.
Orientation Unit
ASSU President Hank Rosin said
the office was extremely valuable as
a co-ordinating and orientation unit
for student officers, and well worth
the money.
With administration expenses ap
proved, Excom turned to Admin
istration Boards' expenses and turned
down a request by the Debate So
ciety for an additional $355. Torn
Brand, debate president, said that
the society wanted $330 to send two
debaters to Hawaii at the request of
the University of Hawaii. The other
$25 was for guests at. en end-of-year
dinner.
Rally Coin's budget was reduced
$50 before approved, and a $200 de
ficit under Cardinals for Con Home
barbecue expense was transferred to
the contingency fund.
With the AWS and IIR budgets to
be approved, review of figures was
temporarily held up when Hank
Grandin, graduate representative,
asked for more consideration of the
graduate students who didn't find
the time to enter many campus ac
tivities and failed to get much out of
the budget. His request was backed
up by Graduate Representative Rex
Johnson.
The graduate issue was sidetracked
by President Rosin, who asked that,
the two representatives bring up ti e
matter at a later time when they had
something concrete planned.
AWS Budget
Tho AWS budget of $1,120 was
passed without a hitch shortly before
Excom tackled IIR and the Men..
Glee Club.
Lilienthal told Excom earlier that,
thr ASSU had a $50,000 nest egg

Lilienthal said he expected drops
in income from both the Sunday
Evening Movies and Dividex adver
tising revenue.
On-the expense side of the ledger,
he explained that the ASSU presi
dent's $500 was to cover travel ex -
penses, including a* convention, and
other expenses incurred in office. An
equal amount provided for Excom
administration includes money for
the social committee and the pro
posed committee which will take
over NSA's local work.
Next year the ASSU will provide
tuition and travel expenses for four
foreign scholarship students and aid
in the expenses of a University
sponsored Berlin exchange student
with $5,460. ASSU expense for seven
foreign scholarship students this year
was $5,250, with $1,300 coming from
outside sources.
In answer to a question as to
whether the ASSU ofiice was operat
ing under maximum efficiency under
a $5,700 deficit—s2,loo more than
1949-50—Lilienthal defended the op
erations by saying that certain in
come from accounting fees had been
removed from the office, creating a
greater deficit. The deficit, is ex
pense of operations over and above
income received from accounting
charges, Lilienthal said.
Orientation Unit
ASSU President Hank Rosin said
the office was extremely valuable as
a co-ordinating and orientation unit
for student officers, and well worth
the money.
With administration expenses ap
proved, Excom turned to Admin
istration Boards' expenses and turned
down a request by the Debate So
ciety for an additional $355. Torn
Brand, debate president, said that
the society wanted $330 to send two
debaters to Hawaii at the request of
the University of Hawaii. The other
$25 was for guests at. en end-of-year
dinner.
Rally Coin's budget was reduced
$50 before approved, and a $200 de
ficit under Cardinals for Con Home
barbecue expense was transferred to
the contingency fund.
With the AWS and IIR budgets to
be approved, review of figures was
temporarily held up when Hank
Grandin, graduate representative,
asked for more consideration of the
graduate students who didn't find
the time to enter many campus ac
tivities and failed to get much out of
the budget. His request was backed
up by Graduate Representative Rex
Johnson.
The graduate issue was sidetracked
by President Rosin, who asked that,
the two representatives bring up ti e
matter at a later time when they had
something concrete planned.

JOHN LIMENTHAL
—ASSU Student Manager
Bleary-eyed from their second consecutive after-midnight ses
sion, Excom members approved Student Manager John Lilientbal's
$34,200 budget for 1950 -51 early Friday morning, after using up a
$75 surplus and scrapping chunks off the tentatively-approved ad
ministrative board allotments to give a financial boost to Men's

Glee and International Club.
A plea for financial help from Buzz
Howe, president of Men's Glee, sent
the tired student representatives into
an hour-long search for extra money.
The budget was finally approved,
sans surplus, at 1:40 a.m., six hours
after Excom went into session.
To placate an all-or-nothing re
quest of the Men's Glee, Excom
I scrapped $35 from the already ap-
I proved Cardinal's budget, $80 from
Rally Committee, $30 from the De
bate Society, find $35 more ofl Cardi
nals, giving the singers $180 in .stu
dent body funds to build up their or
ganization.
Consecu'ivc motions to take $100
i from Cardinals, $25 from lIR, $25 off
' Cardinals, and to adjourn to finish
I the budget Monday, were all de-
I feated.
Exlcom .started trimming Cardi

Cardinals ended up with $3,640,

J proved.
A motion to give I Club $65 out
ot the $4,200 contingency fund was
I talked down by Lilienthal, who was
i forced to use high-pressure tactics
( throughout the evening to defend the
I emergency allotment. Lilienthal
earlier in the evening expressed con
cern that the fund had "little enough"
j money in it.
Dave Elliott, next, year's student
i manager, helped Lilienthal present
i the budget.
Excom whisked through income

' next year, $27,000 was set down for
the three quarters, $1.25 per stu

I dents a quarter.
