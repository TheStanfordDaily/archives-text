TOKYO â€” The American naval
commander in the Far East flatly
denied today a Russian report that
the United States has turned over
to the Japanese 27 frigates as a
nucleus for a navy.
Vice Adm. Charles T. Joy said all
27 frigates, which Russia returned
after getting them under wartime
lend-lease, arc at Yokosuka Naval
Base in "caretaker status." This
moans the ships arc being preserved
but not in use.
Rear Adm. Benton Decker, Yoko
suka base commander, .said the
Russian report is "untrue."
