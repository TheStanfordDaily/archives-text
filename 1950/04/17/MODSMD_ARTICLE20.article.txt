Work is well under way behind
the campus on a six-foot pipeline j
which will bring fresh water to the j
city of San Francisco from its j
Hetch Hetchy mountain source.
A mile of huge trench has already j
been Hug through the bills west of j
Foothill Road by Rados and Ar
tucktovich, Los Angeles contractors
who are building the iine from La
throp Hill south for 17 miles.
Another firm, laying pipe from |
the north, is expected to reach !
Stanfoid property within three j
months. At. that time, a trench wiil ;
be dug through the 17th green and j
I.Bth fairway of the golf course and
tunnel through Lathrop Hill to join
the other half of the line.
Meanwhile, the University is ne
gotiating with the city of San Fran- j
cisco for the price of the land be- j
ing used. Under state law, San j
Francisco was able to condemn the i
land, and the exact 40.6 acres need
ed has already been settled with j
the University.
Despite objections to the price of J
the land, the city of San Francisco
was permitted by coui t order to
begin on the University land. Ulti- j
mately, plans call for laying a total :
of four six-foot pipes, one every 10
years.
