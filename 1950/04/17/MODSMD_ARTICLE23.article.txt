Hrfcie I left home my mother took me aside, sat mo
<n her ample lap and warned me of the many pittalls
1 would find at college. "Beware," she said, us she
brushed away the hayseed from behind my ear, "of
the giil.s you will meet in college."
"Oh gosh, Momsie, I'm not afraid of girls." I had
â€¢ een them walking around under tlieir pigtails and
they looked ail right to me.
"Son, believe me, the female is the deadlier of the
species."
"But, Momsie, I know all about girl . Didn't I go
to the senior prom, didn't 1?"
"Sonny boy, you've lived a sheltered life in ibis here
tenement district, I fear for you when you get within
reach of those clever college girls." Momsie glowed
with that, maternal urge of the lioness to protect her
cub.
When I got to college, 1 led the life of all other col
lege boys, studying like all get out; burying myself in
the library and seeing the light of the sun only be
t ween classes.
It happened one day in the library while 1 was
I l acing the movement of a tiny insect across the pages
of my Western Civ book. 1 lift.* d my eyes from the
tome, and there she was. She was a freshman. I
could tell by her affected look of innocence.
She smiled and 1 crumbled under her ga/.e. " What're
you doing 7" she cooed "You big handsome rascal,
you."
J buried my head and then stammered: "Aw.nuthin',
I'm reading all about olden times, and, gosh, is it ever
interesting. What are you reading? I asked her.

"Oh, about things,"s>he answered at length.
"That sure is interesting." I could see the beauty of
her intellect.
"Do you know what? You're different." She placed
her hand on mine.
"Do you really think so?" 1 said in wonder at her
prettiness and the shine on her saddle shoes.
"All the other boys want to do is to drink beer anil
ride around in cars, but you're so solid and respectable
looking, like my daddy."
"Golly willikers." It was the nicest thing anyone
hail ever said to me. Imagine being compared to
.someone's father.
"Do you like poetry?" Her eyes brightened in ex
pectation.
"Sure. 1 read it all the time." 1 reached into my
pocket and pulled out a book of limericks. I quickly
put it back.
"Then we'll be able to read poetry to one another,"
she said. I had met the girl of my dreams. "Mother
told me," she continued, "not to marry the first man
1 met in college, but you're so nice."
"Marry?" 1 ran my finger between my collar and
my neck. "Oh, I've got to get my education before I
think of getting married." I smiled feebly.
"That's an old-fashioned idea. Don't you want to
go out and get a job before they're all taken up, don't
you?" She started to put my arm in a twist arm lock.
1 readied down and scooped up my books.
"I think I'd better be going," I announced.
"If you get up, I'll jab you with this hat pin."
I jumped up and ran for the door, screaming, "Mom
sie was right. Momsie was right."
