# CAMPUS OPINION
## World Government Controversy 
### 
To the Editor:
The case can be solidly presented for considering
the "theories of racial equality, internationalism, and
other such bunk" as foolish for a "white" American.
Certainly there are advantages in holding a from
iiirth membership in the privilege-rich "white" race
in America. Likewise, one can see no nation in the
world today which affords its citizens a higher stand
ard of living.
Yet, as a "white" American, I must confess with
Jefferson that all men are created equal. As a human
being, I must confess a belief that political boundaries
are merely the productions of nun , minds, and that
internationalism is merely the la:.! step in the progres
• ion from family to community to national relation -
: hips.
So it seems that the ideals of internationalism and
racial equality are no more "hunk ' than the the di
vine admonition to, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."
1 would be the first to admit ineptitude in prac
ticing these ideals, but Stanford is a good place to
work at the problem, and after a little self-examina
tion. even Mr. Close might join many of us in trying.

To the Editor:
Recently letters have appeared in The from
people both for and against world government. 1 won
der if either of these groups realizes what effect their
letters have on individuals such as myself, who are
mure or less neutral and willing to be influenced by
cogent, adult arguments on either side of the question.
Actually, both groups make extensive use of such
epithets as "dehydrated she-goats," "asinine," "char
acter assassin," etc., and seem to lie engaged in a
private mud-slinging contest. Eoth sides seem to be
giving an incomplete and one-sided account of the
tacts. I, for one, cannot take either the charges or

promises of either group very seriously so long as
they are made in the present emotional fashion.

Mr. Donald E. Close—Regarding your statement,
"There won't be much love for Brother Jonas among
the veterans of California when they read the vicious
remarks about their fraternal organizations."
We, the undersigned, believe that:
1. The order of the planetary spheres, beginning
with that nearest the central Earth, is as follows:
Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
The Firmament (or sphere of the fixed stars), and the
Primum Mobile.
2. It was only natural that the World Federalists
should come to naught, since the hearing was held
under the sign of Aries and its corresponding element
Fire, which has choler as its humor, its seat in the
gall bladder, and Mars as its planet.
3. The American Legion and the VFW represent the
wisdom of "the best of all possible worlds."

In answer to Mr. Donald Close's letter to Campus
Opinion in the April 12 edition of The Daily, the Palo
Alto-Stanford chapter of the Young Republicans
would appreciate your printing the following state
ment:
Mr. Close's remarks do not represent the views or
the opinions of this organization, and must be taken
as his own personal comments.

Palo Alto-Stanford Young

To the Editor:
Mr. Donald E. Close—Regarding your statement,
"There won't be much love for Brother Jonas among
the veterans of California when they read the vicious
remarks about their fraternal organizations."
We, the undersigned, believe that:
1. The order of the planetary spheres, beginning
with that nearest the central Earth, is as follows:
Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
The Firmament (or sphere of the fixed stars), and the
Primum Mobile.
2. It was only natural that the World Federalists
should come to naught, since the hearing was held
under the sign of Aries and its corresponding element
Fire, which has choler as its humor, its seat in the
gall bladder, and Mars as its planet.
3. The American Legion and the VFW represent the
wisdom of "the best of all possible worlds."

To the Editor:
The case can be solidly presented for considering
the "theories of racial equality, internationalism, and
other such bunk" as foolish for a "white" American.
Certainly there are advantages in holding a from
iiirth membership in the privilege-rich "white" race
in America. Likewise, one can see no nation in the
world today which affords its citizens a higher stand
ard of living.
Yet, as a "white" American, I must confess with
Jefferson that all men are created equal. As a human
being, I must confess a belief that political boundaries
are merely the productions of nun , minds, and that
internationalism is merely the la:.! step in the progres
• ion from family to community to national relation -
: hips.
So it seems that the ideals of internationalism and
racial equality are no more "hunk ' than the the di
vine admonition to, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."
1 would be the first to admit ineptitude in prac
ticing these ideals, but Stanford is a good place to
work at the problem, and after a little self-examina
tion. even Mr. Close might join many of us in trying.

To the Editor:
Recently letters have appeared in The from
people both for and against world government. 1 won
der if either of these groups realizes what effect their
letters have on individuals such as myself, who are
mure or less neutral and willing to be influenced by
cogent, adult arguments on either side of the question.
Actually, both groups make extensive use of such
epithets as "dehydrated she-goats," "asinine," "char
acter assassin," etc., and seem to lie engaged in a
private mud-slinging contest. Eoth sides seem to be
giving an incomplete and one-sided account of the
tacts. I, for one, cannot take either the charges or

promises of either group very seriously so long as
they are made in the present emotional fashion.
