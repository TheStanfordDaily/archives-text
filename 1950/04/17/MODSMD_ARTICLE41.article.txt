# Poloists Open Season; Down SF Club, 12 to 7
## 
### 
Stanford's polo squad whipped
the San Francisco Polo Club 12 to ,7
in the first game of the Pacific Coast
Polo League at Golden Gate Park
yesterday afternoon. It was sweet
revenge for the Cards who suffered
a 15 to 3 drubbing from the unde
feated champions last year.
The three-goal handicap of the
more experienced San Francisco
club proved unnecessary for t)u>
hard-riding teamwork of the Card
squad.
