# Horsehiders Win 5 to 2; Annex California Series
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's varsity baseballers
took the California series for thi
second consecutive year Saturday
afternoon, when they dumped the
Bears 5 to 2 in a top-notch ball
game on the Berkeley campus. In
so doing, the Indian nine remained
just half a game behind the cur
rent pace - setters in the red - hot
CIBA race, St. Mary's, who were
thumping UCLA 11 to 5 at Moraga.
The Indians' outstanding sopho
more chucker, Joe Chez, who de
feated the Bears 4 to 3 last Mon
day, tangled with Cal's Andy Sta
gnaro in what was a tight pitchers'
duel for six innings. Both pitchers
received excellent support from
their defensive mates, as the two
teams turned in outstanding field
ing performances that were steady
and often spectacular.
At the plate the Indians finally
j>ot their hitting attack into high
gear with 12 hits as the first four
men in the batting order each col
lected a pair of base hits.
California drew first blood in
their half of the first inning, when
they put together a pair of singles
for one run.
Klein Homers
Bud Klein, first man up in the
Indians' half of the fourth frame,
evened the count when he stepped
into one of Stagnaro's offerings and
sent it blazing into left field. By
the time Bear left fielder Pete Co
rona picked it out of the grass
under the 538-foot mark, Klein had
completed his trip around the bases
and was crossing home plate.
Klein put the Indians ahead in
the sixth frame when he lined a
single over second, advanced to sec
ond on a wild pitch, and scored on
Dave Melton's line single into left
field.
In the seventh inning a double by

Tom Shaw and consecutive singles
by Bill Herron, Joe Chez, and Cam
eron brought across two more runs
and sent Stagnaro to the showers.
A double play by tlu- Cal infield
behind reliefer Bill Gear shut off
the Card rally.
Insurance Kun
The Cards picked up an insur
ance run off the Bears in the eighth
as Cole singled, stole second, and
took third on an overthrow at sec
ond. Cole scored the Indians' final
run as Cleyg grounded out.
Bear mentor Clint Evans threw
four southpaw pinch - hitters at
Chez in the ninth frame in a vain
attempt to net back in the game.
The Bears were able to put together
three singles to score a lone run
before Chez struck out Al Davie.s
to end the game.
