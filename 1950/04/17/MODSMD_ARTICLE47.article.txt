# Sponsors Like Their Work--and Freshmen
## 
### JOY HAAS 
It may seem strange that inde
pendent Stanford women indi
rectly owe their 26-year old
Women Sponsor's program to a
Pan-Hellenic Law, but sucn is the
case.
The sorority girls, Meribcth Cam
eron, Anna Fitzhugh, and a third
unidentified girl, got the ball rolling
on the sponsoring plan one night
back in 1924.
They invaded the home of former
Dean Mary Yost at about !) o'clock
She had retired for the evening, but
allowed the eager girls to present
their plan us they perched at her
bedside.
As sorority women, they weren't
permitted to talk with freshman girls
until rush started in winter quarter.
They felt left out and presented Dean
Mary with a plan to revise Pan-
Hellenic law so they would be per
mitted to live in Roble for one year
and help the independent women in
troduce freshmen to the Fartji.
31 This Year
The number of sponsors has grown
from the original list of 12 to 31 this
year, and 28 with live alternates set
for next.
In the beginning, sponsors were
chosen through recommendation of
the Roble director, sorority house
mothers, and out-going sponsors.
Now, girls who are interested file ap
plication in the ASSU ofiice and arc
interviewed and selected by a spon
sor choosing committee under AWS.

The girls come three days early for j
an intensive training program. Here
they find answers to pre-conceived |
problems that might arise so that
they are prepared lor almost any I
emergency. However, one sponsor i

recalled a crisis that hadn't been clis - |
cussed in the briefing program. She
received a phone call from a fresh
man boy who had been stood up for
I a hayride that night. After explain
ing his plight, he said he'd give her |

live minutes to find him another
date.
Answering Questions
As the first big questions arc
I answered, such as, "Where is the
I Cellar?, the Quad?" Then the sponsor
settles down to the individual prob
lems of the girls in her corridor.
Men sponsors often joke about their
| feminine counterparts, saying theii
I main job consists of playing nurse
i maid to homesick girls.
But these comments are ignored
| and the sponsors continue their task
of making information available and
co-ordinating and integrating the ac
tivities of the hall.
Another notion about sponsoring is
! that it is an honor. It is, but that'.:
not the motive that helps a girl de
cide to move away from her friends
and take the time from her studies
; and social life.
"An Experiment"
It is a chance to do something for
! Stanford. To quote a sponsor, ''II
you enjoy working with people, it is
I a marvelous experiment."
Cast in the dual role of student and
| staff member, each sponsor is respon
sible to her living group, to student
i government, and to the administra
: lion.
She must explain the general pic
lure and bring the cloudier aspects of
Stanford to earth in a hurry. She
; must give accurate information about
University policies, scholarships, vo
cational counseling, study habits,
j campus opportunities, and health
matters.

Answering Questions
As the first big questions arc

Why treshmen get grey and sponsors red
It may seem strange that inde
pendent Stanford women indi
rectly owe their 26-year old
Women Sponsor's program to a
Pan-Hellenic Law, but sucn is the
case.
The sorority girls, Meribcth Cam
eron, Anna Fitzhugh, and a third
unidentified girl, got the ball rolling
on the sponsoring plan one night
back in 1924.
They invaded the home of former
Dean Mary Yost at about !) o'clock
She had retired for the evening, but
allowed the eager girls to present
their plan us they perched at her
bedside.
As sorority women, they weren't
permitted to talk with freshman girls
until rush started in winter quarter.
They felt left out and presented Dean
Mary with a plan to revise Pan-
Hellenic law so they would be per
mitted to live in Roble for one year
and help the independent women in
troduce freshmen to the Fartji.
31 This Year
The number of sponsors has grown
from the original list of 12 to 31 this
year, and 28 with live alternates set
for next.
In the beginning, sponsors were
chosen through recommendation of
the Roble director, sorority house
mothers, and out-going sponsors.
Now, girls who are interested file ap
