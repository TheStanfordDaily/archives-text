# NIXON TAKES STAND ON LOYALTY OATH
## Democratic Settlement Advocated 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Congressman Richard Nixon
Calif.) told reporters yesterday at
a press conference that the Univer
sity of California loyalty oath con
troversy "must be settled in a dem
ocratic fashion."
Nixon, who is running for Sena
tor from this state, said that unless
a "satisfactory solution" is reached
before llm April .'»() deadline set by
the University's Board of Regents,
the faculty should sign the oath
anyway but "under public pro
test."
Thru, the Congressman contin
ued, the professors should attempt
tu work out a solution to the prob
lem "either through the courts or
through legislation."
Nixon, who was on the campus
earlier in the day to meet infor
mally with students and professors,
said that continued controversy
over the oath serves only to stir up
the people and hurt the prestige of
the University and the nation.
He said he thought the oath "was
not an effective method" of pie
venting Communists from teaching
in tax-supported schools.
Congressman Nixon also com
mented on the Mundt - Ferguson
Bill—sometimes tilled the Mundt-
Nixon Bill — as exemplary of the
"additional legislation" he felt is
needed against avowed Communists
in the country.
He said he did not believe in out
lawing the Communist party be
cause "no method I know of is ef
fective," and because, by so doing,
"you would run into problems of
definition."
On the other hand, the Mundt-
Ferguson Bill, Nixon continued, is
aimed at exposure and action, and

would accomplish, among other
things, the registration of Soviet
controlled wings of the party.
It would provide for a separate,
independent administrative agency
to determine, by set legislative

standards, what was and was not a
Comunist organization.
Congressman Nixon said the bill
"would take the name-calling out
of the un-American investigations,"
and would serve to combat the

| "Communist fifth column," just as
i the Nazi fifth column whj I>if dm
i ing the war.
Earlier in the Hay, Nixon, com
menting on the international situ
| ation, said tliat "the only hope for
peace is to remain stronger than the
Soviet Union and I mean stronger
militarily, economically, morally,
and socially "
Nixon was invited to the campus
by Skip Athearn, law student and
member of the Young Republican
organization. He visited a group of
professors among whom was Mar
old Shepherd of the Stanford Law
School.
Shepherd was formei dean of the
Dnke University School of Law
where Nixon was graduated
A member of the Un-American
Activities Committee in the House,
Nixon yesterday made his second
appearance on the Stanford campus
since the beginning of the current
school year.
He was here for the first time last
October when the Law School
j sponsored bis talk on "The Case
for Congressional Investigating
Committees."
