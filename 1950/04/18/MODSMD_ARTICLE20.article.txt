"It seems to us not merely appro- j
priate but absolutely essential that j
all members of the academic profes- |
sion, everywhere, throw their weight I
against any infringement of academic
freedom and any attempt, for what
ever reason, to abridge or censor the i
freedom of the intellectual inquiry j
upon which any University worth j
the name must be built.
"We have watched with alarm the
attempts of a segment of the Univer- |
sity of California's Board of Regents
to impose a discriminatory and spe- I
cial oath upon the University's em
ployees, and we have applauded the
efforts of the faculty to resist the
I imposition of any sperial oath. This
| letter is simply an expression of
| thanks of a group of professors and
employees at Stanford University.
You have been fighting our battle,
I and every teacher's and university
j employee's battle, in so spiritedly
fighting your own.
"The enclosed contribution is a
I small indication of our sense of obli
gation, and of our hope that you will

continue your fight until you have
won it.
