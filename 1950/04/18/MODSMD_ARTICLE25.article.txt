# More on Palo Alto Police

Palo Alto Police Chief Howard A. Zink's com
ment on The Daily's Friday editorial, "Pdlo Alto
Police Tactics," was reported in the Palo Alto
Times of the same day.
The Times quotes Chief Zink as stating, in
part, 'The police do not decide the guilt oi in
nocence of persons they arrest in the act of
violating the law."
Suppose Mr. and Mis. Doe are walking down
3 aide street in Palo Alto. Suppose a car stops,
a man attempts to drag Mrs. Doe into the car,
and Mr, Doe naturally enters the fight, just
then a police car approaches,
ii Chiet Zink's policy were to be as strictly
interpreted as in the Severin case, all three
parties would be jailed.
In other words, under this soit of law en
forcement we may be jailed for protecting our
selves or others against unprovoked attack.
And undei this sort of lav/ enforcement Niles

Severin was tossed in jail for defending a
friend.
Chief Zink was quoted Ly the Times as say
ing . . . the men were fighting. Officers
who anested the men said that they were fight
ing. Both men, in court, testified that they had
been fighting."
Oi course they were fighting. Wo never
questioned this point of fact.
We do question the lack of discretion em
ployed by the Palo Alto police when they jailed
a man whose innocence could have been es
tablished so quickly and positively.
If theie had been any difficulty in establish
ing the facts, why was the case dismissed be
fore it went into court?
We do know that in at least one other Penin
sula community, under the same circum
stances, Severin v/ould not have been held.
We do not wish to prolong the issue. By way
of summary, we note only that jailing everyone
who appears to be breaking laws is the easiest
means of law enforcement. It is not the best.
