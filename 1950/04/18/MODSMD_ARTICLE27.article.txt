# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Talk about the end of Ihe world these days is as
cheap as Cellar eoliee and almost as .strong. This
.situation has brought about an increasing avalanche
of hysterical comment, fears, jokes, hilarious laughter,
and more jokes.
Things were summed up la:;t week by an editor

named Robert Bendiner of u
sparsely - circulated weekly, The
Nation, when lie observed that
probably everyone would be pre -
pared with a properly ironic com
ment should the end really come.
He believed that habits being
what they are—the press of the
Day Before would handle the
last-approaching calamity in a
definite style, so in honor of jokes
and with slight apologies to Rob
ert Bendiner and to the editors of

Time Magazine who passed the word along, we give
you the Bull Session's slightly-switched and balled-lip
version of the Last Morning's headlines:
New York Times—
END OF WORLD FORESEEN IN 24 MOCKS
Slock Prices Tumble to Record Lous
San Francisco Call-Bulletin—
F.D.R. PLANNED WORLD'S END AT YALTA

W.R.H. SAYS 'HAVE FAITH'

The Nation—
By the time this issue reaches our readers they will
no doubt have changed their addresses —for the better,
we hope. In the excitement that will accompany the
destruction of our planet, there will be a strong ten
dency to overlook the cause of the catastrophe and a
failure to fix responsibility. Therefore, until we have
a thorough investigation, voters are bound to wonder
. . . . Was it collision or collusion?
Time—
As it must to all, death comes tomorrow to tired,
harried, war-haunted Mother Earth. Sixth in size of
the solar system's nine whirling satellites, third in dis
tance from the sun, Earth aione has Man, was from
the htait hailed as planet most likely to fail.
ltull Session—
Aw, what the hell, have another beer S«-e you next
time around.
