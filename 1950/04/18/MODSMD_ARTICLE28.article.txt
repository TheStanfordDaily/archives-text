Excom and ihc NSA

To the Editor:
Last week, by voW: of Excom, Stanford was dis
affiliated with NSA In this action, Excom combined
two essentially distinct issues which should have been
clarified and considered separately. The first issue
was, or should have been, concerned with affirmation
or denial of the value of whole of NSA and Stan
ford's inclination 01 disinclination to support its pur
poses by membership in it, in terms of this stated
value.

Only then shoulil the second issue have l.een con
sidered, viz., Stanford's ability to continue its mem
bership in NSA by the allocation of a portion ol the
ASSU budget to that organization. The second issue
should have been considered at Excom's regular
budget hearings, and in that it was implicitly made a
part of the first issue, Excom's action was unjustified.
As Excom's action stands, il appears as a direct de
nail of the justification of NSA's continued operation
on this campus, regardless of financial ability or in
ability to support il.
