Varied Projects
Some of the varied projects which

summer work programs in Europe,
to announce scholarships and grants
(of which UNESCO itself offers
many) to foreign universities, and
to plan tours to these countries.
By taking an active part in the

UN model assembly, by giving teas
at which exchange students meet,
and by distributing pamphlets on
foreign countries and UN activities
in foreign countries, UNESCO has
tried to accomplish its purpose of
relating UNESCO tu student life.

understanding of people, gives fresh
impulses to popular education and
the spread of culture, and main
tains, increases, and diffuses knowl
