## Kreitz, Buck Out For Year; Gaylord Back 
### 
Stanford's hard-luck track team
received another severe blow yes
terday when it was learned that
Durrell Kreitz, who smashed into a
hurdle lust Saturday, would be defi
nitely out for the remainder of the
season because of a snapped ham
string muscle.
In a preliminary inspection Sat- (
urday, it appeared that Kreitz suf
fered only from a broken toenail,
but upon examination yesterday the ;
severe muscle injury was reveajed. !
An operation on Kreitz's leg will
be performed this week. It is the
same muscle injury that kept the
big Card hurdler out last season.
In addition, Ronnie Buck, who
ran a 9.8 hundred against the
Olympic Club three Saturdays ago,
will be out for at least three weeks.
Buck pulled a muscle in the start j
of the 100-yard dash in the USC |
meet. He may be out for the sea- j
son.
On the good side of the ledger, j
Gay Bryan turned out for practice
in the Stadium yesterday, and ap- j
poured to be in pretty fair shape ;
after his double win in the triangu- j

lar meet last Saturday.
With only a practice meet on slate
next weekend, Bryan should be
ready to go against UCLA on the
29th and Cal on May G.
Stanford's distance corps, which
was extremely weak against the
Trojans, seems to be getting strong
er every day. Veteran A 1 Lyons
finally is shaking off his sinus
troubles and two-miler John Kaut
man is recovering quickly from his
sprained ankle. Ol course, soph
John Woolev' 4:23 mile last Satur
day was the distance corps' great
est boost.
