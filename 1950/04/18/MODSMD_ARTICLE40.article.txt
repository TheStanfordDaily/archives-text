# Major Leagues Open Today
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Happy Chandler's two favorite
leagues —the American and Nation
al—get off to their annual Tuesday
afternoon start today for the first
lap of the 154-game route.
Eight cities, with all flags flying,
will host the opening-day activities,
but the center of attention will be
focused almost solely on Fenway
Park in Boston where New York's
world champion Yanks will open
against the world favored Boston
Bosox.
Joe McCarthy's Boston boys, who
■ have missed by sliver-thin margins
; the past two years, have been made
top 13-10 choice for the American
campaign, and Brooklyn's strong
: armed Dodgers are ti-5 to repeat in
! the National.
However, backers for the Yanks
! are picking up steam since Joe Di
mag turned up healthy during the
t final practice week to whack out
' two home runs and a host of hits
| to zoom his spring average to .407.
; highest in the Bomber camp.
Other dark horse entries to the
Hot Chance list include St.
Louie Cards, if they start getting
that missing pitching; Detroit's
1 Newhouser - led Tigers; the fleet
Philly Phillies; and the Cleveland
1 Indians, bless the Indians.
The best excuses for a quick San
; Francisco or Los Angeles infiltra
! tion into the Big Time will prob
ably be Steve Canyon's St. Louis
Browns, Wrigley's Chi Cubs, and
' the poor old tired Washington Nats.
