# Sigs Shut Out Theta Delt Softballers; Dekes Win
## 
### 
A red-hot Sigma Chi nine, under
j the capable hurling ol Ken La
: Crosse, shut out the Theta Delt
| softballers 5-4 in an intramural
; duel yesterday afternoon.
Sig Bill Dailey, who was first man
to the plate, started a string of
walks and runs from Theta Delt
inoundsman Bob Anderson. Three
; minutes into the game Denny Tuf
fanelli connected bringing in Dai
; ley. Rounding out the top of the
first inning, Ken LaCrosse stepped
into an Anderson pitch and blasted
a triple for Sigma Chi.
On the other side the Theta Delt
j stick men just could not find the
I speedy submarine pitch of La
; Crosse. Even though LaCrosse did
not have full control, not one Theta
Delt crossed the plate. When the
Theta Delts loaded the bases at the
bottom of the second frame, La-
Crosse coolly fanned Dick Snell and
| grounded out Norm Brown to pull
his Sig brothers out of a dangerous
hole. Sig Bill Dailey's constant hit
ting and Theta Delt Ted LeVino's
! accurate arm were outstanding con-
I tributions to the five-inning fray.
J In a pitchers' duel the Dekes, led

by hurler Byron Thompson, out
scored the Alpha Sigs 13-5. Claude
Weingand, Alpha Sig pitcher, was
assisted by the excellent support of
Chuck Bell and Bob Frederickson.
For the victorious Dekes Starkey
homered, Peckham tripled, and Mc-
Clung scored three runs.
