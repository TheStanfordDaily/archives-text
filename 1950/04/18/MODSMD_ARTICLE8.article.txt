# Councils Try Two Seniors For Copying
## Student Crammed Then Forgot How To Work Problem 
### 
Two Honor Code cases were
tried before Men's and Wom
en's Councils early this quarter, !
with one student found guilty ,
, and another cleared of charges.
The guilty student, h senior man, (
I was convicted of cheating on a final
! examination, and was given a one- j
: quarter suspension from Stanford
and an "F" in the course.
I Copying of another student's paper \
j in a crowded test room was tho in- j
j fraction in this case. The course in
| structor noted a marked similarity !
j lie (worn incorrect answers, and noli- !
: ficd tho Dean's Office.
Acts On Impulse
The student whose work was
j copied was exonerated, as the Coun
j oil felt he was not aware of the copy- I
| ing. The guilty student admitted
j cheating, and said that lii.% act was
simply an impulse and that he had
I no excuse.
A complete exoneration was
j granted another student, also accused
I of copying on a final exam.
A few days following the test, the
course instructor asked this senior to i
explain how he got certain answer:;, j
j The department involved was not i
I satisfied with the explanation.
'Had Crammed'
When he appeared before the I
I Councils, the student said he had
crammed for the test, and then im- !
j mediately forgotten how t.o work the I
j problems. He was unanimously j
j cleared.
| Men's Council also cleared its j
books of the case of the student
| whose car damaged several Row j
lawns late last quarter,
The student was found guilty of
! negligence, since he had left his keys j
in his parked ear. He was fined $25 '
i and will not be allowed to keep a |
j car on campus for two quarters.
Lawns flowed
The damage occurred last, quarter
i in the early morning hours when the
j car was supposedly in a fraternity
I parking lot. Shortly after the ear
j had been parked, it was found scv- !
oral blocks away by the police, who j
identified it as the car which had
J plowed over several lawns.
Police were not able to find the
! driver, and Men's Council felt that i
i the owner, who left his keys in the
j car, was guilty of negligence, since
I the car was his liability.
The student pleaded that he
thought the lake was open. However, i
the Council felt that the absence of a
j lifeguard and the posting of open
hours in The Daily made the matter
i clear enough to discount, any con- ;
fusion.

i the owner, who left his keys in the
j car, was guilty of negligence, since
I the car was his liability.
The student pleaded that he

Two Honor Code cases were
tried before Men's and Wom
en's Councils early this quarter, !
with one student found guilty ,
, and another cleared of charges.
The guilty student, h senior man, (
I was convicted of cheating on a final
! examination, and was given a one- j

and an "F" in the course.
