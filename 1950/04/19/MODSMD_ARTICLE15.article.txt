Depending on the size of the class
of '54, either 14 or 1.5 sponsors will
be chosen. The sponsors will be given

| to givr' up a good deal of time, said
Mrs, Ellcne Sumner, resident director
I of Encina.
The sponsors must be representa
tive Stanford men," continued Mrs.
Sumner. "They must be capable of
developing leaders among the fresh
men."
Under the present system, there is
one sponsor for each wing of 50 fresh
men. During the fall quarter, the
sponsors are the executive committee
I of the hall, but during the winter and
spring quarters, the freshmen gradu
ally take the power. This is in line
with the development of leadership
among the freshmen.
