# U.S. Asks Indemnity
## 
### 
W A S II I N G T O Nâ€”'The United
States filed a stern indemnity de
mand on Russia today for what it
termed the "unprovoked destruc
tion" of an unarmed American pa
trol plane and the loss of ten crew
men in the Baltic Sea.
The State Department, in deliver
ing the stiffly-worded note to Mos
cow, rejected outright a Russian
protest that the Navy patrol plane,
missing since April 8, fired on Soviet
fighters over Soviet-controlled Lat
via.
