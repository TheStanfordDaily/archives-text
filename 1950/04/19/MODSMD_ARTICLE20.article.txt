# Student Body Votes on 119 Nominees Today
## 7 Vie for President In ASSU Primary 
### 
Farm students will whittle down a list of 119 candidates with
their ballots in today s primaries. Only the four candidates who
receive the most votes for each office will pass into the final elec
tions next Wednesday.
Cliff Carlsen, Election Board chairman, asked interested stu-

dents, candidates, and their campaign 1
managers not to force their way into
the crowded Niteiy during the bal
lot-counting this afternoon.
A blackboard will be placed out
side the Nitery and results will be
listed on it as soon as the votes are
tallied. In any close racc, he added,
a candidate may check the votes with
the board.
Any candidate who receives a ma
jority of the votes today wins the
election. Final elections are only
necessary for those offices in which a
candidate has received a plurality but
not a majority of the ballots cast.
Carlsen warned all those who are
voting for write-in candidates to
mark an "X" beside their candidate's
name. Otherwise the ballot will be
invalid and the vote will not be
counted.
Voting booths will be open today
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cellar,
Engineering Corner, the Post. Office,
the Main Library, History Corner,
Roble, Lagunita, Geology Corner, the
Village, and in front of the Graduate
