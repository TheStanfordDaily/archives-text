Farm students will whittle down a list of 119 candidates with
their ballots in today s primaries. Only the four candidates who
receive the most votes for each office will pass into the final elec
tions next Wednesday.
Cliff Carlsen, Election Board chairman, asked interested stu-

dents, candidates, and their campaign 1
managers not to force their way into
the crowded Niteiy during the bal
lot-counting this afternoon.
A blackboard will be placed out
side the Nitery and results will be
listed on it as soon as the votes are
tallied. In any close racc, he added,
a candidate may check the votes with
the board.
Any candidate who receives a ma
jority of the votes today wins the
election. Final elections are only
necessary for those offices in which a
candidate has received a plurality but
not a majority of the ballots cast.
Carlsen warned all those who are
voting for write-in candidates to
mark an "X" beside their candidate's
name. Otherwise the ballot will be
invalid and the vote will not be
counted.
Voting booths will be open today
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cellar,
Engineering Corner, the Post. Office,
the Main Library, History Corner,
Roble, Lagunita, Geology Corner, the
Village, and in front of the Graduate
School of Business.
Additional booths, at the Village
and the West, side of Encina Com
mons, will be open from 11:30 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m.
The list of candidates follows. Stu
dents who have notified The Daily of
their intention to be write-in candi
dates arc listed separately.
