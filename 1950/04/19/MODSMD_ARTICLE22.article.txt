### BILL STOLTZE 
Dr. Charles Edwin Friley, presi
dent of lowa State College, spoke
on the subject "The Changing Hori
zon of Science" at Memorial Audi
torium last night in another of the
regular Tuesday Evening Series
lectures.
"It is our task to seek a common
ground on which the sciences and
humanities may work together not
as rivals for the mind of man, but
as full partners in its service," said
Dr. Friley. "This is clearly the ma
jor task for education."
The speaker asserted that man,
uof matter, is now the most impor
tant problem of our civilization.
Many people think salvation comes
by material means, but "there is
good reason and evidence to believe
that science has not made men as
happy as they might be.
"The great scientific advances of
the past 50 years have far outrun
improvements in human relations,"
Dr. Friley continued. "The survival
of our social order largely depends
on the improvement of man him
self. Enduring peace, if it is to come,
will be founded upon the intellec
tual and moral solidarity of the peo
ples of the earth."
In speaking of the significance of
the atomic bomb, Dr. Friley noted
that every scientific process and
technological advance could be used
either for good or for evil. He pre
dicted that its peacetime applica
tions would soon far outstrip its
destructive use, and pointed out
lhat harnessing the bomb for useful
purposes would probably be effect
ed in the next 50 years.
"Many people have come to the
conclusion that man must live in
two worlds—one of science, and one
of ethics and religion," the speaker
asserted. "But no satisfying and
enduring philosophy of life can be
built on such divided allegiance.
The mind cannot serve two masters
and preserve its integrity."
