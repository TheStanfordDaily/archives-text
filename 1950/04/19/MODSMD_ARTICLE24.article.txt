# Farm Profs Protest To Cal Regents
## 
### 
Opposition to the University of
California loyalty oath was still
brewing on the Stanford campus
yesterday as faculty members
signed a second letter—this time to
the UC Board of Regents—protest
ing against the oath.
Release of the contents of the let
ter, said by one signing faculty
member to be "good and strong," is
cxpected this afternoon. The let
ter will be mailed to the Board of
Regents for their consideration to
morrow when they meet to review
their loyalty oath requirement for
the UC faculty.
The letter is said to be a protest
in the interests of academic free
dom, and of content similar to the
letter sent last week to the UC fac
ulty by 245 Stanford faculty and
other employees, supporting the
California staff's stand.

the first letter were the following:

Hoover Institute and Library;
