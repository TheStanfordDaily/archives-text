# A 						Time for Introspection

One of the best studies in the operation of
student government was presented at Excom's
budget meeting last Thursday night. Investi
gation and explanation of the mass of figures
which went to make up the 1950 51 budget
served to outline very clearly the inner work
ings of the numerous campus activities and
also showed up their weak points.
The constitutional yardstick Excom used in
approving the budget allotments was to com
pare the value to the student of each dollar ap
propriated for any one organization with each
dollar appropriated for each and every other or
ganization. Student Manager John Lilienthal
and Excom did a remarkable job in abiding by
ihis difficuJt standard. The hardship of theii po
sition was increased, however, by the lack of
student reaction to many of the activities seek
ing their yearly outlay.
Such organizations as lIR, Debate, Interna
tional Club and Men's Glee appeared to be
victims of student apathy, and certain activities
of Cardinals showed a need for better student
response.
for a long time there has been a doubt in
the student's mind as to the position of lIR on
campus, illustrated by the budget-harrassed
Excom member who wanted to know privately
just what Ilfl's functions were. And when
Il√ü's Dave Chan told Excorn that he estimated
that lIR sent between nine and 14 tons of goods
to Europe since it started work at Stanford, the
student representatives showed amazement.
The Debate Society and International Club
found it necessary to prove to Excom their
value in dollars to the students, and they dis
covered a lack of appreciation for their activi
ties. Needless to say, the Debate Society,
although its request for an increase was re
fused, came off with a sizeable chunk of the
budget for the number of students involved.
The Society failed, however, to show tW de
gree of academic prestige they bring to Stan
ford. A similar prestige is already realized in
the Foreign Scholarship Program. lIR, even
with the verbal support of representative Derek
Bok, did not seem to impress Excom with the
need to help foreign students become part of
the Stanford community once they get here.
"I" Club got its money, but with half-hearted
approval.
Men's Glefr Club was also granted its budget

request but failed to convince the entire Execu
tive Committee that the Club was exceedingly
earnest in its efforts to prove itself. Not many
students are able to say they have heard Men's
Glee sing.
Cardinals' "Back to the Farm" allotment for
next year was questioned in view of the poor
interest in most of this year's program, and the
$1,000 allotted for all-campus activities was
whittled around the edges.
More than once a chairman, pleading for his
cause, cast reflection on the amount of pub
licity given his activity in The Daily. There
was an evident lack of realization that The
Daily is not the only form of publicity media,
and that there are other methods of putting an
organization's activities before the eyes of the
students. lIR should have impressed upon the
students long before this the magnitude of its
operations, and the Glee Club should have ap
peared at more student functions.
The field of arousing student interest has
limitless possibilities, many of which are only
visible to a trained expert in public relations.
Yet it is our feeling that if the participating stu
dents had as much interest in their organiza
tions and as much value to the student body
as they professed, they could erase student
apathy. The organizations mentioned above
are not the only ones falling short in this effort.
We suggest that organizations which feel a
lack of student interest reinvestigate their po
tential and turn it into action. A potential is not
the evidence upon which Excom bases its
budget considerations. Budget considerations
are based on action.
We further suggest that these organizations
take full advantage of the ASSU leadership
program May 12 and 13, at which old and new
officers will have a chance to air their prob
lems and pool their ideas. Groups such as the
Activities Reviewing Committee, the new Stu
dent-Faculty Educational Commission, and the
proposed local counterpart of NSA are other
sources for help.
Time and again Stanford has patted itself on
the back for its high degree of student organ
ization. We hope that this self-congratulation
will not lead to complacency. Student organ
ization must constantly improve to maintain its
high standard of development. A.M.
