# Pre-Election Vandalism
## 
### 
Several times yesterday-campus vandals di
rected their misplaced energies toward mutila
tion of the election bulletin boards located on
History and Engineering corners.
These boards are set up for the benefit of all
candidates for all offices. Election Board went
to a lot of work to provide this means of ac
quainting students with their candidates.
The ASSU financed the entire operation, pay
ing for all materials except photographs, and
the candidates and their supporters prepared
the individual posters.
Yesterday these posters were torn off the
boards and photographs in many cases de
stroyed.
1 hese election bulletin boards are strictly
non-partisan, designed to help make this elec
tion a better one through acquainting more
students with their possible choices for top
ASSU administrative posts.
We hope that the vandals will find a more
harmless outlet for their warped enthusiasm

. . . one that is less costly in terms of other
students' efforts toward better student govern
ment.
