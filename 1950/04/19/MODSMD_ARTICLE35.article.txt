The San Jose State Spartans, operating effectively behind the
seven-hit pitching of an unknown third stringer athletically-named
"Glenn Davis," defeated the Stanford Indians, 6 to 2, yesterday to
walk off with an even split in the 1950 two-game non-Conference
series between the two clubs.
The Spartans sewed up in a hurry by scoring five big runs in

the third inning ofT the Indians'
■ t.u ter, Dave Stott. Three hits, a base
on hulls, and an error at third base
proved to be Stott's undoing. Big
blow of the inning was Mel Stein's
triple to right center with the bases
1 (jailed.
Roger Osenbaugh entered the con
test in the fourth, and did well during
1 he lour frames that he worked. He
gave up only a .single run in the sev
enth. and that was unearned. It was
Osenbamjh's first appearance of the
year for the varsity.
Cole Pulls Through
Charlie Cole drove in both of Stan
ford's runs with two singles to light
lield. Bruce Cameron scored the first
one in the sixth after two were out
us he came home from second on
Cole's safety. Cole moved to second
on an error, and to third on a wild
pitch, but died there as Melton
popped up to the shortstop.
Tlie Cards threatened briefly in the

eighth us Klein tripled to deep center
and Cole singled him home. Klein's
triple, u terrific smash that hit near
j the bottom of the bank out near the
| 500-foot sign, was one of the longest
! balls hit in the Sunken Diamond this
j year. Bud pulled up at third easily,
| and might have stretched it to a
homer inside the park, but there was
J no use takjng chances, with his team
I live runs behind..
