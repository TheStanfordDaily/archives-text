The freshman track team labored
I through their third meet of the sea
i son yesterday afternoon in the Sta
dium, and when the sawdust and
cinders had settled they found that
they were still scoring in the win
j list.
Coach Ray Dean's charges won by
! a 72 to 59 tally against the combined
efforts of Modesto and Menlo jay
cees. The former offered a great
deal more opposition than the latter
! who were able to place in only two
events.
The contest was much closer than
; the score might indicate; the frosh
I were behind in the count with only
! four events to go.
Perhaps because of the heat of
the day or the change of scenery
there were no outstanding perform
j ances. Modesto's two - miler Jen
j nings ran off a brisk 10:8.2 to beat
out the Papooses' George Griffin by
20 yards.
The Stanfords swept the broad
jump with Pete McKay outdistanc
ing his mates at 22 feet 3 inches. He
i was followed by Tom Schabarum

and Russ Stolfi.
