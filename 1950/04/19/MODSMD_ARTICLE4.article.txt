# Nationalists Claim Win
## 
### 
HONG KONCJ—The Chinese Na
tionalists today proclaimed a com
plete victory over the Communist
invaders of Hainan Island. The Red
press and radio did not contradict
them.
So far the battle news all points
in favor of the Nationalists. It in
dicates—but does not confirm—that
the Reds made a big and desperate
effort to take the stronghold and
were bloodily, perhaps disastrously,
repulsed.
