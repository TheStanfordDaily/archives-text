# VARSITY TENNIS
## Indians Dump Santa Clara; To Tangle with COP Today 
### DICK KLEIN 
With another win tucked away
| in their victory belt, the Stanford
J tennis crew meets their toughest
test this afternoon at 2:30. The
I Cards will host the undefeated net- j
| ters from the College of the Pacific :
J today on the varsity courts.
Yesterday, minus the top four
men, the Cards breezed to an easy
; 9-0 scalping of Santa Clara. Kirke
| Mechem, Lucien Barbour, Ernie
, Dußryy, and Tom Lewyn all took
a rest to get ready for today's rug- J
j ged go.
The Broncs offered only token
J opposition, as Coach Elwyn Bugge |
allowed his anxious subs to score |
impressive wins. Only one set was
| dropped in all nine matches. No set
| went over the six-game limit.
George Gentry pummeled the
, Bronc number one man, Norm
Slaught, 6-3. 6-1. Coach Bugge put
j his regular number two doubles
outfit to take the courts in an effort
to sharpen their game. Tom Lewyn
and Ernie Dußray hung up a good
win over Slaught and Henry Ya- j
j mate in straight sets.
Things will be a little different
; against the COP Tigers. The Stock
: ton lads have already pounded out
! a sound win over USF, 5-4, and re- j
main undefeated. Loaded with j
plenty of talent from top to bot- j
; torn, the Tigers will enjoy the fa- j
vorites' role in today's court action. !
I Only a great come-through effort I

by each Card player could keep the
season record clean.
Top Tiger is Hank Pfister, who
has already captured this year's
Northern California Intercollegiate
singles title over spring vacation.
Pfister defeated Conway Catten, of
USF, in the final singles round.
Kirke Mechem, who lost to Catten,
must lace Hank in the top singles.
Coming out of a two-week slump,
Kirke just might have the stulT to
make a match out of it.
The rest of the Tiger squad is
filled with well-known cognomens
of Bay Area tennis tourneys. Clint
Arbuckle, Dane Winric'h, Bob Hall,
Don Hamilton, and Don Jacobus
round out the COP singles dope
sheet. Hamilton, who plays top
doubles with Pfister, was formerly
number one. This gives a fair idea
of the potency of the Tiger team.
