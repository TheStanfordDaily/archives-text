fun with this contest in years past,
and we hope it will be accepted in
the same spirit this year," said Mc-
Kee. In 19.'}6. the last time the con
test was held, it netted $4*ooo for
the Con Home Drive. The year be
fore the total was $2,500. The con
tests were discontinued because it
was felt too much money was being
spent on publicity.
