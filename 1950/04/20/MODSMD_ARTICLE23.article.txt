Hutchins said he had discussed
the plan with faculty leaders at, both
the Berkeley and Los Angeles cam

loyally oath demanded by the re

"This plan," declared Hutchins,

is a matter of universal concern to
universities. We regard the oath as
a very dangerous precedent."
The fund will be used for a year
to help ousted professors get relo
cated, Hutchins said, adding: "Any
university would be glad to gel men
of the caliber of the California fac
