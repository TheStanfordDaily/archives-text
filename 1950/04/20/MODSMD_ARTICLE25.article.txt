# Stanford Faculty Writes Regents
## 
### 
The Stanford faculty, acting in an i
unofficial capacity, sent, a letter of
protest, to the University of Cali
fornia Board of Regents as conflict
over the loyalty oath rose to new
heights yesterday.
The oath will be the principal
subject for consideration at there- j
gents' meeting in Davis tomorrow
The letter from the Stanford fac
ulty was signed by 227 members, 1
and came shortly after a similar j
one sent directly to the UC faculty I
supporting their opposition to the
loyalty oath.
Among the signers were several j
members of the National Academy
of Sciences and several who had
served as presidents of their profes- !
sional societies. Over one - half of j
those who were shown the letter j
signed it. Lack of time did not per- !
mit circulation of the letter among j
the Medical School faculty in San
Francisco.
The letter to the regents stated: '
"As friends of the University of 1
California who are proud of the |
outstanding position the University
has attained under the leadership of
President Sproul, the undersigned
members of the Stnaford faculty !
hereby respectfully protest the ini- j
position of the special loyalty oath i
recently prescribed by your Board. |
"Our protest is based upon the
conviction that no such additional 1
oath is needed to protect the Uni- ;
versity from the subversive influ- J
encc of Communists, that in any
case it would not contribute to its 1
avowed purpose, and that if en- |
forced it would accomplish nothing
but the disruption and ruin of the
University. We regard the issue as
so serious that in our opinion no ,
one interested in higher education
in the West, or in the nation at!
large, should take a neutral stand in
regard to it."
