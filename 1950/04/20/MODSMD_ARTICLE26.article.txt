## 
### 
The Pacific Spectator called the
fight over the UC loyalty oath a crisis
for all universities and all educators
I in an editorial which appeared in the
! quarterly issue on the stands yester
l day.
Written by John W. Dodds, Stan
ford professor of English, the edi
torial pointed out that "it, can happen
here." Continuing, Dodds wrote, "In
dividuals have been forced off college
faculties for being Wallaceites, for
j advocating economic theories locally
I unpopular, for that unhappiest of
j new-made crimes, 'guilt by associa
tion.' These, so far, are isolated in
stances. The resisting UC professors
have taken their stand in behalf of
their remaining isolated."
