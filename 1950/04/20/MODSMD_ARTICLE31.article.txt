"You're from Albuquerque? Imagine." My date,
Muriel, waved a limp palm at Jim's date, one known as
Suzie. "I'm from Santa Fe, myself," she said.
"Why, we're practically neighbors," Suzie rejoined.
"Then you must know Alice Grift and Sarabella
Heekelster. She went with that awful Larry Jergids,"
Muriel chimed, breathlessly.
Jim smiled his tolerant smile and said, "Say girls,
how's for a dance. The orchestra looks lonesome out
there."
"Yea," 1 said, giving them my orie-lwo soft shoe
routine.
"We have plenty of time later. Muriel and I have
so much to talk over, being almost old friends," Suzie
.-.aid.
Muriel continued: "Then you must know Sally Mor
tens and Mary Glibers and Eloise Fenders, too."
"Why, of course," Suzie said. The sound of the two
lost friends rehearsing the roll of social New Mexico
rolled on, occasionally punctuated with an "isn't it
strange ttyat knowing all these people, we've never
met."
I shrugged my shoulders and looked at Jim. He
shrugged back. "Not a bad orchestra," I said.
He yawned, examined his finger nails anil said in
true collegian style, "Hardly an organization given to
intricate and precise renderings, but certainly ade
quate."
"Yea," 1 replied. "Think the Yanks will win this
year?"
"One can only conjecture."
The girls were still at it, and it looked like a long
siege. Jim furled his brow in thought. Raising his
voice, he said, "It's a funny thing about Jerry hitting
his girl with a hatbox." He looked away.
The girls turned quickly. "Who hit whom with a

hatbox?" Muriel asked. They looked at Jim, but he
continued to look into the distance.
1 picked up the cue. "You can't blame him though.
A guy's got some rights," 1 .said. Turning to the girls,
1 said, "It's nothing, really. Just something that hap
pened to a friend of ours. You wouldn't be interested."
"What happened to her?" the girls asked.
"It's not what happened to her. It's what happened
to him," Jim said, shaking his head and sighing.
"For gosh sakes, just what happened?"
"Oh, it's just that one day Jerry was supposed to
pick up a hat for her and then meet her at the beauty
parlor, but you can never tell what'll happen in Haly,"
1 said.
"Colly, then what, happened?"
"You tell them," I said to Jim.
Jim had had time to think. "It never would have
happened if Jerry had been on time."
"Just like a man to be late," Muriel said.
"But his girl friend had to wait for him, and she
was furious. One of her old boys friends walked by
and they started chatting. She figured this would make
Jerry mad, her talking to someone else."
"Did it?" asked Suzie.
"Naw. He walked up, smiled and held out the box
to her. She started acting as if she didn't even know
him. He took it for so long, and thenâ€”"
"He hit her," Suzie finished. "Are you sure you're
not pulling my leg?"
"Cross my heart and hope to die."
Taking advantage of the lull, I hustled Muriel out
to the dance floor. She looked puzzled and said, "I
don't see why a fella would want to treat a girl like
that?"
"Neither do 1," I said. "Neither do I."
