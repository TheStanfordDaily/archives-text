### JOHN HALL 
The weather's getting hotter and hotter, election
campaigns are getting fiercer and fiercer, Daily edi
torials are getting longer and lunger, shirts are getting
louder and louder, and blouses are getting lower and
lower. But aside from that, things are pretty dull.

However, if anybody looked
hard enough or listened long
»-nough last week they could have
uncovered the following excuses
for column material. It probably
would liave been best to leave the
■stuff burled, but duty is duty, and
that explains a lot of things.
First, there were the two guys
standing in front of History Coi -
ner arguing "whether the sweat
ers brought out the girls, or the
girls brought out the sweaters. 1
< ouldn't help them.

Then, there was the little girl who ran into the Dean
i/l Education's office, looked around quizzically, and
then asked in a dead serious tone "Where is Dean
Borba's office? I've got to see him immediately about
a change of program."
Then, there was the item in old Herb Caen's column
that stopped the show for a few moments, it went like
this: RAISED YIIIBROW DEPARTMENT!! The' Daily
Recorder, San Francisco's very proper and conserva

tive law journal, published recently a front page ar
ticle by Arthur M. Sammis, registrar of Hastings Law
College—all about the 58 disabled veterans now study
ing there.
"These 5b," wrote Sammis in the course of his
learned discussion, "include virtually every rate and
rank from apprentice seaman and Army private to
Navy commander and Army colonel. They even in
clude a former Wave, who injured her back while
getting ready for an Admiral's inspection."
Then, there was the incident in Professor O'Malley's
10 o'clock Louie the 14th class. O'Malley was describ
ing Louie's lack of interest in France's internal prob
lems. "Louie had no grasp of the conditions of how
money got into the treasury, he knew absolutely noth
ing about how to improve such conditions, and he had
no interest in such things. All he cared about was
having a good time with the funds after they were
collected," said O'Malley in almost those same words.
"Just like Truman," came a voice from the back of
the room, which isn't too funny but. fills up space.
Then, there's the good old Stanford Daily Spoils
Page, the only sheet in America today which lists
batting averages in alphabetical order.
And if those aren't enough Fables of the Farm
quickies to hold you for awhile, toss this aside like
I'm doing and hurry down to Dinah's.
I'll tell you some really good ones.
