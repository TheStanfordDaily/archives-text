To the Editor:
J am writing this letter both as an American ar.d as a
Stanford student. As an American, I am proud of my
country and I am willing to state the fact, anytime, any
place, anywhere, that I am a loyal citizen and not a
member of any subversive group. As a Stanford stu
dent, 1 am ashamed to see The Daily and a minority
ol the faculty supporting the minority group at the
University ol California who are opposing the loyalty
oath.
The main is&ue ol the loyalty oath which is "Are you
or are you not a Communist?" is being obscured by a
•■.moke screen which called "violation of academic free
dom, There is no violation of academic freedom. No
one is telling any professor how or what to teach. All
any professor or employee is required to do is to .say
that he is not a Communist or that he lias no com-

11(1 Loyalty Oath

mittments to any Communistic organization. This is a
reasonable request, because I am sure that all will
agree that a Communist is not a fit teacher for Ameri
can youth.
A person is either a loyal citizen or he is not a loyal
citizen, and he is either a Communist or he is not a
Communist. There is no middle road!
Every person should stand up now and be proud to
state his position. 11 he is not a loyal American and
does not like our way of life, he is free to go some
where else.
'1 he founding fathers of our country were proud to
declare their loyalty in speech after speech. Why,
therefore, should any California professor - , or any
other citizen for thai matter, be ashamed to do like
wise?
