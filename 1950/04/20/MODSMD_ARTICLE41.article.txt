# Thirsty Scots Make Comical Screen Plot
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
A terrible catastrophe — worse
than food scarcity or buzz bombs—
cast its shadow over the little island
of Toddy during the recent war. For
the men of Toddy were whiskey
drinkers and the war cut the is
land's ration to four bottles a week.
J. Arthur Rank's "Tight Little Is
land," now playing at the Guild, is
the story of the islanders, dour and
disgruntled because of the lack of
their 100 proof lubricant, during a
joyous few weeks after an Ameri
can ship with a liquid load goes
aground in the harbor.
Row to Drink
The men of Toddy row out in the
night to relieve the ship of its crated
burden. A pompous colonel of the
Home Guard attempts to cut off

their simple
pleasure and re
turn the whis
key. He is, of
course, foiled by
the canny Scots
who hide their
whiskey in ev
erything from
hot water bot-

ties to cold water tups.

"Tight Little Island" is well-pho
tographed and well - written. The
photography seems to suggest the
dour and humorously Puritan na
ture of the islanders, who stand
longingly on the shore for 23 hours
because it is Sunday and they can
not break the Sabbath by removing
whiskey from the sinking ship.
Chief Character
The conscientious colonel, nicely
acted by Basil Radford, is almost too
sympathetic a character. I felt a
perverse desire to see the colonel
catch the islanders. The other name
player, Joan Greenwood as Peggy,
is only fair. The rest of the cast is
excellent.
At times "Tight Little Island"
gives the impression of being a leg
end and the film is at its best at
these moments. The glassy-voiced
narrator (after the liquid weekend)
heightens this impression. He also
succeeds very well at the end.
As he explains, "soon the whiskey
was all gone and everybody was
unhappy again except for Sergeant
Odd and his Peggy who weren't
whiskey drinkers, and if that isn't a
moral story, what is?
