All off-campus men and women
may sign up for a beach party Sun

Hamann, president of the Off-Cam
pus Women's Club, which is spon
soring the affair, said yesterday.
The sign-up list is posted on the
bulletin board downstairs in the
Women's Clubhouse. Miss Ham
ann urges that all those interested
sign up right away so that it can be
determined how many quarts of re
freshments to plan for. It will be a
date affair.
Off - campus men interested in
singing with an "Off - Campus"
group in the Spring Sing are re
quested by Miss Hamann to report
to the Women's Clubhouse during
the lunch hour Monday.
The meeting will be held to select
an appropriate song and to decide
upon a convenient meeting time.
Tenors are particularly needed.
