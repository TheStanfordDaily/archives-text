Although it's half-past April and definitely not the time <jf year for it,
we vu been ordered to shock your sense of season by clearing up the various
basketball notes which have been crammed into the cluttered corners of
the sports desk.
We can start by disposing of the final statistics of the 1950 Southern Di
vision season, in which a school named Stanford finished in fourth place, a
position named cellar.
But Stanford, ably assisted by George Yardley, got away v/ith a good share
ol the records. Yardley and USC's Bill Sharman were strictly the cage rage
oi the Division, and with the UCLA Bruins thrown in to make it sound
good, there w;|> only one official conference record of any consequence left
unbroken after the regular 1950 season.
As everybody must know by now, Yardley and Sharman put on a two
man blast unprecedented in the history of the Division. George set a
new storing record for a 12-game season with 2.'<7 points, only to have
Sharman come along a few minutes later the same evening, but '100 miles
to the south where the pull of gravity is less, and splinter Yardley's effort
with 2.'! X points. Luisetti's record of 232 was finally retired after 12 years.
Yardley finally established a record all his own when he canned 65 free
throws in 86 tries to outlast Sharman who came down to the wire with 60.
Old Hank was again bested, his standard being 50, also set in 1938.
Then, UCLA came up with the team scoring record by massing 711 points
foi the 12-game route.
Final score: Yardley, Sharman, and UCLA—one new record each.
The other statistics for the Dixie loop stack up as follows: Sharman had
the most field goals with 89, Joe White had the best field percentage at .441,
and Sharman led the free loss percentages with .822.
L'SC had the best team average for success in shots taken with .350,
IJCLA led team free-throw percentages with .-o7l), California com
mitted fewest fouls, UCLA had the best defense, Stanford was the most
fouled, and how much more of this can you take? \
Our Cards (somebody has to claim them) had two men in the top 10
scorers, the other entry being soph Jim Walsh who packed in 116 points for
the number-8 spot, just ahead of Ed Sheldrake (113), and smooth-tempered
Otorge Stanich (101).
A 1 Sawyer of UCLA was third (154), Carl Kraushaar, who must have
picked up a copy of Dale Carnegie between visits to the Farm, was fourth
(127), along with Bear Bob Walker, who had the same output. Then comes
bill Hagler (126), Bob Matheney (123), and Walsh. Sheldrake, and Stanich.
After that, things began to fall off, and so will we. So much for statistics.
One of the better basketball breaks ever to happen around these
parts was the invite given to George Yardley and Gus Chavalas by Frank
Walsh to play with an all-star troop this summer in South America.
The news has been in the secret stage since last February, but Walsh just
concluded the final arrangements and released the story last week.
It's going to be a neat little trip, artd it will probably make Yardley one
of the most widely-traveled players in the game. In three years of varsity
ball, George had seen little more than a round-trip ticket to Los Angeles.
Then suddenly, with the end of this season, George winged into Denver with
the Stewarts for the National AAU finals, then hopped to Madison Square
in New York to play with the College All-Stars. Now he's slated for rides
I*; Colombia. Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.
It turns out that this game of basketball can be enjoyable.

Old Hank was again bested, his standard being 50, also set in 1938.
Then, UCLA came up with the team scoring record by massing 711 points
foi the 12-game route.
Final score: Yardley, Sharman, and UCLA—one new record each.
The other statistics for the Dixie loop stack up as follows: Sharman had
the most field goals with 89, Joe White had the best field percentage at .441,
and Sharman led the free loss percentages with .822.
L'SC had the best team average for success in shots taken with .350,
IJCLA led team free-throw percentages with .-o7l), California com
mitted fewest fouls, UCLA had the best defense, Stanford was the most
fouled, and how much more of this can you take? \
Our Cards (somebody has to claim them) had two men in the top 10
scorers, the other entry being soph Jim Walsh who packed in 116 points for
the number-8 spot, just ahead of Ed Sheldrake (113), and smooth-tempered
Otorge Stanich (101).
A 1 Sawyer of UCLA was third (154), Carl Kraushaar, who must have
picked up a copy of Dale Carnegie between visits to the Farm, was fourth
(127), along with Bear Bob Walker, who had the same output. Then comes
bill Hagler (126), Bob Matheney (123), and Walsh. Sheldrake, and Stanich.
After that, things began to fall off, and so will we. So much for statistics.
One of the better basketball breaks ever to happen around these
parts was the invite given to George Yardley and Gus Chavalas by Frank
Walsh to play with an all-star troop this summer in South America.
The news has been in the secret stage since last February, but Walsh just
concluded the final arrangements and released the story last week.
It's going to be a neat little trip, artd it will probably make Yardley one
of the most widely-traveled players in the game. In three years of varsity
ball, George had seen little more than a round-trip ticket to Los Angeles.
Then suddenly, with the end of this season, George winged into Denver with
the Stewarts for the National AAU finals, then hopped to Madison Square
in New York to play with the College All-Stars. Now he's slated for rides
I*; Colombia. Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.
It turns out that this game of basketball can be enjoyable.
Although it's half-past April and definitely not the time <jf year for it,
we vu been ordered to shock your sense of season by clearing up the various
basketball notes which have been crammed into the cluttered corners of
the sports desk.
We can start by disposing of the final statistics of the 1950 Southern Di
vision season, in which a school named Stanford finished in fourth place, a
position named cellar.
But Stanford, ably assisted by George Yardley, got away v/ith a good share
ol the records. Yardley and USC's Bill Sharman were strictly the cage rage
oi the Division, and with the UCLA Bruins thrown in to make it sound
good, there w;|> only one official conference record of any consequence left
unbroken after the regular 1950 season.
As everybody must know by now, Yardley and Sharman put on a two
man blast unprecedented in the history of the Division. George set a
new storing record for a 12-game season with 2.'<7 points, only to have
Sharman come along a few minutes later the same evening, but '100 miles
to the south where the pull of gravity is less, and splinter Yardley's effort
with 2.'! X points. Luisetti's record of 232 was finally retired after 12 years.
Yardley finally established a record all his own when he canned 65 free
throws in 86 tries to outlast Sharman who came down to the wire with 60.
