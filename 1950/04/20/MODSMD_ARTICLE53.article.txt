# Frosh Baseball Team Dumps Mission High School 20 to 8
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's frosl. baseballers were I
hotter than Old Sol himself yester
day as they garnered a sun-toasted
20 to 8 decision over Mission High i
on the frosh diamond.
Dick Cole, Jim Agar, and George
Zaninovich spearheaded the Pa
poose attack which chalked up two
runs in the first inning, four in the
second, five in the third, seven in
the fourth, and two in the fifth in
ning.
Stanford's Ron Boyer was com- |
plete master of the situation until j
the sixth and final inning. In that j
frame, Mission took advantage of !
Boyer's wildness and tallied five j
times. Bob Murphy was ushered in
from the wings to put out the fire, i
After the first inning, there was
little doubt as to the outcome. Mis- !
sion drew first blood by nursing two !
hits into a run. The Cardbabes, !
however, came right back with two J
scores in their half of the first, as j
Cole singled in Frank Yapp and
Cole tallied on Zaninovich's infield
out. Stanford bloated the score to
7 to 1 in the second as Jim Agar's •
well-placed triple brought in Yapp.
Doug Shumway, and Cole, Boyer \
having already scored on Shum
way's one-baser.
Stanford's most explosive out
burst came in the fourth when sev- ;
en runs found their way to the i
plate: Yapp provoked a walk from
hurler Bob Coburn, Shumway sin- |
gled, and both completed the cycle J
behind Cole's double, which rocked j
the center field boards. Agar chased '
in Cole with a single and Zanino- :
vich and Gene Shirley walked. With I
the bases loaded, Boyer helped to !
win his own ball game as his timely
hit brought in all three.
Mission, which is leading San
Franisco's Academic Athletic Asso
iation with six wins and no losses, j
showed nothing in the way of pitch- |
int* strength as the Bears' battalion
of hurlers allowed 15 walks, 11 hits,
and hit three with pitched balls, j '
The frosh go to the post again I
Saturday morning when they lock
horns with San Mateo High, cham- 1
pion of the Peninsula Athletic !
Ileague last year. Bob Murphy will :
pitch against bis former teammates. 1

from the wings to put out the fire, i
After the first inning, there was
little doubt as to the outcome. Mis- !
sion drew first blood by nursing two !
hits into a run. The Cardbabes, !
however, came right back with two J
scores in their half of the first, as j
Cole singled in Frank Yapp and
Cole tallied on Zaninovich's infield
out. Stanford bloated the score to
7 to 1 in the second as Jim Agar's •
well-placed triple brought in Yapp.
Doug Shumway, and Cole, Boyer \
having already scored on Shum
way's one-baser.
Stanford's most explosive out
burst came in the fourth when sev- ;
en runs found their way to the i
plate: Yapp provoked a walk from
hurler Bob Coburn, Shumway sin- |
gled, and both completed the cycle J
behind Cole's double, which rocked j
the center field boards. Agar chased '
in Cole with a single and Zanino- :
vich and Gene Shirley walked. With I
the bases loaded, Boyer helped to !
win his own ball game as his timely
hit brought in all three.
Mission, which is leading San
Franisco's Academic Athletic Asso
iation with six wins and no losses, j
showed nothing in the way of pitch- |
int* strength as the Bears' battalion
of hurlers allowed 15 walks, 11 hits,
and hit three with pitched balls, j '
The frosh go to the post again I
Saturday morning when they lock
horns with San Mateo High, cham- 1
pion of the Peninsula Athletic !
Ileague last year. Bob Murphy will :
