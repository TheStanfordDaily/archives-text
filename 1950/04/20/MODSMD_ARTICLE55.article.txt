Games this weekâ€”Friday, USC
at Santa Clara; Saturday, USC at
Stanford, California at St. Mary's.
Southern California's defending
CIBA champions, the team with the
potent batting average and the low
won-lost percentage, will hook up
with Everett Dean's Stanford In
dians this Saturday on the Sunken
Diamond in an all-important league
contest that will have considerable
bearing on the conference pennant
chase.
The Trojans, making their first
trip of the year north of the Los
Angeles city limits, must defeat
both Santa Clara tomorrow and
Stanford Saturday to get back into
the thick of the race.
The Trojans dropped their first
two contests of the season to Santa
Clara, came back with a 4 to 3 vic
tory over thir cross - town rival
UCLA, and now appear ready to go
on to bigger and better things. It
will be remembered that last year
the Trojans dropped two to Santa
Clara, and then went on to win 12
straight and cop their second con
secutive flag.
Despite their two losses to Santa
Clara, the Troymen have, in their
first three games, walloped tlie ball
at a terrific .352 clip. This is ap
proximately 100 points higher than
the team batting average of second
place St. Mary's. Stanford stands
i'ourth in this respect with a paltry
.238.
Other statisticse released by the
conference statisician yesterday
show that Dave Melton is sixth in
the individual batting race with a
mark of . 3(!0, that Joe Chez is the
league's leading pitcher with three
victories and no defeats and an
earned - run average of 1.85, and
that Bud Klein leads the league in
home runs with two.
Bob Lillis, USC shortstop, leads
in Ihe batting department with nine
hits in 14 trips for an average of
. 643.
