# Indian Netters Bow To College of Pacific
## 
### 
College of Pacific's powerful ten
nis squad carried too much punch
for Stanford's aspiring netters yes
i terday afternoon as they downed
the Indians 7 to 2.
The score, however, is not exact
ly a true indication of the closeness
i of the matches, lop Tiger, Hank
Pfister, winner of this year's North -
j ern California Intercollegiate, was
given all the tennis he could handle
i by Stanford's number one man,
! Kirke Mechem.
Pfister was pressed to take the
first set 7-5. Mechem came back to
take the second set (i-2. However,
Pfister outlasted Mechem 10-8 in
j the final set.
Indian Lucien Barbour took his
j first set from Darrell Winrich in the
! number two singles match 6-3, but
Winrich was able to come back and
| take the last two sets 6-3 and 6-4.
Ernie Dußray and George Gentry
! also took the first sets of their
; matches, but iheir Tiger opponents
edged them both out in the last sets
of their matches.
The only bright light in the sin
| gles matches for Stanford was Tom
: Lewyn, who continued his winning
ways by defeating Don Jacobus 6-2
and 6-2. Lewyn has yet to taste de
feat in intercollegiate competition,
j Vince Schmieder dropped the
! final singles match 6-3 and 6-2 to
sew the match up for the Tigers at
5 to 1 going into the doubles.
Pfister and Hamilton teamed up
to defeat Mechem and Barbour in
the number one doubles 6-2, 5-7,
I 6-2.
Lewyn and teammate Dußray
I chalked up the other Stanford win

of the afternoon by handing Ar
buckle and Jacobus a 6-2, 6-2 de
feat in the second doubles match.
By the time Gentry and Schmieder
had dropped the final doubles
match 14-21 and 6-2 to COP's Win
rich and Bob Hall, it was 6:45.
It was just a case of too much ex
perience for Indian mentor Elwyn
Bugge's men to handle. The Tigers
used smart court strategy and good
ball control throughout the after
noon to keep the Card netters in
the hole.


TOM LEWYN
—Remains undefeated
