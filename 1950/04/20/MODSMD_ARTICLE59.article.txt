# Alpha Delts Edge By Theta Xi; Biz School Wins 7 to 6 Game
## 
### 
Aided by the time limit rule
which stops all 4 o'clock games ex-
actly al 5 regardless of their status, ]
Alpha Delts yesterday rallied for a I
10 to 8 win over Theta Xi to fea- !
ture the earlv afternoon mural soft- }
ball games. Behind 8 to 5, the Al- j
phas put together three errors, four
walks, and a lone single for five
runs in the top half of the last in
ning to sew up the ball game. Be- j
cause of the time deadline, Theta '
Xi did not have a change for a pos- ;
sib!e rally to give them the victory.
In another headline game, Bud
Sone drove home the tying and
winning runs with a line single in i
the last half of the last inning to j
rescue a 7 to 6 triumph for Biz j

School I over Village 117. The Vil
lage boys scored first, batting
around- in the second inning for
their six runs, and were valiantly
hanging on when the roof fell in.
Biz School fought bat k for five
runs in their half of the second.
Then, after two were out in the last
inning, Rex Johnson walked, Steve
Chang walked, and Stone, having
struck out his first two times up,
brought home the bacon.
