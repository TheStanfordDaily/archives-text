## 
### 
Last March 18, a group of closc ;
relatives of former Stanford Law j
School students who gave their
lives in the war gathered to dedi
cate a plaque in the new Law
School quarters.
The plaque was hung at the en
trance of the new Law School build
ing in accordance with the terms of j
the Stanford Law Veterans Memo
rial Scholarship. This scholarship
was established December 29, 1944,
by the members of the Law School
faculty in memory of the 18 men
whose names are on the plaque.
The dedication of the plaque
reads: "In memory of those former
students in the Stanford Law
School who gave their lives in the
service of their country in the
armed forces during World War II."
Donald L. Mason, assistant pro
fessor of Mechanical Engineering,
was responsible for the casting of
the plaque, and also the art work.
The dedication was informal with
no speeches or ceremony. The rela- j
tives were guests of the Stanford
Law School for luncheon, and they
inspected the new Law School j
quarters.
Acting as hosts for the dedication
luncheon were former Dean and
Mrs. Marion Kirkwood, Professor
and Mrs. Lowell Turrentine, and
Mrs. Carl B. Spaeth.
