# Chappie Plans Joke 'Swaps'
## 
### 
So you think the jokes that the
Chappie purloins from other maga
zines are the best thing in the ragâ€”
Then the Stanford Chaparral for
April is just the thing for you.
From cover to cover, the magazine
J is composed of material stolen from
i other campus humor publications.
This is known, kiddies, as an ex-
I change issue, and it has stories from
Ya'e, Missouri, Michigan, and Cal,
Fables from Other Farms, and car
loons and jokes from just about
everywhere.
II descends on the campus Wed
j nesday, and it still costs 30 cents.
Don't let it get away.
