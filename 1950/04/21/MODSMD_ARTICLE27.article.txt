# The 						'Why' of That By-Law
## 
### 
A new ASSU by-law, to be incorporated into
The Daily section, wati adopted Wednesday
mght by Excom on The Daily s recommenda
tion. The by law states:
"It shall be a violation of the Fundamental
Standard to deface, destroy, tear, or in any way
mark any issues of The Stanford Daily not al
ready received by the individual reader or
subscriber. It shall also be a violation to insert
any foreign material unauthorized by the edi
tor or business manager in The Daily before it
has reached the reader. Violators of this pro
vision will be referred to the appropriate stu
dent council for punishment."
The reasons for such a provision are, we be
lieve, fairly obvious. The intent is to protect
our advertisers, by insuring that their paid ad
vertisements are not lessened in effectiveness
by free ads inserted after the papers have been
printed and distributed.
The intent is also toi protect our readers
against material which we have not authorized
ofter examining it for accuracy, good taste, and
news worth.
We also seek to protect The Daily and its

owners, the ASSU, against any loss of prestige
and reader-confidence which might result
from the appearance of such unauthorized ma
terial in any connection with The Daily.
This by-law will not go into effect until after
the present ASSU election.
However, we feel it is only reasonable to ask
all candidates to abide by this policy during
the remainder of their campaigns.
Eguality in ASSU election campaigns very
wisely has been deemed proper. Election by
laws provide for this eguality in nearly all re
spects.
We do not believe it is fair for one candidate,
who has paid for an advertisement in The
Daily, to find that other candidates, at no ex
pense other than a rubber-stamp, have used
The Daily to broadcast campaign publicity.
In our news columns we will continue to
give egual publicity to all candidates for each
ASSU post. We hope these same candidates
will see the point of our reguest, and use their
rubber-stamps elsewhere.
It's all in the interests of equality.
