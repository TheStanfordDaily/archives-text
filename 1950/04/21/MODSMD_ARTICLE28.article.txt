## On U.C. Loyalty Oath 
### 
To the Editor:
Alter Mr. Griscom stops waving the American flag
and bandying about accusations of Communism, per
haps he will pause long enough to consider what is in
volved in the University of California Loyalty Oa'h
controversy.
In the first place, why should the professors of any
institution be singled out for personal attack any more
than the members of the bar, or the medical profes
sion? It would seem that professors, who are con
siderably above the average in intelligence, and who
are trained in scholarly detachment, can view Com
munism with more objectivity and with greater
knowledge than the average citizen. Certainly they,
if anyone, will recognize the underlying contradictions
of Marxian dogma and be the vanguard in the opposi
tion to Communism.
Secondly, Communists don't wear badges proclaim
ing themselves as such. It is most difficult for a pro
lessor to disprove that he has Communism affiliations.
And before long students will be accusing professors
of being Communists, and colleagues will be accusing
colleagues. Personal bitterness and professional bias
will transform this issue into a witchhunt.
Thirdly, the only way to light Communism is to
learn more about it. However, if professors are afraid
to discuss Marxism, if textbooks mentioning Commu
nism are banned, if articles analyzing Soviet life and
customs remain unwritten, knowledge of this vital
subject will be hidden behind a veil of ignorance and
fear. Far more people will be attracted to its forbidden
fruits than were ever induced to join the party line
by honest, open discussion of the question. Democracy
in the university is bred ki light the light of academic
