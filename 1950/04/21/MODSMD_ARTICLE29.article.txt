Just what is all this funs about the Loyalty Oath at
the University of California? Who is for il and who is
jgainst it, and why?
I see no reason why teachers in an institution

i equired to sign the loyalty oath if the consensus ol
the public demands thai oath. But evidently the public
does not demand the oath. Governor Warren, who is
the elected spokesman for the people of Calilornia, i.s
against the oath. Unless the people of California pe
tition for the oath or send a man to the Stale Capitol
who is for the oath, 1 can see no reason why the teach
ers at the university should be required to i,ign the
oath.

that one of the prime reasons that Stanford teachers

wish to remain at Stanford is because we truly have
academic freedom. Being a private school, we are out
side the fcrasp of politicians and the mass hysteria ol
public opinion.
1 would further venture to say that Stanford teachers
will never be asked to sign a loyalty oath because we
at Stanford all know that we don't have to make ex
cuses for our system of government, nor do we have
to suppress foreign ideas because we have a darn good
answer for every one of their lies. We don't have to be
afraid of freedom of expression at Stanford, the Uni

our duty 1o inform (he Regents of the University of
California and the people ol California about our
