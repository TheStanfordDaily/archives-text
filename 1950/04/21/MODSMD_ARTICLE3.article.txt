## 
### 
WASHING T ONâ€” The House
Ways and Means Committee today
brushed aside President Truman's
tax rcomcmcndations and, in its
first action on the new tax bill, vot
ed a $75,000,000 slash in manufac
turers' excise imposts.
This action, if it becomes law,
would repeal completely the taxes
on several manufactured items, in
cluding the 10 per cent levy on
household cookstovcs, water heaters
and electric irons, and the 20 per
cent impost on light bulbs.
Secretary of the Treasury Sny
der, filling in the details of Mr.
Truman's tax program, specifically
recommended against any reduction
in manufacturers' excises "in view
of our budgetary situatino." But
the committee refused to heed the
request.
