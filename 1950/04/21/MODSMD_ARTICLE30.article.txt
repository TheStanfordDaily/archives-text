To the Editor:
Having read Mr. Griscom's letter in Thursday's
Daily, I feel compelled to submit a rebuttal.
Mr. Griscom has not descended to the level of name
calling, but he is guilty of employing, intentionally or
inadvertently, several other obvious propaganda de
vices, and he has made .several loose statements.
Mr. Griscom writes as an "American and as a Stan
foid student" (get on the band-wagon), and reiterates
that he is a "loyal citizen and not a member of any
subversive group" (Hag-waving).
He states that "every person should stand up now
and be proud to state his position," and implies that
anyone who objects to the type ol loyalty oath re
quired by the UC Board of Regents is not "a loyal
American" and that any such persons are "ashamed
. . . to declare their loyalty in speech after speech."
I believe that these last implications are unwar
ranted. Mr. Griscom evidently sees only black and
white. For him there are no grays between.
Mr. Griscom's letter indicates that he feels the pro
posed loyalty oath is a just one. Certain other persons,
including some professors at the University ol Cali
fornia and other schools, leel it is an insult to their
moral character. Therefore, in Mr. Griscom's sight,
they are black as black can be (or should I say "red )
Mr. Griscom states that he is ashamed to see "a
minority of the faculty (at Stanford) supporting the
minority group at the University ol Calilornia who are
opposing the loyalty oath."
1 challenge Mr. Griscom to prove that these groups
are minorities.
Although 1 have not presented any arguments in
this letter to demonstrate why the loyalty oath should
not be required, it is probably (|uite clear what my
own opinion is in this matter.
