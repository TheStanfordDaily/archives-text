# Cards, Troy Trade Swats In Sunken Diamond Tilt
## Chez After Fourth Loop Win, Must Halt Potent Barrymen 
### JOHN HALL 
Stanford's pennant-sniffing Card horsehiders will attempt to
climb into first place in the current CIBA chase tomorrow after
noon when they open up the home hit pit to USC's defending
champions.
Joe Chez, the 3 and 0 sophomore, will toss in the first pitch at

promptly 2:30 p.m.. Sunken Dia
mond standard time.
It'll be USC's first Farm appear
ance of the season, and the largest
home crowd to date is expected to
sally forth to see what Sam Barry's
boys have to offer.
Poor Start
Having been caught with their
hustle at half-mast in the season
openers against Santa Clara, the
Trojans were shoved unkindly into
the loop cellar with two straight
failures, but since then have been
acting like USC baseball teams are
supposed to act.
They clubbed UCLA into the
depths and then rubbed out the
Santa Barbara Dodgers to boost
their team batting average to a siz
zling .352, just 100 points higher
than league-leading St. Mary's the
second hittingest club in the loop.
Troy's comeback will be divided
into a two-step program. First, they
have to stop in Santa Clara this
afternoon to rebattle the Broncos,
and then tomorrow they'll be here
to hash it out with the Cards.
Stanford will be gunning for win
number 5 and maybe a first place
in the race, depending on what hap-

pens to California and St. Mary's,
who will also be having at it to
morrow afternoon at Moraga.
It's the first time since Stanford j
won the CIBA crown back in lflill
that the Cards have been this close
to a league lead after the opening
game. Everett Dean's men have
punchd out wins over Santa Clara,
Cal, and UCLA, but have yet to face
the powerful Trojans or the sur
prisingly strong St. Mary's Gaels.
Boasting the league's two leading
bashers in sophomore shortstop Bob
Lillis and left-fielder Jay Roundy,
Sam Barry again owns one of the
most dangerous hitting clubs in the
country. Lillis, a first-year replace
ment for Ail-American Jim Bride
vveser. has rapped out nine hits in
14 trips for .043. and Roundy has
collected five for 10, mostly extra
bases, for an even .500.
Schlarb fur Troy
USC's hit parade also includes
veteran blasters Bob Zuber, Serge
Freeman, and Rudolph Valentino
Regalado. Barry will probably save
his ace chueker, Jack '"Sloppy"
Schlarb, for the Indians. Schlarb, a i
4-1 performer last year, looked like ;
the hottest twirler on the coast dur
ing pre-season tilts when he threw !
a four-Hitter against the San Diogo j
Padres, a feat which most triple-A
pros have been finding it difficult to j
duplicate.
