## Indians Face Bruin Team 
### 
With only one loss to niar their
terrific season and that defeat at
the hands of powerful College of
the Pacific, Stanford's tennis team
will tear into their second confer
ence foe, UCLA. The Cards meet
the high-ranking Bruins at 1:30 j
p.m. tomorrow on the local courts, j
Both teams have defeated their!
only common opponent — the Cal
Bears. UCLA, without the aid of j
their nationally ranked star Herb !
Flam, scored a tight 5-4 win. The j
Cards crumbled the Bears easily by j
a 7-2 count.
Besides Herbie Flam, who just!
finished extending Ted Schroeder
in a five-set semi-final match of a j
Texas tourney, the Westwood trav
eling squad includes Gene Garrett, j
Glenn Bassett, Jack Shoemaker, Ed ,
Kauder, Jim Jenkins, Keith Self, j
and Kelley Starr.
Coach Elwyn Bugge will send his j
regular six - man squad after the |
favored Bruins. Kirke Meehem will I
get his second rugged assignment of I
the week when he ties into Flam in j
the top singles match. Lucien Bar
hour, Ernie Dußray, George Gen
try, Tom Lewyn, and Vinnie j
Sehmieder round out the starters.
The only break for the Indians is I
that the Bruins tangle with the i
Bears this afternoon. A few tough J
matches could weaken the West- j
wood netters enough to make a big j
difference.
