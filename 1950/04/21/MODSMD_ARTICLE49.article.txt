clean, Stanford's i'rosh track team
will have to get by San Francisco
City College and San Mateo JC to
morrow morning when they play ]
host in a triangular meet staged in

Mateo's John Simmons has run the
100-yard distance in 9.7 seconds. No
Stanford man has been able to crack j
the 10-second mark this year. In

travels the furlong in 21 flat and
broad jumps 24 feet 4'-j inches.
San Mateo has a high jumper who
could possibly beat out Norm Jiles.

2 inches consistently this yenr, j
while Jiles' best mark is G feet 3 :, h
inches.

Stanford's Bob Mathias is sched
uled to compete in the high jump,
high hurdles, and probably one oth
er event. Tuesday, against Menlo
and Modesto, Mathias worked out
in two events and took only one
turn at the discus with his sweat
suit on and placed a respectable
second.
A shake-up in the frosh distance
division is due tomorrow. Accord
ing to Coach Dean, Bob Simon, who
has been running the mile, will try

the 880. and George Griffin, two
miler, will run the mile. They will
abandon the two-mile affair for the
day.
