# Bacon Grant To Engineers Runs 2nd Year
## 
### 
A fund of $000 has been given to |
the Stanford School of Engineering j
by Edward R. Bacon of San Fran
cisco to aid needy students. A stu- ;
dent-faculty committee under the j
chairmanship of Professor Volney
C. Finch has been set up to handle
the details of the grant.
Mr. Bacon made a similar gift last
year which, in the words of Pro
fessor Finch, "did a tremendous
amount of good. In the majority of
cases the students could not other
wise have stayed in school."
Application blanks may be ob
tained at Dean Terman's office.
They should be filed with Mrs.
Olivia B. Byler, Scholarship Com
mittee secretary, in Temporary
Building A-l not later than May 1. 1
Any students at present enrolled in i
the School of Engineering, who are
not financially able to continue
their studies, are eligible to apply
for a portion of the grant.
The members of the student-fac
ulty committee under Professor
Finch are Professor O. G. Villard,
John Marchand, Professor John K.
Vennard, C. G. Perdu, Don J. Stod
dard, and Mrs. Byler.
