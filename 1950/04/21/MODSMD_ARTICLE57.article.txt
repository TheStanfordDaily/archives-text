CHINESE COMMUNISTS and Nationalists yesterday both
claimed important advances in the battle for Hainan Island.
The Reds report they have captured Fushan, a town 10 miles
inland. Red beachheads (1) are steadily being wiped out, Na
tionalists announced at the same time. The Communists have
presumably invaded tiny Lintin Island (2), close to Nationalist
bases located in the same area, used for blockading the ap
proach to Communist-occupied Canton. Although the reports
did not cover operations of the past three days, the mere fact
that the Reds announced the campaign indicates they were
highly optimistic of victory. â€”AP Wirephoto
