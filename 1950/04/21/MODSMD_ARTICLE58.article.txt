# 'To Be or Not To Be' Plays Tug With Nazi Secret Police
## 
### AL BERRY 
''To Be or Not to Be" and '"Flesh
and Fantasy" are currently being
double billed at the Park Theater
to make one of the best flicture par
lays that the LSJU area has seen in
a handful of summers.
Both pictures are "oldies but j
greaties." Must-see jobs.
"To Be Or Not To Be" is the bet- |

ter of the two pic- J
tures and stars!
Jack Benny in ;
the only good \
flick he ever
made, and the i
late wonderful
Carole Lombard.
Somebody o nee
said that there!
will be <?n j
actress to replace

Carole Lombard. "To Be" shows j
why that statement still holds. She |
is—pardon the repetitious adjective j
—wonderful.

The story takes place in War
saw, just after the Nazi legions
pulled oft their easy occupation in
1939. Benny and Miss Lombard
play a man and wife who are Po
land's leading stage attractions.
Come the occupation they of course
make with the underground and in
various disguises (Benny plays a
Gestapo chief and later a spy) they
raise much havoc with the Third
Reich.
Subtle Humor
No mere rundown of the plot,
however, can do this picture justice.
Its humor, the subtleness of many
of the guffaws, and the fine han
dling of the thing by the twot. prin
cipals make ''To Be or Not to Be
one of the finest comedies ever to
come out of Hollywood.
Radio gagster Jack Benny is un
usually good in this because he
discards the simple fop act that so
many comedians today consider to
be humor, and plays the part of a
fairly intelligent human being, who
has a delightful time playing tag
with Mr. Hitler's secret policemen.
Excuse me for drooling but this
laugh-riot is a masterpiece to go
down in history with such fine old

timers as "Nothing Sacred," "The
Great Dictator," and "You Can't
Take It With You."
Flesh and Fantasy
The companion picture, '"Flesh
and Fantasy," is a rather interest
ing picture with a touch of wcird
riess in it that the people of the ]
! golden lots should exploit more
often. It is done something like the
j newer "Quartet" and features a
i somewhat sterling cast.
Robert Cummings plays the part
! of a disillusioned college student.
Betty Field is an ugly girl at Mardi
Gras. Thomas Mitchell is a fortune- j
| teller who is a bit too good at his
j trade.
Edward G. Robinson is a success
ful lawyer who is destined to mur
der. Barbara Stanwyck is a lady '
with a rotten past and a grim fu
ture. And Charles Boyer is a tight
rope walker who dreams of falling
and a woman's scream.

Carole Lombard. "To Be" shows j
why that statement still holds. She |
is—pardon the repetitious adjective j
—wonderful.

The story takes place in War
saw, just after the Nazi legions
pulled oft their easy occupation in
1939. Benny and Miss Lombard
play a man and wife who are Po
land's leading stage attractions.
Come the occupation they of course
make with the underground and in
various disguises (Benny plays a
Gestapo chief and later a spy) they
raise much havoc with the Third
Reich.
Subtle Humor
No mere rundown of the plot,
however, can do this picture justice.
Its humor, the subtleness of many
of the guffaws, and the fine han
dling of the thing by the twot. prin
cipals make ''To Be or Not to Be
one of the finest comedies ever to
come out of Hollywood.
Radio gagster Jack Benny is un
usually good in this because he
discards the simple fop act that so
many comedians today consider to
be humor, and plays the part of a
fairly intelligent human being, who
has a delightful time playing tag
with Mr. Hitler's secret policemen.
Excuse me for drooling but this
laugh-riot is a masterpiece to go
down in history with such fine old

timers as "Nothing Sacred," "The
Great Dictator," and "You Can't
Take It With You."
Flesh and Fantasy
The companion picture, '"Flesh
and Fantasy," is a rather interest
ing picture with a touch of wcird
riess in it that the people of the ]
! golden lots should exploit more
often. It is done something like the
j newer "Quartet" and features a
i somewhat sterling cast.
Robert Cummings plays the part
! of a disillusioned college student.
Betty Field is an ugly girl at Mardi
Gras. Thomas Mitchell is a fortune- j
| teller who is a bit too good at his
j trade.
Edward G. Robinson is a success
ful lawyer who is destined to mur
der. Barbara Stanwyck is a lady '
with a rotten past and a grim fu
ture. And Charles Boyer is a tight
rope walker who dreams of falling
and a woman's scream.

''To Be or Not to Be" and '"Flesh
and Fantasy" are currently being
double billed at the Park Theater
to make one of the best flicture par
lays that the LSJU area has seen in
a handful of summers.
Both pictures are "oldies but j
greaties." Must-see jobs.
"To Be Or Not To Be" is the bet- |

ter of the two pic- J
tures and stars!
Jack Benny in ;
the only good \
flick he ever
