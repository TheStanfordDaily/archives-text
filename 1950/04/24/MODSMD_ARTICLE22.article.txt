## Guerillas Join Reds to Take Hoihow; Nationalists Yield Without Fighting

TAIPEI, Formosa, April 23 (AP) —The Communists evidently
took unepposed possession of the Hainan Island capital of Hoihow
today.
The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said in a dispatch
from Hong Kong that the Chinese Red Fourth Army had entered

Hoihow, Hainan's capital, and had
been "enthusiastically greeted" by
the population.
It added that the Communists had ;
extended their bridgehead on Hainan, |
penetrated 20 miles into the interior,
and were now advancing in three !
directions on the island toward com- j
inunication centers,
Tanjug ;:»id the advancing Red j
armies had linked up with 30,000 Red
guerrillas.
The Poipitig radio, heard here, said
Red invasion troops had taken Meitai
and Tsingmai on the 19th and 21st of
April respectively and that more than
1,000 Nationalists were killed,
wounded, or taken prisoner during
the engagements.
Nationalist fears were unconcealed
that the Reds would win the whole j
13,500-square-mile island in due
course.
(The independent Hong Kong pa- j
per Sing Tao Min Pao said the Reds |
peacefully entered Hoihow at dawn j
and shops already were reopening.) |
Capture of Hoihow gives the Reds I
control of Hainan Strait, which is j
only 10 miles wide at its narrowest
point, They thus are enabled to re
inforce their holdings from the
southern mainland at minimum risk.
An Associated Press correspondent i
who flew out of Hoihow to the Hainan

south coast on the last plane Satur
day afternoon said the Nationalist Air
Force, Army, and civil administrators
had left. Hoihow. At the time he left,
the Reds were only three miles away.
He said the Red invasion force wa >
estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 men, op
posing about 60,000 Nationalist
troops, of whom many had fled by
air
There was no news of fighting on
Hainan today.
The grim tidings, coming on top of
false Nationalist claims of a great
defensive victory Friday, had a pro
foundly depressing effect in Taipei,
capital of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-
Shek's regime.

Tlie Nationalists many times in the
past four years of civil war have put,
out exaggerated reports of victories,
but never before have they put them
selves in quite such a position.
Embarrassed Nationalist officials
conferred for hours before admitting

that a proclaimed "victory" was ac
tually a defeat.
There are three current theories for
the original false report:
1. The Nationalists simply counted
i their chickens before they were
hatched;
2. The Reds hoisted white flags as a
ruse for which the Nationalists fell;
and
3. The Hainan command deliber
ately put out the false news to pre
vent panic and enable leaders to flee.
The correspondent's dispatch from
Samah on the south coast said there
were reports in Nationalist circles
that the Reds actually were encircled
| and pretended to surrender Friday
morning, then were joined Friday
1 night by 2,500 local guerrillas and
| broke loose for their fast 25-rnil?.
