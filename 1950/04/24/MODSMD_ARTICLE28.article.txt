# Oil for the Machinery
## 
### 
The end of April has brought with it another
Frosh edition of The Daily, and the Frosh Edi
tion involves another freshman editor, trying
to organize the impressions and gripes of two
and a half quarters at Stanford into one concise
and compelling editorial.
We have no crusades to launch, no axes to
grind. We don't pretend that we have been
here long enough to make intelligent sugges
tions for improvements in the University or
changes in its regulations. Ideas such as these
have been brought forward before, with far
more authority than we can assume. But we
do think that we are qualified to talk about stu
dent attitudes. We haven't learned enough
about the machinery of Stanford to know how
the gears should be re arranged, but we do
have some ideas as to what kind of oil should
be used. Furthermore, we are all in favor of
oil.
President Sterling, in his talk to the pre-elec
tion rally Tuesday night, said that integrity, in
formation, judgment, and participation are the
four qualities necessary to make student gov
ernment, or any democratic government, work.
Participation is the last of the four, but is the
one without which the other three are useless.
Voting is important; that goes without saying.
Yet sixty per cent of the student body didn't

think so last week, to judge by the returns in
Wednesday's primaries. The fifty-nine per
cent turnout that set a Stanford record in the
spring elections of 1948 was good, just as this
year's forty per cent primary vote was good -
but they're not good enough.
Participation also includes office-holding.
Only one or two or three candidates ran this
year for some of the Excom and AWS positions
that, too, is not good enough.
Many people gripe about the preferential
system. That system is a compromise, and we
think a wise one. Three primaries .would per
form the same function, but at great incon
venience. The preferential system, if used
wisely, selects the candidate who is most ac
ceptable to tho greatest number of voting stu
dents. Voters who give second-place votes to
the candidate they believe has the least chance
of winning, instead of their real second choice,
defeat the whole purpose of the system, and do
nothing to help their own first-choice candi
date, since their second-choice votes will never
be counted unless their first choice is defi
nitely eliminated anyway.
Indifference and lack of judgment in student
government are as old as student government;
but as long as they exist there is room for pro
tests against them.
