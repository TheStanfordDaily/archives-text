# Advance Notices for '53
## 
### 
The class of '53, after settling down to the
routine of Stanford life with a minimum of fric
tion, has recently erupted with new ideas and
timely revivals of old ones notably,
1. The announcement of an exchange with
the freshmen of Cal to be held tentatively on
May 13. With the conclusion of negotiations by
Dick Weismann, Stanford fresh president, and
Bill Owen, California frosh president, the class
of '53 has taken a step toward strengthening the
friendly rivalry between the two schools.
This exchange was initiated by the class of
'41 back in 1938, but since that time, the tradi
tion they tried to establish has been neglected.
However, as the benefits of such an exchange
u;e obvious, we hope that the tradition is con
tinued from now on. The function will go far in
increasing class spirit and bettering the Stan

ford Cal feud by letting each school know more
about the other.
2. The announcement of a class of '53 meet
ing in Memorial Auditorium on May 10, high
lighted by an original script and lyrics. Class
meetings are always good for the class that
participates, for they promote class unity and
provide another opportunity for members to
get to know each other.
3. The completion of the class constitution,
needing only the sanction of Excom. The pur
pose of the constitution is to promote interest
in class affairs and to provide a means to utilize
the class funds.
These three projects, we believe, make a
creditable record for any class during its fresh
man year. We hope that the class of '53 can
live up to these advance notices for the coming
three years.â€”W.M.
