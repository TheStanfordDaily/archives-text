### LARRY CAHN 
Spring quarter brings not only sun tans, Hawaiian
•hii ts, and peasant blouses to the Farm, but also the
game that Casey made famous- baseball.
Here's what happened to me the other day when 112
took iny giil to a game and we arrived in the fifth in
ning. First thing oft the bat was the question, "What's
the score, Larry?"2 112 answered, "Nothing to nothing."
She smiled and said, "Good, we haven't missed a
tiling."
Just so you guys will know all the answers and just
so you gals might not ask the questions, let's take a
look at a game.
1 climbed aboard my butterfly,.circled twice over
Hoover's glistening white tower, and glided Lo a slop
on a barren, dusty field. 1 was quickly surrounded by
men in bunny suits or sweat suits as they are com
monly called, and 1 realized 1 had mistakenly set my
msect down on the Frosh Field and not Sunken Dia
mond, or the Gem of the Ocean, but as it was cold and
I had forgotten my swimming trunks, I decided to for
get the varsity.
Seems the Frosh weie playing a game, so J secured
my butterfly and crawled into th»- dugout to make my
observations..
The first inning was scoreless and two goose eggs
went up on the scoreboard. 1 looked around but
couldn't see the wild goose; I made a mental note to
ask Dr. DuShane about that.
Upon hearing me talking t.u myself, the player next
to me explained that a goose egg was the same as a
whitewash. When I still looked puzzled, he added,
You know, a shutout."
The frames went by. Those were the tilings they
were hanging the goose eggs in. Someone called them
innings, but I think fie was wrong. Finally a player

I
got a scratch hit, but I didn't see any blood, and I didn't
underlined it until one of the guys mentioned a Texas
leaguer. You know how rugged the guys from the
Lone Star State are.
On the next pitch the runner on first starts running,
I think toward second. The coach starts yelling, "He's
stealing," and I saw a guy in blue running toward
second too, so 1 thought everything would be all right.
But the man in blue spread his palms and the fans,
they are the paying customers blowing off wind,
started yelling "jobber" and "kill the umpire," but he
was still sale. O'n the next pitch the runner went to
third, and the guy next to me said something about tin
hot corner and how the player would have to hug
the bag. Didn't .seem very sexy to me.
I guess Seals aren't the only animals connected with
bail, cause then the pitcher came out with a charlie
horse arid another went in from the bull-pen. Did the
bench jockeys ever ride him. You know what a bench
jockey is. That's a guy that's riding the bench and
trying to make monkeys out of everybody else. Once
Ihe catcher threw off his mask, Halloween was over;
and he chased a fowl, that wasn't too bad, but
when an outfielder got on his 19 horses and raced back
to the ft nee to catch a Hv. then [ began to worry about
my butterfly.
I was really confused when the captain was on deck
and the first baseman in the hole. But upon inquiry I
iound it was just batting order, and as yet we i>(il
sailing the Blue.
With the final out the team ran toward the gym, but
told me to stay where 1 was, I asked them where they
were going and they told me il was a double-header
and they would be back in a minute. But I wanted to
see the freak, too, :;o I ran after them.
