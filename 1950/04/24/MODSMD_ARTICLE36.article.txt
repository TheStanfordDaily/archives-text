# Commons Hashers Reveal Idiosyncrasies of Patrons
## 
### MARY MASSEY 
Encina hashers recently an
; nounced the membership list of a
i "Ten Per Cent" Club, composed of
j exasperating Encina eaters.
Since about 10 per cent of the
people eating at Encina Commons
are irritants, the hashers there have
j elected them to the select group, the
' qualifications of which are ably ful
| filled by the varied types of Encina
j eaters.
"Hashurs assert there are stand
; ard "they'll-do-it-every-time" types
' at each meal; and at the head ot the
line comes the "stupid - question"
! type.
"Is that potatoes?" they innocent
j ly inquire, looking at a full tray
j of undisguised potatoes. Or, "Why
can't vjf have a table for ten?"
wlien all tables seat only eight.
Following this ingratiating type is
the "grumpy" type who always
j complains about the food. Included
! in this type are the "picky" eaters
j who want "just carrots" when peas
1 and carrdts are mixed together, and
| the 1 "forgetful" type who continu
! ously disrupts the whole line as he

goes back for food he has forgotten.
Then there are the various types
who either make extra work for the
hashers or just make them wait
around while they unconcernedly
finish eating in the manner to which
they have become accustomed.
These are the "reading-and-eat
ing" type, the "playful" type who
makes a mess of his food to see how
it will taste, and the "sloppy" type
who invariably spills something.
Of course, there is always the
"lone eater" type who has to have
a slow cigarette and cup of coffee
after everyone else has left the
dining hall.
Just eating is never exciting
enough for some energetic individ
uals who require food fights to fur
nish an outlet for their pent - up
emotions.
Some of their stock routines are
blowing butter through straws, Hip
ping butter pads across the room,
putting the salt in the sugar and
vice versa, spinning their plates on
the cement floor, and throwing ev
erything from cre'am-puffs to arti
chokes at anyone within range.

The Ten Per Centers are equally
clever in their devices l'or sneaking
extra food. Milk, salad, and desserts
are the most popular items, and are
therefore guarded by the biggest
hashers working at the Commons.
Ten Per Center methods here
range all the way from going
through the line twice to holding
extra milk under the trays; hut
when caught, this type indignantly
protests his innocence. In fact, one
irate eater once smashed his plate
in a tray of potatoes to show the
intensity ol his indignation.
The most notorious food gangster
was "Hysterical Harry," the butter
snatcher, who screamed and tried to
strangle the accusing hasher who
apprehended him.
It's types like these that make
eating and hashing at Encina Com
mons a case of every man for him
self, but at least all Encina eaters
aren't members of the Ten Per Cent
Club.
Freshmen in particular help to
compensate for the Ten Per Cent
ers, i'ojr hashers agree that they are
the best eaters at the Commons-
