# "DIGGER" ODELL
## Coffin Corner 
### 
Only a freshman could stomach the words, "Wait'll next year." For the
p;.st three years the Stanford campus has echoed with this statement. Its
not a fall observation or a spring fancy; it's an all-year-aroutul thought.
This year tlie thought still hangs on, but. with the exception of the class ol
5!!, no one has the heart to say it aloud. This was supposed to have been our
year -we had an unbeatable football team, an untouchable basketball team.
But we didn't! And even the lowly Irosh had trouble mustering up a
"Wait'll next year."
Just what can Stanford expect next year? Is there any use in even dream
ing those fatal words? The time has come to stop this wishful thinking and
look at facts. What are Stanford's chances come next year? Obviously,
wt 're losing a crop of good men this year. Just as obvious is the fact that
the class of '53 is providing a new crop which, in some eases, could more than
make up for the loss. Let's look at the picture as it stands now.
FOOTBALL—
To follow up ye olde saying, this could conceivably be it —the Indian
Resurrection. True, we lose a lot ol good men like Mitchell. DeYoung, I itus,
Field, Castagnoli, Rice, Rose, and others, but lrom last years unde
feated Frosh team come Crist, St. Genie, Laubscher, IVterson, and to close
the gaps in the forward wall, Broderick, Romano, Manoogian, Pyle, Martin,
and C ittriel. These names may not sound lamiliar now, but wait II next
year. vVhoops!
BASKETBALL—
In this department, to put it frankly, things don t look so good, but that
doesn't mean that they couldn't pick up by next winter. Coming up tiom the
Frosh are Stevenson, Fenster, Johnson, Zanlnovich, and MeC lusky, all yood
me/t. However, it'll take a lot to fill the shoes ol Yardley, Chavalas, Carvei,
Warren, and Clegg.
BASKBALL—
College baseball is a difficult sport. You get a good ballclub, loaded with
talent, and along comes a major league scout and picks it to pieces. We ve
got a loaded ballclub this year, and although we'll lose some good men such
as Bud Klein, Charlie Cole, Dave Melton, and Jim Claypool. we've got good
replacements in Dick Cole, A 1 Stellar, Bob Murphy, Doug Shumway, and
Jack Shepard. As far as Joe Chez is concerned, who knows what will
happen when news of him reaches the big leagues, il it hasn t yet.
TRACK—
At the moment Stanford is loaded here, but, unfortunately, the talent is
divided between the varsity and frosh teams, and they will never get to
g< ther. At the end of the year Gay Bryan, Otis Chandler. Bud Held, and
others go the way of all graduating students. However, replacements from
llit- Frosh team will be Pete McKay, Duke Johnson, Norm Jiles. Bob Simon,
and last, but hardly least, Bob Mathias. Mathias can be used to good ad
vantage just about anywhere in a track meet. Given two days in a meet—
like the Decathlon he would probably sweep up the joint, but a meet lasts
only a few hours, and even an Olympic champ can't handle too much in that
short time. So. like basketball, track remains a big question mark.
SWIMMING—
According to Coach Tom Haynie, the Indians should be the third best swim
team in the nation next year. At the end ol the season Jack Weeden, Ralph
Sal a, Karl Herrman, and Rod Mead will be out of the picture, but they will
l>e ably replaced by Bert Holiday, Mel Smith, Don Hanson, and Johnny
Miller. Watch these boys next year.
Well, there you have it. Before you make your own decision, however,
don't forget to take into consideration men coming up from the JV's. There
are lots of good men in this category, but'this being the Frosh Edition, we've
only put freshman talent on the block. The facts are here—il you want to
.» e what these men can do, wait II next year!
