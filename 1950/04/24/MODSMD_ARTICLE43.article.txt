# Four Card Crews Beat UCLA, Troy
## 
### 
Stanford's crewmen completed a
successful invasion of the Southland
over the weekend by winning four
races out of four. The big win was
the varsity's one - length victory
over the USC varsity Saturday at
Long Beach.
The junior varsity collected wins
over the UCLA varsity Friday and
the Trojan JV's Saturday. Two dif
ferent sets of men rowed as junior
varsity; so technically it was the
number three boat which took the
number one UCLA aggregation and
the number two boat which won
over Troy's jayvees.
The frosh eight showed great tal
ent as they beat the Bruin year
lings by two lengths in a time just
three seconds over the JV time.
