# Southern Cal Noses Out Stanford Nine, 5 to 4
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Opportunity knocked at the door, but Stanford's baseballers
couldn't quite force the door open as Southern California's Tro-i
jans got there firstest with the mostest and hung on real tight,
around the corners for a 5 to 4 win on the Sunken Diamond last |
Saturday.
The opportunity came in the form of league-leading St. Mary's;

5 to 4 loss to Ceil. If the Indians j
could have won. they would have
been occupying the league pent
house and would have been on the
way to their first CI HA champion- !
ship since 1931.
Stanford's chueker, Jack Heinen, j
was superb in defeat. He struck out j
12, but made the mistake of giving
up his hits in bunches, whereas Tom
Lovrich, Troy's beanpole pitcher,
scattered his hits enough to win.
Going into the lust half of the:
ninth, Southern Cal held a 5 to 2
lead. Lovrich started out the in- I
ning by whilTing Abrnmson and \
then ran into trouble, right now. I
Pinch-hitter Jim Walsh shot a si/.- ;
zling single into left, Jim Castagnoli
struck out. and then Bruce Cam-1
eron came to the plate.
Picking just tht* pitch he wanted,
he boomed a triple into right center (
that was still developing muscles as ,
it soared over center fielder Serge j
Freeman's head. Cameron probably
could have scored along with Walsh
but he played safe and held up at
third. Cameron eventually com
pleted the cycle when Bud Klein
slashed a single through the box.
With the score now 5 to 4, Dick |
Corzine ended the game, quicklike,
hy striking out.
The Cards drew first blood in the
second inning as right fielder Jim
Trabucco and Shaw teased walks
from Lovrich and catcher Bill Her
ron advanced them with a beauti
! ful sacrifice. Cameron, a real star
; on Saturday, sent Trabucco march
ing home with a liner past second.
The Trojans took a lead they
were never to relinquish in the
i third as they grabbed a 2 to 1 ad
; vantage. Heinen fanned the first
two to face him and then fed sue- j
, cessive singles to footballer Jay j
j Roundy, Freeman, Bob Li! 1 is, and !
Rudolph Valentino Regalado, the
J first two scoring.
The wind - blown gathering of
; 2,000 saw Southern Cal peck away
: for single runs in the fourth, fifth,
I and eighth innings.

Opportunity knocked at the door, but Stanford's baseballers
couldn't quite force the door open as Southern California's Tro-i
jans got there firstest with the mostest and hung on real tight,
around the corners for a 5 to 4 win on the Sunken Diamond last |
Saturday.
The opportunity came in the form of league-leading St. Mary's;

5 to 4 loss to Ceil. If the Indians j
could have won. they would have
been occupying the league pent
house and would have been on the
way to their first CI HA champion- !
ship since 1931.
Stanford's chueker, Jack Heinen, j
was superb in defeat. He struck out j
12, but made the mistake of giving
up his hits in bunches, whereas Tom
Lovrich, Troy's beanpole pitcher,
scattered his hits enough to win.
Going into the lust half of the:
ninth, Southern Cal held a 5 to 2
lead. Lovrich started out the in- I
ning by whilTing Abrnmson and \
then ran into trouble, right now. I
Pinch-hitter Jim Walsh shot a si/.- ;
zling single into left, Jim Castagnoli
struck out. and then Bruce Cam-1
eron came to the plate.
