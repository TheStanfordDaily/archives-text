# Faculty, Regents Agree on UC Oath
## Year-Old Loyalty Fight Ended on Berkeley Campus 
### 
The University of California fac
ulty voted Saturday in a meeting of
700 on the Berkeley campus to ac
cept the compromise resolution of
fered by the Regents.
The resolution y/as formulated by a
special committee of the Alumni As
sociation, and the faculty accepted
the offer, "made in good faith by men
of good will." They will not reopen
the question unless a faculty mem
ber is discharged without evidence
that he i.s a Communist.
The main provisions of the resolu
tions are as follows:
1. The"I am not a Communist . . ."
clause will appear in the salary con
tract rather than in a separate no
tarized oath.
2. Retention of the regular consti
tutional oath taken by all state of
ficers.
3. May 15 deadline for signing
either this contract or the old manda
tory oath.
4. Those failing to sign may apply
to Faculty Committee on Privilege
and Tenure for a hearing.
5. Regents to examine the commit
tee's findings, and to render the final
decision.
f>. The new contract to be signed by
all employees beginning July 1.
The basic difference between the
resolution and the old mandatory
oath i.s that faculty members may
not be fired without a hearing merely
for failure to sign.

On Friday, the Regents voted 21
to 1 in favor of the resolution, L. M.
Giannini the one dissenting vote. He

vard, Ohio State, Wisconsin, Prince
lion, and other universities. At the
University of Chicago, President

aries to aid faculty members dis
